Castiel’s hand dips into the sweatpants and wraps strong fingers around Dean’s erection. Dean cries in protest and absolute, overwhelming pleasure as he finally gets the friction he needs. Castiel leans down and swallows up his moans, licking into his mouth and sucking on his tongue in the filthiest kiss Dean’s ever been privy to.
The researching is helpful, but it’s a lot of information to take in. After a while, Dean finds himself zoning out, unable to focus enough to read. He shuts the laptop and gets up from the couch, wandering around the apartment. He walks in and out of rooms, unsure what to do with himself. He can’t sit still. It feels like he should be doing something else.
The two ends of the rope are draped over his shoulders and he can feel Castiel tying the first knot at the back of his neck. The knot presses into Dean’s skin as Castiel holds it in place while he comes around to tie another knot in the front.
“There’s pasta in the fridge if you’re hungry,” Castiel calls from the living room when the front door shuts behind Dean.
Dean gulps, remembering Castiel’s most important rule. “…maybe.”
A pair of dark sweatpants sits low on his hips and Dean immediately zeroes in on the dark tattoo inked into his skin there. Two matching stems of leaves frame each side of his hips and disappear underneath the waistband of his pants.
He has mixed feelings.
“She really helped me after Alfie. And I was seeing her a little even before that as well. Even just having someone listen to you is extremely helpful.”
“Yes, Castiel.”
“It’s a nice change,” Castiel says after a moment, “coming home to someone.” Dean feels a warmth settle over him at the comment. “What did you do all day?”
Bess pulls Dean into a hug as everyone is saying goodbye. “You’re coming again next week, right? It’s my turn to pick the game. I’m thinking Taboo.”
Dean groans. “Please don’t tell me you’ve turned into one of
Dean goes in for more than a quick peck, but Castiel leans out of his reach. He wraps his legs around Castiel’s waist and pulls him closer, but Castiel just scoops him off the counter and into his arms. Dean squawks and wraps his legs tighter around Castiel.
“That’s it, good boy.”
He finds himself longing for that now, though. Maybe not the whole nine yards, but for something more than…whatever it is he has with Alastair. He knows that what he and Alastair have isn’t fulfilling, not to mention wildly unhealthy, but that’s the way it has to be. He shouldn’t even be entertaining these thoughts of Castiel. They only make him crave something he can never have.
“Nah, I already know you’d win.” Dean can feel Castiel’s smile against his skin when he hums in consideration. He wraps his legs around Castiel’s waist to pull him closer. “We could have hot, dirty sex on your counter.” He ruts up against his body between his legs for emphasis.
“Good whores don’t talk back to their Masters.” The reply comes from across the room.
“No, Mas—Castiel, I’ll be good.”
Dean presses himself against Castiel’s back and wraps his arms around his middle, nuzzling into his neck. “Perfect.” He lays a kiss to the back of Castiel’s neck. “Now, you said something about nachos?”
“Yes, boss,” Dean says with a mock salute. He rides the wave of happiness for the duration of his shift until he and Tessa close and then all the way back to the apartment. He’s singing softly to himself as he steps through the door.
Castiel takes a long drink of his tea before continuing. “I want to go over the non-verbal safewords now while we’re both in a good headspace. During a scene, if you can’t speak, tap me three times.” Castiel taps Dean firmly on the thigh three times to demonstrate. “If you’re unable to do that for whatever reason shake your head three times, sharply.” He demonstrates that too then asks Dean to repeat the actions to show his understanding.
All right. Here it is: the beginning of the end.
“Of course not,” Dean chuckles, “This is the ugliest thing I’ve ever seen. It’s like they just sewed leftover scraps of fabrics together to get rid of ‘em.”
“Yeah?” he asks, fumbling to press his phone back to his ear so he can hear what Castiel has to say.
“But you still feel like you shouldn’t feel this way. Even though it helps you.”
“How was your day?” Dean asks as he gets settled on the couch.
“You deserve so much better, Dean. There is an endless supply of Doms out there that would love to have you as their submissive, myself included. It doesn’t have to be me…I mean, if it’s me that’s the problem, if you don’t want me like that I could set you up with one of the people I know. You deserve to be happy, and to have someone that would cherish you and treat you as more than just their plaything.”
“Perfect. We also need to talk about limits. My hard limits are watersports, scat, knifeplay…actually, I have a list on my laptop that goes into more detail of what I am and am not willing to try. I’ll pull it up and you can have a look later.”
“So you’ll come with me?”
“Yeah, that makes sense. I’ll try my best.”
“Cool.” Dean tries not to sound too disappointed. Tomorrow is their last day together before Castiel has to go back to work, but Dean’s not going to keep Castiel from seeing his friends.
DEAN: Don’t feel like cooking tonight so I’m gonna grab something for dinner on the way home. Thinking maybe Italian.
Dean’s so caught up in his thoughts that he doesn’t hear Castiel come home, or even knock on his open door before coming into the bedroom.
Dean shrugs, trying not to let the Doctor’s words get his hopes up. “I haven’t spoken to Sam or Bobby or any of them in years. When I came out to Sam he basically said not to contact him anymore.”
He admires the picture as he waits for a response. A blush spreads out across his freckled cheeks and he eyes the camera from under heavy lashes while biting his lip. The collar is on full display and one of his cuffed hands tweaks at his nipple. Dean knows exactly how much Castiel likes to play with his nipples.
Dean’s heart nearly stops.
Dean’s panting heavily, still blissed out, but hears Castiel grunt a minute later as he comes as well and then the weight of his warm body rests on top of Dean on the counter. Castiel is panting just as hard with his head resting on Dean’s heaving chest, eyes closed.
“I bought something for you.”
Dean thought he was doing better, recovering after leaving Alastair in the past. Only he finds out that healing takes a little more work than that.
“I just…can I think about it?”
“How old are you anyway?”
“No police,” Castiel says eventually, “but you still can’t go back to your apartment.”
Castiel chuckles and turns the laptop towards himself to look over the list. “A bit eager, are we?”
Dean focuses on shuffling the cards, trying to ignore the anger bubbling up under his skin. What does Meg mean by 'everything'? Surely not
“Let me make you feel better,” Alastair whispers against Dean’s neck and he has half a second to hope his Master has something similar to that numbing cream Castiel gave him before he yelps in surprise. Alastair slowly pours the contents of his glass down Dean’s back. It’s mostly ice water, but whatever alcohol Alastair was drinking still stings his raw wounds. “Doesn’t that feel good on your back?”
“Now it’s my turn to ask the questions,” Castiel says as soon as the waiter is gone again.
“Clothes off.”
Dean’s fingers pause on the second button of his shirt. He looks up at Castiel. “Uh, okay…Sir?”
She looks up as she pumps vanilla syrup into Dean’s coffee. “You got any experience?”
“None, Cas.” Dean leans forward, cupping Castiel’s face in his palms. “I swear. Never, okay?”
A flurry of bees is making a hive in Dean’s stomach. He shifts his weight from one foot to the other as he stares at the chips and cracks in the wood grain of the door, waiting.
“I—no—I was just—” Dean stammers, his cheeks heating. He shoots the bartender a grateful look when he replaces his empty beer bottle with a new one, ice cold condensation cooling Dean’s flushed skin as he grasps the neck of the bottle.
Castiel reaches for his napkin, but when he catches Dean watching he darts his tongue out to run along the length of his finger covered in sticky peanut butter.
“Are you okay?”
“Hey, Cas,” Dean starts as Castiel pours soap into the dishwasher, “I’ve, uh, been thinking about getting a job.”
“You don’t need to buy me things to make me happy.”
“I’m only joking.” The corners of his eyes crinkle as he smiles, holding back another laugh at Dean’s distress.
Castiel blinks and his eyes refocus. “More so because that was the only thing I was truly interested in. I went to grad school for Business afterwards, and that was in order to open my own shop.”
In the past couple of days, Dean’s learned that Castiel isn’t much of a morning person. So it isn’t surprising that when Dean wakes Saturday morning, the sun barely peeking over the horizon, it’s to a quiet apartment, Castiel’s bedroom door still shut.
There’s a moment of silence in the next room and Dean stays absolutely still, barely daring to breathe for fear of getting caught eavesdropping.
His panic lessens with the assurance that Castiel will be there. But it’s more than that: Castiel agreeing to come means that he doesn’t hate Dean, that Dean hasn’t driven him away completely. Maybe they still have a chance. He picks himself up off the floor and showers to get days’ worth of sweat and grime off and start preparing for the night.
“What made you come back?”
He opens his mouth to insist, apology poised on the tip of his tongue. He needs Castiel to forgive him, to understand why he said the things he did. But looking down at Castiel now, Dean sees the understanding in his eyes. Dean relaxes and smirks at Castiel to lighten the mood. If all really is forgiven he doesn’t want serious Cas. He wants fun, playful, flirty Cas.
Castiel smooths his hand down Dean’s back. “Why are you being punished, Dean?”
“Well for now, at least, can I go back to my book?”
His whole life Dean has been a caretaker, a protector, but it still shocks him when he looks down at Castiel sitting on the floor, head tilting slightly as he inspects each movie, and feels this sense of protectiveness come over him.
The openness of the apartment had always made it seem bigger to Dean. Growing up he had shared a room with Sam and he had roommates all through university. This is the first space Dean’s had all to himself and it’s more than big enough for him, but now it seems less open and more…empty.
“Dean,” Castiel breathes quietly.
“I don’t need your help. I don’t need you to take care of me. And I sure as Hell don’t want to talk about my messed up past with you.”
Castiel hisses in pain and Dean immediately lets go. “Shit, sorry. I totally forgot.”
“You said yourself that you raised him practically on your own.”
“It’s amazing,” Dean mumbles in explanation and takes another bite to avoid any further comments.
He opens his mouth to repeat himself but just shakes his head when he sees the glint in Castiel’s eye that means he definitely heard. Castiel seems to take pity on him, though, because he wipes the rest of the grease and peanut butter away with his napkin.
“That depends on the severity of the offence. I could take you across my knee and spank you until every inch of your ass is red and glowing from my hand. I could tie you up and edge you over and over again. I could lock you in a cock cage and not let you come for a month. Or perhaps I’ll do the opposite and make you come so many times you black out.”
“It’s okay, just tender.” Castiel offers him a small smile before leaning in close again and trailing his lips up to Dean’s ear. “I’ve got Scrabble,” he says coolly.
Dean frowns. This isn’t a regular scene; this is a punishment. He can’t back out of a punishment.
The couch sinks under his weight when Dean plops down next to Castiel after turning off the light and casting the room into darkness, illuminated only by the glow of the TV.
“Cas,” Dean whispers into the dark, “Cas, it’s okay, it’s just a dream.”
His eyes dart to Castiel’s lips as he parts them slightly, and Dean can feel his heart thumping in his chest, wonders if Castiel can tell how hard it’s beating.
miss him.”
“I’ll help you get back on your feet. I’ll help you find a job, a place to live. I’ll lend you some money until you can support yourself again.”
“Dunno. An hour?”
“Y’know what, keep the change.” The man stuffs the handful of leftover bills and coins into the tip jar beside the register. “You’re probably the best fuck around.”
“Yeah, okay.”
“Great.”
“Were you planning on telling me that you enjoy being spanked a little too much for it to register as a punishment?”
Dean glowers at Castiel, opens his mouth to speak, but promptly shuts it and instead folds his arms across his chest and presses his cheek against the cool glass of the window.
“Uh, yeah,” Dean says as he sets the pan on a cooling rack.
Dean blinks and breaks his staring match with the collar to look up at Castiel.
Too soon Castiel is yawning and excusing himself to get ready for bed.
A man steps into Dean’s path, blocking the view of the bar with his broad leather-covered chest. “Hell of a show,” the man says.
“I’m not going to hurt you. You’re safe.” Castiel’s voice fills the darkness. And when Dean blinks his eyes open again Castiel is there, standing in the same spot, hands still raised, his eyes filled with worry as he watches Dean.
As Dean and Castiel talk he feels his anxiety cooling to a manageable level, locked beneath a thick layer of alcohol buzzing pleasantly through his body. He lets Castiel do most of the talking, happy just to let the deep voice wash over him and lull him into a sense of calm.
“In a way, I suppose.” Castiel chuckles, eyeing Dean like he just had an idea. And any other time Dean would have humoured him, but not today. Castiel seems to sense Dean’s mood, or just reads the hard line of Dean’s mouth because he sobers quickly and reassures, “You can say no. Or if it’s the texting me part that’s bothering you we could figure out some alternative. You could keep a food log of the things you eat throughout the day.”
Castiel catches him staring and quirks a smile at Dean as he pops the rest of the pickle into his mouth, sucking the juices off each finger one by one. He swipes the dribble of stray juice from his chin and wipes his hands on his napkin.
Dean ducks back into the bathroom and waits until Castiel’s and Meg’s footsteps pass by the door before making his way back downstairs.
Castiel hums happily and wraps his arm around Dean. “I was angry earlier today, but I will never punish you out of anger. And we do nothing if either of us isn’t in the right headspace. Okay?”
“Yeah, I’m here every Thursday and Saturday.”
Castiel turns quickly and waits for the man to pass him. He’s completely still when he feels the floor tremble beneath him under the weight of heavy boots, but as soon as the man whisks past Castiel is down the hall in a flash, opening the now unguarded door without pausing.
“You have amazing taste in cars,” Castiel comments as his eyes rake over the Impala.
Alastair sighs like he’s disappointed, but his smirk makes Dean think this was the outcome he wanted, and it makes his stomach twist uneasily.
“—and being reminded every damn day that…that I can’t have you. That I messed this up.” He gestures between them.
His soothing tone is deceiving. Castiel spanks Dean right in the centre of his sit spot, making him gasp and choke on his own spit as he repeats, “I will not lie.”
Dean swears again, Castiel’s text tipping him over the edge. He spills into his palm, his grip tightening as he fucks into his fist in jerky motions.
“I’ll see you soon, Dean.”
“I leave the day after next.”
“If it were Alastair putting this rule in place it would be for different reasons than Cas is doing it.”
Castiel frowns. “It feels…impersonal when you refuse to look at me, like you don’t want to be here.”
Dean stands naked in front of Alastair moments later, head down, arms behind his back as he waits for further instruction. He tries not to wince as his arms rub against his back, but Alastair notices.
He doesn’t want to bother Castiel at work and doesn’t want to make him worry about nothing. At least, Dean hopes it’s nothing. He hopes he’s just being paranoid and that man isn’t too close with Alastair.
Castiel mumbles some wordless grunt of acknowledgement, swallowed up by the thick stack of papers he’s leaning over.
Dean learns some things about Dom/sub relationships.
“I don’t know if I’m okay with us doing more intense scenes when I can’t fully trust that you’ll safeword out if need be. And you just freaked out during a more intense punishment.”
“So, what do you think?”
, Dean thinks as Castiel presses his third cookie onto the pan, each ball larger than the last. Dean pauses with a ball of cookie dough between his fingers.
Dean almost says yes, would love nothing more than to leave this place with Castiel, but he catches a glimpse of the small stage and shakes his head. “Can’t; I’m almost up.”
They watch Netflix while they eat; a nature documentary at Castiel’s request. And Dean is surprised to find that it isn’t totally awful. He doesn’t even protest when one episode becomes four and then suddenly they’ve spent the entire evening watching Nature’s Weirdest Events.
“I want to implement a new rule,” Castiel finally says.
“Clarence?” Dean asks once they’re alone.
CAS: After we deal with your punishment, of course.
“No, no, I can be good.”
Additionally, we’re getting sooooo close to the end. We’ve got three chapters left, maybe?
“Tonight we will all bear witness to what happens when a sub forgets his place, when a sub has the audacity to whore himself out to other men.” Alastair slaps Dean across the face to get his attention. “You want to be a whore? I’ll show you what it’s like to be a whore. Then maybe next time you’ll think before betraying the only person in your life that cares enough to put up with your whiny, pathetic bullshit. The only person who’s bothered sticking around.”
“I know, I know.” Dean waves off Doctor Pavloska’s comment. There had been enough of that the last session. “I thought about what you said about needing to have someone other than Cas in my life and I got in touch with an old friend from university.”
“Look, I don’t know why you have a problem with me, but I would never hurt Cas. I love him.”
Dean blinks and it takes a moment for his brain to catch up. He slips back into the change room to get his regular clothes back on—well, the clothes Castiel let him borrow—and they leave the store without the mesh monstrosity.
When Dean is aware of his surroundings again he’s on his back with Castiel curled up against his side, his eyes closed with a dopey smile plastered on his face.
“And what about this new rule is giving you pause?”
“Keep your hands above your head,” Castiel instructs.
“Good boy.”
The slaps alternate, Castiel first striking one, then the other cheek and quickly covering Dean’s ass in a stinging redness. Dean ruts against the cheap material of Castiel’s slacks, moaning at the harsh friction and pushing further back into Castiel’s palm.
Dean doesn’t respond, just concentrates on the task given to him, hoping to earn Castiel’s forgiveness. He takes the fake dick as far into his throat as he can before he has to back off, trying not to shift his body too much.
“Master, please. What did I do wrong? Tell me, I’ll fix it,” Dean reaches for Alastair, trying to pull him closer. He can see the disappointment and disgust in the man’s eyes. “Please,” Dean whimpers.
“Did you think—Dean, your safeword is always an option. That’s why I always make sure to check in with you before we do anything and ask your safeword.” Castiel’s hand stills in Dean’s hair. “Are there any other times you would have safeworded, but didn’t?”
Castiel looks far away for a moment before blinking and refocusing. “The whole thing was a mess. I did some research after and put more precautions in place to make sure that it never happened again.”
“It’s not healthy to base your life around a single person.”
Castiel smiles as he watches Dean.  “I wanted to.”
“I can’t sleep.” Castiel shuffles his feet. “I had a nightmare. Could I…?”
Castiel chuckles at him. “Okay, can you at least roll over for me?”
“I think I can find it in my heart to forgive you. But only on the condition that you have microwave popcorn for the movie.”
A warm body between his legs snaps Dean back to the present. Castiel runs light fingertips up Dean’s thigh, still clad in the comfortable sweatpants he borrowed, and up his sides.
“Try the closet,” Dean suggests, tilting his head to the right, “see if there’s any wire hangers. Those’ll work.”
And the fact that Castiel is so far away makes it worse somehow. Logically, Dean knows he wouldn’t see that much more of Castiel even if he wasn’t a four hour flight away, but he would still sleep a lot easier if Castiel was at least in the same state as him.
Dean holds the car door open for Castiel and gives him a quick kiss. “I did. Thanks for inviting me.”
“It’s embarrassing, okay? Why’s it so important?”
Castiel picks up the pace, pumping his three fingers in and out of Dean in short thrusts and Dean moans, finally feeling his orgasm creep up on him after so long. Castiel doesn’t let up, keeps fucking Dean with his fingers until the air is being punched from Dean’s chest and he can barely get the breath to speak.
Castiel is immensely thankful for her kindness. He feels lightened as he turns and makes his way towards the back of the club. He keeps an eye on Alastair as he moves, wary to stay hidden behind the bodies of other people milling about or dancing to the loud music.
“For not paying attention, Master.”
It seems to spur Castiel on, groaning and nipping harshly at Dean’s nipple once more before moving on to the other. He skates his fingers along the insides of Dean’s thighs, over the soft material of his sweatpants and Dean spreads wider in invitation.
Dean’s not sure it’s even possible to come on Castiel’s voice alone, but he’s more than willing to try. He lies back fully against the counter, shivering as his bare skin makes contact with the cool granite.
“See you guys next week,” Dean says on the way out the door.
“Oh, thank God.”
What if he was calling Alastair to let him know he just saw Dean? Alastair could be on his way here right now.
Castiel runs his palm down Dean’s back, grounding him with his gentle touch. He hadn’t realized he was so sweaty until Castiel’s cool hand touches his clammy skin. He’s panting into the blankets, grabbing fistfuls of it so he won’t just reach down and finish himself off.
Dean hasn’t spoken to Castiel since ruining their date a few days ago and Castiel hasn’t reached out to him either. Dean hadn’t really expected him to after the things he’d said to him, but his mood still dropped every morning he woke up and didn’t have the texts he’d grown accustomed to waking up to the past week.
“Afterwards, Alastair dragged him towards the private rooms. He came back out not long ago without Dean, and now he’s just sitting at the bar drinking, so I guess Dean’s still in one of the rooms back—Hey, wait,” she calls, but Castiel is already up, standing on unsteady feet.
Castiel wakes with a massive headache. There’s a cool hand smoothing the sweat-coated hair from his forehead and he blinks his eyes open slowly to see a round face peering down at him, haloed by a wave of soft brown hair. Her eyes are pinched with worry, and she offers a small smile when Castiel blinks up at her.
“Dean,” Castiel grabs his wrist. He looks at Dean, his head tilting slightly as he frowns. “We may be in a relationship where power dynamics come into play occasionally, but that doesn’t mean I control your life.”
“No.” Sobs wrack his body and make his words come out in hoarse whispers. “Please don’t.” God, Alastair’s right: he’s pathetic. Nothing’s even happened yet and he’s already crying, snot streaming from his nose, choking on pleas for mercy.
Dean cringes a little at the mention of whips, the wounds on his back still healing, but doesn’t say anything.
The buzzer sounds, startling both of them, and Dean pushes off the couch to let the delivery guy into the building. His knees ache from kneeling on the floor, but it was well worth it.
A hand on his shoulder has Dean going rigid, his head dipping low. He hadn’t heard him approach, hadn’t been paying attention, and Dean chides himself as his heart hammers against his ribcage.
Castiel is talking to Meg, Dean realizes. About what she had said earlier. Shit. He may not particularly enjoy Meg’s company, but Dean doesn’t want to cause any trouble between her and Castiel.
Castiel mumbles something that Dean can't quite make out as Castiel yawns between his words. Dean hasn't slept much the past couple of days, so he's more than okay with just resting on the couch with Castiel for the rest of the afternoon. He gets comfortable again, lying with his back against Castiel’s chest, both of them wrapped in the knitted throw blanket even though the apartment is too warm for it.
“Fine, just lemme grab a coffee first.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“You first,” Castiel says, extending a hand towards Dean.
Castiel makes a humming noise as works his tongue further inside and Dean moans as the sound reverberates through his body, sending jolts of pleasure tingling just under his skin.
“No.”
It’s a nickname Meg gave me when we were kids. I was named after an angel so she thought it was funny.”
“Oh. Yeah, okay.” Dean lets his arms fall to his sides and stands behind Castiel, watching as he goes right back to work. “I’m just gonna watch some TV, then.”
“Yes, Castiel.”
“Okay! I get it, okay? You’ve made your point, just stop.”
Anyway, this also means most—if not all—of my writing time will be spent on this new project. Regardless, I promise to not completely forget about this story. I have the majority of the next two chapters already written so I’m good to go for a few weeks.
Castiel follows him down, licking and sucking and nibbling on his nipple. Dean’s fingers twitch to tangle themselves in Castiel’s messy hair, but he can’t without hurting him, so they just kind of hang in the air, uncertain. But he needs to touch, needs to feel Castiel. One of his hands grasps Castiel’s bicep and the other scratches over his back, digging his nails in.
“Mmm, and now you’re stuck with me,” Castiel says with his back turned to Dean as he grabs his mug of tea.
Dean cuts Charlie off mid-sentence and starts to get up from their table. “Shit, sorry. I didn’t think we’d be here this long, I’m actually supposed to be working right now.”
“No, Castiel. It feels good. I like it.”
“Coming,” he calls even though he knows he can’t be heard all the way on the ground floor.
Dean smirks. “Oh, I doubt that.”
“You perform here often, then?” Castiel asks as Dean finishes getting dressed.
Castiel snakes one hand between their bodies to grip Dean’s erection and Dean’s hips stutter to a stop. His fingers squeeze bruises into Castiel’s shoulders. Castiel drags his hand down the length of Dean’s cock and then back up, rubbing under the head of his sensitive tip.
“The rope feels good, doesn’t it?” Castiel’s jeans brush against Dean’s bare skin as he steps close, pressing his body against Dean’s. He smooths his hands down Dean’s back, over the rope. “I have nylon rope as well. It’s much softer. But I thought you would appreciate the roughness of this. The way it rubs against your skin with every movement.”
other than this overwhelming numbness
Dean pulls back until the head is resting against his lips, brushing against them as he speaks. “C’mon, Cas. Wanna hear you.”
The bartender walks by and Dean grabs his attention to order a whiskey.
The man laughs, a sound from deep in his throat, and the smile that crosses his lips is contagious. The bartender places a glass of dark liquid in front of the man. He eyes Dean as he lifts the drink and swirls it around a few times before bringing it to his lips and taking a sip. Dean watches his Adam’s apple bob as he swallows.
“Shit, wait. He’s still here?” Dean jolts upright, no longer floating. He immediately realizes that was a bad idea as his body screams at him in protest. Everything aches, and sitting up has pulled at the torn skin of his back, opening the fresh wounds more and making them bleed.
Castiel watches him closely. “I’m not your Dom, Dean.”
A sudden idea hits Dean then, and he bolts off the couch so fast his head spins. He heads into the bedroom where Castiel has a full-length mirror hanging on the back of his closet door. Dean quickly gets undressed and picks out a pair of panties from the top drawer of the dresser where Castiel had neatly put them away.
Alastair laughs and calls Dean a whore as he wipes Dean’s own come on his stomach. He barks for someone to cut Dean from his bonds, then disappears.
Just a heads up this chapter has a little bit of attempted self-harm.
“What was that?”
The finches eat their fill and then fly back to the safety of the trees. Once all the seed is gone they thank the man and continue down the path that circles back to where they parked.
“Stay here. Don’t move.” Castiel leaves the kitchen and Dean strains his ears, listening to Castiel’s steps grow farther away as he makes his way to the bedroom.
“So, what’s the game of choice tonight?”
His mind is screaming at him to just leave, bolt for the door and avoid the possibility of angering his Master further, but he senses that Alastair is displeased with him and that’s somehow worse.
Dean can’t help but smile every time he comes out of the changing room when Castiel gives him such enthusiastic reactions. He makes Dean spin to show off the jeans or shirt he’s modeling and Dean is loving the attention.
They stand beside the Impala, regarding each other silently. Dean doesn’t want to say goodbye to Castiel yet, but he can’t think of a reason to drag this on longer. “Thanks for lunch, Cas. I had a great time,” Dean says lamely, rubbing a hand along the back of his neck.
Snippets of different days fly through his mind, too fast and too insistent for him to shut out. The days Alastair would restrain him to the bed for hours, coming in every once in a while to use him. The days Alastair would make Dean beg like a wanton whore in front of dozens of people only to deny him for being too needy. The days Alastair wouldn’t even touch Dean, saying he was too defiled to even lay a finger on.
Before he leaves, Dean forces himself to eat something more substantial than stale crackers or a granola bar. He knows he shouldn’t scene on an empty stomach—he probably shouldn’t scene even then with the state he’s been in the past few days—but the itch is still there, the need to right his wrongs through punishment and prove he’s of some worth.
Dean spots Castiel immediately. It’s as if he’s attuned to his position at all times. He smiles as he walks over, coming up behind Castiel without being seen and leaning in close to whisper, “Fancy meeting you here.”
Dean already knows what’s wrong with him. He doesn’t need some know-it-all with a Ph.D. to lay it out for him.
“Yeah, Cas, of course.”
The stools on either side of Castiel are taken, so Dean leans in against the bar next to him, so close their sides press together. The rest of the tension drops out of Dean’s shoulders at the contact. His heart warms when he sees Castiel’s hand wrapped around a glass of scotch, the same drink he’d ordered for him the first time they met.
“I’m fine, Cas,” Dean cuts in, “I just wanted to come say thanks for, y’know, everything, before I left.”
Swivelling around on the stool, Dean snatches up his new beer and downs half of it. He swipes at the sweat gathering on his forehead with the back of his hand, wishing the club had better air flow. The stool next to his squeaks and Dean looks over to see a man flipping through the drink menu on the bar-top. The plastic pages sound like Velcro when the man tears them apart, stuck together by old alcohol and Lord knows what else. The man scrunches his nose in disgust and Dean can’t help but laugh.
“Cas?” Dean asks after a moment of them lying in silence.
“With that in mind, do you still feel the same way?”
He blinks up at Castiel who has his hands raised in the air in a placating gesture. “I didn’t mean to,” Dean murmurs, “I’m sorry.”
He wants Castiel to bind him with rope and take him apart. He wants to see Castiel in full Dom mode. More than that, he wants to prove to Castiel that he can be a good submissive, but Castiel wasn’t even giving him the opportunity to do that.
“Please,” Dean moans and arches into the touch, his arousal still burning within him, sizzling just under the surface.
Dean jolts back suddenly, surprising Castiel and himself. He wants to kiss him, longs for every touch they share, every lingering stare. But a kiss is too intimate. He wants to laugh as the thought flits through his brain. Castiel has seen him naked, has watched as another man whipped him raw and fucked his throat. He has seen Dean with tears streaking his face, seen him in the middle of a panic attack, seen him laid bare and still stuck around, still wants Dean in a way that makes him a little dizzy.
Castiel’s head tilts slightly. “Why?” He lifts Dean’s hands again and at the grumble of disapproval he places a kiss to Dean’s wrist over the cuff and reassures, “I’m not saying no, I’m just genuinely curious.”
While he waits for the soup to warm up Dean picks up his phone and texts Castiel.
Dean pauses, chewing on his lip before finally saying, “I was nervous.” The hairs on Castiel’s chest tickle against his cheek as he speaks. “If I go to therapy it’s like…it’s like I’m admitting that there’s something wrong with me.”
“Yeah, he found me while I was still in university, just about to graduate. I went out with a couple friends to celebrate and ended up hooking up with Alastair. After a few months I realized how hard it was to get a job and was running out of money fast, trying to live on my own and pay back my loans. Then Alastair said he’d take care of it, but of course there was a catch.”
Hope you're all enjoying the story so far!
Dean feels a hot breath against his exposed skin and he realizes that one of Alastair’s men is on his knees behind him. He flinches when Alastair claps his hands loudly right next to his ear. “All right, you heard me: who wants first taste of my disobedient submissive?” Several men are up on stage before Alastair finishes speaking.
A short woman with wavy brown hair rounds the corner, crowding into the already cramped space of the entryway. “Clarence! God, you’ve been avoiding me for so long that I was starting to forget what you looked like.”
“Impala?” he says hesitantly.
Dean pulls Castiel into a kiss just as his orgasm finally takes over him and he screams his release into Castiel’s mouth. Everything around him falls to the back of his mind as wave after wave of unending pleasure wraps its way around his body, drowning him under the onslaught for so long he’s not sure if he had multiple orgasms or if it was one drawn out one.
“Does it hurt?” Castiel asks. There’s a thick circle of angry, reddened flesh around Dean’s neck from the collar.
CAS: Hope your first session goes well today.
Dean pulls his dick free of the panties, the hard length curving up towards his stomach. He takes a few more pictures displaying his nudity, then takes a video stroking himself slowly, making a show of it for Castiel.
Dean winks and Castiel snorts, shaking his head.
Dean’s hand speeds up in time with his panting breaths, his hips lifting off the bed as he works himself closer to orgasm. It isn’t going to take long. He can feel the pleasure building, his muscles tensing as it barrels towards him.
Shit, Dean thinks, that’s not good. Probably best to play it dumb. “Oh. What did she have to say?”
“No. That’s not how this works.”
As soon as his cock stops twitching Alastair pulls out and goes into the bathroom. A moment later, Dean hears the shower running. He closes his eyes, settles into the mattress and tries to ignore the mix of come and melted ice dripping from his hole. He hums to himself to keep calm while he waits. Alastair likes to take long showers.
He hisses in pain and tries to force his muscles to relax. As soon as the pain begins to turn to pleasure the fingers withdraw. Freezing ice is pressed against his skin, but after the beating Alastair inflicted it’s a welcome relief to his heated ass and thighs.
Dean raises an eyebrow. “Sounds fancy.”
Hands grip Dean’s shoulders and his eyes fly open as he’s pushed down, forced to take more of the dildo still whirring beneath him. He tries in vain to hold himself up on shaky legs, but the stools are kicked out from under him and all at once the thick plastic cock is inside him, filling him completely.
Castiel still holds his chin, thumb running lightly across Dean’s jaw, but Dean looks down, stares at the grey tie around Castiel’s neck instead.
“Okay.” Dean’s throat feels scratchy and he asks for more of the orange juice, which Castiel happily hands over. When he’s finished all of it Castiel asks him to lie on his stomach on the couch, standing up so Dean can stretch out.
“You’re late,” Alastair says as he opens the door. He turns his back to Dean and disappears into the dark apartment. Dean closes the door behind him and kicks off his boots.
“What about Sam?” Castiel asks instead, and Dean perks right up again. Talking about Sam is easy.
“What do you need, Dean? Tell me.”
“No. Well, I mean, yeah, kind of. But that’s not why. And I know it’s not the same. It’s just…the last two people you had a relationship with screwed you over. I don’t want you to think I’m only using you because you buy me all these nice things.”
Castiel is gone when Dean wakes up, leaving him alone in the quiet apartment.
Above him, Castiel is breathing hard but is otherwise silent. Dean frowns. Castiel is rarely so quiet during a scene. Sure, he’s only ever had a handful of scenes with Castiel, but Dean’s worried that Castiel is angry with him.
As I said, I got carried away with the word count. But I wanted to fit so much more in before the beginning of the end, which comes next chapter. I’m so excited, I’ve already got most of it written cause I skipped ahead. So please enjoy all 11k words of this extra long Dean and Cas goodness filled chapter
“You’re telling me,” Dean says as he reads the text.
He doesn’t know why he’s suddenly crying and it makes him angry. He doesn’t want Castiel’s soft touches, doesn’t deserve it. He wants to push Castiel away and deal with this himself, like he usually does, at the bar drinking until he can’t think.
He has nearly four hours until six o’clock. He rifles through the kitchen, trying to figure out what to cook for dinner. He decides to use the rest of the fresh vegetables in his fridge to make soup and starts chopping.
I had a bunch more fluff and angst and shit planned but I might shorten it a little to make sure I can actually finish this and give the story the love and attention it (and you guys!) deserve. It all depends on how much I need to write a day for this new book. (which is in the brainstorming stage so I still have a little bit of time to write self-indulgent deancas)
“A few friends are having a get-together tomorrow.” Castiel is already typing a reply on his phone. “We have game night every Sunday, but I’ve blown it off the past couple weeks, so I really should go this week. I’m sorry, I totally forgot.”
“He only
“Eight sharp,” she calls after him, “Or I’ll fire you before you even start.”
“My apologies. I might have been a little too enthusiastic.” Castiel presses a gentle kiss to Dean’s chest. “I’ve never been with someone with nipples as sensitive as yours. The noises you make when I lick them…”
Dean sits up straight, disentangling himself from Castiel’s arms. “I’m a little concerned now, but yeah, sure.”
His phone chimes in his pocket and he digs it out quickly. He’d been hoping for a text from Castiel, but his face falls when he reads a list of instructions from Alastair. Dean had completely lost track of the days. It’s a good thing Alastair texted or he’d have spent the night under the covers.
“Most parents stick with Adam, or Noah, or Joshua if they want a biblical name.”
“She said she was disappointed you had to miss your appointment,” Castiel continues, “and was wondering if you wanted to reschedule. She has time Wednesday and Thursday afternoon next week.”
“Never feel like you need to hide from me. I want to see, and hear, and feel all of your reactions.” Castiel punctuates that by sitting back up and snapping his hips forward.
The best way to deal with trauma is to lock it behind a wall and not think about it. If he doesn’t think about, it can’t hurt him. The problem is the memories don’t always stay behind that wall. They slip through the cracks, or bust the wall down completely and flood out all at once.
He takes a breath. “But what scares me more is whatever the hell’s happening between us. I’m scared of how much I
“I say that sounds amazing,” Castiel sounds breathless and it makes Dean flood with warmth, “But I’d rather be your boyfriend.”
“I’m not gonna talk to your friend about this stuff.”
Castiel groans and rests his head against the steering wheel as he pulls to a stop at a red light. When he lifts his head he says, “If you can tell me there is zero chance of Alastair or somebody else already lying in wait at your apartment then I’ll turn around.”
Tessa looks out at the line of people still waiting to be served. “Y’know what, you’re hired. Be here tomorrow for eight. As much as I’d love the help right this minute, I don’t have time to train you and serve customers at the same time. You’d just end up slowing me down.”
Dean nods and scrolls down. “Are you having problems with concentration or memory?”
“Are you ready to talk to me?” Castiel asks, and Dean grumbles, but nods. “What happened at the end there?”
“I’m fine,” Castiel assures him, pulling back despite Dean’s disapproval. He offers a small smile when he looks down at Dean’s unconvinced face.
Dean shifts, wiggling his hips and trying to push back against Castiel.
He imagines it like the movies, being caught off guard by a van screeching to a stop on the side of some empty street, being thrown into the back and hog-tied before he’s whisked off to an unknown location, never to be seen again. He’s clearly been spending too much time in front of the TV, but Dean’s fear of Alastair keeps him frozen on the spot, staring at the closed door.
Dean hands Castiel a plate piled high with food. “Is that everything, then?”
“Probably,” Castiel murmurs, but he’s already moving in the direction of where Dean was last seen. He turns back to the woman who looks so young and innocent in her frilly pink babydoll and soft makeup. “Thank you,” he says, his voice sounding too loud in his own head.
Castiel buries his face between the crook of Dean’s neck and shoulder, sucking and biting a dark bruise there. He pulls Dean into a kiss at the same time his hand palms at Dean’s dick over his jeans, making him gasp into the kiss.
Hey, I wrote and edited this all today, so don't hold me accountable for any mistakes just enjoy two updates in two days as we barrel towards the end of this fic!
“Just a refill on the water, for now, thanks,” Castiel says.
Dean pulls away from Castiel’s chest. “No, now is not a good time to mention that.”
She’s right, though. Dean doesn’t want to admit it even to himself, but she’s right.
“I want you to understand that you’re not being punished for not going to see Doctor Pavlovská; you’re being punished for lying to me. If you don’t want to see a counsellor, that’s your choice. But I will not tolerate you lying to my face.”
Dean slowly comes back to himself as the knots are worked free and he manages to push himself into a sitting position when Castiel needs to get at his chest. The last of the knots are untied and Dean sighs as the loose rope drags over his skin one final time.
“Upstairs, second door on the right,” Bess directs him.
“I’m not good,” Dean mumbles against Castiel’s chest, “I’m…tainted.”
Dean makes a show of giving the man a once over, taking in his suit and perfectly polished shoes that somehow look perfect next to his ratty, tan trench coat. He looks back up and takes in the dark hair, mussed and shiny with perspiration, and the pinpricks of stubble lining his strong jaw.
“My wife is from here.”
“Yeah, I mean I get it. It’s just…different than what I’m used to.” Dean shrugs, not wanting to steer the conversation towards Alastair again.
The first crack of the whip falls unexpectedly across his back, harsh and unforgiving, and Dean screams. His eyes go wide and he struggles against his bonds, but the way Alastair’s strung him up doesn’t give him much wiggle room. The next blow lands and Dean realizes he’s making choking sounds.
“Hello, Dean.”
Thanks so much to everybody for reading and commenting and leaving kudos!
“Filthy whores need to be stuffed nice and good, don’t they?” Alastair coos, stroking a hand through Dean’s sweat-slicked hair. “Do you want to be speared on this nice toy Master has for you?”
“More,” Dean breathes, tasting the hot air between them, “Need more.”
“Over my knee,” Castiel’s voice comes from behind him and Dean’s dick twitches in interest.
The man waves his hands in the air dramatically as he talks, and a minute later he’s shoving his phone back into the pocket of his jeans. He wipes a hand over his face and starts walking down the hall. In Castiel’s direction.
Thank you all so much for the comments!! I appreciate every single one and they all make me wanna cry happy tears.
“All I ask is that you try. I just want us to be able to talk to each other if there’s something bothering us: in and out of a scene. We need to have trust for this relationship to work and I can’t trust you if you don’t talk to me.”
A few minutes later, Dean reaches for popcorn again and uses it as an excuse to shift closer, eliminating some of the space between them. He feels Castiel shift to look at him, and tenses slightly, but after a moment Castiel looks away again.
“It’s Saturday,” Dean says. Castiel just squints at him and Dean sighs. “Every day for almost four years today has been the day I scene with Alastair at the club.”
“I’ll text you,” Dean says as he straightens. He takes a step back and feels Castiel’s arms loosen around him until they’re no longer touching.
Dean’s eyes flick to his face in the rear-view mirror. His eyes are puffy and red, and there’s a distinct handprint burning on his cheek. He opens his mouth to decline, to give some excuse and tell Castiel “next time” but his stomach growls at the same time Castiel chimes in and says, “I’m buying.”
“Not tonight. You have to be awake for work in five hours.”
“You made bread from scratch?”
Castiel is staring at him, dumbfounded. “I’ve never heard of him keeping the same submissive for more than a year, at the very most.”
Castiel gazes at him with an amused grin, but leans down and says, “I love you,” and kisses Dean’s forehead. “I love you,” he says as he kisses Dean’s cheek, then the other. “I love you.” Castiel peppers Dean’s face in kisses until Dean’s laughing, telling him to quit it already, but secretly hoping Castiel will never stop.
Dean quickly snaps another picture, this time of his hand cupping his growing erection, hidden beneath the pale pink panties.
When Dean turns back to the bar he jumps, startled by the fact that Castiel is standing just a few feet away, having moved as soon as the stranger advanced on Dean, ready to intervene.
Castiel steps into Dean’s space, so close that Dean can smell sweet citrus on Castiel’s breath. “You didn’t do as you were told,” Castiel whispers as he grasps Dean’s cage-free dick, squeezing just lightly.
The accompanying sounds of approval coming from Castiel as he spoons soup into his mouth or chews on the fluffy, still-warm bread…well, they’re just an added bonus, and if the noises coming from his kitchen are in any way borderline pornographic, Dean doesn’t comment, nor does he mind.
They have so many bags that it takes two trips to bring everything up to the apartment and it takes even longer to put all of it away.
Dean is quick to obey, clasping his hands behind his back, holding on tightly and digging his nails into his arms in an attempt to distract from the pinpricks of pain in his knees.
Dean realizes he’s been totally spaced out when the waiter comes back and he jolts when an arm comes into his field of vision as the waiter places their drinks on the table. Castiel eyes him curiously but doesn’t comment.
“Sometimes,” Dean answers, his eyes glued to the notebook. “When I do something wrong sometimes it’s like I’m overwhelmed with guilt. Being…reprimanded helps ease the guilt.”
Castiel watches the muscles of Dean’s back move as he tries to pry the chain from where it’s secured to the brick wall, desperately yanking his head back at the same time, so frantic he hadn’t heard Castiel barge in, hadn’t even flinched when the heavy door slammed against the wall.
Meg opens her mouth to say something, but she gets cut off by a loud squeal from the kitchen as Hannah and Castiel make their way back out to the table with more margaritas and a bowl of pretzels. Garth and Bess rejoin the group as well and Dean deals the next round of cards. He loses the next three hands, too caught up in his own head to focus on the game.
The ice cube is rubbed into his skin until it’s completely melted and Alastair is reaching for another. Only this one he uses to poke at Dean’s hole. His whole body goes rigid and he kicks his feet, spreader bar and all, in an attempt to escape the touch.
Dean’s been hovering by the door since Castiel texted to tell him he was on his way home from the airport. As soon as he hears the clink of keys in the hallway, Dean yanks the door open and pulls Castiel close. He inhales his scent, sighing deeply as Castiel crushes Dean against his chest.
Castiel stares at Dean, wide-eyed, as his head whips around trying to locate Alastair. “I can’t—he can’t see me here. With someone else. With you. He’ll—he’ll.” Dean winces in pain as he shifts.
“I don’t know, okay?” Dean yells, “But I’ll figure something out. Always do. Better than…”
“So, how are you? I was so excited when you called; it’s been too long.”
CAS: Then when I come home I will hold you down and spank you until you’re begging for mercy. You can thrash and wiggle all you want but I won’t stop until you are a crying mess in my lap. And then I will put the cock cage on you anyway, but for two weeks. Or until I think you’ve learned your lesson.
“Good,” Castiel praises when Dean finally stands in front of him, naked.
“Hold on, does that mean you’re seeing someone?”
“I—what?” Dean’s brain can barely form a thought at this point.
Sure enough, there is a row of empty metal hangers in the closet. Castiel grabs one and hands it over to Dean who quickly bends the hook and sets about picking the lock on the metal collar.
Dean stays silent and Castiel finally pushes up off the couch. Dean thinks that he’s leaving, ending the conversation there because he’s being difficult, but then Castiel grabs the laptop from his desk and brings it back.
Dean’s not sure at what point he fell asleep, but suddenly it’s morning and he’s waking up in a cocoon of blankets on the plush mattress in his room. He vaguely remembers Castiel shaking him awake late last night and stumbling half-asleep to bed.
Tessa hovers close to him. “You should take the rest of the day off. And stay home tomorrow if you’re still not feeling good.”
The steaming Styrofoam cup quickly warms Dean’s frozen fingers and the rich hot chocolate warms him from the inside, but his feet are still freezing and he can’t wait to get home and curl up under a pile of blankets with Castiel.
He spends the day cleaning the apartment. Having a job now means chores like laundry and cleaning the bathroom gets neglected more often. Catching up on chores is a much better use of his time than sitting down and letting a stranger pick through his brain for an hour.
Castiel drives them to the mall and parks by the attached grocery store so they can stock up on food after getting Dean some new clothes. Dean still isn’t entirely comfortable with Castiel buying him a whole new wardrobe, but he can’t argue about it because he does need clothes to wear, but he has no money of his own so he decides he’ll just have to pay Castiel back sometime in the future.
After their meal is paid for, Castiel walks Dean out to his car.
“Try and ignore this,” Dean says as he sends the picture to Castiel.
He should have been paying more attention, shouldn’t have had so much to drink, and definitely shouldn’t have been talking to Castiel at the bar. If Alastair had caught him even smiling at another person it would’ve meant serious trouble. Though he supposes he’s already in trouble now. He just wanted to not get stuck in his own head during the performance, but now the whiskey sloshes around unhappily in his stomach and he can’t focus.
Dean brings his cuffed hands up and touches the collar, the leather smooth under his fingers. “I love it. Thank you.”
Every time he moves along the dildo, forwards or backwards, it causes the rice under his knees to move and dig further into his skin until Dean thinks they’ll be stuck there permanently.
“There is always somewhat of a learning curve in a new relationship. Ours is no different. You will learn my preferences as I will learn yours, but I don’t expect you to know everything right off the bat.” His voice moves farther away and Dean turns his head slowly to watch Castiel as he moves back over to the closet.
He can hear the smile in Castiel’s voice when he replies. “Meet me at Brick House?”
Alastair moves in a flash, hitting Dean across the face with the palm of his hand. The smack echoes through the room. “You repulse me,” Alastair spits as Dean sits there, stunned, tears springing to his eyes.
He types into the search bar “how to tell if you have a concussion” and clicks the first link that pops up. He reads through the list and looks up from the screen to where Castiel is reading, folded in a position that can’t be comfortable.
Castiel brushes his fingers over Dean’s cheek, caressing him when Dean leans into the touch, his breath sighing out. He blinks up at Castiel when the warm weight of his hand disappears.
Castiel slides another finger in and spreads, opening Dean up wide. The heat coils in his belly and he feels it growing, ready to burst, so close. And then Castiel’s fingers are gone. Dean’s empty and his hips continue to thrust into the air, searching for release.
“Just don’t go.”
Alastair laughs at him. “Perhaps it works best if applied directly.” Dean bucks, trying to get the ice-cold water off, but only succeeds in sending it dripping down his back and earning himself a hash slap on his ass.
The music cuts out and both Dean and Castiel turn towards the stage where someone taps against the microphone, making it screech. He tries to give Castiel a reassuring smile. “I’ll be fine; I do this every week.” With that he starts towards the stage, ready to prove to Castiel that he can handle himself.
Dean shrugs. “I dunno.”
Dean stands outside of Castiel’s room, worried about making him mad if he wakes him up. But breakfast is quickly getting cold and won’t last. Finally, Dean knocks on the door and after a moment he hears movement from inside.
“You should be proud of yourself as well.”
He pulls off and licks at the head of Castiel’s spent dick, wishing he could really feel and taste him and not the rubber of the condom. Castiel shivers above him and pulls Dean up onto the couch and into a breathless kiss.
Dean shuts his eyes tightly against Castiel’s accusation and the displeasure in his voice.
Dean considers disobeying again because Castiel is still being gentle with him, but he pulls his shirt over his head, just wanting to get things moving already.
Castiel places his hand on top of Dean’s over the table and Dean glances up at Castiel then, but quickly looks away again when he finds Castiel staring at him. The sleeve of Dean’s shirt rides up when he shifts and Castiel immediately notices the angry red marks Alastair’s handcuffs dug into his skin.
“And if I don’t like the drink you ordered?”
“Okay,” Dean agrees after a moment of silence passes.
He just needs Castiel to take him, stake his claim on his body and erase the taint of all the other people who have laid their hands on him or even so much as looked at him.
“I don’t wanna talk about it,” Dean mumbles.
“…Dean? Are you still with me?”
“Almost. There’s just one more place we need to go.” Castiel leads him down a few storefronts. “Do you remember the first night we met?”
Would Castiel even want someone like Dean? He had said he wanted Dean the other night, but Castiel doesn’t really know him. Dean’s a broken shell of who he once was. He comes with a lot of baggage and he’s not a great sub. Castiel seems like the kind of Dom that expects the highest quality of submission. Dean’s certain he doesn’t fit the bill.
As the movie starts Dean becomes painfully aware of the amount of space between him and Castiel. There’s nearly an entire couch cushion separating them, but he can feel every shift the body next to his makes, smell the sweet scent of his deodorant when he leans forward for another handful of popcorn, hear the crunch as he chews. He’s barely paying attention to the movie at all; he’s too focused on Castiel.
“I asked for no whip on this!” A man calls from the other end of the counter, holding up his cup.
“Older than twenty, younger than forty.”
The floorboards creak and Dean blinks his eyes open groggily, lifting his head to see a Castiel-sized silhouette standing in the doorway of his room.
Castiel continues to rub over Dean’s prostate and adds a third finger to work Dean open further. There’s no pain, none of the pleasant burn Dean craves, only pleasure.
Alastair is never this quiet. He always has some order for Dean or some insult ready to be hurled his way. Silence can only mean trouble for Dean and his mind races, trying to figure out what he did wrong, trying to think of a way to fix it before Alastair hurts him again.
“Please what?”
Castiel is silent as he tilts his head and listens, and eventually says, “No.”
Dean squishes his own burger down so he can actually fit his mouth around it and take a bite. Flavours swirl together on his tongue and he doesn’t realize he’s moaned around his mouthful of food until Castiel catches his eye.
Castiel comes into the kitchen while Dean is mixing the batter. He’s so quiet and Dean’s so engrossed in his own little world, his mind drifting as he stirs chocolate chips into the dough, that he almost doesn’t notice Castiel is there.
“I definitely remember everything up until that brute of a man punched me and then everything after waking up on the floor.”
Dean knows it’s unfair to keep seeing Castiel. At this point he’s sure they could never just be friends, but he can’t offer Castiel anything more than that. Not while he’s still with Alastair. As much as he wants to explore whatever this is with Castiel, staying with Alastair is safer. At least with him there isn’t the complication of emotions.
“And that would be?”
“How was your day?” Castiel asks when he comes home and finds Dean lounging on the couch in the living room. “Did you meet with Doctor Pavlovská?”
Castiel shakes his head. “No, not that either.”
Dean’s never been a fan of sharing a bed with his partners: they hog the blanket, there are limbs everywhere and he’s always hyper-aware of each time he makes the mattress shift, worried about disturbing the person trying to sleep next to him.
The man studies Dean as he waits for his latte. Dean tries to ignore him, a little weirded out by how closely he’s being watched.  When he turns his back Dean can still feel the man’s eyes on him.
He’s pretty sure Castiel has a headache, if the Advil he took with lunch is any indicator. He had lost consciousness after being hit, but Dean’s not sure if that counts or not. His speech hasn’t been slurred. “Appearing dazed” Dean reads and huffs quietly. Castiel sometimes seems as if he’s on another planet entirely.
“God, yes.”
“Please let me come, Castiel.” Too much longer and he’s going to come with or without permission.
But even with Dean next to him, Castiel still has nightmares. Dean gets awoken in the middle of the night to Castiel thrashing around in the sheets, whimpering in his sleep.
Castiel doesn’t respond until after Dean has finished eating the pasta he picked up.
,” Charlie continues, “I totally feel like she’s a part of me now. We’ve been through so much together and grown together. If I ever lost her it would feel like losing a part of myself.”
“What the hell am I supposed to do all by myself for four whole days?”
A collar is like a physical representation of their relationship, of the fact that he belongs to Castiel. And that Castiel wants him. Castiel wants him and no one can touch him while he’s wearing Castiel’s collar.
Dean grinds up against the thigh between his legs. He can feel himself growing hard as Castiel bites harshly at his neck, soothing it with his tongue afterwards. Dean grasps at Castiel’s back, fingers twisting into the thick sweater when he feels Castiel grinding back against him.
“Coming right up.” The waiter takes off again with their empty glasses in hand.
“Feels good,” he murmurs.
“Okay. Well, let’s see.” Dean picks at one of the deep fried pickles, withdrawing quickly when it burns his fingertip. He rests his burned finger on the cool glass of his half-empty beer. “Grew up moving a lot, never staying in one place for more than a year. Dad was completely checked out most of the time, so it was just my little brother Sam and me. I pretty much raised him on my own after Mom died.
“Dunno,” Dean says and licks some sauce off his finger, “I had a couple of cups of coffee at work today.”
When Dean wakes again it’s past noon and his back is mercifully numb thanks to the miracle cream Castiel gave him. He digs his phone out from where it had fallen underneath his bed and heads out to the kitchen to settle his grumbling stomach.
“Thank you. Again,” Dean says, still not able to meet his gaze.
“You don’t need to. Though I am here if you do want to talk. Whenever you need me. You can’t just ignore your problems and pretend they aren’t there. It’s interfering with your daily life at this point. You need to find a way to heal from this and seeing a therapist can help you with that.”
Dean texts Castiel on his way out of Doctor Pavlovská’s office after cutting their appointment short. There had only been fifteen minutes left, but after the conversation turned towards Sam he just needed to get out of the tiny office and clear his mind.
He grinds his ass down into the mattress to feel the rope rub against his skin again and to jostle the plug. Dean does it again and again, chasing the brief moment of pleasure the movement brings. He stops when he notices Castiel beginning to undress.
While his few sessions with Doctor Pavlovská—or
On the end of a deep breath, Dean shuffles out of the room in borrowed clothes he hopes Castiel will let him keep. They’re comfortable, if a little too big, and smell like lavender detergent.
“I just want to clarify that this isn’t a twenty-four-seven arrangement; when we aren’t in a scene we’re just boyfriends.”
Dean just wants this conversation to end. He doesn’t want to talk about Alastair with Castiel. And he certainly doesn’t want to have this conversation naked.
“Be careful. I may not look like much, but if you run into trouble I can throw a pretty mean punch, so just holler.”
“I’m not taking advantage of him. We’re dating.”
Dean looks down at himself. “Oh. Yeah.”
Dean thinks. He’s the one who shut her out, cast her—and everyone else—aside for Alastair.
“Touché,” Dean grumbles under his breath.
When the elevator doors close behind him and he’s alone he finally lets the tears fall. He presses his hand to his mouth to muffle his cries until he reaches the ground the floor and then hurries to his car where he slips into the driver’s seat. He fumbles his phone out of his pocket and tries to calm his breathing. He stares at the screen and has half a second of doubt before he presses call.
“Yeah,” Dean scoffs, “and you thought
“If you’d rather, I can take the whip to you again.”
“Oh no, I’m not having you pass out on my watch. Go home and get some rest.”
Castiel pauses and Dean barely resists the urge to let the dildo fall from his lips to apologize properly.
“What about you?” Dean looks over the counter to the few people standing in line. It hasn’t been too busy today, but he still doesn’t want to leave Tessa to deal with the lunch rush by herself. “Will you be okay without me here?”
“What is it? Where is this doubt coming from?”
Dean finishes his burger quickly. He hadn’t realized just how hungry he’d been. Now he picks at what’s left of his fries and watches Castiel finish his burger.
“It’s bad, isn’t it?”
“What I mean is that it doesn’t matter what I prefer. You are your own man and I have no control over you: nor does anyone else—without your say so—for that matter. But the point is that you can drink the whiskey if you want to. I’m not going to stop you and this club doesn’t have a drink limit for people participating in scenes.”
Dean picks out a booth near the back of the restaurant, away from the few other tables with people dining. He unfolds one of the cloth napkins on the table and dumps a few ice cubes onto it, shuddering as images of Alastair flash through his mind.
“Uh, thanks,” Dean says, blushing at the compliment, “I love being on stage; it feels like the only place I can really let go, y’know?”
Dean leans against the door. “Thanks. This baby’s my pride and joy.” He runs a hand along the slick roof of the car affectionately.
“Well get to it, then. The food will be here soon,” Castiel says with a smirk that Dean quickly returns before pulling Castiel’s pants down enough so they aren’t in the way. Just as he’s about to do the same to his underwear Castiel taps him on the arm.
“Pathetic,” Alastair spits out and pushes away from Dean like he disgusts him.
“Okay, okay,” Castiel says as he’s pulled to his feet, “I’m coming already.” He wraps his arms around Dean and kisses his forehead.
“Hey, Cas?” Dean calls. Castiel takes a minute to look up from his book, but Dean chalks it up to him finishing reading the sentence he was on rather than a delayed response due to a head injury. “Do you hear that ringing noise?”
“Let me help you. If he’s threatening you or blackmailing you, whatever it is does not trap you with him. You have options, just—just let me help you.”
“Not distracting enough,” Dean murmurs to the empty room.
Castiel’s hits become harder to anticipate: he’ll smack Dean hard once, then just swat him lightly, or spend a minute feeling the warmth blossoming on Dean’s backside before raining down an unending flurry of spanks and then go right back to rubbing soothing circles until Dean can’t keep up.
Their conversation tapers off though, and Dean watches the crease in Castiel’s forehead grow, so he slips into the kitchen and makes a cup of the fancy loose leaf tea that Castiel likes.
He slides down Dean’s body and begins to fulfil his promise. Castiel presses kisses to every part of Dean’s body, starting at his throat and working his way down. He licks and bites at Dean’s skin, drawing gasps and tiny bitten off groans of pleasure from Dean’s throat.
“You need to communicate with me.”
“I did. The way you move…you make it look effortless being up there. It’s mesmerizing.”
Castiel whispers soothing words until Dean calms and then the only sound is Dean’s sniffling and occasional hiccup, and the murmur of the voices of the other people in the club, covered by the steady beat of the music pumping through the speakers.
Castiel’s voice breaks his reverie, “All right, let’s go through the rest of the symptoms then.” He closes his book and sits up properly in the armchair.
“Put it down as a hard limit for now, and if you want we can always revisit trying it out later.”
“It’s fine, really,” Dean breathes, watching Castiel’s fingers gripping his wrist, his thumb tracing small circles on his skin. “Everything is fine now.” And Dean almost believes it; wants to. But past experience dictates this will all go up in smoke sooner or later.
Boyfriend. The word makes him giddy. Thinking of Castiel and the things he wants to do with him. And it surprises Dean a little that most of these ideas aren’t sexual. Sure, there are a few dozen of those as well, but what Dean really wants is shockingly PG.
“And what are you sorry for?”
Dean makes a non-committal noise.
Dean has a moment to reason that leaving the club with someone he just met isn’t a good idea, but before he can think too much about being chopped into pieces in this man’s basement his mouth is already working into a wide smile. “Hell yeah,” he beams, “Let’s go.” He grabs Castiel’s hand and pulls him through the club and out into the cool night air.
Castiel’s body blocks Dean’s view and he can’t see what he grabs. Castiel starts to turn and Dean whips back around, afraid to get in trouble for looking.
“How was work?”
Alastair glares down at him. “Do you
Seeing the changes in her appearance makes Dean realize exactly how much time they lost because of Alastair.
“Oh, yeah. I work here, actually.”
“That’s my little cock slut.” The hand at his ass moves in soothing circles now and Dean slumps in his grasp, happy at least that his Master gives him praise. “Climb up.”
They finish cleaning up the mess from breakfast together and Dean’s just finishing wiping down the table when Castiel’s cellphone chimes on the counter where he left it to charge. Castiel grabs it and immediately groans.
“Dean.” Castiel steps forward and lifts Dean’s chin up with gentle fingers.
“Hush now, pet.” Alastair’s voice turns soothing, a mockery of the term, as he runs his fingers down Dean’s chest. “I’ll fix that attitude of yours.”
Alastair used to love when Dean acted out. He used to love punishing Dean, putting him back in his place. And so Dean would act out on purpose. But Castiel isn’t Alastair. And now he’s taken things too far. He’s made his Dom angry, annoyed his boyfriend.
“It looks stunning on you,” Castiel says as he sits back against the couch.
“Good.” Alastair runs a gentle hand through Dean’s hair. He sighs and leans into his Master’s touch, the praise sending pleasure and pride through him. He can be good for his Master. “Come on, then.”
“Can we start over?” Dean asks, a shy smile playing on his lips as he steps out of Castiel’s embrace.
“Yes, Dean, you can come.”
He can deal with physical pain. That part is easy. That part helps him let go. The constant, sharp pain of the rice on his knees isn’t the same kind of arousing pain as being spanked or flogged or having clamps on his nipples, but it’s still manageable.
“And?” Dean prompts. He wants to hear Castiel say it. He’s going to savour bashful Cas as long as he can.
“Good. Now I believe I have a promise to fulfil. Turn around and bend over the bed with that pretty ass in the air.”
“Can you sit up for me?”
When Alastair comes back he roughly pulls Dean’s legs apart and wraps each ankle tightly in a cuff that he attaches to a spreader bar. Dean wiggles in his bonds, panic rising as it sinks in that he’s truly trapped now, nearly immobilized and at the mercy of his angry Master.
Dean likes getting to know Castiel. It makes him happy that at the very least he has someone he can talk to instead of being cooped up in his apartment with no one but himself to keep him company. It’s been so long since he’s had someone in his life he can consider a friend.
“They were quite happy when I finally told them that I would like a new one. They gave this to me today and wanted to take my old laptop, but I said no. I thought you might like it, but if you don’t want it then I can always bring it to them tomorrow and they can use it for parts or something.”
It doesn’t take long for saliva to start building up and he swallows around the thickness in his mouth.
“Maybe not, but the relationship you have now with Castiel is still similar to the one you had with Alastair in terms of the whole Dom/sub dynamic. This type of play is like an addiction. It causes a sort of high, but when you have a Dom that doesn’t know how, or refuses to properly care for a sub after the play is over you drop from that high and crave more, always looking forward to the next dose, or in this case, scene. The play turns from something healthy to something harmful.”
Dean stills immediately and croaks out, “No, Master, please. I’ll be good.”
“Fuck you,” Dean growls.
He knows this is his chance to finally ask Castiel for what he wants, but he’s not sure he can voice his desires so openly. “I—I don’t know.”
“You want me to make you cry next time?”
As Castiel leans forward to reach for the popcorn bowl on the coffee table Dean does the same, intercepting him and brushing his fingers over Castiel’s knuckles. He looks up from their hands to see Castiel turn his attention from the movie to their hands, then up to meet Dean’s eyes. He opens his mouth as if to speak, but Dean withdraws his hand quickly and turns back to the TV.
Castiel pulls back and Dean whines at the loss of his skillful tongue. But it’s quickly replaced by a second slick finger pushing in oh so slowly to join the first. Castiel scissors his fingers as he pumps them in and out agonizingly slow.
Faint beams of sunlight stream through Dean’s thin curtains and he groans when the alarm clock says it’s only six in the morning, immediately wanting to crawl back into the warmth of his bed. Instead, he shuffles across the cold laminate floor of his apartment in search of his jacket. He finds it in a heap on the couch where he’d thrown it last night and digs the ointment out of the pocket before retreating to the bathroom.
Dean and Castiel text non-stop over the next few days. Sometimes it delves into flirting, bordering sexting, other times they just talk about their day or their apparent shared love of Vonnegut. Dean was shocked to find out that Castiel had never read
Through the window, Dean watches the man walk down the street. He puts his phone to his ear and glances through the glass at Dean before he turns the corner out of sight.
, drowned out by the murmur of voices in the club.
“I know our relationship started in a…unconventional way, and certain circumstances made us move in together, but I need you to know that I want you here. And that’s not going to change even when you can support yourself financially.”
He hears Castiel’s draw in a breath, but can’t bear to face him. He keeps his head down as Castiel’s weight lifts from the couch.
It’s still early and Dean isn’t very enthusiastic about spending another day alone in the apartment, so he rolls over, hoping to fall back asleep. But there’s a banging noise from somewhere in the apartment, probably what woke him in the first place, and Dean slips out of bed to investigate.
Instructions mean the performance is going to be tough, especially if Alastair wants Dean to prep himself beforehand and show up wearing a plug. Alastair never asks him to wear a plug; he prefers to do all the prep work himself so he can fuck Dean while he’s still too tight, so it always causes Dean pain or at least discomfort. Alastair says he likes the noises Dean makes when it hurts a little too much.
Dean picks up Castiel’s copy of
Dean stays silent, turning his gaze downward, away from Castiel. But Castiel still holds his chin in a firm grip. And fuck, Dean’s so turned on. He can feel his cock twitch in his jeans.
“Good. Are you okay to keep the cage on?”
He closes the bathroom door gently behind him and retreats to his room to dig out some clothes for Dean. He rummages through his drawers and settles on a soft t-shirt and a pair of dark sweatpants.
His brow furrows as he hands over a wrinkled fifty. “Do I know you from somewhere?”
“So that’s why you went for English Lit? To open your own store?”
Shit, he shouldn’t have said that. He hasn’t even told Castiel that he loves him yet. Fuck.
Alastair had never been one to lay out specific rules to begin with: he’d just punish Dean for whatever he felt like.
Another swat lands, harder this time, jolting Dean forward. “We can’t fucking hear you.”
Castiel considers a moment. “No, not exactly. Having to deal with so many people is draining. I got my BA in English Literature, so this job certainly isn’t where I expected to end up.”
“Did you think I was going to hit you for spilling tea on me?”
Castiel stands silhouetted by the dim light of the hall. His hair looks as if he’s run his fingers through it a time too many, and—unlike the last two times Dean saw him—he’s wearing comfortable-looking dark jeans that shape his thighs nicely paired with a loose-fitting knitted sweater that swallows him up, making him look smaller.
“You were very enticing,” Castiel says, but Dean isn’t sure if it’s a compliment or not given his current predicament. “So enticing, in fact, that I got hard looking at those pretty pictures you sent me, thinking about how much I wanted to mess up those nice panties you put on.”
Dean throws his head back and feels it connect with Alastair’s chin, making his grip loosen enough for Dean to jolt forward and out of Alastair’s grasp. He reaches for Castiel, but the men are dragging him farther away, Castiel’s shoes scrambling for purchase on the beer-slicked floor.
“Well, look at what we’ve got here.”
How many times had Alastair watched Dean in his apartment, doing everyday things? Masturbating? Cuddling with Castiel on his couch and dry humping until they both came? Dean turns wide eyes to Castiel. He’s going to think Alastair put him up to it, that it’s all a part of his fucked up games.
. He looks small sitting cross-legged on the floor, blue eyes wide and innocent as he blinks up at Dean.
Castiel acquiesces and instead runs his hands up and down Dean’s back, careful of the still-healing whip marks scattered there. The salve seems to have worked because he feels along one of the worse gashes and sighs when he finds only a thin, raised scab.
“Good.” Castiel smiles at Dean’s enthusiasm. “Then the next step is to discuss our limits, and rules, our expectations, and how our relationship will work.”
“I said I was going to cherish you and give you all the things you deserve.” Castiel crooks his fingers and drags them over Dean’s prostate, the movement just as slow as everything else Castiel has done, drawing out a long moan from Dean at the constant pressure on that wonderful bundle of nerves inside him.
Castiel rests a hand on Dean’s thigh. “I have a friend who might be willing to see you if you’re interested.”
Dean shudders as Alastair runs a cube of ice from his drink down his neck then up to trace along his lips.
Talking about it won’t solve anything.
“Fuck it,” Dean says to himself before texting Castiel again.
The razor clatters to the tiled floor of the bathroom and Dean crashes down after it, tears streaming down his face as he sobs silently. He’s not even strong enough to do this. God, he’s pathetic.
“How could I deny you when you’ve been waiting for so long?”
“Now we don’t have to fight over the computer when I need it for work.”
Okay, that’s a lie. Maybe he had thought about what it would be like subbing for Castiel: a firm hand to make him soar and gentle caresses to bring him back down. But the thought of a real, intimate, long-term relationship? That hadn’t really occurred to him; it wasn’t something he thought he wanted.
Castiel is seated at the counter in the kitchen, leaning over a steaming mug of tea and reading a book that Dean can’t make out the cover of as Castiel bends the pages back on themselves.
Thanks for all your nice messages about defeating the sad. I actually went on a mini vacation to a cabin in the middle of nowhere for a few days and it was like hitting reset on my brain so I’m doing better now, but I also have a bunch of projects on the go so hopefully I can update this sooner rather than later but I make no promises.
“Oh, I highly doubt that.”
“You mean like a shrink? No way. I’m not crazy.”
Barring his doubts from this morning, the day has been perfect. Dean had been apprehensive about living with Castiel so soon after entering a relationship with him. He still has doubts, but his walls are crumbling around Castiel. It makes Dean both eager and terrified.
Castiel puts on some music while he reads in his armchair and Dean lies across the couch spending some time on the laptop. It’s nice being in each other’s company, but Dean still wishes Castiel would close that damn book and fuck his brains out already.
Dean pokes the pasta around in his bowl, hyper-aware of Castiel’s eyes on him.
“That I’m not Alastair,” Castiel finishes for him and Dean winces. He hates comparing Castiel to Alastair. “I get it. Healing takes time.”
“You shouldn’t drink if you’re going to scene,” Castiel chastises.
He still feels half asleep, almost like he’s floating. He knows his back and ass are red and sore but everything feels far away, like he’s disconnected from both his body and brain, and he’s in no rush to fully come back to himself; he knows when he does he’s going to be in a world of pain.
Dean sends another photo, a close-up of the head of his cock leaking precome, some of it smeared on his fingers, making them shine in the dim light of the bedroom.
After a while, he decides to make breakfast for Castiel and himself. He goes all out and cooks up omelettes with both bacon and sausage on the side. The apartment is still quiet when he’s done cooking, so he stalls and makes toast, brews more coffee, and sets the table.
“No. Tattoos are just hot as hell.”
The next morning passes like the last. Castiel is already at work, and Dean’s wandering around the apartment looking for something to keep him occupied. He spent all of yesterday cleaning the entire apartment; he even fixed the dripping faucet in the kitchen. And now there’s nothing left to clean or tinker with.
He continues whispering soothing words until Castiel’s features smooth out and he drifts back to sleep, peaceful for the rest of the night.
“All right, then I require one batch of cookies as payment.”
The crowd stirs at the mention of police and a few people start filing for the exit, though most remain where they are, some looking annoyed at the pause in the show, and some even yelling to get on with already.
Castiel’s face hardens at the mention of Alastair but softens as Dean continues. He rubs soothing circles on Dean’s thumb and sighs, “This is actually what I wanted to talk about.”
Dean takes a moment to think about it. He feels wonderful. He feels sated and a little sore but in a good way. He rolls his shoulders as he takes inventory of his body, but there are no injuries to be found.
He’s been thinking about it for a few days now but he kept putting off talking to Castiel about it, worried about how he would react.
The pleasure that sparks through Dean is more than welcome after experiencing only pain for so long and he jerks in Alastair’s grip, except he imagines it as Castiel instead. He closes his eyes and imagines that it’s Castiel he’s bound for, imagines that deep voice whispering against his skin, encouraging him with filthy words of praise, and then he’s sighing and spilling into his hand.
Castiel reaches a hand out to touch the side of Dean’s face, running his fingers over his cheek and across his jaw. Dean opens his eyes at the touch and finds Castiel staring down at him, his face full of awe as they lock eyes. Dean has to turn his head, has to look away from whatever emotion lies behind Castiel’s infinitely blue eyes.
He ends up going through the fridge and cupboards, throwing out everything that’s expired. He has to empty the trash can under the sink twice because the majority of the food is more than a year old.
“Just trying to release some of the tension in here.”
Dean stares into Castiel’s eyes, seeing only adoration reflected back in the endless blue. And then they’re leaning towards each other and Castiel presses a chaste kiss to Dean’s lips. He’s been craving harsh touches from Castiel, wants to see his more dominant side in action, but the gentleness Castiel treats him with is just as good. Maybe better. He treats Dean like he’s something to be cherished.
Dean groans at the possessiveness in Castiel’s voice. It shouldn’t turn him on: he’s dealt with Alastair’s jealousy, the wrath that it rains on Dean’s head when another man or woman leans in too close at the bar, or even if someone stares too openly during one of their performances. But there isn’t any anger attached to Castiel’s possessiveness.
Dean makes himself a cup of coffee and sits at the kitchen counter, waking up slowly as the sun rises. He showers and dresses in his new clothes and makes himself a second cup of coffee, waiting for Castiel to get out of bed.
Dean sighs and tells himself it’s only for a few more days.
It’s only his fourth shift, but Dean’s enjoying his new job. He already knows a few of the regulars and chats them up when they come in for their coffee or muffin. He messes up a few times, but most people are nice about it.
It’s exactly the reassurance Dean didn’t know he needed and he wants to leap into Castiel’s arms and never stop kissing him, but he stays on his knees, staring dumbly at the beautiful piece of leather in front of him.
The rope embeds itself between his ass cheeks and brushes over his hole. The happy knot presses up firmly against his perineum and makes Dean gasp. The roughness of the rope makes him squirm and the knot shifts slightly with his movement. He sways his hips from one side to another to feel the glorious pull of the rope again.
“I tried to get it off already. Alastair has the only key. I could pick it if I had anything, but…” he shrugs. “He could come back any minute. You should just leave. I got you into this mess, but you can leave, get out now before something worse happens. It was stupid of me to think I could just leave Alastair.”
Castiel won’t be home for hours and Dean needs something to keep him occupied while he waits. Cooking is the best distraction he knows. They still haven’t been out to get groceries, but while he was tidying up the kitchen Dean found a box of pasta and an only recently expired jar of sauce.
It becomes routine after that, Castiel slipping into Dean’s bed to sleep each night, though they eventually move from the guest room to Castiel’s bedroom. His bed is bigger and the mattress more comfortable.
Castiel’s warm breath puffs out against the side of Dean’s neck and he suddenly feels light-headed. He doesn’t hear what Castiel says, too focused on watching the room slowly tilt around him. He casts a glance around the club, searching frantically.
“Sorry,” Dean mumbles.
“Dean?” In front of him Dean stands shivering with his back to Castiel, arms wrapped around his middle, still naked under the tan trench coat. He turns at the sound of his name, and Castiel’s gaze is drawn down. “You’re not wearing shoes.” Dean looks down too, wiggling his toes in the plush rug in the front hall of Castiel’s apartment.
Castiel grimaces as his headache pulses insistently through his skull. “We have more important matters to deal with right now.”
Castiel huffs and lays a hand over Dean’s, fingers splayed across his stomach. “Come on, grab the cheese and salsa from the fridge.”
“Shh, I’m here, I’m not leaving you.”
“No,” Alastair agrees, “we haven’t. Not in person. Though I have had quite the eyeful.” He turns his gaze to Dean’s shocked expression. “You didn’t think I’d let you have your own apartment without keeping an eye on you, did you? Of course I’d set up cameras to make sure my pet is behaving.” He clucks his tongue, “Aw, don’t give me that look.” His laugh sends nausea rolling through Dean.
“You are not weak.” Castiel’s knees creak when he stands. He wipes warm water on his slacks to dry his hands before stepping closer to Dean and holding his head gently in his palms.
“No, Dean, of course not. That’s not what I meant. Alastair doesn’t treat you with any respect. He treats you like an object rather than a person. You don’t have to stay with someone like that; you have options.”
Castiel hums and unclips the metal piece holding Dean’s wrists together, but leaves the cuffs and collar in place.
“Seriously? You’ve never seen
He’s glad he asked Castiel if they could get flour and baking powder and pretty much everything else in the baking aisle while they were grocery shopping earlier. Now the kitchen is stocked with everything he needs to make whatever he wants.
“Good.” Castiel unbuttons his pants and shifts on the couch as he pulls them down along with his underwear.
But Castiel couldn’t control himself. It’s only a few days later that he comes home with another surprise for Dean.
When Castiel is finished undressing he climbs on top of Dean and straddles his waist. Dean can’t help but reach out and touch one of the twin stems of leaves on his pelvis. “You didn’t tell me you had tattoos,” Dean says as he traces the lines.
He had tried to be productive and do laundry, but then he found the discarded underwear from that night, stained with dried come, and he just stood there, holding them, overwhelmed with guilt. He knows he’s being pathetic: he’s the one that drove Castiel away. He hadn’t even known the man long enough to warrant this level of mourning.
Dean turns the Impala around, pulling an illegal U-turn and getting a few angry honks from the cars behind him in response, but he couldn’t care less.
“If this is about what just happened, I’m sorry. I can honestly tell you I did not plan to go that far, but you—I care about you—a lot—even though we’ve not even known each other a week, I find myself thinking about you while I’m at work, smiling at the texts we send back and forth, looking forward to the next time I get to see you.”
“Let me know if you need help job hunting,” Castiel says once he breaks away.
“You…said another name. Hael?”
He drinks greedily, the cool water soothing his dry throat.
“Cas, you promised to stop spending money on me like this. You’ve already bought me an entire wardrobe and fixed my car. I don’t pay for rent or hydro or even pitch in for the Netflix account that I made you get in the first place.”
When Dean stares into his mug instead of answering Castiel places a hand on his knee. “Think on it. Pick something we wouldn’t otherwise say during a scene. Something you won’t forget.”
“I have a job now; I’ll be able to pay you back in a week or…”
“What, did you think an old man like me couldn’t pick you up?”
Castiel raises an eyebrow at him. They stare at each other for a long moment, Dean pinned by Castiel’s gaze until he finally blinks and sighs.
Dean frowns at him. Castiel is his boyfriend; he’s allowed to be concerned.
“So you mostly feel anxious when you have nothing to keep your mind occupied.”
Dean grimaces as memories of last night swirl through his mind. He wishes he had amnesia. He pushes the memories away and continues with the list. “Dizziness or seeing stars. Fatigue.”
DEAN: Then leave the meeting.
“Right,” Dean mumbles. He still hasn’t told Castiel that he isn’t dancing tonight and the thought of Castiel being here, witnessing what’s to come, sends a mix of emotions through him that he doesn’t necessarily want to evaluate right now. So instead he orders a whiskey and tells the bartender to keep them coming.
Castiel closes his eyes and tries to push past the pain he feels shooting through his head, jaw, neck…pretty much every inch above his shoulders. “You might have a concussion, you’ll probably want—”
These two have a lot to discuss: kinks to negotiate, rules and limits to set, and of course blow jobs to give.
“Says who?”
The reply chimes immediately:
“Yeah, uh, you have a really nice voice.” He blushes as he says it, but the look on Castiel’s face is worth it: surprise at first, then masked quickly by a smirk and the unmistakable look of arousal shot in Dean’s direction.
Castiel tilts his head unconsciously, uncertain of the source of admiration in Dean’s voice, or the haunting look in his eye. “Of course, Dean.”
He had been too nervous to eat breakfast this morning and now his stomach is rumbling. There’s a coffee shop on the way home and Dean decides to treat himself. He feels a little guilty as he opens the door, the little bell tinkling to announce his arrival. Castiel gave him some cash and Dean finally relented and took the money, swearing to himself he wouldn’t use it. He hated relying on Castiel for money. Hence the job search.
At a quarter past five Dean is finishing setting the table, adjusting the utensils until everything is just right. He dims the light above the table and smiles at his work. Two heaping plates of spaghetti sit across from each other, complete with two glasses of wine that Dean found in a cupboard above the fridge. It isn’t his greatest creation, but he did the best with what he had to work with. He’s sure Castiel will appreciate the thought at the very least.
Dean tries to kiss back, but his jaw is tired so he just lets Castiel slip his tongue in, licking along the roof of his mouth.
“You think he texted you that as a way to manipulate you into agreeing to his new rule?”
Dean pushes himself to take more and more of Castiel into his mouth, stopping only just before his gag reflex kicks in. He picks up the pace and uses one hand to stroke what he can’t fit in his mouth and the other to play with Castiel’s balls.
Dean shoots him a half-smile of appreciation.
“Big family.” Dean follows Castiel further into the house.
Dean shifts, sitting up slowly and feeling like he’s going to throw up as he rights himself and kneels on the edge of the bed, looking up at Alastair. “Master?”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Makes sense,” Dean says, staring into his drink thoughtfully, “I’m still gonna drink this, though. Plus, I’m not scening with Alastair tonight. I only came here to break it off with him publicly where he can’t…make a scene.” He twirls the whiskey in his glass before lifting it off the bar. “Liquid courage.” He tips his glass in salute before tilting it back and feeling the alcohol burn a trail down his throat, warming him from the inside. He sets the glass back on the bar-top with a dull
Castiel pushes against Dean’s shoulders, trying to break the kiss. “You don’t need to—” he starts, but Dean drives his tongue into Castiel’s open mouth to silence him.
They had sat in the waiting room of the walk-in clinic for nearly an hour, Dean’s nerves ramping up each passing minute. He spent the hour staring at the empty doorway that lead to the hall of examination rooms, jumping every time the nurse appeared to call the next patient.
“The first is that I do not tolerate lying. At all. It’s impossible to have trust in a relationship with lies. And a lie by omission is still a lie.”
“I don’t want to talk about this. I know it’s not fair to call you like I did and not give you anything in return other than my whining, and my stubbornness, and I’m sorry, but I don’t want to think about Alastair right now.”
Castiel steps back, but Dean just follows, slipping off the bed to his feet. “Dean,” Castiel groans, “We need to talk first, before we go any further. I’ve been meaning to bring it up, but work’s been keeping me busy.”
The anxiety that had been bubbling inside Dean eases away as he grates cheese over a layer of chips. Castiel loads on the chili and they add a few banana peppers and some green onion, then stick the heaping pan of nachos into the oven.
It feels like it’s been forever since they’ve had sex and Dean worries that Castiel is growing bored with him. He would even be fine with plain old missionary sex; he just needs the reassurance of Castiel’s touch.
ended up in the trash as soon as he turned his back.
After they’re done and the dishes are put in the dishwasher Dean asks Castiel if he has a computer. Castiel produces a bulky laptop that splutters to life with loud whirring noises. Once it finally loads up Dean clicks the browser icon and makes a mental note to install an anti-virus program and clean out the laptop.
“I don’t believe I saw face fucking on your list of limits,” Castiel says in a voice just a touch lower than his normal tone, but still much too composed for Dean’s liking, “If you don’t stop teasing we may be trying that one out sooner rather than later.”
Dean throws open the ugly paisley curtains to let some light in. He blinks at the sudden brightness and peers down at the city streets below, watching the traffic and the cluster of people strolling down the sidewalk. He can’t remember the last time he went for a walk.
“You gonna come for me, Dean?” Castiel’s fingers tweak Dean’s nipple harshly while his other hand trails light, soothing touches down his chest, the pain perfectly contrasting the pleasure.
He doesn’t want to mess this up.
But what if that was only to get Dean to trust him so Castiel could kidnap him and keep him locked in his sex dungeon basement, torturing Dean before finally killing him. Except the easiest time to kidnap him would’ve been last night when he was completely out of it. He actually laughs out loud at himself.
Dean comes up behind Castiel and places the mug on the desk. He wraps his arms around Castiel and leans down to kiss along his neck.
“So Meg thinks I’m only dating you to steal your money or because, what? I feel like I owe you something?”
He brings the rope back around to Dean’s front and draws the length of it through the ties running down his chest. Castiel’s fingers brush against Dean’s skin as he weaves the rope over and under itself, wrapping snugly around Dean’s body.
Alastair is quiet when he emerges from the bathroom, but Dean hears the door swing open and stills, barely breathing. He listens to Alastair’s feet pad over to him and tenses when his body leans in close. But he only releases the handcuffs around Dean’s wrists before moving down and freeing Dean’s ankles as well. Even after the restraints are gone Dean lies still, waiting, listening.
Dean can’t help the frown that crosses his face. He’s notoriously bad with rules…more specifically: breaking them. “Uh, okay, what are they?”
Despite the thoughts racing through his mind, sleep came to Dean quickly after his bath. The warm water had soothed his aching body and afterwards Castiel had shown him to the guest bedroom before excusing himself to get ready for bed himself. The night had taken a lot out of both of them.
“How many shots of espresso do you have to drink every day to go that fast?” Dean asks when he gets up to the counter.
Castiel watches as Dean digs in, slurping long noodles of spaghetti into his mouth without pause. “When was the last time you ate?”
Castiel shrugs. “It’s not what I pictured your home looking like. There aren’t very many personal touches. It looks…unlived in.”
Dean rolls his shoulders and sighs, letting some of the tension fall from his position and resting his butt on his heels.
“Tell me you’re good.”
CAS: Be a good boy for me and when I get home I’ll lick you open nice and slow until you come on my tongue alone and then I’ll take that blue vibrator you love and find every sensitive spot on your body until I wring another orgasm from you.
“But you’ve had these feelings of anxiety before, correct?”
Suddenly it’s just Dean and Meg left at the table. Dean feels her eyes on him as he collects the chips from his winning hand. Meg hasn’t been unfriendly, exactly, but he still gets the feeling that she doesn’t like him very much.
“For what?”
His palms start sweating, but he’s shocked to find himself aroused, not afraid. In the face of Alastair’s punishments Dean always felt a pit in his stomach, scared that once again Alastair would take things too far. But Dean trusts Castiel. He trusts that Castiel would never do anything that would put either of them in jeopardy.
He finds Castiel rushing around the living room gathering his papers and stuffing them into his briefcase.
“Your hair’s short,” Dean says, staring up at Charlie dumbly as if she were a completely different person.
He inspects the lock of the door closest to him and is appalled to find that it’s not even a deadbolt: it’s only a knob lock. All he’d need to do would be stick a fingernail or something in the little slit in the doorknob and twist until it unlocked.  How this club has managed to stay open is a mystery to Castiel, but at this point he doesn’t really care: once he gets Dean out of here he’s never setting foot in the place again.
“Yeah, but—”
“We eloped last year. Her parents were pissed, but we didn’t want a big wedding or anything like that.”
“You have no idea how amazing you are.” Castiel says it so quietly that Dean wonders if maybe he wasn’t meant to hear it.
“Thank God; I’m starving!” Dean calls back.
Dean wants so badly to say “you,” but he restrains himself and instead tells Castiel to order whatever he wants before handing over one of the mugs. He plans on revisiting the topic of Castiel spending so much money on him, but that can wait; he just wants to get this talk over with as soon as possible.
DEAN:
Castiel pulls a condom down Dean’s length. “Be sure to tell me when you’re close.”
“Cas,” Dean moans as he spills his release into his palm, his breath catching.
The lights are dim and the music isn’t overly loud, creating an intimate atmosphere in the room. Thursday nights aren’t usually too busy, the weekend still too far away to draw in a big crowd, but they do set up a few performances every week to bring in more business.
Dean feels himself relax as he picks up his own beer and washes away some of his anxiety.
Dean bites his lip as he looks into Castiel’s eyes, remaining silent.
“Oh that’s right,” Castiel muses from where he kneels behind Dean, “I also said I was going to drive you beyond begging, beyond words.”
“Have we decided what we’re getting?” The waiter asks.
There’s a lot of time for Castiel to change his mind while they discuss these things. He could realize that Dean isn’t up to his standards and call it off.
“Jesus. So, what, she in jail now?”
“Fuck, Dean.” Castiel’s hips thrust up and Dean backs off, mouth just shy of touching Castiel’s heated flesh.
“So, you like to bake?” Castiel leans against the counter opposite Dean.
Dean stares at him a moment, then they both burst into laughter.
Years ago, when Alastair first found Dean, they had done scenes nearly every day. Training, as Alastair had called it, but lately the only time they see each other is Saturday nights. Dean’s glad, mostly, because he hates what Alastair does to him: the things he makes him do and the days of self-loathing that follows each encounter. But he knows that he’s failed his Dom, failed as a submissive if Alastair won’t even use him anymore, and that’s somehow worse. Without Alastair, he’s truly alone. But tonight is Dean’s chance to redeem himself.
In the movie, Johnny presses Baby’s hand to his chest and together they feel his heartbeat. Dean gasps quietly as soft fingers brush over his side, tracing patterns over the fabric of his shirt. He listens to Castiel’s heart beating steadily under his ear, feels the rhythm of each breath as he relaxes against Castiel.
“Say it,” Castiel whispers into his ear.
“Hi,” Dean breathes.
Dean’s eyes travel up to the inked bird on his ribs—a sparrow, he thinks—and farther up, above Castiel’s heart where there are weird-looking black symbols. How did he not know Castiel had tattoos? Dean wonders if he has any more hiding. His hand reaches out, unable to resist the need to touch.
“That’s the first place he’ll look. Besides, you said it yourself: he pays the rent. Do you really think he’ll continue to do so after tonight?” Castiel glances at Dean from the corner of his eye. His brow is furrowed in anger as he stares at Castiel. “He certainly isn’t done with you. He made that much abundantly clear. You can stay at my place until…You can stay with me.”
Dean loses sight of Castiel as the crowd closes around them and he wails pathetically, wriggling in Alastair’s grip.
Fuck, Dean thinks, they’ve barely started and he’s already messed up. He’s been wanting to show Castiel that despite what Alastair always said, he is a good submissive.
as promised this chapter is way less intense, just a good old fashion date
“Strip,” Alastair commands, plopping the ice back into his drink and stepping back, watching with a scowl as Dean complies obediently.
Usually, on days like this, Dean would hole up in bed and watch Netflix all day. Rub one out, have a nap, then watch some more Netflix. Although, the last four years that had more or less been his daily routine regardless of the weather.
Castiel shakes his head. “Just a little sore.”
Castiel suddenly slumps in the steady grip of the two men still holding him, and then immediately bucks, throwing his whole weight into as he breaks free of one surprised tower of a man. He uses the momentum to punch the man still holding him hard enough that he stumbles and loses his grip. Castiel vaults onto the stage.
“Tessa sent me home early,” Dean says without breaking position.
It takes Castiel a full cup of coffee to be awake enough for conversation. He downs the entire mug so quickly that Dean’s sure his whole mouth must be burnt, but Castiel just pours himself more coffee and starts in on his omelette. He praises Dean’s cooking skills as he eats, something Dean will never get tired of.
Once they had actually gotten in to see the doctor the examination took no time at all. Dean’s nerves had been at a manageable level after talking with the doctor and being able to say that he had none of the symptoms that suggested he had any STI. And then the doctor mentioned how long it would take to get the results of the tests back.
“Cas?” Dean calls again a few minutes later. “Do you feel nauseous at all?” He looks down at the laptop screen. “Or did you vomit at all since last night?”
“You were there last night. You saw what happened. How could you still want me after that?”
“Four
Castiel is by the front door, waiting for him. Meg is nowhere to be seen and Dean hopes she’s already left.
“So, what d’ya say, Cas?” Dean asks. He leans in close to whisper his next words in Castiel’s ear, “Wanna be my Dom?” He flicks his tongue out to lick the shell of Castiel’s ear, pauses to nibble at the lobe when he groans.
“Dean, you—” Castiel stops, closes his eyes and exhales deeply. When he opens his eyes again Dean sees an ocean of emotion in his blue eyes. And Dean doesn’t think he’s ever seen eyes as intensely blue as Castiel’s. How had he not noticed before now? He gets swept up in it, unable to look away.
“So, what did you go to school for, Dean?”
“Besides, I happen to like your stubbornness.”
“At first I was undecided. I had no idea what I wanted to do with my life; I just knew I had to get a higher education. In my second year I settled on Philosophy, but changed it to Art History two months later when I realized that the jobs in that department haven’t been around since Aristotle, and changed it again after a professor went on an hour-long rant in one of the intro classes and I realized I didn’t want to end up like this bitter old man.
Castiel hushes him. “Almost done. You’re taking your punishment so well.”
“It’s happened before where I got overwhelmed during an intense scene. I didn’t know what to do, so I just stopped suddenly and cut the ropes binding my partner. She didn’t understand why I stopped and thought it was her fault. She went through a serious drop and so did I.”
Dean whimpers, unsure if he’s allowed to speak or not.
Maybe Castiel senses Dean’s reluctance, or maybe he just doesn’t care enough to ask further. Either way, Dean is glad when Castiel just nods.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Are you sure you’re all right?” Castiel places his hand on Dean’s arm.
With a warm plate of Chinese food in front of him and Castiel’s leg brushing against his back, Dean lets everything else just slip away. Maybe his relationship with Castiel won’t be as temporary as he first assumed.
Dean just kind of stares in awe at the man across from him for what’s probably longer than socially acceptable. He finally says, “Thanks,” ducking his head to avoid the piercing blue eyes.
The mug of tea Dean made for Castiel last night sits untouched on the desk. He dumps the contents down the kitchen sink and washes the few dirty dishes piled on the counter. He doesn’t stop there and soon the entire apartment—save for Castiel’s bedroom, because boundaries—is tidy and Dean is looking for something else to occupy his time other than watching TV.
It’s a struggle, but Dean manages to keep his eyes on Castiel, watching his face contort with pleasure as he fucks into Dean, still tight even after Castiel toyed with him for so long.
“Yeah? And what, exactly, would that be?” Dean tries to sound casual, unaffected, but he’s sure the hitch in his voice gives him away.
“None of what happened yesterday was your fault, Dean.”
His body cracks and complains when he rolls over in bed and his legs get tangled in the warm blankets. He stuffs his face in a pillow and lies unmoving, trying to ignore the aches that pulse through his body. Eventually, when his bladder is about to burst, he gets up and heads to the bathroom.
Still, Castiel hasn’t emerged from his bedroom.
Dean walks across the room and slides Castiel’s chair out from the desk, the wheels clacking loudly against the hardwood. “You’re gonna work yourself sick if you keep this up.”
Dean sits staring at his phone, mind wandering back to their date and replaying the heated kiss in the parking lot. His fingers hover over the keyboard as he debates with himself for the millionth time in three days.
“I thought you were bored with me. And then I couldn’t stop thinking about how I’d have to go back to Alastair if—”
He grabs the tea towel from where it hangs on the oven door and presses it against Castiel’s chest, sopping up some of the wetness, hoping to gain some leniency by cleaning up his mess. Dean’s vision blurs and all he can hear is the thump of own heartbeat in his ears.
“Well, I’m gonna have to keep wearing ‘em cause my funds are very limited and someone won’t let me go back to my place to grab any of my stuff.”
It’s Dean’s turn to blush when they’re approached by a saleswoman who asks if they need help finding anything. Castiel tells her what they’re looking for and suddenly Dean can’t make eye contact with her. But the entire time they’re in the store the woman helps them with sizing and styles and not once does Dean feel judged by her.
“’cause I lied.”
“Please,” Dean whines as he’s forced to look up at Castiel with tearful eyes.
“Change of plans.” Castiel bends down to spread the grains out a bit. “You are going to kneel here for five minutes.”
Dean looks up then and Castiel flashes him a small smile that makes the tightness in his chest loosen a bit. “Okay,” he agrees, but he still can’t shake the feeling that he’s messing everything up. Castiel is just being polite.
Twice more Castiel brings Dean to the brink of pleasure, each time Dean being sure to warn him of his impending orgasm, and each time Dean hoping it’ll be the time Castiel finally lets him come. He’s fulfilled his promise; Dean is incapable of forming coherent sentences or even thoughts.
“Come on, Cas,” Dean pleads, “We don’t have to do a scene or anything tonight, I just want to suck you.”
Castiel’s brow draws together as he watches Dean fidget in his seat, making the stool creak and swivel. “Would you like to get some fresh air?”
Leaning over, Castiel bites lightly along Dean’s neck. “No,” he whispers, “You will not be coming tonight. Consider it part of your punishment.”
“He said I could have time to think about whether or not we actually go through with this new rule, but he texted me today at lunchtime telling me he was having a panini and it made me realize I hadn’t eaten yet. It actually helped and when I texted Cas back it made me happy that I was making him happy even if it is something as small as eating a bowl of soup. But then I was thinking on the way over here that he said he would give me time to think about it all. Should I be mad?”
“I seriously doubt Alastair is the kind of man to give up so easily, so no, I still don’t think it’s safe to go back to your apartment.” Castiel comes to stand behind Dean at the counter, leaning over his shoulder and watching as Dean globs spoonfuls of honey into the two steaming mugs. “As for money: I’ll take care of it, don’t worry.”
Dean pushes the memories away and readjusts himself on the couch to get comfortable before going back to the list. Mummification, single-tail whips, and watersports also go in the hard limit section.
Dean mirrors Castiel’s shrug in answer and leads him to the kitchen so he can take the bread out of the oven before it burns. “Just have to wait until this cools, then we can eat.”
“God, yes!” Dean cries. Overwhelming pleasure crashes down on him as his orgasm begins to crest.
Every time Dean’s body tenses Castiel pauses his ministrations until he relaxes again. After a few minutes, the cloth withdraws and Castiel tells him he’s going to apply the ointment. He waits for Dean’s nod of approval before dipping his fingers into the jar and gathering the cool substance on his fingers.
Teeth and tongue scrape over Dean’s nipple one last time before Castiel moves his assault lower, dragging his mouth down Dean’s stomach. He picks up the speed of his hand the lower he moves until his fist is flying over Dean’s aching dick in a flurry of motion, using the precome leaking from the tip to slick the way.
Their shared guilty pleasure of reading bad romance books was how they became friends in the first place. After complaining about flimsy plotlines and how cheesy and unrealistic the writing was in their respective stories, Dean and Charlie swapped books and numbers, becoming fast friends.
The man’s deep voice washes over him. He thinks this is what people mean when they say “dripping with authority.” He gulps and shifts in his seat to return the stare of the man. “Can’t help but notice that you don’t exactly look like you belong here.”
“And in case I haven’t made myself clear,” Castiel murmurs as they separate, his eyes tracking the movement as Dean’s tongue darts out to lick his lips, “I still want this, still want you. Nothing that happened last night has changed anything.”
“I would very much like to be your Dom…If that’s what you want.”
“I—he—just—” Dean’s brain is a jumbled mess and he’s not even sure what he called Castiel for.
Instead of answering, Dean grunts and buries his head in Castiel’s lap. He doesn’t want to leave the comfort of Castiel’s warmth and face reality. Not yet.
“I have been wanting your dick in my mouth since the first time we met, so excuse me for being impatient.”
His voice crackles over the shitty speaker, but it still manages to make Dean’s knees weak.  “Hey, Cas. C’mon up.” He lets Castiel into the building, then does a quick once over of the spotless apartment.
“Dean.”
Dean thought he would finally get what he’s been craving, but this isn’t at all what he wants. He looks down at the little circle of rice on the floor, then back up at Castiel. Instead of moving, Dean stands still, holding his ground.
That’s still too long. Dean knows he’s going to be stressing about it until he actually gets the results in his hands. “Well, still,” he grumbles as they reach Castiel’s gas-efficient hybrid that Sam would no doubt drool over if he ever laid eyes on it.
“Tempting.” Dean mouths along the side of Castiel’s length. He runs his tongue up and down the shaft once more before finally,
“I haven’t seen either of them.”
“Do you like it?”
He jumps when he feels rough rope circle around his wrist. Alastair wraps it around his arms until the knots bite into Dean’s skin uncomfortably. He flexes his bound hands and finds no slack. It used to make him feel secure, the ropes encasing him so thoroughly that he had no choice but to relax into their embrace. Now it only heightens his anxiety. He’s completely at Alastair’s mercy, helpless to do anything to stop it. More rope winds up his arms and is tied off tightly.
“What do you mean?”
“I’m sorry. I wish I could’ve stayed home today, but things at work are crazy right now. I’m surprised they let me leave on time, actually.”
Dean wallows in self-pity for the way he treated Castiel. It’s time for his weekly performance with Alastair at the club and Dean’s nerves are through the roof.
Yet here Dean is baulking when Castiel tries to give him a chaste kiss goodbye after a date. But it’s something lovers do, something far too intimate in Dean’s mind. It’s something that means commitment. In the four years he’s been with Alastair they’ve never shared a kiss, not even a peck on the cheek.
“What, now you’re like my babysitter?”
“Uh, was that a yes?”
“That’s okay. This is why we have to talk before we do anything. The most important thing in any relationship is communication. Maybe even more so in a Dom/sub relationship.”
Does he really love Castiel? Sure, he feels extremely close to him, but love? Is that what he’s feeling now? He’s not sure they’ve known each other long enough to be in love. Though Dean thinks about how his dad used to talk about how he knew he loved his mom the moment they met, so he supposes it happens.
“Garth, this is Dean,” Castiel says as he disentangles himself from the gangly man. “Dean, Garth.”
Dean throws his hands in the air. “Fine. I want you to fuck me into next week. I want all the soft touches but I want to hurt, too. I want all of it. Everything. I want you to do all the things you promised. I want you to bind me with rope and make me crazy with need until I can’t think anymore.”
It feels like his hole is gaping after Castiel opened him up for so long and Dean shifts uncomfortably, aware of Castiel still kneeling behind him.
Dean feels cold and empty as he watches Castiel’s tan trench coat swish around him as he walks to his car. It feels like a final goodbye, and he’s suddenly worried he’ll never see Castiel again.
“Castiel,” Dean groans. Now that he’s coming down he feels a chill in the air, even in the crowded club, and he shivers. “I know what Alastair’s like. I know what he’s capable of doing, but I was already broken before he found me, probably been broken my whole life. And I don’t know any Dom that wants to put up with a sub’s giant sack of emotional baggage, and no one’s gonna want me now. Alastair definitely isn’t the best Dom, but there are worse out there than him.” And it’s better than being alone.
