Mycroft sighed. “Sherlock, I don’t know what you think I do, but I’m a Junior Executive in the Civil Service. I don’t work for MI6. I can’t just make people
‘Cases’ were what Sherlock did with his days when he wasn’t in Uni for his post-grad MSc. It looked to John a lot like running about with Greg Lestrade, but it brought in money and made Sherlock happy, even if he poo-poo’ed John’s suggestion that he should join the police force for real.
“Fuck,” Sherlock gasped, his hips twitching. “John…”
He considered deleting the message, but closed it, instead. He’d seen John tomorrow, and that would be fine. Painful, but fine.
“So they tell me.” He sniffed. “I have a cold, today.”
Sherlock huffed out a breath, raising his hips as John pushed his trousers down, leaving his black boxer-briefs on, for now.
“I’d rather not drain them to the point they can’t be saved,” he replied. “Not if they don’t deserve it.”
The mattress dipped with weight pressed onto it.
Victor looked surprised, but shrugged as he gathered his things up.
“I might hurt –”
John let out a shaky breath. “That… that’s the most beautiful thing I’ve ever heard,” he looked so sad Sherlock almost panicked before John grabbed his head and kissed him deeply, tongue sweeping through his mouth, bare chests together in post-coital thrumming heartbeats and sticky skins. Sherlock tasted salt and sweat and alpha lust and he wanted to sink into a river of this feeling, and drown.
“I wasn’t going to say that!”
They were sitting close together, working on something. They were older, at Uni maybe, going through great big textbooks.
an alternative to university!”
“I know it,” Sherlock turned his collar up. “Are you coming?”
John cleared his throat. “You might end up smelling of me, that’d be embarrassing for you.”
“I’m sorry,” Sherlock went red.
“Did he hurt you?”
Sherlock smiled back, shifting his hips back and forth, just to try and take some of the pressure off.
Sherlock made it happen. And Cam had forgiven him.
Closing the wound, John realised dully.
“So, if you needed something from an omega..?”
“Please, John. I… I don’t want to stop this, but…”
Sherlock's POV
The girl – the Sherlock girl – stared back at him, smiling happily.
John was too embarrassed to text Sherlock, or Mycroft. At least, right away.
Sherlock spat, and rinsed his mouth out. He looked at himself again.
“You’re not wrong, though,” John forced out, putting his head to one side as Sherlock scented at his throat. Pleasure warmed through his body, despite the hurt. John had to wonder how someone could feel so many emotions at once without shattering.
Sherlock stepped away from the doorway. Something had happened.
“May I take this?” he asked. “I want to show my brother. This is the most wonderful thing I have ever seen.” He held the book out over the water to make his meaning clear.
"Sherlock. And I'll call you John."
Sherlock didn’t resist, or cry out, but his eyes flew open in apparent shock. “Is – that – it?”
“Hello,” a handsome boy with brown skin and wavy black hair beamed at him. “Is Sherlock in, please?”
Sherlock looked confused. “But… why would anyone…”
…maybe his dad was right.
John made it to the clinic with fifteen seconds to spare. Only to be sat waiting for another twenty minutes as the appointments were running late.
No – he might wake up.
‘That you were asking for it,’ Mycroft sighed. He rubbed his temples. ‘This isn’t right. You cannot possibly think of proposing to that man. He’s wanted you since you were in nappies, Sherlock. He kissed you without you wanting it, no matter what the circumstances might have been. He’s kept you in his debt through gifts and schooling and promises – you don’t owe him anything, do you understand me?’
“No, it’s natural,” Mycroft put his cup and saucer down. “It’s a protective instinct, to look after yourself.  It’s safer for you, as an omega, to belong to someone – to have their assumed protection. You no longer live with your parents, so you have to attach to someone. And since you no longer live with Victor –”
“Before?” Sherlock peeped through his fingers.
John sighed. “Sherlock…”
“Because of the size of the uterus,” another student interrupted. “It’s large, for multiple births.”
Sherlock laughed, and took his phone out, signalling his participation in the meal was over. John was tempted to nag him again, but thought better of it. Sherlock clearly had an issue with food, but now wasn’t the time to start giving him a lecture.
It was a deep, languid kiss that continued as Sherlock lowered John onto the bed, still supporting his weight so John was entirely in his hands. John moaned as Sherlock worked his mouth open, tongue slipping inside with a firmness that was dominating enough to make John’s hands grip tight onto Sherlock’s sleeves. He moaned again as Sherlock tasted him, possessing John’s mouth as John wanted - needed – him to possess the rest of him. John dropped his jaw further, and Sherlock’s teeth scraped against his lower lip.
“It scares me, ok?” Sherlock picked up another biscuit. “What happened today… I don’t want that. I never thought I was going to end up like that. Like this.”
It was understandable, and utterly sorrowful.
‘I, er, didn’t know it was you,’ John said honestly. ‘I just wanted to help whoever it was.’
“I’m not so fed up of hearing it as I am upset that you don’t
“Yes, and the crowds will be gathering already,” Mycroft said. “We’re not standing all day to watch the London Eye be lit up by posh lightbulbs.”
“Nothing that’ll hurt either of you,” Sherlock said, and John frowned at the slightest of stresses on the word
His casual smile dropped immediately, the scars on the one side dragging down, as though he was melting, until he caught himself, and put the smile back on.
John screamed at him, mentally.
When the holidays rolled around, his father came to collect him.
Sherlock slumped into the seat, vibrating with anger.
“Indeed,” Sherlock pulled his sleeve down.
Greg shook his head. “Right. Give me a call if you decide you want something other than a bonding bite, sometime.” And he stalked off past the kitchen doors, John smelling the disappointment radiating off him in waves.
“Why?”
“A soldier?” Sherlock’s father looked interested for the first time. “Why did you retire?”
Sherlock came again, near-dry as a few splatters of come hit the bedsheets, his entrance contracting around John’s cock so he could no longer get his knot out. John changed his thrust, moving shallowly, yet still as hard, rubbing Sherlock’s g-spot from the side even as he squeezed and milked every drop from his spent cock.
“I can’t do this,” Sherlock puffed out a breath. “I… I didn’t know you were coming back, I – I’ve had sex with you, I…”
This was not a court. Courts were for important matters, not alpha / omega disputes like this, but there was a desk ready to receive the judge that would make the decision. In front of this desk were two others, spaced apart, facing the judge. John and Miss Ali sat at one. Mayhew and his solicitor, Miss Kogen, sat at the other. To one side was a school-like desk where the clerk was sitting at a typing machine, ready to take notes. There were six seats at the rear of the room which served as a viewing area. Sherlock had taken one of the seats. Two of the others were occupied by an elderly alpha / omega couple, whom Sherlock deduced to be Mayhew’s parents. This, too, was infuriating. A man like that shouldn’t have frail-looking elderly parents. He shouldn’t have family invested in this outcome.
John x
Sherlock thought, as John went down the stairs.
‘That’s different,’ Sherlock said sharply. ‘And if you’re asking about the Father space on it, he left it blank. The registrar wasn’t happy about it, she made it quite clear she thought he was a bad person.’
John twisted to see him, and gawped at the sight of Sherlock – alpha Sherlock – wiping his eyes, and red in the face. “Are - are you serious?”
“You’re not mature,” Sherlock said. “Neither am I… this is stupid!”
John tidied his book away as Sherlock pulled a pyjama top on, then decided to speak. “Your bump’s pretty low, Sherlock.”
“Yes,” Siger said. “Some young girls look a fright.”
“No, but I don’t care,” John said again. “I just want them born healthy.”
“I mean…very not well.”
Sherlock looked up at last. “Is there any reason you’re taking so much interest in my personal life, Mycroft?”
“Shut up,” Sherlock gave John’s hair a pull, then gasped, kneels buckling slightly as John took him into his mouth. Alphas did not, as a rule, give head to their omegas – it was a submissive gesture that was generally only seen in fetish porn. But John loved doing it, loved hearing Sherlock’s moans, feeling the tentative thrusts into his mouth, though Sherlock’s erection was too small to ever slide down his throat, it wasn’t for the want of trying.
“Euck,” John made a grossed-out noise. He leaned, and Sherlock gently pulled out of him, the two of them wincing at the sensation, and the sudden dampness of the bedsheets. “Sorry.”
“He forced me into a heat,” Sherlock whispered. “And every time I’ve thought about being pregnant, I mean the mechanics of it, I can’t ignore the fact it was his bite that matured my egg. He started her,” he put his hands on his belly. “It makes me feel awful.”
“But I meant…
John grit his teeth, and raised eyes he didn’t realise had been focussed on the table. “No,” he said aloud, the effort making him break into a sweat. “No, Eurus. That is not what happened. That… is not my fault. Your dad, and you… you filled my head with so much shit that it’s still festering. Well, you’re not adding to it. I came to say that I want to try and forgive you, that I understand what Siger did to the both of us, and I know you had it worse. But I don’t know if you want me to try and forgive you. I don’t know what you want, but this isn’t something I can give you.”
“But he would be the only boy.”
“Well, it was pretty clear you weren’t coming back to me,” Victor said. It would have been a snap, if he hadn’t looked, and sounded, so exhausted. His longish hair was loose, instead of back in a bun, and his stubble was more like a full beard than anything else.
“Sherlock?” he mouthed.
John gave it up. “Alright. Let’s go.”
John considered. “He can be kind. He plays the violin. He’s tall… and handsome, I guess.”
Miss Ali patted both of their shoulders. “Go home,” she said. “Go home, and be normal. It’s over. You’ve got each other. All three of you have.”
John fixated on Sherlock’s words.
In the video, Sherlock ran a hand down his own body, and pulled the bathing suit from his backside, fingers fumbling at the wet material for a second.
It didn’t stop him being able to speak, though.
John hummed. “It’s… interesting,” he said. “Sherlock and I… we’re sort of trying, you know? To be a couple. We’re both shit at it.”
John smiled widely. “We could even do it again, if you wanted.”
But a louder growl, a real alpha snarl complete with throat and fangs rumbled through the crowd. The people parted like the Red Sea, except for the man holding onto Sherlock’s arm, who turned to see what was barrelling towards him.
“You can’t.”
“It seems a good use of my time,” Sherlock said to the carpet.
“You sure you feel ok?” John asked, giving him a final sniff as he picked his schoolbag up.
Sherlock smiled.
“Yes, well, people to tend to accumulate things…” the alpha touched a pile of letters on the mantle. There was a knife sticking out of them.
Sherlock turned, holding in two hands, a violin of polished and gleaming wood. He looked as though someone had hit him in the face with a brick. “Thank you,” he managed, eyes still on the instrument.
John picked up his tray, and rolled his eyes. Someone tapped his shoulder as he walked along the self-service hatches.
‘Not all alphas are like that.’
And so was John, Sherlock could tell he was. John hung his coat up and inhaled steadily, clearly taking in the scent of Sherlock, who was fiddling with his fingers, standing still, waiting for instruction. John could have said ‘jump’ and he’d’ve said ‘how high’.
“I wouldn’t, if I were you.”
“Just lay back, John.” Sherlock kissed the flush pink glans before suckling gently at it, pushing John’s foreskin down with his tongue and lips, mimicking soft penetration that made John moan, before taking him further into his mouth.
“They’d forgive me,” Sherlock said.
John swallowed hard. “You don’t want this, do you?”
“Without focussing too much on the word
“Molly, sir?”
“And you don’t think you need to know that? This is a forensic science degree, Sherlock. There’s no knowledge that isn’t worth gaining.”
But now he was John’s, and he didn’t know how to deal with it.
Mycroft got up, swiping for the bat and missing. “You’re mine!”
The vampire - his eyes so deep a red they looked black - climbed up again, and effortlessly pulled John's legs over his own pale shoulders, yanking him forward to swiftly impale the soldier on his slicked-up and impressively large cock in a single thrust.
John fought off a wince. He didn’t let anyone touch his bump. “Um.”
"It's just a house," Sherlock rolled his eyes.
“And what else can we see from this individual’s
“The opposing legal team may make the case that Birdie needs a traditional family set-up. Are you bonded or married?”
Mycroft folded his arms. "As I said, this is entirely stupid."
“That’s correct, madam,” John said, his voice not exactly strong, but sure.
“Yes.”
“When?”
“Ha,” Sherlock nipped at his chin. “You’d best get up, then.”
“Then I would buy you another.”
Sherlock checked his watch. “That went fast.”
It was a slow, hesitant, love-making, that was more fumbling than any of their touches so far. John and Sherlock were so young, so teenage, so fragile, that they had to stop, every so often, to kiss, and speak, and reassure, that everything was ok.
“John?” he asked, softly.
“You said I should put training to be a doctor over
“Do you want painkillers?”
“Fuck,” John said, and Sherlock gasped.
John chewed the inside of his mouth, thinking. Sherlock could be having a wash, or a cry, or anything. He didn’t need a pushy alpha mothering him as he tried to wash.
“You’ll never win an argument against a hormonal omega,” Greg folded his arms. “He’ll be grand, though. I bet he’s reading all the books.”
“Uh…” he knelt up as he flushed it, wincing and dragging himself up to the sink to wash his mouth out. “Guess that’s just the start…” He swished mouthwash around his mouth, and spat. His stomach cramped again, but he wasn’t sick.
Except his Victor.
. Sherlock wanted to kick himself at that thought. He wasn’t supposed to want anyone at all, but when John kissed him it sent tingles all down and through his body, and his heart had pounded and he had wanted to press himself so close to the other boy that they would squash into one another and just…
Surely, it was a matter of time before they were back in Baker Street together, turning the spare upstairs room into a nursery, planning their first family holiday, baby-proofing the cupboards…
“Hello?” Victor’s face appeared in the gap between the door and the wall. Then he opened it wider, recognising John. “Oh… hello, again.”
"You're taunting me," Sherlock groaned, pressing his lips to John's vein, scraping his teeth over it.
Violet Holmes didn’t seem to know what to do with her arms. She kept folding them, then dropping them so not to appear aggressive to the beta woman, and then folding them again. “It’s just… Sherlock and John are… well, they’re not…”
“Where did you even meet this alpha woman?”
Sherlock’s violin.
But then he met John’s eyes.
what he had just done. Just tried to – to get John to be sexual with him. He had instigated it! Omegas never – they should never – oh
“Oh my god…” John picked up the test, and cradled it in his hands. “What does that mean?” He fished out his phone, and did a quick search:
“It still won’t be easy.” Sherlock straightened his scarf. “I’m going after him. I’m going to bring him home.”
John walked out, at a normal pace, trying to stay calm as he passed the alpha, until he got out of the kitchen door.
“I can’t wait for that to be real,” Sherlock said, as they walked arm in arm through the high-street. “That was… I can’t describe it.”
Sherlock didn’t notice, wandering over to the fridge for juice, but Mycroft did. He gave John a hard look.
The confusion vanished after a moment, and the student took his seat. He wasn’t sitting with anyone.
Sherlock flinched, and turned. “Cam.”
“It’s… uh,” Sherlock put a hand over his eyes. “It’s nothing
“Uh…” John closed his eyes and leaned into the touch, suddenly feeling cold and shaky. “Thought morning sickness was over…”
“It’s all that really matters, now,” Sherlock said. “The work.”
Sherlock unlocked the door, and John stepped in, inhaling the air, catching a beta scent, and cold air. Unlived in.
“What have I…” Sherlock stopped.
“And he. Sent. The silver?”
“John, please… it – I want to bond with you, please –”
“Yeah?” John sniffed. “You really want to?”
“Of course,” Mycroft pretended not to notice. “If he wants to be –”
John’s fingers slid, slick with lubricant, between the folds of Sherlock, bringing his cock hard, making him shudder and twitch his hips when John’s fingers dipped inside him, tracing the shape of his entrance, the pleasure to be found either side on the smooth flesh, where damp hair curled and stuck, and welcomed.
The card had arrived a few days later, along with a parcel of simple baby vests.
Sherlock didn’t answer, but he smiled as he forked up his first mouthful of egg fried rice.
Living with an alpha wasn’t a smart idea. But if it was that or homelessness, John would take it. It was only for a few weeks, after all.
A week rolled by.
“Sometimes, no,” Sherlock said as their kisses resumed. “Is that bad?”
Sherlock, on the other hand, had carried John into the kitchen, and sat him down on a chair before kneeling in front of him.
“I do!” John reached for his hands, but Sherlock put them behind his back. “Sherlock, I do like you. A lot. I’m just saying I don’t want you feeling me up in a corridor, alright?” He was feeling increasingly irritated, though he couldn’t say why. “I wouldn’t force
“Ha, sounds like it. Well, yeah, I’m in hostel. But I have a few flat viewings lined up.”
“He should have gone there, anyway,” John said, rudely. “Why’s he even hanging around? Oh, wait, I know, because he still wants to fuck you.”
“What about you, Mr Magnussen?” Mycroft asked. “What sort of background do you have?”
John forced a laugh. “How’re you keeping, then? You still at your parents’?”
“I want heat suppressants.”
“John,” Mycroft’s hands were on John’s knees. “John, look at me.”
“Christ…” Mycroft winced. “Sherry… when did this all start?”
“She’s on her centile line,” Sherlock pointed out.
"Sherlock --please --ah, just move. I need it--" John’s speech was punctuated by gasps for breath, the slap of skin.
John pretended not to notice. “Now, Sherlock, did you want to get settled? If Mycroft brings your bag up, you can make this place feel a bit nicer?”
“Tonight?”
“I can see why he thinks that,” John sighed.
“Well, we weren’t, but we’ve been asked.”
John’s toast popped up, and he grabbed it, opening the butter pack to hide his disappointment.
He could feel his entire body, a hundred times more than usual.
Sherlock… He’d kissed John on the cheek, and put a caring hand to his abdomen as they parted, saying goodbye to both of his loves. It had made Joh’s heart sing.
“Book.” Sherlock struggled to turn a page, but managed it with one of his tentacles helping him. “Book…” He looked up. “More book?” He pointed towards where the shore was just out of sight.
‘A case? So, you were with Lestrade?’ John’s voice was layered with darkness and poison. Practiced.
“No.”
Stay tuned for the Epilogue, and thank you for all your support for this fic.
Sherlock trembled, and held the angel tight, fearing he would disappear at any moment. “I’m sorry, John.”
“He called me. Told me. I didn’t want to come,” Sherlock admitted, kicking off his shoes. “I thought… wouldn’t matter if…”
The man turned to him. In the bright outdoor sunlight, Sherlock could see the wrinkles of his face, the sparse nature of his grey-white hair, combed to look fuller. There were fingerprint-smears on the glass of his spectacles.
Sherlock didn’t know what to say. “…thank you.”
John read the email with a frown.
John gave a sad smile. Then gently brushed Sherlock’s curls with his fingers.
“I am. And you are?” Sherlock’s eyes flicked over the other alpha, assessing. John could almost hear his thoughts.
He turned off the bedside light and lay down, being the big spoon even though Sherlock was taller, wrapping an arm over his chest. He inhaled the scent at the healed site of his mate's bonding bite. "I love you."
“Waiting for your boyfriend?” Harry asked, plonking herself near his feet.
“Mycroft, pull over, would you?” Sherlock said, five minutes down the road.
He wasn’t coming back.
Her husband quickly took up the conversation. “My parents were always friends with Violet’s, that’s how we met. I remember Violet’s mother being the envy of society – he was always dressed to the nines. Violet has a lot of that jewellery, now.”
The cold air shocked the creature, and it thrashed all four of its arms as it gasped down air, choking on it, before coughing up something that looked like vile thick yellow ink that spread across the surface of the sea. Was it trying to repel Sherlock? Sherlock considered inking the thing straight back, then realised the walker was going limp again. The fluid was in reaction to fear, then. And exhaustion. Well, Sherlock could try and deal with that.
“Get a shower going for John,” Lestrade ordered him. “Now, Sherlock.”
“Ok…” Sherlock adjusted himself, and crossed his legs. “I’m sorry if I misunderstood –”
Sherlock nodded. Modern thoughts was omega-slang for
“You’re fast, you’ll get picked no problem. I’ve heard James say you’re fast.”
“I wasn’t there as a doctor, I was visiting, and what’s going on?”
“I know, but…” Sherlock took a deep breath, “I’m going to try. My hardest. If you… If you don’t want…”
Sherlock went over. His mother snapped a picture of him picking up the medium-sized gift. It seemed the safest place to start. He unwrapped it quickly, revealing a heavy leather vanity case. The lid lifted to reveal deep central compartment, and several palettes of makeup and brushes that neatly fanned out of the case on little hinges. It looked very expensive, but Sherlock didn’t wear makeup.
Sherlock’s face fell. “When did you go to this?”
“Why are you lot so bothered, anyway?” John moaned.
John would take a hundred shots to the shoulder before reliving this.
Sherlock’s jaw was very tense, and his shredding of the receipt had stopped.
Victor’s face lit up, and he reached out without hesitation to take the baby. He was obviously experienced with babies, tucking Lucy against himself in the crook of his elbow, putting a cushion under his own arm to stave off the dead-arm. “She’s so little.”
Far from it.
But there was no time for caution.
Sherlock lowered his cup. Every touch, although it sent electric pleasure through his skin, felt like cheating. He didn’t love John. He liked him well enough. Moreso, these days, because they were both doing what John called ‘trying’. And the trying was nice. The touches were nice. John was a mature alpha, who smelled like something Sherlock wanted to consume, and who was capable of taking care of him… but he wasn’t Victor. He didn’t have Victor’s lithe body, or brown skin, or deep, dark eyes. He was the alpha Sherlock needed. But wanted… that wasn’t quite on the cards, yet. Or was it? Sherlock knew he might die if the touches from John were to stop.
better
John cleared his throat. “So, are you going to ring him? Inspector Lestrade?”
Sherlock went into the bedroom, and John could hear him opening and closing drawers. Probably looking for the exact perfect pair of pyjamas to lounge about in. The bathroom door opened and closed again, and John rolled his eyes. Sherlock had to pee every fifteen minutes these days. A flush, and the groaning of the taps, and then the door opened and closed once more into the bedroom.
“Throwing up,” John admitted. “Usually first thing in the morning and last thing at night. Can’t stomach dairy, or fish, and I can’t even look at an egg.”
Rightly so, Sherlock thought. He turned, and made himself look his brother in the face. ‘Magnussen,’ he said.
“Sherlock’s been accepted!”
John stared at him. It felt as though several days passed. And then he said: “Maybe.”
“What – you trying to scrub away the omega?” she grinned, the fridge light illuminating her teeth. “It doesn’t work like that.”
“Dead,” John finished for him. “This is a mistake, Sherlock. I don’t want to be like this. I would rather be dead.”
Mycroft put his shoulders back. “Sherlock. Have you considered what you’re doing?”
Sherry winked at him, and he had to smirk back.
John and Sherlock were left alone.
Sherlock let out a low growl, that sent tingles of pleasure straight to John’s cock, making him blink and look away. “He has no right to look at you, at all.”
The boy almost smiled. “I like numbers. They make sense.” He capped and uncapped his fountain pen. He had very long fingers, though the nails were bitten down to the quick, and the skin around them looked sore and picked-at.
Sherlock looked up. “Honestly?”
Neither of them said anything.
“So, you… didn’t choose… him?” Sherlock frowned, looking at the marmalade.
Sherlock’s gaze faltered slightly at the word
Before someone, something, breaks the spell.
“Now?” Sherlock asked. He looked around at the expectant faces, and went red. “But…”
“So… what’re you doing next year?” Molly interrupted his thoughts.
John felt as if he was two people at once. The doctor who sort of remembered how to birth a baby, and the omega who had no fucking idea what he was doing. He reached a hand down whilst Sherlock was upstairs, and touched at his swollen body, trying to figure out how much time he had. His waters hadn’t burst, which would make this easier, but this was all too
“No, it’s better than that.”
“What is it?”
Sherlock blushed, and bit his lip, touching at his shorter (and mildly tamed) hair as he and John looked at each other, their eyes saying things their mouths could not.
Sherlock wanted to say yes. But he couldn’t lie. He took John’s hand. “Do not ask me to stand by and watch you die again,” he whispered. “I lost you. I lost you, John. My heart hasn’t beaten for centuries and it broke at losing you. I… please do not ask me to lose you again.”
A man walked around the nurse, and stood in the doorway. He gave a cautious sort of smile. His hair was shorter, and he looked tired, but…
Sherlock arched his back, and there was a moment of fumbling with their legs before the soft trousers were kicked off completely, and they were both naked, both looking at one another, both trembling with need.
“You nearly strangled the poor bloke,” John said, annoyed, as they walked home.
He swallowed hard, his appetite vanished.
“I was wondering if you wanted to…” Sherlock glanced at John’s crotch, “…have me?”
… “Look. At. ME.”
Sherlock blinked. “Bad?”
John nodded again.
“Hush, love,” John murmured. “Someone will hear.”
The baby gave a few kicks of alarm as its mother’s heartrate suddenly kicked into top gear.
“You’re brilliant, and stoic, and so… bloody… annoying,” John gave a small laugh. “And I like all of that about you. I’m glad I’ve met you. But I couldn’t be more pissed off about the circumstances.”
“No,” Victor said. “But then… I try not to think about it. My dad bonded with my mum and it wasn’t planned. I don’t know how I feel about that. And you’ve got John.”
John wasn’t surprised. "How?"
Sherlock took the seat opposite. “Are you going to reply?”
"Jesus," John couldn't look at him, his alpha instincts raising protectively, wanting to question the boy, make sure he was safe and well – not to have him in his flat like this. "Why... Why are you... here?"
He still wrote.
Sherlock was the only boy.
. And he was trying to leave him. Admittedly, for his own protection. Sherlock did not begrudge him that. But the human would never have begun to re-learn his fear of the vampire if that incident hadn’t taken place.
"I won’t hesitate for one moment. Thank you. John."
“Sherlock, you’re looking…” Lestrade looked him over. “Yeah.”
After a while, Mycroft came and sat beside John. He dried his face with a handkerchief before turning and speaking. ‘I owe you an apology, Doctor Watson.’
Sherlock sat up a bit, the colour coming back into his cheeks. “He asked if I wanted to try it. I said no, and he held me down.”
“Are you alright?” Sherlock turned his head to look John in the eye. There was a pink blush to his cheeks now, his eyes were brighter, and he looked the least dead John had ever seen him.
John gasped, raising his chest into the touch as he bit his lip. “Sh-”
“Oh, Sherlock,” John smiled, and for a moment something like a drop of warmth ran through Sherlock’s blood. “You’ve only just begun. You think you’ve done enough for this world? Sherlock Holmes, you’re going to do such wonders.”
“John, you’ve been through battle and hell and god knows what else. This… it’s just going to be something that happens. A day out of your life. And then you can forget it.”
“It is,” she countered. “I’m twenty-one, I still live with my parents, I’m unmated, and I don’t even have a betrothed. That’s weird. It’s what I have.”
“Mycroft said he hurt you.”
“Hey,” John smiled at him. “Guess who?”
“No,” Greg put his paper cup down, finally. “That’s not making the best. Making the best would be him taking care of you, and dropping that boyfriend of his, and –”
“The background checks I conduct are a step beyond those of even child protection,” Mycroft said.
"This is going to be interesting..." Sherlock laughed, clumping forward, pulling on fingerless gloves before stepping onto the rink. The familiar gliding feeling was easy to pick up, and Sherlock turned easily, watching John climb down, clinging to the rail with one hand.
Sherlock raised a hand. “Hang on – why are we now talking about Molly? You’re the one who’s upset.”
He shook his head.
"She's long dead," Sherlock said.
There was some shifting, some more lubricant, and a bumping kiss as Sherlock gripped the base of his hard cock, and John sank himself down onto it with a shuddering sigh.
John went into do Sherlock’s stats, and was amazed by the blanket of papers covering the young man’s legs. The gruesome photos were on the top, with various reports and statements beneath them.
He was so tired.
John grit his teeth. "That's... he thinks we've got some sort of dom-sub think going on. Which is just ridiculous. He hasn't the faintest idea what that should entail aside from watching bad porn. But you heard him. He thinks he owns me. He really fucking doesn't."
“She’s stable, at the moment,” the nurse was saying. “She did a bit of crying, earlier, but she’s asleep again, now. I think she misses her mummy.”
“…and then Sherlock said
Even without meaning to.
Even taking into account…
Sherlock smiled, just a pinch.
“Because it’s helped your sister so much..?”
Sherlock went into the kitchen, knocking over a chair, as he reached for the knife block, extracting a serrated one that looked like it was sharp enough.
James nodded. “I get it. So…
He wiped his eyes quickly, and stared.
Luckily, Sherlock moved quickly, and John could hear him stripping off in the bathroom, clattering around even as John threw himself into their bedroom, and started yanking his clothes off.
“What’s he like?”
A pair of scarlet eyes looked back at him.
“Good,” Sherlock pulled him down into a kiss, the duvet covers wedged between their lower halves as they snuggled together in a nest of love.
“I haven’t thought about him… in ages. I don’t even connect him with… anymore,” John said. “I mean, if anything it’s more like y…” he stopped at the flash of horror in Sherlock’s eyes. “It’s more like… yeah, I don’t know,” he finished pathetically.
“Not quite,” John winced.
Sherlock nodded. “I do, John. I do.”
“Mm, though like most parties Mummy threw, they were just an excuse for people ‘to impress’ to come through the doors.”
“Whyever not?”
“Sherlock’s parents have stopped you seeing one another,” his dad went on, “but, since I know you’re keen… did you want me to speak to them?”
“It seems likely. I haven’t asked. I’m just grateful to be here at all.”
“Ok, fine,” John zipped his jacket up. “You can get in touch if you want to know anything, or you can just sit staring into space, it’s entirely up to you. Victor… I’m really sorry.”
Then reached out, and took John's wrists in his gloved hands, pulling him forward. "Just glide. Move slowly, but surely."
Sherlock wasn’t looking at him. His eyes were on the floor, his face red, neck exposed so John could see it was unbitten, the skin unbroken. Unbonded.
A few people looked up as they passed - John wasn't the sort of guy to attract attention, normally, but Sherlock stuck out like a sore thumb. He wasn’t in uniform for a start, he was tall and dark and pale, and those red eyes almost seemed to glow. Although it wasn’t a that secret vampires existed, not anymore, they were still regarded as distinctly supernatural, and to be feared.
A hand clamped down on John’s shoulder, and he flinched, pushing the hand away. “Don’t touch me.” He could see there were three men in total, all alphas by the look and smell of them, all of them tall and ready to grab John if he tried to make a run for it.
“Looks ok to me,” he handed the photo back, and turned to start putting his shopping away. “What did Sherlock think?”
He woke up again a few times before the surgery that would install a ceramic plate onto his shoulder blade. He signed some things, his signature little more than a scrawl, and gave the details of his next of kin, and other people he wanted notifying about his injury.
“After
It could be a long night.
“Love? John doesn’t love me,” Sherlock snorted.
"Your glamour. He wouldn't fuck you while he's in his right mind?"
A brief knock, and Sherlock let them into the lounge, just as “I’ll be down in a sec,” came from the room above.
Sherlock pulled a face. “I think Mycroft… suspects.”
“Just confirm your name and age for me, sweetheart,” she said as the cuff began to tighten around Sherlock’s skeletal arm.
Sherlock stood as he looked up. The TV was silent, but the scrolling news went on.
“Yes… he’s sorry you didn’t consent, isn’t he?”
A few days later, they were in France.
Sherlock didn’t answer.
"Well, we can't all live off people's blood." John gave his food what Sherlock suspected was a deliberate stir. "Speaking of... How often do you eat? Or... feed, or whatever you call it.”
“I know, but…” Sherlock went red, “but I’m not your
But the biggest change came when school started again in January, and Sherlock went to a new school.
Sherlock gave a single nod.
Sherrinford sighed. “Ok, omega to omega… Heats are when you want to
, he had been about to say. He’d not thought about that man for weeks, concentrating on himself, his health, and Sherlock. The sudden invasion of the man into his mind made him feel sick. He swallowed hard.
Sherlock’s mother rubbed her arms in worry. “Sherlock, I’m sure we can come up with a -”
“You said only you smell me like that, though?”
“Please don’t,” John sat up, going red. “That’s… ok.”
Sherlock blushed, taking a deep breath, enjoying the fullness of his lungs, smiling at the message. John was thinking about him. About Chemistry, too, yes, but about him. Wondering what Sherlock was doing. That never got old. It felt fizzy and sparkling every time John text first.
Sherlock’s mouth snapped shut, and he glared before looking at the table-top.
“It should be fun, though,” she said. “There’s going to be a big bonfire on the field, and a band.”
He gripped the bedclothes.
“Back in a minute,” Sherlock shuffled off the sofa, and let himself out of the room to go to the bathroom.
Sebastian cocked his head to one side. “We could turn him, sir.”
John laughed nervously. “What do you mean?”
“But it’s too soon.”
“Even this?” Mycroft asked.
John would have suspected her of being a vampire herself if it weren’t for her very blue eyes.
“…yes.”
John pulled back, and pushed forward again, and this time it was easier, Sherlock exhaling as he was penetrated, his body pliant around John’s hardness.
Sherlock was not an omega, though.
“Sherlock?” John asked. He didn’t think a vampire could be here on behalf of anyone else.
He’d lied to Mycroft.
out!” John kicked him in the ribs, barefooted but used to kicking rugby balls, and
He took a deep breath. “Jim… at least, I think it was him… Sent me a photo of you. You, before you… transitioned,” he whispered.
“Oh my god…” John breathed.
Sherlock came over, and put his teacup into the sink. “John,” he said without turning around, “if you wanted, I could fetch you some new trousers.”
“But I mean… he went straight away?” John’s frown deepened. “Why – what did you say to him?”
“Pressed my buzzer for some morphine in the small hours…” Sherlock pushed himself off the bed, and smirked slightly as he went from looking up at John to looking down at him. “But I think I’ll be fine for a few hours without, today.”
His heart gave a twist, and a painful little thought was born.
John put his own cup down, and carefully stood out of his chair. He went over, and hesitated in front of Sherlock, before throwing caution to the wind and setting himself on Sherlock’s lap, one leg either side.
John wandered through, and stopped dead in the kitchen-dining room.
Mycroft’s lips went very thin. “Sherlock. You are playing an incredibly risky game. You are legally betrothed to John, and Victor legally betrothed to another omega. Think of the impact your relationship is having!”
James looked rather worried. “That’s crap. So you get.. drugged by the heat smell and end up having sex with someone you might not even fancy normally?”
“It means,” Lestrade seemed to realise he was talking to a not-quite thirteen-year-old, “do you want to take him to court? So he can be tried and punished?”
“I’m hardly showing!” John protested.
“Do you have any Marmite?” John asked, starting to look through the condiments.
John’s hands skittered from the bed to Sherlock’s arms, his face, his back, trying to hold on, trying not to lose him, trying to stay with him. One of Sherlock’s hands touched at his cheek, and John leaned against it, crying out at the fierce rub over his prostate, that only led one way.
“Bye,” Sherlock turned to go when a hand closed on his arm. An alpha hand. Sherlock’s inner omega, currently rising, forced him to halt, to submit to this touch.
John hated himself for noticing. He didn’t want to
Mycroft just looked at him.
And then bit.
He smiled, and stood it up on the desk before opening the parcel. A tightly-wrapped stethoscope tumbled out, along with a small and fat book on cardiology.
“Oh! I didn’t realise you were still here, Sherlock…”
What noise?
‘I don’t know,’ Sherlock lied.
10:23
Sherlock ignored every text and call from Molly over the summer. He took his grade – a flat 2:2 – and disappeared from his previous life.
Eurus… pregnant.
And then John was twenty-two.
“Um. If you... if you see Mr Holmes... his helicopter is due at oh-nine-hundred.” The soldier looked at John’s neck, again.
Sherlock could be that close, and sink his teeth into John’s flesh, and do… other things to other parts of him.
Two. Weeks.
“And you kept him restrained.”
Sherlock looked at him. “If I tell you,” he said, “you’ll never look at me with those eyes again.”
This was as bad as it could get.
“Mycroft isn’t coming,” Sherlock said. “I… I don’t live with him. I just said that to get rid of the police officer.”
“Mm,” Sherlock nodded, going back to chase John’s mouth, twitching his hips slightly as John repeated the massaging action again, and again, moving up his legs to stroke over the curve of his arse.
“How old are you? Were you?” Sherlock asked, as they walked. They were hand in hand, and it felt very natural.
John sighed. “I –”
John had to smile. There’d been a lot going on in the past year. But almost all of it positive. Sure, there’d been arguments, and illnesses, and one memorable weekend when Sherlock was delirious on some experimental drug a criminal jabbed him with (he thought he was back at boarding school, and wouldn’t have it that John was anyone but his teacher. John kept him quiet by setting him small tasks and essays to write).
“I’m fine,” John lied. “Just… my mouth got ahead of me, there.”
“Not if you don’t want to go to one.”
Saturday morning. Sherlock was at a lecture. Mycroft was in. This was bad.
. He wanted nothing – the comfortable quiet and peace and nothingness that comes from knowing you are loved, and in love.
“Sherlock –” John felt as if the white noise in his head was starting to fade. The world was shifting back into focus, and John realised he was the one who had been humming, rocking on the chair, making a strange noise, shaking and sweating. “Sherlock…” He looked into the alpha’s eyes.
friend?” Jim smirked. He looked back at Sherlock, eyes darting from Sherlock’s short hair to his chin, his chest, his hands. “I admit, Sherlock looks the part, but some
They left the building, and ran over the quad to their next lessons.
Sherlock snarled at himself as he sat up. This was exactly why he shouldn't have done that. Distraction. He stood, and yanked on the rest of his clothes without the usual care, slamming the door to the bunk as he left. He stormed down the halls until he reached the cafeteria, annoyed at himself, but not yet murderous. He saw John, and, to his dismay, Major Sholto.
John nodded. “I guess.”
John shifted uncomfortably. “I don’t want to do this at all.”
“John…” Sherlock pushed the man’s hands away from his eyes. “Don’t you dare hide your face from me. Not now.” He scraped his teeth and dragged his tongue down John’s chest, over each erect nipple until they became reddened and sore.
“Good. Because I’d be lost without you.” He said it without a drop of irony, and John was surprised.
John raised his eyebrows. “Really?”
“Black, two sugars,” he said to the microscope.
Sherlock had been baffled. ‘But… why?’
,” Sherlock snarled. “And I didn’t care. I didn’t care I was dying, don’t you get how fucked-up that is? I didn’t care about being dead, about leaving Mummy, or you, or anyone else. I was just pissed off about being able to finish the work. But now… Now I know what I’ve been missing. What I will be missing.”
“No, it isn’t,” Sherlock took the paper.
John smiled.
“I’m not supposed to let her cry,” John said, fussing her. “It’s a waste of energy she needs for growing.”
“I… yeah, I thought so, too,” John sighed, putting crumpets in the toaster. “Bit of a jeans incident.”
Sherlock noticed, his eyes flicking to John’s mouth. He pressed his own lips together.
“I don’t know. I probably deserved what… happened.”
“Both our tastes were... Quite opposite,” Sherlock looked pointedly at John. “She was my best friend. We were to be married, but..."
Sherlock didn’t say anything, just carried on wiping and cleaning his mate with the sort of gentleness John hadn’t realised he was capable of. Even when John had to stand, and Sherlock tossed the mesh underwear into the bin, there was nothing funny or embarrassing about it. It felt like being cared for.
At first, John thought he was being given space. But after a week, he realised this was simply how his new home worked – you got yourself up. You comforted yourself. You lived a solitary life, in a house full of other people.
John blushed, and squeezed Sherlock’s arm. “Thank you. You know, it really won’t be long. That bump was Thirty Weeks, apparently. So, I’ll be even bigger, waddling around like a –”
He didn’t move his hands.
Sherlock nodded. “It’s true. John… was bitten by Moriarty.”
They got to the walk-in centre, and Lestrade put Sherlock in the queue, and bought him a pastry to eat whilst they waited. They didn’t really speak. Sherlock was tired and sad, and Lestrade seemed happy enough to let him eat his snack and sit quietly.
John took his hand away. “I’m going to bed. I don’t want to do this, anymore.”
“Mm.” Sherlock turned, the corner of the desk pressing into his bottom as he leaned against it. “I’ve been thinking. About next year, when I leave school.”
Victor… he was about to learn some things, if Sherlock hadn’t told him already.
“Ashamed?” John suggested.
“It’s team spirit. Come on, you’re already out the house.”
“How?” John couldn’t ignore how much he was hurting. His joints ached. “What – do they hug you all the time or something?”
John sat back, not know what to say.
“I meant with your studies. Your report from school was beside the fridge. I hope you don’t mind, but I had a read of it whilst I waited for my turn at the champagne.”
John looked up.
“I have to,” he said.
“Here you go,” Sherlock opened the door slightly and stuck his hand through the gap.
“Some people like the ceremony,” Sherlock murmured, his tongue warm as it licked over the scar tissue.
“Not too much, or I’ll fall asleep.”
Sherlock bent down, and kissed him. It tasted of coffee and tiredness, but it was as welcome as anything else.
The Unpresented boy was sleeping soundly, his eyes closed, lips parted a little, breathing steadily and deeply. The only scents coming from him were food, and warmth. And Sherlock. Sherlock had a Sherlock smell, that wasn’t ‘omega’ or ‘beta’, it was just the scent of his skin, his clothes, his bodywash… it was nice, but barely there at all.
“John.”
John was sedated as soon as he got to the hospital.
“Do you want me to stop? If I can’t see a uterus, you’ve got to be an alpha –”
“Goes?” Sherry frowned. “What do you mean?”
“Fuck!” John lurched forward, knocking Sherlock’s head to the side with his own, and bit down, hard, through scar tissue, breaking the skin, tasting blood even as his knot swelled to fruition in Sherlock’s tight arse, trapping him inside his body, locking them together physically, as John’s bite locked them together in a way that was much, much deeper.
Sherlock jolted, realising he’d been drifting off, leaning against Mycroft’s shoulder. That was in itself bizarre – Mycroft would never have tolerated such casual touch and affection before. Now, he seemed to welcome it.
John didn’t know what to say.
Sherlock didn’t seem to notice, raising his head again and going for more food.
Sherlock took long showers, he remembered. He went to make a couple of cups of cocoa, listening to the white-noise hiss of the water. It was pretty constant, actually. No sounds of water hitting a body…
“But you will now, won’t you?” Cam put a hand on his shoulder. “I know you’re a good boy, Sherlock. I know you’re saving yourself. But you must remember that the only person truly interested in your virtue is the person who does not try to lure you into their bed, into their arms. They will wait for you. Not go begging to your parents like they are trying to arrange some betrothal. No – they will wait for you to see what’s before you.”
John took it as the train set off again, letting his smaller hand be swamped by Sherlock’s long fingers, and held safe. Warmth flooded up his arm and to his chest, and he looked up as Sherlock looked down. And for a moment, they just took one another in, in their own tiny space on the crowded train, chest to chest, their fingers entwined.
John hesitated, then nodded.
“One, two,” Sherlock repeated softly. He lowered the book and looked into John’s eyes.
“What the…”
“Rehab,” John said.
John hesitated. "Supposed to be bunking with him, aren't I?"
“Still, it’s unusual to flit between,” she ‘oof’ed, and sat up in the chair.
“John…” Sherlock whimpered, his fists clutching John’s shirt, breath coming in tiny panting bursts.
They sat there, saying nothing, until the undertaker arrived, and they had to move. And Mycroft went in to see his brother, and John went home. He hadn’t seen Sherlock after he died, and he didn’t want to. The problem with being a doctor was that a body was just a body, even if it had been someone you loved. Everything that made them who they were now lived in the people who loved them.
“You should practice on it. Get a feel for how it sounds, so your performance comes more naturally.”
Sherlock nodded, patting his hair down at the back of his head.
“Not really,” Sherlock said. He picked up his tea. “I don’t usually eat breakfast.”
Except, he’d always assumed his omega would at least be old enough to drive.
John gave a choke of pleasure as Sherlock's nips turned into a firm lick up the back of his cock, sucking softly as he reached the tip.
“Alright, that’s all sorted, sir,” the alpha man hit ‘print’. “You’ll have to check in again next month, and be re-evaluated for a longer stay at the hostel… if things haven’t worked out.” He signed something on the paper. “Your pension payments will begin in ten days, and you’ve got your wages backdated as well as compensation for injury,” he pointed at the relevant numbers. “And that’s all, sir.”
So early, the sun wasn’t up.
“What do you mean?”
“Morning, beautiful.”
“Unnnn,” John groaned. “Honestly?”
The doctor nodded. “That makes sense.” He clicked something else, and the screen cleared. “I don’t have any worries about you being a single parent, John, but I would like to send you for some counselling, given your past mental health.”
“That’s a ‘no’, then,” John grabbed for the curtain.
“Sherlock…” his mother said gently. “Would you like me to run you a bath? I bought some –” she hesitated, “some bath stuff that’s supposed to be good for muscle pain.”
His alpha didn’t answer aloud, just gave a quick nod, and John wondered what wasn’t being said. There was a peal of laughter from one corner, then, and the mood broke a little. Sherrinford and his mate excused themselves, and John reclined back on the sofa for a moment, scanning the room for Sherlock.
“You mean turn me.”
Sherlock sipped his drink. “I mean as an omega.”
“By killing people.”
. Sherlock. I was trying to talk to you…”
Mycroft chewed his lip for a moment. ‘I don’t like how he acts around you. How he has always acted around you.’
Still.
“Mummy is still alive,” Sherlock said. “Though what she knows of it all… She can’t testify against her mate, regardless.”
“I don’t think I’ve ever seen one.”
“You see what I meant? About alphas? It makes me almost ashamed to be counted as one of them. Lecherous. Taking liberties. Why – I am sure you thought there was nothing wrong with being coquettish, but…”
Sherlock could barely appreciate the gesture. His insides were churning, his binder felt too tight, and he wanted to lie face-down on concrete and scream. Jim Moriarty. At his school.
“Oh, long enough for your flesh to start necrotising,” the vampire sighed. “It’s dead meat. And so’s the rest of you, once Sherlock Holmes gets here.”
He swallowed, his throat so swollen he had to check how it felt on the outside, but moving his arms was so painful he cried out. He fumbled stiffly for the morphine-drip button, then realised it had dropped to the floor in the night.
“Or that. I think I’d have to go for speed, get to people who needed me really quick, dodge bullets, that sort of thing,” John said. “It’d be handy for nipping to the shops.”
“I don’t want you to think that about me.” John sat up. “Even if that’s what you’re told. But that’s up to you.”
“Oh,” John smiled. “If you insist.”
Mycroft worked from home the next day, temporarily enrolling John in an online school to fill his day with something more productive than television.
“I left him,” Sherlock said. “At an… inconsiderate time. He would be angry about it, I understand that, but…” he shook his head. “It’s been over a century.”
“You two have some very strange ideas,” Mycroft said. He stepped over their legs and went to go down the stairs.
“Tell me what you want,” Sherlock pushed himself up to lean back on his elbows.
He was about to have his first heat in six years.
Sherlock appeared beside him, back in his own clothes of a long-sleeved baseball top and skinny jeans. “That’s expensive,” he noticed the register.
“Yeah?”
John inhaled, scenting, for the first time, the alpha scent of Sherlock. John wasn’t mature enough to scent properly, yet, but he picked up enough. Enough to make the taste of copper flood his mouth, and his skin prickle as if scalded.
John sighed. ‘But it’s
“Right,” John picked his things up. “I’ll talk to you later, then.”
John was woken by the sound of the shower clunking into life, and the pipes groaning. He sat up, on the alert for intruders for a moment, before he remembered.
By the time he got back to the room, Sherlock had taken his shoes and socks off, and was typing rapidly on his laptop like a man - vampire - possessed.
“Where the fuck are you?” Sherlock tried again.
Harry poked him with a fluffy-socked toe. “You ok?”
“Good that you’re keeping busy,” John put the file down.
John smiled back at the image, the child’s joy infectious.
But Sherlock didn’t get to ask.
“I think you need to be with someone.”
Sherlock sat up. “But I want…”
“No,” John shook his head. “No, just… don’t move.”
“Well?” Victor folded his arms.
They hardly knew each other, it was true. Sherlock wasn't certain that it was love, it was far too soon to say, but he knew for certain that John was everything that he lacked, and that he dreaded parting ways with him.
There are ups and downs as Sherlock starts school, and John realises just how complicated their situation is.
The spotted Molly’s experiment, on her desk.
Sherlock saw the Watsons arrive, and immediately went to hide in the kitchen, his face on fire. John… John had
"John, shut up."
“You’re not going anywhere, my omega,” Sherlock growled. “You need me.”
She shrugged.
“No, it was kind of just lucky,” Quinn shrugged. “I was biking back from my painting class when I got… sick,” he went red, “and he was out for a run at the time. He came across me, and walked me home, because I was… still ok, at that point, but then… he never left my house,” Quinn smiled. “My Dad’s seriously angry.”
“Still. Hard times are softening, now, I hope?”
“Sorry,” John emptied half a tube of Pringles onto his plate.
John’s eyes nearly popped out of his head.
“Only in books, I think.”
The first line – the proof the test was working – jumped up instantly.
for a mate. That’s what sort of dangerous position you put me in, don’t you see?”
Sherlock looked like he’d like to say more, but picked up his backpack. “Do take care, though. Listen to Mycroft, if you can stand it.”
Sherlock’s face softened, just a touch. “Thank you.”
“I do,” John sniffed, forcing himself not to cry. Omegas cried. He didn’t. “I don’t want to be pregnant, but I’d do my best as a mum, and….. but this isn’t right. This isn’t fair on
The train stopped at a station. The doors opened.
“Busy.”
John shifted in his place, getting comfy against the cushions, an arm slung over the back of the sofa, claiming space. Such a not-omega thing to do. Sherlock wondered where he’d learnt it.
He inhaled, the sweet, cloying scent of omega-in-heat sticking to the back of his throat, drowning his lungs, making his blood rush, his skin prickle, and his cock instantly harden.
John pulled a face. “Most omegas, then.”
“You aren’t going back, John –”
“Stop it.”
“It’s ok, I want you to…” Sherlock said quickly. “Just… it’s flat now, so I don’t mind it, much.” He let go of John’s wrist, and John moved his hand to Sherlock’s shoulder, neck, and back of his head, bringing him down for a soft kiss.
Jealousy.
“What’s that?” John snatched it back and turned, out of reach, to read it.
Mycroft came forward. “Sherlock… has been getting on very well at h… the new school.”
Sherlock just had time to wet his lips again before the hot head of John’s cock pressed against them, and slipped through into the alpha’s mouth. Sherlock moaned around it, and gripped John’s thighs in his hands as John penetrated his mouth completely. This was only possible due to John’s size, but Sherlock was not about to complain. His nose was pressed against the thatch of John’s crotch, the heavy weight of his erect cock was on his tongue, and Sherlock swallowed around it in delight, savouring the mild taste of it as John swore above him.
Sherlock looked at him. At how the pale winter light graced John’s face. Every tired line at his eyes, every greying blond hair, every curve of his chin and nose and mouth. No one would call John beautiful. He looked nothing like an omega. But he was everything Sherlock wanted.
"No," Sherlock said, then amended himself. "Not always. Perhaps it's time I remembered. I have ignored the pieces of my past that have shaped me for far too long."
Greg’s eyes flicked down. “…moving?”
"So," John began, grasping at straws. "You think the coroner did it?"
alpha would agree with me.”
“Indeed. And it was not a brief stay. Sherlock needed psychological help, as well as physically dealing with his addictions. He was malnourished, had hepatitis, and was lucky to not have worse. He took… some convincing, to stay.”
“It should be special, though… You only get to do it once.”
“Yeah. And – and it like… you live a bit dangerously, John. You lived with two alphas, and before that another one. We – we’re worried about you.”
John sighed. “I thought you’d never ask.”
“These jeans do nothing for my arse,” John sighed, as they walked past a full-length mirror.
A thin ribbon of blood snaked through the bathwater.
“Yes, please.”
"Of course," Sherry wiped his eyes quickly, and stood. "This... is my doing, I should never have taken -"
“I can’t go back,” John croaked. “I can’t – I can’t – ”
Sherlock went on. “I found a man I liked the look of, in one of the city parks. Soliciting. I offered him money for something less strenuous than being fucked by the gentry, and he took it. It was… the early days of my trying to get control over the… situation. And a human you could use regularly would be less of a temptation than a stranger.”
They got off at South Kensington, and walked to the museums, spending the day wandering in and out of them in turn. They didn’t really read any of the exhibit cards, they just walked, and occasionally stopped to stare, and now and then glanced at one another as they caught sight of their reflections in a polished surface. John tried to keep a snapshot in his head of how they looked together. Tell Sherlock, short John, dark and blond, pale and tanned, alpha and omega.
“Good, because I don’t think anywhere else is going to have me,” John forced a laugh. “You’re stuck with me – us – now.”
“John…”
“I can look in my room. But… is it? Bad?”
“We still need to think of a name, for her,” John said, watching the baby’s chest move up and down. “Have you thought of anything?”
“What a stupid boy,” Mycroft shook his head. He spoke to the driver. “Move. Drive as close to the flat door as you can. Slowly. If you have to hit people, I’d rather we pushed them out of the way rather than flattened them.”
Still…
“Yeah,” John couldn’t speak. His nose was streaming, his eyes watering. He was going to lose it.
Sherlock looked back.
Mycroft raised his eyebrows, looking at the alpha. “Well, that takes care of that, then. Keep in touch, little brother.” They hugged – a close hug with both of them scenting the other – and then Mycroft clicked the door closed behind him.
Sherlock’s eyes went dark, for a second. “John… I was brought up to believe that omegas – omega men, especially – are devious. I know, that isn’t always true,” he said, as John opened his mouth to argue, “but that’s what I was told. It took me a lot of time to shake that off, and I had just about managed it when you arrived to live with us. I looked at you, and I didn’t see anything like the sly omegas my father had warned me about. You were meek, and shy, and hurting, and I wanted to comfort you more than I’d ever wanted to do anything in my life. You were going to be mine, and I was happy.”
John heard Sherlock’s drumming fingers still.
“I know you do,” John whispered. “I just wish that was enough.”
Sherlock took the top off his egg with a single swipe of his knife.
a nasty little voice whined in John’s alpha brain.
Sherlock's first instinct was to hang onto the struggling creature, but stopped short as the thing cried out in pain at the grip Sherlock had on him. Sherlock relaxed the grasp of his suckers, and let the walker crawl backwards, away from beneath him and into the coldness of the empty cave. There were circular red marks on his skin where the sucked had bitten down on him. He was fragile, then. His body temperature was dropping already.
Sherlock stood.
“Yes…” Sherlock couldn’t help glancing down at his own evident arousal.
John was at his desk, waiting for Sherlock to come home from the cinema with Victor. He was writing an application for something or other for work, when the front door opened.
Sherlock blinked, and cleared his throat. “I thought I’d… come and see you.”
“That I’ll... let you down. Not be good,” John forced a small, nervous laugh.
Sherlock's POV
He rang the bell, and stood back to wait.
The banging resumed. “John, let me in. John, I can help you, I – I promise not to hurt you…”
“In that future, you were my world.”
“When you bite me my body will react by beginning sexual maturity,” Sherlock said as if reading from a textbook. John wondered if he had memorised it. “Your bite will cause my first heat and then I’ll be sexually mature and ready for your –”
“He’s gone off to bond with someone,” he said, each word like having a nail driven through his tongue. “Someone else.”
"So, you think he killed Scott Brooks?" John asked.
“Yeah well, I don’t have to do a lot of things,” John parroted, and perched on the edge of the table. He let a few long seconds pass. “So, what’s the plan?”
John forced his eye forward, again. He had met only one vampire, before.
ought to have been.
‘Yeah…’ John’s dad took the seat opposite at the table. ‘Yeah, Siger mentioned it. Seemed torn between approval and disapproval, to be honest. I think it’ll do Sherlock the world of good to get away for a while. What do you think about it all?’
Sherlock immediately planted a kiss onto John’s covered erection, opening his mouth to press the covered length into it. John let out a soft swear, which Sherlock took as encouragement. He mouthed at John’s cock for a few move seconds before slipping his hands under the waistband of John’s underwear, and pushing it downwards swiftly so his mouth stayed where it was, now skin on skin, the heat of John’s cock on his tongue, where it belonged.
“You need pampering,” Sherry sighed, making a noise that was vaguely concerning as the masseuse working on him crunched something in his calf. “Sherlock should be doing this for you every night.”
“Yes,” Sherlock did so, looking over his shoulder as John took his own clothes off, his erect alpha cock drawing Sherlock’s eyes as if he’d never seen it before. Sherlock hadn’t had a heat since they bonded, as he was pregnant, and although they still had penetrative sex, it wasn’t often, as Sherlock simply wasn’t designed to deal with a knot outside of heats.
John caught him by the elbows. “Sherlock Watson-Holmes, you do not look horrible. You look bloody gorgeous, and you’re going to end up so beautiful you drive me insane!”
They spent most of the Easter holiday together.
Sherlock could hardly blame him, for that. He’d rejected him romantically, and clearly he wasn’t interested in being just friends. That was fine. Sherlock was better off alone.
John wondered if he was disappointed. "Thirty. As of yesterday."
,’ Sherlock sighed. He had stopped shaking, now, and he was starting to panic less. ‘It’s ok. I wanted to.’
Trousers fell to the floor, and were stepped out of. John’s hands went straight for Sherlock’s erect cock, making him gasp, and try to thrust but step awkwardly instead. John tightened his fingers around the cotton-covered hardness and squeezed, once.
Sherlock jumped, doing a double-take at the omega on the floor. “What’re you doing in here?”
He watched out the landing window as Mr Holmes cleared the last of the frost, and went back into the house. It was a bitterly cold day. The puddles on the pavement were frozen over, and John’s breath kept on fogging up the glass.
Sherlock touched self-consciously at his pink polo-shirt, and undid the top button. He thought he might have a lot to learn, this summer.
How long could he pretend to be anything but ruined?
“Kidneys…” John moved the wand back down to Sherlock’s pelvis, pressing hard to try and see further inside him.
“No, it’s your safety. And wow if I don’t seem to be the only one concerned about it.” He marched off in a huff, rubbing the back of his neck as he went to shout at some of the junior officers.
“Because you were told from the word ‘go’ that I was a boy. Your mind accepted it because there was no alternative. If you hadn’t known, what would you think? Would you see me like you do, if you’d known from the start? We’ll never know.”
“Or maybe, no omega has ever left quite like I did,” John reasoned. He looked away, and resisted the urge to touch his abdomen. There was nothing to feel. But it was part of Sherlock, and John was itching to be close to him. It was like feeling two emotions, or more, at once. John was angry, and sorry, and upset, and anxious, and righteous and other things he didn’t have names for.
Sherlock put an arm around John’s shoulders, and squeezed. “Home.”
“Just promise not to laugh, ok?” John forced a smile, and opened his dressing gown quickly, letting it drop from his arms, down, to the floor.
“Well, there’s not many female names on our side,” Mycroft mused. “Our parents both had male-male parents, so we never had any female grandmothers.”
Lestrade cleared his throat again. “Well. Thanks. For getting me in, earlier. I’m sure we’ll… see each other again.”
John’s bedroom door was open, and John stood there, still fully clothed except for his socks.
“Ah,” Mycroft said, following John in. “I see you’ve made yourself at home.”
“I have to say, without being able to smell you, I’d’ve put you down for beta,” the doctor said, making a note. “You’re big for your age.”
The server came and took their orders, and John knew better than to listen to Cam, who insisted that steak should be served “blue” in France. He even asked if his potatoes could be exchanged for chips, just to watch the flinch of horror on the old man’s face.
“Is this it?” John opened the door, and got out, letting blood rush back into his legs.
James roared with laughed. “Oh god, yeah, I forgot I used to say that. Fuck… Look at you,” he looked John over. “You… you’re one of us, then?”
Sherlock nodded, taking a deep breath, for self-control, as he gripped the base of his cock and aimed to rub the exposed glans against John’s wet and opening hole.
“Ok, then. I’ll go and –”
John sighed. “Looks like we’ll have to go shopping. And see about school. Are you in a school?”
Molly looked up, then hid her face half behind the door again. “I have to go. Please don’t knock again.”
John Watson zipped up his jacket as he walked out of the underground station, the autumn wind blowing newspaper sheets and old crisp wrappers around his jeans. The Evening Standard distributer was wearing a thick hat and gloves, and John almost felt bad for refusing a copy of the rag as he hitched up his backpack. The army had taught him not to get attached to possessions, and his bag of clothes was one of only two. The other had been sent on to the half-way house that he would be staying in, if this went badly.
, all blushing and shy and
He went back into the sitting room, and picked up one of the tiny white sleep-suits.
Beside John, Mycroft smirked.
“You don’t get to fucking touch me,” John snarled, omega defensiveness pouring off him as he bared his teeth. “You do not. You keep your fucking hand and nose to yourself, do you understand me?”
“He’s very charming,” Sherlock sighed. “He’s done it before. Got a beta to let him in, said he wanted to surprise me.” He suddenly looked exhausted, and miserable. “I thought it was romantic. Now it just seems… odd.”
“That was quick,” James said as John got in. “How…”
“Stop making me jealous,” John pressed back, his envious arousal obvious. “Do you want me to wait up for you?”
“Yes, it is unfortunate,” Mycroft sighed.
The living room door burst open.
“It’s very ok,” John said. “Sherlock… it’s very ok.”
“Work?” Harry said, as if the older man was an idiot.
Mycroft came out of the house, and locked the door.
“You think so little of yourself,” John said sadly. “So little, and yet you have done so much.”
you say to him?”
“You’re so precious,” Cam said. “You deserve to be with someone who can see that. Who knows your worth. Who will treat you like a prince every day of your life, and let you have the money and education you need. In this world, Sherlock, you cannot trust anyone. You let someone close to you, and they become a threat. Unless…” he looked at him, “you are meant to be.”
to,” John said. “I just think I might have to.”
Mycroft looked at his brother. “I hope you realise what this means, Sherlock.”
“True…” Sherlock said. “Have you spoken to your sister, recently?”
John leaned forward and scented him again, getting only citrus and vanilla once more. “I can’t smell it now. It’s your call.”
“I guess I’ll starve, then,” John sighed, looking in the cupboards and finding a bag of something called
“No, thank you,” Sherlock sat back in his seat. “I’m alright.” He took out his phone and quickly punched in a search:
(See the end of the chapter for
“No.”
Sherlock stroked a finger over John’s wounded throat. “There is another option.”
He sent the message, and pressed his phone against his head, hating himself for a moment before going into the kitchen, and grabbing a few plastic bottles of water, and some energy bars. He took them into the bedroom, and waited nervously for the pain to begin.
They dressed warmly, Sherlock pulling John’s hat on firmly, and knotting his scarf under his chin, so John’s heart sang with the joy of being cared for. He even let Sherlock hold his gloves out before wriggling his fingers into the holes.
Sherlock frowned. “What happened?”
“Some water, please,” Sherlock was saying to Sherry, who had come running at the noise.
Sherlock ran away from the angel – the man – until he was out of sight. He stood, catching his breath at a street corner, trying to think what to do. He should go back to his flat, and sleep off this… whatever this was. This trip, or hallucination…
“Thanks,” John grinned, taking a slice as Sherlock set the tray down.
John suddenly wished he was wearing something other than his bloodied and torn uniform. “Mycroft… can I get changed?”
‘Sometimes,’ Joseph nodded. ‘But this was my own doing, for certain. He is a nice man, and I wanted to tell him my problems. He was a good listener, and I… like him. It was a mistake. Several mistakes.’ He looked very sad, and Sherlock’s heart ached.
“Um, yeah,” John tried to get back into the story. “Yeah, and then… we didn’t see each other for a long while, and then… he was…” he trailed off.
“Right…” John didn’t know whether to laugh, or not. This man was the strangest alpha he’d ever met. He didn’t know whether to relax, or not. On the one hand, both of them knew the gender status of their flatmate. On the other, neither of them seemed to want to discuss it. If Sherlock was happy for John to continue pretending to be a beta, John was happy to carry on doing it.
John and his parents and sister didn’t bother with coats, simply popped round once they’d seen a few cars arrive.
Sherlock sat bolt upright, eyes wide open. He looked right at John. “You are such a liar,” he said.
“I have to be,” John said. “He’s with someone else. It doesn’t matter what I want. It’s not my choice. I’ve chosen to have a baby. No one else has to get involved.”
Mycroft lowered his device for the first time. “Sherlock makes a good point, Mother. He’ll only be under everyone’s feet. And I’m not going to supervise him. He’s hardly eligible for the wine-tasting and whatever else you and Father have planned.”
Sherlock, as tall, beautiful and threatening as ever, shook his head. “I could have killed you.”
It was almost a relief to go back to school.
Two days ago, there’d been an ambulance on his street. Siger Holmes, Sherlock’s dad, had been taken to hospital. John didn’t know the details, but he guessed it was serious by the way his parents talked about it in hushed voices when he was around. He didn’t even know how old Siger was -older than his own dad, that was for sure, but he didn’t seem old enough to get seriously sick.
There was a cold silence.
“What – the machine?” Sherlock nodded at the device the hero was staggering out of. “Or the man?”
John rapidly moved his wrist, jacking Sherlock furiously as the alpha’s orgasm smashed into him. Come ran down John’s hand, splattered over Sherlock’s chest, as white-hot electricity crackled over his body.
James snorted. “Hit home for him, has it? That’s it’s real, not something he has ignore?”
“John… John, please. I’m – I’m not Mycroft. I – I’ll take care of you. I won’t hurt you. I’ll be gentle. I swear – John, I – I love –”
“Shit,” John struggled out of the covers, and yanked on his trousers, trying not to think about gravity and how shagged-out he probably looked. He went to the door, and opened it barely a crack. “Yes?”
Then smiled wider as he spotted the stocking at the end of his bed, several wrapped gifts sticking out.
“Yes, yes, you’re here to show me…” Sherlock stopped at Jubilee Drive. “She lives here?”
“Ambulance.”
"I didn't! You honestly think I'm that clever anyway?"
“Then go study, or something. And for god’s sake, no more fighting.”
Sighing, John took out his phone, and scrolled through to Sherlock’s number.
Sherlock turned his phone over in his spidery hands. “Your baby’s the size of an avocado, did you know?”
“A favour.”
Someone snorted with embarrassed laughter.
“No, what I mean is… Are you safe
“Greg?” John blinked.
John shuddered, passing a hand over the back of his neck, as if he could rub the memory away. It had been so… sudden. One moment he was desperate for Sherlock’s touch, the next it was as though John’s skin was ready to crawl straight off. It had been the scenting, he knew, he wasn’t stupid. Sherlock scenting him, the same slow, lingering, inhale along John’s skin… Just like his father had. A taste of John’s omega-ness.
“Sherlock,” John snapped, starting to shake. “Where is he? Jesus Christ, tell me what’s happened because if I’ve lost him –”
Four hours after John first arrived at hospital, Sherlock’s phone rang.
Sherlock shifted. His arse was indeed numb. “I think a short walk is in order…” he stood, feeling his sternum crack.
“Sherlock, now. Come on, your hand’s swelling, I can see it happening!”
John raised his eyebrows, but didn’t interrupt.
“I felt safe, with you,” Sherlock touched John’s Adam’s apple. “When you held me.”
John’s hand slipped into his own, prising his fingers from their iron grip, and softly holding on, like an anchor in the storm of Sherlock’s thoughts.
They assembled their breakfast in silence, and eventually sat opposite one another at the end of the breakfast bar.
Siger walked in, and sniffed at the lady’s neck, and she seemed to like it, because she smiled.
alpha, and John’s instincts respected that, but John was pregnant with another alpha’s baby. James was, deep down in John’s lizard brain, a threat. Or, an option.
“Is Alfie the same?” John asked.
They walked the rest of the way home, together.
Sherlock and John exchanged a silent high-five, and sat up.
Sherlock was certain now that he was falling in love.
Sherlock hummed. "Then, I suppose we're similar in that aspect. Nothing's ever taken precedence over my job in close to 500 years. Not even food," he smiled, looking away from John.
John shouted in shock, pleasure slamming into him like a wave, knocking him flat against the mattress, his arms giving way completely as he came. His orgasm dragged out, making the omega cry out, clear ejaculate streaming from his cock, joined immediately by thick white ropes from Sherlock’s cock as the alpha bit hard into the pillow beside John’s head, rutting into his own hand, against John’s little cock in a display that made John want to sob.
He had no time to unpick the feeling, however, as Mycroft peering into the conservatory, looking somewhere between concerned and sad. “Sherlock, Cam is here.”
He opened the man's email. Not many were of importance --at least to Sherlock. His thin fingers tapped on the keys, accessing any deleted files from this computer.
The major folded his arms. "Well then, I suppose I'll just have to have someone sent over who will be more compliant."
“You are all of those things, John. And more.” Melody wrote something down. “I want you to think about what you’ve just told me, and I want you to know that we are stopping talking about it, now. That doesn’t mean it didn’t happen, and it doesn’t mean that it’s forgotten. It means that the time to talk about that is done, for today. It’s time, now, to revisit your memory of Sherlock, and Lucy.”
John turned the card over in his hands, again. The edges were starting to get rather soft.
“…you didn’t…” John wanted to reach for one of the chocolate-looking things, but couldn’t seem to make his arms work. “You don’t like me.”
“M23… that’s Dr Brown’s room, sir.” The guard looked up. “You let yourself in, didn’t you?”
John pressed his lips together for a moment, considering.
Sherlock's nostrils flared, and he opened a laptop almost carelessly as he passed it, going to the hard copy drawers as it slowly booted up.
“No, no, who did this?” John didn’t hold onto him, but his tone forced Sherlock to stay still.
“Well, quite.” He turned to face John properly. “What is it that makes you feel shit?”
Sherlock hummed, and ran a hand through his hair.
John pushed the tight jeans down, over the perfect globe of Sherlock’s arse, squeezing the muscle through his black boxer-briefs, dragging two fingers in the cleft, making Sherlock shudder and put his hands on John’s hair.
Sherlock nodded.
"Oh!" John gasped as the fingers inside him were withdrawn, and Sherlock stood to unbuckle his own belt. John flushed red with anticipation, and started to turn onto his front.
John watched him pour the water. Decaf for him. Real tea for Sherlock. “That doesn’t mean I don’t want –”
Then he yanked John’s head back hard, and bit deeply into his wounded throat.
, John realised. But he couldn’t hang onto the thought. Or the worry it should have caused him.
“John,” he said, pointing to the line of marks at the top. And then: “Sherlock,” he ran his finger under those at the bottom.
Nah. Surely not..?
‘I don’t know what we can do,’ Sherlock sighed. ‘But I want to do
But he didn’t want to feel his body. He wanted to be separate from it.
The candle was blown out.
Sherlock looked away.
“I can see it. Your often-removed wedding ring. Often-replaced, too. Your clothes – rumpled. You look older than you are, you haven’t been sleeping. You’re bored. I can see you’re bored. I’ve seen that look on my own face often enough.”
“What do you care?” John shrugged, the paper beneath him crinkling. “You hardly offered me a place.”
Sherlock scowled, the glow of the screen lighting up his face. John knew he wasn’t shaving yet, and he was still little – if he was going to take after his brother, he had some serious growing to do, yet. “It just worries me, ok?”
A time he would never forget.
“Mm?” Teeth joined the assaulting tongue, scraping over each individual goose-bump in a way that made John squirm, grinding down on Sherlock’s erection, making the alpha release a breathy snarl close to John’s ear. John’s inner omega practically melted.
John looked up sharply. “Oh god. Is it about last night? I… I know you ran to your room – Sherlock, did I make you uncomfortable? I’m so sorry.”
Sherlock nodded. It was like trying to get a response out of a statue.
They both had too much to lose.
“You’re welcome,” Sherlock beamed, as John took in the sight of at least twenty Easter Eggs. “I wasn’t sure which chocolate you liked best.”
John charged over, grabbing Sherlock by the shirt front, alpha need burning under his skin. He pushed Sherlock against the wall, and started scenting him viciously.
"Mm." John looked at Sherlock, and smiled softly. "You'd better kiss me before they come in.”
“It will pass to Sherlock, eventually,” Violet said, giving her youngest son a smile.
It was almost too much.
“Mm,” John sighed, listening to Sherlock’s heart beginning to thump harder. “Is this ok?”
John sighed. “You were self-mediating? Against what?”
John reached over the table, and they took one another’s hands. “I love you.”
“No, I had excellent doctors, myself. I returned to practicing medicine for a while, and now I’m teaching others to do the same.”
John tried again, swallowing a full mouth of the stuff.
“You’re a baby,” she said. “You know nothing, and you’re stupid enough to be unbonded in a world like this. Sherlock won’t wait for you forever.”
“I don’t know what you mean,” Molly frowned. “You must have been
“I prefer to text,” Sherlock allowed himself a half-glance at John, whose face was oblivious, interested, respectful, and
John nodded, and got into the car.
“Sherlock…”
Life, it seems, is what happens when you realise you have found what you did not realise you were looking for.
“You and I clearly have very different opinions about
It was over.
They glared at one another.
On the floor above, Baby Watson was beginning a course of treatment to bolster her tiny lungs, and encourage her little organs to grow, and keep her alive.
“What…. You doing?” he managed to slur.
John bit his lip. “Sholto… level with me, here. Is this going to get too difficult for you? Because… I’m only going to get worse, and I know it’s not easy… and our history…” he blushed.
John was sitting at the kitchen table, doing his homework, when Sherlock came and crashed his A-Level coursework all over the surface. John delicately moved one of the pieces of paper that was touching his work, and tried to ignore it. Sherlock unfolded a huge chart, and shoved it further down, so it half-obscured John’s textbook.
“John, Sherlock,” John repeated, saying them slowly as he drew his finger under the names.
“H…yeah,” John gave the baby a small wave, and he banged his palms on the tray in front of him in response.
‘Then don’t.’ Sherlock raised his head to look. ‘You’re torturing me.’
Greg raised an eyebrow. “You mean, you want something to happen?”
Mrs Trevor was quiet for a moment. And then yelled. “DAVID!”
“No, I just… didn’t think. I never went into one. I’m staying in town.”
“Back to my room,” Sherlock sighed. “I’m in the omega-beta block.”
Too strong for John.
A pause. Victor was looking at him as if he was a book he could read. You didn’t have to be a genius to figure out why Sherlock lived with an older alpha. “You had an arrangement, didn’t you?”
It felt like a future had died.
“Where was I… Ah. Yes, if an omega needs medical attention, they must be seen to by a beta or omega medical professional, for obvious reasons.”
“As dead or alive as whichever medical journal we are trusting this week claims,” Mycroft gave a tiny smile.
John nodded again, taking the leaflets he was offered. He left them on the table for Sherlock to find later that night.
Alphas would use him?
The implication didn’t hit John suddenly. It settled over him like a heavy cloud, pressing him into the bed, weighing him down with the knowledge that Sherlock had not only had a lover before – and of course he had, no one could do what he did in the bedroom without a lot of practice – but that he had turned him. And, furthermore… he was no longer around.
“And you have no idea of his present location?” Mycroft snapped.
“Assume what you like,” Mycroft picked up his teacup. “You look dreadful, Sherlock.”
“Of course,” she looked up. “The classes aren’t segregated, by then, but omega just take a few days off when… it’s their time of the month,” she blushed, then, and looked back at the paper. “I do hate to see good students drop out at sixteen.”
“It’s cold,” Sherlock said unnecessarily. His breath fogged in front of his face. His toes were starting to feel the bite of the temperature, too. “Why do they do this charade?”
Sherlock frowned, and looked into John’s eyes. “…what?”
Sherlock raised an eyebrow. “I see.”
There was no goodbye kiss – they would never have gotten away with that, so Sherlock had to be content with a smile and a subtle wink. He would write, of course, they both would, and they had the promise of the both of them waiting.
Sherlock realised he was standing on the ice rink, in his shoes, the rubber soles gripping the ice, his coat buffeted by the wind, his arms empty.
John had faced down many angry alphas, some of them holding guns, but he had never felt like this. This was his
“He’s talk about you, just sometimes, and when he did it was like he was being pulled apart from the inside. I used to think it must be awful, loving someone so much it hurts you. But it’s just another drug. He’s addicted to you.
“Thank you. This place looks so posh I’m surprised I’m not in one of those long coat-jacket things,” John grabbed a slice of toast.
“Oh…” John looked as though he was realising. Probably thinking about how young Sherlock looked in September. How he never played sports, how he always wore a dark shirt, how he’d get out of breath if he had to run, how his arms and hands were thin, how he’d always looked like a girl, but John had chosen not to see.
“You don’t have to lie to me, Mycroft, I’ve seen a mirror,” John croaked.
“Move,” John nodded. “Don’t – just gentle –”
Sherlock hovered for a moment, then disappeared up to his new room.
Siger Holmes looked down. “Oh, hello,” he said, looking at a small, unwashed, blond boy, wearing shorts and a red backpack almost as big as he was.
John helped him to the carpeted floor, sitting beside him as he caught his breath. “Shit… Sherlock, deep breaths. He’s gone, it’s ok…”
The Sunday was worse. Time dragged, the hands of the clock crawling around to six in the evening, when Mycroft had promised to deliver Sherlock back to John.
“There,” Moriarty said. “Now, you know what it is like to lose your entire world.”
Sherlock holds him again, both of them on their sides, John’s face hidden in his chest once more.
“You weren’t meant to be there
With a jolt, John realised he was happy. He hadn’t felt like that in a long time.
John gasped, as an unexpected touch brushed over his entrance.
“I’m sorry,” Victor stroked his face. “I’ll stop.”
He didn’t answer it. He didn’t trust himself to speak. He felt as if a bear trap had closed on his throat and around his chest.
“Sure, you can finish it, if you like. Only a few puffs left in it.”
John couldn’t look up, mortification flooding from every sleep-deprived inch of him.
Sherlock nodded, tears running down his face.
John let go of Sherlock’s chin, and dropped the dirty swabs into the bin. He sprayed antiseptic onto a clean swab and held it up in a pair of steel tongs. “Sherlock… What aren’t you telling me? You don’t have to…” he sighed, wincing a little. “You don’t have to spare my feelings. I know you live with… it’s…” he brought the swab down and started to clean the cut, “I just want you to be safe.”
“I should have told Mycroft to go back for her,” John hid his face again.
Victor held a hand up. “John… You…”
Sherlock left late that night.
Mycroft took some papers out of his bag, separated them, and handed one set to John, the other to Sherlock. “It appears that there are requirements that must be fulfilled. One of which is…”
December was born.
Sherlock’s insides clenched around his fingers. That was what he needed. This useless beta couldn’t give it to him.
, yours. I…” his words were cut short as Sherlock pulled back and thrust hard back inside, and again, and again, slamming into John with quick snaps of his hips that had the omega shaking and moaning. It was marking, claiming, staking a claim on John, driven by instinctual need rather than lust, and John’s inner omega was crowing in triumph at the fierce pleasure-pain shooting through him with every fierce thrust.
By the time the plane landed, Sherlock had settled into a cool indifference. It was all a game, really.
Sherlock nodded. “He did.”
The summers when he still had Sherlock.
“Yes.”
John carried home bags of nappies, tiny baby clothes, and baby bath bubbles. Mycroft came to the flat with a box full of baby outfits, hats and socks. John had been incredibly embarrassed, not least with the unsaid idea of Mycroft being an uncle, sort-of.
“Al-alright.”
The mess hall smelled strongly of something spicy, and Sherlock winced as they walked in, before stalking off to plant himself at the furthest table away from the serving area as possible.
“Ok, first of all, that’s not how heats work,” John said. “You’d feel tired and ill before your scent changed, and you’d eat a lot, use the bathroom more… There’d be clear signs. Did no one tell you this?”
been an embarrassment…
“Right,” Sherlock croaked as John pressed firmly down.
John fought the urge to tense up.
“I was in Clapham…”
Sherlock took a shuddering breath, and hid his face further.
Sherry listened carefully, occasionally raising his eyebrows or shaking his head, until John got to the end of the much abbreviated story.
The vampire grinned at him.
John sat on the sofa with his head in his hands.
“You’ve been invited,” his mother said. “After everything Cam has done for you, don’t you think it’s polite to call in when you’re invited?”
John saw Sherlock go rigid, beside him.
“You wouldn’t want a broken omega, anyway,” John said, picking up his jacket. “I shouldn’t have come here. I’m – I’m sorry for putting you in this position.”
Sherlock rolled his eyes, hands moving to the front of his bump. “I’m going to have a bath.”
“No!” Sherlock reached down between his legs. “No, it’s not…” he looked at John with genuine terror in his eyes. “John…!”
Sherlock hummed, already looking between the file and the coroner. "Does he have any enemies? That man."
Sherlock shuddered. Not in fear, but in need. “Please…”
“Work?” John looked at him.
“The doors are locked,” Sherlock pointed out calmly.
Sherlock promised he would, and picked up his coat to follow his father to the car.
Sherlock’s words did a number on John, whose eyes went wide in shock, then darkened with lust. The alpha bit his lip as he softly, slowly, slid a single finger inside Sherlock.
John smiled, involuntarily, imaging himself with a baby, two, one in each arm, and a full belly, stretched and round and beautiful, Sherlock’s alpha kisses at his throat as he cradled his family.
‘He came to you to talk. He trusted you.’
‘Why? What happens if –’
“Yes, he’s moved,” Sherlock replied, letting himself out of the car. He was round to John’s side before John had his seatbelt undone, and took John’s arm to help him out of the car.
‘No!’ John said, quickly. ‘No, it’s… it’s more than ok.’ He lifted the baby up to sniff her head, and shut his eyes as he inhaled her baby smell. He kissed her on the head, and she grimaced, stretching slightly. John smiled. Then blinked, realising. ‘She doesn’t have a name.’
“If it
There were nods. ‘I’m going to approach a guy after Christmas,’ the omega boy, Joseph, said. ‘He was my second choice, but since the asshole I just mentioned showed his true colours, he’s been bumped up a bit. He’s widowed, so I think I need to move fast.’
And on his seventeenth birthday, John handed him a gift.
John forced himself to let go of the door handle. “Right. Ok then, Polly?”
“Oh, my god,” John sighed, as he opened the kitchen door. “Really?”
“It’s only a few years,” Sherlock smiled down at him. “I’ll be back before you know it, John.”
‘That’s still true. Sort of. But… and I know this will be hard to understand, given that I’m an omega, but… I didn’t want the kiss. The one that wasn’t you, I mean.’
“Seemed to.”
‘I said, I’ll write to them,’ Mr Thorne said firmly. He looked up again, and there was a quiet sort of anger in his eyes that Sherlock hadn’t seen before. ‘Don’t argue with me, please. Now, how are those cells getting on?’
Sherlock smiled. Then leaned up, and kissed him gently on the cheek.
John dropped the packet.
one of them. I want it to be… with someone who loves me.”
They picked out a table surrounded by chairs that were puffed out with huge padded cushions. They were warm, and the table-heaters were excellent, so much so that John removed his hat and Molly unzipped her coat a little.
“I want to focus on something good, first,” she said. “A happy memory, a happy time. Can you think of a happy time? What’s the first thing that springs to mind?”
A car horn beeped outside.
“I’m going back to St Bede’s in a few days,” Sherlock said.
“But why?”
Lestrade opened the box, and took out the antiseptic wipes. He unbuttoned his cuffs, and pushed his sleeves up to the elbow. Several cuts had bitten into his skin.
Sherlock was never, in all the years that followed, exactly sure why he acted as he did then.
“I’m supposed to be bonded to you already,” Sherlock sounded confused. “Weren’t you just waiting for me to… prove it was ok?”
John closed his eyes, and waited for the next wave of need to overcome him.
“That…” Sherlock squinted, dread curling in his guts, his mouth going awfully dry. “That – that can’t be…”
John shook his head, noticing the scars on her throat. Bite-mark after bite-mark after bite-mark.
Sherlock’s face was shining with longing. He looked back at the book he held, and turned a few more pages, coming to some illustrations of crabs. He tapped the picture, and said something before looking at John.
Sherlock could only nod, smearing tears onto Mycroft’s lapels.
“Stop talking about her as though she’s not here,” John said.
Sherlock wasn't sorry at all.
James hummed. "It'll come right. There's worse things than investigations."
John nodded. Sherlock didn’t have to discuss it now, or ever. But John hoped he would.
“Oh, I bet. How is that, by the way?” Greg pointed at John’s shoulder with his fork.
“As long as you’re happy, darling,” she squeezed his arm, and they went to take the car into town, together.
Their proximity forced Sherlock to swallow John's scent. He still smelled of the hospital, but it was fading, slowly, through the cab ride to the flat and being in Sherlock's presence.
surprised the day he got home from football practice to find Sherlock being restrained by Siger and Mycroft, in the hall.
‘Yes.’
And John came with a groan, snapping his hips forward to bury his cock inside his mate, releasing inside him, trying to catch his breath even as Sherlock’s hands touched at his arms, his chest, his little swollen belly…
Sherlock, however, rubbed his arm in mock-outrage. “As if.”
He could barely walk down the stairs and into the car, his head felt as though it was full of rushing white noise. He wasn’t shaking, he was past that, he was in disbelief at his own actions. Was he actually going to do this? Maybe he’d lose his nerve and run away at the last second. Maybe he’d be found out before he got out of the car. Maybe Magnussen would turn around and say he didn’t want him anyway.
His dad coughed, and gripped the steering wheel tight.
as he passed his door. He sat up, realising he was in bed, with yesterday’s clothes on. Sherlock must have put him to bed. And not taken his clothes off, which was a plus. John had to smile.
It was happening so fast. John moved like a released animal, tearing at the vampire’s clothing. Sherlock only had to help him with the top buttons, where it hurt John to lift his arms for too long. Sherlock’s deep red, recently fed eyes watched, as John lowered his hands to the vampire's trousers.
He felt at peace.
Mayhew glanced at his solicitor, who stood up. “Madam Justice, it is hardly fair to ask an alpha to show restraint when in the same room as a heating omega.”
“Oh.” Sherlock’s mouth twisted.
“Sherlock!”
“I do hope so. Has he mentioned mating, at all?”
if John would like to do x or y. He instructs. That is how it works.”
“Oh.’ John stepped back. “Come in, then.”
Maybe even depressed.
“I’m not a girl.”
“You sound as though…”
. Each syllable felt like a brand.
Some recommended a more expensive pregnancy test than the own-brand one John had risked.
Eight hours.
‘Alright.’ John smoothed his covers. ‘I’ll be here, if you need me.’
“My room,” Sherlock looked across at the door.
“Sort of. Yeah, it was nice to see Quinn.”
They wrote ‘rock’, ‘sky’, ‘boat’, ‘day’, ‘night’. They wrote down the words for ‘Mother’, ‘Father’, and ‘Brother’, John drawing pictures to explain the differences between the words. Sherlock’s memory was astonishing. He was rapidly stringing nouns together and hunting for more language like searching for a lost sock in a drawer. John marvelled at it. The mer-man only needed to be told something once, twice at the most, and he remembered it. John’s heart swelled every time Sherlock grew more and more delighted, his handsome face making John remember their first night on the rocks, and not knowing quite how to process the feelings that came with it. Sherlock was no
“You’re taking a coat? Really?” Lestrade glanced at the summer sunshine beating down outside.
Sherlock pushed his chair back from the table. “Fine. You won’t help me. I get it.”
“The sooner the better,” John grumbled into his mug. He looked at the letter, again. “I don’t know why I keep reading this. It just winds me up.”
John saw the Holmes’ car arrive home about six. He didn’t see anyone get out of the vehicle, as he was at the dining table at the time, but he heard the car doors slam, and then there was silence. He glanced at the clock. Less than six hours until he would go over to Sherlock, and give him his birthday present. By that time it would nearly be a day late, but at least he could see him before he went off to boarding school later that day.
No wonder Sherlock didn’t want him.
“John, ignore him. You’re not a target simply for being with me, or without me.” Sherlock adjusted his cuffs. “Paranoia helps no one. Mycroft, you need to leave.”
“Because you were! You are!”
He arrived on Friday night with a bag and a laptop case, grunting hello to Mycroft before beaming at John, and almost going for a hug before thinking better of it and offering a hand, instead.
Sherlock shrugged. “It is what it is.”
“Hello.”
“Another presentation blood test,” William rolled his eyes. “Waste of my time.”
Sherlock’s pale hand was bloody. And worse, the back of it was swelling, and his thumb… was not pointing the right way. And neither were his middle and ring fingers.
