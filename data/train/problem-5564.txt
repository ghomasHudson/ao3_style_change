"You might want to sit for this. It isn't good."
"They're coming." He squeaked, getting to his feet.
"I'm guessing you're in charge? I hope the meals are better then the sleeping arrangements."
"Attention, all SHIELD agents. This is Steve Rogers. A lot of you may know me as Captain America and I've been working here along side you for several months. I think it's time you know the truth though. I've been here undercover, working with my team. SHIELD is not what we thought it was, it's been taken over by Hydra. Alexander Pierce is their leader. The Strike team is Hydra as well. I don't know how many more, but I know they're in the building and we plan on putting an end to this. I request that those of you who are SHIELD, honest and true, get out of the building as soon as you can. We don't want casualties we can prevent. For Strike and those of you who are Hydra, we are coming and we won't stop until this is over."
"I'm sorry Steve. I can't promise we'll find him, but we won't stop looking until we do. The only good thing that came out of this, was that we won."
"When am I not?"
"It's okay kid. We'll get out of here. I promise."
"Alright. We ready to go?"
That earned a laugh and Sam nodded to Clint. "Yeah, go ahead and make a plate. I'll go get Stark and ya'll can explain what's going on."
"And what's this plan of yours?"
"I promise."
"What are you even doing out of bed? You could barely walk yesterday."
Loki let out a shaky sigh at that. This man Tony was sure would save them, thought Tony was strong. That meant Tony would be okay, right?
By the end of dinner, facts were exchanged and everything was laid out on the table, so to speak. The thumb drive was slid across the table from Nat to Tony as Clint collected the dishes.
"What's next?"
"Right. He's going to be fine. This is Tony. He and Rhodes saved the president."
So he agreed to try and try he did.
They hit the ground, sprawled out as the gun Bucky had been using flew across the floor with Steve's shield. He scrambled to his feet and tackled into Bucky before he could get back up. He remembered the beating he received the last they fought. He remembered every punch and sting of pain. He wasn't going to let that happen again. Or he was going to try. He needed to knock Bucky out as soon as he could and just drag him out of there.
Steve's breath hitched a moment. There was no way that Tony had gotten information about Bucky already, right? "Did you find anything?"
"It's a joke, from a Batman-- never mind. In the movie he's listening in to phones and whatnot to find the bad guy. I'm not doing that but I am having JARVIS keep an eye on our list. If any of them tweet, text, email or call with that word, he'll notify us."
"Lunch. With my mother and my brother." It was the exact same thing he told Tony. "I was supposed to have lessons with my mother in the afternoon but I was tired. I napped and then I was in the cell."
"Yeah...Well...I'm walking and talking. That's what matters right?"
Without warning, he grabbed Loki's hand and slipped the watch onto his wrist.
He was so in awe that he didn't see the man with the strange weapon approach him. His arm was grabbed and he let out a cry as he was hauled up only for the man to suddenly still. He started falling back, an arrow sticking out of his chest and Loki fell back.
that Steve found it hard to breathe.
Once it had returned to it's compact version, he chucked it through the bars and into the other cell where the guards would have to look for it if they wanted to put it back on.
Steve was still chuckling when JARVIS stopped the elevator on the workshop floor. Stepping out into the expansive room, he realized that the workshop wasn't a floor he'd ever really visited before. The labs he remembered. The communal floor. The floor with all of their rooms on it. The training room, the gyms. He remembered all those but the workshop he never bothered to come see. Tony always brought his upgrades to him, never the other way around. He pictured something more chaotic, messy, like in the movies but Tony's workshop was surprisingly neat with the exception of a couple desks where he had parts strewn all over.
Strucker stepped aside and Tony's eyes widened. There, strapped to the contraption that erased his memories, was Loki's scepter. Loki's
A shout rang out in the moment of silence and Loki's head snapped up. Staring off in the distance he could see lights and movement. Oh no.
"You really are an all American Boy Scout aren't you?"
Steve grit his teeth, biting back a curse. He wasn't cleared for active duty and no matter how many times he said he was okay and could fight, the others disagreed. They argued that he needed a break. He needed to relax. But being left behind while Natasha, Clint and Sam methodically went through the Hydra bases located in the states was driving him nuts. He didn't like being stationary. It left him with pent up energy.
" when the sound of a something hard smacking into side of Bucky's head reached his ears and suddenly he could breathe. The weight was off him and his neck had been freed. He heard it again as he sucked in a ragged breath and then Tony was in his field of vision. There were hands on his face, warm brown eyes looking into his with concern.
It must have been days later when something happened. The guards had a regular schedule to come check on him but for a while there was nothing. A few times, when the guards
Steve chuckled as both of their calls ended and he picked up his phone. Camp Lehigh was a good place to arrive at after weeks of waiting. He could confront Zola tomorrow with less risk of being blown up this time and push them even closer to their desired result.
"I think I made it just in time." Was the breathless reply as Steve joined him and he paused in his work to fix the other man with an amused smile. Steve was looking at him with a worried expression, eyes flicking over his form to catalog injuries which might have made him feel all warm and fuzzy on the inside.
"He's been taken by Hydra."
"Alright. Ya'll wanna explain what's going on? Cause, not that I'm not flattered getting a call to save Tony Stark from the terminator or anything but you didn't really explain anything about what was going on when we were on the phone Steve."
He sucked in a breath and waited for Steve's speech to end. Steve was here. They were taking their plan into action now. This was it. He needed to act now. Once Steve's speech was over, he watched the guard fidget, like he didn't know what to do. The secret was out and no orders were coming in. Once he was sure the other wasn't paying attention, he struck. Jumping to his feet, he struck the guard in the back of his head and watched him crumple to the ground.
"Down the hall under guard. He isn't talking though but he hasn't made any attempts to escape or deny himself medical treatment."
"Why are you in DC?"
Like the one that stopped the hydra!
"So those helicarriers can't afford to get off the ground. From the information we have, there is months to go before they're ready but getting rid of them as soon as possible is the best idea. Where are the helicarriers located?"
The man just listened, hands behind his back. He actually looked sort of amused.
Using that split second where the man was distracted, Tony's other hand quickly tapped at his watch to get his glove activated. There was the familiar sound of the repulsor coming to life Tony brought his hand up to use the ultrasonic pulse. It was enough to disorient the assassin to the point of letting go and for good measure, he quickly switched to the flash to blind the other so he had a few extra seconds to scramble away.
"How much do you remember?"
Another look and one by one, they filtered out. Bruce first, telling him that he was glad he was awake, followed by a relieved looking Sam. Clint though. Clint paused and he looked angry. It wasn't directed at him, that much he could tell but if they'd won, why was he angry? Natasha gently sent him on his way before pulling her chair up.
"No--"
"What the hell are you doing here Stark?"
Knowing what he did though didn't get him anywhere if he didn't know what to do with it.
"His father actually. Howard. The resemblance is uncanny though."
Her gaze was piercing. Thoughtful. Like she knew he was lying but couldn't figure out why he would. It was a look he found himself missing. Then she let out a soft laugh and shook her head.
"We're going to get him back Steve." It was Clint, new glove on his hand with the new quiver he remembered Tony talking about a couple days ago. It looked good and knowing Tony, he put a lot of thought behind it. He remembered Clint's advanced one, that Tony would make in a couple years. "No man left behind right?"
When the doors to the elevator opened and she was standing with her arms crossed and an amused little smile on her face, he was sure his heart stopped. For a moment he'd forgotten where he was because suddenly he was back on the compound, suited up and ready to make the trip to get the stones. Each of them having their own mission. She was going with Clint. She was getting the Soul Stone. She gave him a little smile--
Again, shout out to a random unknown, Uko_chan, Madlenita, Bunnyc, TwoPHDsandaMillionQuestions, ncdoppalapudi, Emerald and Ceisya for the comments and words of encouragement. I've never been so motivated to write something as I am to write this so thanks again for all of your interest in reading this!
He stared at it. Knew, deep down, that it was important and then slipped it into his pocket before he was back to work without them knowing. When he was dragged back to his cell late in the evening, he curled up against the far wall and tried to remember his mantra.
"Kinda nice. Mind if I call you Steve? Only fair." And there was that all too familiar smile, where Tony's lips pulled up more to one side with an uncertain glint to his eyes.
"Thanks." Sam breathed out, rubbing a sore jaw. "What should we do with him?"
"How else?"
"I'd disagree with you but...there's something to your story."
The watch on his arm then started to beep and Loki looked down at it.
The entire drive to Sam's house was stressful and when they arrived, he immediately went looking for Tony.
SHIELD would."
There.
"JARVIS?"
"Do you know which one?"
"This one? This one can stay down here--"
It was a new voice this time. It wasn't as calm but it had an air of authority to it. This one was more like his mother. Gentle yet stern.
"Yeah yeah. You guys can crash here. Bruce and Steve already have a room picked out so if the doors not locked, it's yours."
"About our super secret side project--"
taking no for an answer. When Loki took off and I came to? He gave a lot of threats, none that I took to heart and neither did Thor but there was something about him... It didn't sit well with me. And have you seen that strike force? Red flags." Steve watched Tony rub at his chest, probably out of habit before he shook his head. "It isn't just that either. The weapons on the helicarrier? The--the fact that I didn't even get a call when this was going down? The president was at risk and they didn't even bat an eye at it. Why?"
He wanted to hold on, stay awake like Tony wanted but he didn't have the strength to and found himself drifting into the dark.
"I thought you were going to help Tony!"
The sabretooth stirred, and Tony swallowed, wondering if he should just run for it.  But what if Rogers was nearby?  He couldn’t abandon him.  Rogers would have done the same, right?
Tony laughs, taking the ring out.  “Yeah.  I don’t know.  I think maybe she wanted me to remember that she’s just as rich and smart as me.  This is her way of putting me in my place.”  He offers the ring to Steve, then holds out his hand.  “Put it on.”
“I’m very much a self-made woman,” Sunset tells him the day they first meet, and Tony finds himself hopelessly smitten.  And it’s strange, he thinks, because he’s not entirely sure if he should be falling so hard for someone who doesn’t seem to be immediately connected to his words, but here he is anyway, head over heels.  He’d try and sneak notes off her if he could to compare the handwriting, but she never writes anything in front of him, only types away on her portable computer.
But alright.  Whatever.  If Steve doesn’t want to talk, Tony will
He sighed, rubbing his forehead.  S.H.I.E.L.D. owed him big time for all of this.  “So,” he said after a moment.  “Me or you first?”
He stops cold, causing Steve to stumble when he tries to move without him, backing away a few steps and shaking his head.  “We have to go back,” Tony says.
Before Tony could decide, Birch made the choice for him, continuing on.  "She could see enough to know both that there was no future for me, but that there was still a future for you."  He drummed his fingers idly against his lap, gazing away before focusing back on Tony.  "It was an unpleasant truth.  But I realized that you could have a future and still be ruined.  So here we are now."
Tony can’t hold back anymore.  Wordlessly, he throws himself forward, wrapping his arms tight around Steve as he kisses him for all he’s worth—and Ty, Sunset, Howard,
True to his word, he kept a fair distance behind Steve as he prowled, sniffing the air and doing other cat things that Tony couldn’t comprehend.  It was, to his surprise, all very boring.  He had no idea how to hunt—only to avoid being hunted.  And given that Steve couldn’t speak, he couldn’t tell what the hell it was he was actually looking for.
"Kid like that shouldn't have had to give anyone sutures."
It was hard to express all that without making it more obvious that he didn't belong, though, so he held his tongue.  "Sure," he said instead.
at me,” Howard repeats, grabbing him by the shoulders and gripping him painfully hard, and finally Tony lifts his head, meeting his eyes.  “I
"Yes," said Captain America.
, the biggest military lackey of them all.  And Tony didn’t like it.
A laugh bubbles out of Tony like he’s some sort of teenaged schoolgirl, and for a moment, he forgets about all the shit that went down in the past couple of weeks.  “Idiot,” he says.  “Get into my bed.”
His eyes went wide.
Eventually, he does, and it’s the last thing he expects to see—there Tony is, staring listlessly out at the sea and looking as morose as he did on the night they first met.  What happened?  Before he can open his mouth to call out to him, though, Tony’s gaze shifts, and their eyes meet—but instead of waving or smiling or
So that means no.
If Tony was blushing before,He didn't even know what he was now “Thanks captain…” His voice was nearly above above a whisper.
Tony stared at her for a long moment before nodding  “What's wrong kiddo?”
Fury turned in the direction of the pen as it clattered against the ground,Stopping abruptly in the middle of his sentence.He looked at it for a moment his eyes flickering to where they sit before he picked it up.Willow quickly took the opportunity to walk over to Bruce and grab the flash drive,putting her figure to her mouth once more to empathize how important it was that they remain silent.She quickly went back to her original position,Fury never taking notice of the young girl.
But that was Tony Stark's problem to deal with. And right now he was IronMan. And he had a job to do.
“Captain rogers sir,How may may I assist you?” The computer greeted.He would never get used to Jarvis would he?
Bruce shook his head “Nope.Why would we be mad?” He took a moment to think “Ohh,because back then…” He trailed off “It's alright to be bisexual,Gay,whatever you wanna be”
Tony quickly turned around to meet her gaze,Shock written all over his face “How did you-”
Willow chuckled “Willow”
“What are you doing here?” His tone was harsh but it wasn't as bad as it was when he spoke to her.Tony couldn't help but smile.
Bruce paused his writing for a moment before chuckling,an edge to his laughter  “What's wrong kid? Think I'm gonna hulk-out on you over a chemical equation?” She took note of how he seemed to put more pressure on the pen as he spoke.
Tony groaned as he walked down the hallway debrief was horrible.As soon as fury saw the bandage he went on to ask about it and to say the least it ended with everyone nagging Tony to get it stitched up.And of course he wasn't going to listen to them.He was many things and one of them was stubborn as hell.
It was only after he tore his eyes away from the blood, which had now reached his suit, did he notice Jarvis' frantic requests for him to speak. He took a steadying breath “I'm okay J, I'm okay”. He allowed himself a minute to gather his bearings “Captain?” He hesitantly asked, having not yet fully recovered from the inner turmoil of confusion and disgust which had settled in his gut.
He bet Deus ex machina was making these goddamn things cause they looked like they came out of a horror movie.
Ok so now that this is cleared up I wanted to create a vote on whether or not I should do a rewrite for the story.If I do have a rewrite I will include little bonus stories and what if's that just sit in my docs.If I don't do a rewrite then I will just continue the series as it is.Please tell me what you think I should do in the comments and I will do my best to make this the best story I can make it to be.
Tony frowned Slightly in confusion when he heard Steve chuckle “What's so funny?”
She giggled again “You get it back if you can catch me!” She quickly ran out almost bumping into a developer who had managed to stop in time and let her pass before him.Tony smirked as he watched her run off before chasing after her knocking  down some paperwork off one of the tables “My bad!” He yelled not stopping.He could apologize more formally later.
Natasha frowned in confusion “These guys obviously don't want to be found so why now?They leave no trace of who they could be but leave us a hard drive?”
“In shock of what? Willow being a brilliant actor?” He quipped back.
“Yep that's totally true”
IM SO SORRY!!!! I'm really sorry guys that this is later then usual but I wanted to edit this chapter to the best of my ability but I hope you like it and I know that the first few chapters are pretty slow but I promise that in future chapters I will fix that.Anyway I hope you guys enjoy!!
“I can't do it!” Was his response,Throwing his hands up in the air to show that he was done with the conversation.
Tony could only sigh in defeat as he watched the super soldier walk away.
“Are you picking up pepper?”
Tony didn't tear his gaze away from steve’s “Alright cap….”
Steve glared at him.“Tony stark-”
Bruce nodded,Giving Willow a look of confusion as she quickly ran up to the exit “I'm gonna go get some water for everyone!”
Tony sighed there was no getting out or this was there? “We’ll go together ok,So I can prove it to you.He’s probably in his lab right now,we'll go there first” She nodded in agreement as he lead her to Bruce’s lab.He was gonna be so pissed at him for bringing a kid but fuck it his day might as well get worse.
She returned the smile “Yep”
He didn't have the heart to ask him their chance of winning if the game was a rigged one.
“Hey,it's nice to see you’ve been well” She paused for a moment “How did you...do that?”
“It's good you two got her here in time,Any longer and i don't think she would be alive” The doctor stated as looked into the room.The doctor seemed to be a young man,Maybe in his twenties or early thirties.He had brown hair and had worn both blue pants and a blue t-shirt along with a mask and gloves to match.In his hand he held a clipboard that seemed to have some sort of information on it.
“You're right on time,I wanted to give you an update on some of my recent findings” Bruce stated blankly too focused on his research.
A beat of silence. “Did you come into contact with hostiles?”
It looked nothing like the creature that he helped to fight on the battlefield.
She sighed “No rest for the weary” She reassured him with a smirk “I just have to deal with some paperwork.That's all”
“Clint, Tony” Natasha growled, “The mission if you would”. Clint muttered a quick apology while Tony grumbled a swift ‘yes yes I know’. As he continued down the narrow corridor it became more and more apparent that there was a strange noise (tapping?), Probably muddled from the buildings weird acoustics, being made somewhere deeper inside of the structure. Tony stopped for a moment, to see if it was him making the noise, but as the tapping continued he realized it couldn't have been him.
“Yep”
“That-” Bruce walked up to the animal “-Is what was under all the metal”
“Hell no I don't wanna tell her what it means!” Clint quickly yelled.
“What the hell is sex?”
“What it with you and all the old jokes?” He chuckled as she stuck out her tongue and shrugged in response.
This time willow was the one to answer him “Yep,Sure some people disagree with it,but it's completely fine”
She turned to him her expression blank as If she didn't recognize him for a moment but offered a tired smile “Oh sorry…” She turned to gaze at the chair in front of her letting her smile drop completely as she set her gaze downward and Resting her head in her hand,similar to a gesture Tony found himself doing when a negotiation wasn't going the way he wanted it to.She didn't look like her usual joyful self,She looked tired,Stressed,she looked like him…..
He just hopped that every single time he walked away,he would always be able to return.
She looked back to face Tony motioning for him to come closer to the hospital bed.Tony made no objections as he did what was wanted of him walking up to her hospital bed,slightly surprised when she tapped twice on his faceplate.
It was now Natasha’s turn to be confused “late for what?”
Steve sighed as he walked out of the room.
“The second question I can’t answer and apparently it was originally a type of fox”
Steve chuckled “Alright,Oh and Tony-”
“Yes”
The drive back to the tower was calm,the conversation was comprised of mostly Tony answering peppers questions to the best of his ability and filling her in on what she had missed along with questions of how happy and how Rhodey were doing (Rhodey had been on an overseas mission while happy was on vacation)
“Tony found a girl during the mission,She was hurt pretty badly” Natasha finally explained.
“You promise?”
“Do you think she might have saw something?” Tony suddenly thought aloud taking everyone off guard “Like Natasha said,she was hurt pretty badly.So is there a possibility that her injuries were result of a attempt to get rid of a witness?” They all remained silent as they took his proposition into consideration.
She stepped away from the door “I will be in the nurses station if you need anything.And if you can,please make this as quick as possible we want to run some tests on her before she can sleep again”
Steve returned the glare “You don't swear when there's a child right there!” He pointed to Willow who watched the dispute unravel.
Steve nodded “Yes sir”
They all stood up Tony taking longer than the others still lost in his thoughts.He sighed as he stood slightly surprised when he noticed Steve was standing beside the door watching him intently “Something wrong cap?”
Natasha took a moment to nod in a agreement “Yeah”
He quickly looked up as he felt an arm placed on his shoulder,his gaze met with the bright blue of steve eyes as if reading his mind Steve quickly began to reassure him “Tony,don't get frustrated over what we don't know yet,Like you said We’ll find whoever did this and we'll find that girls family,ok?”
“That wasn't cool kid”
“I don't think we have enough time” Bruce said through gritted teeth earning a determined glance from her.
“Yes, I did but…” His gaze lowered back to the bodies “Those bullets weren't meant for me”.
“I was taking off my suit” Tony responded blankly,Trying to rid his mind of why that damn suit was even made,The fucking piece of metal in his damn chest,And how it was even put there in the first place.He sighed as he placed his hand on his arm gripping it tightly “so what did I miss?”
“Yeah its it's a thing I do sometimes,I usually think faster than my mouth can move, Either that or my mouth moves faster than my thoughts” She stated resting her head on the table “Either that or I'm stuttering and if I'm not voicing my thoughts than I'm over thinking,And if I'm not over thinking that I'm just regular thinking.It’s a chain.I think you get my point.You know in Brooklyn I don't think I've ever ment someone with the last name Myers there and my last last name is bonnet,So that's saying a lot”
He calmly placed the flash drive back down on the desk “They're trying to see what we're capable of,And they've made it into some sort of game.Three times they've sent these things lose of the city and each time we've managed to successfully complete the mission,So this-” He motioned to the flash drive “Is either another test or-”
“Jarvis time?”
Steve sighed “Just don't tell Tony alright”
Both Tony and Steve shared confused and shocked expressions.Steve stared at the sketchbook in hand “Do you think that was…” As if reading his mind Tony quickly nodded.He seemed to stare into space for a moment before he began to walk away. “Where are you going?” Steve watched as tony paused mid step not turning to face him. “I'm going to find out when she got here and where they put her,captain” He continued walking wondering why he wasn't informed on the topic,Hell,he didn't even know if she was alive!
Tony rolled his eyes in response but there was a smiling tugging at the corner of his lips “Yeah,I suppose I did,but I'm getting you back”
And Tony was falling.
Tony sighed he knew exactly what a slip up like that could do,He would die.But did it really fucking matter? “Yeah,yeah I know I should always have my guard up so I don't get my throat ripped out by those creatures,blah,blah,blah,I learned my lesson”
Clint cleared his throat in order to gain their attention “We heard the entire conversation from out here and so,I think what Natasha means is since when the hell did you get mom instincts?”
He quickly ran out of the room looking around for a moment before running down the corridor that led to the elevator.Inside of it Willow waved before pointing up and clicking a button.She smiled smugly as Tony ran towards the elevator but it quickly closed before he could reach it “Hey,No fair!”
Fury seemed to quickly snap back to reality “What compels you to ask that?”
“Suicide?” Natasha asked nonchalant yet attentive, reading the situation like a book.
“Like I said the files are so easy to gain access too,and if I'm being totally honest-” She banged her elbow against the table,Making them jump slightly in surprise,Especially when they heard something hit the ground.She leaned to the side taking a glance of the floor underneath the table smirking as she swiftly got out of her seat and picked something up “Pfft,This is where I put all the files I don't finish” She howled with laughter as Fury shot her a disapproving look and took the file away from her,More gently than Tony thought he would.
Tony was gradually surprised when he realized the elevator had gotten to this floor at the exact same time as him,Was he really going that fast or was the elevator going slow...Eh he’ll look into it later.He snapped out of his thoughts when he saw a small figure dash out of the now open elevator doors.
“But-”
She lifted her head back up,Obviously uncomfortable with the situation but better from when he asked the last question “Oh,you mean Ms.Smith?She was the lady assigned to take care of me”
“...Oh shit sorry Steve!” He quickly backed away from the other man.
Tony took a moment to glance at Natasha who was smiling at the scene in front of them and shot a amused look at Steve who returned the same gesture.Fury stared down at her for a long moment before hesitantly (More like awkwardly) Wrapping her in a tight (loose*) embrace.After a few moments he pulled away from a very happy Willow (Even Though the hug wasn't really that good) “Alright,Consider the job done Mr.Fury!”
“Maybe” Came Natasha’s plain response.
I'm not dead I promise! I just had some end of the year tests and I lost some of my inspiration for this series but I'm back on track and also HAPPY BIRTHDAY MY STARK SON!!!! But as always I hope you guys enjoy this chapter and I hop you have a good day!
She sighed as she opened her mouth to say something but closed it as they both heard a loud scream of joy “OH MY GOSH ARE YOU THE PEPPER POTTS?! Can I get a photo with you?! Also can you tell me what Tony's like,You're sooo lucky to know him personally!” Tony glanced in the direction of the voice cursing under his breath as he saw a small crowd form around Pepper.He looked to Willow who watched the small group form,Frowning sympathetically and nervously.
Wait,Was he being serious?
He turned his attention back to Willow “That still doesn't answer what you were doing with it”
She smirked “Override code,plus he's nice”
Bruce nodded “Bingo.It ended up as everyone arguing in how to read whatever was written on the computer,some sort of code”
She cocked her head to the side “What do you mean by ‘hulk-out’?”
?-H     |-Z
“How do you know peppers last name?” Clint asked playfully.
Tony chuckled “Give me an example of a large group of people criticizing something”
Tony stared at her for a moment “So then why did you say all that and seem like you were about to die of anxiety?”
Willow just nodded “Yep.I'll explain later but right now it's 6:20 which means Tony has to go pick up Ms.Potts ”
“Men work in confusing ways” Thor stated to no one in particular,making,In his own way a valid argument.
“When-how did you even afford them?”
They were just like the creators outside.
Tony looked down to the blue blue prints scattered across the table “Oh nothing really,Just….trying to find some answers”
“How did you-”
“I mean basically, except for the fact that it's not lead in pencils”
“What's with the bandage around your arm?” Willow quickly questioned.
Steve nodded “Yeah…Aren't you guys mad?”
“Yep!” Willow threw a jacket at him (More specifically his jacket which was also gonna ask how she got that too) it landing on his head “Common tin man we gotta move!” He couldn't help but chuckle at the nick name.
“Guys it's fine,I could always just search it up,Is it an object,cause I could look at photos-”
“Aww,But I just took it off”
“Of course not”
“Whoa kid easy,it's just me” He reached out a hand,ready to steady her if she was dizzy from getting up so quickly.
There stood Willow waving sheepishly,a smile to match “Hey…”
----oooooooooo0000000ooooooooooooo----
Bruce shrugged “Well it's something toxic as hell cause it's been leaking radiation ever since it was put on that table”
: -c     $-U
Tony thought it over for a moment but ultimately decided it would be best to continue “I can't.”
“We heard the gunshots as well” Steve reassured.
She rolled her eyes “Please,I doubt that,Besides if I were to make quotes it would be insulting something”
"No, Captain. I had no idea."
"Did you talk to Fury about it?"
"Copy. We'll make our way to the elevator-- Tony let's go."
"C'mon Stark! Stop making eyes at Cap and order some pizza already!"
"No. It makes sense. I promise. Please."
So did Bucky.
"You said that already--"
"Yes. Please. Play it."
"Yeah, yeah of course."
He laughed at the reference and jogged around to the other side, getting in behind the driver as Clint settled in next to him.
Tony fixed him with a little frown before tentatively nodding. He shot a look towards to Bucky before running towards the elevator behind him. He kept running even when Bucky moved to grab him but Steve was there, slamming into him bodily before he could even touch the billionaire.
Before Steve could comment on the fact that Bucky actually used his name and before Bucky could finish his sentence, Clint popped his head into the room, knocking after they'd both already seen him.
"Are.You.Getting.In." A slender eyebrow went up and she just stared him like he'd gone senile. "Did you forget where you were old man?"
A shield!
It wasn't.
"Hey, kid." He offered but the boy stayed in his corner. Tony let out a little sigh and gestured to his mouth. "That thing, must be pretty annoying to have it in all the time huh?" How were they even feeding this kid?
"Aye aye Captain."
When Steve opened his eyes, he found that he was no longer in the small, run down motel room that he'd fallen asleep in the night before. It was still dark, the sun barely peeking in through his window but it was enough for him to see and what he saw caused him to frown in his half asleep state. It wasn't the motel he fell asleep in because this was his apartment. Not the one he had after Thanos snapped away a half of the population but the one he had in DC.
"Past tense."
"Stark."
"You are correct. You are a smart man--"
"He said that Bucky was still alive." Tony's eyebrows went up but Steve trucked on before Tony could dismiss the idea. He knew that Bucky was still alive but the Steve that was supposed to be there wouldn't have known with absolute certainty. He had to sell this. "I know I know. It was probably just Loki pretending to be me but how would he have known Tony? Buck was my best friend growing up, my best friend in the war and I
"We'll deal with it later!"
In the end, Natasha and Clint stared at the three of them like they'd lost their minds.
He believed in them.
"Look who's judging Starks work now Nat."
"Night Natasha." Tony offered another smile as the line died and leaned back just a fraction. "See? What'd I tell you?"
He didn't know who Cap was or who this man was but he was safe and safe was good.
Tony jerked awake from the sleep he was in. Blinking sleep out of his eyes, he sat up and looked around in the dark. The digital alarm clock Steve had on the nightstand told him it was just after three in the morning and he rubbed a hand over his face. What pulled him out of his sleep? He was nightmare free and before he'd gone to bed, he'd actually felt a little exhausted. This should have a been an eight hour uninterrupted sleep sort of night.
"Keep the doors open J."
"He's unsettling."
He wanted to laugh. He really just wanted to laugh. They wanted an Iron Man suit? Of course they did. Why wouldn't they. It was Hammer, all over again, and the government. Well no. The government officials that had been trying to get their grummy mitts on his armor were Hydra so he was just making circles. He wanted to tell the man to stick it. He wasn't going to make them a suit but--
"Cap-- Shit-- Stay awake."
"About that-- Tony."
"You could say that. I'm going to check on Tony."
"And those are cause for concern why?"
Standing there staring at the watch, the chill started to get to him so he walked on, trudging through the snow.
"I thought it was your day off man."
"You thought you'd have better luck coming all the way down here in person unannounced?"
All eyes turned on him and if he'd been a younger, more uncertain leader, he would have shrank under the scrutiny. In the last week they'd done research, he never once mentioned who it was and for good reason. He didn't want any of them worried he was digging up some past vendetta against a group that no one had heard word of since he went into the ice. He didn't need them worried that he was looking for a war that wasn't there. Steve could see it on all their faces.
Sure he could do the missions themselves just fine but it took every inch of his self control not punch Rumlow and his strike team in the faces whenever left in a room with them. It was hard not to dangle Sitwell out of a window whenever their paths crossed. Every fiber of his being wanted to take apart everything there with his bare hands but he couldn't. He knew he couldn't. He didn't have enough evidence against them yet. He would soon though, he could feel it.
Tony pulled up his tablet and let out a soft hum. He didn't look at all surprised. Then he turned it towards Steve so he could see. "These AIM employees left shortly after the incident with the Mandarin. Notice where they all went?"
"What?"
His grip on the phone tightened. "
"Stark? Why?"
"Holy shit, is that Stark?"
The images were still unsettling. Scenes of himself in the war, the founding images of Peggy and Howard when they first started SHIELD, Red Skull, Hydra. Natasha and Clint were seeing it for the first time. This here was everything they knew and believed in falling apart around them.
"This was what JARVIS found? Impossible. This technology is ancient."
The cold didn't bother him too much, neither did the dark. He was a little chilled but that was always the extent of it. He never had to bundle up much when they went somewhere cold, not like Thor who whined and griped about, telling him that he was lucky the cold didn't bother him as much as it did others.
"Sam, go with Hill and sabotage the third helicarrier. Take out anyone firing at you. I'm going to help Tony. Keep an eye out for Rumlow and Winter Soldier. Take Rumlow out but do no engage the soldier."
I feel like this one was a little shorter but that might just be me. I took a couple liberties with Zola from the movie and changed up the dialogue to match.
Slipping out of bed, he grabbed his phone and silently stepped into the hall. He tapped his watched and pulled his glove over hand, letting the armor slide into place. "Steve?" He hissed, slowly approaching the living room. There was another thud, the sound of something hitting the carpet from the table and Tony paused, weighing his options. If Steve was getting his super powered ass kicked in the next room what good would he be with just one little glove and no suit?

Brown eyes rolled and they fixed Steve with an amused look.
The sounds of footsteps approaching had Loki scooting closer to him out of fear over anything. A guard stopped at his cell, holding a plate of actually decent looking food. He looked at Loki, his mouth guard off, then at Tony before looking at the one plate. There was a shrug before he slid it through the bars and walked off. Lovely. Walking over, he grabbed it and sat down.
"Not yet. I was getting ready to."
in bed and
walk past, they talked about what was happening. Something about a hydra and shield. Were they in charge of such a beast? He read about them once, none had been seen in a long time but what if they had one and this shield? A man with a shield maybe? Had taken it down. He must have been a strong warrior to do so and maybe this was why they were so scattered. Their beast was gone and now they had no creature to protect them.
The small, sad smile Tony wore made him wish he hadn't pressed.
That caught their attention.
"That...that sounds familiar."
"Jane informs me you have news?"
But someone was missing.
"You're not asking. I'm offering. It's you guys against an entire organisation. From the way I see it, you can use all the help you can get."
"You're okay. You're okay." Tony watched Steve let out a shaky breath, repeating the mantra to himself softly. Hesitantly, he reached out to run his fingers through the blonds hair, damp with sweat. Pepper had done it for him a couple times when he was still suffering with night terrors after New York. He remembered how comforting it was just having someone there to keep him grounded and with how easily Steve relaxed into the touch, it seemed to have the same effect on Steve.
"Why not? Use it before I lose it right?"
"No I--"
"You're hesitant." The Ancient One spoke, looking at him knowingly when he had yet to leave from the roof; to use his suit and the particles to return to 2023. He knew he should go. He had Bucky back and Sam. Thor was getting better, Banner was happy. Clint and Wanda were coping with the loss of Natasha. The world was in pieces still and he knew there was a lot of work to be done, there were people waiting for him to come back so...why didn't he want to leave?
"We should have been here. One of us should have stayed behind. This shouldn't have happened Nat."
"It's fine Tony. I promise." Steve got up, ushering Tony down the hall to where his little room was. He helped get him set up with the shower and found some clothes that would relatively fit him for the night before letting Tony get settled. He lied out on the couch as best as he could, tucking his arms against his chest. He'd be sore in the morning but it was worth it for the peace of mind; knowing that Tony was safe in the next room.
Several hours and a handful of car games later, they were pulling up to the old camp. Steve couldn't help the wave of nostalgia he felt coming here, even on the fourth time around between timelines. He hadn't spent much time here but what little he did was an experience he would never forget, whether it was training to be a soldier in the war or sneaking around with Tony to steal the tesseract.
Steve ignored them both, stopping in front of the shelf that hid the elevator. He shifted the grip on his shield and pulled it aside, listening to it squeal across the floor until the doors were uncovered.
But when Tony stopped working, sitting up a little straighter before turning to look at him, Steve was floored again. His surgery was just over a month ago and from what he'd read, it was a difficult and long procedure. Tony showed no signs of having been in surgery. He looked in good health, if a little tired no doubt from working himself too hard.
He could use this to his advantage. If they let him near tech, he could do something to get them help. To get Steve word where he was or to make something to get them out of there. As long as he could get his hands on something he could build, they had a chance.
Hello Avengers it seems that you have managed to hack into our system.Either you are smarter than we thought you were or you got help from outside sources but we could not care either way.I think you understand our motives but if you do not more fun for us.I know you are probably annoyed that this is not any information but since you have worked so hard to get this message I’ll make sure your hard work was not all for nothing.Right now there is a weapon on your perimeter and somewhere in your tower.You might also want to know that it will detonate once the clock hits 7:00 good luck not dying.
The first thing Loki realized when he came to was that he was not in his room in Asgard anymore. The grand room with the over sized bed and his desk with all of his reading material were gone. Instead he was in a little cell with nothing but a pillow and a blanket. There was something attached to his mouth and he couldn't figure out how to work it. His fingers couldn't tell where the catches were. The shirt he was wearing was over sized, tattered and old and there was a lack of pants. Where were his clothes?
Ending the recording, he grabbed the roomba he had been fixing earlier and pried it open to stick the phone in before setting it back down. Then he hid Sam's laptop just in case between the mattress before slipping out into the hall. By the time he'd made it to the living room, Rumlow was breaking through the front door.
Still he kept moving.
"Accidents happen." Steve narrowed his eyes at the monitor, staring at Howard's face; the brief images of the Winter Soldier and what they implied. It had taken him so long to piece it all together and in the end, he never even told Tony. "Speaking of Stark. I must thank you Captain."
Clint looked at Natasha who was plucking up Tony's thumb drive and fiddled with the pack at his side. "Blow it to hell?"
"Shit--" He gasped as he unbuckled and landed on his arm. Slow, careful steps in the glass outside told him that Hydra's little attack dog was coming around to his door and he scrambled to the other side, pulling himself out of the broken window. Adrenaline was the only thing pushing him to his feet and he popped his head over the bottom of the car to see where his attacker went.
"Shapeshifting and all that? You can do that?"
"Wouldn't it be beneficial to provide for everyone on a larger scale? You could provide all of SHIELD with the most advanced weapons this world has ever seen, instead of repulsor tech that you purposely left vital information out of so we can't weaponize it like you do."
As always, a big big thank you to Larrys_Consulting_Avenger, TheCalmDisco, pxrplegrxpe, baka_yu, travelfan1346, SofiaMichelle, Chrsfrthwckd and levana84  for all of your comments. I liked reading the speculations from the first chapter!
Big thanks to Madlenita, Ceisya (also aww, you're a sweetie! <3), SofiaMichelle, Zoran1390, matomato, MarvelSteveTony, eh (great name anonymous, btw lol), slightly_salty_ace (well hello again!) and Daydreamer_Nightthinker for all your comments! Only a couple more chapters for the first part of this series left guys! Things are going to get crazy!
"The last one is at Fort Meade, behind three guarded gates and a twelve-inch steel wall."
"Uh huh."
"Where am I? What year is it--- T-Tony?" That look was back on his face. Tony remembered seeing it months ago, when Steve first showed up in his workshop asking for his help. He was looking at Tony like he was surprised he was alive, like he was awed by his presence here or was looking at a ghost. Sometimes he wore the same expression when looking at Natasha.
"That's the one"
What did he know about Loki? He had to remember. He was a trickster god but not...but not completely like the mythology. He didn't know much mythology anyways. He could turn himself into things! That's right. He'd seen it! He knows he's seen it.
"Camp Lehigh."
"Sure did."
"Report on that base"
"Tony, before you look at that, there's something I want to talk to you about."
"Steve--"
"Shut up, shut up, shut up!"
Steve works on getting help to expose Hydra. Little by little his plan starts to come together and he sees a glimpse of what his team could have been.
"Do you guys hear yourselves? You think Hydra infiltrated SHIELD!"
Steve nodded, fiddling around with the phone. It was brand new. Tony just replaced his old one hours ago when he lost it in the attack. For now he'd hold onto it just in case. He would hate for Tony to have to replace the phone twice in less than two days.
Because the thing was, if Tony was being completely honest with himself, he didn't actually have all that many friends.  Sure, he had a lot of acquaintances - guys high-fived him in the hallways; girls batted their lashes at him in the hopes he'd take them out to fondue.  And
Steve had
When they finally emerge on deck minutes, hours, days later—Steve isn’t even sure of the time anymore—Tony is in good spirits, arm wrapped around him without a care in the world as they let the cool air wash over them.  He giggles at some scandalized passengers staring at them, and Steve finds himself laughing as well, unable to help it.
Steve exhaled sharply, turning his attention back to the biters.  "You want to fight?" he called at them.  His shield went swinging as he started to run down the field, being as noisy as possible to deter any of the ones who might have otherwise been inclined to follow after Tony's smell or the fading sounds of his coughing.  He could feel his wound starting to bleed sluggishly again with the movement, but there was no time to do anything about it right now.  Instead, he just kept on running, bowling down any biters in the way and keeping an eye out for an exit route.  Not long after, he caught sight of another set of staircases leading up, and he made a beeline for it, feet pounding with every step.
He glanced back up in time to see Tony staring at him, brows slightly furrowed.  "I want to believe you're telling me the truth," he said at last, his voice soft.
believe it.  It had happened once, Steve told him, the day he’d been found in the ice.  He’d gotten out of their sub, left to save a girl, and then she’d shot him.  He’d been okay back then, Tony remembers, and he tries to convince himself that Steve will be okay now.
Tony had a point, but Steve couldn't help but feel uneasy anyway.  Nonetheless, he sat back down, running his fingers along his shield anxiously.  "Alright," he said.  "Tony… be careful."
"Then think it," Steve said.  "Maybe not today if you can't, but… someday soon, I hope."
Oh.  Well, wasn’t that something?  No wonder everyone in S.H.I.E.L.D. was so fond of him.  But he was still annoying!  “Thanks,” he said anyway, because it seemed like the sort of thing he should be thankful for.  He weakly pushed himself up onto one elbow then, looking Rogers over.  He looked a bit battered, but otherwise okay.  “Is there anything I can help you with?”
"No kidding," Bucky said with a snort.  "You're not gonna ruin your dad's letter too, are you?"
Steve stared at him, though the gravity he was trying to project was somewhat lost due to the sabretooth pelt that was still draped off his shoulders.  “You’re kidding.  Tony, it’s the middle of the day.  No one’s going to be able to see fireworks.”
He hadn't, he decided, gotten this far by not taking any chances.
"No," Steve said.
Tony glances down at the vase in his hand.  “Admiring art?” he tries.
"I just want to make sure that a member of this team we're supposed to have is in good health. Why is that so surprising?"
A nightmare?
She nodded though Tony still helped her, letting her use him as a crutch as he brought her back to the elevator. He set her against the wall inside and made sure she was okay again before stepping out.
Steve hadn't been lying. About Hydra. About SHIELD. About his parents. The weight of knowing that his father and mother hadn't died in some random car accident was heavy. And the fact that it was a brainwashed version of Steve's friend? A man his father also knew? How was someone supposed to process that? Once he skimmed over the snippets, he hadn't been able to focus on anything else, letting JARVIS take the reigns since.
It was almost a month now that he'd been in DC. Now April, it was thankfully warmer and Steve was falling into his old patterns. Running in the mornings lead to him meeting Sam again. This time he spent more mornings racing him, showing him up and chatting with him, grabbing bites to eat when time permitted. He asked about things he already knew the answers to but needed to hear all over again to keep the role of 2013 him up. Like before, talking to Sam was easy. He was easy to get along with. Always had been. After the first fall of Hydra, Sam had been a constant and having him in his life again, no matter how repetitive, helped him breath a little easier.
"Who's Dot? Gramma?" Clint asked, mouth full of food.
As for his team, he had them going over the information they'd gathered to find bases that HYDRA could be using to hide in. With the staff gone again, he at least had an idea of where to look. The last time they found it, it was in Sokovia but that was in 2015. They weren't supposed to come across it for another
Head tilted at her expression, he looked down at the monitor and his breath caught. "Where is this?" He asked, tapping the screen. Sitting there, hands bound behind his back was Tony. It looked like he was smacked around a little, sporting a black eye and a split lip he didn't have yesterday. His shoes were missing and he was sitting against a dark wall of some sort. He looked angry, annoyed and maybe a little bit smug. The footage panned out and he could see one guard standing with him.
The clapping of thunder on a relatively sunny day announced the arrival of Thor midway through dinner and he stormed through the glass doors of the balcony, pausing briefly at the group of them sitting around the living room.
"--what happened to him?"
"Using the fact that everyone idolizes you to your advantage?"
"If it's so ancient, what's with that?" Steve nodded his head towards the USB port and Nat ran her finger along it curiously. He wondered if Zola knew they were there yet or if they needed a drive to get it activated.
A fight here wouldn't benefit either of them though, no matter how much Steve wanted to punch Rumlow in the face. Instead he brought a hand up to gently press at Tony's lower back, reminding him that he wasn't there alone.
"And your technology is hard to replicate. None of our own engineers can come close to duplicating your work and you shared next to nothing with SHIELD that we could use. So we'll just have you make it for us."
It wouldn't have been the first time. Both he and Thor were often the center of such attacks but they were never gone for long than a day or so. Their father was quick to find them because of Heimdall. Heimdall saw everything and this too, he would see. All he had to do was wait. His father would come for him.
"Tony, we don't...It's okay." Even as he protested, Tony was tugging him to his feet and toward the hall. Steve's protests weren't going to stop him. He's made the decision for him already.
"I need you to get me into SHIELD's HQ." It was said so nonchalantly that the three of them just shared a look before turning their attention to Tony, wondering if they'd misheard him.
"He's alright. A little bruised here and there. There's no sign of the cold affecting him though so for being in Hydra's care, he's fine."
His phone finished turning on. As it did, his driver cursed out loud about the 'idiot standing in the middle of the road' which caught his attention so he initially missed the warning Jarvis had on his screen in big letters that just said '
"What--What are you doing?"
"Anything on the algorithm?"
"So this is the plan." Steve crossed his arms, looking down at the paper laid out over Sam's dining room table. Standing around the table with him was Sam, Clint and Natasha as well as Fury with of course, Hill because where Fury went, she went. Fury arrived not long after their call and by then, Steve had managed to focus but chose to regroup in the morning. He cleared his head and after talking with Bruce and looking over the information they had, he was able to come up with the plan by that next morning.
"Get out of there."
"I can't come and say hi?"
He pressed a hand to Steve's wound when Sam ran over, his expression probably mirroring his own. When he looked back down at Steve, his eyes were closed.
"Steve!"
Wide brown eyes looked at him with so much
He wondered how long he'd been here for. He didn't know these people or why they took him. They looked like midgardians but more advanced then the ones he'd seen when their father last took him here and they didn't look at all like the ones in his readings. They weren't primitive or clueless. They were mean looking and made snide remarks. If it weren't for his all-speak, he would have been lost but he understood everything they said. The comments were unkind and cruel. They mocked his predicament and they refused to give him food. He was starving. They never once said how they took him from his home or why he was there. Sometimes they threatened to hurt him, slammed their sticks and weapons against the bar to drive him into the corner.
(See the end of the chapter for
--" There was a bit of resistance but Tony pushed on, letting him fuss all he wanted but not letting go. "I can't-- I'm not worth it."
"Well you're not going back to sleep out here so come on. We can share the bed."
"Just take my bed and I'll sleep on the couch."
"It's this building right here." Steve nodded to the building off to the side. The one he was making a single minded trek to. It was deja vu upon deja vu and Steve was getting that unsettling disoriented feeling from last night again. He made this walk with Natasha. He made this walk with Tony and now he was making this walk with Natasha and Clint.
Steve got to his feet, heart thudding in his chest. Tony got out. Or was this a trap? He wouldn't put it past Hydra to use it against them; to lure them in when they figured out what it could do. He had hope though. Tony could get out of any situation if he put his mind to it.
"Oh, right, I know. I was wondering if I could see him. I wanted to check on him after hearing about what happened. Is he up in his suite?"
There was a loud boom, like thunder and Loki watched wide-eyed as thunder rained down from the sky with a taller man wearing a red cape. An Asgardian! His father must have sent someone!
"Leave that problem to me. I am the one with the shield after all. Is there another way in there?"
"Strap him in. It's time to run our first test run."
"Think you're funny huh?" Rumlow asked, grabbing him by the arm and dragging him out of the room. "We only needed him to motivate you to work but we don't need that now."
Sam seemed to be taking the information given pretty well. He asked questions when he needed to know more and nodded in understanding.
Was it because Tony was using him as a pillow still, the side of his face smashed against his chest while snored? Yes. Would he admit it? Not to anyone who wasn't Tony, and even then, very reluctantly. Tony had been sweet, offering to help him through his nightmare. The other knew exactly how to calm his fears and put him at ease and he was grateful Tony had been there. He couldn't remember much of the nightmare. It was too disorienting and he felt like he was spiraling downwards. Natasha and Tony were dead and he was lost. That was all he could recall of what terrorized him the night before. Having Tony there to remind him that he was okay, that Nat was okay, had been everything to Steve.
"What do you mean SHIELD's compromised? I'm pretty sure we would have noticed. Right Nat?" Clint was frowning and when his partner didn't answer, he looked at her. Natasha's attention was turned to the information laid out in front of them, both thoughtful and doubtful. "Nat?"
"If I stayed, what would happen?"
"Two birds with one stone?"
He wasn't very smart.
"Remember kid. Get out. Keep running. Don't stop until they find you okay. Captain America, Steve. He'll find you."
"No."
"Rogers, Steven, born 1918. Romanoff, Natalia Alianovna, Born 1984. Barton, Clinton Francis. Born 1979. "
He found himself met by the deadest pair of blue eyes watching him from the other side. There was no life to them and Tony's heart jumped into his throat at being caught. His brain was a little fuzzy but he was quickly putting together that the information they had on this man and the man they were looking for, Sergeant Barnes were of the same person. Then it clicked. He really shouldn't be standing there.
Nat made a grabbing motion for it and Steve passed her the little Iron Man head. She clicked her tongue off the roof of her mouth and slid it into one of the empty slots. "Might as well get what we can for Stark right? JARVIS can download whatever is on this old thing in minutes."
"Pierce."
Sam was getting the upper-hand on Rumlow but Tony, being Tony, had to butt in. He used the high frequency setting he'd used on Barnes before to disorient Rumlow, letting Sam get that last punch to send him to the ground.
"Do you really think they can get us out of here?"
A look was shared by the occupants of the room. One that he caught, even under morphine.
"--How did you get Fury's access codes--"
"How do you know?"
"Sam. can you get him to the elevator?"
But no matter how many times he was interrogated, he never said a word.
"We can talk about that later. it's about the information you're going to sift through."
"Yeah--"
"What?"
Steve shrugged his shoulders and kicked at the leg of the chair to get Tony to speak up.
"Ah, Mister Stark." Tony looked away from the kid and up at the man coming down the cell with Rumlow. He was bald with a monocle and wore all back. It screamed bad guy and Tony just wanted to sigh.
"Amazing. He's been out in the snow for at least an hour and there's no sign of frost bite--"
And Tony’s heart sinks.  The call is still out for women and children only, and neither he nor Steve—nor his father, really—have a chance in hell of getting on.
"Your loss," Ty said, and he withdrew his hand and disappeared, shutting the door behind him.
What on earth…?  Frowning, Steve got up, making his way to the curtains and pulling them aside, inhaling sharply as he looked past them.  The sun had long since set, but he could still make out several shapes shuffling about in the snow—and now that he was no longer listening to Stark talk, he thought he could hear… moaning.  A lot of moaning.
"Not at all.  Let's go."
“There’s something under here,” he announced sometime past noon, stopping in the middle of an unremarkable grove.
Tony smiled a little in response.  "If I am one, it's only because I learned from—"
Stark ushered Steve back into the cabin after that, muttering something about how all that noise would have drawn "the others" and promising to explain everything when they were settled in.  Once the cabin was locked up and the black curtains were back in place, Stark lit a few candles and gave Steve a fresh set of clothes to change into before taking the soiled ones to the sink.  To Steve's surprise, he started to wash them in silence, all without a single joke or comment to be heard.  Since when did Tony Stark need to do his own laundry?  "Let me help," he offered, but Stark just waved him off, telling him to unpack the bag he'd brought back with him.
The thing was, Captain America was brave and noble and okay, yes, really quite good-looking.
Steve stared at Stark in horror.  Four years, he thought.  It had been four years since Stark had last seen Pepper—a woman Steve remembered with fondness—and he didn't even know if she was alive or dead.  "I'm… I'm sorry, Stark," he managed, at a loss for any other words.
.  “So don’t dawdle.  You’re wasting valuable spooning time.”
Tony glanced up quickly.  Had he heard right…?  "Pardon?"
sounded, drawing his attention back to the airship, and all of Tony's worst fears crowded to the front of his mind, the confusion about the man and discomfort from his skin and arm and side receding into the distance.
So this is how it ends, he thinks.
The awful, self-centered part of him tells himself that this is actually good news.  The weight of Steve’s death has been crushing him for days, weeks, months now, and it would be such a relief for it to disappear, if only until his rebooted self reads the news again.  But the weight
Well over twenty years since he had found Steve Rogers frozen in the ice.
But Rumiko is different, he knows.  She wears a mask, but she’s honest about it, telling him about how she doesn’t want to be confined the way her parents want her to be.  She shows him her wrists, but not to convince him they’re meant to be: they’re as blank as his own, having been covered with makeup.  “I don’t listen to my parents or my elders or anyone,” she tells him fiercely as they sit together on a mountainside, picnicking.  “So why should I pay attention to some random words on my arm?  If I go and hang around a super smart ladies’ man, it’s because that’s what I choose to do.”
Steve inclined his head.  "Same.  But until that next time… stay safe."
"Okay," Tony managed.  He wrapped his arms around his legs, looking small, and that was enough for Steve to decide to scoot closer, wrapping his own arms around Tony as well.
“What—” Steve begins, because
He straightened after that, glancing around the room.  Rhodey looked contemplative.  Pepper was staring at the photos.  Jarvis was drumming his fingers against his arm.  "You've been quiet, J," Tony said.
Tony tilted his head back, fighting an odd urge to smile.  It wasn't that smiling was
And while it’s nice of Tony to be asking and confirming, does he
"What was it?"
"Steve?" Natasha stepped into the room cautiously. "It looks like they grabbed him from the back yard when he made a run for it. Other than that we haven't found anything. Are you okay?"
Natasha used her phone to figure out the right sequence of buttons to press and the elevator doors slid open for them to all get in.
"He is. I do not know how this happened but I would know my brother anywhere, no matter what age he is. This is Loki."
"What
This is it. The end of part one! I wanted to post it earlier but fighting scenes are not my forte so yeah--
"I'm sorry. About what I said. When we first met. You're a good man Tony, better than anyone I know."
"Sound like a plan guys. See you tomorrow."
"Damn it."
Sitting up, he looked around. It was...well pretty bare. Three of the walls were smooth metal, with a room off to the side and no windows. It looked like a bathroom with a simple toilet, sink and a shower head were in the little room so that wasn't entirely bad. The last wall was a series of metal bars and outside he could see a similar type of cell across the hall. There wasn't even a bed. He got a pillow at least but one blanket which meant he got to sleep on a cold metal floor.
"Hydra? Steve--"
"The Avengers. We started out as your pet project but I plan for us to be independent from SHIELD and any government. We'll be willing to work with you, once things are settled and we won't risk operations in a country without the right authorities knowing." Something they overlooked the last time they worked as a team and the worlds countries were not happy with some of the outcomes. If they could work with governments, not for them, he was hoping that they could avoid anything like the Sokovia Accords. "But ultimately we'll be working on our own and I'm taking Sergeant Barnes into our protective custody."
"I think so."
"And Pepper?"
some of the places that were booked for me when my assistant was mad. It was a passive aggressive thing. I make her mad, she books me in one star hotels."
Then there was a loud bang and something hit the tree he was passing.
"No but I'm sure it's guarded. Once we get down there, we'll know."
Steve stepped past the two of them and walked down the row of desks. It was easy to remember the rows of people here, diligently working at their desks as he and Tony slipped by them without notice. Now it was dusty, old and rundown, left to rot after SHIELD moved to bigger and better things.
"Stark?"
"Clint and I took a team down there once we got you off, but Rumlow and Stark were both gone."
He screamed.
"Didn't know you were in DC, Tony." That earned him a giddy laugh from the front and Tony lifted the cap up a bit as he turned in his seat to give him a grin.
"No."
That's right. They weren't.
Yes. This was what he wanted. He needed Tony to question what they knew.
"Zola. You look alive for a dead man."
"Fury."
A car screeched to a halt in front of him and a man he'd never seen rolled the window down.
"Tony, I...Thank-you, again. For this. You didn't need to help me with this, or believe me at all but you did."
Tony rubbed at his face as JARVIS dug his claws into the information on the screen. Steve had ducked in a about an hour ago to tell him that they were going out to get something for Sam. The file was sitting next to him and he briefly looked it over before focusing as much as he could on the task at hand.
Steve was out of the car with his shield before Sam even stopped in the driveway, feet taking him to the house. JARVIS contacted them the moment the Strike team arrived on scene but they'd been too far away. He was too far away. Again.
"Oh Tony." Steve let out a sigh, rubbing at his face. He couldn't look at those brown eyes, wide and honest and so caring. Rip it off like a band aid. "Hydra killed your parents."
"Food?"
That made the new man panic and he agreed to do what they wanted.
"Look. We have a plan. Can you just...promise that you won't alert Fury. I don't think he's a part of this but I also don't want him to go pushing the wrong buttons if he agrees with us. The less people that get dragged into this, the better."
"Thank-you Tony."
do though." Rumlow argued and Steve grit his teeth before opening his mouth to speak.
"No." There was the kind yet stern tone again and Steve was crouching down in front of him. "You've been very brave so far Loki but we'll take it from here alright? It'll be too dangerous for you. You've already done your job, now it's our turn to do ours."
That hadn't explained anything.
"How fast can you get to our location?"
"You were?"
Stepping into the elevator next to her, he let out a stiff sigh and shouldered his bag. Still staring at him, her attention turned to the bag.
"I need your help."
asked for a favor. Mhm. Right. And that favor?"
"So you were listening to that huh? Well, that's true. I guess that means we're friends now, hm?"
and that I would want to be in the middle of it with you."
He took off running, sprinting across the floor to the next helicarrier. He damaged the one, he would work his way through as fast as he could. He flinched and ducked a little when he heard gun fire, running for the open helicarrier hanger door. He didn't stop running, despite his feet being as sore as they were, his body aching. He slid around corners, making his way to to the command room again. He immediately went to work on this one as well. The three of them were being built at the same time, but this one was further along than the other one. He wondered how the third one would be.
"Yeah, I was going to send it to SHIELD this week but since you're here why not give it to you in person?" Tony opened a suitcase that was sitting on the table and turned it towards Steve before stepping aside. "I don't know what sort of monkeys they had working on your suit but it was too old fashioned don't you think? Wasn't the right fit. "
"T-Tony?"
"...that they used Bucky to do it."
remained untouchable."
"Stark?"
"Tony's dad
"No, we're not going to risk it. Let's go." He grabbed Tony by the elbow, ignoring how he tried to pull out of his grasp and tugged him out of the room. He urged him to start running again, ducking around the corners and back down the halls to the hanger. Off in the distance, he spotted Sam and Hill trading blows with Rumlow and the Strike team. They'd barely made it into the helicarrier docking bay when the first helicarrier blew followed by the second one, and the third. The ground rocked beneath their feet and he caught Tony as he stumbled. He could hear the groaning of metal, the sound of the helicarriers falling apart around them as they ran.
"You don't know..."
Over all that noise, a single gunshot rang out clearer to Steve and he felt the bullet strike his leg. He hit the ground hard and Tony slid to a stop when he noticed.
Tony helped him to his feet and he happened to look up just in time to bring his shield up and protect them both from another shot. They both turned and he could hear Tony suck in a sharp breath. Standing between them and the elevator, gun in hand, mask covering the lower half of his face, was the Winter Soldier.
The car veered violently and Barnes was thrown off after Sam's second try. The last Tony saw of him, he was getting back up in the middle of the road and then Sam turned the corner.
"Your room waiting."
"But you have a feeling."
"Stark!"
keeping people here. There was someone else! That was good. Other people meant he could get information. See if they knew the layout of the building, who was in charge and what they were doing here.
"What...is this place?" He heard Clint murmur as they came down the stairs. Natasha located the lights and flicked them on, a low hum of electricity filling the room as she did. Even now, Steve was mildly surprised by the SHIELD logo bright on the wall. "SHIELD?"
