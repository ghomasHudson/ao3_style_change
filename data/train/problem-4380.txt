He hasn’t heard any distant knocking from the hallway. Frowning, he looks through the peephole on his door only to see Dean huddled up by the radiator by the door, head bent low. He’s visibly shivering even from this distance.
Castiel hums in agreement, and watches as the nurse looks around the room. When her eyes fall on the clock hanging above the far doorway, she lets air escape between her teeth. “Oh jeez, uh, nice meeting you. I have to ah-“ she turns to go but then stops, turns back his way, “do you need anything else before I-?”
The back of the door looked just as normal as the front, despite its placement. He walked back to face the front of the door, eyeing the faint light seeping out from the space between the bottom of the door and the ground, coming from nowhere.
It didn’t take Sam long to go through the screening and security measures set in place for inmate visitations.
Considering the shining knife Alistair had hidden on him, Sam didn’t think he’d be able to back out. No wonder this revelation happened in a controlled environment, with their most able and trusted enforcer to carry it out.
Sam had turned to watch the stranger again, and saw his fingers twitch slightly, something he would’ve missed if he hadn’t been staring. “He’s moving.”
It only takes a few more minutes before reflective yellow eyes flash in the darkness surrounding the bonfire. There are excited yips and growls as the werewolves prowl along the edge of the light from the fire with their distinctive loping gait.
“Of course, officer.”
“As much as I love our…
The omega looked up at him from her defensive curl, eyes calculating, and this close Castiel could see her pupils had blown large. She was young, maybe caught unawares by a first heat, and she still seemed relatively responsive, but that wouldn’t last very much longer. She considered him for a moment before slowly shaking her head.
Whoop, nerd speak. Time to tune that shit out. Dean pulled out his phone to find even
Dean froze, could only watch as Gordon looked up at him. “Hold on, there’s one more.” He dabbled with Jess’ phone, gun still pointed at him even though his eyes were on the screen. And Dean knew exactly what he was going to do next. When he turned the screen around, Dean could only stare at the picture Charlie had taken of Dean and Castiel, mute. The text underneath read,
“Why don’t you just run for the hills if you don’t think he’s telling the truth?” Dean asked, curious. “You could probably kick my ass in a fair fight, and easily get away.”
“Dean, you-“ Castiel shut his mouth, looking like he was going to drop this altogether. “Nevermind.”
In a richer family, broken bones could be healed within hours, but no one on Hephaestus had that kind of money. Most everyone on the planet was either a poor miner or a poor spaceship worker.
Dean wanted to make it a regular thing.
“You have your detective face on.”
Castiel spoke over him, “No, no, that’s perfectly alright.” A corner of his mouth turned up into a small smile, which Dean returned. Castiel stood there for a few more seconds before stepping out of the kitchen.
“Did your father send you after me?” Cas questioned, moving up beside the bed so he could see Ruby’s face better.
The shuttle rocked again, but this time everyone was pressed down into their seats as the shuttle shot upwards, faster than before.
Charlie hit him again.
let you be unsupervised.”
“How did they meet?”
“Oh, if it’s anything like last season’s meeting, I’ll eat them alive. Be safe.”
After he stopped struggling, Castiel let him go, and Dean turned around. “Did you do this?”
They followed the man as he turned the corner into what looked to be the kitchen. At the far side of the room a figure sat at a small kitchen table, looking out the back panel of windows at the rain, coming down heavier than before. The man that had searched them for weapons turned and gestured them forward again, taking position at the doorway. Castiel moved forward, Dean a step behind him, and the figure turned to face them and stood up, helped by a walking cane.
Supplies were low, but they managed to buy some essentials with the credits Dean had on his comm. A few changes of clothes and the small travel-sized hygiene products were all they could remember to get, avoiding the pitying human interactions with self-checkouts, and then they were rushing back to the Impala, squeezing through the crowds to get back in time.
Sam comes out from behind him to stand next to Dean, though still safely out of arm’s reach, facing Castiel. He’s smiling. “Glad you could make it! I’m excited to run with you guys tonight. It’s been a while since I’ve seen vampires in action.”
“Uh, okay.” Charlie said, not knowing at all where this was going. “You mean like, the alpha, beta, and omega classes?” When Castiel nodded, Charlie tried to put her thoughts in order. “Well, I know the Preserves are still really traditionalist, with rigid class structures where the alphas lead, betas follow, and omegas submit, but- “ she sighed, “gimme a bone, here.”
right now? My friends in the force are the best help you’re gonna get.” Dean turned to Gordon again. “Gordon, I swear to god, keep moving and I’ll put a bullet in
“Huh,” Dean said.
“Interference?” Ellen asked, but Castiel lunged towards Pam's console.
When Dean didn’t answer immediately, Castiel turned his head to see him standing back a ways, looking guilty. “Since the night at the Roadhouse,” he finally admitted.
“What?”
Dean finally ended the call and texted Charlie before placing his phone back on the table.
it. No need to be so coy. We all have our appetites.”
“That…is an awesome idea. I’ll have Sam give me his number later, but I digress. We were working on the Ruby thing.” Charlie rolled her shoulders. “Okay, let’s find this motherhugger.”
Charlie stretched and put her second empty bottle down, eying his phone. “So, for realsies, how’s work? Status still on the down-low?”
“Who came down with you?” Bobby asked, but Dean shook his head.
Sam shook his head and looked around again, but he found himself stepping closer. The door seemed to loom above him as he did.
Charlie’s eyebrows rose and she whistled in surprise. “Wow! Doing well for only a few months under your belt. But, seriously man, were you like, living under a rock or something before?”
, Gordon.”
Confused, Dean shook his head. “I don’t understand. Why have you been trying to find him? He’s-“ he should really shut his mouth sometimes.
Just the thought of the brief view of pale freckled skin and lean muscle made his face flush even further.
Castiel saw it before the kid did. It was a habit he had picked up during his time on the streets, gauging people for the right opportunity, but only when hunger had carved out enough of his belly to take the risk. This cashier seemed the type that didn’t suffer lawbreakers well, no matter how pathetic they looked. When Castiel saw the little boy, no more than eight years old, furtively grabbing packages of food off of the shelves and stuffing them in his pockets, he glanced up to see that the cashier had his own hard gaze already fixed on the kid. The cashier looked like an alpha, all self-righteous anger and entitlement issues, and Castiel moved a bit too late to intercept as the kid headed to the door behind another lady.
“Thank you, I’m aware of that,” Dean said, dryly. He managed to rip open the plastic and put the meat into the pan, resulting in a satisfying sizzling sound. The smell of cooking beef made his stomach twinge with hunger. “Look, it’s not like I’m gonna have a heart-to-heart with the man over a candle-lit dinner. Besides, Charlie’s always around, so what’s the worst that could happen?”
Besides moving a little, Gordon had stayed relatively quiet, but now he chose this moment to speak up. “You know they won’t believe her over me, right? And then I’ll come after both of you."
She smiled at him.
“I don’t know.”
“Is Jess safe?” he asked, forgetting the game altogether.
“-travel advisory for all spaceships leaving Hephaestus will go into effect later this week. If you have any family or friends on Charis Station, now would be the time to call before the meteor shower interference stops all communication. The meteor shower will start to pick up tomorrow night, so this is the last good night to watch it safely!
“You’re sure?”
Curious, Jess cocked an eyebrow. “Well then, come on in. Are you on duty right now?” she asked, eyeing his uniform.
If no one gets the movie reference: Cato was the butler from the Pink Panther movies that snuck up on and attacked Inspector Clouseau when he was least inspecting it at home to hone his instincts. He once popped out of the fridge to attack when the Inspector opened it to get food. It was great.
A nod this time.
They hung up. Dean couldn’t bring himself to move for several seconds, but he could feel the familiar thrum of adrenaline kicking back in. What the fuck was he supposed to do now? Why had Bobby used their code word to drop everything and run when he freaking had Ruby right where he wanted her? What the hell was happening at the police station?
Another voice behind him made him turn around, already dreading the next scene. Castiel came face to face with himself when he turned. His mirror had his hands tied behind his back, and Uriel had a hand next to his throat. The air reeked of fear. “Please,” he begged, “don’t. Don’t do this.”
Dean just grunted and continued pacing. Wasn’t like the opposite was going to make this go faster either. Nothing to do but worry and hope Sam was alright.
Movement further in had Dean stilling in place, and he watched as Castiel stood up from a crouch, concentrating so hard on threading tubing around a grow bed that he hadn’t noticed Dean yet. His trenchcoat was nowhere in sight, instead, Castiel wore an old worn t-shirt, grey with age, and a pair of black pants he must’ve gotten second hand from Joshua.
Dean rubbed his eyes with his free hand and started pacing. “What’d he say?”
Apprehensive, he knocked and waited for Charlie. Castiel hadn't seen Dean since he'd accidentally discovered the scent blockers in Dean's apartment, but Charlie had said Dean would show up tonight for their movie night. From what he knew of Dean in the short time he'd known the man, it seemed likely that Charlie had forced him into it. Charlie and Castiel hadn't stopped meeting since that night; they'd watched the rest of the Star Wars movies without Dean, which was apparently a bigger issue than he had thought it would be, based on Charlie's reaction.
It had been so unexpected that she’d come to investigate.
Dean pulled out the package of hamburger meat and looked for the right knife to cut through the plastic. “Well then,
Sammy leaned back in his chair and blinked. “
“Yeah,” Dean replied, voice more wobbly than he expected. He cleared his throat, and stood up, food forgotten. Sam rose from his chair as well when Dean made his way around the table, and Dean gave him a bone-crushing hug. “Proud of you, man.” Sam just squeezed him tighter in response before pulling back, and Dean gave Jess a slightly less forceful hug.
. I. Don’t. Know.”
When Daphne laced her fingers together, Dean noticed she wasn’t wearing a ring. At first it had seemed like the two were an item, but she had given no indication to it, no matter how much he tried to draw out an answer. Before he could ask anything else, Dean heard the creak of the front door opening. Both Daphne and Dean stood up to meet Castiel as he entered the front hall, one hand on the shoulder of a young boy, no more than seven or eight years old. It was obvious that this was the omega’s brother, his sharp angular face and threadbare clothes a sure sign of hard times. His small frame tensed when he saw Dean’s uniform, panic blooming across his face. “You promised-“
Dean.
A heart had been drawn at the end. Was it bad that Dean was now seriously considering murder?
Again, Dean looked towards Cas. “Hey, Cas, can you-?” he motioned to Ruby. Moving forward, Cas nodded, and they managed to fumble around and change places. Ruby almost kicked Dean right in the nuts during the quick switch, but he backed away just in time.
When he was done, Dean hit him with a foot. “Untie me, Sam, fucking now –“
Quieter, Daphne said, "Castiel, are you-"
And suddenly Dean was putting a knee on the other side of Castiel’s hips, leaning in, and kissing him.
. It was completely throwing Dean for a loop.
Jess nodded as Benny got out of the driver’s seat. “Yeah, seems like. Daphne called and told me what happened already. Follow me.” She led the way into the house.
“Daphne said that it was originally meant for Sam, and that a woman named Ruby was behind it.” Castiel watched him, expectant, as Dean nodded in response.
He had to lean over the bed to throw up.
“Unfortunately. We’re trying to find Ruby before she can try anything else, but-” Dean shrugged.
“Hey, Benny,” Dean started, voice pitched low and quiet so Raz and Cordeline couldn’t overhear. Benny’s daemon Cordeline was an American mink, almost the same size as Raz but twice as mean. He didn’t want the daemons to be able to hear this conversation.
“Shut the hell up, Charlie.”
Luckily, Charlie turned her attentions to Castiel as Dean downed the rest of – oh god that was straight vodka – determined to even the playing field. “Any embarrassing scuffles you wanna share with the class?”
Dean made his way over to Ellen, and she finished up with her current customer and made her way over when she caught sight of him again. Dean smirked at the other customers waiting.
(See the end of the chapter for
For a second, Dean idly wondered if Cas would shift into a wolf so he could watch if he asked nice enough, and then felt his face redden at the resulting image. More specifically, Cas getting butt-naked in order to do so. Dean furiously turned his attention back to the computer.
What was he doing? Sam inhaled, and caught the faint scent of
They all looked at their own comms as the evacuation order continued to scroll. Everyone on the colony knew that the meteor field the planet passed through each year could eventually give them one big rock that could wipe them off the face of the planet, and had yearly drills in preparation for such an event, but so far the mining rewards had outweighed the risks.
“Yes, I’m quite aware of your capability,” Cas told him, ignoring his outburst to pick up wayward items and redistribute them in the remaining bags.
Good God, ~60K and counting, and still not even a kiss. Get them together, girl! *slaps face*
“Here, let me-“
They stopped by Ash’s medical station next, each roped into a physical and a round of booster shots. Afterwards, Dean rubbed at his shoulder and furtively ate the hard candy Ash had given him as he watched Ash examine Sam’s cast.
This was going to end badly, no matter what he did here. Gordon's eyes still glowed red and his breathing stayed heavy as the drug flowed through his body, lowering inhibitions and revving up aggression. It obviously hadn’t been a lot of Red – just enough to give him that extra
Standing up turned out to be a very bad idea. He grabbed the doorframe and took a second to recover, head splitting and his stomach protesting the sudden movements. No time! He moved into the hall, but Charlie was long gone.
care of her.”
It took him a long minute to understand what he was seeing, and he scrambled down off the side of the shuttle and hit – solid concrete, under his feet. A cloudy night sky overhead. Buildings towering over him, so tall the tops disappeared into the clouds above.
“Looks like that lap is reserved for dogs only, Balthazar.” Meg drawls from the doorway. At Castiel’s growing scowl, she relents just a bit. “Sue us, we got curious. Been a while since you’ve shown interest in someone.” The sardonic tilt at one corner of her mouth speaks volumes.
Castiel frowns in the direction of the door at the noise, but doesn’t get up from his chair. It’s nothing identifiable, just the sound of the front door opening and closing, the rustle of clothes being hung up and the stamp of feet on the hardwood. Vampires, then, but friendly enough to make enough noise to alert him to their presence. He runs through the list of names in his head but comes up blank to who would be here at this hour, until a voice carries up the stairs.
The agent put his one small briefcase down against his legs and the car door, and Dean couldn't resist asking the question that had been on his mind since his phone call. “If you flew out here so fast, why not just arrest Castiel so he can’t leave town?”
“and he’s inviting you to the next full moon gathering!” Balthazar claps his hands together. “You’ll have to go to avoid slighting another Speaker, unfortunately. And great news! It’s less than a week away, so you’ll have us there!”
They took the stairs, Dean leading the way. Once they got to the door, a metal disc reading 204 affixed to the middle, Dean slowed down, motioning for him to be quiet. A
Henrickson looked confused. “No?”
“Not of flesh and blood. But there are those of us born from the same – spark. I would call them siblings.”
“Don’t worry, Castiel knows what he’s doing. It’ll be fine.”
Literally just beyond this door.”
“Sire Castiel?” she asks, looking around. At first she doesn’t spot him, but then the other workers all turn to look in his direction, and she does as well. He's near the back of the lobby, away from the windows even though this room does not get any direct sunlight during the day.
They were given guest access and she waved them through the first door. Like all medical centers, this one was a maze of confusing and long hallways, so packed full of people that they’d started putting hospital cots out in the hallways when they’d run out of rooms.
“You better have a good reason to say that to me,” Sam growled, making an elderly lady walking by put a little more space between them.
“What the hell are you talking about?”
“Just dropped some things looking for food. Where’s your shirt? As much as I love you, I don’t want a free viewing.”
They’d gotten suspicious looks from passers-by, but Sam and Jessica were well behaved and just old enough to get by without comment, or a sly glance and telling silence. Less than a year remained before they would have to choose their field of study, and both already knew where they were headed.
“Right, right. No sex ed growing up, I got it.” Dean was grinning at him, all sparkling eyes and laugh lines, and Castiel stopped feeling slighted at the sight.
“Peachy.” Dean said. “Cas? It’s an emergency.”
When that didn’t work, he tried jumping, though that made his arm throb.
“What are you doing out here?” Castiel asked, tilting his head, though Dean wouldn’t be able to see the action.
A half dozen raised their hands.
Oh, hell no. Not
“Did you forget he works every other day shift in the green room, Dean?”
“No I’m not,” Dean chuckled, scrambling for any other excuse, “that scent's from Sarah. Did you think you were the only girl I get in here?” It was a flimsy attempt, and they both knew it.
Castiel raises an eyebrow. “You do realize that will last several hours.”
“Daphne says you have school today. Do you teach?”
“Came to see if you’d go to the Roadhouse with me.”
. I blind myself to my brethren when I lower myself into this
“What?!? What is so damn important-“ Dean started, but Jo and Ellen were both pointing out the window. He trailed off when he followed their gazes out.
But they were both in a licensed safe-house. No way would a fake name fly for that. So what the hell?
“Hey-!“ Dean manages to get a bare foot wedged in between the door and its frame, yelping when it stops the door from closing all the way.
“Away from here. I don’t know.”
The crush of people was getting to be too much, jostling them both. Another hard shove and Sam lost his grip on Jess’s hand, others moving between them, all panicked and unthinkingly set on self-preservation.
“Yes? Why are you asking me that?”
“Just drank something spiked with Red. M’not feeling so hot right now.” He didn’t know if this was going to get worse, and didn’t want to be driving when he found out.
Now, there was no thought in his head but for the desire to survive this.
“Just – just don’t order pizza, okay? I’ll text Charlie in a bit.”
“Don’t we always?” Meg says, grinning.
Jess reached over and took his good hand in his. “You’re doing that. The score you got for the placement means you can go into any field you want, regardless of the dumb shit we teenagers do.”
Castiel waves a dismissive hand, and she nods and steps off the low dais to weave her way into the crowd, disappearing from sight.
“It’s not a bad thing sometimes, am I right?” Dev said from his perch. “Besides, you don’t have to be able to speak to be understood. It’s not at all unusual.”
“Argh, why didn’t I think of that!” Charlie’s outburst drew Dean’s attention away from his phone. “I’ve spent all my time trying to do this in
“Friendly?” Dean asked, and Castiel frowned at him.
“Death.” Castiel finally answered.
After a moment, Dean gave up and sat down on the mattress, over the covers. He yawned again and rubbed at his eyes with a hand. “So, what’s your plan? For this-“ Dean gestured vaguely “whole thing?”
“Okay…” he seemed to deliberate for a second. “I also had to talk to Krissy about her living situation. In these kinda cases, we’re required to contact Child Services, and things are not looking good on that front.” He sighed in resignation and frowned into his coffee before he continued. “Krissy is on her own; parents dead and looking after Shawn by herself. No friends or relatives to speak of. We talked it out, and it would be in her best interests if she doesn’t go into the foster system, so I’d like to know if you guys’d be interested in being emergency guardians until she can get emancipated.”
"I don't know, you tell me." Dean said, tone cold.
texts than he’d had last night. Jesus. Benny had sent him multiple texts – updates on Krissy (stable and already back home) and Victor (back at the station). Benny would’ve told Bobby everything, so his curt text to call came as no surprise, but his next one was.
Balthazar saluted. “Of course, boss. Even if we have to carry them out, hm?”
Bobby and Rufus kept Dean behind them as the stranger collapsed against the side of a cargo crate and slid down to sit on the floor.
“Alright. Thank you…?”
All reason left him as Dean’s hands came up to rest right under his ears, fingers curling around the sides of his neck into his hair. Castiel leaned into it, hands coming up to grip at Dean’s arms. After a moment, Dean leaned his head to the side, panting against the side of Castiel’s neck, straddling his hips. Castiel’s mouth tasted of whiskey.
His head felt like it was splitting open now. Dean dialed Charlie, but she didn’t pick up either. He finally realized that she’d turned off her phone to Skype with Gilda during the second try.
Henrickson’s superior?” Dean blurted.
“What’re their names?”
“Alright, next I need Ruby off the bed for a second.” Castiel lifted her off the bed one-handed.
Castiel tugged his arm out of the professor’s tight grip. “Professor, I don’t know what you’re talking about. My name’s not Jimmy.”
particular horse right in the face.
“Should’ve woken me up earlier.” It was obvious she’d been up for a while, and that they’d let him sleep way longer than he had wanted to. “Where’s Sammy?”
he wanted to say to her.
“I mentioned earlier I would tell you more once I talked to my boss, and I have, now.” Henrickson went on, like nothing had just happened. “He likes you. So I get to share what we have.” Dean blinked at the sudden change of topic, still tense and wary. He didn’t know if Henrickson was threatening him or just making him aware that they knew more about him than he wanted them to, but he didn’t like either option. Henrickson pushed out the other chair on the opposite side of the table with his foot. “Sit down. It’s lesson time.”
“Is this Officer Dean Winchester?” The voice on the other end was a male voice, but he didn’t identify himself.
“Of course. Thank you.” Hannah stays still and unrepentant behind him. It does not escape his notice that Jim has kept quiet about the fact the two brothers are natural born werewolves, so Castiel does not mention it. The back door opens, bringing in the sound of a few voices laughing as someone walks into the house. Glasses clink together.
first.”
Sam and Jess were waiting outside when Dean parked his Baby, already talking to Benny and another officer. Sam held out the piece of paper to Dean when he approached, and Dean saw the red diamond of Ruby’s handiwork at the bottom. That
“He got stuck as a wolf? What happened to him?”
Dean rolled off the couch with a grunt, his bad knee popping as he stood up to let her in. “What the hell are you doing here so late?” Dean asked her, as soon as he opened the door.
When Dean glanced over at him, Castiel nodded slightly, a silent ‘I’ll wait here’. “Sure thing.” Dean replied, and followed Krissy into the living room when he’d tied his shoes. “What did you want to talk to me about?”
The sound cut short as the alpha pinned her to the alley wall, one hand on her throat, and the other pawing at her shirt. He was taller and bigger than Castiel, but that would hardly be a problem. Castiel didn’t make a sound, so the alpha was unprepared when Castiel rammed into his side and knocked him down, breaking his hold. As the alpha scrambled upright, eyes still red and mouth open in a snarl, Castiel stepped between the two.
“So this is where Bobby used to live before we all moved down to Lawrence a few years ago." Dean told Cas, dropping his arms. "He couldn’t bring himself to sell the thing, and he only uses it as a summer vacation type of place, so it’s a good place to lay low until we make a game plan.” Dean yawned and rubbed his eyes. “First thing’s first, though, I’m gonna find a bed and pass out.”
“But seriously, how has no one, uh, bumped uglies with you?” Dean asked Castiel, giving him his own once-over. Definitely not half-bad. Especially with the opened collar and rumpled tie that Castiel had started tugging on a little bit ago, complaining that it was 'too warm in here'.
“Mmm… I mean, I can, but you can’t go inside the safe-house unless you’ve passed the Mischel test, so...” Dean shrugged.
“Oh, yes. Four years ago, in fact. When you dropped off the face of the earth for a few months, and your brother became so worried that he flew to your house and filed a missing persons report. Sound familiar?”
“He lost his phone three days ago at the start of his rut, so no.” Dean lapsed into silence for a bit, but Victor was obviously waiting on a better response than that. “I can contact Daphne – the woman who owns the safe-house, though she’s not my biggest fan at the moment.” She had not been impressed when the ambulance had shown up at her doorstep after Dean had
Dean pulled him back and sat him down on the bench in the antechamber, next to the suits. Sam couldn’t help but notice he wasn’t wearing one. The adrenaline made him shake like a leaf.
She shoved him away, hard, and he went, withdrawing his hand. Still cautious and watching her. “What the hell, Castiel?! Not okay! Not okay at all!”
“And my brother?” Castiel asked.
"Good to see you're still alive."
Dean turned away and pushed Sam out of the room.
“Okay, Castiel,” Henrickson said this time, conceding the point, “did anyone else survive?”
It felt weird having someone else in his apartment again.
With a pained sigh, Dean crouched to set the rest of the bags down and pick things up. Trails of egg white spider-webbed their way across the grooves in the pavement, so Dean already knew there were casualties even before he opened the egg carton to check. Three out of twelve had broken open. He picked them out and threw them spitefully against the nearest parked car.
“Last evac point for us!” Bobby shouted back. “Even with our faster ship, we’ll be pushing it for clearing atmosphere if we leave now! Close the door!”
Henrickson had started talking again, trying to keep Castiel from bolting. “Jimmy, look –“ he did a strange motion, putting three fingers behind his ear, but Castiel didn’t react at all, just kept staring at him. “I’m with the Underground on this side of the border. Please, no one from the Forests can find you out here.”
Before Dean could ask him anymore probing questions, Sam started talking on his own. “I know what you’re gonna say, Dean, how we’re all trying to deal with Hephaestus and all that, but I just-“ Sam’s hands had balled into fists, anger curling hot in his gut. “Now that I know I wasn’t imagining it, when Castiel saved me –“
“I’m a Speaker, like Myers. Interspecies relations.”
Dean nodded and turned to the side to speak into his mic. “Benny, we're gonna take the cruiser to get the omega to a safe-house. You need to secure the alpha. Come around from Mass Street to the alley to avoid us. It’s only about 50 yards past the diner.”
He stopped.
Dean hadn’t forgotten about Charlie, either, so when he made it back to his apartment building, he headed straight to her place. She’d definitely be interested in his news, and he had to find out if she really had broken up with Gilda. Long distance relationships were hard work, especially for people who weren't scent mates. And by the look on Charlie’s face when she opened the door, it had been too much work.
Groaning, Castiel drops his head in his hands.
Dean stopped walking as well and looked back at him. “Hear what?”
“He’s using a fake name for the safe-house. Wouldn’t that have disqualified him immediately?”
Jess shrugged. “He was very specific that none of his information be revealed.”
“I dunno,” Benny replied. “I was so sure that –“ he paused, changed gears, “I’m usually not wrong about that kinda thing. I just think that you shouldn’t warm up to him so fast ‘cause everyone else is. Family’s always been your blind spot.”
Charlie gave him a thin smile. “No, I still have a body. Not a ghost in the Net just yet. Well, are you ready?”
They all turned to look at the monitor, but then the stranger gasped for breath and writhed in the bed.
“Yes, I’m getting my accounting degree there.” For a man who could take down an alpha with his bare hands, Castiel seemed incredibly…
“Sammy, answer your damned comm.” Dean hissed in frustration when it didn’t connect.
Sam looked around again, cataloguing the architecture around him. This wasn’t a natural cave system or tunnel. Unlike the crumbling organic spires of the ruins above ground, these smooth curving walls looked pristine, curving off in both directions like a long, circular hallway. Although the only light source should’ve been the sunlight pouring through the hole above him, no deep shadows hid the tunnel from view. Everything seemed to be under a dim light, though he didn’t know where it was coming from.
Confused, Castiel looked over to Charlie and back to Dean. “Poison?”
After a second, Dean shrugged one shoulder. “We go home, first. We’ll decide-“
Sam smiles to himself and leaves them alone on the dais.
“…Yes, that's alright.” Castiel replied.
“Castiel Allen. He-“
Backtracking, Castiel shook his head. “Charlie, really. Nothing is happening.”
It had been more than a day since the refugees had all arrived on Charis station, and Sam had yet to find Dean, or even contact him in any way. He hadn’t been able to sleep, like so many of the other shell-shocked colonists. There was a miserable pall over all of them, mostly dry-eyed at this point, bleary with exhaustion.
They were two hours in and Castiel had already blown them all out of the water. Charlie and Dean had kept it slow, making sure Castiel didn’t get too drunk, too fast, but once he hadn’t shown any signs of approaching intoxication, it had gotten intense.
Castiel debated for a moment on whether or not he should lie. He was a terrible liar. “If it makes you uncomfortable, I can find somewhere else to stay until you leave the safe-house.”
Dean looked towards the house. Yellow police tape cordoned off the opened front door, the ends swaying in the wind. “I’ll talk to Bobby, see what we can do.” Hopefully it would be enough.
whelp, these two chapters could have been just one since they're so short. damn you, hindsight! (guess I'm making it up for you guys in the next chapter)
“And just what is he going to do about it?”
“Yup.”
-20 MINUTES-
“I’m sorry.” Castiel replied, realizing the misstep too late. He had never gotten better at being tactful. “That’s very personal.”
"I don't know what I'm trying to say. It's just that, it seems as though impossible things have happened around him." Sam shrugged, looking frustrated.
it gave us time to make our own move. I didn’t expect that Castiel would run for it and give us the slip.”
“For” he waved a hand “forcing you into this – arrangement. I didn’t realize-“
Putting out a hand, Sam smiled winningly at Castiel, who in turn looked a little shocked by his height. “Hello! I’m Sam Winchester. You’ve met my wife Jess and my brother Dean before, but not me.”
Being stuck out in the rain had dampened his smell, but he’d been wearing the same clothes for three days now. He definitely did not smell good.
“You know what Red feels like. It feels incredible, doesn’t it? Like you’re invincible.” Gordon leaned forward. “That’s just a perk. I don’t do things for drugs. I’m a better policeman than that.”
Castiel shrugged again, shaking his head.
“Ash will get it then,” John replied, and after a minute, Ash padded in from patrolling the outside of the barn to pick up the bag straps between her teeth. When she raised her head, she looked at Raz and gave a tentative wag of her tail before she led the way out.
“It should be.”
“Pleasure to meet you both,” Balthazar greets, shaking their hands. “So glad you got Cassie over here out of the house.”
“Yeah, and you also told me he was an alpha, so…”
Dean put it off for as long as he thought he could. He parked the car and just stayed in the driver’s seat, procrastinating. Henrickson would expect him to be waiting for him in the station, but he didn’t want to make a call like this in earshot of anyone else. For a few more minutes, he fidgeted in his seat, trying to come up with a plausible enough excuse. He couldn’t avoid not doing it when he had an FBI agent on his ass. Hopefully, this really was just for information.
All the rooms in this wing are private, so Castiel makes his way over to the specified door just down the hall and knocks politely. After a muffled response from inside, he lets himself in. There’s another tingle of magic as Castiel passes through a smaller warding just inside the door.
“No, no way. I saw him makin’ his rounds before we took off. If Rufus says he wasn’t in the cargo bay when we took off, I believe him.”
When Amelia started yelling again, Ion slapped her across the face. “Quiet!” Amelia fell silent.
Nat flaps a hand. “Oh, yeah. Poor thing’s too nervous to sleep. Do your thing.”
Taking out his forgotten phone from of his pocket, Dean eyed the closed door once more before he swiped the screen to show a new text from Benny.
Sure, sometimes people suspected, but Dean was good at staying off people’s radar for that kind of thing. He hadn’t had a real heat in over a decade, 'cause as soon as he could get suppressants, he'd been on them. Despite the obvious, it was just - Dean hated the
Jess and Sam froze and their eyes flicked to Dean before they could stop themselves. “Uh…”
Dean shook his head. “No, there’s no one else I know here.”
The sound of shifting papers avalanching to the floor roused Dean from the chair, and he peeked into the library to see Castiel muttering under his breath as he tried to pick them up again.
The comm crackled to life. “Everything’s lookin’ fine down here.” Benny replied. “AGF running good and light. Just tell me when we’re clear and up to speed enough to turn the AGF heavy. I’ll be ready.”
Castiel scowled, “You know it should-“
“Not dead.” Dean answered, and Krissy turned to watch him closely, debating something.
Castiel broke into a run at the sound, shifting in midair to sprint faster. He darted through the old forest, lighted only by the weak filter of moonlight wavering through the trees. Castiel knew these woods well, and he ran between the twisted trunks, relying on memory rather than sight. When he approached the area where he had heard the howls, a short distance from his own cabin, Castiel slowed and stopped, suddenly smelling the sharp scent of blood. He couldn’t stop here for long – he needed to get back to the house, but he shifted back to human form anyways. “Hello? Is anyone there?” Castiel asked, braving the sound for one second.
"We didn't know the Hierarchy would make such a bold move, and I had only the faintest suspicion about you at that point. Henrickson was one of my best agents; no family or friends to compromise him, but sometimes he was too nice for his own good. He wanted you to make the choice to cooperate with us on your own, but then one of my other operatives turned out to be working for the Hierarchy, and it was too late to make a different choice."
His comm lit up with searing bright light, crackling on. “Dean, wherever you are, you need to go meet Pam at the AGF room
“Watch it!” they spat, a blur of pink hair and glowing circuitry.
Dean collapsed into one of the rickety chairs around an old plastic fold-out table, groaning, as Castiel made his way to the sink. “So, Gordon got you in the leg, huh?” He rubbed at his face, fingers coming away bloody.
“Alright, once I actually see the damage, then I’ll decide what we do from there. Hopefully it’ll be an easy fix. Ready?”
“Tha-“
“Castiel.” Their appraisal of one another was broken by Daphne’s voice, and the man – Castiel it seemed– turned to the two omegas. When Daphne beckoned him closer, Castiel approached them and crouched as Daphne and the other omega talked to him quietly, nodding in response. Dean narrowed his eyes. The hell were they talking about?
Dean cursed and parked his car, clambering out to join Castiel as he made his way to the front door. “This is feeling a little above my paygrade,” Dean muttered behind him.
“Thank you, sweetheart.” Dean told her.
By the time backup got there, wheels screeching across the road as they turned onto the street, Agent Victor Henrickson was already dead.
Sammy had moved out almost a year ago after finally getting his proverbial feet back under him, and although it got a bit lonely at times, Dean was perfectly content with a bachelor pad to himself. Really. He
“Whadd’ya mean, no choice?”
Raz didn’t say anything else, just pressed her body closer. When she didn’t start purring, Dean knew she didn’t believe him. That hurt more than John’s silence.
They weren’t going to make it.
“Castiel!” someone called, startling him out of his reverie. Castiel glanced up from the stream bed where he had been staring to see Amelia walking towards him. Standing up, he faced her and clasped her outstretched arm. The swell of her stomach was just becoming noticeable now.
“Can I talk to you for a moment? Privately?”
Dean could only look between them both. “What?”
Castiel laughs in disbelief. “What, don’t recognize me,
Jess leaned in closer to Krissy and Shawn, “Don’t be fooled by his looks. He's a genius. Although, he's not breaking the stereotype by much. He has eight younger siblings back home,” she told them conspiratorially.
“Was there anyone still in-?”
Something more serious replaced the curiosity Anna had felt earlier. She flew away, off the roof.
“You suck.”
Dean dialed his brother as he made it out of his apartment and into the parking lot, waiting by the side of the road for Benny’s pickup truck. Sam picked up after a few rings.
“You’re not dying.” Castiel replied, dryly.
She knew him well. Sam shrugged and rubbed the arm under the edge of his cast.
Smiling wide, Jess met them halfway. “You made it!” She turned her gaze to the shorter two. “You must be Krissy and Shawn. It’s nice to finally meet you.” Shawn remained a step behind Krissy, so Jess shook Krissy’s hand first before bending to do the same with him. “I’ll introduce you to everyone, but I bet you two will like Ash the best.”
“And could you tell me why you searched for that particular name?”
When he met Castiel’s eyes, he cocked an eyebrow.
Knowing not to ask more, Dean gestured to the living room and turned on his heel, leading the way. His cop senses tingled with the urge to unravel the evident mystery, but he had to restrain himself. He was only there to find out what had happened to Krissy and make sure that she was in good hands. While Dean took the couch again, Castiel lowered himself into the armchair.
“Uriel won’t be pleased by such an arrogant display.” Anna remarked, her rust colored hair caught in a breeze.
After work, Dean retrieved his Baby and drove to Sammy’s house. He really needed to stop being their third wheel, but what the hell. It wasn't like they'd ever turned down a get-together with him before, especially if it included a cooked meal from the older Winchester. Parking his Baby in their driveway, he raised an eyebrow at the tiny blue monstrosity of a car also parked there.
“What about you, is your wolf side and human side different? Can you tell?”
Alistair, even pinned, was stronger than Sam. With a short snarl, Alistair writhed and head-butted Sam in the face. Stunned, Sam reared back, blood in his mouth. His hands lost their purchase, and Alistair broke free.
“Go talk to your own freaking daemon, Cas,” Dean snapped, grabbing Raz’s chair from behind and dragging it out of Cas’ reach. Raz startled at the movement and grabbed the chair cushion with her claws. “Oh wait, that’s right, you don’t have one.”
. It made Castiel feel out-of-control, impatient and restless, the need burning up all rational thought that could get in the way of satisfying it. Which he had been doing up until Dean had interrupted; he was still flushed from the exertion, and he couldn’t slow his heart from the thrumming pace it had plateaued to.
“I guess.” Not really, no. Sam had texted Dean to meet him for lunch to 'tell him something', so they were probably going to double-team him into doing something he really didn’t want to do. Sam knew Dean couldn’t say no to Jess when she pulled out the angel-eyes. They used it against him frequently.
“Man, you look terrible.” Sammy said, as soon as Dean opened the car door.
“Likewise,” Sam tells him, and after eyeing Dean suspiciously, he does a double-take. “Wait, you – you’re Castiel?”
“Also what?”
Castiel offers his hand and Sam shakes it. “It’s nice to meet you, Sam.” The strong facial features and high cheekbones are enough to give the two away as brothers, but Sam is much bigger than Dean and - in Castiel's eyes at least - not as magnetically handsome. Still, he has an easygoing demeanor that Castiel appreciates.
Arms crossed, Dean only grunted in response. His cellphone buzzed in his pocket and he took it out to find a text from Benny.
When Raz finally settled into her form, it was an inconvenience. They’d been on a hunt for days, using Raz to shift into small animals to sneak ahead, and Dean hadn’t even noticed anything was different until after the fighting had stopped.
Someone picked up after a few more rings. “I guess I shouldn’t be surprised it took you this long to call me,” the man on the other end of the line told him. He had the trace of some accent Dean couldn’t place.
. His best friend. Sweating bullets, the whole time."
They’d been hiding out for hours under a clump of trees and brush that butted up against the fence on the farthest side of the golf course AJ had told them to go to, close enough to see the road through the overgrown ivy. It had turned completely dark an hour ago, and still no sight of the car AJ had described.
i hope everyone realized it was indeed the croatoan virus in the last chapter lol. i had a heck of a time researching that (and then I realized about how castiel was put under the attack dog spell and everything is awesome now)
Before Gordon could make a move to face him, Castiel dragged him back from Dean, forcing both of his arms behind his back and making him drop the gun. Gordon snarled as Castiel slammed him headfirst into the brick wall of the building, pinning him there.
Even though the movie stereotyped their way of life in ignorance and made them out as a superstitious lot, it struck home, uncomfortably close. The ‘creatures they did not speak of’ seemed to be a crude referral to their wolf form, stalking the humans from the woods. Haunting calls of an unseen thing and the snapping of twigs in the underbrush filled Castiel with tension. He startled badly at the first sighting of the creature, a brief flash of red.
His first stop is Mr. Riggs, an elderly man who lands in the hospital for a day or two every month or so. He doesn’t usually get a central line, but it’s always harder to draw from smaller fragile veins without one. Mr. Riggs spots him immediately, pale and frail in his bed, but eyes clear and responsive. “Ah, thank god you’re working today, Castiel.”
The sun was out, though the sky held grey clouds in the west, lending warmth to the cold edge the autumn air had taken. Already, the leaves of certain trees had already begun to turn color, from blood-red to pale gold, lit up in the sunlight. The bike ride went regrettably fast for such a day. Once he’d situated his bike outside the apartment complex, he found himself walking in and up the stairs with purposeful steps, curious as to what Dean would tell him about the drugged wine. Daphne had mentioned something about Dean’s brother and a woman named Ruby, who’d been behind it, but Castiel had not been able to understand much at the time.
Castiel hugged him back a bit tighter, talking just as softly. “I’m not, Shawn. I’m just going to stay over at Dean’s place. I’ll still see you. Tomorrow, in fact. I promise.”
Ellen turned in her chair, looking back at Benny and Dean. “We’re several hours out still, so get some shut-eye before we get there. I want you two ready to help Pam if she needs it during the Gate transition.”
Castiel turns away to ready the things on his cart, almost rolling his eyes at the response, but he stops himself. He of all people knows pain brings out the worst in people. “I’ll just need to verify some information with you, and then we’ll get started. Do you consent to being compelled-“
“The hell, man?” Dean’s voice has gone sharp with annoyance. “Not joking about the hypothermia! What’d I ever do to you?”
Sam started through the side door and down the next hallway, following Alistair with heavy feet.
What Dean had thought had been the blackness of space moved and twisted, light reflecting off a massive structure. It was incredibly complex, wheels gyroscoping around the center, and shifting shape like a living thing. Fractals bloomed across its surface, streaks of multicolored lights growing slowly and streaking through the surface like silvery fish, until the whole surface glowed a pearlescent, multicolored white.
“So, have you figured it out yet?” The question brought Dean out of his reverie.
When Dean made it back to his apartment, suddenly drained of energy once the adrenaline dissipated, he could only collapse on the couch. He’d been hoping Castiel would’ve come here after the shooting, but the apartment stayed silent and empty in his absence. The phone in his pocket buzzed again – it had been buzzing all evening really, but only now did Dean check it, unsurprised to see multiple texts and calls from everyone he’d ever friggin’ met. He texted Sammy back first, just to make sure he knew Dean was alive. Charlie was next. No way was he getting off this couch to go see her. Too much work.
The next guy walking down the street was a little older than Sam, wearing cloud blue pants and a collared shirt. He slowed as Sam approached. “Excuse me, do you know where I could get my comm fixed?” He held up his wrist with a sheepish smile. “I broke it.”
“What’s it like, having Jimmy being possessed by an angel?” Millie asked, head propped up on the table.
“Fine.” Charlie sighed, getting up off of Dean to start the episode. Dean sat up and opened two beers, passing one to Charlie when she sat back down. Her feet wound up over Dean’s lap as they settled in, but he didn’t mind. Once it started, Dean relaxed, feeling the stress melt out of his muscles. It was a mind-numbing action series, just dumb enough to entertain him and just enough science fiction to interest Charlie.
The family business was trade, and the Campbells had a big warehouse on the edge of town that they used to move and ship goods to and from the Preserves, and the three practically lived and worked there all hours of the day. Dean had gotten the tour when they had first met, and he’d been surprised that the Preserves did any trading at all, but the amount of stuff in the warehouse had been staggering. Wood, vast quantities of food, textiles, medicine, machinery, the list went on and on.
“…No.” Sam admitted, and Marjorie deflated and chewed her lip in worry. “Did you notice anything off about him? Or has anything strange or different happen recently?”
Krissy grunted noncommittally. A long pause hung between them until she said, “Why are you wearing the scent blocker if you’re an alpha?” A moment’s hesitation gave him away, and Krissy’s eyes widened.
“Ready as I’ll ever be.” After another second Dean says, “Wait. Uh, actually, can you just make sure you whammy me with all you got?”
Castiel hides the disappointment that sweeps through him at those words. “Of course. I wouldn’t want to keep him waiting.”
She bent down and pulled a large bottle from underneath the counter, pushing it across the bar along with their two beers. Dean's eyebrows rose in surprise. Yeah, that would
As Dean walked into the living room, he threw a glance over his shoulder, a silent

“No! Let her go!” Sam yelled, starting towards them.
Jo nodded and stepped forward. "Got it."
Someone knocked on his door, and Dean groaned. “What?” he yelled in the direction of the door. Had Charlie come up to get the details?
Castiel only squinted in confusion at her.
Castiel only spared Gordon one more quick glance when they were done. “Tell your bosses that Castiel sends his greetings, not Jimmy. If they want what I have, then
At last, Castiel shakes his head. “No, I’d rather not.”
“What about the omega? How’s she?”
And then Dean’s eyes catch on his, and everything stops.
Two men in the dark blue uniforms of station security stopped him as he approached.
“Don’t make me guess.” Bobby groused.
“Scarily cool, huh?”
Castiel shuffled a foot. “Yes, a professor mentioned a site to do the online assignments. I don’t know how to find or access it. The first assignment is, uh, due tomorrow.”
Krissy had come to his apartment forever and a half ago.
It took Sam a few long moments to fully come out of his haze, panting from exertion. Alistair was staring up at him, unblinking, bursts of red in the whites of his eyes. Startled, Sam drew back, his hands unclenching with difficulty from around Alistair’s neck. He looked up.
“They’re not going to make it, Castiel. Please, you have to leave them and take us across the border instead.” Castiel finally noticed the small packs by Amelia’s feet, Claire clinging to her arm, wide-eyed and silent.
April 9
“Interesting.”
Dean startled badly and jerked his head away from the voice next to his ear, banging his head on the metal wall next to him. “SONOVA-“ Dean let out a pained hiss, his head throbbing from the impact.
“Please, Castiel, I – we – need to know. Something is happening in the Preserves. Surely you were aware of that, at least.”
“Oh, man, it’s some heavy-duty shit. He was part of some underground secret society thing that got omegas out of the Preserves. It got found out like three years ago, and he was the only survivor.” His stomach growled as the smell of food carried into the room.
Ellen scrolled through the data coming in and pulled up a visual map onto the screen. “See here? I figured we would come out somewhere between Middleroad and Charis station, but we’re not even close. Instead of falling short, we got shot out to the side. See – here?” There was a red gradient over the right side of the map, and the white dot of their coordinates shone from within it.
pack, Dean noticed, watching from the doorway. Not more than ten minutes later, Castiel emerged holding one duffel bag, his familiar maroon backpack slung haphazardly over one shoulder. Krissy and Shawn were waiting at the bottom of the stairs for Castiel as they made their way down.
they were good at silent conversations. Daphne put out a hand and Shawn took it, glancing back at Castiel for reassurance before she led him up the stairs.
Castiel ran a hand through his hair, messing it up even further. “I don’t know,” he admitted, after a moment. “When I found out it was a flash drive, I plugged it into a public library computer, but I couldn’t-“ he paused “-I didn’t know how to – it said it couldn’t access it. And then a police officer came to detain me not an hour later. I escaped, but I never tried again.”
Sam felt a bead of sweat track down his temple. “I can handle myself around Red just fine-“
They all stood up after coming to an agreement, Daphne supporting the other young omega by her shoulders. She turned to Dean. “A ride please?”
“You mean, like, spies and sh- stuff?”
“I told you, I-“
“Sam-“
Castiel felt his insides freeze at Dean’s blank expression.
They all ignored him, and Dean crossed his arms and huffed as Sam turned to Jessica. “But I would’ve seen his name on-“ he paused and thought it through, “unless Castiel wanted anonymity and used a different name.”
Now that she’s gone, Castiel tugs furtively at the collar again and sighs, looking over the room with a disinterested eye. Every ambassador has their own raised platform on the outskirts of the main hall as a status symbol and as a formal meeting place open for all to see, so Castiel has a good view of the room from his chair, enough to watch the crowd without standing up.
“Nice to meet’cha,” Benny drawled, smiling. Dean only mumbled something in response, still trying to take it all in.
Present Day
“I get it.” Jo said, awkwardly. “Uh, just gonna get Sam situated, but if you need anything, just use your comm to call me.” Dean watched her leave out of the corner of his eye and then turned back to unpacking what little he had. He’d probably need to ask around for things he forgot, or if he ran out of clothes, especially if he was helping in engineering.
“Don’t let them take me.” she whispered, but Castiel heard it as clear as day. He spun in place, but the earth shifted under his feet and he fell to his knees and hands, hitting dark wet loam instead of grey concrete. When he scrambled to his feet again, Claire was gone. In her place only a black night remained, a weak filter of moonlight wavering through the trees of the old forest.
Dean got a bad feeling when Benny led them over to the airlock antechamber. “Pam said there was a malfunction in the calculations for tracking space debris. Apparently one of our main sensors got hit just now before she noticed there was a problem,” Benny said, taking down one of the suits and handing it to Dean. Dean took it, mind too filled with staticky panic to even think to protest. “It’s not too late, so I’d thought we’d take care of it now and get Pam started on quality control sooner rather than later.”
“What?” Cas replied, irritated. “No.”
Dean ignored him to focus on the collar around his neck, finally unbuckling it and throwing it across the room.
(See the end of the chapter for
It’s Dean Winchester.
No one answered him.
At first, all he could see was the distant white tail of the asteroid path that had passed through the cloud layer on the horizon, but then the horizon started to
Dean felt for a pulse, slipping on blood, but he couldn’t tell if Henrickson’s pulse was too faint to be felt or if his heart had stopped completely.
He didn’t know how long it took, but eventually the pain stopped.
As soon as the tubing was in place, Castiel straightened up and checked the plants in the grow bed, absentmindedly rubbing a leaf between his fingers. The small smile he’d had on his face vanished when he finally caught sight of Dean.
“Jess!-“ Sam called out, but froze at the look on Jess’s face as the door opened for her.
Dean ripped the flyer into little pieces.
(See the end of the chapter for
Whatever it was, it came on fast. Dean shivered again and felt his stomach roll. Okay, he wasn’t hungry anymore. In fact, the smell of food was making him nauseous now. Dean finished cooking and hastily put the food away in the fridge for later before his stomach twisted again and he felt his throat involuntarily tighten. Shit.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Yes, I uh, am helping him with catching the criminal who drugged us both.”
“You fucking
“…He’s, uh, he’s from the Preserves.”
which Castiel had somehow gotten in the very beginning, and Krissy refused to lend him any more money. He could only scowl and slam the rest of his money down in front of Castiel while Krissy and Shawn laughed at his misfortune. Even Castiel couldn’t help but smile as well, gums showing as his nose crinkled up. Krissy almost took the lead with some underhanded tactics, but eventually Castiel won, despite not really knowing what to do at all still. He was a lucky bastard, Dean would give him that.
Ellen looked them all over. “Not much to tell so far. Our stow-away isn’t very coherent at the moment. Ash says he’s lucky to be alive.” She pinned Dean and Sam with a direct stare. “Though he seems to know the two of you. The only thing we can make out from his gibberish is your name, Dean.”
“Tell me more about Ruby?” Castiel asked, breaking the quiet, “How is she involved in this?”
Blueshift : noun, astronomy.
“And he still agreed to have me help?”
“Two or three people, I think.”
Faint whispers drew his attention down. There was an old wooden door in the center of the room, hinged snugly into a thin doorframe, standing by itself.
Castiel takes a step back, gesturing to the seats on the low dais that are reserved for him and any guests he has with him. The running joke about him and empty chairs is usually rather apt, but he’s glad to break the mold this time. “Would you like to sit down and keep me company? I can’t leave until the day has ended.”
“Dean?” Castiel called out, walking between the towering piles of dilapidated cars.
Dean paused for a half-second before answering. “At some hotel. Why?”
“I don’t have all day, you know,” the man told them, sitting down again and propping his cane against the table.
Castiel shrugged after a beat. “I’ve never-“
A few minutes later, Dean found himself making quesadillas, stomach rumbling loud at the smell of melting cheese. Since he was making them, Dean was going to eat the first two while the next were cooking, and he wasn't gonna be sorry about it, dammit.
“So what, suddenly the guy is above all reproach?"
“No,” Marjorie said, drawing it out strangely, “well, um, we actually wanted to move John to a long-term care facility since he’s stabilized, but we haven’t been able to contact Dean in a few days. He usually comes by at least every other day, but…” she trailed off, uncertain, before asking, “have you talked to him recently?”
He paced a bit on the sidewalk as it rang, and rang, and rang without being answered, but just as Sam was waiting for the voicemail to start up, the ringing stopped, replaced by a voice.
?!?” Dean cut her off, voice rising. “What- I- he can’t be in here!”
“Hael, Ephraim, you’d kill a member of your own pack? For what?” Castiel asked, and Ephraim looked away, though Hael pressed her dagger deeper into Castiel’s neck.
Dean still had him by the shoulders and shook him a little bit. “I’ve been looking everywhere for you! Weren’t you on the school evac flier?” Sam finally noticed that Dean looked just as haggard as he probably looked, dark smudges under his eyes and hair in disarray.
For a moment, Sam paused to take a deep breath, and then he walked forward until the cell’s occupant came into view.
Dean didn’t know the answer to that. “Get over here.” Reluctantly, Alfie complied, favoring his right arm. “I want you to keep pressure on these wounds – one here on the front and the other on his back. Can you do that for me?”
Balthazar laughs. “You, darling, are not wrong.”
“That’s – a relief.” Dean looks down and fiddles with the plate he still has in his hands.
He heard her leave and then found himself on his back, listening to a new voice, when he concentrated again. “- a few questions for me, okay?”
“Funny thing about the virus strain they made, well, besides the name they called it, the Croatoan virus, if you can believe it, was a quirk they found and amplified. Behaviorally, with any strain of rabies, infected alphas and some betas become very aggressive once they’ve reached a certain stage, and the rest of the betas and omegas just…waste away. They worked with my department on trying to find out the processes behind that – I left before they did, and I can’t imagine they figured it out after – but in a very small percentage, very strange things started to happen.”
Just the possibility that Dean had- that Jess had-
“Did you hear that?” Castiel asked, cocking his head.
The next time Dean saw Cas, he showed up on the Impala, naked and covered in bees, and tried to convince Dean that one was his daemon.
“What do you mean? You don’t even know how to use a laptop.”
With a little bit of finagling, they managed to sync their comms so the guard – Cal, he’d told him – could transfer him a layout of the station and highlight the path to the med bay.
“Yes ma’am,” Benny replied, and pushed off from the wall backwards, twisting around midair and floating to the entrance with practiced ease. Dean watched him nervously before making his way out as well, one arm always in reach of a handhold.
It was torture to hold off the rut for a just a little bit longer, and he found himself sitting on the edge of the bed as close to the window as possible, a bead of sweat dripping down the hollow of his back. It still smelled like sex in here, courtesy of himself, and he shifted uncomfortably. Castiel hadn’t heard anyone come up the stairs yet, although he still heard the faint tone of voices downstairs, maybe if he was fast, he could-
They still hadn’t been apart for more than ten minutes since.
Dean roamed the aisles, trying to shake himself out of his mood, as he got the rest of what he needed. Usually he could wait until his two days off rolled around to go grocery shopping, but he’d forgotten to go last weekend. He'd been scrounging off of weird combinations all week, but he had run out of coffee this morning. A sucky day all around, really. Everyone else in town seemed to be at the store as well, based on the lines. The lady in front of him had to go through her whole purse to dig out her coupons, ignoring her two kids, who ran circles around the checkout aisles, screaming at the top of their lungs. He wanted to claw his face off.
“Dean, are you okay?” Sam asked a little later, and Dean realized all three of them were staring at him, looking very concerned.
“I want to stay and watch,” Sam said, wide-eyed.
Sam was frozen in place, and it took his brain a long time for another thought to crash into this new feeling.
“Hopefully that won’t be necessary. How much longer until you’ve recovered enough to get us out of here?”
She went down instantly, screaming in pain, and Dean rocked forward, going for the gun. Gordon, anticipating this, stepped out of reach and swung the gun at Dean’s face.
“Hold on, lemme find Samuel really quick. You’ll want to talk to him first.” Sam frowned and opened his mouth, but the muffled noise of a hand being placed over the receiver stopped him. Sam sighed, relegated to waiting for this Christian to find Samuel. He scuffed his shoe against the sidewalk, hitting a pebble and watching it clatter over the curb to the pavement below.
“No detours, okay?”
Dean finally looked up at Henrickson. “Why are you telling me all this?” He didn’t need to know any of this information. He was a freakin’ college town policeman, not anyone special.
“Jess!” Sam shouted, trying to push through. He saw her face and then she was gone, lost in the sea of people. “Jess!”
“And you can’t bear to say no to your alpha, of course.” Balthazar said, tone dry.
Castiel undid the belt without too much trouble, and by that time Dean had shrugged out of his own shirt, and then shed the jeans after a few more seconds. Castiel drank in the sight of freckled shoulders and flushed skin.
He was alone. Shawn now slept in Krissy’s bed now that her heat was over. He was safe here. No doubt the encounter with the professor had stirred up bad memories, but nothing else had come of it. Not yet, anyways.
She had opened the door further, stepping out of the way, and Dean headed into the house towards the stairs before she could protest. “-Dean! Wait! What’s wrong?”
“Orion.” Dean craned his head around to look for it. “Not seeing it though.” The constellation fit Dean perfectly now that Castiel thought about it. The Hunter.
There was a crazy moment where Dean couldn’t place himself, turning in place with only one hand anchoring him down, his harsh breathing the only noise filling his ears.
In an entirely unsurprising turn of events, Castiel found himself roped into helping out in the morning; the curse of being
. I decided I’d introduce him to modern society.”
He bit at Castiel’s lips and grabbed at his shirt, enough for Castiel to get the message. They both fumbled Castiel’s shirt off, and then the uncomfortably tight jeans and boxers.
The three nurses ignored the two of them as they wheeled the cot down the hall and disappeared around a corner.
Once Castiel had left, Dean went back to the living room to take out the DVD and put it away, muttering curses to himself. He hadn’t meant to be so much of a douche – of course he’d been a bit hesitant about it, but The Village was the only movie about the Preserves he could think of to show Cas that he knew. But Cas was always stoic as shit, so Dean thought he’d only squirm a little before Dean could throw out an off-hand comment about knowing his secret, and leave it at knowing there was a mutually assured destruction scenario in place. Admittedly, it was a dumb idea, but once in his head there was no getting it out. He'd almost dropped it once Charlie cancelled movie night to Skype her girlfriend, but then the opportunity arose one last time and he couldn’t help himself.
“The hell-“ Dean said, turning to look at the object he’d run into.
Lunch was a quick affair, once Charlie convinced Dean to make it for them.
“Dean Winchester. So, how is she?”
Charlie pointed the remaining half of the sword at him. “You freaking snuck into my apartment at like, eight in the morning! You-” She finally noticed Castiel. “Wait, Castiel?” Her eyes flicked between the two of them. “What is this about?”
“Well, good news and bad news fellas,” Ash said, still typing away on his comm. “Good news is, Sam is fit as a fiddle physically. The picture of health, if you will.”
The other side of the room stared back at him through the empty doorframe.
Dean ignored Daphne’s insistent tugging and unlocked it, opening the door.
Dean yawned, and Castiel considered him, blinking.
Though it’s tempting, Castiel can’t bring himself to do any serious physical harm, but he grapples with Dean as he tries to open the door wider.
forgive Castiel for something he had no control over. It wasn’t too long ago that he’d been on Castiel’s end, lashing out at unsuspecting people waking him up from his own nightmares. This was just the first time Dean had been the recipient. And now he knew how not fun it was in either position.
“What do
“DEAN!” Jo yelled at him, and Dean whirled around.
Cold fingers of dread crept up his spine.
They’d been very right about that.
“Really, I can’t get my belt off.”
Sam shook his head and ducked out of the room, looking to talk to Marjorie in person. Luckily, a matronly nurse with the name-tag
“Oh yeah? What?”
Sam had been leery getting into all this, but Ruby was adamant. She loved her family, and wanted them to love Sam almost as much as she did. Ruby couldn’t change the family she was born into, and Sam had to accept that.
Charlie rolled her eyes. “I’m dropping Castiel off at his house. Need anything from the store?”
At that, Castiel’s frown deepened into a scowl. “It doesn’t matter whether you believe her or not, Dean. We need to listen to what she can tell us. Even if Ruby is no longer a threat, this is not the end of it. I am not being pursued by a lone agent.”
“A colleague of sorts. Jimmy never told you what he actually worked on, did he?”
“Castiel,” Uriel greeted. “I should have known you’d get involved with this. Always the bleeding heart.”
Dean shrugged Castiel’s hand off his shoulder. “I don’t need your fucking sympathy,” he snapped, not turning around.
Dean looks him over for a long moment and seems to accept the apology. He sighs. “No, I asked for it. Don't have to apologize for that."
“No-“ Pam told him, “no, I think our receptor is working fine. Listen.” Pam fiddled with the console in front of her, and then the speakers let out a high pitched hum, like the feedback loop in a speaker.
The hand on his collar moved up and tightened in Dean’s hair, pulling his head back sharply. “I know what you’re doing, Dean. I’m the one asking the questions, and I can do a lot more than that with you sitting pretty on your knees like that. So. Where is he?”
There was a suit, he knew that much, ripped open to the void of space. Slowly, so slowly, it was repairing itself – fibers weaving together out of thin air, the glass of the shattered helmet visor spider-webbing back into place.
He was gone.
Cas didn’t get it. “I see.”
“Yeah, I’m actually-“
“What did Castiel do?” Benny asked, and Dean blinked and looked around at that.
“Oh.”
Just as Dean turned back to the task of rescuing the rest of his stuff, black shoes walked into view, right in front of him.
He should’ve known better than to show such a suspenseful movie to an omega from the Preserves in hiding. God, he was stupid.
“Jess,” Sam yelled over the sirens, “how long does it take for shuttles to get to space?”
Castiel didn’t say anything to that, but he slid his empty glass over, and Dean took the hint.
Closed his eyes.
Charlie darted forward immediately and Dean stepped out of her way. Cas paused in walking forward, as though just remembering something. “May I use your restroom to wash up beforehand?”
“I think he saved me, Dean,” Sam said, and that seemed to be enough for Dean.
The Roadhouse did not appear as impressive in the remaining daylight as it had in the full dark. Last he had been here, the glow of the neon signs had not illuminated the building as the unforgiving sun did now. Castiel still thought it had a certain charm about it, one of character and a long history, despite the flaws now revealed. Daphne did not look like she thought the same. One glimpse of it through the windshield, and her eyebrows rose for a split second in sudden judgement before she remembered herself. She got over it fast enough, recovering even before pulling into the parking lot. Jessica had texted him the time and assured him that minors were allowed until later in the evening, so Shawn and Krissy immediately climbed out of the backseats as well when Daphne parked. The slamming of their car doors was sharp and loud in the relative silence; the only other sounds were of the distant cars behind them, passing on the road as the remaining sunlight scintillated over their windshields and stained the old wooden façade in front of them a ruddy brown.
Dean sighed dramatically but stilled his leg again. He hadn’t thought guard duty was going to be so soul-suckingly
“We do have a rec room, you know.” After a moment, Joshua added, “If you want to relax with no one around, go to the AGF room. Nothing prettier than active AGF metal.”
“Then just tell me.”
Once freed, she clutched at her leg, putting pressure over the bullet hole and hissing at the pain. “
Krissy struggled to keep her mouth in a reasonably small smile, and didn't say anything, but Shawn had no such social qualms. “What’s wrong with your hair?”
He called Dean.
Dean tried to look contrite. “Sorry. Sam told me to come get you.”
“What picture?”
Castiel gestured back to the entrance to the water filtration room.
There was a pause.
“That same day as the tip, a man named Alistair was found dead in his home. Murdered. He was eventually identified as one of the alphas in charge of the trafficking ring, and a suspect was never found for his murder. No one looked very hard, I should say. But, no matter. He met an appropriate fate. If I ever met his killer, I'd probably shake his hand.”
Hephaestus had been a mining colony, digging up veins of the AGF metal to power ships out of what many had jokingly referred to as a graveyard of a planet.
was wearing Sam like a meat puppet? How long?”
“It’s Ruby – she – Dean, she broke into our
Raz only let Lisa touch her once, after Ben had gone to bed one night. They’d watched a movie with the sound down, heavy-lidded and sleepy, worn out from a week of work. When the credits started rolling, Raz brushed against Lisa’s legs, staring up at her, expectant. Lisa had looked over at Dean, eyes sharp, but Dean couldn’t say anything, only watched as she bent over and petted Raz.
“Alright, alright, put that thing away,” Bobby said, “enough lollygagging.”
He just had to find the Impala again. Find Dean again.
When Dean made no other move, Castiel turned back to watch the show, and Dean, being the coward he was, did the same.
“Improve upon it?” Castiel parroted.
“Jimmy Novak.” The man said, and smiled. “It’s nice to finally meet you.”
When Castiel approached his cabin, where the two omegas were currently being hidden, he paused at the tree line. A faint light shone through his window. Frowning, he picked up the pace, heading for the door. He had told them both to not turn the lamp on when he wasn’t home, and yet they had, putting themselves and the Underground at risk with such a small inconsistency. It was bad enough he seemed to have gotten their sickness, based on his sore throat and runny nose, though as a full Shifter, his immune system would likely only keep it at that while the two null omegas languished under high fever and shakes.
“How the hell did he get on board?“ Bobby asked, but Rufus shook his head and tapped his comm, warily keeping the stranger in view.
Castiel looked around the apartment from where he was standing while he waited for Dean to appear. A few posters of classic cars and bands he didn’t know adorned the walls above a couch and two sturdy looking chairs, and old dirty boots haphazardly lined the bottom of the wall next to the door. Compared to his own space, Dean’s apartment appeared spotless, but still had its own, if utilitarian, personality.
After a moment’s hesitation, he started walking down the left passageway. The floor was of the same smooth gray material as the curved walls, almost like stone or marble, but his feet did not make a sound.
Sipping his coffee, Castiel watched them both get ready and leave, raising a hand as they disappeared out to the car. Once he was done, he put the empty coffee cup next to the sink before going to get his own backpack and trenchcoat from the front hall. It was going to be a long day.
“Woah,” Benny chuckled. “Knock on wood, brother. I’ll tell you I told you so later.”
Ori shifted on Jimmy’s shoulder. “It’s like the connection is…muted,” she finally said. “Jimmy is still there, but he’s not, at the same time.”
“Alright then. What’s your name?”
After Castiel’s last class, they went directly to Daphne’s house, since Castiel had promised Shawn he’d come visit as soon as possible – which happened to be just after Shawn got home from school. His face lit up like a Christmas tree when he caught sight of the trench-coated figure, and he talked excitedly about some games he’d found in the attic when he had been exploring the house. Krissy was still at work, but Daphne had been standing in the doorway since Shawn had come running out.
at lying. Dean withheld a wince.
(See the end of the chapter for
“What’s going on?” Ellen asked from behind him, making Dean startle badly.
Dean fumbled his phone out of his pocket and dialed Cas’ number four times before he gave up. Did Cas not get the text from Charlie before because he didn’t have his phone, or was he already-? Maybe it wouldn’t hit him as hard because he was a T-1, but Dean was not taking that chance. Maybe it just hit him harder, all at once, with his metabolism.
“I came to ask what my brothers were doing on the surface, walking in human hosts.”
There are a couple of dark haired selkies talking to a witch nearby, all putting their heads close together in deep discussion, and a group of shapeshifters showing off to some begrudging familiars. Even a few demons have decided to play nice enough to get past the warding around the building and join the crowd. Based on the revealing clothing, the two horned individuals he sees by the food table are a succubus and incubus. The third person they have crowded between the two of them seems to be a man, and after a moment they are all jostled closer to Castiel’s side of the room, and he turns just enough for Castiel to recognize him.
“I don’t know who else is after me.” Castiel replied. “I’ll need to go before anyone else gets here, if-“
“Well, I’ll be damned.” Benny muttered, almost admirably.
Castiel rubbed his thumb over the back of Dean’s hand before he let go. “But you don’t.”
He nodded and closed the door, absorbing this new information. With a meeting like that, the man that had just passed him was in the omega protection program. Why the hell was he so concerned that Castiel had seen him? He couldn't be a threat if he could live in a safe-house. Every time Dean heard the name, he'd gotten another piece of a puzzle that didn't goddamn fit together.
“Get them into the van,” one of them said from above him, “I’ll search the house.”
Debating for a minute, Dean finally put the photo display on his desk and tilted it just so.
No one replied.
He waves her off with a half-smile, listens to her sneakers squeak back down the hallway as he turns back to finish setting up the blood drive stations.
Dean did as he was told. He tended to do that when he had a gun pointed at him. “What the fuck do you think you’re doing, Gordon?” Dean asked, kicking his own gun away from him, watching it skitter over the uneven pavement. Krissy remained silent behind him.
The professor just shook his head in response. A silence descended, broken only by the growl of an engine on the road, both men illuminated faintly for a second by the passing headlights. “So, do you mind if I ask - how did it happen?”
“Andrea says hi, by the way.”
He was naked apart from the leather collar around his neck, bruises darkening his pale skin.
“How-?”
want?” he hissed at Castiel, still hovering on the balls of his feet, ready to escape.
Castiel glanced up from making the bed to the door where Shawn hovered. “Almost done.” Shawn jerked his head in a quick nod, and Castiel turned back to his work. Smoothing out the covers and picking up the pillows from the floor, Castiel placed them just so before stepping back and putting his hands on his hips. It looked passable enough for a pull-out sofa bed. “It’s all yours,” he told Shawn, who immediately crawled into the covers and sat in the middle, legs crossed. He still looked and smelled miserable.
There’s a minute where he eyes the entrance, silent, but then Castiel picks up his clothes and goes back into his room.
One of the other alphas covered up a guffaw with a hasty cough. Gordon lost the smile but didn’t break the stare. The red of the smoldering embers at the end of his cigarette reflected in his eyes. He exhaled slowly before speaking, the smoke disappearing in the still, heavy air. The other alphas kept quiet, watching them. “Careful now, Dean. One might think you’re interested if you keep bringing it up.”
Groans went through the line.
“Yeah, a little bit, so I’m definitely feeling it. Pretty sure Benny is calling an ambulance right now.”
It really is a shame.
It was almost too impossible to believe this was even happening. Sam could only watch as the fireball ate up most of the horizon, sending dark plumes of earth into the upper atmosphere. The clouds rose towards them as they folded upwards from the shockwave. People were shouting in alarm all around him now, but he couldn’t look away.
Unwilling to go in just yet, Castiel walked to the far end of the parking lot away from the street. A black car sat at the far edge of the parking lot, shining dark under the clear night sky. It faced the field behind the Roadhouse, so Castiel deliberated for a moment before sitting gingerly on the front bumper, looking out over the tall grass into the sky.
Sam searched the house for any clues, but the only worrying thing he found were opened medical bills on the table, and Dean’s laptop, sitting patiently on his bed. Sam made his way back to the living room and collapsed on the couch, chest tight with the worry that had not left him in days.
“Sure thing.” Dean made his way to the end of the hallway, the sound of two voices coming from her office. The door was open just a sliver, allowing him to hear the conversation from outside the room.
He wasn't prepared to have anything stop them. A hard tug backwards was all that was needed for Sam to lose his grip on her hand.
“We just got a call from a girl working at the Virginia Inn, says two men came in to look at Henrickson’s room. They weren’t in uniform so she just called to make sure they were real officers. The descriptions sounded like you and Castiel.”
-The girl was running away through the branches-
Castiel, the only survivor of the Underground to escape the Preserves, sitting in Dean’s kitchen early in the morning because Dean had fucked up.
Castiel feels his own expression freeze in place. For a second, he thinks he should still be in bed, asleep, suffering from a horrible nightmare.
“You want eggs or what?” Dean asked, finally. He always made breakfast for himself when he had the time, so it wasn’t too much trouble to make something for another person. Hopefully Castiel wouldn’t eat him out of house and home like Sammy used to.
talking to me, Ruby.” Dean growled, head bent down next to hers. “I know you’re the one behind all this shit. I expected you to go after Sam and his wife, and even bring your sick drug dealer habit with you, but giving Gordon the order to
