He waved and sat down. There were “aws” and murmurs of “sweet boy” and “wows” coming from all areas of the auditorium.
“Alright, come. Let her up, Jack,” Castiel said holding back a laugh. Just as he started rolling up the blanket, Jack let out another earth shattering fart as Claire screamed, “NOOOOooooooooo!”
In the kitchen, Castiel had ended up seated on a barstool before the island counter, and Dean was rummaging through the fridge and shelves to find pans and spatulas. Somewhere along the line, they'd both chosen to have pancakes. Castiel was excited beyond compare, although he wouldn't show it. Having Dean cook for him, rather
"Nah," Dean chuckled, "-god, oh god, that's— you posted that twenty minutes ago? Damn, you must be an attention whore for
Blood trickled down Alastair's face, from his nose and lips, and with the way his nose had been crushed, Dean knew he'd had to get a whole
Thin, white come splattered against his stomach as he came with a breathless cry of
"Suspension is too light, those sons of bitches should be in jail, but they won't. They're loaded, after all. Besides, we'd need evidence, a proper report case, enough support to the allegation— it's complicated."
Dean blinked, and stared at him strangely before following Castiel's eyes.
The curtains parted, and rushing through them came Mr. Singer, whose old, concerned eyes roamed across Castiel's face, before he trudged over to Castiel, and ran a hand down Castiel's hair. "How ya' feelin', son?"
Dean's eyes trailed over to the front bench, which was empty today, but was usually occupied by Cas, who would arrange his notebooks and textbooks lecture-wise, and his pens and pencils on the side. It was the tidiest desk in class, if you ask Dean. A few feet away, were three more empty desks— as they should have been. Alastair, Nick, and Gordon.
Since I made you guys wait for so long the past week and also suffer, here is some fluff, a smidge of smut, and a lil dash of hurt/comfort.
sure. Hey, wait," He said suddenly, and his eyes lit up. Castiel
"Well, you know what I say, only love makes a house turn into a home." Dean chimed in, and both Castiel and Sam giggled. "By the way, Sammy," He added, "—we wanted to make a website. Or like a forum. Think you can help us with it?"
"Fuck, baby, I love you so much—" Dean grunted, holding Castiel's head in his hand as he dove down to seize Castiel's neck in a ferocious littering of bruises and bites and nips. Castiel held onto Dean's shirt, rocking back and forth with every thrust, every push, every pounding.
A palpable shudder coursed through Dean, and both of their eyes met for a second, before Dean was pushing his tongue into his cheek and suppressing a smirk, hands already traveling down to the metallic buckle of his belt.
"Gonna' come, Cas—"
(See the end of the chapter for
, but he couldn't resist how
Castiel wondered if he told Dean.
But not Dean.
Dean went silent for a minute.
"Woah, hold it— Novak? Dude, have some standards—"
"C-can you go back to your seat, A-Alastair?" Castiel stuttered, and hung his head down, not wanting to meet Alastair's eye.
"Y-yes—"
"Dean talks to you about me?"
With every word Castiel said, Dean only felt his chest tighten. It wasn't until Castiel sniffled, and pressed against Dean's chest for comfort that Dean could even think right again. All he could think of was how he would twist every single bone in Alastair's body if he ever saw the boy again. But then Castiel words rung through his mind.
When their eyes met, Castiel was glowing once again.
"I'd love to, let me check with dad though, okay?" Dean sighed. As much as he'd love to go over to the Novak's, to meet Castiel's parents, and Castiel himself, it all depended on his father. His father, who Dean found out a few minutes later, was sprawled out on the couch with a six-pack lying empty next to him. The television played some old, eighties sitcom, and John laughed at every humourless joke.
so inhumanely, so pathetically, with such ruthlessness— Dean wanted to kill Alastair, he really did. He wanted to crush every bone, every tendon, every nerve in Alastair's body, and light it up on fire until nothing remained but ash; even then, he wanted to drill a hundred thousand bullets into Alastair's body, so many that all that would be left of Alastair was a mush of flesh and skin.
"I was scared," The boy admitted quietly, and Dean grabbed a fistful of his hair to yank his head back as he stared into the pools of his eyes.
"Now that's like a good boy."
Castiel darted his eyes around the crowd, and shifted from one leg to the other, squeezing his bottle tightly in his hand before turning to glance at Dean, "-erm, Benny told me you were here already, I didn't—"
Castiel drifted closer and closer to the edge of his orgasm, losing balance and conscience of the world around him as he felt the telltale tickle of his climax building, and building— only to fizzle out when Dean pulled his hand away. "No—" Castiel groaned, and opened his eyes to find Dean smirking down at him.
brushing their hands together, making Castiel squirm— what a sick fucking creep.
"Do you want to talk about it?"
Dean felt his heart pound in his chest.
"I'm close too, gonna' come soon, Cas."
"It's no worries."
Broad, callous hands slipped into Castiel's slender, soft ones, and his round, blue eyes dropped down to stare at their twined hands for a moment, before he was letting out the softest of breaths.
"What a good lil' baby slut I've got for me here," the man laughed, and buckled his trousers, before turning away.
A sharp slap landed on Castiel's ass, and he almost jumped off the couch.
"If you refuse, I won't have a single problem leaking this video out to the school blog. I'd be anonymous of course, you though, not so much," He whispered, and Castiel felt his feet carry him backwards, until Dean had him cornered against the wall, his thick, broad arms planted on either side of Castiel's head as he stared down fiercely, mischief lingering in his smirk.
"Cas, I'm not— I swear—"
, before traveling down. Right as he went to tap on it, a voice called out from behind him that had his blood turning cold.
"How?"
Castiel stood on a step-ladder with his back to Dean, immersed in the thought of finding a particular book. His uniform was slightly rumpled, and his hair, a mess as always, and yet, Dean couldn't help but wonder about how absolutely
"I don't usually open up to people, I'm sorry, I don't know what came over me," Dean sighed, and shook his head, as if trying to reboot his system, and Castiel smiled, letting his hand slide down to Dean's jaw.
Silence settled between them, and Castiel let himself drink in the sight of Dean, beautiful as always, glowing in the dregs of sunlight pouring in through the narrow window at the top of the empty corridor. His eyes were deep, not the usual apple-green, but a new, bittersweet ivy-green, as he stared down at Castiel. Behind his eyes, Castiel could see hesitation. Perhaps, he wanted to say something, do something, and Castiel wondered if it was the same thing Castiel wanted to do.
Dean stomped forward, only for Castiel to pull him back, and Dean glared back at him, before turning to Nick and Gordon, his fists clenched and ready for blood.
But they were
"Morning dad."
"Hey, Cas, baby, it's okay, you're okay, it's fine, it's fine, you're fine, nothing's gonna' hurt you, sweetheart, hey, Cas," Dean's voice trembled, "—Cas—" And Castiel let his sobs fade away into the fabric of Dean's uniform. Silence spread all around them, until at last, a few moments later, Castiel rubbed his face against Dean's shirt, and turned his gaze up to meet Dean's. Dean's eyes were glassy and brimming with worry, and he wrapped an arm around Castiel to keep him close.
"So, lunch? Benny and Meg might be waiting for us. We've got to put down some plans for the website too." Castiel said, and tugged Dean along to the cafeteria.
Please read end notes after the chapter.
"That won't be necessary. Understanding your deal with its obvious loopholes is already a tedious task in itself, I don't know how you expect me to do so intoxicated."
Dean hummed around his cock, and carefully spread Castiel's legs apart, eyes bright and filled with mirth as he sucked Castiel, laving his tongue around every crevice and curve, licking at his frenulum, soaking the head with spit, sucking and nipping. It was strange how Dean could fit Castiel's whole cock inside his mouth, of course, given it was smaller than average.
"I'm not in the mood, Alastair. Please, just leave. I swear, you can bully me all you want on Monday, not today."
"Say it again, louder, I didn't hear you." Dean growled, and leaned over Castiel's shoulder, biting down on the curve of his neck, marking him up and kissing his bruised skin.
, and yet.
"Don't walk to school. I'll pick you up and drop you home."
An awkward silence settled between the three, before Dean pointed over at Meg.
"I just, I love you a lot, Cas. And it's scary as fuck, cause I don't even know what I'd do one day if I didn't have you. You're my— you're my life, Cas. Every dream I've ever had, every fleeting moment of affection in my life, every thought of my tomorrow, that's you, Cas. You're everywhere. And I don't know what I'd do, or how I'd end up if I didn't have you. This— this
Silence followed his words, not because Castiel hadn't heard Dean, but he'd decided to ignore him for a few seconds in favour of actually thinking about a strategy to gain a strong support for his group. Getting people to sign up did not seem to be an easy thing, but Castiel needed to make this work. For his own sake, and for the sake of every person Alastair had ever hurt, Castiel would get them justice, but not violently, the way Dean had— in a way that was peaceful and yet permanent. Castiel thought about the people he could rope in and ask for guidance, out of which one name outshone the others.
"Wh-what favour?"
Dean levelled Michael with a grin. "If it means winning, I'm afraid I'll have to be content with you hating me a little."
"Are you drinking a whole bottle of beer?"
Castiel's eyes snapped back towards the passage, and he sighed, rolling his eyes and tossing the piece of chocolate into his mouth as he walked over to the door to answer.
"Someone like...
Behind him, Dean and the others walked out the library, leaving Gordon and Nick alone with Castiel. Castiel couldn't meet their eyes, he simply couldn't, so he stared down at his feet.
Dean let the words sink into his chest as he played them in his mind, on repeat in an endless loop. Castiel was sick of him. Castiel was sick of Dean. And Castiel could much rather be with someone better. Someone who thought of Castiel before themselves. Someone who could deserve Castiel. And that's when Dean realised. Maybe it was better if he never called. Maybe it was better if they went their own, separate ways.
Castiel hummed again. His eyes wandered across the shelf, as he seemed to ponder upon Dean's question, before grabbing a book and seating himself at the table. He didn't respond, but Dean was curious, so he sat himself down next to Castiel, and turned to him expectantly.
"Yes, Mr. Winchester?"
by his boyfriend, who seemed to ramble on to Bobby about their plan. Castiel felt Mr. Singer's eyes study him for a few moments, but he couldn't bother to care as he stared up at Dean.
"Without the prep?"
Dean nodded, and rose up from the seat, as did the others. Castiel stayed by Dean's side every second, silently reassuring Dean with small squeezes to his hand and wide smiles. It was adorable. And then there was Michael, whom Dean had begun to like. The man wasn't as stern as Dean had thought him to be, and hey, he was good at conversations, and a fellow classic-car enthusiast. Nothing could top that. Even as they headed down to the dining room, Michael indulged Dean in a conversation about a story he heard from his father, as in Castiel's grandfather, about the Ford Mustang, and Dean listened with intent, asking questions and humming along routinely to keep Michael engaged.
to hurt— but Dean knew how big of a pervert Cas was. He fucking loved the pain, loved being used like a cheap whore.
But when he neared the window, he realised only a few lights were on, and most of them were dim, yellow fixtures that didn't do much to brighten the house. Slowly, he tried to open up the window, but failed. It was locked, so Dean grabbed his pocket knife, and jammed it into the hinge to pop the window open. He jumped inside the house as quietly as he could, and the room he was in was empty, but the open door allowed him to glance into the dark passageway.
Dean blinked.
Around a hour later, the five of them walked out of Principal Berry's office at last. They had given her everything she had needed, and Castiel could swear he'd seen her flinch at a few points as he told her his story, and then Meg did too. They didn't tell it in complete detail, but enough to make her feel repulsed by Alastair. Dean had held onto Castiel's hand through it all, and Castiel was thankful for the support. Benny had acted as witness, and the five of them had also given names of others at school who had gone through evident bullying by Alastair and his friends.
And behind him, Nick and Gordon, as always.
you're better."
But Castiel knew Dean, and he knew what a stubborn son of a bitch Dean was. He wouldn't give in until he had prepped Castiel to the fullest. No matter how much Castiel would scream or beg for Dean's cock, Dean would never give it to him until Dean had made sure to squeeze and massage every crevice inside Castiel. Some times, it was as if Dean considered Castiel to be a porcelain doll with how delicately he treated him. But then again, on the nights Castiel lay in bed with Michael facing away from him, it was these very delicate touches that would keep Castiel's mind at ease.
WARNING: This chapter heavily implies rape, although it will not be graphic in anyway. Please, please read the warnings of the fic. The rape is not between Dean/Castiel, but Castiel/other character.
That being said, I do hope that you continue to support this fic as you always have, and that your comments (although I don't tend to respond) are the very reason that I continue to write my fanfics.
"How dare you point fingers at me in my own damn house? You think I'm not a good mother? And who do you think you are to tell me what a mother should be like, when you don't even have one yourself?"
So he barged into the bathroom of the club, and held onto the edge of the sink to calm his breathing. Not a moment later, somebody else barged into the bathroom, and Dean glared up at whoever did. It was Castiel.
Their eyes met, and Benny let out a shaky breath.
"Mhm, I want to look at you when you're inside me."
But Dean also knew what Castiel was talking about. He just did.
"He isn't at the front," Dean answered, and at once, both boys turned to the flight of stairs behind them.
Silence followed Castiel's words, and he felt his vision begin to blur and blink out of focus.
I couldn't resist posting this chapter. However, chapter 6 will follow the schedule.
"I— I should get myself some pants—"
people considered him to be at school. The wind seemed to tangle through his hair and kiss his face, leaving a soft pink blush on his nose and cheeks, and as Dean watched, he noticed it rose up to the tips of Castiel's ears.
Castiel pouted, and narrowed his eyes at Dean. "Please? Once, just once, I'll never ask again. Please, Dean, I didn't even know you played— you have to do this for me, please?"
Castiel passed himself a once-over in the window of his car, a sleek, black BMW M4, and sighed. He was dressed in a black turtle-neck, a grey trouser and a golden belt (his mother had good fashion taste. It was one of her recommendations). He ran a hand through his hair to muss it, and sent his driver one final glance before stepping out of the car. A few eyes raked over him, and moreso over his car, as he sauntered his way up to Benny's farmhouse, and walked in through the open front door.
Which is why when he skipped his way into class at eight on a Monday morning, ready for the History test, he had a smile on his face. His uniform was tidy as always, and his hair brushed and artfully tousled, not a spick on his polished leather boots.
"I'm not sure. I planned to say
, it really does—" Castiel cried out, and Dean lowered his wrist, only to twist it behind Castiel's back and pin him to the wall. Dean laughed, watching as Castiel struggled for a moment, before
"You makin' eggs? Again? Didn't we have those yesterday too?"
Silence settled between them for a while, with Castiel simply watching Dean, and Dean continuing to smoke, his eyes trailing across the picturesque scenery behind them. Trees, hill tops, and soft, foggy clouds.
He said he was sick of Dean.
It wasn't a lie. Castiel did need Dean. Now, then, later, forever.
Castiel nodded, dumbstruck.
"Uhm," Dean faltered, "—Mr. Singer. He's a friend of my father, but he's more of a father to me than my real one has ever been. I talked to him about Alastair, and about Cas, he said getting Alastair officially suspended is hard, but if we have enough support and evidence, with a majority of students backing the allegation, the school won't have any other choice but to suspend them."
"I'm sorry. I know I don't deserve your forgiveness, hell, not in the slightest. But I just want you to know that I'm going to change. I'm not gonna' keep being the monster that I was. I'm gonna' do good. I'm gonna' try my best to make people happy. And I'm sorry that I met you before I could realise this, and thank you, in some way for making me realise this."
? Did you really ask me that, Bob?"
He was too tired of being questioned. Of questioning.
"Dean," He gasped, "—please—" He couldn't tell what he was pleading for, or why, all he knew was that he needed. more of everything Dean had to give to him; was giving to him.
John grumbled to himself before grabbing the news paper, and flipping it open, "-you added too much salt last time. Don't do that again. I thought a boy your age woulda' had some common sense, but no."
want to do?"
Standing outside Principal Berry's door had to be the most agonizing, frightening and nervous five minutes of Castiel's life. Her front-desk receptionist, Tessa, had already asked them to settle down, since she'd informed the principal of their arrival. But she was in a meeting, and as the students had learnt from Tessa, Mrs. Berry wanted to run for mayor of Lawrence. It was surprising to learn that, but also, somehow to their advantage.
Dean paused. He stared at Castiel— at his beautiful, unblemished face. And he wondered, about how he'd carefully bruise and claim every inch of bare skin on the man's young body. And if Castiel were to resist, or simply pretend to resist, well, that would be the cherry on top.
the picture. Would you like that?"
Before the thought of Dean could sour Castiel's mood, there was an arm sliding around his shoulder and pulling him close, and Castiel jerked around to find Benny, obviously wasted, smiling at him. "Novak, you came."
Perhaps he would always need Dean.
"You're right, we need a protest. The authorities need to know we're serious. But, we should only protest
"No, sweetheart, of course not, why would you think that?"
"It's suffocating, y'know? Having to keep up with them? But I don't want to back out. I can't. Because if I did, they'd treat me worse than they treat the outcasts. They'd ostracise me. Ruin my school life. And I'm not brave enough to face that."
Lunch passed by with Benny being quiet, letting Dean wallow in his thoughts as well.
Dean and Castiel exchanged a glance, before smiling to each other. Benny and Andrea though, were doing not so good. Since Andrea wasn't aware of what Benny had witnessed, their emotional common ground had begun to reduce.
"Saw your post crossed twenty-five thousand hearts on OnlyPics. Lotta' people wanna' fuck you. You must be in heaven, yeah?" Dean smirked, watching as Castiel flipped a notebook open, and skimmed through it.
"You promised me—" Castiel started, and Dean groaned quietly, before dropping his head on the table and pushing the meat of his palms into his eyes.
" Castiel gasped into the kiss, eyes slipping shut as his chest heaved, and he chased Dean's lips, before nudging Dean away and letting his head rest against Dean's chin, "-we aren't in the corner yet, Dean."
Tears welled at the rim of Dean's eyes.
"Inside," Mrs. Berry stated with a tip of her head, and Castiel and his group rose to their feet. They followed after Mrs. Berry quietly, and shut the door on their way in. The five of them pressed close to each other, with Castiel at the forefront, trying to steady his breath. Mrs. Berry sat down at her chair behind her large, rosewood desk, and steepled her fingers. Her sharp gaze snapped over to pierce into Castiel eyes. "Make it quick. You have fifteen minutes."
"So, Dean, tell us about your family." Naomi asked, as one of the manservant's in Castiel's house began to serve Dean food.
Castiel let out a loud, gut-wrenching wail.
"S-sure."
Castiel froze.
"'Cause you want me to, slut," Dean groaned out loud into his pillow, as his hand pumped faster at his cock, bringing him closer to his orgasm.
"Alright. Do you want some coffee?"
Benny was one of the guys at school Dean had no problem with. He stayed in his lane, helped Dean out, and threw the best parties at his parent's farmhouse on weekends. Dean had been to a couple, and everytime he'd ended up smash-faced on a couch.
"Should I be scared of you, Dean?"
Dean grunted, and fucked his hips up against Castiel's lap, trying to find friction against the crack of Castiel's ass and his cock. Castiel, in turn, simply gave Dean the most lewd, inappropriate of looks, and brought Dean's hand up to his mouth. One glance at Dean, before he sucked Dean's middle finger into his mouth, bobbing his head on it like he were blowing someone.
It would crush him.
Castiel tried to protest, because hey, he clearly remembered copying the formula word to word into Dean's notebook, and he was sure the answer was right. He had stayed up late at night, way past his bedtime to write Dean's homework. How could Dean say otherwise? No, no, this had to be a mistake.
Dean tossed the keys back to Benny, who caught them in his hand, and walked over to where Dean was crouched before Castiel. Behind them, Alastair and his sidekicks lingered at the corner, speaking to each other, before slipping out of the room. Castiel's eyes followed them, but eventually ended up back on Dean.
"Right."
Please heed the tags and do not read this chapter if you are easily triggered by certain words or descriptions.
Meg was silent for a few seconds, before she broke into one of her cocky grins (which Castiel admitted, resembled Dean's, but he wasn't going to say that out loud), and rubbed her nose on the back of her palm.
Guilty silence met Castiel's words, and all Dean could do was watch, entranced, as his boyfriend thundered down on the people in the class.
have to suspend him," Castiel said. He felt like he was genuinely onto something; something that could work out if they put in some effort.
By Friday, Castiel had settled into school life the way he'd been before.
Dean did not say a word. Castiel steadied his breath, and wiped away a few stray tears on the back of his palm. Once he recognised his neighborhood, he turned to Dean, who was driving with his eyes fixed to the road, never deviating. Saying something would have pierced the silence between them, and Castiel didn't find it in himself to risk that, for he knew once he said something, he wouldn't be able to take it back. Dean's eyes flickered from the front to the side, and he pulled the car into the driveway of the Novak residence, before shifting gears and turning to Castiel.
Silence washed over the table.
"Of course, professor."
"Are you okay?"
you."
blackmailing me, Mr. Novak?"
he thought,
Happy Valentine's Day! Love you all so much for your unparalleled support! 🥰
"So there's one good thing, you won't be seeing Alastair for a while," Meg added, "—I wish I never had to see him again."
?" Meg suggested, and Castiel nodded.
The collision of skin with skin. The colour red. The scent of blood.
And with that, the pair went quiet again, simply letting the sound of music engulf them, until the sound of the front door opening and slamming shut brought both boys out of their reverie.
"I see you, Cas."
"Good," He quirked a lip, "-next time, don't fuck up. I made you keep your panties on this time, next time I won't."
"Dean," Castiel whispered, "-please don't do anything—"
"Not now, Dean," Castiel sighed, as he swung his legs over the edge of the single bed, and turned his face down. There were things, several things Castiel hadn't told Dean yet. Truth was, he didn't know how to. He knew it would hurt Dean, but he couldn't predict what Dean would do
"Benny told me this morning."
So you better get your show on the road soon. Now, do you have any plans in mind?"
and I blamed you for it. I was wrong. I was wrong, alright? I really was," Castiel sputtered out another sob, "—thank you for standing up for me, Dean. Not just now, but— but always, with Alastair, with the club, and now with mom. And thank you for, for being my rock. For being the one person who always has my back. I was angry, and I said some things I didn't mean, I over-reacted, just please don't think they're true, just don't ever, ever think I don't need you. I'm sorry, Dean," Castiel broke into a snivel, "—I'm sorry, I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry, Dean—"
Dean's rough hands— hands Castiel had always craved for on his body, crawled down Castiel's heated, smooth skin, down to the inside of his thigh. Dean's hand grazed across the tip of Castiel's cock, and Castiel bit down on his lip to refrain a whimper. Dean let his forehead rest against Castiel's, as Castiel sucked in shallow breaths. Teasing as always, Dean wrapped his hand around Castiel's cock, and began tugging at it in slow, lazy strokes. Castiel squeezed his arm around Dean's neck, and felt his eyes roll to the back of his head as Dean rubbed at the tip of his cock.
was that a good fuck.
Cas, I told you to stay away. Every time you threatened Cas, I couldn't do a single thing. Once, because he never meant anything to me, and once, when he meant something to me. I would have ripped you to shreds," Dean snarled, watching as Alastair tried to push him away, but failed, and tried to shove Dean's iron-tight grip off his neck, "-if Cas hadn't been there. But you know what? Cas ain't here today. And after what you did to him, I'm gonna' take your broken, beaten ass to him like a motherfuckin' trophy."
"Who knows, Mr. Singer. People aren't exactly vocal about things like this. The only reason we're here is because we're angry. So angry. Angry that Alastair thought he had the right to violate us and our bodies, and angry, that we won't ever be able to live life with the same carelessness and blissful ignorance that we did with before. because now, our eyes will always be vigilant, and we'll be scared— to open up, scared of new people, and insecure about our bodies. Angry enough to
"You're not in the mood? How about I get you? Will you like that, bitch?" A hand grabbed Castiel by the back of his neck, and he gasped. Behind his back, he tapped on the contact he hoped belonged to his driver— at least a missed call would work in favour of him.
Dean faltered, clearly shaken by Castiel's words, and he tried to defend himself, only for Castiel to hold a hand up.
"O-oh."
"That's true, Back In Black had the most sales, it's a universally acknowledged, best of all-time—"
All three incredulous eyes snapped over to Dean.
"So," Dean started, "—how do you wanna' get this started?"
, it was everywhere.
They would never agree upon certain things. Perhaps, Castiel would always love Led Zeppelin II and Dean would always love Physical Graffiti. Perhaps, Castiel would always love reading, and Dean would always love to tease him for that. Perhaps, Castiel would always scold him for not caring about his own self, and Dean would always look out for Castiel before himself. Perhaps, Castiel would always be a bit of a brat, and Dean would always try to tame him. Perhaps these things might never change, and yet, Dean was ready; had never been as ready before as he was then.
"Which one is the beer?"
"Now you're ready." Dean whispered, before pulling his fingers away and unbuckling his jeans. Castiel propped himself up on his elbows and watched Dean. Dean never stripped save for his jeans and boxers pooling at his thigh, but Castiel craved to see him naked one day, in all his rugged, sweaty glory. From the touch of it, Castiel knew Dean had muscles, and
Dean narrowed his eyes at Castiel, before flicking him in the head, and Castiel let out a soft, annoyed whine to which Dean laughed. As the song progressed, both Castiel and Dean bobbed their head in silence, and Castiel caught Dean muttering along the lyrics of the song to himself, eyes shut and face full of passion.
"What are you doing here?"
And then a scream tore through the receiver that had Dean flinching.
"No, not really. It's fading."
Alastair's lips curled into a wicked smile, and Dean felt Castiel's smaller hands reach out to hold onto his arm, backing away from Alastair. Alastair's eyes roamed across Castiel, in this disgusting, perverted way, as if he wanted to chew Castiel apart, and Dean felt nothing but anger and hatred curdle in his gut.
It had been a week already, since Dean had
(See the end of the chapter for
With his eyes locked on Alastair, Dean parted through the crowd, and slowly, with the gait of a panther preparing to pounce on its prey, he glided against the floor, and made his way over to where Alastair had pressed himself up against the girl, whose eyes darted around for someone to notice her discomfort. Dean wondered vaguely if the expression in her eyes had been in Cas's too when Alastair found him.
It was senior year, for fuck sake, they were supposed to be ruining their lives by having unprotected sex in their mom's basements and instead, Michael wanted to attend a book fair with Castiel. Not that there was anything wrong with it, but
"I'll get the list, and you can rest here for a bit."
what Castiel had done had him shuddering, and he let out an incredulous gasp as he watched Dean hang his head down.
Castiel returned to his seat at the desk, and wrote down the conclusion to the equation, before handing it back to Dean.
overprotective, but he didn't blame him. Perhaps if he'd been in Dean's place, he'd done the same.
(See the end of the chapter for
The twink hummed under his breath, a song Dean didn't know, and glided around the kitchen, blissfully unaware of Dean's eyes tracking his every move. Maybe he was
In bright, bold red was a circle around the formula they were supposed to use, and Castiel noticed how the letters and the numbers had jumbled up.
—" But Castiel never looked back as he reached the door of the farmhouse, and considered leaving, but instead, walked around the back of the wrap-around porch.
Dean swallowed down the complaint on his tongue, and let himself drown in the scent of Cas's cologne and laundry detergent. It
"No, I'll uh," His voice was shaky, "—I'll talk to Cas."
Absently, he reached a hand out, and slid it into Meg's to give her a light squeeze. She seemed to jerk out of her thoughts, and turned to face Castiel, wiping away a stray tear on the back of her palm.
"Mhm?"
"I know it isn't as serious as being— being raped but—"
Castiel turned away, glad Dean had gone silent, since it allowed him a moment to change the song on his playlist. Tangerine faded into Black Dog, and Castiel smiled. It was one of his favourites, and he could listen to it for hours at end. But the action seemed to have caught Dean's attention, who pressed into Castiel's side and tried to peek into his phone, "-whatcha' listenin' to? Your little fruity, gay music?" He laughed, "-Lady Gaga? Madonna?"
he'd been staring at the man.
"Cas." Dean started, wanting to defend himself, knowing there was nothing he could say that would change the intensity of what he did.
. So much for being a good boyfriend.
"—people? I'm speaking?" She quipped, and Benny sucked in a breath.
Dean raised his eyebrows at Castiel and folded his arms across his chest, as if to say
Dean flushed redder than Castiel expected him to, and Castiel snorted at his reaction, before nodding his head.
"I mean, if you're not up for it—"
"I'll wait, Cas. I'll wait for as long as you want."
Meg seemed uneasy, and she stole furtive glances from around them, before stepping in closer to Castiel. "Can we go somewhere private?"
Then, with a final glance at his father, who simply sent him a tight smile, Castiel creaked the door open, and stepped out into the cold night air. Outside, the world was dark, almost bleak, and Castiel trudged down the set of stairs. As he walked out into the empty, dark night— he felt strangely liberated.
show me."
"Fuck, that feels good," Castiel whined, and let out the smallest of breathy moans, knowing well there was a whole audience watching him. But boy if that didn't excite him. In his hazy, drunk, horny mind, Dean knew that some of the other men around them were rock hard, probably throbbing in their trousers at the show Castiel had put on.
With one hand holding onto the edge of the desk, Castiel kneeled down on the ground— knees parted, hips raised, and his plump, juicy ass in clear view to Dean. Behind him, he heard Dean rustle against the bedsheet, making Castiel smirk. Castiel wiggled his ass, knowing how the fabric of the panties had sunk between his ass cheeks, and how all it would take was a single jerk to put his hole on display. He talked aloud to himself, "-oh, oh no, Dean I don't think I can reach it, can you come help me?"
"Dude, you've already made me come once. You keep talkin' like that, and we're going to have to go round two."
It was downright filthy, and Dean wanted to get drunk on it.
"Stop what?"
Mrs. Berry sucked in a breath, and pinched her nose. "As much as I applaud your bravery, it isn't easy for me to simply suspend a child. I need evidence, written and factual. I need statements, official documents, there is a lot that I need to do to suspend Alastair Knight. And not to let this get personal, but as you all know, I am running for Mayor this year. And Alastair Knight's father, Azazel, is the highest donor for our school, as well as my opposition for running as Mayor. I'm a woman, it's taken me years of hardwork, years of effort, and working my life off to reach where I have. I need you to know that I can't let this opportunity slip from my hands."
Dean let out a breath he never realised he was holding.
"Thank you for beating the fuck out of Alastair."
"What's funny, fag?"
"Dean?" He gasped, stumbling backwards. Dean cocked an eyebrow at his clothes, and his apple-green eyes lingered over Castiel's chest, before wandering back upwards. Something about Dean was strange though, he seemed angry, he seemed irritated, and the moment Dean barged into his house and shut the door behind, Castiel realised he was right. Dean was furious.
, more,
Castiel kept his eyes turned down, but nodded.
"Hm?"
"Wet for me already, sweetheart?"
"Hello Anna, I'm so glad you're here."
On his feet, he could only get so far, and the moment he realised his breath had forsaken him, he paused in his tracks, did a quick survey of his surroundings, and noticed a small, remote cottage-esque house situated in the midst of a deep, dense jungle. The sirens grew closer, and Dean realised,
They were at the library, school had ended about a hour ago. The five of them had decided to go down to the library, to discuss more about their campaign and the club. So far, a plan was all they had. But Castiel was hell-bent on putting the plan to work. At that moment, Castiel was busy checking the submissions on their anti-bullying page, and a record had been crossed.
And how would Dean argue against that?
Just an
"Cas," Dean rasped, "-can I go lower?"
"So, for the anti-bullying thing— how are you going to get people to sign up?"
"More what? And did I say you could call me Dean? Where's your manners?" Dean growled, and plunged the plug inside Castiel's hole. Instead of thrusting it, he twisted it around with loud, wet squelches, and Castiel's jaw dropped open as he let out another moan, and curled his toes, bucking his hips back against Dean's face.
Bile rose at the back of Dean's throat as he croaked out at last, "-I think Alastair's going to rape—"
"Let's get this show on the road."
"Mhm," Meg nodded, as she dipped a spoon into the tub of ice-cream in Castiel's hands, and licked it clean, "—our aim right now is to get Alastair and his gang suspended with a blacklisted record for their college admissions—"
Alex pulled her hand away, folded her arms across her chest and studied Castiel with a hum. "Are you comfortable sharing with me why they triggered you? Or would you rather talk to someone else? Perhaps, I could call a teacher for you to escort you back to class. Or if you wish to take the day off, that's completely plausible, I can write you a leave note, because you definitely need rest."
"Oh," Castiel mumbled, and his eyes narrowed at Dean, before he turned away and back to face the blackboard.
similar to the look in Castiel's eyes when Dean had found them up in the room at Benny's house.
"Let's get to character studies of Hamlet, starting with Hamlet himself. Can I get some answers?"
"I'm sorry, but some of the most capable men in this company have constructed these papers, and they have put an immense amount of effort into—"
"I swear." Castiel persisted, and gave Dean's hand a small squeeze. "—you won't know what hit you.
Their lips met in the middle, intense and desperate, as Castiel scrambled to pull Dean in closer and closer, scratching at his canvas jacket and rocking their bodies together. The air around them was thick with arousal and impatience. Castiel had already begun to feel the first few traces of his arousal reaching down between his legs, and the bulge in Dean's pants kept brushing against Castiel's taint through the fabric of Castiel's thin trousers.
Meg's hazel-brown eyes softened, and she turned her gaze away, lips pursing for a moment. Castiel could tell she was hesitant, and he glanced down at Dean, sending him a look, as if to say
"I didn't either. But I love you. And I wanted you to know that. It couldn't wait."
The four of them snapped their eyes up to stare at Castiel, and Dean found Castiel staring straight at him with a cold, inscrutable expression in his eyes.
Through the grinding, the rubbing, and all the dry humping, Dean had to physically restrain himself from pulling Castiel's underwear down. Even then, he managed to slip his palms inside Castiel's tight shorts, and cupped them over the globes of Cas's warm, round ass, and spread it open, only for Castiel to wince, and Dean froze with a jerk.
Showering together, Castiel wondered, was supposed to be sweet, very intimate, very sexy— Maybe if Dean stopped trying to style his hair up like Jimmy Neutron on the pretence of 'rubbing shampoo into his hair'. Of course, it took them much more time to step out of the shower, what with them making out against the bathroom wall like horny teenagers, which in this case, they actually were, and having to do another round of body wash to clean their sweat. By the end of it though, Castiel didn't want to leave, in fact, he could have easily spent another hour showering with Dean, with his rough, calloused hands roaming across his tiny, lithe body, if only their stomachs hadn't rumbled with hunger.
"Sammy, your breakf—"
Of late, Michael had become absolutely redundant to Castiel. Sure, they'd started dating because they were the only two openly gay boys in the entirety of Lawrence High, and at the beginning, it was cute. Sweet, even, since Michael was a nerdy, dorky guy with long hair, and a weird fashion taste, and hey, the two of them liked talking about classic Literature. But after a point, Castiel had gotten bored. Literally. It seemed as if they'd speak of nothing but small talk, and sex? Out of question. Every time Castiel had tried to do something remotely inappropriate, Michael had shunned him away. God, the guy wouldn't even understand when Castiel was coming onto him.
"I hope you aren't too bored, Mr. Novak. We can arrange for a few drinks if you wish."
"I heard it. Well, parts of it. You were speaking too softly, but I could hear your voice. You stood up for him, I'm proud of you, son." Bobby sighed, and his eyes, wise and deep, peered into Dean's.
"How bad?" He asked at last, trying to respect Dean's decision to not tell him.
"Cas," Meg started after a few seconds, "-you've always been alone. Didn't you ever feel the need to fit in?"
"That's—" Dean's eyes brightened, and he broke into a small smile, "—sure Cas, Sammy's a genius. He'll figure something out soon."
It was a genuine question, and Castiel was glad it pulled a laugh out of Benny.
"Hey Cas," He whispered, and Castiel pressed a soft kiss to his cheek before pulling away. "Hello Dean, Benny. Thanks for coming along."
"What?" Dean turned around to ask him, and sent him a dry glare.
"These are gonna' be the best pancakes you've ever had, Novak, I'll bet on it."
, he's the type that grows on you, the type that makes you love him, even though you never expected to, so don't you dare let him slip through your fingers, 'kay?"
"I wanted to die, Castiel. I really did. It's why I came over to check on you, to make sure you're okay," Her hazel brown eyes glazed over Castiel's face as she squeezed his hand back with a gentle smile, one Castiel had never seen on her face before, "-I know we don't talk much. But ever since I saw Benny take you away that night at the party, I couldn't stop thinking about you. Especially, since I know how it feels. Begging someone to stop, to just, want to vanish. You're lucky, Castiel, you have Dean, your boyfriend, who can look out for you, but I—" Meg laughed, a chilling, skeptical laugh, "-I didn't have anyone to reach out to, you're the first person to know this."
And Naomi had hummed in amusement. '
"Castiel?"
Castiel stood silent for a moment. "Because fighting with them would make you one of them. And you're better. I
"Fuck," Castiel groaned, and their eyes met for a moment, both hazy with lust and high from their orgasms.
Castiel hummed, "—he saw it. The blood."
"Oh yeah," Meg chimed in, "—we really need those. Fifty is a lot. But, Cas," She started, her tone questioning now, as she pulled a chair out and seated herself down on it, turning to Castiel, "—we need to talk to someone above Mr. Singer. Who is that going to be? And when are we going to speak to them?"
ones), and Dean's oversized varsity jacket which hung ill-fitting on his shoulders. He laid back on what Dean imagined to be a bed, and he squeezed his legs shut, as if trying to resist.
Dean had never moved faster. His feet had grown a mind of their own as they scampered through the foyer, once again haphazardly kicking and knocking people aside. It earned him a plethora of glares and scowls, but Dean couldn't be less bothered as he ran from room to room. The kitchen was empty, the guest room beside the kitchen was empty, the bathrooms were vacant, and each corridor, although dark, was completely empty.
"Alright then, let's get this show on the road, bitch."
"And then when I'm done, I'll let you have him. Sloppy seconds. Will that make you happy, Winchester? You know I care for you, don't you?" A sick, wicked laugh rumbled past Alistair's lips, and he raised an eyebrow at Dean.
It was cute. Not very. Just, a tiny bit.

could ever find him. It was his own, comfortable bubble of solitude, and nothing would take it away from him.
"Okay, look, I love this whole, erm,
"Obsessed with Castiel?"
"But I'm your slut." Castiel grinned, already in his post-orgasmic ecstasy.
"I," Castiel choked out, his voice naive, with such innocence to it, Dean felt tears sting his own eyes, "-I don't know what to say."
Castiel threw his hand up.
Naomi had asked, a strange but lingering smile on her face, and Castiel had faltered. They had been lounging on the couch in the living room, and Castiel's father was busy reading the morning newspaper next to Naomi. At that, however, he had glanced up to be part of the conversation.
"Hello Dean." Castiel's voice was full of life and colour.
"God, you're disgusting," Dean groaned, and let his hand fall away. He folded his collar up, and unbuttoned the top of his shirt to let some air in, and Castiel stood pressed against the wall, shame and guilt drenching him. Tears threatened to spill past his eyes as he wrapped an arm across his chest and held onto his elbow, rubbing a circle into his own skin in an attempt to soothe himself.
Alastair, but we don't want to be the monster that he is. So please, Mr. Singer. Help us. This school has seen too much of that bastard."
Hooking his fingers through his sweatpants, Castiel bent over and slowly, slid the pants down his slender, hairless legs, courtesy of his genes, and let Dean watch him. In the distance, Castiel could hear Dean suck in a shallow breath, and let it out weakly. Castiel stretched the elastic band of his panties, before letting it slap against his navel, and slipping down onto the chair with both feet spread apart. If Dean wanted to watch, he could gladly, and for the sole purpose of annoying Dean, Castiel rolled his hips back in the chair, and let his ass bounce as he pretended to adjust himself in his seat.
"I— I— fuck me, please— anything," Castiel gasped out, and Dean watched as he rolled his hips against the chair for friction. Every ounce of self-control seemed to fade away as Dean stepped around the chair to face the boy, and reached back to untie him. Their faces were an inch away, and Dean could clearly see the pink blush tinting the boy's face, the need in his thick, black pupils, as he licked his plump lips, and Dean muttered a resigning
"You hurt me, Gordon, and I did nothing to you. I never said a bad word, never talked back, never raised my voice. I did what you asked me, did what you said, and I never bothered you. Why did you do that to me—" Castiel felt his chest tighten, and his throat began to hurt with the discomfort of crying so sorely. The hands stabling his shoulder were back, and he could do nothing as he felt himself drop to the ground, unable to keep himself steady. The hands dropped with him, and he felt Gordon rubbing a hand down his back. The touch made him want to give into the warmth, and yet, at the same time, knowing it was Gordon, it made him want to hurl his gut out.
It only fuelled his rage.
he mumbled, and let his imagination run wild with the thoughts of wavy, long hair, big round tits, a small, curvy waist with sharp hipbones, a firm, bouncy ripe ass, clad with lacy blue panties, slender hairless legs and a small, pink cock that nudged against—
Dean sighed. "-yeah."
Castiel stood at the front of the class.
Castiel wanted to punch himself in the face, in the gut, right in the fucking' nose, for saying that. Did he really say that? He really said that.
"Good morning, Dean," Castiel smiled, and Dean stepped back with a frown on his face. Great. First dad started the day with his usual taunts, and now
"It was easy for you to mould me when I was a child— to manipulate me the way you wanted to, but I'm growing up. I have my opinions, I have my own choices, my own decisions, and I take responsibility for them. And I made a choice to choose Dean as my partner." Castiel sighed, feeling his restlessness grow with every second that passed by, but his mother remained silent. "I don't care if he isn't good enough for you to boast about to your friends, but he's the first person who has ever treated me like I actually matter, he's my best friend, he's my— he means everything to me, and I can't lose him. I could risk losing you, but not him."
"Y-yes."
It wasn't until a few more thrusts of his spent cock inside Castiel's creampied hole, that Castiel let out a loud gasp. He tightened his hands around Dean, and Dean watched as his cocklet squirted out a thin, white splatter of come across his oversized t-shirt.
"I want you to look at yourself when I fuck you." Dean snarled, and shoved Castiel's pants down to reveal his tight, bouncy round ass. God, he'd fantasized about it for so long. And now, Dean finally had the chance to take it. Anyway he liked.
"Sorry, got lost in my memories."
"Well, Dean invited me over. And we've been to my place quite a lot already. Besides, I like your house. It's very homey, and cozy. And mine is, well, mine is just an overrated, exaggerated slab of concrete."
"Oh, okay. Thank you sir."

No more fighting. They had to be mature, they had to be brave, they had to be strong. Castiel had been too naive, he had let his guard down, he had unintentionally, tried to stitch his family together at the expense of his boyfriend, and that was his fault.
Dean's eyes softened, and his lips spread into a wide smile as he strummed his fingers against the strings of the guitar. "You remember that?"
Dean was beginning to slur his words. “Ring around Rosie, a pocket full of posies. Ashes… ashes… we all fall down.”
“Spinach Artichoke?” Emma, Sam, Kaia, Claire and Dean raised their hands.
“Do Angels get married?”
“And your brother has not displayed any symptoms?” The physician in him could not help checking up.
Outside, everyone was taking their seats. Amara stood at the front. She could see the crowd of people who loved Dean and Castiel. The Wedding was taking place at the Barn. As in
Gabriel never knew Michael to be afraid of anything, but for a split second, he thought he saw fear in his brother’s eyes.
“I'm the one who gripped you tight and raised you from perdition.”
Jack swung himself side to side violently trying to shake Claire off of his back, both of them laughing the entire time.
“That I am gay and was going to the Farmer’s Market to ask his best friend out on a date,” Castiel let out quickly and grimaced.
Castiel smiled. “Good, because you’re going to love your last present.”
“Shh. It’s going to be alright.Deep breaths.”
After Lisa’s diagnosis, he helped deal with the last two booked events scheduled at The Old Stone Barn before her death, and final three afterwards. It was when he was still on “autopilot “ and was able to get things done without too much thought. He had the help of Ellen, Jo and Ash, who were used to dealing with small events and crowds at their bar, as well as Pamela. He had Sam, his grandmother Deanna, Garth and Bess Fitzgerald and a multitude of others helping with the twins and Lisa. He knew he had so much help from so many people that he’d never be able to thank them all, and most likely would never know all those to whom he would always feel indebted.  However, Dr. NoWay was different.
Well, you might never have his money
He threw his head back and laughed heartily.
“Great!” She gave him a quick peck on the cheek and ran the rest of the way to the car. “C’mon, let's hurry. I want to get there before this light changes more.”
“Thank you.”
“Oh, we’ve already told Cassie that you’re not making him go back and that we’re having a small party for his welcome home tomorrow, so you need to buy a cake, get a bouncy house or something, have some of his favorite foods, and a few wrapped presents. I’m not kidding.” Michael demanded.
After Claire and Jack had their showers, came down to get water and say their goodnights, Castiel was still mulling things over in his head. He poured himself one more glass of wine and made his way up to his bedroom. He decided to take Balthazar’s advice and take a hot bath. He put on some music, lit a few candles, drizzled some his favorite fragrant oils in the bath and lay back in the hot silky water with his glass of wine.
"So, uhm, are people going to know, or do we have to hide it?"
Castiel moaned, and his thighs nudged against the edge of the desk before Dean was lifting him up onto the wood. Castiel gasped, and Dean swiftly rid him of his trousers, leaving Castiel buck-naked, before pushing him down on the desk. Their hazy, lusty eyes stayed held, and Dean pressed a hand into Castiel's chest, before dragging it down to Castiel's beautiful, pink, cock.
Benny.
"They— their fingers. They kept pushing them inside—"
"Don't care." Before Castiel could even realise what was happening, Dean was hauling him up in his arms, hooking Castiel's legs around his waist, and Castiel yelped at the suddenness of it, before giving into Dean's touch and slinging his arms around Dean's neck.
The table went silent. All eyes snapped over to Castiel.
But there was one thing still left to do. He had yet to decided on a time to speak to Mr. Singer. Meg had decided on Monday, since it gave them ample time to gather their thoughts over the weekend. There was one thing absolutely undisputed— Alastair, Gordon and Nick would have to be suspended.
They were done before they even started.
"I promise."
(See the end of the chapter for
Castiel seemed nervous, but not dejected.
"Cas, you just spent twenty-minutes alone in a room with two men you despise. I'd call that more than strong, sweetheart. But it's alright. You don't have to do it anymore. You're fine, I got you, okay? You're my brave boy, right Cas?"
No, I mean, I was mad, but I'm not mad anymore, okay? And fuck, I shouldn't have said that, I— I didn't mean it. I would never do that, Cas, you know I want you in my life for as long as I can have you, you know I want you to be my future, come on, why would you think I'd leave you— and hey, I— I'm just worried about you, and it's not— fuck, I just— I don't know what to say, Cas. But you know I love you, right? And sure, I'm a bit hurt, but I'm not leaving, alright?"
Something in the air had changed— gone sour. Bobby shifted from one leg to the other, swallowing thickly as he stared down at Dean. The silence between them had begun to itch Dean, and he sucked in a soft breath to ease himself, because each moment was a dive into his memories— memories where he could feel the way Castiel's shoulders jerked against his shoulders when he cried, or the way his fingers curled around Dean, even the way Castiel smiled against Dean's chest, and Dean could feel the touch of his lips broadening against his own skin. It had been two days since Dean had seen Castiel, and though they called each other during recess and some times in the evening, texted quite frequently, nothing could beat being next to Castiel. He was addictive— everything about him.
Thank you for your immense support so far, and I promise I will be back with a better chapter in a little while!
"I— alright."
He wasn't blind. He had noticed the stream of blood pouring down Castiel's thighs when he had helped Castiel into the shower the night before. Of course, he had saved both of them a great deal of discomfort by not bringing it up, but the way his eyes had softened, Castiel just knew he wanted to say something. But he didn't, and part of Castiel was thankful for it.
"Hey, how ya' doin', Sammy?"
, but Dean couldn't care, because he needed to come, needed to fuck something, needed to let go of all that tension in his body.
The class around him broke into a muted chuckle, and Castiel flushed a deep red from the tip of his nose to the tip of his ears, and hung his head down. "M'sorry," he mumbled, and watched as Dean strolled away towards the other end of the row. Now offended, slightly upset as well, Castiel glared at Dean, whose eyes were roaming across the body of students seated behind Castiel. When he knew Dean's eyes had returned to him, Castiel held his gaze, and slouched slightly down onto the bench to spread his legs open. If Dean had a good sight, which Castiel knew he did, he would unmistakably be able to pin-point the dried stream of come on Castiel's thigh.
The air changed, now charged with electricity as Castiel, his gaze steely and determined, trudged over to where Dean was seated at the front of the table. Part of Dean knew he should have stopped Castiel from doing something they would regret, but it was too late. In a second, Castiel was leaning into Dean's space, grinning down at him so wide and free. "Hope you don't mind, boss." He whispered against Dean's ear, and Dean's cock gave an interested twitch.
"Hey," He croaked out, trying his hardest to not let Castiel know he was on the verge of crying. Dean flicked his cigarette away and crushed it under his foot. He wiped a hand over his face, and pressed his phone to his ear.
for Dean— a light, apple-green coloured lace. Dean pressed his lips to Castiel's hipbones. He caught the fabric between his teeth, dragging it down until it pooled at Castiel's thighs, and Castiel let out a choked whimper at the feeling of having his cock and hole exposed to the cool wind; to Dean, whose blackened pupils gazed up at Castiel with such intensity, Castiel's cock twitched. A smile pulled at the corner of Dean's lips as he watched Castiel press his hand into his mouth to muffle his moans.
Panic grappled every movement, every foot Dean took forward, as he reached out a hand, but paused before he could twist the door knob. He pressed his head against the door, praying he wouldn't hear what he expected to— praying somewhere in the back of his mind, that he wouldn't have to listen to the sound of—
Castiel stared at the text for a good, solid minute, before letting out a sigh. "The students need change."
"Yes, please, only for you—"
"Maybe in your car. After that pie date. Sound good?" Castiel asked with a smile, and never before had he seen Dean Winchester so excited before.
It ate away at Dean, not knowing what Castiel was feeling; thinking.
The end faded out, and Castiel was all but rooted to his seat as he watched Dean put the guitar away, and dust his hands. "That was so—" Castiel struggled to find words that could even match how beautiful it was to have heard that, how absolutely awe-inspiring, and fantastic, and— and Castiel couldn't say a word.
The summer before school, while surfing around on the internet, Castiel had stumbled on to a picture of a girl, dressed in a skimpy corset, black stockings and bunny ears. He hadn't thought much of it, but the website he had been led to after clicking on the picture had been OnlyPics. OnlyPics was a strange place. People seemed to flood it with comments and posts, and without revealing any information about yourself except for a username, you could post pictures of yourself. Premium users could even earn money from the pictures the posted. And when Castiel had ended up falling down a rabbit-hole of OnlyPics, he'd found
, didn't you? Wanted to see him begging to stop you? Yeah? How's it feel? Am I being too soft for you, Al?" Every word had a growl lingering to it, and Dean's lips twitched as he crushed his foot harder, "-hope you're proud of me now, I'm being tougher, yeah?"
Castiel couldn't find it in himself to think of it.
"But the anonymous ones won't be counted as proof, Cas."
Castiel smirked "Perhaps we should move to somewhere quiet…" He mused, and yet, didn't make an effort to stand or move in the slightest. But his eyes were challenging, and Dean knew exactly what he wanted to do. So, Dean rose from his chair, and with him some of his men rose too. But he waved a hand at them to dismiss them, and walked around the table— every step bringing him closer to Castiel. It wasn't until he was right at Castiel's side, that he leaned down over Castiel's shoulders, and ghosted his lips against the man's ear.
"Come in, my parents are in the parlor." Castiel took Dean by the hand, and led him in to the house. Dean had been to the Novak family mansion several times, but his visit had mostly been confined to Castiel's bedroom. He hadn't even known the house had a parlor, but he was curious now. Castiel led him through a series of corridors, turning here, turning there, before at last, they stood before a large entrance way, only obstructed by a thin, lavender-tinted tulle curtain.
With that, Castiel let go of Dean's hand, and walked over to where Nick and Gordon stood. He expected to feel a sense of dread, but he couldn't. All he could feel was peace, of assurance, the love radiating off of Dean even from feet away. The tremble in Dean's voice when he spoke to Castiel, the way he would do anything for Castiel. Now that Castiel had Dean, he had nothing to fear.
Silence settled between the three of them as Castiel considered it for a moment.
Without another coherent thought, only an abstract of Castiel's face in his mind, Dean reached for the stairs, but a tight grip on his wrist stopped him, and he turned back to face Benny. His eyes were wide and glowering, lips frowning and sweat beading down his face as he panted, chest heaving with each breath he sucked in. A growl lingered at the back of his throat as he tried to squirm his hand out of Benny's grip.
"Bad?" Dean prompted, rubbing a hand across the back of his neck.
Next Update: 13 March, 2021.
"Alright, but get home safe. Text me if you need anything."
Dean's eyes snapped over to Castiel, and Castiel held his gaze, never letting their eyes stray as Dean paused for a moment, and nodded. As if on its own accord, Castiel's hand drifted up to Dean's face, and he brushed his finger across the bandaid under Dean's eye. Their eyes met, a strange beat passing between them where neither said a word, and yet, Castiel could feel inside him, everything Dean wanted to say, and Dean, perhaps, felt his burden lighten at the very slightest for having shared it.
Silence crept up between them, before Dean turned around, grabbed their bags and walked towards the exit, as Castiel followed after him, still smiling giddily for some strange reason. It wasn't until he crashed into Dean's back all at once, that Castiel realised not only had Dean been carrying his bag around, but also that they were the only ones in the school parking lot, and that at that moment, they were standing right before Dean's big, black car.
's, the four of them scuttered out the room, and into the passage. Dean slung an arm around Castiel's shoulder, and pulled him into his side. "Nice work, yeah?" Dean asked with a grin, and Castiel turned to smile at him.
Unbidden, a laugh slipped past Castiel's lips, and Dean, sent him a look.
Dean laughed, and Castiel's throat dried up at the sight of him enjoying Lisa's attention.
The men's restroom on the abandoned third floor of Lawrence High is not a place one usually frequented. Of course, the same could not be said for Castiel Novak, a senior on his lunch break, who at the moment, snuck furtive glances from around him before slipping inside the door with a board on the front, saying in bright, bold words—
For the past seventeen years, not once had Castiel sat in his mother's lap and felt indescribable joy, or played with his father and enjoyed some normalcy. All he had was large, blank white bedrooms, since neither of his parents knew him well enough to get it customised to his tastes, and books. Once he'd found a way to distract himself from books, it was his OnlyPics account.
?" Castiel asked, batting his eyelashes in a coy, cheeky manner that had the guy next to him blushing too. Dean locked his jaw, and
"I won't say what you did was right— beating them up, breaking their bones, going crazy— but I won't say you were wrong either. Some times, not everyone can be brought to justice with peace. Sometimes you need a little kick, a little punch to remind them that you've still got a fight in you. I'm proud of ya'."
"You're very observant."
Castiel wasn't really angry at him, like he knew just what he was doing, and being all smug about it, and Castiel didn't know if he hated Dean, or perhaps, even
The sticky, warm feeling of Alastair's nose breaking under Dean's fist filled Dean with an odd, sadistic sort of a pleasure, and he laughed, going at it over and over again.
"I'm beginning to."
"He did. And so did his friends."
"You ain't that good at hiding, fatass," Dean said, and Castiel froze for a second, before allowing a smile to creep on his face as he stepped out from the corner and walked over to Dean.
"That's what it took for you to realise you were a bad person?" Castiel asked, his voice broken, "—at my cost? At the cost of my, my everything? Why me, Gordon? Please, I need you to tell me. Why me?" Castiel's shoulders wracked with sobs as he hunched over, stifling a cry in his hands. He felt someone try to hold him by the shoulder, but he jerked the touch away. "Don't touch me, don't fucking touch me."
"I love you—" Castiel croaked out, reaching up to hold onto Dean's neck as Dean pressed his cock against Castiel's hole, rubbing it once before pushing it in. The bottoming out of Dean's cock inside him felt like coming home, and Castiel slapped a hand over his mouth to mute the moan let out.
Castiel smiled, and pressed his face into Dean's neck to breath in the scent of soap. They met again, languid this time, as their lips found each other, and their hands flew and legs twined, bodies rocking against the bed as they tasted every inch of each other's mouths, pulling away to catch their breaths. Their eyes met, and Dean's were bright as always.
"Didn't you date Anna Milton in junior year?" Castiel asked, a bit of a bite to his voice.
"You think I'm an asshole, right."
But he couldn't move an inch.
"It will have to." Castiel sighed. Silence washed over them for a few moments, until Meg spoke up.
to be fine, so stop acting like what happened on Friday has completely broken me, or shattered me in any way. Yes, it hurt. And it still does, but I don't want to sit around and mope about it. There's things that I don't feel comfortable enough telling you now, but when the time is right, I will. So stop forcing it out of me. I know you love me, and you have every reason to be worried about me, but please, you making me feel like I'm weak, and that I need to be tended to every hour isn't helping."
Castiel seemed to calm down at the sound of that, as he sniffled, and rubbed his hands over his face. "You're not allowed to leave me."
"Dean said you were more of a father to him than his own has ever been." Meg said at last, and Castiel turned to her, thankful that the colour had returned to her face.
"Dean?"
"How'd you know?"
But then, a voice rose up.
Mr. Singer went pale, and he let out a precarious breath, before slouching his shoulders and turning his eyes away. "I asked Pam to let me know if the boys were back, I would have warned you. But she must have forgotten. God," Mr. Singer sighed, "—that must have been painful, no, seeing those bastards again?"
Her eyes softened, "-yeah. And also the first guy who ever looked at me as someone more than a friend. It was why I devoted myself to him. I thought he'd be the possessive type, and  that he'd tear apart anyone who hurt me, or anyone who touched me. Dating Alastair was tough. I don't even know how I got myself to do it for a year. But then things changed towards the end. He got distant, never texted back, he flirted with other girls, kept bullying my
"You don't have to keep it in, Cas."
Disgust rose in the back of Castiel's mind as he compelled himself to stare at Dean, nervously licking his dry lips to speak, when at once, Dean's eyes drop down to his lips to follow the movement of his tongue before flickering back up to his eyes. Castiel tried to twist his arm out of Dean's grip, but it seemed impossible with how tight Dean was holding onto him. When he spoke again, his voice was hoarse from having gone silent for so long, "-how long?"
"Alastair was mean, crude, vile and everything I despised, but he was how I survived junior year. Until prom, of course."
Mr. Frank's voice brought Castiel back to the present, and he blinked a few stray tears away, before glancing at Mr. Frank, and then absently, at Dean. Dean met his eye for a moment, before averting his gaze, and Castiel swore he saw a glimpse of regret in Dean's eyes. As he slipped into his seat, Castiel almost laughed at his own naivety.
"Because," Castiel finally put his phone aside and sat up straight, his eyes gazing right into Dean's, "-I just do."
Wide, awestruck blue eyes stared up at Dean, and he watched as the black of Castiel's pupils seeped into the blue, and
"Oh, Dean," Castiel cried out, before biting down on his lip, hard enough to draw blood, and pushed Dean deeper between his thighs. If only Castiel could see himself in that moment, he would realise how big of a wreck he looked— mouth hung open in ecstacy, moans spilling past his lips, eyebrows furrowed, eyes shut and sweat dripping down his brow, "—Dean,
Meg leaned forward, and glazed her eyes down Mr. Singer's binder, before shaking her head. "We're going for the majority-wins card. The more allegations, the more pressure on authority, the more chances of Alastair being suspended. Think that'll work?"
"Not the last either," Dean muttered, and in his heart, realised,
Castiel shook his head.
"O-okay."
But this little firecracker, Dean mused, he looked like the type to play along. He looked like a
Dean rolled his eyes to himself, and slung his bag around his shoulder. The moment he turned, however, he was met with Bobby, standing at the threshold of the classroom in all his formal glory. He had his hands behind his back, and for all the years Dean knew him (which was technically his whole life), he knew it meant Bobby needed to talk.
Dean grit out a smile, and crumpled a piece of paper in his hands under the conference table. His eyes tracked every movement of Castiel's baby-blues with the vigilance of a predator watching its prey. The moment he had Novak alone, he was going to eat the bastard up alive.
"500$. And I'll clear your raise." Mick snapped a five-hundred dollar bill down on the table between them.
"I uhm, I've been wondering whether or not I should speak about something."
"Winchester? Thought you left with your faggot boyfriend. He's a great cocksucker by the way. Let me use him like a good little whore. Pretty lips, pretty hole. It's a shame I couldn't go past sticking a finge—"
"Try me," Castiel said after a while, and leaned back against the cushion of the seat they were at. A small laughter erupted from the table, only making Castiel frown harder. "I'm serious, I'm not a bore. You people just don't know me well enough."
Castiel froze, before turning his head around ever-so-slightly.
"You deserved to let it out, Meg. Thank you for sharing this with me."
Castiel blushed.
got here. I realised how everything had changed."
"Yeah, sweetheart?"
He was vicious in the way he kissed, but gentle in the way he held Castiel by the jaw. He was rough in the way he nibbled a mark into Castiel's neck, but sweet when he licked at the bite to soothe the pain. His eyes were rigid in the way they stared down at Castiel, full of conviction, but a trace of affection lingered through them, and Castiel couldn't help but be drawn in deeper into the enigma that was Dean Winchester. Even then, in that moment, when Dean was pouring lube down Castiel's taint, massaging every inch of his hole, making sure it was easy enough to slide into, his fingers were deft and soothing.
Dean grinned. "We don't have that on the menu."
Naomi and Michael had shared a look with each other, before turning back to Castiel
"Really?" Dean asked with a grin, "—dude, that's kinda' awesome. You'd be an amazing teacher, in fact, you already are. You really should think about it. What colleges are you applying to? Any idea?"
"—a potion, on your right—" Castiel mumbled, and Dean smiled wickedly. The boy would never see it coming. How blissfully unaware he was of Dean pushing his pants down and stepping out of them. So engrossed in his game, he didn't even realise Dean was beating his cock right above him, "—oh, get the sorcerer—"
"Look Cas," Dean started, as he sat himself down next to Castiel with an equally full plate of pancakes, "—the things I did, I'm not proud of any of it, okay? If I could change my past, I really would, but I can't." A beat passed between them, "-I'm scared of not being able to belong, Cas. I need someone who accepts me. Before you, it was Alastair. At home, it's Sammy. And at school, I had to pretend to be someone I wasn't to be able to belong. I've told you already, I got in on a scholarship, I wasn't born into a rich family, neither are my parents hardcore corporate workers with a shit ton of money to spend on my schooling. But I wanted to do something worthwhile, you know? And I wanted to be relevant to the people around me."
His eyes glazed over passively over the woods and the hills beyond the school building, each moment bringing back memories of the time they'd spent together, away from the eyes of the world. For the first time in years, Dean had let himself open up to someone, to let someone know who he was— and it turned out to be Castiel Novak, a boy he never even expected to love with all his heart.
"Awh, look at him. He's stuttering. Do I scare you, fag?"
Enter Dean Winchester. Captain of the school football team. Big, broad guy built with solid muscle and nothing else. Jock through and through. Every girl at school
With a quirk of his bottom lip, Castiel uploaded the video to OnlyPics, with the cheeky, single-worded caption of
And then, something snapped.
"What if it was?"
"But, I'm leaving, for real, Cas— I won't bother you again."
, to say the least, as she nodded, and broke into a smile.
Castiel gazed up at Dean, silent for a moment, and tears pooled at his eyes.
"So, you're, erm, you're my boyfriend now?" Castiel asked, rubbing a hand across the back of his neck. Dean laughed unexpectedly, and sat back on his knees.
Thick, long fingers dipped between Castiel's taint to brush against the small, exquisite pink glass plug nestled inside his hole. He gasped when he felt it slide out, causing his hole to gape at the width of it, before tightening again. He was slick, sticky inside his hole from all the lube he'd poured in before. It was for Dean, all for Dean, anything for Dean, and Dean's sigh of relief was worth carrying around the wetness of the lube inside him all afternoon.
"It is," Castiel smiled, and let his head rest back against the wall as he shuffled his playlist, and Dean sat pressed to Castiel's side, shoulder to shoulder, and they listened to the song bloom into the chorus, with Dean drumming his fingers against his thigh, and Castiel tapping his foot.
"Mr. Singer. Dean once told me, he's like an uncle to Dean. And he's a good person, he can help us."
"Three students from your class have been hospitalised— Alastair Knight, Gordon Walker, and Nick Morningstar. Alastair has broken ribs and a dislocated jaw, Nick has broken fingers, and Gordon has a dislocated nose. It's not too serious, but it's serious enough to get the perpetrator punished legally," Bobby walked over to the desk, and ground his palms into the wood, before staring straight at Dean, his hazel brown eyes glassy with concern and something inscrutable, "-be honest with me, Dean. Was it you?"
Walking away from Castiel, each step felt heavy. Dean wondered, prayed,
"Me too, baby."
fat," Dean teased, and Castiel launched forward to flick him in the head. Dean recoiled, and tried to dodge him.
"What would you have done if you did?"
Dean smiled, and Castiel could feel the tension between them dissipate.
"I'm sorry, I couldn't stand seeing those bruises on your face, Cas."
"What can I say? I'm famous," Castiel smiled, and part of Dean wanted to punch the smile right off his delicate fucking face, but he kept his urges in control, instead, sitting up on Castiel's bed and taking his jacket off to toss it on the floor.
He couldn't dare to open his eyes. All he could do was lay completely frozen as Castiel kissed him before pulling away. It was barely a brush of his lips, shorter than a breath, and yet, Dean couldn't help but be greedy as he fluttered his eyes open, and grabbed Castiel by his wrist. Their faces were a mere inch away, and Dean breathed in the air Castiel had let out, before Castiel's eyes blinked open, and widened the moment he found Dean staring at him.
"You're so talented Dean. And kind, and quick, and smart. Why don't you focus more on yourself? You could get whatever you want in life. You could have your dream college, your dream job— anything you wanted."
"Clearly," Dean sneered, "-old enough to think a butter knife would save you."
"You mean Alastair?" Dean asked quietly, to which Castiel nodded. "I wonder hurt anyone, I promise. I'm just going to stay here with you, okay? Now
"Hello to you too, Dean," Castiel deadpanned, before narrowing his eyes at Dean, who seemed to be fidgeting with something in his hand, "—why won't you leave me alone, for
Cas. Then Bobby.
With a nonchalant shrug, Dean turned on his heel, tossing his phone in his hand like a ball, and sauntered away with a loud, depraved laugh.
"Are you sure you're not in love with him? I mean, I don't have anything against gay people, just so you know."
to which Dean simply shrugged quietly.
Dean sighed, and leaned back against the base of the tree, uncapping the cap of his water bottle to press it to his lips. Sweat dripped down his brow. His football jersey, a yellow and red jersey with the school logo on it, was soaked with sweat for having played in it for hours. After school football practice had become a routine on Thursdays, and those were the only days Dean and Castiel parted ways when school finished. Water dribbled down Dean's lips, and he ran a hand through his sweaty, damp hair, before reaching for his phone. Practice had just ended, which meant everyone had a while to relax before showering. The sound of grass crunching softly under somebody's feet caught Dean's attention, and he glanced up only to find Benny leaning against the tree beside him.
The tension that once seized Dean's body seeped into the floor as he took step after step towards Alastair, who watched him with uncertainty.
"Cas?"
"Dean?"
"You're— you're so big—" Castiel cried into his shoulder, and Dean turned to capture the boy's peachy lips in a heated kiss, "-it hurts—"
"Smoke break, but only five minutes. Deal?"
"What's this then?" Dean slapped a bundle of sheets against Castiel's chest, his teeth gritting as he let go of Castiel, towering above him fiercely. With his hands folded across his chest, Dean waited and watched, as Castiel grabbed the sheets and unfurled them. At the very top of the page, in bright red, was a C, and Castiel furrowed his eyebrows. "I—" He started, but the words died down on his throat the moment he flipped to the last page of the sheets.
"Let me go—
"Why are you drinking a whole bottle of beer? It's not good for you, Cas, and hey, have you had a whole bottle before? It won't be too much, but it's your fir—"
"I'm, I'm sorry, I should have knocked," She muttered, and Castiel sent her a polite smile.
“They’re not going to let us take all this coffee inside.”
Dr. Novak and Benny were sitting on the same side of the table, having left Sam’s space, where his drink was still sitting, empty.
company.”
“Good luck Dean.”
Dean didn’t know when the dizziness began to dissipate or his breathing became normal. He didn’t know when his body had actually relaxed.  And he certainly didn’t know at what point he had slipped his hands up to clasp Castiel’s hand between his two hands, fingers entwined, and to hold them against his chest under his chin. He just knew, he felt better more quickly than he’d ever had before and right now he just wanted to stay in this position for as long as he could.
“Oh, I was speeding? I didn’t realize.” Gabriel glanced at the speedometer quickly as he slowed down. He avoided her gaze as he turned left onto Friend Street.
Castiel decided to spend part of his evening finishing a book he’d been working on for the last two and a half months. He’d been so busy dealing with the fallout of Betta’s show, packing, moving and settling in that he’d ended up starting it over twice. He almost didn’t want to finish it, because he felt it would bring up bad feelings stagnating in the back of his mind.
“So, mind if I ask how you chose such diverse fields of confectioner, doctor of psychology and law enforcement? And manage to do them all at the same time?” Dean asked genuinely interested “I, myself, have two, I guess you could almost say, three, lines of work, but nothing so specialized that required a long term educational investment like you.”
“Thank you, Claire.” Rowena looked around. “Does anyone have anything to add?”
Why did he say that? Why did he say that? God damn it Novak!
He pinched and twirled the hard nubs of his own nipples as he envisioned having them sucked and bitten while someone lightly swirled their tongue around it. He thought of the feel of lips on his dick and the feel of being sucked off to the edge of orgasm, but not being allowed the follow through. And suddenly, his imagination gave him a masculine arm around him, rolling him backwards into their arms. He could almost feel an erect cock pressing against his backside as he took a deep breath, thinking about being taken from behind and not see who it was in a sea of bodies pleasuring each other. He felt the hot, hard length of it slide into the cleft of his buttocks. He squeezed the top of his dick and began to rub his thumb over the head in tantalizing circles, spreading the slick pre-cum before it became sticky. He felt his chin and throat grasped by strong hands with long, slender fingers, pulling his head back against rough stubble.  A now familiar gruff voice whispered, “I’m going to fuck you now, Mr. Winchester.”
“Dean Winchester.”
Dean ran his fingers through his hair and took a deep breath.
“Okay Sam. I believe you.”
“I called Balti, too.”
“OK. That’ll be three cups of gelato. One Berry Legal Raspberry, one Berry Legal Strawberry and one Hint of Mint Choco-lot. All Playing It Safe. That’s plain,” the young clerk whispered with a wink.
Later, Dean walked into the War room where everyone was waiting.
“But now you can be happier, Dad. After all, Claire and I are growing up and we want you to have someone to be with that makes you happy in your old age. We don’t want you to be old and alone.” Jack looked up and beamed at his father.
Dean’s breath came a bit faster and more desperate. “Yeah. I don’t know why…” he tried to take another deep breath, but failed. It was shallow and quick. “I don't know why that doctor wouldn’t let me have him in here. It’s just...it's wrong!” He sat forward trying to catch a breath.
He bent down, squatting on his haunches and finally looked at the excited dog as she jumped on his lap, rubbing and whining for petting. Hugging her, he curled around her, nestled his face in her head and neck, and whispered sweet doggy nothings in her ears. Then, he gave her a hearty pat on her sides and stood as she jumped off his lap.
Moaning, he stroked his cock a few last times as he came, cum jetting straight up and arcing over his pants and t-shirt. He gasped for air and squeezed a few strokes more as the last twitching throbs of his spent dick faded. Fondling his still-swollen cock, he looked up at the ceiling gasping to catch his breath. He closed his lids and had a vision of blue eyes and a firm round tight ass.
“Thanks, Uncle Benny. You’re the best.” Ben retorted.
“Who are you?”
“You can cut to the chase and just tell me how soon I’m going to get this cast off.” Dean said slapping the afflicted leg’s thigh.
“Oh, you wound me to my core. Don’t treat me like that Castiel. I just had to check back with you on what you’d said.”
“What are you talking about, Dean? Make what sound perverted? What’s going on with you today?” Sam put his pen down and turned to give Dean the once over.
Sam paid and made his way towards the exit. He glanced over to see if he might catch Lion Eyes' gaze again, but the man had his back to the counter folding a box for a customer’s donut order. Sam thought he might have to come to the Sweet Spot again very soon.
“If I didn’t have to go in and be social or get my children home to have a talk with them over my choice to live the way I should have been living years ago, I’d be doing ungodly things to you right now,” Castiel’s voice rumbled along Benny’s throat, “but this will have to tide us over for tonight.”
Emma, Ben and Dean had convinced Castiel to let Claire and Jack ride to and from school with them as well as stay with them and Dean after school while the doctor was still at work. Castiel was actually relieved knowing his children would not have to be home alone in the evenings until he got off. In the city, he had a sitter. Just a college girl who lived next door, but he knew the children were in good hands. He had not thought ahead to set up child care, after he’d ended up beginning at the clinic sooner than he had expected to do so.
“How do I look?”
Dean looked around quickly, thinking. “No, no. You’ve cleaned those plates and the glasses, so I’m good to reach them where they are now. Thanks for stopping by. At least it was better than I thought it was going to be.”
you had a collar on your dog.” Castiel was getting a bit fed up with Dean Winchester’s attitude.
“I don’t know. I really had no interest in him, except to get out of there. Though he did have some of the bluest eyes I’ve ever seen on a human.” Dean added remembering looking into them while the doctor attempted to clean that ungodly red sauce off his…
“Okay, gentlemen. If you’ll excuse me, I was not planning on starting work on this day and I have my vehicle hooked up, towing a small moving trailer behind it, blocking three spaces in the clinic parking area. I just stopped by to pick up keys for my supposed living arrangements, find out the location, and get there so I may endeavor to unload said trailer of my belongings before nightfall.”
Castiel turned and unlocked his office. It was furnished with the typical cherry wood desk, credenza and matching filing cabinets. There was a print of the ocean, a fake plant in the corner near the window, and a real ivy plant growing along the length of the top of the credenza.  Castiel had seen the same style of office his entire life. It must be Doctor Office Decorating 101 in the design field.
“Look, this is nothing I don’t deal with on an almost daily basis. Red tape and power mad microdictators. We just need a little patience.” Sam began gathering the pertinent files from the stacks they’d laid out. He set others in a tall stack near the end of the bar.
“What happened to you? I mean when you were little. Did someone hurt you?”
Once they finished, Michael took the three separate stacks of the copied files and placed each in a separate accordion folder they purchased.
Dean hung up. It wasn’t like Emma to jump into a fight. Ben, yes. Emma, it depended on the situation. He picked up the two-way radio.
“Lucifer? As in like the Devil or something?”
”So get this, according to the lore, Demigod-like immortal creatures that thrive on creating mischief and mayhem. With the power to make objects materialize out of thin air, the Trickster accomplishes its destructive feats via unusual and often humorous means, its intent to humble the self-important. The Tricker's metabolism is such that it craves sugary treats and consumes calories voraciously. To kill a Trickster one must obtain a stake dipped in the blood of its victim and plunge it into the creature's heart. Famous Tricksters include Loki of Scandinavian myth and Anasi of West Africa.”
“Oh? So you met them already?”
Castiel Novak sighed. The moving truck should have been here an hour ago. Castiel, Claire and Jack had just moved into the neighborhood that day. He bought the house next door to the Winchesters unbeknownst to him.
Finally, Dr. Novak agreed, and the entire group began to move from the auditorium. Claire and Jack headed towards the junior high side to retrieve their belongings from their classrooms and lockers, while Ben and Emma went to the high school side. Their parents and uncles went to the office to sign the papers and check them out of school.
“Thank you!”
“Believe me, I would if I could. I think I’ve watched too many mafia movies to be any good at actually being a mafia man.”
“First Question, what is your name?”
“You're possessing some poor bastard?”
Daddy Bear
“I don’t care if your dad likes my dad! My dad likes Mr. Lafitte and I’m not going to help keep Mr. Lafitte away from my dad, just because you think your dad might like my dad, because what if he doesn’t? Or what if your dad just wants to fool around? My dad hasn’t had anyone since we were born…and, and I just want him to know how special he is and to have love in his life from someone who is giving and caring.” Sam could hear the anguish and tears threatening to spill in the tone of Claire’s voice.
“I see the reflector way up there.” Jack pointed. “Well, I did but now I don’t see it. It was orange.”
He kissed Benny back.
“He’s not wrong, Ben.” Emma defended her father’s choice of words. “Look what our alliance accomplished today already. We defended one of our own,” she pointed to Jack, at which Clark flung his arm around Jack’s neck and squeezed close. “We made new friends,” she said to Claire and Kaia, and Jack and Clark. “And maybe we can continue our
“Yes.”
He’d spoken with Ben briefly, but Emma was in the shower. They were both still feeling unwell, but neither had a temperature that morning. Emma was able to eat dry toast, and juice without nausea. Ben, who insisted he was starving and wanted eggs, toast and sausage, promptly lost it all fifteen minutes into eating. Ben grumbled about wanting to go home, but not wanting to go back to school. His last concern was that he really wanted to see Miracle and was happy she’d been found. Then he had passed the phone back to Sam.
By the time they packed, Michael and Gabriel ran their errands to exchange the files, and they spent a good amount of time playing games and eating pizza with Castiel, Michael was more resolved than ever. It was difficult to look at Castiel as he was now and compare his demeanor with how Michael remembered him as he was when he’d first started kindergarten.
It was just after 9pm when the deputies rang the front doorbell. Deputy Barker could tell that Gabriel was a bit disappointed in missing Sam Winchester, but still ribbed him about it.
“Yeah Dad. Their names are Mr. Novak, Claire and Jack!” Emma added to what her brother had said.
Castiel leaned down and kissed him. He laid down next to Dean. He pulled out a blanket and some water. He helped Dean drink some of it.
Once everyone was together, Dean explained what Principal Macleod had said. It was decided that the group of kids would stay and try to help Emma and Ben with their projects. Later in the afternoon when the school closed, they would ride back to Dean’s in the truck, making sure to call just as they were leaving. They were to leave in time to be home before five o’clock that evening. Dean informed them that his brother Sam would most likely be able to follow the kids in the truck home.
“Take a load off, Doc.” Dean pointed his fork towards one of the barstools at the island.
It was a warm day. There was a breeze. People were out and about in the shops and on the sidewalk. It seemed everyone was enjoying the day outside.
She barked and looked towards the bedroom door.
“Alright, alright. I do.” Gabriel admitted. “But I swear, I can never seem to be in the right place at the right time to meet him.”
“Next time you all decide to go off with your sister or little brother, you must inform me. I am his mother and need to know his whereabouts, and especially with whom he is playing. Besides, if you knew your cousin was coming in to visit, you could at least be around to greet him when he arrives. I’m very busy and don’t need a kink in my schedule to wreak havoc with my time.” She looked at the three of them. “I really do not like this new trend of the 1980s with wearing sunglasses constantly.” She shook her head and walked off.
“I don’t know, Sam, can we just drop it. I just need to get laid. I don’t even remember the last time I had sex. There’s just someone I find attractive and I’m not their type. I just…let’s leave it at that. C’mon, I’m going to call the bank.” Dean wheeled himself back into the house.
“It’s OK, Cassie. You don’t have to get a milkshake. It’s OK. You can get whatever you want.” Gabriel placated his while trying to keep his eyes on the road.
Claire and Jack ran upstairs as soon as they got in the door, were washed up, and in their pajamas with their teeth brushed and back downstairs for their family meeting within ten minutes. They were just getting seated on the large sectional when they saw headlights flash across the front windows. Castiel went to the door. It was Gabriel.
Michael just shook his head.
“It’s about time.”
“Now, Mr. Winchester, I received your messages and looked into our records, and to be honest, I really thought it was a pointless endeavor. After all, any accounts your wife may have had would have been settled after her death.”
It was a long arduous road for Dean to come back from. He went through untold amounts of medication, therapies and alcohol before he was given a service dog. That first dog, The Colonel, a German shepherd, was a godsend. Though he’d never been much of a dog person, that dog saved his life. Soon after, when he was once again feeling more human than possessed by demons, he met Lisa. He could not say he was ever really “in love” with her, but he did love her. She gave him a sense of stability, strength, normalcy and peace. She gave him more of what he’d always heard a true “home” meant and could be.
“Gabriel, you just write a vague note, like you usually do saying you’re hanging out with one or more of your friends or whatever you want to write. They don’t usually worry where or who you’re with, because they know by now that half the time you’re fibbing anyway. Mom decided quite some time ago that she didn’t want to be bothered with worrying about what you were actually doing because ‘you’re a good boy usually and anything you might do wrong could be placed under the ‘boys will be boys’ column.’”
Gabe slowly made his way back to their table. Jules was still there talking with Michael, who looked very interested and was smiling.
“I’m sorry.” Castiel said softly as he stepped back.
He huffed out a long breath.
The amount of compassion and love he felt pouring through the phone almost broke him. He took a deep breath and answered.
“I’d venture to say that Jack will have absolutely no problem with your announcement. I have the feeling Claire will be fine, too.” Benny said with a fond smile. “But that boy knows his mind and is the sweetest, most tender-hearted young man I think I’ve ever met.”
“Good work, …nurse?” Castiel addressed Adam.
“Uh, Lee as well. Like I said, it’s a small town.” Benny gave a sheepish shrug.
“Just relax. There’s no sense in worrying about this right now.” Sam said, still stacking and moving files. “All these files over here, you can put away. I’m only going to need these few over here and maybe you can try again to go through any of Lisa’s old stuff again, and try to find out anything you can about any loans she may have taken out secretly or after she was ill. This wholly may depend on how ill she was when this originated.”
They both walked towards the front entrance, even though no one had come to unlock it yet. Michael gently tapped on the glass when he saw the librarian walk past. She stopped, looked at her watch, and pointed to the clock over the desk. Michael smashed his face against the door to see the clock’s time. He frowned and held up the coffee and bag of croissants. He nudged Gabriel to hold his bag up, too.
“There are eight hooks on the wall six feet from you. I’m glad I wasn’t on crutches yet. I’d have probably landed on the floor.”
“We… we thought it would be nice to do since they’re new to the neighborhood…” Emma said.
They quickly went towards the research area and began setting their things down. The librarian came over expectantly. They heard her stomach growl. Without so much as the decency to blush, she quickly grabbed a coffee from one of the trays and opened a bag to look for sugar and cream.
Dean pulled open the door and immediately was set upon by his very happy, very clean and fresh smelling girl.  He caught a glimpse of the doctor over the top of the fluffy head. He saw a somewhat somber face, eyes dark, break into a soft and tender smile. The stormy dark eyes lit to a brilliant blue, then grew dark again with a seeming sadness or disappointment as Castiel looked down. Miracle’s tongue came up to lick his mouth and nose, and the doctor’s face was hidden from his view.
“Oh sweet child. You do know that you are allowed to feel? You deserve to feel. You are a sweet, tender Angel of a man who has had hardship and loss, and you cannot lock away your emotions hoping that pain and tragedy never touch you again. You can’t let guilt steal you living as a caring, giving, feeling, emotional human. Removing your humanity won’t remove this misplaced guilt you carry. Please, listen to me, Cassie. I will love you no matter whom you choose to love. Your children will love and adore you no matter whom you choose to love. What matters is not withholding your humanity and emotions because of guilt. There is some man out there who deserves the vast amount of love you can give. And more importantly still, there is a man out there who has vast amounts of love to bestow on you that you more than deserve. And don’t you ever let ANYONE tell you different, including that voice inside of yourself.”
Castiel narrowed his eyes at Dean, and flipped over through the sample questionnaire, before sucking in a breath and handing it over to Dean.
Absently, he reached a hand out under the table, and slipped it into Castiel's. Castiel turned to him with a questioning look, but Dean simply smiled. Castiel squeezed his hand under the table and turned back to the conversation. This time, Dean decided to listen in as well.
"So, first date, whaddya' think?" He asked, his usual boyish charm on display, and Castiel grinned.
"I—I—"
It was nothing short of needy— the way Dean ate him. Spit dripping down his chin, nose dragging up and down against Castiel's taint as Dean pressed his tongue against the pucker and licked at it, toying and playing with the rim, grazing it with his teeth, and plundering it with the tip of his heavy, heated tongue. Castiel could see nothing but white as he felt his toes curl, and his hand gripped Dean's head, pushing him in deeper, keeping him in place, making sure he goes as deep as he can. On the bed, Castiel squirmed, arching his back and crumpling the bedsheet, before feeling the coil in his gut snap.
"And you left?" Benny gasped. Dean furrowed his eyebrows, studying Benny's face for any traces of amusement, but in his eyes was sincerity.
"Okay whatever," Dean rolled his eyes before mumbling a soft, "-idiot," And grabbed Castiel by the shoulders to turn him around, towards the door to the exit, "-now, we have to be at class in five."
What Dean witnessed has been the tip of the iceberg. How would Castiel ever tell him, or anyone, for that matter, what Alastair had done— with his fingers, with his friend's fingers, with an empty beer bottle— how they shoved it in and out, how they made
in the world," Meg quipped, to which Castiel snorted, and Dean sighed.
best ACDC album by the way," Castiel rambled on, and Dean, to his credit, listened to each of his rambling quietly, with a fond, soft look.
But the answer came to him sooner than he expected.
The shame. The guilt. The disgust. The helplessness. A string of words in his mind, echoing over and over again—
But knowing Dean, loving him, being with him had changed Castiel.
The sirens screeched through the air, loud and deafening. Blue and red lights tore through the night sky, the scent of alcohol and mud in the air, as Dean's feet clamoured against the ground, one after the other. His flesh was on fire, nevers flaring, and face heated from having run across miles without a pause. A palpable gush of adrenaline coursed through his body as he ran, a large, bulging black satchel hung across his shoulder.
The bo—
you— don't pick fights, don't mingle with those rich brats, don't let them influence you. Keep your head down, be sincere, do your work— but no. And now look at what's happened. Dean, I can't keep hiding you away from the world—"
"A hundred per-cent," Meg said, and shoved Castiel's shoulder with a smile.
Andrea joined them, Benny's girlfriend and Dean's classmate, and she rambled on about something, but neither Benny nor Dean seemed to care as they trudged down the corridor.
"Hmm?"
"Mother, father, this is Dean Winchester."
Dean, I'm going to come—" Castiel gasped, and Dean tightened a hand around his neck.
Their eyes met, and Dean let himself stare into the pool of warmth and affection in Castiel's eyes, before nodding, and sending Castiel a small smile. Cas, on the other hand, reached up and pressed a kiss to Dean's temple, brushing a hand down his cheek, before turning back to the curtain. Castiel went in, and Dean followed him inside. The parlor was a large room with a few loveseats lined against the wall, bookshelves, a coffee-table, and a well-organised liquor cabinet.
He didn't mean to, but he couldn't help it.
Meg sniffled, and Castiel realised she had tears in her eyes. Before he could move, though, Dean had walked over to her to rub a hand down her back.
"What happened to your face?" Castiel asked, popping the bubble of silence between them, as he reached out to graze a thumb against one of Alastair's scratches on Dean's cheek. It must have reddened, and raised above his skin, because it stung when Castiel hurt, and Dean winced. Castiel snatched his hand away at once, but Dean simply sent him a vague smile.
"I think you should leave." It wasn't hostile or harsh, and yet, Dean was jumping back in his seat.
Castiel turned to Meg. Meg had gone pale and speechless, and her eyelashes fluttered nervously as she faltered backwards. Castiel reached out to grab her by the arm, and with a soft sigh, turned back to Mr. Singer, who had been observing them with keen, narrow eyes.
, Castiel had said. And here Dean was, forgiving as always.
the panicked pounding of Castiel's heart, as he plucked him off the step-ladder, and set him down on the floor. Castiel's arms remained hooked around Dean's neck, and Dean couldn't find it in himself to pull his arms away from Castiel's waist as they stood there, simply drinking in the moment.
Dean blushed for a second, and rubbed his hand across his neck before turning his gaze downwards.
The words pulled an unbidden laugh past Castiel's lips, and he pulled away to stare up at Dean, "-is that so? Was it that light of a punch?"
"Have you ever done this before?" Dean asked softly, to which Castiel shook his head. He heard Dean chuckle, and a moment later, Dean was picking up the pace on his hand, squeezing gently and rubbing at the tips. Castiel was leaking, and
"W-what?"
Castiel didn't answer.
"I love you," Castiel called out with a roll of his eyes.
They were going to do it— they were
"No, I did, I did. But I just— I just kept thinking of how stupid I was. And how embarrassing it was. I should have known better. I could have put myself and my parents in danger, I— I just needed an outlet, Dean. I know I was wrong. I'm just— ever since Alastair— I just feel so ugly, Dean. I can't even look at myself in the mirror without thinking of it. I don't even want to step out of my house, but being with you and fighting against Alastair is what keeps me up. But I'm trying, I really am, and I just— I can't look at myself the same way. So, please, can you delete those videos and pictures of me that you had a few months ago?"
Castiel smiled, and watched as Dean swaggered down the stairs. The front door shut with a loud clamour, and a moment later, Castiel was pushing his panties off, and climbing onto bed with a bottle of lube.
Everything Dean had, every trick up his sleeve to warm up to Castiel had failed.
Dean went silent once again, and yet, Castiel was focused onto nothing but him, watching and studying him, listening with rapt attention.
"You're a fucking slut, aren't you?" Dean growled, and paced around Castiel's chair, eyes tracking down every inch of his body. Supple, tanned skin, thick meaty thighs, a plump peachy ass, narrow waist, sharp hips, strong shoulders, a tempting neck, and
"What?" Dean asked, his voice low, a pang of fear gripping his shoulders as he stares up at Benny.
The lectures flew by, and soon enough, everyone was leaving. Everyone except Dean and Castiel. Castiel, the sly fox that he was, had conveniently managed to leave Michael's binder on a desk, which meant Michael would come back for it. And God, was Castiel excited to see his face when he caught them.
Castiel had needed him last time. And Dean had been too weak to help him.
As they pulled out of the parking lot and onto the highway, Castiel watched as the trees passed by in a flurry. The radio caught frequency once again, and an old, Aerosmith song played on the radio faintly. With the window open, the fresh, cold air kissing his face, Castiel let his eyes flutter shut.
Dean blushed at that, and Castiel laughed to himself, much to the confusion of the others walking a few feet behind them.
It was strange. Having Dean. Never in a million years did Castiel expect some one to fall for him, much less, put their life on the line for him. But here Dean was, brave and handsome, a man who could have anyone he wanted, settling for Castiel. Castiel moved in closer to Dean's side, as they snuggled up under the covers together — tired and sleepy. Castiel threw an arm around Dean, and buried his head in the crook of Dean's neck. He felt Dean's hand snake down to the small of his back, before resting there.
Castiel felt his heart drop, and he let out a soft, broken sigh. So he wasn't the only one feeling it.
A second later, Castiel snapped his eyes up to meet Dean's. "Wow." He mumbled, and ran a thin finger down Dean's chest. "You're looking fine."
Castiel remembered the day Dean had called him into his office, after months of stolen, sensual glances, months of dancing around each other, months of unspoken words, when the levee broke at last, neither of them had been able to pull away as they went at it, hands flying, moans echoing, wood creaking, skin slapping, and breaths mingling together as Dean took Castiel against his desk, unbothered of the papers and files lying on it. Hours later, with both hearts on their sleeves, they'd decided to let their relationship grow in secret, until the end of the semester, after which Castiel would search for a job.
"Hey, blame the hormones."
"Please don't leave me, Dean, I'm so sorry—"
Castiel felt full— too full. He had Dean's cock inside of him, and nothing could ever feel better. Not his own fingers, not a dildo, nothing— nothing beat the feeling of a cock twitching inside him. And then there was the feeling of being held by Dean— of having Dean's tall, strong form hover over him, of having his thick arms engulf him in a tight hold as he rocked his hips into Castiel. Dean quickened his pace, thrusting with firm, precise thrusts, that managed to graze across Castiel's prostate and sent him curling off the bed.
"Thank you. Get home safe."
"Well, my parents want me to join the business."
"Are you sure about this, Castiel?"
, whatever that meant.
And Castiel nodded. They smiled, and Castiel turned back to the blackboard.
"Dean, I—"
wrapped around a cock; a structured face, stunning vibrant baby-blue eyes— frigid and indifferent, and an athletic, well-kept body Dean would love to bruise and tease.
Castiel knew a lost battle when he saw it. There would be no arguing against Benny.
A beat passed between them.
Dean eyed the boy for a moment, before quirking his lip. "No idea."
The timer of the video beeped, and indicated the end of the video, and Castiel hastily pulled his trousers up and zipped himself. He grabbed his phone off the toilet-seat lid and browsed through his gallery to review the video he had just recorded. The video played, and Castiel watched himself bent over against the wall, only his hips and legs in view as he spread his knees apart and stretched his ass wide open, watching as the green plug fluttered inside his asshole.
"Boss, I'm sorry, I took it too far, I thought it was just for fun but I crossed my limi—"
"Dean," Castiel admonished, but Dean tuned him out in favour of pressing his hands into his face as he sucked in a deep, laboured breath. Castiel seemed to have noticed his lack of attention, because he went silent, and Dean wondered if he would walk away too. Dean wouldn't be surprised if he did.
"Okay," Dean hummed, obviously dejected, and as much as Castiel hated being harsh to him, mentally, he wasn't ready for a therapist. There was a great deal of things he would have to face, starting from telling his parents about the rape, down to finding out a good therapist who was able to guide him in the right way. Perhaps some day, he would choose to go to therapy, but for now, he was content with taking rest. Besides, Dean and he had decided already (more like Dean had endearingly threatened Castiel) that Castiel would take a leave from school for at least three days to rest and get better, and over that course of time, Dean would give Castiel the notes for every lesson, every three days.
The bell rung, English class over, Mrs. Barnes turned to the door and walked out the class. The students all let loose, chattering and laughing amongst their friends, and Dean himself turned back to Benny to tease him about something he'd said. But then. The classroom door shut.
"What is it, Bobby? Somethin' on your mind?"
"Then I think it's as good a dream as any other."
Castiel's eyes snapped over to meet Dean's. It was the first time Dean had called him, anything besides
"Don't even think about it, remember what Dr. Sunder said? Two weeks, buddy. Hold your horses for two weeks."
Dean seemed to grin at that, rather wickedly, as he fastened his pace, and with a deep, heavy thrust, stilled inside Castiel, cock twitching for a second, before he came, sending another load of come gushing through Castiel's insides, hot, thick white semen streaming out from around Dean's cock as Dean pulled out, and pressed a kiss to Castiel's hair. Castiel sighed, and went limp against the desk, as Dean reached a hand down to work his cock to a release.
"Yeah," A smile crept across Dean's face as he let his eyes wander into the distance, "-and this laugh, that's just, so free and bright. And when he smiles, I don't even know what to say, I'm just, so speechless. And every time I do or say something he doesn't like, he gets all pouty and grumpy. It's so fun teasing him. And, and, and he hates that I smoke. He doesn't say it out loud, but he scrunches up his nose every time he smells the smoke. I'm trying to quit for him." Dean turned to the side to meet Benny's face, only to find Benny staring at him, his mouth hung open and eyes wide.
"To who." Dean growled, and Castiel caught a glimpse of raw, unhinged fury in Dean's eyes, something he'd only seen a few weeks ago, at Benny's farmhouse, when Dean had stormed into the room Alastair had Castiel locked inside.
"Sometimes, I wonder if things would have been—" A tear rolled down his face, and he turned his head away, burying it in his shoulder to sniffle, before turning back to Castiel, and crushing the butt of his cigarette onto the concrete, "-if things would have been different if mom was alive."
The air around them changed.
"Maybe. Maybe not."
"Inside?" Dean asked, more to himself than Cas, but Cas nodded anyway.
Mrs. Berry grinned. "Lawrence High's name in this country has remained untarnished for years. What do you kids think you can possibly do?"
"I feel it too some times. But I like to believe it doesn't have to do with us as a couple, but more with us as individuals. You have shit to sort, I do too. Maybe you'll never really understand me, and maybe I'll never really understand you. Are you fine with that, Dean?"
he gasped, and his mouth fell open. Dean kept going. Slow, steady, allowing Castiel time to adjust to the sensation. Their eyes met, and Dean faltered as he stared down at Castiel, who slipped his hands around Dean's face, pulling him down into a long, lousy kiss.
Dean came all over Castiel's face and thick, black-rimmed glasses. It was glorious. Castiel licked every single drop of come off his face and smacked his lips together.
Once the haze in Dean's mind seeped away, he realised just how big he'd fucked up.
The five of them erupted into cheer, only to hear a loud, sharp
"Dean, breathe, boy, breathe. Calm down, just, calm down—"
"For now. We're hoping to get more people soon. But for now, these are the ones who've been there from the start."
Michael hated him. No, scratch that. Michael envied him. Because he was everything Michael was not. Michael couldn't stand Dean Winchester, and the whole of Lawrence High, including Castiel, clearly knew that. Dean didn't care. He didn't have time to care for a nerd's opinion. He was too busy being cool and charming.
"Dean," Castiel gasped, but the words on his tongue vanished as Dean pulled him close, sliding his arms around Castiel's waist in what resembled a tight, crushing hug.
"Hey, talk to me, please," Dean urged him on, now pulling away to cup his hands across Castiel's jaw, letting a vague smile pull at his lips to reassure Cas, "—you're my strong boy, Cas, please, just this once, tell me what it was."
Dean dropped his keys into the bowl near the door, and let his backpack sit against the wall as he kicked his shoes off, and trudged into the passage with heavy footsteps. He was tired. The deadlines at Sandover were coming closer each day, and each day, Dean had to toil harder at his desk. His head ached with the throb of a soon to come migraine, and his muscles had all but gone sore. With a sigh, he walked into the living room, where he could hear the sound of a video game playing. His boyfriend was sure to be there, and Dean hoped Castiel would be able to make him feel better.
"Novak needs you," Benny croaked out, and tried to slip out of Dean's grasp, pushing Dean away. Dean growled, and watched as Benny rushed toward the staircase. With his feet as light as air, Dean trudged up the staircase, and with his eyes scanning the dark, empty corridor for as far as he could see, he noticed the light under one, particular door seep out of the room.
"It was the three of them, Castiel, all three—" She whispered against his chest, "-I couldn't even fight back."
, if only Castiel hadn't held him back, if only he'd let Dean have his way, Alastair would be in the ER with a few broken teeth. But Castiel would only be hurt if Dean went against his wishes, and with everything Castiel had done for Dean, everything Castiel meant to Dean, he would be the worst friend ever if he let those motherfuckers get away with their tormenting.
It was embarrassing as shit. But hilarious. Castiel had turned ten shades of red, and Dean had stared daggers at Benny almost thrice, before he returned to his seat.
—" Castiel gasped, feeling his thighs begin to cramp up as Dean sucked him, bobbing his head and slurping him clean, before popping off his cock with an obnoxiously filthy squelch, and staring up at Cas with heated, pink cheeks.
An unexpected laugh rumbled past Dean's lips, a laugh so free and unrestrained, that it made Castiel realise, that if there was any possibility of him ever
"Oh, never, never, you fuck me so good, Dean, oh god, right there—"
Castiel licked his lips once, caught off-guard by Deans sudden insistence, and he set his burger down. He wiped his hands on a tissue and composed himself, before turning back up to Dean.
"I am thinking," Dean mused, "—a lot of things."
Dean chuckled, and brushed a hand down Castiel's face to wipe a bead of sweat away. "You're gonna' have to go back, eventually, y'know."
Dean watched him for a moment, before making his way over to the bed. Castiel scooted to the side to make space for him, and watched as Dean dropped down beside him, sinking back into the pillows and pulling Castiel flush against him. Castiel chuckled, before giving into Dean's childishness, and felt Dean bury his face against Castiel's stomach.
Castiel shifted off the bed, and walked over to the door, however, before he could leave, Dean reached out to grab him by the wrist, and Castiel jerked around.
for Dean. It shouldn't have hurt as much as it did. Come on, they weren't even friends.
Dean's anger teetered on a fine edge.
"I missed you so much," Cas pouted, his big, round blue princess eyes peering up into Dean's, and Dean almost fell in love with him once again, as he sat up, and pulled Castiel into a hug. He pressed his lips to Castiel's forehead, and let the younger boy bury himself in Dean's chest.
Dean thought to himself,
"Ah— ah— ah—" Castiel kept whining, but Dean didn't bother soothing him any longer as he felt his orgasm close in on him. Castiel's cocklet bounced against his stomach, bobbing with every thrust Dean made, until at last, Dean felt his gut tighten, and he came inside Castiel with a loud cry of
Dean paused. A sudden pang of uncertainty washed over him. He wanted to stay calm, to be positive and to be true, to let them know that he only meant Castiel well, but somehow, Dean found himself doubting his own actions. What if he did or said something offensive, and never even realised it? How off-putting would that be. The Novak's would surely despise him. But then again—
"Cas, I—" Dean started, squeezing Castiel's hand, as he pulled Castiel closer to him. Castiel seethed with anger, eyes wide and glowering as he stared at Dean, and demanded.
"—he should be kind, selfless. Gentle. Funny. Smart—"
The chapter you have all been waiting for. Castiel and Dean finally do it.
"Because I, because I—"
"Oh, hello Dean. It's a pleasure to meet you," Dr. Sunders smiled, and handed Castiel a folder, which he browsed through as she continued, "—so, like I said, these are mostly muscle pain relievers, and some things you have to keep in mind are eating healthy, keeping yourself hydrated, and taking a lot of rest. Your body has been through a lot already, Castiel, it needs time. Now look, I'm not a psychologist, but what I
