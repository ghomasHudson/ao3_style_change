John took in a breath and opened his eyes, still in a state of confusion.
"The memories are quite disturbing. Mother and father had to seek psychological help after poor Redbeard suffered a couple of severe bug bites."
"It's too dangerous. You should just stay here for the night." Mrs. Holmes caressed her youngest son's cheek. "I barely get to see you anymore and it would make your father and I very happy to have you here a little longer." She smiled at Sherlock.
Lightning bolts banged against Sherlock’s heart. It was electrifying but not in a good way. It felt like vultures were ripping apart his skin. His blood had thickened and he felt the pain as it pushed through his body trying to find an escape. He, himself, was looking for an escape. He could feel these animals pecking away at his arteries. He stared blankly ahead and tears began to fall. His lips suffered the cold of a thousand winters and they began to quiver. His cheekbones had never been so dominant as they were now.
Mrs. Holmes walked towards John and took ahold of his arms. "John, dear. Please be safe. I know I can trust you but promise me that you won't speed even if it's only light showers." She gave him a warm smile and then they shared a cozy hug.
, John thought as he spun low, crouching to leg-sweep an imaginary enemy.
It couldn’t be as dangerous as Mycroft had always insisted, surely.
Sherlock thought. Now there was an inroad, and one that wasn’t too far from the truth. The way his breathing hitched as he asked let Sherlock know--this would be something he found enjoyable.
“Christ, Sherlock,” John murmurs, a solid rumble against his ear. “Who’d have guessed that Sherlock Holmes would be such a dirty pillow-biter? Gagging for a cock so big I had to buy an enhancement?” Each word is accented with the slow, sweet drag of the toy, cruising sinfully along Sherlock’s prostate, so tight against it he could swear he felt the individual veins that decorate its surface. “Would anyone else give you this? Could anyone else?”
John had just enough time to glance toward Brother Vincent, then Sister Verreuil before nodding and turning on his heel: Brother Vincent, stricken, and Sister Verreuil, curiously intent.
“Bloody fuck, seriously?” She groaned, flashed him a sincerely apologetic wince before pitching her voice upward to be heard through the door. “Go away. Whatever it is, it can surely wait--”
John turned to see Sister Verreuil standing there, her chisel-fine features still regarding him intently.
“You’re absolutely right. We haven’t. Can’t say I’ve wanted to.” He let every last ounce of his distrust, his disdain show in his voice. Then he doubled-down on it with direct eye-contact and a leery smile--the one even Brother Vincent found threatening.
Just seeing her like this--open and soft--was a gift Sherlock had never expected, not even as he’d goaded her in the office at the NSY, not as he’d answered her email or made his way over to her flat. And yet here it was, offered to him as a reward of good service.
,” Jim mused. “Let’s see if we can’t change that.”
“I’m no longer a Brother.”
“Emile Didikani. Okay.” John, not entirely caught up, just nodded and turned to leave.
, or the ability to “see down the long road,”--which is to say, they are seers and can perform divination of both the past and present. (This is not a common ability, nor is it limited to the Tsingani in a form of race-based exoticism. Literally every culture Phèdre comes into contact with, including her native D’Angeline, have their forms of mystics.)
she had hoped that would be the end of it.
the first time it needed saying, or
Sherlock followed on wobbling knees as they moved down the hall. The rest of the decrepit asylum was much worse for wear than his own cell, and he couldn’t help but wonder at that. Had Jim ordered his to be less severe, or had it simply been the luck of the draw? Chipped paint and the stink of sea air and mildew permeated the air beneath the weak stench of bleach. Someone had tried valiantly and failed to reclaim this hellhole. Light mid-afternoon sunlight streamed in through the windows, weak even here in the Mediterranean, thanks to the oppressive January cold. A draft wafted down the corridor against them. Sherlock shivered beneath his thin, stained scrubs.
Life in
Sherlock’s ridiculous fancy-dress boots slap the tarmac as they speed back toward Billy’s house. The cold air burns in his lungs.
John, damn him, flicked a glance in Sherlock’s direction before shrugging. “Beats me. It’s probably something I said.”
Three sleepless nights later found Sherlock and John chasing their suspect, Marcus Smith, through Peckham on foot, John cursing his risk-taking all the while.
Sherlock ended the call, looked to John, who’d tensed, ready to spring into action based only on Sherlock’s tone. John gave him a single curt nod, and they bolted out the door.
Well. Sherlock could learn to be fine with that--who needed friends when he had an entire police force at hand to supply him with cases, and his pick of patrons from a dazzling buffet of connections, all willing to lavish him with just the sort of attention Kushiel demanded of him? And, if he got his true desire, would he even
He wasn’t sure he could do those sorts of things, and suppressed a moment of doubt. If Sherlock needed what John couldn’t give, how could they ever make this work?
“Sherlock, what--?” John asked, and time crashed back together again.

5.) The President of France, Daniel L'Envers, gave Sherlock a medal called the Companion's Star, which gives him access to the president at any time, and confers one favour of Sherlock's choosing.
gone after that drunk driver?
“Guffawing? Who actually says that word?” John cupped his hands together to send a bigger splash at Sherlock. The water echoed loudly against itself, enough to overpower the noise of the crickets and frogs that still sang into the night. Sherlock ducked beneath the water, and shortly John felt strong, thin fingers grasp his shoulders, push him down under. He barely had time to clasp his nose shut before water engulfed him.
John stepped away and whirled to face the door, his mind finally hitting that silent calm. Only that high, clear note rang in his ears. It was just faint enough to draw the consciousness to the centre, which let instinct direct muscle memory.
Sherlock pushed the thought away, and closed his eyes to focus on what they knew. How could he prove his worth, to Sally and Lestrade? To John?
It made John think of the dream he’d had, where Sherlock had worn nothing but chains and a bronze mask. He clenched his jaw and remained silent.
“Irene Adler’s creature,” Victor mused. “I’m sure the auction was rigged. Why did she send you to me?”
John leaned stiffly on his cane before a great old oak, maybe a few metres away.
The door squeaked, louder than a gunshot in the tomblike silence. Holding his breath, Sherlock stepped inside.
“What the hell happened in there?” John asked. Already he’d pulled out his mobile, was tapping in the number to call the driver back round. They’d only been out for two hours at best.
Jim turned, his smile so soft it was obscene. “No. I’d no more murder you than I’d destroy a priceless vase.” He held one
The soft growl Lestrade emitted was affirmative. Sherlock had guessed well.
“This is my old friend, Sherlock. Come greet Jim Moriarty.”
“Sherlock, we talked about this--it’s not a good idea--our vows--”
A low buzz simmered in John’s head again, and he found himself speechless. Only one question forced its way out. “But if he was a Cassiline, how could he possibly be your ancestor?”
“Ah, Cassiline! Here I’ve given you a lovely little place to keep your vigil--I do
It reminded Sherlock of the John he first met, the night of his debut and the months following, but where

“Exactly,” Liliane replied. “And as long as you live, you will find yourself at crossroads. We all do, but the stakes may be much higher for you.”
The sea is calling him, and there is only so long he can stall. He knows this.
Bathed in the white wash of light, the shirtless corpse’s pallor was enough to see it had been water-logged for some time. The lacerations and sagging nature of his skin suggested more than two weeks, and that he had been murdered before being dumped in the river: chunks of flesh were missing from the victim’s face, with a message slashed into his chest:
Sherlock narrowed his eyes, focusing further. “You also have a smear of green, a grass stain, on one knee, and a few reddish spots on your index and thumb, just there--” Sherlock pointed at John’s hand, braced against the mud-room’s exterior doorframe. He stepped in closer, drew in a lungful of John’s scent, mingled with something new. “You came back through the garden. You smell of apples--you always smell of apples--but now you also smell of flowers, especially--” Sherlock took another loud whiff. “Roses. Explains the state of your fingers.”
“I wish someone else was around to witness you saying that. No one will ever believe me.” John chuckled, low and intimate.
“F-fuck. I--” Sherlock breaks off, pressing his face into the sheets, willing his body to slow down long enough for him to speak. “Fucking--John. Get it. Please--”
“Children, Sherlock. As they grow. Each birthday you stand them at the door frame and mark their height.”
Mrs. Hudson was a genial woman in her sixties who excelled at her job: she kept a fine tether on the chaotic house and always had polite conversation to offer when it was wanted--and occasionally when it wasn’t. Irene prized her, however, for her discretion. After several years in Irene’s employ, Mrs. Hudson had proven herself more wily and circumspect than she appeared.
that was exactly what was happening.
But Mr. Ames just laughed. “All right, don’t get your knickers twisted.”
hurt?
“--bombing the D’Angeline embassy in Washington, D.C. yesterday has claimed the lives of over five hundred people, and authorities are no closer to any leads on this tragedy. The bombing occurred at 4pm Eastern Standard Time, just before many would have left for home. The building and a nearby apartment building were demolished--”
John looked stricken, shaking his head, lifting his free hand to stop Sherlock. “Don’t--don’t say that, not if you don’t mean it. I can’t. You don’t owe me anything, so really, you don’t have to say it.”
Sherlock’s breath left him at once, and he could have dropped to his knees again, save for the way Jim held him up.
He’d found his footing there in Cassiel’s meagre wing of the Sanctuary of Elua in London. He’d found companionship and the safety of a structure he’d never imagined possible. There was the pressurised fire in his blood each morning as he went through the Telling of the Hours, the circular defense style all Cassilines were drilled in until their movements were as natural as breathing. There was blessed quiet as he meditated each night, content to contemplate Cassiel’s choice--a love so strong it rose above all other emotion, until it was pure and unassailable. The devotion he would feel for Cassiel, in giving himself limb or life for a ward.
“Nothing, just the way you said that, is all. You said you were the only one, as if it were ironic.” Something about the coffee, or the weird role reversal that had been slowly creeping upon them in their time in the U.S., galvanized John’s brain, and he felt a Sherlock-worthy deduction building in his skull. “You wouldn’t point out that kind of irony if either you were attracted to women and it was well-received, or if in fact you weren’t the only one in your group not attracted to women.”
“What if I fucked you with that little plug the way I want you to fuck me, Sherlock?” The breathless expletive, after the detached way Wilkerson had said everything else, went straight to Sherlock’s groin. “Would you like that? Nice and slow, until every muscle in your body is straining?”
Still.
“No, but thanks. I’ll stick down here by the fire where it’s nice and toasty. You’re more than welcome to sleep on the couch, or you can come share some space down here.” John’s tone was matter-of-fact, perfectly friendly, the same tone that said,
Sherlock nearly choked on his own tongue, even as a titter of amusement rose from the guests. No wonder Irene hadn’t mentioned this birthday present, had seemed far too amused earlier--
As they stepped inside, Sherlock blinked rapidly to adjust his eyes to the dim lighting, which was near-pitch after the overcast sunlight outside. The heat was stifling, and they tugged their coats and scarves off, only to find an attendant waited to receive their garments. Apparently they kept it overly warm on purpose, though to what end Sherlock wasn’t sure.
And not just them, but the others, too: it was the purity in Azza’s pride and the conviction in Camael’s sword, Shemhazai’s joy of the unknown, the wholeness in gentle Eisheth’s touch, and the absolution in Kushiel’s lash. Perhaps even the sacrifices Naamah made for Elua.
Three days before his first assignation, Sherlock found John in the kitchen, at ease for once while he made a pot of tea. He’d just finished his morning routine, the physical training taught to Cassilines to perfect their duty: John’s hair was still sweat-damp, clinging to his forehead and the nape of his neck. His skin had lost its flush, and his body moved with a certain languor Sherlock never saw in the Cassiline. The unguarded slant of his shoulders, the way the morning light streaming in from the large window haloed him in whitish overcast light was surprising--as was the genuine smile after his first sip from his mug. It was odd, seeing the person beneath the veneer of sulking Cassiline.
Mycroft ignored Sherlock, which Sherlock found infinitely annoying. Instead he plowed on. “My people have been searching for a connection, but have come up dry on every lead we can find. I need you to use whatever networks you have at your disposal. Your compliance would be handsomely rewarded--a solved case could mean your
His whole life, Sherlock had done just fine without the flirtation, camaraderie, or acceptance of his peers. He’d been safe, cocooned in the intimacy of cool logic and unchanging fact, with his lab in the garden shed and the dusty tomes nicked from his mother’s library.
Billy clears his throat. “There are are these two bullies--I mean, it may not be them--”

interested groin--against Sherlock’s thigh.
Now that was unexpected--Irene hadn’t mentioned anything about a birthday present, aside from his debut. What else was up her sleeve?
“By the burning river and the joy of discovery, I swear it. Happy, brother mine?”
“--ambassador’s daughter,” Sherlock finished. “Madeline D’Arbos.”
“I was at an impasse, wasn’t I?” John asked, the frustration seeping back through. “I was assigned a ward whose primary occupation puts him into danger on the exact night we are supposed to hold our vigil. I was forced to choose which oath was more important. Which was exactly the problem I faced in Venice when I had reason to believe Sherlock was alive, and
Wilkerson was an entirely unimpressive specimen: short and scrawny, his features pallid and unappealing. It was the first time Sherlock had ever wondered why he’d come to a patron--so far Naamah had led him to find something, something attractive about all of his partners, something fascinating to lead him down that road.
“In fact, I’m thinking about it now. All I can imagine is you, stripping those jeans off before me in our sitting room, hands roaming over those thighs, over the swell of your--rather distracting--arse.” Here he broke off, a nasal huff blowing into the recording.
When they caught their breath, and John found the temerity to extricate himself from between Sherlock and the tree, Sherlock still found himself grinning stupidly. John mirrored it right back at him, and it was possibly the best. No patron, no drug,
His eyes drifted shut, fantasies he’d conjured up before only stoked with this new reference data, and a familiar stir built in his groin. But before he indulged himself, he flipped the picture over, glanced at the back. In pen, in John’s neat scrawl, was written simply, “Your move, Sherlock.”
“They have reached their decision,” she said, no indication that her bare feet or modest robes left her susceptible to the biting cold. “I’m to take you back in.”
Sherlock broke it first. His voice was small and curiosity genuine. “Did you think your job would be easier?”
A sharp pain twinged on the cartilage of his ear. John had flicked it. And then did it again. Sherlock closed his eyes and clenched his teeth together. He rose and turned to face John, only inches apart. Close as he was, John’s breath steamed between them, clouding the laser-precision of John’s gaze meeting his unflinching.
, or head of the House, but carve his own way with a private tutor. Kushiel, or else his stubborn nature, compelled him to do his training on his own terms.
“One of the roses,” John answered, his voice even and soft, trancelike. “I know the thorns do their damage, but I don’t want you to forget about the soft petals, either. I don’t want you to be able to think of one without the other, and neither of them without me.”
Water all around, and yet John’s mouth goes dry as he nods in affirmation and extends his hand. When Sherlock glides forward to take it, John is reminded oddly of the peculiar dance between two stars before collision: eons pass as they come in closer, circling round one another, and each time they strike before the final impact it is merely in glancing blows that only set their course more surely, guaranteeing that final conflation. And so it is with John and Sherlock, entering those final moments before their lips meet, finally and for the first time in the epochs they’ve circled round another.
“That’s nice, but I still plan on being in Paris on your dime, brother mine.”
John smiled and nodded toward Sherlock’s door. “That sounds wonderful.”
“He’s a Cassiline. I’m sure he despises me,” Sherlock replied and tried to believe it was so easily black and white. Remembering Jim’s many admonishments, he added, “Daddy.”
Warmth pressed along his front, sandwiching him against Apollinaire--he opened his eyes to find Dianne staring at him intently, hands skimming his sides. She leaned in, her lips brushing his ear. Her perfume mingled with Apollinaire’s cologne and the mix was a deadly combination that fogged Sherlock’s senses until he could barely remember his own name.
The call connected, and he heard Irene’s voice on the other end. “Hello? Sherlock, what--”
Their shoes crunched along the gravel walkway as they approached the scene, lit bright as day by a host of portable flood-lamps. Yarders milled around the perimeter, a few investigators snapping photographs of the body and the nearby ground. Lestrade stood to one side, supervising as his team did their work. Beside him Sally Donovan stood, arms crossed and grim-faced.
Would any of it have mattered, in the end?
“I never thought I’d hear the great Sherlock Holmes say that one--”
When Sherlock’s mother was settled once more in her chair, Sister Roberts paced behind her desk slowly, outlining her verdict. “Sherlock is indeed an
-- Some of John's actions here might not make sense, but I'll be going into his head in the next chapter, and hopefully that will clear all that up for you.

Afterward, when Sherlock had been freed from his restraints, when he’d done all he could do to give Wilkerson the level of meticulous attention his patron craved, he found himself stretched supine on Wilkerson’s bed, settling into the sweet ache that came from a really good scene.
Prefect of the Cassiline Brotherhood, London
WHEN HE GETS home--well, back to the cottage--his finger slips as he plugs in his phone. It unlocks. His finger slips again and again until he has the screen pressed to his ear, warming against his air-chilled skin, and a familiar ring pulsing in the pitch black.
John has never been a religious man. When they had talked of it, neither he nor Mary had any intention of raising a child in church. But the image knocks him sideways all the same.
Sherlock’s stomach plummeted, and he dropped down onto his bed, staring at his phone. Someone had murdered a servant of Naamah?
The thick, blunt strike of something flexible caught Sherlock across the upper thighs. He cried out.
“Just as well. Make sure you drink plenty of water and eat good protein. Will Brother Watson--”
“We’re all packed and ready to head back to London in the morning. What’s the plan?”
Then there are other times. Times when he must employ more desperate measures.

of purposefully tempting a man of Cassiel away from his oath. I’m not Irene, after all.” Moriarty held out his hand, and Mary took it, circumnavigating John to stand by her employer’s side. “No, nothing that obvious. Mary here--does she look at all familiar?”
Once Emile had gone, Sherlock sequestered himself in the Norton family library with his violin, letting his thoughts spin out while his bow drew out the notes his fingers played of their own volition.
Interesting, that. Wilkerson had a wife, one that allowed him to eke out his less-than-vanilla tendencies upon servants of Naamah.
“Wishful thinking,” Jim growled, the nerve obviously struck. “So be it. I’ll come back for you, just as soon as I’ve toppled two empires. We’ll see what you think

your particular wiring, it might be incredibly beneficial to that massive brain of yours to make sure nothing else gets mixed up in the process.”
His mobile began buzzing again a moment later.
John’s mouth went dry and he nodded. He could only stare as Sherlock took  his hand back from John so he could peel off his t-shirt. Every new inch revealed gently-toned muscle and pale skin: a show-and-tell game with deliberate aim.
. Beside them, John was busy with his own guard, who traded out his AR for a handgun. How the guard’s shots missed them, Sherlock would never know.
, Sherlock realised. Not that it mattered.
Cecily’s, it turned out, had been her future.
Amelia and Dominique had certainly made it their home during the past month.
“I think he’s doing just fine without me,” Sherlock hissed. He wrenched his elbow free and stalked as quickly as he dared away from the sanctuary, unwilling to disturb John or anyone in a nearby alcove.
They’d been at Norton cottage for roughly a week before that realisation fully crystalised. He didn’t like the place, largely because he now owned this piece of his former mentor’s life that held no proof of

John lowered himself back to their makeshift pallet, one hand carefully holding himself up as his knee slotted between Sherlock’s. Sherlock rocked against him. The friction from only the slightest sheen of sweat making that motion smoother sent sparks along Sherlock’s spine. John’s thighs may have lost some of their tone since his injuries hampered his ability to perform his morning routine, but they had lost none of their strength. Sherlock whined at the sensation.
“With my mum tonight. We normally have a date night each week, and sometimes I enjoy a night in while he takes his own personal time.”
“John and I have just received… a care package.” Sherlock drew in a deep breath, praying he was wrong about all of this and knowing just as surely that he wasn’t. “We’ll be back in London first thing tomorrow morning. Seems we have a lot to discuss.”
and the narrow mouth of the canal, out into open water.
Ms. Adler’s gaze narrowed, skeptical. “That remains to be seen.”
Luca huffed another breath, busied himself with the small tray he’d brought, and Sherlock allowed himself just to watch.
At first.
A VERY special shout-out also needs to go to Garrett and Nate from the Starbucks by my house for hooking me up with far too much free coffee any time my internet went to shit at home. Garrett, it was always nice to take a break and talk music with you. Nate, you were hilarious, attractive, and helped form a small part of my headcanon for Victor’s appearance. Y’all will probably never read this, which is for the best. I dunno if you’d give me any more free coffee if you knew what I was getting up to while hunched over this laptop at my table.
He found himself surprised to notice the difference in scent, on his knees before Helen; it was entirely different than the musky male notes he was accustomed to, but it was somehow no less enticing. He would have to file that away for later examination.
Ames had led them to his office, turned on the one LED desk lamp tucked into the corner. Around it lay scattered all his latest sketches, drafts of various marques with doodles tucked into the margins. A cup of cold coffee, long-abandoned, sat forgotten by his printer. He dropped into his office chair, leaving Sherlock to pace and John to stand in the doorway.
Mr. Ames had led him to a private room, his public demeanor having slid back into place. "Get shirtless and stretch out for me, darling. I'll be back soon and we'll get started."
Sherlock swallowed hard, ignoring the way his eyes burned as he continued to play. He’d only just found a calm new equilibrium, a home and family, a bright future He’d only just found his place by John’s side.
“Funny,” Moriarty replied. “She remembers you. She quite fancied you when you were both younger.”
Ames nodded, grim-faced.
And it was. It
“What if I want to make you come just like this?” John asked. “You’re close, I can see that myself.”
He unlocked his desk drawer to retrieve the brown bag he’d stashed there, and then thought better of it. He needed to stretch his legs, breathe some (relatively) fresh air. He’d have a stroll over to the cafe across the street, then.
Victor pulled Sherlock to him, then, a hand splayed at the small of Sherlock's back, and kissed him until Sherlock's knees were weak, until Sherlock's interlaced fingers strained with the effort of not untangling long enough to wrap his arms around Victor. For one small moment, Sherlock found the heat, the friction that his body very much needed. When his hips brushed against Victor's thigh, need and want jolted through him.

“You’ll do brilliantly tonight, Sherlock. Are you nervous?”
Sally clenched her jaw, her eyes darting between Sherlock and her superior officer. She huffed once and turned on her heel, stalking off.
Victor stretched alongside him, nuzzling the hair behind his ear, all honey and sweetness. “Would you like to…?”
“You’ll invite me to his debut?” It wasn't so much a question as a statement of fact.
“Thank you so much for coming to me, Sherlock,” Wilkerson’s thin voice whispered against his skin. “I wasn’t sure you’d want to come. I know I’m not much to look at.”
Despite Sherlock’s training, he wasn’t one for small talk when he didn’t have to. John was neither a patron nor a socialite for him to simper to. He watched John and the other restaurant-goers in stilted, purposeful silence. John studied his menu and pretended not to notice Sherlock.
“I don’t have to worry about you,” Mary said. “I trust Brother Vincent trained you quite well. I do wonder, though, how other members in your household might fare?”
John was glad to have leave of Irene’s dinner party. Just living at
“You absolute dick--” John huffed as he sprinted alongside Sherlock. “If you get killed I will find some way to raise you from the dead--” he broke off again as they dodged a little old lady walking her dog, “--and I will murder you myself!”
“Brilliant.” Sherlock let all his frustrations, all his fear and confusion rest in that one word.
“You broke up before that conversation came up? She cheated on you.” Sherlock looked back down to his little tower, and added his fork crossways atop the spoon.
This was John,
was tense, to say the least.
There *is* one more climax to go, the chapters leading up to it and the final unravelling. We're not quite done yet. ;D
With that Jim freed him from the chain, undid his hands, led him to bed.
A pinch in the meat of his shoulder, and the world slipped away.
“Can’t say I’ve ever liked guard dogs, myself.” Moriarty’s voice came out lilting and distant, then, like he had more pressing thoughts. “If I had one I’d rip every fang from its mouth. I have no use for a bite worse than my own.”

Brother Vincent had taken him under his wing--had recognised the hardened kernel of goodness in such an angry heart. Brother Vincent had shown him the shape and the breadth of Cassiel’s devotion, had molded his anger into fuel for a desire to learn, to grow, to prosper. Had transmuted his pain into devotion, his hollow depths into a love beyond himself.
“There are many who darken my door, begging for my instruction. What sets you apart?”
“He still swears it was an accident--that their wager had gotten out of hand. Wouldn’t testimony from Bryony’s dowayne be enough to acquit him?” Irene asked.
That’s what he has chosen, isn’t it?
Sherlock stared at him for a few seconds, and then it sank in: Victor wanted to hug him in greeting. He stepped awkwardly into Victor’s reach, allowed himself to be embraced in a half-squeeze. It wasn’t that he was averse to the gesture, simply that he had no precedent for it, no experience aside from Lestrade and now Sally in dealing with a patron outside the confines of their contract--and neither of them went around hugging him.
For all that the front of the shop had been neutral colours and clean lines, Mr. Ames’s office was an exercise in chaotic eccentricity: binders of his work and other references were stuffed into the shelving behind his desk, two-deep in most places; the walls an array of designs and notes push-pinned to cork boards. His desk, surprisingly, was devoid of clutter, but from the looks of it, he’d probably done that in the ten minutes during which Sherlock and Irene had been waiting. For now, however, his laptop was closed, tucked neatly into a corner. A large, well-loved sketchbook sat on the desk between Mr. Ames’s chair and the guest chairs opposite.
His chest seized, his entire body locking down in a paroxysm of pure terror as Jim trailed it along the length of Sherlock’s cock, the curve of his bollocks, just light enough to keep from leaving so much as a scratch.
“What point is there in naming a genetic condition with some mystical religious source?” he snapped. “What good could that possibly do?”
“But why?”
What had Sherlock done or told the poor man?
“I--I choose to leave the Brotherhood.”
Sherlock had to concede the point--if there was anyone who would know about finding lethal areas of the human body with a blade, it would be his Cassiline. “
All he could do was nod, unable to pull his gaze from Lestrade’s.
“Five millimetres wide, Sherlock. Well within the limits of that gorgeous, elastic tissue in your penis. You can do this. I heard you’re so good at taking.”
Either way, his soul was forfeit in the bargain. Damned if he did, damned if he didn’t.
As if Mycroft could read his thoughts all the way back in London, he said, “You will let me know how the proceedings go?”
“Sir--Sir!” The man, a dark-skinned lad who couldn’t have been more than twenty-two, smiled and waved him over.
“Three or so weeks ago. Have you seen anything suspicious? A servant come to you crying late one night, maybe?” Sherlock prayed his memory of that conversation was wrong, that there was nothing to this wild hare he found himself chasing.
“Nevermind that. Just--
No one gave him a second glance, though. Knightsbridge--and especially here in Knight’s Court--was definitely an area where Cassilines were frequently seen with their wards. In fact, only the concierge at the front desk took notice.

“Not at all,” Jim replied. “We absolutely have no need to, do we?”
He refused to whinge in prayer. Or to dive into the release of the Telling of the Hours, for what would likely be the millionth time since he’d come here. Instead, he indulged in a fantasy he’d never let himself consider before.
“Maybe you can teach me,” John said, and even after everything, he felt himself blushing again. “Erm. More about those wicked ways, as it were.”

Sherlock used lips and tongue as he worked his way along the side of Sally’s cock, his fingers stroking the exterior of her labia, tangling in the moisture-slick curls that protected her most sensitive places.

Amelia remained silent. The quiet ricocheted around the room, punctuated by her rapid, shallow breaths. John remained steadfast, his gaze locked on her, left hand ready at the dagger in case she attempted aught else. Sherlock gave himself a moment to admire John then: D’Angeline steel framework dressed in an Englishman’s coarser features, honed sharper next to a D’Angeline flower like Amelia Chamberlain. He was a fascination.
And so it began: Victor teased his prostate mercilessly, until precome dribbled from Sherlock’s leaking cock at an embarrassing rate, each press a fresh shockwave that built and burst, each orgasm producing less and less, leaving him ever more sensitised and muscle-sore, until he was a sobbing, incoherent mass of nerves and euphoria. Until he had nothing left to give.
Sherlock swallowed convulsively, his brain grinding to a halt and refusing to budge. How long--how long had it been? An eternity? Two?
His feet thundered on the stairs as he raced back. There was no thought in his mind as he pelted down the maze of hallways that led back to the ballroom. When he reached the last little turn and stopped short before the door, Sally stepped aside, startled.

John could think of Sherlock’s behavior the way he did Harry’s. It was useless getting angry at a mule for being a mule, after all. It wasn’t worth the effort. It would allow John could move forward, at least. As long as Sherlock didn’t endanger himself or others, John could learn to let go of the notion he had to find devotion to his ward. Devotion to Cassiel would have to suffice.
Sherlock’s ears rang and his knees went liquid. For the first time in his life, his brain couldn’t keep up. “I--what??”
“Very much, yes.”
Fuck, this was hard to write. Hard enough that I'm still shaky and I haven't even run it past a beta yet, because I don't want to lose my nerve posting it. I know I've said and said it and said it, but I swear to you, there will be a happy ending. Please just hang in there. It's going to be okay just as soon as I can make it.
Sherlock studied him. John was tired of it--the x-ray observations, the constant need to school his body language into passivity, neutrality. He hated being on-guard every waking moment.
Sherlock frowned, and tried to lock away his dismay at having missed a chance to offer himself to Jim. “How so?”
“I--I want to apologise,” Brother Vincent said eventually. His deep voice was small in the meagre light. “You asked me, back when this all began, if I was going to throw you under the bus. Do you remember that?”
“Git,” John had chuckled.
Three years passed. His father succumbed, but Frédérique still sent what money he could to his
“I have.”
When that, too, cooled, John started at Sherlock’s shoulder, scraping and peeling the thin layer of cold wax with blunt nails. The scratch on the over-sensitive skin was its own brand of delightful, and Sherlock relaxed into it. The sensation of it peeling up was almost ticklish, John’s fingertips warm and light. John worked his way down from shoulder, along spine, over arse and thigh. When he’d removed the all the wax, Sherlock breathed deep, prepared for another round, but instead a feather-light touch, foreign in texture, trailed along the still-reddened skin.
That night, in the safe cocoon of their bed, John asked him about the weals and cuts, and Sherlock told him. They talked for a long time, about what the experience had been like, what Sherlock felt now… and the whole thing, on every level, was so bizarrely novel to Sherlock. He had never,
Was he acting on lust, or on Elua’s precept to honour love before all else?
Irene raised an eyebrow at him, at once sardonic and sweet. “Typically they come from the ground.”
“Quite the miracle in this day and age, isn’t it?” Sherlock replied. “But that seems to have changed.”
# # # # #
There in the kitchen’s centre stood the blonde woman, Jim’s attendant, clad in black, a black toboggan pulled up to reveal her face, her gun--
John’s eyebrows shot up. He was about to offer an enthusiastic disagreement when Sherlock’s phone chirped in his pocket.
Oh god, I have wanted this exact chapter since the very beginning. I am so excited to post it I couldn't wait for beta. It'll likely happen over the next few days, but it'll all be tiny things like word choice and whatnot. This is it, this is fucking it.
The flowers, the revelation--these were both gifts from Elua. A demonstration, since he’d offered himself.
Liliane snorted and gave him the same sort of look Sherlock did when he was being especially dense. “He had brothers, you know. You miss the point. Cassiel’s Choice means to follow your heart and your ward rather than your superiors.”
Sherlock nodded. The idea of entertaining complete strangers of Ms. Adler’s choosing was at once terrifying and thrilling in a way it never had been before, in a way he would have never guessed at when the idea was first mentioned to him in Sister Roberts's office all those years ago. Even still, it seemed odd that Ms. Adler would send her former patrons his way, if they were the type to receive punishments rather than dole them out. He pushed the thought away, determined to focus on it more later.
At the end of that hour, Sherlock heard John begin to stir in his periphery. After another minute, John entered the kitchen and began puttering around. Sherlock sensed his goal was to blatantly irritate Sherlock, from the way he inspected the fridge to clattering crockery in the cabinets, to sweeping
“Use your hand to steady me,” Lestrade murmured, and as Sherlock wrapped a hand around the base of him, he continued, “that’s it. Now, again.”
to the light, examining its pristine gleam. “You are a rare and beautiful blessing sent to me. Our master Kushiel approves of my mission, and you are proof. He’s matched us. Just imagine what we can do together, here and out in the world.”
As soon as they could, the five of them ducked into a narrow alley, struggling to catch their breath. Felippa whipped out her mobile, thumbing the contact as it came up to her face.
Her mouth settled into a grim line, desperate determination gripping her. “I have to.”
But John?
He knew, on a theoretical level, the sort of image he cut: patrons would find him attractive, despite how his personality might repel them. And the ones who knew of Sherlock’s nature would pay handsomely for the chance to beat the sweetness into him.
“I don’t know,” John admitted, and took a long sip at the Scotch. The warmth of it settled comfortably in his stomach.
Sherlock turned, drew in a breath to explain with a raised hand, and froze. God
“Not surprised to see
He repeated it right until he heard the rhythmic sound of skin against skin, little gasps and sighs as loud as if he were in the room with them.
At first the distant noise of the sea, a constant violent roar on the rocks below, had been a break in the monotony. It quickly became the elusive cacophony his languishing brain latched onto, multiplied until it carried the moaning wind like the sound of some weak, ancient goddess wailing.
The blush of arousal blanched, her mouth caught in a worried downturn. “I’m--I’m getting it now. Thank you, Mal.” Helen rose as footsteps receded from the door, snatching her mobile from her trouser pocket. A few taps later, and her expression shuttered, the mood now completely broken.
John turned back to Sherlock, to find that his friend had gone wide-eyed and was grinning from ear to ear. His own heart had started racing for an altogether different reason now, and as the adrenaline flooded his system he let loose a small, manic giggle.
“John!”
As ever, thank you so much for staying on the ride so far. Comments and kudos give me life, and I am shameless enough to ask for moar. :D
John wasn’t stupid. He
.” He circled once around John, taking in his measure. “You wear your heart on your sleeve, and it’s not for Cassiel, is it? You can tell yourself that all you like, but it’s not Cassiel that keeps you up at night, that makes it
He was barrelling down another corridor when he heard shouting coming from what must’ve been in the lobby. The drums pounded in his ears once more.
Sherlock moaned a little helplessly, arching his spine to follow the rose’s path, his body aching and hungry for more: more sensation, more heat or pressure, anything. But this was another way in which his Cassiline was a bloody genius: John knew that denial was just another way to inflict a delicate sort of pain to drive Sherlock right round the bend.
Sherlock shuddered. He stood before anyone else even reacted to the message, though the guard lurched up, grabbed him by the arm, misinterpreting the movement as an attempt to flee.
Edges blurred, daggers singing as they sliced through the raindrops.
His is a slow solo waltz, where the only spin is in his head as he moves closer to his destination, the small all-night store at the far end of town.
His strangled cry escaped as John felt the hot splash of semen on his stomach and chest.
John didn’t move.
“Happy to oblige,” Sherlock replied, and used his free hand to pull John’s hand down to where they were joined. He let go long enough to wrap John’s hand around their cocks before covering it again with his hand. “Together.”
He looked up to realise he’d been glaring at the granite, that she stood directly opposite him at the island, hands braced wide on the worktop.
“So you admit to the questionable murders of the guards on La Poveglia, allowing your ward to murder a former Cassiline adept, and trading damning emails of your inappropriate relationship with your ward?”
He then got onto other business and came out a few minutes later feeling a bit more awake and a bit more bored.
This was Sherlock’s mess to clean up, but John, being the bright knight in armor he was, felt the need to do it himself instead of dragging a consulting detective to it. Armed with a sponge and paper John started cleaning it. Sherlock walked into the kitchen the same moment John remembered he probably needed gloves to clean whatever this was.
A day wasn’t a day to Sherlock if he didn’t experiment at all. So after finishing the precarious breakfast John had given him, he entered the kitchen and checked the experiment he had left alone the last three days to catch the killer.
For now Watsinvwas certain he liked this world better than his own; for starters he would have married Sherlock in this one.
----- o0o -----
John woke up early, around 6:30. Yesterday he had ran his arse off following Sherlock around London. When he woke up he felt tired and his muscles ached.  He sat up slowly, taking mind of his right shoulder that felt even worse than the rest of his muscles because of the bullet that had left him a few years ago with a horrible scar
“Okay then, do you have any questions about my ‘Death’?” He asked. John gasped and took a minute after answering “Yes, I do. Why?” He said. Sherlock nodded he was already waiting for that question “Well, They were tree snipers, one for you” He said pointing John “One for Lestrade.” He said lifting another finger. “And one for Mrs. Hudson” he said lifting another finger. John eyes wandered through the three fingers. “Oh…So you find the easier way was to fake your death. You could have told me, you know?” John snapped. “I could, but you would be dead by now.” John mind went through the last three years. Three and counting. He thought. “Do /you/ want to know anything?”
The steam coming woke him from his daydream. He hurried up to take the rest of his clothes of and walked inside the shower. He showered quickly, not wanting to leave Sherlock without hot water.
At the mention of Mycroft John did recognize him. With some tears streaming down his face he hugged Sherlock. “I knew you would realize.” Sherlock said. John cupped Sherlock’s face and hesitated before closing the gap between his faces. Sherlock broke the kiss at the first seconds, doing the exact thing John was worried about.
After some minutes (Or maybe more, time goes fast when you’re broken) he heard the flat door open.  “John?” Sherlock shouted, He went running to the room upstairs but it was empty. He took a moment to see how messy the room was, Clothes all over the floor, dirty mugs on the table by the bed and a horrible smell. Sherlock went down the stairs he passed a hand through his face and hair.My room! . Sherlock thought and walked. He stood by the  door listening carefully.
Sherlock woke up a Friday after not having slept for four days. They had finished an extremely fun case, though for John it was just a really dangerous one, last night and he had broken down after the high of actually catching the serial killer.
“Would you… Could you tell me how that happened?” Watson mumbled the answer, not sure if was okay for him to ask.
“John, wait!” He shouted, but it was too late.John eyes had already fallen close and he was falling to the floor in what to the genius felt like slow motion.
Then man on the floor couldn’t either. As if they had arranged it before, both men pointed at their chest before pointing at each other's. The man from the floor sat up and quickly and grabbed onto the table as he rose.
The room suddenly turned grey for John. All he saw was Sherlock’s face glowing from the fire that was slowly fading. John was dumbfounded by his beauty. He always had been but there was something about the red flames that night that brightened his features. He stood there, positioned between an “I do” and the door. Although he recognized the courage it took for Sherlock to finally reveal this to him, he felt the need to run away but his legs were locked at the knees. He stood silent.
"I love you, more", Sherlock breathed.
Friday comes along and this is the one day of the week that Sherlock doesn't love. It's the one day that he never sees John because he's working at the hospital. Sherlock hates going a whole day without John because it makes him sick. Physically sick. That's why he doesn't mind when he starts to doze off.
John and Sherlock looked at each other, determined not to give in.
Sherlock placed his hands up against his lips and stared down at the floor by his feet. While Mrs. Hudson and John let out the occasional snickers, he thought intently.
John said, "I love you", and continued giving him soft kisses.
"I didn't believe it until I saw it for myself. Perhaps I should contact him and ask him to introduce himself? That way you can see his powers for yourselves." Mycroft didn't wait for an answer and he took out his mobile from the jacket pocket.
“So someone from that other House--” Lestrade started.
John’s phone chimed from his nightstand, and he glanced back toward it before locking horns with Sherlock.
John prayed then that whatever was happening in the ballroom, nothing had happened quite yet. If all hell broke loose before John could get back and do his duty, he’d never forgive himself. Neither would Cassiel, if there was anything left worth forgiving.
John shifted again, and Sherlock felt the soft scratch of John’s early stubble between his shoulderblades, right at the point of the arrow on his
Sherlock didn’t have the heart to flee, not anymore.
But then Victor’s hand at the base of his spine, hot as a brand, heavy as an anchor, lifted Sherlock from that daydream, centering him once more in the present.
“Silenzioso!” Luca barked, and a fraction of a second later, static from a walkie-talkie  crackled. His voice was hard as he said,
The corner of John’s mouth twitches in a smug grin, and he swats at Sherlock’s arse again. “Slow down, princess. You’ll get this cock, don’t worry.”
“Hurry up,” Sherlock pleads. His fingers are knotted in the sheets now, his whole body impatient.
Sherlock opened his eyes and barely managed to ask, “Do you love me?” There was a dark cloud forming over the sky that was within his eyes. The sweat on his hands had dried from the cold his fists had created and he buried them in his pockets. He felt eternity go by in those few seconds of silence and he thought to himself, “What have I done?” He started to feel ill.
Sherlock started adjusting his shirt and said, "We're only half an hour away. I'll text my mother. I'm sure she'd be delighted to come get us. As soon as the rain dies down, they can-"
Time went by and neither of them uttered a word. The only sound was that of the fire snapping.
Sherlock was confused. "So, in fact, you mean to say that our sister was..."
No matter how tired he is, John is always up for a bubble bath. The water should be warm but it's always cool for some reason.
"Dear brother, you've really lost it this time", Sherlock had tears coming out of his eyes. "I cant... Oh, I can't wait to tell this story at Christmas." He jumped up, bringing his legs up behind him as he did. He then wiped his wet eyes. "For once, I'm anxious for it. Father will surely appreciate this. Mother will definitely disown you, though." He and John couldn't stop their teasing.
He loved Mrs. Holmes. She had showered him with love ever since they announced their engagement a month ago. She had been so thrilled that day that she spilled her tea on the dining table.
However, instead of an "I told ya so" he heard Sherlock say in a sing song tone, "Well, well, well. I couldn't be more pleased. It's a good thing you're into buckets."
Sherlock spoke as he removed a long stemmed yellow flower from the bouquet, "I'll tell you the same thing I told you yesterday when I came home with the milk you did not ask me to get." He pinched half of the stem with his fingers then wrapped it around John's right ear. "I am a man in love and I am figuring out different ways to show it." He smiled brightly at him, loving how delicate John's face appeared.
John rushed to him and as he took ahold of his arm, a tall figure popped out from the other side of the ring. The man crashed into John and they both fell to the floor. He had knocked the wind out of him and now he laid over John with his face over his, chest to chest. He had him pinned to the ground.
Mycroft finished his sentence. "Not the sharpest tool in the shed, as they say. She excelled in physics and astronomy but she could not comprehend smaller, more logical things. She couldn't tell the difference between a massive beast and herself, for instance. Obvious, isn't it? Mother had consulted with a doctor but shortly after, some days later, we found her playing with matches and threatening to set us all on fire. It became more serious. Finally, they had no choice but to send her away to get the proper help. She never got better, therefore, she remained there until she reached 25 years of age. That's when a fire broke out in the clinic. Ironically, her roommate had started the fire, not her. She, along with many others, did not make it out alive."
the superhero." Mycroft said with hope.
Sherlock looked over at him but was too interested in the photo he had in his hand to pay attention to another.
Sherlock’s mouth was dry. There was no use in swallowing again but he tried, nevertheless. He wandered closer to the window, his hands folded up against his lips. He could see his reflection. He stared at the man in front of him and thought, “What have I become? When?” His thoughts forced him to react and he looked back at John. He told himself “Be a man! Tell him!” He hadn’t realized just how strongly he had been gritting his teeth until he tried to open his mouth to speak again.
John loved to feel Sherlock's long, slender fingers between his short, brawny ones. It always made him feel the same way he felt when they first held hands in the movie theatre almost two years ago: like an idiot in love.
Mycroft ended the call and placed his mobile back in his pocket. He had a grand smile across his face and he looked around the room proudly showing it off.
Sherlock brushed his ear and removed the flower he had placed there earlier. He smirked as he spun it between his fingers.
“What did you say?”, John asked, wondering if he had heard correctly. He glared at Sherlock, trying to read his mind.
Mycroft had had enough of their flirtation. "Alright. Enough! I'll sit but please stop before I regurgitate." He was obviously grumpy because he had to sit in the client chair but it was their playful eye ogling that really bothered the Iceman.
"Myc? Are you there?", asked the strong voice. He sounded like a full-blooded American man. His voice was deep and there was something very familiar about it but nobody could put their finger on it. Or if they knew, no one dared to say it out loud because maybe they couldn't believe it just yet.
"This ordeal has made me realize that life is precious.” Sherlock no longer felt the punches. He didn’t feel anything but his hands soaked in sweat. “I must say this. I…” He waited for John to look back at him. He drew in what he felt was his last breath and said, “I love you. I am in love with you, John. Let me be clear so that there is no misunderstanding this time. I love you as a man. I want to be with you… always. I need you and I know you need me, too. I would like to think that I’m not wrong in believing this but I beg of you to please reassure me.” He closed his eyes and with his arms down near him he made two strong fists that turned his knuckles a soft yellow.
John does two shifts and by the time he comes home, Sherlock is asleep. He tries to stay up and wait for him but no matter how hard he fights it, sleep always wins. Sherlock loves this kind of sleep though because it's the only way he's able to stop thinking about the pain. That and if he manages to stay asleep throughout the night, the next day comes sooner.
Sherlock kept tiny packets of baby wipes in the glove compartment and now he could add another reason as to why to the list.
It was all good timing for the rain started gushing down. The sky made a low rumbling sound and the rain got heavier by the minute. Soon after, the grey clouds above united and hid whatever light remained from the sun that was now creeping down behind the mountains.
He gasped as John bit his neck.
After a moment, Sherlock turned his whole body to face it and he stood up straight. He lowered his jaw and maintained his eyes wide open to take it all in. He had seen plenty of explosions and fires up close. They usually occurred when his experiments had gone wrong. This was unlike anything he'd ever seen.
Sherlock sat up straight in his chair. He licked his lips and then slowly asked, "Eurus is our brother?"
John blushed at the thought of himself with a flower around his ear. He imagined he looked silly but he left it there. He stared into Sherlock's doe eyes and stepped in closer to kiss him softly.
Mycroft looked at Sherlock then at John and back at Sherlock. "Fine. You caught me." Mycroft stood up and walked over to the couch behind him to lie down.
"Mycroft, we don't have time for this." John was clearly annoyed. "Tell us the truth or come back another day because this is getting ridiculous." He scoffed and crossed his arms holding both of his elbows now.
Sherlock stood by the fireplace. He stared at his older brother from the corner of his eye and realized that Mycroft was not joking. He found it hilarious that he thought a superhero could exist. He also knew his brother far too well to know that he wouldn't prolong such nonsense. Sherlock smacked his lips and waited to see how far he would take this.
John looked up at him. There they were, synchronizing their breathing and movements. They gazed into each other's eyes and smiled.
The white light turned into an atomic orange. The colors were vibrant but became more relaxed once they began to expand outward forming a circle. It was like a ring of fire. They could feel some heat radiating from it but it wasn't enough to alarm them. What agitated them a little were the sparks that flew from it but they didn't harm them either.
Mycroft brought his phone down and switched it to speaker so they could all witness the phone call.
"Already texted them. My father is on his way. We're about half an hour away although he does tend to drive way below the speed limit so I say we have another forty, maybe forty-five minutes, depending on which car he brings.
Sherlock usually never eats breakfast but Sundays are different. He wakes up in a playful mood and with quite an appetite. He spreads extra butter on top and drenches his toast in syrup because every bite must be equally sweet.
He loves it when John goes to the salsa bar to get lemon wedges because he always manages to drop one on the floor. Sherlock lives for this moment. He loves watching John bend down to pick it up. He would do anything to see John's sweet ass. That's why he always asks for more lemon slices even though he never uses them all. Sherlock loves the way his jeans hug his muscular thighs.
Mrs. Hudson had walked over to the kitchen to make tea. She said from there, "You've really done it this time, young man."
John didn't let him finish his sentence. He was already shoving his tongue in his mouth and positioning himself on Sherlock's lap. Even though he knew he was shorter, he was careful not to bump his head.
"Oi!" John cried out. It didn't really hurt him as much as shock him. He laughed it off and continued kissing his lover.
He thought to himself.
Sherlock is not a fan of horror films because they're ridiculously fake. He does, however, love having an excuse to bury his face deep into John's neck. In the background, there are long faces screaming with fear but it might as well be nonexistent because Sherlock only experiences a sense of tranquility. He loves placing his nose and lips up against the soft part of John's neck because that's when he feels completely protected. It's like being in a bubble made of tungsten. When Sherlock is with John, he is safe. His arms are a sheild against the world's barbarity.
John replied just as sweetly, "I promise. And don't worry, we'll be here for the dinner party next month." He saw a small look of surprise across her face. "Ah, yes. Sorry. He figured it out earlier. You did leave the list of guests on the coffee table, though."
"Mm, yes, that's true. But then again we had never done it in a vehicle. Besides, you said it differently this time. It was...less aggressive." Sherlock winked at him.
Meanwhile, Sherlock was removing his coat. He placed it over the dashboard.
Mycroft cleared his throat and continued. "It wasn't so much that she was interested in human anatomy. I, myself, had began an essay on it when I was her age. The issue was that she was trying to find out how the human body worked by...cutting open her stuffed elephant."
They were only thirty minutes into their ride home when Sherlock shouted, "Stop the car!"
"Patience, brother mine. Patience." Mycroft continued on reminiscing about their childhood.
Sherlock looked straight into his brother's eyes thinking he had gone mad. At first, he appeared to be unsettled with this information but then he noticed Mycroft actually believed this was true. Though as much as he tried, he couldn't contain his amusement.
"Stephen. Hello, brother. How's the sorcery coming along? Have you had any other issues with Kaecilius?" Mycroft continued on before allowing the man to give him a proper answer. "Which Sanctum Sanctorum structure is it tonight? New York or Hong Kong?" He asked playfully and as if he were talking to someone he spoke with quite often.
Victor inclined his head ever-so-slightly, eyebrows slightly raised, expression confused and hopeful. His eyes flickered up and down Sherlock, properly taking him in. “Man of many talents. Thank you, if you were one of the ones to help me so far. What can I do to retain your services?”
(See the end of the chapter for
Sherlock’s breath caught in his throat, the term snagging something in memory--
come from something significant, which means something impressed early on. So, childhood. A preoccupation with pirates?” His words were at once lazy and barbed, a lion circling its prey.
"I am, Mr. Holmes. I'm sure you can appreciate the honour, and the work I've been shifting aside to make time for your design."
. Sherlock recognised it as the masculine form of that word from the Ysandrine Cycle. “You have been chosen by Kushiel, but for what purpose I do not know. Have you heard of Phèdre nó Delaunay, of Iriel de Fiscarde, or Mara?”
Having heard the entire exchange, John didn’t so much as flinch when she landed the punch.

, that textbook every servant of Naamah knew by heart before they debuted. Excitement thrilled in his blood. He forced himself to take a seat on the couch and give it a leisurely thumbing-through.
For all that, John couldn’t figure out where to focus, not exactly. The sensation felt--well, fucking amazing--but John wasn’t sure if he should focus about how good he felt, or if he was supposed to be simultaneously finding some way to make Sherlock feel like this, or if that would be rude, since he wouldn’t be paying as much attention as he should be--
But it didn’t end there. No, by the time he lost count of the turns that had been taken, the offerings from the guests splattered his back, his face, his arse in stripes and smears; he’d been wrung dry. His whole body sagged limp and tender, overstimulated and blissfully aching.
to endure pain. They whimper like dogs, cringing away from it, only for the sweetness after.” He placed the glasses on a table, and truly invaded Sherlock’s space. His breath puffed against Sherlock’s lips, peppermint. “You embrace pain. You beg for more no matter how much you fear it. All your other patrons may want to explore the former, but it’s the latter that
And just like that, Sherlock would be a fully-fledged servant of Naamah, a master of his art.
Stillness grew in his heart, steady as the sapling that had sprung from Anael’s acorn. Elua himself had pressed it into the clay, once-upon-a-time.
Irene turned a coy smile on him, clearly evasive. “I didn’t take you on as an adept to question me, did I?”
A thunderous knock sounded on the metal door, then a slot slid open near the floor, a tray with a covered dish slid through.
“Just because I like getting beaten occasionally doesn’t mean I can’t defend myself.”
Sherlock dropped his gaze to the plush carpeting as he crossed the room to stand in its centre. Victor straightened, came close enough to circle round him, until Sherlock could feel his heat like an electrostatic charge.
He continued, “Also, you resent of Lestrade’s willingness to bend the rules and any belief in the talents which claim I to have. So I, presenting as a cisgendered white male, represent everyone you’ve had to prove yourself superior to in order to have the position you hold. That goes deeper than you may realise: you’re torn between femininity and masculinity in a job where embracing either means sacrificing half of who you are. You showed me
“What is it?” she snapped as she stepped over his legs to straddle him.
Sherlock did as ordered, shifting to kneel, lacing his fingers behind his head.
The only proper retort Sherlock felt forthcoming was one that succinctly summed up his frustration in a way John would appreciate: an emphatic two-finger salute as he glared at John.
“Well, the more pressing of the two involves your schedule while you’re in Paris, I’m afraid.”
Sherlock did, and was rewarded with another splash of the hot wax, winding from his sacrum, along one arsecheek, down to the crease where arse met hamstring. Beads of it rolled down toward the centre, dangerously close to far more sensitive areas, and the noises Sherlock made… well. He hoped the sheep wouldn’t be too scandalised.
Sherlock shrugs. “I could teach you a thing or two about deductive reasoning,” he teases.
Sherlock grinned at that. “Unlikely, when I have a working relationship with Scotland Yard and you’ve got the name of a murderess hidden under your pillow.”
She huffed a sigh. “Sherlock, I came out to talk to you about--” She smiled, tight and lopsided, unsure how to proceed.
Inside, he found Victor Trevor seated at a desk in a cozy study. As Sherlock recalled, Victor’s face was all hard angles and arrogance, the product of fine breeding and privilege. Brassy blonde hair swooped to one side, the beginnings of a light brunet beard softening his jawline. From where Sherlock stood, the only thing he could tell Victor wore was a dark blue silk robe, which framed the muscled stretch of exposed neck and chest in a navy vee. For a first patron, he cut a very agreeable figure.
“Are you Mr. Holmes?” the young man asked. When Sherlock assented, the courier had him sign off, and handed him a smallish box.
, or tattoo that fulfilled their financial ties to their House.
“It’d be best if you just move along,” John said, his voice mild in warning.
Sherlock heard the plastic snap of what he instantly recognised as a cap
Sherlock turned to see John enter, his face haggard and his eyes red-rimmed from a night of meditation. As physically demanding as Sherlock’s night had been, he couldn’t imagine performing Elua’s Vigil. It was an exercise in pointless austerity.
Sherlock swallowed thickly--John had turned that look on him quite a few times, and it had always left him somewhat lightheaded.
“Shhhh.” Jim stepped away, retreated to the cabinet inset in the wall, his eyes never leaving Sherlock’s. “I will spoil you
Sherlock worked up the muster to prop himself on his elbow, to drag a hand through his tangled curls. He gave the question consideration before he put voice to his thoughts. “For Naamah…” he thought of the poppy left beside him on the table some months before, of his wish to escort Jim to a Midwinter Masque. “For Naamah, make a gift to her temple in my name.” He felt a smile curl at his lips, his demeanor at once slipping into the genuine grooves of a servant of Naamah. “For me? I will remember each moment of this assignation for as long as I live. That will be enough.”

John shakes his head to clear his thoughts, turns the flask up.
Sherlock trembled as he knelt, wrists bound in leather thongs to the rough wooden post at the altar. The priests of Kushiel’s temple had led him already through the ritual bath, the simple prayer. All that stood between himself and peace of mind now was the space between his skin and the flog. The anticipation was the worst of it; he knew he was here to seek atonement. It was nothing he had been able to say aloud, nothing he’d even been able to formulate in his own mind, the guilt he carried, until Sister Roberts had given him the suggestion. It was true, though. He did carry guilt, and whether he was really to blame for any of it was tucked in a logic he couldn’t access, not yet, not for the weight he carried.
The foyer John had been sequestered to was little more than a 5x5 anteroom that buffered the flat from the hallway beyond. Ventilation in the small space was terrible, which meant it was stifling hot despite the air conditioning that cooled the rest of the building in the oppressive summer heat.
The sound of it hollows him out, even all the glass he’s swallowed since January.
Moriarty’s voice was so smug it took monumental effort not to grab him by the hair and make a regrettable meeting between his face and the alcove wall. John swooped with another tight bow, his movements stiff with cold and anger.
.” Moriarty’s singsong trailed off as he jerked his wrist free, turned, and sauntered down the hallway. Rather than heading for the main staircase, though, he went down the back stairway into the kitchen.
John raked a hand through his short-cropped hair, his nostrils flaring. “And now you’ll throw me under the bus, just the same?”
“Sherlock, what happened to your head?” John leaned closer, looking startled.
John fought to keep his hands from twitching toward his daggers. Elua’s
“You were called to--to rent yourself out for favors?”
Emile shrugged. “I don’t know. I’ve never heard anyone else talk about it. I thought my grandmother was telling me crazy things. Never gave it a second thought, ‘til I saw your eyes, William nó Jasmine.” He grinned as he said cited their little in-joke.
Molly does that
“I need to know where Amelia’s staying while she’s in London.”
“You--”
“I don’t--” John sputtered. “Emails?”
Against his better judgement he sat up, immediately turning to the nightstand for his mobile. Where it should’ve sat was nothing but empty space. He must’ve left it in his trouser pocket, then.
John shifted his weight closer, until the back of his hand brushed Sherlock’s, whose fingers, still warm from that last cup of coffee, curled around his. John allowed himself a small smile before he answered. “It’s all fine. I think I actually enjoyed The Waffle House.”
“I believe there may be a connection between the Embassy bombings and your Mr. Moriarty.”
The scent of apples; a scion of Anael.
“So they know each other,” Sherlock said. “If there’s no other connection, him giving her this sort of--present makes no sense. She’s Camellia House, besides. What would she want, playing Mandrake to my Valerian?”
Sherlock blinked rapidly, deciding on a white lie parsed with truth. It wouldn’t do for the ‘Yard to distrust Jim, just because he’d suspected Amelia and handed her to Sherlock on a silver platter. But before he could hit send, Sherlock paused, thumb hovering over the reciprocal ‘x’ at the end of his reply. A kiss. Sentimentality. It had won Victor’s freedom and Sally’s trust.
John panicked for a moment--here alone he was stripped of his role, the facade of the guard on duty who would remain silent and watchful. The last person in the entire assembled group he wanted to speak to was Moriarty.
The following day they’d promised to help Mrs. Hudson move her furniture around to rearrange her sitting room, and Sherlock found himself scooting end tables and biting back scathing advice on how to best facilitate movement and comfort within the space, but mainly he found himself watching John.
It was a hateful gut punch. John blinked rapidly, his vision blurring, the air escaping in a rush until he couldn’t breathe. The solace he’d found and been held in for ten years--gone.
“It’s Naamah’s blessing. I can taste it on you.”
Two days later found Sherlock poring over a tome of Latin poetry in the library, curled by the fireplace. Rain spattered against the windows, freezing and desolate. Only the crackle of the fire and the weight of a soft old quilt kept the dreariness at bay.
John’s eyes flashed as he glanced to Felippa, his jaw set in stone. “Lorenzo, take us there.”
“Time to go!” he whispered, and they both kicked off, racing for the shore. They didn’t dare look back; John was absolutely certain he’d see Pritchard loading up his gun, snapping the barrel and the action back together and taking aim.
much worse for you--but only a little bit longer, if you’re well behaved tonight.”
“I thought maybe you’d both drowned!” Mrs. Hudson teased them as they trudged back into the mudroom.
THE ROAR OF an engine wakes him the following dawn, unlike any other morning since he’s come. He does not have to look out the window or check his phone. He knows.
Sherlock’s heart was in his throat now, this opening going unlike any scenario he’d imagined. He had no idea what to anticipate, unsure what was expected of him from this line of questioning. This was not one of the typical scenarios outlined in
He couldn’t help remember the last thing she’d said to him during the D’Arbos case, a jab in a stolen moment while Lestrade had ducked from the office for a moment.
Sherlock rolls his eyes. Was
Nearby, Molly is unable to breathe. Or do much of anything other than drink it in.
The room in which he convalesced quickly became a cell as oppressive as any in Pentonville. The drab walls offered no new clues, no secrets about the history of the room that Sherlock hadn’t already deduced a hundred times over, and the longer he sat, the longer the silence set in, the louder the ringing in his ears grew.
Sherlock gave her a pointed look, and she rolled her eyes.
For most servants of Naamah, especially in the Houses, this use of their art would have been completely below them. Dancing for money, trading on bawdy, heavy-handed titillation--this was the work of a common stripper, an un-trained prostitute. It would have never been a contract request to be honoured. The sensual dances taught to Naamah’s servants were for the seduction of a single patron, or the dance between two servants in a Jasmine House Viewing--the exhibitionist display put on in the Houses for those patrons whose bent ran more along voyeuristic lines than proper participation.
Just like the idea that anyone would bother with him--but that’s a thought just true enough he must push it away before it knocks him out. It will not take much, even now, for him to fall apart.
“The other is a matter of your assets, which were frozen and seized upon the discovery that--”

He ignored it and turned back to his former patron. “We don’t have time for this, Victor. Now, who is Lorraine Carver?”
A few short hours later John woke from a dreamless sleep, deep and hard, to find the sun shone down on him. In the scant sunlight twin anemones had bloomed, brilliant scarlet against the black soil, just beside his outstretched hand.
“Much appreciated,” Sherlock said instead.
the scene...”
John dialed the number for him, handed the receiver over. The only ring droned twice.
Sherlock snickered but offered no reply, merely kept pace with him as they meandered across the parking lot toward the rising sun.
“The records,” Sherlock growled. “I need to check that dossier.”
Well, I added
God, but Sherlock doesn’t want to say it. It’s odd, it’s embarrassing. Sherlock only barely musters his voice, and that mainly because he very desperately needs John to keep fucking him. It was almost like John knew he was getting close, and did this on purpose.
Sherlock clenched his jaw, pushed the plate away. “Obviously, Sister Roberts. I’m not a complete imbecile.”
Something jarred; his knees hitting the ground. Jim caught him by the shoulders before he pitched forward, slapped his cheek hard.
telling. Something too beloved to lose. What else falls in that category? Who else?”
Luckily Liu and Hwei-ru appeared through the crowd again and ushered them back to the reserved section of the restaurant.
Sherlock’s voice echoed, dripping derision.
that John’s abhorrence, back then.
Sherlock suppressed the twin urges to completely avoid her and single her out to goad her further--since the very beginning, Sally had been vocal about Sherlock’s involvement in cases. On one level Sherlock didn’t blame her--his presence
Rather irrationally, Sherlock wondered what John would look like if he’d found himself somehow shirtless in a hand-to-hand fight: no tame button-down to hide the functional vambraces that shielded his arms, daggers in hand, the grim light of battle shining in those stupidly blue eyes. The matte-black SIG would still be holstered at his side--that didn’t come out until a Cassiline intended to kill.
“Yes. She pricked me with a pin when I was fifteen, only to watch my reaction. I’m sure you can imagine.” Sherlock ignored the memory of that particularly fateful day, the anger and uncertainty, the humiliation of exposing a part of himself he hadn’t even known had existed. His voice cracked on the next bit, though. “Feel free to test it yourself.”
“No, I--”
SHERLOCK JOINS HIM in the garden these days. Together they silently consider the bees that have crept out of their dormancy, just like the summer that has stolen in as slowly as a flower unfurling. Sometimes John wonders, a play on an old memory, if Sherlock would ever be tempted count all the blades of grass--it is really unimaginable that anyone would bother.
In two weeks, Sherlock hadn’t moved the file from where it had fallen to hide beneath his bed, a failure swept out of sight. Flopping onto the floor to crawl under the bed and retrieve it was undignified, but there was nothing for it.
, though after tonight anyone who mattered in London’s D’Angeline society would certainly hear tell.
“You didn’t disappoint, pet.”
Sherlock nodded once, pushed to his feet. When he spoke, his voice creaked from strain and disuse. He ignored the ache in his chest, which hurt worse than his body by far.
“In this whole house--everything is perfect. Except this. Why wasn’t this damage repaired?”
Frédérique’s eyes shuttered, his expression haunted. “
It ripped open scars he thought long-closed: the years following his parents’ death, when he wanted nothing more than to train as a Cassiline just to find the drunk driver whose car had careened headlong into his parents’.
But the warmth in his blood was Elua’s, the first of The Misguided, and he knew it was this god’s smiling face he must turn away from to do what needed doing.
), and as such consent is granted. And Victor does check in with him, and provides aftercare, but during the scene itself a-cumberbatch-of-cookies originally had some issues about full consent vs Sherlock only wanting to go through with it because of the contract... I have endeavored to rewrite and make his enjoyment more clear, but just in case I did want to give you a heads-up.
“Time’s up,” she announced cheerfully.
In his head, John could hear Brother Vincent reciting from
Then Dianne appeared, holding a few warm, wet flannels. She handed one to Apollinare as the latter lowered Sherlock onto his own two feet. As well-used as Sherlock was, his legs wobbled like a newborn colt. Then they set to, wiping him clean, drying him just as quickly. Apollinaire hummed and Dianne sang under her breath, twin melodies winding together like a lullabye as they began rubbing scentless lotion into his skin.
Lestrade himself wasn’t of D’Angeline heritage, but he was familiar enough with the culture, and he nodded appreciatively. “Good luck with that,” he offered, and leaned forward to kiss the corner of his mouth.
“I was just--” John spluttered, and he hated himself in that moment. He hated how transparent he must’ve been, how stupid he must’ve looked
"You have to sit in the chair", said Mrs. Hudson as she stood by the main door. She had a smug look on her face. "That's the only way they'll talk with you."
"I had it on all along?" John chuckled.
Mrs. Hudson laughed uncontrollably. As she walked away she hollered out, "I hope you cleared your schedule because you're going to be waiting a long time."
Sherlock prepares two different kinds of popcorn because John can never decide if he wants sweet kettle or light butter. By the end of the movie, they're both finished anyway.
John was shocked. With his mouth slightly parted, he turned to look at Sherlock. He said out loud to both of them, "I'm sorry. I can't-"
"Oh, dear", said Mrs. Hudson as she drank her tea.
"If it wasn't for this truck, we wouldn't be stranded here and I wouldn't be able to do this." He grabbed John's thick thigh and slowly massaged his leg down to his knee and back up again.
Sherlock waited for his brother to speak but he did not. Sherlock asked, "Should I not have called you?" Normally, Sherlock wouldn't have bothered with Mycroft but he was much too interested now to give up.
It was a man's voice. "Hello?"
John's face got sour. He stared at Sherlock as if searching for an answer to a question he did not know.
Their lips met with such familiarity. It lasted only a couple of seconds but it was smooth. It was enough to make them both feel weak at the knees.
Sherlock was now turned facing him. He replied, “No, I had not noticed. The only shades of blue I ever notice are the ones in your eyes.” As soon as John turned his head, Sherlock could see the corner of his steel blue eyes wrinkle.
John's whole body got weak and he collapsed on top of Sherlock. They were quiet for a moment. The only sounds came from their heavy breathing and the light rain hitting the truck.

Sherlock replied, "Oh, Mycroft. We were just getting started." He smiled at John and scrunched up his nose and lips. Sherlock had become much more romantic now that they were engaged. He would do cheesy gestures such as this but John didn't mind because he seemed to have been less stressed lately and with the upcoming wedding, it was best if he remained this way.
It was early Sunday morning. Baker Street was yet to be buzzing with pedestrians and cars. It was on this normal sunny day that the older Holmes brother found himself inside 221B.
Sherlock loves Thursdays because that's movie night. John always comes home with a newly released DVD.
“You heard me”, Sherlock replied. “Your eyes have exactly 5 shades of blue, 3 shades of grey, and just a touch of brown. My personal favorite being the ocean blue that you get when you’re upset.” He looked down at his shoes again then back up to face John who had moved in closer, away from the door. Ignoring a stunned John, he continued. "There isn’t much you don’t already know. You know I consider you to be the bravest man I’ve ever known. Despite all that you have suffered you have always managed to remain devoted to those around you, including your obnoxious best friend.” He pointed at himself. “You protect the weak and heal the sick. I not only admire your skills as a doctor but your strength as a soldier and… as a man. You are determined, disciplined, sometimes a bit too drastic but… your brilliance… oh, your brilliance astounds me, John. There are many times when you surpass my own resolutions. We both know a little too well that I don’t favor defeat but if I must surrender to someone then I am honored to do it against you.” Unknowingly, Sherlock had moved in closer to John. His voice got lower and deeper. “You are my best friend, the kindest man I will ever meet, but most of all you are… the person… the man who has made me feel.“
Sherlock clenched his jaw, his ire as pricked as his left iris.
"Good night” managed to sound like “piss off." It was interesting, after that naked expression he’d worn only a moment before.
“I love you, John Watson.” Sherlock clenched one hand into a fist at his side, willing his voice to stay strong, his body not to tremble as he let the words fall from his mouth. Once he started, he couldn’t stop. “I have been arrogant and petty. I was an idiot, John. An arse. I never deserved you, but you stayed.” Sherlock was certain he was babbling incoherently, but he couldn’t care less. It was freeing. Each true word tasted like honey. “I love you.”
During the spring, they take their walks over to the garden and they admire the many different flowers and their colors. They love the red roses the most. They find it fascinating that they're a result of genetic mutation. They think it's interesting that the most popular and passionate rose is of a color that wasn't even originally present in the rose family.
"Sherlock! No!" warned John but it was pointless. Sherlock took yet another step closer.
Before he could, John chuckled. "Have you ever noticed the paint on the wall here? There’s two different shades of blue“, he said.
The man on the phone continued, "Hello. Are you there? What is it? Hello?"
John stood there, saying nothing. His eyes penetrating Sherlock’s eyes, wanting to stop him but unable to speak through the knot in his throat.
Sherlock loves taking him to a section off course from the walkway because there's a pond nearby that is home to coy fish. Sherlock couldn't care less about them but the fact that John is fascinated by them makes him smile. Sherlock love to see John happy and he would do anything to keep it that way.
Sherlock looked down to see John's pants and he unbuttoned them. John was so hard that he barely had to do anything to bring the zipper down. Sherlock pulled his pants and underwear down below his ass. John twisted his body a little and somehow managed to bring his jeans down lower towards his ankles. Then he helped Sherlock pull his pants down below his knees.
"Careful, careful." John swiftly brought his hands up to care for his injured head. "You ok?" He examined him as if he were searching for a flesh wound. He didn't find one.
Sherlock stood quiet for a moment. He chuckled and opened his mouth as if to speak but said nothing. He looked over towards Mrs. Hudson and burrowed his eyebrows.
John gave him a look of disappointment and mouthed the words, "Be nice."
Sherlock responded as if he were annoyed but his now well-defined cheeks were turning a shade of pink and they told a different story. He smiled softly and looked over at John as he continued searching through the album.
John couldn't resist the sight before him. His dick went from semi-solid to hard very quickly. He rubbed Sherlock's chest and slowly made his way down to his sides. Sherlock's body was in excellent shape so there were no love handles but when he sat down, you could see a little gut form around his belly. John returned the gesture from earlier and pinched it softly.
