“Married doesn’t mean I can't cheat once and a while,” Sherlock mumbles. John’s hands drift to his hair, he’s tugging on those thick dark curls and grinding his crotch up to meet Sherlock’s downward strokes of his mouth. He rakes his tongue over John’s dick and then slides back up to suck hard on his knob, and John’s hips buck up and he knows he won’t last much longer. “Gonna cum,” he gasps and Sherlock hums.
“Fuck Sherlock!” he gasps and then he kisses him hard. Sherlock sucks his lower lip into his mouth and lets it back out with a pop and John wiggles his bum a bit, trying to get him to push harder. Then Sherlock curls his finger and hits his prostate and John moans hard into Sherlock’s mouth. “Oh yeah, that’s it just like that,” he moans and Sherlock starts sucking on his neck. John doesn’t even care if its gonna leave a mark; he’ll find some story to tell Mary cause she can tell when Sherlock is fibbing but she’s still never figured out when John is. He loves his wife but when a grateful client throws herself at him in a hotel bar he has a hard time saying no. It’s a fault he’s learned to cover up and Mary’s none the wiser so he’ll pretend this is one of those times. Then Sherlock bites down on his collarbone and sticks a second finger into John’s ass and he bucks up his dick, rubbing on Sherlock’s, and moans even louder.
They fall asleep in one another’s arms, and in the morning instead of regretting it they both just smile and kiss, wrapping their pleasantly sore bodies around one another.
He blames Mycroft; his brother should have told him about John and Molly meeting Tom and Mary. He likes Mary, she’s smart and she’s on his side but she wouldn’t be if she knew how he felt about John, and how John probably would have let Sherlock fuck him even if he keeps yelling how he’s not gay. John needs to remember that sometimes people can be bi like Sherlock is and maybe if he thought about it, John would realize he was too.
“God yes,” John moans reaching down with one hand to cover Sherlock’s on his dick. He squeezes and Sherlock pumps him in time with his thrusting hips and suddenly John shouts “FUCK!” and arches his back and his cum is squirting out and coating their joined hands. That sets Sherlock off; he shoots his load. He’s never cum so hard and it’s fucking amazing and he just shudders and rests his head on John’s shoulder while his body finishes up, and his mind is a blank haze of pure pleasure.
“John never could keep it in his pants. I didn’t think being married would make a difference” Sherlock smirks, then he leans his head down and licks Molly’s throat and nips at her shoulder. “I think I’d like to have him lick your sweet little pussy while I’m fucking you Molly and I think you’d like that too, wouldn’t you.”
John curses at him but shuts up when Sherlock drops to his knees and snogs him breathless, licking up his own cum and making sure John can taste it when he kisses him, pushing his tongue deep into the other mans’ hot mouth. “Such a filthy little whore letting me cum all over your face,” he says lowly. John moans and Sherlock reaches down to check. Yup, John is hard as a fucking rock again, no wonder the lady’s love him. He probably eats pussy like a pro but that’s not on tonights menu. “Upstairs,” Sherlock orders him and John grabs up their clothes and stumbles after him when Sherlock bounds up the steps two at a time.
He groans but nods, reluctantly moving his hands to the arms of the chair but watching eagerly as Molly slides her hand up Sherlock’s dick. Grasping it firmly she settles herself onto it. John watches every inch that disappears into her cunt. Shes leaning forward so her tits are jiggling and her hands are braced on Sherlock’s knees. “Hold me,” she orders and Sherlock moves his hands to her waist but doesn’t move otherwise, not even to shove himself deeper inside her. He’s biting his lip and staring at John who stares back at him and grabs the arms of the chair even tighter as Molly teases Sherlock by sliding up and down his dick but not completely letting him fill her. Then she looks at John and smiles a dark smile full of sin and promises and finally fully seats herself on Sherlock.
John knows it’s always been risky, hiding his true status, but he’d rather be mistaken for a Beta than pitied for being an Omega. He’s always assumed Sherlock deduced the truth long ago but kept shut about it for whatever reason.
So Sherlock says he drugged John once and he lost a whole Wednesday. This is what might have happened that Wednesday. It’s noncom because of the drugging and John not remembering what happened at all, so if you don’t like that sort of thing don’t read this, okay. Sherlock's pretty dark in this one.
He squeezes a bit and Shezza groans and wiggles his ass and John pulls out reluctantly and lets his dick go as well. He steps back then goes to the paper towels dispenser by the sink, snaps off the glove and tosses it and the wadded up paper towels so he can tuck himself back into his pants. He watches while Shezza throws his clothes back on, the same track suit and trainers as before but this time he leaves the hood off. “Better open the window Doc or Nurse Blondie will know what we were up to and then you know she won’t say yes when you ask her out later” he smirks.
God he’s had fantasies about that mouth even if he never expected them to be anything but that, and Sherlock doesn’t disappoint. He runs his tongue along John’s dick and reaches around to slip his fingers along John’s ass which is weeping with moisture, slick and ready and just aching to be knotted. “Sherlock please," he begs but Sherlock pulls his mouth away and glares up at him. “Call me Shezza,” he growls and John isn’t sure if it’s because he wants them to still be undercover or if its because being Shezza makes this easier somehow. But it doesn’t matter in the end so all he does is nod and gasp out “Shezza” and Sherlock rewards him by putting his mouth back on his dick and nearly swallowing it to the base.
He watches when Sherlock takes his sticky hand and licks it clean. Then he flips John back onto the couch and does what he said he would: he puts his mouth on John’s ass and licks that part clean as well, eagerly lapping up his own cum. John is panting and his heart has barely got back to normal when he feels himself getting hard again. Usually it takes him hours but not this time. Not with Sherlock. Its like he’s 20 again and ready to go all night.
“You're not my only Omega” Sherlock warns him when the kiss ends. John is panting and right now he couldn’t care less if Sherlock was shagging everyone in NSY. “If you can’t deal with that then you may as well go right back to Mary after we’ve fucked.”
Sherlock nods and trembles, reaching out to pull John closer, clutching him like he's 8 again. "I tried to tell him no," he whispers. "I told him it was too big but he just pushed it inside my mouth and fucked my mouth until he came. Then he passed out and I got sick in the hallway on the way to my bed. He had to clean it up the next day and at first he didn't believe me and called me a liar. But then he checked out his bed and found my hairs and realized I was telling the truth. He never said he was sorry but he never did drugs again after that. I pushed that all down in my memory but I guess I didn't delete it, I didn't know how to delete things until I was a lot older.
John is dozing but the sound of Sherlock’s mobile playing “She Blinded Me With Science” jolts him awake. He blinks and watches Sherlock as he bounds out of bed, not bothering with anything like clothes or even a sheet, just hurries out of the room butt naked. He hears Sherlock shouting something out the window that sounds like “heres the key” then hears the door being opened. A few seconds later he hears footsteps and the door slams shut and he hears Molly Hooper’s angry voice. “Sherlock Holmes, you know I don’t like it when you get high! Your brain is too valuable for you to waste on drugs!” and then suddenly she stops talking and John’s curiosity is too much for him so he gets up and looks out the bedroom door (but he grabs Sherocks robe and throws it on first).
And so is Sherlock because he just puts his hand on John’s head and lets him reach up and tear open his pants and tug them down. He groans a bit when John takes his dick in his mouth and starts sucking like crazy, like a starving man at a feast, and Sherlock shuts his eyes and lets himself enjoy the moment even though not too long ago he told John he was married to his work and basically that he wasn’t interested. He was lying of course; he knew the minute he met John that he wanted something like this to happen but he was too stubborn to change his mind from the years of pushing sex into a closet in his Mind Palace. Mycroft thought he was still a virgin but Sherlock wasn’t a virgin since high school and even though he only fucked girls back then, he always knew he liked guys too.
“Grab my dick, slick it up and let me cum in your hand,” Shezza growls and John grabs the tube. He almost drops it when Shezza clenches around his dick and nips the young man in the shoulder as punishment. Shezza laughs and does it again and John bites harder but manages to open the lube and slick up his gloved hand. He reaches down and squeezes Shezzas dick and hears him suck in his breath before he starts really moving, reaching around and grabbing John’s ass. “Gonna let me fuck you sometime Doc” he asks and John can’t help it, he cums right then but his hand is still sliding over Shezza’s dick, moving up and down urgently until he feels him go taught underneath him and clench his ass around John’s dick hard enough to milk another orgasm out of him, a dry one this time. Then he feels Shezza’s cum on his hand, spurting out and coating his fingers through the latex of the glove.
John raises his knees. “Fuck me now, please Sherlock” he begs. Instead of leaning over him Sherlock lies back and raises his arms. “Come sit on me John,” he says. "I want to watch your face and be able to hold your dick. I want your cum on my hands and my cum inside you. I want to taste you after I cum inside you, lick my cum out of you and wait for you to get hard again so you can fuck me the way I know you want to.”
Then Shezza puts his mouth back on John’s dick and sucks it deep into his throat and John’s eyes snap shut and he can feel the tingling in his balls that means he’s about to cum. “Fuck” he gasps digging his fingers into Shezza’s curls and twisting hard. His hips buck and Shezza’s mouth works him harder and suddenly the kid pulls his mouth away. John’s cum squirts all over his face on his lips and cheeks and the kid is grinning like he just won a prize.
He tests it out by rubbing up against John’s ass while he’s still leaning forward. “You like it when I touch you like this,” he says and John repeats “I like it when you touch me like this.”
When he recovers a bit he starts moving as well, snapping his ass back against Sherlock’s dick, forcing him in deeper and whining with pleasure at each thrust. Soon his dick starts getting hard again and Sherlock lets go with one hand to grab it and squeeze, pumping the length of it in time with the movements of his hips. “God John you feel so good," he groans, leaning over to kiss John’s neck, nipping and licking in a way that sends sparks of pleasure up and down his spine. “So fucking hot like my own personal heater. I think we should thank Mary if she’s the one who actually did this. Unless it was you, hmm?" He asks. “Was it her or did you do it because you knew how much I wanted you, John? How much I wanted to knot you, God I can’t wait until I can punch it inside your hot little ass.”
As if that’s the signal Sherlock was waiting for he grunts and his thrusts get shallower and shallower until John realizes with a flood of excitement its because of his knot. He’s never been knotted since he’s only fucked female Alphas in the past, and he thinks now he should of tried it sooner because it feels like what he was born for. With a great shout Sherlock punches his knot into John’s tight ass and John has another ass orgasm, spurting his Omega fluids so hard they leak out over his and Sherlock’s tightly joined bodies. Sherlock’s knot is stretching him and it feels glorious and his cum is hot inside John’s body even against the fever heat of his temperature. He loves it, glories in it and knows it’ll happen again soon because his heats usually last a few days.
“Are you sure you don’t want this?” And suddenly Sherlock’s dick is gone but its replaced by his mouth and his tongue, circling John’s ass, thrusting inside suddenly and causing John to shout and buck but Sherlock has a tight hold of him and is thrusting his tongue in and out rhythmically like hes fucking him, and John is moaning at the sensation. It feels bloody fantastic but its not enough, he needs more and he begs Sherlock again for his dick, for his knot and the stupid stubborn Alpha shakes his head no. “Not yet John,” he says. “You’re gonna cum for me this way first. Then I’ll knot your properly, get you up the duff before your heat’s over, make you mine the way you should of been all along but I was too stubborn to realize.”
“Never had this happen before, have you John?” Sherlock asks and John shakes his head, too spent to talk. “That’s because you’ve never been knotted by a proper Alpha. Oh being banded is fine I suppose but its been a long time since you even did that since you were mostly fucking Betas so you could pretend to be a Beta yourself. Now you’ve had me I think this proves to us both where you really belong. So from now on you’ll be sharing heats with me at least, hm, once a month, yes? No more suppressants and Mary can just fucking take a hike. She’s already had your baby, now I want you to have mine.”
“You can’t be here like this,” he hisses, moving forward and automatically dropping the file onto the desk. “What if someone sees”
He rocks harder and harder until he’s moving like a piston, fucking John as hard as he says he can take it. “You’re gonna fucking need that cane of yours when I’m done with you,” he snarls and John has tears streaming from his eyes but his legs are locked around Sherlock’s waist and he’s thrusting up to meat his downwards strokes. “Harder” he begs and grabs Sherlock’s shoulders. They kiss, another sloppy desperate kiss and Sherlock reaches between them to glide his hand over John’s dick, slippery with precum and lube. John moans and reaches up to grab the headboard which is banging against the wall like a screen door in a hurricaine and Sherlock feels himself starting to let go. “Gonna cum John but I want you to cum for me first,” he gasps.
“So do I," Sherlock growls and raises Molly up and off his dick while John jumps to his feet. Sherlock lifts Molly into his arms and says “Bedroom” and John follows happily not forgetting to grab the lube from Sherlock’s dresser once they're in the other room. He tosses it to Sherlock who has Molly laying across his lap with her head on her arms and her ass perkily up in the air. He lubes up two fingers and slips them inside. “Come here John,” Molly orders, gesturing for him to stand in front of her. “Let me taste you while Sherlock gets me ready.”
"I'm here because you had another fucking nightmare Sherlock and I couldn't wake you up. Now what's going on and don't tell me you don't remember. You said 'too big' again and you sounded like you were in pain and you were yelling for help."
“You always said you were married to your work!”
John shakes his head; he knows he won’t be going back to Mary even with a baby on the way. Mary’s a Beta and no Beta could ever compete with an alpha. “We’ll work out custody,“ is all he says before craning his neck to the side for Sherlock to scent.
He does more than scent it of course; he sucks a dark mark into the overheated flesh and John groans as his hands fumble at Sherlock’s clothes. He manages to work his shirt off and runs his hands up and down the coolness of his torso. Sherlock has very little body hair and John is even more turned on than he would of thought possible as he caresses his nipples. Then Sherlock nips, hard, and John moans again.
He lets John fuck him a few times, using John’s bodily fluids to slick down Sherlock’s ass when john’s aching ass needs some relief from being knotted. Sherlock is tight and slick and his ass feels nothing like a pussy, much smoother and silkier and he loves it although he knows he’ll never stop wanting pussy as well. And not just because he’s still technically married. Sherlock’s right – they belong together and he’s willing to share him with whatever other Omega he has on the side. “Who is it?” he gasps out as he slides his dick deep into Sherlock’s ass. “Whose the other Omega?”
She reached over and tugged at his hair. Her eyes were almost all black with lust and she was panting, her tongue hanging out of her mouth and John knew what she wanted from him. He slipped an arm around her shoulders and cupped her face with his hand as he kissed her, making sure to slip her the tongue and keeping their mouths open enough that Sherlock could see them.
And when he’s ready, Sherlock knows he will be too.
A few minutes later he's bending Sherlock over the back of his chair, his hands braced on his hips and his lubed dick sliding into Sherlock’s tight little ass. “God you're so hot, so tight, I fucking love it,” John moans, pushing a little deeper inside.
He wants to fuck John, god he wants to. He's wanted to do that since they first met but he forced himself to not think about and bury it deep in his mind palace but never delete it. His body is transport that’s what he always tells himself and John isn’t Sebastian Moran, he won't come home to the flat one day and find his lover, if he ever gets the courage to make John his lover, balls deep in another man.
John hesitates a minute then shrugs and says "Fuck it, whatever" and pulls off his pants and shirt but leaves his underwear on. He's wearing the red ones and Sherlock feels his dick getting hard just seeing those red underpants. John's not hard, not yet but he will be soon if Sherlock has his way. He leans forward so one arms is resting on the edge of the tub and the other one's on his knee, which is bent up. "It's itchy John, can you please scrub my back?"
He takes John out for his stag night and pretends everyone else had to cancel which is only sort of a lie, because Lestrade does have to work at the last minute. And Mycroft wouldn’t go to a stag party if you threatened to invade England, and Anderson is busy fucking some woman who isn’t his wife and isn’t Sally Donovan (she got smart and dumped his ass while Sherlock was hunting down Moriarty’s criminals). Then he pretends to drink more then he really does and gets John back to Baker Street. John is totally smashed but not so drunk he won’t be able to get it up. Sherlock knows its wrong but he wants him so bad, he has to do it now before John is married and he never gets this chance again. If he and John fuck each other or suck each other off tonight, before the actual wedding, Mary would forgive him and possibly John won’t even remember, and Sherlock’s ashamed but he wants him so bad he know he’s going to do it anyway. So its now or never and he doesn’t want it to be never.
“Yes, yes,” John says sobbing out the words as his hands form into frustrated fists.
“Mmm yes you are, cum for me now, John,” he says reaching down to cup his balls. His index finger strays back until its pressing against John’s ass hole and he gives a strangled moan and shoots his wad into Sherlock’s eagerly sucking mouth. He swallows it all down and makes contented smacking noises like a baby sucking on a tit and john comes even harder, so hard he almost blacks out.
"They'll all be for you, every one," John assures him with a loving kiss. "Bastard's had it coming for a long time, I don't care how much he's tried to make up for it since."
Sherlock gives him that “don’t be stupid’ look but John’s brain isn’t functioning at 100% at the moment so he can’t think of who it could be. Then Sherlock wraps his legs around shoulders and the ability to think is entirely gone. John starts to move and his dick is red and leaking from the tip already. John reaches down and wraps his hand around it, pumping in time to his thrusts. He can feel the hard glands that will form Sherlock’s knot when he fucks him again; they’ll swell up and lock them together again and that thought nearly makes him cum as he relives the past few days. “Fuck me harder John,” Sherlock orders and John obeys like a good Omega. Sherlock praises him for that and pulls him down for a hot, demanding kiss that’s all teeth and tongue as he writhes beneath John’s body. Even though they’ve switched positions for the moment John is still in heat and can feel the sweat pouring off his body as his temperature skyrockets. “Fuck,” he swears, “I need your knot Sherlock, please.”
Sherlock moans when John reaches up and clutches his ass. He never expected this tonight but fuck it. The adrenaline and the fact that he's wanted John since first meeting him means that he’s going to do whatever the fuck he wants tonight. For once his brain can take a fucking hike; his body is in charge and his body definitely likes the way John Watson’s mouth feels on his dick. His body also likes the way John Watson’s dick tastes and feels in his own mouth and he smirks at the memory of sucking the other man off in the back of a cab. So fucking filthy. Mycroft would be horrified but Sherlock doesn’t fucking care if his pants are ruined. All he cares about is getting off and he’s about to do that but he doesn’t want John to swallow his cum, no he wants something else and as soon as he feels his balls tightening he pulls his dick out of John’s mouth and spurts cum all over his face.
The Wednesday Sherlock decides to experiment with John isn’t just about drugs. When he’s making his speech at john and Mary’s wedding he remembers exactly what happened even if John never will. And since John wants to believe he’s not gay or even bi, which Sherlock knows he is, well that’s his loss. Mary’s nice enough even though Sherlock can tell theres stuff she isn’t telling them about her past but she likes him and encourages John to be his friend, so Sherlock decides to let it go. And now he’s best man at their wedding and all he can think about is that Wednesday.
After they stagger to the bathroom and clean themselves up Sherlock can't help hoping that John will remember this after all and maybe let it happen again some time. They go back to the sofa and have a couple of shots and then Mrs. Hudson shows up with a client and the game is back on. A different game then the one they just played but not nearly as good, at least Sherlock doesn’t think so.
“I like it” Sherlock obeys, reaching down with one hand to stroke his dick, John slaps it away and tells him to put it back where it was. No, orders him to do it, and Sherlock hurries to obey, shivering with lust and need as he does so. “You only cum from me fucking you, no touching yourself, got that?” John barks and Sherlock nods. There are tears leaking from the corners of his eyes but he doesn’t care how much it hurts because of how good it feels at the same time.
Then he kisses Sherlock again and they spend the rest of the day pretending the outside world and especially Mycroft Holmes don't exist.
“Exactly what I have in mind John” he says in a low growl, then grabs John by the back of the neck and kisses him again. John closes his eyes automatically and opens his mouth to allow Sherlock’s tongue to plunder it. A submissive whine escapes his lips and Sherlock growls and grabs his ass, squeezing it tightly while continuing to kiss John hard. It’s the most passionate kiss he’s ever had from anyone, even Mary (even if he’s ashamed to admit it).
“What-what’s your name” he asks breathless with want and the kid grins at him as he roughly turns John so that his back is against the wall.
“Yes and you're married to Mary but here we both are. I guess we’re both cheating tonight,” Sherlock says, then he lowers his head and sucks John’s dick into his mouth rubbing his lube-slicked hand over John’s smooth balls and letting one finger move down to his ass. It slips in easier this time because John is looser and because of the lube. Then he puts a second finger inside and then a third and John moans and grabs Sherlock’s hair again as his mouth bobs on his dick. Sherlock practically swallows it down, letting it into his throat, and John shouts in surprise and lust at the feeling. “I’m gonna cum if you don’t stop,” he gasps and Sherlock kneels up, still slicking his fingers in and out of John’s ass. “But John, I can’t help myself you're so smooth and delicious,” he purrs.
After he cums John lies back in the chair his whole body sags like he’s got no energy left at all. “Best fucking stag party ever,” he slurs and Sherlock can’t wait, he opens his pants and kneels up on the chair. “Suck me John please,” he begs holding his dick in front of John’s mouth.
Then John flips him on his back and whispers "My turn" and Sherlock is moaning and gasping while John puts his mouth on his dick. He's never done this before so he's a little clumsy at first but he knows what he likes and he makes sure to do that to Sherlock. He sucks the red head of his dick into his mouth a few times, then strokes his balls, not surprise to find that Sherlock is into manscaping and is completely hairless down there. He then licks his shaft and feels Sherlock squirming, then takes his balls into his mouth one at a time, suckling them like they were sweets. And they are to him. He wonders what it would be like to give Sherlock a rim job but decides to save that for next time, maybe when they're taking a shower together. He knows that's when Sarah likes to have her ass licked. He feels a little guilty thinking about his soon-tp-be-exgirlfriend but just hopes it doesn't cost him his job. Then he forgets about her completely and concentrates on the person he really wants, moving his mouth up and taking Sherlock's dick back into his mouth. He can't swallow him down as deep as Sherlock did but he does his best and uses his hands on the bottom half, stroking in time to the movements of his mouth while Sherlock pants and groans and calls out his name. "I'm cumming," he shouts, lifting his hips and John pulls his mouth away. He's not ready to swallow, not yet, but knows that will come with practice. But he feels Sherlock's hot cum cover his lips and chin and doesn't wipe it away when he leans down to kiss the other man. Sherlock doesn't seem to care and John feels himself getting hard again. God sex with Sherlock is going to be nothing but fantastic he thinks as Sherlock licks his own cum off of John's face.
"Later,” John says and Sherlock laughs again and kisses him, sliding his tongue sensuously over John’s lips. “OK later” he whispers as he reaches under the couch cushions. He pulls up a bottle of lube he stashed there. “Sometime I wank right here on the couch, John,” he says, kneeling up and squirting the thick liquid onto his palm. “Thinking about fucking Molly, or about how I should of just fucked you on your stag night and showed you what you were missing.”
Sherlock looks up at him and there’s something in his eyes that makes John want to step back but he doesn’t, he just stands there and looks down at him. “You’re walking different,” Sherlock finally says and sits up. John stifles a moan because Sherlock’s gorgeous mouth is only inches away from his crotch and he knows he can see how hard he is through his jeans. “And besides John, you’re not really upset that I’m high are you. No I can tell you're excited.” Then he leans forward and just brushes his lips across the denim. John shivers and moans, reaching out and grabing Sherlocks hair, loving the way the curls feel even if they’re a bit greasy and unwashed right now. “You want something John, something you don’t think I’ll give you if I’m not high, if I’m not being Shezza and you’re right, I wont. But right now I’m not Sherlock Holmes the consulting detective. I’m Shezza the coke head and speaking of head I really want to suck your dick, John.” Then he opens John’s jeans and pops his hard dick free of his underwear and starts sucking eagerly.
Sherlock shocks him by looking him square in the eye and saying, "I guess it started when I started fantasizing about you John. I've been imagining what it would be like to suck your dick, to let you fuck me and I guess it scared me, made the memories come back." Then he smiles and John is amazed to see him blushing. "But now that they're out in the open I think I can finally get past them. And all because of you John Watson. You keep me right." He leans forward and kisses him and John shocks himself by kissing him back. It's not a passionate frenzy or anything, but their tongues are in each others mouths and they're holding each other close, so close John can feel Sherlock's dick getting harder. "This isn't the right time," he gasped as he pulls away. "You just had a kind of breakthrough Sherlock, we shouldn't start anything yet."
Sherlock shuddered and turned away but John reached out and wrapped his arms around him again. "You seem like you feel safe with me," he whispers. "I'm your friend Sherlock, please tell me."
When he finally goes limp he pulls out carefully knowing John will be sore and tender for a while. He feels a little guilty so he helps John to the shower and has him wash up and then take a warm bath with some Epson salts and gives him some salve. He instructs him to forget it all and write any leftover soreness off as being caused by some food poisoning, like what happened to him at that sketchy Thai place last year. He was running at both ends then and limping for a day before his body stopped being pissed off at him.
Like it’s a signal they’ve worked out Sherlock starts moving, thrusting his hips up and down while Molly bounces on his dick and stares at John. She taps Sherlock on the knees with the riding crop just once, then drops it on the floor and Sherlock grabs her tits. “Tell John how it feels,” Molly orders, leaning forward a bit more and starting to moan a bit.
"Yes" he growls as soon as they're naked. He looks at Sherlock and says the words that caused him pain in the past. "You need something bigger to suck, Sherlock." Only now its healing he's after. Sherlock smiles a brilliant smile and lets John shove his head down between his legs. As soon as his lips close around the head of John's dick he closes his eyes and starts to groan with pleasure. Fuck, the man is brilliant just like John always knew he would be, good at anything he decides to do and even if this is the first time John's had his dick sucked by another man hes just glad it's Sherlock. "Oh baby, yeah, just like that" he groans and Sherlock sucks harder, working John's dick into his throat and digging his fingers into his ass.
They stay like that for three days; Sherlock tells the police when they text him that he’s unavailable to provide testimony at the moment and even though they don’t like it they can’t exactly force him to come in. Not when he growls at the captain that his Omega is in heat and tells them they can all fuck off.
John shoves his pants down to his knees and steps out of his shoes then takes off his jacket and shirt. He pulls Sherlock’s mouth away from his dick long enough to pull his sweatshirt and t-shirt off and Sherlock takes off his pants and shoes, then he stops and stares at John’s naked dick. He looks up at John and grins that slow feral grin that sends a shiver down john’s spine and makes his dick even harder. “Did you shave for Mary or for me?” Sherlock asks, then shakes his head. “Don’t answer I already know, John.” His voice is deeper than usual, like a lion’s purr as he runs his hands up John’s thighs and grabs his ass, squeezing it tight. “John, do you want me to fuck you? He asks. “Or do you want to fuck me? Put your dick right in my ass, lube it up and fuck me until you cum inside me?”
“You can write me a prescription for some oxy” Shezza says and John nods, licking his lips. This is so fucking wrong for so many reasons but something about the young junkie just sets his blood on fire. “Alright,” he says. “I’ll write the script before you leave.”
Sherlock will though; he'll give it to him damn good but first he has to suck him off. He takes him deeper, licking hard with his tongue and scraping his teeth over the hood when he moves his mouth back. John is panting hard now and his dick is so thick and delicious Sherlock wants to just take him all the way in to his throat, but if he does it will be over and he's going to make this last. He doesn't want this to be quick and dirty. Well dirty yes but not quick. So he settled into a steady rhythm not fast enough to make John cum yet but a little harder each time. He puts one hand underneath john's balls and cups them, rubbing his fingers over the heavy sac, and John moans again and gasps out Sherlock's name and says "Oh fuck yes". Then Sherlock goes to work for real, making sure to get every gorgeous inch of Johns heavy dick slick with saliva and working it with his hand at the same time. Johns hand is still in his hair and he's staring down at where Sherlock's mouth is on his dick, watching it move in and out of Sherlock's mouth and his panting is getting faster. he tugs hard at Sherlock's hair and Sherlock moans deep in his throat. John moans right back at him. His hips are twitching and Sherlock knows he wants to fuck into his mouth so he decides to let him. He takes john's dick deep, deep inside, and John started to swear and really buck his hips. "Oh fuck yes that's brilliant keep doing that," he says, well moans actually. He keeps swearing and tells Sherlock how fucking amazing he is, and Sherlock, whose been hard this whole time, feels like he might cum just from hearing John say those things. He wanted to hear those things for so long now, to hear John tell him during sex how good he is and now his dream is coming true.
[23:22] You've been having a dialogue. How very wonderful. Care to elaborate, brother? SH
Dumbfounded, and extremely aroused, John tentatively opened his mouth as Sherlock crushed their lips together once again, their bodies close, but not quite pressed together. John’s hands moved up into Sherlock’s hair, and he blamed it entirely on the fact that they had to keep their cover and blend in. He was playing his part.
Later that same evening, after a long, freezing shower, John still found himself unable to still his racing thoughts. They were becoming increasingly obscene, and John thought it was a wonder Sherlock hadn’t deduced them from his face. The detective, however, was distracted with the case, his eyes never leaving his laptop, a pair of white earphones plugged in. Whatever he had been watching, it must have been interesting, because he hadn’t lifted his eyes from the screen for hours.
(18:27) You’re drunk. SH
"I think you've drunk enough now, John. You should go to sleep."
(00:44) shrunk H
(11:25) Like by biting you...? SH
He remembered her voice very well.
John tilted his face enough to allow Sherlock better access to his neck, and he licked a long streak down his sternocleidomastoid muscle. Unable to suppress a shudder, John's body trembled, but Sherlock didn't seem to pay that any mind. Instead, his hands had come up into John's hair, and they were tugging at his strands hard enough for it to be painful, but not quite so painful that it hurt. Unable to see Sherlock’s face properly in the dim lighting, he closed his eyes, adamant to remember as many details from their encounter as possible, as it was very likely this would be their first
Sherlock stops running, his legs giving way underneath him. Gasping for air, he slumps to the ground, barely noticing the jolt of pain that travels up his legs as his knees collide with the hard surface. He can feel his heart thumping in his throat, the thud of its beat ringing in his ears. He curses between the gasps, slamming his fist into the ground. Too late. He was too late.
"Hello, brother dear," Sherlock says sarcastically, "how are you?"
(11:48) Oh, please. Would you care to elaborate? SH
(03:48) You have no idea. H
‘I-‘ Sherlock began, unsure of how to express himself when John’s fingers were doing
Heat pooling in his lower abdomen, Sherlock had to break the kiss to breathe. He was shaking as he gasped for air, his pulse thudding in his ears, his heart threatening to jump out of his chest. His cheeks flushed, Sherlock lifted his eyes to meet those of Victor.
(02:59) John? SH
(10:20) It can't have been that reliable, I really have no idea what you're talking about mate
(01:22) You know I'm right. SH
It hadn’t taken John long to realize his deeply rooted attraction for Sherlock. There was something in his slender figure and long, pale limbs that spoke directly to his groin. The way his cheekbones were highlighted in certain lightings, the way his dark, auburn curls lay chaotically across his forehead, and the way his silver eyes bore into John’s soul. John was completely, utterly lost to the powers of this married-to-his-work man. His Sherlock Holmes.
[23:50] I don't need you to tell me anything. SH
"Excellent," Victor purred again and hooked his arm in Sherlock's, practically dragging him along the street. He took the cigarette out of Sherlock's mouth and put it to his own lips while regarding Sherlock hungrily.
“So this--” John gestured between Sherlock’s naked form and his fully clothed one, “was to get me in bed?”
John let his hand drag softly across the duvet, enjoying the smooth fabric. It smelled like something that could only be Sherlock.
(17:34) I see. SH
(12:07) Mrs Hudson will be waiting for you. SH
That afternoon, John felt increasingly anxious. Despite it having been a week since his father had had an angry episode, John's chest still hurt when he took deep breaths, and it stopped him from going for a jog, something he normally did to distract his busy thoughts from becoming overwhelming. It didn't help that Sherlock wasn't answering his text messages. Not that he had sent many, or that they very especially urgent. He just wished he knew what Sherlock was doing.
(04:47) Highly unlikely. SH
(03:32) I'm sorry. SH
He rubs his hands across his face and throws his phone aside next to him on the bed. It is always him chasing after Sherlock like a maniac. Otherwise there is radio silence.
(01:40) John? SH
‘I- I understand if you will want to leave,’ Sherlock said quietly, pulling John from his trance. ‘It’s all fine, I- I will adjust.’
(09:58) Yes, your offender. I know it's a common coping mechanism to suppress traumatic memories, but it's hardly been a week since you reported the crime, and this is extremely important. SH
(03:10) If Moriarty is our killer, he must know that I’m the only one who’s clever enough to realize that these serial suicides are not actually suicides. SH
(09:37) In order to catch the offender, I need to ask you a few questions. Meet me at Charing Cross Station in thirty minutes. SH
(05:38) Just walk in. Mrs Hudson will show you to your room. SH
(06:44) John. SH
(05:01) Let him continue to abuse you? SH
[15:16] Where is he? SH
(11:38) So, who DO you like around school?
[14:40] No. You have no right. Don't you dare drag him into this. This is between you and me. SH
‘John,’ was all Sherlock could manage, and it was all John needed to hear to understand that the world would keep spinning and keep revolving around Sherlock, but that Sherlock would revolve around him, too.
(22:10) Good. What else? SH
"What are you talking about?" Sherlock spat out with as much venom as he could muster.
(04:23) Go home, John. SH
(00:34) What are you thinkgsi about? H
‘John.’
Sherlock had already given up hope of ever hearing from the mysterious H again, and felt his heart rate speed up a little when he saw that the text was from him.
God, he hoped Sherlock was alright. It was rather humorous, he thought to himself, that Sherlock’s wellbeing was the first thing on his mind no matter what situation he found himself in.
(03:33) Yes, I don’t believe it was you. SH
(10:17) You don't have to tell me. SH
John let go of Sherlock’s face and turned the shower off, moving to the tower rack and handing Sherlock a dry towel. He wrapped it gently around his shoulders and grabbed him around his waist, gently lifting him to a standing position.
‘What are those?’
This is what is REALLY going on when we're roleplaying:
(16:47) No. No, you didn’t. SH
(01:08) I almost believe you. SH
(10:25) I mean good if you’ll sleep better. SH
Nodding, a blush crept across Sherlock’s feature and John rolled his eyes.
(04:11) Look, John. I’m not going to tell anyone. Who would I tell, anyway? SH
‘Sherlock, I- I shouldn’t have, I’m sorry.’
(07:36) Positive. Now, get some sleep. SH
(10:39) They don't think it's important that the woman was left-handed. They told me to get a hobby. A hobby, John! SH
(22:05) Give me data. SH
“Would you like a drink?” she asks.
(11:52) I know. But it's really not that fun when you end up killing yourself. SH
"Just leave me alone and go enjoy that breakfast buffet which I'm sure you're already salivating over."
(05:10) Well, that’s new. SH
Petty murders. Sentiment has made you slow.
(02:42) Stay away from the gun. SH¨
(11:02) Yes, you're allowed to explore, and no, we do not have dungeons. You might want to avoid my brother's room, though, unless you want to end up alone in a dark cell god knows where. SH
(02:00) I got caught up in a case. SH
Noticing Sherlock was entirely nude underneath the blue fabric, John suddenly released Sherlock and grabbed him by the hand, pushing him down on his bed, climbing on top in between his knees, their lips locking together again. With nimble hands, John pushed the blue robe off his shoulders, and Sherlock sat for a moment, shrugging it off entirely.
"John?"
John stepped away from his back and pulled Sherlock around to meet him. His eyes were riddled with fear, uncertainty and disgust, and it startled John to see Sherlock express such emotions. He placed his hands on Sherlock’s cheeks again hoping it wouldn’t startle him. Sherlock closed his eyes and leaned into the touch slightly.
Suddenly, a thought hit him, and he felt his throat constrict in panic and something uncomfortable lurch in his stomach. What if H was making fun of him? Perhaps this was some kind of sick joke, one of his bullies taking a piss out of him. If he wasn't careful, soon the whole school would know what a pathetic loner he was. He could hear his brother's voice in his head, saying how he should know better, mocking him for being so foolish. Taking a shaky breath, Sherlock reminded himself that alone was what he had. Alone protected him.
(03:00) Save that for Sannah. SH
[15:43] Thank you. SH
(See the end of the chapter for
John stares down at his cellphone, a lump forming in his throat. This is it for them.
(12:50) If it's sleeping pills you want, there might be some in my parents' bathroom cabinet. SH
(10:05) The killer's broken his pattern. SH
There was a long moment of threatening silence before Mycroft eventually gave in.
(16:51) It'd help immensely if I knew what I am supposed to deny. SH
It really doesn’t feel fine.
‘JOHN!’
He sits up quickly, suddenly very eager to get out of Sherlock’s room and out of his life. Nausea hits him like a wave and he has to focus to not throw up. He throws on his clothes, grabs his charger and his phone and makes it upstairs to his own bedroom. There he packs down all his belongings and throws the bag over his shoulder. He is out of the Holmes’ Estate in less than ten minutes.
(18:00) No, it’s… fine. SH
(03:31) I'm at home, tried to sneak in. What are you doing? H
(11:34) Definitely not, she is too loud and obnoxious
(11:01) Oh, I'm no one, just thought your name was familiar
[09:56] You have no right! SH
their last.
(04:30) You look sad when you think no one can see you. H
(14:32) It’s official, then. SH
(07:30) Look, what I said before, John. I meant it. My brother could help you, but I need you to go to the police. You have to tell them. SH
Pinching his eyes closed, Sherlock forces himself to focus. There has to be something he has missed, something he has forgotten. Think. Think. Think!
(11:00) Lovely choice of words, John. SH
"I'm gonna go..." John quickly stuttered, afraid that he had made a mistake and been too obvious about his feelings. Slightly panicked, John hit the end call button and threw his phone across the bathroom floor, hearing it crack as the front screen hit the tiles. He covered his face in his hands.
(04:32) John, they've found a link between the victims. They've all been to Germany in the last month, and they all visited the same casino there. Hardly a coincidence. Now, what did they all do there? I doubt they went there to gamble. They didn't even know how to play poker! There's something else. An organisation. And the casino was their secret meeting-place. But why did they have to die? SH
~~*~~
Harry keeps not asking, and John keeps drinking. They sit like that, John on the floor with his back against her couch and Harry on top of it, a glass in their hands and a bottle of whiskey on the floor. When the glasses empty, they refill them in silence. There is something comforting about it and John can finally feel his tense muscles relax. He clears his throat.
(12:02) Because you're an idiot. SH
(17:52) And like I said, I’m busy. SH
(04:11) And what do you think about me, based on your observations? SH
“Uh, it says ‘get Sherlock’. That’s it.”
John had no idea what to make of it, but he knew, in the furthest depths of his soul, that this couldn’t end well. There was no way he was going to be able to suppress his emotions if they had to act like a couple, and definitely not in a bloody swinger’s club. Realizing he was becoming slightly hysterical, he tried to ignore the confounded look Sherlock gave him as they rode in the cab to their location together, his left knee twitching nervously. The fact that they hadn’t really talked about this properly didn’t help calm his nerves, either. John really had no idea what they were going to do. How far were they going to go to ensure their cover remained intact? Were they going to hold hands? It was a little silly, of course. They would have to do more than hold hands to blend in with the crowd of people in various states of undress. Would they… kiss? John just didn’t know.
"I said I believe you!"
(11:35) Good morning. SH
(03:28) Where are you? Are you okay? You can talk to me, I don't mind. SH
[23:44] We made a deal. SH
(15:01) I’m busy. SH
(02:51) Promise me you won't touch the gun. SH
(11:37) You have only yourself to blame. SH
people—ordinary people—can’t seem to understand his obsession. Sherlock is rude, insensitive and cold, and John is ‘too good for the likes of him. Stay away from Sherlock Holmes.’ John, of course, doesn’t. He stays and continues to be drawn to Sherlock like a moth to a burning flame.
[23:19] And you let him threaten me and John? You're enjoying this. SH
(04:32) John, you have to tell someone. You can’t just let him abuse you. SH
(22:44) What? No. Why would you think that? SH
He held his breath and pushed the door open.
‘You’re an idiot,’ Sherlock finally breathed, and suddenly Sherlock wasn’t the one pressed up against the door—it was John. And suddenly Sherlock’s lips were on his neck and their bodies were pressed tightly against each other, and John let out a barely contained groan. Then their lips were meeting and Sherlock was kissing him hungrily, his tongue trailing across John’s bottom lip. John opened his mouth slightly to allow better access and Sherlock eagerly followed, his left hand pulling on John’s hair and the other one trailing its way down to his lower back. Their erections pressed flush together eliciting a moan from them both, and John felt light headed and very warm.
(22:54) And why is that important? SH
(19:13) Mary knows Moriarty. She works for him. SH
“Alright.”
(22:39) Then what is it? Did I do something? H
(06:16) I’ll leave you to it then. SH
as well. It was like adding insult to injury. John was dying a slow, hormone-induced death and Sherlock just kept on existing. Just like that. It was unfair, to say the least.
(07:25) No! SH
(14:59) Right. SH
John froze, and snapped back to himself.
John’s voice was uncertain, calm and full of pity. Sherlock loathed it.
(04:51) I can stop. H
He wanted Sherlock. God, he wanted him so badly he wasn’t really sure what to do with himself whenever they were alone. It was as if there was something physically pulling him towards Sherlock that he just wasn’t strong enough to resist. John was surprised Sherlock hadn’t noticed his longing looks yet and kicked him out.
“What?” John asked, breathless and slightly annoyed. Then he realized. “There was never a case, was there?”
John lost it.
(06:52) What? Why? SH
(16:30) You could come stay at my place. SH
Sherlock feels his heart starting to race faster, pounding almost painfully against his chest. ‘No, Mycroft, this is serious. You need to help him. You--you need to.’  For half a second, he closes his eyes and grimaces, trying to ignore the stinging behind his eyelids. ‘Please.’
WARNING!
Sherlock knows, he knows perfectly well that Mycroft is right, but he can't help it, the tightness in his chest too much to bear. ‘Promise me. Just say it.’
(11:47) It's too dangerous. SH
Here comes meet the writers 2.0! This is what it is REALLY like when we write.
"I am in bed."
(17:20) Oh, please. Do keep up, John! What is it that you don't understand? Criminals. People who want to commit crimes. He's a spider. A spider at the center of a criminal web. SH
‘Sherlock.’
His thoughts are interrupted when a black car screeches into the alleyway through a sharp turn and stops in front of them, and the smile from his officer’s face fades.
‘To hell with Irene Adler,’ Sherlock repeated as he nibbled on John’s earlobe and John swallowed loudly. ‘You are
He was asleep in less than 5 minutes.
(12:46) How do you think I could help you? SH
Sherlock swallows against the sudden dryness in his throat as something painful tugs in his chest. He hasn’t even met the boy, yet he’s afraid of losing him. Sherlock scolds himself inwardly for his moment of weakness. He has to pull himself together. He is Sherlock Holmes. He doesn’t care, can’t care about John. Caring is not an advantage, and Sherlock knows it.
(14:15) You’d be surprised. SH
‘If this is about Irene Adle-‘
[14:36] Mary! I had a great time too. Did I really sing Bohemian Rhapsody in front of everyone? Dinner sounds good. JW
(14:55) I’m not posh. SH
John Watson was a humble man; he was a decent shot, he considered himself considerate, average looking, and he was patient. In fact, he was incredibly patient, considering the fact that he was living with the world’s only consulting detective, Sherlock Sodding Holmes.
Meet the writers!
"Yes, yes. I know all that. But what is your intention with my baby brother?"
(03:51) Oh dear god. Don’t you have GPS in your mobile? SH
(12:51) It really isn't. SH
It wasn’t like him to be reduced to this mess. Normally he would shrug it off and soldier on, bracing himself for whatever would be thrown at him, but about
(14:44) Not in those either. SH
John was so desperate to find out more about Sherlock; he wanted to understand him. He had a primal urge to do so. But he was also afraid of what he might see.
(17:18) Yes, that's what I said. A consulting criminal. SH
(22:33) Oh god. You actually got a tattoo? SH
"You'll thank me later," Sherlock said in his usual cocky tone, ending the call without saying goodbye.
(16:36) Yes. SH
Mortified, Sherlock tried to ignore his racing heart and the heat creeping into his cheeks, trying to convince himself that his body's reaction was just a normal response to a sudden, unexpected sound of a text message, and had nothing to do with the fact that someone who might actually like him had contacted him. It was unlike him to react that way to a simple text message, and just thinking about what his older brother would say if he saw Sherlock now made his cheeks redden even more.
(16:44) What are you talking about? SH
Greg was about to take a sip of his coffee when his mobile phone buzzed for the fifth time in the past fifteen minutes. Even without looking, he knew exactly who was bothering him during his usual mid-morning coffee break. Sighing with resignation, he paused his coffee cup in mid-air and reached in his pocket for his phone. He knew there was no use trying to ignore Sherlock Holmes. He had learned the hard way that if he didn't reply to his texts, the boy would find another way to contact him--Sherlock had once stormed into his office during an important meeting with his boss when Greg had not answered his numerous calls.
“Why not? Might as well see you before I end up in a desert in God-knows-where.”
(12:38) You can always ask. SH
"Err... why not?"
‘Shhh, Sherlock. It’s okay, it’s okay.’
(18:01) Do you? SH
(05:26) You’re bored, probably. SH
(10:34) It's not! They choose not to believe me although I'm right. I'm always right. But I lack proof! The killer's clever, cleverer than Scotland Yard. SH
(12:52) And to answer your question: no, I don't. SH
(05:10) And give up on medical school? SH
“You’re the only one who has it beside me.”
(04:41) Why? SH
(03:17) We don’t know that but it’s statistically more likely that it’s a man. SH
John’s heart fluttered a little at the comment. He sighed at himself.
But Sherlock is determined. He needs to solve the case, needs to find out why those people were killed, and finally put an end to this game. Moriarty’s game. Just thinking his name sends a shiver down Sherlock’s spine, and makes his heart lurch uncomfortably in his chest. The man is a psychopath. Sherlock has never encountered anyone as dangerous as him, and how thrilled would he be to play the game, to study Moriarty, and the brilliant, albeit horrifyingly evil, mind of his if it weren’t for the fact that it isn’t only Sherlock’s life on the line anymore. Hell, he wouldn’t care if it cost him his life. No. The world would probably be better off without him and his rude and obnoxious self. Mycroft would be overjoyed if his annoying baby brother weren’t there to burden him anymore, of that Sherlock is sure, and his parents would be relieved if they wouldn’t have to worry about their failure of a son anymore.
Waiting for John’s reply, Sherlock stares at the screen for three minutes, watching the numbers change, and then puts the phone back in his pocket, assuming that John has finally fallen asleep. He needs to get back to his room, needs to get some sleep. Rising from the chair he’s been sitting on, Sherlock leaves the café and waves down a cab to take him home.
He turns, and just before the light goes out in front of his eyes, he swears he sees gorgeous dark curls lining a worried frown.
He worried for both Sherlock and John, and had tried to think of ways to help them, but it had seemed like there was nothing he could do to save the two boys from themselves. But maybe he had been wrong, maybe there was something he could do. Maybe instead of giving Sherlock what he wanted and putting his own job and career in danger, he could "accidentally" mix up the victim's phone number with John's, and thus avoid any prison time and possibly even bring two people together, two people in need of a friend.
(18:46) The name’s Sherlock. SH
(03:27) Which part of it? You missing me or you having something in your eye? Might want to have a licensed doctor take a look, I'm hardly qualified. SH
(04:46) I’m calling the police. SH
Sherlock knew he was being reckless, but the strong arm holding him close and the delicious smell of the man's cologne were clouding his judgement.
(03:37) John. SH
(03:45) Please don't guess. H
"You are weird."
He came with Sherlock’s name on his tongue, spilling his come on Sherlock’s hand and cock. Sherlock shortly followed and bit down on his neck hard as he came. It would leave a mark.
"Sher-Sherlock, please, ah fuck, I want to fuck you," that certainly earned him a pause from the lustful detective as he removed John from his mouth.
"Sorry but I-"
"Because, it's
"Mmh whatever you say, John," but he didn't bother making a move to exit the room.
"It's not a trick, however I try to convince you but believe me it's not a trick,"
“If it weren’t for you and your stupid work, daddy would have still remembered me! This is all
love her. I was about to propose to that woman and make her my wife and you ruined that, you know that?"
"Well, I just happened to be locked up because I was careless. Just this once," Lestrade just hummed an answer. Seemingly like he wouldn't give out a verbal, more clear words, Sherlock continued the conversation further. "It's a funny thing; all of you said I worked for the law. But Moriarty made me the best
“I told you before, and I will tell you a thousand times more. Yes, I am happy you are here and that you are special to me,” he let go of Sherlock’s arm and look away in resignation.
“Mycroft, where is Sherlock? Why did Mrs. Hudson say that Sherlock isn’t gonna be in 221B for at least a few months more?”
Maybe being the best assassin known from the underworld doesn't help Sherlock escape the intellect of his own brother, Mycroft Holmes. Every flight will eventually experience its fall, and so does the glory days of Sherlock's assassin identity.
"Sherlock, are you sure about this mission? It's in London," Sherlock was double-checking his equipment to go to London for a mission that had recently came in to Moriarty.
"But that's a positive thing, right?"
to not be dead, doesn't want him back... Then how would everyone else react?
It was already dark by the time he got tired from all the emotions. He was basically drained. If it weren’t for the streetlamp, he would’ve relocate himself to another place. But the absence of life there was enough reason despite the dim light for him. Alone.
“All these times, these two hands did so much more damage to you than the oppos-” before he could finish, Sherlock grabbed his hand, startling him.
“Then why are you still here, John? If you insist so much at cutting ties with me, then why are you here? I honestly don’t need any more abuse from anyone at this point,” his words may or may not soften John a bit. It could just be an act of pity, but he lowered his voice from the shouting pitch and lightly touched his knees, clarifying what he believed was wrong.
"Why, Sherlock? I needed to finish showering and you interrupted me halfway,"
? As in..." he sighed and averted his gaze towards the ceiling of the white cell. "Stop playing with me. If you are indeed
“Sherlock, listen to me, please,”
"Now can we please go get the chips you were talking about? I'm starving,"
“It’s my married life, now, Sherlock! I don’t need any of these to the point that it will somehow drag Mary along to our cases! Plus, you don’t need me anyway. I’m just watching you work from the side,” he sighed after the last word, tired. If the hurt Sherlock felt was showing on his face, John didn’t comment on it or he just didn’t bother seeing it.
“I know,”
" he pressed his lips together and after a few moments, he pulled up his sleeves to show a still-healing carving of the letters 'J' and 'W' with a delicate knife. "
"Sherlock!" he just hoped this git would keep his mouth shut for once about his choice of dates.
"Do you... want to
“I have my reasons. One of it being that you’re too busy to be of company anymore,”
“If you’re sure about this, about
"I didn't lie the first time. I'm not a malingerer, for fucks sake, John," he rolled his eyes but that stupid movement only made his headache worse.
It's not the end of the fic ;) but I can't promise you when I'll be able to update. But not too long, hopefully. I'm stuck in preparing for a family holiday/getaway and I'll be back to uni afterwards :')
"No don't bother. This is just a way for you to insinuate your guilt for nearly screaming at me about your wife's death but will endlessly mention it when you're want to get an information out of me," Maybe a little too harsh, but every person have their limit that they can't ignore even if the person in front of you is your whole world.
“I married Mary, because she helped me through the grieving period. Se kept me grounded and prevented me from doing uninmaginable things,”
“Let’s go home, Sherlock.” He hid his red-rimmed eyes and just nodded to the request and leans into the touch.
"Sherlock?" John called out with a soothing tone. Mrs. Hudson must've warned him beforehand. Sherlock wanted to respond, call out his name as soothing as John did with his, but his voice was stuck at his throat. All he could manage was a raspy hum, just to indicate his whereabout.
That morning, Mary had reminded John again about visiting Sherlock. And this time, the reminder worked because he felt so bloody guilty. He was being too harsh to Sherlock, to the closest friend he had ever got the chance to have, and then he pushed the man away out of spite. John gave a quick kiss to Mary, reassuring her that he's off to Baker Street, before eventually leaving in a cab. It's a decent distance to the old flat, or else he'd cycle over.
Like what happened in the hospital, both their reaction was more or less the same. A gasp and a slow whimper. And Sherlock just rolled his eyes at this. Pathetic. The wound looked more prominent now after all the ointments were put. The colour of red more vibrant from it drying, and the outline of every scar and torture is obvious since it was cleaned. A lot of whip marks and also knife tracks. A few cigarette burns and something unmistakenably like a heated metal used to mark meats. The worst part is that most of them are fairly fresh.
He's trembling on his bed, the crook of his arm itching to feel a sharp needle pierce through and his body felt like being compressed from bone to bone until it's breaking just like how his mind was. Breaking, and a complete mess. Information passed in lightning speed in his mind, difficult to catch up on what's happening but the most repetitive thought had always been about his ex-flatmate. He tried to stand up and walk to the kitchen where Mrs. Hudson had kept his painkillers and aspirin. It doesn't help, but it's at least made the withdrawal more bearable.
John actually stopped paying attention towards Mycroft from the part where he mentioned that Sherlock Holmes was never dead.
"So I can finish my job, is why,"
“Well, yes of course. I thought that was fairly obvious?”
"We are not having this conversation,"
doctor, Holmes,” the man under him said in such disgusting pride enveloping the words, while holding out a…ring. God forbid Sherlock to decapitate the man then and there, but he needed to be justified for everything else he had done to countless others. So he opted for shouting for the Yard’s assistance.
" He's ready to break the glass down, even if it's hopeless to escape but he was desperate by now.
Easy said for someone who people favours because they're not weird.
He needed the actual truth but not even his mind could comprehend which one is to be believed.
Sherlock had made many possibilities all planned out in perfect plots in his head about what John was about to tell him, but he hadn’t anticipated this particular tension in the air, and a confession hanging in between them.
“Oh, you’re a new one. The other apparition would just…mock away and blame me for everything,” he sighed and closed his eyes.
happen! And you might think "oh it's okay because I could've die for real" but that just doesn't bloody justify anything!" he sighed, trying to regain his patience. "Still stubborn, you are. Why is it so difficult to digest the fact that there are actual people out there caring for you and that they didn't want to mourn only once because you could have died again, no, we prefer not to mourn at all!"
“Your welcome,”
"He did apologize. You didn't listen," Mary gave a small smile before giving him a pat on the shoulder. "Go check on him later, John".
“We can’t say for sure, Mr. Holmes. But from the looks of it, he would recover soon, positively. Further details can only be known after the surgery and treatment,” Sherlock just nodded, not knowing what else he could do after receiving that news. Every second felt like it had extended into hours. His heart was beating so fast, it could had been enough to beat for the both of them, but that wasn’t a plausible option, no matter how much he wanted to do that.
"You alright with this? Just that you are unusually quiet. I mean... Mrs. Hudson is out and all today and I thought you'd be more... vocal," it's not something you hear everyday, nor it was a common day-to-day question during an intimate moment like this but it was their first time and they were in a way
"You're so tight, so right for me," he grunts while moving his hips slowly, still letting John be accustomed to his length inside of him. A few groans were released from John's mouth as he forcefully pull Sherlock in for a lustful, deep kiss and giving love promises in the midst of moans and intelligible cries. His hands were pinned down to the sides of his head by Sherlock's strong grasp that doesn't budge even one iota.
Sherlock could only looked at the door which John went through, feeling a bit guilty. He never knew what kind of comments were necessary or not, kind or not. But considering John's annoyed reaction, maybe he didn't do a good job at it. Trying to tune out the thought, he went back to his simple research and tried to get this case done and over with soon.
Sherlock's smile started to go away, but the slight upturn of his lips were still present from the little hope he have left. He can fix this.
Somehow, just somehow, those little quirky comment from the landlady had brought up a thought in John's mind. A very specific colour, a specific flower, and a specific dressing. He remembered Sherlock once muttered to him about the Victorian flower language. Maybe a small part of Sherlock had hoped John remembered about the short lesson on it, and he did. God he did, and he was utterly glad he did. Mrs. Hudson was a tad confused on the sudden light of realization on John's face, and the immediate action of him going towards Sherlock's handwritten note about the flowers. He flipped through the pages until he saw a scribbly outline of a flower closely resembles the Azalea, and sure enough, the title confirmed it.
"PUT YOUR WEAPONS DOWN! YOU'RE SURROUNDED!" Sherlock swallowed a smart remark to say 'don't bother pointing out the obvious' because it'll somehow set a bomb onto himself at this point. It's embarrassing to be in such situation when he'd been so cautious all these times to successfully escaped the radar of higher authorities. He muttered a curse under his breath, and squinted a bit when he scanned the whole pack to assess how many they were but obviously too many for him to take out in such a small place when crowded.
He hated it when the weather forecast had a completely different prediction that his, but maybe this time he was rather regretful that he didn't take heed of it. Because now, he's freezing in his car in the middle of a stakeout. The car was stuck a while back when he was stalking his suspect but if he needed to chase him again, he'd need to wait until he had help from anyone passing by but the next person might pass by by the time he froze to death, so he looked over to the houses and spotted one that was still lit.
As ever, the landlady urged Sherlock to eat more, but unlike in the past, she urged because she was worried. Sherlock looked thin,
“Shh Sherlock, just let it all out. It’s okay, it’s just me.” And with just that, Sherlock clenched onto the fabric of John’s jacket and hid his face in the crook of his neck before letting all the tears fall. When his breathing started to even out, he placed the cold cheeks in between his small hands gave the most reassuring smile he could make out before speaking once more,
"Can you just wait?"
“Wh- Sherlock what did you say? I’ve known you long enough to know something happened, so prepare the damn tea, sit down and tell me what’s wrong,”
John nodded at the man and looked at Lestrade. He was clearly nervous, because what if the man from the car wasn't lying? What if, upon entering the room, they would see Sherlock sitting in a chair with a very neutral and relaxed face. Lestrade looked back at John and pushed the door open for the both of them, because at this point no one was going to do it. Upon entering however, he just wished he could go back when he saw who was inside. John would have agreed to his thoughts if he had said it out loud, he was sure of it because he heard John sighed in annoyance but also in relief. A conversation with Mycroft wasn't anywhere near
"How?! Tell me how he saved you, Sherlock, because just look at you! You are skinnier than you've ever been, you're dangerously pale that I know if I were to take your hand, it would be ice cold. Now tell me, how the
“She’s a smart woman, John. Even I wouldn’t deny that, just as much as I wouldn’t deny that she must have seen your attraction towards me since you both met. She must understand the situation. We’ll make things work,” Midway in the sentence, he put one hand on John’s cheek and smiles reassuringly. John put his own palm on top of Sherlock’s large, dainty hand.
, though a certain someone prefer the name 'Ice Man' on you. Aged 41, unofficially. A minor position in the government but big enough of a position to threaten my employer," Sherlock's deep baritone voice was clearly heard by Mycroft, who was reading a book cross-legged on a chair outside of Sherlock's cell while Sherlock didn't move from his bed and kept looking out to the man in a fairly expensive outfit, fitting for a political man, who's family was a country squire.
“Where’s John? Tell me! What did you do to him?!” he asked in between grunts of pain.
"Sherlock?"
“Well, it seemed that you were happy with Mary and I was just ruining things, as usual. Classic Sherlock, huh,” he scoffed at this, as if making fun of himself. This, of course wasn’t the remark John was expecting from Sherlock. He didn’t know what would go through that genius brain of Sherlock, but he certainly didn’t expect death. In shock, he grabbed Sherlock by his arms and looked into his eyes, trying to make him believe whatever it was he was about say.
a fix, but everyone that still cared enough tend to remind him that this would've angered John.
“As I was saying, John, the case. I’ve been assigned to investigate a possible terrorist attack and these pictures are all my rats. My markers. If one moves, I’ll know. If she buys another grocery, I’ll know. If he walks his dog, I’ll-”
He took his time replying to Sherlock’s text. That had only made Sherlock more anxious because obviously the next text was well thought out and may be risky.
“I shouldn’t say anything to
"I-I don't understand. John, but we-" he stuttered, uncommon for Sherlock, but that wasn't in John's attention at the moment. Why does it matter?
“In love… with… who?”
"Shit Sherlock, just go faster- I just want you, all of you," and so he did what he asked. He increased his pace and began licking the sides of John's neck, making a few bruises while at it, relishing himself with the vibrations from John's throat when he made all those wonderful sounds, and he was thirsty for more. He raised one of John's leg and rest it on his shoulder before he started to push himself deeper and harder into John while moving his hips to find a better angle. At one point, John suddenly bucked hard and arched his back and he saw white in full pleasure.
Sherlock grunted and turned to his back, tired of playing the game with this man and mumbled under his breath, "Jim would send someone to break me out soon". He turned back to Mycroft and asked about the unsettling familiarity he felt in his office.
A few hours passed, and it's finally time for Lestrade to look at Sherlock after two years. This may or may not be the sarcastic, smart-arse man that helped him in the yard over the years. He grabbed the tray that was handed to him and walked towards Sherlock's room. Upon arriving, the first thing he did was to put the tray through into Sherlock's cell.
"You'll get used to it, don't worry. I know you will. Though I might not get used to being unable to walk after sex,"
It felt almost eternal in the car, but in reality it was only approximately 25 minutes. Finally the minutes were up and he reached a part outside London that seemed rather abandoned except a very white, properly structured and guarded building. He looked around to see the car drove away so he proceeded to walk closer to the building to see a man looking as lost as he was, so he approached him, pat him once on the shoulder thinking that he could help him, only to see it was his own friend, Lestrade.
John. Was he as anxious as he is? Usually he’d be dead asleep by now, not staying awake worrying about him. He couldn’t help from forming a slight smile at the thought of a caring John Watson. The John he fell for.
"I'm waiting for Mycroft to get me. I'm dropping the case," he turned to John and looked at him up and down. "It's a little too close to inconveniences," he diverted his sight to the empty view, and as if on cue, the recognizable black car pulled up in front of him.
“I just hope so. I don’t want to risk losing you nor Rosie,”
"Didn't say,"
“You could tell me, please. I’m your… friend,” he uttered the last word in a lower tone, as if he wasn’t sure if that term was still valid between them. But Sherlock had decided that distractions was his go-to solution out of the conversation.
"Sherlock? Are you... high? Right now?" both of them frowned at this question.
That was as far as it was for Azalea flower, unfortunately. But it started to get clear in his mind. He eventually found more explanations further in the leather bound notebook about colours. And above all the explanations, he emphasized about how if the colour is familiar to the flower, it could just mean it's coincidentally paired or it meant that the message one is sending through the flower should be commonly recognized, as if it had existed for a long while. John sighed before he proceeded reading the texts, trying to make sense of everything.
"Tell me if it hurts, John. Don't need no injured soldier here," advised Sherlock when he positioned himself at the entrance.
Some fluff at the end to tone down the heated tension I faced when writing so enjoy :)
"Not necessarily the old one, but we just don't know you anymore at this point. We just want you to be yourself again. Not this... brainwashed version,"
"You're special, John, and I can't emphasize that enough. When people see the sky, you see the stars, and when people see a freak, you see... an emotional human," Sherlock gave a genuine smile at this before continuing, "The people you went out with wont acknowledge this marvelous quality of yours because they don't see how rare it is, but
"We lived together in Baker Street, with Mrs. Hudson as our landlady. You solve crimes and I blog about it apart from giving second opinions. Almost everyday a client would appear on our doorstep or send a letter of request about interesting cases because you would not second glance a dull one. People come to you, because you were
Usually when he sees Sherlock’s Belstaff flowing gracefully behind the slim figure, he’d be happy, ecstatic and filled with adrenaline. But that day, John was as frantic as ever as he saw the figure ducked under the yellow police tape, hands in his coat pockets and moving towards the nearby park. It was definitely hard to catch up with Sherlock’s long strides but when he eventually managed to approach Sherlock, they were under a shady tree and it was nearing sunset hour. Before he could say anything, he saw Sherlock igniting a cigarette and blowing long puff of smoke in one long breath.
"Ha- I want-
But she smelt of hot sex. Her plump breasts brushing against his arm and her dainty fingers delicately moved across his chest was an attempt of arousal, which only worked in his imagination because subconsciously, his hand found its way to his semi-hard cock. When he was about to relief himself, the door to the bathroom clicked open, which cause him to be shocked and instinctively pulled the shower curtain to hide his body, although not his silhouette.
“I… I don’t know… Sometime around Rosie’s Christening?” Rosie was already hiding her face in the crook of her elbow, trying hard to not sob nor cry, while Sherlock was gently rubbing her back.
This chapter (and maybe a few more ahead) could be highly frustrating because we're dealing with denial, confusion and misplaced affection of the greatest mind of Britain. It's a mild frustration (or major, however you take it) for most but an entertainment for me, so do keep anticipating for more
"I really did thought he was dead when I lost track of him. But now he's back, and he had flashbacks, fragments of memories from the past," he turned to John midway the sentence, "and he had even written your initials on his sleeves, reacted positively to a picture of you and your name. I believe, if we go see him on our own assigned time to talk to him or just simply spend time with him, the brainwash effect could fade away slowly," he sighed as he relaxed his shoulders significantly. The verbal conversation had drained so much, he wondered how much it would tire him to actually commit to this
"John stop it you're making me so red!" And he was self conscious about it too, because not everyday the great Sherlock Holmes would deduce the heat rising up to his face was out of embarrassment and not in anger or frustration. More laughs filled the air when John made Sherlock blush more and Sherlock was continuously pouting and playfully sulking at him and hiding his face in the crook of John's neck.
"You're wearing too many clothes," he said as he pulled on the elastics of John's clothes. John was as eager to rid off his clothes as much as Sherlock was because the strain of his half-hard girth was uncomfortable being under layers of cotton. With a smirk at the remark, he swiftly pulled his jumper off and John took his opportunity to pull of Sherlock's pants as well, excited to savor the look of Sherlock's nudity and the sultry look he had. Though John was still in his pants, Sherlock smirked and licked his lips at what he sees. The sturdy frame of a soldier with the web-like scar on his left shoulder was perfect, ornamented by the defined muscles down to his navel.
It's been too long since he had lost contact with him. Since the fall, to be exact. News had arose that he had been seen again but he didn't have time for a search party for him when a murderer was at loose, killing all these high-ranked people.
"Sherlock? Sherlock! Open the door!" Greg raised his voice to make sure it reached wherever Sherlock was on the other side, frantically turning the locked doorknob.
"Of course, as if your two years of excursion did me good,"
"Why is it that
“Hmm? It’s rather inappropriate to be discussed in front of food items. Are you sure you want to know? It’s not… important,”
"I was on a case, and the snowstorm got in the way,"
"I'm okay, because I want
“Any tea would be great, if you’ll tell me what happened to you while we’re at it,”
"But you should". Sherlock looked annoyed that this person was insisting something he clearly doesn't want nor need, so he turned his head to tell whoever that was to piss off and leave him alone, only to see a familiar face. Eyes widen in shock, he stood up abruptly and walked slowly to the glass.
"Just kidding. No wound anywhere. Just wanted to get you out of shower,"
"Donovan was right, I should've stayed away from you since the first day and not be stupid enough to be pulled in, because all it ever did was bring me utter misery. Now tell me, you
He knew what John said was out of pure stress and anger because the volumes of his voice radiates from it. He felt it and wanted to cower in a corner because of the intensity of it. But those anger weren’t necessarily meant for Sherlock, it’s just that he was the only one present that he can express those distress onto. The one and only one present that relates to all of John’s source of anger. Maybe he truly was at fault. It was all his fault, his trigger. Maybe that’s true, but the thought of his efforts wasted just like that had been too painful. He had been too involved in this friendship, too invested in this friendship because… he had hoped at one point that it would blossom into something more. Once before. Before Sarah, before Jeanette, before Louise and before… Mary Morstan. Before all the desperate attempts at denying his sexuality by dating more and more women and ended up tying the knots with Mary, which ended with Sherlock being more or less the reason she’s gone. He can see why John was furious, at him. And now he’d been declared a freak by his John, he couldn’t see why he should actually keep hoping for something more. If he’s just a friend, the accusation would only seem like a tease but he wasn’t just a friend. He was an almost something. Almost, but just enough, because he doesn’t deserve more. A freak had no such privilege.
. But just a friendly reminder, Mycroft; you know damn well that I would gladly risk my life for Sherlock, if it meant to save him. It doesn't matter if I died, with or for him. Nothing mattered more to me than the bond we had. I was a lost, ex-army doctor without any familial relative except for my alcoholic sister and was craving the warzone.
“Probably a bit too cliched. Although this isn’t much of my expertise, but yet I know quite well that JohnWatson, I am truly in love with you,” John stayed static.
"Stop trying to win the argument,"
buck his hips and fuck Sherlock's mouth when he started to take John in his mouth, bobbing in an even rhythm. Every now and then he takes John all in and the vibrations he felt at the back of Sherlock's throat was so stimulating, he couldn't help arching his back and accidentally thrust in his mouth in which Sherlock had to forcefully hold his hips down to the mattress once he choked a bit on the sudden movement. Once he's gotten better control of the situation, Sherlock began to tease his balls with his free hand and his perinulum with his tongue every time he takes it all in.
"That doesn't really answer the question, Sherlock," he turned his head towards the taller man, and Sherlock stopped in his tracks, turning so both of them were properly facing each other.
"Look at you, such a masterpiece. And now you're mine," Sherlock commented before climbing on top of him like a predator that found itself a prey, teasingly runs his hand up and down John's body but avoiding the sensitive area.
"Oh Sh-Sherlock, don't fucking stop. Please,"
the most important person to Sherlock back then, and not even he comes close to the rank in Sherlock's mind.
“Sherlock. Can you talk to me? Please?” And with that, Sherlock turned his head slowly and squinted at the sight of John.
? I don't even remember much of you but I really did missed you," he looked confused by his own statement. "Being in London gave me the warmth but being beside Jim makes me feel proud of myself but... I don't think he's coming for me anymore,"
Mycroft tensed immediately at John's reaction and looked down at his hand, staying silent for a few because what John said was right, so he tried to construct a plan forth. Pushing aside the generic cold and arrogant persona, he switched it up with a warmer approach and his eyes was not anymore lack of emotion. It was full of empathy for his dear brother.
"I didn't know why he chose these flowers. It's a bit hard to find in florists. Should've just gave me sunflowers or lilies and I would take care of it just the same," she continued, muttering the word in a confused but appreciative tone. Like ones they'd use when finding some efforts too far-fetched or if someone does to extra length for no reason.
“I’m sorry?”
John was bewildered of what to do. How to react. Who wouldn’t be, if they heard such angry confession in their face? Sherlock was clenching his hair, making it into an array of mess, when John tried to reach for one of his arms.
Just before he went to hop in the car with a case of clothes and necessity tools, he went to give another bouquet of the same flowers to Mrs. Hudson, less flowers in this one though. Making it look less lively, and a bit empty. Both were wrapped in a way that visualizes and represents the Victorian era for some reason. He explained to Mrs. Hudson, just briefly, enough for her to get the idea for the second bouquet.
After god knows how long he had been unconscious, his eyes finally fluttered open and his senses started to come back one by one, functioning gradually until he could feel the ache all over his body. He finally decided to look around and realized he was on a white bench-like bed (as if the ones in the hospital) in an all-white room, with his own all-white outfit. His previous clothes was neatly folded beside him on the bed and all his weapons,
"John, if this is some kind of trick, I'm not buying it," John smiles sadly as he brought Sherlock's hand in his grip to his mouth and brush a gentle kiss on his knuckles, in which he didn't take too well when he tensed up. Probably just shocked at the sudden action.
Sherlock just stood there in awe, feeling his heart shatter knowing that these two years just as painful for John as it is for him. He wanted to be selfish, saying that John doesn’t understand what he went through but he wouldn’t want to add salt to the wound. But he was all in all, stubborn, anyway. It was something he couldn’t simply resist because it was built into his character. A stupid feature that comes with this genius machine.
"I said sorry, didn't I?" Sherlock muttered and muffled through the tissue he had held to his nose. The Glassgow kiss wasn't at all necessary, personally. But then again, John is a hot headed man. But Sherlock just don't get it. What's there to be mad about. He explained the gist of the plan, informed of the terrorist attack and said sorry.
“Rosie, wha-” abruptly, he stopped when he felt a weight on his head, which can only be…
, on a daily basis. She was scared for him, worried too, a lot because at this point she was like a biological mother for him. Oh she was scared that at one point, she'd lose him. And truth be told, her fear might come true.
“Oh,” the unwavering chilly baritone voice spoke out eventually while holding his gaze onto John’s.
"Trying to freshen up," there's a sound of a cap being opened. Probably the toothpaste's tube.
He wiped the perspiration on his temple with the back of his hand.
with a smile on his face, huh. What am I supposed to do here? What are
"Why me?"
The man in the black suit was obviously not pleased in any way about him speeding up the street because he chased after him and pointed a gun at him, forcing him to turn back to the car and get in. He finally complied when threatened like so.
He walked slowly, almost as if scared a quick movement would trigger another row, back to the kitchen and tried his best to focus on the drop of sample on a glass slide. But he was clearly only looking blankly into the microscope when his mind was full of worst case scenario about his relationship between him and John if the conversation were to happen again,
It was funny, that during the questioning on the supposed victim's home, one lady who claimed to be the victim's roommate, she took the opportunity to flirt with him. Out of all places, she did it in a venue very close to home for the victim in this case. It was unsettling for sure, and maybe she sensed his uneasiness because she gave her number to him. Deep inside, he wanted to call her when people were busy in the yard and maybe run for a bit to meet with the lady but it ended up the flirt was just a trick to divert the attention from her. She was seducing John because she was the culprit herself.
"Sure. Food will be served normally. Breakfast, lunch, dinner. And I will try to come often to see how you're doing. Goodbye, brother mine," a short speech, but enough as a parting speech. He left the room, leaving Sherlock in the blank white space for him to finally breathe and think properly.
“It would have been too risky. I wouldn’t have risked your life, John. It would have been better if you believed that I died to make it more believable to the public view and to Moriarty’s snipers, and if… I had actually… died in those two years,” He had said it as soft as he could. But from the look of John’s eyes widening in horror indicated that maybe any attempt to lower his volume in an empty, silent room wouldn’t be any help anyway.
to tell you. I know you will not quite like them, but do keep in mind that I had no choice but to do this," he said this while looking utterly resigned.
Mycroft took his time to find proper words before responding to the anger he had expected from either of them. "We just couldn't. We just couldn't possibly risk your life. And as I said, if we had informed you earlier, it would have resulted in jeopardy for both you
"Whatever you think, Sherlock," John went back to the small table where he placed the food tray and put the tray through a slot that allowed any sort of item to be transferred to the inside of Sherlock's cell, before leaving without even a goodbye.
“Why?”
"The work doesn't come first," he pressed each word with emphasis.
, disbelief. Time seemed to speed up afterwards, and the whole restaurant was reduced to a loud mess. Half of them are pulling John away from Sherlock that was pushed on the floor, and only a few bothered checking up on Sherlock. Guess a raging moustached man is more priority than the man groaning on the floor out of surpressed pain. None of the discussions that came after went well, anyway. Sherlock first was gifted with a split lip, and now a bloody nose. What went wrong? For Sherlock, it's Mary. For John, it's Sherlock.
?" Okay so it's settled that he was for sure going on a date with Sherlock. He seriously thought it was just the lack of knowledge for these kind of things for Sherlock that he used the term 'go out' but maybe he knew more than he expected.
John however still calmed her down, saying how Sherlock was always unpredictable his whole life. And he will continuously be unpredictable, sending cryptic messages every now and then. And maybe come back to life like he did a week ago. John felt like he wasn't privileged enough to kind of shed a tear or feel sad, because in a way, he played a part in scaring Sherlock away from the comfort of 221B. But the least he can do was make it up to him by leaving open arms for him if he were to come back again. Resurrect in any given time. And hopefully this time, he wont get a punch in the face. They both knew Sherlock couldn't walk away just like that. He just needs time for himself and they respect the decision. And they respect it by not being stuck in their emotions, and to talk about the brighter memories together, hoping they'd have the opportunity for more of that again in the future.
not at the wedding? You're John's best man. I should be the one asking you that" Greg mused and only just noticed the burning end of the cigarette between Sherlock's delicate fingers. He really could only internally shake his head at that because he suspected, no,
"No. You told me that I always wanted to win in an argument without you realizing you're always doing the same! For once, stop this. I'm tired. I'm going to rest in bed," Sherlock was frowning and just pure rage and disappointment across his face. He wanted to let the apology sink in but he felt like a complete and utter trash for coming back to someone who's moved on and now is planning to marry another person.
"Sherlock, you don't need to ask. You can have all the chance you need," Sherlock smiled at this and placed a feather-light kiss on top of John's head.
"Three days ago, Sherlock was sent to kill political figures, including me, and he didn't even knew me. Fortunately, we managed to apprehend him and he is now
John, for the second, even ditched his anger and look almost sympathetic towards Sherlock when he realized the hesitation in his statement but he was still expecting an answer. He can't
”You were the only one,”
“For slowly letting me in back in your life. I was so scared to lose you,”
“Sherlock. I’m sorry. I mean it,” he said while keeping his hand on top of the bandaged arm.
“Sherlock! It got to the point I didn’t want to eat or leave my house, I might as well die along with you!” He shouldn’t have shouted but he was getting frustrated at this conversation. Sherlock just stepped back. In guilt? In shock? Seemed like an accumulation of every single emotion logical in this situation.
fucking smile. 'I'm happy for him', was what he spoke most of all the whole wedding and reception, and it was true. He was indeed happy for his best friend, John Watson and his newlywed wife. But he had hoped that it took a different turn. Though in all candor, that will never happened. Sherlock Holmes, as always, will end up last and most of all, alone. 'Alone is what I have. Alone protects me', was now a mantra for him, making him feel less like a failure to actually be wed by—no, no. Don't think about that.
this all was a bit too much for him right now, but it's necessary.
the assassin was inside, most probably waiting for Mycroft to casually come back to the office. After a few straining seconds, they hear a faint code from their earpieces indicating a safe go to proceed further. The leading guy knocked on the door, as if he was just a messenger passing important notes to Mr. Holmes.
“I don’t want to ruin more than I already did. You’re married, John. You need to figure that part out,”
All the italics wouldn’t show in the fic when I posted em IDK why. Helppp
“You might want to hold on to that for the heat,”
"Oh John! I thought I'd never see you again! Did you propose to her yet?" Shit. He forgot he told Mrs. Hudson.
Sherlock was right, in a way. To not be appreciated for something as simple as that was a bit frustrating at times, because it sometimes would felt like a for-benefit kind of relationship when all that was focused on was the noticeable and major qualities anyone could see from a distance.
Now he was partly convinced that he was just a pitstop for John to distract himself with because of his lonely life. Maybe he was just a tool for John, too. Now that he wasn't experiencing the post-war depression, Sherlock was thrown like a banana peel when he found a decent lady the second he was roaming around like a fully functioning man.
is amazing," he gave a small smile. "She helped me a lot, especially when I was mourning and was falling hard after Sherlock's supposed death. She's just heaven sent". They knew that they should be talking about the more pressing matter on hand, but they needed the distraction, even just for a fraction of second.
to prompt a drugs bust for his sake. Earlier that week, the drugs bust attempt really was of no use because Sherlock, who was practically living in lowkey wealth, could always acquire a new batch of drugs. Today was his routine visit to see how the man was.
Just when he was about to let the fate wash over him, the door swung open in a force that could only indicate that someone had kicked it open. Fuck—
Not the reaction he was expecting, but Lestrade froze upon contact and looked more startled that what he would deem necessary.
“I… I need space. Go home John. It’s almost dark and you need to pick up Rosie. I just need to… think,”
"I don't see why you should know. Just because you're my best friend, doesn't mean you can fish for any information from me, John,"
's the one trembling at what John maneuvered and frankly, that was a total turn on.
. Sherlock, please, because you are under
"My work was supposed to be dangerous, it's better if people think I'm dead so I can work well undercover, under various disguises,"
"I'm sure you talked with John Watson and is aware that I don't remember much about you. So tell me what I should know. What are you to me?" As if scripted. This must just be for his mental notes.
Walking out the NSY, he sees the supposed car waiting for him, and recognized everything of the car. The colour, the brand, and the tinted windows. Usually when this car came for him, it was because the other Holmes would want his help to track down Sherlock or help solve a little case involving Sherlock. It would all be about Sherlock. But why now? There's nothing to be spoken about after two years-Sherlock was
"Why are you here anyway?" he avoided the question entirely, and changed the direction of conversation. Pointless to talk about the injuries. If John were to only be nice to him after he saw the scars then what's the point? It'll just be misguided guilt and a false mask.
"I thought I was supposed to not care about my life," he took a long drag of his cigarette while hugging himself with his free hand.
He was about to complain but sucked his breath instead when he felt Sherlock's tongue on his nipple and his hand on John's now-hard cock. Fuck, Sherlock Holmes had made him rock hard in just mere seconds and now he's pleasuring him in the middle of the bathroom. He kept flicking his tongue from one nipple to the other and slowly moved his way down. John was curious by the lack of contact at first so he looked over only to see Sherlock pulling his pants fully off before looking at John through his eyelashes and wrapped his hand around John's penis. He could only mutter curses at the skill he had at pleasuring him.
"Wh-Fucking hell, Sherlock," he grunts in annoyance. Fucking idiot.
“John. Sorry I didn’t realized you arrived,” he said with a brief eye contact, as if to make sure he was not talking to a wrong person. John gingerly nodded at the statement and hand out the hot coffee to Sherlock, who grabbed it with his uninjured hand. A short contact of their fingers had made John feel relieved he brought some hot drink because he was as cold as a dead corpse in water, or in the morgue.
"What the shit," Lestrade mumbled under his breath and looked at the scotch, thinking that if such drink was served, then it probably would be a heavy kind of information to be given out. When Mycroft saw the two men in confusion and frustration about being there, he sighed and put the glass back on his table to straighten himself before putting both his elbows on the table, propping his chin on his hands.
"Then those lives can stay behind. I have Mary now. She's here for me, and you never did," John stepped forward slowly, his index finger just pushing at Sherlock's chest. If he were to lose control, he wouldn't give a single damn if his finger pierced the skin and damaged his heart-if he even have one.
I did expect this to be long, but it became longer than I anticipated but hope you got a good read of the burst of emotion of the characters in the story :)
He assessed the situation with his brainwashed brother and decided to finally let the cat out of the bag about his fake death to the three person he had saved from Moriarty. The efforts to restore what's left of the old Sherlock started, and frankly, it wasn't the best progress they expected. Sherlock was so fixated on the ideology Moriarty put onto him and sees the people he had loved the most now as his worst enemy.
"Wh- no!" he protested but the rise of volume caused him to cough a little too hard and John in hesitation from the previous flinch, rubbed his back in a feather-light touch. He left Sherlock's side for a quick trip to the kitchen and brought back a glass of warm water for Sherlock to ease his throat from the harsh and abrupt reflex. He nodded a gratitude before preparing himself for a continuation of the conversation when he saw John crouched down in front of him.
I'll listen,"
“Why is it such a big deal for you? Friends move on rather quickly, but you-” Shit. He can’t be caught off guard. Sherlock shouldn’t know the truth. It could hurt him more and he’s hurt enough by everything.
"Yes, the name is familiar. Now tell me, if
"Th-then you'll love every bit of today," he said in between pants, enjoying every moan that he manage to form from John's mouth.
the law. How does that even should coincide?"
John was unsurprisingly shocked by the fact Sherlock would even raise his voice at him. It was, in a way, how Sherlock wanted him to be. Shocked and horrified.
“You’re freezing but you won’t come back home,” it sounded like a plead, not an empty blame on him. Sherlock could only respond by ducking his head lower, in embarrassment. But he snapped his head back up when he felt a fabric being wrapped around his shoulders and saw John wrapping him in an extra scarf he had brought along with him there.
"Every word, Sherlock. Every word," by now, he sounds like a mother comforting a distressed child who was still hiding his face. Smiling softly, he stood up slowly and Sherlock pulled back from behind their hands, eyes rather glassy. John cupped Sherlock's face and just admired the emotion he missed on this beautiful face, thumbs ready to wipe any spilled tears from the verdigris eyes. Sherlock's face started to give a hint of pink blush from surpressed tears and embarrassment that he leaned forward to hide his face against John's chest, wrapping his arms around John's sturdy torso while John hugged him back, making soothing hand movements on his back and hold his head with the other hand. Maybe they wont be a perfect pair, always on and about keeping each others on their toes, but that's perfect enough for them.
“This isn’t a prank, is it? Or one of your cases?”
The voices rarely ever stopped now, and he had to take more than what he used to to keep the noises to a minimum.
get bored easily and I seem to be your entertainment,"
“How… did she die, Sherlock?” his voice was now shaking and somewhat stuck in his throat.
“No, Sherlock. Seriously, shut up. There’s a lady there traumatized because not everyday she sees a dead body like you do, and you going all impressed and going off on the criminal’s methods, it’s like you don’t give a shit about anyone’s feelings, not even me!”
"Why-When I entered your room, it seemed familiar. I don't get it,"
Greg didn't even had a room for any more words when Sherlock hastily took out the keys to his flat and practically slammed the door shut when he made his way in. Subconsciously, Greg had the growing weight on his shoulder, because at this point and moment, he might just be the only support system Sherlock had, because unlike Mrs. Hudson, he had witness the ugly truth of the danger nights.
“It’s not that I didn’t want to see you anymore, John, but upon my return it seemed that Mycroft was right as always. I was rather unwelcomed. You had… Mary,” Sherlock gave a pinched smile when he managed her name out of his mouth.
"Yes, but they're good news. Don't worry," he put down his empty glass of scotch. "We are getting married. Or at least that's what I hoped we could be. I already got a ring but didn't get a chance to propose to her yet".
John was taken aback by this burst of information and took his time to process everything. Lestrade, on the other hand took one of the prepared glass of scotch in front of him, and took a big sip before looking at Mycroft, Sherlock and the glass in his hands back and forth. He put the glass back down angrily and harder than necessary.
Drugs are liquid gold that runs through your veins, dancing with your blood in the streams under your skin. You don't need the adrenaline from running around London or the thrill of solving an impossible case to feel the bliss. All you need are syringes and pure crystals to blur your vision from the bad of the world.
“You know you do so much more. You’re my second opinion－an important remark,” he was getting stressed by the strain John was putting on their friendship. He took a pause before continuing his response just in hope to make John stop hurting him emotionally.
"Hey... How are you?" Starting off friendly. That's good. Right?
“Where were you during my pain and pleasure? You deem me as the machine, how would you know when to come in, right? Just like my two years of continuous captive-release, it wasn’t just some playful hide-and-seek, John! It was, frankly speaking ; TORTURE! And coming back to such a bloody welcoming from the only person you were eager to meet after two years, how would you deduce I felt? Huh, Mycroft was right, maybe I SHOULDN’T care to come back!”
“I’m trusting you,” John was hesitant but this was a chance Sherlock had given him, and he was more than happy to take it. He delicately brought the soft fabric around his neck, forming a loop on one end and tucking the loose end inside the loop.
"To a date,"
. Sherlock could feel John's presence nearing him and when he touched Sherlock's shoulder, he unintentionally flinched at the touch but didn't make any reassuring or apologetic eye contact afterwards anyway.
you could call it a date.
Grunting, he's quickly planned a quick escape from the room under their noses. Thankfully he spent the time scanning the room earlier quite thoroughly. In the midst of planning and frowning as he eliminated options that would be insufficient to flee, the team was startled by the loud voice in their earpiece.
“Believe what?” John asked, scoffing, because he thought that Sherlock was just playing him. Or maybe saying things out of pity.
John felt the hurt when Sherlock said he felt the bliss of pride when he was with Moriarty but he managed to maintain his composure. "You will stay here for a long time, Sherlock. You murdered more than one person, and god knows how many more that you did under all of our noses. And we will try to recover your memories".
"Why?"
“Sherlock?”
“Can’t you see, John? Finally some interesting case after so long! This is such a refreshment. An appetizer!”
For most people, the rays of sunshine peeking through the window and reflecting onto the wooden floors are the best part of waking up, accompanied by the smell of morning tea. But for Sherlock, it felt... blank. He knew there's feelings about waking up somewhere but above it all is a strong hollow feeling.It's unsettling. A part of him was relieved to wake up in comfort of a bed after for so long. But another part of him felt heavy, demotivated of everything. Like there's nothing he felt like he can do to perk up his own mood. And when he tried to figure out why, last night's incident just flashed in his mind. He regret thinking about it but no can do now.
The change of expression was noticeable. Even someone other than John would see it. It was quick, but clear-hurt, betrayal and pure sadness. And yet the doctor didn't want to comfort the detective, thinking that's what he deserved. Giving a taste of his own medicine.
John left the room where Lestrade was loyally waiting for him and a guard was already holding up a tray of lunch food for him to bring it to Sherlock's cell. The guard led him down a few floors and entered the third door on the left of the long hallway. He was finally in a room that connected directly to Sherlock's room. The guard had stopped leading him up until that room, and now he's alone behind the door to Sherlock. Sighing, he opened the door by scanning an authorization card and once inside, he noticed the off-white surrounding, barely a hint of colour except... except the raven curls on the bed. God, he was even as pale as the sheets. Bracing himself, he stepped closer to the glass barrier that kept Sherlock inside the confinement.
"It's Holmes. Mycroft Holmes," he continued when Sherlock wasn't offering any answer. But the revelation seemed to only made him more confused.
“I…I don’t know if you really want to hear about it because the two years of my pretentious death is as sensitive to you as it is to me to be discussed . But if you insist, I will give out what needs must,” John just looked at him with a gaze that clearly reflected the need to know. An intense need and concern for him. With a deep breath, Sherlock tried to explain as much yet as little as possible to him.
OK, so... smut. Obviously. This is the first time I actually written smut in detail and in a story (usually I censor as much as I can and cut it short to save my ass the pain) but here we go then.
really thought you were important, shouldn't he had already broken you out? It's been three days, Sherlock. No rescue team came for you," this could hurt him, but Sherlock needed to know the truth. He was being used.
Slowly, he put his arms around Sherlock and buried his face in Sherlock's shirt. He could tell Sherlock was a bit startled by the sudden action, but he did eventually wrapped his arms around John's shorter figure eventually and rest his chin on top of John's head. Sherlock let out a breath he hadn't realized he'd been holding and just kept John in his arms, as if letting go would means John would run off, but when John hugged him tighter, he was calmer.
"Come on, Sherlock. Make me shout," he said while moving his hand over his perspiration on his temple. Sherlock held John's waist as both of their hips meet repeatedly hard and every hit had sent them to a string of broken moans and breathless mumbles until John trembles under him.
"I waited for two years, only to come back to you moving on, to another person. A woman. Mary. And completely dejected me last night. What do you want me to wait more for?"
(02:37) Where is it now? SH
“No! No. I—er…Well, I imagined how you'd sound.”
(22:34) Why are you doing this? SH
(11:43) Thank me? SH
(04:12) That’s a good idea. SH
Sherlock clears his throat. "I'll try."
[14:47] I said stay out of this. I will never forgive you if you don't. SH
(12:10) She was worried where you'd gone yesterday. She called me. SH
(12:14) Have we ever talked? SH
(10:14) Of course. SH
"Your... guy?"
(07:09) I promise. SH
“John?”
Just as he pressed the send button, he realised, a fraction of a second too late, that he was texting a complete stranger.
‘Defiled, I kno-‘
(23:34) You have my word. SH
Taking his phone out of his pocket, Sherlock was about to save the man's number in his phone when he noticed a text from H. His meeting with Victor had made him forget about everything else, including his phone and H.
(04:43) Really? I would have thought people would stand in line to get to know you. H
(10:47) I’m not lying. SH
"Sorry, dad," was all he could muster. He hadn't even been out with any guys, but he knew better than to aggravate his dad further.
(06:47) What? Soothing? SH
(04:45) People generally leave me alone, and I'm fine with it. I'm fine being alone. I don't need anyone. SH
(20:15) I suppose you could say that. SH
(18:30) She's dangerous. I'm sorry, John. This is all my fault. I'm so sorry. SH
(05:55) No. Why would I be avoiding you? SH
(00:45) Drunk H
(06:08) Moriarty. SH
(11:35) I thought so. SH
(06:35) I’m always nice. SH
(10:07) We all do. SH
(22:16) Oh, nowhere. SH
(13:51) Why would you want to know where I live? Want to send me a thank-you card? SH
(11:27) John, are you alright? SH
(12:47) Clearly you have an idea. Just tell me. SH
(03:45) Thank you, Harry. SH
(10:06) You're already a lot better person than your father, John. You're nothing like him. SH
"Yet you were sneaking around his room like some perverted villain. I will be watching you, John Watson."
John contemplates texting Sherlock that he hates him, but he knows that it's not true. Instead, he throws his phone onto the floor hard and lets the silent tears well over his eyes and slowly fall down his face.
[15:58] I don't need rehab, but I'll go if you keep John alive. SH
(03:28) And what makes you think I’m not? SH
(02:35) Was it really necessary to break his nose? SH
~~*~~
(03:01) Ah, you’re protective of your sister. I shouldn’t be surprised. SH
And now here he was, loitering outside a nearby café, still completely and utterly bored, observing the passers-by to pass the time.
Silver stripes lined Sherlock’s pale back; there were narrow scars and broad ones, long ones and short ones. Some had healed poorly, John saw. Those were eerily pale and looked to be painful still. The rest had healed relatively well and showed no signs of previous infection. John couldn’t stop staring.
"John has a gun. I need you to confiscate it."
you sneak in on me?" he shouted, and John could smell the alcohol on his breath from all the way over the bed.
(06:02) I’m working on a case. SH
(00:03) What is up with you? SH
(11:14) It wouldn’t be if you had met me in person. SH
(03:43) I could always guess, but I can't be certain, unless you tell me yourself. SH
(22:18) I’m not. SH
(20:32) My first impression of you says otherwise. SH
(03:16) Obviously. SH
[23:33] It was rather difficult not to get involved. He posted a pic of my face on his website. It was a bit hard to ignore that. But I do see what you're saying. You were too stupid to get caught, and now I'm paying the price for your mistake. SH
(12:00) Oh. Is she alright? SH
(02:37) Wouldn’t it be more convenient to work out in a gym? SH
'Sherlock, I really do have more important things to do than to look after your pretend boyfriend' Mycroft replies with an exasperated sigh.
“Good night.”
‘To hell with Irene Adler,’ he growled fiercely. ‘You are mine.’
Sherlock chuckles, hoping John can’t hear the nervous tone in his voice. “I don’t know, John. I—I’m not sure if it’s a good idea.”
(06:05) Yeah, I'm here. Did you find anything, or does the website just keep crashing? SH
(11:07) Getting killed? By my brother? SH
He was so used to being in control of his emotions that he barely recognised himself, having always thought himself cold and calculating, the loner who would have his science books and Petri dishes but never experience his first kiss. But now here he was, craving contact with another human being, the mere thought of soft lips pressed firmly against his making his heart beat in anticipation.
(22:23) Yes well, I was hoping you'd tell me more about the meaning of roses. What they symbolise. Ancient tales. Everything. SH
Expecting some slimy douchebag, Sherlock wasn't prepared for the intense gaze looking back at him through impossibly long, dark eyelashes, sliding up and down Sherlock's body before settling on his face.
Sherlock sprung up from where he was sitting on the bed and started John in the process.
(03:12) And to answer your question, it’s obvious. The language you use says you’re in your teens. You’re going to a party at your friend’s, not to a bar—you’re underage. Then there’s Sannah. You’re asking a girl out on a date and you focused on describing her appearances, fit and blonde. That suggests you’re a hormone-driven teenager. Possibly 16, but I’d say 17. SH
(07:21) Oh god. No, mine's downstairs. It must be my idiot of a brother. If the footsteps were heavy, that is. I didn't know he was coming home today. SH
(22:50) John? SH
A few minutes before he is supposed to meet his officer he sees her on the corner of the alleyway, casually leaning against the brick wall and smoking a cigarette. Her eyes light up when she spots him and he waves at her and jogs over with a smile on his face.
(04:30) Don't you realise this case requires your full attention. With whom were you? SH
(18:34) Sorry to disappoint you, but I’m not a drug dealer. Shouldn’t you be texting Sannah Hannigan? I’m sure she would be delighted. SH
(09:58) My name is Sherlock Holmes and I work for Scotland Yard. I expect to meet you in less than ten minutes. SH
(10:29) A different motive, yes. Yes. SH
[16:01] I'm thankful for that. SH
Suddenly John’s mouth feels oddly dry. There’s an awkward silence, and Sherlock swallows uncomfortably.
, he thinks to himself.
(04:49) It just strikes me as odd. SH
He needs a fix.
(03:15) You didn’t answer my question. SH
(See the end of the chapter for
(01:02) I'm afraid not. Mycroft makes sure there's none in the house. SH
(22:01) So very mature. SH
(22:39) Yeah, you did. A man of his words, I see. SH
He needs to focus. He needs to save John.
(10:03) Well, why wouldn't not getting yourself killed be a good thing? SH
(18:49) You'll be safe there. My brother has men guarding the house. SH
(21:33) I’m the same age as you. SH
(11:20) Oh, I think it was very appropriate, considering all three of them, Susan, her boyfriend and the one she cheated with, were present. SH
(10:35) I need a mistake. There has to be one. SH
(05:00) Okay. I won't. H
‘Sherlock,’ he interrupted him in between kisses. ‘You don’t—this isn’t, you’re married to your wo-‘
(12:20) No, Sherlock, Christ, no. That's not it at all. But I really, really can't tell you. I'm sorry. You can call me H, though
With trembling hands, he unbuttoned his own jeans and took them and his boxers off, his eyes never leaving Sherlock’s. Then he unbuttoned Sherlock’s suit trousers and waited for Sherlock to take them off. He shivered at the sight of Sherlock.
"Nah, just moved here, transferring to West Bank after the summer," he said with a shrug. "Need to scout my territory, ya' know?"
(16:47) I don't, I'm afraid. SH
‘You- I understand if you wouldn’t want to be around me after—you were never meant to see this and, I-
[13:20] Hi Mary! I'm good, thanks. How are you? JW
(22:50) Not that you have to tell me everything you do. H
“Sherlock, wha—” John began, but he was interrupted by the press of another set of lips on his, and John froze, unable to respond. The detective slid his tongue across his bottom lip, but still, John found himself completely unable to move, his mind trying to catch up with the fact that Sherlock had just kissed him.
Firstly, we have made some changes to the story. In the text that Mary sends Sherlock there are no longer coordinates included. We realized it was pretty stupid, why would she include coordinates?
(04:36) No, I need you. Give me some data. Tell me everything you can find out about Casino Cosmo. SH
Clutching the phone to his ear, Sherlock continues before Mycroft has time to speak. ‘I--John, they have John. We need to save him. Mycroft, I—please’, Sherlock stammers, the panic in his voice obvious to him, but he doesn't care, the only thing occupying his mind being John's safety.
(22:18) Fine, you? H
It is 05:21 when John finally moves from the couch and into the bathroom to shower. His head is pounding and his eyes are bloodshot, and he thinks to himself that he is s never going to drink with Harry again. He knows that is a lie as soon as the thought reaches his consciousness, but he is too depressed and too tired to worry about what it might mean, or how alike his father he is becoming. John shudders and turns the shower tap on.
the blush creeping up his neck.
(10:32) Just a few hours. She’ll change them again today if you want to, just ask her. SH
