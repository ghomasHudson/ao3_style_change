I’ll see you then. SH
We used to be a team, John. That was long ago. Before... I couldn’t delete it if I tried, and believe me, I have tried.
And it will probably make me angry, and I’ll probably wish I could find all those people who hurt you, but I also have to accept that what’s done is done. All I can do now is ensure that I’ll be there the next time you need me. If you ever need me again.
Sherlock stops, back still turned to him. John sighs, rubbing a hand over his face.
The first time he realised that he was irreversibly in love with John Watson, he was standing atop St Bart’s and it was too late to do a thing about it. He still had some kind of hope, though, call it blind optimism, and it kept him going for the following two years. Every situation he found himself in was successfully navigated only thanks to the belief that he had to make it through and make it
The third step had been cooking something that could be eaten cold or easily heated up. He had browsed the internet for quite a while the day before, looking for the right recipe and finally settling on a not too complicated salad. After following every step perfectly, Sherlock was quite pleased with the result. He had already prepared their two plates before putting them in the fridge for later.
John’s arms close around him, “Hey, don’t worry, it was a silly question. You don’t have to answer.”
Yes, alright, that’s not what I had in mind when you said you could come for the weekend. Of course I had imagined things differently, but I thought we agreed to talk about these things now. Not to shut down entirely and flee. We deserve more than that, Sherlock. We deserve so much more than that.
We will now post two chapters per day since we've already written quite a lot!
Sherlock stares at him for a moment longer before smiling and leaning back for another kiss. They indulge in quiet kisses and soft caresses for as long as possible, and when Rosie’s first cries make their way downstairs, Sherlock is up in less than a second. “I’m going!”
“It’s hot today.”
Ok. Really got to go or she won’t stop crying.
John puts down the bottle, holding Rosie close to his chest. “That could be perfect.”

“I will blame it on you if anyone ever notices,” he says.
“Get a room, you lovebirds,” a lady walking out of the shop teases them, smiling.
“That’s alright,” John replies, brushing their noses together. “You can do what you want, I can do what I want. Us being… well, us, doesn’t mean everything has to change. We’re going to work, solve cases, eat takeaway and get on each other’s nerves. That isn’t going to change, love. The only thing that will is that now, we
Before he can’t stop himself, he clears his throat, desperate to disrupt the moment.
John Watson
“John,” Sherlock moans, fingers digging into his lower back as his movements become more and more uncontrolled.
I’m fine too, but it doesn’t sound like you are.
“Alright?” John asks as he takes a seat opposite. He nods lightly as John orders himself a freshly pressed juice and pulls his attention to Sherlock completely.
I don’t know if you’re even listening to this, but I love you, Sherlock Holmes. I love you and you’re not going to change that. Call me, text me, talk to me, please. I can’t do this alone.
Their eyes meet again, searching in the dim light. Sherlock’s hand is shaking as he slowly moves to slide John’s hand up his cheek and into his hair, now cupping his face. John breathes out as quietly as he can, afraid Sherlock might let go. The first caress of Sherlock’s lips against his palm makes his whole body shudder. He feels more than he hears Sherlock’s own sharp exhale, so very warm on his bare skin.
“You’ve made breakfast?”
“Mine too,” Sherlock replies, taking John’s hand back in his as they enter the little Italian restaurant. He remembers that night very well. Before he left. John was in a good mood, despite not having eaten since the day before. When they finally solved the case close to eleven o’clock that evening, John insisted they stop into this restaurant, and Sherlock hadn’t refused. The little fairy lights adorning the venue twinkled just so in John’s eyes, and that’s what he remembers most, not the dessert, not anything else, really.
John chuckles softly, “I can stop if you want.”
“I’m sure.”
“I realise that I sound like an arse, wanting to be the centre of your attention even at night.”
I want to begin life, even at my age, even with my inexperience. I want to leap and for somebody to catch me. I want to learn what it is to touch and be touched, not out of obligation, but out of
Sherlock opens the cabinet in his Mind Palace with all of John’s acquaintances. One by one, they flash before him, rotating in front of his eyes and he swishes through them with a flick of the wrist. Ah. Stella and Ted. Ted.
“Fine.” He can barely think straight. He never realised that such a simple gesture could be so… sensual.
Want you on top of me. SH
“I was thinking Greek,” Sherlock suggests.
“I’ll do it, I just need you to tell me how,” Sherlock adds after a minute or two of silence.
to have tried. I just never saw the point or found the time, really. The work has always taken precedence, almost to a fault - you of all people should understand that. So I never… It just never seemed to matter. It’s not as though there was a queue ‘round the block of people who were gasping for it. I also shut that part of my brain off a very long time ago. There’s no point in wasting valuable resources on such entanglements. Was. There
The heavy glass door has come off the hinges at the top, causing it to lean to one side and let the outside air in. It used to be that one opened the door to let in the air. The fact that they had taken this for granted is an understatement. They cough as they force the door open, dust escaping from where it almost settles into their lungs.
“Me too,” John says, scooting closer to Sherlock to allow the people passing them by more room. “I must say,” he says lowly, near Sherlock’s ear, “the fact that I still manage to make you blush that way after all this time is really endearing. If we weren’t in public right now, I’d really give you something to blush about.”
John lifts his hand as if to touch Sherlock’s face - the intention unclear to them both - but instead holds it suspended in midair. The last bridge followed them right to their very marriage bed. Sherlock doesn’t try to fight it, simply holds the half-extended hand in his own and kisses John’s fingertips, one by one.
Sherlock looks up from his research paper briefly. He starts to lift his hand, as if to reach, but abandons the gesture midway.
But you’re not on the other end, so I win, I think… Even though
Sherlock slipping under the cover makes him jump, and John opens his eyes to look at him. They’re still so silent, and John wishes he could find the right words, the ones that won’t betray just how desperate he feels, how insecure, how scared. He lies down instead, reaching for the lamp and turning it off. Darkness surrounds them, and for a second, only the sound of their breathing echoes in the room.
Sherlock is the one to roll him around after all, hands manoeuvring him as he wants, John following with the same trust he always has. The smile starting on Sherlock’s lips all the way to his eyes makes John’s heart beat a little faster. Words don’t come, dying in his throat before forming, but John doesn’t care. It is all written on Sherlock’s face, everything that unfolded between them and all there is left to discover. John wonders if, by some mysterious chance, he could be falling in love all over again.
You know, I almost laughed when I read your letter for the first time. I would have never thought you’d think I’m worth being put on a pedestal. When I’m next to you, I always feel like I’m the luckiest man, being able to just stand there, to be part of your world. You’re right, I really am an idiot sometimes, especially compared to you, and I always felt like you’d grow bored of my presence. I used to wonder, the weeks after I moved in, how long it would take for you to realise just how ordinary I am, but you never said anything. I understand now, and if for a second I felt proud, reading your words, it also explains a lot. I’m not sure most men would be happy being told they’re not perfect, but God knows I am. We can’t move on if we don’t accept the other as he is, and we’re both far from perfection in the end. And yes, you will always remain amazing and bloody brilliant to me, but I also know the ways you can hurt me and push all of my limits. Now you do too. That’s a good thing, Sherlock.
Sherlock smiles back before they kiss again. Like they’re both in on it; this little world they’ve finally created for themselves which is a slice of pure heaven, unsullied by anything else, not even the past.
John Watson
Sherlock doesn’t say anything, just turns around to storm off but John grabs him by the arm lightly, forcing him to turn back around.
You see, John, I want all of it with you.
“I intend to try, yes,” John says, sighing again. “Listen, this has been a tough day. In fact, I’m going to take a long shower and probably go to bed early.”
He hears him sigh again but also get up and soon the bathroom door is closing. John waits until he can hear the water running before going back to collect the rest of their food. He takes care of it all quickly, heading to the bedroom to get some pyjamas and going back into the kitchen to wait for Sherlock. He tries not to think too much of Sherlock’s naked body in the next room, nor about the fact that they made it clear last night that they both wanted
(But I don’t mind).
Fuck, Sherlock. SH
But I still need time. I’m still a mess, Sherlock.
John smiles once more, resisting the overwhelming urge to kiss him. “I’m listening.”
“Alright, yes. I’m sure we can figure something out,” Sherlock goads, trying to get a rise out of John.
You’ve only just gotten on the plane to your stupid conference and I miss you already. If you don’t turn around and come and kiss me, I may have a massive sulk about it. In fact, I feel the beginnings of one coming along as we speak.
Some days, they go out. Wednesdays for food, sporadically to avoid cabin fever. Some Sundays, John puts on his Sunday best as though the bells of church would chime, after all this time. He doesn’t make it out of the door.
. How he came so close to ruining it all for good, how it might still be the case. And so, panic comes rushing back.
It’s not that Sherlock is celibate or anything. Well, not entirely. He just prefers to keep his body under certain conditions. Ones that don’t involve giving into its every whim. He has always seen sexual urges as a mind over matter problem, and his mind is certainly strong enough to push it aside. Besides, there’s never really been anybody that he felt he’d want to go down that particular road with. He isn’t squeamish, but the prospect of swapping bodily fluids with most people made him feel quite ill. So much so that he had often toyed with a few labels that precluded him from those kinds of activities. In the end, though, he’d realised labels and proclamations weren’t necessary. It was what it was. Matters of human attraction were never going to be his forte, not even when they concerned his own proclivities. He didn’t really care to dwell on it either.
“There are things… I suppose there are some things that I feel I should say. The things you asked about in your letter, the ones I told you I’d been hiding. I just… knew that if I wrote it down in a letter or an email it would go unsent. Again, incidentally.”
But we can do this, you and me?
Sherlock understands perfectly, bringing John’s mouth to his once more, more than welcome to the idea that the playing field is sort of levelled. That they get to explore each other with fresh eyes and lips and fingertips. He bites John’s bottom lip and John groans, but soon he’s rubbing the sides of Sherlock’s abdomen and arms, wordlessly urging him to slow down.
I hope you don’t fault me for having to leave so suddenly, but I had to remove myself with a sense of finality before I allowed this thing to swallow me whole, more than it already has.
“Sherlock.” John puts his glass down, sliding forward on his chair and letting his free hand cup Sherlock’s face, too. They’re close. Suddenly John is brought back, a lifetime ago, to a fence separating them and metal hurting their flesh. “Look at me.” Shades of bright warmth lights their faces. “I understand. I do.”
“What are they doing?”
“You know what, why don’t you try and guess. That should keep you occupied.”
Silence, uncomfortable and thick, falls back up between them. John closes his eyes for a brief second. So that’s it then, they are no longer a
After unpacking, he looks around his airbnb. Clean, tidy and modern. He could live here.
“Elsie. Goodbye,” John says in a slightly irritated tone.
“I remember you touching me quite a lot,” John replies, placing quick kisses all along his jaw.
“So,” he continues, talking over Sherlock’s prolonged silence, a habit they never used to be in need of. “What’s new?”
John shakes his head, moaning. Sherlock’s lips find his neck, kissing over his pulse point over and over again. John can’t help the whimper that escapes him, shifting just so Sherlock’s thigh is pressed directly against his erection.
John takes the blow without a noise.
“Of course.”
Yes. Saturday.
, something that’s a little close for comfort.
“Oh trust me,” John says, “I do.”
Rocking harder against him, John seeks Sherlock’s lips again and pours all of his love into the kiss. He tells Sherlock how he’s going to miss this, how much he craves them like this all the time, how beautiful, how breathtaking he is in this very moment. He tells him all the things he can’t yet speak out and hopes Sherlock understands, hopes Sherlock
Sherlock’s brain briefly short-circuits at the word
“No,” John counters, calm, but firm.
“Your choice.”
Let’s discuss in person. Coffee tomorrow? SH
We could have stayed there for hours if Mrs Hudson hadn't popped in. I can still see her face as she understood what was happening. Her grin could have lit up the entire place. Well, yours too. Not kissing you again right there was one of the hardest things I had to do. Just like not kissing you right now.
“Sherlock, I-”
; each caress a strong shout crumbling every last wall. An offering and a seal.
John takes a couple of seconds to gain his composure and to keep up, something he has had to always do since that very first day. “A bit, I think,” he says, perfectly aware of how much he has - enough that he could return back to his flat should he ever wish to. He doesn’t say this.
“Above an eight?” Sherlock asks, and John could laugh. Or cry, maybe.
“Okay,” he says, smiling. One of the things Sherlock loves most about John is his ability to understand Sherlock so deeply and so thoroughly without ever making a fuss.
Written by
“You’ll see,” Sherlock says. “You have nothing to worry about.”
I love you.
Sherlock nods, swallowing back the words stuck in his throat. Even if he doesn’t understand John’s rather intense worry, he knows he needs to accept it. And so he watches John’s wave with a smile, and hates more than anything how he is not kissing him right now.
“So,” John says, out of breath, “good idea?”
And yet, walking out of Bart’s, John finds himself heading towards Baker Street. He doesn’t stop until he’s staring at the bright 221, breaths coming short and his heart hammering in his ears. He has no business being here. Sherlock let him come on the case only because he had called. He would have gone alone, gotten stuck in the middle of nowhere alone, solved it alone.
He doesn’t turn around, merely waits for the parting blow.
“I know,” John whispers back, his eyes moistening slightly.
“I know. It’s just ridiculous, really.”
I wish I could be with you now, love, touch you and kiss you.
“Yeah?”
He puts on his uniform of beige linen trousers and a white linen shirt - no shower, sponge baths when absolutely necessary. He long abandoned his tight suits and formal shoes in favour of lighter fabrics. Some days, he doesn’t change into clothes at all. Wednesdays, though, necessitate it. Wednesdays are when he has a chance to join civilisation again, surround himself with the very people he used to turn his nose up at - average, all of them; blessedly, thankfully average. He revels in their normalcy, appreciating the stark contrast between their noxious environment and humanity, which, through the nature of his cases, he once thought of as wicked as a whole, but now knows is complex, fascinating and, above all, unable to be demarcated into any black or white category. He craves people, with their intricacies and hangups. Him, the willfully solitary madman. It seems like the most bizarre twist of all. No longer can he look into the faces of any one person and deem them dull or unnecessary. They carry a story. They’re his link to the Old World, to the man he once thought he was becoming.
John is certain, ever since he went to meet him at Speedy’s, Sherlock has been distant, locked in his own head and barely responding to either him or Rosie. John understands, of course he does. He has done a lot of thinking on his own, in the middle of the night as he held Sherlock close to him and at random moments of the day as he realised he’d had to leave all…
John dug his fingers into the side of Sherlock’s abdomen, making him squirm and giggle. “I’ll tell you what I’ll do…”
They chase each other down never-ending hallways and up stairwells, all the while very much aware that they wanted to come out and find the world, but it isn’t here anymore. Not even Sherlock’s brilliant deductions could breathe life back into it. All they really do now is serve to highlight the fact that those moments are past, never to be lived again. Opportunities dwindled down to a stray earring on a stair, slippers outside a door.
John Watson
But I wanted to, you have to know just how much I wanted to.
“You let me know, then.”
I don’t blame you for it, not really. I blame myself every single day for allowing things to become so horribly tangled. For entangling myself in your life, and yours in mine.
The air between them feels electrified as they undress slowly. A homecoming. A relief. When they’re both fully naked, they collapse onto the bed together in a heap, writhing and kissing and biting and sucking in desperate measure. It feels as though every ounce of concentration needs to be wrapped up in these activities. It’s desperate and a little bit messy, but soon it slows down as their kisses grow more languid and longing. The tiring events of the day and the gratitude they feel for one another all melt into one as they kiss each other’s eyes and lips and chests as though they’re telling each other little secrets in the confines of their private, safe space.
“See here,” Sherlock replies, pointing to the third line. “This is actually the beginning of the email.”
brief
The question only earns him more frowning, but John holds Sherlock’s stare.
He searches the other side of the bed blindy, his hand finding only empty, already-cold sheets. He doesn’t fully wake just yet, unable to stop himself from playing over the events of yesterday. He’s still not sure how exactly things escalated to this point. He had thought telling Sherlock about the letter was the best option, starting their relationship with trust, with no secrecy. But now he isn’t certain that had been the best choice.
“Me neither.”
And I’m just as inexperience when it comes to this, so we can say we’re on the same page here.
Sherlock is up so fast that he almost knocks him over.
John licks his lips, tasting Sherlock’s as he does. “What about the cases? What about all you’re doing here, all our clients, Lestrade, Mrs Hudson?”
Sorry I missed your call, love. The signal here is shite. Call me when you get this. I miss you, too. Missed you as soon as my plane took off. Love you. Give Rosie a kiss.
He waits until they’re back in the car before saying, “Thank you for making this happen.”
“Uh, just the bill,” John says with an apologetic smile and then, to Sherlock, “I thought you’d at least want to order dessert.”
“We agreed, no more secrets.”
Anything that has a surface can’t be disturbed without the consequence of filth bouncing up as though from a trampoline. What the dust hasn’t destroyed, the sun and wind has. Tatters and debris settle over the entire ground floor. This isn’t the place they once knew. That place doesn’t exist anymore.
Sherlock, you don’t have to overthink this. I have no doubt it’s - no, we’re going to be brilliant.
Ecology, agriculture, man, all in ruins. Dust eats away, even at itself, cannibalistic and cruel. Not like the sand on the shore. Not nearly as innocuous.
“It’s a ‘thank you’ for having us,” John says.
"John," Sherlock breathes out, both hands now cupping his face. "You came back."
Alcohol doesn’t suit you at all, really.
John, once again too stunned to react, watches as he stands up and goes back to the sink. The water running shakes off John’s stillness and he gets to his feet, too. For a moment, he considers walking to Sherlock and being the one this time to cup his face and force him to look back at him. But Sherlock’s body is tensed, and John suddenly realises how close he came to ruining it all once and for all. Of course Sherlock pulled away. That’s the only way he has to make John understand, to make him realise he doesn’t want this. Doesn’t want him drunk in the middle of the night, nor hungover the next morning.
I, for sure, take it as such.
Sherlock rolls his eyes. “I knew you secretly loved it.”
“Just a mug,” Sherlock replies, already kissing him back.
“Morning,” John says, kissing his chin softly.
Sherlock sighs in relief, letting John make the decision for him. The familiar comfort of his chair reassures him a little, and in a second, he decides that he will not let stress take over. No matter which subject John chooses to talk about, he will speak nothing but the truth and accept the consequences.
(...)
His entire body tenses as he waits for Sherlock’s reply, only to break down when a “Yes” comes out. He shuts everything down at this, locking himself in his own head. He doesn’t need to know where and when and how. He can’t listen to more. He has no right to. Just as he has no right to get angry. It isn’t his place or right to be jealous. Sherlock is a grown man, someone he’s not sure he knows anymore. Who's to say this isn’t the first time he’s been asked out like this. Who’s to say he hasn’t said yes before, too.
“Shutup,” John said without pique. “Don’t you know what I mean?”
I thought you - we - were past that, Sherlock. I thought you understood what it all meant. After our last case, after this whole mess, I thought...
“You’ll get bored, love. As much as I want you to come with us, I don’t want to do that to you,” John says, hating the words as they come out of his mouth. “We both know it. What we are, what we’re becoming, Sherlock, it is so very fragile. And if I fear I could ruin everything by going, I know for sure we’ll ruin it if you come.”
They sit in silence for a long time. Not the oppressive kind of silence that has been stifling them all these months; something more comfortable. Something like it used to be, once upon a time, before the world around them was torn down and their lives had imploded before their very eyes. Although that’s not fair, either, is it? The world has been imploding since day one, but they had something of an antidote before. They had hope.
John pushes the door of the flat open, letting out a deep sigh and dropping his bag in the floor. Had he known today was going to be so busy, he would have gone to bed much earlier yesterday. Not sure Sherlock would have let him, but still, they could have snuggled together under the cover and let sleep take over them slowly.
Mycroft raises his eyebrows again, but it lasts shorter this time.
“Yes. I’ve managed to log on one of their computer sand transfer the emails to mine,” Mark begins to explain as he walks them into the bank. “But I can’t read any of them. They must be encrypted, or they’re using some kind of code.”
It happens when they’re busy with a suspect, who clearly had nothing to do with it and is, in fact, a complete and utter moron.
again.
Sherlock does nothing but blink rapidly while he tries to process the implications of it. Several minutes drag by, but Sherlock hardly notices them.
“A study done in 2013 found that unrequited love was four times more prevalent than equal love,” Sherlock blurts out, regretting it immediately. “I mean… What I mean to say is that, statistically, this was unlikely and you know how I value statistical outliers, but, yes, it
“Hold on,” Sherlock says. “Let me just…”
John smiles, leans down for another kiss, which Sherlock welcomes with literal open arms, encircling John in his embrace.
Sherlock’s eyes flutter closed, as if losing a battle. “You came here.”
John can’t help but smile when Sherlock omits the rather long hours spent in bed, in another continent or this one. His own lips are trembling when Sherlock recalls his proposal, heart growing two sizes bigger inside his chest.
Deciding they really don’t need to waste time
“John, look what I found!”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Tired of what?”
“Yes.”
“I’d like to go on a case with you, here, in the city. I’d like to see you work that beautiful mind of yours and run across London half-scared of what you’ll do next.”
“Well,” Sherlock had flushed. “I hope so.”
Sherlock is shocked. It isn’t like John to be so abrupt. He normally encourages Sherlock’s little explorations. Sherlock thought that’s one of the things John liked about him - his insatiable curiosity and his willingness to always, always,
“Because we haven’t made it,” Sherlock replies calmly.
“Sooo… What have we got here?”
“Isn’t it why we are here?” Sherlock asks.
brief
“How?”
“Yeah?”
Sherlock doesn’t let go until they arrive outside their destination.
John clenches his fingers around his knees. He really needs to put on some trousers of some kind.
“But I shouldn’t have acted like that.” Sherlock sounds almost angry now, breaking eye contact to hide against John’s hand. “I was beyond all that, beyond feeling and caring about another person. I had taught myself not to care. But you were standing in front of me and I-”
“But sometimes you’ll be angry again,” Sherlock finishes for him.
“Well, I do care,” John replies, sitting in his chair. “A lot. We have no idea what this virus can do to either of us, and we have to be careful.”
Sherlock squeezes his hand under the table, and John smiles, silently thanking him. He knows he needs to relax but, for now, he is just waiting for the inevitable questions that are about to come. And yet, it isn’t until dessert that the conversation turns serious, Violet falling silent for a long moment before inhaling deeply.
“I’m not really in the mood for this,” Sherlock mutters.
Sherlock closes his eyes, arching on the bed. John can feel the vibration in his hand, all the way to his upper arm. He wonders what exactly Sherlock is feeling right now because, damn, it looks absolutely amazing. He finds himself hoping they’ll be able to do it again but the other way around soon.
“Or you could just tell me.”
John tries not to think about the suitcases waiting by the door, nor of Sherlock putting Rosie to bed upstairs and saying goodbye.
John breathes out slowly, one hand coming to stroke Sherlock’s back.
John relaxes into his seat, watching the road and breathing it all in. The domesticity of all of it is making his heart beat just a little faster. He glances at Sherlock, focused on the road, and smiles.
They break apart and look into each other’s eyes, searching for meaning there. Whatever they see, it’s enough. Lips reacquaint with lips and tongues meet. Their movements disrupt the settled, fine dust, awakening whorls in dances around them, painfully serenading their slow movements.
John shakes his head, still not sure if he can trust his voice. Sherlock is still so very close, hands still in place, and there isn’t much John can do besides stare into his eyes. It seems that neither of them are breathing, but John couldn’t care less. In all the months he’s been gone, this is the closest he has come to feeling like home. Looking into Sherlock’s eyes, seeing dozens of possibilities there and feeling the excitement rushing through his veins. Unable to stop himself, he glances down at Sherlock’s lips, full and tempting. He licks his own, the smallest of movements, and Sherlock pulls away immediately.
“Then let’s agree to try something,” John offers.
There had been a time when John could have been the one asking. And that time is long gone.
I worry about you, and leaving London doesn’t mean I’m suddenly not interested in your life or well-being. I’m sorry if I haven’t called; I guess I was busy with Rosie and trying to find my place in Bill’s home.
“Because I’m ridiculously in love with you,” Sherlock says matter-of-factly, kissing away the silent tears pooling on the sides of John’s eyes. He settles back onto John’s shoulder. “And baggage or no baggage, that can never change. We know each other’s baggage, John. It’s what we know more than anything.”
They look at each other for a long time. Usually John has already kissed him a couple times by now, telling him about his day and enquiring about his in return. But with still no kissing happening, Sherlock already hates every second of it.
“Do I start?” Sherlock finally asks, still whispering.
“My head hurts,” Sherlock finally says, eyes fluttering close.
John nods, “Even better. I let you chose the movie while I go shower quickly?”
Sherlock audibly gasps as they almost step right over a dead bird outside their stoop, but it’s drowned in the chaos around them. The sun is blotted out by dust. There is no omen foreboding enough to prophesy their reality.
He lets Sherlock pull him on top of him, kissing mad, wet patterns all over his clavicle, his chest, his shoulders. Sherlock’s cock lies untouched against his stomach and John grabs it by the base, pumping it a few times before Sherlock stops him. He wants the real thing tonight. He needs to come with John inside of him. When he says so, John pauses for a second in breathless amazement and whispers, “Okay. Yeah. I know what you mean,” and slides his hand lower, circling Sherlock’s entrance and teasing him until he relaxes a little bit. With the other hand, he reaches into the bedside drawer, grinning with relief when he finds what he’s looking for there, and dribbles some of the cold liquid on his fingers. With that hand, he takes over, teasing Sherlock more, opening him up slowly, lovingly, piece by piece, until Sherlock is writhing against the bed, every thought lost and every emotion concentrated into the present, the way it should be, the way he never knew it
“Do you want to go?” Sherlock finally asks.
As he’s climbing the steps to 221B, he can hear a little girl’s giggling which lights up his whole face, too. Rosie. John. Home.
He feels Sherlock smiling against his lip, “I’ve missed you.”
“Oh, sounds very inter- Oh, I see,” John smiles, peeking at the title. “Rosie’s first time experiment?”
“You have to understand, I was on the edge of desperation back then. I know I just told you that I knew the risk, but being back and seeing you again after two years, I just couldn't accept that risk anymore. I had to make sure you weren’t going to walk away from me.”
“I’ve no idea,” Sherlock replies grimly.
He doesn’t say anything as they fall asleep glued together, unable to let go,
“No,” Sherlock whispers, shaking his head. “I understand what you mean more than you know. You were - and still are - a complete mystery, and I thought several times about studying your sleep patterns, that maybe it would help me.”
John smiles at him, hanging his coat up with a sigh, “Jane caught it.”
Every former practice that has served him well in the New World is no victory, only because it has been necessitated. When choice is taken out of an exercise, one can no longer revel in it.
“Boring. Inconsequential. How about you?” he asks, stroking his way up John’s arm suggestively.
“How do you figure that? What exactly
John Watson
“I guess I was, yes. But the thing is, and I hate that it sounds so… mean, but I never felt this urge to kiss her constantly.” He stares back at Sherlock. “Whereas you…”
“They don’t matter, John,” Sherlock breathes out. “You do.”
I’ll take the first train down. SH
“Come on,” John laughs. “Time to eat, it seems. You really should have eaten breakfast.”
I should be with you, taking care of you.
“Merry Christmas, love,” he manages to say between two attacks of Sherlock’s mouth.
The depth of Sherlock’s feeling is suddenly making it hard to breathe. How could he have been so blind? It was all there, everything he had always hoped Sherlock would tell him. All that could have happened if one of them had simply said something.
“Well,” he replies, “I actually know what you mean. It’s been a long time coming, really, and I’d been thinking about it a lot even before… before
John tenses a little, Sherlock’s hand - still on his thigh -  giving a squeeze.
Sherlock gives a sharp nod, “Yes.”
Wait. SH
For God’s sake, Sherlock! You and I clearly know you don’t need drugs, you never needed them. You’re destroying this brilliant mind of yours, not to mention the damage you’re doing to the life of the people around you. Can’t you think of them before picking up that needle?!
Still, John is now going to stop extending his search area. He didn’t want to have to ride the train or bus for hours just to get home after work. First of all, Rosie is still adapting to her new home, and even if she seems to get on rather well with Sherlock, she continues to search for him all day if he’s gone too long (Sherlock wrote so in his new journal dedicated to Rosie only). Plus, there’s Sherlock. Sherlock whom he can’t wait to kiss, to push against the nearest wall and melt into him. It’s only been a few hours, but John can already feel this aching need for
John tightens his embrace, snaking his leg over Sherlock’s so that there’s no part of them that isn’t wrapped up in the other.
I want nothing more than that. SH
“Everything’s alright, John.”
The question is unspoken, but hovers over the exchange all the same.
Sherlock chuckles, the sound bright and so surprising that everything in John begins to ache. He reaches out for him, bringing Sherlock’s face as close as it can possibly be and kisses him as if it were the first time again. Soft lips answer his kiss, already demanding more with careful touches of tongue. John can do little less than open up to him, again and again and again until there is nothing left in him that isn’t Sherlock’s.
“Please don’t worry and please stop treating me like I’ll break. I want you. I
It feels strange to be writing you a letter again, and at the same time, it feels somehow comfortable.
Then, making them both jump, John’s phone chimes on the table. He rushes for it, reading out loud.
Of course you’re not, but you’re special. Precious. This is precious to me. Don’t want to screw it up with my usual untoward behaviour ;)
John pushes a bit deeper and Sherlock moans louder. Despite it all, John is still a bit surprised to be honest with Sherlock’s every reaction. Now a complete mess of limbs and cries on the bed, Sherlock can’t seem to be able to say anything but his name, and John’s senses are on fire.
“Works for me,” John smiles.
John turns to look at Sherlock, the look on his face betraying just how nervous he had also been the entire time.
It’s alright. Not your fault. Not at all.
“I saw you coming down the street,” Sherlock pants against his lips when he pulls away, resting their foreheads together.
Taking off his jacket, he makes his way to the bathroom and turns on the shower. He quickly goes to their bedroom, finding some nice and fresh clothes, before going back. The hot water makes him whimper, his entire body finally relaxing as he closes his eyes and lets himself enjoy the moment. He almost misses the sound of the door opening. Almost.
(See the end of the chapter for
Thank you for telling me what happened with Victor. Maybe it’s not the right way to start this letter, but I’d rather say it now than let it linger. You say you’re afraid to lose me, to lose all we’re building now, and I told you (and I meant it) that if we work together, none of us has to fear losing the other. But you need to understand that you going back to using after I come back, when we’re together, when we are finally home, I… I’m not sure I could take it. I’m not sure I could watch and try to make it better, and in the end fail. I can’t win against drugs, I can’t win against any addictions really. I tried with Harry, for years, and it lead to absolutely nothing. I almost fell into one myself, and I still have to be careful from time to time.
So yes, I want to be ready to love you properly. I want us to be ready. There is still so much we need to talk about, so much we need to forgive ourselves for. Christ, you wrote me a long, beautiful, letter and mine seems so dull in comparison. But I can’t stop thinking about each word you put down on paper, each confession you made and how much you must have been scared writing them.
. The thought makes the flutters return.
“Eleven days, John. We haven’t been out for eleven days.”
“It actually sounds like a good idea, yes,“ he smiles, leaning up to brush their lips together. “I’m exhausted.”
They go back downstairs and into their bedroom without letting go of each other. Falling silent again, John slowly undresses Sherlock, clothes after clothes, keeping his eyes fixed on his. The bed is somehow still warm, and John lets Sherlock snuggle into his arms with a relieved sigh. They remain like that, close and silent, for another long moment. John can feel himself dozing off, and so he brings Sherlock’s lips to his one more time.
“Maybe,” Sherlock replies, smiling back.
“Still, I shouldn’t have gone the way I did.”
“Darling,” John smiles, rolling onto his back and stretching lazily. “I love that.”
“John,” Sherlock says frankly, “we never never just friends.”
Sherlock repeats the letter over and over in his mind as though it were a mantra. He’s familiar with the use of mantras in meditation, having tried the practice out himself when he tried to go cold turkey in his early thirties once. It enabled him to enhance his Mind Palace technique and hone in on how best to easily and quickly access certain wings but, other than that, he hadn’t found it very useful - being alone with his own mind was a recipe for disaster, truly. And now, instead of the letter bringing comfort or relief as a mantra should, it brings a wash of emotions, some of them foreign to him. Curiosity, intrigue, motivation; all to be expected, under the circumstances. What he can’t explain, however, is the feeling he keeps trying to bury. Has been trying to bury since he first saw the little mark on John’s chest a couple of days ago. The one that makes his stomach roil and his heart feels heavy and constricted. He feels… hurt. That’s the only word he can find that could possibly match. It doesn’t make any sense to him, but there it is, in all its gory glory. Hurt.
“What’s so funny?”
John goes about his day while Sherlock slumbers on, peaceful on the couch. He doesn’t dare wake him - it has been about three days and one extremely tiresome case (that he solved right in the living room with the help of Zoom) since he last slept. Besides, it’s nice to have some quiet around the flat for a while. Not that John doesn’t love being around Sherlock during this time, God knows he does, but the man is, simply put, insufferable. He declares his boredom at least twice an hour and has taken to doing experiments on the contents of their fridge in a frankly transparent attempt at forcing them to go out and buy more supplies, which gives him a chance to get out of the flat. If, in the past, anybody would have told him that Sherlock Holmes was making blatant attempts to go to the shops and buy groceries, he’d have scoffed at the idea. He supposes they’re all making do during the pandemic, in any way possible.
“You’ve unpacked,” he says, looking at the different boxes.
Please heed the new tag for this chapter specifically. Sherlock briefly alludes to his suicidal ideation in this letter. Stay safe!
I wish this were easier. SH
brief
“Do you see why I wanted it left alone?” John smiles softly, but it’s ugly somehow, full of regret and melancholy. Not really a smile at all, but a mask for something he’s holding back on.
“Alright, I-” He stops, looking down at Rosie. “Can I call you back to give you an answer?”
“No breakfast for me, darling,” comes the gush of words as Sherlock glides past him with a peck in his general direction and into the living room. When he reaches the door and pulls his coat off the hook, the hair on the back of John’s neck stands up.
No matter what happened or how Sherlock had acted the day before, he is going to make sure today is different. And for starters, no staying at the Airbnb all day. They need to go out, to do what people usually do on holiday, distract themselves to better find each other when coming home. Sherlock hadn’t said much about the places he wanted to visit but in South Africa, a sarafi has to be on the list.
“Do you mind if I turn on the TV?”
to see them!
“Good thing you picked up on the code in the first place,” Sherlock replies.
They’ve argued about every possible practicality as a way of avoiding bringing up the big stuff. They argued about shampoo once - a new low, even for them. Sherlock hates the way John still whistles at the bathroom sink in the morning on the days he brushes his teeth. John hates the way Sherlock never whistles at all anymore, adding to the deafening silence that they’ve been forcibly wrapped up in.
“Thank you so much for meeting with me, Mr Holmes and Doctor Watson.”
“I believe I am,” John answered, drawing his arm over Sherlock’s torso and pulling him closer. “Come here.”
“You don’t smoke,” Sherlock frowns, passing the cigarette nevertheless.
that takes most of his breath away in the end. Pondering whether to turn around in Sherlock’s arms or not, he allows himself to accept that this is probably how he’s going to wake up for the rest of his days. Some version of this anyway. He finds himself already waiting for the mornings where Sherlock would already be out of the bed so he could roll to his side and steal his pillow. But this morning, the first morning, all John wants is to kiss the man again. Just to make sure yesterday evening - and most of the night too - truly happened. In a warm, fuzzy flash, Sherlock’s whispered words come back to him, each printed on his mind for the long term. John wonders if he could kiss them all away this morning, turn them all into a memory they can hold on to but at the same time leave behind.
They cling to each other, hands in hair, tongues on throats, teeth on lips. The desperation that has been building not just since the dust arrived, but since that fateful day at Bart’s, seems to explode within the contained space. John kisses a messy row down Sherlock’s neck and back up again. He tastes the little hollow behind his ear and can’t get enough of the breathy moans coming out of Sherlock’s mouth, obscene as they are.
Sherlock begins to bear down experimentally, both of them letting out long, luxuriating moans all the way until John is fully seated. He kisses Sherlock once on each of his cheekbones and then on his mouth and begins to rock back and forth, slowly at first but soon building a level, steady pace. Sherlock feels as though every part of him, every part of his life, has just been leading up to this one moment, this one connection. How did he ever survive without this? How had the world been so cruel as to allow him to go all these years never knowing this? He moves in tempo with John and if his eyes glisten too, neither of them says anything, the only audible sounds coming from the rustling sheets, their little huffs in the moonlit room. The adoration laid bare in John’s eyes sends shivers up and down Sherlock’s spine and it only takes a few more pumps for him to spill over completely untouched, completely unashamed. John follows soon after with a cacophony of groans that Sherlock would love to document, but truly can not at the present moment.
“Morning,” he breathes, deliriously happy.
“Morning,” he smiles, letting his feelings show as much as possible.
“You feel amazing, absolutely amazing.”
Sherlock can unfortunately do nothing but stare at him, lifting his hand to his lips to check if they’re still there. He finds that they are, although they can’t really do anything useful beyond falling open slightly.
“I’m surprised it took you this long,” he says simply.
Sherlock captures it with this mouth and soon, their kisses turn slow and lazy, one seeming to melt into the other, until they break apart, languorously pecking the other on whatever piece of skin becomes available without too much effort. John settles himself onto Sherlock, his whole left side still on top of him.
“I have a feeling they’re going to be excellent,” John says, one finger gathering what’s left in the bowl.
As soon as Sherlock arrives at the crime scene, all thoughts of John go out the window as he dashes from outdoor muddy footprints to indoor blood splatter. Unfortunately, thoughts of John never stay buried for long and he can’t exactly ignore them when the man himself shows up fifteen minutes later with two cups of takeaway coffee - one of them ostensibly for Sherlock.
“Hey,” he whispers, stilling his hands.
“Mmm.”
Not too far. Not far. Far isn’t the right word. Is it? Far… SH
Sherlock?
“You’ve said that already,” Sherlock teases, body going pliant in his arms.
So much so much so much. SH
know is how many of these men - if any - were actually your boyfriend at any point in time.”
That leaves N. Sherlock uses the same technique to look for the mysterious N, but comes up empty. Infuriating. Unacceptable.
“I’m glad we’re doing this.”
“What are you doing here?”
brief
“I just have one regret in all this,” he started.
Sherlock throws his head back, breathing out a loud, “Brilliant.”
John Watson
I want to come back home and love you, properly. I want to make you feel loved, to make you understand with touches and kisses just how much I adore you. I want to look into your eyes and let you deduce all the things I’ve never dared to let out. I want you, God, I want you so much. But even as I write these words, it scares me. It scares me because I feel like this feeling could swallow me whole, consume me entirely. Are you scared too, Sherlock, of all the possibilities offered to us now?
God that voice, isss the thing I miss the most I think probaby. Problably. Probabably. Nah, thass a lie. I miss your fucking beautiful mouth. What a waste of a mouth. What a complete waste… I - Look, can you come home now? Enough of thiss -
He finds him lying on the sofa, a cup of tea broken of the floor. With no apparent reaction, John goes to check on him only to meet two dark eyes. He swallows around the knot in his throat, forcing himself to breathe in and out slowly.
John adds a third finger, stretching Sherlock as thoroughly as he can. He can already feel his own pleasure building and building just at the sight of him, so breathtakingly beautiful.
John nods, “Very.”
Same. Can’t sleep. Anything in particular you’re wondering about?
John is about to explain when one of Sherlock’s hands closes around him, stroking him in long and hard movements. All of the air leaves his lungs as John finds his own release, Sherlock’s name on his lips and his legs shaking. It takes another minute before he’s aware of his surroundings again, and then, Sherlock kissing his shoulder softly.
Please, love. Answer me.
“I know that you may or may not have had multiple sexual partners while in the army - didn’t earn your Three Continents moniker for naught, I suppose - but what I
John considers the question, lips brushing Sherlock’s head.
“I understand, yes, but I have absolutely no experience in managing a clinic. I’m sorry if I misled you during the interview.”
“We can’t giggle at a crime scene,” Sherlock says, which causes them to double over further.
“I enjoyed it a lot,” Sherlock corrects him, the same playful smile on his lips.
“Why are you doing renovations on your house when you just finished renovating two months ago?”
With one heated, pregnant look, it’s sealed. All that’s left to do is allow their sweating, unclothed bodies to slide against each other, their intimacy heartbreaking in its simplicity. All the things they’ve long imagined slide away, paling in comparison to their present reality. Lonely nights with just the memory and fantasy of the other seem to have been a total underestimation, in fact.
“Alright, alright,” John laughs, handing it to him. “Now yours.”
His phone chimes again, and he hurries down the street. He knows he should have cancelled when Sherlock called - cases always come first, as he used to think, once upon a lifetime. And now, he needs to get to Bart’s as quickly as possible. Mike had made sure to read over his draft that weekend, and now he was the one making him wait. Still, as he made his way into Bart’s and up the stairs, John can’t help but wonder if he’ll one day be able to walk in here without feeling empty.
“I think,” John says, looking hesitant and, if Sherlock didn’t know him better, he’d swear a little bashful. “I think I’d like to take you out on a date.”
Sherlock’s own lips curl into a smile, “Me too.”
I want to write poetry, like the terrible ones you used to email to your numerous girlfriends. I want to receive poetry and laugh about it and tear it up and regret it and tape the pieces back together again.
I still can’t bring myself to ask.
“I can assure you,” Sherlock says distractedly as he stands to look in the full-length mirror on the wall, “there won’t be a next time.”
When John brings Rosie for a visit the next day, all Sherlock can think about, of course, is the tattoo on John’s chest. Whenever he has a case to solve, nothing else matters. Every other passing detail becomes just that - a detail. Inconsequential. Especially when the case is his substitute for dealing with emotions. He learnt a long time ago that it’s either the needle or the chase - without either, his mind seems to collapse in on itself with the gravity of merely existing.
“No, you don’t,” John says, eyes meeting in the dim stairwell.
John kisses him until he’s breathless, until he’s on the bed without noticing or caring how he got there, until he’s hungry for more yet completely satisfied, too, somehow. He’s on his back, stroking and rubbing himself on every bit of John he can, lifting John’s shirt out of his trousers and grumbling for him to remove the rest. John sits up and unbuttons his shirt, then removes his vest and trousers. Before he can lower his pants, though, he asks, “Is this alright?” tentatively.
Their mouths crash together again, John immediately pushing himself off the wall and switching their places. Sherlock moans into the kiss as John presses them against one another, locking their hips together and thrusting. Being still all brand new, John finds them both already hard, his own cock aching for more. He slides one hand down Sherlock’s chest, hip and pushes his knee up.
“I love you, too,” he whispers.
Nothing compared to Sherlock already lying on his back, legs spreading open. Strangely silent now, they get into motion in unison, John first getting Sherlock open with fingers and lube. Only when Sherlock is a moaning mess does he lube up the toy, too, and so very slowly push it inside Sherlock.
“And yet, I didn’t. What do you make of that?”
“Have you ever dated any men?” Sherlock asks suddenly.
“We saw each other here and there yesterday, nothing much.”
Sherlock’s blush deepens as he smiles shyly.
The ride to Baker Street is awkward and quiet, and Sherlock just wants to be in his flat curled up on his couch thinking his thoughts. For some unknown reason, John doesn’t take their uncomfortable silent ride as a hint or a sign, and he still insists on his ridiculous idea of coming upstairs.
“Thanks very much,” John accepted quickly, before Sherlock could protest. “I don’t mind proper tea and biscuits at all, in a cosy home.”
“Thank you.”
“It’s lovely. Where is it?” Sherlock agreed, and he couldn’t help but imagine John in various arrangements on the bed or the chaise, or on a blanket on the sand. Sherlock’s diet would have to stay dull, and he’d have to avoid alcohol for a few weeks, but at least his most decadent desires could be indulged at will, with no risk of harm to his conditioning. Might even burn some extra calories.
“I didn’t see that at all,” Sherlock told him, truthfully.
“I love your body.”
“So that’s
Twisting tits, reminding his body what it needs to do, one-on-one time? If Sherlock had been in an even slightly less dour state of mind, he’d have come in his trousers already. He sighed relief as he shook his coach’s offered hand (thick fingers,
John gathered the schoolwork they’d been offered. “I’ll take these to pin up at home? If she’s still terrorizing the other kids in a few weeks, maybe we can reconvene.” John stood, so Sherlock stood. “Enjoy the rest of your day,” John fake-grinned at the dumbstruck women, and Sherlock waved his hand in front of his chest.
“No.” John protested, but the invitation to sleep was near-irresistible. His leaden limbs would not move, not even a hand. Not even a finger.
“Yes, CRUZR is just chockablock with horny lumberjacks and moose-ranchers,” Sherlock affirmed. “I’ve cast a wide net.”
Rosie was at school; Sherlock had just agreed to take on a client—a woman insistent that her husband had recently been buried alive—who had left him a thick stack of folders and clipped-together reports comprising the man’s medical history, particularly in his final weeks.
“Look at
“Certainly I wouldn’t finish an entire one on my own; I get tired of it after two days. Sherlock will always help himself, so if there’s anything special in, you should be sure to have some before he takes it upstairs.” She rocked her head, smiling as if Sherlock was an irrepressible scamp, indeed. “He thinks I don’t know, but I do.”
Once he got to his phone, there was a text waiting.
, Watson.”
Sherlock grimaced, reached for the nearby remote and paused the film they were watching, side by side on the sofa in their flat. “Of course; why do you ask?”
Predictably, Rosie dawdled through her bedtime routine, but Sherlock easily forgave it—perhaps even indulged it—because it had been so long since they’d been together. He read an extra chapter in her book, and lingered after lights-out to trace numbers and letters onto her back as she drifted off
“No problem,” Steven replied with a shrug. “Glad we did it. Maybe again sometime.” It did not seem that he cared one way or another, and though that was Sherlock’s own usual stance on the matter of extracurricular escapades, he felt inexplicably stung by the shrugging tone of Steven’s voice. He only nodded, straight-faced, lest his voice betray him.
“No, really, Mrs Hudson, I have to. . .” John threw up his hands; in less than a week he’d already come to realise there was no arguing with Mrs Hudson. He tugged back the white fur cuff of the red velvet jacket and checked his wristwatch, then checked outside the front door to see if the car had arrived yet to take him to the party.
“Love you, too, dude.”
John did not think any of his shoes were ugly, but he thought he knew the ones Sherlock meant and so avoided them. He dressed smartly in dark grey wool trousers, a blue button-up shirt and argyle-patterned cardigan. Put on his coat and walked five minutes up the street, then back again, and straight up the stairs to Sherlock’s flat.
“We’re—”
“Thank you.”
An unsettling sensation of falling, then flinging upward. He’d dozed off, drink in hand. Ludicrous. Unaccountably, Sherlock’s cheeks flushed hot as he righted himself with his elbows.
“You are.”
, he texted back, then changed the subject.
“Brilliant.”
Sherlock thrust his hands into his coat pockets and stepped around John to go in first, a maneuver he knew was childish and unnecessary, but which put an upward tic in the corner of his lip nonetheless. There were children taller than Rosie and her Year Two colleagues standing by, looking puffed up with themselves; one of them passed Sherlock a sheet of green paper featuring a hand-drawn, top-down view of the room with the participants’ names in rows of unevenly-sized, not-quite-square boxes. A momentary glance at it, and Sherlock strutted ahead, not minding whether John followed.
, he texted in response,
“You’re in luck,” John told him, and reached into his jeans’ hip pocket for his phone. “Because I also have a foolproof memory tool thing called
“I will defend that child with my life,” Sherlock said, serious once more. “There is no one in the world better for her than you are. And I’ll die defending that, as well.”
“Sure. Right.” John pivoted, was not sure whether the man would follow, but eventually felt him coming along, at a distance. Inside his single room, he went into his duffel and easily put hands on a small box of wood matches. He made a mental note that they would need replacing as soon as he got out to the shops.
, and so he must—what, debase himself? beg forgiveness?—no. Accept the blame.
Had he
Rosie giggled and moved to receive Sherlock’s offered hug. “It’s not the best one,” she said. “Have you even seen them all?”
“Yeah,” he agreed. “Anyway, wanted to let you know. So I guess I’ll look forward to seeing you.”
“No trouble,” said Sherlock’s mother, “Seems you two are in a hurry to be off, anyway, so we’ll be leaving.”
Minutes later, Sherlock lay against a lumpy pile of pillows, his knees raised and apart, one hand over his closed eyes and the other lightly curved over the back of John’s neck. With a wet, swirling tongue, John teased and toyed with Sherlock’s foreskin, licked and tickled the throbbing crown of his prick. Sherlock wanted to encourage him but could articulate little more than a helpless cacophony of moans and sucking breaths.
“In the hopes of surviving this drive without combusting,” Sherlock said, “Your sister—”
“I anticipate a win; the New Jersey offense is in shambles currently, and our defense and goaltending are top-notch.”
“We can walk to our one, though, and that one’s a tube ride away.”
He held slim hope of a reply, as John had clearly been ignoring his messages for the best part of a fortnight. With a wide open schedule and a hateful lack of chaotic energy in the flat, what he really wanted was to ask for time with Watson—the weekend, at least, and that Monday would be a bank holiday—but he had a sense of needing to pick his way carefully through the next little bit. John was prickly and still held all the cards.
“Game day,” Sherlock announced, and drew the covers up around his shoulders to keep in their body heat. John was already awake beside him, looking at his phone, which he put face down on the bedside table.
Well, there is no need to hide here in any case. He only has to go downstairs, apologise for what it’s worth now, and leave Sherlock in peace. Oh, and also stop drinking every bloody day. Refusing to dwell on that now, he gets to his feet as slowly as he can, not wishing for Sherlock to have to fetch him from the floor. The first few steps are taking all the energy out of him, but he manages to get down the stairs without falling. And then, the kitchen, bracing himself for whatever might happen in there.
He sits down quickly, the weight of the time he’s been gone adding to the hangover.
Can you imagine what must have gone through her head for her to call at eleven in the evening, crying because she’s certain your pupils were highly dilated earlier that day and that you’ve been strangely quiet for the past two weeks.
“Then what do you propose we do? I can’t stay here if I know that this is what you’re going through.”
“I’m sorry, I never meant -”
“South Africa. The coast. I need to be somewhere warm. Preferably with an ocean view, but that’s negotiable, I suppose,” Sherlock says, making the final decision right in that moment.
“I can never be what she doesn’t have, though. I can never be that for her,” Sherlock said quietly, the familiar guilt twisting in his guts.
“She can nap upstairs,” Sherlock mutters, but he knows it’s not going to happen.
John breathes in, hand clenching by his side. “Your point?”
On the way there, he wonders if he should have called John to invite him along and then decides better of it, reasoning that he needs some time away. There is a tiny voice inside, though, that says
I’m going to level with you. If you’re out there, if my miracle came true, now would be a fucking good time.
“For me,” Sherlock says.
“Hey,” John replies softly, reaching out under the table to rub Sherlock’s knee reassuringly. “It’s just me. It’s still just me, Sherlock.”
It’s like it had to be this way. We had to end up together, just so.”
I should start by saying this isn’t the first letter I’ve written you, but I intend to give this one. Or least try. That’s not my strongest suit: trying. Would you believe me if I told you that I came twice to Baker Street, envelope in hand, but never managed to drop it off? I think Mrs Hudson saw me once, probably wondered why I wasn’t ringing the bell or simply going in. But I’m thinking she might have figured it out somehow because she never asked me to come in. Never forced me to go up those stairs and give you the damn letter once and for all.
“Fine, fine. But please explain this to me: why chase after a baby when there’s grown up humans around.”
I’m sure you do.
breathe because everything else went away.
John Watson
“Joooooohn,” Sherlock whines, a petulant child as ever.
“Sorry,” Sherlock says when John sits down next to him.
I’m afraid too. Still.
I want you to know everything, Sherlock.
I’m sure Mycroft has told you. I’d really like it if you and Mary could come by before I leave. It would be good to see you both and say goodbye.
“Yeah, okay,” John says, “Shift up, let me lie down.”
“Thank you,” Sherlock breathes out. “Thank you.”
He leans back a bit to look into John’s eyes, wondering what they contain. The poets speak of miracles and vast oceans, but all he discovers is what has always been there. Yet he can’t find it in himself to be disappointed. How could he be, when it’s the same eyes that broke the last of his restraints and tore down the Jericho he flaunted so proudly all his life? Literature alone couldn’t encompass the constancy staring back at him. It couldn’t even try.
“Mmm.”
“You’ll see.”
Sherlock rolls his eyes but goes to him willingly, kissing him for very long seconds and by the time they pull away, John finds himself already hungry for more.
“Yes, of course.”
“Nothing,” Sherlock eventually replies indignantly, shutting his laptop and pulling all his papers into a messy pile on the coffee table. He turns his attention to Rosie to shift the vibe. “Hello, little Watson. How are you today?” he asks as she toddles over to the couch and tries to climb up.
Dust. Everywhere one looks, dust. Little swirls of it dancing on the pavements and through the flat if they leave the door open for too long when reentering. It settles on everything. Food, tabletops, faucets, cushions, hair, forearms, knees. It sometimes feels as though they are swallowing it, sputtering on the dredges of a ball of dirt as it struggles down their oesophagus.
“From time to time, yes,” John says. “I’m also getting something for Lestrade and Mrs Hudson. Maybe Mike, too.”
“I… don’t know.”
“But that’s just it, Sherlock. I was selfish. Am. I promise that going forward, though, I won’t be. I know I’ll give you all of me. If you’ll have me.”
Sherlock’s mouth shuts closed, but he’s still fuming. John can tell from the way he’s holding his body, tense as though at the ready; for a fight, or to run.
brief
I hope you’re right. SH
“Come here,” John growls, crushing their mouths together once more in a desperate, almost bruising kiss that Sherlock can’t help but become lost in.
“Just so,” Sherlock smiled and leaned in for a soft kiss.
“I’m going to have a shower, I’ll be right back,” he says, hoping Sherlock will be fast asleep by the time he’s done.
Eventually, at ten to two, John shows up, a nervously wonky smile lighting up his face and Sherlock knows, right at that exact moment, that he’s doing the right thing. That no matter where this leads him, it’s too late to turn back now. Even if he has to dive in headfirst without any kind of support or ability, he knows he has to do it.
“We always used to make the bed.”
He draws in a little gasp of air as he sees himself. The little infinity sign on his chest could bring tears to his eyes right here in the tattoo parlour, if he let it. He glances up in the mirror and sees John’s reflection behind him, focused on Sherlock’s chest, eyes misty and mouth drawn into a tight line that Sherlock has come to know very well. It means he’s trying to hold back the tide of overwhelming emotion, too, usually unsuccessfully. He catches John’s eye before he looks away and there’s heat there; raw emotion and passion.
‘M at the pub with Lesstrade. He says hi. I say, “The charter of thy worth gives thee releasing.” See you around, Johnnn.
Now, though, Sherlock can’t help but feel guilt that he ever stopped trying. He knows,
And he means it.
“Still.”
“Sherlock,” he calls. “Shower.”
“I was thinking we could walk the last few streets,” Sherlock says shyly.
“A semicolon as in Project Semicolon. The movement where people tattoo semicolons on themselves in memory of those they’ve lost to suicide.”
“I don’t mind.”
Sherlock nods but still takes another biscuit before heading to the bedroom.
“Sometimes I forget they’re even here.”
“Yes,” John smiles. “But you have to know, it's been you since that very first night.”
“Sorry, I. I just want to. I want us to go home. If that’s okay,” Sherlock says, bashful.
A long moment passes without either of them saying anything. They don’t move, staying pressed together and exchanging quiet kisses now and again. John wishes they could remain this way forever. He wishes they never have to talk about this again, never have to even think of being apart.
“Boys, is something the mat– Did you bake those?”
John shifts closer, hating the gap between them on the mattress.
Suddenly, John pulls slightly back, far enough that he can look into Sherlock’s eyes but staying close enough that they’re still locked in their embrace.
Now, though, that’s all moot. John moved in shortly after it began, at first using the fact that his apartment was in a less populated area with fewer buildings, offering no protection from the winds. Sherlock hadn’t argued - hadn’t said much at all, just indicated that the room upstairs was, as ever, free. Now that the winds so clearly don’t discriminate, they have no excuses to fall back on. Not that they’ve tried to. It is what it is, and this is the comfortable territory that is well-worn beneath their fingertips; the spaces between words, the spaces where words should come.
“Sherlock,” he murmurs, touching the marked skin with shaking fingers.
John reaches for him again, taking Sherlock’s hand in his and pulling him back against him. “Don’t,” he whispers. “I only called him because I was terrified of this.”
Didn’t you penetrate Shlto? Or did he pentetrate you? Do you prefer to penetrate or be penetratded? I must admit I’d probably prefer to be penetrated by you but I suppose I’m not fussy either way. SH
Mostly, he thinks about the uncertainty that taints everything that has transpired. If he takes a deep breath, he’ll only choke on dust, browned phlegm seeping out of his mouth and nose like maggots out of a corpse. What he can’t stand, though, above all, is that, if John takes a deep breath, the same will happen. What use is he if he couldn’t even prevent that much?
“Bored,” he whispers, and John knows what that means. It’s different from the other
He feels Sherlock move closer, one of his hands sliding up his back and resting on his nape, “She tried to help, but the different degree of skin decomposition was a bit too hard for her to understand. Still, I’m sure she’ll soon make a wonderful assistant.”
“Are you excited?” he asks with a hint of hopefulness in his voice.
When there’s a lull in the conversation, though, John turns serious, asks, “How long?” and Sherlock doesn’t dare ask
“How’ve you been?” John asks nonchalantly.
Sherlock holds onto him tighter. “Last night, you… What we did…”
You can’t do this to yourself any longer - your body won’t allow it. Not with the life you live, not with the recent events, not with the way you take care of your bloody transport.
Between Sherlock’s
“What if we’re not alone?”
"Look at me, love, look at me." It takes a long moment before Sherlock manages to focus long enough to stare right at him, and John traces his lower lips with his thumb. "I love you, Sherlock."
John looks up, Sherlock holding up what seems to be an old journal.
“Hmmm,” Sherlock replies, obviously already doing so.
Nothing could make me stop loving you.
“I love you,” John whispers right onto his skin.
Want you. SH
He stands in the doorway to his old room, watching John with Rosie, illuminated only by her little twinkly lights. She’s almost asleep, so John’s singing is getting softer and softer:
“We don’t have to, I can tell them no,” Sherlock replies, talking too fast.
Sherlock is surprised. It’s the last thing he ever expected John would say. “Don’t tell me you’re some sort of virgin fetishist,” he finally replies in mock horror.
And now, tt feels as though he finally belongs to someone, and someone to him. He never knew that was in the realm of possibility, so he always tucked it far back into the recesses of his mind. Love seemed to happen for people of all types - good people, bad people, painfully mediocre people - but never to Sherlock Holmes. To be fair, he had never especially wanted it to or sought after it. And now, he has something more than that. He has a family. He has two people to come home to every day for the rest of his life and that somehow makes him feel as though everything is safe now. The demons he didn’t even know he was afraid of are put to rest.
and so
“You frightened me.”
“They’re probably using some kind of code,” Sherlock remarks, most likely talking to himself.
John rubs a hand over his nape. “Yeah. Maybe.”
John runs his fingers through Sherlock’s curls and Sherlock’s eyes drift half-closed, half-focused on the old episode of
The worst part is sleeping without you. I slept alone for all those years, and yet I’ve somehow grown so accustomed to sleeping next to somebody - not
London has Sherlock Holmes and, just for that, John is more than happy to be here.
Breathing out deeply, John catches up with him before he disappears.
“I’m not going to fall, John,” Sherlock replies with a long moan. “You got me.”
“And then we’ll see what happens, I suppose.”
Do you think about me, where you live? Where
but of
John chokes up on a sob, half smiling, too.
“What do you think of spending today in bed?” John asks, finding that he rather likes the sight of a naked Sherlock.
“I don’t hate them, John,” Sherlock says, kissing along his jaw and up his right cheek. “Those marks represent my journey back to you.”
On a brighter note, I want it all too. All you’ve described. Our room, the cup of tea, the nightmares and Rosie. Every bit. And as you said, the odds seem to be in our favor. Doesn’t it feel like a victory? Being finally able to see a happy ending to all this mess?
“John, John.”
They had woken up late in the morning, John waking up first still dizzy from the previous night. He had stayed still on the sofa for a long moment, staring at the ocean through the window and replaying their conversation and kisses over and over again. It still felt like some kind of dream - a really really good one - the kind he never allowed himself to remember after waking up. But this time, Sherlock was in the room next door, and John intended to kiss him again as soon as he woke up.
John looks away, “I could answer that question, but it would mean getting to the real part of everything.”
“Hey. It’s alright.” John reaches across the table and Sherlock takes the hint, offers his hand in return. “It’s still us, Sherlock. No matter what happens or doesn’t happen, I’ll always be glad that it’s still us.”
Alright, Sherlock, you asked for us be be bold, to dare, to take a jump.
Which brings him to the present dilemma. Well, not a dilemma per se. More of a… situation. An anticipated future state. One that he suspects he can’t overcome by sheer brainpower.
“Yes. I… didn’t see the need to do it over my heart, since you’re already permanently there, so this seemed like the most… logical placement.”
I can’t believe it’s been months since I last saw you.
Fuck. I. Sometimes I open a text message at work to text you something ridiculous that happened, but I’ve never actually called before. After all this time, the reflex is still there. It’s been nearly a year. God, I don’t think I’ll ever fucking get over you, will I? If you were here, you’d know the answer to that, or you’d call me an idiot and make fun of my jumper. Either way, you’d know what to do. You always knew what to do, even though you’re a colossal prick and I’m still
Sherlock looks at John, sensing the shift into the more intense. “I see. Well. Good, then.”
Dear John
“Only if we get one for you, too,” he replies after a little while, voice raw with emotion.
John watches closely, pushing in and out slowly at first and then faster and deeper with each encouraging moan from Sherlock.
Sherlock pauses. John knows he’s testing his reaction. In control. He glances at him, silently encouraging him to continue.
John leans in, kissing him until Sherlock all but melts into the touch, a hand coming to stroke John’s nape softly.
Sherlock lifts his hands to grip John’s arms, steadying them in place. “I need…”
Written by
Sherlock looks back at him. “I should have been more supportive too.”
She cleans the area and places the stencil over his chest in the position they discussed the last time he was in and, once the transfer is done, hands him a handheld mirror and asks if it’s okay.
Their bodies melt into one, discovering the other all over again, and John rolls them around, pinning Sherlock to the mattress. He kisses down his jaw, neck and shoulder blade, letting his tongue sink and his teeth mark. Sherlock is moaning, the sound almost too loud in the quiet room, and John engraves each and every one of them. He can’t forget this, can’t let himself forget how brilliant, how powerful it all feels. He thrusts against Sherlock, locking their groins together and sealing back their lips, drinking all of Sherlock’s gasps and whimpers.
“So that’s a yes?”
But the lies, Sherlock. All the lies, the trust she expected from me, the one she broke without a hint of hesitation. She shot you, for God’s sake. She shot you and then threatened to finish the job if you told me. How could I still love her? How could I still want to build a future with her? I’m not ashamed to say so, but if she hadn’t been pregnant, I would have left her. But she was the mother of my child, and I couldn’t let my own daughter grow up alone with an assassin as a mother. I thought I could make her change, stop her from hurting anyone else, but the lies kept on coming. There were nights when she didn’t even come home after Rosie was born. I had no idea where she went or what she did, and I was too afraid she’d leave with Rosie that I didn’t say a word.
Sherlock pursed his lips and hummed, a downward sliding tone John did not like the sound of. What was even more troubling to hear was Sherlock’s artificially formal reply, in a register he usually saved for strangers he had future uses for and so was unwilling to offend. John’s shoulders stiffened.
“I know just the place. It’s a revolving rooftop place, fortieth story—”
John tipped his head back toward the open door. “Just moving in. Mrs Hudson said there was another tenant, I suppose that’s you.” He cleared his throat. “John Watson.”
Much later, on the bus back to the hotel, Sherlock swiped at his phone’s screen, looking for a CRUZR hookup. A midweek night in a relatively small city revealed fewer blue dots on the map than he generally preferred, but beggars, choosers, and so on. He pressed ahead.
“That chimney sweep had his eye on you,” he said, with something like accusation in it, which Sherlock found puzzling. The sweep had arrived six minutes past the appointed hour and had not brought a helper to hold his ladder, so had pressed John into service while he made his climbs onto various sections of Stonefield’s roof, and had looked annoyingly amused when Sherlock insisted he wait to be paid until Sherlock was assured the blockage in the western flue had been completely removed; he would tolerate no more black smoke backing up into the withdrawing rooms.
“Probably not for a month.”
“Fuck him,” Sherlock said casually.
“Really done.”
“Not at all.”
“Me, too, I’ll admit.” John came near—cutting a pleasing figure in a tight t-shirt and slim-cut khaki shorts—and Sherlock reached for him, cradling John’s bearded jaw in both hands.
John kissed him again, a quick suck at his jaw, and hummed, and settled. Sherlock scraped up the spunk with the edge of the bed sheet, lay panting with his hands on his chest, one thumb working absently across his nipple, which felt bruised and raw. John’s breathing gave him away as having dropped back to sleep almost instantly—in the morning he might not even remember how he’d mumbled praise and nestled up close and kissed—but Sherlock lay awake for too long, too warm and too cold, thinking about his game, which was better, and his man, who was perfect, and his future and his past and his money and his car and his brother, parents, useless London flat, every stupid thing.
Sherlock hid his shock in his napkin, rubbing it roughly against his lips before balling it up and dropping it on his plate. He had been anticipating rough treatment, the scalding humiliation of a demotion—however temporary—to be served in a perspiration-free sweater at the far end of the Brawlers’ bench. And here came his coach wearing kid gloves, stroking him, coddling, trying to brace him up despite the obviousness of his ongoing, irreversible collapse. He’d have rather the former. It was more embarrassing to be placated and patronised than it would have been to be picked apart and shamed. His performance did not rate encouragement; Sherlock deserved—and would have welcomed—a beating.
“Oh,” John stammered, “You mean now? Right now we’re going?”
“I’d rather be a hockey player,” John said simply, not much in it, but Sherlock felt it like a punch in the gut. He slid his hand up along John’s spine to cup his hand around the back of his neck. He worked his thumb against the back corner of John’s jaw, and John let him for a moment, but then rose and walked away, and shut himself behind the bathroom door. Sherlock, feeling useless and lost for words even though none had been asked for, gathered the by-then empty dishes and carried them to the sink, an endeavour that required two trips. He was reaching for a knife to slice the cake when John emerged, rubbing his forehead with fingers and thumb.
Laughed and slapped his hand over his mouth to stop laughing--christ is that the--shh!--sthat the time?--and knew he should drink water but the tiny fucking room had no sink. Blankets. Pulled them down, wrapped them around, curled tight on his side on the floor by the bed.
“Ankle’s still just a bit tender,” Sherlock replied. “Probably mild atrophy, from the splint.”
John tilted the phone once more, and breathed, “Now you.” Sherlock searched for a good angle, giving John a fairly close view of his curled fingers and thumb pumping up and down in a loose fist.
“I’m flattered by your interest, but--”
“Thank you. Thanks.” John was beaming. “All right, talk soon. Love you.”
Having ascertained that all her bodily needs were addressed and met—he’d remind her about the bathroom again in thirty minutes—Sherlock was ready to move on to the more diverting matters at hand.
“No?”
Sherlock offered him tea, which John declined, then whiskey, which he accepted. Sherlock poured them each a splash and directed John to sit at the kitchen table, where there were five separate, neatly stacked piles of paperwork. He ticked them off, touching each one with the tip of his finger. “Relevant medical history for the past thirteen years; heart, lung, and brain specialist visits since 2010; visiting nurses and other at-home attendants; hospice records; and the wife’s notes taken contemporaneously during his final hospitalisation and the period in hospice care.”
Lestrade carried on as if Sherlock had not cracked the grim joke. “Too bad about LoPresti’s streak but he asked not to start, and if he’s not a hundred percent, I’m not going to risk putting him in.”
“Childhood home?” Sherlock asked.
“Leaving town soon, I imagine,” Steven offered, and Sherlock knew what might follow.
“Is tonight a good night?” he inquired.
“Very funny.”
“I don’t mind.”
“What, really Sherlock Holmes?
“Look at you,” Steven muttered, over and over, “Fucking
“Excellent!” Sherlock smacked his hands together and looked pleased, like a kid who’d just been told he could set up the tent in the back garden for the night. “Pack a bag; we’ll be gone until tomorrow.”
“Of course. I have a Macallan 18; is that all right?”
Later that week, John had a final text-chat with his therapist; she’d helped him find references for a couples-and-family specialist they were already meeting with in person, while they sorted themselves into their new/old niches.
After a moment, he said wearily, “I appreciate you defending me.”
Mrs Hudson snapped his photo with an old point and shoot camera; John wondered if there was anywhere left locally to develop the film, but not for long, as the car the veterans’ charity had sent for him pulled up and sounded its horn. He took up his cane, waved Mrs Hudson a hearty goodbye and was on his way.
Sherlock said nothing; neither of them moved.
Digging his nose in between John’s pillow and the side of his face, Sherlock whispered, “Still love you.”
“For you, maybe. Worried he’ll tell me about how many of your crusty wank-socks he stumbled over when you were a teenager?”
“Mincemeat, at this time of year, one imagines,” John joked. Sherlock stared blankly at him for a half-second before carrying on as if John had not spoken.
SH: That’s fine. I think that could be quite fun, being a meme.
(trope alert! trope alert! ** ** Coffee Shop ** ** trope alert! trope alert!)
“Self-reflective?”
“Let me buy you dinner,” John suggested. “Then take you to bed.”
“Night, now.”
The stonemason had finished his day’s work and gone, and dark was settling in. John could not resist cutting one more path about the place-- their own place, where they would make their own way--in a wobbling circle, as far as the creek and wide of the foundation so he could stand back and look. The house was barely begun, just walls and a chimney mostly finished, but John’s heart swelled looking at the shell of what would be.
Past Sherlock’s shoulder, John spotted the edge of a green glass ashtray that had always lived on the mantel, pushed far back on top the fridge where Rosie wouldn’t see it. He sipped the whiskey and grimaced his appreciation, then set the glass down on the table.
Ryan crushed toward him like a moving wall, but just as he crossed the hashmarks, the Demons big centerman caught an edge and went down onto his side, unable to slow his forward momentum, sliding wildly across the ice. Sherlock knew what was coming and braced himself; despite expecting it, the loud, gunshot crack of Ryan’s shinbone hitting the metal goal post was shocking. Sherlock’s head felt light and he swallowed bile.
Sherlock murmured, “Let me suck you.”
“Right.”
“Need a hand?”
John’s eyes reddened and he cursed. Sherlock touched his shoulder on his way by.
To his credit, the driver seemed relatively nonplussed by the flagrant, man-on-man action coming to a bubble in his back seat, though the rise of his eyebrows as his gaze met Sherlock’s in the rearview mirror seemed to hold at least a mild plea for mercy.
John considered demurring again, but caught sight of Sherlock’s profile and decided to walk up to the edge. It had been forever since he’d had anyone. Even longer since he’d had a friend. And Sherlock was a bit weird, but god he was gorgeous. Only seemed to half-know it, too, which made it even worse. Or. Better.
It wasn’t hard to find a man free for an afternoon assignation, given the financial and business district lay adjacent to the arena. Sherlock scrutinised the photos to assure himself, as much as was possible, that they were legitimate. The address he was given was of an office tower, nothing to distinguish it, glass and brass and pink marble floors. Pressboard instead of real wood in the lobby, though, a remodel in the 2010s done on the cheap that probably made the developer a very rich man. Upon signing in to the visitors’ log, noting the name of the thirty-fourth floor business he’d been told to report to, Sherlock put together that the real estate tycoon with poor taste in finishings was none other than the man he’d enticed into a hookup.
Sherlock slid an arm around John’s back, turned to Jordan and cocked an eyebrow. “You’re coming?”
Sherlock heaved a great sigh, unashamedly naked with bedclothes carelessly arranged to provide only minimal modesty, leaning heavily on one elbow while waving the other hand through the air.
Hot gusts of wet breath against his shoulder and neck; a flying bead of saliva landing on the inner fold of Sherlock’s ear. “Fuck you, you’re so hot. You make me—” The words choked off, coalescing in a shout that sound as much full of rage—possibly revulsion—as it did pleasure. Sherlock felt the hot-pulsing ooze between his thighs, a thick throb against his perineum. He worked to get his hand beneath him; his prick was leaking, aching, and he needed to come and get the fuck out of there though he couldn’t have said which of these needs was the greater. Steven shifted just enough so Sherlock was free to fuck his own hand, thrusting hard into the clammy cage of fingers and palm. Steven had at some point released his grip on Sherlock’s wrist, but all at once his hand was halfway around Sherlock’s neck, thumb dug into the notch at the base of his skull, fingers pressing his throat, something Sherlock never allowed and would never tolerate, but instead of annoyed or frightened, he felt relieved, and so he let Steven carry on. Someone was finally giving him what he deserved.
“I didn’t. Blazing. Just feel her skin, John; I knew she had fever.”
“Nothing like,” Sherlock dismissed with a shrug. “He pulled his swing, and I was turning; barely a glance.” His lips curled upward and assumed one of his boastful poses. “Just a kiss.”
“Oh, hell, is that the time?”
“Hm? Oh. Nothing. Headache.” They started back toward the theatre. “Watson, when you have something on your mind, how do you sort it out?”
Anyway. He has no fear of work. Has talents--for the flowers, and he draws, he’s an artist though he doesn’t know it. He’s kind. Hard when he needs to be, though, a real man. Kind to me. Always kind to me. He was a soldier in the war, his shoulder bothers him when the weather’s damp. Blue eyes.
“Is that Wonderful Christmas Time playing over and over?” he asked.
“Maybe in a bit,” John half-agreed, and sipped his coffee, clearly in no hurry to change locations.
, and finally settled on clearing his throat and finishing, “You’ll find it when you do a tree with Sherlock.” John made a mental note to ask Mrs Hudson to remind Sherlock when the time came that he should buy a tree and make a date with Rosie to decorate it. It had always been John’s duty to arrange for Christmas trees and pots of tulips in the spring and a new jumper and warm gloves for Rosie on bonfire night; he had little faith that Sherlock would remember to do any of it under his own steam. “Two Christmas trees! That’s not bad, is it?” he enthused, and Rosie looked to be thinking it over.
“I owe you one,” John said.
“That’s done,” he announced, satisfied with himself, not fishing for praise but far from averse to it, should it come.
“Mind my own business,” George said knowingly. “I get it; I’m not always alone at three a.m., either.”
Sherlock waited until he was just about to sign his name to venture, “You don’t know Mycroft Holmes, do you?”
“Don’t think I haven’t noticed the smell of it on you, now you mention it.”
“Love an iced biscuit,” Sherlock said. “Even an inferior one.”
“Of course,” Sherlock said, meaning it two ways. He transferred the cake back to its box, to return it to the fridge. “Going right to sleep, then,” he ventured, an almost-question.
He crouched down to receive his hug, kissed her plump cheek, and with one fingertip directed a loose strand of blonde hair into the topmost divot in one of her plaits.
“It must be gratifying to know she has such pride in your accomplishments,” Sherlock mused, grimly wondering what it must be like to have an engaged and supportive family.
“I don’t think I did.”
He felt a bit cheerful as he descended the stairs, and that was something rare, indeed.
After a day spent raking up deadfall from beneath the hedges, John’s nose was numb and wanted to run, and his fingers were stiff with cold. Despite these discomforts, with only an hour to pass before he was expected in Stonefield’s downstairs kitchen for supper with the staff, John had yet another project to do, and so wasted no time. Once he’d scrubbed away the day’s work from his hands and face, and the back of his neck, he angled the lamp just so, hunched over the rickety little table in the corner of his shared cottage bedroom, and squinted  concentration as he worked.
“I want to see,” John insisted.
John felt caught-out, and shuffled where he stood, looking again at his damp shoes. The silly coffee had been an extravagance, and the universe had served him his karma for wasting cash he shouldn’t spend, immediately and spectacularly. He wanted to do penance. He wanted Sherlock not to waste his own money on John’s frivolous impulses.
Eventually they rearranged limbs and pillows and found each other’s sour mouths for deep, probing kisses. John held Sherlock by the jaw and wiped the cum from his face with a corner of the sheet, dirty-smiling and giving a wink that made Sherlock wrap arms around and pull him close, heaving out the final sigh of the night.
Sherlock started the game in Chicago and the Mavericks got one by him in the first forty seconds. Less than two minutes later, another. He held them off the rest of the night, but it was a slog, and the Brawlers’ offense couldn’t penetrate. They left Chicago with another in the loss column.
?” Sherlock asked suddenly. John gave him a gratifyingly enthusiastic nod.
John looked at him with something like surprise. “Yeah. Really hate it. I do. Thanks for saying.”
“Visual disturbances,” Sherlock said knowingly.
“The meatball sandwiches,” John asserted, his tone indicating for Sherlock to disagree would mean John would carry on pretending annoyance.
There was nothing else to say or ask, so John finally did put the phone aside, face down on the coffee table beside an empty glass he’d poured a beer in, vainly hoping he might ride the buzz all the way to sleep. Instead he had a headache and an uncomfortable bubble below his left ribs.
John gave him a comical, lifted-brow look that said he knew better about Sherlock’s nature. His eyebrows stayed high, but inched toward each other above his nose. “You’re wearing a suit?”
“Already ordered it.”
“I thought it made sense. You weren’t getting around so well. Or.” John’s hands were balled tight and he sunk them into the pockets of his coat, gestured something like a surrender with them, widening the opening. “I was telling myself that, as an excuse. Either way, it was the wrong thing to do, and I’m sorry for it.”
“You’ll start. Lestrade’s word is good; he’s not going to jerk you around just to shut you up. That’s not his style.”
“I don’t know.”
Both welcomed the chance to fall back on gentle joking, a softer place to rest amidst a rocky slog through all the old muck and mire of their failed relationship.
John felt his eyebrows crumple. “How long ago?” he asked, gathering the history to put in the chart. “I’ll have a feel of it?”
“You’re not doing yourself any favours feeding this beast,” John reminded him gently. “Everything’s as it should be; you know that. You’re the one who taught it to me.”
John laughed and took a few long strides away, skated in fast to spray Sherlock with snow.
“It’s just that you type quite slowly,” Rosie grinned.
“To meet you.”
“Mm.”
John kissed his chin, made a rumbling annoyance of the mattress as he rose and made his way to the bath. Sherlock began to feel the chill in the air that hadn’t mattered before, and longed for the quilts but couldn’t bring himself to retrieve them. The twilight of sleep, mind empty, body freed of all tension, was too delicious to abandon. A wet warmth pressed into his palm, and he swiped at the worst of it, thought the gooseflesh that rose on the damp places was almost worse than the sticky streaks that would have dried before too long. He dropped the towel to the floor as John dragged up the bedclothes to cover him, and dug his nose into the pillow, awaiting the return of John’s warm, naked body into the bed so Sherlock could nuzzle up to him in the last moments before sleep took him.
John’s voice was quiet. “Why doesn’t your dad come out?” he wondered, flicking glances toward he closed door at the back of the kitchen. “You’re only here a few days.”
John chuckled, closed-eyed, and shook his head. As ever, one could only do one’s best to explain complex situations and ideas to even the brightest child, and never anticipate quite how the information would be processed.
JW: Smelling strongly of dirty jocks and dirty socks!
“Well, who wouldn’t? Look at you.”
There was a tantalising, too-brief display as John unpeeled and tossed his towel, then started to dress. Sherlock licked the roof his mouth. He’d woken John with lips open and roving the pleasingly hairy terrain of his thighs, wandering where he would, until John dug fingers into Sherlock’s hair and laugh-groaned, panting urgent encouragement.
Sherlock shook his head slightly, didn’t believe it, didn’t want to talk anymore, but would listen a bit longer.
Rosie whinged a bit, but it seemed rote. She knew his answer, but was compelled to express her disappointment just as surely as she had been to ask in the first place. John was relieved she had not asked for a baby brother called George—or perhaps called Peach Smoothie, after one of the newest tiny plastic cats.
“If?”
Rosie was half-off her chair, as ever, more interested in the café’s other patrons than she was in her jam-smeared toast. Sherlock pressed the lid onto her still half-full cup of hot milk sprinkled too generously with cinnamon and nutmeg.
“No more stories online, nothing on the telly. Who are you really?”
“She told me it’s a werewolf,” the teacher replied. “We find a lot of monster-mania in Year Two,” she explained, sweet-sounding, affectionate toward her charges. “It’s an age where children are recognizing themselves as individuals apart from their parents, which can be a bit scary. So I find a lot of them develop a bit of an affinity for monsters, things that scare them a bit.”
A foot stroking his ankle, the perfect curve of his bum beneath a roving hand, and the long slide down the back of his thigh, fingers tucking in behind his knee and pulling to draw it up between, a tangle of legs that allowed them to be closer, chest to chest, with hands between. A gentle swirl and a soft digging-in to the hair around his prick, accidental-on-purpose sweep of fingers over the skin of his length, already half-hard, and knowing just the way to please him.
John shrugged. “True enough,” he allowed. “I’ve some ideas.”
“I’ll wake you after a while, then.”
Sherlock smiled a bit and lowered his eyes; he felt sure he would never become accustomed to John’s freely-spoken admiration of him.
John bit back an urge to blurt something about Sherlock only having three friends. Perhaps those were just the three he’d gotten around to writing thus far. He was having a party in a few weeks, after all; certainly he wasn’t going to have it just for three friends.
Sherlock held up a finger and turned back to John. In low tones, he quickly explained, “What million-pound estate agent takes a weekend off in the busy season? Only one planning to drink and fuck his way through four days and nights of London Pride.” John tilted his head, allowing that Sherlock’s deduction was likely the correct one. Sherlock straightened up and rubbed his palms together, then reached for the button on his suit jacket. “My partner and I have a proposition for you, in that case, of something we may be able to work out, right now.”
. As she was finishing the K, without looking up and with no particular inflection, she asked, “Do I put the mum who had me?”
Mags: First of all, congratulations on doing something really brave and just generally awesome.
“I do remember a time when he reliably aimed his fury at the aggressing party, though, and not at you,” Mycroft said pointedly. He and John had never gotten on, each viewing the other with suspicion and distrust. As such, neither would ever miss a chance to point out the other’s faults, and Sherlock had gotten it from both sides for over a decade, endlessly defending each to the other. Sherlock let his brother’s observation go by; not only did he not wish to argue about tangential matters, he could not argue against the truth.
“Football. They have practice on Monday and Wednesday, and matches on Saturday morning.”
Sherlock could not wholeheartedly or easily say he agreed with the assessment, but as with so much of what had gone between them in the past however long (ten months, two weeks, six days since the argument that finally broke their backs), Sherlock was not in a position to argue. All the risk was his; all the authority, John’s. So in the end, Sherlock supposed in some manner he did agree that nothing had changed.
And more besides.
Sherlock was pleased. “Shall I invite your man in Seattle to the game? Old time’s sake?”
“Well.” John harrumphed again, and shifted substantially. He shrugged. “Archie.”
“We won’t need you that late,” Sherlock assured him.
He worried about losing his job. He could be traded, demoted to second string in some far-off city he’d never get used to because Boston was the closest the US had to his beloved, longed-for London—and even it was not all that close. He could get busted down to Bridgeport; the thought of making such a distinctly-backward step made him queasy. He was worried about his stats. His reputation. His shot at more trophies, more championships, time to sort out his post-retirement career, which no longer seemed necessarily years off. It had been a long time since he’d been so preoccupied, so anxious, so sleepless.
“Video chat, maybe?” John ventured, looking at the desk where the computer had been photographed and was by then being removed by uniformed officers to transport to Sherlock’s on-call hacker. “But there was a game showing there.”
Sherlock let John drag him by the hand across the dance floor.  “What’s your hurry?”
“Dirty hit?”
Sherlock half-smiled--curse that, too--and nodded tersely. “Cooking is only science, and I’m a scientist.”
“In a minute. What about you? Going out tonight?”
“Sure?”
,” the teacher said, and her face flickered a moment of true alarm. “She is very invested in the idea that she is a werewolf.”
“You like him. It’s his only Christmas song.”
John cleared his throat. “I don’t mean to cut into your time, hanging about. I should be on my way.”
Sherlock felt a panic welling up, like the urge to vomit, but he nodded and pursed his lips against an instinct to protest that it was his day to collect her. Bending to retrieve the crumpled letter, he smoothed it between his fingers and thumbs.
They are both super handsome in person (and probably also on the phone).
“There is only jam where my muscles once were,” Sherlock reported.
By the time Sherlock located his phone and lifted it to where it belonged, John’s face was once more visible on the screen, a sweetly stupid grin soft on his lips.
“Remind me your name?” Sherlock asked, leaning in beside his partner’s ear.

“My fault,” came a familiar voice, and John stopped scrambling for napkins long enough to register that the man who’d managed to get behind him without setting off all his internal alarms was none other than his upstairs neighbour, Sherlock Holmes.
“You don’t trust me to let you see her? Have I not made sure of it, all this time? Bent myself in knots to make it happen. Even when I thought it wasn’t safe. Even when the sight of you made my stomach sick.”
John’s voice roughened as he began, “Can’t take my eyes off his chest, first of all. The only other man I’ve seen wear his tailored shirts that tight, is you.”
John panted and hummed against him, laving a wide tongue over his hole to wet it, then licking the wet back into his mouth. Sherlock cursed and his hand against the wall slipped; he was sweating; his muscles were trembling. John drew away, one hand on Sherlock’s hip, and glancing over his shoulder Sherlock watched John shove two blunt fingers deep into his mouth, roll his tongue around them, and slip them out again. The next moment, they were pressing against him, trying to open him.
Sherlock walked him out of the hotel suite, allowed himself to be fondled (shoulder, elbow, his hands for rather longer than seemed appropriate) and even to be kissed on the cheek, then shut the door and paused in the kitchenette, seeking hydration. The light from the sitting room barely spilled over the bar differentiating the two spaces, so it was the bulb inside the mini-fridge that put a spotlight on the spilled-out contents of George’s emptied pockets, in a heap on the countertop. Sherlock spun the cap off a bottle of cold lemon-lime soda and gulped down a few swallows, half-emptying the bottle, then belched.
John strode toward the small fire extinguisher mounted on the wall, but Sherlock waved him off.
is this?”
He thought of a real threesome he and John had had with a twinky waiter in Seattle, of John watching him giving head—not unlike this one in the video, chin wet, swallowing impossibly deep. Imagined that instead of watching him, John had urged him onto all fours as the muscle queen was doing to the lanky one, teasing Sherlock’s hole that way, with his prick—nearly that long, just that thick—rubbing it along the cleft to tease him with promises of more to come. Sherlock rolled his palm over the head of his prick, licked his lips, envisioned himself with a cock in his mouth, deep in, holding his tongue down. John’s cock wet with slick, pressing hard to force Sherlock open, slow and steady, holding his hip. John’s fingers curling into the flesh at the top of Sherlock’s thigh, pulling his hips back where he wanted him. Sherlock sucking, licking, and John fucking, fucking. . .
On their last day in Vermont, Thurston and Kim excused themselves to bed early, with blatantly false claims of exhaustion John readily accepted rather than contemplate the fact of his sister and his former teammate in a heated clutch.
Face to face, more kisses, deep and then lighter, their loud breath evolving into moans, and Sherlock fumbled in the bedside drawer for the same old bottle, and John took it and squeezed out exactly as much as they needed—some for you, more for me—and with entangled fingers they reached down. John guided Sherlock’s fingers around his thick shaft, showed him just the way, grunted and kissed him and took him in hand. John’s hair tickled Sherlock’s chin, caught lightly against the end-of-day stubble there, as he tilted his head down to watch them stroking each other, forearms crossed and brushing.
“Perhaps so, but he took them all when he moved to his new flat. Certainly I’m not going to buy any; I don’t need reading glasses.” He re-stacked her papers and squared up the edges. “Watson, are you tired?” he asked abruptly, sliding everything back into her rucksack. She was down to her last few bits of pretzel and cashew.
“Well,” John grinned, slapping his palms together, then warming them. “To all a good night, then.”
“Oh. You’re not--?”
“Maybe so,” Raynham allowed, though Sherlock felt he was being patronised. “But I’m looking at where the pucks are getting by you, and we can’t ignore there’s a weak spot. The rest of your game looks good. But if we can just dig into this issue a little, and at least rule out some possible reasons, we might figure out how to make sure you look good all over the net, you know?”
—on my way to meet with a client. You understand.” Sherlock squatted down and his left knee made a troubling crunching noise but he ignored it to receive Rosie’s embrace. “I’ll see you Sunday morning.” Regaining his feet, Sherlock nodded at the teacher, who quickly excused herself to attend to another student, far down the row.

“Maybe. Meet an NHLer; don’t know that it mattered it was me. They’re so excited about hockey. All the way back up here, I kept thinking, Was I like that?”
“It’s no use. Stay down,” Sherlock repeated. Ryan was on knees and elbows, with his head between his hands, snarling. He stayed down.
“Have you given up the cane? Maybe this time it’s gone for good,” Sherlock mused, and John would have thought he was taking the piss, but his gaze was open and expectant, as if none of this line of discussion was new to John.
“Watson, my apologies, but I only stopped in to have a look at the best display in the room—those in the know might even say, in the
, all things he’d heard before yet never tired of. Indeed, there was all of everything he’d always enjoyed while on the prowl for hookups, but on a comfortable bed, with the lights on. John was his perfect partner—horny and game, hard and hot, handling Sherlock’s prick selfishly, as if making Sherlock come was all he needed or wanted—and Sherlock found he didn’t need, want, or even think about having anyone else when they were together.
More pages turned and John said, “God, he looks like you.”
As if sensing John’s concerns, he added, “I’ve a brother with his fingers in a lot of Her Majesty’s pies.”
John had nearly an hour before he would be forced to leave early to fetch Rosie; in the meantime he kept his mobile in the chest pocket of his shirt and returned to the exam room. Under the pretense of fetching a swab kit to culture the throat of a feverish pre-teen, he stepped out into the corridor just long enough to check news headlines. One confirmed fatality; multiple injured. For the first time in many years, he responded to a text from Mycroft.
John’s smile was wide and he stared at the ring, rubbing his own thumb over the textured surface. “This is really lovely. I’ve never seen anything like it.”
“Keep your shit out of my sight or it’s going down the toilet.”
Only Sherlock’s eyes moved, sliding up and sideways to look at John. Then his eyebrows rose.
“I want her things. I’ve brought this bag.”
“Uh, yeah!” John said with friendly sarcasm. “I’d be angry if you didn’t.”
“Then the stakes are high for both of us.”
After a breath-long silence, Sherlock said, “You know I’d never put her in danger.” He watched his own hand as he set his glass aside, to purposely miss whatever John’s reaction may be.
“He doesn’t see me very much. It was a long time since I slept at home.”
Their coach was more intense during his second intermission remarks, pointing out at least one fuck-up by every player.  Sherlock had tipped his mask onto the top of his head out of respect for Lestrade but he kept his eyes cast down in front of him, picking out discoloured spots on the floor to focus on instead of listening to the list of his team’s faults. Whatever they were doing mattered little if Sherlock couldn’t hold back the Rush from scoring on them.
Afterward, they shared the bath, languid and laughing as the water overtopped the tub and ran down between the floor’s wood slats. John couldn’t stop touching the ring. Sherlock closed his eyes and rested his head on folded arms, admiring John from a new angle. It was good, and he was grateful.
“Better,” Sherlock intoned, his voice kept quiet so only John would hear.
Sherlock stood with his near-empty cup of tea and Rosie’s near-full cup of warm milk, one in each gloved hand, near the Year Two queue-up spot in the school yard, while Rosie chased a boy and two girls around in bumble-bee zigzags, all of them shouting and with first-of-the-day energy he would have marveled at had it been less volume-intensive. He spotted John across the yard but could not motion to him or wave, so instead whistled, which caused a brief ripple of curious silence around him but which served to catch John’s attention and direct him.
“At least take a shower,” Steven suggested, nodding toward the en suite. “You can’t be in that much of a hurry.” He looked knowing, with a smile that appeared—at last—genuine and non-threatening. It was true Sherlock had made only cursory attempts to clear away the leavings with a few rough swipes of the throw blanket decorating the end of the bed, and the hairs of his thighs were sticking to (and painfully unsticking from) his skin. He thumbed at a flake of his own cum on the edge of one index finger. Eyeing the door to the bath, he inhaled, considering. The earlier urge to flee was subsiding, adrenaline diluted with oxytocin into the familiar wash of mellow empty-headedness, a near-overwhelming desire for sleep.
Rosie’s footsteps clicked down the stairs. John was shaking his head as he followed. Easily recognising a truly brilliant idea when one was shown him, Sherlock rang for a pizza.
John’s mouth hung open, and his glass hung in the air in front of his chest. He wasn’t sure why he was allowing Sherlock to talk to him in such a fashion, as if they were that sort of friends. Or as if John was a science experiment Sherlock was reporting on. He sipped the whiskey again and put the topic aside. Anyway, he was distracted by another odd thing that was going on just then.
Steven kept pounding hard between his thighs, his hips smacking loudly against Sherlock’s arse. In time with it, he grunted out, “Yeah. You. Will.” He changed the angle, thrusting upward, holding Sherlock’s hip in place, challenging Sherlock’s balance. “Come. Come. Come on,
John gestured at the telly with his chopsticks, and said around a mouthful of teriyaki, “There. That’s where we need to go. During the bye week.” He chewed, gulped. “Pass me my phone, I’ll book it.”
“Mm.”
Sherlock sat stone-faced on the stool, staring at LoPresti in goal even when play moved to the far end. He seethed with self-recrimination. In his younger years he may have put on a show of anger, smashing his stick against the boards on his way through the door or shouting curses at the ref and linesmen for not making calls against the Brawlers’ opponents that might have changed the pace and mood of the game. But displays of extreme, personal emotion were not the Brawlers’ way. You did your job, and if you sucked at it, you sat your arse down and let someone else take over, for the good of the team. No complaining. No tantrums.
“No hurry.”
“Holmes, they’re getting lucky on you; their passing plays look pretty sloppy. Keep your head in it, eyes open. Their offense is no match for our D; do your job and we’ll get out of this alive.”
You spoil me with love talk, with admiring gazes and sensual pleasure to the very pinnacle of ecstasy, to the verge of madness, and I am ever humbled by it, ever grateful for it. Words escape me, though, John--my hero, my true north, my bright star--words stick in my head and my voice fails me.
So bored.
It was John’s turn to chuckle.
Mags: We’re making a meme happen.
Mired as he was in a remembered dream of the worst of times, Sherlock was startled by the click of the interior door opening as the light died. John reached to swing the bedroom door shut, didn’t miss a step of the familiar journey around to the far side of the bed, even in total dark. Sherlock could make out his silhouette, heard the dull ring of his belt buckle and the shush of his jeans falling around his ankles. He unbuttoned a few buttons then worked his shirt up and over his head. His hands along his sides, catching the waistband of his boxers and letting them fall. He reached for the covers; Sherlock helped hold them back.
“What about you? Good day at the office?” Sherlock’s eyes wouldn’t open; he curled his toes, then flexed them, while John made circles around his arch.
John cleared a strange tightness from his throat, and his eyes prickled. He nodded, and turned to go.
wrestle-fucking that had just transpired between them.
Sherlock’s fingers jigged agitation against the door handle. There was an alley, unfenced car park, residential road under construction—
John didn’t look away from the window, but he could see Sherlock half-nod, in his peripheral vision. The cab turned in to Baker Street and in a few moments they were once again on the pavement, looking at a building John lived in, that didn’t feel like home.
“Sherlock, you’ll be there?”
Trust me when I tell you Mike and I did NOT expect to be the ones interviewing the now-even-more-famous First Out Gay Couple in a Major Sports League. Honestly, we’re dorky girls with a blog about hockey thighs and playoff beards. Any resemblance to actual sports-journalists is purely coincidental. (As if you hadn’t noticed that 53% or more of our content is gifs from
Empty bottle and John had to stick his feet out the bottom of the blankets because they were too warm. Closed his eyes--room spinning--no good--opened his eyes. Turned over and pondered vomiting. Rode it out.
John frowned. “What’s that about? Couple of bad games? You’re hardly the only one to carry the blame. The second and third lines were looking incredibly sloppy on Tuesday.”
John felt his eyebrows pinching closer together, and he huffed.
“I’d have liked to have seen that.”
“Tomorrow?” Rosie asked instantly.
“Absolutely.” Sherlock did not get up from his chair as he had not been dismissed, but all his energy was urging him Up and Out. “Anything else?”
“I’ll have a chat with her,” John said, sounding defensive, and Sherlock could sense the tension radiating off him; he wanted out. Probably so he could blow up at Sherlock for exposing her to morbid and unsavoury things, which had become a theme of theirs over the years, as if John had not been a surgeon, did not own countless textbooks packed with full-colour photos of exposed ropes of muscle and gooey organs.
SH: There was also a lengthy string of dirty jokes and borderline offensive chirping. Which gave me to know we were all fine. I’ve been out to the team for as long as I’ve been playing, so the only real shock for them was learning John is gay.
No. You won’t mind.
“What in the world?” she exclaimed, looking exaggeratedly suspicious. “What are you doing here? Sherlock is meant to get me today.”
The case appeared to bear all the markings of a domestic murder but one. The victim was a notorious recluse with no spouse or dating partner, no siblings, and no living parents. The tiny flat was a rat’s maze of clutter piled on the floor and every horizontal surface to heights around John’s beltline--some as high as his shoulder--and there was a low, rank smell of old food, wet paper, and body odour. A badly staged fake suicide. No suspects, no motive, a computer screen displaying YOU DIED Try Again? Yes / No.
“Might do.” Dismissive. Teasing.
A significant degree of alarm warred with skeptical confusion on the faces of the girl gang staring them down.
As the skaters reset at the center dot, John’s former linemate Corey Hatch checked in. “Lonely back here, Holmesy?”
John opened his mouth to protest. Closed it again. At last, he said, “Yeah. Probably something like that.”
He stepped forward, and Sherlock looked embarrassed and lowered his head and stepped back.
Sherlock grumbled and rolled his eyes. “Cooking.”
John needed a light bulb for the reading lamp standing behind the armchair in his flat (not “his armchair” because it was too new to him, and too narrow, and the seat was too high, with tired springs). He told himself it was too late go up the road and round the corner to the shop; even walking at his newly-normal pace he’d likely just miss closing time. If the shop closed at the top of the hour, which it might do. Instead of braving the cold after dark, he figured he’d be a stereotypical neighbour and ask to borrow a cup of sugar. Or in this case, a lightbulb.
Nearly there, Sherlock’s breath was thick in his throat, his lungs pleasantly straining as the muscles of his thighs and calves inched toward full exertion. In rhythm with his beating soles, a silent chant arose in his mind, imploring him to keep himself in check. He could sail past, chin up, eyes forward. A few dozen strides and he’d be through to the other side. Awaiting him, a blistering hot shower, and he would take himself to a barbecue place for lunch, bring back bags-full to eat on the hotel bed while he watched a film on his laptop. He’d place a video-call to John at the end of his workday, maybe get a glimpse of him in collar and tie, always appetizing.
Sherlock folded himself back into his chair, adjusting it as he went, dragging it a bit nearer to John’s.
“Get to me, will you?” John demanded.
Sherlock moved to unfasten his shirt buttons, but John stopped him with a sharp, “
“I can cook one at home,” John replied, forcing cheer into his voice.
“Take something,” John suggested, and his tone had turned slightly sour in response to Sherlock’s prickliness.
Rosie wrote
John’s casual concern for Sherlock’s well-being was like an enveloping blanket. “I don’t know; I haven’t tried.”
Back in the room, Sherlock ordered dinner, flirted openly with Jordan—who smiled and even returned some of Sherlock’s not-so-subtle innuendo but who left without so much as the offer of a hand job. The sun settled itself, sinking, into the far right edge of the view, and Sherlock watched the evening sky over the cove as ardently as if it were a movie.
“I watch Megan Ashley and I Am Leah play it in their videos. I Am Leah got scammed in a trade for her tiger cat but she had a flying potion left so she used it on her cheeseburger cat. But it’s not rideable.”
“Sherlock, honestly,” John said. “Not everyone is a slag like us. Don’t be shocking just for the sake of it.”
“Not dead, only divorced. No time for the sad tale, I’m afraid; this bus is rigged to explode and I encourage an immediate evacuation.”
Inside was a hand-written note of thanks from someone he had never heard of, appreciative of his assistance in the case being investigated by Sherlock Holmes. Enclosed please find a cheque--
Nodding and cracking a smile, John reached for Rosie’s hand to guide her back to her feet and told her, “Well, you wear it well. I’d never have guessed. Up you get, or we’ll be late.”
They find a cab without having to wait too long, Sherlock already busy on his phone. John tries not to think of all he’s going to have to do to properly move out of his place, wondering if Sherlock would mind if Mycroft helped. He could always ask later, when Sherlock is too happy to sulk. Locked inside his own head, he doesn’t realise they’ve stopped until Sherlock is leaning forwards to pay the driver.
“They’re for you,” John says.
Sherlock blinks a bit more. John got a tattoo for him. In honour of him. In memory of him.
John. Don’t worry about Eurus or Mycroft or any of it. I have a plan. Call me.
brief
“Goodnight, John.”
“What is it?”
Sherlock is silent, hoping his pout will be audible somehow.
“I was thinking it could be Molly’s gift,” John says. “What do you think?”
John huffs out a light giggle, running his fingers all over Sherlock’s face, as though he can’t quite capture all of him with his eyes alone, the need to involve other senses taking over.
“You’re the one to blame, John,” Sherlock replies, now taking his pants and socks off.
“Right. Everything else, all the stuff that came before, is meaningless. We can’t give it any more importance than it’s already had. It’s what had to happen to make
“Nope,” John asserts. “You’re not going anywhere, Sherlock.”
“John, bathroom’s free,” Sherlock calls from the bedroom.
Does that make any sense?
Sherlock smiled and shifted to rest his feet against John’s side, tucking his hands underneath his cheek.
“You don’t trust me.”
Sherlock remains silent for long seconds, leaving just enough time for John to start panicking again.
Sherlock laughs, body shaking against John’s.
Contrary to what you’re thinking (or deducing), I never joined the army just so that I would have people to take care of. That’s one of the reasons I became a doctor, yes, but the army was about something else entirely. Yes, I loved the army, and yes it was a time in my life when I felt like I belonged, like I was useful. And yes, being invalided home almost destroyed me in a way I’m not sure I still fully understand. But meeting you, Sherlock, and being your friend was nothing like the army.
