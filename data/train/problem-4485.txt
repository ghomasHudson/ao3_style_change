Dean shivers, and feels cold and lonely for half a second, but doesn’t have any time to think about it further because Cas’ mouth is back. Every press of his mouth, every pass of his tongue gets more and more demanding, gets deeper, gets wetter. Dean’s acting on instinct, pushing his hips back onto Cas’ tongue is tiny hitching movements.
He expects Cas to continue down, to undo Dean’s pants or at last fondle Dean a little, but instead Cas trails his hands back up, thumbing at Dean’s nipples. His left one stays there, squeezing at Dean’s pec, but his right hand comes to rest on the handprint, still burned into Dean’s shoulder after all these years.
“I do,” Cas says. “But the Empty…it does not have to let me go. I do not want it to take you to get to me.”
, who in the past largely approached sex clinically, curiously, who, as far as Dean understands, doesn’t even
“You told me you weren’t into guys,” Benny starts, and Dean stiffens immediately, “but it sure seems to me like you’re into that angel of yours.”
Benny seems to drop after that, a reprieve which Dean is grateful for. So long as he doesn’t say anything, Dean can keep ignoring the significant
Dean is trembling by the time Cas drops his hand and moves on to laying a kiss on each of Dean’s ribs, starting at the bottom, working his way up, all the while toying with Dean’s left nipple as his palm rests steadily over Dean’s heart.
just as chapped as they’ve always looked, and he tastes just a bit different from everyone else Dean’s kissed, something brighter. Dean presses closer, chasing it, until his mug bumps into their chests, hot coffee sloshing over the rim.
Dean can only gasp and try not to do anything too embarrassing like cry, his left hand digging into Cas’ shoulder and his right clutching desperately at Cas’ bicep.
“Oh,” Dean says, taken aback. He shrugs. “It’s nothin’ special.” He’s not smart, not like Sammy or Kevin or Charlie, he wonders sometimes what it must be like, to have a mind that can do such things, but his mind seems content to only conjure up forests.
“Yeah, yeah,” Sam says. He stands up, Jack going with him. “We’ll give you two some time, yeah?” he says.
Cas seems unconcerned with Dean’s unraveling sanity. He rides out the buck of his hips, humming in a pleased sort of way as he works his throat around the head of Dean’s throat.
When they’re not actively engaged in sex the connecting is less overwhelming. Like this, Dean is mostly flooded with the sensation of Cas’ love, all-consuming and intense yes, but also Cas’ happiness, warm and light and peaceful.
Dean got Sam inside the house and proceeded to carry the injured (and now slightly irritated) boy up the stairs and into Sam’s room. The younger sibling rolled his eyes as his brother checked him over thoroughly, making sure Sam was okay.
After his rant, Dean looked at Sam with complete and utter despair. Sam inwardly smirked at the satisfaction about being right about what Dean’s issue was and leaned back in his chair, donning a contemplative face so as not to arouse suspicion in his brother.
“I know damned well what you thought, and you were right. That didn’t make the pill easier to swallow.”
Resting his hand on the doorknob, Dean had the distinct impression that if he walked out the door, he wouldn’t walk back in.
Dean lay asleep against the high arm of the couch, a beer nestled into the crook of his arm, the rims of his eyelids swollen, irritated, and red thanks to tears cried unconsciously while he slept...
The longer he left it there, the warmer his palm became. He left it in place long past the point it was possible to deny the nature of his want for the contact.
.” The two remained entwined until Dean’s shaking subsided enough for him to realize Castiel was trembling as well.
His eyes tell nothing of a soul that is spare, a heart that is longing for death. He's still here fighting. Better know there's life in him yet.
The biggest pieces were the nastiest. More than once, Dean had to go looking through a considerable amount of blood for a small shard that stayed behind after a larger chunk was removed from the pad of Cas’ foot. Except for the longer, deeper ones, he let the wounds bleed when he was done and carried on. At one particularly jagged piece of glass and a sharp, pained inhale from Cas, Dean’s hand moved with a mind of its own to rest over Cas’ shin bone—a comforting, calming touch.
more deserving of the happiness inherent to true, profound love. When the kiss didn’t stop, Sam silently released the hammer of his gun, making it safe. He retreated to the galley, returning the firearm to its hiding place. There would be an opportunity to welcome his angelic brother back all in good time.
The statement caused Castiel to look back on his infinite lifetime through a lens that suddenly seemed clearer. He explained himself, his tone falling into seductive menace by the end. “It seems more accurate to think of angels as being trained—programmed—to distance themselves from a dangerously deep reservoir of emotion. We exist, harnessed by yokes of rigorous mental discipline that have never been broken before. I’ll warn you only once, Dean Winchester: mine has now. Ask what you will of me accordingly.”
as his hand slid back into Dean’s hair, his fingertips pressed into his scalp, hips bucking hard into his back, fingertips of the seraph’s other hand venturing underneath the waistband of his briefs...
Feeling safely unobserved, Dean quickly leaned over to a drawer in his bedside table. A small bottle came back to Cas’ side with him. He folded one leg in as close as he could manage, the other straight out to his side. He warmed up a squeeze of lubrication, rubbing his palms together. Working a knot out of his shoulder, he rested his right elbow on his knee, resting the palm of his free hand on the space between Cas’ navel and boner. Cas’ stomach and hard-on jumped at the touch. Dean cocked an eyebrow up, looking north, appreciating the look on the angel’s face.
Based on how deeply it was lodged, Dean figured it a reasonable assumption that Castiel had outright landed on it. With so many large blood vessels nearby, it was going to bleed quite a bit. Reaching for extra absorbent pads, gauze, and the syringe to flush it, he prepared to pull the piece and cover the wound with something immediately. The glass chip, one of the largest so far, hit the stainless-steel collection tray. His outspread fingers anchored his hand on Cas’ hip, his thumb lightly pulling back on the skin to keep it open while the saline worked its way in. Dean let the water and blood run, his thumb lightly weighing down an absorbent pad. Soon, the muscle under Dean’s hand contracted in a few jittery spurts.
Dean swallowed to loosen up his closed throat. “Cas...?” Shaking the angel in his arms gently to wake him, he queried him again.
. But it feels like someone’s pounding out the back of my head with a metal mallet... like it’s a fuckin’ dented steel drum. And no, it’s not the vodka,” Dean said, wincing and bringing his gaze up to meet Castiel’s. A momentary frown contracted the angel’s facial features before returning to the serene expression and keen look that gave the distinct impression he was sensing—seeing—
an illusion. In light of the realization, he began taking in heaving breaths as he spoke, his expression awestruck. “I don’t understand...
In the center of the carnage lay a limp, naked human being, foetally curled up on his side, back toward the brothers. Dean lowered the gun in hand, tucking it into the back of his jean’s waistband, recognizing who lay on the frigid tile floor the moment light from a light fixture sparking overhead revealed an angry red handprint seared onto the man’s back below the shoulder blade. Taking in stilted breaths, he swept aside as much glass as he could with his foot before kneeling and clearing away more with his hands. Rolling Castiel back by the shoulder, Dean lifted his torso up off the floor, wrapping both his shaking arms around him.
“Seems I’m a quick study.” In the back of his mind, Castiel still harbored a touch of doubt this was real. Cas used his grip on Dean’s hair to suggest turning to face him. Once he was, Cas released him only to put his hand over Dean’s eyes. Being sightless ratcheted Dean’s nerves up another notch.
“Sam,” Dean said, worry coating the very word. “What were you doing out there? Are you out of your mind?”
Gabriel sighed and pushed the heel of his hands into his eyes before answering. “I was afraid this would happen.” He then summoned a candy cane into his hand and sucked on it thoughtfully, leaving the brothers in suspense before finally breaking the tension.
, he thought, freezing mid-step. Castiel had forgotten that Uriel was guard that night. He winced and tried to make himself as scarce as possible, but, unfortunately, he had already been spotted.
Gabriel gave him a smile and gently rubbed his thumb over Sam’s wrist before releasing the appendage. “Let’s go fix our brothers.”
Charlie suddenly gripped her head and grunted in pain. Castiel reached for her, but she screamed just as he was about to make contact. “Don’t touch me!”
As Dean viciously laid one on Castiel in the room behind them, Sam and Gabriel were exiting, taking that as their cue to leave.
“Well, that first day of work that Dean had after you guys’ accident, he...wasn’t himself. He was totally out of it and had a weird thing goin’ on-” he waved a finger at his eyes “-with his peepers. Bright orange. And he was chanting too. Didn’t notice I was standing right in front of him for a few good minutes. And when he looked at me...” Bobby shuddered, remembering the depth of the anger in his boy’s eyes. “I felt the worst fear I’ve felt in my entire life.”
“I’m sorry,” Dean said in a tired voice, scrubbing a hand over his face. “I..you know, the uh voice in my head.”
Everyone let out a collective breath after Sam got done with briefing them. Charlie was the first one to speak.
Castiel’s eyes were pure ice as he stared down the other man. “Dean makes his own decisions,” he ground out. “And it was helping him.”
Castiel shook his head stubbornly. “Dean, you look utterly exhausted. You are going upstairs and straight to bed.” He turned his head and looked at Sam. “Sam, we will see you in the morning. Then, all of us will talk.”
Five minutes later, Charlie surged up in bed, eyes filled with tears and face contorted with a mixture of grief and horror.
Ruby ended the call and set her phone down on the counter as her mother stared at her expectantly. “I’m meeting Sam Winchester in an hour,” she said. “He sounded super upset and, I quote, ‘needs to be with someone right now’. How pathetic is that?”
Gabriel smirked and kissed the other man playfully. “How long do you think it’ll take for them to notice?
Dean again. Of course Sam was upset with his brother, with whom he shared a grossly co-dependent relationship with.
She gave him a minute smile, gathered up her belongings, including the map, and left. Sam shook his head and stretched before grabbing his backpack and slinging it over his shoulder. As he made his way to the library exit and descended the library steps, Ruby was on his mind. Where did they stand? Were they together or just friends? He knew Dean didn’t like her, but he kind of liked her, and screw what Dean thought.
Sam wiped a hand over his face to clear it of any tears that had congregated there. “Yeah. It is what it is.”
“Look, Sam, the spell will be fine. We have everything we need, and it will work. My only concern here is that Dean, or, rather, Persephone, will eat something while down there.”
The first thing he heard was a hypnotic, repetitive dripping noise. He came to on his knees with an innate sense of calm and an underlying assurance that everything was right in the world. He felt...great. Fantastic, even. Definitely better than he had been in the past few months. His eyes fluttered open as he breathed in, the calm filling him further, before his eyes widened in shock.
The brunette glared back at the elder man, blue eyes boring into him. “Exactly what it sounds like.”
From the Underworld, Hades got up from where he had formerly collapsed and smirked. His love was almost ready, and it was just a matter of time until he could be with his love again.
Cas sucked in a deep breath and covered his mouth. He usually let Dean handle the opening remarks, as Dean could hold his own, but never had he ever thought that Dean would get shot. What was going to happen? Would the Spirit save him?
Castiel grabbed his head, the darkness around and within him growing every second. He was slipping into a mindset that was not familiar to him. Though he was the angel of tears and solitude, he felt every negative or base feeling grow. Everything was becoming so much smaller, yet so much larger. He couldn’t handle it as this darkness overpowered every bit of his being, dominating what used to be the angel Castiel and turning him into something...more.
Dean snapped out of it, finding his hands gripping his head as he laid in a fetal position, the Spirit calmly watching him from where he still sat across the room. He quickly got to his feet and lunged at the deity. “You son of a bitch!”
His vision cleared and he found himself in a room filled with dead bodies. Blood spatter covered the walls and the floor was littered with bodies, burned, bloodied, and broken. Dean was stunned by deja vu and his eyes watered, his skin feeling hot and prickly, like there were needles trying to get out. That squishing sound kept bugging him, getting louder and louder, the repetitive sound making his eardrums rattle. What is that?
The younger man rolled his eyes and grabbed a Honey Bun off the counter. The other one sighed, set aside the records he was looking at, and leaned back into the couch.
Dean turned to Castiel and looked him dead in the eye. “Ask the question that you’ve been dying to ask. Ask me why I become a blazed up skeleton freak. Tell me what you’re going to do about it, how you’re going to ruin me.”
The long haired man tilted his head, curiosity and surprise at the once-in-a-lifetime possibility of Dean opening up to him making his eyes widen before he pulled himself back together again. “Try me.”
The younger Winchester shook his head rapidly. “No, no, you aren’t my brother. And you do NOT get to call me that.”
“Dean?!” Sam yelled, trying to wake up his brother. Gabe shook his head and picked up Dean, laying him on the bed. “Sam, I think I know what’s going on.”
“Oh shit,” Charlie said, color draining from her face. “After I picked him up we went back to my house and he was telling me about the accident...and I was telling him that I thought that the Demons - the gang - were responsible for it. He might be going after them.”
Sam rushed to the window to see Castiel outside, standing surrounded by what looked like demon smoke, his normally tan coat a deep black. He was standing next to the cause of the tremors, a deep crack in the ground that most likely was a direct passage to the Underworld. The angel - could the guy still be called an angel? Didn’t look like one anymore - lifted his head and stared at the motel with those swirling black and purple orbs that were once pure blue eyes. The younger Winchester winced once their gazes met, his entire body seizing up with the feeling that he only felt when he was facing impending death. His heart dropped out of his chest, and he went pale, stuck in a trance, staring into the eyes of the Lord of the Underworld himself. Suddenly, he was jarred from his reverie by a hand on his elbow.
“You wouldn’t know Hell if it came up to you wearing a nametag! I am a creature of Hell, and I WON’T be disrespected this-”
Sam didn’t acknowledge the last part, crossed his arms and leaned on his crutch against the door frame. "That's funny, because I called Bobby when you didn't call me by 9:00 to say you'd be home later. He said you cut right out after your shift ended."
After twenty minutes of awkward-yet-finessed conversations and frequent apologetic looks shot towards both Anna and the patrons, Castiel plopped down on the stool in front of Gabriel at the counter.
So what, I couldn't help but sneak in a little Destiel in there. I'm a little obvious, but I don't care. Next chapter should be out soon 💕
) to calm his nerves, only to feel a mix of flakes and slick fluid rub off on his face in some twisted form of war paint. Like he had been burned, he pulled his hand away quickly, and, in the dim lighting, saw they were both covered in a red liquid that looked black in the moonlight shining through the windows. In fact, it looked like he had practically bathed in the stuff; upon further examination, he was completely covered in it. What could it be?
With that information, Castiel slumped down at Bobby’s kitchen table, exhausted from the tumultuous emotions wrestling inside him. Sam attempted to inconspicuously sneak peeks at Castiel over his turkey sandwich, but eventually figuring subtlety useless, voiced his concern. “How are you, Cas?”
If Dean could see himself, he would probably be blushing. “I don’t know...it’s a nickname, I guess. I don’t have to call you that if you don’t want me to.”
Castiel, for some reason much more aware of the feeling of the wooden grain on his neck as well as the cold that was seeping into his back, on top of the chill in the base of his spine. He swallowed. “No, Dean, of course not.”
Sam couldn’t think of anything to say; he knew deep down why they didn’t want them seeing them. “Oh. And, uh, do you know…”
Castiel closed his eyes for a second before turning back to Sam, leaning against the door for a second. Sam stared at him, then his suddenly unappetizing sandwich. He had his answer.
The younger Winchester nodded and continued. “Anyways, so Dean prays for Cas, and he shows up, and then all the demons kind of just...stopped attacking us? I don’t know, it was weird. But anyways, so this one demon starts trash talking Cas, and then, next thing you know, he’s ordering the demons back to hell...and they listened. Which was really weird. But the strangest part is, Cas turned toward us and his eyes….”
Castiel and Dean looked at each other, Dean raising his eyebrows as Cas tilted his head. The elder Winchester turned his attention to the other people in the room.
“And then today we were on a hunt and some demons got the upper hand. Then Cas shows up out of nowhere-”
Ruby softly smiled at him. “Do you want to talk about it or do you want me to take your mind off it?”
“Oh, Dean,” it said, getting closer, and cupped Dean’s face with a burning hot palm that made Dean flinch in pain. “I have so many plans for you.”
. That asshole, thorn-in-her-side, brother of Sam’s was always interfering with her plans. She’d never met the man, but, with Sam, it seemed like his brother always came first. Ruby didn’t know what the deal was with this guy. She hadn’t talked to her sister Meg in years.
He shook his head and glared at the creature. “There’s a lot you don’t know about me.” The snarl-grin grew wider before the creature’s eyes glowed orange and it peered at Castiel, staring deep into...what felt like his soul.
Also, I don't like turkey. I don't know why I fixated on the sandwich. However, come to think of it, a sandwich sounds really good right now.
Persephone stepped out into the parking lot, and, spying his love, almost ran to see him, a joyous smile on his face. His Hades looked so beautiful, power and magnetic darkness radiating off of him. Persephone, himself, was feeling wonderful. His human life was just a memory now; he knew, in his soul, that he was now going to be where he was meant to be. He could feel every plant on Earth in his veins, all of them holding a place in his heart. He felt like something
Dean sat in stunned silence. After the revelation of being trapped in his head and the initial shock, the Spirit had had the courtesy to explain the situation to him.
The man threw his head back and laughed before grinning a little too sharply for Castiel’s taste. “All’s good, baby. Hey, what do you say that we get outta here? Shoot some pool, kill some bad guys. Maybe have a little
Castiel silently crossed the room and examined whatever was on Charlie’s computer before averting his eyes and placing a hand of comfort on the redhead’s shoulder. Sam’s hazel eyes met Castiel’s blue. “They’re the crime scene photos, Sam.”
He began talking about the accident, which stemmed into telling Cas about his past. When he mentioned Sam, he didn’t need the voice in his head to tell him that his companion was hiding something. Dean paused. “What is it?”
The younger rolled his eyes at Dean’s attempt to remain dignified before fixating his attention back on his brother.
“Cas, you didn’t have to carry me up to my room. And you sure as hell don’t have to spend the night,” Dean said as the other man made sure that he was tucked comfortably into his bed. Cas fixed him with his blue gaze from where he sat on the edge of the bed.
But her plan of worming her way into Sam Winchester’s trust was moving along well, and Ruby was perfectly content with that.
“Could you take my mind off it? I hate to ask this of you, but I’m just not up to talking right now.”
As Castiel was wolfing down his second slice of pizza and Sam was in the bathroom deciding to do something about the greaseball he called a head, a brief knock was heard at the front door before it swung open.
The young Winchester, irritated, shook his head to clear it of all the negative thoughts that were gathering there. He couldn’t do anything about this whole Dean situation right now, so he was just going to go to bed. Sam picked up the crutches and headed to the couch; he wanted to stew in silence, and he was pretty sure he didn’t want to hear whatever was going on between Dean and Castiel.
Castiel thought back to what had caught his eye...or rather, who, as Gabriel had said earlier. He had been washing one of the tables by the window when he had noticed a man hunched over on the sidewalk. He had had his head in his hands and was shaking. He had looked troubled, and Castiel had wanted to help him. However, he had a hunch that the man needed alone time, not someone to hover over him and ask if he was okay.
“I don’t know,” the Spirit said. “This has never happened before. All my previous vessels were never stubborn enough to go against their own well-being just because of some misguided duty to a younger brother as well as a crippling fear of change.”
Castiel rolled his eyes and closed the window. He didn't need the bullshit on the other side of that door.
That one word broke Dean’s entire world, the amount of confusion and sadness imbuing it making him slump over and not meet the angel’s eyes. “Cas, I just..”
The Winchester peered over at the couch upon which Bobby was passed out before looking up at Castiel in thinly veiled worry. “And I’m to keep an eye on Dean, I take it?”
Ten minutes later, Bobby let himself into the Winchester house to find Dean’s best friend, Sam, and Castiel freaking Novak draped over the odds-and-ends furniture that occupied the Winchester’s living room. The injured Angel was staring at Charlie with an almost fearful expression as she played Candy Crush on her phone, legs thrown over a
Sam pushed Charlie’s legs off of his lap and stood up, offering Bobby his spot. “I’ll explain everything, Bobby. You guys deserve to know what’s going on and what we have to do.”
After work that day, Castiel made his way back to the trailer park a few blocks away from the cafe. He took a shortcut through the woods, navigating through the dark purely by memory and instinct. All of a sudden he heard a voice say his name.
The young man sat straight up at the tone of Michael's voice. It was positively livid, and, while Michael did occasionally get annoyed and even angry with Castiel, he had never heard the Commander speak like this.
“Get the fuck away from me, asshole. Cas and Sam are gonna save me and then you’re gonna be just a fucking smear on the sidewalk. Gone. Kaput.” Dean’s confident expression disappeared when the thing started freaking
When had he been arrested? Last time Dean woke up in a prison cell he had been 16 and had been caught stealing a loaf of bread so Sammy could eat. Were they going hungry again?
Castiel burst out of the kitchen, irritated expression. “Gabriel, for Christ’s sake, if you continue to pull that with every single person who walks in, I will kill-” The dark haired man froze, spotting Dean, and nervously wiped wet hands on his apron.
Dean sighed and leaned against the counter. “Dude, I got no idea. One second, I was feeling like my insides were being melted, and then I’m here, talking to you.”
The figure moved into the light, to reveal Dean’s own face looking back at him. The real Dean closed his eyes in despair as the creature spoke. “Why what, Dean?”
Castiel looked back and forth between the two. He took note of Dean physically trying to calm himself and felt a pang of sympathy for his friend. The man was already worried about how the spirit possessing him was affecting him, and he didn’t need this extra stress. Castiel watched the younger Winchester put his brother down, and how every word made Dean’s shoulders slump more and more. Worry quickly turned into protective rage, and the Angel decided to make an executive decision. He stood up abruptly, his chair squeaking, offensive to the ears, making both Winchesters suddenly pay attention to the dark-haired man.
Gabe stepped forward, a mockingly serious face plastered upon his features. “Dean, we’re worried about you.”
Sam shot the archangel a look. “Well, he showed up the other day acting really, really weird; kinda like a darker version of himself.”
“Yup. You know the tale of Hades and Persephone, Sammy. Boy meets girl, girl meets boy, boy drags girl to the Underworld, girl gets trapped there for half a year because she couldn’t help her pomegranate cravings, yada yada. So as long as Deansephone doesn’t get a case of the munchies, we should be in the clear.”
Dean #1 then quickly kissed Dean #3, or, well, tried to. The Dean 3.0 held onto his waist in an iron grip and forced his tongue into the original Dean’s mouth, and sucked something out of what felt like Dean’s very core. Dean went pliant in the Doppelganger’s hold and, once the Doppelganger stopped violating Dean’s mouth, he looked up into fiery orange eyes. Instinctively he tried to fight, but then he had no will to. In fact he had no will at all.
Making his way to the panic room door, Sam began to feel as if something were wrong. It was too quiet; in the past hour or two, every time someone came down to check on Dean they were greeted with the Creature being an obnoxious asshole. The complete silence was unsettling. He began to advance with caution. “...Dean? You good in there?”
Charlie tapped away on her computer for a minute. “Okay, I got something. So there’s apparently been a ton of mass-murders that the police have been keeping out of the news, happening almost every day.”
The creature stared into the Angel’s eyes searchingly while Castiel stared defiantly back. The pressure was soon taken off of Castiel’s neck, and, as soon as his feet were back on the ground, Castiel let out an inaudible sigh of relief. The creature in Dean turned away from the brunette. After a beat, Castiel squared his shoulders and said, with a (hopefully) confident tone, “Because you’re not you.”
The Angel shook his head. “I didn’t enjoy our conversation downstairs, unfortunately. Hopefully Sam is a bit more civil and merciful in the morning.”
The elder Winchester helped his brother up, supporting his weight, and began (gently) dragging his brother to their house. Dean didn’t bother acknowledging his newfound strength; he was too busy worrying about Sam.
Although, this time, she had to hand it to Dean. He managed to upset his brother so much that little Sammy played right into her hands.
Dean scoffed. “Yeah, and I never will, you sick motherfucker.” He wheezed the last word as he forced himself onto his back.
“Dean, do not be scared. You know me. I’m the voice that has been in the back of your head all these months.”
The second time Castiel woke up was also due to a phone ringing, just not his. Sunlight blinded him as he opened his eyes and then promptly squeezed them shut. From a room away, he could hear Sam answer the landline.
Castiel Novak jumped from his place at the counter by the window of his Aunt Anna’s cafe, A Taste of Heaven. He was a waiter there, but, every once in a while, he would get distracted by the passersby outside the cafe’s two large windows in the front. And that was why he had zoned out now.
The Dean x Spirit!Dean kiss was a little modeled after a demon deal. But also, I'm tired, and had no intention of writing the mind space scenes at all...
All of a sudden someone came into the store. Dean looked up, interrupted from examining the logs, from where he sat at the front desk. There was a tall man staring at him intensely, blue eyes meeting green. Their eye contact continued until Dean finally broke it to look to see if Bobby was in the area. This man looked familiar, but Dean couldn’t place him for some reason.
“Um…,” Dean stuttered, looking down. “The, uh, ‘spirit’ apparently needs to feed every once in a while.”
The Spirit gasped and was about to say something when the newest clone waved a hand and seemingly glued the Spirit’s mouth shut.
Even though it was just a voice in his head Dean swore that he could’ve felt the voice roll it’s eyes.
The brunette barely had any time to react before he was being roughly flipped so that his back was to the door and there was a forearm to his neck, holding him still against the wood. “You ditching me, Cas?”
Dean calculated for a bit, factoring in what time he got off and what he would do with Sammy. He figured nine would give him enough time to sort things out.
I'm actually attempting to move along with the demon storyline. Yayyy!!! (Who are Ruby and Lilith trying to break out? Gee, so hard to think of someone...)
Castiel’s eyes widened and he put his hand forward, gently grabbing Dean’s chin and slowly turning the hunter back toward him. To Dean’s surprise, Cas kissed him and then put his forehead against Dean’s own.
A hurt expression that hit way too close to Sam’s heart crossed Dean’s, no, Persephone’s, face before the being stood. “
Charlie Bradbury, in all accounts, was a ray of sunshine. However, in high school, when she could’ve been hanging out with the popular clique, she chose to stick with one person: Dean Winchester.
“If your own family doesn’t love you, how can you expect anyone, let alone Castiel, to do so?” Dean’s eyes shot to the monster’s, wide and disbelieving. “Oh don’t even bother to protest, buddy. I’m in here,” it tapped its temple. “Remember? I know everything you know, I’ve felt everything you’ve felt. All you are to him is something new to explore, just a distraction, a
Bobby has a bat, Sam is a teenage damsel and has the hair for it, Castiel's backstory is once more hinted at but STILL not elaborated on, Dean is oblivious to everything because he's still possessed, AND I can't decide what to refer to Dean as.
The elder Demon’s eyes scrunched up as a malicious smile found its home on her face. “Absolutely, baby.”
Sam’s question was rewarded with a head tilt, genuine confusion wrinkling Castiel’s forehead as his eyebrows pulled together. “Yes, Sam. ‘We’. Because we are going to save your brother, or die trying.”
Dean hesitantly opened his eyes - were they even his eyes anymore? Or were they the Spirit’s? - and was completely disoriented. He took in his surroundings. It was dark, but, as his eyes adjusted to the dim lighting, he found himself to be in a jail cell. Concrete walls surrounded him, save for the bars that were opposite him. Upon further examination, aka when Dean finally got a good grip on his faculties, he was sitting in a corner of the cell, the cool cement seeping into his clothes as he grounded himself.
Also, I realized while writing this that when I started writing this story I was younger than Sammy boy. Wowza.
The armchair Bobby had been in hit the wall with the force at which the older man shot out of his chair. Castiel found himself with a face full of pissed off Bobby.
Sam’s head jerked to the side to see Gabriel staring up at him with a worried but determined expression. “Sam, you need to step away from the window. Hades is coming for his Persephone, and you do
Castiel glanced behind him at the door, but then decided against escape. The creature would just hunt him down and hurt him anyways. He took in a deep breath. “Do what you will. Just know that I won’t be going down without a fight.”
Sam, previously holding things down, was immediately distracted by the sight that greeted him once he turned. Dean’s eyes were open, but, instead of revealing his brother’s normal forest colored eyes, Dean’s irises were bright green, an unnatural color that could only have been found in the deepest of rain forests.
The dark haired man then leaned forward and said to Dean in a low voice (which Dean thought couldn’t be physically possible to sound that deep and good), “We need to meet.”
The creature paused its ministrations, a flicker of vicious curiosity in its eyes that didn’t match the forlorn expression upon its features. “What’s the problem, Cas? You can’t tell me you don’t want me? Cuz I can see inside of you. Your desire for me. The unspeakable things you want to do with me.” He smirked. “
Sam grinned at her, the first real smile since she saw him. “Embarrassing and nerdy are my middle names. Let me at it.”
Dean jumped and whipped around to find the source of the voice, which turned out to be a man sitting in the shadows, face obscured. “Who are you?!” he demanded.
? Really, Dean, that‘s rich. The second you and I walked out that door they decided to forget your sorry ass. Sam doesn’t care whether you’re alive or dead; honestly, you just weigh him down. A burden, nothing more.”
“What?” Sam asked, still distracted by the fact that his brother just turned into a supernatural creature. “What’s wrong?”
Castiel smiled minutely and nodded before turning and walking out. It was at that time that Bobby chose to walk into the front of the store. He stopped in shock.
Sam stood up, too hurt to remember to keep weight off his slowly healing leg. “Is that what you really think?” he said brokenly, disbelief written upon his features, “You think that I don’t care what happens to my brother? You think that if I couldn’t take everything back that I said the other day, I would?” Tears sprung to the teenager’s eyes. “It’s my fault that he’s out there alone, and scared, and trapped by this...monster that is going around and wreaking havoc. And I would save him, but what can I do? I’m a goddamn fifteen year old! I might as well be a baby, for all the help I can do!”
The teenager gulped and nodded before noticing that Cas was swaying more and could barely keep his eyes open. His arm shot out for stability. “Cas, I think you need to lie down.”
So, when Ruby went to see Sam Winchester that night, she did not have the innocent intentions she claimed to have. And as she left, the girl smiled, pleased that Sam Winchester was playing so easily into her hand.
The whole “murdering bad guys for the greater good” thing with Cas was going pretty well. Dean was feeling better than he had in a long time, since it seemed that the Spirit was much nicer (both to his body and his mind) when he was well fed. Speaking of feeding…
Climbing his porch steps, Dean reached for his front door only to have it open the second he touched the knob. He would've laughed at the timing if it weren't for Sam's stony expression.
The two sat in silence for a little bit, the tension in the air still decently thick. Dean eventually squirmed and decided to cut it.
Sam fumbled his way out of the bathroom to find Charlie standing in the living room with her hands on her hips. Her glasses were askew, failing to hide the enormous bags under her normally lively eyes, and red hair sticking up all over the place. She looked awful. Sam hadn’t seen her like this since he accidentally walked into Dean’s room years ago to find Charlie crying in Dean’s arms as he rubbed her back.
The teenager, still in the room, cleared his throat. “So, uh, Charlie, Bobby will be here soon, so, uh, do what you want. I’ll explain everything when he gets here.”
Sam awoke to the sound of banging on the door. He grabbed his crutches and made his way to it, before opening it to find Castiel, barely conscious, holding himself up against the door-frame, covered in blood.
This story is the "Starships" to my Nicki Minaj, except this isn't as popular (not that I want it to be lol).
Sorry I took so long posting! School has started, so I haven't been able to write for a while, well, that is, stuff I want to write. But I'm gonna try to finish this.
An extremely sarcastic brow arched. “What did you think he was?” The younger Winchester sat back for a second, thinking. The night before everything went wrong, the night Sam had seen Dean kill all those people, Sam had just assumed that Dean was...well, there was no other word for it than “changed”. When his brother had told him that he was a fiery monster dude, Sam really couldn’t find it in himself to get past that. He swallowed and went back to tending Castiel’s wounds. “...I don’t know.” he said quietly.
“Are you sure? Because Anna called me two mornings ago and told me you hadn’t been in for work. In fact, last time she saw you, you had left in the middle of your shift.”
“Except, tonight, if I had worried about myself and hadn’t rushed home after realizing how late it was, you probably would still be out there right now, laying on that sidewalk, hurting and alone. So be glad I worried about you this time.” Sam begrudgingly accepted Dean’s answer, and the corners of Dean’s mouth quirked up a little bit. Point one for Team Dean.
Hades grinned. “That is true, love, you are quite a force to be reckoned with. Although I cannot tell if I preferred the red hair more or this blond.” Persephone laughed softly, fully relaxed into his lover’s embrace
Persephone raised his hands to Hades’ cheeks, the other god closing his eyes and leaning into the touch. “
“Nothing like another group of Demons that have absolutely no idea why their gang tried to kill me and Sammy.”
Castiel remained silent, like he had been for pretty much the entire conversation and, after peering at the Angel for a time, Bobby turned to look at the other two in the room and sighed. “Well, can’t say it doesn’t make sense.”
, Castiel thought as the door banged into the outside wall of the trailer, his mood officially soured.
He hobbled over to the kitchen and pulled one of the many bottles of whiskey out of the pantry before going to the bathroom and grabbing some bandages. Returning to Castiel, he lowered himself and his goods down and steadied himself. “Shirt?”
“Whoa whoa whoa, Cas,” the teen said, reaching out toward the man in case he needed to be steadied. “You need to lie back down.” At that, he was met with a pair of obstinate blue eyes.
Cas walked into the grand Library on one crutch, holding his bandaged foot up off the floor. He took in a deep breath. The smells of old paper, old leather, old wood, old knowledge, and the echoes of hearts dedicated to ensuring mankind would never devolve into ignorance of the arcane and divine imparted to him what the Men of Letters had once been. Smartly dressed once again, minus the trench coat and suit jacket, he wore his collar unbuttoned and tie relaxed. The angel half-smiled when Sam looked up to see him. It struck Sam how much gaunter—greyer, even—the seraph looked compared to what he remembered. Castiel didn’t fill out his clothing the way he used to. Whatever the angel had been through over the past months, it must’ve been something horrific enough to affect his vessel like this.
It into setting me free...” Castiel’s laughter mingled with sobs as a smile engaged in a tug-of-war with sadness at both corners of his lips, each winning in turns.
Pained, Cas sighed and let his eyelids fall closed as he placed a kiss on Dean’s cheek, fitting the curvatures of their faces together and resting that way. “I am
“Sure. Thanks.” Sam watched, smirking, as his brother stepped out, tracking down Cas in the galley. If there was only ever one place on Earth where these two didn’t have to walk on eggshells—where they could just
Castiel decided reining things in was for the best. He helped Dean right himself, having to take a firm hold of his shoulder again when it became apparent Dean wasn’t going to stop falling over forward. It seemed the suggestion that he relax hadn’t worn off quite yet. Cas, amused, placing a reverent butterfly kiss on Dean’s shoulder, waited patiently until he stayed upright of his own volition.
“Fine, I’ll be there as soon as I can.”  He punched the end call button on the phone and leaned forward.  “Change of plans, Alfie.  I need you to take us straight home and then I need you to take me to the office.”
Dean saw Cas’ eyes lighten and his scent turn into a happier version of his normal scent.  “I remember,” he whispered.  Dean’s mouth was suddenly dry with the way Cas was looking at him.  He was aware that he was chest to chest with him and he was between Cas’ legs.  Somehow both of Cas’ hands had landed on his hips and the connection between them arched together.  Dean found himself ready to lean in and press their lips together.
She nodded, squeezing his hand back.  “I’m fine, Cas, really.”  She looked up at him and smiled again.  “I just wonder if things would have turned out differently if we had stayed with our pack, or found a new one quickly.”  She sighed and brushed off the rest of her sadness.  “But,” she continued brightly, “I wouldn’t be here and we never would have become friends.”
“Wish everything worked out that well,” John agreed.  They turned to head inside and Dean fell in step with them.  Cas stayed with Mary as the alphas made their way into the castle.
Dean was reminded that he enjoyed cooking a lot.  As he pulled out the dish the smell of tomatoes and herbs and delicious cheese filled the air.  He inhaled heavily and smiled.  He had stopped cooking a while ago because it was hard to cook just for himself.  As it was, the big dish in front of him was more than twice what he could eat tonight.
Dean nodded.  He thought about yesterday and how things had gone downhill for a bit.  He knew that these ribs and the other injuries would take some time, he just had to be patient.  “I know, Cas.  I love you for taking care of me.  I’ll go to school as planned and I’ll meet you…where exactly?”
Dean promised her he would and then bid her good-bye after he walked her to the door.  Benny wasn’t guarding the hallway this morning but another soldier was there.  Dean greeted him before he closed the door.  He ate quickly as he wrote a note to Crowley, another Pack Alpha to the north.  There were lands separating them but they had always been on friendly terms.  A large part of the Morningstar lands connected to Crowley’s pack, which meant that now their borders connected.  Crowley was one to change alliances quickly, but he honored an agreement.  If Dean could secure his alliance he would feel better.
“Like what?” he asked.  He saw Cas’ jaw firm and he was afraid that the alpha wouldn’t answer him, but he sighed after a moment.  He glanced at Jimmy and he wore a similar expression.
Dean nodded silently, still scenting.  Cas held him for a few more minutes and Dean continued to feel better.  He sighed as he clung to Cas’ shirt.  He hated feeling completely dependent on someone else and it scared him that his body began to spiral after not being with Cas for the day.
“I- I know that you’re ok now, but I also know there were years that you weren’t.  When you told me that you had not eaten well to be able to care for Emma, I was heartbroken for you, but then, when I realized that
“Too long, Ellen,” he replied as he looked down to Cas’ upturned face.  He had him tucked next to him with an arm wrapped around his waist.
Dean nodded in understanding.  “My heat will come in about a month, like I said.  Usually they last three or four days and a day of recovery.  I’ll have some warning because my heats don’t usually just slam into me, they start gradually and I’ll start seeing signs about a week before but it might come on faster since I’ve been in close proximity to you.  I think, um,” Dean swallowed and looked back down to the button where his fingers lay against Cas’ chest.  “I think I’d like some help,” he said quietly.  “I’m not sure what that would look like though.”
Charlie had left them alone for the day, but Dean had caught glimpses of the photographers as they went around the city.  Dean had been nervous and overwhelmed all day, but Cas had been there to hold his hand and help him along.
Before he could say anything, Cas’ scent enveloped him.  Dean turned to see Cas right behind him.  He smiled and launched himself into his arms.  Dean didn’t care that they were surrounded by his family and all the students and probably Cas’ family too.  Cas’ strong arms came around his waist and lifted him off of the group with a laugh.  They shared a brief kiss before there was throat clearing behind them.  Cas broke the kiss and smiled at Dean.
“I want to make new memories with you Dean.  We cannot change the past and there is no guarantee that we would be here now if we did.  I want to look to the future and plan ahead.  I can’t wait.”
Dean chewed on his nail as he felt his throat close up and his stomach turn.  He reminded himself to keep breathing and stay calm.  He didn’t know what Cas was going to say, but he knew Cas was struggling with the approaching conversation.  Fear clutched his heart and he knew it was leaking into his scent.  He had wanted Cas to talk to him about what was going on, but now that it was here and his contract was on the table he wanted to be anywhere else.
Once the door was shut behind them Cas led Dean over to the couch in the corner.  He helped him to sit down and he settled next to his mate.  He sipped his coffee while Dean took in the room.  Cas’ office wasn’t opulent, but it was comfortable.  He had a large wall of windows that overlooked the skyline and his furniture was proportionate to the space.  He had a wet bar and a full bathroom attached to the office as well as the sitting area.
Cas smiled, frown lifting as he looked at his mate.  “I was going to offer it to you to wipe your face,” Cas told him.
He peaked around the corner of the kitchen to see Emma happily playing with her Barbies on the couch while Sofia the First played in the background.  He went back to the kitchen and flipped the pancakes in the pan.  He put more bacon on and started to cut up some fruit.  Dean tried to set a good example for her and eat fresh fruit and veggies at every meal.  It had taken some getting used to while he was pregnant, but he found he liked lots of things he didn’t realize he did until he tried them.
Dean swallowed around the lump in his throat, trying to get himself under control before his scent gave him away.  He was happy for his friends and he didn’t want them to think he wasn’t.  He also didn’t want to make everything about him all the time.  But sometimes he couldn’t help it.
“I would if I wasn’t afraid of giving away the fact that Dean is here.  John Winchester cares for no one, we all know that.  He has almost bankrupted his pack and when he had the opportunity to help lead once the debts were paid, he didn’t.  He sent his son away because he was raped and therefore no use to him anymore.  What kind of father does that?  His omega son had been raped, by three alphas, and the next day, while Dean was only beginning to heal, he banished him from his home and did it in such a way that he couldn’t tell anyone!  What would keep him from doing so again?  What would keep him from demanding Dean get rid of the pup? He would compel him, I’m sure, and if that happened I would certainly challenge him and I would kill him.  If he harms Dean or my pup I will kill him.  I won’t let him take away anything else from me
Dean knew that if he asked Cas to get rid of Charlie he would, but Dean needed to start sorting some of this out.  He really needed to figure out who was going to be able to be in his life and who was not.  Starting with Charlie might actually be a good thing.  He could feel out how it would go before he had to do so with his family.
In truth, Dean had been Dean Novak for a while now.  He had been able to change his name incredibly quickly and with ease, so it had been done months ago.
He opened the door and stepped out as he scanned the groups of people for Ellen.  He saw Charlie and Jo laughing together with Andrea, who seemed to be slightly uncomfortable but Ellen was sitting with Bobby away from them.
In all, they got more than Dean thought he would need.  Cas told him that he would need everything in the basket and more probably when winter came around.  Dean was pleased with the fun t-shirts he got that Jimmy had found.  He had several new pairs of jeans, in addition to pajamas and sweat pants.  He had a sweatshirt for chilly mornings and new socks and underwear.  They got him muck boots, house shoes and better work boots.  Jimmy insisted he have a cowboy hat to wear, just like everyone else.
“When you stopped calling I just decided to let you set the pace.  All of a sudden it had been several weeks and I had had no contact with you.  I didn’t know what to do.  I didn’t think you wanted me.  I was pining too.”  Cas paused and took a deep breath.  Dean knew he wasn’t done speaking and even if he was Dean couldn’t respond yet.  “It was bad for me too, Dean.”  He looked back up into his eyes.  Dean could detect embarrassment and longing in his scent.  “Maybe one day I’ll tell you all the details, but know that I didn’t call because I, too, was very sick.”
“You don’t get a say, Dean.  This is my right and my life.  I didn’t get a say in your heat and you don’t get a say in this.  We both have to do what is needed and what we think is right.”
He took a moment to cuddle with his omega and when he felt Dean relax in sleep he looked back to the doctor.
“You’re damn right it was hurtful.  Jesus, Charlie.  Do you even remember half the things you did and said over the last year that were so hard for me to stomach?”
Dean shrugged as Cas pulled a can of soda from his back pocket and handed it to Dean.  Cas settled next to Dean and smiled when he pressed his lips to Cas’.
“What do you mean it was a five-hundred-dollar mistake?” Bobby nearly yelled.  To say he was unimpressed was an understatement.
Cas came quickly through the door by himself and Dean’s eyebrows rose.  “Where’s the fire, Cas?” he asked.
“What if…what if he takes Emma away?  The reason I kept her away from the Novaks in the first place was because they have the means in every way to fight for her and provide for her in a way that I don’t and won’t ever be able to.  I don’t even have a college education!  But the idea of keeping her a secret now doesn’t sit well with me.  And if he’s here, he’s going to find out that I have a pup and then what?  He’s a smart guy, he’s going to know the timeline and he’s going to wonder.  And her scent is changing, it won’t be long before everyone knows who her alpha is by scent, even if they don’t know the alpha personally.  Sammy, I just-“
Cas’ smile became more confident and he stepped into Dean’s space.  “Oh really?” he whispered.  He reached up and cupped Dean’s cheek gently, meeting his eyes.  Dean could see the blue of his irises, shocking in color so close.
He slowed and pulled on to the gravel driveway at the edge of the Novak lands.  This road led to a few very spread out cabins that the Novaks had for the rare visitors they entertained.  They weren’t used often and they weren’t kept up, which is why he asked his brothers to help.
He instantly regretted the action because his head felt like his brain was going to explode, but it was nothing compared to the mistake he just found.  He had fucked up on one of the invoices and it would be the rest of the day to undo the damage.  He spent the next two hours trying to correct the mistake with the customer and the parts company before it was fixed.  In the end it probably meant they lost a customer and were definitely getting a shitty online review, but it could have been worse.  He made his way over to Bobby to confess the mistake and tell him what he had done to fix it.
He took a steady, deep breath in until his lungs strained, the air inhaled telling him more than Dean could possibly bring himself to speak to. Fear isn’t the only emotion with a scent. Tears soaked into pillows, anguish, sweat, release, joy and relief, shame and confusion, longing, guilt, and regret. Of course, there was also the olfactory cocktail of cologne, soaps, pheromones, and everything else that differentiated one human body from another. Something he never thought to note before. He did so now. The sound of Dean’s hurried footfalls in the hallway brought Cas’ attention back to the moment, away from the otherworldly collage in his mind’s eye made up of the reasons behind what his sense of smell showed him.
Having found what he was trawling for, Dean opened the skin up around the puncture wound ever so slightly. Enough to get fine-point tweezers around the foreign debris. Depositing the glass on gauze along with a speck of blood, he dipped the tweezers into a dixie cup of alcohol before moving on to the next apparent extraction site—a piece that wound up lodged in Cas’ skin at the hip joint.
Gauze pads, a scalpel, needle-nose tweezers, penlight, peroxide, alcohol, saline flush syringe, ointment...
Dean took hold of Cas in both hands, using the lubrication on them to ensure he was covered from tip to base. Leaving his hand resting around Cas’ root, his thumb and forefinger keeping his mast from moving too freely, he gave it a few slow, firm, rotating strokes, gauging where the strongest twitches in the rest of his body happened. A few quick short strokes around the seeping head... he explored the space underneath Cas’ corona with thumb and fingertips. Cas twisted from head to foot, legs moving, chest contracting, pushing his hip closer to Dean. He brought his far hand to his forehead, running it back into his hair.

All that was needed of him was the courage to let it be. Warmth flooded through him on the heels of the thought. The moment it did, Cas wrapped his free arm around him. Dean smiled, realizing he hadn’t been standing at that crossroads in his mind alone.
Dean blinked hard a few times and took in a deep breath, leaning back in his chair, bringing the soiled gauze with him, and tossing it into the surgical tray. He was shivering and he wasn’t cold. Running his hands over his closed eyes, he reached for the vodka bottle, pouring a shot for Cas and taking another swig himself. Cas set the glass down on the bedside table when Dean stood, taking a few paces around the room to stretch the tension out of his upper back, shoulders, and neck.
In one awful moment, as if the Emptiness had discerned what he was seeing, the face in his mind’s eye became clearer, gained proper color and form. Before long, the presence stepped through the parting darkness, alight with a glory potent enough to obscure even an angel’s sight.
Castiel’s voice took on an unsettling, hypnotic tone, falling to a register deeper than usual. “I know I haven’t hurt you, Dean. Trust that I never will unless you ask me to.”
Dean took in a heaving breath and shot up in bed, wide awake, skin slick and shining with sweat. He was still shuddering and twitching, the spark of each spasm eliciting a guttural, pleasured noise that started out in the center of his chest and sounded aloud through clenched teeth. There was a hard, heavy weight over his right leg and warm fluid running across his skin between it and the cloth of his briefs. His heart was beating as if it was trying to break through the ribs caging it. Taking in breath whenever he could get it, Dean swung his legs off the bed and sat, head bowed and wide-eyed, one hand to where his heart was pounding against his ribs.
“Your definition of ‘personal space’ has changed considerably,” Cas observed, teasing. “How long was I gone?”
Turning back and with a subdued smile, Sam gave him a quick nod and returned to his research, unrolling a scroll that required some careful handling. Castiel made a beeline for the kitchen. He was thirsty—a symptom of his astral form’s wellbeing that did not bode well. A good ten minutes later, Dean wandered in.
Sam started full-on laughing, letting go of Castiel and lifting one hand to give him a solid clap on the shoulder. When the angel twitched away, he stopped his hand just inches shy of contact. “Oh. Sorry,” Sam said, frowning. It was unlike the angel to carry injuries at all.
Resting his hand at the top of Cas’ thigh, he pulled it back, making contact with the skin of his sack, causing it to contract, evoking pleasured twitches as he ran his slick fingers firmly up the spine and down again to find its base. Taking hold of Cas’ balls, giving them a gentle but firm squeeze and pull upward, extracted a guttural keen and torso twist from the angel at his mercy. Cas struggled to keep his eyes closed, his breath turning short and shallow for a few moments. The scorching heat of Dean’s palm had his nerves dancing. Of its own accord, Castiel’s hand wandered across the sheets finding a welcome home on Dean’s folded leg.
Dean was staring at Sam wide-eyed. He nodded. As if a switch flipped, his shoulders straightened up from being hunched in, the nervous warble was gone from his voice, and the crushing sadness he’d been carrying through the months since losing Castiel didn’t have the sway over him it used to. Pointing a thumb in the direction of the galley, Dean asked, “Want some coffee?”
That simple touch started his heart racing again, had Dean sitting up straight, arching back, working one shoulder, and staying that way until the shaking moving the whole of him faded. Before long, the tension in his back released enough that he could sit forward. The two sat in silence, but his breathing stayed uneven and deep.
Finding himself chuckling again, Dean sighed. “Oh yeah, the feeling sucks. Not the finest example of intelligent design.” Having already popped his cork dreaming, it was safe to bet he was in nowhere near as dire straits as Cas. Dean looked to where his forearm rested on his knee. Turning his palm up, his gaze locked on it. It occurred to him Cas had possibly never had reason to give himself a hand. Dean wasn’t keen on the idea of... taking care of the problem, but he was even less keen on lying beside the seraph who’d just made him feel the way he did and telling him to take care of it himself. Problem was, the idea of doing so had his body winding itself up into uncomfortable rigidity again.
. The inner tug-of-war threatening to tear him apart stood perilously close to deciding against going any further. Silence stretched on between them until Cas’ tentative fingertips made contact with the skin of his back by his tailbone then turned over. Castiel ran his fingernails over his skin until his hand came to rest comfortably on Dean’s hip.
“Is something wrong?” Cas asked, innocently, still somewhat breathless. “Your heart...” Dean laughed again, taking in an uneasy breath. It was jackhammering away in his chest, pounding in his ears, and on its way to drowning out the sound of everything else. Leaving his hand resting on the nape of Dean’s neck, Cas brought up his other hand, covering the hand Dean kept pressed against his chest. Something in him instinctively recognized that Dean wasn’t shaking out of fear or sadness. A drive much more carnal than that was in play.
Castiel lifted a hand, conciliate, resting it in the middle of Dean’s back, resting his forearm on his hip and holding him closer with it. Smiling, Dean put both arms around the seraph, pulling him in and stayed that way until he felt the need to speak. “Whenever you’re ready.” Dean’s tone made it crystal clear he was in no rush to back away. Truth be told, he enjoyed the fact that his heart seemed to be doing these goofy somersaults in his chest.
Dean doesn’t know how to describe the feeling in his chest, in his throat, in his lungs, so he kisses Cas instead, as if he’s trying to push the feeling through their mouths. With his pants around his ankles and his boots still on, there’s no escaping the awkward shuffle as he pushes Cas back by the hips towards the bed.
“Don’t leave,” Dean says, panic flooding him. He doesn’t know how he knows that Cas is about to slip out of his mind, but he does, and it scares him. “Not now Cas, please.”
Cas tastes hot and dark, yet bright at the same time, something like pop rocks. Dean doesn’t know if it’s Cas’ innate grace, or if it’s a consequence of Cas, or if it’s because Dean is so stupidly in love with him. Cas’ stubble scrapes across Dean’s, a rasp that’s exciting, less familiar than the rest of the kiss. It’s good, Dean’s always liked it, even when he tried to pretend like he didn’t.
Dean does so, opening his eyes to find Cas right there, inches in front of him, close enough that Dean could count the little droplets clinging to his eyelashes.
He hisses in pain when Cas grasps his arm, fingers slipping through the blood coating it. But the next second a wave of warmth washes over him, and the sting in his arm disappears, along with the ache in his back and the pounding in his head.
Another blow, and Dean feels blood spray into his eyes. His left eye is swollen shut, and the whole left side of his face is on fire, swollen and tight. It doesn’t matter. There’s no use fighting against Cas, he’s too strong. There’s no use winning against Cas, because it would be a loss in itself. If Dean can’t get through to Cas then they have lost, there’s no coming back from it.
"Jerk!" follows them down the hall, but Dean feels light, still holding onto Cas' hand, tripping over Cas' feet.
Dean wants to kiss him, but he also wants to watch, wants to see every minute change in Cas’ facial expressions, every flutter of his eyelashes, every bob of his Adam’s apple, the deepening of the color on his cheeks. This is Cas, unguarded in pleasure, giving his holy body up to Dean. His cock is thick in Dean’s hand, hot with blood, getting wetter, stickier with precome as Dean keeps stroking. He switches hands, fondling Cas’ balls with his left so he can lick his right hand. His palm already tastes salty and dark with sweat and sex, and it makes Dean’s brain go a little staticky. He grips Cas tight with his wet palm and jacks it fast, taking it up a notch.
“They are more…integrated with my true form,” Cas says. “I do not, technically speaking, have a back. My wings are intertwined with the rest of my body.”
Dean doesn’t have time to scream or protest before the bright light emanating from Cas forces him to close his eyes. When he opens them again, Cas looks different, sad, open.
Cas starts glowing, bright, so bright that Dean has to shut his eyes and turn his face. The light from Cas expands, explodes around the room and Dean is sure that this is it.
Cas is quick about it, and this time when he slides two fingers into Dean’s ass, it’s smooth and easy. Dean rocks his hips into Cas’ fingers before lifting up on his knees to properly fuck himself on them.
Dean flicks his tongue out, unable to help it, impatient for just a taste of Cas. Cas always tastes like the force of nature he is, like static electricity is clinging to him at all times, like crisp air after the weather shifts.
“S’alright,” Dean slurs sleepily. Jack must be busy now, and well, he gave Dean the chance to save Cas. And he’s
“Cas,” he gasps, and Cas responds by fucking him harder with his tongue. Relentless wet pushes, in and out, wet and warm. Cas’ tongue is firm but it has give, lets Dean clench around it.
“Hey, Cas,” he murmurs, turning his head enough that his nose nudges at Cas’ jaw. “Wanna get the check?”
“Dean,” Cas says, in his low voice. It vibrates through Dean, makes him gasp and shiver even as he surrenders.
“Something like that,” Cas agrees. “My core is energy. It is easiest for the human mind to translate that as fire. The wheels are…rings. Circling manifestations of intent, of thought, of direction.”
Cas doesn’t say anything, just keeps running his hands up and down Dean’s sides and trails his mouth over to kiss behind his ear.
He can’t see himself with Aaron. He can’t picture what it would be like to bend down and kiss him, can’t picture what it would be like to cup his face and lean in close, can’t picture what it would be like to press his body against Aaron’s.
. Fuck. What a stupid thing to say. But Cas is still staring at him, just as intense, the lines on his mouth a bit softer.
"Yeah. Gay guys, you know? Queers.” It's not until it's out of his mouth that Dean realizes he's never said it before. It had bounced around in his brain for years, but Dean had just shoved it aside. He had time to worry about monsters, and about Sammy, and anything else he had pushed to the side. Girls were easier. Girls were expected and he liked girls fine, he really did.
She hands it to an older woman who’s stepped around the partition. “Jessica, this is Dean, your next client,” she says.
With the way that Cas’ wings are scaled down and still fill an entire room, Dean finds it hard to imagine how large and grand they must be.
Cas nuzzles at it and Dean just groans. The skin of his ass is sensitive, and Cas’ scruff feels rougher, hotter, here.
Cas snorts and Jessica laughs. “It is for many things,” she says. “But in terms of taking care of your piercings, the important thing is to keep them clean. Don't touch them with unwashed hands. Try not to tug on them. Under no circumstances should you put your mouth on them.” She eyes Cas as she says this, and Cas looks away. She gives Dean, and what he's realizing now must be a prominent hickey on his neck, a significant look. “We have a cleaning solution on sale here for you if you need it. Showering is fine, but don't submerge them in a bath or a pool until they're healed. Bleeding is normal for a bit as is build up. Be gentle when you wipe it off.”
He feels Cas’ desire for a kiss, so he leans forward and kisses him. Cas tastes like the beer they drank, like the rain outside, like static electricity and power and ozone and everything that makes up the world around them. It should sound stupid and overly romantic, but Dean can feel that Cas is flattered. He can feel that Cas doesn’t find him ridiculous, because he’s right. Cas tastes like the universe because he helped build it.
Dean’s heart leaps, and so does his dick. “Okay,” he agrees, because of course. Dean wants Cas as close as possible, wants to give him everything he is. Of course he’s going to have sex with Cas. He leans back in for another kiss, but Cas’ hand stops him.
That makes Dean smile. "No, I meant...it's stupid, how I look at it and expect to see something different. I must be going through a mid-life crisis."
And if Dean can’t take care of him, well, hopefully an angel can. It does feel like begging, it feels like something dark and sad, to be praying to Cas when he’s not even sure Cas is listening. If whatever is going on to make him seem so off makes him not care.
He’s patient tonight, probably because Dean made him come no less than three times earlier (Dean is occasionally wildly jealous of Cas’ angel refractory period), content to hold onto Dean’s waist and nuzzle at his jaw and ears.
“Dean?” It is Sam’s voice, accompanying another round of knocks. “Please tell me that was you guys.”
Cas goes easily, apparently content to be led as he sucks Dean’s tongue into his mouth. It’s overwhelming again, the idea that Cas, who could kill him with a pinky, who can change and make and end worlds, is letting Dean walk him awkwardly across his bedroom. Cas is an angel, and he’s going to let Dean defile him.
Cas’ hands sweep back up Dean’s arms, stroking over the curve of his shoulders, before curling around to his chest again. He thumbs at Dean’s nipples and makes a happy sort of rumbling sound when it makes Dean groan and arch his chest into the touch. He drags his mouth down too, sucking on the underside of Dean’s jaw as his hands go lower, over his ribs, as though Cas is counting them. His right hand trails back up, finally settling over Dean’s rapidly beating heart.
“Kids,” Dean says, teasing, sitting himself up a bit more so he can nuzzle his head against Cas’ shoulder. He feels a bit ridiculous, sappy, doing so, but Cas is warm and he runs his fingers through the hair on the back of Dean’s head. “How d’you feel?” Dean asks. “All mojo’d up again?”
Dean heart does a bunch of stupid flips, like he’s a teenage girl holding his crush’s hand for the first time. Cas’ hand is big and warm and it feels
Cas obeys, sliding back and snatching the lube from Dean, pouring more on his own hand before wrapping it around Dean’s cock.
The car rocks, their skin slaps, and Cas makes a soft sound of punched out pleasure every time their hips meet.
Dean groans. “It’s not very polite to comment on noises that you may happen to overhear!” he snaps at Sam.
Dean lifts his hand, broken and then healed by Cas, cupping his jaw. Cas’ stubble is rough against his palm, and the callouses on Dean’s thumb catch on the dry skin of his lips.
It’s a staggering blow. And before Dean can even reorient himself from it there’s another one. Dean grunts and gasps, helpless beneath Cas’ fist. Opening his left eye hurts, and Dean’s had enough blows to the face to know that this is bad, that his bones have broken. “Cas, this isn’t you,” he says, forcing his eyes up to meet Cas’. “This isn’t you.”
It makes it easier for Dean to convince his fluttering, stupid heart that it’s fine. “Yeah? Well, so am I. I didn’t know you…had thoughts like that.”
Fuck. Now Dean feels guilty. He swallows again and forces himself to look back at Cas. “No, it’s fine,” he mumbles. “It doesn’t mean…it’s not because I don’t like ya, or I don’t want to. I can still, you know, help you out.” He smiles, a cocky flirtatious grin. “I could blow ya,” he offers.
Still clearly upset and shaken, Cas reaches out again, this time gently taking Dean’s forearm and pulling him to his feet. His hand flutters a bit once Dean’s standing, before ultimately letting go. “There’s an angel,” he says, “named Naomi. She’s the one who got me out of Purgatory.” Cas pauses and looks around, as if getting his bearings. “She…she has tools. To get into my mind. She was telling me what to do. I…I was not in control of my actions, Dean.” Cas’ eyes flick around, from Dean’s face, to the tablet in his hands, to the crypt around them.
Dean just hangs on, one hand clutching at Cas’ hair, the other scrambling for purchase on the sheets, his heels digging into the small of Cas’ back.
“Well let’s try,” Dean says. “Come on, Cas, let’s try.” Then, taking his own advice, he leans forward and kisses Cas.
"Your face?" Cas picks his head up so he can tilt it quizitively as he meets Dean's eyes in the mirror.
Cas flirting back is much more intoxicating than the beer, the way he licks his lips, the way his eyes darken whenever they make eye contact, the way he unsubtly stares at Dean, at Dean’s own lips, his eyes, his throat, his crotch. His sly smiles and the pleased expression on his face. He wears that one a lot more now.
Dean shivers. He’s done this before, to a few of the more adventurous girls he’d been with, but he’s never had anyone do it to him. He’s glad that it’s Cas.
“What?” Dean interrupts. “You wouldn’t have made fun if you’d known I was a fuckin’ faggot? Making fun is only something you do with other normal people?” Once his anger has control of him it’s hard to stop, always has been. Dean keeps his eyes firmly on the road. Can’t wreck Baby.
When Dean lifts his head, the room is clean again, papers back in place, blood gone. Cas is still resting with his head on Dean’s collarbone, breaths even. Sam pulls back a little, smiling at Dean, giving his shoulder a little shake.
Cas’ smile dims just a bit. He leaves the trees and crosses to Dean, cupping his hand around Dean’s cheek, just the way he’d done to heal him.
It’s a shock. It takes Dean’s breath away. Cas’ lips feel like they’re made of static, tingling and untouchable and powerful.
“You…you should go,” Cas says, his voice sounding watery, full, like it had before he’d disappeared.
Dean looks at the picture they make in the mirror: Cas hardly visible, just his tan arms wrapped around the fading color of Dean's t-shirt and his hair, dark and unruly on Dean's shoulder. Dean looks at himself, at the lines on his face that stay there, at the hints of gray at his temples, peppered into his scruff, at the freckles dotted across his skin. He can admit that he doesn't look bad but he looks, well, human, and normal, and aging. It strikes him as odd, that after everything he's gone through he should look so...plain. Then again, maybe it's best that it doesn’t show. It's good that his face doesn't have any trace of the monster, the killer.
The connection goes both ways, so Dean knows that Cas can feel his chagrin. He tries to make up for it by projecting “you’re hot” very loudly in his mind.
Sometimes Cas will take a piss, or brush his teeth, or drop to his knees and take care of Dean's morning wood. Or, like today, he'll just wrap his arms around Dean's waist and rest there.
He’s always done that, Dean realizes. Ever since the very first time. Tilted his head and got in Dean’s space and
Dean’s not even sure what noises he’s making into the pillow anymore, desperate, garbled sounds of pleasure and he tries to fuck his hips back even harder, tries to thrust his cock against the sheets but he’s held fast by just Cas’ one hand.
Cas shifts, pushing Dean’s knees back so he can kiss him properly. He cries out into Dean’s mouth as Dean feels him come. The room itself seems to shudder with him, the air rippling as Cas shakes, as he pants into Dean’s mouth and floods his ass with come.
Dean likes hunting with Cas. Once upon a time he thought he’d never hunt with anyone other than his dad or his brother. But Cas and him...it’s easy. They know each other well enough to predict each other’s movements in a fight, and can communicate a plan with only gestures. And, well, Dean always has a good time with Cas.
Then there was Cas. Cas who made him laugh who made him smile. Who made Dean's stomach swoop in ways too terrifying to examine. Cas who Dean couldn't breathe without. He hadn’t meant to fall in love with Cas, hadn’t even really noticed that he had until it was too late.
Cas stands behind Dean and puts his hand on his shoulder. "They do suit you," he says, voice low, before he kisses the space behind Dean's newly pierced right ear.
“I’m not injured,” Dean assures him, because he doesn’t want Cas to worry. He doesn’t want to see the little furrow between his eyebrows when he pulls his face out of the pillow. He keeps up his petting of Cas’ thigh. “I’m just…”
“I know you’re in there,” Dean says. He doesn’t know what’s happened, why Cas, Dean’s Cas, the real Cas, with his soft smiles and deep eyes has gone, but he’d been there before, in Purgatory, and he’d been there in their shitty motel room, when he looked at Dean and admitted his fear of Heaven. He’s there, Dean just has to reach him. For Cas’ sake as much as his. “I know you can hear me,” he continues. His right hand is still throbbing, broken, and captive by Cas’ iron grip, but Dean reaches out with his left.
Dean’s not exactly sure what Cas is talking about, but it hardly matters a second later, because Cas is kissing him again.
It’s scary, organ swooping, breath quickening terrifying, to be faced with Cas like this now, all the force of his love, his attention, his lust. Wasted on Dean. Dean gasps a little again and rubs at the rumbling feeling in his chest. Cas doesn’t think it’s a waste, he reminds himself as Cas bends over to take off his dress shoes and his socks before stepping out of his pants. Cas is an angel, he can’t be tricked, not by Dean, not by Dean who wasn’t ever trying to trick him.
“Yeah, sorry,” Dean says. He looks away from Cas, words tumbling out, too fast, too graceless, too obviously a coverup. “Human bodies. Get old and stop workin’ an’ shit.”
Then Cas kisses him and Dean’s eyes slide shut again. He puts his hands on Cas’ hips and opens his mouth and lets himself be kissed.
Dean turns back to the road and hums softly as Sam settles in, reclining, stretching his legs as much as possible.
Cas kisses him again. “You are astounding, Dean,” he says. “I never imagined…I didn’t think I would ever…the sensations of sex are nice. But it is
Aaron who meets Dean’s eyes over the heads of pretty women and orders a fruity drink, complete with an umbrella. Who looks at Dean from under his eyelashes and accuses Dean of flirting.
“Cas?” he calls out. He says it, thinks it, calls to Cas with his voice and his thoughts, a plea, a prayer.
Dean slides a hand up his back, rubbing up Cas’s spine, flattening over where his wings would be if they were corporeal. “Your wings felt cool,” he says, because he’s still enough asleep to say so. “Cool” seems like such an inadequate word for what it had felt like to feel something so otherworldly, but he’s not a poet, or even smart with his words, like Sam, so all he can do is hope Cas understands him anyways. “Could I see ‘em?” He remembers vividly every single time he’s seen Cas’ wings, projected onto the walls behind him, light cracking, shining. Even the time he saw them as burnt impressions in the ground, fallen, gone, dead, just like Cas had been. Dean wishes he could forget that one, but, well.
Flirting with Cas is fun. It’s easy for them to get swept away in each other, to get lost in the world-altering, god-shattering depths of their feelings. Sometimes, Dean thinks that his love for Cas will drown him. He’s more than happy to let it, but this is nice too, flirting with Cas in a bar over the top of a beer bottle. It feels lighter. There’s not so much pressure on Dean and Cas, just two guys at a bar, the way there is on Dean Winchester and Castiel, hunter and angel.
The girl nods and scribbles that down of the form she has, before putting it on a clipboard and handing it to Dean. "I just need you to fill out The rest of this paperwork, and I'll need to photocopy your ID.”
Cas makes another sound into Dean’s mouth and drags his fingertips up again, this time digging in with his nails.
“Wanna stick around a bit, kid?” Dean asks. “I can make us dinner. Breakfast? Fuck, what time is it?” It’s been a long time since Dean has allowed himself so deeply that we woke up unaware of what time it is.
Just hearing Cas say the world “sex” makes Dean flush hot with arousal. “We’ll work on that,” he says.
Dean can admit that he’s most likely biased, but Cas has a perfect fucking cock. Thick and uncut, always so quick to respond to Dean’s touch. It’s already hard enough to be poking out of its foreskin, dark red, precome pearling at the tip.
Like right now, he’s sitting next to Cas at a bar, warm and flush from the celebratory drinks and Cas’ company. Mostly from Cas’ company, if he’s being honest. Dean has a high enough tolerance that a night of beers can’t quite touch him. But they do give him an excuse to tilt his weight against Cas’ shoulder, to laugh too hard at Cas’ jokes (because he likes seeing Cas’ eyes crinkle in satisfaction when Dean laughs), to stare at Cas for too long. Cas, for his part, is matching Dean drink for drink, even though it does even less for him than it does Dean.
The Empty bubbles around them. It’s angry, hissing almost. Dean is sure it’s taken the form of one of his many ghosts, but he keeps his eyes shut. “Fuck off, he’s mine,” he says.
“No, this isn’t…” Cas says vaguely, sounding upset. He puts his hands on his temples and shakes his head. It’s a very human gesture.
Dean always feels lonely at first, when Cas’ presence leaves his head, but Cas makes up for it by cupping his hand around Dean’s cock.
The girl makes another mark on the form when Dean has a thought. Instinctively he bites it back, but then he thinks fuck it yet again. He's already made a fool of himself in front of this girl. "Should I get both ears?" he asks, getting the attention of both the girl and Cas. "Since I like both?"
Dean steadies his dick in one hand and Cas’ hip in the other and then Cas is sinking down, onto his cock, and Dean moans, something from deep in his chest, at the shock of it, of having Cas around him, surrounding him, of being inside of Cas.
Cas should be so jacked, no reason he should have such glorious curves of muscle for Dean to run his tongue over. All of Cas’ strength is innate, he doesn’t need to train or to tone.
Cas raises an eyebrow at him. “Of course I am,” he says. “This is your dream, Dean. How else could I be here?”
It scares Dean, just as it makes him certain that there’s a way to the real Cas underneath, to his Cas. “I need you,” he says, his voice choked and broken. Just like him.
or if it’s a natural, instinctive mimic. He’s just glad he gets to see it. He likes knowing that Cas is into it, that he’s affected by the sex, even though there’s never been much room for doubt on that front. Cas turned out to be a horny fucker in bed, down for it after nothing more than a glance or a smile. He’s never been anything enthusiastic and willing in bed, and he fucks like he’ll be able to fuse them together if only he could get just a bit deeper.
Luckily the kid doesn't seem to be about to kick his old ass out. "A lobe piercing?" she asks, flicking one of the rings in her own ear.
Cas leans down and kisses the line of Dean’s hipbone, his mouth hot, purposeful, like he’s trying to brand Dean with his touch again.
Like the rest of them, Dean chooses to ignore it. But the longer they’re with Cas, the more pointed the looks become. Every time Cas and Dean stare at each other a little too long, a little too intensely, every time their touches linger, every time they stand a little bit too close together.
Dean presses his fingers harder into Cas’ wrist as Cas pulls himself up. He doesn’t hug Cas this time, but they’re looking in each other’s eyes as Cas explains, and that’s enough.
“Not important then,” Dean says, tipping his head up and then he’s back at Cas’ mouth, kissing him again, and yes, this is what is important, only this.
Cas takes his permission, straddling Dean’s hips, hovering above him, before he leans down to kiss Dean, slow and wet.
But then Dean wakes up with his head in Cas’ lap and Cas’ fingers gently resting in his hair. He’s surprised by how relaxed he is, how his first thought is that it feels
“Hey,” Dean says, squeezing Cas’ hand as they speed up, “don’t let go, okay? No more sacrificing yourself. You follow me out this time.”
He keeps sneaking glances at himself in the rearview mirror on the drive home. He knows Cas is catching him at it, because he smirks every time, but he doesn't say anything. He just looks at Dean with a heat in gaze that makes Dean's stomach tighten in anticipation. Part of him thinks they ought to pull over and fuck in the back seat already, but there's something exciting about waitin too. They don't have to rush, there will be time for them to fuck once they get back. Plenty of it.
“I didn’t know,” Cas says. “I didn’t know, and Naomi couldn’t understand. What I feel for you. What you feel for me. She couldn’t prepare me for it.”
Benny brings it up again almost a full day later, when he and Dean are struggling through some tough underbrush. “So, what about your angel?” he asks.
There’s a million things Dean could say in response, swagger, and pride, but what comes out is an earnest, “Thanks.” He would be embarrassed, but he’s too turned on, overwhelmed, by the scent of Cas, by the taste of him, by how Cas’s hips feel cupped in Dean’s palms, by the tug of Cas’ fingers in Dean’s hair, by the breathy, pleased noises Cas keeps making.
Dean’s breath hitches and he rocks his hips, circling them, grinding into Cas’ hand. “Fuck yeah, Cas,” he says, low and raspy.
“Nothin’,” Dean says. He can’t resist the temptation to reach out and touch Cas, to run his hand up and down his skin, to watch his hand leave gooseflesh in its wake.
Cas presses his teeth harder into Dean’s skin, nipping, sharp little pricks of teeth before he trails his mouth up to suck at the knob at the top of Dean’s neck.
Baby’s windows are still fogged, the air inside warm and heavy with the scent of sex. The rain drums against Baby’s roof, a soft, far away clatter. It mixes well with the soft rhythm of their breaths.
“Dean,” Cas says, pulling away, their lips brushing against each other. “Dean, you have to breathe,” he says yet again.
Jessica smiles over at him. "I like to do this in front of customers, so you can see,” she says. "You can see me open the packages, and see me clean them as well."
Dean gapes openly. There’s three pairs of wings, the topmost pair the largest of the three, arcing over the other two. They’re black, at least at first look, but the next second they’re shimmering, shifting, like an oil slick, Dean thinks, a black so deep that it’s reflecting rainbows, reds and purples, greens and blues.
Cas groans again, shameless. Ever since Dean kissed him, Cas has been nothing but open and honest about sex, about his pleasure, about how much he wants, and fuck if Dean doesn’t find it fucking hot. He sits up enough to slip his coats over his shoulders, leaving him in just the thin white dress shirt he still wears, the fabric stretched over his broad shoulders, his deceptively strong arms, his pecs.
It leaves Dean gasping in pain and Cas, but not Cas at the same time, distant and wrong and empty, turns away from him, back to the tablet.
If Dean was twenty years old again, he thinks just that sentence would have gotten him hard again. As it is though…“Fuck, Cas,” he says. “I-I don’t know if I can.”
Dean groans and arches his back into the touch, and so Cas keeps doing it. Fuck, Dean is going to have scratches up and down his back. It’s thrilling. He’d had Cas’ mark once before, he wants more of them, all of them, he wants to belong to Cas in every way possible, human or angel.
Without Cas holding him up Dean slumps, adrenaline not enough to keep the pain away. He can feel his heartbeat in his head, behind his eyes. His arm and face are a blinding wash of pain. He gasps and tries to breathe and watches Cas.
It’s a hunt well done. The ghost has been put to rest and the family had been grateful and relieved that they wouldn’t have to move out of their new home less than a month after moving into it.
“Yeah,” Dean says. He feels hot, like all of his skin is too small, like there are charges beneath his skin that are being set off. “Fuck.”
When the first started doing this, it wouldn’t have been enough, Dean too unused to the sensation to be able to relax into it, the spit not slick enough to ease the way. But now Cas’ long finger slides in easily, Dean ready and eager, shoving his hips back on it greedily.
“Yes,” Cas agrees. He runs his wet fingers across Dean’s ass, stroking, petting on his way to Dean’s hole.
“Alright, Cas, I’m comin’,” Dean says, taking a step forward. It doesn’t feel like there’s anything beneath his feet, just like it doesn’t feel like he’s walking through anything. It’s just…cold, but not a chill, just the absence of any heat.
“Dean!” Sam says, and now he sounds genuinely affronted. “You shouldn’t call yourself that! And…well you are kind of freak, but not because of
“What is it?” Dean asks, even though he thinks he knows. He’s afraid of it. Of knowing. Of saying it, of thinking it. It’s too big. If he ignores it, it stays tucked away, safe forever.
It seems to work, because Cas’ eyes go all bright and interested the way they do when he’s curious about something. “You did?” he asks.
Cas squints a little. “I do not think direction matters,” he says. Then, “Dean. Did you come here without a plan?”
Dean’s back twinges a bit, but as soon as he notices it, Cas’ hand is there, big and warm as he rubs up and down Dean’s spine. There’s the warm rush of grace and Dean’s muscles go liquid, the sticky come between them disappearing along with any tension in his body.
, spilling out over Dean’s bed and across his floor. Dean spreads his fingers out, catching more of Cas’ feathers in his fingers.
“’M here,” Dean murmurs, unable to resist the temptation to lick at the line of Cas’ stubble where it spills over his chin and down his throat.
“I was scared,” Cas admits quietly. “I was afraid that I wouldn’t be able to stop. Naomi wanted me to kill you.” He looks back up at Dean, eyes wide and uncertain.
Cas smiles in that way he has when he thinks he’s been clever. “I thought a joke might relax you,” he says. And then, with no further pause, he swallows Dean’s cock.
Cas’ mouth opens for him easily, tongue warm and wet where it flicks into Dean’s mouth. Cas holds onto Dean by his ribs, seemingly determined to stick his tongue as far down Dean’s throat as possible.
“Yes, Dean, oh,” Cas gasps. He puts his hand on Dean’s shoulder, gripping just like he must have once long ago to pull Dean close and save him, just like he had to push Dean away and save him then too.
Dean blinks his eyes hard. He never…he…he’d…he’d tried, after Dad…after Dad had sent him away all on his own for his birthday and left Dean to cry by himself behind a crumbling church, the burnt bones of two women who had loved each other beside him. Dean hadn’t known back then how Dad had even known, still doesn’t, so he’d been quiet, careful afterwards, even more than he already had been. Only when Dad was far away, and only when they were desperate, when Sammy’s stomach had started rumbling. He doesn’t know if he’d started slipping, once Sam had left them and his dad had spent more and more time away. Doesn’t know if he’d started slipping more once Dad was dead. But men in bars had always known. And those two imposters…at that weird fucking convention…they’d felt
Dean stands in the bunker kitchen, blinking in the harsh lights. The mug of coffee is still warm between his hands. His head is spinning, pounding from Cas’ info dump. He shakes it a little to clear it.
It’s a sloppy kiss, Dean thrusting his tongue mindlessly against Cas’ as he tries to remember how to breathe.
It’s nice enough, Dean thinks, the soft brush of the water hitting his skin, the cool feeling it leaves behind. The smell of the wet air and the wet earth. The warmth of Cas’ hand in his.
Cas hums lightly. "I think they would all suit you," he says. "I also think you have a thought that you want me to affirm."
“What the fuck,” Dean grumbles. He thought for sure that Sam was going to make himself scarce for a while yet. If there’s another apocalypse already Sam can handle it by his damn self.
Cas lets him pull his hand out and replace Cas’ fingers with his own. Cas is tight and smooth around Dean’s two fingers, not quite wet enough for a smooth slide, Dean’s calluses catching.
“Fuck yeah, Cas,” he grunts, rocking his hips gently in the cradle of Cas’ groin. “Fill me up so good.” Cas always seems to appreciate Dean’s dirty talk, his eyes going dark and hungry.
“Dean,” Cas says, and just Dean’s name in his voice sounds wondering, rapturous. It just makes Dean’s heart pound harder,
“Sounds cool,” Dean says, because, well, it does. It’s hard to imagine, especially because he’s so used to Cas, used to seeing him as he appears to Dean. Sometimes it’s easy to forget that Cas is a being of magnificent celestial power. He’s just…Cas. Dean’s Cas. “Wish I could see you without losin’ my eyes.”
“I do,” Dean says quickly, before he loses his nerve. “I feel better when you’re around, man, like maybe shit will finally work out for once instead of crashing and burning."
He scrapes his nails down the line of Dean’s spine, the scratches followed by the scrape of his facial hair and the wet of his tongue.
He can tell without looking that Sam is pouting. “Why didn’t you say anything?” he presses. “I had no idea you even liked dudes.”
Cas moves his mouth along the line of Dean’s collarbone, warm wet trails across it, following the arch of Dean’s shoulder to kiss at the soft skin of Dean’s armpit.
Dean hardly thinks. Emotion overwhelms him. His mind is a riot of relief and fuckin’ joy, just as seeing Cas. After a year of Purgatory, of washed out forests and Leviathans, and scavenging survival, after a year of prayer, Cas in here. He doesn’t have enough thought left to be embarrassed about the way he wraps himself around Cas, full-bodied and desperate.
Jessica’s piercing station has a padded table, like a doctor's, and a whole shelf of things like cotton balls and swabs and rubbing alcohol. She has a little metal tray on a stand that reminds Dean of a dentist, except on it are packaged needles and the jewelry Dean had picked out, and a few of the industrial rods in different lengths.
“Well…you know…” Sam says awkwardly. Out of the corner of his eyes, Dean sees him shrug. “You’re…you’re you. You’re always so macho. I thought…that you thought…that maybe you thought like Dad.”
Cas reaches behind them with his spare hand, opening Dean’s door. They stumble in together, Cas pushing the door closed behind him with his foot as Dean pushes Cas’ coat down off his arms.
He also feels something hit his shoulder where it’s tilted up, not quite solid, but not like air either. Gently, moving slowly, Dean moves his arm more, brushing against it. It’s like touching static, crackling energy, but at the same time it’s warm, like the heat coming off of a comforting fire, and soft, soft beyond even the softest fur or the finest silk. He knows instinctively that he’s touching Cas’ wings. He’s never thought about it, never even wondered, not really. Cas’ wings had always seemed like something…other, something not allowed. And then, after Cas had lost them, Dean hadn’t wanted to ask him about it, about how it had felt to have his grace and his powers, to have everything he was, stripped from him. He knows well enough what it’s like to have your sense of self torn, he didn’t need to hear it from Cas.
Cas’ face doesn’t even show rage, or even frustration when he brings his fist down on Dean’s face again.
Dean closes his eyes and tries not to think, not to think about what it means that Cas wants to worship all of him, wants to kiss him softly and stroke his skin even though Dean can feel Cas’ erection whenever he shifts his weight. Cas doesn’t seem bothered by it at all, mouthing his way down the back of Dean’s neck, over his shoulders, licking across the line of his shoulder blades.
It’s a strange sensation, tingly and sharp almost, beneath a texture so soft that it feels like it’s slipping off, around, Dean’s lips.
Cas puts one hand on Dean’s left shoulder, right where he used to wear Cas’ brand, and lets his other rest between them, on Dean’s chest over his t-shirt, over his heart. Dean has no doubt that Cas can feel it, pounding away as it is.
Dean laughs, delighted. It’s an odd word for him to apply to himself, even in his own head. He’s never had much delight in his life. But...he loves Cas, and he loves his baby, and he loves how Cas gets determined and dirty when he’s horny.
Dean groans, which Cas seems to take as a sign, because next he’s back between the cheeks, licking, flick, flick, flick, and then pressing his tongue in deep, briefly, before pulling back out.
Castiel peeled his t-shirt off, wincing as the parts of the shirt that had dried into his wounds with the blood ripped his wounds back open. Sam cringed at the sight. The man in front of his was just one giant bruise. On top of the two black eyes and the finger bruises on his neck he was sporting, he was black and blue all over, with cuts and gashes freely bleeding all over his chest. And, from the looks of it, all the injuries didn’t stop at the stomach. Mild burns peppered his arms. Sam held in the urge to gag as the man in front of him calmly observed him. “Jeez, Cas,” he croaked out. “Who did this to you?”
Gabriel leaned over to refill some of the stragglers’ coffees. “Geez, you can cut the tension with a knife, am I right?”
Castiel winced. Obviously someone had told Dean of his past. “I’m not what I used to be. Yes, I did do some...bad things, but none of those were of my own volition. And I’m trying to get out.”
“Castiel, we have a shipment of Grace coming in today. It should be very straightforward, but I want you there in case it goes south. It has not escaped our notice that the Demons are rapidly diminishing, and, though there is no sign of that spreading to our Host, I don’t want to risk this deal. It’s important...And before you respond, you would not have officially come back into the fold. It’s likely that nothing out of the ordinary is going to happen. But I want you stationed there.” Castiel stared at the ceiling and tried to groan as inaudibly as possible, not wanting to risk the wrath of his Commander.
They stood there for a second, swaying in an almost dance-like way, just enjoying the other’s presence before Persephone felt a sharp pain in his back. He looked behind him to find a demon, arm still outstretched from throwing the angel blade embedded in Persephone’s back, before the god collapsed onto Hades and everything went black.
—!” The last of the word was strangled out as his throat seized. Gurneys lay overturned, drawers and cabinet doors were all ajar and smashed, everything on the counters and standalone cabinets having been thrown about, now strewn haphazardly on the floor. Acrid ozone fumes stung his nostrils. Shattered glass and shards of burst light bulbs littered the floor, crunching under his boot.
Dean walked back into the room, first aid kit, fifth of vodka, and shot glass in hand. He closed the door behind him, the scuffing sound of the door latching into the frame giving off the prescient impression of a pressure-release hiss preceding a freight train’s departure from station.
Suddenly, Cas’ lips were close enough to feel them brush against his, feel his breath, when he murmured, “If only once...”
Castiel glanced at the bottle and laughed. “You think I’d say no?” Cas asked rhetorically, one eyebrow going up. Dean smiled, shaking his head.
“Cas...” Dean whispered, undeniably taken. A swell in his newfound ocean expanse washed over him from behind, folding him over forward. Before Dean could think a single thing other, his lips were pressed to Cas’, and he was breathing in the scent of him and the intoxicating cologne of ozone like a man starved of air.
A few minutes went by before Cas moved to pull away. There was a partial smile on his lips as he spoke, his cheek resting in the folds of Dean's shirt. “Don’t do anything stupid.”
“Good,” Sam said, taking in a sniffle, clearing his throat, and giving Castiel a firm pat on the back.
Letting Cas down onto the near side of the bed with care, Dean found himself disliking the physical distance between them. Cas took in a sharp breath, shifting to hold his entire right side off the bed. He let the sheet fall away from his hip and leg, keeping the remainder of his modesty. Blood soaked into the sheet from wounds at the hip all the way down the side of his leg. When Dean looked back, drops of blood marked a trail behind them. There were shards of glass lodged in the angel’s side from his shoulder to his feet. Angry-looking welts all over Cas’ body were much more apparent under the white light of a battery-powered lantern.
Laughing, Dean backed away, picking up the duffle bag off the other table with a playful smirk on. “If I do, you’ll be the first to know.” Castiel’s knowing, unwavering eyes watched him go...
“This is going to take a while,” was Dean’s curt but unmistakably caring reply. Castiel nodded and settled back, letting himself melt into the mattress, giving himself permission to enjoy the sensation of Dean’s examining touch. The endorphins flooding his vessel took the edge off all but the sharpest spikes of pain. Having run his fingertips across something he thought was glass but unable to see it very well, Dean picked up the penlight from the cheap, faux wood finished tee vee tray. Clicking it on, looking for a glint off the tiny splinter of glass, he grazed the blade of the scalpel across Cas’ skin, steadily, surgically probing for the slightest catch to locate it.
Ditching any form of cover, Castiel crossed the bed, his expression nothing less than predatory. He fitted himself against Dean, knees sliding out to the sides, pressing flush against him from stem to sternum, his bone-stiff organ rested against the spinal groove in the small of Dean’s back. Cas’ quick, fluid movement left Dean no more time to react than it took to stiffen in shock from head to toe. Dean’s raised hands stayed in the air. Fingertips at his hairline on the back of his neck smoothly traveled up onto the crown of his head, taking hold of him by the hair. A hand firmly pressing on his breastbone pulled him back to rest on Cas’ chest, a gentle tug on his hair coming into play once Cas deemed it was time for Dean to lay his head back on his shoulder.
