Castiel is also smiling, though smaller and more exasperated. “ I’ve seen it. It’s actually rather embarrassing, but as the youngest siblings we were stuck with each other as children and still spend most of our holidays together. “
Jack should go back to his own bed. His bed is nice. It has MooMoo and Quackers and Greg and his blanket is fuzzy and green. Daddy says he should stay in bed until Daddy or Claire wakes up. Daddy says Jack is safe in his own bed.
Castiel is watching the spinning color wheel on the screen as he eases himself onto the low stool. He waits for it to disappear and the familiar image of Charlie posing with some famous actress fills the space, then carefully gathers his words. “ If I show you some emails, could you tell me who sent them?”
It’s fairly late in the evening when Dean decides they’ve reached a stopping point. Everything is unpacked in the house; everything that needs to be washed has been washed (or is currently being washed by its proper machine); everything that can be feng shui’ed has been sorta moved around into the best position allowed by space constraints. Cain had left mid afternoon, once everything was inside, to help his part-time employee, Andy Gallagher, pack up at the farmers market. Castiel had taken the kids to the Nashville Zoo for some big event and had rolled back in with two sleepyheads a few hours later. Dean had left them to their well deserved naps.
Cas and the kids went out to dinner with Meg. That’s where Dean would have tried first. But they’re not home, so he’ll have to look elsewhere for quiet company.
He does however, hit up the additions station. And because it’s a big morning for him, he splurges on a splash of half and half and what the hell, a sprinkle of cinnamon. Dean’s pretty sure he’s read somewhere that cinnamon is supposed to be good for digestion or something.
“ You’re costume’s cool, too,” Claire adds.
“ Dad! They’re done!”
Dean doesn’t even hesitate. He leans in and wraps his arms around the man’s waist and squeezes, hooking his chin over Cain’s shoulder. Cain immediately returns the embrace, arms curling around Dean, hands pressing flat and firm on his back. It’s a solid hug, without words. Reaffirming the mutual affection and respect they thought was lost so long ago.  Confirming this second chance.
Dean watches him walk away as he takes off his outer gear and stores it properly. He’s already trying to remember what t-shirts and lounge pants he has clean in his dresser drawers. Nothing as cute as what Cas has on, but there has to be something without too many holes.
. Because Claire is sleeping and it’s not nice to wake up people. Daddy says so. He
“ A woman. Or a very young or slight man. “  Cain mutters his observation.
And that’s a loaded word he doesn’t think either of them are ready to drop just yet. So Castiel merely leans down and wraps Dean in his arms, still mindful of his sour breath, and whispers into the damp hair on the younger man’s crown, “ Thank you, Dean.”
“ That’s not the point.”
Castiel stares out the window opposite, into the darkness beyond the covered porch. Unlike the main house, which is thoroughly lit throughout the perimeter, Cain’s cabin is surrounded by natural darkness. Front and back porches are ablaze beneath modern LEDs, but the rest of the area remains undisturbed by security measures. Castiel can just see the outline of the closest trees, his own ghostly reflection blurring them further.  He refuses to meet his own gaze and concentrates on staring past his image and finding more indistinct outlines in the woods. Distract himself from this newest nightmare and gather his unstable emotions back under his calm facade.
“ Thanks, Jack. These are my favorite.” Dean is beaming at the little boy, and a glance up at Cas’ soft expression causes a blush to crawl across his face. Better get that under control real quick. He tweaks the red felt rooster’s comb on Jack’s head and stands back up, stretching out the kink in his back. The homemade pack isn’t heavy, but it is awkward if he’s not standing up straight. He gives Cas a wide grin because he has the most awful pick up line about bees and honey screaming in his head but he’s not gonna be an ass like that. So instead, Dean says, “ Staying sane?”
Dean pulls his best bitch face, which is technically second only to Sam’s. “ Know what?”
For his part, Castiel merely looks down where the red stain is beginning to spread across his shirt, then back up to Dean, his smile growing even wider. “ It matches the ketchup stains from breakfast.” He reaches out for the frozen pop and Dean promptly deposits it into the man’s hand. “ Thank you, so much. For the tissues, as well.”
“ Dad, does your head hurt?”
Because it’s ass o’clock on the Thursday morning and Dean is here. In his Baby. With his recently bailed out, still drunk, moderately belligerent father in the passenger seat. Spending his well deserved sleeping time driving through the blank darkness to get John Winchester back to Bobby’s so maybe the sorry sonuvabitch can dry out for the holiday weekend.
He could get used to this.
in their new Christmas pajamas from Aunt Meg. ” He hands over the tote bag of recently received presents to Claire as she gets out.
Castiel nods his approval of her teeth brushing and pulls out the chair between Cain and himself for her to hop onto. “ A new neighbor will be moving into the apartment.”
Dean has his keys in hand, clinking lightly against the handle on the staff door. He pauses, unwilling to move away from the sweet smile, the gentle encouragement, the firm grip on his upper arm. Except Cas is already releasing him, dropping his hand. And Dean doesn’t even think about it consciously, just catches that callused palm in his own and gives the fingers a good squeeze. “ Thanks, Cas. I’ll text you later. If that’s okay?”
“ She looks like maybe a PA? Or part of his PR team?” Charlie guesses, her eyes flicking across the credits along the bottom of each photo. “ Yep. “ Nicholas Adler shares a joke with his personal assistant, Ruby Cortese.”” She points to a photo of just the two in question, Ruby smiling as Nicholas chuckles. “ And again. Gross.”
When Dean takes the stage an inordinate amount of catcalls and wolf whistles follow him and he flips off Ed and Harry in the kitchen window. The music starts up and he closes his eyes for a moment to feel the rise before the first line. Dean loves singing. He’s not big on the performing aspect of it, but he works the crowd with his usual playfulness, winking at Stan and blowing kisses to Jess. By the end everyone has their phone out, screens glowing, and singing along. Benny appears at the end, slapping him on the back for the good job and calling a break so no one has to follow his stellar performance.
“ What time is it?”
, his mind supplies, but he doesn’t get a closer look because Dean is pulling the clean shirt over his head and blocking the very tempting view thank the Good Lord in Heaven. Castiel is happily distracted by the new scrub design. “ I like the unicorns.”
He’s off the reference desk for the remainder of his afternoon because Benjamina is working with a practicum student, Dorothy Baum. And Charlie has been hanging out all day at the adult desk, making it a bit crowded for Castiel.
Out of everything that happened, the deal with his tattoos had been the most exhausting. After Castiel had left with the kids, Sam had laughed about the Dory tattoo, ribbing Dean about how he’d told Sam he’d gotten it during a Disney induced drunken weekend, five years ago. Dean didn’t have to look at Cain to see the older man mentally doing the math and realizing the significance of the determined little fish inked onto Dean’s arm. Dean had walked Cain to his Jeep and Cain had given Dean a nice long hug and said he was proud of him and Dean had nearly busted out crying right then and there.
Dean’s about to just invite himself in for a brief half hour, when Gabe waves his brother’s words away with a dismissive hand. “ Your boy toy has a warm bed literally within hollerin’ distance. I’ve got the kids, you go get laid.”
Dean watches from the couch, pants undone, cock swollen under lacy pink microfiber - though it is quickly deflating under the stress of the moment- both stunned and impressed by the quick turnaround of events. With an amused smile on his face, he bobs his head once. “ I’ll be here.”
The lovely member in his hand has fully softened and Dean carefully removes his touch from sensitive flesh. A little gasp falls from Cas’  lips, sending spikes of heat to Dean’s groin. He untangles his t-shirt from the jumble of clothes on the couch, but Cas spots him and stretches for the plastic box of baby wipes on the window sill behind the couch.
There’s a long moment and they just look across the table, drinking each other in, which should be creepy but Dean kinda likes the frankness of it. He’s never had to hide from Cain, never could hide from Cain. And now, it's just two friends cataloguing the differences, physical and otherwise.
He is looking at the stars on the ceiling. Thinking about things.
At the very top, sent just a few minutes ago, is an email from
He blames that for the sudden urge to dance with Dean. Blames it for following through on the urge. The next video starts, much slower than the previous song. Like Fate is playing her part in this stupid little situation of theirs. Castiel doesn’t recognize this song at all, but Dean obviously does, judging by the soft expression on his face. There are memories there, Castiel is certain. Pleasant and bittersweet and not to be prodded at the moment.
“ And there were two bottom drawers so I just checked them both and then Aunt Meg came running in and when I asked about the collars she said they were thinking about getting a puppy and I was just wondering if maybe you were going to give them a puppy for Christmas.”
He can’t blame Cas for this. Won’t blame Cas. It’s not Cas’ fault he pushes nearly all of Dean’s buttons. That just thinking about the man brings a warm smile to Dean’s face. Watching Cas laugh as he swings Jack around in his arms or gives Claire a piggy back ride makes Dean feel all gooey inside. But all these weird feelings are on Dean, not Cas, and Dean sure as hell isn’t entertaining the idea of anything more than a nice neighborly friendship out of this whole situation. Despite his family and friends’ well intentioned interference.
Castiel should avert his gaze. Seriously he just met Dean today (no matter what his faulty brain has been trying to tell him), and shouldn’t be gawking over his toddler’s head at the smooth expanse of freckled skin, faint marks of a farmer’s tan on his upper arms and circling his neck. The slightest little pudge at his midsection that makes Castiel want to poke it with his finger before sucking a mark and what in the name of all that’s holy is he doing?! So caught up in his inappropriate lusty thoughts, he nearly misses the darks line and blotches of color on Dean’s pale skin.
Alex pops in this time, long braid swinging over her shoulder. “ Hey, Dean. Dr Jess said you promised to cover her lunch this morning.”
Claire carefully leans toward Dean to see his phone. Drawn by the movement, Jack leaves off petting his sweater and also maneuvers over Dean’s lap. Dean catches him before the boy can inflict another hit to his groin, lifting him bodily and holding him in the air as he asks, “ Claire, scoot over so you can sit together.”
Then there’s a quick detour to the freezer in the breakroom where Dean grabs a bright red Pedialyte popsicle, cutting the end off for convenience's sake. Alex, again, throws him an eye roll and knowing smirk that Dean returns with gusto, pointing the popsicle at her menacingly. The popsicle is still braced outward in his hand as he swings the door open and stabs it directly into a firm chest, just shy of Jack’s face. Dean startles and jerks back, clutching the treat to his own chest.“ Oh, crap! I am so sorry!”
Rowena is a master storyteller and her subversive retelling of Hansel and Gretel with the witch as the victim of two horribly rude children (who are burned alive in the oven instead of the witch) is both humorous and eerily relatable. She reads a more traditional storybook,
Three chaotic games of Spongebob Monopoly later (Claire is a cold calculating player and wins every round), the kids are clean and asleep, each giving Dean a final extra big birthday hug before being led off to their bedroom, while Dean picks a movie above a PG rating.
Sam nods, his beer bottle tapping lightly against his outer thigh. “ Nicholas Adler. He named his talent agency
Dean doubts that, but attempts some Sam-level comfort. “ You wanna talk about it?”
I hope I haven’t gone too far to be forgiven. Your friendship means everything to me.
“ Okay, I do enjoy Jory John’s work. The humor is very relatable.”
Blue eyes.
“ Biah-erkenstock.” Dean catches himself and glances guiltily at Castiel.
Jack is warm and dry and just a little sleepy and he loves Daddy and he loves Dean and they don’t even get mad at him when he toots under the blankets.
“ That means he’s not cute.” Claire confirms, squeezing between her father and Jack’s feet hanging off the couch. “ But, he’ll grow out of it. Right, Dean?”
He hefts himself up from the couch, again re-adjusting his hold on Jack who has completely given up the ghost, so to speak, his head lolling bonelessly on Castiel’s shoulder. The toddler is still recovering, so Castiel doesn’t let the easy bedtime bother him too much. “ Claire?” He waits until the girl looks up from her next story selection before continuing. “ I’m going to put Jack to bed. Go ahead and get ready for your bath.”
“ Looking forward to it, Meg
“ You’re important to me, Cas. You and the kids.”  Dean’s cheek heats up against Castiel’s. There’s a slight rub of stubble, then Dean pulls away and clears his throat. “ And I want to help.”
Even faked for humorous effect, Dean’s puppy eyes are a sight to behold and Castiel catches himself staring a moment too long. “ Only if you let us bring brownies. Claire is actually a rather good baker.”
“ That’s what she said.” Cas snickers, stumbling along.
“ I’m a big girl!” Claire’s hand shoots up as though begging for the teacher’s attention.
It’s fun watching the white paper turn yellow.
“ Drunk you is sweary. I like.”
“ Honestly, you seemed so embarrassed about what you did remember of that night. I didn’t want to make it worse.” Cain raises a brow and quirks his lips.
Cain takes it in stride, coming in to let the door shut behind him, and squatting down to be on level with the girl. “ I know and I completely understand. Thank you for your very prompt response.” His big paw carefully envelopes Claire’s tiny mitt and gives a very business like shake.
Another careful roll.
I have no right to initiate anything between us after rejecting you that first time.  I know my actions afterwards have, at times, been hypocritical at best, and could possibly be considered harassment even. And it is certainly understandable if your feelings have changed since that night in September.
Many thanks to everyone who reads, kudos, or comments!!!
“ Believe we will.” Cas steps back and eases onto the couch, careful not to disturb the other occupants. Claire has decided to keep standing, only moving to lean over the couch arm on the other side of Dean.
It takes Castiel a moment to visualize the spot, then frowns. “ Those are holly bushes. Is that why you’ve been so scratched up this summer?”
After about thirty feet they reach their destination, namely the bottom of Cas’ driveway. Where, naturally, Claire demands her turn. Dean catches sight of Cas looking out the window, face drawn tight. Dean doesn’t understand why the man seems so uncomfortable in the Impala. But he can’t think about it right now, because Jack and Claire are changing places - without fighting, amazingly enough- and Dean has to put the bench seat back another inch so the girl isn’t right on top of the wheel. She flops into his lap and Dean,
“ Not til October.” Dean takes another bite of croissant and slurps his coffee. He’s already feeling hungrier. “ I’ve got til then to find an apartment. I mean, best case scenario,  I’m out before the baby’s born so I’m not crashing on the couch and I can actually get some sleep. “ He snickers around another buttery mouthful. “ Otherwise I have the feeling I’ll end up being the night nanny.”  When Dean looks up from licking his fingers, he finds Cain deep in thought. He worries, briefly, if maybe the finger licking went too far. It hadn’t been intentional.
A beat, then Dean is snorting with laughter, curled around Cas’ body as he shakes with unbridled glee. This. This is what he’s missed in recent years with his infrequent random hook-ups. This easy intimacy, comforting touches and unguarded laughter. Cas’ big hands smooth over his hips, bringing Dean’s attention back to the task at hand. One more breath, stuttering softly through one last chuckle. He gently butts his forehead against the other man’s and plants a grinning kiss on his cheek. “ Okay, Mr. Standup. Stop distracting me.”
“ Dean, too!” Claire reminds him.
Just coffee and catching up and isn’t that exactly what Dean wanted when they were face to face?
They give their last waves and exit the building, stepping out into the chilly air. Claire shakes her hair from her face. “ When he does, will you tell him we have something for the new baby?”
and Dean closes his mouth with a snap and turns his attention back to the road. He finally manages to bite off a quiet, “ No’sir,” before falling silent again. A tension headache has already formed behind his temples, only growing worse with the way he’s constantly clenching his jaw shut.
The phone rings once before Gabriel’s cheerfully exasperated voice answers. “ Yes, we’re still on schedule. Don’t get your panties in a twist.”
“ Behave or I’ll make you watch Barney.” Dean jokes behind him.
Castiel has learned there’s no way to deflect. He accepts the embrace and pats the young man’s back. “ I’m fine, thank you, Garth.” He smells of cheap laundry detergent and apple juice. It’s oddly comforting.
Castiel doesn’t have an answer, because she’s right. His fingertips dig slightly into the upholstered arms of the chair. There’s nothing he can do to keep her from coming back. It’s a public space and she hasn’t publicly caused any disruption.
“ Dr. Jess!”
So Dean texts Cain to ask if he can bring over some apple pie in exchange for some venison chili and Cain quickly replies with an affirmative.
And when you smile.
“ What’s your favorite flower?” Claire is not done. “ So Dad can get them for you.”
Cas turns his head toward Dean, blindly searching out his mouth. Dean takes pity on him and aligns their mouths together for a kiss, slow and deep. Sated. At least on Cas’ part. Dean does his best to keep his own enthusiasm reigned in. This is about Cas right now and he can take care of himself in a few minutes or even wait til he gets home tomorrow if need be.
“ It’s plaid.” Sam pulls his own bitch face.
Claire carefully places the llama into the front of her Moana top, trapping it firmly against her chest. The safest place possible. Then she takes Jack’s hand and turns to her father. “ We have to trick-or-treat before they close, Dad.”
“ Uh, sure.” Dean has his own cookie resting on his lower lip, about to take a bite. He still seems a bit confused. “ I’ll ask the kids what they want to watch. ”
Charlie glances up at him in confusion, but nods and they both veer right to enter her area of the far end of the workroom. Charlie slumps down into her desk chair and scoots over enough for Castiel to pull one of the nearby step stools next to her. She logs into her computer, shaking out her hands and wrists as she waits for the desktop to load. Getting in the zone. “ So, what’s the problem?”
“ D-da...daddy?” Claire’s tearful voice interrupts the heated quiet.
Jack laughs and points. “ Puppy! Gahf puppy!”
“ No one would blame you if you had, Castiel. And still desiring it now, I don’t know anyone who would blame you for that, either.”  Cain squeezes Castiel’s shoulder, warm and firm.  “ But I also think if you had, you would not be the same man right now. The man the children need and love.”
It’s a split second decision. Castiel has no idea how long he has before a gas tank blows or he’s overcome by the fumes. If he can get the other victim out quickly, then he can return to help this man. Castiel gets to his feet and sprints around to the other side of the car that is pinned beneath the tanker. The analytical part of his brain runs through a scenario to account for the strange position: initial strike on passenger side, momentum flipped car upside down, tanker balanced on driver’s side just barely.
“ Din?” Jack frowns, then tries again. “ Din.” A pudgy finger pokes Dean in the chest, then Jack points at himself, nearly going cross-eyed trying to look down at his finger. “ Dat .”
Dean leaves the bag from Cain’s table for last, eyeing it on the counter as he puts away his other purchases and begins pulling things from the kitchen shelves to make a blackberry cobbler.
“ I know what you mean.” Dean smiles just as softly back and reclaims his seat on the other end of the couch. Jack immediately climbs into his lap. “ Okay, buddy. Definitely the jealous type.” He puts Jack in a loose headlock and rocks him side to side. “ So what are y’all doing for Christmas this year?”
. Just the thought makes him all gooey inside.
“ Awesome!” Dean is beaming now, hands pulled from his pockets to swing easily at his sides. “ So, uh, I’ll let you go check on the kiddos and I’ll see you Sunday.”
“ What, Gabriel?”
“ No! I wouldn’t do that! There’s simply been a few times where my resolve was tested by circumstances beyond my control and--.”
the way like it was before.
Jack abandons his toys near the basket across the room and wanders over to watch the hairstyling process, mesmerized by Castiel’s fingers deftly weaving the long strands together. Once Castiel is finished with Claire’s braids, he notices his second child sitting nearby, tugging on his own short hair in confusion. The moment Claire vacates her spot on the floor, Jack flops down into it, staring beseechingly up at his father. “ Baid, Daddy.”
Which is okay because they’re still gonna be friends. He’s still gonna protect those damn kids like they’re his own.
“ Dance, Daddy!” Claire echoes.
“ And I tried not to stress too much,” Cas gives a rueful smirk. “ Though I admit I am quickly becoming a great admirer of Mary Berry’s recipes.”
Dean steps forward because he’s been silently listening in to the entire conversation, letting his thoughts settle before he blurts out something stupid like he tends to do. Dean is completely caught up in that intense blue stare when he opens his mouth and, “ I’m glad you live here!” falls out.
Dean hasn’t even closed his phone before John is putting in his two cents. “ Your brother tryin’ ta get out of seein’ me?” His mouth is twisted into a rueful grin. Patronizing. Fucking condescending, as always.
That little gesture seems to snap Cas from whatever inner thought processes had him frozen up. There’s that slump of shoulders, a relaxing of his entire stance as he happily accepts Sam’s hand in a firm shake. “ We’ve been well, Sam. Busy, but well. Thank you.” There’s a small but genuine looking smile on his face as he gently corrects. “ And, please, call me Castiel. What you did for us…”  Cas trails off, at a loss for words.
Castiel can hear Dean lick his lips in that nervous habit of his before he speaks. “ Whatcha wanna talk ‘bout?”  Dean’s fingers slip upward until they curl into the palm of Castiel’s hand.
“ No.” Castiel puts on the stern expression he uses on unruly library patrons. “ Meg, leave. Now.”
But now Jack is getting cold. He wants his pajamas and blankets.
“ I shouldn’t dismiss it, but honestly, I can’t think of anyone here who’d gain anything from it.”
“ That’s not an answer, Clarence.”
“ Holy shit.” Dean can’t get gather up a more intelligent response. Other than the predictable, “ What happened?”
“ Dad, I think Dr. Jess is moving in!” Claire sounds as excited Jack.
Many thanks to everyone who reads, kudos, and comments!!!!
Castiel resists the urge to snuggle the sleepy man and lets the smile spread across his face as he angles the phone so Dean can watch the video of Gabriel, Claire, and Jack destroying Castiel’s kitchen in their efforts to make breakfast.
This is nice.
“ I can hold him, Dean.” Cas instantly offers.
Many thanks to everyone who reads., kudos, and comments!!!
Before Castiel can explore all the feelings that declaration fills him with, Claire’s voice bellows through the house, “ Dean’s here!”
After returning from the zoo and a luxurious two hour nap, the children had begged to play on the slip-and-slide. It had happily whiled away the afternoon and evening. With the children immersed in a nature show Netflix binge, Castiel had come outside to pick up the plastic sheeting and hose, the toys strewn about the front yard. One of Jack’s many bouncy balls escapes his hold, rolling down the hill and curving down the drive toward Dean’s side of the house. Castiel gives chase before it gets too far ahead of him, snatching it up as he skids to a halt in front of Dean’s garage door. Which suddenly slides open to reveal Dean and the beautiful classic car that has triggered his flashback.
Thinking of Sam summons him, the tall man suddenly looming over him in all his gaudy New Year glory. The tinseled sunglasses reflect Dean’s frown when he looks up. Sam pushes them up to his wide forehead, hazel eyes concerned, joy falling from his face to be replaced with worry. “ Dean? Everything okay?”
for no reason Castiel can see. There are at least three currently ongoing, the oldest has been making its rounds for five months. He’s fairly certain Aaron and Ash are the ones responsible for its longevity. Castiel deletes them out of hand; anything important will get back to him through the grapevine or Garth. There’s a schedule change request from one of the pages, Hael, due to class conflicts. Two are from Zachariah that he won’t even bother to open until tomorrow. Rowena has sent him- and Garth and Charlie according to the details- more photos of her holiday in Romania. A staff memo from Mayor Adler. A reminder about Labor Day closings. A reminder about the carpet cleaning next week.
When he lifts his head, Dean is wide eyed, obvious even in the darkness. Castiel moves his other hand to gently cup Dean’s cheek, thumb rasping quietly over the stubble. “ I need you to know that I’m here for you, too. That you are just as important to me as Claire and Jack, as any of my family. I never want you to feel like an afterthought, or feel that you can’t share your difficulties with me because you believe they aren’t comparable to mine.”
Garth’s side is an explosion of color and textures. It reminds Castiel a bit of a toy shop’s backroom. Stacks of papers and folders in no perceivable order, sheets of stickers poking out, various office supplies scattered everywhere but the carpet. In the spaces in between, games and toys for children’s programming, games and toys that are personal to Garth. And occupying the place of honor next to his laptop, slipped over a latex hand-shaped sex toy given as a gag gift last Christmas, is Garth’s beloved sock puppet, Mr. Fizzles.
Dean grins down at the man, his hands busy fishing stiff flesh through the slit in the bright orange briefs. And there’s another surprising discovery when he combs his fingers through the wild bush of hair at the root.  “ Crap. How are your pubes so soft?” Dean is genuinely impressed, practically forgetting the hard cock nearby in favor of petting the silky hair. He does some occasional manscaping, sure, keeping things neatly trimmed, but the hair is still pretty coarse.
“ You’d tell him.” Castiel confirms. “ But I just can’t… I don’t think I can deal with that. Right now.”
“ Nope.”
“ I wouldn’t do that to you, Dean.” Jess replies, one leg swinging off the couch. “ Only the last two times.”
After a few more reassurances from Cain and a resigned acceptance from Castiel, the younger man gets back in the car, purposefully numb after the rush of strong emotions. A bag of red and green colored honey candy sits on the passenger seat, Cain’s quasi-fabricated excuse for seeing him. Castiel barely remembers the drive back to the house and only snaps out of it when he sees Dean’s broad figure in the open doorway, washed out in the bright lights. Waiting for him.
Jess gives an epic eye roll then nails Sam with another stern glare. “ You know why.”
She leaps onto the couch and throws her arms around Dean’s neck, just like her brother, rubbing her nose against his beard. “ Goodnight, Dean!” It’s practically a shout so close to his ear.
Dean instantly hates it. Its mouth is open in a toothy roar, its cartoony brows drawn inward in an angry expression. Not something he thinks Jack would particularly like, despite his many dinosaur and dragon toys, which speaks to how much Nicholas Adler doesn’t know his child. “ Anything else inside the box? A card or note, or something?”
, wondering how dominant the Kline traits are that she and Jack can both be so solidly built sharing less than a quarter of their genetics. “ Okay, this is the hard part. Check your mirrors. And--” He helps her shift into
“ It was. I really like Uncle Gabe. He always has the best food.”
“ Claire, please!” Cas struggles with the toddler in his grasp, backing up enough to keep Jack from kicking the car again- or Claire- and to get a better look at the abused door below. “ I don’t see any marks, other than dirt, but I’ll--”
“ Yesh,” Dean answers confidently with his own mouth full of ice cream.
Without any further mishap, they arrive back at the entrance. Ezekiel, from circulation, has taken over Dean’s spot at the front desk. His Boris Karloff era Frankenstein’s Creature is very imposing and only the oldest trick-or-treaters approach without encouragement from their chaperones.
He completely forgot! How the
Where he finds everyone already seated at the table, scarf and crown safely placed on the counter. Claire, however, has opted to wear her sunglasses pushed to the top of her head where they tangle in her messy bun. It’s not a bad job on Gabriel’s part.
“ God, you know it.” Dean laughs quietly, but it’s steady and light. “ Kid’s got me wrapped around his little finger. Claire, too.”
The woman nods in agreement, but remains silent as she continues to open and close emails, seemingly at random. After a few moments, she pulls out her personal laptop and boots it up, connecting it to the work desktop. Then she selects a dozen emails and her fingers fly quickly over the laptop keys. The screen fills with pop-ups and text scrolling by at an alarming rate. It means nothing to Castiel, but Charlie obviously sees something noteworthy because she taps rapid fire for several seconds and everything suddenly comes to a halt. She points to the screen, eyes flicking over the information displayed. Mouth screwing up in disbelief. “ It’s coming from inside the house?”
And Meg really isn’t helping, being all rational and whatnot. “ I’ve known you a long time, Castiel, and I’ve
!” Dean’s voice echoes through the house, followed by the children’s laughter.
Castiel blinks. What in God’s name is he doing?
“ Dat Fafa.” Jack taps the book and looks up at Dean for acknowledgment.
“ Meg Masters. Psych RN, dominatrix, fair cook. Clarence’s best friend.” She gets right in Dean’s space and holds out her hand. Castiel knows this look, this little game. Intimidation. Meg’s favorite.
“ So I phoned in the antibiotic prescription to the pharmacy you have on file and they should have them ready within an hour. Basic amoxicillin, a seven day supply to make sure we get rid of it for good. Lots of fluids and rest. He’ll be good as new in no time.” Dean turns back around (slowly this time, extra cautious of where Castiel is in the room).
By the time the end credits are rolling and Claire is belting out
Claire pops out from behind Cas, her stocky little body pressed against the passenger side door, arms draped through the open window. Completely unruffled by her brother’s fit. Her expression is just as curious and hopeful as Dean imagines Jack’s was only a few moments ago. “ Hey, where are you going? Are you going to eat? Are you going somewhere with rolls?”
“ On it.” Aaron fiddles with his phone for a moment. “ Let’s see what dark past she’s hiding. Or not hiding. Wow.” He tilts his phone for the others to see the Instagram photos for Ruby G. Cortese.
Clang of the grill lid, pop and hiss, and suddenly there’s a cold bottle of beer nudging against his elbow. Castiel looks down at the freshly opened bottle, then up at Dean.
That actually sounds like a good idea. Not the part about shagging after the children are in bed, though maybe some making out? And not Gabriel’s catering contacts, but most places offer online ordering and carry-out nowadays. Castiel will keep it in mind. He huffs suddenly, not quite laughter, but easy and lighthearted. “ I’m getting ahead of myself, even without your encouragement. Dean hasn’t agreed to anything yet.”
“ And baby smooth cheeks.” Sam is sitting in the recliner near the windows, bottle feeding Alex. “ Okay, it’s weird seeing you without the beard, man.”  He frowns at Dean’s barely stubbled chin.
“ Dean? Will you take the possible flu in room three?” Dr. Moseley curves her hand over Dean’s shoulder, squeezing gently.
Dean feels his heart breaking the tiniest bit and gets his arm around the little girl. He squeezes Claire against his side. “ I miss my mom, too. And my dad. We’ll always miss them, but we know that they love us and that they’re proud of us. Right?”
There’d been the customary texts from friends and family. Missouri brought mint chocolate cupcakes to the clinic and Alex and Stan filled his office with black balloons. Cas invited him over for a quiet Official Birthday dinner of homemade meatloaf, mashed potatoes, roasted broccoli, and a surprise birthday treat.
So, life often gets in the way so I will, unfortunately, be updating every other Monday instead of each week. Thanks to everyone who reads, kudos, and comments!!!!
“ No kids tonight. If you want.” Dean offers, putting the t-shirt back into its drawer.
“ So FYI, Jack is the perfect size to scrape the wet socks off the roof of the washer drum.” Dean comes back into the living room, Jack tossed over his shoulder like a bag of wiggly potatoes. “ Oh, is he asleep?” He lowers his voice when he spots Alex curled against Cas.
“ Well, it’s there, believe me.”
Happy New Year, Dean! :D
Many thanks to everyone who reads, kudos, and comments!!!
Claire and Jack both squeal in response. Even Alex sputters and grunts at the commotion.
Castiel laughs, feeling flushed himself. He watches the children whirl around for a few moments. The song winds down and Claire and Jack fall dramatically onto the floor, chests heaving, laughing between huge breaths. Their unbridled joy is contagious.
. Not too loudly, but with your whole heart.”
Gabriel’s whine becomes more high pitched and annoying. “ Kali passed by me on the way out today and the ice in her eyes nearly froze my balls off! I can’t face that again!”
Many many thanks to everyone who reads, kudos, and comments! Y'all are awesome!!!
Castiel watches as the younger man sets an enthusiastic Jack on the floor, careful to keep his crown on and Jack’s new headscarf in place. Dean smiles when he notices Castiel watching, already following behind Jack, lifting a hand to brush against the small of Castiel’s back, pressing a light kiss to the side of his neck as he passes by. The grin on Castiel’s face is not going anywhere anytime soon.
Rowena has the good graces to look- falsely- offended. “ Of course not! That’s against policy.” She points him down the hall toward the next station at the adult reference desk, where Aaron is handing out candy- dressed as a random Hufflepuff- as Benjamina - in head to toe Slytherin garb- helps an older patron with their Kindle. “ However, I
It’s quiet again, the minutes stretching out as they rest. Castiel is reasonably certain Dean’s eyes have been closed for some time. Finally sleeping, he expects. So he startles slightly when Dean’s rough whisper disturbs the silence. “ Hey, Cas?”
“ Dean is more than his looks.” Castiel frowns at her, pushing further into the cushions. “ He’s funny and kind and--”
“ You’d have to ask Sam.” Dean gives a sly smile.
“ That’s what Nurse Alex told Kaia and Patience and she’s a nurse so she knows ‘bout that stuff.” Claire explains, nonchalantly shoveling more scrambled eggs into her mouth, not bothering to swallow before nailing Dean with, “ An’yer a pedition s’you shoul’know, too.” A few bits of egg drop onto her plate.
But Meg is apparently sick and Castiel knows the woman must be very ill to cancel an obligation. In college, she had once shown up to their bowling league with two wrist casts and a hefty dose of Vicodin. Most likely, whatever ails Meg is contagious; as a healthcare employee, Meg would never expose the vulnerable to contagion. He sends back, <<
Dean approaches the table and lets her sound it out, nodding his consent for her to touch Dory to see if the tattoo ,”feels different”. She’s disappointed that it doesn’t. Then her attention is snatched by the design above Dory. “ Is that your hand?”
. He lingers on the page for long moments, then gets a grip and starts looking through the candles.
A local phone number closes the message and Dean can feel his heart beating much too fast in his chest. It’s a simple message, very straightforward, without any romantic subtext, and even gives Dean an out.
“ But not here” Jess forces a laugh as soon as she gets a deep breath in. “ And you two are scaring the kids. Calm the frack down.”
Dean watches with no small amount of amusement as the tiny fingers release and disappear just as Cas jogs up to the car and loops an arm around Jack’s middle to lift him up and away. Jack shrieks in protest. Cas bends down to window level. “ Dean, I am so sorry!”
But he has other things to worry about this bright morning. Like what to wear. Which is stupid because Cain has seen him in and out of everything from ratty sweats and undershirts to a full tux in Sam’s wedding pictures. So after pulling everything from his closet and throwing it all haphazardly across the bed, Dean finally chooses a decent pair of dark jeans ( no wear-n-tear tear, natural or artful) and his favorite Batman t-shirt because it's practically become a security blanket by now.
It’s too dim to see, but Castiel is certain their handshake is white knuckling it now.  Also, that’s a really vague thought because his brain is still comprehending Dean as a switch. Not that he thought Dean was a hardcore top or anything. Or that he’s thought about Dean in any type of sexual manner no matter how lush those lips of his are or--
For the next ten hours Dean is in a near constant state of high alert.
Things slowly settle back to normal.
“ Gah pop?” Jack stares into Dean’s soul with his marble blue eyes. “ Pop? Gah gape pop?”
He’ll give himself tonight to pout, to rail against the unfairness of his life and entertain his little fantasy of something more. Except when he gets his hand on his crotch, Dean rubs twice and nothing happens except Dean feels sick to his stomach jerking off to the embattled father of two who’s probably tottering around in their kitchen right now meal prepping Claire’s school lunches and putting Jack’s snacks into little containers decorated with
Which Dean is also fine with. Except it hasn’t happened yet.
Jess wrinkles her nose. “ Why are you up?”
“ Actually, it really is, Clarence,” she counters, stretching her leg and kicking his knee. “ According to the brats the sun shines outta this guy’s ass. And I looked him up on the clinic’s website. If he looks anything like his profile pic then I don't see what’s holding you up.” Meg swings her leg back to her side and tucks it under her opposite thigh. She runs a finger across her lower lip. ” I’m not even into dudes, but I’d make an exception for that mouth of his.”
“ Depends on your bed.”
“ Well…” Charlie stumbles.
“ Not intentionally.” Aaron shrugs and pulls the earbuds free, dropping them on his desk and crossing the workroom to join his coworkers. “ My playlist ended and I caught enough to keep my attention.” He scoots his way behind Castiel’s stool and Charlie’s chair to stand on the other side of her. “ So. Threatening emails from some creepy chick in the library?”
“ Is he hot?”
It’s a fairly quick drive, the Sunday traffic sparse this time of morning. The Starbucks in question is part of a strip mall next to a hotel, so tends to be busy, but not too crowded, though the drive thru is currently wrapped around the building. Dean feels sorry for the window attendant. He parks Baby in a far corner of the small lot, taking a moment to check his phone before exiting the car. There’s one missed text - because Dean absolutely does not text and drive- from Cain, letting Dean know that he’s already in the store and at a table.
“ No! That’s not what I mean and you know it!”
“ Thank goodness,” Castiel murmurs behind him.
He numbly locks up, arms the security system, and drops the ball onto the kitchen table. How could this have happened? Seriously, what kind of fucked up fate could have drawn them together in such a twisted way? Castiel sits heavily in the kitchen chair and puts his head in his hands, mind roaring with doubts.
He sets his phone down and removes his earbuds, intent on being productive even if he’s not quite feeling it today. He hasn’t checked his work email since this morning and decides it will be a good way to pass a few minutes. The program slowly comes to life on his computer, allowing him to enter his username and password after several stalled attempts.
Dean makes sure Jack keeps away from the accordion door when he opens it, protecting those little fingers from a severe pinch, exposing the stacked washer and dryer. “ Washer.” He taps the lower door. “ Dryer.” Dean slaps the glass of the upper door. He cancels the washer’s alarm before it can sound again and pulls open the porthole-esque door. “ So…” Dean quirks a thoughtful frown. “ How we gonna do this?”
Castiel squeezes firmly and smiles back, hoping it’s not too gummy like he gets when overexcited. “ Likewise, Dean.”
“ Why do they care what she dresses like?” Claire seems genuinely confused.
Dean is not ready for this.
“ Oh, we’ve been getting along like a house afire. Right, E-Z baby?” Pamela grins sideways at her lover as she winks at Dean.
Unwilling to continue with the duo’s increasingly friendly barbs, Castiel keeps his mouth shut and opens Meg’s driver side door. She boops his nose and he hugs her one-armed. “ Be safe on the way home.”
“ No more emails.”
“ So, if she isn’t
“ I realize you want to impress the guy, but first, he’s already head over heels for ya. And second, you’re both homebodies, if you hadn’t noticed.”
know I have a laundry list of reasons why I shouldn’t become involved with anyone right now.”
“ Nothing, but Mr. Cain is here.” Claire points back down the hall toward the kitchen.
Once they get off the elevator in the lobby, Dean sprints ahead with the bags to bring Baby around to the pick-up point. It’s quick work to stow all the gear in the trunk, drop the diaper bag next to the car seat, and exit the parking lot. He hears Nurse Clif’s  appreciative whistle when he pulls up to the curb a minute later. “ Beautiful machine, man.”
next time.” Cas gives a long suffering sigh as he whispers to Dean. “ I’m completely over Thunder McQueen.”
He moves his kisses along the sharp jawline, speaking the words into Dean’s skin. “ You are so
For the whole hour, Dean has been acutely aware of the blurry little face watching him in the window. Halfway through, it was joined by a smaller face with shorter darker gold curls.
“ Dad’s hair is nice, too,” Claire points out very helpfully. “ I like how it sticks up without any fancy stuff.”
“ Now?”
“ But what are you doing Christmas Day?” Claire beats Castiel to the question he’s most curious about.
Playing has made him ten minutes late and Sam is standing outside near the front door when Dean pulls into the parking lot. Sam looks up from his phone, waving at Dean absently as he continues his conversation that looks work related and now Dean knows why Sam is taking it outside; Jess doesn’t do anything other than work emergencies outside the office. Dean pulls into his usual spot in a far corner, where he can see Baby through the windows but she’s out of the way of most of the traffic. He locks her up and circles around to check out the damage to the passenger door. Cas was right, Dean finding nothing but dirt when he swipes his fingers over the marks. He passes by his brother on his way inside, debating whether or not he should tell Jess about his impromptu client meeting in the lot.
Cas, wrapped tightly against the cold, standing at the top of his drive next to the Pimpmobile.
Dean swallows throat dry. He swallows again and turns to grab his water bottle from the desk behind him. “ But it looks good on you.”
“ And I honestly thought it’d be dinner and just some over-the-clothes action tonight.”
Castiel realizes his hands are clenched into fists at his side only when Cain puts the flame colored abomination back into the box and places a hand on his elbow. Squeezing gently. Castiel releases the air held hostage in his tightened chest and forces his hands to relax, shoving them into the pockets of his trench coat to fiddle with the loose threads on the inner seams. He begins twisting one around the tip of his index finger.
“ Meg!”
kissing him back either, so Dean feels it’s a fair question.
The monitor is still on its one-way function and Dean can clearly hear Cas’ soft rumbling voice comforting Claire’s squeaky sniffling.
“ She’s come to the adult desk a couple times to ask about programming, flirted a bit. I mean, I didn’t get any bad vibes from her, but I didn’t exactly get good vibes, either. I figured she just wasn’t my type.” She scrunches her face up.
That never really occurred to Dean before, and by god it should have. “ Did… did you know that Sam was my brother?” Cain had to have seen Sam with Jess before, lugging around the rolling cart and drooling over jarred granola.
Castiel is staring, confused, when another familiar face appears at the bottom of the stone steps on the far side of the trailer. A faded brown t-shirt with a bar logo and a green ball cap worn backwards. Ripped jeans hanging loosely off the bowed legs Castiel didn’t notice before but now can’t stop staring at. “ Dean?”
But then, there’d been a split second of recognition on Castiel’s part and for the life of him he can’t imagine where he would have seen someone as gorgeous as this man and not have a perfectly clear memory of it. Even in passing. But still, something familiar niggled at the back of his mind, his little inner voice clearing its throat pointedly. And then Jack had pushed his wet nose against Castiel’s bare throat and reminded him that he had more pressing matters than remembering when and where- if at all-he saw this Sexy Lumberjack.
Besides, they have plenty of time.
He’s anxiously drumming his fingers on the steering wheel as he pulls through the open gate, barely letting it clang shut behind him before driving much too fast down the gravel road toward the main house. A few tense minutes later, Dean edges around the bend and spots a lone figure exiting Cas’ side of the house under the security lights of the carport.  It steps down into the drive as Dean pulls closer and he can make out the dark unruly hair poking out of the top of the autumnal colored afghan Cas keeps on the couch in the den.
“ But being with him makes the stress of everything else a whole helluva lot better, doesn’t it?” Gabriel shrugs when Castiel doesn’t respond immediately, and continues wrapping the Ninja Turtle. “ I’m just saying, I don’t think
Families slowly exit the story room until the last child turns away from Rowena with a wave and Jack seizes his chance. “ Tissies, ‘Weena!” He flings himself against her side and performs a perfect
Castiel forces himself to swallow, to inhale and exhale quietly and steadily. It could be nothing. Except it’s his Saturday shift, and he always treats himself to the Starbucks across the street for breakfast. And, yes, he’d gone a little overboard with the cream today because he’d been distracted by thoughts of the attractive nurse practitioner. It’s nothing. Just a coincidence. Castiel stares at the simple line in the message for a full two minutes before opening his trash inbox and pulling up the previous emails from
“ Night Ranger.” Because
Claire and Jack talk about their favorite parts of the movie as Castiel listens in and occasionally adds his own unpopular opinion on the Swedish Chef being the most underrated muppet of all time.
Cain nearly bursts out laughing, but manages a few coughs instead. Castiel rolls his eyes and shakes his head. “ What have you been using as a lair? It’s all locked up. And you better not have been sneaking inside, young lady.”
Castiel shakes his head, unintentionally widening the space between them to keep from headbutting the taller man. “ No, Dean. That’s too much. You’re right next door, we’ll be fine--”
“ Nothing’s a sure thing, Castiel.” Rowena sighs lightly, smiling at the little group across the room. “ And life’s too short and carpe diem and all that rot.”
“ You know, I think it’s more than that.” Charlie tilts her head in thought. “ Look at how her hand is on his arm. And they’re really close when they seriously don’t need to be.”
Castiel continues to watch Dean in his right peripheral, the children taking up most of his left. He can smell the man’s aftershave, a hint of citrus under the charcoal smoke and sizzling meat. Castiel inhales deeply, but slowly, not wanting to get caught.  Jack runs shrieking by the patio, corn husk doll waving frantically in his hand. Claire is jogging after him, hands raised like paws, growling and laughing and they both dramatically fall over and tumble back down the hill.
Cain smiles gently at him- god, so his fucking type- and opens the Jeep door. “ I’ll speak with my other tenant and tidy up the apartment.”
Amused it is.
and disgustingly cute together. They even made a Zero from an old white sheet and clown nose to artfully drape over Jess’s ginormous belly to make it appear as though she’s holding the ghostly dog.
A growly bear! In Daddy’s room!
He’s comfortable and warm and abnormally content for some reason.
And then Jack has taken it upon himself to make his own introductions and runs straight up to Dean, begging to be picked up. Dean seems happy to oblige and the following interaction has Castiel melting inside and out. When Jack returns to him and demands they follow Claire, Castiel does his best to get himself under control and be a polite guest.
Claire is middle seat driving, ordering Jack to watch out for the hill and the bigger rocks in the gravel and their toys lying far into the grassy yard and nowhere near the drive.
Dean eyes her for a second before shaking the offered hand. His smirk grows. “ Dean Winchester. Pediatrics NP, switch, world class cook. Cas’
, ya know? You’re cute when you’re flustered.” Ruby’s smiles curves sharply, her eyes hooded seductively. “ And hot when you’re pissed. I see why he likes to mess with you.”
Claire’s story continues. “ --and then I saw some chains, like really shiny and--”
Castiel follows Claire and turns right at her left to enter the bedroom the children share. The Batman symbol nightlight is already glowing steadily when he enters the dim room, shuffling forward to Jack’s small bed in the corner. The toddler rail is up and firmly in place, the pale green fitted sheet bare of other bedclothes. As a nervous father, Castiel had fully embraced pajamas and napsacks in lieu of blankets for his youngest charge. Tonight’s summer weight nap-sack is a gaudy undersea print chosen by Claire. Castiel manages to wiggle Jack into the oversized sack and get it zipped up without waking the boy.
The rug is fluffy. And blue. Jack likes blue.
Gabriel nods his head, in thanks or agreement, Castiel isn’t certain, but Claire seems to accept it and turns back to Dean. “ So, you kissed Dad and Dad kissed you back, right?”
“ Awesome.” Dean claps his hands and rubs them together as though he’s about to jump into the world’s best apple pie. Which is what’s in the tote bag, lucky him. Anytime he orders Cain’s
But he wants more. And that scares Castiel almost as much as the thought of losing that potential something. He’s never wanted someone before, not like how he wants Dean.
Castiel glances to the television and indeed there is a music video with a young girl dressed as a bee wandering across the screen through a variety of social situations. The song is vaguely familiar to him, but Dean is apparently a fan.
“ Thanks, buddy. But my dryer is up kinda high… Eh, we’ll make it work.” Dean smiles at the little boy and mentally runs through his toddler-laundry combinations. He can smell the warmth from the washer, the hallway lightly scented like Ocean Breeze.
Castiel sees a matching flinch from Cain at the sight, he and the older man both hunching slightly in empathy.
“ Always be yourself!” Claire concludes.
Dean would roll his eyes, but the ER betting pools were much worse. At least here the currency of the realm is bags of candy to fill up the handwoven basket on the corner of the nurse’s station instead of excessive bodily fluids duty. So far this month, Dean has only had to purchase two bags of Dove dark chocolates, so he considers himself pretty fortunate. He strides forward, grabs a pink marker from his scrub pocket- today’s is black with a Hot Wheels print- and places an oversized check mark under ‘ False Alarm’. “ Let’s do it.” He grins brightly at Jess as she makes her mark beside his and then heads toward exam room three at the end of the hall.
.” He hopes her hand will fall away as he performs the air quotes, but she keeps a firm grasp at his elbow. “ He’s a friend.”
“ Dat luff yoo, Din.” Jack joins the conversation, waffle and strawberry tower mostly eaten, sticky little face beaming. “ Luff yoo, mooaw!” He sends a smacking air kiss in Dean’s direction.
The Something from his nightmare is clawing at his back.
“ Fuckin’ Build-a-Bear?” Dean glances up to Cain, incredulous at the discovery. “ We’re terrorizing people with stuffed animals, now? Christ.”
“ Yep. I think Jack is trying to say
There’s a lot of hugging and kissing going on. He’s even tugged into a few that he mindlessly returns with a fake smile plastered onto his face as his brain spins wildly to come up with a reply to Cas’ confession. He’s staring at the wall of text he’s typed into his messenger, deleted and retyped several times over. But nothing seems right. Nothing is enough. Words suck.
“ It’s good to see you, Dean.”
seems to settle the infant’s cries. Dean shrugs. It coulda been Top 40. He manages one load of laundry before Alex is again demanding his attention to change a full diaper. Then it’s bath time. Or rather, shower time. Dean steps into the shower with a hand towel around Alex’s middle to keep the slippery infant securely in his arms. He washes Alex with a super soft cloth and lavender scented baby wash, careful to keep the shower spray out of his face. Once the baby is clean, Dean wraps him in a dry fluffy towel, places him in his unused baby tub just outside the shower door (clear glass so he can still see), and quickly gets himself washed up.
“ Hope to see you again, when Jack’s feeling better.” Dean flashes one more grin and lets go. He gently tugs Jack’s foot before disappearing from the exam room in a flutter of papers and hint of hand sanitizer.
It's nearly three o'clock that afternoon when Deans phone buzzes, scaring the crap out of him as he dozes in his room, faded copy of
It’s Nicholas Adler.
“ I can stay with the kids.” Dean offers instantly.
” You can’t sing, Daddy.” Claire’s little voice is sleep heavy, but exasperated.
They stay that way until Castiel’s phone buzzes with another message from Gabriel.
Dean laughs and takes it up, putting his hand on his chest as he locks eyes with Jack. “ Just
Castiel can feel the blood in his veins turning to ice, a cold numbing fear sweeping over his body at the sound of Nicholas Adler’s voice. Calling Jack’s name. Calling himself
“ Harassment?”
Stepping backwards, Castiel turns and leads them to his bedroom, stopping to check in on the children once more. All is well, Claire asleep once again and Jack now wedged between a small plush duck and a stuffed cow. An oversized peanut shaped car sponge, a gift from Gabriel and Jack’s favorite lovey, is wrapped tightly in both his little arms. Castiel catches Dean’s gentle smile at the sight and that’s enough to get his blood racing again. This man, who loves these children like his own in such a short amount of time…  Since meeting Dean, Castiel has better understood the appeal of the single-mother-meets-cowboy-with-a-heart-of-gold paperbacks Becky mainlines between her bodice rippers. There is something incredibly sexy about parental attributes.
, I took a picture- the nurses took pics for the insurance companies- down to the tattoo parlor and got this slapped on me.” He laughs again, but brushes his thumb gently down the ink as he lets the sleeve fall back into place.
“ Really?” Charlie begins moving toward his desk.
It lasts another two glorious seconds before Jack leans over Castiel’s arm and throws up all over Dean’s shirt.
Castiel stares over the kitchen bar, watching Gabriel sort through the as yet untampered with gifts for his next victim. It’s a very domestic scene, very heartwarming. His older brother helping with presents, the tree sparkling nearby, quiet jazz instrumentals of Christmas classics playing on the speakers. It still smells like the gingerbread cookies they made after dinner.  Last Christmas, everything had still been too new, too uncertain. He and the children are settled now, the horrible events, not forgotten, but faded. Castiel feels as though he’s going to enjoy this Christmas, despite Nick’s most recent attacks.
“ Cool. We love you, too.” Claire smacks the offending hand away and goes back to her breakfast.
r u flirting?
Dean stumbles a bit, but recovers with a soft smile and, “ That’d be great. Uhm, maybe Sunday? You can bring the kids over and I’ll grill burgers.”
“ I will, promise.” It’s sweet, really, and encouraging. And a little scary, Dean can admit to himself, because he fully believes Gabe is capable of finding a way for Dean to come to some gruesome end if he felt his brother was unhappy in any way. He feels the same way about Sammy. Dean returns Gabe’s brotherly concern with a serious nod, respecting his feelings about the matter, appreciating what he’s doing for Cas.  He watches Cas’ face flow through a series of emotions before it settles into a soft expression, full of gratitude. .
Though Dean knows better.
“ Official introductions.” Dean lets his hand drop so he can clap them together in very much not a nervous gesture. “ This is my kid brother, Sam. And his awesome wife, Jess.” He takes a breath, lets it out in a nervous huff. “ And this is Cain.” He doesn’t add ex, or friend, or man who broke his heart. They know their history now, no need to go into the messier details.
There’s no leisurely clean up of the house and yard with Bobby and Ellen on Thursday. No movie marathons with Sam on Friday. No sleeping in on Saturday. No beer and barbecue on Sunday. No sitting in a rickety lawn chair with his bare feet in a crappy five dollar wading pool watching the neighbor kids shooting off fireworks on the other side of the treeline on Memorial Day.
“ You okay?” Jess frowns up at him, her hands full of wooden toys, highly polished and truly beautiful works of craftsmanship.
Cas nods against Dean’s cheek and slips his hands over the back of his shoulders, participating in the hug. There’s a breath, then Cas pulls back to look up into Dean’s face. “ Why do you think you screwed up?” His expression is so open, so painfully concerned.
Dean checks his own phone, the time surprising him. “ Didn’t even realize we’d been talking so long.” He did actually have some errands to run before heading back to the house. “ Time flies, and all that jazz.”
Everyone from the clinic is there. Gabe and Kali are happily cooing over Alex. Jo and Victor swing by in their police uniforms before their shift, greatly impressing Claire and Jack. Cain and Jess brainstorm new items for Cain’s spring collection. Bobby and Ellen skype for over an hour as people come by to talk with the out-of-state relatives. Cas pulls Dean into the bathroom for a brief, but fantastic, necking session before the Impala shaped cake is brought out, along with an enormous apple pie ablaze with forty candles.
“ Awesome!” Dean returns the gesture and turns his attention to the other Novak-Kline. “ How about you, buddy?” He gives the sticker to Jack, who looks it over very carefully before putting it in his own orange pumpkin. “ You keeping all your candy?”
Castiel can’t stop staring. And he can’t stop the swell of emotions that he thought he’d tamped down at Cain’s earlier. Fear and anger and an utter hopelessness that overwhelms his higher functions. Forcibly ripping his gaze away from Dean’s soft concern, Castiel swallows thickly and gives a silent shrug. Because if he opens his mouth he’s going to break down completely.
“ Was gonna make a dick joke, but I’m trying to be the mature one here, so… Not the point.”
He’s driving his family home and his heart is about to burst from happiness.
His phone buzzes, but Dean leaves it safely in his pocket. He’s compelled to keep moving, to get Baby on the road and get home and face to face with this incredible man that he hasn’t been able to get out of his head since the moment he walked into that damn exam room five months ago.  It seems another lifetime ago. That lonely time Before Cas dimming with each passing day of smiles and laughter. And now… Two amazing kids. Light and warmth in blue eyes.
“ I miss Mom,” Claire sighs next to him. “ Jack’s too little to know his mama, but I miss Aunt Kelly, too. She was really nice.” There are no tears, no sniffles. Just a resignation too complete for someone so young.
“ It’s fucking cute.” Jess has the last word as she plows through the donut holes, using her clean hand to rub the edge of the material between her fingers. “ Wow. Super soft.You want to put it on him now?  He’s finished eating and I know you want to hold him, so I’m not going to feel guilty.” She nails her husband with a very pointed look. “ And neither are you.”
the way down and pushes them onto the floor. His pull-up, too. Naked is easier. Daddy says it’s okay to be naked at home but he has to try pottying not-naked when he’s not at home.
“ Oh, awesome. Thanks, Claire.” The washer’s cycle alarm begins to buzz and Dean frowns at the interruption. “ Okay, big man. Bouncy seat time.” Just saying it causes Alex to fuss. He’s definitely more of a hands-on kinda baby.
“ Be glad I didn’t tell you the author’s story behind it.”
They take Cain’s truck down to the gate, a short drive in the dark. The heat doesn’t even kick in fully by the time they pull up to the metal fencing, parking a bit away from the pillar that contains the interior control box. They remain in the truck, staring out the windshield at the shape hanging on the other side of the gate.
Dean motions for the pizza box in Jess’ lap and the woman hands it over after taking another cheese stick for herself. Dean takes the last slice of Meat Lovers and shoves half into his mouth before biting it off. He’s beat; physically, mentally, emotionally.
“ Cold’s affecting your brain.” Dean would honestly love to just haul Cas up into his arms, bridal style, all knight-in-shining-armor, but he knows his physical limitations and doesn’t want to injure himself, or Cas, on their first real night together. So they jog through the backyard until they reach Dean’s kitchen door where Dean manages to get his key into the lock without too much fumbling.
down the hall to Daddy’s room. The bear growls again. So loud! This is like the song Miss Ambriel sings with him.
Instead, Castiel holds out his hand, expression easy and pressure free. This doesn’t have to be complicated. It can be two friends, dancing in the living room, giving the children some entertainment and a perfect example of how to subvert the strict expectations of toxic masculinity.
Lucky for Dean, Sam dives right into the gossip he was so obviously anxious to share. “ So last July, there was a double murder in East Nashville. Two women bludgeoned to death with a hammer in their home. Obviously not my department, but Abagale Donovan in Criminal decided to leave the firm just so she can handle it personally.”
“ Is it on?” Dean asks from behind the huge flat screen TV.
Claire, sharp as ever, notices immediately. “ Did Dean text you?”
Castiel can hear a brief quiet conversation on the other side of the door, but he’s more focused on getting Jack out of his disgusting clothes. “ It’s okay, Jack. Shhhhh, I know you don’t feel well.” Dean comes back to the bench and puts the discarded clothes into a plastic bag before placing it next to the open bag of wipes Castiel has sitting on the bench. “ Thank you, and again, I’m so sorry about this.”
He makes it through his half shift at the clinic only by the grace of God and two pots of coffee. Luckily his day’s patients are nothing more than a few cases of too much Halloween candy and some standard check-ups. He gets texts from Sam every hour, updating him on Jess and Alex. Each message brings a smile to Dean’s face. Bobby and Ellen have joined the running family group chat, and even Jo has thrown in her own
“ … Thank you?” Dean stares at the girl, then down at the toy perched precariously on his leg. He has no idea what he just witnessed.
But he doesn’t exactly want to be alone either. Because being alone means sitting in his underwear on the couch, watching reruns of
He slams the truck door and watches his breath steam out in the cold dry air. Cain’s reflection moves in the rearview mirror, dropping the bag into the storage box in the bed of the truck, then climbing behind the wheel, door shutting not quite as angrily as Dean’s. He pulls out his phone and types a few moments. “ I’m letting Castiel know it’s safe to come home. Would you mind watching the children for a bit, while he comes to the cabin?” Cain doesn’t look up, but noticeably pauses in his message.
Dean chokes on his swallow, laughter and drops of beer sputtering through his fingers. Castiel doesn’t mean to, but he finds himself grinning at the younger man’s uncontrolled amusement. “ Did I say something funny?”  Surely he hadn’t mischaracterized this Uncle Bobby, not after all he’s heard about him from Dean and Sam.
Another yawn disrupts his thoughts and Dean pushes all thoughts of possible sexy times out of his mind. It’s not happening tonight.
Dean pauses, then very casually drops his sleeve to cover his tattoos.” Nah, just something a friend did for me. You want some more Kool-Aid?” He lifts the jug in her direction.
Castiel shifts Jack against his side, the boy blinking sleepily. “ We’ll see. I thought you wanted a sword and shield like Charlie’s for Christmas.” Misdirection has become one of Castiel’s most valuable parenting techniques.
It’s late summer, so there are the usual stalls filled to the brim with peaches and tomatoes and blackberries. And the random early pumpkin and squash that Jess is intent on buying up to use as decorations for the clinic. There are other things, of course, from potted mums to every handicraft imaginable. Dean watches with great amusement as Jess piles their rolling cart full as he drags it along behind her. Dean was convinced to bring his own ragged duffel and it’s already half full of various fruits for his pies and cobblers. And tons of business cards stored neatly in the zip pocket for his later perusal.
Dean doesn’t even hesitate this time.

“ Sure you don’t need an ice pack?” Castiel repeats Claire’s very sensible offer.
Dean, who’s currently in Castiel’s kitchen making cookies with Claire and Jack. Treats for their big night with Aunt Meg. Because Cas and Dean were supposed to be going out with Gabriel to his fancy law firm mandatory socializing event. Sam and Jess had invited Dean to get him out of the house, and Gabriel had begged Castiel to come along as a buffer between him and his on-again-off-again love/hate interest, Kali Pavarti from their Corporate Law Department.
Gabriel makes quiet gagging noises.
He thinks about how nice candy bars are and why glue is icky and what Claire would look like if she had a beard like Mr. Cain.
Chuck passes by the desk, smiling thinly at Castiel. Castiel does his best to return it and creates a folder in his work email, labeled BDL. He carefully drags each of the suspicious emails into the folder until all one hundred and seven are safely housed there. There’s another minute of contemplation, whether or not he should ask for Charlie’s assistance in tracing the sender back to its location. If anyone can do it, the redhead can, and with scary efficiency.
Minding the Children’s Desk is not one of Castiel’s favorite jobs. He’s much more comfortable on the Adult side of the building, helping the retirees gather their newspapers and the college students research their papers. It’s very quiet. Unlike the children’s side.
“ Cas?” Charlie already looks worried.
“ Hey, Cassie.”

The highlight of his night, however, is walking through the door with Claire and Jack in tow. Claire is very obviously Moana in her brightly printed tube top (over a long sleeve t-shirt due to the damp and chilly weather) and cloth and dried grass skirt. And Jack is very obviously HeiHei in his hooded rooster onesie which makes them even cuter than Sam and Jess. But the cherry on top of this adorable family cake is Cas. Cas in black slacks and a rather snug black and yellow striped t-shirt that clearly states
“ His people are very loyal to him. Nicholas values loyalty above nearly everything else.”
“ Someone was a boy scout.” Dean accepts the box and pulls a couple damp cloths from the top. It’s an easy clean-up, though Dean takes his time after cleaning up his own hand and stomach to gently wipe away the drying fluids from Cas’ skin. There’s not much to be done with their respective underwear until he does laundry. When Dean finishes he twists to drop the soiled wipes into the trashcan under the nearest sidetable and nearly falls over as a hand closes around his aching cock. He jerks his head back around to find Cas staring up lustily, broad cool hands lazily moving over his erection.
And then, overnight, he became the single parent of two. Castiel’s libido took a nosedive due to stress and lack of privacy and he honestly hadn’t missed it much.
Zachariah is not interested in Castiel’s opinion of his work and Castiel answers accordingly. “ It was fine.” No more, no less. Either his boss will get to the point or lose interest in the obligatory conversation. Castiel is willing to hold out.
with Sam because they were on sale. And I was bringing one over for your keys since Jack likes borrowing them.” Dean drops their joined hands to his chest and presses it there, steadying them both. “ I’ll get you another one for a super early birthday present, okay?”
“ That is fucking adorable.”
Many thanks, y'all are awesome!!!
as Dean has labeled the album.
Dean rubs the back of his neck, head ducked down.“ You’re, you’re, uhm, welcome.”
Many thanks to everyone who reads, kudos, comments! Y'all are the best!!!
“ Yeah. Can you go with her?” Sam looks desperate and he has every right to be.
Cas practically falls over himself getting to the trash can, sweeping it to him in one smooth motion and holding it up to replace Dean’s shirt. Dean strategically steps away and, gathering the hem of his shirt to contain the acidic liquid, bends forward and uses his other hand to grab the back of his scrub and pull it forward over his head. A white t-shirt is under the soiled scrub, but Castiel catches a flash of skin and waistband before the soft cotton falls back into place. Now Dean is holding a scrub shirt full of Jack’s puke and Castiel’s brain kicks back into gear, sending the proper responses to his mouth. “ Dean, I am so sorry! ”
But something has Castiel’s hackles up.
Still, Dean is all about consent.
As Dean meticulously places the burgers on the hot grill, Castiel verbally sets up a perimeter that keeps the children in sight, but away from the heated equipment. They are allowed to run between the lattice work partition that borders the patio on the right (screening it from view of the main house’s kitchen windows) to the shed on the left set at the edge of the cleared area that comprises the building’s lawn. The entire backyard slopes gently down to the edge of the woods surrounding the clearing. Castiel sprays them both with a light cloud of OFF since they're so near the treeline and sets them loose onto the large open space. He stays on the patio, though he doesn’t sit, instead leaning his hip against the table edge, keeping his eye on the children as he talks to Dean at the grill.
