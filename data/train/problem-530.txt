He rolled his eyes at John‘s questioning gaze. „I didn‘t voice my deductions, you know I keep my promise, John. However hard it may be, and you have no idea how hard it was today.“
„Blue Jean“ started to play, and suddenly he saw himself as a teenager at a house party of someone‘s cousin or something. It didn‘t really matter whose party it had been, what mattered was only one person there. Lars. John had never found out who Lars actually was, hadn‘t even dared to ask around for him, after. All he knew was that the boy had been from Sweden, and only in Britain for a week or so. They hadn‘t talked much. But this stranger had understood something about him, had unlocked something in him that John hadn‘t even fully realised was there. And had tried hard to push aside ever since.
„Don‘t be daft, John. Of course I didn‘t plan to turn the volume up all the way. But you can‘t expect me to settle for the horrible built-in speakers. You know Bowie does always have an actual bass player in the band, don‘t you? It would be a pity if all their hard work had been for nothing.“
But it was a false hope, he realised when he remembered why he had tried to obliterate every shred of desire he had felt towards Sherlock in the first place. „Married to my work“ - the words of rejection rang in his ears as if he had heard them just a moment ago. No, Sherlock would never return his affection. And now he knew he could take it personally.
So Sherlock could … there was a possibility… did that mean … John‘s brain refused to build complete sentences. He felt lost in a flood of feelings he had been blocking out for years. Suddenly there was this tiny spark of hope that called them all back. And of course they had become stronger while he wasn‘t looking – the attraction he had felt from the first moment on was now complemented by the deep affection for his friend that had grown over the years.
„Mmmh, that sounds plausible, honey,“ John said, not wanting to know exactly what information about „dead people“ had been shared – but he knew he would have to pick up the topic later with Sherlock. Rosie already had a bit of a reputation of being morbid, although Sherlock really contained himself when it came to talking about cases in front of Rosie. It was just hard to keep anything from her – she was learning from the best.
John was pulled out of his pondering. The negotiations had come to a conclusion: The three of them would now leave the flat and the cake and spend the rest of the day in the park. When they got hungry, they‘d buy fish and chips and not go back to the flat until bedtime. Then they would confide the cake to Mrs Hudson, who by then should be back from visiting her sister. Of course she would get her fair share of it, too. Rosie deemed that a reasonable price for the safekeeping of the remaining cake, especially considering that she might have given the landlady some cake anyway. She just hesitated a moment at the thought that Mrs Hudson might not think it to be necessary to bring them biscuits in the future, knowing now that they were able to bake themselves, but she dismissed that idea as silly immediately for several reasons.
Finally, Sherlock turned around. Never had he looked more beautiful than this, his face soft and open, his cheeks reddened and his eyes glistening. John recognised the mix of hope and anxiety in them as they roamed his face, and he tried to pour all his affection in his responding gaze.
And then a blissful smile lit up Sherlock‘s whole face and John couldn‘t hold off any longer. He stepped forward and immediately found himself pressed against his friend‘s chest. He wrapped his arms around Sherlock‘s back, and they stood there like this for a long while, content to stroke each other‘s back and breathe in each other‘s scent. At some point John pulled back gently, just far enough so that he could look Sherlock in the eyes again. He noticed the exact moment his favourite genius wisely decided not to comment on dilated pupils and smirked a little as he reached up to cup his face. But he went serious again immediately, revelling in the weight of the moment as their faces drifted towards one another inevitably.
The afternoon turned out to be really great, Rosie showing her most amiable side playing in the park and then even coming home without more than a bit of pro forma arguing.
It was nice sitting on the couch together, listening to song after song. John felt himself relax as he gazed idly at the screen, sipped his beer, and let his mind wander. Although he had never been a die-hard fan, he found he had come to know and like a lot of Bowie‘s songs over the years. Listening to them now brought back a lot of memories. Quite a few linked to his big sister who had introduced him to the music in the first place. Others to … other people.
John smiled as Rosie immediately came up with several ideas of cake-saving that she discussed with her rival in food. He was still amazed at times how well his daughter and Sherlock got along. When he had decided to move back into Baker Street with her, it surely hadn‘t been because he‘d considered the detective to be especially good with children. To be honest, he still avoided a closer look at why on earth he had made that decision – but it had turned out to be one of the best he had ever made.
What? John‘s head shot up so fast he got a little dizzy. Or maybe it was due to the implications of what Sherlock had just said.
„Don‘t worry“, Sherlock snarled, „You‘re safe. I am fully capable of keeping my hand‘s off Britain‘s straightest flatmate. You are not irresistible to everybody.“
„Daddy!“ Rosie exclaimed, flinging herself into his arms. „I danced with Sherk! And now we can eat cake, I‘m sooo hungry for cake!“
John blinked. What was wrong with Sherlock? He might be a bit of a lightweight, but still he couldn‘t be more than a bit tipsy from what little he had drunk. And why didn‘t he immediately try to find out where he had been wrong and … Wait. Had he just described David Bowie as attractive? Wasn‘t Sherlock a complete stranger to the whole concept? Or could he be attracted to someone, after all?
In the background, Mr Bowie finished his song. John washed his hands, then he let his happily chatting daughter drag him to the table, where Sherlock had now set the table for the three of them. Together, they enjoyed the delicious chocolate cake and told each other about their day. Rosie managed to devour two big pieces while filling her daddy in on today‘s most important events about her friends and enemies in the nursery school (she insisted on this phrasing, although John knew that whatever discord the children had would probably last two days at most) and about a fight „Sherk“ had had with her friend Craig‘s mother.
„No, Rosie, that‘s enough cake for today,“ John laid a hand on his daughter‘s arm, already preparing for the objections that were sure to come.
„Yes, Sherk was nice,“ Rosie leapt to his defence. „The fight was only because Craig‘s mother doesn‘t want Craig to know about dead people. I think they frighten her. But not Craig, and not me, and not Sherk. Maybe she was angry because she was the only one that was frightened.“
John smiled and kissed her on the cheek. „Hi, cutie, it‘s good to be home, I‘ve missed you. So you had a lot of fun, huh?“
„I am wrong, aren‘t I? I am wrong“, Sherlock stammered, „How can I be wrong? What is … Ah, the alcohol! I must be drunk!“ With that, he took his glass and swiftly drained the remainder of the pink liquid, then busied himself with scrolling through the list of songs youtube suggested they listen to next.
„Like what?“ John asked slowly, not yet daring to trust the hope that stirred inside him again – and yet completely failing to hold it down. „Like ...“ Sherlock stood and waved his arm around in a gesture that seemed to vaguely point at his friend as a whole, then he resumed his agitated pacing.
John hadn‘t expected him to go along with his plan so smoothly, but why question his luck? Though  the detective seemed a tiny bit too enthusiastic …
„I won‘t,“ he promised with an amused glint in his eyes. „But I have to admit I could have a hard time staying away from the cake entirely. Nearly as much as you, I suppose. What do you suggest we do to make sure the cake survives until tomorrow?“
John sat down on the couch again and cleared his throat. „Do you find David Bowie attractive?“ he asked, aiming for casually and missing by miles.
Still, sometimes John couldn‘t help the feeling that all of this was somehow not real, was borrowed luck or a bubble waiting to burst. He avoided thinking of the future most of the time, but … one day Rosie would need her own room, and they would move out, away from the genius detective and the best landlady there could ever be. Or maybe Sherlock would just change his mind one day and want the flat for himself again, to clutter it with experiments and human body parts. After all, he wasn‘t obliged in any way to bring the sacrifices he did to make 221B a home for Rosie.
„Yeah, right“, John replied mildly, scratching his neck, „now, where do we start? With the old stuff? I‘ve always liked „Five Years“, for example.“
And then, finally, their lips met, softly, cautiously at first, but soon they both threw themselves into the kiss with all they had. They were breathless and lightheaded when they finally took a break to look into each other‘s eyes again, stunned by what had just happened.
„Sherlock?“ John asked softly, his heart pounding like mad, „Do you have difficulties reading me because you … like me?“ (God, please, don‘t let me be wrong!)
„Ahhh, I got it wrong again!“ the detective groaned and got up to pace around the room. „Stupid sentiment, stupid, stupid! John, I don‘t … I can‘t think when you are like that!“
„So you didn‘t fall asleep before Rosie, but it was a close call. Still, you didn‘t go to bed straight away, which means you want to talk about something. There is the subject of Rosie speaking about corpses in the nursery school and scaring one of her friends‘ mother, but while you clearly see a need to discuss that sometime soon, you don‘t feel like touching the matter this evening, otherwise you would have made tea before coming to me. And now your swallowing and the slight twitching of your hand at the mention of tea suggest that you do want something to drink, but not tea – beer. You rarely drink beer in my company, usually you save that for Gary, as for chatting with him you don‘t need as much of your brain functioning. So it‘s about something that falls more into the spectrum of topics you would usually talk about to him, but for some reason plan on discussing with me. Ah – music. You were surprised that I like something other than classical music. Well, me playing the violin proved to be less than sufficient as an antidote to the hideous earworms Rosie keeps bringing home, so we needed something stronger, catchier. Which brought David Bowie to my mind. I used to listen to his music a lot when I was a teenager, which Mycroft hated by the way, and I remember his songs playing in a loop in my mind for weeks. So they seemed the right tool to fix this problem. By the way, be assured that I payed close attention to the texts when I chose the songs to play for Rosie. That is everything that needs to be said on the matter, I think. Do you still need the beer?“
be inappropriate.  No, your time will be entirely your own, except for a few minutes now and then.  You’ll have your own room, all the privacy you could wish, you can treat the place in every respect as your own home.  But I am, as you can see, a magician, and I would find it beneficial now and then to have the help of a trusted assistant.”
, who have offered support and encouragement throughout this process. Thank you for just being there.
John shows all the signs of a bad hangover when he finally gets up. He works his way slowly through a boiled egg and two cups of coffee and gives no indication that he remembers anything unusual about the preceding night. Not that Sherlock expected anything else.
It was something of a relief to get back into Lestrade’s office and shut the door. Lestrade hadn’t come back with the coffee yet. Sherlock sat down in Lestrade’s chair behind the desk and put his feet up, because if he didn’t put something between himself and John it would be that much harder to resist his very inappropriate urges. He was half-hard in his pants as it was. John’s gaze was on him, hot and bright. He glowed. It was like magic, really.
Sherlock never really expected this: to be lying cuddled up with a lover in the upstairs bedroom, to be sifting his fingers dreamily through the soft blond hair of soundly sleeping John. The room is dim with evening, street sounds filtering up from below: a car door closing, a woman’s voice, carefree and anonymous, no doubt heading for one of the restaurants up the block. A man’s voice answers: date. They’ve come in one car, so it’s not their first, but that heightened lilt in her voice and his tense laughter suggest that they aren’t quite comfortable together yet, still trying hard to amuse and impress. She’s wearing new shoes; he can hear them.
“Yeah, do it!” someone else calls out, and then everyone is shouting, waving, pushing. Sherlock takes something out of his pocket, looks at it, holds it to his ear. Amid all the noise, it takes me a couple of rings to realize my phone is buzzing. It’s him.
Sherlock did stop, to John’s relief.  “I suppose,” he said.  “Yes, I imagine you’re right.  Bloody Mycroft, we’ll have to re-hang the pictures.  Knocked down the rowan berries, too, I’ll bet.”
“Don’t want to finish like this,” John said. Sherlock pulled off of John’s cock and rested his head against John’s thigh, his mouth red and beautiful.
“Genius,” John says, squeezing my shoulder. “You should really take this stuff to the police, you know. It would help.”
“He is inexperienced in these—matters, as you know. Therefore, he is incautious. Prodigal. You could ask anything of him—he has no defenses, no reserves. Do I make myself clear?”
John had known that war would change him. But the thing that hurt the most, he thought, on a particularly brazen and luscious autumn day, was that he was still himself. If he were someone else, perhaps he could have moved on, sorted things out, found a new place in the world. But instead he was only himself: spell-shocked, too jumpy to serve as an Auror in peacetime, but with no idea how to be anything else. With his pension and a new wand (alder, eleven inches, phoenix feather, unyielding), he lived in London—the last place he had been happy, if only for a little time. He sought no work, and had none. As often as not he wandered the streets, looking for something, though he hid from himself what it was.
“More claim than you have, brother mine.” The deep voice makes both of us jump, and Mycroft goes as white as a sheet. Then Sherlock steps into my field of view. I should wonder how I didn’t notice him hiding here, in this very room. I should look at him, speak to him—but I’m too focused on my target. My hands are steady.
?  They never beat him.  They get into physical fights with him; I’ve seen him break wrists, kick guys in the crotch, seen him smash a man’s face with his knee.  People get hurt making this show.  How does that work?
Anyway, Christmas was nice, apart from the awkwardness. Harry’s girlfriend, Clara, is really cool, actually. I also got some money and books, a couple of jumpers, and my mad aunt got me a self-sharpening pocket knife, quite a good one.
Gregson runs a hand through his bristly hair, frustrated. “It wasn’t only what happened this morning. He’s not happy with having had to send you boys out here.”
Oh, yeah, this. The viewing public is gonna learn some stuff about me. But fuck them anyway. I smile around a bite of egg foo young, and it’s a real smile. “You don’t want to deduce it?”
“No need to be quiet my dear,” he says. “You’ll be caterwauling before I’m done with you. Let me hear that lovely voice while I frig you, come on now.”
It didn’t have much force for me, back then, but that was before…all this. Keeping my expression under careful control, I risk a glance at Sherlock, but he’s just texting away, looking  smug. I don’t know what bits of the canon Moriarty has smuggled in to him. Perhaps they don’t include
“Essentially,” Sherlock agreed.  “Though cats and magpies are sentient as well, in their own way, but--anyhow, the point is that it’s no longer the done thing among the right sort of magician.”
At first, there’s nothing. Just an ordinary network. Then a small camera icon lights up in the corner of his screen. He clicks it.
“Oh yeah,” John said. He petted his knuckles up Sherlock’s chest, and Sherlock positively purred. In this position, his backside was perfectly positioned to grind on John’s erection, and this he did, luxuriously. John bit his lip and pushed up into him, making Sherlock’s eyelids flutter. John took hold of Sherlock’s cock, still trapped in his pants, and squeezed and stroked it slowly while Sherlock rode him. It made a nice handful, thick and hefty. He worked his thumb into the placket of the shorts Sherlock was wearing and stroked it across the leaking tip.
“Yes,” Sherlock said, and he had the good grace to look sheepish. “But you’re leaving out that time in the middle—“
John sent the text. The phone buzzed in reply a few seconds later, and then again a second after that. John laughed.
Whatever may have happened to Aileen, it seems the rebellion is still in motion, because Henry Knight turns up just a couple of days later to entice Sherlock away to the moors.
,” John said. “I’ve got two days left. That app is never wrong, and anyway, I’m not feeling it at all.”
The caretaker, John was astonished to see, had changed even less than Professor McGonagall in the intervening years. They were just rounding the corner from the second floor corridor when a familiar voice stopped John in his tracks. It couldn’t be him—could it?
. John knew it, and he couldn’t let it go. He had thought, when it seemed that he was looking into Sherlock’s soul, that Sherlock felt the same. But now his behavior said something very different, and the contradiction tore at John’s heart.
“Mr. Moran,” Anthea says. Moran gives me a cursory patdown, then nods us through. Anthea does the retinal scan and leads me into the twinkly hallway.
Naturally, she appears at the most dramatically appropriate moment. Her flair for timing verges on the unnatural. Unless she’s being helped, somehow.
“Hey,” I say to him, low. He turns his starlit face to me, and there’s that openness again, that expectation. “C’mere.”
The twinkly wall is inset with several trim-looking doors, but the butler leads me to the larger door at the end of the hallway. His quiet tap is answered from within, and I am admitted. Mycroft’s office is large, fitted with more slowglass windows, these showing a Caribbean beach scene. The furnishings are sleek and new, low tables and chairs and aerodynamic sofas upholstered in grey and chartreuse. It’s not clear which piece of furniture might be Mycroft’s desk. When I come in, he’s sitting with his feet up on a grey ottoman, lounging back to view a large television screen mounted on the wall.
“Freedom for Mr Dawson,” he said, naming the man who had thus far been the prime suspect in our case. “And something a good deal less pleasant for our friend Miss Green. Come, Watson, the game’s afoot!” Rising, he dropped his blanket and came to take the valise from me. Impishly, I kept hold of the handle when he tried to tug it out of my hand. He looked at me in confusion for a moment, then smiled, and bent to give me the kiss that my stratagem had been designed to elicit. With his tall, bare form so close to me, I was achingly aware of the contrast in our states of dress, and I was conscious of the extra piquancy this lent to the desire I already felt for him. I’m sure he sensed it, too.
“Why, are you gonna tell him?” It’s easy to be cheeky when he’s only said what I’ve already been thinking.
“My dear Watson, it is quite simple,” he replied, a tone of menace creeping into his voice.  “I shall know where you live.”
“That would be the kindest thing, surely,” Mycroft says, but he doesn’t stop the video or move in any way. I stand awkwardly for a moment, then meander around the room a little, pretending to examine things while in reality straining my ears, wanting with an unseemly desperation to know just how much the microphones picked up.
I’ve rehearsed my “we have to stop” speech so many times in my head that I’m utterly lost when Sherlock doesn’t let me finish it, and my traitorous tongue offers up an unauthorized compromise:
Sherlock spends that night in my room. We wake to his phone buzzing: Lestrade, with a case. I’d far rather tell him to shove it and have a lie-in with Sherlock, especially as the timing is clearly intended to get us out of our nest and back into the public eye for the day. But Sherlock’s eyes light up, and so, we go.
It’s dangerous to lie to Sherlock Holmes about anything, which can make it tricky to get away to film the background scenes.  This is why my character has a job.  The morning after the business with the cabbie, I run out to “the clinic”.  I don’t need to wear yesterday’s clothes; the wardrobe department will provide a duplicate outfit.
“Easy,” John murmurs. “Easy, Sherlock.” Soothed, steadied, he finds a rhythm, finds a place where the hot throbbing of his body falls into line. On a tightrope, but steady, sustainable. “God, you’re so gorgeous like this,” John goes on. “If I were alpha right now, I’d be knotting you already. I couldn’t stop myself. Sooo lovely. Smells so good, too, even just like this.”
Bart’s is about half a mile from the empty flat. I set off at a fast walk, then break into a jog as the situation sinks in. Sherlock didn’t
A low growl scraped in Sherlock’s throat. He was hard again. Lestrade was making short, deep thrusts, already too swollen to pull out far. John’s hands fisted in Sherlock’s hair. Sherlock found Lestrade’s eyes again.
Pay him! The very idea. He fumed over it for the rest of the afternoon, determined that he would never, ever be friends with Sherlock Holmes.
“Mm-hmm,” Sherlock hums. John nuzzles against him, his fingers closing on a handful of the front of Sherlock’s shirt.
“Quickly,” said Sherlock, and they moved, without releasing their hands, to Sherlock’s cauldron. They were not the only such trio maneuvering about the room; John felt curiously certain that, once he released his partners’ hands, it would be hard to join up again. Evidently this feeling was shared by the others. John looked up quickly at Sherlock and Snape’s faces before they began the spell again. Snape was unreadable, as usual, but Sherlock met his eyes briefly. His look was wide-eyed, awestruck—terrified. That shook John a little, and he was afraid he wouldn’t be able to do the spell. But if he didn’t, Sherlock’s potion wouldn’t work out and he would fail the class again. John took a deep breath and began the Blessing. Sherlock and Snape joined in with their lower voices.
“Oh, I did,” he said. He rocked his hips, building friction, and John groaned. “Even before the train, but especially afterward. Even your trivial letters made me hard. I used to wank myself raw over you.”
They go into town and trail St. Paul to a lunch meeting with a red-haired man. They follow the red-haired man until they learn his name, and then they google him and learn that he runs special effects for the local theater. They go to the theater and break in and find a lot of lights and projectors and fogscreen machines that are certainly not required for the company’s current production of
He hands her her hat and ushers her rather forcefully out the door. I think it’s only her sense of personal dignity that keeps her from physically shoving her way back inside. “Well!” I hear her say, after the door is shut. Then she stomps back off down the path to where her car is waiting.
“Oh, that’s really not a good idea,” the wizard said dryly, and John froze. “If I don’t get this reagent into the brew it’ll go critical in less than a minute.”
John drew a deep, hissing breath, his cock hardening rapidly. Sherlock gave a low hum of appreciation; even for an Alpha, John was well-endowed, though Sherlock could give him some competition in that regard. His own cock was trapped hard and leaking against John’s lower back, the thick base of the shaft nestled in the cleft of John’s buttocks. John didn’t shy away from that pressure. Sherlock ground harder against him, and John pushed back into it, giving.
McGonagall had given him a week to make arrangements, but it was more time than he needed, so that when he came back at the end of it, he was nervous all over again. He went straight to work in the hospital wing, and was amazed at how well Madam Pomfrey remembered him, and how easy he found her company. They saw three new cases that day: a broken arm, a pimple jinx, and a flu. John assisted with the first two and observed the third. He was also tasked with managing a steady traffic of students who wanted to visit Patience Pettibone, a fourth-year Gryffindor girl who was bedridden with an unusually severe case of Merriwether’s Mucorrhea, which she seemed to have caught on holiday. As she was quite contagious, he couldn’t let them in to see her, but he took their gifts of flowers, sweets, books, and letters, which she received from him with unfeigned delight.
But he’s already pulling back, stilling. I open my eyes and catch him looking up at me, dark-eyed, his lips parted.
“Though, to be fair,” he said, “I think it made me love Professor Snape a little, as well, but as I’d already been in love with you, it wasn’t the same.”
.” He exhales roughly as I lay my hand along his bare hardness, there in the close, humid place inside his clothes. Sparse hair brushes against my knuckles. His testicles are pushed slightly forward by his closed thighs, the skin of his scrotum silkily mobile under my fingertips. Sliding up, I find him uncircumcised. I give the foreskin a single roll over the head, and Sherlock’s whole body shudders.
“Well that wasn’t nearly as bad as the last one,” he said. “I think it’s improving. Say, John, who’s this witch then, hmm? Bit too glowy. Oh, hullo, you’re glowy, too. Got a bit of an aura going. Get you a de-glowing potion, probably got one around here, or if not I shall make you one.”
Fucking hell. I’d rather stab myself with a rusty fork than get into one of Mycroft’s creepy cars right now, but it’s not as though I have any choice. I go and get dressed, and I’m on the kerb when the car pulls up. I have the phone with me, as there’s no longer any point in pretending it doesn’t exist. For one wild moment I considered bringing the gun, but that would just give him an excuse to take it away from me, which I really don’t want.
“Actually, I was wondering if you knew anything about what happened to Sherlock Holmes. Where he is or—or anything?”
“Well, it was a cracking orgasm,” John said. “Five out of five. But, Christ, I’m still not—I’m not calm. Adrenaline. Like we’ve been fighting.”
“No,” John said, and sniffed. “It’s so strange, though. I don’t know why it—Jesus.” He sat up, rubbed his nose and eyes, trying to pull himself together. “It was so…beautiful, actually.”
The next several days passed in relative calm.  John interviewed for several jobs, and eventually found a part-time position at a low income clinic.  Really, they needed a full-time doctor, but the money was a bit too tight to hire one.  Consequently, John put in a number of unpaid hours.  It was hard work, and paid little, but it more-or-less satisfied his desire to accomplish something useful.
fairly gratifying. The work is all right, but I can’t spend my life patching up minor hexes and broken hearts.”
Sherlock falls asleep in my arms. I lie awake most of the night, feeling him breathe, but when I open my eyes in the morning, I’m alone in the bed. My heart goes cold until I see Sherlock sitting cross-legged in the chintz armchair, wrapped in his dressing gown, doing something on the laptop. He looks adorably rumpled, his curls askew, his gaze intent. Then he tilts his head to look at something in his hand—oh. It’s the phone. The Irene phone that I interfered with last night.
That settled the issue for the moment, and John thought no more about it until he was lying in his bed later that night.  Then the sound of Mycroft’s words came back to him:
“Look at them.” A family down the hall, grieving. “They all care so much. Do you ever wonder if there’s something wrong with us?”
“Kitty Riley, Specialist,” I read. There’s an address under the name—this address. “Specialist? Specialist in what?”
“All right,” she says at last. “Just let me make a few calls. You can expect the stylist at noon sharp. He’ll tidy you up and give you something to wear. The driver will pick you up at half three. Shouldn’t be any trouble with the dinner reservation, but if there is, I assume cash is fine?”
“It’s quite simple. Here, you can see a list of all the active image- and sound-capture devices in the phone’s range.” He taps the Blick icon. “VRS, cams, mics, etc. If you connect to the phone’s wifi network with your laptop, you’ll be able to see what each device is picking up. You simply select the ones you want to scramble, go over here to K2K, press the button, and bob’s your uncle. It can handle up to three signals.”
These facts give rise to unquantifiable sensations: solitude, grandeur, apprehension. He shouldn’t be susceptible to them, and yet they crowd against him from every side. It isn’t only that he’s seen the Hound, if that is what it was. It isn’t only that he has confronted an unnatural creature. It’s the way everything has seemed heightened ever since they landed, somehow more real than real, deductions coming upon him almost unbidden, spurred by an overwhelming richness of detail. There’s more dust here, somehow, more footprints, more history in the stones and the scuff marks and the way people move about. At first it was exhilarating, but as the day has worn on, it’s come to seem somehow sinister. There’s something impossible about it all, a deduction too far, and now, having seen the Hound, a fact at once implausible and incontrovertible, everything is piling up, coming upon him in sickening waves, implications spiraling out like fractals, too much for him to manage.
But coming on strong with Sherlock hadn’t worked. Or it had worked up to a point, but John had a feeling that if he pressed Sherlock too hard, he would withdraw for good. So in the days that followed the Blessing, John kept things as light as he could. He still sat next to Sherlock in Potions, but he limited his chatting to the minutes before class began. Afterward, he walked with him to the spot where Sherlock turned right for Arithmancy and John turned left for Charms. He did not invite Sherlock to study, let alone anything more. Sherlock did not…relax, exactly, in response to this approach. But he did at least receive John’s limited companionship without complaint.
“So,” Sherlock said, lighting his flock of candles with a flick of his wand, “your alcove. How do you like it?”
Without waiting for their reply, he let himself out of the compartment and began walking down the center of the swaying train, looking into each compartment as he went. He knew Sherlock was going home for the holiday, so he must be on this train somewhere. John walked all the way to the front of the train, then turned back past the compartment where he’d been sitting and started heading for the back. He finally found Sherlock in the second to last car. He was alone, reading.
He looks confused for a moment more, and then a shutter comes down over his expression, and I wish immediately that I could take it back, and bollocks to Mycroft and the whole bloody world.  But he is already pulling away.
“No.”  He tugged irritably at the hem of his Jacket, looking as though he didn’t want to have this conversation.
By the start of spring term, John felt comfortable calling his superiors Poppy and Minerva, and he was easy enough with the other professors and staff that he didn’t mind running into them. The young witch he had seen talking with Sherlock on the day of his interview was the new Divination professor, Molly Hooper. She was young enough to have been in school with him and Sherlock, but she had attended Beauxbatons. Given Sherlock’s views on divination, he was surprised that they were friends, but once he got to know her, he found that he liked her, as well, and the three of them made a little pack and went out now and then for a drink in the village.
“Not entirely,” Sherlock said. “But I couldn’t bear to fail the class again, and I thought it was worth the risk.”
John turned to look at the mark he’d made on Sherlock’s neck and hissed in sympathy, reaching up to stroke it gently with one finger.
As soon as she had disappeared round a corner, Holmes said, “Watson, pray go and fetch one of those long oars that is leaning up against the dockhouse. I shall need it in a moment.” I went for the oar, assuming that Holmes meant to use it to probe the bottom of the river. But as I reached it, I heard a muted splash.
The skin beneath my palm is soft. I know how pale he is, untouched by sun and wind. He’s always been lean, but he is also strong. I trace the divot where his bicep slips under the deltoid. He relaxes fractionally beneath my touch, so I keep going, letting my fingers catalogue the long muscles of his forearm, the tendons of his wrist. His back softens gradually, the tension seeping out of him little by little. There is hair on the outer surface of his arm, but the underside is smooth and fragile feeling. I make long, slow strokes, up and down from wrist to shoulder and back again. I’m so hypnotized with touching him that I don’t notice his response until, after a while, he turns his palm up, and I slide my fingers along his wrist and into it.
Sherlock regarded him for another silent minute, blinking rapidly, then seemed to snap out of it and regain his momentum. “Right, then. I’ll just be getting on. I’ll text!” he called as he strode out the door.
A little later, having had a pleasant cup of tea and two slices of toast with jam, John was sitting on his own bed reading back over the case details Sherlock had sent him and the increasingly urgent text messages that had followed while he was out running. He could follow Sherlock’s rising concern easily, and guilt roiled in his gut. True, Sherlock had jumped to the worst possible conclusion without assessing the facts - which was quite unlike him, actually - but John couldn’t blame him for it. In the weeks after the Culverton Smith case, John had been hyper-vigilant about Sherlock’s state, too - demanding to see his arms to look for track marks, checking his eyes for constricted pupils or bloodshot whites, scrutinizing him constantly for the slightest sign of backsliding into drug use. Only after some time had passed without incident did he relax his attention back to more usual levels.
“Hmmm, you’re right,” Sherlock pushed himself up to sitting, then stood to stretch - long arms up over his head, hands almost brushing the ceiling.
about him. Even loved him? In whatever way a self-professed sociopath could do, John guessed that was how it was for Sherlock. How rare was that for his friend? As far as anyone he’d ever talked to - including Sherlock’s parents - had said, how Sherlock behaved toward John was unlike anything they had ever seen in the aloof genius. Warm. Protective. Thoughtful. All for him, only John.
John shook his head. “Not with you,” he said absently, “I can talk with Duck about it tomorrow.” John’s gaze snapped to movement in the bright reflection of the room in the window, as clear as a mirror against the darkness outside. He saw the hand barely raised, the hopeful openness blooming on plush lips and tilted eyes, the short step taken toward him. And he saw his own closed, hunched posture; saw the reaction his words produced (puzzlement, disappointment, wistfulness?) pass over his friend’s face before it too, closed off and resumed its impassive mien. His stomach roiled uncomfortably.
John’s face crinkled with his smile. “I know, love. I know.” His rhythm never faltered, relentlessly driving them both higher, ratcheting their gratification up and up toward climax. John bent down and kissed Sherlock again, invading his mouth, laying claim to him utterly. He accelerated his pace, angling to brush against Sherlock’s prostate with each thrust, the gusts of his huffed breaths tickling against delicate skin under Sherlock’s ear.
John thought. “And then,” he said, turning his back to Sherlock with careful steps on the steel beam. “You’ll need to unclip one of those ropes back there, and I’ll attach it to you on the big ring in back. That way, if you fall, you’re facing downward and attached by the middle of your body. You’ll still bloody swing around and bash into things, but you won’t pull your arm off, or pass out from the blood rushing to your head while someone comes to get you.”
Marjorie gradually quieted behind her hands, then looked up when John offered her the square from his suit pocket. She dabbed at her eyes. “You mean that? Really? You’d try with me if we’re still single when I’m forty?” She offered him a watery smile.
He could acknowledge now, with the luxury of time and distance, that James had likely fancied him. Been in love with him? John frowned and considered it. A lot of straight men might get defensive if another bloke fancied them; for sure there had been all sorts of macho bullshit thrown around in the barracks about it. Those men who overcame the taboo to find comfort in each other, be it just physical or something more, definitely had caught shit for it. He’d assigned punishment runs and the worst of cleanup duties to more than one homophobic arsehole in his unit for being obnoxious to fellow soldiers.
The body underneath his hands stilled - John’s agile mouth froze, then withdrew. John heaved a breath, and raised his head to look at Sherlock’s dazed expression, his own face sober and wide-eyed with chagrin. He leaned away from Sherlock hurriedly and took a step back; hands drifting to clasp lean biceps as he panted.
“No,” Sherlock replied shortly, standing to take Rosie from the woman and following her into the kitchen to help with the child’s breakfast. John didn’t hold out much hope that the man would eat any himself.
About twenty minutes later, he heard a card in the door and John strode in, smiling and chipper. “This place is huge, Sherlock! I thought the place we hired for my wedding was grand, but this tops it easily. It has a swimming pool indoors, and three hot tubs, a squash court, and the breakfast is a buffet including a grumpy fellow in a chef’s hat making omelets. I had two.” He grinned wider, taking the chair across from his friend. “Are you hungry? I’d like to know what you deduce about the omelet bloke that makes him so gloomy.”
He had a hard time expressing this to his family and friends back home. He got emails from them all; from Harry, from Brigid and Tim, from Clara, from Stephen, from some of the blokes he trained with at Bart’s, and from Marjorie. He did his best to let them know he was fine, he was safe, he was doing what he loved. It was easy to complain about the food and the heat or the cold, or the bloody sand in everything. It was easy to write about the boredom between missions, and how he saved a hand or a knee or an eye with his skills. It was not easy to write about how fiercely his heart pounded, his legs and arms working tirelessly with seemingly no effort; how empty he felt when the mission was finished and the waiting for the next one began. How he could hardly remember what his life was before this experience.
“You said to think about what to live for; that’s easy. I’ve got a daughter, just about a year old now. Her mother is dead, and there’s so much to tell, to unpack about that, you’ll be sick of it soon enough. God knows I am.” He dropped his head and scratched fingers through sweat-damp hair, making it stick up in odd spikes.
They moved through their stretches without further speaking, John now familiar with the routine that Duck preferred. When Duck sat to swap out his prosthetic since he had said the peg-style leg was better for yoga, John put down a pair of mats for them to stand on. He had a momentary feeling of surprised unreality - he, John Watson, doctor-soldier-blokey-bloke, was going to do yoga with a 50-something, male, amputee athlete who could kick his arse around a track any day of the week.
They established themselves at their places and waited, saying little. John seemed impervious to the frequent long stares Sherlock pinned him with, only breaking the silence once a stocky fellow with a pained expression lumbered by to set up the roast beef carving station. John indicated the worker with a significant head tilt, and said under his breath “that’s the omelet bloke. So, what’s his story?”
His own hand was like him: solid and well-muscled, no nonsense, nails clean and short, a bit of hangnail on the thumb. He scrutinized his hand like he had never seen it before, turning it over, back and front. White nicks and lines of scars marred his skin, he hadn't noticed them much before. His hand trembled sometimes; not today. Over, back and front. As he looked, the light seemed to change - grow brighter, harsher, a merciless noontime sun. He remembered this hand in that light, working feverishly amidst noise and chaos, sunk in blood and worse as it tried to staunch the flow from ragged broken shapes that were men he had known. Over, back and front - dust in his nose, cacophony in his ears, hand bloody but still steady, aiming and firing. Over, back and front – his hand slipping, pressing weakly on a makeshift bandage on his own shoulder; no leverage, his blood soaking through in a spreading flower of red. Over...
“My name is Sherlock Holmes, and I was-- Yes, that one. And yes, everyone else seems to, as well. --I was wondering whether you had a few minutes to spare. I need to speak with you,” Sherlock said. “That will be fine. Now, where are you located? Okay. Thanks so much. My companion and I will be along shortly.”
“He didn’t, as far as I knew. But he really hated talking about himself, so none of us really knew a lot about his personal life.”
Sherlock felt for Lestrade. The responsibility of investigating these murders had been the Detective Inspector’s from the beginning, but being the person to discover a body had to add an extra level of horror.
Sherlock walked impatiently from one end of the room to the other and back again. He was at the morgue at St. Bart’s, alternating between pacing and hovering over Molly’s shoulder as she began performing Agatha’s autopsy. Sherlock stopped pacing momentarily and took out his magnifier. He bent down to examine Agatha’s face, noting that both her tongue and throat were swollen, supporting Lestrade’s statement concerning her cause of death.
“She’s inside,” said Lestrade, turning and walking into the building. He led Sherlock and John down a short corridor to a doorway that was criss-crossed with crime scene tape. The three of them ducked under the tape and entered the flat labelled ‘1A.’ Lestrade stopped walking once they reached the sitting room. Two members of the crime scene unit were bent over, examining a figure lying in a reclining chair.
“Don't be silly,” Moriarty had said. “Someone else is holding the rifle. I don't like getting my hands dirty.”
Sherlock thought to himself. He quickly eliminated that possibility, however, because Lestrade was still keeping the bit about the numbers out of the press, and he knew John was omitting it from his blog entries. It also struck him as odd that this murder had happened so soon after the last one.
The moment John entered the clinic, he understood why Kate had been so insistent that he come into work. The waiting room was nearly full. He walked over to the reception desk.
The office was strangely crowded, forcing Sherlock to edge past several groups of people on his way to the secretary’s desk. The woman seated behind the desk was not the same person he’d seen the previous day. She appeared to be deep in conversation with a grim-looking man in an ill-fitting suit. Sherlock approached the desk, but decided to move a few feet to the side after a woman from one of the groups stepped backwards onto his foot.
“It can’t be,” Sherlock murmured. He leaned back in his chair and stared at the line of sticky notes on the table. He could hear his heart pounding in his ears.
“Then I can’t help you,” the nurse said, interrupting him. John sighed and started rooting around in his jacket pockets. He produced one of the police badges Sherlock had nicked from Lestrade and showed it to the nurse.
At what seemed like long last, the taxi pulled up outside of Irene Adler’s old address. Sherlock paid the driver and stepped out of the car. An odd feeling materialised in the pit of his stomach and he stared up at the pristine white stone of the building.
John said nothing, and simply settled himself in his chair and waited for Sherlock to elaborate. He knew prodding would get him nowhere. Sherlock would explain when he was good and ready. He had a feeling he wasn’t going to like Sherlock’s revelation, even though it seemed likely that said revelation would bring the murders to an end. Then Sherlock and every other person who had been working on the cases could finally rest. He could see the effects that the lack of consistent sleep was having on Sherlock, who was used to operating on less sleep, as well as Lestrade, who was not. He hadn’t seen much of Molly lately, but he was sure the she, too, was exhausted. He could only wonder how the various members of the crime scene unit were being affected.
Inwardly, John hoped it wasn’t going to be as hectic a day as Kate was predicting, even though he knew better. Kate had a knack for being able to predict, with decent accuracy, when they were going to be swamped.
Once Sherlock exited the taxi at Mallory’s address, he paid the driver and made his way into the building. He met Lestrade on the stairs.
Without a word, Sherlock abandoned his bookshelf mission and returned to the wall of photos. He began plucking a few of the sticky notes off of the wall. Then he sat down and spread them out on the table in front of him
“I was wondering when you were going to turn up,” said an all-too-familiar voice from behind Sherlock.
Sherlock covered his face with his hands as he tried to will his brain to make sense of it all. Unsurprisingly, he attempts proved futile. He slowly uncovered his eyes and returned his attention to the wall of photos and sticky notes. On a whim he stood up and tacked the photos of the numbers in a row. As he had no photos of the most recent victim yet, he substituted a sticky note with the number three drawn on it.
“It won’t do any good. I have no evidence to support my deductions about him, and I believe Gladys fears him too much to speak out against him explicitly.”
The "handjobs" tag applies to this chapter. If you would like to avoid this content, but still read the chapter, simply skip the first paragraph.
The elevator doors opened as soon as John pressed the button. He nearly collided with the person who stepped out of the elevator, and it took him a moment to realise that it was Kate.
The re-integration of John and Sherlock into each other’s lives after the Fall was anything but seamless. John had spent the first two weeks after Sherlock’s “death” in a complete daze, not leaving the flat, and hardly speaking to anyone. Then he slowly began to resume living, as best he could under the circumstances. He got a job at a local clinic, as a means to both support and distract himself. When his mind was unoccupied, it had a tendency to wander. More and more often, he’d found it had meandered to a conclusion that he’d been trying to avoid for a long time; he was in love with Sherlock.
Sherlock rose, intending to check something in one of his books. But, before he could do so, John grabbed him by the collar and crashed their mouths together. He slipped his tongue into Sherlock’s mouth when his lips parted in surprise for an instant, before he closed his eyes and kissed back. They broke apart after a few moments, and John put his lips to the side of Sherlock’s throat, simultaneously pressing his hips forward. A soft sigh escaped Sherlock’s lips, and John smirked a little bit before sliding one hand down between their bodies. He ran his hand down across the front of Sherlock’s trousers.
“I asked whether you knew what happened to Jack,” said Krista, tucking a chunk of her hair behind her ear and avoiding John’s eyes.
“Your coworker, Vivian, I think was her name, mentioned seeing a strange deliveryman here the other day, and that the package he brought upset Mr. Isaac. I need two things from you; a log of deliveries, and the key to Mr. Isaac’s locked desk drawer.”
When the car pulled up outside Agatha’s building, he immediately noticed something was missing. The impatiens were gone. Sherlock approached the building and examined the now-empty window boxes, carefully stepping around the small heaps of dirt that littered the pavement beneath them. The soil inside each box itself was riddled with jagged divots where it seemed the plants had been torn out by the roots.
Sherlock sighed. He’d thought they’d made some manner of progress. However, he felt just as confused and even more frustrated than before. He stood up and paced from one end of the room to the other, muttering to himself as he went. Every few laps he paused to look at the wall of photos. He stopped pacing after a few minutes, and strode over to the second set of bookshelves. He wasn’t too fond of the idea of proceeding as he had with the books he’d chosen from the first set of shelves.
“San Quentin, according to Megan. What was he incarcerated for?” Sherlock asked, jotting down the gist of what Gladys had just told him.
Without another word, Sherlock made his way down to the end of the alley to the street and hailed a taxi. The address Anthony had given him wouldn’t be too long of a car ride, thankfully. As much as he needed the information the man could possibly provide, he was also eager to get back to analyzing the information from the last victim’s file before the new one came in.
“Mhm,” Sherlock replied, before closing the distance between their mouths. He slid a hand down John’s torso.
“For less than three minutes. I did what I had to,” replied Sherlock, neglecting to mention that he hadn’t even found anything of substance in her flat, aside from the ketamine, which had been along the lines of what he’d been expecting.
Thank you so much to everyone who made it this far! This story was originally written as a gift. I started writing it in October of 2014, and finished it in November 2015. It's been such a long haul, but I had so much fun with it.
“I… was grasping at straws when it first came to mind. It wasn’t supposed to lead anywhere,” Sherlock said, as though he were trying to convince himself.
Five minutes later, John was back downstairs, dressed and stuffing his mobile into his trouser pocket. They headed outside, and Sherlock knotted his scarf around his neck before hailing a cab. Once they were seated in the backseat of the car and Sherlock had given the driver the address, John looked over at his flatmate-slash-boyfriend-thing and wondered what was going on, although he knew better than to ask.
“You having an idea about something didn’t make it happen,” John replied. He had a feeling that Sherlock was about to start blaming himself for whatever conclusion he’d just come to.
“There were no stray fingerprints, no signs of forced entry, so she might have known the person who killed her.”
The landlord continued to eye Sherlock for a few more seconds, and then stepped past him into the corridor, shutting his door behind him. He said nothing as he pulled a wad of keys out of his pocket and jiggled it around in his hand until he found the right one.
“Well, Lou, would you care to join us?” Lou didn’t reply and turned to leave the room, his footsteps fading slowly as he retreated to some other room.
John closed the notepad and placed it back in his pocket, along with the pen. He figured he should probably leave Krista alone to rest, and one glance out the window told him he’d been there longer than he thought. The sun was low in the sky, turning the clouds pink and casting long shadows. John rose from the chair and offered Krista his hand again.
“Gladys Jacobson,” she replied, smiling slightly at Sherlock until she realised her husband was looking at her. The smile faded from her face, and Sherlock could see what her eyes were red, and a bit puffy, and decided not to comment on it.
He needed to think logically about this. Moriarty must have planned to kidnap John. Therefore, he needed to have somewhere quiet and secluded to bring him.
“Yes. Lou’s son from his first marriage. Bit of a twat, he is, if you’ll pardon my language. But this couldn’t have anything to do with him. He’s locked up in California.”
As Sherlock raised his hand to hail a taxi, a thought occurred to him. He turned around and walked back up into the flat, and all the way up to John’s bedroom. He crossed the room to John’s bedside table and began rummaging through the drawers. After a few second he located John’s handgun. He slid the magazine out of the gun, and replaced it after making sure it was loaded. If he could get out of this without using it, he would, but he would much rather have it and not need it, than need it and not have it. He debated for a moment how best to carry the gun before simply deciding to tuck it down the back of his trousers. He rushed back downstairs and outside.
“Colleen, please,” she replied. “Doctor Watson, I’m pretty certain we have this exact exchange every time I come to see you.”
The taxi dropped them off only a few streets away from Scotland Yard. The boy had been found in an alley. Sherlock couldn’t help thinking that the killer was growing even bolder, striking in broad daylight, and so close to such an important hub of police activity.
John got up from his chair, and walked over to put his arm around Sherlock. He couldn’t fathom how Jim Moriarty could still be alive.
The inconsistencies in the M.O., the lack of connections between the victims; they were all things that Moriarty would have come up with. Even though he had figured out the culprit, he still couldn’t fathom the motivation. In their past dealings, Moriarty had never been one to kill by his own hand. Sherlock thought back to their run-in at the pool where Carl Powers had died.
Sherlock turned and left the morgue, with Molly calling after him about the reports. She slid them out of the printer and stapled the pages together before setting the stapler back down on her desk with a bit more force than necessary. Sherlock had given her grief about the time it had taken to get the reports finished and then left without them. She set them aside and got back to work, muttering to herself.
“Hold on a second,” said John. He pressed something on the phone’s screen and then put it down on the table. “Lestrade? You’re on speaker.”
“Indeed. This investigation is all but dead in the water, if you’ll pardon the expression,” said Sherlock, adding the last bit as he saw John’s frown deepen.
“That’ll be the autopsy report, thank you,” he replied, accepting the envelope from her. Her eyes widened slightly at the word ‘autopsy,’ but she said nothing, and turned to head back to her flat, closing the door behind her.
know. He was still at a bit of a loss. It seemed highly unlikely that the apple possessed any real importance. But at the same time, he couldn’t seem to dismiss it completely from his mind. There were several factors connected to the lawyer’s death that hadn’t come up in the previous cases. The apple was one of them, and the other was the strange delivery man whom the secretary had mentioned. John had shared his and Vivian’s conversation with Sherlock. Immediately, the delivery man had piqued Sherlock’s interest. It would make sense for the lawyer’s office to keep a log of deliveries, so Sherlock thought it might contain some useful information.
He felt the body in his arms tense up minutely, and realized John had opened his mouth to speak but immediately closed it, perhaps afraid to spoil the moment. Sherlock tilted his head and raised an eyebrow to encourage his friend. John tried again, color staining his cheeks. “Sherlock,” he started, taking a deep breath, “you know talking about – important things -  is not easy for me.” He breathed again, in and out; “but this week has been… along with being completely crazy, it has been one of the best of my life.” He huffed another moment. “And it’s because I’m seeing a side of you I never knew might be possible. I need to know…” he trailed off and turned his gaze away from Sherlock, looking at the other dancers nearby. A moment passed, filled with music and the hum of conversations all around them.
full costume changes, all so that a stagehand could deliver a bit of paper that John knew would drive him crazy. He grinned his delight and took a deep, calming breath which did next to nothing to slow his heart rate or lessen his arousal, but made him feel psychologically better. Then he opened the note.
John’s hand let go of his cock, and he blinked his eyes open at the loss, looking quizzically at his lover. John rolled to his back, bringing Sherlock over on top of him, long body between John’s legs. “Here now, like this, just here…” John arranged them so that Sherlock was pressed in the cradle of John’s hip, slippery with his ejaculate. Sherlock’s own cock was dripping copiously now, adding to the slick slide, and he found he could not help but rock forward and back, rubbing himself against John’s soft belly. John’s hands moved to cup Sherlock’s buttocks, squeezing them, pulling them apart and forward, fingers dipping toward his crack and oh, that was… Sherlock’s body thrust again, faster, then pushed eagerly back into the hands on his arse.
The day after John's confession, Sherlock emerged from his mind palace after hours of silence. He had been mulling over the emails he had read between Marjorie and John after breaking into John’s laptop while he was out walking. Marjorie was obviously fixated on John, likely as a way to cope with her loss. John just as clearly was trying to be kind, but in no way encouraged her. John's idea had merit; appearing to be in a gay relationship would take John about as far off the market as it was possible to be.
John’s sigh could have been heard in the next train carriage. He put his book aside, and thought for a moment. “Well, how about you practice," he said, widening his eyes, “being more relaxed?”
His daughter burbled through her spoonful of banana in a way that would have made him laugh out loud a day ago; today he smiled and stifled a feeling of resentment that she was there, a stark reminder of his responsibilities.
“Actually...” Duck offered, “that brings me to something we ought to talk about. You’ve been here a week, and in hospital for two days before that. How are you doing? How are you feeling?”
“John,” Sherlock gasped as he regained his composure, “I… I don’t have the words. This… all this… it’s so…” he shook his head, frustrated that he couldn’t express this fundamental change in his experience of the world. “I…” he settled for the basics; the rest would come in time, he figured. “I love you, John. I never let myself hope we would be together like this, but…” he gave John a suddenly watery smile, then hid his face in the pillows by John’s shoulder.
“And there’s Sherlock, he’s my best friend. He needs me, y’know? He cares about me, and that’s... so unusual for him, so out of his comfort zone... I’m possibly the only person in the world who can say it. Well, now Rosie, my daughter. He loves her, too. But he’s this amazing, brilliant man, can read your life story in the stains on your shoes and the way you comb your hair, but he’s a recovering addict, and he calls himself a sociopath and he has so much trouble making emotional attachments with anyone. Doesn’t understand how regular people work most of the time, and couldn’t be the slightest bit arsed to find out in case it might be important.” John huffed in exasperated wonder. “He’s picked me, out of all the people in London, in the world, to be the one he lets into his life, be his friend.” John clasped his hands tightly together again, feeling the one against the other and comparing it to the wide paw that grasped his hand in the garden yesterday. His throat felt tight, his words having to push past feelings that were rising up. “I almost let him down; took that one person away from him, right? When I took those pills.”
His laptop sat on the desk at the side of the room; kept in his bedroom away from little hands. It booted up almost silently, the whirring of the cooling fan the only noise in the deep-night silence of the flat. One thing left to do: he opened an email and began to type.
), in the widening of his eyes, in the licking of his lips as he regarded Sherlock. “May I…” he said, gesturing to Sherlock’s body; Sherlock nodded, beyond ready to experience John’s touch in this way.
As the shirt tails peeled back, it became clear the wound was not from a knife. “Sherlock... this is a bullet wound.” John said quietly.
) and smiled faintly. He had been flashing back to the kiss at lunch all day, revolving it in his mind palace to relive it from every angle; he wondered if he dared steal one now. From what he had observed of other couples, this was the kind of situation where not-pretend lovers would be affectionate. He scanned the room for observers – plenty of them, good - and when his gaze returned to John’s face he raised an eyebrow; question tinged with challenge. John gave the tiniest of nods, never looking away from the face above him, then tilted his head up to meet Sherlock bending down.
Sherlock was scrolling the video back and forth, looking for the clearest picture of the woman’s face, which he would then feed into the Yard’s face recognition software. When he found the frame he liked, he froze the video, and presented the image to John with a flourish like a showman. “There she is, John,” he crowed, “there’s our David, leaving Goliath dead on the ground.”
“Who do you shave for, then, if not me? Given that I prefer you clean-shaven, if you were refusing to shave for me, you would have a beard by now or that terrible mustache you had briefly years ago. Or do you mean that you don’t give me a shave? Why should you? I can do it myself, or there’s an excellent barber on Porter street who will do an outstanding straight-razor shave for a nominal-”
. It's a lovely PWP that helped form my Pavlovian response to handsome men in gorgeous suits. And their descriptions of the clothes far outstrip my own. Go read it!
Sherlock’s concern had stiffened into aloof impassivity along with John’s wooden posture. “It will be fine. They all have been asking for you to come back for ages. ‘Where’s John? When’s he coming back to wrangle you for us? You’re so tetchy when John’s not here!’ Bah!” His friend’s lean arms waved and he rocked back and forth along with his squeaky-voiced imitation of the Yarders’ complaints.
Lady Grey nonchalantly walked around from behind the platform in yet another costume change, this time into a deep red cocktail dress covered with glittering silver beadwork on the form-fitting bodice and tight sleeves, paired with a full, drapey, asymmetrical-line skirt of some diaphanous stuff that swung and flared with each step she took. On her feet were a pair of criss-crossing, thin-strapped, spike-heeled, peep-toe, rhinestone-encrusted platform sandals. The shoes were stunning, the outfit was stunning; Sherlock couldn’t look anywhere but at Lady Grey in her element. He hurriedly sat on his hands when he noticed he had been pressing the heel of his palm hard against his erection.
John looked out over the site, revolving on his toes to see the whole surrounding area. The hulking ironwork caught his eye as the clearest line of sight, but it seemed terribly exposed. He said as much to Sherlock, who strode purposefully in that direction before he had finished speaking. John hurried to catch up to him, cursing his shorter stride. “Oi! Wait up, there!”
“Matthew Matteo Gallo, recently of New York. Hmm,” Sherlock’s eyes flicked rapidly over the file, absorbing details at a glance, then handing the folder to John so he could catch up. “An associate of Luca Romano, perhaps?”
The light was too bright; it bled through his eyelids in a reddish glow, and the beeping sound was speeding up. His tongue was dry, his throat was sore. Had he been ill? Caught a fever, maybe? He tried to summon some saliva to his mouth, with little success. His eyes fluttered open, then squinted immediately closed against the searing light.
John, in his wisdom, had offered his hand for inspection and manipulation almost as soon as the service began and that had occupied Sherlock for a bit, since he was sitting on the other side which meant it was the hand he hadn’t had a chance at yet. But that was hours, ages, eternity ago! How long did it take to say “Do you? Yes. Do you? Yes. Sign here.” No, people had to drown in sentiment and flowery language and waste entire years of people’s lives blathering on when said people could be dragging their infuriating flatmate somewhere quiet to demand explanations. And possibly kisses.
Sherlock popped back upright in the chair and rubbed his hands together. “Alright then, what shall we do? There’s sure to be some kind of intrigue happening here that we can ferret out, and that will keep us pleasantly occupied for a little while at least.”
With a snarl, Sherlock hurled his phone into the seat of his leather chair and petulantly threw himself down on the sofa to sulk.
This must be the email John had mentioned weeks ago, from his cousin-relative-woman. While the text certainly didn’t indicate much grief on the part of the widow, Sherlock couldn’t see anything that would explain John’s reluctance to hear from her. And while he had managed to answer his Aunt within a day or two of her email, he clearly had not answered this one yet. Why not? Perhaps John was uncomfortable with how unaffected Marjorie seemed by her widowhood, when John himself had struggled to come to grips with his own bereavement. Of course, there is quite a difference between losing a spouse to an illness, and the horrendous events John had endured. Perhaps it was difficult for him to be reminded of it like this.
“Well, her husband’s died recently. Marjorie’s husband, I mean, not my Uncle Tim. Two weeks ago, rather sudden; an illness over a month or so. She’s only a few years younger than me, and he was right around my age. Brilliant bloke, chemistry researcher of some kind. I only met him once, when I got back from Afghanistan. We didn’t really have anything to talk about, but he seemed devoted to Marjorie.” John blew out a breath. “It’s a shame, that; I should probably send a card or something. Poor Marjorie.”
John cleared his throat, flustered for a moment. “Thinking about taking Rosie to school in a few years,” he offered, carefully not mentioning the domestically settled flavor to his thoughts of Sherlock.
“No, Sherlock, just now I don’t want to... just go, Sherlock. Go home, get some sleep.” John pressed the button to lower the head of the bed; when he was laid flat again, he heaved onto his side, back turned to his friend. Silence fell for another moment, then a tentative hand landed on his shoulder. He shook it off.
"Just!" John got hold of himself. "Just," he continued more calmly, "compose yourself. Um, do whatever it is you do when you go to your mind palace, only wait at the door, don't go in." It was Sherlock's turn to raise a sarcastic eyebrow. John plowed on. "Now, wait there a moment. Be still. The version of this that worked best for me was to focus on physical sensations." He leaned forward and spoke more slowly, more softly. "Pay attention to your body resting on the chair. To your feet resting on the floor. What does that feel like? As you breathe, feel your rib cage expand and relax. What does that feel like? Pay attention to those sensations."
Sherlock covered John’s hand with his own, putting down his tea to do so. His palm was warm and dry, and pressed John’s smaller hand firmly. “I remember,” he said softly. His gaze turned to John, pinning him with the pale-eyed stare that always seemed to see so much. “And so should you.”
John forestalled him with a ‘talk to the hand’ gesture. “Look, I am not going to discuss this anymore, until I’ve had a chance to think it through - thoroughly, and with the assistance of my therapist. That’s what he’s for, yeah? Let him earn his pay.” He crossed his arms over his chest and set his face implacably.
Safe. Cocooned away from the real world and protected from the problems that had brought him low. “Better,” he hedged, “why are you asking?” He thought he knew, and he licked his lips nervously.
Sherlock was sure that something about what had happened yesterday was bothering John, and that could only mean he was second-guessing their ruse and its ramifications. He pressed his steepled fingers against his bottom lip (which John had bestowed with its own, personal kiss yesterday before moving to his upper – irrelevant to the matter!) He wasn’t worried; far from it – he just had a touch of indigestion. Or was hungry, or something equally ridiculous. Certainly not concerned about John changing his mind.
A half hour later, Sherlock was absorbed in an increasingly interesting conversation about John’s escapades as rugby captain in secondary school (there were pictures! Of John, in the uniform! Probably muddy… He must convince Aunt Brigid to send them to him.) and what he was like as a young man. John never let go of Sherlock’s hand unless it was to stroke his forearm or put his arm around lean shoulders, like he thought he needed to keep contact or their new understanding would evaporate. Sherlock didn’t mind; he occasionally found himself shooting John a look that said “really? This is us now?” and meeting the same look in his (more than) friend’s eyes. Sherlock couldn’t remember ever feeling so marvelous without chemical help.
John couldn’t stop staring at the hook as Duck walked. His curiosity got the better of him as they strolled to the doors, and he blurted “Can I ask you some questions? About your leg, I mean?”
John barely flinched; years of familiarity with Sherlock’s interrogations serving him well. “Eventually, yes. Not yet.”
The song ended, and the DJ announced the next phase of wedding obligations would be coming up: cake, first dances, and the throwing of the bouquet. Sherlock barely registered it.
Sherlock rolled his eyes and groaned. “You are the one wearing a shirt with my name on it, John, why don’t you tell me what the hell I’m talking about?”
Lady Grey languidly raised a wet-latex leg, all the way up to the motorcycle bloke’s shoulder as she drawled
John looked him in the eye for a full minute, judging his sincerity; then he smiled that lopsided smile that wrung Sherlock’s heart, and stood up briskly. “All right then. Shall we?” He indicated the door.
This is for the best, believe me. I am a danger to you, to Rosie, to everyone. I know that now - I show it every time I react with violence to the ones I love. I almost hit my baby daughter for acting like a baby. I lost control and nearly murdered a suspect. I beat you practically to death, there on the floor in Culverton’s morgue, and then almost killed you again in my sleep just the other month. Tonight I shot you when you tried to protect me. Something is wrong with me; I hurt people. Maybe it was broken in Afghanistan, maybe it was beaten into me by my bastard of an old man, who knows? It doesn’t matter. I can’t allow anything like that to happen ever again, Sherlock. It’s not right that you should suffer so because of me, or that I should hurt people because I can’t cope.
John looked at Sherlock with astonishment. “Don’t judge? Sherlock, by any objective standard, after what I’ve done to you, you should be running as fast and as far as you can. Why? Why on Earth are you still here?” John’s anguish resurged forcefully, and his expression twisted with it; regret, self-loathing, anger all mixed together in a poisonous stew. He hunched forward and hid his face behind his hands as his eyes filled to overflowing.
“Just a moment, I’m not quite…” John hurried to finish reading what data there was in the file. Sherlock often referenced things from the reports and expected John to understand what he was talking about even if John hadn’t seen them, so he took advantage while he could. When he finished, he closed the folder and dropped it on Lestrade’s desk, catching a charged look between the other two in the room. “What?”
They arrived at the construction site a short time later. It was a grim place, with a chain-link fence surrounding a large area peppered with piles of rubble left from a demolished building, and the lonely silhouette of the new building’s unfinished iron skeleton rising four stories above their heads. Work had been halted while the initial investigation proceeded. A glowering foreman let them through the gate with poorly-concealed impatience, prompting Sherlock to sneer frostily as they entered. John hoped the foreman wouldn’t stick around; the last thing they needed was Sherlock getting the bloke’s knickers in a twist because he didn’t like his attitude.
John navigated through the next hours on autopilot: answering Lestrade’s questions when Sherlock didn’t deflect them quickly enough; drinking terrible tea at the Yard while Sherlock outlined the evidence of the case; cleaning and bandaging his knuckles with the first aid kit Lestrade kept in his desk once they had stopped bleeding. He kept pressing on them, feeling the pain as a distant thing, bringing him back into the moment so he could focus on the things he had to do.
“I had a hard time coming to grips with the idea, and I thought a run might clear my head. So I went for one - only made it two laps, I’ll have you know. Came back in not having made much progress, to find Sherlock and two night nurses tearing my room apart looking for hints as to where I could have gone.”
“Ha, and there’s the rub, what if I had killed you? I’d have to live with that for the rest of my life. Which wouldn’t be a long time, I don’t expect. Probably for the best...” John trailed off, the ire draining out of him like water.
Sherlock had watched all this bemusedly, and now observed John’s approach with a sparkle of mirth in his eyes. “How very safety-conscious, doctor,” he stated gravely. “You look smashing in that getup.”
She leaned back against the console of the motorcycle, languidly draping her arms along the handlebars as the dancer leaned in to mouth at her collarbones and the platform rotated them away. Sherlock resettled in his chair once more, and vowed to erase any and all traces of the silver-haired Lothario who dared put his lips on - even near - his lover’s skin, when he next had John in his bed. Which would need to be soon, or he might do himself an injury.
“Well,” John said, pitching his duffel into the closet to land where it would, “let’s go see Rosie, hmm?” Sherlock remained where he was, looking intently at John as he crossed toward the exit. John stopped a few paces before he would have to push past, and eyed the tall form wryly. “Blocking the doorway, Sherlock,” he gestured for his friend to precede him from the room.
His brow creased; something had been odd about the quick visual perusal he had made on his beeline from door to loo, but he couldn’t quite place it.
“Got it in one. A mortar round landed right in front of me and took off my foot in an instant, then shrapnel ricocheted off the building beside us into my throat." Duck spoke matter-of-factly, not particularly fussed about discussing what must have been a devastating event at the time. "Your RAMC blokes had me in the ambulance and on my way to hospital for surgery in less than fifteen minutes; it’s part of why I healed up as well as I did. I talked to one of the blokes later; he came to check on me after I was out of the operating theater. Said I should have bled out right there, but for that they could chuck me straight into transport. I’m one lucky bastard, right enough.” He pushed the door to the garden open, enveloping them in humid floral-scented air. The weather had returned to London drab after yesterday’s bright sunlight, but it didn’t look like it would rain in the next little while.
“Mrph... wha time ‘sit?” John rolled over in his bed, squinting at the red digits on the nightstand. 3:09 AM glowed indifferently back at him. He had become much too familiar with this time of night since Mary died.
Sherlock had doffed his coat and laid it over a chair, so John’s hands around his back rested on the smooth cotton of his dress shirt. Body heat bled through almost immediately, and John felt strong muscles adjusting to their position under his palms. Unaccountably he imagined flexing his fingers, squeezing into the muscles and feeling their tensile response. He shook the thought away, gave a full-armed squeeze and stepped back. His chest felt abruptly cool.
He had to acknowledge it was possible. He thought back to those times with James that had sparked this whole discussion. Had he been mistaking arousal for an unusual kind of camaraderie? He pictured James - not the cynical, damaged man he had become, who John had seen at his wedding; but the robust, leonine soldier with the dust of battle still in his hair as he held John through his shuddering reactions to the horrors they had seen.
Tea made, they each sat back in their chairs, more composed. Sherlock nodded, indicating John should continue speaking. John couldn’t contain the flush that crept up from his neck, and looked intently into his mug. “So, Marjorie. She was twenty-one, I was twenty-three. She had been nursing a crush on me for some time apparently, and at my Aunt’s wedding to her father, we got drunk and she confessed it to me. Asked if there was any way I would consider … being with her.” John looked up from under his brows to see if Sherlock caught his meaning, then scrutinized his mug again.
John thought, wishing he too could have a decent stretch. His legs still felt weak, and exhaustion kept him supine, though the bed had been raised so he could sit up.
They had made it to the train station with plenty of time, after stopping for an early dinner at Angelo’s. Never had Sherlock been so hyper-aware of his proximity to John while at a restaurant. They were practically on top of each other! He was not able to decide where to put his hands until the food came and he could be occupied with his utensils. At one point, he extended a leg under the table, and entirely by accident slid his foot along John’s ankle. John fixed him with a perplexed eye and asked if they were still practicing? Sherlock had brazened it out, stating one couldn’t be too prepared, and hidden his blush behind his fringe while attending to his plate.
He sat up and scrabbled for his phone on the bedside table to check the time. It had gone half ten! Bright sunshine shone through the window and illuminated his text notification. It was from John. - ‘You were out cold and clearly needed the rest. I’ve gone to find breakfast and have a look around the hotel. Text when you wake up.’
“You’re so gorgeous,” John breathed as he pulled back a moment, looking at the man beneath him, tousled and panting.
John could tell Sherlock’s eyes were rolling from the first moment he saw the woman by the quality of the annoyed breath the man drew in when she bustled into the room John had been assigned. (It was indeed a single, and John didn’t know what strings were pulled or how much money Mycroft had sunk into securing it for him, but he guessed he owed the man a
John’s email alert bleeped, and his eyes snapped back to the screen. “Speak of the devil,” he mused. “Marjorie’s sent me an email.” He hesitated a moment, then opened it.
“I didn’t, either,” John said, then hurried on as Sherlock’s face began to go pale with chagrin, “until recently! Um, I mean, it wasn’t until recently that I… yeah. That I realized. That… this.”
Duck laughed, which sounded painful with his ruined voice, except that his face was so joyful. Despite himself John chuckled too, shaking his head. When they had calmed, Duck indicated that John should join him out in the clear space at the side of the room. “Come on, gotta stretch out your legs, or you’ll be groaning in the morning. And then you can tell me what you want to about this Sherlock, and the people in your life.”
John snorted. “Well, you’ll look bloody fantastic in it too, you prat. You’ll have to take off your coat,” John had come up next to Sherlock by the first vertical beam of several that made up the building’s skeleton, and held out the harness he had brought. “This won’t fit correctly over all that wool.”
John felt a leaden tightness in his chest, that stayed with him for the rest of the day; but if anyone noticed, they didn’t comment.
Lady Grey intoned with the track, and snaked a hand around the back of the dancer’s neck into the auburn waves at his nape. She turned her head to address the audience again while a few twangy guitar notes sounded, holding the tension until she snatched the umbrella from the dancer -
John was pulled along in Sherlock’s wake, maintaining a decent facade of enjoyment and interest in the case while behind his eyes the thick feeling of being removed, of disengaging from the moment like he was padded in cotton wool, dogged his every step. More than once he snapped back to alertness having gone down a path in his mind to Sherlock’s dead face from his dream, or thinking about the corpse at their feet.
Greg coughed a rueful chuckle as he gathered his own coat and locked the office. “Yeah, I’m definitely glad you’re back. That’s the nicest he’s been in weeks. See you there?” Greg walked backwards toward the staircase to the parking area, grinning and shooting a cheeky finger-gun at John.
The noise of the crowd spiked over by the door leading from backstage to the house, whoops and applause ringing loud. Sherlock saw some of the performers trickling in for their chance to mingle with the guests, something Irene insisted upon every night. Irene herself, still in her spangly ringmaster’s get-up, was escorting Lady Grey in a straight line toward Sherlock’s table like it was her only mission in life to get them to each other as quickly as possible. Sherlock stood to receive them, suddenly breathless again as the Lady drew near.
“I am so glad you’re joining the family,” he gasped as he regained his composure and pressed Clara into a hug.
"And there's why I hide the clip to my gun. You still haven't fixed the wall." John turned nonchalantly away from Sherlock, hoping he had not already given away that the clip was in his pocket. John knew better than to hide it in the flat where there was the slightest chance Sherlock could find it.
Abruptly Sherlock lurched forward and wrapped John tightly in his long arms, breathing a sigh that sounded very like John’s name against the top of his head. He heaved deep breaths in and out, and John could feel the tension wound tight in the body that held him. The doctor and father in him couldn’t help but try to soothe, speaking in a crooning singsong. “Hey now, Sherlock, it’s all right. I’m all right.” His own arms had come up around his lanky friend, so he rubbed one hand up and down against Sherlock’s spine and returned the hug firmly until he felt the muscles under his hands lose some of their thrumming rigidity.
A strong hand squeezed his shoulder, and he looked over to see Sherlock showing his soft, barely-there smile, pale eyes shining. “She missed you, I think.”
“So, it was Sherlock, of course, coming to see me with this case he’s working on, and he bursts in on me in the sauna and completely derails my thinking, and then must have given himself a touch of heat stroke by standing in there in his wool coat and clothes because he’s flushed and sweating, but god forbid he take a moment to have a drink of water. Then he gets a case and buggers off again to look the crime scene over before the rains, and we’re texting.” John realized his words have sped up with his pacing, as though by speeding the delivery he can make them easier to say. Might be working, at that. “And then there’s this lull. And I’m thinking again, about how I hadn’t finished thinking before, so I…” he scrubbed his hair especially fervently and turned to look out the window, conveniently putting Duck out of view. “I looked at some… pictures. And had - er, a,
In the bathroom, a bored attendant told him John had come in, done the necessary, and left again. Sherlock left without thanking him, heading back to the hall; perhaps they had just missed each other? He went to the bar, but the bartender hadn’t seen John, or didn’t remember if he did – people had been packed two deep there all day. Sherlock jumped up on a chair then stepped up on a table to better scan the room over the heads of the guests. No silvering head in sight. “John!” he shouted over the din. Several male heads turned inquiringly, but none were his John. He growled and jumped back to the floor while nearby guests tutted and snickered.
