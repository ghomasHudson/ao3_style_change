“Tony?” Steve repeated to get his attention.
“I’ve already told you, Tony,” Abrams said, sounding exasperated, “you have multiple fractures and…”
Bucky’s face lit up. “Really?” He asked looking between them. “What kind of plans?”
Both James and Steve laughed at this. Tony really liked the sound.
Tony looked down over Steve’s body and noted that he was also nicely dressed and so adorably handsome Tony could kiss him breathless. He smiled at the blonde. “You’re right. I hope Francesco has our usual table available.”
Steve swallowed as he turned to look at the fire below them and the space he’d have to cross.
“Ya know, with her roommates?” he finished in what he hoped was a casual tone.
Bucky pulled away just enough to rest his forehead against Tony’s. His hand moved to hold the back of Tony’s neck as he panted short breaths against his lips. “You didn’t push me away.”
Tony shrugged, hating the fact that he was already having to lie to Bucky. “Well, they didn’t give me much choice. They wanted to keep me there covered in plaster when none of my bones were even broken.”
Bucky lifted his eyes, and Tony thought of how vulnerable he looked. “Tony, I…I’m sorry. I don’t know what to do.”
“You made eggnog?” Steve asked surprised.
Bucky suppressed a shudder and reminded himself that she hadn’t known. That she had worked alongside Steve to bring down HYDRA. He reminded himself that Barton also hated the thought of someone’s will being taken from them. That he had suffered from that too.
P.S. Besides the reasons he gave, I also like to think that Colonel Phillips was so keen to change Tony's name because he just hated the idea of dealing with two Starks, haha
One or both of them gave a small cry that was probably lost in the noise of the fight when Tony took a hit to the face, but it didn’t seem to slow him even as his knee hit the ground. Punches and spinning kicks and more punches, and then it was just him and Joe.
“My sweet boy,” Tony panted as he picked up the pace, fucking into him harder and faster. “Both my boys laying under me, letting me take care of them. I love you so much.”
“At least you can admit it,” Gabe sighed before rubbing his face.
It sounded like Bucky’s date wasn’t over yet. Tony awkwardly looked at Steve. Who looked just as awkward but shrugged, like this was something of a usual occurrence. Steve just sighed quietly and went over to the couch where Tony was still standing. He grabbed his sketchpad and started doodling, obviously trying to ignore the sounds still coming from the other room.
He felt Steve’s arms tighten around him as Steve shook against him and choked out a sob, “Don’t. Don’t do that, love. It wasn’t your fault. It wasn’t your fault. God, I…I love you so much. I’m here for you now. I’ll take care of you. I promise, Bucky. I’m just so…,” Steve’s voice broke, “I can’t believe I get to hold you again. I missed you. I missed you so much.”
“When I found you and brought you here, you had every reason not to care about anyone but yourself, but you still cared about me without knowing why. That’s how good a person you are, love. With all the pain and damage you were dealing with, you still cared about my pain and tried in the only ways you knew how to make it better. Just because I was still hurting doesn’t mean that you failed.”
Natasha continued, “The beard must have been to hide his features. It does a good job of it. If I didn’t know this was him, it would be hard to make the connection.”
As they ran along the roof towards the main complex, Tony got its dimensional reading and was struck by its massive size and ominous appearance. It was like a modern-day Black Gate of Mordor. They finally found their way to a hatch that let them inside the building. They moved along until they found another door. Through its opaque window they could see the silhouette of the factory floor behind it along with a guard.
“We really don’t want to think about that anymore. We worried about it all day.” Steve said. “We’d rather move forward and talk about something that makes us happy.”
as he said
Francesco chuckled. “You are mia famiglia either way Tony.” He looked to Steve and Bucky. “You as well, my friends.”
Tony’s smiled widened, “That’s amazing, sweetheart! I told you that you were a wonderful teacher.”
It was a cold afternoon in the second week of January, and Tony was currently walking up 73
Steve looked to the others and saw that they were all nodding in agreement. “Okay. I’ve got the meat and spices already mixed in that bowl if Sam and Clint want to roll them into the meatballs. Bruce if you don’t mind handling the sauce, I’ve got everything measured out next to the pot. You can add them together and put on the heat, stirring occasionally. Natasha,” he turned to look at her, “you can cook down the veggies in a separate pan before we add it to the tomato sauce. Just don’t rinse it out. I want to use the flavored oil at the bottom to cook the meatballs in.”
Tony could be scary sometimes. You know, when he wanted to be.
Tony was ineligible because of his previous wounds and reduced lung capacity, and Steve was denied for every other reason. Bucky, of course, was accepted, and his name and information would be transferred to the armed forces. He could be sent a letter and shipped off to boot camp at any time they chose.
The only reason they’d been able to fight their way out was because another group of surviving American soldiers had heard the gunfire and come to their aid. Though truthfully, the other group hadn’t been in better condition than Bucky’s, but the surprise of their arrival was just enough of an advantage to get the Germans to fall back. Now they were being hunted.
Steve’s head fell back as he bit his lip, but that was nothing compared to the feeling of Tony sucking on the tip of him, using his tongue to play with the foreskin. “Fuck!” He cursed through gritted teeth. It shouldn’t feel this intense, and Steve wondered how much of it was because of his new body, or was it because this was so different from what he was used to?
Bucky and Steve both scrambled forward and flung their arms around him, cocooning him in warmth. “We love you, Tony.” Bucky said thickly.
“Eccelente!” Martinelli exclaimed as Steve and Bucky took their seats. “A celebration! Congratulations, Mr. Barnes.”
“There is if you get arrested for it,” Bucky said softly, eyes cast down unable to meet Tony’s. “I know you don’t seem to have a problem with it like a lot of people do. Even if you didn’t have a problem, it still doesn’t mean you’d want to be kissed by some fella.” He looked up at Tony. “But I heard what you told Joe in the alley, and I couldn’t stop thinking about why’d you’d say something like that. Then I saw your face when Steve fell in your lap, how you looked at him and leaned in like you were gonna…So I took a chance.”
As Tony lay there with both of his boys cuddled against him, all he could wonder was how long he would get to have this before it was taken away. First with Bucky and then with Steve, they would be called away by destiny or fate or some other bullshit force of the universe that didn’t care who lived or died.
Nodding, Steve said. “It looks wonderful. I haven’t had mince pies since my ma was alive.”
Tony listened as Bucky vented his fear of Steve going to war, trying to persuade him to stay and find some other way to help. Steve, of course, was having none of it. While the two continued their argument, Tony saw Erskine slowly moving forward as he tried to eavesdrop on the younger men. Tony hoped he liked what he was hearing
. Him, Tony Stark. Scarred, middle aged, blue collar Tony Stark. Tony had never cried because of happiness, but he seriously felt that he could at this moment.
“Well,” Tony added, “if I ever have to be away for a night, you could invite Ruth to dinner. I’m sure she’d love that.”
“Of course, Steve,” Tony replied as he set his book to the side and met his eyes. Steve could have sworn that some of the warmth that had once lived in their depths had faded, but he carried on. He needed to tell Tony what he’d done.
“You heard.” Tony said as he felt the despair from that realization settle through him.
Steve had apologized to him that they would have to wait a little longer to start asking around for news about the 107th but promised they would start right after the show. Tony just nodded his head and ignored everything around him.
And he took
“No, I meant a hotel.” Tony said, frankly.
“Stevie,” Bucky murmured, “look at me.”
“Besides, I hate to think that you came all this way for nothing,” she continued, seeming to pause for effect. “Think of this as your
“Go with your Daddy and lay down on your stomach with your arms stretched out, love,” Steve said as he moved to grab something from a bag, and that was an order he was happy to listen to.
“That’s amazing, baby.” Tony beamed at him. “Soon enough you’ll have at least one work of art in over half the businesses in the surrounding area.”
As much as a part of Steve wanted to just spend the next few hours with Bucky’s head on his lap again, Steve also wanted to do something useful and help Tony.
Tony had had a flashback to so many instances in his childhood when he’d gone into Howard’s lab, hoping he would be allowed to watch or help his father with something, only for Howard to say exactly that and evict Tony from his workspace. He’d stopped trying by the time he turned eight, having learned that his father saw him as a distraction, at best, or a nuisance, at worst.
“Bruce,” he said quietly, getting the man’s attention before taking a breath and finishing, “last night, we remembered something about Tony.”
“No, Dum,” he told him as he met his eyes. “Just…don’t, please.”
“Morally self-righteous to end there, huh Steve?” Bucky chided.
When Tony was finished with the paper, he folded and laid it to the side on a small table where the lamp sat. He sat up to stretch, earning himself a loud pop from one of the middle vertebrae. He looked over to James who appeared to be on his last sock, then down to Steve.
“Bucky, can you hear me?”
, and Tony was struck by the title as well as the plot. A robot that was somehow accidentally created with telepathic abilities could hear the thoughts of it’s human masters. The First Law of Robotics still applied, however, so when the robot was questioned on the thoughts of the human’s coworkers, the robot felt compelled to lie to protect the feelings of the human and avoid causing them unnecessary pain that the truth would bring.
Natasha was the one who spoke from the corner. “If what you’re seeing is real, and Stark has actually been sent into your past somehow, I don’t see how we can get him back without the person who caused this. It seems most likely that it was magic of some kind, but without Strange we can’t even confirm that.”
“I’m pretty sure the other prisoners did it,” Tony told him as they made it to the wall’s opening. “We just need to catch up with them, and I’ll get you patched up, sweetheart.”
“Never you, Tony.” Steve answered as he looked into his eyes.
“Right on time.” The man was Michael Walsh. Tony had talked to him a few times over the last couple of months and made an agreement with him that for his help with this, Tony would build toys for his three children for Christmas. It was a good deal for both of them. “I just finished wrapping the gifts.”
“Wow,” Steve breathed, “you rescued yourself.” Bucky’s eyes were like saucers.
Smooth olive skin, dark hair and familiar intelligent brown eyes stared out from a young Howard Stark’s face. “Hey doc,” he called as he removed the welder’s mask from his head and moved to set it and the torch in his other hand on the closest worktable. “It’s good you’re here. I’ve almost got the outer frame finished, and I wanted to talk with you again about the amount of energy this thing is going to be channeling.”
“She, uh, she pushed up her dress and sat in my lap. Kept whisperin’ how she liked my eyes and could tell I was an artist because my hands were perfect and…” He coughed. “She took my hand and put it between her legs, under her dress, and kept murmuring
Steve took the empty glass and set it on the dresser as Tony relaxed against his pillow. The two younger men stripped down to their undershirts and boxers and climbed in next to him, one on each side.
“Damn, Tony,” James exhaled, “you’ve led one hell of a life, huh? And you just keep swinging.”
When their dates were over, the evening would always end with the three of them in bed, bringing each other off in spectacular fashion. They’d all come so far, and it was the happiest Tony had ever been.
Tony abruptly found the ability to move. He silently crossed the room headed for the front door where he exited the apartment without a sound.
, a voice in his head supplied,
“You don’t understand,” Tony said desperately as he motioned to his scarred chest. “This was the price I paid for who I am. Truth is that I was broken long before I was damaged, and everyone knew it.” He practically clawed at the mass of scars. “I
“Jesus, Rogers, don’t you know how to knock!?” The Anthony Stark said loudly.
Tony chuckled, “I’d rather you didn’t. I don’t think my ego could handle that, and it’s been quite a long day.” Curious, he asked, “How old are you, anyway?”
“Tony?”
Tony was almost asleep, but his brain provided an answer anyway. A very loud NO.
Tony stared at the freshly pink skin his hand had left. “That alright, sweetheart? You OK?”
Steve’s control snapped as he loudly cut her off. “By the time he’s done that, it could be too late!”
“It wasn’t my fault,” Steve huffed, pulling his face from James’s grip. “Joe Collins was running his mouth about Margaret Murphy. You
Bucky shrugged, looking at his juice. “No dizziness. The headache is mild and easy to ignore. I’m functioning properly…I feel alright, I guess.”
“Give it time.” Tony told him confidently. “I’m sure it will come to you.”
Bucky had never been angry with Tony before, but when he saw the man do something so reckless, he wanted to rage. Those guys were dangerous. How could he do that? What was he thinking?
“He lied about who he was, why he was there.” Steve emphasized. “I realize that now, but I believed him at the time. He had helped me, and we felt bad for him, so we let him stay with us.” He looked over to Bucky. “Do you remember that?”
“You two are so beautiful,” Tony told them as he quickly put his own condom on and slicked himself up. “So fucking sexy,” he said truthfully.
It turned out that Tony was right, and he was able to get out of bed by himself. He also had to immediately sit back down in a wheelchair because rules were rules, but at least they were wheeling him
“Wanna open up the last bottle?” Bucky asked.
Tony’s face softened as he looked at his worried partner. At least Steve was worried about him leaving for the right reasons. “Steve, I told you I’m fine. Yes, I’m sore and bruised and will shamelessly exploit that when we get home and have you play nurse for me, but I don’t need to be here. You’ll see,” Tony assured him, “when the casts come off, and I walk out of here, or roll out here. They will probably insist on that silly rule about wheeling me out in a chair, but you’ll see. The images were faulty, and it made it look more serious than it was.”
Steve chuckled, probably at both Tony’s dramatics and the memory of all the times Bucky had whined the same way about someone he’d wanted to hit. “Is this man in danger? Do I have to worry about you going after him?” He teased.
“What did he say?” Tony needed the particulars if he was gonna salvage this, or kick his ass.
“It usually has the biggest bed available,” Tony said when they’d finally entered the room. Sure enough, there was a huge bed against the center of the further wall. “No pushed together twins, just enough space for all of us.”
“What?” He asked looking back up at them.
“I just didn’t think it would be
Tony wasn’t having that. Almost all of Steve’s money went to medicine and doctor’s bills. He deserved to keep something for himself.
Steve nodded, and Tony said, “Lead the way.”
“Sweetheart!” “Bucky, oh my God!”
“Good,” Barton said as he went and began to make a large amount of coffee for everyone.
. Bucky corrected himself. He supposed they were his friends, too.
“You’re so strong.” Tony told him as his hips bucked up faster. Steve was going to come on Tony’s dick
Buckle up! Tony's trying to keep from going crazy. Steve is about to be DONE with everything, and the two finally go on a little mission to rescue our favorite sweetheart. In the present Steve and Bucky talk....and there's waffles!
Bucky sighed and rubbed his face. “I don’t know, Stevie. Tony’s always been a bit of mystery, but…I’m just thankful it wasn’t worse. Fuckin’ Joe Collins pulled a knife on him!” He said looking livid. Steve understood that feeling.
“I can’t believe that you checked yourself out, Tony,” she fussed as she took his vital signs.
He turned to the others. “You speak of alternate timelines and the effects of changing your history, but it is not so with this. You mortals cling to your science, but you know nothing of magic, which is a science to itself. Stark cannot alter the course of anyone’s true destiny because it was already written when the spell was cast. The minor events of one day to another cannot change fate. He could try, and he would fail, for that is not the purpose of this spell.”
Sorry for the wait everyone. The day after my last post, I was in a pretty bad car accident that totaled my vehicle. Thankfully, no one was seriously injured, but I was a walking bruise for the rest of the week. (I still kind of am in some places) Hope you can understand that I took the rest of the week off to heal and get my head right. Thankfully, this chapter didn't require too much from me so I was able to work on it the past few days. It sets some things up that I am excited to get to, but I think it still has it's moments. Love you all, and thanks for all your patience.
“That guy is a disease,” Dugan grumbled as Bucky released his arm, convinced Dum-Dum wouldn’t run after the guy.
“Not all of us can storm a tank or drive a…No, wait. I’m sorry.” Steve looked lost on the partially set-up stage as people worked and moved around him getting ready for tonight’s show.
Steve jumped in. Repeating how Tony’s father was an inventor, (“And an asshole,” Tony interjected to Bucky’s amusement.) and that he’d learned as a child.
“Tony…” a choked off voice sounded to his right.
, he prayed. They’d lose even more men with the complications that would bring. As he felt the first drop fall, he mentally swore that was the last prayer he’d ever waste his time on. Then, he saw them.
Steve groaned on top of him. “So fucking good. Is this what you’re doing to him, love? It feels amazing.” Steve gasped as Tony pushed deeper, just as Bucky had done to him. He could feel the need to squirm, wanting more and deeper and faster, but he couldn’t ask for it. He just kept his tongue moving, a step behind Bucky every time, and surrendered.
Tony leaned forward and tapped the guys shoulder with the cigarette in his hand to make the man meet his face. “I meant everyone,” Tony told him. “I’m sorry, but I’m kind of a dick on my best day. I really don’t like sitting in one place too long, and it’s driving me up the wall. It was nothing personal. None of us want to be here, right?”
He could barely understand. He couldn’t see through his tears. He was choking. Why didn’t the voice help him?
The war has officially started! Sorry about the minor history lesson, but the nerd in me took over, and I couldn't bring myself to get rid of any of it. I'm kinda nervous about the comments I might get on this chapter, but I will still appreciate every one of them. Just be gentle. So if you need to vent, or have any questions, I check my inbox daily. Thanks guys, and I'm sorry.
Steve and Bucky returned to the kitchen and started cleaning up the mess from breakfast. Steve was still sometimes amazed at how fast Tony had picked up cooking because the man was now flourishing at it. Those pancakes were as good as any Steve had ever had, not to mention the meals Tony helped with or the Christmas dinner he’d done by himself. If Tony put his mind to something, he succeeded. Period.
When the time came for him to actually use it, hiding would no longer be an option. The biggest problem would be a power source, but he figured once the army got its head out of its ass and made Steve an actual soldier, he would be able to borrow what he needed from Howard’s lab. That was a reunion he couldn’t wait for, he thought sarcastically.
Bucky let out a strangled cry as Tony’s hand moved up to Bucky’s neglected cock. “Yes!” He moaned, “Please!”
“Like the traffic lights some places have?” Steve questioned. “Green for go? Red for stop?”
Bucky moaned against his rim, the pleasure of the new sensation caused Tony’s tongue to pause for a moment too long. Steve’s hand came down even harder this time in in two quick smacks at almost the same spot as before, and Tony almost choked from the sudden sting of it. The feeling was delicious, and the mild burn of it centered him.
They turned to look at him, his bottom half completely bare and quickly hardening at the sight before him. “God, the things I want to do to you.”
Bucky knew Tony was explaining it so that he would understand it easier, and he appreciated it.
“You don’t get to give me orders, son.” The man sternly reminded him.
Steve rolled his eyes, but the effect was ruined as the blush reappeared. “Just eat the food.”
And that was it. In one hour Congress would vote yes with an unprecedented margin. Only one representative in all of them would vote no, a woman who refused to send men into battle when she couldn’t go herself. It had not gone well for her after that. Her fellow Congressmen had booed and hissed at her.
He went over to the antique radio. Using the screwdriver he opened the back panel. The layout was simple, and it was easy to see the problem. A couple of the wires looked like they had overheated at some point and the electron tube was loose. That was easy enough to fix. Tony stood and looked around the apartment.
“You were unconscious for four days,” Steve argued, looking adorably defiant.
Tony’s shocked cry as he came was cut off by Steve’s lips as buried himself as deep as he could and released into his lover’s body. If the first orgasm had been intense, it was nothing compared to the explosion of pleasure that seemed to radiate through him. For the first time in two days, he actually felt weak as he all but collapsed on top of Tony.
**Avengers Tower**
to watch my mouth? Pot and kettle, Stevie.”
“As for you, other Stark,” he told Tony, “keep reminding him that it’s one of my soldiers who’s gonna go in that blasted contraption. If I lose a good man because of ego, the next test we do will be with one of you in the chamber. Keep him in check. Just stop being an ass about it.” He looked back at Howard. “That last order was for you too, Stark.”
“Yup, ya want something?” He walked into the kitchen that shared a wall with the bathroom. “We got eggs and bread, for toast.”
? Yeah, it’s like one of THE Zeppelin songs.” Tony was surprised. He hadn’t pegged Steve for a classic rock fan. Curious, he continued, “Did you look into any other songs of theirs?”
“So if I may ask,” Erskine continued, “what are you?”
“Just say it, Bruce.” He told the shy man across the way. “And use small words, please. Between the drugs and whatever the hell this is, I’m not at full capacity.”
This chapter turned into another long one. There's just so many more characters now. A very big Thank You to the darling Sofyie for helping me make sure Dernier actually sounds like he's from France. You've helped me make him more real.
He walked forward on his knees and lightly stroked at his cock, pulling a hiss from his gorgeous partner. Tony could sympathize with him. He didn’t tease him for too long before he tore open a condom and rolled it out over Bucky’s straining dick. He added some lube after, loosely circling his hand to spread it over the length.
Abrams stared opened mouthed at him for a few moments as Tony’s words sank in. He could see the point when the doctor rallied himself before saying, “As an employee of this hospital, you are required to stay here and…”
“Don’t talk about yourself like that,” Tony snapped, “like there’s something wrong with you. So what if you
With that, Tony put his empty bottle down on the work table and turned to leave. As he reached the door, he looked back to see Howard watching him. “Thanks for the drink, Howard, and the talk. It’s given me a lot to think about.”
Both his boys laughed at this, and the mood lightened which was good because Gianetta appeared then with their food.
“One of these places is here in New York. The people there were wary and dismissive of me at first, which was understandable. Eventually, I earned enough of their trust for them to pull back the curtain for me, for lack of a better term. They even taught me to sense a few things beyond the reality of what is perceived.”
Steve watched as all four sets of their shoulders slumped and figured he knew the answer.
“Sidekick?” Bucky asked confused, and Tony just burst out laughing.
Steve stood and said, “Yes…?”
“No, sir. It’s been hard for everyone.” Steve answered looking hurt. As if he needed reminding that the country was nearly destroyed by poverty just a few years ago.
Adding more weight to his knee on Joe’s chest, he continued, “Whatever your thinking, don’t. I promise that it will not end well for you. I’m twice your age and just beat down four of you. What you may not realize is that I was holding myself back because taking your life just isn’t worth it.”
Bucky and Steve both flinched when Tony loudly roared, “Answer me!”
Steve sighed. “Buck, you know how he is. Tony is one of the most generous people we’ve met, but I don’t think he knows what to do when generosity is given to him. It’s like he isn’t used to kindness or people taking care of him. Getting him to rest and heal is gonna be difficult.”
He watched as Steve bit on his bottom lip. Tony knew he was trying to organize what he wanted to say. It was hard for Steve to admit when he was struggling with something.
Tony answered that by undoing the last buckle, and the ground raced up to meet him. As predicted, Steve caught him effortlessly. “My hero.”
The pace was brutal, almost primal as Steve poured every ounce of worry and pain and frustration he’d tried to contain in the past few days. His muscles were singing at the chance to finally be used again, and Steve didn’t feel clumsy. He didn’t feel scared. He felt powerful. As his eyes locked with Tony’s again, he felt loved.
As the days passed, Tony was learning to cope with his panic and fear. Some moments were easier than others. It wasn’t too bad when he was busy working or talking to people around the neighborhood. He’d always done better with something to occupy his mind, and it was as true now as ever.
Despite everything, Tony was genuinely curious as to what Howard would want to say to him, so he nodded and reached out for the beer Howard was offering. He popped the cap off on the edge of a nearby worktable and watched Howard do the same before taking a long drink.
“Tony, what is that?” He asked with equal parts curiosity and caution. “You didn’t buy anything else, did you?”
Hope you enjoyed this! I'm trying to write at least a little every day, so expect one or two updates a week.
He’d just about finished the hands-on part, and all there was to do now was wait when the two had finished eating.
“Nice landing,” Tony told him, “but your dismount needs work. Now come over here and catch me, muscle man.”
Steve blushed. “No, Tony, you really don’t have to. Just open the letter.”
Steve scowled. “Tony, you honestly don’t expect me to believe that crap.”
“Why?” Steve asked.
At that moment Bucky turned his head and noticed the blonde’s absence. “Hey, where’s Steve?” Tony pretended to look confused before turning his head as if looking for something.
Tony dimly noted that they were nearing the diner as he watched the scrutiny in the German scientist’s eyes. He reminded himself to tread carefully. This was probably the smartest person he’d encountered so far in the past, and the fact that the man was a scientist meant it was his habit to observe. “Wouldn’t say brilliant, I’m just a common repairman.”
*****
Bucky actually smiled up at him. It was small, but it was real. “I know. It’s like I said, selfless but also selfish for my sake, and I’m thankful Steve. It’s so hard to deal with the conflicting memories in my head. Some are really wonderful, and others are too horrible to think about. I know I’m not going to get better overnight, but I realize that I am thankful. You need someone to care for, and I obviously need someone to help take care of me, so it works out well enough.”
The realization didn’t fix anything. It had come far too late, and the damage had already been done to Tony’s self-worth. It was the biggest reason he had hated being compared to his father. Whatever Tony’s faults, he never wanted to be capable of what Howard had put him through.
Tony went to the kitchen and got himself a glass of tap water. He was already getting used to the taste, though it had turned his stomach a little when he heard Bucky call  it “dog soup”. Really some of the phrases they used this day in age were weird. He was rinsing his glass when the radio was once again filled with static. It had been doing that all morning.
Scared eyes bulged in response.
Before Bucky even thought about it, he unholstered the gun at his thigh. He swung it around to shoot the phone Clint was holding as he tried to snap a picture of him and Steve. Clint squawked in surprise as his phone exploded in his hand, and Bucky holstered the weapon before nuzzling against Steve’s thigh again. The rest of Bucky’s body had never moved.
It didn’t fix everything. They were both still wounded. More memories would soon emerge, and Bucky knew that they would bring new emotions and realizations for both of them. But as Bucky held tight to Steve, finally accepting the comfort his friend had wanted to give him for over half a year, it was the first time since the war that he’d actually felt safe, like he was almost home.
“When did you do this?”
“Good.” Steve released his hair and stepped back. Tony then realized that Bucky was now fully naked. He guessed that Steve had told him earlier how this was going to go. While they had planned this. All day.
“Unhh, you take me so well,” he groaned as he looked down to see himself fucking into his younger lover, “and you still want more.”
“I know, you looked like you needed it quite a few times today, but I’m so proud of you, Steve. You made it through the show, and spent the day making Jacobson want cry over your poor Brooklyn accent.”
The other three nodded in agreement. Their faces showing nothing but understanding and support. Bucky felt something warm kindle in his chest for them. It was strange, but not…unpleasant.
When he’d come into Steve’s room and heard the shower running, he’d decided to just wait until the blonde was finished. What he hadn’t expected was for Steve to walk out wearing nothing but a towel. He should have. What else was Steve supposed to wear after his shower? But it had still caught him by surprise. Steve was so big.
. His mind contradicted the thought of Tony being unable to provide comfort as it showed him a new perspective to his interactions with Tony over past six months. Tony kindly explaining everything he was doing as he worked on Bucky’s arm hadn’t been from his need to constantly talk, he’d been trying to include Bucky in the maintenance and put him at ease. The fact that he’d always kept the tools out and ready, just in case Bucky showed up in his workshop, proved that Tony looked forward to helping him.
“Breathe deep, Ok?" he watched as Steve tried to obey. "I’m going to sing a song, Steve, and you’re going to try to sing with me.” He spoke with forced calm, noticing how Bucky was watching him from behind Steve, still rubbing his arms and chest. “Alright, Steve?” Steve, gasping, just nodded.
“I’ll say. They look kinda snug, but I guess that’s how they’re supposed to be.” James shrugged while shaking his head. “Why is there someone else’s name on them?”
“Pay attention,” Steve reprimanded and pulled his hair harder, making Tony’s cock jerk against Bucky’s lips. “Bucky will stop if you don’t focus on me. You are here to make me feel good.”
“Well, I’ve been told I’ve got quite the mouth myself. In any case you really should go home and rest. Which way is it?” Tony motioned for them to start walking. Steve went along with him towards the street.
If any of noticed that Erskine in the movie said 73rd Street and Utopia Parkway, and I wrote 73rd Avenue and Utopia Parkway, it's because *gasp* Marvel made a mistake. Geographically, 73rd Street is a good ways West of Utopia and runs parallel to it. 73rd Avenue, however, would be correct since it does intersect Utopia Parkway. I'm not faulting Erskine, maybe it was a simple linguistic error since English is not his native language.
“That explains why they came for him,” Gabe, Steve remembered the name, said from Tony’s other side. “I didn’t know they were in the army.”
“You got accepted.” Again, it wasn’t a question.
It made Steve wonder again what it would be like to be under Tony’s focus in bed. He turned to Bucky.
Bucky sighed, “Tony, I don’t…”
Jagged little red and white lines streaked across his chest and down his ribs. Stretch marks from where his skin was cut and pulled tight to be tucked around the reactor. Discoloration in the center of his chest from the skin graft showed where the reactor once rested, and a long surgical scar from the procedure that removed it and the remaining shrapnel. It was still raised and purple, rough where it ran over existing scars.
Steve looked at him then, and Bucky watched as his face closed up. “You get your orders?”
“It’s really not that big a deal,” Tony repeated. “I wasn’t doing anything else. I just wanted to keep busy.”
Steve was so big. Bucky couldn’t understand any of this.
Erskine stood in the center of the room. He smiled kindly at Steve before saying, “Good evening, Steven. If you would allow, there is something I would like to discuss with you.”
He remembered the three of them walking in the park after their meal, continuing their conversation from dinner and catching up on all the little things that had been left out of their letters. He remembered all of them going home after. He remembered Tony and Steve backing him into the wall and kissing him on his mouth, his neck, his chest. He remembered the warm feeling of their lips, the gentle slide of their fingers as they moved over his skin.
The pain was becoming a distant memory. It felt so good. Everything felt good, and Bucky’s body was starting to lightly tremble from the combination of their words and their hands. All of his nerves were singing, and he could feel his need building even as he wanted to just let this last forever. The choice between desire and comfort was beginning to circle in his mind, but the decision was made for him when he finally felt a finger at his opening. With his eyes closed, he didn’t know who it belonged to, but it didn’t matter, he just wanted to be filled. He wanted to willingly surrender his body to someone who loved him.
He waited for Bucky to obey before he looked at Steve. “I want to watch him suck your dick. He sounded amazing at it.”
She was in front of him now and smirking as she looked into his eyes. Was she being playful? “You’re late.” She said, and yes, she was trying to be playful.
“You need a girl, Stevie, and staying in every weekend isn’t going to get you one.”
Bucky had listened to the awful list of things Steve had recited while clearly trying to hold himself together. Bucky hadn’t been able fault him for it because at that moment he’d felt like his world had tilted. He’d lived the next four a days a wreck of worried and frustrated feelings until Steve had called him again to give him incredible news. Tony was awake, and the doctors had been wrong about how bad his injuries were, and he was leaving the hospital.
Tony balked at that. He hated hospitals. “No, it’s fine.” He panted as the adrenaline faded. He knew a crash was coming soon. “It’s only a scratch. I’ve had worse.”
“Yet.” Tony corrected. “I don’t have a job
They walked into the apartment. Both of them quiet because the walls were thin, and they didn’t want to wake the neighbors. Tony was headed to his couch and Steve to the bathroom when they heard a woman moan. It was followed by a man’s voice murmuring words too low to hear. Both their heads whipped around to look at the bedroom door.
“I’ll always want you, doll.” Bucky said with his trademark smile and eyes twinkling.
Bucky groaned.
“Yes,” Steve nodded because he did. The feeling was always so incredible when he saw just how much Bucky got off from Steve giving him what he wanted, whether it was using him or embarrassing him a little with the things he said. Steve loved Bucky’s reactions.
Steve had caught him sometimes mumbling under his breath, hearing Bucky’s name more than a few times, as he’d absentmindedly rubbed at the middle of his chest. When Steve had asked him about it, all the other man would say was that he didn’t like the open water. More lies. Steve loved Tony, he did, but being shut out hurt sometimes and frustrated him most of the time. If Tony was worried, Steve wished he would talk about it.
“Yes, doctor” Tony grunts out, just as Steve presses his cockhead inside. Tony still can’t get over how hot and wonderful Steve feels inside him. Six weeks of condoms has really given him a renewed appreciation for it, and he groans loudly as Steve fully seats himself inside, filling him.
“Thor, are you okay?” Steve asks.
Scott falls into parade rest, and puts his hand over his heart. Peter following suit.
, and I need to be really clear with you about what we’ve done and what I want. Do you understand?”
Steve breaths hot against Tony’s chest, pausing to look up at him. “I’m going to take care of you, Tony.”
He bends down to grasp the handle anyway. A normal hammer would slide easily in the loose mud, but of course it doesn’t budge. He can’t give up, and focuses everything on lifting it, bracing himself on his knees and pulling upward with all his might.
But he holds still as a green beam of light scans over his head for several long seconds and then down his body.
“I think we need to tell the team sooner, rather than later, Tony.”
Thanos, delirious from pain and shock at his defeat simply slumps over, bound by Wanda’s magic and the entire remaining contents of Peter’s web shooters.
Steve is so out of his depth he feels the urge to drop to his knees again.
“Then why now? Why with me?”
Steve nods.
Steve reflects that may be because both Pepper and Scott found out by accident, watching their intimate moments and not through any sort of planned discussion...
He makes his way through a familiar hallway which only has muted emergency lighting on the floor, the kind you’d see in an airplane. At the end of the hall is the elevator that connects directly to the Avenger’s levels, the executive Stark Industries floors, even Tony’s penthouse. The area around the elevator is lit more brightly and looks like it belongs in a four-star hotel. Steve always thought it was very Tony that a secret elevator that only the Avengers would see is still decked out with ornate trim, decorative lighting and sleek finishings. The way the hall and elevator are laid out there’s no chance of seeing any of it out on the street. It’s just fancy for the sake of it; it probably cost more than most people’s cars to decorate this secret entrance that hardly anyone will ever see.
I love the idea of Rocket slowly coming around to Tony. And Thor has become such a fun character in the MCU, he is absolutely fucking with Steve here 😂
“Uh, let’s see,” Rhodes starts ticking things off on his fingers. “Snuck into the army after being rejected over and over, signed up for an untested serum, crashed a plane into the ocean, leader of the Howling Commandos, took no shit from Nick Fury, best friends with the Winter Soldier, took down SHIELD almost single-handedly, dating Tony Stark.” He pops the rest of his fingers up in a mock explosion as he says “And that’s just the shit I know about.”
It’s a thank you for letting him up to the penthouse tonight. For listening. For working to make things better. For understanding. For accepting Steve.
Steve nods and touches his hear. “Scott, when you have a moment could you meet Tony and I in the common area?”
is ready.
“Please.”
Tony speeds up, imagining Steve watching him, knowing that Steve’s the reason he’s so fucking hard he could die. Even in his fantasy he doesn’t want to rush Steve. He wants Steve to come to him. Steve would walk into the shower, not sure what he was doing until he was pressed up behind Tony, water slowly soaking into his t-shirt and boxers. He’d rest his hands on Tony’s hips as Tony continued to work himself. Slowly, carefully fitting their bodies together.
Sam attempts to lighted the mood by saying “I’d like to announce that I’m pretty sure I’m in a relationship with that massage chair Tony has in the spa portion of the gym. Seriously, I am looking into what I need to do for it to be recognized by the state of New York.”
And maybe Tony should take some of what he is dishing out and find a good therapist in New York… and maybe get a dog.
“Keep your hands where they are, Steve,” he says and comes around to Steve’s side to slide a hand up to his face and cup his cheek. He guides Steve’s mouth down to his while sliding his other hand down to Steve’s ass. He kisses him just as he slides the tip of his finger down to caress Steve’s opening. Just a gentle touch, probing, testing how much he can slide in before he meets substantial resistance.
“I don’t know how you can expect me to react any differently, Tony. I just saw Steve
But he finishes cleaning up, and Steve’s still standing there, staring at the stool Tony vacated.
By the time they’ve been back in their routine for a couple of months, Steve has a new sense of calm about him. Tony is happy and (in part thanks to Steve) incredibly healthy. And while Tony sometimes rants mindlessly in the heat of the moment when he’s about to come about how much he needs Steve’s dick, or how hot it is that Steve’s is a part of his DNA, Steve thinks they’ve basically moved forward.
“Oh fuck, Steve!” Tony exclaims.
“You’re barefoot! Jesus Steve, this sand is too hot – what” and grabbing Steve’s hand to tug him back toward the shade of the house. “What are you doing? You want blisters your first day in Hawaii?!”
He dimly notices that the plug is a deep purple, and has glitter suspended inside it.
Tony isn’t surprised. No, he’s had Friday tracking Steve and the others for months (shocker, Vision emits the same energy signature as the stone from Loki’s staff… what did Thor call it, the mind stone… because he
“Steve, what we’ve gotten through in the last few hours alone goes a long way to fixing everything, honestly. So if you’re asking if I need something else to forgive you, to move forward, I can’t think of anything. What, were you thinking of something?”
It’s the most Steve has ever heard Pepper say at once outside of a press conference (usually because when they are together both he and Pepper are fighting to get a word in around Tony).
“Dr. Strange, can you sling-ring back to Earth from here? Is it possible to gather more of the team onto this planet?”
But then Tony is pressing against him, sliding the silky soft material of his pant leg against Steve’s length.
“Excuse me,” says the pretty bug alien, “but does your friend often
During the battle Clint reveals over the coms that Cap is dating Becky, which Tony didn’t know, and he burns his hand whilst distracted. T_T
“… it doesn’t have to be that way. You don’t always have to be the one taking on the world. You think it’s on you? It’s not. Allow someone else to take the burden, to be in control. You’ll feel so free, without its crushing pressure at your back...”
Tony gasps as Steve slides his index finger right in. There’s so much lube that it doesn’t hurt, but it does feel strangely detached, like he really is having a medical procedure. Tony groans and bears down on the finger. He slides his head to rest on the crinkled paper of the exam table and takes a deep breath.
Steve hears the sincerity in Tony’s voice. What they just did was so good, he’s not nervous to do more really… A little intimidated that Tony obviously has what can only be described as “sex settings” for his shower. It makes Steve feel like he’s this dumb kid. Which, he’s fought Nazis, and led a team of superheroes for God's sake, he knows he’s not a
After coming a second time, Steve leans forward and kisses Tony between his shoulder blades. It breaks their illusion for a moment, but Tony doesn’t mind.
God they’re going to space. They’re already
Steve leans back more into Tony’s chest. “Think about it. Or, maybe we can formulate some kind of consensus system, a democracy?” He brings his hands to rub over his eyes. “I don’t ever want to do “my way or the highway” again. Look where that got us...”
-The team (and Pepper) finds out about their relationship
That is, until he slides home all the way inside. It feels like all that effort may have been for nothing. Like tossing the ball around in the backyard to prepare for suddenly playing in the World Series.

Aiming to post the final section in two parts by the end of the weekend 😁
Steve, well Cap. Cap has someone. Someone named Becky who wears earrings… not goo and gauze and metal and pain and fuckery like a fucking cloak. Good.
Tony, Steve and Sam stare blankly.
“I’d try to protest, but I get the sense resistance is futile.” says Steve.
He’s down on his knees, and it feels right, familiar. That last dream…
Tony clears his throat and speaks in his usual rushed, cavalier tone: “Hey, long-time-no-see, drink? I’ve got water, Fanta.” He’s holding a bottle of water up, his posture relaxed and confident.
Two more chapters to go!
“My refractory period is definitely shorter, and more like it was when I was 25-30?”
Tony makes to follow him and Steve stops so abruptly that Tony almost crashes into him.
away from declaring war on anyone stronger than a professional athlete, Jarvis is dead and my tower is empty. Speaking of empty, Pepper left by the way." Tony motions to the spartan, empty penthouse.
He starts with one finger, and quickly moves on to two, stretching and scissoring them until he’s aching for more. He doesn’t linger, this isn’t the main event, he just wants Tony to see what he’s learned.
my huge relationship news before him! What was I thinking? Quick, come back to the suite, we have to call him right now.”
In fact, the whole concept has continued to dominate his thoughts, to the point that Bruce has noticed and asked in a worried tone one day if Tony is experiencing any mental impairment.
A doctor wouldn’t run into his next appointment after all.
When Bruce suggests “Hulk out?” to her with a tentative smile, everyone holds their breath.
“Good to know.” he says.
The team gathers together, and Sam rolls his eyes, “So are they all based on a different nerdy theme like Star Wars?”
Steve slides back to his knees in front of him with impossible grace, and Tony takes a minute to just look at him.
Thor looks up from his arm. “Ah Japanese food! I have tried sushi, it is some of Midgard’s most delectable food-stuffs. Do they serve sushi at this restaurant?”
(See the end of the chapter for
to come out before, especially when Bruce has been in danger. He thinks if he gets calm enough, meditates enough, he can figure out how to “fix” this.
Steve keeps up a gentle rhythm as he explores Tony’s mouth, licking at his lips, biting them. Eventually slipping his tongue in as much as the angle allows. After several long minutes Tony starts to continuously moan into his mouth. Like he is in so much pleasure there’s nothing he can do but groan, spread out against Steve’s front, arms locked on his own handrails.
dressed down to their underwear (Natasha was able to wear her usual full-body tactical gear somehow, and Tony was about 40% covered by the nano-armor in mid-application).
Steve clenches his fists where they rest on his thighs. He never talks about it. He didn’t think he would now, but it’s part of it he thinks.
“We would love some paprikash!” says Tony. “Why don’t we get everyone’s drinks while we’re up? Sam? Nat? What’s your poison?”
They portal to Wakanda to take stock, only to find that Thanos' army is assembling and beginning to test the massive forcefield that protects it.
(See the end of the chapter for
Tony is just laying back, exhausted. He looks like some kind of classical Roman painting. Beautiful. Steve's warm ejaculate makes it easy as he carefully extracts himself.
“And second, I was
Tony looks down and sees that Steve is wearing what must be the navy swimsuit from the guest room’s dresser (which, dear god, is more like a pair of navy, water-resistant boxer briefs they are so tight!). He takes a moment to ogle and smirk because of course his guests’ swimsuits would need to be more revealing than his own traditionally cut red trunks, before getting to Steve’s feet, and seeing…
The team starts noticing. Sam keeps checking in with a knowing frown. Wanda especially seems to think she can help his restless sleep… and maybe he would let her do something, take a look at his shattered mind, if not for how the dreams always end.
Tony’s mind is on overdrive thinking of all the possibilities, but seeing Steve’s shocked face reminds him he probably needs to pull back a little. Steve has only been in the 2000s for four years. He was raised in the 20s and 30s, it was a totally different time. Steve probably gets the vapors from seeing a woman's ankle, he needs to remember that... Plus he’s probably heard about Tony’s past and thinks he’s a total slut…
Steve has gently taken Tony’s ass in his two massive hands and tilted Tony’s exposed hole up to his mouth. Just an experimental brush of his tongue over the area. Soft and gentle.
Vision interjects “In puzzle strategy, starting with the corners is optimal due to-“
Steve re-focuses. He knows Tony loves to talk, and gets the sense that he also loves to hear Steve.
“Long story short, here’s what I want: I want to clean up in here on my own to make sure I’m good to go, then I want to meet you in the bedroom and let you have your way with me. I want to help you however you need, if you need instruction or direction, I’m there. But then, then I need you to open me up and take my body like you own it. I want you to own me, Steve.”
He comes up behind Tony, overwhelmed. He runs his hands up and down his back, before going lower to cup his ass. Steve spreads him wide to get a better look at the plug. Jesus, it’s big. The width a little bigger than Steve's cock is maybe, he won't be able to tell for sure until it's out.
Scott pats his arm, “Hey man, I thought it was funny…”
Tony >> Hey, respect your elders or you won’t get to be ring bearer!
It isn’t just the arousal and the lack of sleep. That he could deal with. He has been dealing with it. But
Tony looks like Christmas morning (if Christmas morning hadn’t slept in five days). “Warm, and smooth, but not wet!” he explains, rubbing his hands together. “I developed some new polymers for her body and tongue. Even the ears are extra soft!”
will, equal to yours." Strange responds, golden spells activating.
He means it. Tony can test one of his hairs if he wants. But he also means it literally; he wants Tony to take whatever he needs from him. Take him. He’s pretty sure he can’t be clearer.
. With their help we can defeat Thanos with relative ease.”
Tony nods, fuck, he isn’t the only one who has been thinking about this. Steve’s working from an obviously prepared, and highly realistic script. Tony can’t believe how in-character he is right from the start. He’s just a fucking natural. Look out Meryl Streep.
Steve and Sam have finished up and are just deciding who gets the blue one and who gets the red one (Sam – “You always get the red!” Steve – “It’s not my fault Tony insists on getting one red and one blue sports drink every time. He just likes to watch us fight, and my body burns more energy than yours…”), when a portal surrounded by golden sparks opens up right in front of them.
Tony runs his hands through Steve’s hair, slowly massaging the scalp. They stay like that for several minutes before Steve stands and they tuck each other back in (Tony’s pants are a lost cause, but he pulls them up enough that they cover the essentials. He’ll change as soon as they get upstairs).
related to my past romantic relationship with Tony. At all. You know I love you both, and the two of you… I look at you two, and you’re just… you’re perfect together. But I know kids were something Tony kept in the “maybe” column, and I was thinking that given you two are obviously in it for the long haul, maybe you’d think of this as an opportunity for the two of you as well?”
He needs Steve.
If anyone has preferences or something else they want to see, let me know. Thank you again for reading!
- Tony and Steve go camping
Pepper is looking shellshocked now. Grief tight in her chest.
Unfortunately, Steve seems to have interpreted his throat-clearing a bit differently. Before Tony can launch his sexy shower plan, Steve starts talking:
He looks up at where he thinks the camera probably is, swallowing, hoping to clear some of the tightness in his throat.
Tony steps up on to the platform and grabs the lower set of hand-holds which are about two feet above his head in either direction. He spreads his legs and looks back over his shoulder at Steve, his lean body stretched out in a tantalizing X.
stuff, Tony.”
As they took several photos with the happy couple, Tony tried not to look at Steve too much, feeling so suddenly exposed.
Steve is struck once again by how great he thinks Tony would be as a co-leader of the team. For whatever reason he’s rejected the idea so far. Maybe as the financial backer of the team he feels like it would put him into a position of too much control? Steve resolves to continue to check with Tony on all major developments. Even if he doesn’t want the official title of team leader, Steve wants him there every step of the way.
Tony shakes himself and responds. “I feel good. I think seeing it like this... Seeing you prepare before we start helps.” Tony pauses, never taking his eyes off of Steve’s cock as it continues to pump through his hand. “I’ve heard... I’ve heard sometimes the procedure can be done orally. Am I candidate for that?”
“I’m going to lift your gown and examine your torso and abdomen. Let me know if the pressure from my hands hurts or is uncomfortable.” says Steve.
“Would you
He really needs to clear this up with Tony, he knows. And he can’t keep not bringing up Becky because it might make Tony feel bad because of Pepper, or because he’s hurt… or because he wants to spend time in Hawaii with Steve.
“Someone. I’m seeing someone.”
They manage to eject Squidward and pilot the ship to Titan. Steve backs Tony’s play to meet Thanos on his own turf. New York has been a battle ground enough times in recent years. With all of them working together, Steve is hopeful they can stop Thanos here, now, before he gets any more stones.
He looks at Tony’s profile. His eyes are closed, and he appears to be doing the calming deep breathing exercises Bruce taught them a couple months ago. Tony, who is renowned for his sexual exploits, his sex tapes, his recklessness, his rule-breaking and everything else. Who just pushed him away because Steve asked to take things slow. Sticking to the arbitrary rule Steve set, after watching Steve break his own rules time and time again.
Tony narrows his eyes. “Friday, scan Steve for any foreign materials, check his brainwaves and do a full wellness check.”
Tony is breathing fast and grinning, gorgeous.
Because Steve has been kissing Tony relentlessly, and Tony’s hands are still pinned he has no way to warn Steve. He’s comes in hot waves with no warning. Crying out into Steve’s mouth.
He pulls away.
-The team (and Pepper) finds out about their relationship
“Tony, what? What the fuck?!”
He walks over to the painting (which he knows is worth at least six figures) and feels along the edge of the frame until his fingers graze a button. It can’t be seen by looking at the frame, but he can feel the slight difference in texture. Steve just barely hears a smooth “click” noise as he presses the button, and moments later the pristine wood flooring at his feet collapses into a series of steps that lead down what looks like 2-3 stories.
Once it’s all the way in, Steve twists and slides it in and out a few times before inserting it fully and going over to the trash. He removes his gloves.
Except that he was just in a car accident so it actually does hurt, and Steve ends up taking all five bags (four of them Tony’s).
Steve grins and looks away as Tony slides over to the end of the bed and conspicuously keeps his back to the bed as much as possible as he makes his way to the bathroom.
It’s late-morning when Steve wakes up. His body is singing.
Tony helps Steve lift the last of it off of him and they set the car down. Another bystander is already bending to make a tourniquet for the old man out of his tie.
Finally he makes his way into Stark’s suite. It’s about four-times bigger than where anyone else on the team is living, but Scott figures he deserves it. He’s not about to judge the guy who’s throwing free planes and security contracts at him.
The other half is on Steve, and when he can be alone with Steve, and what Steve smells like, and how Steve laughs, and
Tony leans forward and pauses, aware that not everyone loves the idea of kissing someone’s mouth that was just on their ass.
“Right, so, obviously I didn’t mean to say that.” Tony starts. And the pain on Steve’s face makes him
He continues as he fucks his own hand, voice calm like he's talking about the weather. “Usually I wouldn’t show this to you before the procedure. The size and intensity of it can be intimidating. How are you feeling?” He starts gyrating his hips with more fervor, and all Tony can think is how beautiful he is.
which puts Tony back on his heels.
“Tony, I’ll be there when I’m done, okay? Everyone is going to be gone all day.”
Quill interrogates him about Gamora with the help of Nebula and Mantis.
Scotts heartbeat increases. What?
half-hard. Tony won’t push, but if he really does get hard agan, he has some more ideas.
idea how amazing my shower is, or how excited I am to get you in there.”
Steve mentally compares this set-up to the system of secret knocks and restricted movement they’ve been using in their most recent hide-out/hovel and shakes his head. As he reaches out to place his palm on the elevator’s scanner Friday’s measured voice makes him pause.
Tony squawks at that. “I do not use botox! I’m just aging like a fine wine, nothing wrong with that!”
“Yeah, yep that sounds good. Let’s, let’s get this show on the road doc!” Tony can’t take much more before he just starts jacking himself in the middle of the exam table. He’s sure Steve could play that off, but damn, he’s more than ready to get started and have Steve touch him already.
Peter pops up next to them.
“Get yourself clean, then come to bed Tony. But don’t slick yourself up, that’s my job.” His Captain America voice has come out to match the face. Oh sweet fuck, hearing the words “slick yourself up” come out of Steve’s mouth may be the best moment of Tony’s life. All he can do is nod.
“Ruvs” her nose dips to Steve’s heart.
But he doesn’t want to give this up.
Tony physically shrinks in Steve’s hands at that. "Steve, no-"
Next up, Tony gives his bff some news. Steve struggles a bit *wibble*
Tony softens at that, sitting up to wrap his arms around Steve. “But you have a Winter Soldier and Rogues to tend to.”
Talking to Clint while they were on the run gave Scott a lot of perspective. Clint spent a lot of years balancing being a hero and a family man. Clint retiring is the right call for him, but he encouraged Scott to give The Avengers a chance (not that he needed any more encouragement). He thought about it long and hard, and decided Cassie would rather have a hero for a dad than a struggling ex-con. Plus, before Scott went on the run, he was seeing Cassie a few times a month, max. He's hoping he can be an Avenger and still see her often.
Tony examines the orb and notices a small button at the bottom. “I see a button, but it could be a decoy or trap. Cap what’s the call?”
Steve takes a deep breath. “I was thinking, after we are all cleared, I could make a public statement of apology? Or of unity if that’s better? To make sure everyone knows I believe in you, believe in the team?”
Steve looks desperately to Tony for help.
“Come on Stevia, let’s go find a cheeseburger.”
He doesn’t. Steve continues to slowly press his hands down the length of Tony’s torso, eventually stopping at the vulnerable area around the base of his errection. Steve uses both hands to press gently against the exposed area, not touching his errection, but applying light pressure where Tony's stomach meets his groin.
Fuck. Tony hastily pulls on his most comfortable loungewear. It’s loungewear, so he knows it makes him look comfortable and like he doesn’t give a shit, but in a “billionaire who can afford $20,000 fuck-you loungewear” kind of way. Plus he’s pretty sure whatever is about to happen with Steve is going to suck some hulk-sized balls, so he might as well be as comfortable as humanly possible.
Steve sighs, he sees his point. “So what are you suggesting?”
“Hmm, well my nano-tech is highly advanced, Steve. As long as there aren’t like, noxious fumes in the air, I’m pretty sure the helmet will retrack to give you access.”
Tony laughs and swipes another lick to pick up the foam on Steve’s chest before leaning forward to transfer the foam into Steve’s mouth with a tender kiss.
He closes his eyes at the confession and takes Steve’s hands that are still resting tentatively on his chest and brings them up to his mouth, brushing his lips to Steve’s knuckles.
(See the end of the chapter for
Which turns into another shower, because by then they really,
Tony huffs. “Well we don’t know
“I think maybe Hawaii wasn’t such a great idea after all, what do you say we grab some chocolate Macadamia nuts and catch a plane back home?”
“So good Tony, I uhh, can barely stop myself from pummeling into you, feels too good. Don’t want to hurt you.”
Wanda chimes is. “Yes, um, thank you for making that announcement, here in our team meeting Viz.” She gives him her own blank look before turning to address Steve. “As you say, we won’t let it affect us in the field. My powers tend to be amplified by emotion, so I’ll leave it to you to decide if and when to pair us together in heightened situations.”
Probably because he can access SHEILD’s records and see that Steve has never been late for a debrief, let alone left in the middle of one.
Thor had on nothing but his cloak streaming behind him and Stormbreaker strategically placed in front of him.
The Smoochvengers (this one is Tony’s favorite and he secretly has Friday order and save a hard copy)
like experience, which takes away the jitters of this being his first time with Tony (or with any man for that matter), but… he can’t help but feel that Tony should be telling him what to do.
Steve grabs the armor just before he goes through, and gives Tony a quick, dirty kiss. “Be careful.”
Steve kisses him one more time, like a promise. “I want… I want Option 3, if you still do?”
Tony is talking now, mostly nonsense, but Steve makes out some of the words “Jesus… perfect, absolutely… couldn’t have asked for anything better, nothing… the best, most perfect, Steve oh my god… fucking perfect"
Tony interrupts again “Yeah, that should work Scott. Honestly, with a young kid like that you’re probably gonna want to be more available to her though, right? School plays and emergencies will pop up. I’ll download the app you need to your new Stark Phone so you can call one of my planes whenever. It can get you to San Fran in like 3 hours, door to door.”
“Tony, I go for a two-hour run every morning at 6 am. It’s 7 am, why are you even up?”
Steve nods, “I’ve been thinking about that actually. What would you think about co-leading the team with me?”
“Thank you for today.” Steve breaths as he moves around the column of Tony’s throat. Tony doesn’t respond, so Steve pauses his hand, just resting it loosely around the head of Tony’s cock until Tony looks at him.
But no one bats an eye, and after a week or so Steve comes to love Tony’s constant physical presence.
Tony waits but Steve seems to be glitching. Tony needs to solve this. He can solve this. “Okay, never mind that, how about I tell you the reasons I want
Steve tries one more time. “I’ll call to see if they have a private table for four. It’s a pretty small place, they may only have tables for two left-“
1. Captain America called Cassie by name. He can’t wait to tell her.
When Morgan turns three, Steve invites Pepper over and asks if she has any interest in Morgan having a sibling. Tony is beside himself at the prospect of a child with Steve and Pepper’s combined genetics. He thought nobody could be as perfect as Morgan, but he knows any hypothetical child that has the best of Steve Rogers and Pepper Potts is destined for greatness.
He remembers what he wrote when he first found out they were writing, that Steve should probably find someone a little more ‘age-appropriate’… someone who ‘hasn’t slept with half of Manhattan.’
, but
Steve can’t help but smile at it. He thought Tony would make something that looked like the armor. Sleek and intimidating. But, this is… well, cute. Really cute. It looks like some kind of mutt, with a slightly overly-large head that comes up past Steve’s knees.
After the (catered) meal, they’re enjoying pleasant conversation among desert and coffee when Pepper takes a deep breath. “So I know it’s a little unusual for us to have dinner at my place. I actually had something I wanted to ask you two.”
“Yes, please I think, I think that I’ll need to know that.” Tony says, bending his knees slightly in anticipation.
Um no, not on Tony’s watch.
Well, except Tony, who wraps an arm around him during the next movie night and says just loud enough for Scott to hear:
But Tony has.
“I’m, I am fine.” he says, “Stay back. This is my task.” He pants heavily, and pulls his arm up to the heavens.
Had to split the conclusion into two chapters because it was getting really long.
“Hey Rocket-Ralph, quit messing with my stuff.” says Tony.
No matter how advanced his armor gets, Tony knows he’s human. When building the compound he created a series of underground tunnels and rooms accessible from each part of the property just in case.
“If I were a sharing kind of guy, you’d be in-like-Flynn, Scott.” He squeezes his shoulder. “But I’m not, and neither is Steve.”
“I’ll do it.” Steve says, quickly unbuckling his pants so they can take care of things (at least for now).
Pepper’s brows shoot up at that and her mouth turns up at the corner, almost against her own will.
Tony’s eyes slowly ping pong from Pepper, to Steve, back to Pepper.
Next up, some fluff, and more smut. Next chapter is the height of the med-kink, be advised.
Steve pumps himself a few more times and then slides his hand down to the base and holds tightly. “Yes, we are going to get started Tony, just try to relax. Once the procedure begins you’ll need to hold still. You may be tempted to push back, but I’m going to hold you firmly so that doesn’t happen, okay?”
Steve kneels.
Tony goes pale, and then flushes. “Um, you said it’s like I’m getting microdoses of super soldier DNA?”
Tony blanches, “What,
. Everyone has split apart, your boyfriend murdered my parents, Rhodey “ain’t got no legs lieutenant Dan,” the world’s governments are a
“Most impressive! Rocket, Tony is one of Earth’s mightiest heroes, and among their most intelligent beings as well, right up there with my ex, Jane, of course.”
Steve blushes.
Tony hands Steve his shield. A month ago Tony outfitted everyone on the team with their own compact canister filled with nanobots. It allows them all to keep their most vital gear on-hand easily in something the size of a lipstick tube. As a result Steve and Falcon had been able to instantly don their gear, but the Shield is one-of-a-kind and not something Steve can just carry around. He gives Tony a greatful smile for remembering it in what must have been a chaotic scramble.
Tony lets out a breathless laugh.
No not harder, but like it... took more strength.
Tony groans.
Tony inhales sharply. “Okay Steve, I trust you.”
Part of why he always has to
“But let me remind
The indicator light above the door signals that Steve has just pressed the button on the picture frame. Shit. Tony hastily removes his clothes and balls them up on the nearest chair, just like he would at an actual doctor’s appointment. He slips on the gown and only ties the strings at the top, leaving the back to drape open.
Steve thinks that if Tony did all that, there was no reason for him to keep the actual phone out, on his bedside table this whole time… it's probably the first thing he sees when he wakes up.
So I thought this would be one chapter but it looks like the shower will last two, possibly three chapters. What is my life?
“I don’t think that. And I’m not crazy or hurt or anything like that. I think I’ve just… had a lot of time to think lately, about you. About who you are and what you mean to me. And all that thinking led me here.”
Steve, still too embarrassed to try to understand Tony’s manic thought process, just snuggles deeper and asks “Why?”
Steve lets out another gorgeous laugh, and leans up to smack Tony’s mouth with an overly wet kiss.
Something flares up in Tony then. Some old hurt he’s been nursing for a long time, along with a new burning need to defend Steve.
“Sounds good Brucie, I’ll send you the live feed from the armor.”
Eventually he eases his grip, and relaxes into a real kiss, armoured hands coming up to cradle Steve's face before he pulls away.
“Steve, what?”
Before, well with the few ladies he dated casually and then with Sharron he’d always been able to calm down. Sure, he
After he tracks Vision the first time, it’s easy to follow Wanda back to the others and digitally tail all of them with minimal effort. In truth they’ve been pretty boring. Steve booking a coach ticket across the Atlantic was a pretty big red flag, but it was his first significant movement in months. Tony figures Steve could be coming back to New York for a variety of reasons. It’s a big city, after all. Except, shortly after his plane touches down Friday reports that the nanobot-beacon on Steve indicates he’s making a beeline for the Tower.
He sees Steve sit up a little straighter out of the corner of his eye. Something is going on with him, Tony makes a note to talk to him about it after they hang up.
Eight months ago he looked, well he looked good, but it’s the face Tony remembers. It’s the face he would expect to see when he looks in the mirror. Tony partied hard in his youth, and he
He’s not sure what will make Steve feel uncomfortable or pressured, or what will make him feel wanted and happy… he just knows that being around Steve makes everything so immeasurably better.
“Will you keep them there for me?” Steve asks, referring to Tony’s hands up on the pillow.
He’s probably not going to convince Tony to hold off on telling Rhodey. And what would be the point now that Scott knows anyway? Can’t put the genie back in the bottle as they say… and Tony is about as crazy as that blue genie from the Arabian cartoon movie. And he sort of has the facial hair for it already...
Tony says nothing, just rests an elbow on the workshop table and leans back to enjoy watching Steve squirm.
Steve pets her and smiles, but instead of her usual happy grin a look of deep concentration forms on her face and she opens her mouth.
He gets to see Steve smile, and joke and shovel popcorn and cotton candy and cinnamon sugar pretzel into his mouth with glee. So when he sees the ring of cinnamon and sugar coating Steve’s mouth, he doesn’t lean forward and swipe at it with his tongue, or brush it off with his own thumb and lick it clean. He hands Steve a napkin and suggests they go see the mongooses.
“I don’t know Steve, you and Tony were getting pretty close before Tony left for Japan.” Bruce doesn’t mean it as a barb, but it’s true. Hours in the lab don’t really make someone your soul mate (despite Tony’s declarations otherwise), and even if Nat hadn’t told him about their letters, it was getting pretty obvious.
Oh, shit. That hurts more than Tony thought.
And it looks like that kid Peter Tony’s been mentoring has somehow tagged along…
"With all six stones, I could snap my fingers and they would all cease to exist. I call that, mercy."
, Jesus at this rate I’m never going to go soft
Tony looks apologetic, and says “Okay Fri, gather that data, and stay as surface as you can, no need to analyze specifics… yet.”
“I know, just please, let me just…”
Steve wants to put his mouth on Tony, but the angle isn’t right with Tony so far back on the table. He thinks to look at the front panel of the table, and is pleased to see several compartments. Some are storage, but the two at the top open to reveal two pull-out foot stirrups. Tony lifts his head at the noise and mouths a silent “oh fuck” as he sees Steve fold out the foot-holds with the hand that isn't busy with his ass.
“Oh, well you all, the Avengers I mean, you’re a big topic of conversation at school. Everyone has different theories about who is hooking up with who, who has drama, who is going to have who’s babies. There’s a
He had planned to program even more options, but the Accords II ended up taking less time to resolve than he thought they would (due to the fact that he spent
faces!” Peter pleads.
“Tony taps the nano-casing on his chest and suits up. Any questions?”
Steve let’s a gasp escape.
“No, yeah, I gotcha. Hawaii’s never really been my favorite anyway. I’ll send you back here whenever you want though, bring some people, whatever.”
“Oh, umm, yeah I mean we don’t even have like, letterhead… yet! And I think the paperwork is still going through for us to form the LLC?” Scott is dying. He was just offered up the golden goose of clients on a platter and he can’t take the work because he doesn’t have a real company yet!
“How does that feel Tony, too much?”
Tony sighs. “So I guess you’re heading back a little sooner than we thought?” His voice is careful, even.
made that saved the universe?” says Tony.
Steve’s heart leaps, he can't believe this is actually happening after months of dreaming. After years of knowing Tony, and almost losing him...
He nods and they are quiet all the way back to the master suite. They shower with utilitarian speed; for once Tony has something more enticing than his custom shower settings.
But that was before he saw Steve like this.
Steve laughs and rolls his eyes. “It was bound to happen eventually. The only reason I didn’t kiss you during that mess on the Rhine last month was because of your damn helmet.”
He refuses to lose something this real again.
“Ah!” says Steve as he leans forward to grasp the handholds, sticking his ass out even further toward Tony’s waiting mouth. Yeah.
Steve isn’t sure what Tony’s expecting of him. Earlier by the elevator it was all so overwhelming, but now that he’s been on the receiving end of Tony’s attention for two orgasms, he thinks he gets it. He gets how to go about taking the lead.
“No. You have to stay like this Tony.” Steve is on his knees in the center of the bed, holding Tony to him ass-first. Tony’s legs are still up against Steve’s torso running up past his shoulders. Tony can’t move comfortably at all, all he can do is lean back into Steve’s arms, which are acting as a brace keeping him at a 45 degree angle.
Steve runs one hand more purposefully over the plug, his other grasping Tony’s ass and squeezing. He swallows.
Tony leans back against him and sighs, mirroring the pose they made in the shower earlier. “And also," says Tony, pushing his ass back to grind into Steve "sneaking around sucks and is a major cock-block?”
Dubious science ahead!
Steve’s heart lurches. He knew, in an abstract way this was hard on them especially. But he feels like a total asshole for not thinking more about their kids. He knows they chose to follow him, chose to stand by him despite the consequences. But that actually makes it worse.
“I can’t sleep. I – for months, I haven’t been able to. I don’t know how you’ve been, I hope you’ve been okay.” Steve shakes his head, this isn’t what he wants to say.
The bathroom door begins to open and he yells out to Tony to wait. His perfect tactical mind can’t come up with anything other than to pull the covers up to his chin to hide his stained shirt and still-exposed lower half.
Steve takes the lube and uses it to open himself in now well-practiced movements. Two months ago he’d never had more than a single fingertip inside himself, but after the tower he invested in some decent lube and became intimately familiar with this part of his anatomy.
for it. Not to be outdone Tony responds, determined to shock the smirk off his face:
Steve watches as Tony make his way down the outdoor staircase to the beach, registering as he goes that Tony is wearing swim shorts and has a beach towel in hand.
But Tony feels different. He feels like he could be Steve’s home. His future.
Don’t laugh.
Tony pulls on the hair back harder toward the floor, causing Steve’s chin to tilt up. Tony catches his eye with a look so intense that Steve questions for a moment if any of this has been real because it feels like a dream come to life.
“Of course I did, though I paired it my
Steve wants to tell Tony he feels the same way. He wants to tell him… something, but he stops himself. Does he love everything about Tony? He can’t seem to make the words come out. Tony can be impossible, and this whole thing still seems like a terrible idea half the time…
Pink tinges Steve’s cheeks as he considers that he and Tony have been buck naked for over 48 hours. It actually felt odd to pull his clothes back on his body, restrictive, like shackles.
Tony is sputtering and flailing his hands around, and Steve would find it adorable if it didn’t feel like the next few minutes were going to determine if he got everything he ever wanted, or returned to the team with his heart in a million pieces.
Five more minutes turns into thirty, which then developes into frantic frontage with the remaining gold lube when Tony helpfully points out that Steve has become hard again during their cuddling.
Damn it. Scott knew it was all too good to be true.
Sleep is no longer an escape, so he tries to get by on the bare minimum. It’s bad enough that he can’t stop thinking about Tony and the whole situation during the day, but seeing his guilty conscience strung through this awful dreamscape night after night is slowly driving him insane.
Wanda, Vision and Steve raise their hands.
“Does this look like refusing? Bruce, am I refusing?” Tony looks at Bruce, and only at Bruce. Bruce quickly glances up from his work on Tony’s hand to meet his eyes before reaching for a jar of green goo that he got earlier, along with more gauze pads.
His phantom erection is back, and oh…
He works quickly to coat his index finger and joins Steve on his platform. Steve shifts to make room, still presenting his ass.
Suddenly Steve wants to do something he almost never does. He wants to back down.
“Got it. According to traffic camera feeds, Steve is two blocks up and one over.”
He thought he might go soft after that, but then Tony offered him his mouth, still wet and pliant from despoiling his ass and he couldn’t even think. He’s honestly worried about living the rest of his life with a constant hard-on. The serum has unknown limits, and Steve has never tested
In true Tony fashion he holds it in as long as he can, until there’s no way to stop it. He just says it one day as they are getting ready to go see some modern dance thing Wanda has insisted they all see as a group.
“Tony! Are you alright?” Steve is scrambling to keep him upright and examine him at the same time. He looks to the team for help,
A small smile appears on Steve’s face, but he schools his expression quickly. “I think in the future that may be an option for you, however given the severity of your condition, you’ll need full anal insertion today. Getting at least two doses into your anal cavity will be crucial to the procedure’s success.”
There. He focuses on touching Tony on that precious spot but with no predictability, hitting it several times in a row then backing off, hitting it again, then avoiding it.
“Yep,” says Tony, “I was clean and we figured Steve’s serum meant he was too.”
"Okay, so Thanos is... Managed." hedges Tony. "What about the army outside? Or hell, the whole mess of beings that are probably gonna come after the stones next?" Tony questions the group, arms raised.
Steve>> I understand, thanks for having my back.
“Yes,” says Strange, “We need to get your red witch, the shrinking man and anyone else we can here
He gets up and holds out his hand to Steve. It’s a reflex, but he takes a second to reflect on how ridiculous it is that Steve would need to take his hand for help getting up off the sofa. He’s seen this man do a backflip off of a plane, onto another plane, while getting shot at and ricocheting his shield to take down a third plane.
Tony pauses the opening scene. “You know Nebula, it’s almost always part of a traditional Earth sleepover to take care of bodily repairs and upgrades.”
He feels like a bucket of ice water has been poured over him as he realized what it is. Oh god, he’s so selfish.
Tony lets out a little whine, desperate for Steve to do more than slowly twist the plug.
Steve must sense his mind is in a free-fall.
Steve’s mind is on fire, he didn’t get out what he wanted to say and now Tony is doing the exact thing he was hoping to stave off. His heart aches, realizing all the pain and fear he’s felt over the last few months probably pales in comparison to what Tony has been dealing with. Tony is about to shut down, or worse, make him leave. He has to do something.
Also! I believe all we know at this point in “1796 Broadway”  is that Becky has slept over, so I am taking that and creating my own headcannon where that doesn’t mean full on sex… because reasons. No disrespect meant to the original story, or purposeful misreading meant.
“Steve, please, move up, let me get my mouth on you Sit on my face.” Tony says, just at the edge of begging.
They enter the lab, and Tony cuts right to it. “What do you see?"
Steve's head jolts up, and he starts to protest "I'm not, that's not--"
“Fucking, fuck! Damn it Steve!” Steve glances over to see what is clearly Tony’s erection straining against the heavy covers. He can’t help but laugh, even though he isn’t really in any better shape, grinding down a little into the somehow soft yet firm million dollar mattress.
For all of Steve’s hopes/fears that Tony will try to move things along once in bed, Tony is totally pliant, letting Steve set the pace. Steve kisses him deeper, settling a little heavier on top of him, but careful to keep their lower halves out of alignment. Tony continues to respond beautifully, pressing up from underneath him, running his hands over Steve’s arms and back. Finally Steve pulls back, running his hand up from Tony’s chest to his jawline tracing his facial hair.
The beating of the water can’t disguise the other noises coming out of the bathroom. They aren’t loud. Steve is pretty sure that a normal person wouldn’t even be able to hear them. The serum improved his hearing overall, but it also made it easier to distinguish noises from one another, and zero in on them if need be.
I hope everyone out there is safe and healthy!
It’s still strange not to hear Jarvis.
Steve stays quiet for several minutes and walks back to sit down in Tony’s stool.
“I know you two are close… I mean, he went to you for his hand, and you guys have probably spent the most time together out of everyone one the team…”
