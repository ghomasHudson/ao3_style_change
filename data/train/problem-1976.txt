Thirty minutes later, he stood in the doorway. He knew why he hesitated and found it perfectly reasonable. Pity. Greg would have the look on his face that always made John want to cry. No not cry. Weep. He sighed heavily.
Sherlock let is cock slip out, leaning back against the tentacle with a groan. John fought the urge to take himself in hand, taking deep breaths with closed eyes. His hand lay unmoving on his hip as he tried to calm his libido down to a point where he could touch and be touched without coming on the spot. The sight that greeted him upon opening his eyes didn’t help at all. Sherlock knelt between his legs languorously rocking between the tentacle inside him and the fist he’d formed around his leaking arousal. His head was thrown back and, with his eyes closed and his mouth forming a sigh, John had the impression that he had completely forgotten about him. The doctor kept staring at the strangely erotic sight Sherlock offered in his self-indulgence. Sweat began to form on the man’s chest and forehead. His curls were sticking to the skin of his temples and neck, and there was a deep blush spreading from his cheekbones all down to his flat stomach.
John had come so hard that evening, he didn’t fall asleep. He passed out. And although it had been the strongest orgasm of his life, he couldn’t enjoy the experience or the memory of it. The bulge had never been this big. Alarmingly big.
“I didn’t leave. I merely went into the kitchen to make sure that you get enough water.” John said amused before he drank his bottle down to the bottom.
“Just trying to calm down.” John shrugged.
John ran home.
A few minutes later, Sherlock left him with the two books.
*****
“Fuck, John…” He muttered, feeling his climax build continuously. Sherlock tried to bring one hand to his throbbing prick, the urge to come rising viciously inside of him.
Sherlock’s eyes shot open. He was sitting in his chair wearing his dressing gown and had his hands folded in his lap. Across from him, John smiled under his mustache.
“Gods? GOD’S?” Mrs. Phillips yelled angrily. “Monsters! That’s what we became! And what about the people that died? What about my mother?” Tears were gathering in her eyes and her voice broke to an ugly squeal. The hair in John’s neck stood on end, a strong sense of danger crawling up his spine he felt the urge to intervene.
Sherlock blinked his eyes open and stared at the ceiling.
With a huge amount of effort, they pulled hard. John felt whatever it was slip from the man's leg and for an instant he thought they had pulled strong enough to throw the man over their heads because he felt the shoulders he'd held on to glide upwards. Letting his arms fall to the ground he turned onto his back and watched an imposing pair of wings flap higher and higher. With his mouth open, John blinked a few times to clear his eyes from the fresh sweat that lay heavy on his lashes.
*****
“Thank god! I was already worrying that your next limp might not be psychosomatic.” Sherlock teased him in obvious relief.
A deep blush appeared on the detective's cheekbones making him look adorably young and giving John his answer in advance, while Sherlock preferred to stare at the candle.
“Show me you back.” She demanded taking a step sideways, closer to him. She had positioned herself between the two flat mates. Sherlock stood to her right, his hands behind his back and his head slightly angled towards her. John had the impression that it was a motion that enabled him somehow to anticipate what she would do next. At the moment Mrs. Phillips’ focus was completely on John but her position made quite clear that this could change within a blink of an eye.
Twelfth Night, Act II, scene iii, line 44-45
John's hands restlessly roamed the lean body, trying to prove again and again that this was,in fact, happening. Somewhen between Sherlock casually sitting down beside him and John being pushed into a horizontal position, their shirts had been unbuttoned to allow a pleasurable caress every now and then.
Grimacing sadly he signaled for Sherlock to come closer. The Detective walked cautiously and knelt down in front of him. The earthquake’s intensity grew and grew. Outside people began to scream, car sirens clung loudly being triggered by the commotion. And in the midst of it there was a noisy fracturing which seemed to get closer and closer. John watched a crack appear in the ceiling above him before he looked down at Sherlock who knelt in front of him and held his hands with an expression of defeat. Outside, the rupture passed them by with a deafening crash before the earth stood still again.
When Sherlock started at the back of his calves, John felt himself gradually drift off. The touches to his skin became a pleasant afterthought as his mind began to wander.
“You should have shown me earlier.”
“No idea, really.” Sherlock seemed to be just as disappointed but said nothing as he started to move the settee and table.
The detective starts to kiss down his chest, murmuring into the skin. “John, my John. Wonderful, fascinating John……” He shuffles lower over John’s body, licking around his belly button, occasionally biting lightly or just dragging his teeth over the skin. John’s hipbone seems to be extremely interesting to him for he spends a good  five minutes nibbling and sucking the elatedness until it shows an impressive hickey and the doctor is squirming beneath him, trying to push his groin against Sherlock’s chest in an attempt to get some friction.
“Two fingers, John. That’s not enough but I want to feel the head of your cock stretching me and I want to feel the evidence of what we are going to do, for as long as possible.”
The doctor just blinked at him, still unable to form any sort of reply.
Sherlock decided that John would understand what he didn’t.
There were coins laying everywhere around him, barely piled up. Sherlock tried to distract himself, counting and estimating their amount. He knew it wasn’t possible but there was nothing else he could do.
There once lived a King that had a fiber-barren son with a sharp nose, water-blue eyes and unruly hair. The boy had the rare name Sky-high-jubilating Afflicted-to-death and was born with a strange gift. Whenever a tear left his eyes, that tear would turn into a coin.
“Um... OK.” As he awkwardly settled between blankets and massage oil, John began to worry again.
“That’s three. Who is the fourth?” He asked a little less interested in the topic now that he noticed the warm expression on the other man’s face.
“And you don’t.” The man stated distantly.
John Watson. Fighting criminals, shooting serial killers, nervous about showering with his flat mate. Sherlock smiles and pushes the shower curtain aside, just enough to slip in behind John.
John was only 20 minutes into his therapy with Louise and already glad that Sherlock had left him to his devices. That woman was torturing him. Bending his legs further then they should be bend, stretching his joints and pricking him with needles to force his body (and probably mind) into submission.
He sighed theatrically. What he wasn’t willing to do for a case of murder. He was only five minutes away from doing it himself, the only thing stopping him was the knowledge that it would be annoyingly easy to solve. And he wasn’t even an inch closer to that damn Prince James.
“I was never sure if you were.” Sherlock took a moment to think about the implications of John’s statement while Angelo’s slowly began to dissolve around them.

― H.P. Lovecraft
“What?” He asked, looking down at himself, expecting to find signs of mutation. Carefully, he touched his face scanning for changes but found none.
“He’s waiting for you. He has been for a long time.”
It was probably caused by the depressing silence and feeling of loneliness that John bought an amount of food that would last a minimum of 2 weeks and had to take one of the rare cabs but it at least gave him the possibility to have a hasty breakfast on his way home. He tried to talk to the cabby about the strange situation but the man only made a cross in front his chest and, fighting back tears, refused to talk to him. The rest of the short ride was spent in silence while John ate some meat pies.
“You are right. Right now, I can’t see anything alarming or unusual.” The doctor said, straightening up again.
“Right now, there are 4 people called John in here. This one.” He was pointing at the barkeeper, a  big, dark haired man with greasy skin and angry marks on his knuckles caused by too many fights with aggressive guests at shut-down. “The one over there.” A boy that was most likely too young to know the difference between spring and fall but drank from a huge glass of Ale. Sherlock shook his head in denial hoping that this wasn’t the one he was searching for.
Sherlock mostly kept himself out of 221b and busy with following people around until there was nothing left to deduce about them or they confronted him for his ‘stalking’, ‘creepiness’ or ‘awkward attempt at flirting’. Sometimes all of the three. One woman even yelled
John nodded more to himself than anybody else before he hurriedly climbed on the bed and pulled the duvet up to his chin. Sherlock got up from the bed and, unceremoniously, chucked his coat on the floor before climbing back on the bed and laying down on top of the duvet. John had turned his back on him, almost completely hidden from view, only his blonde hair standing out against the white bed linen. Sherlock’s shoulder pressed against his back was their only point of contact but it was enough to give them a sense of calm none of them had known in a long time.
“Where is Sky-high-jubilating Afflicted-to-death?”
With still creased eyebrows Sherlock walked back into the guest room. John was still sitting at the table, clearly worried if Sherlock would come back. As soon as he saw him entering the room a fond smile graced his features. There was a white streak in his hair that Sherlock hadn’t noticed before.

(See the end of the chapter for
“He’s seen far more than any of us.” Sherlock declared, seemingly unfazed by Sean’s ongoing hysteria. “He remained sane until now. He’ll calm down again.”
“I wish I could have seen for myself.” That was where it struck him.
“How do you know? If it was just her you can’t be sure.”
“Jealousy?” Sherlock’s voice was laced with uncertainty.
“Talking to someone you barely knew 24 hours? Everything before ‘
“Erm… sure.” John’s voice sounds even more ragged now but Sherlock can easily identify the reason as pure nervousness.
At the whole concept of gay sex, there was one factor that John just couldn’t get used to. Preparation.  The idea that Sherlock would have to shove his fingers up his arse didn’t seem very appealing and certainly not sexy. John had researched everything that was to know about the right ways to get clean and ready for the actual sex. So, he had taken a shower and cleaned the area in question thoroughly. Afterwards, he had excused himself to have a lie-down but had instead started to stretch himself. At first he had found it unpleasant and a bit painful and when he managed to get two fingers in he was about to call the whole thing off. But he really wanted it. Wanted to give this to Sherlock. Then, suddenly, he had found his prostate.
Quietly, Sean began to laugh, digging his fingers hard into his thighs. His own weapon forgotten on the ground beside him.
*****
“Beautiful.” He whispered onto the pale skin. John positioned his cock at the crease of Sherlock’s arse, rubbing it against the slickness between the luxury globes. The Omega pushed back against him with a frustrated groan.
“But…Do we look like monsters to you? You certainly don’t look like one to me.” He added in an attempt at kindness. He knew he had made a mistake when he saw a slight wince on Sherlock’s face.
I am so sorry. There will be porn next, I promise!
He has never been this content and certain. They both know. And if he ever has doubts about it he will just ask Sherlock. He seems to know better, anyway.
“Thank you!”
John held Sherlock’s hips in a strong grip, forcing him on his cock again and again. The Omega was already bracing himself against the headboard while John kept on thrusting into him.
Greg and Mrs. Hudson had agreed to take turns checking on the state of the bunkers newest inhabitant after John had told them what to look for and to call him immediately when he woke up. During the last ten minutes of the surgery when John was putting the final stitches Sherlock had given Mycroft a complete account of their trip to the surface and even though none of them said so, it was clear that they were all worried about the possible threads waiting outside.
Without looking up,  the consulting detective laced their fingers together. Feeling his anxiety dissipate, Sherlock leant back into the couch and, closing his eyes, took a deep breath.
Sherlock was loud on purpose when he took the seventeen stairs up to their flat. Clearly, John had wanted to prepare something requiring the requested hour. Sherlock just hoped that it didn’t include John moving out, needing one hour to gather his belongings. He stopped in front of the living room door, uncertain if he should knock or just step in. He knocked once and opened the door while calling John’s name.
John looked at the mellow face beside him, a surge of pride tugging at his guts while he thought about being the one that Sherlock had chosen to let into his guarded heart. He doubted that he would ever understand how he had managed to make Sherlock care for him, especially considering how much Sherlock had already given him so freely. All the things he once craved, that he missed to a degree that it made his body revolt, where now available to him just because of Sherlock. Even things that he never knew he needed. Knowing for sure that his fondness was returned, was threatening to overwhelm John but it also induced a new wave of affection inside of him that he just had to act on. Cautiously, John leaned over Sherlock and pressed a lingering kiss against his temple. For long seconds, he reveled in the feeling of soft skin under his lips and the smell of Sherlock’s hair in his nose. John swore to himself that he would do everything he could to enforce their bond. Surprisingly, he realized that there were no boundaries he couldn’t see himself cross. Cuddling up against his flat mate, he let his right arm rest over Sherlock’s heart where he felt it beating against his palm. Instantly, he drifted off again.
A pained expression crossed Sherlock’s face as he looked through the kitchen searching for words. John had a clear advantage standing in the middle of the doorway. Sherlock had to answer him or John wouldn’t let him pass and they both knew it.
John stood in the middle of the room looking at Sherlock in awe. So beautiful. His Consulting Detective. He wanted to be what Sherlock deserved but he couldn’t be sure that he was capable. This would be Sherlock’s first time and he would make it a wonderful one if he could.
“Come out of there.” John tried to sound calm while he turned the shower off. Sherlock’s movements were lacking his usual gracefulness when he made to step out of the tub. John awaited him with a towel. Slowly, carefully he dried him off, rubbing the cloth soothingly over Sherlock’s back and up to his shoulders. He avoided Sherlock’s groin in order to not tease the suffering Omega. His own renewed erection wasn’t important when Sherlock was clearly struggling for composure. John had to stretch up to dry his hair with the towel but it seemed important that he did that for Sherlock.
It was not a comfortable position but they held it for a long time.
----------------
“Oh. That.” Sherlock replied, oozing boredom.
Anxiously, John cleaned himself in the most efficient way. The whole time, his mind revolved around the U-turn his life had taken while he was fast asleep. From lonely, frustrated husband/soon-to-be father, to still-too-fond-of-the-flatmate widower.
“Oh god, yes, John!”
******
John took him by the wrist again and pushed his arm over his head. Instantly, a deep blush blossomed on Sherlock’s face and his pupils dilated.
into the open, as John privately called them. The technician and the pilot still spent their time hidden away, avoiding especially the Holmes brothers. John suspected that they’d decided to blame Mycroft for not being with their families when everything fell apart.
If that description doesn’t help you to understand the psychological condition with which Sherlock diagnoses himself, think of a really horrible/ awesome person in your past and reflect on your reaction towards someone that looks even remotely similar.
“Was there an official ceremony?” John wondered aloud when they stopped in front of the cemetery.
“Please!” He interrupted, feeling his need to just
“Please, John!”
----------
This time it takes a bit longer and Sherlock is already asking himself if this was it when his phone buzzes again.
“Why the tattoo?” He asked, pointing at the colorful skin on Sherlock’s hip.
John started to fumble with the lube that he had placed on the bedside table, earlier. His own throbbing cock made his movements more clumsy while Sherlock still rubbed himself against his thigh, moaning his name as a demand to hurry.
John was staring at the expensive black marble that had become the symbol of everything that was sad and dark in his life.
The same day, 08:34 a.m.
“But you don’t know me.” He stated awkwardly.
Understanding what they had....
“Aren’t there any leftovers from yesterday?” Sherlock’s voice resounded from the inside of their fridge when John entered the living room.
His phone buzzed somewhere under his spine. Muttering to himself about
“Is this…?” He asked awkwardly without knowing how to finish.
*****
“I did, too. Well, that part of me anyway. I still wanted to be with you. I wanted back what Moriarty had taken from me. From us.” John displayed a variety of emotions of which Sherlock was able to identify most. None of them was helping him focus on the matter at hand. There were deep lines around the doctor’s eyes and his jaw was set in determination. Sherlock’s determination.
“Yes, I am. And I want it to stay that way. I am your Alpha. You are my Omega.” John stated confidently, his posture proud to hide his intimidation.
“Right.” He said, beginning to resume his explorations when he saw the hint of something dark blue in the middle of one of the openings. The pointed end wound itself out of Sherlock’s back. John let his thumb brush over it. It felt smooth, so smooth that it was  glistening. At first he thought it was wet but there was no trace of liquid on his thumb.
“I could be wrong, though.” Sherlock said, frustrated acknowledging the current situation.
John came to believe that there had to be someone out there that was meant for him and he decided not to spend his life with anybody else. For years to come he would hold on to this conviction.
head and I can’t enter yours, and that you didn’t know that I had these additional limbs in the first place, they should be mine.” He admitted, bending lower still, ending up almost flush with the table top.
“You never asked. You probably assumed that it would be futile. Well, there is a grave to visit and after Mrs. Hudson and I had a rare moment of agreement, I thought it best to take you there.”
“Of course, John.” Relief rushed through Sherlock’s body. He would just let John find out for himself what he liked. That would make it much easier for him to not come right the second he was fully seated inside John.
He opened the glass door to Sherlock's room without hesitating. The consulting detective had already prepared blankets and massage oil. John took it all in but came up blank.
“Yes.”
“Nice try.” The doctor leant back in his armchair. “We both know that you can’t stay here forever, right?” He waited for Sherlock to acknowledge the truth with a slight indication of his head.
“No, I…You left.” Sherlock said in disbelief. John opened both bottles and handed him one, urging him on to drink it. Sherlock took a few gulps of the cold water with furrowed brows.
Even though Sherlock wished for him to be the John he was searching for he didn’t quite believe it.
John’s mind supplied him with images of
------------------------
John sat down in his usual chair and closed his eyes. Inhaling the steam of his tea, he forced his muscles to relax. Intentionally, he envisioned an Afghan desert with strong blowing wind and a bright blue sky. He imagined a lizard scuttle by beside his feet and let his gaze follow it into the distance.
“I could do with a curry.” He stated, giving John's hand a reassuring squeeze before picking up the phone. Of course, his assessment had been as obvious as usual, but John had always appreciated not having to explain emotions he didn't fully understand himself.
Unimpressed, Sherlock took two long steps and came to stand in front of the bed.
The careful touch to his thigh came as a surprise for Sherlock and made him shiver. He had expected John to ask for the colorful tattoo that was now only half hidden by his black pants but the doctor followed the lines of his initials with his index finger instead.
“You got a cover up then.” John stated, pointedly looking out of the window when Sherlock arrived home.
“I had to make sure it would work. I didn’t mean to include you but I had to concentrate on the task at hand.” The anger raised its ugly head again.
He watched with rapt attention as Sherlock pushed himself up from his knees and, closing his eyes, swallowed visibly. John’s skin was tingling and his pace quickened when Sherlock spoke again.
His men laughed even louder at that and took a strong hold of Sherlock, dragging him into the shabby housing. He didn’t try to run. He knew it would only be a waste of energy and time. He had to wait for a chance.
“Don’t move.” Sherlock whispered. He still felt nervous and out of his depth. This was very much not his area so the only thing he could possibly do was to improvise. And maybe try out one or two of his rarely indulged fantasies.
“John…” She put her hand on his and gave him an emphatic look. “That Mary business. It's horrible. I know how you must be feeling. My husband wasn't…”
(See the end of the chapter for
Sherlock nodded tightly and blushed crimson again.
“The ones closest to what? No, wait….” The DI said, shaking his head.  “John too, huh? How is he? Still sick? How does he handle the…”
A small peck right above his collarbone was the only answer he got.
Behind the counter, Martha was still caring for Sean who was true to Sherlock’s prognosis, much calmer already but still somewhat shaky. With a soft voice she made him eat most of his share after hastily downing her own portion.
Huffing, he hurried after Sherlock who was already a few meters ahead of him.
“No and I really looked. You know, Sherlock, when I was young it wasn’t unusual for me to find little surprises by a young gentleman who….” He put the box back on the table, examining it from all angles. It was ordinary. Probably wired inside but no other way to find out than to just try and make sure. Carefully, he pulled the lit up and peered through the growing opening. When he couldn’t make out an obvious mechanism he opened it completely. For a short moment he felt astonishingly sick considering what he’d seen and where he’d investigated for decades. The blue-ish flesh was unmistakable. He could hear John’s sharp intake of breath beside him and a quiet
“Isn’t that what your father always said when he abused you? Milksop?” The p in the end rang out with a popping sound. He grinned sardonically at his opponent.
In the following week, John visited five different urologists. Two of them immediately dismissed his worries as imagined. The other three were a disappointing replay of his visit at Doctor Rosen’s practice. The bulge never showed.
Sherlock’s eyes are closed and his head thrown back in pleasure and pain. His mouth hangs open letting a soft “Hnnnng.” slip out. All John can do is to grip Sherlock’s hips tightly and hang on for dear life.
He typed in the quote and “Shakespeare” and was instantly rewarded.
John emphasized his answer by pushing his hips up against Sherlock and rolling them in a slow circle to let them both feel the delicious drag of skin on skin.
Undressing was awkward with Sherlock looking at him like a lion waiting to attack the gnu. The well-dressed consulting detective didn't move at all while John tried to adjust to the rather unfamiliar foreplay. He wasn't shocked, though. It was Sherlock after all and expecting their first intimate encounter to be like one of those he'd had before was just ridiculous.
In a hurry, John turned. His prominent erection suddenly on display as it pushed hard against the soft fabric of his pants.
As much as Sherlock tried to delay the inevitable, in the end he wasn’t able to help it. He was ticklish and after a few minutes he eventually cried of laughter. Again.
He had to admit that that made for a long list of mistakes. He could only guess what lead to this chain of wrong deductions but he suspected strongly that it had something to do with the husband being smallish, blonde and called John. Stupid. He definitely fell for the fake tears that had made their way over his slightly tanned cheeks.
*****
Another issue for the already long list of questions he wanted to ask Sherlock.
John felt the urge to refuse the order but he was glad to have something to occupy him. As he walked over to the counter and glanced back he saw Sherlock taking one of Mrs. Hudson's hands in a compassionate gesture.
Sherlock made a hushing noise at John, looking at their door to remind him that they had an ill landlady in the flat downstairs.
“A bit.” John admitted.
All air left John’s lungs in a huff. There, on Sherlock’s neck, literally black on white, where three letters forming the wonderfully simple word
Sure motions circled up and down his legs for long moments before he felt a blanket covering him completely and long fingers brushing through his hair.
“You don’t have to say anything.” John said into his shoulder.
Slowly, John sat back on his heels his arms still stretched to the side’s, held there by the strong but apparently not very smart minions. He could probably overwhelm both of them but Moriarty had placed a sword in hand-reach that could turn his break out into a burial if he was unlucky.
They sat with her for another hour. Even though John felt bad for her, he also noticed that the three of them hadn't had a long chat in ages and it soon became comfortable and even funny at times. The underlying sadness she had displayed was still there but John was sure that even with London looking like that, they all were relieved that there still was an outside world existing. Three months in a bunker had made each of them tense and depressed in different ways. And the cup of tea didn't hurt either. They were British after all.
He felt the deep rumble around his cock before he heard it and his eyes flew open. He raised his head letting his arm fall limply beside his head. Sherlock’s voice, being an octave deeper than usual, emanated from the gorgeous mouth and sent vibrations through John’s whole body as the Consulting Detective pushed back against the tentacle entering him. The tiny thrusting motions of it’s pinnacle were mesmerizing to John as they caused waves of movement in Sherlock’s hips and back.
“You think?” John repeated whispering now.
That evening had been a quiet one. Sherlock had fallen asleep on John’s shoulder at midnight after he had eaten three quarters of the Indian take away they had ordered. John didn’t mind it. He had been happy to see Sherlock eat, for once. When Sherlock had leaned against him and closed his eyes, John didn’t stop him. He just watched as Sherlock slowly fell asleep.
It took John two hours to patch up what was left of Sean's clawed left foot. With luck there would be nothing more than a limp reminding the mutant of that days attack. It was also possible that John would have to take the leg off in a day or two but he hoped that the changed genetics would aid the man's healing process.
the real problem?” Martha asked, taken aback by John’s apparent cold bloodedness.
John knew that the “conversation” he had was meant to be a secret, and he was more than proud of himself for having found a way to answer the stranger, whom he secretly called “The Pilgrim.” Surprisingly, he wasn’t worried about the fact that said stranger had broken into their flat, repeatedly. He was actually more worried about the fact that he called it
Despite John’s protest and colorful descriptions of what probably was to come, the ghosts had decided to stay and were standing aside waiting to close the door behind them, as soon as they were gone.
His moral compass was off the rails. He knew that. But he'd also known that one does not abandon his marriage. Had been so sure of it that he'd made himself overlook Mary's attempted murder and constant arrogance in favor of an unborn child that never existed.
“And stop this!” John said determinedly. Sherlock’s breathing visibly speed up but he nodded in affirmation.
Sherlock felt his heart clench painfully in his chest. He was standing on the narrow stage, violin in hand, watching John and Mary on the dance floor. It felt like dying, having to endure this a second time. Beside him, John was a constant reminder that this was merely a review. His hat, clothing and even the mustache comfortingly out of place in Sherlock’s time.
Soon, Sherlock was satisfied with his work there and moved on, sliding his fingers up over shoulders and upper arms. The movements made it seem as if he had lost track of his initial plan but before John could comment on it, he felt Sherlock sit back, resting on his thighs and immediately changing the tone of his ministrations.
“Yes, I am.” She nodded decisively.
Sherlock groaned to himself in frustration. He listened while John left the kitchen and made his way up to his room. Sherlock, using only his feet, freed himself of his shoes, slipping out of them without bothering to get up.
After hearing the shower being turned on and being sure that Sherlock didn’t pass out from the initial shock of hot water to his system, John had deemed it necessary to get the Detective to eat and rest. Preferably without someone interfering with the, no doubt soon to be, awkward mood that would inevitably lead to an even more awkward evaluation of Sherlock’s self-exploration and John’s snooping/ interruption/ encouragement.
“There's nothing wrong with you. Yes, you are missing something but I won’t tell you. You have to find out for yourself.” His voice is a low rumble, certain but kind. It makes John’s frustration even more pressing and the blood pound in his veins. Anger surges through him and burns in his cheeks.
The sun just set as John decided to leave it be and closed the laptop.
Many citizens came to tell him what they had heard but it seemed that the object of his nosiness was intangible. If Sherlock had been an illogical man he would have considered Prince James a ghost.
When he felt something pressing against his back from the inside without feeling any pain but a strong itching sensation beneath his skin he decided to stop ignoring the facts.
The next morning, John found himself alone in Sherlock’s room. His sleep had been refreshing to a degree that felt foreign to him. Going through his morning routine, John established that Sherlock had left without sending him the obligatory text to inform him of his whereabouts.
“He shouldn’t have forgotten who was paying him. At least, he was willing to tell me where to look for you.” A blatant lie. John knew Bill would never have told them anything. Mike and Bill were his only friends since childhood. When Mike had told him that Bill had a new employment as
Sherlock lay on the couch, thinking about new ways to get John to have sex with him. He didn’t doubt John’s attraction to him. That much was obvious from the physical evidence he was displaying every time they engaged in sexual contact. Thirty minutes ago, John had silently left the room, after spending an awfully long time in the shower, to
“Oh.” Sherlock groaned and immediately began to rub against him as the tentacle thrust into him.
Every time his hands moved an inch higher, Sherlock looked up at him as if asking for permission. John was breathing in a shallow regular rhythm, trying his best to remain calm but soon felt his body give way to the sensations. A calculating expression appeared on Sherlock's face as he closed his hands hard around John's legs, using the same technique he'd used on the sides of his upper body. It hurt minimally but his muscles felt a bit better afterwards. It did nothing to diminish John's physical inhibition, though. Quite the contrary.
. John was apparently either less affected or better at controlling himself for he didn’t falter once in his rhythm while Sherlock found it increasingly difficult to not just follow the urge to desperately rut against sweaty flushed skin.
“How would I even do that? I can’t remember doing anything like this and I certainly didn’t want to.”
wasn’t his area. He walked around London for more than three hours before he was able to come up with a plan. As unusual as it was, he needed advice. There was only one problem: Who should he ask? He considered talking to Lestrade but was fairly certain that John would be embarrassed if he ever found out about it. There was Molly, but in contrast to general belief he knew that, asking her for (if his assumption was right) a probably romantic advice, would only be cruel and a hindrance to their shared work. Sherlock also thought about asking Mrs. Hudson but he knew her so well that he’d had the whole conversation in his mind palace, instead, and it only lead to an extremely excited Mrs. Hudson which would, no doubt, drop hints for John every time she saw him. Mycroft was out for obvious reasons. That’s how Sherlock found himself at Blackfriars, in a place he never thought he’d see from the inside.
Sherlock was running through the woods, determined not to go back to his father’s kingdom. There was only one place he could go now. Somewhere nobody knew him.
Hesitantly, John put his hand on Sherlock's which was resting at his side on the couch.
If thou sorrow, he will weep;
He heard John before he caught a glance at his annoyed expression.
that for some reason was mostly obtained through female acquaintances, even his play-acts served to broaden John’s horizon on the matter.
“But…”
“No. But I read several articles on the topic and I know how your muscles are stressed when you move and that, right now, your legs, back and shoulders are tense and close to cramping.”
Sherlock looked expectantly at John, who cleared his throat uneasily.
John limped through the seemingly endless rows of tombstones trying to be as fast as possible. He wanted to be done with this. Sooner rather than later.
But he had done a good job accomplishing that. Luckily, he found himself ready now and just at the right time, for Sherlock seemed to have reached his breaking point. In the last three days Sherlock grew more and more agitated and his huffs of frustration weren’t as amusing to John as they had been in the beginning. Still, John couldn’t get over the fact that Sherlock hadn’t even once tried to talk to him. Surely, that nutter would rule out the most obvious solution. Instead he had tried to make John unbearably horny, trap him under his weight on the couch and on one occasion he had actually begged John to let him come. The last one had been the hardest test for John’s self control and left them both achingly hard and frustrated.
He heard a rattling noise coming from the kitchen that shook him out of his numbness.
“God.” John moaned as he slowed down again. He felt abandoned in time. Somewhere outside of this room the world was turning into a madhouse. It would take years for mankind to get used to their new biology but right there and then John didn’t waste a thought on the rest of creation. He considered this moment the height of perfection. Sherlock upon him. Around him. Here with him. This was what he had been waiting for all his life without even knowing for the better part of it. He felt Sherlock lean back into the strong hold of the tentacles. It gave John's thrusts the possibility to go even deeper. The Consulting Detective wiggled his hips here and there until he found the position he’d been looking for.
After he found out which source stood behind the latest quote, John was certain that the name of the poem held another hint for him. “The Passionate Pilgrim.” He smiled inwardly, despite the anxiety that still pulled at his guts whenever he thought about the possibility of being entirely wrong.
“Don’t worry. I wouldn’t just do THAT without asking you first.” John said smiling. He came to kneel over Sherlock again where he caught the detective’s attention by generously covering both their cocks with lube. Pulling Sherlock’s arm up from where it lay beside his thigh, John indicated for him to take hold of them. Entwining the fingers around hot flesh, Sherlock marveled at the cosmic fortune that had placed their dominant hands opposite each other.
He feels Sherlock entering the room and shuffling a bit closer but keeping a considerable distance.
“John, I…!”
Sherlock was out of it for half an hour but, while John was tempted to take a nap, it was just too early for the doctor to rest again so he entertained himself by letting his fingers wander over Sherlock’s back and arse. He made the tentacle retract fully to have more room for his explorations. Now, the mark he had left on Sherlock’s shoulder was standing out harshly against the detective’s pale skin. It made him feel ridiculously proud of himself for claiming the genius that was loudly snoring upon him. He pressed his nose into dark curls and reveled in their softness and smell. With great care, he closed his arms around Sherlock and rolled them over so he was on top of the sleeping man. Sitting back, he regarded the sweaty and sticky body before he decided to get a wet towel to clean them both up.
Sherlock turned around from the window as he sensed him but didn't stop playing until he saw the tension on John's face.
With an indulgent grin, Sherlock crossed his arms beneath his head and gave John a challenging look.
Swallowing hard, Sherlock shimmied lower and knelt gingerly down on John’s ankles before he focussed all of his attention on the obvious bulge in front of him. Almost dropping forward, he bend down low to nose at the desired flesh pressing against the fabric of John’s pyjama pants.

Entwined, they lay across the bed, recovering before the next wave would hit.
The tip of his index finger was moving in circles around the tight entrance. A gentle massage meant to introduce the sensation of touch.
He pushed himself almost fully of Sherlock’s cock before he sank down again. This time they gasped simultaneously. Sherlock looked in awe at John’s body as it moved above him. All this time, his hands had been lying limply at his sides but now he grabbed John’s hips to support him. John steadily established a comfortable rhythm, moving up and down on Sherlock’s hard arousal.
John took a few seconds to think about a logical answer. “An epidemic, most likely. Probably flu or something absolutely new.”
“God, no. Do you?” John said, slowly bending down while holding the detective’s gaze.
“Hmmm.”
John awoke with the feeling of nimble fingers caressing his scalp. Tiredly, he blinked his eyes open. Sherlock was lying right beside him on his back, petting John’s head with his left hand. A fond smile grazed Sherlock’s face as he watched his Alpha waking up. John’s heart clenched in his chest. At any other time, John would have tried to talk to Sherlock but as soon as he was fully alert to his surroundings, his body instantly reacted to the strong scent of arousal in the room. He let his gaze drift over Sherlock’s naked form, noticing that the Omega was fisting his refreshed erection with the other hand.
“So, what do you think?” Lestrade whispered enquiringly.
John felt the muscles around his cock tightening, the pace Sherlock was setting beginning to falter and turn erratic.
John watched the darkening sky while he attempted to dampen his annoyance.
“Oh, right yes. Talking.”
“Did you imagine us having sex?”
“Good night.”
His stomach gave an impatient growl and his face felt wet.
No, the tattoo was just a minor event in a bigger pile of occurrences. All these years, John had believed Sherlock’s claims of being above physical needs and emotional attachments but every so often a small piece of that facade did crumble away. Aside of the obvious proof for Sherlock’s ability to
For a second or two, John felt thrown back in time as they stood at the craters edge. The light they were following had more and more similarities with the gas lanterns he'd seen in old pictures. The ruins and lack of artificial light just served to strengthen the impression. Sherlock had already taken off his night vision and made to cross the 10 meters separating them from the light's source when John saw something move between the piles of gravel to their left. Silently, he grabbed Sherlock's arm and pulled him down into a kneeling position.
He spent the whole day avoiding his flat until there was nothing left to be done outside of 221B but doing some shopping. Realizing that it was overdue gave John a feeling of rightness that he hadn’t had in a long time. Strolling through the aisles, he allowed himself some luxury and chose to buy all the ingredients for his favorite gratin. John smiled to himself.
They remain slumped over each other until their breaths even out and Sherlock eventually rolls off of John. Lying side by side, they remain silent for a while longer, enjoying the afterglow and getting used to their new reality. In the end, it is John who talks first.
The consulting detective sat back on his heels and gave him a warning. “Now the legs.”Draping a blanket over John's upper body, he shuffled backwards, starting at the right ankle.
*****
Sherlock narrowed his eyes at him. He could only assume what was happening here but he was willing to try something, even if it would be a long shot.
“For a second I hated your offspring. Less than a second, I’d say.” Sherlock shook his head as if to shake off the feeling itself. “When I told you, I watched your reaction but I was too hurt to understand the change of emotion on your face. This whole wedding business…. “
John thrust hard and deep into him, pushing his knot against the rigid ring of muscles. He growled in frustration when he failed once again. His fingers already left bruises on Sherlock’s pale skin but John kept fucking into him, following his body’s demands.
Without Sherlock's help, the doctor wouldn't have had the confidence to perform a surgery after his long time of abstinence but his partner calmly listed the steps and needed supplies even though they both knew that it wasn't necessary at all.
John tried to ignore his first impulse, which was to give her an angry look. Instead he chose the polite way.
Yes. Ok. Another chapter is needed. Oops.

“It’s OK. Don’t worry. I know you’d never do anything like that on purpose.” The DI said, reassuringly placing his hand on John’s shoulder. “I am already used to them and, in fact, I think they changed my life in a very positive way.” Lestrade grinned inwardly.
Apparently, his former landlady had the least problem with this mornings painful interruption. Seemingly undisturbed herself, she fussed over Sean as he followed the noise to it’s source.
"How deep are we Mycroft?" He asked in disbelief.
John yells at her with all his might. Again. He should have known. Friendship can never be enough. And again he has to tell her all the reasons he has to run after Sherlock every time Sherlock asks him to. He talks about cases and victims. The things he is able to change for the better but she still doesn’t understand. She knows now. They all realize at some point. He needs it. The excitement, the adventure. The danger. And Sherlock. The best life he’s ever known. It all comes down to Sherlock, and though he tells her otherwise, he knows there will never be anything more important to him.
Cautiously, John sat down right beside Sherlock on the couch. For a few minutes they sat silently, both nibbling their biscuits in an attempt to keep mouths and hands busy.

The first thing he felt was pure disgust at the unfamiliar consistence of the thing's surface. His repulsion grew when he realised that there wasn't even a real consistence at all. He stared at the coat hanger as it slowly sank into the green scales. Blinking repeatedly didn't change what he was seeing. Worried to be suddenly pulled forward, John decided to draw back instead of just watching the hanger vanish but when he did there was nothing left of what had somewhat been melting into the creature. Beside him, he heard Greg swallow loudly as the both watched small clouds of smoke rising from the sharp end in the coat hangers former middle.
*****
Thus of every grief in heart
John immediately knew that it was a Shakespeare quote. Well, the language made it obvious. He jumped up from the couch to search through his books for the source when another thought struck him.
“But it happens everywhere. How could a virus possibly spread that fast?” The DI creased his brows in doubt.
When John left the room, he avoided the obligatory handshake. He knew where Doctor Rosen's hands had been. That shouldn’t be a problem. At least not for him, but John had had enough physical contact with Rosen for one day.
“Oh, that’s very helpful and so mature.” Sherlock rolled his eyes. The doctor didn’t reply, throwing him an angry look. “Interesting. You seem to be more affectionate when you are asleep.”
“Shouldn’t you know the answer to that?” Sherlock drawled in annoyance.
Narrowing his eyes, Sherlock let his gaze wander over the shorter man’s figure.
But before his fantasy had a chance to get out of hand John stretched and yawned in a put upon fashion.
He can hear John getting up from his bed with a creak and making his way down the stairs. When he hears the bathroom door close, he remembers that he isn’t as fresh as the new day, either. He gets up and stands in front of the bathroom in seconds. He isn’t sure if he is allowed to join John in the shower but thinks it's not a problem, considering what they are planning to do. He waits a few seconds until he hears the tap turn on, and can be sure not to disturb John on the loo. He gets in, deliberately noisy, to give John some kind of warning.
“We don’t have to. You know? Not that I don’t want to, but…”
John got up and ran to the dark doorway, coming to kneel again just beside the entrance, his back to the wall. Cautiously he peered into the darkness but he still wasn't able to make out any distinctive shapes. The rain was stronger now what made his attempts to listen for movement inside futile.
Mrs. Hudson yelled for them to come down. Her demand a frantic screech echoing up the hallway. Instantly John ran down following her scream, he saw Sherlock a few stairs ahead, his pace indicating that he was equally shocked by her panicked voice. John had been lying on his bed trying to figure out if he had to feel sorry or exhilarated about their last shared dream (
“Yes.” He encouraged with a hushed voice, keeping his body rigid against Sherlock's demanding thrusts. The laboured breath above him was all the answer he got as he felt the pace of push and pull increase.
Inappropriate stimulus generalization occurs when different situations fail to produce discriminative operant responding. Generalization is not always inappropriate and occurs when you respond the same to two stimuli that are not identical.
John couldn’t help the whimper escaping him. He turned his head slightly to the side and captured Sherlock’s mouth in one quick movement, startling the detective for a second. He buried his hand in Sherlock’s dark curls pulling him impossibly closer while his other hand slowly wandered over the other man's thigh. Eventually, John pulled away catching his breath and resting his forehead against Sherlock’s.
“I love you, John.” He said, sliding his hands down John’s chest until he touched the point of their connection. “I want you to make me yours. Take me, John.”
Every surface in the room was inhabited by various skulls. Not only human skulls, there were some cats, dogs and even a few mice skulls. On the couchside table, which was covered by not less than 12 of them was a small piece of paper neatly folded to stand like some sort of reserved sign in a restaurant. John took the two steps to the table cautiously and slow, fearing he might pass out from the absurdity. A quick look around assured him that he was alone in the room before he leaned down to grab the paper. He rounded the table and sat down on the couch, fiddling with the small note. A note. What else would it be?
to his sister years ago when he realized that he didn’t care much for neither politics nor status.
“I wouldn’t be opposed.” Sherlock stated with a rough voice as his eyes fell close. John felt him push back, the detective’s hip bones brushing his belly every now and then as he felt his cock harden at the smooth rhythm they were building.
“John!” Sherlock was standing by his side. “Are you alright?”
“They all see it. Every single one of them. They pretend not to. I am fairly certain that I am playing my role very convincingly though. Because I am the best actor. I am so good at it, you would be pleased. No, that is the wrong word. You would be impressed at how I developed the ability to make everyone believe that I am feeling better. That I am not feeling lonely without you. That I don’t have to struggle to get up in the morning. It helps, you know. I watch their relief when I smile at them and I am almost able to believe it myself.” He shrugged his shoulders at that.
John sank his hand into the dark curls pulling Sherlock into a tender but promising kiss. At the same time he let his other hand wander down to the Detective's tail-bone feeling the glide of a slippery limp over the back of his hand. Above him, Sherlock shivered when he felt the first intrusion of the smooth tentacle breaching his body.
Hello John. Pub? – Greg
"Agreed." Greg stated, ruffling his hair while he took a deliberate breath.
“But why is that? She never met her Alpha. Did the heat come anyway?”
“Sleep now!” John ordered and went into the kitchen to make some tea.
“John?”
“S’pose we’re not gonna find another view like that.” Sean said, looking around at the corrupted buildings and ruptured streets.
“He doesn’t have any.” Sherlock stopped him mid-sentence before he narrowed his eyes at him. “And you don’t tell him about them! Not about the real ones. Is that understood?”
Avoiding another glance at his reflection, Sherlock shucked his pants and let water run into the bath tub.
“Ok, John.” She said, giving his shoulder a little clap as she got up.
you, only in the way I
“About what, John? You, marking me? Or me, liking it?” Sherlock’s teasing was a seductive whisper. Seductive enough that John didn’t immediately notice the hand slipping into his pants and closing around his hardness. Giving in to the sensation, he let his forehead drop against a freckled collarbone.
They were lying on the floor in the living room. (The bedroom had been too boring after two days and the little amount of sleep they needed allowed them to use every available surface in the flat. They considered the kitchen table the best, and John’s chair the worst place they had tried, but the floor was the one surface that was reserved for languid, loving sex.)
Lovingly, he let a hand travel up the Omega’s back to rest it on the bruised spot that displayed their new connection. Out of an impulse, John pressed it hard and earned a passionate scream from Sherlock that fed his enthusiasm.
“Before you ask…  I don’t know if they are mine or yours. Both possibilities are just as likely. I think.” Sherlock corrected himself. Silence stretched between them while John considered the meaning behind the statement.
Sherlock wriggled his toes and balled his hands into fists.
John felt the hairs on his body stand on end. His knees somehow felt wobbly and abruptly it was way too hot in the room.
“Oi!” Greg whispered, interrupting their soundless conversation. The three of them were standing in the dark area between entrance and atrium, their backs turned towards each other to keep monitoring their surroundings.
“Oh, God!” John groaned.
Sherlock had expected things to move on much faster. In the end, he will not be disappointed.
Sherlock's lips were brushing over his collarbone, his scent apparently a thing to be cherished and repeatedly inhaled.
Nodding vigorously, John squeezed a rather generous amount of lube onto his hand.
“Absolutely.”
All of a sudden, John felt a familiar stirring in his groin. He forced a false yawn from his mouth and began walking up the stairs.
With Lauren, it’s much the same. They have dates and spend a disgusting amount of time together, but John always comes when Sherlock asks him to, and even comes when Sherlock doesn’t find a reason to call him back home. Probably this means progress. Maybe it doesn’t. Sherlock still counts on it though. He observes him closely every minute they spend together, watches for signs in John’s behavior that imply that he finally
“I’ll be in my room. You are going to have questions. Please don’t bother me every time. Write them down and I’ll answer every single one when you are finished reading.” John didn’t fall for his false arrogance but he didn’t tease Sherlock for his nervousness either.
“Nothing but rumors!” The false exasperation was thick in the amused voice. Sherlock made a face as if considering the truth of these
Certainly, he couldn’t just ask him.
“Yes!” John confirmed by grabbing Sherlock's lush arse with both hands and pressing his hips forcefully up into erratic thrusts.
After some minutes, John looked up at him, apparently having decided on a course of action.
Arriving at Prince Sebastian’s castle, Sherlock placed the one item he had brought with him carefully on the writing desk that was located beneath the sole window of his tiny room. Sliding his fingers over the violin case, Sherlock couldn’t suppress the feeling of being imprisoned. His chamber lay on the highest level of the castle’s tower. There were no curtains or carpets, only a wooden mattress and the desk indicated that it was actually meant to house someone. Someone who needed guards in front of his door.
John's response came fast and certain even though he couldn't hide a fond smile.
Just as he made to stand up to follow Sherlock into the shower, the world shifted beneath him in a most awkward way and he sat back hard. This time the shaking was closer to an actual earthquake and john tried to remember how much time had passed since the earlier one. He heard their mugs and plates clink in the cabinets before a distinctive
Sherlock shook his head, a movement barely visible the way it hung hidden between his arms. He’d just managed to find a rhythm, pushing back in time with the careful thrusts. He felt the sweat running down his forehead and collecting in his messy curls. His arms were strained with exhaustion already. Everything felt a hundred times more intense than it should have. It reminded him that all of this just happened in a dream even though it seemed as real as anything he’d ever experienced. Beside him he felt the mattress dip. Slowly, he turned his head and forced his eyes open to look at John. He’d never seen him in one of his dreams, only known that he was there, doing this to him. Now he saw that he was wearing only his pajama bottoms. The sparse hair on his chest was sweaty and faintly glowing in the dim light that had no source at all.
He pressed Sherlock’s legs tightly together between his knees while he used three fingers to scatter the lubricant generously over the Omega’s thighs and arse.
“The same thing that is happening in here.” He answered cooly.
Sipping his tea, John realized that it was not about the tattoo. Not really. He had always wanted Sherlock. Had always quietly harboured a strong attraction to the madman who had given him back what he had lost somewhere in the afghan desert.
His spine-tentacle moved behind him relentlessly. For a short moment he wasn’t sure if he should just let things happen to him, passive and just feeling, or if he wanted to explore every inch of John’s body. The doctor made the decision for them.
A wave of relief flooded his body but it was instantly pushed aside by a shudder along his spine as he watched his flatmate fall to his knees beside the bed, staring at his face in astonishment.
Doubt was something he’d gotten used to. He had doubts about his future, his feelings and sometimes he even doubted his past. In his weakest moments, there was nothing he was certain of, except one thing. He
John felt his own cock harden in shared sentiment.
Warmth spread through Sherlock’s chest and he started feeling light headed. In a surge of emotion, he pushed John against the door frame and kissed him urgently, pressing as close as possible against the doctor. His doctor.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Say it, Sherlock.” He whispered between kisses to the blatant letters on the Omegas neck.
“But it did.” John added allowing affection and more, probably too much, to show on his face.
“I love you.” He said dumbstruck.
“Erm…I…I have to go now, Sherlock.” Hesitating, he let his fingers slide over the ‘S’, feeling his eyes burn.
Unhurriedly, John got up from his chair and walked towards the examination table. With forced casualty, he chucked his clothes and lay down.
Reluctantly, he pulled out of Sherlock until only the head was still inside. He held it there for long seconds before he plunged back in. A deep, satisfied growl emerged from John’s throat when he felt Sherlock push back in time with his thrust. Remembering the only bit of his medical knowledge that seemed to be important right now, John pressed one hand between Sherlock’s shoulder blades, forcing his head onto the pillow. Emphatically, John pulled out and thrust right in again. Sherlock had turned his face to the side to get enough air. It gave John the opportunity to hear him moan hotly at the first brush against his prostate. The Alpha changed the angle a few millimeters before he pounded into him again but to Sherlock it made all the difference. Screaming incoherently, he fisted his hands into the sheet and tensed to keep his position exactly like that.
Mentally preparing himself, he took a deep breath and tensed his muscles before he pushed forward again. His eyes stayed on Sherlock’s face, partly to observe possible signs of pain but more for his own sake. With his eyes closed the stimulation would have been impossible to handle.
Sherlock.
Squinting against the broad daylight, Sherlock took the lead as soon as he sensed that there were no minds outside to be manipulated. Wherever the scavengers had gone, they were out of his range. Far enough for him and the others to be safe, assuming that the assailants didn’t have any sniper rifles in their possession.
In astonishment, he noticed that both books had been written by the same person and he supposed the third one was by that author as well. Gwenore Holmes.
“Ok. Ok, that’s… Sherlock, I’d rather not come without making it out of my knickers.” A little disappointed, Sherlock let John’s cock slip out of his mouth. Getting it over with, he pulled the offending fabric roughly off and threw it on the floor.
He looked around for something to nudge it with and found a coat hanger which was entirely too short for his liking but would have to do. Greg's dubious expression didn't make the situation any better.
… before the doctor got a grip on his facilities.
The feeling of utter fullness was almost entirely pleasant but when the first long thrusts began to graze his prostate, Sherlock was flooded with relief. He relished John’s strong certain motions and cobalt blue eyes that seemed designed to please him. Gradually, the sensation increased. John was upping the pace but it was obvious that he held back. His sighs were just as controlled as his movements.
The ground in front of the bunkers entry was a shade of brownish red, it’s repulsive smell leaving no doubts about the nature of the liquid seeping into the earth. A few meters away, John saw six men watching the door. One even looking right at his face but obviously successfully blinded by the illusion while another, probably their leader, held a grey sharp object in his hands that was dripping with a purple liquid. At his feet lay a lump of mutated flesh.
A groan was all the answer he got. Without a second thought, John pushed himself up the bed and leant against the wall, one hand still cradling the Detective’s skull through thick curls.
“What the hell did just happen?” John asked turning his back at the Consulting Detective. “What, in the world, just HAPPENED?” He yelled, not daring to face Sherlock out of fear that he’d not be able to keep his anger and disappointed bottled up.
Expectantly, John and Greg stared at him.
After seconds of astounded silence and exchanged glances between him and Mrs. Hudson, John mumbled “I know.” before he busied himself with a mouthful of berries.
Beta by glorious Umqradenied
“Sherlock, what are you doing?” Panic started to creep into John’s body. His fingertips tingled while cold shivers ran over his neck. “Sherlock, please answer me!” He was almost shouting now but he just couldn’t stop himself. Sherlock had still not shown any reaction. “SHERLOCK!”
“When I dangled there halfway in the hole something scratched me and, one way or the other, if it was Phillips or us, what happened in Shikoku triggered the epidemic. If it helps, we are not contagious.” He said to reassure John and temper his guilt. His flat mate’s expression was one of pure worry.
“Finally.” He quietly whispered, again and again.
Gently, he kissed John’s temple as he noticed the first signs of orgasm in the doctor’s movements. The feeling of John’s shaft as it thickened inside of him and the faltering breath against his neck drawing his attention to the way sweaty skin rubbed over his own cock.
“Oh...” A sigh was all the answer he got as the tentacle pressed into Sherlock. Deliberately, he made it establish a rhythm that drove it deeper into his lover at every thrust.
It was not the first time that he got his answer before having to ask a question, but that stopped happening a long time ago. His grin widened even more. He laid wallet and banknote on the desk to look up the rest of the message. Act 2, scene 3, line 44-45.
When John finally considers the fact that a reflex doesn’t have to be based on true conviction, fortunately it's late enough to go to the pub.
John had known for a long while that his relationship to Sherlock was different to every other friendship or working relationship he'd had before. He admired Sherlock's intellect and couldn’t fool himself into believing that he never thought of Sherlock as beautiful or even gorgeous. Still…. It was a huge step between fantasy and the first physical gay experience of his life. But he had to admit that the kiss was way too sensual to pretend it didn’t mean anything to him. And, thinking about it, he knew he wanted the kiss to mean something. He had indulged in his sexual identity crisis yesterday. Enough of that. Time to soldier on and do what felt right. But how far was he willing to go? And more important, how far was he able to go?
Sherlock’s orgasm had made his inner muscles clench around John’s knot, pressing it hard. John’s vision got fuzzy around the edges as the cramped ardour squeezed him to climax.
John languidly crawled over Sherlock, bending down to press a soft kiss on the plush lips before he crouched down between the Consulting Detective’s legs. His inexperience didn’t stop him from giving Sherlock’s cock an experimental lick.
As the Consulting Detective let himself sink down again, he felt John’s hard arousal against his pelvis. He groaned and made to take himself in hand again but John was quick to stop him. He knotted the fingers of both his hands through Sherlock’s thrusting lightly up between Sherlock’s cheeks. Two tentacles wound themselves around his calves and John’s thighs, binding them together. The tentacles coming out of the middle of his back slowly squirmed over his shoulders and looped through his armpits before they curled around his back and chest crossing each other. His position was strained now. His own limbs held him in place, his mobility limited to small movements of his arms and hips.
John felt the hair in his neck raising before he saw the movement in the corner of his eye and spun around pointing his gun towards a crowded corner underneath the stairway.
Sherlock watched him like a hawk as he sat back down across his brother.
“Don’t worry. Occasionally, I don’t wank when I am in bed.” John said when he noticed the slight blush that was rising on Sherlock’s cheekbones.
He wanted Sherlock to take what he offered so willingly. His body and his damaged soul.
John was slightly taken aback by this new medical revelation. How come he never even heard of this concept of sexuality? Why the hack did a knot form on his cock without the necessary Omega? He had been alone. On. His. Own.
“That is not dead which can eternal lie and with strange æons, even death may die. That’s what the man said to me.”
Sherlock blinked a few times. What now?
John grinned to himself while deliberately walking a bit slower and checking out Sherlock's rear view in a most obvious way before he asked “I don't know. Why would you?”.
For a few moments, all they did was breath.
Experimentally, he added his hand to the sensation, carefully tugging at the sensitive skin covering Sherlock’s testicles. The reaction was instantaneous but only partly the way John had anticipated. He felt the flesh underneath his tongue lift towards him, silky skin over hard stiffness, as the legs right and left of him were pressing against him. The next second, Sherlock scrambled backwards into a sitting position before leaving the bed in a hurry.
, precious.” He made an all-encompassing gesture with his arms.
But before John finished the thought he felt how the motion turned more gliding and gentle. The tentacle glistened from wetness now, having been drenched in Sherlock’s saliva. It retreated the way it came but never touched the Consulting Detective’s skin, instead raising itself higher before taking on a hook-like form and descending slowly between Sherlock’s cheeks.
“Proceed.” Sherlock almost whispered.
Sherlock stood beside his bed. Shirtless but wearing trousers and pants. Both had dressed for this day, for an awkward conversation that would hopefully end up in physical contact of sorts. Sherlock had noticed the second he saw John behind him on the stairs but his flat mate only considered in this very moment that Sherlock was actually wearing more than a dressing gown and pajama bottoms.
He groaned in desperation before making his way to the bathroom for a cold shower and probably a deep look into the toilet bowl for good measure.
His back and head hurt as John dragged himself up the stairs. In hospital, they had told him that he would feel very tired for a while but he hadn't expected it to be as extreme as it was.
“Am I terminally ill?”
“No. I want to bond with you!” John interrupted firmly.
“Sherlock?” John’s voice was small, almost anxious. Why should he be the one that was anxious?
Alpha?” Although he tried very hard, John wasn’t able to appear scandalized. His heart was doing strange things, like jumping up and down, in his chest. It was distracting.
“I wanted it. I wanted it all.” He spoke under his breath.
“If you must. Clearly, you do. You’ve been thinking about it since the minute we started.” Sherlock’s voice was dripping with disgust.
“You think?” John arched an eyebrow at that. A gesture closer to Sherlock’s usual demeanor than John’s. It made the consulting detective squirm uncomfortably.
“Please, sit down” John smiled at him reassuringly, making Sherlock's heart flutter.
There was no immediate reaction. Rethinking his discovery he sat up resting his feet on the wooden floor.
John rushed forward and retrieved his gun knowing that Sherlock was right behind him. He wanted to avoid any of them finding out what the trap held for it's victims.
Forgiveness was something that John rarely achieved. And in some cases he never did. It was just unbearable to play the loving husband while you fought the urge to run away and never look back. Or worse…. If you are  accustomed to violence, not using it can be hard. Especially if you are very, very angry.
Lazily, he pumped his hips, pushing the head of his cock against the tight ridge of Sherlock’s behind. He loosened the press of his knees on the Omega’s thighs and almost immediately slipped into his hot entrance. The lack of slickness inside of Sherlock made John feel the friction even more commanding and he bit his lip while he enjoyed the slow drag over his prick. With long, patient thrusts, John pushed in and out of his Bonded.
And Mike was very helpful, indeed. He had asked exactly the right questions leading up to one inevitable deduction. After they argued about it for almost three hours, John finally gave in and they proceeded to make a plan to prove their (Mike's) reasoning. When he now thought about the things this plan would require him to do, John began to worry about the outcome and blushed. It was a dangerous course of action he was about to take, and it didn’t surprise him at all that he was already giddy to start.
“Then why didn’t you stay in bed? You apparently just left it half an hour ago and didn’t even bother to shower before you left.”
Regaining his composure, Sherlock forced his hands back into action and continued with the next button. His mind was reeling with deductions and taking note of the doctor’s telltale body language while he was desperately trying to appear unaffected himself. John’s eyes followed his every movement as more and more pale skin was revealed.
(See the end of the chapter for
But Sherlock didn’t bother answering, he just stepped forward towering over the suspect and staring at him intensely.
Slowly, gradually, John lost the ability to tell night and day apart. He felt claustrophobic in the purest sense of the word. He'd spent hours imagining the solid steel separating him and the others from the creatures that had taken over his formerly safe reality only to turn it into a crawling, scratching defacement of life.
Sherlock was right, of course. John had just assumed that her body had been disposed of.
Quietly, he locked his door and stripped out of his pants. He was still anxious because of the events of his last attempt at self-pleasure but he just had to relief himself after this hiatus.
With a gesture of his hand, Sherlock waved him off. “Sure.”
“What?”
“OK.” He nodded thoughtfully. He knew that he wouldn’t have to be careful and polite with John. If it would get too much he could just say so but right now… Well, right now he was more than fine.
Nervously, John let his fingers slip into the cleft between Sherlock’s cheeks, gently probing while lustfully watching Sherlock.
John was heavy. Immensely so. Sherlock had to fight hard to pull him up the stairs and drag him over to the couch. The smell of beer and whiskey surrounded John like an aura that made Sherlock fear he might get drunk just by inhaling too deeply. He dropped John on the couch,  his usual grace vanishing with the effort. He stumbled a bit, almost toppling over and joining his completely wasted flatmate.  After finding his balance again, Sherlock stared down, deducing everything that had happened to John that night.
They had made good progress even though trying to be as silent as possible was taking its toll when it came to the speed of their climbing. Halfway between the 3rd and 4th floor, John just contemplated the fine round behind of his clever boyfriend as he was rudely pushed to the side.
“Oh, John! You are finally out of that horrible place.” Mrs. Hudson exclaimed in her singsong voice as John entered the kitchen.
“What? Would I have woken up next to you, if I hadn't?” He asked, his voice higher than he had intended.
“Lie down in the middle.” He was ordered impatiently.
Sherlock's energy returned with full force.

“Sherlock, I…I am definitely not able to have such a conversation with an empty stomach. Do I even want to know how you… Oh, don’t answer that.” John said, pulling his jacket on and making a dismissive gesture with his right hand at the same time.” I am going to do some shopping. Need anything?”
Silently, Sherlock did what he was told. He threw his shirt to the side and leant forward, supporting his wait on the desk. John’s anger had dissipated gradually with every bite of toast but now it welled up again.
“Turn around.” The wild woman commanded. Taking a deep breath, John turned his back on her and closed his eyes, waiting to feel the blunt tip of her knife or at least an angry demand to hand her the gun. But everything remained silent behind him. Cautiously, he faced her again. There was a look of disorientation on her face before she addressed Sherlock on her left.
“Yes. Good.” Sherlock sighed, pressing his heels hard into the mattress. With an appreciative tilt of his mouth, John decided that he could work with that.
“Eat. Actually. I wanted to propose we eat first.” Sherlock stated, wearing a façade of detachment.
“Moran.” Sherlock corrected. “Would that be something you want?” He asked, already at the door and slipping into his coat.
*****
He looked around but didn't see any movement or shape that made the impression of being alive. Sherlock pointed at the edge of the crater to their right. There was an indirect light throwing shadows over the edge. John couldn't estimate the distance between them and it's source but apparently he wouldn't have to.
“Well I suppose we could find an Omega who…”
Greg watched Mycroft struggle with the idea of propping Sean up to support his fragile stand but obviously wasn't able to make himself go through the motions. Greg wasn't keen on touching the strange mutant, either.
But not by evaluating old data. No use for that.
“A week ago. Precisely.” John answered with no little worry in his voice.
He felt a third finger probing at his entrance while the other two still moved inside him. However John did that was beyond him but he couldn’t care less.
Sherlock looked at him from the corner of his eyes.
“Mine!” John growled when it finally slipped in and bit hard into the curve of Sherlock’s neck. The skin was breaking under his teeth and the taste of blood was filling his mouth. The world turned white around the Alpha and an immense wave of emotion washed over him. For a few seconds he was sure he felt a second heartbeat inside his body but then it was gone and he was back on the bed in Sherlock’s room, buried deep inside the Omega. His Omega.
Sherlock wouldn’t have been able to break his gaze if his life had depended on it. So it happened that he didn’t notice Moriarty’s men until they were standing directly in his line of sight. Instinctively, he took a step backwards before he noticed that both men had turned their backs on him and were directly heading towards John.
Without further ado, John pushed his index finger through the loosened ring of muscles until it slipped fully inside the tight opening. Sherlock’s breath quickened marginally while the hand on his cock slowed down.
The first thing John noticed was the smell of Chinese food that made his stomach rumble. Then, several seconds later, he could feel Sherlock blink against his collar bone. His long lashes catching in the soft hair covering his chest.
“Well, it’s been a trying day.” With that he left as if they had been watching TV all night. Sherlock sat on the coffee table in midst the remains of at least 4 meals and some of Phillips’ notebooks. Dumbstruck, he stared at the door John had left open when he’d gone upstairs. Was he expected to follow his flat mate upstairs? Had he missed something? Was it just John’s way of fleeing the situation? How could John get a hang of controlling his thoughts at exactly the wrong moment?
Sherlock watched him as he positioned himself and pressed the tip of his cock against the widened entrance.
“You want to come up. See if John is doing O.K.. I assure you he is. We both are definitely O.K.. Now, go on watching that baking show.”
Pressing his forehead against Sherlock’s collarbone, John let go. The only focus of his mind on the feeling around his cock and making sure to give Sherlock enough friction, as well. The lube that had already vanished to a degree now being replaced by their combined sweat.
(See the end of the chapter for
The thought was comforting, soothing almost, and he realised he should probably tell Ella all about this at their next meeting. John groaned. Right. Ella. Tomorrow. John rubbed his forehead. Perhaps he could have her come to the flat. She had offered before when John was too stressed to head outside in the traffic and bustle of all the people. Maybe she would consider it now as well, if he explained about his experiences with Sherlock. Or if Sherlock wanted to go outside again tomorrow, it would be quite fitting that-
“Sir, is he a threat? I can make him go away, I haven’t been very trained for that but I can make it happen if I need to,” Sherlock said in a monotone voice that made John flinch, realising how close he was. John turned around and placed a gentle hand on Sherlock’s shoulder, shaking his head.
John sighed once more. “”Yeah well, it wasn't the best of situations if you can remember it past your hangover. Thanks for helping us as much as you did. I really appreciate it mate. JW”” John replied.
taking care of the android and not vice versa, he might be more inclined to do so. And it wasn’t a lie either. This particular android had been rejected, treated very badly by its past owner, and had a lot of issues in its programming from that experience. It was quite a phenomenon, really, and it seemed that’s why the government employee was as keen as he was assigning the android to Dr Watson in particular.
“Is it the park or the café in the park that has the croissants that you’re the most interested in hmm?” John teased a little and Sherlock blushed, looking down at his feet with a shy smile.
John typed a quick reply. “”Yeah, see you tomorrow. Don't get into any trouble now. JW”” John teased.
“Yeah, person. You’re the person that is the most important to me and we live in the same flat,” John smiled softly but groaned suddenly as Sherlock had squirmed closer, wrapping all his limbs hastily around John, squeezing him tightly.
John smiled to himself, sighing softly.
Once he was in his room, he looked around, tilting his head. It was quite bare, clearly not been used since Dr Watson moved in, not that he had lived there for too long. Sherlock observed the shelves and the small desk, slowly putting some of his belongings that he did care about ontop of it. Mycroft had told him that this time it would be different. That he would most likely have his own room, get to have his own things there, get to be more… Human-like. And Sherlock had doubted him. More than ever, actually, but Mycroft kept reassuring him that Dr Watson was different. And now he kinda felt that perhaps Mycroft was right after all… Sherlock scanned his room before sitting on the bed, observing his pyjamas. He let his fingers gently stroke over the smooth fabric, slightly cool to the touch. It was made by some anti-static material that was sure to not interfere with his loading, so he needed to change for optimal recharging capabilities.
Sherlock laid down in the bed, making sure he wasn’t more than one meter away from the WallBox, and a soft chiming noise was heard.
Sherlock rushed inside of the Holmes' residence, darting upstairs quickly. Mycroft frowned from the sofa in the living room, standing up and following Sherlock slowly. Sherlock quickly entered his room, going to his wardrobe and started picking out clothes. Too big. Too small. Not the right colour. Why did this matter so much? He almost ripped off the shirt he was having on now, still trying to find the right new clean shirt to put on. “What are you doing little brother?” Mycroft said with a raised eyebrow, entering the bedroom. Sherlock huffed. “It's none of your business, /big brother/.” Sherlock hissed back and finally settled on a perfectly sized dark purple shirt, pulling it on over his head. Mycroft hummed in thought as he watched his brother frantically look for a pair of trousers. “Heading somewhere?” He said, picking up a discarded shirt from the floor, holding it up against himself. Ugh, how was his brother so thin? Mycroft sighed softly. “Still, none of your business Myc.” Sherlock huffed, buttoning the shirt. Mycroft sighed. “You're going to the school rugby game aren't you?” He said softly. Sherlock froze a little but quickly continued his buttoning. “So what if I am?” Sherlock said, blushing a bit.
(See the end of the chapter for
“You… Can stay for as long as you’d like, or rather, leave when you feel ready to do so,” Mycroft sighed and corrected his suit jacket slightly before running a hand through his hair. “Seems I’m in no position to separate you at the moment so… That’ll be that, then. But do know Dr. Watson that I
John gently moved to the cupboards, and skillfully managed to find two bags of crisps. He handed the bags to Sherlock and poured two glasses of water for them to take upstairs as well. “Right, follow me. And be careful up the stairs yeah? I don't want you tripping.” He said and smiled, heading for the stairs first. They went slowly, and with each creak of the old stairs John bit his lip harder, hoping no one would notice. “Almost there.” He whispered to Sherlock but when he turned around, Harry had opened her door and peeked out into the hallway. “What on earth are you doing?” She whispered. John swallowed. “Trying to enter my room quietly what does it looks like I'm doing? Hunting for ghosts?” John said and took the last step up. Harry rolled her eyes. “Aren't you at the birthday party? You know, your /own/ birthday party? I thought you were sleeping over at Mike's?” She said softly. John shook his head. “Change of plans.” He whispered simply, Sherlock soon joining up by his side, standing on the ledge awkwardly. Harry crossed her arms and smiled a little. “Who's this then?” She said and nodded to Sherlock. John blushed and cleared his throat quietly. “This is Sherlock Holmes. And he's staying over because his brother is an idiot. Sorry.” He said and looked at Sherlock. Sherlock shook his head. “It's fine...” He whispered and looked up at Harry. She looked... mildly intimidating, but Sherlock could see that she had a lot of love for her brother. “Hello Harry.” Sherlock said softly and Harry lifted her hand in a small wave. “Hello Sherlock, it's nice to finally see you in person.” She said with a soft smirk. Sherlock frowned. “Have John been talking about me?” He said and John was about to just lay on the floor and die instead of having this conversation right now. Harry saw that, and grinned widely. “Oh he talks about you all the time. Any chance he gets. Good night.” She said and moved back into her room. Sherlock couldn't help it. He was smiling like a dork. Any chance he gets. John was talking about him, and often too. John however was struggling not to drop the glasses of water and he quickly moved towards his room. “In here.” He muttered, too embarrassed to turn around and look at Sherlock. Sherlock nodded quickly and entered the room quietly.
Second of all, they are sometimes more human than you and me, John, how would you feel if someone just tossed you aside like a piece of scrap metal?”
Chapter 36 - Trust me
“I think being here with you is brilliant,” Sherlock nodded and looked at John’s laptop. “Isn’t it quicker and easier if you type with all of your fingers?” He asked, changing the subject in a split second, making John chuckle softly and shake his head fondly.
Sherlock quickly slipped out of his robe and into the bed, patting the covers and smoothing them out on top of himself. He sighed and bit his lip. Should he also lose some of his clothing? No... No he was far too shy for that. He blushed and looked around himself, trying to think of something but he wasn't sure what. Before he knew it, John came back out and moved towards the bed, smiling softly. “Ready? I'll turn off the ceiling light but we can have the nightstand light on for a bit longer if you'd like. I'm not that sleepy.” John said and Sherlock nodded, John flicking the light switch beside the door. The room was now dimly lit, much more cozier than before and John hurried to the bed, flipping over the covers and crawling up beside Sherlock. “Hey.” He said softly, smiling. Sherlock blushed. “Hello...” He said awkwardly, looking at John. John sighed. “Is this too much? I can put some clothes back on, it doesn't matter I can sleep in my regular clothes it's fine I didn't want this to be too much I just thought-” John rambled on until Sherlock smiled and placed his fingertips on John's lips. “John, calm down.” He said softly. “It's not too much, or too little for that matter.” Sherlock grinned cheekily but then looked more shy as he removed his fingers. “It's just... new. To me. Probably not to you. Well with a man perhaps but...” He fumbled with his words, biting his lip. John nodded understandingly and took Sherlock's hand, playing with his fingers that had been on his lips. “Okay, well, I... I like being close to you like this, so you don't have to worry about me. And if it's alright for you too then... Then I'd like to stay this way.” John said sincerely and Sherlock was lost in John's eyes, not sure if he really was listening or not. He snapped out of it quickly though and smiled softly. “Yes, it's very alright with me.” Sherlock said and moved closer, his clothed body gently rubbing up against John's almost naked one. He then giggled a little, not able to help himself. “Where did you get those boxers anyway?” Sherlock said and John rolled his eyes and groaned. “Gosh, I knew you would bring that up...” He murmured awkwardly. Sherlock chuckled. “I like them. I like them a lot.” Sherlock said and nodded, his eyes a bit lidded. John looked up at him curiously and smiled. “You do? Well then...” He said and chuckled a bit himself. “I'll wear them more often.” He said and winked cheekily, both of them giggling and laughing together, the tension that was once in the room now replaced by laughter and a sense of relief that they both felt together.
“I SAID, END IT!” She screamed now. Sherlock moved to one side behind her, nearing the front door cautiously as if to cut her off before she could step through the open door but she obviously didn’t plan on leaving soon. John watched him raising his hand and holding it up in the direction of the hallway and he understood. Mrs. Hudson must have heard the screaming young woman and had wanted to see what the fuss was about. He imagined he could actually feel her retreat after being stopped with just one hint by the Consulting Detective. Sherlock’s finger pointed downwards in a repeated motion. Whatever it was he was trying to tell their landlady, John hoped imploringly that she understood.
The black rattan furniture was still there but dirty and wet to its core where it stood on the terasse. The railing was deformed but complete in contrast to its glass filling which was mostly cracked or entirely missing. The part of the bar that was roofed looked almost untouched, though and they decided to settle for the night.
*****
A loud scream prompted him to hurry. Sherlock reached the edge simultaneously to join him as he stared into the darkness. Even with the night-vision on, John couldn't see anything. They listened intensely but it still took them a few seconds to realize that there was a third accelerated respiration somewhere beneath them and that it was quickly coming closer.
“True. Do you know a John?” Sherlock asked with false casualty.
Sherlock blinked a few times.
John swallowed hard before he nodded again.
, they were just adding to his doubts.
“Not interested.” He said with his firmest rejection-voice.
“Sherlock, you’ve got a visitor. He is just talking to your father.”
“How…? I don’t… No, this can’t be true.” She stammered walking backwards and pulling her own hair. As the hollows of her knees hit the coffee table she sat down hard on it.
Sherlock was the one ending the kiss by raising his head. For a short moment John kept his eyes closed, still caught up in the shift of reality around him. Sherlock watched him with interest as he opened his eyes and his pupils had to adjust to the daylight pervading the room. There was a moment of silence where they looked at each other and didn’t dare move.
“I’ll be straight forward, ok?”
4 meters from the house, Sherlock unceremoniously dropped the corpse and straightened up. He could only suppose that Moriarty was armed in some way. Probably a dagger or even a sword. There was no way to know for sure and Sherlock did not have a clue where he could probably find a weapon for himself.
“Can you patch that up yourself or is that too much to ask?” John drawled, placing gauze on one corner of the table.
But John had other plans. This new relationship to Sherlock was unlike every other he had ever had and he wanted their first time to be a testimonial to that. In the last two weeks, John had build up his courage and ended up deciding that the way they would have sex would show his commitment to their correlation.
“No. It was the wound I got in Japan but if I am right, and I am sure I am, you operate as a catalyst to the mutation on people that haven’t evolved yet.” John stepped back from him letting his hands fall to his sides.
John supposed that the Consulting Detective already knew what he was doing half of the time.
Mimicking the experienced man, Sherlock began to push up into the tightness and delightful friction. With a sigh, John gave him a soft kiss before he raised his body to heighten the pressure he could put in each thrust. With closed eyes and his head hanging low, John upped the pace significantly.
“I have my moments.” He muttered, closing the door on his way out.
Mycroft and Greg had been trying to talk them out of it but with John's argumentation being reasonable and the promise that they wouldn't go further than the crater's edge, they finally agreed.
John sucked in a deep breath, grinning impossibly wide. Trying to appear unaffected he said determinedly “On your knees!” and bend down to kiss Sherlock’s back. The Omega pushed himself up, kneeling in front of John who took hold of his hips and licked a long stripe down his spine.
The next morning, John got awoken by a soft knock on his door. Before he was able to answer, Sherlock cautiously looked inside.
“Our dreams.”Sherlock corrected him.
John signalled Greg to come forward who in turn gave the signal to Sherlock. They stood a couple of meters away from their makeshift home, scanning the tall ruins around them. The sky above them was cloudy and grey.
“It’s O.K., John. He is gone. Come here and stop me from eating the plate.” Sherlock said calmly. Somehow, it helped to sooth John. Sherlock was there, in the same room, Lestrade was gone and they were alone again.
… John was pretty sure it wasn't anymore. And to him, it had never been.
“I… It’s no use denying it, right?” John said, somehow managing to sound defeated and annoyed at the same time.
He senses Sherlock hovering in the doorway, apparently uncertain how to react to an overly emotional John. Really not his area. But still….
“Don’t worry, Mrs. Hudson. John’s fine.” Sherlock told her, contradicting his own behaviour.
John felt stretched in a way that was neither comfortable nor painful. Experimentally, he sank further down and watched Sherlock’s eyes widen, his mouth opening as his jaw went slack.
John thought, pleased at Sherlock’s possessive gesture and the DI’s reaction.
“If you want to control my tentacles while we are being intimate that’s fine but never, ever do that under any other circumstances.” Sherlock said, his voice deep and provoking.
John was pretty sure that the older Holmes took detailed notes of the damage and already considered the cleanup effort it would take to return to the status quo. He envied his optimism.
He knew that he deserved a bit of excitement and the few scraps of affection he got from Sherlock but…
Silently, the others followed.
He leans his forehead against the cool glass and suppresses a frustrated groan. For a while, he'd been able to convince himself that he loved her, but even then he knew deep down that he was only fooling himself. The sex was satisfying but always left him empty and sad afterwards.
Two weeks had passed since Sherlock’s heat. They had a new case and Sherlock wasn’t even remotely as pliant as before. Agitatedly, he paced up and down the kitchen floor. Constantly talking to himself, he randomly picked up crime scene photos and stared at them for a few seconds only to throw them on the table again.
As he bent forward, John held his breath.
It was all the answer he needed, though. Not being of the talkative kind either when it came to emotions, he had no problem to understand. Sherlock’s lips pressed hard against every bit of skin they found, wandering from John's mouth to his ear, neck and chest.
“You didn’t hear it.” Sherlock said dismissing the information.
Quietly, Sherlock crept back to the house. He was decided to access the situation properly and wait for the right moment to attack when he heard Moriarty ordering his man to grab both of John’s arms and pull him upright.
A red puddle was forming beneath the strangers left claw while the color was draining rapidly from his face. Just when Greg readied himself to catch him the moment he'd faint, he heard the wheels of a stretcher echoing up the hallway.
“On your back, please.” Sherlock confirmed.
Before he could reply, the weight of Sherlock’s words sank in and John couldn’t stop himself from gaping at the consulting detective.
Bright sunlight fell through the window as John woke up to soft violin sounds coming from the parlour. Disoriented at first, he realised that he was still lying in Sherlock's bed with a soft blanket covering his overheated body. Looking around, he saw his dressing gown neatly folded on the chair across from him.
John’s heart was racing, his own pulse loud in his ears. His feet felt glued to the ground where he stood and there was a prickling sensation in his fingertips. It took him a whole minute to respond.
John was getting angry again. At himself. At Sherlock for not stopping him and, first and foremost, at Mary. He took a calming breath as he toweled his hair dry before being painfully interrupted by a cramp in his bizeps.
Amidst the endless corridors of the bunker, John was unbelievably grateful for Greg's presence. Even though he didn't see him all that much, when they actually met, they always had a nice and honest exchange. They probably used each other as a psychological rubbish bin but none of them did mind. In contrary. Sometimes they ran into each other in a corridor and it was clear that they were searching for each other. The topics of their conversations weren't always deep or serious but enthralling all the same. John had watched Greg gradually adjusting to their new life. Obviously, there had been a period of two months where Mycroft and Greg relished the newly found togetherness and used it to "relieve some stress" as Greg had noted in one embarrassing conversation a few days ago. John still tried to shake of the images that one information made form in the back of his mind.
Mrs. Hudson, Molly, that Adler woman, Janine… they all had had a different effect on Sherlock. Not to forget the horrid Mary-business.
“Two days, Sherlock!“ John gave him a fond look while attempting to be angry. “Did you even eat anything?” The detective wasn’t quite sure but nodded nonetheless.
“O-kaaay. Where is Sherlock?” Moriarty answered, rolling his eyes at him.
It took him longer than usual to relax enough to start with his ritual. He let his hand lay on his prick for a few minutes, just feeling the fabric of his pants between his hand and the skin of his cock. Trying to calm himself, John took a few deep breaths before he slipped his hand into his pants, and began to caress the shaft. He felt it gradually swell under his treatment, and closed his hand around the root. Again, he felt the small bump under his fingers.
“Sure. Could we…”
But he wanted to see. To commit every miniscule expression on Sherlock's face to memory. John felt the fingers on his back clench and unclench. He knew the signs.
John nodded in affirmation before he moved his hand in a forward gesture to tell the others to follow.
Agreeing, John got up and went to stand in the middle of the room. Expectantly, he motioned for Sherlock to go over to the desk. “Take of your shirt and bend over.”
“Call who?”
(See the end of the chapter for
With big strides Sherlock left the room and, taking his phone out of one pocket pressed speed dial before he left through the front door. John watched him distractedly. As if by force, his gaze was pulled back to the piece of tentacle that was lying in front of him and defacing his reality. He knew people mutated into all sorts of things but he had somehow considered tentacles to be part of his dream, a proof even for this fantasy to be less than realistic. But now as his false perception stared back at him he wondered how much of his dream had actually been reality.
As soon as John stepped through the door of their quarter, he felt Sherlock grab his arm and turn him around before he was forcefully pulled against the taller man.
When he had been “sick” and began to evolve, John had taken care of him and, at first Sherlock had mistaken John’s constant babble as a sign of worry and a way to break the silence. When he had seen an old man standing in his bedroom, holding an oak wand and staring at him, Sherlock had attributed it to his fever. Just like the choir he was constantly hearing that day.
Mycroft and Greg kept to themselves since they first had a long intense and very secluded conversation about dreams and the like. John was happy for them. They had actually won something out of their situation. Just like him and Sherlock, John supposed. When Mycroft left his quarter, he often appeared lost in thought. John had no doubt that the Politician still tried to find a way to rebuild some kind of civilization. Or maybe he only recounted weapons of mass destruction that were kept somewhere beneath their feet. If so, John didn't want to know.
He was sitting in the tavern, in the disguise of a traveling merchant, when he heard the men at the bar talk about a strange chain of thefts that were happening all over the kingdom.
Thank you for reading my attempt on Omegaverse. I hope you liked it!
“Nothing aside of the dreams and THANK YOU!” Lestrade replied slightly offended. “You?” He asked, curious now.
“Sherlock! Let me have a look at your thigh.” John yelled from the bathroom fetching his overly used first aid kit.
“I wanted you for myself, this time.” Mrs. Hudson smiled when John saw scones and jam on her kitchen table. Not a even a minute earlier she had called him down, using his full name which meant that it would be wise if he was fast.
gesture to make Sherlock keep a polite distance.
The only exception to the otherwise forsaken cities were hospitals and churches, although in many cases there was no immediate distinction between the two. Suddenly having found their faith, hundreds of people huddled in churches and ended up tending to each other during the painful time of transformation. Hospitals had closed down due to an overload of capacity on the first day. Many people stayed at home without the luxury of having someone tending to them. In the following days, most of them would be found dead or delirious in their bathrooms, under kitchen tables, on sofas or in their beds.
“Are you hungry again?”
“I want to see both your backs. Show them to me. Now.”
as answer when he moved up to his room but he hadn’t time to think about it. He could already feel his trousers growing tighter.
John smirked knowingly before he gestured for Sherlock to join him on the bed. The big mattress could easily accommodate the two of them. Meant as the royal suite, the whole quarter was large and overly comfortable but in the face of apocalypse Mycroft had chosen to safe his brother and his chosen little family over king and country. The former soldier found he didn't mind one bit, especially right now where he was thoroughly enjoying the benefits of being alive and in love.
“No.” Relief was palpable in the consulting detective’s voice.
“Breakfast is ready, John.” Sherlock said cheerfully.
“Never. It was an accident.” Sherlock said in a soft tone. The doctor resumed his explorations on Sherlock’s back with gentle pressure against the mouth-like openings.
John shook himself out of that thought. No dwelling on past mistakes.
Above him, Sherlock seemed to lose all strength and dropped on top of him while John still shook through his climax.
“You shot me.” It was a statement not an accusation.
Sherlock stared into his eyes so intensely that it made all other means of communication unnecessary. Thoughts and words and the rest of the world became a mere afterthought whenever they were together like this.
Apparently equally dumbfounded, the older Holmes just nodded as he gripped the gun tighter in his right hand.
when he’d followed her around for too long. At least that gave him a reason to run for the first time in a week.
John burned his tongue. The hot tea had found his lips by automatism as the good doctor watched Sherlock’s face intently and strained his ears trying not to miss a single syllable of his inner monologue.
So John had to just sit there and watch Sherlock working himself into frenzy, developing the nervous habit of flexing the muscles in his back when he was especially agitated and appearing to the rest of the world like the madman he was. John was just glad that the Consulting Detective actually remembered to eat every day. And that was something, wasn’t it?
3 hours later, Sherlock was silently standing behind his door, listening carefully for any sign of movement, his violin clamped under his arm. Time to leave.
He let himself be rolled over on his back. John, still lying beside him, let his hand slide up Sherlocks thigh. He softly kissed his neck while taking a firm hold of Sherlock’s cock. Slowly, he began stroking his hand up and down the hard length. Sherlock gasped at the first contact but at the same time he tried to collect as much information as possible about John’s naked body. He was just estimating the number of hairs on John’s chest when a thumb was swiped over the head of his cock and left him panting. Then he felt John rolling a condom over him before he applied some lube and resumed stroking.
He imagined himself spitting on the meaningless earth in front of him but decided against it. “You picked me up when I was broken. Thinking my best friend was dead. Thinking… That's how normal people lived. But you weren't normal. And I am not either. Obviously. Because I actually tried to forgive you for shooting MY BEST FRIEND!” Tears were running down his face and he took a calming breath as he saw Sherlock lingering only meters away. “This! Yes, this is

Sherlock looked sheepishly at him.
“Obviously.” Sherlock said taking a seat opposite her. John, too, had noticed her loss of weight since she had come to hire them but there wasn’t much else he could offer her. Bracing himself he sat stiffly in the remaining chair.
Wordless, Sherlock took John’s hand in his and pulled him down as he let himself fall backwards onto the bed. John caught his own weight with one arm, bumping into the Consulting Detective’s calf with his knee. None of them noticed, though. Sherlock had instantly begun to pull John’s jumper upwards what made it even more difficult to find a position that allowed them both to move freely. Trying to help Sherlock to accomplish his task, John pulled back but when he moved down again, Sherlock pushed him to the side by pressing against both of his shoulders. Irritated, John lay very still beside him and waited for the things to come.

“Sherlock?” John hurried into the kitchen while he was still struggling to breathe again. Sherlock was there packing things into boxes and obviously refusing to acknowledge John’s existence.
wasn’t as hard on her as it had been on Sherlock or Lestrade.
For long seconds, Sherlock just analysed the sincere expression and seemingly determined posture of the man on the other side of the room. Finally coming to a conclusion, he closed the door behind him and began to unbutton his shirt.
Greg sighed and started to walk back to the bunker, his tension palpable. John put his hand on Sherlock's arm to stop him from following.
While he tenderly sucked on a full lower lip, he maneuvered his tall lover back on top but before he allowed himself the physical indulgence his hard cock craved, John made himself stop all movement and take in the sight above him. The light sheen of sweat on Sherlock's chest and flat torso. The thin line of hair guiding his eyes to an equally engorged shaft that seemed uncomfortably confined in black satin pants.
On day six, he entered the dark hut, the same way he had done all the days before. With a feather in his hands.
Soon, he settled into a comfortable rhythm, making small movements to soothe the itch inside of him.
Without further explanation, Sherlock grabbed his right arm and pulled him hard down against him and rolled them around. Straddling John’s lap, he took hold of the doctor’s hands and pressed them down onto the mattress at either side of his head.
“It’s actually kind of funny, Sherlock. Sometimes, I am even able to laugh about it. Surely, you wouldn’t see it that way but….It’s just…I don’t know.” He tilted his head, staring at his shoes and the earth beneath them.
He had solved the case, saved John’s life and, better still, his initial fear for John had helped him to react even faster than usual.
“I thought you might want to rest for a while, so I planned it for five.” He stated with an assessing glance. “Do you prefer it earlier?”
Sherlock took a step backwards, regarding John from head to toe. A small smile appeared on his face as he moved to the side and walked towards his room.
“And mine.”

“I should have acted on that before it was too late.” He whispered bitterly, dragging his thumb over John’s lower lip and biting his own.
“Forget him. You’ll never see him again, anyway.” The maniac answered with an evil and too wide smile.
John barely managed to unclench his jaw and release Sherlock’s skin before he rolled blissfully off of his equally sated bed-mate.
John blushed before he got control over his reaction once again.
“Yes, there is….” He entered the room to talk to Sherlock but John quickly put himself in his way, blocking his line of sight. Furrowing his brows, Lestrade took a step backwards.
He brings his hands up to John’s shoulders and lets his fingertips lightly slide over the wet skin. Slowly, he moves them from the shoulders down John’s arms and lets them glide up again. John has stilled under his touch and goose bumps are blooming all over his back. Sherlock traces his spine down to the hollow of his back. Cautiously, he shuffles closer, almost pressing his chest against John. Almost. He breathes softly into John’s ear before he slides his fingers over the doctor’s collarbone.
Sherlock stepped closer, resting one hand on her shoulder his crisp white shirt stretching over his slim back. Swallowing, John watched the play of muscle before he shook himself out of it.
Adding more oil, Sherlock dragged his hands up and down the tense arms before he let them wander over John's torso with soft pressing motions. Watching him in fascination, the blond felt the tension die away. His back still hurt but he was absolutely certain Sherlock would take care of that, too. His sides were ticklish but with little extra pressure even that felt relaxing.
A small smile graced Sherlock’s face but it was quickly replaced by a pained expression. “No.”
“Hmmmm, John.... How tired are you?” His voice was deep and teasing. John knew it was completely on purpose, especially considering that Sherlock didn't need to talk aloud but it only served to make him grin and shiver at the same time.
“So why doesn’t John have ten… physical symptoms?” The DI had a point. Sherlock had thought about that for the last days and had only come up with a vague theory.
Behind him he heard the chair creak as Sherlock got up. John held one hand up to stop him from stepping closer. His head hung low as he stared at his feet. “No. You better don’t.” He said forcefully.
turn unbearable.
“Sherlock! Sherlock, can you hear me?” John’s voice pushed through the fogginess surrounding the consulting detective’s mind. He felt himself being pushed backwards until he rested on the rugged floor. John’s fingertips pressed against his neck before they vanished and Sherlock heard retreating steps.
And there, in the quiet togetherness of their shared flat, Sherlock could admit that he wasn’t sure about his own theories.
Hurried, John tried to rub the tears off his face. “You shouldn't have brought me here.” He whispered when he felt Sherlock's presence at his side. “Will you tell me what really happened on the tarmac?”
“Please?” Sherlock added impatiently.
----------------------------
“What?” John asked with a slight smile.
“You did.” He said pulling him close until he felt the fabric of John’s jumper scraping at his stomach. He brought his lips to John’s ear and deliberately breathed on his neck doing so.
The doctor couldn’t contain his own amusement as he sat down on his chair with a wide smile.
Sherlock cautiously entered Mrs. Hudson’s kitchen when John reached the bottom floor. Raising his brows, he turned back at the doctor motioning for him to follow.
I know, i know! I planned two chapters... Well, the bleeding plot took me off guard.
*****
“You are not the only one. The Woman was difficult to read, as well.” John’s face did something strange then as the hand vanished from his thigh and the doctor was back in his chair, a small pocketwatch dangling from his hand.
“Where did you find it?” He asked loudly to stop his landlady’s monologue.
The first rays of natural light fell through the slowly opening door.
In the following weeks, Sherlock heard more and more about this Prince James, but it never gave adequate data on the matter. Only superficial information about wealth and fame, the new Prince was piling up. Those things did nothing to help Sherlock gathering data about his opponent.
Sherlock was gently biting his way up John's neck, his hands roaming over the doctor's waist. John smelled leather and sweat as he leant his forehead against his lovers shoulder. With his eyes closed, he inhaled deeply and basked in the feeling of Sherlock's nimble fingers as they found their way beneath his jumper and pressed into the soft fleshy area just above his hip bones. Sherlock's breath was loud in his ear when he felt goose bumps spreading all over his neck and chest,
John noticed, with more than a little surprise, that he didn’t have a problem at all to sustain a rather impressive erection and (just as he had hoped) the obvious bulge. Now he would get his answer, of that he was sure. If he could just focus on the problem at hand, and not the one that tried to will its way into the foreground.
John insisted before hurrying past his lover, gun in hand.
“Well…” John cleared his throat to buy some time. “The last couple of times I…masturbated…there was this small, round swelling at the root of my…penis. It seemed to grow or deflate in proportion to my…erection.”
The clock over the counter of Café Nero indicated that it was almost 8 am when Sherlock ordered his tall Americano. While he waited to get his drink, he scanned the sitting area for the kind of person that would be able to give him the right advice. There were very few tables occupied, 3 by business men with their morning caffeine, who he didn’t take into consideration.  He preferred to ask a woman if possible. There were seven of them, one apparently a lesbian which was sitting at the exactly right angle to stare at a single mother that was talking agitatedly into her phone. Both were out. One table was occupied by four young women that were chatting like they hadn’t seen each other in years. Usually, Sherlock would have found the variety at this table intriguing. They all came from different countries although one was British, by all means. The other three had accents that indicated one German and two Spanish or Latin American origins. Sherlock entertained the idea of asking them, just for the variety of possible ideas when he saw the remaining female guest. Single but a string of lovers. Experienced, detached and extroverted. Reads magazines (vogue at the moment) but never the newspapers, so unlikely to recognize him. Perfect for Sherlocks purpose.
His dismay every time Mary put him down with words, the anger he felt boiling under the surface. The threat posed by a psychologist and the way he rejected Sherlock. They all had a source in real life but were so enhanced that they became completely ridiculed and over the top.
“This is not the end of the world, you know?” He stated dryly, observing the state of their fridge from his usual position on the chair. “Humanity, though.” He added thoughtfully.
“John, you should clearly know by now that I don’t burden myself with emotions or attachments. I obviously failed to do so regarding my newly developed feelings towards my straight colleague and flat mate. The last few weeks have made it clear that it already affects our cohabitation and I don’t wish it to do the same with our working relationship. If you would excuse me now, I am almost done packing and wish to finish as soon as possible.” Stoically, he turned around and peeked into the box as if to make sure that none of it's content had magically vanished during his short occupation with something else.
John held it up to read the fractural scripture on the cover.
“Did you hurt yourself?” He asked seriously.
“So… dreamed something interesting lately?” Sherlock asked with amusement in his voice. The blush that appeared on the DI’s cheeks was answer enough.
Although he tried very hard not to, John constantly worried about the bulge. Two days after his last strangely exciting observation, he went to his urologist. Being a doctor himself, he already knew that it was a far from common problem. He had ruled out the obvious diagnoses on his own. He was sure that it was neither a STD nor some kind of wart. John thought a tumor to be highly unlikely but didn’t feel certain enough to judge it on his own.
Impatiently, John listened to the sound of running water and tried to not follow Sherlock into the bathroom. Not for the remaining 4 minutes anyway. But if he’d take only one minute longer…. John didn’t even have a clock but he was fairly sure that Sherlock was back sooner than promised.
Seeking relief, Sherlock gradually picked up a faster pace. He moaned when he felt John’s knot press against his entrance. It felt too big but Sherlock wanted it inside of him, none the less. He twined his arms around John’s neck.
The Consulting Detective immediately invaded John’s personal space, leaving no distance between them. John had to strain his neck in order to catch a glimpse of his impression but before he had a chance to relish the slight blush on Sherlock’s face he felt full lips against his own. If he’d ever allowed himself to imagine such a thing as kissing Sherlock Holmes he would have never expected it to be hesitant and soft, innocent even. It felt like a relief, a desperately needed gulp of air after holding ones breath under water. They didn’t touch each other. There was no grabbing or fumbling. No moaning or sighing. Just the gentle press of lips against each other.
Startled, he realized that he valued John’s life higher than his own. He just knew that it was his job to protect John’s life at all costs. Looking back at that Moriarty incident he had probably known for a long time.
The only feeling stronger than his frustration was longing. A deep and intense longing.
With hazy vision, he couldn’t do anything but watch as Sherlock let the dressing gown slip to the floor and headed to his bedroom. The detective stopped in the middle of the kitchen to note with satisfaction how John’s eyes had followed the movements of his bare arse.
Sherlock nodded in affirmation.
The artificial light, Sherlock let immediately illuminate John's surroundings, barely cut through the dust hanging heavily in the air.
Breathing out, Sherlock kept himself completely still while the slippery limb drew back and left his body. He expected to feel John pressing insistently against his entrance any second but the soldier had other ideas. With a gasp he noticed the unfamiliar sensation of heat and tightness and John. It took him a moment to recognise that this perception somewhat crawled up his back. An odd but entirely pleasant feeling, he realised.
He didn’t look up when he heard the front door fall close. Supported by his hands on the worktop, John tried to calm his whirling thoughts. The unnatural silence outside of their flat made it all the harder to fight the panic inside of him.
It was well after dark when Sherlock arrived at 221b. Deliberately slow, he made his way up the stairs. He could already hear the TV, drowning out whatever thoughts John might have had at the moment.  At first Sherlock didn’t see him anywhere but he knew that John was somewhere in the room. Even though John sometimes forgot to turn the TV off, as it happened so often lately, Sherlock just knew that John was close by. He hung his coat on the hook and, sitting down on the coffee table, pulled off his shoes and socks. The only source of light in the room was the changing TV picture which blinded Sherlock somewhat.
Still, the man made no sound and even though they didn't know why, John and Sherlock remained silent as well.
Resting his hand on a claimed thigh, John began to press in. He was fairly certain that Sherlock’s body was not as well prepared for the intrusion as it could have been. Torturously slow and pressing down on the detective’s lithe body to stop him from wriggling, John drove his hips forward. Already biting his lips in effort, he felt the head move past the tight ring of muscles. With a groan, John paused to get used to the fierce sensation and give Sherlock’s body time to adjust. Even if the man in question was not willing to allow his body a break. Still holding him in an iron grip, John made him wait.
Naturally, the King was a very rich man and there were few things he had to worry about. But though his son was of strange beauty and the reason of his wealth (he had been a very difficult toddler), the king had no bigger wish than to see him married. Unfortunately, his son had his name for a reason. He was extremely moody and seldom spared anyone his temper though he almost never cried these days. And his temper flared up every time someone used his full name. He detested his name with the power of three-thousand suns. He preferred being called by another name. A name of his own invention.
John just considered stealing a kiss when a hand shot up between their faces and he shrank back. Before he had even made a conscious decision he helped Sherlock, who was holding tight onto four digits, by grabbing the wrist. They used their body weight and all of their strength to crawl backwards but it took them over minute to pull the man over the edge. Something was still holding onto his leg and kept pulling hard.
“That’s kind of what they did now didn’t they? Everyone giving up on me all at once?” John rebutted quickly and Ella lowered her gaze slightly. She walked right into that one, didn’t she?
“Ah. Sherlock. How was school today? Did you try making any friends this time?” Mr. Holmes smiled as he entered the kitchen. Sherlock sighed. “Father, I'm not twelve years old, I'm soon eighteen, I don't need to make friends.” Sherlock complained and sat down in his chair, crossing his arms like... well, like an angry twelve year old would do. Mr. Holmes chuckled. “Alright alright. Well, as long as everything went fine I'm happy.” He said and sat down in his chair. Sherlock nodded. “It went... Fine. Dropped my books. Some idiot started to fondle them.” Sherlock huffed. “You mean, try to pick them up?” Mycroft butted into the conversation as he entered the kitchen. “Do you really think someone would steal books at that school? I would be surprised if the students even opened them.” Mycroft continued and sat down. “Now Myc, that's not fair.” Mrs. Holmes said and Mr. Holmes nodded agreeingly. “Your mother's right you know. It's a well known school and they have really good teachers there.” He said pointedly. Mycroft huffed. “Well known for what? That is the question.” He said and sat down, instantly starting to plate up as Mrs. Holmes put the pots on the table. “Oh my you look starving Myc, was your last snack a whopping ten minutes ago?” Sherlock teased. Mycroft glared at him, about to open his mouth when his father raised his hand. “Enough. We're having a civilized dinner right here and now. It's late, your mother has worked hard in the kitchen, and we're going to enjoy this as a family. Understood?” Mr. Holmes said firmly and both boys lowered their heads and nodded. “Yes father.” They both replied and began eating.
*****
John’s head fell back against the bed when Sherlock rolled off of him. For a few seconds they just lay there while their breaths got back to normal.
“I made tea and if you go buy them, we could eat scones and have breakfast while I answer your questions. If you still want me to, that is.” Sherlock replied with faked confidence.
“Fantastic!” John smiled at his new note, walking over to the desk. He sat down, digging around in his pockets for his wallet. When he found it he pulled out the 20 quid he had meant to use as a message. “Brilliant!” He grinned shaking his head. In the corner of the banknote he had written:
Experimentally, he lifted his hips to press closer.
He heard the detective sigh in fake boredom as he made his way through the kitchen. Thanks to Mrs. Hudson’s talkative nature Lestrade was only now climbing the stairs. John opened the door to let him in, a strong wave of guilt rushing through him at the sight of the DI. It wasn’t that he was looking different to any other time they had met but with John’s knowledge about what he’d done to him, he just couldn’t help it.
*****
“John? Would you please come out of that goddamn shower?” The hoarse voice betrays his attempt at nonchalance but John reacts immediately, stepping out of the bathtub, almost slipping on the tiles of the bathroom floor. He catches himself on the sink and snatches the towel out of Sherlocks hands.
With a nod and a touch of his hand, John signalled for Sherlock to close the door. Greg helped turning the rotary control to ‘Close’ before he listened to the description of their surroundings.
“Please, take off your trousers and underwear and lie down on the examination table. I will have a look at your member first, and then I will give you some private time before I come back and look at your erect penis. “
Fighting the urge to laugh at the ridiculousness and biting his lower lip, John looked at his initials between Sherlock’s legs.
Sherlock had already passed him by and entered the bathroom where he stood unmoving for a few moments.
A minute later, they reached the door where Mycroft was already waiting for them with a serious expression on his face. Sherlock purposefully placed a hand on John's behind at the last two steps just to enjoy the small twitch in his brothers face.
Before he could reply with something insignificant like
“Oi, don’t take it out on me!” The DI held up a hand defensively. “Let’s just have a coffee while you tell me what’s going on.” Sherlock smirked at him and nodded before he took the lead heading for the elevators.
“John!” Sherlock interrupted his line of thoughts. “You can do that later. I am starting to freeze here so let’s get it over with.” It was apparent that he tried to sound annoyed but the doctor didn’t miss the nervousness in his voice.
“I see.” Sherlock nodded to himself. “You probably need a few hours to yourself.” He said in a false attempt at empathy. John didn’t fall for it for a second.
“Would you like to make that happen, Sherlock? Erm…Now, I mean.” The doctor still fought to calm his heartbeat when Sherlock took hold of his hand and pulled him out of his chair, leading him toward his bedroom. He stopped dead. Still holding John’s hand, he turned around to look at him.
He wanted to tell Sherlock to come but couldn't. His own impending orgasm taking control of his body. His hips moved of their own accord in counter rhythm to the hard cock pushing him down into the mattress. The muscles under his hands tensing until his fingertips couldn't dent them anymore as he heard his name sighed like a prayer into his ear.
Beta by wonderful Umqradenied.
was a posh affair or had been before everything turned to Dimension X
You did it again. You spoke this language from before.
The 24 minutes between ordering and delivery were probably the best in John's life since he’d been 16. Similar to his first kiss, the quiet explorations of skin and the murmured encouragements in his ear, filled his entire being with a mixture of giddiness and calmth.
“John, I can’t….It’s so hot! My skin feels too tight and…and... The other symptoms are showing, too.”
Sherlock wanted to tell him but he couldn’t do anything else then moan helplessly as the tentacle slowly pushed inside him. He felt the constant pressure, how it stretched the ring of muscles and started to move against his inner walls. John’s breath was filling the whole room, almost drowning out Sherlock’s gasps and wordless demands for more. He felt his arms being pushed downwards against his shoulders before he finally understood and struggled into a kneeling position.
He slapped himself, mentally. Painfully obvious!
Before he could prioritise his needs he was pulled up to a stand and held there by strong hands.
*****
“Ok.” John said, nodding to himself before he decided to occupy his whirling mind.
Without looking at him, Sherlock made an annoyed sound. “What, John? Did you really think that I don’t get affected by our close proximity?”
“You probably think I am an idiot.” By the end of the sentence, John realized what he’d just said and to whom. They shared a small smile when Sherlock made a dismissive gesture in response.
John was watching him with rapt attention, not bothering to hide his obvious enthusiasm. To Sherlock, it was a sight to behold. He had been waiting for John to just finally
Prince Sebastian was a bulky, wild looking man that always appeared to be on the way to chop down a tree, wearing dirty brown trousers and ugly checkered shirts. A stroppy dark beard covered the biggest part of his hideous face but his eyes gave away enough of his violent personality.
“I just thought that I love you, too.” His voice was barely audible in the quiet room.
With their faces being this close, it was impossible not to kiss the clever doctor into oblivion. Somewhere between languid and passionate, John’s lips were mirroring the intensity of his thrusts. Unrestrained moans interrupted their kissing with every push of skin against skin.
There it is. I don't know how I managed to write something like tentacle porn that fluffy but...Here we are!
--------------------
For long moments, Sherlock was somewhere between
“My brother will be here in five minutes. The Helicopter has four places left. Go and get Mrs. Hudson.” He ordered looking at John with an indefinable expression on his face. John nodded at him and moved to the door but came to stand just before the threshold.
“Why? It feels good to be naked. Does it make you uncomfortable?” Sherlock asked incredulous.
“I don’t understand. What
Apparently satisfied, John let his hands wander up and down Sherlock’s legs, obviously planning his next attack on the tempting body.
Carefully, he tried to push the chairs away with his right foot. The resulting screech appeared deafening but the thing in the corner seemed unfazed. John wasn't even sure it was still alive.
Pressing his head into the doctor’s shoulder, Sherlock felt arousal unfurl in his guts. His thighs tensed were they pressed into John’s hips as he sealed his eyes shut and listened to their quickening combined moans.
---------------------------------
He positioned himself, staring at Sherlock who had gotten up again and shimmied out of his trousers and underwear. It distracted John to the point where he almost fell off the other side of the bed during his attempt to get rid of his own trousers and jeans and had to stop himself from moving. Even though, Sherlock wasn’t fully erect he was able to imagine what that would look like. The freckles and scars on the pale skin where anything but perfect, the bones a testament to bad eating habits.
*****
Waking up with John Watson was, what Sherlock would call, a rather unique sensation. Aside of the fact that it was unusual in itself that Sherlock slept during the day, that was.
Sherlock was pacing up and down, rereading the letter over and over again before he stopped dead in his tracks.
For three days, Sherlock was utterly left alone except for the chambermaid that brought him his food. He had used these days wisely, finding out when the guards changed and interrogating his chambermaid about possible ways to flee if he had to. Luckily, she seemed to be quite taken with him and wasn’t as stupid as most people Sherlock had had to talk to in his life. He avoided addressing her though to not disgruntle her by using the wrong name (again). He forgot it all the time. Something like Milly or Maggy.
“I think that’s been enough talking for today.” Sherlock’s heart began beating wildly in his chest. Images of the possible outcomes of their evening filling his head with that short sentence.
When he began to mouth down the shaft he heard an unsated whine that made his hands leave the mattress and grip John’s thighs hard. This close, he could smell fresh sweat and soap. Apparently, John had showered while he was gone. Without a conscious decision, Sherlock pulled on the fabric under his hands and observed the way the movement raised John’s cock before it slipped free of it’s confines. No underwear. Interesting.
“Oh.”Sherlock sighed above him.
Even though he didn't mean to, John's need made the spine-tentacle slip deeper than before.
“Do you really need to go out again tonight?” She asked in worry. “If there is nothing to be seen why would you need to see it at night?” Her sceptical expression reminded him of Sherlock's deduction face.
Ahhhh.”
“I don’t know why you care about…” He complained mostly to himself when John pulled him roughly up and kissed him into silence. Wrapping his arms and legs around Sherlock, John grinned before whispering “Shut up and let me try something.”.
The so-called
After 30 minutes Sherlocks patience (Well…) breaks.
When he left the bathroom, there still was no sign of Sherlock. Trying his best on the observational skills he had so often witnessed, John took in his surroundings. The room was packed with various case files, as always. There was Sherlock’s blue dressing gown lying on the floor in front of the couch. The book shelves were dusty and overflowing with enough reading material for at least a century. The skull was watching him with disinterest and Sherlock’s chair was completely invisible under a huge pile of dirty laundry. John’s chair, on the contrary, was empty but for one book lying in it.
Carefully, Sherlock sat up and rubbed his eyes. His hair was a mess, standing in every direction because of John’s treatment.
“How long?”
“I…Excuse me.” Sherlock almost fell from his chair, stepping on the long coat in his haste to flee.
*****
“I was not all that happy. It frightened me. And it meant that all we had was lost.” John said, taking his hand and entwining their fingers while they watched the painful memory replay.
He had finally done it. Found his bravery and overcome his fear.
“Because it’s always the two of us, isn’t it?” Sherlock said smiling uncertainly.
They talked until noon, both avoiding everything that had to do with Sherlock’s upcoming heat but the earlier tension quickly died away. As always, they had no difficulties to talk to each other about everything that came to their minds. From assassination to zoophilia.
John takes hold of Sherlocks glistening prick. He is so close, so fucking close now. John’s hand strokes the hard flesh urgently while he tries to last just a little bit longer.
There was no reason to leave the bed and Sherlock couldn’t imagine finding one in the near future.
John stumbled into the hallway holding his ears to no avail. Passing him by, his lover had already given up on defensive gestures, having accepted that the sound was coming through his mind as much as through his ears.
“Fuck, yes, I…Christ, that’s..” The rest was drowned out by Sherlock’s thought’s pressing into his head and filling his consciousness.
“Faster!” The tentacle picked up pace, literally pounding into him.
He throws himself on his bed and sighs loudly.
Before she met his father she’d had a unique gift.
“OK. Assuming that it’s the same what has been going on with you it is probably just a strong flu going around.” Sherlock didn’t even try to hide his irritation this time.
“That was a good one. I will have to thank Lestrade for it.” Sherlock said with a voice full of excitement.
Only to regret his decision on the day of his wedding.
Not as aimlessly moving as he wanted to make himself believe, he found himself mechanically unlocking the door to his old life. Minding the time, John tried to take the stairs as quiet as possible as not to wake Mrs. Hudson. He sighed in relaxation when he heard Sherlock muttering through the door to the parlour. He enjoyed the times when Sherlock didn’t notice his presence and just kept on rummaging through his mind palace. Somehow, it felt like home to John. With the convenience of avoiding a cutting remark about his relationship status.
“The other one, John.” Sherlock said with an amused smirk.
Even though he had successfully appeared cheeky and confident when he went into his room, in truth he was anything but. He had a strange feeling in his chest. A tingling sensation he usually felt when he was in immediate danger. And wasn’t he? How long had he watched John for hints of attraction? Tried to make him flustered, intrigued or even aroused with the most ridiculous cameos. A few minutes ago, John had unknowingly joined in into this dangerous game.
Keeping his pants on, they'd said
Time to prepare everything.
“Sherlock?”
John didn’t touch himself for four days.
?” Lestrade said defensively. “Just bloody tell me what the heck really happens out there!”
“Just to make sure. “ He answered weakly.
Unsettling was not so much that the thing was flying in spite of not having wings or anything similar but that it’s color made John feel dizzy and his thoughts tangle in on themselves. Green-ish orange ranks with purple-ish yellow joints had hung loosely from the fat round and squirming body. It’s surface seemingly in endless motion, appearing as if every last part of the repulsive object was at war with it’s peers.
"John. Haven't I been an admirable example for self-control in the last months? Have I not been companionable and cheerful even though this whole situation should have made me the first one to actually get killed?" Sherlock asked confidently.
“S’pose Sherlock wants to examine it, anyway.” He let himself be pushed out through the door as he decided to put the limb into the bathtub.
“Sherlock….” John whispered now.  “What is going on out there?”
“I will be. Just give me a few minutes.” Her voice indicated differently but John was grateful for the answer.
John took his left hand away and, seeing bruises form on Sherlock's skin, let his fingers slide around a pale waist to take hold of his lovers lean arousal.
Under the shower, John made a mental list of the things he had surprised himself with. The list was short but rather intense.
“I didn't mind. Although it would have been better if you hadn't chosen to lie in the middle.”
He was not one to dwell on the softer emotions but, as Sherlock liked to point out, he was a romantic man.
The moment Sherlock had returned into his life, John had immediately lost interest in pursuing a relationship with Mary. But he had been angry. So
“Attached to…” John managed to splutter.
*****
“Sherlock?” He asked through gritted teeth, pressing his fingers into the pale skin at Sherlock's hips.
“Sherlock, would you come here for a moment?” John all but shouted down from his bedroom.
“Well, obviously.” John replied, sitting up on his heels. “ Should I have…. Did you want me to leave?” Anxiety was flooding his whole body. He felt his stomach cramp and and his head spin. His hands found the blanket underneath him and began to clench around the soft fabric.
