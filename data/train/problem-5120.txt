"I don't know, Steve." The hand leaves his forehead, and he moves slightly, chasing it. It's strange, but it's nice. "Tony Stark is a mystery to me."
"Then tell me!" Howard exploded. "I don't know how many times I have to say it, but I'll say it a thousand times more if that's what it takes!
Since this was all supposed to be in one chapter, I take no responsibility for the semi-cliff hanger. It just worked for how I was breaking the chapter up into three separate ones. LMFAO I'm sorry!
"It was fine at first. I mean, I tire quicker. But I'm grounded now." He shrugged like it didn't bother him, but Avery and Steve knew better.
In the weeks that followed, Tony continued to deteriorate, his mood souring to the point he was barely speaking to anyone, just curling up against Steve and reading, or flicking through his tablet. He barely got any work done, though he managed to attend two Stark Industries meetings.
Steve grinned, a mischievous glint in his eyes. "She definitely did. And she was a part of them. Besides, I'm sure you and Tony will gang up on me often enough." Which made his face go immediately red. "I didn't mean it like that!" he exclaimed, his face horrified as Howard's started laughing so hard he was bent over.
"Bratwurst or schweinshaxe?" Tony asked, looking over his menu at Steve and Bruce, though Steve couldn't see it. He had his nose buried in the folds of the pages, sometimes making a noise of appreciation for what he saw and sometimes making a sound of disgust. Tony shook his head, amused, and turned to Bruce.
"I want to go home. Back to the tower. I need to talk to Howard and end this once and for all." Looking up, he caught Steve's eyes, shining in the dim light of the late afternoon. "Can you get the quinjet ready?"
"High possibility with your symptoms. In fact, I'll order the celiac panel, along with your other bloodwork," Avery noted in the chart. "What have you been eating?"
Even like this, so wrapped up in busying himself, Tony was still a sight to be seen. Beauty amid chaos. That's how Steve saw Tony. Not just in that moment, but always. He was surreal, ethereal in ways Steve could never even find the words for. His brilliant mind like the Jackson Pollocks he adored, colorful disorder with no obvious reason until you actually stepped back and could see the whole picture. How order could be made from mayhem.
"I'm glad my pain is amusing to you, Stark." Still hunched over, Clint sat heavily on the couch. "I think you ruptured my spleen."
"Pushy, pushy, Mr. Stark." But Steve obliged, pressing the tip of his finger just past the rim. "Have you done this before?" He leaned his head against Tony's leg, watching as his finger disappeared inside.
As he slides into the backseat, Tony feels like a weight has lifted off of him; he doesn't see the shadow of Obie at the doors or the twisted glare on his face.
Looking down, Tony rocked onto the outside of his feet. The action so childish he sent a spark of protectiveness through Howard. "I'm in a relationship."
"Oh, uh, sure." This was the part of being in the Avengers he couldn't get used to: People who weren't nearly as afraid of him as they should be and the heroics of it all. Natasha sometimes felt the same way. They were the bad guys for so long that it was startling to think they were admired in any way.
They turned heads as they weaved through the tables, two heroes, beautiful and strong, one deadly in her training, the other more intelligent than anyone in that restaurant combined. Some of the looks they received were of a different appreciation, though. Tony knew Natasha could recognize them just as he did: the leers, the envy, the lust.
Tony blew out the breath he didn't know he was holding. "So, if I were to, I don't know, go up to him and ask, what do you think would happen?"
for Tony? Was he unplanned? Unwanted? But no. Even now, with the information he had, something was swimming up inside Howard. A fresh feeling of, dare he call it,
Steve couldn't help but agree. "You've shown a bit of your temper here. I think it's balanced out enough it won't affect you too much. I'm not going to pretend to know everything about this." He shrugged, holding his hands out palms up, offering Howard everything he had. "But maybe it evens out. The bad in you that stayed wasn't able to balance back out because those emotions are so heavy. But with the positive ones, maybe you'll be able to shift back into something more familiar in the future."
But he was a murderer. A gangster. Everyone knew what he had done to earn his place as the Don of the family, even if no one could prove it. But it still didn't stop Steve's cock from twitching when he looked at him, splayed out on that lounger, like he was without a care in the world.
"Right. How silly of me." He stood and stretched, shivering a little at the loss of Steve's warmth. "I'm gonna grab a sweater before we go."
"Tony, if I were writing this scene, I'd pick you up and take you bed and show you just how much I love you, regardless of your flaws. Because we're still human, and we're going to have flaws. And that doesn't mean one person is better than another. It just means we're different. And I really like that."
"What did you tell him?" She took a drink of her own coffee, appreciating how Clint always seemed to get the creamer to sugar ratio just right for her.
Tony looked away first. Starting down at his shoes, his arms crossed protectively over his chest. "Don't...just don't, Mr. Stark."
It was her own secret escape. The ability for just a short time to be normal. She wondered at how many pictures of herself ended up on Facebook, or if anyone ever wondered what happened to the pretty redhead they had spent the morning with.
Pepper leaned back in her chair, ignoring the impromptu photoshoot (it happened constantly with Tony around, anyway) and swinging around so she could see Steve. "Maybe. I like that. Thor, you want to try it?"
It's hard to believe that he had died just hours before, and Tony fears that everything he had seen was, in fact, a fever dream caused by his crash. But his chest is still whole. It's confirmation enough.
"Yeah, bruised but good." As the rest of the suit disappeared around him, Bruce fell into place next to Rhodey, walking toward the door. "A lot has happened since you've been here last."
"Thor is off planet, and Bruce is getting back later, what do we want for nosh?" Clint asked, removing his coat and tossing it onto the armchair.
They held still when Steve was buried to his hilt, his forehead resting against Tony's, their eyes locking. Gently, he kissed him to say thank you. To convey every emotion he was currently feeling. The heat around him was immeasurable. It was hard to stay still, to give Tony the time needed to unclench himself.
Bruce had told him what had happened that morning. The furious blinking away of tears, the anger, and the compassion he showed in bringing a meal to Howard.
"Hmm?" Steve answered, pressing his lips against Tony's head and inhaling the scent of his own shampoo in Tony's curls. "Right about what?"
Pulling out, he stood, finally kicking off his pants and pulling his shirt over his head without unbuttoning it. Tony's feet thumped to the ground, his hands flying to touch Steve's chest as soon as it was exposed. "This is what you were hiding under there?" His fingers curled inward as he tested how hard the muscles were underneath. He ran his hands up and over Steve's pectorals, the pads skidding over his nipples. Steve sucked in a breath, a short moan puffing from his throat. "You like that?"
what the younger demographic want. As Tones said before, they want hip-hop beats and songs about getting
"Okay, we need a plan. Jesus, this place is big." Natasha frowned. "Clint. Meat department. Lean meats mostly, some beef only because Tony will slaughter us if we deny him cow. Grass fed, all that garbage. Bruce, healthy snacks, breads, milk, and eggs. I know you know what to do. And I'll hit the produce. Meet at checkout in twenty." Because of course she approached it like a mission.
Tony looked down, unable to fathom any world where Steve Rogers wasn't worthy of something. "How long have you known?"
Turning his head, Steve nipped at the sensitive skin of Tony's inner thigh, scissoring his fingers just enough to make Tony burn, just slightly, testing how he liked it. The answering moan told him everything he needed to know. A little pain went a long way.
Tony backed away from him, "I don't know you. I don't know this man!" He called out, laughing again. He made it about twenty feet from Steve before taking off in the direction of the park, "Race ya!"
Steve took it as a personal challenge. Not to prove something that wasn't scientific fact, but to fuck Tony so well that he couldn't discern one from the other. Dropping to his knees in front of the chair, Steve ran his hands up Tony's thick thighs to the button and zipper, making quick work of undoing them. "Lift," he instructed, using the voice he preferred when handling a particularly difficult patient. Tony didn't hesitate. He raised his hips, letting Steve tug off his pants and boxers in one go.
"Yeah, yeah, go ahead," Tony said, standing to use the bathroom and almost walking into the door as he opened the page in his phone's browser.
Bruce chuckled lightly, "I wouldn't say aloof. But they have major trust issues-" he walked over to the dining room table, pushing several contracts around and plucking one from the pile.
He chuckled, "Don't we all?" Picking up a folder from the pile on his desk, Fury paused. "I'd like to see you stick with an act for more than a year."
"Keep that on your face." Tony pulled his legs underneath himself and leaned his right elbow on the back of the couch, a mild headache forming behind his eyes. "I had a bad childhood."
"Tony, Barton called me in." Rhodey felt his stomach twisting with every word Tony had said. He was babbling, and didn't that just say it all? Tony could babble with the best of them, but there was usually a point. This was sheer deflection.
For all his bravado, his money, his genius...all his bad jokes and sarcasm...He was just a damaged man, trying to make a difference.
He clamored to his knees, bringing one up to ready himself to stand when a hand shot it to help him. It was Howard, because of course it was, and Tony couldn't find a reason to ignore it that wouldn't make the situation worse.
Nodding, Natasha agreed. "Tony's wallet can handle it, but I'd like to not have to deal with a ticked off public." She spoke about him like he wasn't even there, and technically, he was not. The moaning man bent off of Steve's lap was just a pretty little whore.
"That's fair." He shrugged and made his way over to the coffee pot. And froze. "Something's different." He heard snickering behind him. "What did you do?"
She shook her head, even if she knew he couldn't see it, "No, I will. Steve and I need to have a real discussion about both of our behaviors."
written in bold over it. It was an Etsy buy, something Rhodey got him as a joke the Christmas before, but Tony adored it.
She was in his closet, pulling out a suit. "No time to shower. Fix your hair, spray something on yourself, and let's go! Happy is waiting."
"Thanks for pointing that out, you're such a good friend." Tony mumbled, elbowing Clint lightly. He turned to a waitress, "Hey! You mind taking a picture of us? Please and thank you!"
"I didn't expect this," he confessed, "I expected to find you and, I don't know, I guess have a happy reunion?"
Clint started to nod and froze, groaning and grabbing his head. "I take that back. Vodka. Vodka is definitely the devil."
"Come for me, angel." Letting go of one of Tony's hands, Steve wrapped it around Tony, stroking in time with their movements. "Come on, love. Let go."
"I can still hear you." Tony tries to cross his arms over his chest, but the pain flares, and he drops his hands to the bed. "I maintain it wasn't my fault." The back of his hand itches where they moved the IV when he accidentally pulled the other one from the crook of his elbow. ‘Accidentally’ being the operative word there.
"Okay, I lied. There are some things that still surprise me." Stepping into their personal space, Rhodey lowered his voice, "Are you telling me that Howard Stark, the bastard that
Howard threw his hands up placatingly, "I concede. It's fine. Just, enough with the hostile takeover, all right?"
Steve couldn't say no. He pushed a second finger in, spreading them, feeling along the velvety walls inside of Tony; he was so tight. His other hand went to Tony's dick, a first for him as he pulled it slowly. Through it all, the hardness hadn't waned. Tony wanted this. He wanted this badly.
Tony screamed, his back arching as Steve began sucking at his hole, the feeling too much coupled with the attention his cock was finally getting. His eyes rolled back as he came, hands slamming to the floor, and his dick erupting like a volcano, come spewing up and hitting his face, his chest, his chin. "Fuck me!" He yelled, his voice hoarse from the intensity of his screams. Steve was relentless, refusing to stop, letting the overstimulation send bolts through Tony. He was shaking so hard by the time Steve pulled away with come dripping down his chin that his spent cock swayed. He let Tony's knees down softly, and pulled him up to kiss him, pushing his tongue to slide into his mouth to suck on Tony's.
"Yes!" Finally something they could agree on, "I've spoken with KTU about doing KTUphoria again; they're stoked to have you. Your fans help sell the place out."
Steve's eyes widened. "I did. I guess I was, I don't know, it was too much to hope for: that it was me. And not just some character."
Tony moaned as he pushed the dildo into his ass. Stopping just after his rim like Steve did in the story, and then gradually going deeper until he couldn't push any further without losing the toy inside himself. When he drew it back out, the tip rubbed against his prostate, making him throw his head back and moan again.
"We can try for civil," Natasha said, taking the menus from Clint's outstretched hand, "but no promises for Steve and Tony. Bruce too, but he's more Zen than us in general."
"That was crude, even for you," Natasha laughed, entertained regardless of the maturity of the humor. Even if no one else appreciated Clint's mouth, she sure as hell did.
While Tony bathed, Rhodey dug through his dressers, plucking out a Slayer t-shirt and a pair of well worn jeans. They were past the point of modesty with each other, so he didn't even think twice about going through his underwear drawer as well. By the time Tony emerged from the bathroom, Rhodey had the clothes laid out on the bed and was rifling through Tony's closet for a hoodie that
The man who entered was tall, dark skinned, and handsome, and had an eye patch. Howard wasn't expecting that last part. Nor was he expecting the man's jaw to drop and a loud exclamation to cut through the terse silence on the room.
"Right." It seemed better to just agree with her. He liked living, after all, no matter where in time he was. "Where's Steve?"
The words were starting to catch up with Howard. "Him?" he asked, his eyebrows furrowed as he worked through the conversation like a particularly complicated puzzle.
"And here I was thinking Tony would be the one to fuck up the relationship." She punched his arm, and he squeaked. "Ow! Must you always resort to violence?"
His keys clanged when they hit the metal bowl just inside his door. He dropped his wallet on top and toed off his sneakers, letting out an exhausted sigh. Natasha was relentless. She meant well, but sometimes she was just too much.
He called Pepper because she could organize. She could help keep Tony focused. But Rhodey could help Tony stand back up.
Walking from the closet and tossing the sweater on the bed, Rhodey leveled him with a bright grin. "Was it brown and grimy?"
"Tashy, I appreciate what you're trying to accomplish. I do! But Steven Rogers could never love a guy like me. He's all virtuous and honorable. And I'm..."
for his best friend. No way in hell. He was certain that Tony was on a path that could only lead to him getting his heart broken. But the months wore on, and they grew stronger together as a couple, and Rhodey found himself starting to like the Star Spangled Man. He brought out the best in Tony and guided him through his worst. He was there for him, loved him unconditionally, and, honestly, was one of the best drinking buddies Rhodey ever had. He could pound them back and never get sloppy. It was nice to have a second set of hands to get Tony to bed after a night spent binge drinking like they were still in college.
"Can you take the corn back to the table and keep Tony from getting his grubby hands on them before the meat's done?"
"I know you do. But this is obviously upsetting you." She tried to catch his eyes, but he looked away.
He found an easy camaraderie with him as well. They had a similar goal, the same interest. They both loved Tony fiercely, and on the occasions Bruce and Rhodey were alone together, the genius was often the topic of discussion. Rhodey doubted he'd be friends with Bruce otherwise, but he did genuinely like the man. Despite the whole Hulk thing. But if Tony trusted him, then Rhodey trusted him.
He felt off-kilter, like he was on a merry-go-round and no one was at the controls. Spinning faster and faster, unable to keep his eyes on a stable landmark long enough to not feel sick. It was dizzying. Frightening. All the insanity but none of the fun or music.
It wasn't hard to see how Thor was looking at Tony, worry creasing his usually jovial eyes. Natasha looked at the god surreptitiously and shook her head. "Later," she mouthed. Thor nodded and looked back at Tony.
It's slower the next time. A gentle pull from the abyss. He feels himself ascending and opens his eyes to a world fuzzy around the edges. This time it's Natasha bent over him. She cups his cheek, smiling softly, but somehow it's
When the fictional Steve licked, Tony pulled from his ass and rubbed, massaging his opening, and when he sucked, well, Tony couldn't mimic that with his hand, instead he let his finger dip all the way inside and stroked his prostate.
"Forgive me, sir, but you did program me to always carry your best interests to heart. Pardon the phasing."
Tony's head fell back, his eyes closing as he let out a low moan that sent a jolt of arousal through Steve's body. They rocked, frotting against one another, building in speed and intensity. It was so hard to stop, to cease the friction that was bringing them so close, despite it being through their jeans. It felt so good to have Steve pressed along his body, covering him. And Tony gripped tighter, letting his legs fall to the side to give Steve better access. His breath was coming in pants, his body tight with the impending orgasm, but Steve had more self-control than anyone gave him credit for.
Steve was stunned still. He nodded, once, and watched with wide eyes as Tony pulled the computer onto his own lap. "I want to see what you're working on now." Tony spoke softly, running his fingers over the keyboard. The same keys that helped write the stories that had started the whole thing; he imagined them warm with Steve's touch, the muted clicking sound they made as he typed away about all the things he wanted to do to Tony. It sent a shiver up his spine.
He had been Tony's optometrist for going on three years, had lusted after him for just as long, and although Tony was a genius, he really could be as thick as his glasses. Steve had dropped plenty of hints. It wasn't like he didn't think Tony was interested. On the contrary, Steve's perfect vision saw every appreciative look Tony sent towards him. Every leer, every wistful smile…
"So what? You made a stupid choice. No reason to live the rest of your life under it. It happened. It's over." When Howard moved to walk away, Tony caught his arm. "I get to meet the real you now. And that-- that feels good. It feels right. So, cut the shit. You want to make up for what happened, well-" He spread his arms, indicating not only him but the tower, Steve, the other Avengers… "-Here's your chance."
"That can be arranged." Reluctantly, he let go, stepping back to rifle through one of the drawers in the examination room, plucking out a bottle of lube. "Lucky for you, I came prepared for today."
Tony flopped into the chair, twisting the bottle in his hands. "I'm fine, Pep. You know I'm a big boy now? I wipe my own ass and everything."
A thoughtful look washes over Coulson's face. His eyes are twinkling just a little, and Tony knows the answer before he even says it. "You. You were one of my charges."
Dropping his weight on her hands, he laughed as she grunted and shoved him forward. He stumbled, still chuckling, and moved to the kitchen. "What do you want? Soup? Stew? Chicken?"
Clint was quiet, his good mood gone when he thought about Tony. "Something's gotta give, man. Even the media is noticing. They're saying he has an eating disorder."
Steve's fingers ran the length of Tony's arms and down his wrists, clasping his hands on either side of his head, and he slowly pulled out, moaning at the feeling. "Tony," he gasped, and pushed back in.
Tony's eyes grew wide with anticipation, his hips rocking harder. "Fuck, yes. I want to come on your dick," he repeated.
Natasha was babysitting Howard, and Steve and Bruce were distracting Tony, so that left him. And if he were honest with himself, there was a little monster of guilt doing a jig in his stomach. He needed to do

and schedule manicures. She'd even traverse Fifth Avenue with Natasha, shopping and chatting, but Happy was always waiting with the car, and Pepper was certainly not the type to dive naked into the Atlantic Ocean.
Throwing her head back in a sigh, Natasha groaned. "God, you're clueless. Anyway," she hurried on, "I take it you liked the next installment?"
Tony squirmed a little, adjusting. "I really am beat. Movie and then bed? Or movie, then the sex you promised, and
Steve bent Tony's neck forward to kiss his head. It was so gentle, so loving, so much of everything Tony didn't even know he needed. "I know. I want to know it all, Tony. The good and the bad."
Clint made a face, shooting it at Steve and slipping out to get Thor. Steve understood. When it came to Tony and his own self care, Steve was the only one who could get him to eat or sleep or even to shower when Tony was focused on work. He was a musical genius, able to play almost any instrument he picked up, lyrics and notes coming easily to him, and he had perfect pitch. That coupled with an incredible voice and his looks made him perfect as a pop star, an absolute dream for producers to work with. But it also meant he got into zones; habitual behaviors that took up all the space in his brain and pushed other things out, things he deemed unnecessary like eating or sleeping or bathing. He would fall into his genius, letting the music consume him, and if they didn't dive into his mind and pull him out, he would go days without any of it.
Steve caught up to him, grabbing the back of his shirt and yanking him backwards, almost sending Tony careening to the sidewalk. The genius yelped, clinging to the first thing he could, which was Steve's arm, and trying to steady himself. Steve pushed him back upright.
a little afraid of Pepper, but then again, so was everyone. It took certain strength to deal with Tony as long as she had. "He's telling the truth. We honestly don't know."
"S'okay," Tony mumbled, curling into Steve as he slipped under the covers, and shivered lightly. "It's cold," he grumbled, and pressed his forehead into Steve's warm, pink chest.
Tony tried to conceal it, and most of the time he did it well. Until he became overwhelmed, until the seams in the walls he built around himself started to leak, faster and faster, and he could no longer keep his head above water.
All three of those hated things are what he's dealing with at the moment, and he shifts uncomfortably on the hospital bed.
Steve adjusted himself on the couch behind the mixing board, "Think we should add a bass line in there, Pepper?"
"Mm," he kissed Tony's forehead. "I won't then." When his stomach made a loud, grumbling noise, he laughed, "And I'll get right on that."
It was one of those grey days where the mist hung in the air like a sheer curtain. Dark and gloomy, cold and damp; like how you feel at the peak of fever, all chilled and uncomfortable.
As the coffee dripped its last droplets into the carafe, Rhodey closed his eyes. Life had given Tony brilliance and money, good looks and courage, and in exchange had pummeled him with one upheaval after another.
it's like the entire world shifts. He didn't believe it, but standing there as Tony entered the guest room, something swelled up inside of Howard.
Thor made himself comfortable on the bed after they entered, sitting with his back against the wall and legs out in front of him, hoping his body language displayed a friendliness that would put Howard at ease. He would get nowhere with him on the defensive.
Steve gripped his waist, lifting Tony off and on his cock, his hips rocking up into the thrusts as Tony wailed and whimpered with each pulse in and out. He could feel Tony's body trembling, his orgasm nearer and nearer with every hit against his prostate.
Steve doesn't respond at first. Instead, he takes a long drink from the bottle, his Adam's apple bobbing in a way that momentarily distracts Tony. When he answers, it's with a raw quality in his tone that speaks more about his emotional state than it does about his exhaustion. "I keep going over everything in my head about… Well. Each mission, honestly, but mostly about that one in Rochester."
"It takes a bit of training to learn how to put them away," Michael adds. "But your shell looks good; the wings are an easy add-on."
Clint fared pretty well himself, given that he only had to procure meat, and honestly, he was an expert. He got the usuals, chicken quarters, pork chops, and steaks, also grabbing some sausages, chopped meat, and a whole chicken. He was damn proud of himself. He had even thought to stop at the deli counter and grab some cold cuts. As he wheeled his cart back to the registers, he saw Bruce wasn't having as much luck.
"Oh, look, our stop!" Tony interrupted, tugging Steve's shirt sleeve, "We have to go! Sorry! Thank you! Bye!" And he pulled them out of the train car and onto the platform, waving sheepishly as the doors closed. God, he was so awkward at times, especially after becoming Iron Man. Show your heart to the public and the facade just breaks the fuck down, doesn't it? "Let's go see some lines painted on canvas."
"They do, you're still their brother," Steve continued, looking up at him. "They just want to know you're here to stay."
Tony was about to answer when Steve crooked his fingers up and his back arched, a loud moan spilling out of him.
"Actually," another voice speaks up, "I am the one asking." Tony's head snaps to the side; he didn't even hear the door open, though, he supposes, angels may not actually need doors.
Which was working. Tony's face went red, his hands clutching his stomach, and fell against the counter, gasping for breath and laughing so hard he started coughing. "App-Appetizer!"
"Why'd you move?" Natasha asked, and Tony found it funny that she didn't say "Why did you get up?" Not funny in the 'haha' way, but funny in the 'what the actual fuck' way.
Rhodey adjusted on the couch and rubbed soothing circles on his back. "I hate this." His voice was quiet and agitated, and Steve knew he wasn't just referring to the situation, but of Tony feeling so off that he was easily accepting blatant comfort in view of other people. Sure, it was Steve and Rhodey and they saw sides to Tony no one else did, but when it came down to it, the genius didn't like to have an audience. That he was so readily accepting of it, that he was so distraught to begin with…
Grabbing Rhodey's arm, Tony tugged him down to plant a big, fat, obnoxious kiss on his cheek. "You are filet mignon to me, Rhodey-Bear!"
"Something went down with him that we've retrieved, but we're hoping there's more information on it with Rogers," Fury states, leaning forward, "but also, don't forget—The man was a national hero. He deserves to be found, and he deserves to be laid to rest with honor."
When the elevator dinged, Howard straightened his back, stuck his chin out, and did what he could to raise his armor. No matter what, he would go down swinging. Proud.
"Oh good, give Tony more ammunition against me." He rubbed the side of his face, still chuckling as they exited the workshop. "If you team up with Nat and Clint, we're all gonna be in trouble," he mumbled to himself more than anything else.
"Mr. Stark," Rhodey said coolly. He was considering what Natasha had said, but it still didn't mean he had to be friendly with the guy.
Steve chuckled, "Of course, angel." He lapped over Tony's other nipple, grazing his teeth over it, his hands working deftly at the drawstring to Tony's pants. "I need to be in you,
Steve had been open about his relationship with a younger Howard: an intelligent, eccentric man who risked his life to save others. That it was also an adventure wasn't lost on either of them.
"What are you saying?" Rhodey spat out, "That we encourage some form of paternal bonding between them? For the love of- Agent Romanoff, that man beat his own kid, he ignored him to the point where Tony feels like he has no other choice than to be
"Excellent," Tony grins, "we just need a few things from the kitchen, and we'll be set to make the most awesome snowman that this city has ever seen. Why? Because I'm an engineer, that's why!" Some of it is false bravado, but it's enough to startle a laugh out of Steve.
Smiling softly, Yinsen hugs him again. "I wish only to be with my family, Tony. But you? You have so much more to give this world."
Steve nodded and sat back to use the lube on himself, tossing the bottle to the other side of the bed when he was done, and replacing his hand over the arc reactor. "I love you." And he slid in, completely.
Tony jolts. He's no longer in the beautiful clearing. He's in an office. Creamy beiges and deep mahogany accented with blues. "What?" The pain is gone. So is the blood. Tony looks down at himself to see he's dressed in his favorite t-shirt and lounge pants. He's also sitting in a plush high-back chair. In front of him is a large ornate desk, and seated behind it is a woman. She's dressed smartly, her hair pulled back in a neat bun.
Sure, he liked living with the team. It had given him a sense of camaraderie that he hadn't felt in a long time, but sometimes, it was just
"It's okay," Tony tries to comfort him; they all know this is the only way to keep the facade up that Tony didn't die, "I'll be fine."
Crossing his arms over his chest, Tony nodded. "Fine. But I get to eat as many cookies as I want." Lord knew how he did it, how he was able to push aside his frustration with the two of them and crack a joke like nothing had happened to begin with.
"You had years of hurt built up by how you were raised. Of course you wanted his approval and love." Sitting up from his supine position, he sat back on the arm of the couch, partially tucked into the corner of it for support, and pulled Tony on top of him. Tony settled his legs on either side of Steve's and lay against him, his head tucked under Steve's chin and his arms wrapped around his middle.
Steve's lips over his, his tongue dancing in his mouth, tasting all of him, and Tony, oh Tony. He felt the wetness on his cheeks and couldn't help but laugh again. Because he didn't think he had ever cried in happiness before this.
The apartment was pristine, as it always was. Tony's workshop was constantly a mess but his living quarters were immaculate. Despite having a cleaning crew, he still tidied up everyday. Still vacuumed himself, did his own dishes. He was a neat freak.
Laughter echoed behind them as they left the room and headed to the elevator, hands still clasped. Steve rounded on Tony as soon as they stepped foot inside, kissing him again. And as the doors closed, another voice spoke loudly into the darkness, "That's why her hair is so big." Other voices joined in. "It's full of secrets!"
And that worried Steve. It wasn't like Tony to just allow them to change what he ate. He meant it when he said he didn't control the genius. No one did. Tony did what he wanted, when he wanted, and where he wanted. To give in just like that? It made Steve think he was sicker than he let on.
Steve, pulling orange juice from the fridge, heaved an exaggerated sigh, "Guess it's just you and me, Brucie."
Together, they opened the doors and walked straight into a hustle of four nosy teammates, careening to find places to sit nonchalantly.
Or maybe one day they'd wake up and there'd be no trace of him. No memory of the exuberant little genius.
Afterwards, Tony took a nap, and Steve realized that even one of his favorite activities exhausted him to the point that he couldn't keep his eyes open. The man who used to go days without sleeping now spent most of his time doing exactly that.
Turning back to the fruit, he picked up the fork and speared a blueberry. So, this Tony guy was forty-three. Just about a year younger than he was now, but that meant nothing. Howard did the math in his head, he'd be 53 the year Tony was born. That was 1970, a full nine years into his own future. The age-gap was fairly large, how the hell would he have been able to come in contact with Tony enough to hurt him? Unless he was… Nope. He wasn't going there. That was impossible. But they did
Steve's body relaxed marginally. He wiped a hand down his face. "I was frozen. I was found. I was thawed out. Now you need to go home."
Tony paused as he opened the adjacent cabinet in search of his mug. Dinner? Alone with Steve? Yes please. "What do you have in mind?"
"I can't believe it was there all along," Clint said, looking annoyed. "Nat and I have been all over looking for it."
will figure out the cost and the choreo. At this point in the game, we've handled so much shit on our own, we don't
It wasn't always easy to keep himself away like that, especially given what they were currently going through. Steve and Rhodey didn't exactly hit it off at first, and sometimes he found it hard to let that go. But any healthy relationship needed space, and Rhodey deserved time with his best friend that didn't involve his significant other.
The thought of never seeing Tony again sent a pang of something through his heart. He couldn't be falling for him! He barely knew him! And anyway, two men couldn't be in a relationship together, it just ain't right.
Howard was in the living room, nursing a glass of amber liquid. He was sitting forward on the couch, his elbows braced on his knees, the glass between both hands, twisting back and forth, and his fingers playing along the condensation from the ice. A fantastic bruise had blossomed on his left cheek, illuminated by the morning sun streaming in from behind him.
She nodded to him and turned to Clint. "Agent Barton, a word, if you please." She gestured to the hallway and though confused, he followed her. She stopped outside his door, and he let her in, hastily swiping stray arrows from the love seat just inside the door.
"Is that even a question? I seem to remember in the last story this was the part where you threw me on the bed and fucked my brains out." Tony's eyes darkened, and he rocked his hips against Steve.
Face a little squished, Bruce hugged back as much as he could. "You too." Feet back on the floor, he turned to the table and gestured to the other seats. "Good thing you hugged me now, after you eat that garbage, you're not coming anywhere near me."
Tony turned so his back was to Clint's, "serious face!" Clint threw his head up and gave a pout, sliding his sunglasses down at the last moment. She handed the phone back, not a single glint of recognition on her face.
"This is getting out of hand. If he won't go to a doctor..." Natasha trailed off, glaring at Steve like it was his fault. They were in the kitchen, a safe distance away so they wouldn't be heard by the topic of their conversation.
"Just keep drinking, Howie. It'll solve all your problems." Tony felt nothing of the compassion he had felt that morning. His gut felt cinched. He was spent. Exhausted emotionally and physically and just not up to verbally sparring or showing any more care. It just took too much out of him.
The idea of starting a new life with a clean slate is a tantalizing thought, but as Yinsen had said, Tony has remaining work to do. He can start over again in fifty years; for now, he has to correct everything he has messed up in his life. He owes it to the soldiers he watched die. He owes it to Yinsen. It will be hard hiding what had actually transpired from Rhodey, Pepper, and Happy, and almost impossible to keep it from Obie, but Tony knows that sometimes the hardest decisions are worth it in the end. Regardless, he's lucky to have another chance to do right by them.
As for him - and Thor for that matter - they knew only what they could ascertain by spending time with Tony. Things he did, quirks he had. They told volumes. Thor had him in years, but Clint's studies as a spy were nothing to shake a stick at. He was nowhere near what Natasha was, but then again, he didn't go through what she had to in order to gain those skills.
Smiling at the obvious false bravado Howard was emitting, Thor placed Mjolnir beside him and responded, "I am Thor, son of Odin, from Asgard." He watched with amusement as those words settled over Howard's understanding like a sudden rain, his face going from guarded to open with confusion and a little bit of wonder. "I am also one of the Avengers, and proud to be so. I count them all as family, including Tony. So, it should not be a shock that I am disheartened and angered to hear that you disapprove of his leanings and his relationship."
"I do. Tony," Steve pulled back to look directly into Tony's face, "I just want you to be happy. Is that so much?"
Sliding to the edge of the bed, Steve stood up. "Don't deflect with humor, Tony." He held his hand out, and when Tony made a face at him, he took it upon himself to slip his fingers through Tony's and tug him toward the end of the mattress.
He knelt to the ground, moving the bags away enough that they wouldn't interfere with the shot. The boy unabashedly threw his arms around him.
Once he felt relaxed, Tony gave an experimental rock of his hips, a gasp left silent on his lips at the pleasure. Steve groaned, dropping his head as the tightness of the muscles contracted around him.
"You, my angel," Steve grinned, giving in just a little to taste Tony's lips again, "are a pest of epic proportions."
Shrugging, Steve looks over at him, "A little, but… but it shouldn't have been necessary. I know he was old, I know he had lived a good life, but he should have died at home, of natural causes, surrounded by his family, not scared and cowering as a piece of rebar careened toward him faster than he could react."
Throwing her feet up onto the couch, she waited to hear the jovial voice of her one friend who refused to carry a cellphone when he was on earth. Something about electrical currents - even if he handled game controllers and tablets just fine. He was so full of shit.
"They're getting there, Thor," Steve comforted softly. "They've always been, uh, more aloof?" He looked to Bruce to see if he was wording it right.
. According to the Emergency Medicine doctor, he has four fractured ribs, a broken metatarsal, a fractured wrist, two broken fingers, and a dislocated shoulder. That amongst the multiple contusions, the bruises, the scrapes… It's a fucking mess all around.
still need you." He dropped the folder in front of her, but she didn't reach out to take it. "These guys," he tapped the file, "are stubborn as fuck."
Nodding, Tony took the letter, glancing at the header with the date and then down at Howard's signature. He looked like he didn't recognize it, as if everything about Howard was a mystery to him. And - Steve supposed - everything was.
The left side of Rhodey's mouth lifted sadly. "I'm sorry, Tone, you can give me the Bambi eyes all you want, but I'm not letting you go back to sleep." Slipping his hands under Tony's armpits, he carefully pulled him up and into a sitting position. "The Tony Stark I know doesn't just roll over and die." Tony let himself be moved, his eyes dropping down to the blankets, unable to look up at his best friend. Rhodey wasn't having that. With two fingers, he tapped under Tony's chin, gently cajoling him to lift his head. "I have coffee." It wasn't much, but it did perk him up just a bit. "But you have to try eating first."
"It's not linear," Fury continued, "Time, that is." At their confused looks, he shrugged and sat back, explaining, "Howard cast a spell that sent him to the future. It split him in two. The other Howard stayed behind and lived out his life. While the new Howard-" he gestured to the Howard seated next to him, "moved forward in time."
Reaching blindly, he grabbed his doctor's coat and balled it up, shoving it under Tony's hips and pressing at the small of Tony's back so his legs splayed and his front fell onto the coat, propping him up enough to be comfortable. He shifted into a position that would have him punching into Tony's prostate from that angle and attached his lips over the bite mark from before,
Steve wasn't exactly sure that was a good idea, but Tony picked up the tablet and beckoned Howard over to him. "Crash course on this."
Rocking his head side to side, weighing how to answer, Steve crossed his arms. "No one I wish to discuss with you, but I can say that this person is the absolute love of my life. Knock next time.
Tony walked slow, tip-toeing past his team mates’ doors, hoping he wasn't about to wake everyone up with a screaming match. It was what he had feared when he was sixteen, the exact reason he never said a word. Howard's face twisted in fury, the yelling, the belittling, the belt.
"What else could there be?" Howard regretted the words as soon as they left his mouth, but there was nothing to say to make it better; he couldn't unsay them. Stepping fully into the kitchen, he attempted to close the distance between them, but Tony's tensing form stopped him.
"Talk to him," Bruce spoke up softly, looking up at Thor and back to Steve. "You know Tony. Better than any of us. He doesn't want this."
"I asked you a question, slut." He timed his smacks with jabs against Tony's prostate, looking hungrily down as the naked body before him. Steve's own cock was hard in his pants, but he'd have time for that later. When Tony was exhausted and spent and he would use Tony's body for his own pleasure, fucking him and filling him until the come was forced out like frothy milk.
He gave a short laugh, "Fair enough. That you over there?" He gestured with his chin toward the photograph he had studied earlier.
Steve gasped, feeling the tightening around his cock. His hands jumped from hips to waist, thumb and fingers splayed across the svelte expanse. He could feel Tony quivering under his fingertips, shaking from the post-orgasmic high and the continued pleasure as Steve kept thrusting, still catching his prostate on every pass.
Tony's arms shot out, flinging around Steve's shoulders as he hung on. "More," he begged, shifting forward and opening himself up impossibly wide.
"I want to make it up to Tony. And to Steve." Howard looked down at his cup. "Mostly Tony." His eyes closed briefly, and when they opened, they were fierce and determined. "He's my son, and I failed him. Time and time again. Past, present, and future. At least for me, since I've yet to live out what I will do to Tony. If there's one thing this misadventure can bring, it'll hopefully be a little peace to his life."
From the doorway to the hallway, Steve spoke again, the hint of a devilish smile on his lips. "Don't go poking through any drawers in the living room or bedroom. You may not like what you find."
Thor winced, "That is too close to home." No one commented on him calling the tower his home, there was no time, but it warmed Steve's heart, if only a little. No matter what,
"No," Steve sighed deeply, exhausted and not from being woken up, "not for any of us. Thor might know, but I'm not exactly sure this is any magic he'd be familiar with."
so that when he did go back, he could be better. Do better. Give Tony the childhood he deserved and make sure that Tony, Steve - and the rest of the Avengers as well - were nowhere near New York when the shit hit the fan. At the very least, he could devise a way for them to win without the Iron Man armor, if his being a better father really did keep Tony from making it. See? It was foolproof! He just needed to hammer out a few minor details. Inconsequential, really.
People passed, some with curious looks, but most walked by as if Tony and Clint meant nothing to them. Years ago, that would have been not only impossible, but Tony and Clint may have even been a little offended. They
It took a few tries before he figured it out, but by tapping the white circle at the bottom, he could take a photo of himself
"That is what I wanted to hear. The rest we can work on." Standing, Thor offered Howard his hand. "Come, I am hungry and hate to speak of such matters on an empty stomach! I have brought mead from Asgard, and candied fruit! And I would like to order several pizzas." Howard took his hand and allowed himself to be led back into the living room. "Tell me, Howard Stark, do you enjoy pineapple on pizza?"
"I need to ask you something," Steve began, taking the plunge. "Tony isn't traditional, and I know it's considered out of date these days, but I'm a relic, and I'm proud."
But it was also Howard's. Because one day Howard would turn, and he would beat and belittle his own son into a damaged shadow, always hurting, constantly hiding. He would be the reason for the self-destructive behavior. The self-sabotaging actions that made up most of Tony's life.
"Last thing I remember, I was in the quinjet, Steven. How did I get into bed?" Standing, Tony stretched languidly, reaching up to the ceiling and flexing his fingers.
. Because even the tiniest chance of Tony gaining some semblance of a stable mental state was worth the risk. And they were going to take it.
Steve's head whipped over to see Howard, who was thankfully so engrossed in the television he hadn't even noticed Steve's entrance. "That's not funny, Nat."
"Which is fantastic," Steve shot back, "except we also don't know how to get him home, if you didn't hear me the first time."
"See," he argued, "both you and Steve seem to think I wield some great power to completely alter your world."
Kirby's Market and Delicatessen sat facing the tower on the adjacent street. Bruce caught sight of the fresh flowers the owner stacked outside the door as he waited for the signal to switch to
But Tony answered with no problem. He knew their language, even if he couldn't speak it back. "Steve. I fell in love with Steve." Dum-E spun around, his arm popping up and down. "I'm sorry, I didn't mean to keep it a secret. I was just afraid of saying it out loud." The gentle nudge to his thigh had Tony smiling openly. His robots, essentially his children, were often the only things he could speak honestly around. That had started to change, with the formation of the team, but he still was the most transparent when it came to his creations.
Cradling the tall glass in his hand, Tony dutifully took a few gulps, but each one looked forced. He glanced up at Steve to see if he approved of the amount, and Steve begrudgingly nodded, taking the cup from his hands.
"I know better than them all. You're all stupid boys." She smirked. "And I'm not." Like that answered
Tony finds Steve nursing a beer at the kitchen Island. It's just after 4 in the morning, and outside, a winter storm drapes Manhattan in glittery white snow, topping streetlights, idle taxis, and the occasional brave soul who stomps their way over the yet unplowed sidewalks. The sky is a bright orange, illuminated by a serene beauty that only comes after a good snowstorm. But it's cold. Bitter. The air tastes frozen and harsh, and despite the sparkly grace of the snowflakes dancing through the chilled air, it's better viewed from inside the warmth of a home. Still, there's a quaintness that draws people to it. The feel of the fluffy white mounds of snow, the sharp burst of cold on tongues as someone catches a snowflake… It speaks of something simpler and good.
Stepping toward Steve as they finished -- Rhodey a forgotten figure behind him -- Tony took Steve's hand. "Frost was right about some things in that poem, you know. I'm an engineer, I don't really have much to say about literature and its analysis, but I can say this: The leaves lost their color in autumn, right? And they die in winter? He says nothing good can stay-'' Moving closer, Tony lifted his hand and cupped Steve's cheek. He felt warm and soft. Like home. Steve felt the tightness in his chest loosen, just a little. "
Fury acquiesced. "The way the split works is that the second person -- the second Howard -- had to travel. We all know it's easier to travel light, right?" He waited until they each gave him a look of understanding before he continued. "It's the same with emotions. It's easier to travel light. They're not weighted like we understand it. It's a metaphorical sense, but just as important. Emotions like happiness, love, contentment… They're lighter. Easier to move. So the second Howard, he needed to be lighter, could only carry what he could, and the-" He fought for a word, tilting his head back and forth,
"But Steve's not straight," she countered, wiggling the phone in her hand, "this proves it. It's so obviously him."
, that much was abundantly clear. It would do no good, regardless. Tony had been right. Howard had to be told, it was the best way to take control of the situation.
From the sky, a long, bright bolt of lightning jolted to the dragon's back feet, causing it to stumble and jump. Another hit its head, and when the massive jaws opened in pain, the quinjet fired. As the dragon fell - dead - to the street, the man on his back jumped, riding the scaly neck to the ground.
She nodded, jotting everything down in his chart. "I'm sorry to hear all this, we'll do what we can to make you feel better." Standing, she smiled warmly, "Just a few more minutes." And left.
She directed herself toward Howard. "The book you used, that very spell-" She moved her eyes over to Tony briefly, gauging him before flicking back to Howard and staring, obviously annoyed, upset, and at a loss before continuing, "-has only been used once before. At least to my knowledge. What I know of it is simple: You come to the future, and you stay there. There is no return trip. Mr. Stark. To be blunt, you will not be going home. The man who we know of that used the exact spell you did is still here as well. He is living in San Francisco. Currently. In this time. And he will die in this time as well."
"One in the same." In a rare moment of physical comfort, Natasha put her hand on Steve's arm. "He's going to be okay, you know that, right? He's too stubborn to not be."
Tony's eyes were suspiciously moist. He blinked several times and held back a sniffle. "I love you too."
For all his bravado, Tony really hated being leered at, and in public there was no shortage of that. It seemed worse on the train, both men and women, all with greedy eyes, either knowing who he was or not. But it felt gross. At least with Steve by his side he felt safer.
Sometimes, he honestly felt like he wasn't the same. That he wasn't Tony Stark. He was an illness. And that was it. Gone was the inventor, the genius. Gone was the Iron Man suit, the playboy persona, the jokes, the wit. Like his whole person and history was completely rewritten from scratch, starting the first time he threw up.
"Was that Tony?" he queried, gesturing toward the hallway the other man had disappeared down. Steve nodded but didn't give any more information, so Howard repeated his earlier question, "Aren't you happy to see me?"
Bruce nodded, confidence in the situation growing within him. Perhaps he wasn't too late in speaking with Howard; perhaps it had happened at just the right time. "That, right there, is what I wanted to hear." In his mind, the Other Guy tilted his head, intrigued.
Sometimes, as Nat walked the streets of New York City, she reveled in the idea that she could just get lost there. It was a tantalizing thought. With a few well placed steps, she'd disappear into the crowd and no one would be the wiser. On either side of her as they jogged across E 42nd St, Clint and Maria Hill were lost to their own thoughts. Even as experienced as they were, they wouldn't be able to find her if she chose to disappear.
There was a silence. It spread from person to person and Tony shifted uncomfortably on his heels. Every pair of eyes was trained on him. "Okay! So, processed pork. Bring it on."
Steve and Tony had gone mostly dark, not answering text messages or calls. It bothered Bruce, but he understood the need to vanish probably more than anyone else they knew. He could give them a few days, and if he still heard nothing, he'd ask JARVIS to contact them. First, he had to talk to Howard. It was long overdue, and although that had his anxiety on edge, Bruce metaphorically squared his shoulders as he put away the groceries in his little apartment. He would make some tea and invite Howard over. With any luck, he wouldn't have to call Pepper to get the construction workers back up to the Avengers floors. Again.
These days, the baby faces had matured into handsome men, they didn't often make the front cover, and they were okay with that. Even experiences like this, where fans stopped them on the street, were rare.
"Then trust us as well." Steve said, pulling Tony's body against his, "trust this." He put one hand over his own heart, and the other over Tony's.
He felt the tears fall down his face, his relief spilling out of him, and he felt the arms of Natasha wrap around him.
The emotions were too much. To finally have an answer, and not just any answer, but one that didn't include dying of cancer or
"Uh-huh. With Natalie Portman." Closing the book, she turns fully toward him. "Where is what, Tony?"
"Doubtful, but I'll give you this one. For the record, you're absolutely right. But," Michael taps his chin, "we'll have to send him back to the desert. And he'll need to be believably injured. I know Colonel Rhodes is searching for him."
He blinks, and she's gone. The room is empty, the light across the floor shifted to the other side. The fuzziness is gone, and the room around him is pulled into sharp focus. He swallows, his tongue dry and swollen in his mouth.
, a suspense thriller that everyone enjoyed. Tony had taken up his usual corner on the couch, and though normally Steve would have either bodily moved Tony so he could sit behind him and pull Tony to lay on top or sit next to him to swing an arm around his shoulders, he instead took the other corner. Tony gave him a wounded look but nodded in acceptance. They could play off the close friends just fine, but outright cuddling would be too obvious.
She laughed at that, loudly and fully, her whole body shaking, and her eyes tearing. Tony loved when she let herself go enough to really laugh. It softened the hard lines on her face and made her eyes go bright with her joy. Happy was a good look on her, and he promised he'd find a way to make the look permanent.
Grinding down against him, Steve pulled Tony's bottom lip into his mouth, sucking gently. They made no move to strip, though their hands wandered, up each other's shirts and down the curves of their bodies, so lost in each other that they forgot about the movie and everything else.
But she's already shoved him into the hallway and slammed the door. When he turns around to re-enter and demand to know what's going on, the door is gone, leaving only a smooth, white wall. He has no choice but to follow her directions.
Tony is holding his breath, waiting for the other shoe to drop. But it doesn't. Steve braces his left arm in front of Tony and leans in further, kissing his forehead. "I lost her. I don't want to lose you. I want to spend the rest of my life with you, Tony.” A beat passes before Steve murmurs, his voice like a prayer, “I think I had to lose her to get to you."
"From what I hear, Miss Potts, there is no one more formidable than you. If Tony trusts you, then I do as well."
songs being played on the radio, despite what they had told Natasha. Those days were definitely over. Though, if their new manager had anything to say about it, they were coming again.
"Don't what?" Howard asked, the smile slipping from his face. What was last night then, if Tony still disliked him?
The craziest part wasn't a stranger offering help. Since Natasha had willingly started allowing herself to live a normal life, which included actual social interaction, she had learned that there were all sorts of good and helpful people out there. No, the craziest part was that she had no look of recognition on her face.
He was actually giggling, snapping goofy photos of himself and feeling like a kid again, when movement by the door to the hallway caught his eye.
His grip of Tony's hair lessened, afraid that he might have hurt him, but Tony just nuzzled his hip. "I like that. Do it. Pull my hair, Steve."
"Is this guy for real?" Clint said at the same time as Tony yelled through his own com, "Cap, get out of there!" There was panic in his voice.
"What bet?" Steve sighed, not understanding the joke and tugging the sock on the rest of the way. Letting his feet rest on the floor, his hands dangling over his knees, he shook his head, dismissing the thought. Natasha and the others, particularly with Clint, had some weird jokes. Bets on what Steve would or wouldn't do notwithstanding. "I don't know," he said honestly instead, moving the topic back to where it belonged, "you know Tony. He doesn't like to show his hand."
Steve batted his hand away, and finally, finally! lowered the pants. He stepped out of them with grace and Tony huffed at yet another thing Steve was flawless at. He'd show him! If he had to learn to pole dance, he'd do it! Just to upstage Steve at his own game. Because the strip tease he was receiving had Tony so hard he was almost aching. He wanted so badly to touch himself but refused. After all the stories, he at last had the real thing. He wasn't going to waste it with a quick handy.
Tony knocked on the glass, waving idiotically when Bruce lifted his head to see who was at the door. He plastered on his best media smile and entered when Bruce gestured him inside. "Brucie Bear!"
"Not that I know from personal experience, but you are a rather detailed storyteller." Standing, Bruce motioned to the mini-fridge in the corner. "Thirsty?"
He had stayed gluten free completely since the week prior, and the change was noticeable. He was still underweight, but color had returned a little to his cheeks, though if he was anemic, the paleness had ways to go. But his energy was amped up a bit more. It felt good to do things, even if he didn't leave the tower. He read a lot, but he also tinkered a bit, finally able to concentrate for more than a few minutes at a time. And of course, the extracurricular activities with Steve were better than they had been in a long time.
JARVIS answered her, his tone a little snippy from being unable to do so before. "I have alerted Sir and the Captain. As for Dr. Banner and Thor, they are in the latter's rooms. I shall send along a message to come out."
"Oh my god." Awe. That's what it was. Awe at how reactive Tony was, how sensitive that spot inside him turned out to be.
