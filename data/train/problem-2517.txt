"Good.  I want to see you back in two weeks, but you can call if you have any issues or concerns.  We still have some time.  Anything you want to talk about?"
Sam laughed and Dean groaned as the opening credits to 'A Christmas Story' began to roll. "I make Dean watch this every year!"
Cas sniffled, and dropped the boxer briefs then climbed into bed again.  "Dean, you don't have to..."
Cas sighed. "Being with April was nice, but I would like to also explore the male form. I can't seem to bring myself the same kind of pleasure I had with her, and I'd like to... I don't know... Explore.  See what works for others, and maybe try it on myself."
Cas giggled as he tried to catch his breath, burying his face in the junction of Dean's neck and shoulder. "Well
Gabriel frowned. "Are you sure? You rather go with your old-ass brother over your young, hot boyfriend?"
not ready for this.  He closed his eyes and took a deep breath, willing himself not to hyperventilate in front of Dean again.
Cas was hot and sweaty, his cheeks flushed red, and his breath was coming in erratic gasps now as Dean grunted and panted above him. His eyes seemed to have lost the ability to focus as they rolled back in his head, and Dean took that opportunity to suck and nibble at his neck again, making Cas's entire body arch into him.
"Why do you just assume it's something bad? Maybe you'll actually enjoy what's about to happen here."
"Well, I'll drag you out," Dean promised.  "And if that doesn't work, I'll just crawl in there with you and we can snuggle and sleep like last time."
"I wish I were in bed with you right now...In your bed, our warm bodies pressed together... maybe a little kissing?"
Dean wrinkled his brow as he flattened his sweaty hair down in the mirror's reflection.  "Would you go if I tried to teach you?"
"Oh fuck off." Gabriel took a long sip from his glass of Pepsi, trying to hide a sheepish grin. "So you're feeling better?"
else knows," he grumbled, rolling his eyes, "I casually mentioned to Cas earlier that I was with a guy once and he's losing his shit."
Dean humored him again and fastened the hard black pads into place, shaking his head the entire time.
"Nah," Gabriel stopped him. "I'll do 'em. Go to the living room and hang with your cat," he said, staring down at the expectant feline who hadn't left Cas's side since he sat down to eat. "She missed you. I brought her up here for a few days and let her hang out. She didn't seem to mind. Oh, and by the way, did you know women love a guy with a cat?"
"Y-yes," Cas was flushing from his toes to the tips of his ears now, and Gabriel was pretending not to look at him, hiding a goofy grin.
Cas was panting now, eyes wide as he watched Dean's every movement.  He had a raging erection and his body felt strange - warm and tingly all over, but most of all in his lower abdomen. He still felt lightheaded, and he wondered if he was going to faint.
"Shhhh," Dean said, wrapping him in his arms.  "It's okay," he laughed softly. "Nothing to be ashamed of," he whispered closer to his ear.
"You did?" Cas blurted.  "I mean... um." Spontaneous plans were not Cas's forte.  He was a creature of habit, and anything that interfered with his schedule made him feel overwhelmed. He also didn't feel like leaving the house today.  At all.  Still,
"Must be nice to be a cat,"  Cas yawned at the purring ball of fur curled up at his side.  "I hope you appreciate all I do for you. I didn't even feed myself, but I dragged my ass out of bed early to feed
"I sleep okay, once I fall asleep.  I can't turn my brain off, so I toss and turn until 4 a.m. or so most nights.  So it feels like I just want to sleep all the time during the day."  Dr. Mitchell was scribbling furiously on her clipboard as he spoke.  "I'm not dealing well with work at the moment.  I keep missing days.  I'm so anxious, it's hard to leave my bed some days, but I'm also afraid I'll get fired if I miss any more."
"Good." He wound a fist in Cas's tie and yanked him closer. "Put the stick down and come to the car," he hissed in his ear. He let go and turned, striding quickly toward the door.
"Sometimes," Cas shrugged.  "But I know nothing about wine. Maybe I should have you order me something."
"You're electric too!" he yelled at a petite blonde-haired woman who wrinkled her nose at him.  "Sam, she feels electric too!"
Sam and Cas stared after him.  "Sorry, Sam," Cas said softly.   "I shouldn't have dumped that on you.  He's just so..."  He sighed.  "He's so happy and carefree when we're alone, and so uptight when you're around.   Every time he takes one step forward, he takes two steps back.  It's not like I want him to do this in public all the time or anything.  I just want him to be comfortable enough that he doesn't go into a meltdown if you happen to see him."
Cas giggled hysterically the entire way down, and whether it was the joy of nostalgia, or seeing Cas so damn carefree for a moment, Dean found himself laughing almost as hard.  The toboggan slid to a stop and they both took a second to catch their breath before Cas stood up and yelled.
"Okay. " Gabriel finished the final preparations for dinner, setting the table and tossing a little dressing on his salad as he waited for Cas to return. He cut into the lasagna and lifted out a large portion, handing the plate to Cas just as he slipped back into his dining chair.
Cas managed a weak laugh.  "No.  No, I'm fine.  P-panic attack is all," he admitted sheepishly.  "A really b-bad one. I don't know why."
"Nate!" Dean exclaimed, recognizing the familiar face.  "How've you been, man?" he asked, greeting him with the standard handshake-turned-man-hug.
It was hard to imagine anyone could take care of his baby brother as well as he could, but seeing Dean and Cas together at dinner the other night had actually made him tear up a little. Dean treated him gently, without babying him.  He encouraged without pushing too hard, much in the same way that Gabriel had always done. When he walked in on the two of them kissing, not once, bit twice, Cas looked more blissful and relaxed than he'd seen him in months, so grudgingly, he had to admit he liked the guy.
"Well if not, I'll give you my number.  If you need someone to take you, I don't mind." He steered Cas to a large white cargo van and opened the passenger side door for him, and Cas let out a nervous little laugh.
"Sam?" Gabriel stood and gently tapped Sam on the shoulder, trying not to startle him.  "Hey buddy.  We're all headed off to bed."
"I know, right?" Dean smiled.  "Maybe they don't.  This thing is ancient; think it was my dad's when he was a kid.  He used to take my brother and I here - it's the best hill ever for sled riding."
The demon shot him an disbelieving look as he stood, striding toward the door. "You're still not following? You're denser than I give you credit for! Just relax, Castiel. My staff will take care of you. It won't hurt a bit so long as you don't struggle," he sneered.
"What's wrong, Dean?  You're scowling," Cas's voice startled him, and Dean suddenly realized he'd been full-on staring for a few minutes now.
"He's right, Dean," Sam said.  "We've been taking a beating lately.  Maybe we should take a few days off, take some time to recover."
"Hold on." Dean rolled back over and rifled through the nightstand drawer. "You didn't even see the best part yet," he murmured. He held up a little silver charm, which he clipped to the front loop on the collar.
"Good.  Close your eyes," Dean said softly as he knelt down on the floor next to him.  "Breathe in through your nose.  One. Two.  Three.  Four.  Five.   Hold it.  One. Two.  Three.  Four.  Five.   Out through your mouth.  One. Two. Three. Four.  Five.  Good.  Again.  In through your nose..."
Again, Dean positioned himself behind him, and leaned Cas over the table, taking his time lining up the shot. "Just like that," he whispered against Cas's ear. "Mmm, that's good. Nice and easy..." he nuzzled the side of his cheek this time and let his teeth graze his earlobe. Cas's eyes closed and he let out a desperate little squeak.
"Let go, Sammy," Cas whispered.  "This is a safe place."  Before he had a chance to argue, Cas picked up the book and began reading.
"Deeean," Cas grinned, wrapping his arms around him. "Ohhhh. You feel electric too!" He wrapped himself around Dean's body, nuzzling against his chest. "You feel soooo good."
"Good.  Keep your legs loose but slightly bent, just like that. We're going to push off with the left foot, so turn your toe slightly to the side like this," he demonstrated. "Now put some pressure on the ice and push off."
"Yeah.  I'm good.  I just uh... I think I need to stop for now. I'm getting a little too into this and it's freaking me out," he laughed nervously.
good at it.  It was easy to slap a fake smile on his face. After all, he'd been living with depression for years now.  Faking it was just second nature to him.  He had always been - what had his doctor called it? - 'high functioning' in terms of his mental health.  He
Cas rolled his eyes.   "We've been 'fucking' like rabbits," he said, awkwardly making air quotes.  "And you're still stressed."
"Okay.  Sorry you just missed him.  It's probably better that I let him sleep, honestly. He just had an hour-long panic attack."
"Alright.  In that case..."  Dean extended a hand and reached forward in an attempt to help him up and Cas nervously grabbed his hand, allowing himself to be pulled up.
Cas frowned down at him as he adjusted his position, trying to get as much skin contact as possible.
The crunch of tires on the icy snow outside made him tense as he realized Dean was a few minutes early. Oh god, he was
"Thanks."  A long, awkward pause filled the line before Dean spoke again.  "This isn't really working, is it?  I'm mean, it's working -
Ever-so-slowly, his breathing became slower and more regular, but he kept taking long, deep breaths as he waited for his heart rate to slow.  Aside from that pesky heartbeat, he was actually starting to feel somewhat relaxed, and he startled when he suddenly realized Dean had been gently stroking his hair away from his forehead.
Cas took a deep breath and did as he was told, bending down further and shoving his ass out as he reached over the table. Dean stifled a groan as Cas's body pressed up against his, and he jumped back a few inches. He was embarrassed to realize his first instinct was to wrap his arms around his him and start kissing his neck... He hoped it was just habit from all the times he'd used the excuse of teaching pool as a seduction aid. Carefully, so as not to dry hump him into the pool table, he stepped to the side and leaned in again, feeling a little anxious this time as their hands touched. "Good. Now nice and smooth..." he maneuvered the stick and took the shot, and Cas grinned widely as the ball slammed into the pocket.
"Well," Cas swallowed hard, hoping this wouldn't sound as bad as it did in his head, "Since the weather is crappy, we could crash there for the night if you don't want to drive home in this..."  His mind was suddenly racing, and he hoped it didn't sound like a desperate invitation to sleep together.  He was making progress, but he wasn't mentally or emotionally ready for that just yet.  Well... He wanted to
He loved doing runway shows because they combined two of his passions, but here, he had to be cautious. This was about the designer's vision, not his own, and while he had
He stepped out of the shower and reached for a fluffy towel, wiping himself dry as he stared at the pile of clothes on the counter.  SpongeBob boxer shorts, a t-shirt with a cutesy cartoon turtle on it,  and a pair of jogging pants.   Could be worse, he reasoned.  He slipped into the outfit and stared at himself in the mirror for a moment.
Cas grinned and yawned at the same time. "We don't usually talk about it.  It's just that he saw some stuff my therapist sent home and it kind of came up... Of course, then he came home with enough lube and condoms for an army."
, just from Dean kissing his stomach like this.  His shirt was slid up to his armpits and he shuddered as Dean's tongue flicked against his collarbone.
"Good. Turn around. On your knees, baby," he said softly, tossing a pillow in front of him so that he could get comfortable. "Now bend over.  Ass up."
"Shit, it's getting worse out there," Dean murmured, his eyes glued to the large picture window that graced Cas's living room.  The snow was falling harder now, and it was difficult to even see across the street through the sea of white.  "Hope I can make it home."
want to go," Dean reminded him, "you can be in my booth with me, so you won't have to get too up close and personal with the crowd.  But really, don't push yourself.  If you don't feel comfortable, it's okay.  I understand. This scene is not for everybody, anxiety or not."
"Haaa..." Cas yelped and bucked his hips harder as Dean worked him open. He was starting to feel a little too good already, draped shamelessly across Dean's lap like this, but as soon as Dean started to hit that sweet spot, something in him snapped.
, per se.  It's... I don't know," he sighed.  "I think there's just this nagging voice in my head saying that it's...
Cas glanced at Dean worriedly. He knew there was no way he could tear Dean out of subspace this fast without risking some major subdrop. "Dee, can you put your shoes on like a big boy for me?"
For clarification, Cas probably wouldn't have felt much taking E while on antidepressants... I really didn't plan on letting this much time pass in between then and now but I'd already written this scene, soooo... Can we pretend it's because he hasn't been on his meds that long, coupled with not taking his pills for a few days?  Sure. ;)
"Yeah," Sam nodded tiredly.  "Sounds good."  He glanced over at Dean and Cas, who was now somewhat coherent and nuzzling at Dean's neck.  "Wait, I don't want to interrupt
"Hmm," Dean gave him a self-satisfied smirk. "Well, you're in for a treat." He opened his car door slightly to give himself more room to move, and before Cas could blink, Dean's warm mouth was wrapped around him.
Cas was curled up on Gabriel's couch again after practically being force-fed fresh bread and homemade chicken noodle soup.  He hadn't been feeling well mentally today, and as usual, Gabe had forced him out of his nice, warm bed to make him eat something.  While he appreciated the gesture, he also felt like crying for no good reason.  His brother was an old pro at this, however, and he had mastered the balance of giving him his space while not quite leaving him 'alone', and Cas appreciated that most of all.
Cas couldn't help but smile.  All the anxiety and uncertainty had rushed out of the room, and Dean was finally at his most base level, relaxed, pliant, and ready to receive all the love and attention Cas planned on giving him.  He flipped back the covers, and climbed into bed, and Dean immediately curled up to his chest.
"I don't... don't need this," he uttered weakly, cringing as his favorite toy car was slid into his hand.  "I don't." He gripped the car tightly and buried his face as Cas wrapped him in a crushing hug.  "Fuck, why do I need this?"
As much as he wanted to go in guns blazing, he knew he had to be extra careful.  Sammy wasn't there to cover his ass, so he parked the car in the most inconspicuous area possible and did a quick scan around the yard.  Seeing that the coast was clear, he cautiously made his way to the back door and slipped inside, gun drawn in front of him.
.  If he had a free hand, he'd do it himself. Whatever the hell Dean was doing to him was turning him on, and making him a tad anxious - which was, strangely enough, just making him hornier.
Gabriel smiled, eyeing up his baby brother, who was acting decidedly shyer than he'd ever seen him. "Well isn't he just the cutest?  Don't you want to just fold him up and carry him around in your pocket?" he teased.
"So if you doubt for one damn minute that I was head-over-heels stupid for you the moment we met, I'm just going to have to work harder to prove it to you."
They both made their way to their respective seats and Dean started up the van again.  "I really don't want to take you home yet," he murmured.  "But unfortunately I have to be on the road early."
"You sure you don't want to torture me yet?" Dean winked as he tossed the cloth to the floor. "Speaking of which, you never told me what your dirty little fantasy is." he said as he threaded Cas's legs through a clean set of shorts.   "You
Cas smiled.  "Sounds good." They made their final trek up the hillside, trudging slowly now as the cold and exhaustion began to wear them down.
"It's nice.  Nicely acidic.  Bright and a little citrusy.  I had some doubts, but the bubbles really work with it.  Good choice," he said proudly.  "What do you think?"
"Good.  Spread your legs for me," Dean whispered, parting Cas's knees and settling between them.  "Beautiful," he breathed as he caressed Cas's bare torso, noting the slight pink blush creeping over him.  "You okay?" he asked softly.
He shrugged to himself and rolled onto his side, watching the doorway in his peripheral vision as he zoned out.
"Fuck, you're sexy," Dean greeted him as he stepped into the living room. "Dammit, Cas, you're trying to kill me again," he said, breathing deeply as he pulled him into his arms.  "I can't wait to show you off tonight."
"Oh." Cas felt his face reddening, and he tried hard to hide his toothy grin from the prying eyes of his brother.
had killed his good mood.  What the hell was Sammy talking about?   He was always joking about it because they were so close, but he couldn't
children, so I don't see a problem.  For whatever reason, it fills a need they have. There's no shame in that. Sometimes it's physical, sometimes it's emotional.  Some like to revert back to diaper-stage, some teenagers..."  He paused as he looked at Dean, who was still squirming in his dining chair.  "You're very sexually repressed too, aren't you?"
"Jesus," he murmured to himself, dabbing his sweaty brow with some scratchy brown paper towels. He closed his eyes and took a few deep breaths, willing his heart rate to slow, while simultaneously muttering and chastising himself for being such a freakin' baby.
my boy," Dean whispered as Cas began grinding against him for all he was worth.  He pulled his body closer and nibbled at his neck while Cas gasped for breath. "That's it. Faster," he murmured.
"Right?" Dean exclaimed.   "It's... oh shit, I just noticed how exhausted you look," he laughed.  "Little tired?"
"Oh my god!  I saw your set at Ultra this summer and it was amazing!  Why are you in town?  Are you playing here anytime soon?   Can I get a picture with you?" Anna was speaking fast, fumbling over her words in her excitement.
When Dean stepped into the room a few minutes later, he chuckled softly, a self-satisfied smirk on his face.
The smell of apple pie wafted through the tiny kitchen as Cas hurried to load the dishwasher. Dean was on his way over, and his house was still a mess from baking all afternoon.
Dean flopped down on the bed and stared listlessly at the ceiling as he pondered how the hell he was going to explain himself. The stupid happy cat on his shirt was taunting him so he sat up and ripped it off, tossing it in a heap on the floor.
Dean crooked his finger until he found just the right spot inside him and began gently rubbing .  "You're gonna love this then..."
"Mr. Novak! It's been awhile. You haven't called me, so I hope things are okay?" Dr. Mitchell's smiling face greeted him as usual, and Cas couldn't help but smile a bit himself.
"Stand up," he whispered, pulling Cas up into his arms to take a few more nibbles at his neck.  "Look at how hard you are," he breathed against Cas's ear.  "You're just dripping!  You like sucking my dick that much, sweetheart?"
Cas nodded.  "Getting there. But maybe we could just stop at a drive-thru?" he asked.  "This was awesome, but I don't know if I can do a restaurant too tonight.  I'm a little overstimulated," he said weakly.
Dean grinned.  "It definitely helps. It's funny, no one's ever asked me that before. Everyone just assumes any jackass can use a computer program to make music... which is true to an extent," he sighed.  "But actual deejaying is an art.  The true test is playing live and being able to create on the fly."
Once again the house fell silent save for the Doctor's plight, as Cas lay there, deep in thought.  Gabe had been right, as usual.  Maybe he
Oh, he was well aware.  But when Cas casually suggested they add a little ageplay to their relationship, he damn near shit his pants.
Obediently, Cas bent his knees, watching Dean in eager fascination. Not being able to talk or move his arms was strangely arousing, as was this domineering version of Dean. Something about the calm, confident way he was giving orders made Cas want to submit to just about anything.  He'd always been a bit stubborn and headstrong, not to mention anxious, so this whole feeling was entirely new.
"The way you've been staring at me all night when you thought I wasn't looking...  The way you shivered when I brushed against your knee at dinner?"
Cas shushed him again and bent Dean's legs at the knee, and before Dean could even register what was happening, Cas's tongue was flicking below his balls and tracing around the pink puckered flesh below.
Cas slid down into a dining chair, suddenly realizing how much his muscles ached from those few minutes of skating last night. Or maybe it was just from that orgasm...
"I didn't finish!" Gabriel laughed. "I was going to say, you've been making it really hard to hate you, that's all."
Sam was the complete opposite of Dean.  He was much more the type that enjoyed staying home over going out.  Dean was forever trying to get him to go to the club with him, but Sam would much rather stay home and read.  He was kind of shy, and a bit of a nerd, and...
"Heh," Dean smirked. "Well buddy, I hate to break it to you, but I'm even better at sex than I am at pool."
Cas sighed heavily.  His boss could be really fucking crazy sometimes. "What's she on about now?" he asked.
Dean grinned shyly and looked down at the floor, pretending not to notice that Anna was not-so-subtly drooling over him.
"Wanna go first?  Or do you want to go together?" he asked, once he'd managed to reel himself back in.
"Uh. Well, yeah," Dean grimaced. "I have a few times. I don't anymore but when I was younger and starting out in the club scene, I did on occasion."
"Good boy," Dean whispered. "You're doing so well for me tonight. You look so beautiful like this.  So open and trusting..." He coated a thumb with the lube, then gripped his buttocks with both hands, letting his thumb rub little circles around the fluttering pink hole.
Cas's squinted and tilted his head as he generally did when he wasn't sure about something.  "I can't ask you to do that, Sam.  I know this isn't your thing and it's not going to work if you're not really into it."
"Ohhh!" Cas yelped as the swirling heat in his abdomen intensified. Fuck, he was going to come just like this... "N-no," he stuttered.
Cas smiled. "Not tonight. You're way too intoxicated. Tomorrow. I'll come by around ten. You'll be awake, right?"
he grimaced.  "It has nothing to do with actual animals.  What I'm asking you to do isn't even sexual anyway.  I just think it would help with your intimacy issues."
"Hey, to be fair, I prefer to use it on others.  But I'd totally let you cage me, if you wanted to."
many chances...  and not just for talking.   I'm going to do every single one of those things to you."
"Here.  You take the front this time," Cas suggested.  He climbed in behind Dean and held on tightly as the sled hurtled down the hill once again.  All at once, the toboggan hit a bump and skidded sideways, dumping them on their side as Cas squealed with laughter.
With the faint, familiar fluttering sound of invisible wings, Dean's entire body unclenched, just a little.
brother?  Or the same age?  I mean... would that be so bad?  It wouldn't be much different than the other day, really.  I can uh.  You know, help him get his cereal and... um... I don't know..."
He took a few dabs of pomade and ran his fingers through his hair, trying to make himself look casually disheveled, just like Gabriel had done the day before. Shrugging at his reflection, he washed his hands then spritzed himself with a bit of cologne before opening the door.
"Oh don't look at me like that. It was just a little angel fainting spell. The only hit you took was when you collapsed on the floor like a child's rag doll. I must admit, I didn't expect it to be quite that effective, but I suppose Mother has a
"Here," Dean said as loaded the sled through the big cargo doors.  "Sit for a minute," he pulled his gloves off and motioned to the back of the van.  Cas took a seat while Dean dug around for the socks he'd stashed in the front.
It was kind of ironic taking relationship advice from him, since he had a bit of a reputation as a playboy.  Still, his exes never seemed to harbor any ill-will since he was up front about his intentions, so it was possible that Gabriel
"I want to," Dean murmured in between kisses, "Slowly strip off this trench coat..." He pulled back long enough to slide Cas's arms out of the sleeves, letting it pool on the floor behind him.  He gave him a long, deep kiss before continuing and Cas's head felt so light, he thought he might float away.
Cas just stood there, trying his hardest to blend in with the tile wall, but he couldn't help the sob that escaped his throat.
Cas furrowed his brow and placed a hand on the table, trying to remember what Dean had done. He bent awkwardly and tried to stab at the ball, his stick wildly flopping as he failed to guide the front of the cue.
pretty," he admitted. "If you had told me a year ago I'd ever let someone put a collar on me... and that I'd
"Oh."  Sam felt his face flush.  He hadn't even thought about it, but pouring Dean's cereal for him just felt right.  And he had just
Gabriel paused mid-wipe and his features softened.  "Aww, Cassie.  You really like this guy, don't you?"
Gabriel laughed.  "C'mon.  Spare bedroom's this way.  Good night, lovebirds." Sam shambled off after him, waving a little goodbye as he headed down the hallway.
Cas had a fleeting moment of panic as he heard the knock on the door, and he considered hiding in his bedroom and pretending he wasn't home.
. He hadn't come so much in such a short period of time since he first discovered masturbating.  He blanched, remembering how shamelessly bold he had been.
"What are..." Sam looked up as he heard the plate slide and started to speak, but he quickly stopped himself as Cas glanced up and shot him a pleading look  "Oh..."  A million thoughts ran through his head as he sat there, silently staring at his mopey older brother who suddenly looked naive and helpless as he watched Cas cutting his pancakes.
"Dean. You need this. Please,  baby,  just put it on." He stepped closer and held the shirt out to him, and despite his complaints, Dean didn't move.
it.  He sucked and licked fervently, listening for the times that Dean's breath caught in his throat, and trying his best to make it happen again.
Cas grabbed his arm and pulled him in close, letting Dean lean into his shoulder.  "Well, regardless," he said, gently kissing his forehead, "I spoke to him.  Everything is fine."
"Hmmm." Gabriel thought for a moment. "Didn't you buy a ridiculously expensive pair of jeans a while back? That you've never worn?"
"The colors.  Separate the white stuff from the dark-colored stuff," he said as he started sorting into two piles.  It was mostly his clothing anyway since that was all Cas had been wearing lately.  He pulled a pair of black boxer briefs from the pile and added it to the darks, suddenly feeling a little weird that Cas had been wearing his underwear... and, now that he stopped to think about it, a little turned on.   He quickly shook the thought from his head, and made a mental note to take him shopping soon.
"I'm sorry!"  He was silent for a few moments as he started the car and turned it onto the main road.  "You and Dean still haven't...?"
Cas shrugged. "I don't know. We haven't really talked about it yet. I imagine he'll be spending part of it with his brother though. They're really close."
"Then I'll take you to one of my favorite brunch places," Dean continued, "and after that, I have to do some work unfortunately, but you can come over and keep me company, if you'd like."
Gabriel's front door suddenly opened and Cas came strolling in with Scout purring happily in his arms.
.  Making his way back to the living room where Dean was now waiting, Cas suddenly realized that aside from the whole almost-naked-thing,  he didn't feel too anxious today.  Still depressed, yes, but the anxiety seemed to be a bit better.  Maybe his meds were starting to work.  Or maybe he was finally getting more comfortable being around Dean. Either way, it was nice for a change.
"Yeah.  Kind of. He's been really patient. I mean, he gives me a little nudge outside of my comfort zone sometimes, but in a good way."
Cas nodded in agreement.  "Soo... speaking of work, what was that all about back there?  With Anna?"
Dean nodded.  "Stay here, I'll get 'em.". He hurried off to the bathroom, thankful for the excuse to step away from this awkwardness for a minute.  He picked up each of Cas's strewn articles of clothing, all of which were still sitting in front of the shower where the goons had left them, and he took a moment to compose himself before returning.
"Mmm, I get a little needy afterwards," Dean admitted sheepishly.  "I need to touch you." He twined their legs together, repeatedly rubbing every inch of skin he could reach.
Cas moaned as Dean continued grinding up against him. "I... I don't know," he choked as his eyes began welling with tears. "I need more," he managed. "
"That's it," Dean murmured. "Show me what you need, baby. Oh god, you have a gorgeous ass..." He smoothed a hand over the smooth curves as he gently wiggled his finger, angling for just the right spot.
The seats continued to fill around them, and Cas just sat there, eyes closed, slowly breathing in Dean's scent.  He'd almost forgotten this smell; the smell of soap mixed the leather and spicy bay rum scent of his aftershave. He hadn't been this close to him since they fell asleep together, and right now, that scent and that warmth were keeping him grounded.
Dean smirked and swallowed hard, taking in every last bit until Cas crashed down exhausted on the bed.
"Yeah," Dean said, wiping at his face.  "Yeah.  I'm alright. Just a little embarrassed.  Every time I think I'm somewhat okay again, this seems to happen," he sighed.  "Will you lie back down with me?" he asked, holding the blanket up for Cas to crawl under.
"You're absolutely lovely, Dean, " Cas murmured, splaying his fingers and dragging them down his torso.  "You have freckles on your shoulders too, " he whispered, smiling in awe of this new discovery. "And across your clavicle ..." he gently thumbed over his collarbone, making Dean shiver.
Despite being a little sore, at least he was warm and comfortable.  Dean was spooned up behind him with an arm locked snugly around his waist, his warm breath tickling Cas's ear.  If he hasn't felt Dean's morning erection digging into the crack of his bare ass, he would almost have to question if last night had really happened.  He expected his ass to be sore in the morning, and he was pleasantly surprised to find that it was possibly the only part of his body that wasn't.
It had been many years since Dean laced up a pair of skates, but he used to be pretty damn good at skating. Now he wondered if he even remembered
"Cas, thanks for putting up with me," Dean said softly.  " I guess this was kind of a weird date, but it was really nice." They were standing face-to-face at the end of Cas's driveway, sweaty and panting from shoveling the heavy, wet snow.
Crowley rolled his eyes and snapped his fingers, and the gag fell away. "Uh uh uh," he warned as Castiel opened his mouth to yell. "Play nice now, or I'll put it back on."
"Yeah.  Well, close to his brother, anyway.  He raised his brother when their parents died too," Cas said. "So you have that in common.  They live practically across the street from each other now."
Cas nodded and dug his pill keychain out of his pocket as Dean worked quickly to remove his skates. He opened the tiny container with trembling hands and slipped a pill under his tongue.
"I'd probably be more embarrassed if you didn't like it so much," Dean smirked.  "The way your eyes roll back when I call you a good boy... Mmm.  Besides, I like to praise my baby when he does what I ask.  I
He shook his head and sighed, still in disbelief that Dean was seeing him like this.  He pulled his legs up to hide himself a bit, but the ribbon was digging into his balls.
"Okay, okay!" Dean cut him off.  "I guess if I'm going to do this, I might as well go all the way. Gimme the damn plug."
"Mmm," Dean hummed, digging his fingers into Cas's hair and lapping into his mouth as he increased the friction between them.
"Cas.  You are not expendable. C'mon, buddy.  Don't you ever think that.  We couldn't do this without you.  And you make plenty of good choices.   Unfortunately sometimes both of the choices are shit, but we do the best we can. And you always do what you think is right.  Just because we've had a lot of bad breaks doesn't make us worthless."
Cas breathed a little sigh of relief and returned to his books, zoning out as he placed each one in order on the shelves.  Usually he found organizing relaxing, so he quelled his anger by drowning himself in numbers until every single book was back in it's rightful place.
Dean grunted and moaned, quieting Cas's uncontrollable chattering by roughly kissing him. "You must be rolling pretty hard. I've never heard you talk so much," he chuckled. "Less talking, more kissing."
He glanced back at the TV, but he just couldn't focus with all of the guilt and worry in his head. It was all his fault... well, him and
"Alright, " Cas whispered. His hand softly wrapped around his cock and Dean let out a ridiculously loud moan.
"Look at me, baby," Dean whispered, sliding his tongue closer and closer to his cock. "You like being tied up?"
Cas nodded in exhaustion.  "I'm good," he murmured, giggling as Dean covered his face in kisses. "It's so much better when we go together."
," he muttered.  "I wish you could make all of my decisions for me... keep me from messing up.  I... I want that so much."  He suddenly shook his head and covered his face in embarrassment. "I'm sorry.  That's ridiculous.  I shouldn't have said that," he said, covering his face in embarrassment.
"Not yet.  I'll take care of you, but only after I fuck that tight little ass of yours," he hissed, sliding his hands down over Cas's cheeks and giving them a squeeze. "Bend over."  He effortlessly spun Cas around and bent him over the counter again.
Dean Winchester was never one to relax and take it easy, but with a little unconventional training from Cas, he'd finally learned to let go.  He'd fought it every step of the way, of course, but he'd actually come to enjoy giving himself over to Cas once in a while.  They had only been at this a few weeks, but the changes in Dean extended well beyond their playtime.  He had more self-confidence lately.  He relaxed more, and he was less prone to anger and making snap decisions.  Overall, he just seemed a little less
"Hey," Dean said, softer this time.  "Are you... crying?" He could just barely hear sniffling, so he pried Cas's arm away from his face to reveal the wet tracks on his cheeks. "Cas, what's wrong?" he asked, panicked that maybe he pushed him a little too far.
"Hey, Gabe," he said casually as he opened the refrigerator and placed his pie on the top shelf. "We're here. Can I do anything?"
"S-so I had one made! I didn't intend on you finding it! And I wasn't even going to suggest it for a long time!"
"Alright, that's kind of fun," he admitted quietly.  He wiggled his hips harder, letting the tail slap against his cheeks while Cas tried hard to hide his smile.
"Me neither," Cas giggled, sprawling flat on his back.  He stared up at falling snowflakes backlit by the lonely streetlight as he tried desperately to catch his breath.   "You know what else I haven't done since I was a kid?" he puffed.
"You're fine," he said casually.  "Soooo.  Do you know even the damn restaurants are closed today?  I tried three places and gave up.  So it looks like we're having Taco Bell," he said sheepishly, holding up two paper bags.  "Lamest date ever.  You said you like Mexican, right?" he laughed.  "It's uh...
"Yeah.  So cute I want to gag," Sam grimaced. "So Gabe," he said, changing the subject.  "This is the best turkey I've ever eaten.  What is that, rosemary that tastes so good?"
"Coffee's fine.  Black, please," Dean replied.  He lowered his voice to a low, sexy growl as he turned back to Cas. "Gonna have to start rewarding you for that bravery..."
Dean smirked and wound a bite around his own fork.  "Told ya.   So... Did you bring a hat and gloves?"
"Now take the detergent and pour some into the cap.  There you go.  Now dump that in.  Turn this knob," he said, turning the knob for a full wash, "and pull."  The washing machine whirred to life and began filling with water and Cas jumped at the noise.  "That's it.  Now we'll come back when it's done, and I'll show you what to do with the dryer."
"For someone who doesn't want this to be sexual, you seem awfully excited," Cas said wryly as he glanced at the bulging fabric.
"I used to get 'em on occasion," Dean winked.  "For no good reason, really.  And I know that I felt drained and shaky and awful the rest of the day when it happens.  C'mon, I'll even take you home if you want.  You live far from here?"
"You did everything I told you to," Dean said softly, as he pulled Cas into his arms.   "Just like we talked about.  You were perfect.  And we're done playing for now, so relax and let me take care of you."  He lurched forward, rolling Cas onto his back and peppering his face and neck with kisses.
Sam sighed and shrugged his shoulders.  "Nah, it's alright.   What else was I gonna do alone all weekend?"
"Dammit," Dean muttered.  It never failed.  Anytime he set up some music to auto-play so that he could take a quick bathroom break, someone had to talk to him.  He plastered a smile on his face anyway as he glanced up. Strolling toward the booth was a tall, scruffy-looking  man dressed from head to toe in black.
Dean nodded nervously.  Jesus, what was happening to him?  This whole thing was making him feel a bit too mushy.  This was supposed to be a quickie no-strings fling, but he was feeling all sorts of things that he shouldn't be.
"I know this place..." Dean winked.  "C'mon." He grabbed Cas's elbow and lead him toward the van. "Careful.  It's really slippery here," he instructed as they lightly tread over an icy patch.  Cas took three steps and his stupid sensible shoe slipped on the ice.  He flailed wildly for a split second until Dean steadied him, and somehow they wound up face-to-face as Cas nearly stumbled.
Dean's hand gripped his firmly and gave a gentle tug and almost immediately, Cas found himself crawling across the couch to be nearer.  His breathing was becoming quicker though as the anxiety of being so close to Dean hit him, and once again, he tried to convince himself not to hyperventilate.
hard time with it. I even let a stranger crash at my house and he ended up robbing me," he grimaced sheepishly. "I realize that probably wasn't the best idea... Anyway, I figure the best thing I can do is just help when I can, one person at a time. I'm lucky that I'm in a position where I
"Cas," Dean protested.  Okay, he could deal with the touching, but the sweet talk had to go.  He felt like he was under a magnifying glass with Cas examining him so carefully.  Sure he might seem pulled together from a distance, but up close up he was a hot mess.   He sure as hell wasn't worthy of this body worship.
It didn't matter how much time passed, Dean wasn't sure he'd ever be totally comfortable talking to Sam about his relationship with Cas.  Coming to terms with being bisexual had been hard, and admitting he'd been pining over Cas for years was still a bit humiliating, no matter how supportive Sammy was.  That may have been why he was extra paranoid about their kink habits.
Dean's face reddened as he thought about the note, and he focused harder on sawing the rope on Cas's other leg.  "I think he thought he was doing me a favor," he muttered sheepishly.
"Good.  Well with that, I think I'm going to go have a quick shower. Feel free to turn the TV or the radio on."
comfortable.  It was confusing, to say the least.  He'd always thought he hated being touched, but perhaps all of the
Finally, Gabriel couldn't help but laugh at his brother's desperate attempts to contradict him.  "You look tired.  Why don't you go watch TV until dinner's ready?  It won't be much longer."
"What would you like to do after dinner?" Cas asked as he sat down across from him with his coffee. "I think we should stay inside today, but tomorrow we can go out if you'd like. Maybe to the zoo?"
"Okay." Cas assumed the proper cuddling position and Dean slipped in behind him, wrapping his arm around his waist.
Dean chuckled and choked at the same time at Cas's inexperienced enthusiasm, and he pressed a hand firmly against his lower stomach to prevent him from moving his hips.  He smirked at the high-pitched little whimpers coming from Cas's throat, feeling pretty damn good about himself, knowing that he could coax those debauched noises from his usually gravel-voiced boyfriend on command.
"You're such a sweet boy," Cas murmured gently.   "Look, you go down to the garage, and I'll ask Sammy if he wants any McDonald's, okay?"
"No," Cas said.  "Except I drove there this morning anyway.  My boss called everyone but me to tell us we were closed. It was a nightmare.  They hadn't plowed or salted yet.  Took me forty minutes each way."
"Are you okay there, sweetheart?" A petite blonde man with piercing blue eyes stood in front of him, staring with a mix of concern and curiosity.
"Hmmph."  Cas was still frowning as he stared at Dean.  "You look agitated," he said finally.  "Why don't you go clean up and get into your little clothes and we'll..."
"Of course it is.  That was a stupid question," Cas scoffed. "I mean, is this like... live music or...?"
he do this?  This was way more complex than he originally thought.  He really should have done some research on this whole age-play thing first.
To be honest, Dean didn't suck dick often; frankly, he tended to date more women than men, but when he did, he really threw himself into his work; Dipping up and down, head bobbing hungrily, swirling his tongue around the head as Cas slowly began to fall apart.
Dean rolled over, abandoning the bear in favor of curling up close to Cas's chest, where he was wrapped in a crushing hug. He had to admit, he loved the constant cuddling. Sure, he'd always liked a
"Shhh.  It's just me, sweetheart," he whispered as Cas startled, giving him a soft kiss on his shoulder.
Cas took a deep breath as he let the picture form in his mind - Dean kissing him.  Dean's hands sliding up his back.  Dean's tongue sliding between his lips and mingling with his own. Dean's lips brushing against his ear and making their way down the side of his neck.  They hadn't gone much further than that just yet, but it was enough to make Cas's body feel things he had never felt before.  A little moan escaped his lips and he felt a warm flush creeping over his body.
Cas couldn't help but laugh.  "Sort of.  But it's fine.  Who doesn't like Taco Bell?"  Part of him was suddenly giddy at the fact that Dean had just called this a 'date'.  He'd never understand it, but for some reason Dean
With the icy roads and multiple reports of traffic accidents, Gabe was pacing as he waited for Dean's van to pull into the driveway, so when he finally heard the crunch of tires on the snow, he breathed a sigh of relief. All these years and he still worried whenever Cas was out in snowstorms. He retreated back to his kitchen and began slicing a french baguette from his bakery, humming softly to himself as he heard Cas's front door open and shut. Slathering each slice with some garlic butter, he arranged the bread slices on a tray and popped them into the oven, then waited just a few more minutes before picking up his phone and dialing Cas's number.
Dean's eyes fluttered shut a few times, so when he first felt it, he thought he was dreaming - but no, there it was again, rubbing against his thigh. The sudden realization of what was happening hit him and his eyes flew open yet again.   Yes, Cas was definitely humping his leg.
Cas squirmed uncomfortably at the praise and he inwardly groaned.  He certainly didn't feel beautiful. Right now he felt like a gawky, awkward teenager again.
"Shit," Cas whispered to himself.  It was rare he resorted to common human curses, but now seemed like a good time to use one.  Quietly, he opened the passenger side door and slid in next to him.
Cas sighed, giving him that world-weary look he often did when Dean acted like a prude.  "I don't understand how you can be so innocent with the way you talk about
"Ahhh. Fuck. I um... " Cas's face was contorted in uncertainty and a series of groans kept rising from his throat. "It's weird," he managed.
Dean grinned. "It'll help you relax. Did you know orgasms are clinically proven to relieve the symptoms of anxiety and depression?" he winked. "Pants off. Doctor's orders."
Cas whimpered excitedly as Dean's hand slid further up his thigh and then dipped into the front flap of his boxers.
"I feel really good right now," he gushed.  "My whole body feels so warm and rela-relaxed.  Deeean?  Does your body feel like this?"
"Deeean," Cas moaned.  "I um..."  His entire body felt like it was on fire and the feeling in his abdomen was getting too intense to bear.
"C-Cas?" he stuttered, both staring and trying to avert his eyes at the same time.  He quickly slipped the gun back into his jacket pocket.  "Holy shit, uh..." He tried to partially cover his eyes as he walked closer, trying to figure out what to do about this. "What the hell happened?  Who did this to you?" Dean asked, the note echoing in his head pointed to Crowley but he sure as hell didn't understand
Cas bit his lip and closed his eyes, and Dean suckled the nipple into his mouth before licking across his chest to tease at the other one.
"Want a cookie?" Sam asked, breaking the silence between them.  He slid the plate over to Dean and offered him his untouched glass of milk.
Cas could feel his face burning with embarrassment - god, he could barely speak and he was stuttering like an idiot.  "I-I uh, I don't want you to risk the roads..."
Dean chuckled softly. "Oh, sweetheart. It'll work. You just need to ease into it. Try again," he coaxed.
"Oh my god," Cas murmured.  "How do you even hide a bottle this big?" There was no being discreet about this.  Sure, he'd seen the same bottle on Gabe's nightstand, but Cas wasn't as keen on keeping an econo-size bottle of lube on permanent display.  He chuckled nervously at his brother's ridiculous purchase, shaking his head.  He picked up the bag to toss it, but realized there was another lightweight box in the bottom.  Curiously, he fished it out and stared at the package.
Dean grabbed a towel from his cabinet and casually began drying his hair. "What? A dog? No, why?" he yelled back through the bathroom door. After a beat of silence, the door slowly opened, and Dean stepped out. "Ohh," he grinned anxiously. "
Cas made a sobbing noise as he drew closer to climax, and Dean paused for a second to make sure he was okay, but his head was firmly guided back to Cas's cock.
Cas tried not to laugh, but he was tired and the ridiculousness of the evening was finally starting to sink in.  "Shut
Dean couldn't help but burst out laughing.  "Baby," he said, pulling him in closer, "we can do that any time you want."
"Don't feel obligated, of course," Cas continued casually.  "I was just offering a possible solution to both of our problems."
"A little," Dean chuckled warmly. "You have nothing to feel guilty about, sweetheart. You know that, right?"
"Ohhhhh," Cas whimpered again. "I um..." He subconsciously licked his lips and closed his eyes for a second as he tried to reason with himself. He
Dean nodded, running his fingers gently through Cas's hair.  "It'll get easier.  Look at all you've done today!  It's a far cry from the first night when you hyperventilated and passed out from just talking to me!"
Dee considered this for a moment, looking back and forth between Cas and Sammy. He glanced longingly at the castle and then back to Sammy again.   Finally, he nodded.  "Okay."  Sammy stood and helped him to his feet, smiling warmly as he slipped an arm around his shoulder.
Dean swallowed hard again and cleared his throat.   "First thing I want you to do is just relax and let me wash you."
Dean grinned and blew on his spit-slicked cock, causing Cas to twitch even more, and then grabbed under his knees and shoved until his legs were in the air.
"Alright.  Now get in here." He held his arms open and Cas immediately latched onto him."That's better," he sighed happily. "I'm so glad you're okay," he murmured.
For a brief second, he considered going down there to rent a pair of skates, but thought better of it.  He really didn't have time to be messing around today. Besides, he thought, he should wait and bring Cas here anyway.  If nothing else, he needed to see the Rockefeller tree lit up at night.
naive when it came to sex.  He set his phone down as he stared dumbfounded at the TV.   It just made sense, but he hadn't really thought about it until right now.   Shit, he wondered if that had been Cas's first actual kiss...
Cas shut the door behind him and came striding over, his very erect cock bobbing slightly as he walked.
"Nah, I feel fine now." Cas took a bite of his lasagna and hummed happily. "You know, Dean's taken me to a few fancy Italian places, but no one's lasagna even comes close to yours..." He paused, noticing a white bakery box on the counter. "You're happy to have me home, aren't you?"
"Mmfff," Dean mumbled, his cheeks packed full of food. He paused to chew as Sam glared at him.   "Why?  This is no different than any other time.  We always run ourselves ragged like this."
I had planned to do three parts to this originally, but this one went a little longer than I expected.  I think maybe a timestamp or two later?  I'd like to explore what happens a little further down the road, but maybe more so in a few short scenes...  Anyway, thanks, all. <3
, Sam.  You have to get completely out of your own mind and into the mindset of a child.  He'll be able to tell if you're faking," Cas said.  "Are you familiar with BDSM practices?  Dominants and submissives and things like that?"
"Good job eating all your dinner!   Such a good boy.  So what about tonight?" Cas repeated.   "I have a train set, and some cars, and some board games if you'd like. "
Dean suddenly noticed that Cas was watching him in wide-eyed rapt fascination, and it was a bit unnerving. He nervously licked his lips again and continued.
"Beautiful.   You're doing so well," Dean panted. "So obedient.  So eager. Fuck!  I'm gonna cum, sweetheart. Swallow for me," he said as gripped Cas's hair again.  "All of it.  Fuck!  Oh god..."
"No, no.  That's perfect.  I'll pick you up there, okay?"  He pulled into the driveway where Cas had pointed and put the van in 'park'.
-weird, just... weird. This was the type of kissing people in a new relationship did. And goddammit, Cas hadn't really even touched him yet. Fuck, he was getting frustrated. If Cas wasn't going to make a move soon, he just might do it himself.
When he pulled up to the house, the plows had gone by, shoving another foot of snowy ice chunks at the end of the driveway.  He was still too damn angry to get out and shovel again, so he crossed his fingers and drove over the pile, thankfully making it without getting stuck.  The drive home had been horrendous, and he was shaking with nervous energy by the time he got out of the car. He stormed into the house and slammed the door, kicking his shoes halfway across the entryway.
Cas gritted his teeth and exhaled sharply through his nose. "What do you want from me?" he asked firmly. It had been a while since they had been at each other's throats, and this attack had caught him completely off-guard.
"Hey. How many times have I told you to stop apologizing?" Dean asked, propping himself on one elbow to run his fingers through Cas's hair. "Stop stressing about it.  We have plenty of fun without the sex. That'll happen when it happens."
grown to trust Dean in the short time they'd known each other.  "Yeah," he grumbled.  "Let's go then."
"Wrong answer," Dean admonished, shoving his two middle fingers into Cas's mouth, making an effective gag as he pressed down on the back of his tongue.
"We're gonna play a little game tonight, okay? " Dean breathed. Ever-so-slowly he unbuttoned and rolled up his sleeves, and then removed his vest.  "Baby's been such a good boy tonight, I thought maybe we could toy around with that little fantasy of yours... And one of mine too."
Entranced that Dean had slipped back into that demanding mode, that cool, confident demeanor that made his dick take notice, Cas slipped out of his sleep pants and boxers. It was early, and he was already shirtless from sleeping, something that finally felt normal and natural, thanks to Dean's gentle coaxing.
"I get back Sunday morning.  I have this fashion stuff all week, then a party Saturday night.  You know, since I only work a few days a week, and you're not working right now... maybe I can see you before Friday?" Dean asked, suddenly cringing at how desperate his voice sounded.
Sam jumped as he heard the bathroom door open, and he glanced up to see Dean hurrying off his bedroom, likely to sulk.  The slam of the door confirmed his suspicions.
"Oh! Wow. I guess that will encourage you to go, huh? Is this the same guy we were talking about last time? Dean?"
Minutes passed with Cas not saying a word, but gradually, his breathing became slow and regular again.
"I'm the parental figure in this game.  You, like Dee, would be the child," Cas continued.  "When he reverts back, he gets into an 8-year-old's mindset.  My other concern is that if you're little too, he might feel like he has to take care of you again."
Cas pulled away, frowning in confusion.  "So why did you keep telling me to be quiet?"  He tried to divert his gaze from Dean's naked body, but his eyes couldn't help but wander.
Gabe chuckled again. "I just mean, Cas has said a lot of good things about you. No offense, but I thought you'd be a
The sun was shining when Cas awoke, streaming through the apartment window, and glaring annoyingly in his face. He groaned and rolled over, reaching for Dean, but was met with a cold nothingness where a warm body once lay. He blinked hard and rubbed at his eyes, giving them a minute to adjust to the brightness before sitting up.
Gabriel grinned and closed his eyes, rubbing at his temples. "Let's just agree that sexuality can be complicated sometimes, huh?  C'mon. They're gonna think we got lost."
"Hugging you feels weird. I mean, it's good-weird," Cas babbled. "It's like you're... electric. It feels
Weakly, Cas crawled forward a few paces and collapsed across Dean's thighs, and Dean pulled his shorts down to his knees.
"That's sweet, but you didn't have to..." Cas started, but he was interrupted by the oven timer. "Shit, I guess I have to get up," he sighed.  Grudgingly, he stood and made his way to the kitchen to pull the hot pie out of the oven, and while he was there, he decided to grab some drinks and snacks before heading back toward Dean.
, it feels so good. I love you, Dean.  Ohhhh. I love you. I need you so much... mmmm." Cas knew he was babbling, but he couldn't stop gushing about
Dean sighed.  "Yeah," he muttered unconvincingly.  "Hey, your laundry's probably done.  Let's go put it in the dryer.  And then I'm going to visit my old pal Johnnie if you want to join me."
"That's good, Dean," Cas hushed.  He slowly began moving his finger in and out, and Dean was surprised that it wasn't as bad as he had anticipated.  He continued until he could feel Dean's body start to respond to his touch.  "Now how does this feel?"  He crooked his finger and began gentle little caresses inside of him, at a little spot Dean could only assume was his prostate.
"Thanks for the invite. I uh, I brought wine," Dean said, awkwardly holding out the bottle in front of him.
called each other just to chat, and he felt clumsy and awkward trying to make small talk. "It was... I don't know, a normal day.  We just got back from a job in Wichita. A Khan worm got in my head and Sammy had to zap the shit out of me. So that was fun. Came home, had a burger and some beer and called you."
"I mean it, Sam.  I know you had Dean when you were younger,  but that doesn't make up for not having a parent around.  Your issues are different than Dean's, but that doesn't make them less important."
Cas Novak hated days like today.  From the moment he woke up, everything that could possibly go wrong did.  His alarm didn't go off so he overslept.  When he wandered into the living room, he somehow managed to stub his toe on the coffee table, taking off half his toenail in the process.  While ironing his pants, he burned his hand.  He dribbled toothpaste on his only clean shirt, and now, he had spilled hot coffee on his lap and didn't have time to turn around and change.  He fanned his pants away from his leg as best he could, and pulled the car over to the side of the road, dabbing at his leg with a pile of napkins.
"Yeah, okay," Dean shrugged.  "Cable blows anyway."  He stood up and flicked the television off, and followed Cas as he grabbed his hand and led him up to his bedroom.
The snow swirled down softly around them as they made the long ride downtown, with Cas happily manning the stereo, but as the traffic slowed and grew dense, he started to lose interest.  He stared out his window instead, marveling at the famous buildings, and taking in the lights of the city.
"That's it.  Mmm, that feels nice," Dean murmured as Cas worked.  He watched from the corner of his eye as Cas sniffled,  the tears finally drying on his face.  He looked so focused and determined to do a good job, it was almost comical, though Dean wouldn't dare laugh.  Instead, he closed his eyes and concentrated on the sensation of the warm water, the spicy smell of soap, and Cas's soft touch.
Dean politely declined. "No, thank you. I'm so full, but I have to save a little room for that dessert."
out of you.  I had a feeling that might be what was happening, but I kept at it.  I'm sorry.  That was cruel of me."
Dean took a deep breath, tears stinging at his eyes.  Just talking about this made Cas look younger and scared and vulnerable, and god, did he fucking hate that.
He closed his eyes and took a deep breath, trying to fall back to sleep, but his mind just wouldn't stop racing.
"Yeah," Cas said.  "I'm eating, but mostly because Gabe makes me," he said sheepishly.  "If I had to make my own dinner, I'd probably just lie in bed instead.  I don't have much energy."
"Just my pride," Cas sighed.   Dean finally managed to free one of his legs and Cas stretched and flexed his foot a few times to get the feeling back into it.  "Are you sure there's no one here?  Why would he kidnap me to get you here?"
"Yeah.  It probably will.  But in the meantime, you're at least going to try to eat something.  Fifteen minutes and I'm coming down there."
Cas shook his head.  "So she comes in just to fuck with all of us, then she takes the day off?  That woman takes more vacation days than the entire staff combined!"  He took a long, deep breath to calm his frazzled nerves.  "Well, I guess I shouldn't complain.  That means she'll be out of my hair at least."
Sam knew - It wasn't like they'd ever had a heart-to-heart converstation or anything,  Sam just seemed to
Maybe it was the way Cas kept looking at him with those wide, imploring blue eyes, like he was something delicate and precious.  Who the hell did he think he
Tentatively, Sam opened the lid, smiling as he realized the bucket was full of tiny Legos.  "Awesome, " he murmured sheepishly.
Gabriel nodded.   "I know, I know.  How do you survive as an administrative assistant who hates being on the phone?"
Dean just laughed.  There was that excited six-year-old again, eyes shining, not a care in the world.  Seeing him like this was all Dean needed. He gave Cas's hair a quick tussle and put his arm around him again.
"I know," Dean sighed. "There are no comforting words, really. It just sucks... Hey, this is where we're eating tonight," he said, stopping in the middle of the sidewalk. Cas looked up at the building beside them.
"Go ahead.  I'll take this one," he motioned with a smile.  "Cas?  Hey.  Wake up, sweetheart.  Let's go up to bed."
moment as Cas's tongue licked against the seam of his lips,  and he opened his mouth, letting their tongues caress, before pushing back against him to regain control of the situation.   Immediately, Cas went limp and pliant, allowing Dean to take the lead.  Dean knew he had been wanting this, but he didn't realize how badly he
to be the older brother.  All his life, he was supposed to be an example for Sammy, be strong for Sammy. The fact that Sam had seen him acting so vulnerable was making his skin crawl today.  The more he thought about it, the more embarrassed he felt.
"So your job is to get the striped balls into the pockets by hitting them with the cue b... " he paused and corrected himself, "the
"Hey.  Chihuahuas bite more people each year than any other dog," Gabriel protested.  "I may be small, but I'm scrappy."
Dean's brow wrinkled into a severe crease as he frowned. "Oh, Cas.  Thank you, but that low self-esteem of yours has got to go," he sighed.  He rolled over and reached toward the nightstand, returning with the collar from earlier in his hand. "Here."
"You know what else is attractive?   The way you work with your hands," Cas hummed as he continued kissing his way down his body.  "The way you take care of your car... the way you handle yourself around creatures that would send most men running.  Mmmm.  You don't even know what you do to me, Dean."
"You don't like it? " Cas asked.  He cocked his head and gave him that slightly hurt and confused look that always seemed to rip Dean's heart out.
"This one?  It's a Ford Galaxie.  Maybe 1970?"  Mindlessly, he dug through the shiny metallic pile, visually identifying each car as Cas looked on in amusement.  He picked up the Impala again and touched the wheels to the floor, then rolled it back and forth a few times.
Cas kicked his shoes off and pulled his legs up onto the bed, leaning his back against the wall as Dean passed him the bottle.
When Dean was finally old enough, he filed for custody of his brother and got them the hell out of there, settling in a little town a few hours from New York.  There, he could find work in the city while Sam finished high school.  It really hadn't been that long, but it seemed like a lifetime ago.  Dean was twenty-seven now, Sam twenty-three, and they were still impossibly close.  So close, that when Dean's career started to take off, he bought two houses on the same street, one for him, and one for his brother.  They might as well just live together since they were always at each other's houses, but it was nice to have their own space.
Cas slumped down on his stool, pretending not to watch and feeling a bit sulky as more people strolled up to talk. Dean, of course, was the pinnacle of professionalism. He was used to the attention and gracious to to everyone who came over to talk. He took all of the flirting in stride, deflecting it in his typically charming way so as not to offend any of his fans.
"Oh.  Yeah. Pssh. It took like fifteen minutes.  Kind of pissed me off, because our sound guy should have caught it to begin with.  Oh well.  Hey, here's something random:  Have you ever been ice skating?"
Cas closed his eyes and took a deep breath, willing the moment to just be over already, and Dean worked faster, trying his best to minimize his discomfort. When the bow was finally removed, Cas sighed in relief, and Dean returned to fiddling with the locks.
Cas laughed softly.   "I'm not asking you to wear a diaper.  I'm just saying, you might really benefit if you got into a childlike mindset once in a while.  You're physically and emotionally drained. Let me take care of you, give you all the love and praise and encouragement you never got as a child.  A little structure, a little discipline..."
," he demanded.  "And quietly. Sammy should be back any minute," he motioned toward the door. Slowly, he removed his hand from Cas's mouth to let the poor angel finally speak.
"Uhh," Dean laughed, "I think I mentioned most of it.  Restraints, collars, spanking, sometimes a little orgasm control... I
"Hey Cas, De...ee," Sam corrected himself quickly, noticing the timid, vulnerable look on his brother's face. "What's up?"  He was leaning against the counter, impatiently waiting for his coffee to brew when he noticed them come into the kitchen.  Almost immediately he could tell Dean was in subspace, and he softened his tone of voice as if talking to a frightened animal.
Dean snorted. "I was teasing.  But it's when you think you're going to cum, so you stop and see how long you can prolong it... Uh, anyway."
"No worries."  Sam continued pecking away at his keyboard, glancing up occasionally in amusement as Dean inhaled his food. "You starving or what?"
"Sleeping!" Cas said.  "I fell asleep on and he didn't want to wake me.  So when he went to lay down, we just kind of...
Cas's jaw dropped and his body froze for a moment as he tried to process this new feeling. Slowly, Dean withdrew and thrusted again, snapping Cas out of his stupor.
Cas made a mental note. "I'll take that as a 'yes'." He continued lavishing him with kisses, gently moving down his chest.
Dean took a shaky, deep breath. He had never been so nervous in his entire life.   He had a bit of experience with a few kinky people, but that was just fooling around.  While Cas was obviously down for fooling around, it was clear that he also needed much more than that.
"They aren't, and you know it," Gabriel shook his head.  "I went to school for this shit and your pies kick my ass.  You'll see, Dean... Hey, the wine is really perfect with this, isn't it?" he asked, taking a sip from his glass.
.  He closed his eyes as Cas came near, and the hot breath against his lips tentatively lingered for just a second before Cas drew him into a crushing kiss.
"Well, I think it's great that you tried it," Sam finally proclaimed. "Most people aren't that open-minded.  It's also kind of sexy."
Cas started kissing he way back up his chest.  "You can," he whispered, letting their lips meet again in a long, sensual caress.  "Let me take care of you, Dean. I promise it's going to feel good," he murmured, peppering his jaw with kisses.
Dean slumped down into the diner's cracked, worn seat, still tired and grumpy from being woken and yanked out of littlespace too quickly, and Cas immediately slid in to the spot next to him, comfortingly stroking his knee as Dean fidgeted on the bench.
Cas nodded, relieved that Gabe took the hint and changed the subject. "He usually calls before I go to bed. I'll ask him then."
Cas nodded, carefully adjusting Dean's arm that he was using for a pillow.  "Yeah.  I guess we are.  He drives me crazy with how overprotective he is sometimes, but he's my best friend.  I guess that's kind of sad," he laughed bitterly.
"Nope. Just you. Get in here." Dean extended his arm and Cas snuggled in, resting his head on his shoulder. "I missed you at the club this week," he whispered, nuzzling against Cas's cheek. "But, with the holidays, I have two weekends in a row off, so you'll have to find a way to keep me entertained," he said, resting his head on Cas's.
Cas smiled and shook his head.   "No thank you.  Eat up.  You're probably starving by now."  He poured himself a cup of coffee and watched in amusement as Dean loaded up his plate, drowning his food in sugary syrup and a massive amount of butter. "So you're okay?" he asked quietly.
After breakfast, lunch, and a heated discussion about whether Rancid or Bad Religion was the better band, Sam declared that he'd promised to meet up with a few friends before heading to the club tonight, so Cas and Dean were left alone again to spend the rest of their lazy afternoon together.
Besides, thanks to Dean, Cas would be in the city at his place this weekend, and that left him completely free of responsibility. He planned on taking full advantage of the night off too; he was getting laid tonight. Bela, his favorite casual hookup was in town, and it had been so long, he just hoped his dick remembered what to do.
Cas stifled a choked laugh.  "Alright. Zeppelin it is.  Now, once you put your hood on, no more talking. You are a pup. You belong to me. I will take care of all of your needs. All you need to do is relax and get into pupspace."
"Really, Dean, I'm thousands of years old.  I know more than you could possibly learn in a hundred lifetimes."
"No," Dean protested. "You'll be fine. You just gotta loosen up. Lean over the table more. Get your head down there and eye it up."
"Yeah.  Most of them are live sets.  I have an album in the works... Tentatively.  You'll see it if you scroll down.  But it's pretty rough right now.  It's not finished."
Cas was staring at him again, that slight, amused smile still gracing his lips. "Dean," he whispered in a low, gravelly voice.  He took a step forward, blue eyes locked on Dean's as he closed the short distance between the two of them.
Cas was panting hard from struggling, sweat creasing his brow as he turned his head away.  He could handle random strangers seeing him weak and exposed like this, but Dean?  The embarrassment was suddenly too much. Tears prickled at his eyes again, and he closed them, trying his best to chase them away.
"Uhh," Cas faltered.  He glanced down at himself, and grimaced as he realized he was still wearing the same clothes he wore yesterday.  He hadn't showered in two days, and he felt kind of gross.  "I'm okay, I guess."
He had just set the cat on the bed, and had begun changing into some comfy sleep clothes when he noticed the brown paper bag with a Post-it next to his pillow.  Frowning, he sat down, yanking the yellow sticky note from the package and reading it.
"Come on," he encouraged, patting the bed next to him.  Cas waddled around the side of the bed, and Dean couldn't help but grin as he watched.
Cas returned a few minutes later with a plate of cookies and a glass of milk, setting it on the table next to him.
"Whaaat?" Gabriel's golden-green eyes sparkled mischievously. "He's a popular guy!  I've been to a few of your parties, you know," he said, turning back to Dean.
Cas's tongue flicked over the head again, then he sucked, drawing another shivering moan out of Dean's mouth. He let his hands wander as he licked at him, massaging his hips and inner thighs before working a hand between his legs and fondling his balls.
Dean nodded and handed him a Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles coloring book, and Cas settled in next to him.
The drive to work was treacherous, at best.  Generally, Cas could make it there in about ten minutes, however, after white-knuckling the whiteouts and the icy roads, it was a forty minutes before the library finally came into view.  Crawling along at ten miles per hour, he pulled into a completely empty parking lot.
Dean gave a little wave as he watched Gabriel drive away.  He'd never understand why that tiny little man intimidated him so much.
As the audience stood for the final song, a sad, melancholy crowd favorite, Dean felt an arm slip around Cas's other shoulder.  He glanced over, angrily at first, but he quickly noted much of the front row had linked shoulders, singing and swaying in time with the music.   Worrying for a moment about how he would react, he pulled Cas a little closer, but Cas was so wrapped up in the music, he didn't even flinch.
"Nah. I'm gonna be on my knees a while anyway. Besides, I kind of like the feel of the collar. Hey, maybe we can use this with a leash. Or you can use it to restrain me somehow.  Oh, maybe we can use it in a kidnapping roleplay.  You can abduct me and make me your sex sl..."  Dean trailed off as he noticed the sparkling look of amusement in Cas's eyes.  "What?"
Sam nodded slowly.  He was four years old when Dean was eight.  It was entirely possible that he might feel he had to look after his baby brother, and that would ruin the point of giving him his childhood back.  Sam swallowed hard.  "What if... What if I just become the
Gabriel turned and cringed apologetically at him.  "I'm saying sometimes it's easy to take advantage of someone who's afraid to speak up.  I'm sorry.  I just worry about you."
"Have you heard of Butch Walker?  I think you'll really like him, since we have similar tastes and all."
"You should see what she did to mine," Hannah said, shaking her head.  "She's had me working my ass off on that after school program, and I haven't had time to organize my shelves in almost two weeks!  Still, I have an easy section! It's all unpopular stuff, so it's never a mess. What the fuck is her problem today anyway?"
Numbly, Cas nodded.  He'd been dealing with this shit long enough that he knew Gabe was right; the further he went down that depression spiral, the harder it would be to claw his way back.
"What about you?" Cas asked, after watching Sam tiredly hobble up to bed.   "You look tired too  Let's go upstairs.  You've been so exhausted lately... why don't you slip into your little clothes and..."
Cas glanced away as his face reddened even more. "Look, Dean, I just don't want to disappoint you. I'm not going to be good at it, and..."
"God you're cute.  And insatiable, apparently."  He locked the door behind them as they exited Gabriel's apartment and gave Cas's ass a little slap as he followed him up the stairs.  "Get up there then. Clothes off, collar on. I'll be in there in five.  Don't keep me waiting, Baby."
Cas just smiled and returned with a plate, which he set down in front of him.  "Would you like ketchup or barbecue sauce?"
Again Cas held Dean's lube-slick cock as he tried to ease down onto it, and he grimaced as the head pressed against him.
"W-what?" Cas stuttered.  Immediately he admonished his guilty conscience for making him act so neurotic.
Cas frowned and hurried off to the nonfiction section of books he was in charge of keeping neat and orderly.  Each of the clerks were assigned a section to look after, and Cas was meticulous about keeping his books in impeccable order.  He had just organized them before he left last night, so when he turned down his first aisle, the sight before him nearly took his breath away.  There, in each of his aisles, were random chunks of empty shelves with the books strewn in piles everywhere, as if someone had yanked the entire shelf onto the floor.
Cas glanced away and sighed, focusing his attention awkwardly at the floor, but he could still feel the weight of Gabriel's stare.
He leaned against the dingy tiled wall, green eyes narrowed in concentration as he waited patiently for his target to arrive.  This wasn't the ideal place for this to happen, but right now, he didn't have much choice.  He'd been standing there in the bathroom of his shitty motel room for twenty minutes now, and with each moment that passed, his resolve only intensified.
"Yeah." Dean grinned and touched a hand to his forehead in amusement. "You do. I meant... Nevermind... Do you wanna head back to the motel?" he asked, a bit self-consciously.
Raising his glass in tandem, Cas gave him a sloppy, gummy smile.   "Thank you," he said softly, feeling himself relaxing.  "How is it?" he asked, motioning to Dean's glass.
They continued polite conversation for a few more minutes, and just as Cas was afraid he'd run out of things to say, their food arrived.
"Hey, what are you..." Cas began, but he stopped in mid-sentence as Dean playfully shoved his mouth through the mask and began licking his face.
the next track.  But unfortunately, we'll have to listen to it later, because we're here," he said, pulling into the parking lot of a tiny restaurant Cas had never noticed before.  "I was going to take you to that Mexican place I was talking about, but it's always so loud," Dean apologized.  "I thought it would be easier to talk here.  Is Italian okay?"
"Awesome.  So I guess you're at home today?  I expected you to be at the library.  Figured I'd pick you up after work."
"Yeah, yeah.  He's fine. He just feels exhausted afterwards.  I made him go lie down and he was out like a light.  I'll let him know you called though."
Cas sighed and nervously drummed his fingers against the table as the waiter brought their wine.  "You might as well know, I guess.  I'm on sick leave for the next few months. Just this whole depression/anxiety thing."
A few hours, two movies, and several drinks later, and the party finally started winding down.  Cas had been dozing off and on for the last half of the movie, and Sam was sound asleep in his chair, so Gabriel flipped the television off.
, for God's sake!  For someone who's only been with one other person, you sure are a freak.  Seriously, lay off the weird sections of porn sites, huh?"
He shut the water off and stepped out of the shower, frowning at his wound and his solemn expression in the mirror.  After a quick towel-dry, he wrapped the towel around his waist and trudged slowly down the hall to his bedroom.
"I'm good," Cas sighed, snuggling up against Dean's chest. "I love that we're all together for Christmas, even if we all tease the shit out each other. I haven't laughed so hard in a long time. "
"I know baby.  But playtime is over for now."  He gently took the toy car from his hand.   "You need to be big so that you can drive us home in the real Impala.  Sam is waiting for us."
"Don't be.  So really, if you want to talk about it, I don't mind.  Otherwise... We have some wine," he smiled, raising his glass.
"That's better," Dean deftly ran the washcloth up and down each arm and leg.  "I'm gonna wash you here now, okay?" Dean gestured to his groin.
"Mmmhmm. Well you're not discouraging him either.  I'm starting to question everything after that confession earlier..."
"Oh!  Wha... Um, no, I um, just got back and told Cas I'd drop by..." Dean collected himself and stepped out of the vehicle, nervously rubbing the back of his neck.  He was trying desperately not to avert his guilty eyes.
"Well you can only rub so long with no lubrication before the friction starts to hurt," he said softly.  He used the pad of his thumb to softly stroke the head, delighting in the way Cas moaned and arched his back.  Dean subconsciously chewed his bottom lip and shifted as his pants suddenly felt a little tighter.   "So, if nothing else, at least spit in your hand from time to time to keep it a bit wet.  It'll reduce the friction.  Better yet," he let go for a moment to dig through his nightstand drawer and Cas let out a long whine.  "Shhh.   I'm not goin' anywhere.  Better yet,
Dean pointed to the nightstand drawer, and seconds later, he quivered as he felt a slick finger tracing around his entrance. "Ahh, shit.  On second thought, I don't know if I can do this," he suddenly blurted.
Though he had planned to send them off to bed soon, Cas couldn't help but let them play for a while.  He'd seen this side of Dean before, but he really hadn't expected to see it from Sam.  For as much as he insisted he didn't need this, he had certainly fallen into littlespace quickly.
Dean awoke early, eyes still closed but definitely awake.  Something was tickling his nose, and he reached forward to swat at it in annoyance.  As his hand touched something fuzzy, he immediately he realized it was just the bow from the teddy bear Cas had bought him. He grabbed the bear, adjusted it under his chin and hugged it, breathing in deeply as he inhaled Cas's scent. Sure, he'd usually feel embarrassed hugging a stupid bear, but the damn thing was really soft and comfortable.
"You okay?"  Once again, Dean's voice softened for just a minute as he checked Cas's facial expression in the mirror.
"Alright," Tom grumbled. "Fuck, I don't like this any more than you do, but they're my orders..." he picked up a red ribbon from the bedside table and knelt next to him on the bed.
Frustrated, Cas growled in response. "Maybe because you knocked me out with a spell, took away my powers, and tied me up?"
"Well, not like you can do anything just yet anyway," Dean laughed.  "You can't possibly be ready to..."  He stopped as Cas forcefully rutted against him, a rock-hard erection digging into his leg.  "Wow," he breathed.  "Guess I'm better than I thought.  You sure you can't stick around for another hour or so?"
Cas just smirked and lowered his cheek to the pillow, raising his ass in the air. He raised an eyebrow as if to challenge him, and Dean lunged forward with a wildly sexual growl.  Immediately, he was on top of him, kissing and sucking at his shoulder and neck.
Cas was staring like he was about to devour him in a slow, savoring way, and Dean couldn't stop the flush of pink rushing over his body.
He kicked his shoes off and shed his shirt, jeans, and socks, then clicked off the lamp before carefully crawling under the blanket and wrapping an arm around Cas's waist.
"Nothing really," Dean shook his head as he sat up.  "Just a bad day. Everything that could possibly go wrong did.  I think Sammy broke his shin too.  Nothing we're not used to, but I'm just... I'm not coping well tonight.  The stress of all of this gets to me sometimes, you know?"
Sorry, all.  I could not get this chapter to come together to save my life, so I stepped away from it for a while. Hopefully I'm back on track now.
Without a thought, Dean rushed to his closet, throwing on his knit shorts and a t-shirt with a cartoon kitty on it.  He'd never wear that damn cat shirt out of the bedroom, but it felt okay for littletime.
"Oh. Thanks. I didn't plan on putting one up. Gabe is such a dork. I went with him to pick out a tree, and next thing I know, he and the tree guy are trying to tie two trees to the top of his tiny-ass car," he laughed. "So we decorated his tree first, then we came down here and did mine too. It was actually kind of nice."
"I dunno. I think so," the man grumbled. He wiped away a spot of dried blood over Cas's eyebrow where he'd cut himself when he fainted. "Crouch down," he mumbled, gripping his hair and shoving Cas's head under the shower spray. When his head was wet enough, Johnny grabbed the shampoo bottle and began working it into his scalp until his head was covered in a white lather. "Rinse," he commanded, and Cas stuck his head back under the spray. "Good enough. Let's go," Johnny barked, tugging at the leash. Cas followed him out, where Tom began drying him down with a soft towel.
Dean's face twisted in disgust as he stared skeptically at Cas.  "I've watched a lot of porn in my lifetime, but you're into some weird, kinky stuff!"
skinny jeans," Gabe laughed. "They're slim fit. And they're actually very in style right now. Same with that dark, worn-looking denim. Give me a little turn," he motioned.
nervous, he wasn't even thinking about that yet.  Right now he was too busy imagining all the possible worst case scenarios of where they could be going and what could go wrong. The unknown was the worst.  He could handle
"Good boy," Dean murmured. "Don't you ever think that I don't want you, Castiel Novak. If I haven't made that clear yet, I obviously need to work harder."
"Why? I've wanted you for so fucking long," he mumbled before dipping back down to swirl his tongue around the head.  "I want you to cum for me," he rasped.  The debauched whimpering already coming from Cas's lips was driving Dean insane, and all he wanted to do was make Cas feel better in every possible way.  He let the moaning and grunting noises urge him on, sucking and licking and working him with his hand until Cas's entire body spasmed.
"Dean," he whimpered helplessly. So many emotions and physical sensations were overwhelming him, and he was feeling a bit desperate.
Tom sighed dramatically and began walking a little faster. "Could be worse. Like I said, let's just get it over with," he grumbled. He paused abruptly at the next door and opened it, then shoved Castiel in ahead of him.
"Dean?" he croaked, his body suddenly buckling and going limp against the table as Dean gently sucked a spot on his neck. "What are you doing?"
"I get to rub our naked legs together... And you get to be almost naked, so It'll totally help you get past that fear," he said as solemnly as possible while biting back his laughter.
He could feel tears prickling his eyes at the sheer embarrassment, and he tried determinedly to blink them away.
"Don't swa... Oh! Oh! Oh my god! Fuck! Yes! Oh, oh, oh, oh! Dean!" Cas sobbed as he came hard, right into Dean's hot, eager mouth.
"Cas and I both have a spare room.  Why don't you crash with one of us?  You had a few drinks and I don't want you driving."
"I'm gonna miss these beautiful legs," he murmured, sliding his hands up her calves for a moment before picking up the satiny red panties and slipping them over one ankle.  He picked up her other foot and threaded it through the panties and began sliding them up, but as he got to her knees, he paused.  Placing her legs over his shoulder, he knelt and hiked her skirt up once more, then slid the panties up onto her hips.  With a sly grin, he spread her legs and leaned forward, pressing a gentle kiss to the red satin as she squirmed with arousal.
"I don't know," Cas shrugged. "The fact that we're not wearing pants, I guess..." he laughed nervously.
"Shhh.  You did good, baby," he whispered, giving his spent cock a little kiss before moving back up next to him and wrapping his still-trembling body in his arms. "Hey.  Why are you crying?" he suddenly asked in panic. "Oh fuck, did I go too far...?"
"Good," Cas breathed. His tongue circled a few more times and then pressed into him and Dean yelped in surprise.
Dean nodded slowly.  "I guess that would be okay. "  The butterflies in his stomach were fluttering faster now and he had the fleeting urge to bolt.  He and Cas hadn't been
Before Cas had even finished clearing off the table, Dean had made his way over to the toy pile.   It wasn't like he wanted to play with kid toys or anything.
"Cas," Dean started.  "I told you, we don't have to.  This is pretty nice just sitting here with you."
Cas took a deep breath and nodded.  Dr. Mitchell always knew the right things to say when he was feeling sorry for himself.
"Hey.  Forget it," Dean interrupted.  "Let's be honest, I'm pretty much giving you the world's worst handjob right now," he laughed nervously.  "It's no big deal.  Just let me get this off you, okay?"
"You ready, Dean?"   A tall, lanky figure with a clipboard and headset stuck his head into the booth, shaking his concentration.
"We're going to go make that supply run whenever Dee's ready," Cas said.  "Do you want to come with us?"
"Whoa, whoa.   Hey, it's alright," Dean soothed as Cas burrowed into his shoulder. "It's just a noise."
He remembered when his mom had first taken off work for her clinical depression.  He remembered how her usually cheerful disposition slowly changed into an empty numbness.  In the end, she didn't survive her illness.  Dean was 15 when he found her unresponsive with an empty pill bottle in her hand, and he had never been quite the same.
"So you haven't...?" Dean paused.  "Huh." He didn't bother finishing his sentence as he saw Cas cringe in abject terror.  "Well I think you're okay to get up," he said, changing the subject.  "Slowly, though."
"Well," Dean said, utterly amused by Cas's drunken confession, "I'll protect you from the furnace. "
"Not unless you want it to be.  Don't you think I'd tell you if it was?  And it's not weird, just stop that."
to..."  He sighed, trying to unravel the thoughts in his head.  "It was just like...  I don't know, a flashback?  It just
"It's okay.  I'm just being stupid." Cas stepped up into the cab and seated himself and Dean closed the door behind him.
With shaky hands, Cas tore open the packet and removed the condom, not entirely sure what he was doing, but he had a good idea.
Dean laughed.  "Yeah, pretty much.  I have a studio set up in my house.  It's kind of hard to explain without showing you.  It's a lot more intense than most people realize.  I have six different software programs where I create beats and full tracks.  Each separate beat, each instrument, each hand clap, whatever is added in until I have something cohesive. Sometimes it'll be completely my own creation, sometimes something to complement someone else's song, depending if it's for me, or when I'm playing at the club.  Then I hook my laptop or computer to my controller... I have three hookups, so I can hook up a turntable, CD, my iPod, whatever for mixing too.  And then it's a whole lot of layering. Taking two or three tracks and mixing them, making the beats match, fading one track in or out, fading the volume in or out, adding or removing filters for each track, adding a few beats on the fly, messing with the EQ to even it all out, tone matching... Then I have the studio mixing and mastering for the CD.  I know, it all just sounds like a bunch of jargon, but you'd get it if I showed you."
Dean cleared his throat and took a big step back "Okay, just pull back like that, and when you shoot, accelerate as you get closer to the ball."
here and there, but I'm not going to coax you into anything you're not ready for.  So if you want to, you need to tell me."
"You sound just like Cassie! Well I own a bakery in the city, and I look after Cas," he winked. "Outside of that, I guess I'm your complete opposite. I'm a social butterfly. I like to go out, meet people. I work out a little, but I
"Oh god," Cas gasped, heading for a stall. He had no idea what the hell he had just swallowed, but maybe he could force himself to throw it up. He'd always had a strange fear of vomiting, but the sense of panic he was feeling right now seemed to override that. After desperately choking and gagging over a toilet for a good fifteen minutes, it was obvious nothing was happening.
Dr. Mitchell's eyes widened just a bit as she stared at him.   "Wow.  That's great. You had relegated yourself to never dating last time we talked, I believe."
"Hey, Cas," Dean's voice echoed through the phone as Cas lay in bed, nervously picking at his bedspread.
Dean grunted and sped up slightly, making Cas wail and hang his head as he tried to regain his composure.
Dean spun around to see Cas standing behind him in his usual suit and trench coat.  He was looking slightly disheveled, as if he had hurried in getting there.  Dean grinned and hit 'end' on his phone, then tossed it over his head where it landed in his laundry basket.
"Such a good dog." Cas gave him a scratch on the head, just behind his puppy ears, then smoothed his hand from his head, all the way down his spine.
"It's a good thing that he got another room too.  Because in another twenty minutes or so, I'll be ready for round two."
"Trust me.  It's not pleasant," Dean grimaced.  "Just... slow your roll there.  Let the alcohol catch up to you."
Cas grinned and closed his eyes again, thankful that his brother was pretty awesome, even if he was a total pain in the ass sometimes.
"A little. I'm feeling much braver lately though. I think we'll probably uh... Um..." He rubbed the back of his neck nervously.
Cas sighed.  "No, he's not pressuring me. He's been really understanding, actually.  I mean, he gives me a little push sometimes but in a good way. And never too much.  He's..." he sighed. "He's been really good to me. And this has all been good
Dean chuckled and shot him a little wink. "I'll teach you a bit if you want. But right now, I guess we should head out," he said, his smile quickly turning to a grimace.
"I'm sorry!  I'm just glad that he's not pressuring you, that's all. At least, I assume, since you haven't done it yet."
Cas slouched forward, drowning his waffles and his sorrows in Nutella.  "Such a ballbuster," he grumbled.
"Oh," Cas muttered.  "Yeah.  I'm okay.  Thanks. Wow, it's loud there.  I guess you're still at the club?"
Almost immediately, Dean felt his entire demeanor change.  He was already slipping into subspace, too relaxed to argue with Cas's gentle praise.
Gabriel chuckled quietly.  "Alright, baby bro.  But I'm always around if you need to, okay?  Call me later.  Thanks for the pie."
Dean took a step back and unzipped his own jeans, tugging and letting them pool on the floor at his feet, then he slipped his cock out the front of his boxers.  "You said you want me.  So show me how much," he whispered sternly as he gave himself a few gentle strokes.  "On your knees."
Cas blushed.  "You also keep calling me your baby, and telling me 'good boy' like I'm a dog or something."
Nate frowned as he considered his schedule.  "Not much. I've got a gig at this place in the Village a few weekends a month.  I'm off Saturday, but I think I'm booked the next three or four weeks after that."
"Cas?"  Dean flopped down on his bed, not even bothering to slip into his clothes before calling out for his trenchcoat-clad safety blanket.
him in every possible way.  As he quieted, Dean removed his hand again and reached around to start stroking him.  A minute or two was all it took before Cas yelled out in pure, unadulterated ecstasy, a few octaves higher than his usual gravelly voice.
should be fun!  I'm sorry you were made to feel guilty about it. Do you still feel guilty when you jerk off now?"
Dee entered the room first, with Sammy, suddenly shy again, in tow.  Cas could tell he wasn't quite as immersed as he had been when he was downstairs, but he was hoping a little quiet time might help him relax.  "Pick a book and come on," Cas coaxed, patting the bed to either side of him.  While Dee grinned and launched himself forward, leaping into Cas's arms, Sam tread warily to the other side and perched on the edge of the mattress.
"Good. It's not exactly the Italian food place I took you to, but you need the full New York experience."
Cas thought for a long minute before he finally answered.  "No," he murmured blissfully.  "I feel good. I  feel...
Castiel looked down at his boy, curled up on the couch and lightly snoring with his head on his lap.  He loved the moments like this - Dean was so content and comfortable, he was practically purring in his sleep, and it gave Cas a deep sense of peace just watching him.
"Both," he said, and Cas happily hummed as he brought him the condiments, along with a straw cup full of apple juice.
Cas frowned. "I'm only suggesting it because I think it might help you sort through some of your issues.  You have so many unresolved issues when it comes to your father that..."
"Shit," he muttered.  He was already feeling a little lightheaded and dizzy which didn't bode well, and he pondered whether or not he'd taken his pill the last few days. After nearly a decade of taking medication to keep himself stable, you'd think he'd be better at remembering to take his meds, but if it weren't for Gabriel's constant hounding, he'd forget half the time. He took another deep breath and turned back toward Dean.
"Dean," Cas squeaked, his eyes welling up with tears. "Ohh!" He jerked forward, falling back to his hands and knees as a little wave of tremors rippled through him, and Dean took the hint to thrust faster.
"Uhhh. It's a long story," Cas said, setting Scout on the floor. "I'll tell you over dinner. I'm just gonna use the bathroom first."
"Good boy," Dean crooned again.  "Now stay still for me." He removed his towel and tossed it behind him, and he hummed softly as he stroked Cas's cheek.  "Holy shit, I never thought I'd see this..." he mused quietly, gripping himself as he raised Cas's trembling chin.  "Open."
Cas giggled and covered his face.  "Maybe you should have just done it the first time I asked, and then I wouldn't have had to taunt you," he said coyly.
Dean covered his mouth as he laughed, nearly choking on the cookie he'd just bit into. "Whoa. Sassy Cas is my new favorite thing," he chortled as he swallowed. "Maybe Gabe was right about you being a smartass!"
"Sure," Dean said. He couldn't help but laugh at Cas's gleeful expression. "Let's try that one." Cas nodded and got into position and Dean slid in behind him again. "Yeah, that's much better. You got this one," Dean breathed, dangerously close to Cas's ear. He might have imagined it, but he thought he saw Cas's eyes briefly flutter closed.
, he was doing me a favor. As if I'd just fuck you senseless against your will or something," he huffed angrily.  "Look, I have a lock pick kit in the car, I'll be right back, okay?"
"I see that, you know.  You get off on being told you're good," Dean grinned.  "Baby has a little praise kink."
"Oh we'll make it work. God, you look so good right now," Dean breathed. He helped maneuver Cas onto his back, and pulled his boxers off in one quick movement.
"Late night booty call?"  Gabriel was leaning on his car with his arms folded, leering expectantly at him.
He put his head down and sniffled as his nose began to run. All he wanted to do was curl up in a ball and sleep. He had come to enjoy sleep from his brief time being human, and lately it was the only thing he took pleasure in.  Everything was so tiresome, even standing in the shower, so he sat on the floor and drew his knees to his chest, letting the warm water pound down around him.  He sat there silently crying for what felt like ages until a soft voice startled him.
," Cas stuttered.  "Well, no, but..." He was glad the lights were out to hide the constant reddening of his cheeks this time. He didn't think he could Dean in the eyes right now anyway.
"Alright.   Scoot over, Bumblebee."  Cas climbed back into bed and handed him his treats.  Though his eyes were red-ringed and puffy, the tears had stopped, and Cas couldn't help but notice how vulnerable he looked.  He looked even younger tonight, and it made him want to hold him tightly and never let go.  Instead, he smiled warmly and ruffled Dean's hair, then drew an arm around his shoulder.  "I love you, you know."
"Mmmm.  You have no idea how much I wanted to do this while I was away," Dean hummed against his ear, and Cas shivered excitedly.   He pulled away, giving Cas a soft kiss on the cheek.  "So.  How are you feeling today?"
When Cas's tongue gently began prodding at his lips, he opened them, allowing Cas to dominate his mouth with tiny, teasing little kitten licks. Just as he started relaxing into it, Cas moved away, trailing sucking little kisses across his jaw and down his neck.
"Yeah.  Of course," Dean agreed.  "We'll eat in the van.  It's probably better that we get on the road anyway. It's already getting late and the weather is supposed to turn shitty."
"Cas," he started.  "I'm not saying its gonna happen, but hypothetically, do you uh... how do you need to be controlled? "
"Fuck," he sighed.  "I give up. Welcome to the family, you bastard.  I have to go get us some dessert or something.  Someone's chopping onions in here..." He stood abruptly and headed back to the kitchen.
"Yeah,  Joe," Dean said, putting his earpiece in. They're getting restless out there, so I'm going to play a little music. Just give me the cue when they're ready to start."
"You just want to stay here on the couch cuddling with me all day," Dean teased as he entwined their legs together.
Gabriel sighed and took a deep breath, a look of relief slowly spreading across his face. "That's it? A
"Stop putting yourself down," Gabe interrupted, and Cas flushed a bit as he was reminded for the second time this week.  "You're the kindest, most caring person I know.  And there are a million awesome things about you and you know it.  Obviously, because he's already asked you out again."
"You are so sweet and selfless..." Cas whispered, his warm breath tickling Dean's ear and making him shudder.
Before they could even step through the door, Cas sprung into action, tearing at Dean's bloody shirt as he tried to examine him for injuries.  "What happened?   Why didn't you call me?"  He raised two fingers and touched them to Dean's forehead, and the room lit up with a flash of white light.
Dean closed his eyes again, leaning into Cas a little to get more comfortable.  His heart rate was finally slowing down, though he wasn't sure why it had been racing to begin with.
Dean could feel his face reddening.  He had never been good at complements or chick flick moments, so he just smiled and handed Cas his coat. "Come on," he said, tugging his jacket  on.  "Are you as hungry as I am?"
Dean held up a finger as he drained the last of his beer, then slammed the bottle down. "C'mon," he said, standing up and heading to the nearest empty pool table. "Grab a cue," he said as he began to rack.
sometimes," he snickered, causing Cas to burst out laughing. "But I'm fine. Hell, I'm into edging anyway," he winked.  "When you feel comfortable, we'll get to the sex-thing."
Forty minutes passed, with Cas doing nothing but exhausting himself.  And just when he thought things couldn't get worse, the door opened again.
"Gum," Sam said, handing him a pack of grape flavored bubble gum. "You're grinding your teeth. Chew it," Sam instructed as he glanced at his phone. "Dean will be here in a minute."
"Nope," Dean shrugged.  "We're going into the city though, so settle in.  Why don't you control the music for us?  If you hit this button," he said, pressing a button on the stereo, "I have a huge memory card full of albums on there.  Go nuts."
"Are you all embarrassed again?  What are you apologizing for?  Cumming?  Don't you dare apologize for that!" Dean laughed.  "You're so damn innocent... I'm going to feel
Moments later, Dean was happily picking at his cheeseburger while Cas sipped coffee in the bright yellow booth next to him.
It wasn't long before a few loud knocks on the door jostled them from their blissful moment, and Sam's voice suddenly called out from the hallway.
get that way when you talk about music too.  I'd love for you to come.  Any time you're ready, you just let me know.  You can hang out in the booth with me.  Then you won't have to deal with the crowd so much."
Dean pulled him in close to his side, resting Cas's head on his chest. "Shhh.  This is it.  Right here," he whispered.  "This is all we're doing.  So relax, okay?"  He began gently scrubbing little circles against Cas's scalp.  "Deep breath," he said quietly as he heard Cas's breath catch in his throat.  "Good.  Now here's the remote," he said with a smile, handing him the remote control from the side table.  "Find us something to watch."
"Good. I know you're still having some rough patches, but I can tell you've been improving lately... Of course, you could just be all lovesick and shit.
"Whatever," Tom knelt and began removing Cas's shoes and socks, to little resistance. "Alright. You can behave and I can remove the cuffs to get your coat and shirt off, or you can be a dick and I'll just cut them off. Your choice. Cuffs off?" he asked as he stood.
When he saw the wistful way Cas had mentioned it, he just couldn't help himself - and seeing him turn into a carefree six-year-old for just a while had been totally worth it.   It was funny to see how shy he became again afterward.
.  He'd pissed her off again and that stupid witch had tried to hit him with a spell, but Cas jumped in front of him.  He watched in horror as the angel crumpled to the ground, bloodied, broken, and unresponsive.
Cas groaned and covered his face with his hand. "No.  No, I liked it. I'm surprised at how much I liked it, actually. I just..." he sighed. "I don't know what happened."
"What?  Oh. Uhh.  What do you m... Ohhh!" he suddenly yelped, his legs twitching in surprise.  "K-keep doing that," he whimpered.
.  Dean wasn't typically a snuggler, but damn if he didn't want to just cuddle him to death. Of course, another part of him wanted to pin him down and give him a good and proper fucking, but for right now, that was neither here nor there.
him.   He had no idea how he'd managed to roll over in the tight quarters, but all he wanted to do was lie there, reveling in how safe and warm he felt.  It seemed silly at his age, but he'd never been
"So get this," Sam greeted them.  "Apparently someone violently died in the house we're headed to. It
Grunting and growling each time Cas moaned, he sped up, working him faster with both his fist and his mouth, making Cas's entire body jerk and thrash as his hands desperately gripped the sheets.
"Let me take care of you," Cas whispered as he used his thumbs to wipe away the stray tears.  "Come on.  No more tears, Little One," he said as he coaxed him to a sitting position. "I bought some new DVDs.  Why don't we watch Bugs Bunny?"
"Drawer." Cas crawled to the edge of the bed and dug through his nightstand for a condom, and held it up triumphantly as he crawled back toward Dean.
"Awesome," Dean murmured, tossing Cas's boxers at him. "Of course, we didn't do a very good job at hustling pool tonight, did we?"
"Ohhh," Cas squeaked, his breath catching in his throat.  He had no idea why that turned him on so much, but it did.  Dean sucked a little harder at his neck and Cas moaned loudly.  For a brief moment, he worried that it might leave a mark, but since he wasn't exactly around people lately, he supposed it didn't matter.
"You look absolutely delicious all tied up there," Dean whispered, licking his lips. "But let's see if we can make you taste even better..." He picked up the container on the nightstand and opened it, grinning as he watched Cas's face suddenly register what he was about to do.
Dean just grinned and nibbled at his shoulder.  "Mmm.  Love it when baby gets demanding... One of these days, you're going to tie me up and have your way with
"It's almost over," Dean greeted them sullenly. He was sitting on the floor in front of the coffee table, mindlessly rolling his car back and forth.
"I'm fine!"  Dean started pumping faster as he heard Sam walk away, and he fought back a groan as he stared down at Cas in awe.  The angel's red-ringed watery eyes were clouded over by lust, and his usually pale, spit-slicked lips were pink from the friction. His hair was sticking up every which way from being grabbed at, and he looked so ridiculously debauched that Dean suddenly couldn't take it anymore.  He took a step back as he tugged at Cas's hair, effectively pulling him away.
"I think so," Cas nodded determinedly, downing the rest of his drink. He was going to do this one way or another, even though he could already feel his heart pounding way faster than it should be. He turned away and took a long, deep breath.
Cas tried, but he couldn't hide the smile this time. "Oh, " he squeaked. "That would be..." he stopped abruptly as he looked up to see Gabriel grinning like a lunatic.  He cleared his throat and pulled his blanket up over his head, and Gabe took the hint to leave the room for a few minutes.  "That would be nice," he finished quietly.
Cas sighed.  "Trust me, Dean.  It'll be good for you.  Look, we're going to do this just like when we roleplay, okay?  Give me a safeword.  If things get too overwhelming for you, you can safeword."
"Well I should be able to leave early if we need to," Dean assured him. "And if it gets bad, Sammy can escort you outside for some air, okay? Just tell one of us."
Crowley frowned. "Well, whether I like it or not, I owe the damn Squirrel a favor. And how does one pay back a Winchester? They're not like normal humans that you can bribe with promises of fame and fortune. So I started thinking... 'What does
Dean thought back to the well-behaved golden retriever patiently waiting outside for it's owner to return.  "Well, I guess you can never be too cautious," he said slowly, "but that dog was pretty friendly."
Sam grinned.   "Why not? He's clearly into you.  You can't tell me you haven't noticed!   The way he follows you around, the way he's always touching you.  And Jesus, the way he looks at you! "
"You're so good at coloring, Dee. Look at how well you stay inside the lines!  I'm going to hang your picture on the refrigerator when you're done," Cas beamed.
Hesitantly, he placed the car on the ground again and wheeled it forward, then  picked up another with his free hand and made them crash.   Before he knew it, he was wheeling cars around imaginary streets, making engine noises and squealing tire sounds, and he was rather disappointed when Cas told him it was time to put them away.
"Of course."  Cas headed inside to get ready for work, checking the phone for messages along the way.  Seeing as the machine was still empty, he headed off to the shower.
"I didn't know what to get, so I just got the family pack," Dean said.  "Twelve tacos.  Hope you like a challenge."
, not him.    Dean had made sacrifices all his life for him, and right now, he was going to do his best to repay him.  Yes, he decided.   He could do this.
"I don't know. I get freaked out at the thought of anyone seeing me naked.  Or even shirtless. It's stupid, I know.  And being...
"Oh right. It comes with skate rentals," Dean murmured.  "Uh, ten," he nodded to the young man with chin-length blonde hair.
working, he lived paycheck to paycheck on his paltry library clerk's wage.  It gave him a bit of a complex if he thought about how much more worldly and sophisticated Dean was.  He knew Dean was way out of his league, but if he dwelled on it too much, the depression would drag him down, so he did his best not to think about it.
"'kay," Cas said tiredly.  Whether it was the warm blanket, the heavy dinner, or just the exhaustion of depression, he could barely keep his eyes open.
Gabriel shrugged.  "You just got permission to lie in bed and jerk off.  Don't look a gift horse in the mouth.  You coming upstairs, or do you want to start on your...
Dean froze for a moment, looking cautiously back and forth between Sam and Cas.  "...Good," he finally mumbled.
psycho, we got hammered and uh... It just kind of came out one night.  But I would never... not like
"C'mere," he purred, grabbing  Cas's arm and pulling him in close.  "You know what I want to do to you?" he whispered seductively as he began sucking and nibbling at the side of Cas's neck.
With a wave of Crowley's hand, the gag was back in his mouth, and Cas was left alone to tug futilely against his restraints. He was feeling a bit frantic without his power, and all he could think about was getting free. Confusion was clouding his judgement, and though he still had no idea what Crowley was planning, he knew he needed to get out as soon as possible.
He shot her his best smirk and gently shoved her back against the car door, then grabbed her ankles and straightened her legs as she giggled.
"Alright," Cas agreed, knowing full-well that when Gabe was in his protective big brother mode, there was no use resisting.  Somewhat reluctantly, he followed him up the stairs.
"Mmmhmm," Dean purred, rubbing his cheek against Cas's shoulder. "That's because you have a big, fat dick up your ass, baby. It'll get better. Promise. Come kiss me."
"Okay," he whispered to his reflection in the mirror. "You can do this." Slowly, he began pulling on the slim-fitting jeans and Gabriel's borrowed shirt. They still felt weird, and if Dean hadn't acted so enamored yesterday, he probably would have just cancelled rather than wear them. He stared at his torso as he buttoned up, wondering if he'd lost a little weight or if he'd just been overly critical before, because right now, he didn't look half bad. Sure, he could pinch an inch here or there, but overall, he was in pretty decent shape. For a brief moment, he didn't hate looking at his body, and that hadn't happened in a long time.
Dean moaned, the visual of Cas with his lips wrapped around his cock was almost enough to make him cum right there.  "That's better.  You're good with your mouth, " Dean panted.  "Can you take it all?"
"Caaas," Dean protested tiredly.  He was utterly fucked out, but that didn't stop him from groaning as Cas continued to call him all these things he wasn't.  He struggled, still a bit breathlessly, to sit up.  "Alright.  Your turn.  You wanted to know what does it for you," he said, pushing Cas flat onto his back.   "Oh!" he gasped as he noted that Cas had obviously already come.
Dean took a deep breath and closed his eyes.   "It's just not something you talk about with people."
Since Sam was at a loss for words, they finished their breakfast in an awkward silence.  He felt weird, and uncomfortable, and just a tad freaked out.  He'd spent his entire life looking up to Dean, the stoic big brother who rarely showed signs of weakness. It suddenly reminded him that underneath the tough exterior, Dean was always just a scared kid too -  a kid that had to grow up way too fast.  While other kids were laughing and playing hide and seek, he was busy cooking dinner and protecting his baby brother from monsters.
Dean took a deep breath and slowly let his body go slack as Cas paused so that he could get used to the new sensation.
Dean moaned in his sleep, and Cas smiled faintly as he suddenly noticed the Impala Matchbox car clenched in a loose fist.   He actually
Sam nodded knowingly as the pieces finally starting to click into place. "Yeaaah. Cas, can you come with me to the bar?"
Cas stared in awe as he walked away, trying to pick his jaw up off the ground.  The click of the bathroom door closing made him snap out of his stupor, and suddenly, he found himself dashing toward the bedroom.  He had no idea what Dean had in mind, but his dick was obviously interested.
They were alone in the bunker today; Sam had gone out a few hours earlier to hit the library and Dean was in full-blown littlespace when he fell asleep listening to Cas tell a story. It was getting much easier for him to slip into this mindset lately, however he still had a bit of trouble snapping out of it.
"Dean." Cas was at his side in a second. "It's not a big deal.  Look, I'll talk to Sam. I'll straighten everything out.  He's not going to think any less of you."
about this shit?"  Even though Sam had gone into town to do some grocery shopping, he nervously glanced around the library, just in case anyone had heard.
Cas relaxed and melted into him, letting out a happy little swooning noise that seemed to surprise even himself.
"Hey, I don't mean to interrupt, but I'm bringing the food over," Gabriel interjected. "Have a seat. We'll talk while we eat."
"I guess I need to call him," Cas groaned.  "He had planned to pick me up at the library.  It's so bad outside, I should call it off.  I wish I had given him
Dean chuckled softly.  "A cock cage?    It's uh... a chastity device." He grinned at the traumatized look on Cas's face.
being rewarded when you're good.  Of course, judging by how much you liked me slapping your ass during sex, you might enjoy the punishment too."
"Well hey, would anyone like more food?" Gabe asked after swallowing his last bite.  "There's lots left."
he mimicked."Fuck's sake, Cas! I knew there was a bad boy in there somewhere, but you damn near killed me talking like that."
Gabriel squinted menacingly at him as he shook his hand.  "Mmmhmm.  I know who you are.  Enjoy your little slumber party last night?  Tell me, Dean.  What exactly are your intentions with my brother?"
, yes. I mean... uh," he quickly stopped himself and laughed.  "I mean if you were into it, I would be too... Mmmm. You can pretty much do whatever you want to me, you know," he winked. "Tie me up, spank me, lock me in the cock cage and tease me... "
"Shhhh," Dean laughed, wiping blueberry off his face. "I'll get there soon enough..."  He crawled around to settle in the space between Cas's legs and began licking down the sticky purple trail inside of his thighs.
"Come here, " Dean said sternly. "On my lap. Facing me," he explained when Cas frowned in confusion.
"I was having a bad panic attack. And he he brought me home," Cas reminded him.  Dean squeezed his knee thankfully and stuffed a forkful of meatball into his mouth in an attempt to collect himself.
"Aw shit.  Sorry," Dean grimaced.   "I forgot we said we were going to do that. You could have waited for me though."  He turned the Impala onto the main road in search of the nearest diner.
"I love you too, sweetheart. You're doing so well," Dean crooned. "I know it's hard at first. Is it getting better?"
Gabriel just snickered and rolled his eyes. "You know, right now it's still cute, but eventually I'm gonna have to kick your asses if you don't stop acting so damn sweet.  I'm going to lose my damn appetite." He picked up the remote control and turned on the TV, and flipped until he found a Christmas movie.  "Hey, my favorite!" he exclaimed.
Cas didn't even turn around, instead just flipping the middle finger over his head as he walked away.
The club was filling up faster now, and Dean put on some background music as they waited for the party to start.
Cas nodded weakly, burrowing his face into Dean's shoulder.  "I know you wouldn't. I trust you, Dean. This whole guilt-thing is just so stupid," he groaned.  "I mean, we've done everything
"Come on," the tall man demanded, tugging hard at the leash and causing him to choke, red-faced and drooling around his gag. They lead him down a never-ending hallway, past several doors and windows, and Cas couldn't help but wonder where, exactly, he was. It wasn't Hell, at least, and he was thankful for that.
"Shhhhh.  Come here." He grabbed Cas's hand and yanked him forward until they were standing face-to-face, just inches apart.  "I am going to get you some blinders," he teased, cupping both sides of his face so that he couldn't see around them.  "That way, you can only look straight ahead."
He could hear a voice faintly calling to him.  Everything sounded like he was under water - muffled and distorted, and difficult to understand.
"Stubborn bastard," Gabriel shook his head. "Fine. Dean and Cas, go relax in the living room. Sam and I will bring dessert in a few minutes."
"Deeean!" Cas's panicked voice startled him and he jumped at the shadow in the doorway.   He sat up and squinted hard, only to see Cas standing there completely naked, save for a pair of boxer briefs pulled down around his thighs.
Dean smiled and led him by the hand back into the living room.  "Sit," he demanded. Once again, Cas took his seat at the furthest end of the couch, and Dean sat opposite him, a few feet of space separating them.  They settled into watching the movie again, and a half hour passed with neither of them saying a word, despite the palpable tension between them.
done that, aside from maybe while giving noogies as a kid.  This had only happened a few times since he found out, and he was surprised at how easily he'd been able to accept this arrangement. It still felt strange, but he had to admit, Dean was definitely benefiting from this.  If this made his brother happy, then he could manage.   To be honest, he kind of liked taking care of him.  Dean was never the type to admit when he needed help, so it was kind of refreshing for a change.  He still acted jumpy and skittish whenever Sam was around, but slowly, he seemed to be getting better.
"No, it wasn't Dean! God! Some guy in the restroom. I'm so freakin' naive I thought it was a mint at first. How stupid is that? Anyway, he kinda shoved it in my mouth and somehow I swallowed it before I even realized what had happened."
anxiety. Well, hey. What's Dean doing for Christmas? You should invite him over. I'll cook a big dinner, we'll exchange gifts, it'll be nice."
Dean paused and frowned.  "It shouldn't hurt that much, baby. Might hurt a little at first, but..." He backed away and grabbed the wet towel from the floor and wiped the lube from his hands.  "I'm gonna untie you now," he said softly.
Dean nodded. "...That looks so good on you," he breathed, running a finger over the front of the collar. "Do you like it?"
It had been well over a year since he'd had a bad depression day like this, and for a brief moment, he hoped this wasn't indicative of more to come.  As usual, there was no good reason for it.  Aside from his anxiety worsening as well, his life seemed pretty decent overall.  He paid off his car two months ago, so he had a bit more expendable income than usual.  Gabriel had recently given him a rescue cat named Scout, and despite insisting he didn't want a pet, the fuzzy little bastard had weaseled his way into his heart.  Having a pet around was surprisingly calming; it was nice to have 'company' around the house, and petting the cat often helped quell his anxiety.  He had a great job that he loved, and despite having a horrible boss, she wasn't any worse than usual.  And... Dean had called him to ask him out next Friday.   While he was nervous about that, he was also extremely giddy.  He had no good reason to be feeling bad, but clinical depression was a bitch sometimes.
"Dean," he whimpered, feeling embarrassingly close to losing control as Dean's lips worked their way down his stomach again.  "No, Dean, I'm going to...Ohhhh."
"You work today?" a voice called out from behind him. He turned around to see Gabriel walking toward him in a full-blown snow suit with a shovel in hand.
He smiled wistfully, once again proud of how far Cas had come in a relatively short time. Certainly his meds were helping, but it was also Cas's determination to do the things he wanted to do, anxiety be damned.
"No!  You can't.  I mean... I'll call you if I need you, okay?  He said come alone, and I-I gotta go."
"That was lovely, Dean.  You're absolutely breathtaking like this," he murmured as he delicately ran his fingers through Dean's sweat-slicked hair.
"See?" Gabe grinned. "Look, it's perfect. It's practically tailored to your body!" he exclaimed, pointing to the mirror.
"Well, I like it," Cas said.  "It's not what I usually listen to, but it's really catchy.  It's happier music than I usually listen to," he laughed.  "I didn't expect the vocal track, which I really like too."
"Good. Come here." Dean rolled onto his back and coaxed Cas's head onto his shoulder. "No guilt, baby," he whispered, slowly carding his fingers through Cas's hair. "You're not bad or dirty.  You're totally normal."
Cas was panting hard, and he was confused as hell. Earlier in the evening he was sure he wasn't ready for anything sexual, but right now it was all he could think about.  Okay, it still made him anxious, but he was so damn horny, he couldn't think straight.
"Yep. He's a little nervous though. I promised him Gabriel's cooking was worth it," he laughed. "He is easily tempted by food, even though he's a health nut. I wish I had his metabolism. Kid eats non-stop. I suppose it takes a lot of fuel to be a giant moose-man."
A few strokes was all it took for Cas to lose control, and his body spasmed as he came violently onto his sheets. He collapsed face-first onto the mattress and Dean lowered himself to continue thrusting, kissing his shoulders and pinning his arms above his head as he finished.
Dean watched him for a moment, intently trying to read Cas's mind. "Cas? Sweetheart?  You can do whatever you want. But don't feel like you have to. I'm fine, really."
Well what happened to Mom was sure as hell not going to happen to Cas.  Even if this whole dating thing had to be put on the back burner while he worked on his recovery, he was going to be there. He already liked the guy too damn much to let anything happen to him.
"Yes. Of course," Cas said, nearly offended that he'd ask. "You can find him a place?" he asked as they began walking back toward the spot where they'd left Henry.
"Of course!  Yeah," Anna agreed.  "Go home, Cas.  Don't worry about us. We'll manage.  Feel better."
The mindless task was a welcomed one.  Cas hadn't worked the circulation desk in ages, but he could suddenly see how this could be a much-needed break from Meg during the day.  Maybe he'd have to start working the desk more often.  There weren't many customers this time of day, so he puttered around making jobs for himself: Cleaning some books whose covers were returned filthy.  Taping up torn pages.  Refilling the low ink on the printer.  Wiping down the counters.  Frivolous jobs.  Robot jobs.  Still, he preferred to stay busy.
For a moment, Cas felt a bit slighted at how abruptly Dean dismissed him, but then he remembered how scared and embarrassed he felt when he had an attack.  Without overthinking it, he gently reached out and stroked Dean's hair.
Minutes later, Cas found himself in a plush, comfy bed, hesitantly curled up to Dean's side. He was still nervous, mostly because Gabriel's words kept echoing in his head:
Dean hung up the phone and glumly shoved it back in his pocket, then began the short trip back to the club.
As Cas shot him thankful look, Gabriel smiled and gave a little wink before heading back to the living room. He sighed happily to himself as he flopped down onto the couch.
Dean nodded. "In some ways, you are. It heightens your senses. Makes colors and flavors and sounds seem much more intense. It's like you're calmer, and more alert at the same time." He smiled as Cas nuzzled against his chest again. "The lovey, touchy part is nice though, huh?"
Dean snorted in laughter as he gunned the car down the empty stretch of highway. "Yeah. I guess it is kinda funny. But we're just gonna take 'em off anyway..."
"That's my boy," Dean murmured, pulling him closer for a soft kiss on his temple. "Remember. Blinders," he winked, shielding the far side of Cas's face.  "It's just you, me, and the stage tonight."
Sam smiled.  "All good, don't worry.  I'm sorry, I uh, should have called before I came over.  Hope I didn't wake you this morning."
"Nevermind.   Please forget I said anything," he begged, burying his face in Dean's shoulder to hide the blush on his face.
"I don't know if I can..." He began licking a trail down his torso, dragging his tongue in an excruciatingly slow manner as Cas whined.  "I think it's more fun if I take my time..."
"See ya."  Cas sat dejectedly on the floor in front of one of his empty shelves, putting each book back in numerical order.  He was stewing in resentment, thinking about how much he didn't want to be there when Charlie came dashing over.
Cas stretched to reach the remote control that was just inches from his grasp on the coffee table, and Dean moved with him, unwilling to lose his warmth even for a moment.  The TV clicked on and Cas found a local station just in time for the weather report.
"Maybe we should just stay in today," Sam said softly. He couldn't bear the thought of breaking up this rare moment of blissful quiet.
"Good boy, " Cas praised him.  "Come get on the bed and we'll watch a movie.   What do you want to watch tonight?"
"Shut up," Cas grinned. "Yeah, it's definitely been better. I go back to Dr. Mitchell just before Christmas. She's probably going to start talking about getting me back to work," he sighed.
"Mmm. God, I love you," Dean hummed. "You feel amazing, baby." He wrapped an arm around Cas's chest, pulling his body closer as he nibbled a trail up his neck and behind his ear.
party every weekend either.  But I do love providing the music... This is so good," he said again, shoveling another forkful of noodles into his mouth.
Sure enough, within a half hour, Cas was already tipsy.  Dean watched in amusement as uptight, awkward Cas slowly became less inhibited.  He'd only seen Cas once when he was hammered, and then, he'd been incredibly depressed.  But tipsy Cas...
"Hey sexy," Dean winked, just before he lunged forward and locked him in a kiss that nearly knocked him of his feet.
"Ohh," Dean breathed, almost in relief. "Baaaby," he crooned.  "Come here, sweetheart." He wrapped Cas up in a tight, possessive embrace. "It's not a big deal."
"Borrow?  Since when do you replace it?" Cas chided.  Gabriel lived upstairs in the duplex they shared and he was forever coming down to 'borrow' something.
level of celebrity.  For whatever reason, people are compelled to come up and talk to me.  It's totally weird, and I'm still not entirely used to it, but it is what it is.  And yeah, I won't lie... people flirt with me sometimes. In terms of building my career, as long as they're not rude or disrespectful, I'm polite to them. But I promise you, you have nothing to worry about."
"Dean!  Dean!  Dean!  Oh!  Oh!"  Cas practically roared as his orgasm punched through him, and Dean hurried to shush him just as he heard Sam pounding on the wall in protest.
Cas had closed his eyes now, and a few stray tears were making their way down his cheeks as he tried not to hyperventilate, so Dean did his best to talk him through it.
Dean just raised an expectant eyebrow at him, then turned around and headed for the bathroom. "Oh, and Cas?  I like being obeyed," he growled over his shoulder.
The ride home was quiet.   As the Impala crept down a winding dirt side road, the brothers stared silently ahead, a habit not entirely unusual for them after a hard day's work.  Dean was exhausted, drumming gently on the steering wheel to keep himself awake, when Sam finally spoke.
With two cups of hot chocolate and a small plate of cookies, they headed to one of the blue padded benches with a view of the skating rink.
Despite the warm flush creeping up his face, Sam smiled.  He snuggled in a bit closer, letting Cas's voice and the gentle 'whoosh' of Dean's breathing calm him. It had been such a long day, and this was
"Good boy, Zeppelin!  You're such a cute puppy." Cas sat down on the floor beside him and gave him a pat on the head.  "Who's a good boy?  Speak."
"I can't stay, Cas," Dean laughed.  "I'm sure I've worn out my welcome already by staying overnight.  I'm sorry, usually I don't presumptuously spend the night like that," he grinned.  "And then I snuggled with you all night, which is sort of inappropriate for the first time we've hung out, I suppose.  By the way, you cuddle when you sleep.  It's pretty cute."
"Pleeease!" Cas was nearly in tears at Dean's soft rejection. He was already pressed tightly to Dean's body, but he needed
Gabriel sighed happily as he watched Dean slip an arm around Cas's shoulder and whisper in his ear before planting a tiny kiss on his temple.  "Aren't they just the cutest?" he murmured.
"Hmm," Dean nodded uncertainly, staring at him for a long moment.  "What would you do if I kissed you right now, Cas?" he asked in a raspy voice.
"Aww.  Well, we'll head to bed after we're done eating, okay?  Um.  Obviously I don't have a guest room or anything, so you can take the bed tonight. I can sleep here," he suggested casually.
act like a small child sometimes, especially when he was tired.  He sighed, then kissed his forehead tenderly.  "You're not ready to get out of bed?  Or you're not ready to be big yet?"
help me loosen up," he laughed. "And Dean and Sam made sure I was hydrated and chewing gum to stop me from chewing up the side of my cheek... it was a hell of an experience, that's for sure."
"Up you go," Cas suddenly said, scooping him up in his arms and then lowering him into the bath.  "Good boy."
"Good.  I think we'll up your SSRI dosage just once more and see how that goes, okay?  You still have your panic pills if you need them.  If you have any problems, if you start feeling worse, call the office and I'll call you back ASAP, alright?"
"Cool."  She gave a little wave and turned on her heel, her red hair spinning out behind her as she trotted back to the circulation desk.
Before the movie had even ended, Dean had dozed off; he relaxed so much during littletime, it wasn't uncommon for him to fall asleep.  Cas knew he didn't dare turn off the TV though, or Dean would jolt awake and ask him to start the movie over again.  So instead, he closed his eyes and snuggled in closer, just listening to the rhythmic 'whoosh' of Dean's breathing. He hadn't been relaxing long when a sudden loud thump on the door startled him from his peaceful quiet time.
"Relax, were not done,"Gabe said as he drew closer to roll up his sleeves. "Yeah. Three-quarter length sleeves..." He mused. "Take off your socks and put your loafers back on."
"Well," Crowley continued, completely unfazed,"it's my understanding that some people pay good money for that sort of thing. Ungrateful as always." He turned his head, motioning to a spot in the corner, where his throne suddenly materialized, and he took his time strolling over to it before finally taking a seat. "For what it's worth, it
"We can go together.  C'mon," Cas said, taking a seat at the front and scrunching his legs up.  Dean slotted in behind him and gave them a solid push with his arms before wrapping them around Cas's waist.  The toboggan hesitated for a moment but quickly picked up speed as it began it's downward plummet.
"Well," Dean sighed.  "That sucks.  I guess I'd better call off the show tonight.  Hopefully I can make it home..."
Still, today he was itching to scene.  He hadn't seen Cas in a few days, and the last few times, they'd been busy doing
"This."  Cas spread his arms and legs wide and flapped them up and down, creating a winged version of himself in the snow. Dean smiled and lay back down next to him, mimicking his motions until there were two perfect, side-by-side snow angels.  He pushed himself up and stood, offering a hand up to Cas.
remember what felt good, so he mimicked Dean's actions, adding his hands into the mix, pumping his shaft and cupping his balls.
Cas shrugged sheepishly.  "Just had a feeling. You both look exhausted," he observed.  He gave Dean a quick peck on the cheek and ushered him to a chair.
"Hmmph.  Well, I think we can lie here another ten minutes, and then I should probably get up and see how the roads are. God, is it still coming down out there?" he asked, squinting again at glare of white through the big picture window.
Cas blushed and rolled his eyes. "You sound like my brother. Pretty sure he's on Team Get Cas Laid..."
The look of delight on Cas's face was so adorable, Dean just couldn't help himself; he dropped the bone and rose to his knees, nuzzling against his chest.
Dean nodded tiredly and hugged him a little tighter."I'm sorry, sweetheart. I hate to tell you this, but you might feel shitty and a little depressed later on too. Maybe you'll luck out, but if not, we'll get through it together, okay?"
Castiel leaned his head back into the warm shower spray and closed his eyes, letting the water rinse away the salty sting of tears.
"Yeah," Cas sighed.  "You know how it is.  I'm always emotionally drained after therapy.  She gave me homework this time," he said, scowling as he climbed into the passenger seat.
"Well," Dean said softly. "That's why I came.  I needed you too. Hey, it's already light outside, and you look exhausted.  Why don't we get some sleep, okay?" He nuzzled against him, breathing in the clean smell of Cas's shampoo mixed with the cologne that drove him so crazy, and he kissed his forehead again.
Dr. Mitchell nodded and tapped her pen on her tablet. "Well, no one says you have to, of course. But before you said it's something you'd like, but the anxiety keeps you from doing it. Do you still feel this way?"
"But you can't just say something like that and then not tell me!  All this time... why haven't you told me?" Cas exclaimed.
"Not yet, baby," he soothed, picking up the wet towel from the nightstand to wipe his hands.  "Can't leave you a sticky mess, now, can I?" He tossed the cloth and bent to lick a long, flat stripe across Cas's right nipple, then swirled his tongue around it, humming happily as Cas whimpered. "Might take a while to clean you up though..."
"Want you on top of me, riding my cock..." Dean whispered as he trailed kisses from the inside of his knee to dangerously close to his dick, but never touching him.  Not just yet . "Want to be so deep inside of you,  you'll..."
"I like watching you like this," Cas breathed. "You're so raw and vulnerable. It's nice to see this side of you."
He'd quickly fixed the sound issue this afternoon, and now he had time to spare, which is how he ended up here, watching the skaters on the ice rink below.
When Dean pulled the van into his driveway ten minutes later, Cas let out an audible sigh.  He hadn't been taking much joy in
He still couldn't believe Cas had told him.   Of course, he didn't know which was worse - telling him or letting him wonder what the hell he'd walked in on for the rest of his life. The anxiety started creeping in again, and he huffed in annoyance.
Talking to Cas put him in a much better mood, and the next two hours flew by in a blur of pulsating music, bright lights, cheers, and glow sticks.  As the crowd slowly started to thin and disperse, Dean took his headphones off, wiping tiredly at his sweaty brow.  When he started this, he never would have thought making music could be physically demanding, but when he was in the zone, he never stopped moving.
Sam smiled. "Well if you're feeling brave, you're welcome to come dance with us. You've got to get the full experience from the dance floor."
"Stop it," Cas giggled, shoving his hand away.  "I'll be fine."  He was still anxious, but he was also excited, and with Dean being so touchy-feely tonight, the warm, giddy feeling in his stomach was making him forget everything else.  He let his head rest on Dean's shoulder, closed his eyes, and took a deep breath.
Cas nodded and began scanning through Dean's collection, thankful for the distraction. Poring through each album, he was amazed at just how similar their musical tastes really  were.  With the exception of a few albums he didn't recognize, this could well be his own music collection.  "You really do have good taste," he murmured.  "Wait.  'Dean Ambrose'.  Is this you?"
Dean shook his head. "I called. Remember that red-haired woman? Michelle? She said she'll find room for you if you want to head out now."
Dean laughed. "Yeah, most people think I just work one night a week, but there's a lot that goes into those sets.  I do a lot of stuff spur-of-the-moment too, of course, but you've gotta test things, see what works.  And I don't recycle too much. Gotta keep it fresh every week, work with whatever is hot on the dance charts, et cetera.  At least I can pretty much set my own hours, you know?"
