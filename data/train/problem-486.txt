"No, mother," John finally answered.
"What?" Sherlock asked, furrowing his brow in confusion.
After they finished chanting and had done a bit of stretching to warm up, John knew exactly what Sherlock seemed to need. He was tense and energetic today, clearly itching for a high and begging for something to occupy both his mind and body. John knew just how to fix that.
John Hamish Watson. Ex-soldier, doctor, turned yoga instructor. Certainly not the trajectory he would have imagined for his life, but here he was. And he was happy, something he hadn't felt properly since he returned to London. He'd initially taken up yoga to help himself relax and escape from his mind. PTSD, they told him. Lifelong struggle. War inside his mind. Great. Then there was his injury. He'd taken a bullet to the shoulder and developed a limp. Psychosomatic, they said. Pain in the arse, he told them. Still, he hated physical therapy. It felt like everyone there just pitied him. After repeated attempts to help were met with outbursts from the soldier, one doctor suggested that yoga with proper instruction could help with the physical therapy as well.
"Nonsense," John dismissed, then looked back to the bird. "Go on now. Someone's bound to be worrying about you."
"We'll go through the hole in the Wall and I'll take you to Mary Morstan," John decided.
"But without me, you'd still be stuck here!" the blond argued.
"Don't you know what stars are?" Sherlock chuckled. "We're all like this. We look like humans, you could say. But we're a bit different as well. I'm sure you've heard the legends."
Surely John was avoiding his crotch. That's what it was, Sherlock was sure. He was going to every other part of his body because he just didn't want to even think about Sherlock's penis. Slowly, tears began to well up in his eyes as he worried more and more that John would leave him.
"Marry him with my blessing, and we'll be quits and done" John assured. "The star will probably think so too."
. I'm bound to you, you stupid git. You must understand that. Truly.
John rolled his eyes, then kneeled by Sherlock and set his leg straight out. Looking it over quietly, he nodded a bit. "It's a sprain. Don't worry. It'll heal on its own given time. But you can walk on it if needed, so let's go," he insisted, tugging on the chain. And Sherlock had no choice but to follow him out of the hole and on his journey.
"There's a new drug my lab has been working on. It seems to put users into a sleeping state, but they lose any traceable signs of life. No pulse, no heartbeat. They appear dead and any examiner will believe it. Especially if they work for me," Mycroft replied. "I can get the drug for you and make it appear as though you died of drug overdose. A funeral will be held and we can place a body double in your casket. You'll be able to sneak off and see your husband, run off with him. And no one will know."
"Sinful 'v' right here, absolutely tantalizing every time I see it. Especially when you wear those low hanging trousers," John hummed with a soft chuckle. "And then there's my favourite bit of you. Your cock is absolutely gorgeous. I can't believe I've gone so long without seeing it. I've felt it and I had a picture in my head, but this.....it's so much better than I ever imagined. So long and lithe. Just like the rest of you. I.....Can I?" he asked, a hand reached towards Sherlock's dick.
"Young people today," Irene sighed, shaking her head. "One of them thought it would be good sport to fire the house of a poor old woman, who has never harmed a soul. Well, he learned his lesson soon enough."
The pair relaxed together for a while longer, both silently agreeing that popsicles were their new favourite treats.
"No. You promised me anything I desire."
"Before you say anything, I must tell you I am nothing but a harmless old woman. I've never harmed a soul and seeing such a grand and terrifying lady such as yourself fills me with dread," Janine greeted, head bowed.
With a slap of the reins, the caravan was moving once more, though at a slow pace. Sherlock sighed, taking up residence on the bed.
"I was ready for you, Jim. But not for the witch," Richard sighed, not that his twin could hear him.
"We have to do something," Sherlock insisted. The usually cold star was rather passionate when it came to something like this. "The unicorn is hurt. The lion will kill it!"
Sherlock blushed deeply, nearly collapsing once more. But then he heard another voice from across the room.
"My heart? I've been reliably informed I don't have one," Sherlock answered simply. Irene just laughed.
But John was quiet as he caught sight of the man, eyes gently exploring the detective's form. He almost looked sad as he watched Sherlock in his own light blue suit with a powder blue tie and pocket square. Sherlock, however, had elected to dress up for the occasion, foregoing a tie pin, but donning an entire three piece suit. The flower on his left lapel matched John's and his hair was even styled for the wedding.
"I'm not! Damn that bloody witch," the younger grumbled. And with a wind blowing through the Dyke, the brothers were gone.
"What?" Sherlock asked, raising a brow as he began to worry once more.
Janine smirked. "Oh, yes, that's quite an interesting herb. It grows only in Garamond, on an island in the middle of a lake. It tastes simply delicious with all manner of fish and meats. And it has the interesting property of causing those who taste it to speak nothing but the truth for a number of hours."
"What?" Sherlock asked, too tired and hot at this point to think properly.
"Oh, don't be nervous," John insisted. "You'll feel so much better when you're sitting in my mother's parlour, drinking her tea. Well, not drinking tea, but there will be tea for you to sip. Now, here's the gap. And there's my old friend, Mr. Lestrade!"
"No promises," John chuckled. "Cheers, Mary. Really."
"Sleeping."
"You want to go back, don't you?" John asked. "Back to the sky, to shin again at night."
"I thought I had long since beaten such insolence out of you," Janine snarled.
"Why?" John questioned, but was soon quieted. Listening with the star, he heard a distant whinny followed by a roar. "It's coming from up ahead!"
"Too late?" John echoed.
"Thank you," John replied, eagerly climbing up and taking his seat before the carriage took off once more down the road.
Sherlock smirked a bit, eyeing John's body. "I would beg to differ," he replied, his deep voice resonating in John's body and settling in his groin. "Evidence would suggest that you're aroused, whether it be from a thought, the cool air, or --"
"It couldn't happen," Sherlock argued, shaking his head. Suddenly, the noise became too much to bear and he looked around for the source. "What is that noise?"
John looked at well and chuckled when he realized Sherlock meant he was getting hard. "I think I can find a way to release that," he purred, then followed as Sherlock began moving to his bedroom. Before long, the pair were doing more than just yoga. But they were right. It did release Sherlock's 'tense muscle' and they ended up falling asleep shortly afterwards.
"That stone was your grandfather's, John," Emma explained.
With some persuasion, Mycroft agreed and Sherlock was in the class by the next morning. Neither he nor John expected what would come next.
"Your problems are no concern of mine. Never again shall I be called a slattern, or slave, or anything that is not my name. I am Lady Emma Watson, firstborn and only daughter of the Eighty-First Lord of Stormhold. The spell you have bound me with is over and done. Now apologize to me and pay me for my services. For these things have their rules."
"Come in!" came the answer and John let himself in with a smile.
Tears fell freely from Sherlock's stormy eyes as the detective played through this part. Ever since he'd lost John, he seemed to have lost himself. He didn't know how to go on without his blogger. People had offered to help, but he didn't want anyone trying to take John's place. When Sherlock did take cases, on rare occasions, he allowed Mary to write them up for him. It wasn't the same though. Sherlock didn't feel the same joy for cases as he had before. He seemed to be far more petty when it came to Mary now, picking fights over little things. Life had become dull and he'd even. He had to learn to move on though. He had to let go and accept that John had died. This was real and John wasn't coming back. And it was his fault...... Now he needed to take care of Rosie and make sure she was raised as John would've wanted.
"Well if it doe not suit you, you may leave. There is no silver chain that will be holding you to the throne of Stormhold," Emma assured. "Now, what do you say?"
Sherlock was as well, though he couldn't say so around John's impressive cock. Feeling John tense, he hollowed his cheeks and took John's load in his mouth, then cried out himself as he came. His mouth slipped from John's cock and cum spilled forth from his lips and onto his chest as he laid back on the floor and stroked himself through his orgasm.
"It's a bird," John realized as they got closer. "It must be trapped or something. Oh....it's got a silver chain on its ankle, and it's caught in the branches. Keep still, bird. I'll free you."
"I must warn you though, if you leave here for... through there," she began.
"Wrong parent," Emma chuckled once more. "You are the last of the line of Stormhold, on your mother's side. Go on. Put it about your neck."
"Oh, right," John answered, clearing his throat as he felt like he was tripping over his words. "Do you have a boyfriend? Which is fine, by the way."
John couldn't help stammering as his jaw dropped, eyes wide. Mother? Could it really be true? She had seemed so familiar, but did he dare even hope?"
"Come on, Faithless, Hopeless," Janine sighed as she climbed into the driver's seat. "Walk on. Diggory's Dyke is just around the bend."
"Uncle Sherlock?" she called softly, coming over to where the man sat. Even at such a young age, she could tell the man who was like a father to her was upset. She didn't know why, but she'd heard the song on the violin and knew what it was. She knew the word by heart after watching the show so often and she knew it was sad.

"I know who seeks you and why she needs you. Also I know the provenance of the topaz stone you wear upon a silver chain. It is the stone they call the power of Stormhold."
"He is the most dangerous man you will ever meet," the prince told him, then began glancing around. "Hm. If you ask me, there is something most unnatural about this storm."
else?"
Okay, so maybe Sherlock hadn't been fine with every woman John brought home. Well, really, he'd gone out of his way to ruin multiple dates out of jealousy. But in fairness, most of them weren't right for John to begin with. He was really doing the doctor a favor. But even still, he hadn't been particularly worried about most of them. He knew John would leave them, even if it meant Sherlock had to intervene first and point out what was wrong with them. But all in all, he was usually fine with the women who came into John's life now and again.
"Not again, John," Mary sighed, a few of her friends behind her giggling as she opened the door.
"Doesn't it? Sounds a bit dull," the detective huffed.
Who would come into her life now and again
"In real life," the blond clarified. "There are no archenemies in real life. Doesn't happen."
"More of an arch to your side, Rachel. That's it. Think ballerina, not snapped spaghetti noodle. Jasmine, let's see if you can't extend that arm a bit more. There you go! Very good, everyone," he praised.
"Thank you," John answered. Before they could say much more, the Captain interrupted.
As Sherlock walked into the health club and past the front desk on his way to the pool, he happened to pass a large window looking into one of the yoga classes. And the second he spotted the instructor, he was hooked. Unable to hear a thing the blond said through the glass, he just watched as the stranger walked through the rows with a slight limp, adjusting his students easily and demonstrating poses. At that moment, he knew he needed to be in that class, even if he was more than a bit skeptical about the more spiritual aspects of the practice. But when Mycroft sent the car to pick him up, he immediately demanded to be placed in the class.
"And how am I supposed to know that is the truth?" the hag demanded.
"Oh, I must've dozed off. Most unlike me," Sherlock commented as he stood.
Most of John's classes were filled with women in typical yoga attire: yoga pants, tank tops, trainers. Some with bras, others without. And while John did find some of them attractive, he didn't engage in any sort of relationship other than what was required for him to do his job. That was one strict rule he had. He never had any sort of relationship with his students other than as a teacher and his student.
Irene's goat-drawn chariot was moving quickly towards the mountains, though they slowed as the sun began to set. She stopped at the base of the mountains, a predatory smile spread across her lips. If looks could kill, this one certainly would as it was enough to freeze anyone in their tracks. Taking a deep breath, she sighed with pleasure.
, Sherlock. You....You are the best thing that could ever happen to me." By this point, tears were trickling down John's face.
"Well of course, but I never thought.....come on. You have to come with me," John insisted, tugging on the star's wrist.
"They're asking for you down at the Wall. Young lady wants a word with you," the animal informed him before leaving.
"And she acceded to this?" Sherlock asked, raising a brow.
"Not yet!" Sherlock chuckled in response, head turning towards the door as he fixed his own suit jacket. "But I'm definitely planning to! Ha ha!"
"Should he cross the wall and enter the world of things as they are, he will become in an instant cold and dead. Of no use to us," Sally sighed.
"Sometimes we would sing songs like that in the night, all about our lady Mother, and the joys of shining, and of loneliness...." the star admitted.
That they didn't really matter until you.
As dawn approached, John woke to a snuffling noise by his head. Sitting up, he groaned and rubbed his eyes before gasping softly. A badger stood by him, walking on its hind legs with a coat and hat.
," Irene told her firmly as she rose from her seat. "From the moment I leave, you will forget ever having seen me. You shall forget all of this, even my curse, but the knowledge of it shall vex and irritate you."
. And I understand completely if you thought this through and came to the conclusion that we...."
"Tell me, young man. Have you any idea what you've been carrying all this time?" Janine asked curiously.
With their agreement sealed, John returned to the pub to find his father at the bar.
"There's a rare amount of lightning in this cloud coming up. We're hunting for lightning bolts," Wiggins answered as thunder sounded once more. The ship creaked around them as it worked to get closer. Wiggins continued shouting orders to his crew and a flash was seen, captured by a sailor.
"Yes, and you're next! Billy, grab him!" Irene shouted. But the unicorn charged in, rushing straight for the innkeeper. The man, formerly a goat, charged right back and soon found himself speared on the horn of the unicorn. As the witch continued to fight, her only other servant was soon killed by the great beast as well. It protected them well while John worked to light the candle he'd been given before he'd left. A Babylon candle. When lit, if he focused on where he wanted go, it could take them anywhere. If he didn't, it would take them somewhere that could be better or worse. Just as he got it lit, Irene charged at them with her knife. But the unicorn charged back and the pair speared one another. Irene was stabbed in the shoulder, but the unicorn was mortally wounded, stabbed in the eye and crying as it fell to the ground. Sherlock and John escaped with his candle and the inn disappeared. Stuck in the rain with her magic fading, Irene couldn't help but cry for a moment. It only got worse as her sisters chose that moment to communicate in the reflection of the rain water and unicorn blood puddled nearby.
It was a long road ahead of the pair once they'd left the ship, but much closer than they'd been before. John ate berries and nuts they found along the way, drinking from whatever clear streams he could find. Whenever possible, they stopped at small farms and John worked in exchange for food and a small space in the barn to rest. Thanks to Sherlock's sharp tongue and quick mind, they also managed to escape a Goblin Press Gang, and John faced off against one of the Great Tawny Eagles as they headed through the forest. Otherwise, they would've been food for the Eagle's young. Finally, they reached the road that led through the Dyke and back to the Wall. But as they walked, something bright caught Sherlock's eye.
"One of the articles about you.....Well, they called you The Virgin. Why is that?" John asked.
"Where's that bird now? I need my servant," Janine muttered to herself.
"Since you were born, John Watson, I have not demanded one thing of you. And now, the first simple request I make of you, you refuse me? Now I ask of you, John, is that any way to treat your mother?" she asked.
"I....I'm sorry, John. I'll get dressed. I was just....experimenting," Sherlock lied, heading towards his closet to get something to wear.
"So sorry," Irene replied. "It's been such a noisy night. Wine, milord?"
"So....you don't have a girlfriend then?" John asked, raising a brow.
"Forgetting something?" Sherlock scoffed, raising his bound wrist. John attempted to remove it, but with no luck.
With that, they left, heading back to the market until they found an unoccupied patch of grass under a tree. John was exhausted by now and laid down to rest while Sherlock watched the stars above. Suddenly there came footsteps from nearby and Sherlock looked around to spot the woman from before.
"What about your other brothers?" she questioned.
Janine quickly shook her head. "No, I swear it on the sisterhood."
"There you go. Now fly away home," John told it gently. But the bird refused to leave.
"Your choice," the beautiful woman insisted.
"Think nothing of it," Wiggins insisted before returning to shouting to his sailors.
"Stop," he commanded the beast with a sigh. "I cannot continue to ride like this. I'm soaked and tired, and surely you are as well. There's an Inn just up ahead. You rest here and I'll stay the night there."
heart," John insisted, holding Sherlock's hand.
Petty and dull with the nerve to doubt her.
"Oh.....so you're unattached then.....like me. That's....that's good," John replied with a sigh.
John set the popsicle down on top of its wrapper on the table so it wouldn't make a mess, then moved his hands so they rested on Sherlock's gorgeous hips as they jutted out so suddenly from his lithe body. But he frowned, furrowing his brow as Sherlock pulled away and sank to his knees with a smirk. Removing his dressing gown, the detective kneeled naked in front of John before going to undress John as well.
"You are an evil, foolish slattern to desert me like this!" Janine snapped.
"Thank you, mother," John responded, earning a smile.
"Ride a unicorn?" Sherlock scoffed as though it was the most absurd thing he'd ever heard.
It's over, isn't it?
Attached to a similar chain some ways away was a beautiful bird with brightly colored feathers. A former princess lured from her home as a child and enslaved by the witch known as Madame Janine, she was confined to her bird form now and without speech. She'd earned this punishment nearly twenty years ago when she gave away expensive merchandise just to sleep with a cute buyer. But the witch didn't know her slave had given birth to a young boy and snuck him back to his father one night, behind the safety of the Wall.
Sherlock just shrugged. "We stars eat only darkness. We drink only light. So I'm not hungry."
"Maybe there's a magic word," Sherlock laughed sarcastically.
"Good work! That'll be double grog all around!" Wiggins shouted, receiving cheers from everyone in reply.
"Heads it is then. I'll partake of the rump then, nothing but dull meat to nibble," she hummed, splitting it between the two of them. "Apologies, dear, I don't have any salt. But try this. I think you'll find it more than adequate. It's my own recipe, you know. A little thyme, a bit of basil..."
"Why not? I'd do anything for you," John replied softly. "I love you."
"I'm honestly not that bad, y'know," John insisted. "Once you get to know me, I mean. Look, I'm sorry about all of this chaining you up business."
"You're not marrying John Watson?" Sherlock called after her.
"S-Sh-Sherlock......oh, fuck, I'm close," John whimpered, biting his lower lip.
"When you were a dormouse, my son," Emma chuckled. "Yes. But now I have my own form back, like you, and my servitude is over. Ask Sherlock what he carries. You have the right."
Tears welled up in Sherlock's eyes as he played the tune for the chorus, recalling every word. While the sex of the singer and lover may have been flipped, it still rang true for him. He couldn't accept that that it was truly over. He still wanted John, wanted to be with the man. Even after confessing their feelings for one another, it had been too late. He'd lost the love of his life and now he couldn't even claim to be a widower. He was just alone and he couldn't move on. He was still grieving even years later.
John read through very single article and even looked through the website that had popped up. It really was very interesting, if a bit dry. Everyone else seemed to view him as a hopeless druggie who liked tearing people apart by telling them upsetting details about their lives. But John couldn't quite fit that with the man he'd seen. But as he continued reading, it became clear. Sherlock Holmes was a recovering addict struggling with a brain he couldn't turn off. Sure, he was abrasive a good deal of the time. But with a mind that seemed to be running full speed constantly, who wouldn't be? He seemed to be fighting a war in his mind, a phrase John heard constantly in reference to his PTSD. Then and there, the doctor decided he was going to help Sherlock, no matter what it took.
Sherlock frowned, sitting up. "No, he isn't. And I am not moving on. I.....I think I love him, Mycroft. And I'm not giving him up," he argued. "One day we're going to get married, whether Mummy and Dad approve or not."
He pulled out a glass snowdrop from his pocket and showed it to her. After a beat, she gasped and rushed back to him.
"Tell me, love, how does your heart feel?" Irene asked with a smile.
"H-Have you any warm clothes?" Sherlock stammered, the cold finally starting to get to him.
The caravan continued on its way through Diggory's Dyke, heading for the Wall just like all the rest. And just like all the rest, they were waved to a stop by an old woman with white hair and wrinkled skin outside a burnt hovel of a hut. The woman was blind in one eye and hobbling as she made her way to the caravan.
"I do. But I gave you my word, John. And I will keep my word. He knows this. If you want me, then I'm yours," Mary told him.
"I've got some hay for the unicorn. Do they eat hay?" John called as he returned to the oak tree where he'd left Sherlock and the great beast. He was eating an apple, though it was hardly the only thing he'd had to eat. Feeling much better, he'd missed the hoofbeats disappearing into the distance. Sherlock the Star along with the unicorn they'd saved were gone.
John was absolutely stunned. What was a man doing down here? And more importantly, where was his star? He looked around, ignoring the other completely as he searched for the star.
"Please. With this ankle? I'll hardly be running anywhere anytime soon," the star insisted, holding the other end of the rope as John left.
Unbeknownst to John, he was far from the only person who wanted the star. Quite far from it, actually. As he attempted to make the long journey home so he could present his gift to Mary, numerous others had begun their search for the very star he dragged along with him. Three princes, as well as three witches, all desired the star for themselves. For you see, the star had something to offer each of them. For the witches, the star's heart was a delicacy. If consumed when the star was truly happy, it could give them incredible youth and beauty. But the star's heart was of little concern to the princes. What they desired was around the star's neck: the yellow topaz necklace their father had cast out of the castle. The first prince to find it and wear it around his own neck would become the new king of Stormhold. The princes had already killed off several of their other brothers, leaving only the three of them now.
"You become a mouse!" Janine laughed, picking him up.
"Yes, well, as I was saying, dull," the detective continued.
Richard sighed, shaking his head. "Of course he did. I have to go then too."
John shook his head though, refusing to let Sherlock try to dictate how the session was going to play out. "No. You're not doing chaturangas. We're going to do something simple and very useful. It's called the Corpse Pose. I'll lead you through a guided meditation and you just have to lie back and listen to me."
"Quick, while they're getting their breath back. You'll be fine," Sherlock told him.
"What am I going to do? They aren't going to let up and I don't want to marry him! I love John and we're already married," Sherlock insisted worriedly.
It's over, isn't it?
"Yes..."
"Mostly by trying to do the right thing," John sighed, shaking his head.
"Wait, I don't know your name or your address!" John called out with a little chuckle.
John gently removed the dressing gown, bit by bit. He slid it off of Sherlock's shoulder, pressing a gentle kiss to it.
"Ah ah ah, tonight is all about you," the taller purred. John raised a brow, but let him continue as he reached down to undo his trousers.
"I'll send the pot-maid. Sarah?" she called. "A burnt ale to the lad in the stable, and be quick about it."
"There is a young man who I have offended greatly. I hope to catch up to him and make amends for my behavior," John responded.
The unicorn snorted, but kneeled by Sherlock. Though the star was a bit shocked, he managed to climb up onto the creature's back with a bit of effort and seated himself comfortably, holding onto the mane as the unicorn stood once more.
"Well....East," John chuckled.
I was fine with the men
"Oh, you mean the wedding?" Mary asked.
A party. That was perfect. John's friends were sure a party would perk him right up. And it was at the Holmes manor, so it would be even more fun. After all, the Holmes and Watson families had a notorious feud, so sneaking into the Holmes party would be an extra slap in the face to the Holmes family.
Mycroft sighed. "Well, there is a way to get around this.......But it would mean breaking John out of prison to come and see you and complete the plan."
"I've just had a terrible thought occur to me," he admitted. "I was trying to think of the color of Mary's eyes and I couldn't."
"Do you have another guest here? I hear an extra horse," he commented.
The bird squawked loudly, the chain tinkling quietly with its every movement.
"I recognize other things here too. For instance, those knives on the table top. There are tattered scrolls in the vaults of Stormhold in which they are named. They are from the first age of the world," he revealed. Not long after, John came running in with the unicorn right outside.
John sighed. "All right, stay here," he murmured, inching out into the meadow and between the two massive beasts. "Here, kitty, kitty. Here's your nice crown," he cooed as though talking to a kitten, picking up the crown. "See? Now go.....fetch!" he shouted, throwing the crown as far away as he could. The lion ran off to follow it, roaring in triumph when it was captured. Turning to the unicorn, John reached out gently. "And what about you, hm?" he hummed softly.
Sherlock huffed, rolling his eyes. "I did
As dawn broke over the land of Faerie, John was finally able to see where they'd ended up. Well, sort of. It almost looked like they were surrounded by fog, but Sherlock knew better.
(See the end of the chapter for
Sherlock paused before answering, "Piss off."
As he watched the woman, picking up on her habits, Jim tried to devise a plan to kill her. He considered poison through food, but noted the woman seemed to only eat what she had trapped. She was far too careful. He'd thought about leaving a steaming, fresh baked apple pie with deadly baneberries, but soon dismissed it as impractical. After all, he had no oven. But he did have a container of lucifers and a flask of brandy. Perhaps there was something to be done after all....
"I know it's fine," Sherlock told him. "But no."
"Sir?" the young woman asked gently, shaking his shoulder a bit. "Why, don't tell me you've finished already!"
Sherlock shook his head and smiled. "No, not until tomorrow if the storm is gone," he assured. This certainly seemed interesting to him.
"Then.....what I desire is for you to marry this man. The man you love," John decided. "I desire that you should be married as soon as possible. Within this week, if it can be arranged. And I desire that you be as happy together as any man and woman have ever been."
"Perhaps we could start all over again, just pretend none of this ever happened" John suggested, then extended a hand. "Hi. I'm John. John Watson. Pleased to meet you."
John furrowed his brow. "How did you know about me?" he inquired.
"Ahoy, hello!" came a voice from above. It was that of the captain, Bill Wiggins. "Parties in need of assistance?"
"No," Sherlock answered firmly. "I won't marry him. And there's nothing that could make me."
"Where did you get that?" Janine demanded. "Give it to me! Give it to me this instant!"
"Oh, Sherlock didn't tell me he was interested in yoga. Well I'm sure it will do him some good. Better than shooting my walls," the woman chuckled, shaking his hand. "I'm Mrs. Hudson, his landlady. Let me bring you up," she told him, leading the way upstairs to 221B. As soon as she opened the door, she began fretting. "Oh, Sherlock, it's such a mess! And you have company. You couldn't have cleaned up?"
"How do you do, sir?" Sherlock greeted as he sat.
"Companion? What companion?" the woman scoffed.
"Mary?" he asked, only to be met with laughter.
"Just as I thought. She's a captive of the witch, as I was of you," Sherlock revealed.
"What have you done to him?!" Sherlock gasped, but no one heard him.
"Oh yes," John told her. "I did what you asked me to do."
He lost his train of thought as John's hand wrapped around his length, stroking it gently. Sherlock's breath caught for a moment before he let himself relax, letting John handle everything. But eventually, his knees began to get weak and he moved them to the bed where they could both be more comfortable.
"Would I be correct in presuming that you cannot see or hear me?" he called forward. Sure enough, he received no response.
"Mary must be here, asking for me. I'm off to see her," John decided, then bit his lip. "Look. Well. It's probably best if you stay here. I wouldn't want to confuse her or anything."
"It is a reasonable plan," James commented from his vantage point nearby. "And once he's killed her, he can go on to claim the power of Stormhold."
And so together, they walked off, going on about their travels in their own time. Lady Emma returned to Stormhold as she'd planned, elephant and all. The kingdom, which had presumed her dead, celebrated her return with cheering crowds. As she was reinstated to her throne, she announced that she had given birth to a son during her absence and he now bore around his neck the Power of Stormhold. With this news, the crowds erupted and celebrated for weeks. It was another eight years before John and Sherlock reached Stormhold though, during which Emma ruled happily. When John did arrive, he was quickly crowned and Sherlock crowned as his queen. They were married and Sherlock made a wonderful ruler. Though John refrained from making many decisions, those he did make were wise and fair. The couple was happy and in love for many years to come. John grew old though and when Death whispered in his ear, he bowed his grey head and passed into the nest life. But Sherlock a Star, did not age as his husband did. His hair remained dark as night, his eyes as piercing as ever and his wits as sharp as the best sword. He walked with a limp for the rest of his days. But, when time permitted, he traveled to the highest peak of the palace and looked out to the stars, watching sadly their eternal dance.
John gave a weak smile, squeezing Sherlock's hand. "I love you too," he managed to breathe out. Before the ambulance arrived, John was gone and Sherlock was in shambles.
As she left, John heard the other guest's horse whinny and kick a few stalls down.
"So you did find the star we saw that night?" Mary questioned curiously.
"Very well.....but....that stone around your neck," Richard commented, brow furrowed.
The pair snuck forward, not wanting to draw the attention of the two beasts causing such noise in the forest. Clearly something was wrong and John was determined to find out what it was. As they grew closer, he saw a beautiful white horse to his left and a massive golden lion to his right. Between them was an ornate crown made of gold, studded with red and blue stones. For some reason, the animals were fighting over it and clearly had been for quite some time. As both stopped to catch their breath, panting heavily, John caught sight of a long, ivory horn spiraling out from the horse's head.
"Sherlock?"
"I know it's fine," Sherlock told him firmly.
And she loved you
"No, no," John insisted, shaking his head. "I'll stay up here with you. Two sets of eyes and two pairs of hands may just be the saving grace of us."
With that, Irene returned to her chariot and rode away, off to find the star once more. Madame Janine was left behind, dazed from her meeting with the far more powerful witch.
"Yes."
John knew exactly what he wanted to do during their private session and headed reluctantly back to his usual class schedule for the rest of the day. He'd never been more eager to get off work and hurried out as soon as his last class had left, getting a cab to Baker Street. Upon arrival, he glanced out and took note of the building. Great location, central London. It couldn't be cheap. But the money wasn't why John was here.
Sherlock turned, raising a brow as he saw the blond coming towards him. Wasn't that... "John," he greeted with a nod. "John Watson, correct? Of the infamous Watson-Holmes feud."
Once he'd made up his mind, there was no stopping John. He did more research than it seemed he'd ever done before, looking at pressure points on the body and yoga poses to help with certain muscles and various ways to use yoga to help treat addictions. While he didn't know what substances Sherlock used, he could at least figure out a general way to approach this and then work from there. There were many articles about how yoga helped recovery, but very few on actual yoga poses that helped. So John created his own regime for Sherlock. They could try it out the next day and if it didn't seem to work, they'd adjust it and try again. But Sherlock needed help and John was just the man for the job.
With that, she returned to her cottage, which was miraculously as it had been before Jim ever touched it. Whether it was restored or unburned, Jim didn't know and didn't really care. His heart stuttered in his chest and, had he been able to, he would've screamed. The venom took its time killing him though, letting him experience absolute agony before Jim was welcomed into his brothers' ranks.
Dressed in a dark Oxford blue suit with a smoke grey tie and matching pocket square, a silver tie pin attached a few inches below his Murrell tie knot and a single red tulip with green leaf embellishment pinned to his left lapel, John made his way down the hall towards the Bride's Room where his soon-to-be husband, the Sherlock Holmes, was getting ready. John's hair was styled back, though he tried to make it look natural. Once he reached the room, he knocked lightly, wanting to announce his entrance.
"My sisters will be harsh, but cruel. However, I appreciate the sentiment. You have a good heart, child. Pity it will not be mine," Irene sighed before leaving.
"I'm searching for a star which fell on the other side of the mountain. When I find it, I will take my knife and cut the heart out of it while it lives, while it's heart is still it's own. For the heart of a living star is a sovereign remedy against all the snares of time and age. My sisters wait for me to return," Irene answered, though clearly against her will.
"I'll show you. Mary, I'm going to bring back the best birthday present you've ever had. And then you'll have to marry me!" john declared. And he knew just what to get her: a star. A star had fallen just a little while ago and he was certain he knew where it had landed. He would find it and bring it back to Mary. And then she'd finally marry him. It would be perfect. So off he set on his adventure.
"Please, reconsider. Think about the benefits it could have for your son. Think about--"
Greg shook his head. "Can't be. John's just a kid. Squirt of a thing," he argued. "Whoever you are, you can't come through. No one comes through from the Lands Beyond."
The unicorn let out a snide harrumph and stamped it's hoof. Clearly it wasn't thrilled by the idea either.
"In the stable, dear, and then help our lovely guest inside for a bath," Irene told the man. "I'll draw her such a nice bath, I will," she added as she went back inside.
John stopped dead in his tracks and turned to the other, brow furrowed. "Who told you that?" he asked.
Sherlock paused, looking over at the other. "That's not what they usually say....."
"I'm telling you, I can't keep walking for very long on this leg!" the star complained.
"What is your problem?!" Sherlock snapped, hissing as he gripped his injured ankle.
"Just trust me," John insisted, waiting patiently until Sherlock finally gave in. "That's what I thought. Now the corpse pose is one of total relaxation, so it can be pretty hard for some people. Especially someone as wound up as you are. So take your time and try not to get frustrated. First, just lie flat on your back, keep your legs straight, and your arms at your side. Keep your hands about six inches away from your body with your palms facing up. You can relax your feet too. Let them fall open."
"Yes?" Sherlock replied, raising a brow.
"Welcome aboard the Free Ship Perdita, our of the Northern Harbours on a lightning hunting expedition. Captain Bill Wiggins, at your service," the captain introduced with a grin. "Martha! Martha! Blast you, where are you?" he began to shout. "Over here! Passengers in need of assistance."
"All right, this one's always a favorite. It's got a couple of different names. Usually either the Dead Bug pose or the Happy Baby pose. I prefer Happy Baby pose, but to each their own," he chuckled before demonstrating the pose. After a moment, he stood and walked through to check everyone's poses. "Good, good, everyone seems to be getting this one. If you're feeling too much pain, let it go. But a little extra stretching is good."
"It feels....nice," he admitted.
"Thank you, madam," Sherlock commented, allowing the man to help him inside and take the unicorn to the stables where it would be dry and well fed.
"I don't believe that's a bird, any more than you were a mouse," Sherlock insisted.
"No, just.....let me...let me say this......
"Whatever was wrong, everything is right now," Sherlock told him.
"There. Perfect for my guest. Now for our trap...." she thought aloud, then turned to the goats. "Right then. You shall become an innkeeper. And you, a pot maid," she decided, casting her spell on each one of the goats and smiling as they became human. "As for your inn..." She turned to the cart and flicked her wrist, but nothing happened. "Oh, I must be getting old! Inanimate objects were always so much harder to change. Their souls are so much older and stupider and harder to persuade." As she continued trying, she finally managed to turn the cart into a proper inn. "There. That's better." She was soon breathless from the effort of it though. "I must be getting old," she sighed.
"We're on a cloud...." he muttered, looking around. "Here, put your hand right here," he instructed, knowing John's hand had gotten burnt from holding the candle as it burned out. The cloud helped relieve some of the pain, the cool air washing over his injured wrist.
The war had been what had sent John home to Sherlock. As much as the detective hated knowing John had suffered through that and was tormented by it throughout his life, he was grateful it had sent John to him. While many went to war expecting to be rewarded and glorified, John had gone simply out of the goodness of his heart. The doctor truly wanted to help people. Both John and Sherlock had gone through periods of reinvention, Sherlock becoming a detective and getting clean after his teenage years while John came home and had to get used to civilian life. When they met and began living together, they seemed to fuse wonderfully. There was a freedom in being so connected and Sherlock loved the attention his talents gained from John. Especially when they went out on cases, each highlighting his talents and John's potential as they worked together. They made quite a few bold moves, though Sherlock was precise in his deductions. Many of the techniques they used to get information were experimental though.
"John?" Sherlock asked worriedly. What was going on? "Is there.......Is there something wrong?" he questioned, then gasped softly. "Oh God.....Oh God, you've changed your mind, have you? .... Which is totally fine by me. Of course, if that's what you wish, John, I.....I will give you what you want. Always. You must know that.
All right, move past it. Something else. Maybe something else is better. So he moved his attention from his shoulders down to his chest. Light curls littered across his chest, barely covering a thing. Hardly sexy, in his mind. John's were a bit darker and there were more of them, actually covering his chest. And then there were Sherlock's nipples, dark pink with a hint of a light brown mixed in there. They were practically minuscule, barely there. John's were gorgeous, especially when he was embarrassed. He blushed all the way down to his chest and his nipples were so plump and easy to tease. So sensitive. Sherlock's.....well, he wasn't even sure he could call them nipples, as tiny as they seemed to be.
"Well, ask me for it and I'll give it to you. I'll be glad to be done with this thing," Sherlock scoffed.
"Where shall we put the beast?" he bleated.
"And what do you propose to do with me? Hello?" Sherlock demanded, climbing into the caravan. Once again, his protests fell on deaf ears.
"Yes, that's me," John answered, still in shock.
"How did you know that?" John asked, raising a brow.
," John murmured. He continued to cry as he spoke, but locked eyes with Sherlock and continued. "We've been through a lot, you and I. We wasted so many chances, so many opportunities. But we waited for each other. For years. Hell, Sherlock, I've been waiting for you all my life. I won't let anything,
"Let the sex holidays commence then!" Sherlock hummed, pressing closer.
"The excitement's over for a bit," Martha chuckled, smiling at their company. "Let's get you below and see if we can't find you something to eat."
"You are a fool, but I appreciate it," Richard chuckled. "I'm Richard. The Lord Richard, actually."
Fusion, freedom, her attention
"Are you waiting for someone, my dear?" she asked.
"Just there, by the fire," Irene told him as she swirled some bath water for him.
"For the last time, Sherlock, I'm your landlady. Not your housekeeper!" Mrs. Hudson scolded, then turned to John. "If you need anything, dear, just shout. I'm right downstairs."
"What have you done with him?" Sally demanded.
"Now, what did I say about breathing?" he scolded, standing behind the other. "Coincidentally" his hips ended up pressed against Sherlock's arse as his hands were placed on the man's chest and diaphragm. "Now deep breath, focus on using your diaphragm."
"Oh, Richie. I cannot hear your impotent curses, but I can imagine them. Now, what's this in your pocket?" he hummed, rifling through the corpse's pockets and pulling out the rune stones with a smirk. "Ah, thank you for the rune stones, brother dear. They will help me find your killer. Now, best foot forward, and all."
"That was me. But I squandered away all the youth I took for the journey. Every act of magic lost me a little of the youth I wore and now I am older than I've ever been," Irene sighed.
"Sherlock!" john laughed. "We're not even married yet!"
"There, young lady, young lad. Martha Hudson will see to your leg and your hand," Wiggins told them. "We eat at six bells. You shall sit at my table and tell me your stories, if you feel at liberty to do so."
"My ruby rose? Never!" Janine refused.
As the flames swallowed the little hut, Jim stepped back with a smirk, satisfied with his work. But as he walked back, he felt a sharp pain prick his heel and hissed, grabbing his heel and looking at the ground. Sure enough, a little snake had bitten him and now slithered back behind a nearby boulder.
From where the snake disappeared, the old woman now emerges with a devious smirk.
Janine's eyes grew wide as the spell was cast, fearing this great woman. "W-who are you?" she stammered.
What does it matter? It's already done!
The bird, who'd been returned to the perch by the caravan, fluttered and chirped as it saw the flower.
"I don't think we're going to make it to our date in time," John chuckled.
"Congratulations then, you two. Hope it's not too much of a media circus," she chuckled. "Don't worry, I'll be the distraught, shocked ex and give them something else to look at for a bit until it dies down. You two behave, yeah?"
John's eyes widened. "You? You're Sherlock Holmes?" he questioned. "Sorry, it's just....I never expected you to look like this. Not that it's bad, I just.....sorry."
"Come in," Mary answered.
"Look, John. It recognizes the flower," Sherlock murmured.
"The Lion and the Unicorn were fighting for the crown. The Lion beat the Unicorn all about the town...." John murmured, recalling an old nursery rhyme. It seemed they all came true past the Wall.
Out in daylight, my potential
"Yes?" Sherlock asked, raising a brow.
Irene eyed her suspiciously before letting out a huff and looking away. "Off with you then," she dismissed.
"Give me your most prized glass flower," Emma demanded.
"Believe me, lovely maiden, this will provide an evening you will never forget," he hummed. "It is a fine stiffener. Take it, as a gift."
"What I need?" Sherlock echoed, furrowing his brow.
"Sherlock, the door was open.... Are you ready? We're about to start," Lestrade commented as he opened the door. Mummy Holmes was right behind him, a grin on her face as she prepared to walk down the aisle with her son. Mycroft was just behind her in his usual three piece suit, though both he and Lestrade had flowers on their lapels to match Sherlock and John's.
Paying the cabbie, the yoga instructor left the cab and knocked on the door, only to be greeted by an older woman with a gentle smile. Not what he'd been expecting, but John was nothing if not flexible.
"Thief!" came an older woman's voice from the direction of the caravan. "I shall turn your bones to ice and roast you in front of a fire! I shall pluck your eyes out and tie one to a herring and one to a seagull so the twin sights of sea and sky shall drive you to madness!"
"Wait, wait, the other stars? But that means....." John started, eyes growing wide. "You're the star? But how?"
"That was you? You, with the knives?" Sherlock asked, furrowing his brow.
Sherlock's eyes grew wide. "No, absolutely not. I'm not marrying him," he replied firmly. "I won't."
With that, she returned to the caravan, ready to face whatever duty the witch had for her now. Sherlock was left to ponder her warning for the rest of the night.
A few minutes later, Mycroft, Greg, and Mummy Holmes were coming down the hall to get Sherlock for the wedding, not even considering that anything could be going on. Who did something they didn't want seen on their wedding day anyway? That was for the wedding night and honeymoon.
Off they went, walking through the grass and the market to get back to the Wall where John had left so long before. But as they grew closer he paused.
"Do you mean it?" Mary asked quietly after a beat.
"What..." Greg began, then chuckled. "Well, now I've seen it all!"
Sorry, I needed a bit of a break. Life happens, unfortunately. But here's the rest of the private session!
"I hurt my hand a bit," John admitted with a shrug.
"No, absolutely not," Mr. Holmes insisted, shaking his head fervently. "You can't marry Sherlock. Not now. Wait until he's older."
Irene accepted the offered mixture of spices, spreading it over her hare before taking a bite. "Perfectly palatable," she commented, licking her lips. "I can taste the thyme and basil, but there's another more unusual taste that I can't quite seem to place."
Before she could say more, Janine's voice rang through the air, screaming for her servant. The woman straightened and gave him a sad smile. "I must go," she whispered. "Look after that boy. But cross into his world at your own peril."
"What do they normally say?" the human asked.
Sherlock eyed his hand before finally shaking it. "Fine. The stars called me Sherlock. I was an evening star."
"I'm sorry. And I won't leave you again."
Who was this man? And why had he suddenly shown up in John's yoga class? He hardly seemed like the type to enjoy yoga or even really care about his health. A quick search revealed far more than John had ever imagined though. Even just the first page was full of results.
James, Richard, and Jim all traveled quickly to find the star, ending up at the same inn for the night. Jim, knowing his elder brother had hired a woman for the night, slipped her a small vial containing a simple mixture before she entered his room.
"Friends?" John began, starting at the obvious point. "People they know. People they like. People they don't like.....Girlfriends, boyfriends...."
Sherlock seemed stunned for a moment. "That's not what people usually say," he admitted quietly.
"Try one of the popsicles I bought last week!" John suggested, finally giving up on trying to have some alone time. He put on the lightest clothing he had and padded out of his room just in time to see Sherlock settling back on the sofa with an orange popsicle. The white wrapper was laid out on the table and Sherlock delicately wrapped his lips around the cool treat.
"Don't be," Sherlock told him firmly. "I'm alive. I was lucky to have fallen in Faerie. I think I was lucky to have met you."
"Amazing," the blond muttered in astonishment.
"Stay where you are!" Lestrade shouted and the pair stopped as John frowned.
"John.......I hate my body," Sherlock admitted, finally turning towards the man. "I hate it. Absolutely loathe it. It's hideous to me and that's why I've never let you see me naked. I want to have sex with you, I do. But I can't stand for anyone to see me naked. I hate seeing myself that way and the idea that anyone could find me attractive once they've seen the whole of me is just implausible."
"And I'm telling you it's a sprain. You can rest as soon as we reach the next town," John huffed back at him. "Why'd you fall anyway? Trip over something?"
"We accept," Sherlock told her, but received no response. It was as though she couldn't even see or hear him.
"Oh, thank you," John responded.
"Very well then, Mary. Why would you not kiss me that night?"
"Then do something else for me now. Ask me why I would not kiss you that night," she demanded.
John shrugged. "A flower. A glass flower," he replied. Janine chuckled, shaking her head.
"Nonsense. Get back to work," Janine told her.
"Oh, that was a good one," Martha commented from beside the guests.
"Right below where your hand is. And diaphragmatic breathing releases tension in the neck and shoulders, causes more efficient gas exchange, re-balances the autonomic nervous system, aids in digestion, and contributes to good posture and core muscle strength," Sherlock interrupted.
"John.......you can't......you can't die......I love you," Sherlock whimpered
Sherlock nodded, though he was still a bit nervous. Maybe John wouldn't like how it looked when he came. Maybe he wouldn't like it when it was hard. Maybe....
"My sword--it's in the carriage--" Richard realized, eyes wide.
I was fine, 'cause I knew
Irene smiled and nodded, going to answer the door. John had already gone to the stables with the horses and Richard was thoroughly soaked.
Sherlock gulped, eyes wide, then nodded. This was a huge step for him, but it had to happen eventually. Maybe John would see his naked body, realise he was right, and leave. That was the only option Sherlock could imagine. But boy was he wrong.
"So, you know people don't have archenemies, right?" he asked as he enjoyed his meal. Hey, he was at least going to have a nice dinner out of this.
John couldn't help but stare though, admiring the detective's lithe figure. He was absolutely gorgeous and in those tight swim trunks......Well, John found himself wishing he'd worn something a little more loose. The man was pale all around with a few scars from his drug use, John presumed. As skinny as he was, Sherlock's muscles were fairly impressive. And watching him dive back into the pool, John couldn't help but be impressed. Perfect form. He looked like the water was his home. Perhaps it helped him think. Regardless of why he did it, he looked perfect doing it. And John had no doubt that would come in handy for his yoga. He was clearly flexible and that would be perfect.
"Get inside. My treasure is riding this way. We simply have to ensure that he will come inside. You are Billy, the owner of this tavern. I shall be your wife. And this dull-eyed girl is Sarah, the pot-maid. Come now," she insisted, ushering them inside.
"You heard me," John replied firmly. "Lie down."
He and John had been together for nearly two years now and he knew John was getting antsy. They had never had sex, not properly. They'd fooled around, giving each other handjobs through their clothes and making each other cum in their pants through various methods. But they'd never been entirely naked with each other. John was willing to strip in front of his lover, even when he was wearing those ridiculous red shorts that were still somehow incredibly sexy. They did show off his package rather well, a few curly blond hairs poking out around the edges. But that was beside the point. He was sure John would want to actually have sex soon and, well.... Sherlock wasn't so sure he could handle it. He wanted it, he did. But he didn't want John to see him naked and there was no way to have it both ways. Either he had to let John see him naked or they couldn't have sex. Not like that.
"No," she admitted. "How is the lad?"
"People talk. That's what they do, John. You know that," Sherlock replied casually when the topic was brought up in their flat. Sherlock was stretched out on the sofa, fingers steepled under his chin as he stared at the ceiling. John, however, was pacing as he stared at the paper.
Mycroft shook his head. "As far as we can tell, he didn't know about your plan. And believe me, we checked everything. He is really dead. We used everything available, but he was already gone. I'm sorry, Sherlock. John Watson is dead. He's to be buried this afternoon."
"That's a yes, right?" Sherlock answered before returning the kiss and spinning John around to snog him against the wall. Before long, the pair had shed their suit jackets and slid down against the wall as they kissed.
"Sir, could you give me a ride through the forest? I'm afraid I've lost my way," John admitted once they'd finished.
He knew quite well that some of his students faked difficulty with some of the poses just so he would touch them and guide them, but he did it anyway just to be a good teacher. If someone needed help, he would do it. After a while, he became well known for being a strict teacher who could properly push people to their limits without being a complete arsehole. He was well liked by everyone at work, employees and students alike.
"Oh, good. We can go."
"Nothing to worry over! Just grab on, we can pull you up," Wiggins insisted. Once they were both on the ladder and holding tight, John called back up and the ladder began to move. The shouting of sailors working to pull them up could easily be heard. Sure enough, they were soon on the deck of the ship, no worse for wear as the sailors set them down gently.
When Sherlock and Mary had first met, the detective hadn't been thrilled. They hadn't gotten along at first and had often been playing a mental and emotional tug of war with John as the prize. Even when John had proposed to Mary, Sherlock fought to be the most important person in his life.
"Which will act as a counterbalance to the lost high I get from the drugs," Sherlock interrupted grumpily, glaring at the doctor. "I'm not going. I'm not quitting. Just release me and let me be."
John sighed, scrubbing a hand over his face. "And what would you know about love?" he huffed.
Even through his own suffering and grief, Sherlock stayed to help raise Rosie. The little girl was so much like John that it sometimes hurt to be around her. Mary understood and did her best to give him space, but they still lived together to make it easier for them both to take care of Rosie. But while everyone else healed and moved on, keeping John in their memories, Sherlock seemed unable to move on. He clung to John's memory, refusing to pack away any of his things. No one was allowed to sit in John's chair. His clothes still hung to the side in his old closet. The detective had never quite gotten back to his old self after John's loss. He refused cases more often than not, though he still worked on good days. Everyone around him was watching, trying to make sure he didn't relapse. But with Rosie around, Sherlock didn't dare touch anything like that.
"But you are under prior obligation, are you not? You have something that does not belong to you, which you must deliver to its rightful owner."
"Whoah!" the driver called as a branch fell in the road. He pulled the reins, stopping the horses just in time. Hopping down, he huffed at the fallen branch and was considering how to move it on his own when John approached.
"What's that?" he questioned, stepping closer. "It's very bright."
"There is no one inside the carriage," Richard replied simply.
John raised a brow as a loud thump sounded. "A woman?" he muttered.
"What companion?" John echoed incredulously.
"My, what sharp knives. They seem to be made of glass, if I'm not mistaken," he commented.
"Coachman? Could you use some help?" he offered, having seen the issue.
Lightening flashed and thunder crashed in the distance as Irene's anger swelled, glaring at the witch before her. "Oh, there is plenty I can do to harm you," she snarled. "For you have stolen knowledge you did not earn. But not to worry. It shall not profit you. For you shall be unable to see the star, unable to perceive it, unable to touch it, to find it, to kill it!"
The woman soon realized that the forms she'd seen after the passing of James the Elder were not living brothers after all. They were the ghosts of the princes these three had killed in order to claim the throne. Screaming at the realization, she ran from the room and as far from the inn as she could.
Sherlock's eyes widened and he shivered, looking to her chain again. "You know, John once bound me with a chain like yours. Then he freed me and I ran from him," he told her. "But then he caught me again and bound me with an obligation, something that holds me much more securely than any chain."
"What other brothers?" Richard inquired. "Never mind, I need to catch up," he sighed, hurrying out of the room to gather his things.
It seemed John continued to stumble over himself through their conversation, but Sherlock seemed to find it endearing rather than annoying. As the night went on, the pair became inseparable. They talked together, danced together, drank together, laughed together. It was incredible. They ended up exchanging phone numbers before Sherlock's parents saw John's friends and chased them and John out of the party.
"Look at you! You took the last of the youth we had saved and you've squandered it!" Sally complained.
John nodded. "Yes, I can see that. I'm not sue how much there is we can do about it though."
"What do people usually say?"
Soon, an older woman with colored blonde hair appeared in a lavender dress, a medical kit at her side. "I'm coming, I'm coming. Keep your beard on," she fussed, approaching the two guests.
"Joooooohn!!!!! I can't get it! Is this right?" the woman crooned, drawing both John and Sherlock's attention. "Is my breathing okay?"
"I can smell it on the wind. The Star is travelling West, right to me!" she laughed chillingly. This was just too perfect. All she'd really have to do is wait.
Making their way through the woods, Sherlock continued to grumble about his leg. John was growing weary, both from travel and from listening to Sherlock complain.
"Thank you, Captain Wiggins," John replied with a nod.
"Rosie," Sherlock murmured, quickly trying to dry his tears. "I.....I thought you were asleep."
You won, and she chose you
"On the other hand..." John hummed, pulling back. "It occurs to me now that I would be better off keeping the flower. My companion and I can walk to the Wall."
Sherlock sighed, not even bothering to look for clothes anymore. He had to come clean and tell John what was going on. It was only fair. He couldn't keep this up for another two years, or for the rest of their lives.
"What's happened?" he asked as the woman gathered her clothes, still in tears.
"Well I don't know any other than 'Please'," John shot back, then looked down as he heard a tinkling. The rope released itself from his wrist, staying bound to Sherlock. "Well all right then. You stay here. I'll have to take you at your honor as a star that you won't run off."
. I love you.....
Sherlock looked a bit nervous, though he plastered on a smile as he waited for John's reaction. But it was hardly what he'd expected. John's eyes grew wide and his hands moved to cover his mouth. He looked almost hurt, a though the sight of Sherlock in a suit had broken his heart. His hands soon moved to cover his eyes as well and it was clear he was crying quietly.
"Sherlock?" John interrupted having stepped forward while Sherlock was talking. Taking Sherlock's face in his hands, he smiled and chuckling softly. "Shut up. Just. Shut up," he insisted. "How can you even think that I could possibly change my mind? I couldn't.....
"Obviously faking. Ignore her. What were you saying?" Sherlock replied, dismissing the woman entirely.
"My future. My destiny. My right to rule. And you?" Richard returned.
Mummy Holmes was absolutely shocked and Mycroft soon escorted her away to prepare for the ceremony. Greg stayed behind to get the two men put back together for their wedding. In the end, the ceremony was lovely and everyone had a good time, though Sherlock pouted for a bit about being interrupted. John made sure to make up for it during the honeymoon though.
"Mmhm. Well.....there are a number of things I must say, John," Mary told him, the words flat and clearly rehearsed. "Firstly, I must apologize to you. It was my foolishness that sent you on your journeying. I thought you were joking, that you were too much of a boy ever to follow up on your fine, silly words. It was only when you had gone and the days passed that I realized you had been in earnest, and by then it was much too late."
"Staring?" Sherlock echoed, then chuckled. "I wasn't staring. I was thinking. I was in my Mind Palace. You clearly don't know who I am. I'm Sherlock Holmes. Youngest of our family," he greeted, shaking John's hand.
"First you slide right into me, now you won't even talk to me? Well you could at least tell me your name," Sherlock scoffed. "It's obvious you came from the other side of the Wall, right? And you're searching for something. Judging by the size of this hole and where you're from, I think it's safe to say you're searching for a star, aren't you?"
"I want to," John told him gently, nuzzling his thigh gently to show him he was sincere. "I'm almost to my favourite part anyway. Now let's see, where were we? Ah, yes. Your feet. Perfect arches and nails trimmed just right. And when you come out of the shower, they're always a little pink from the water," he chuckled, kissing them as well. "And now the best part of all," he hummed with a smile, raising his head to look directly at Sherlock's crotch. His own had been stirring in his pants the whole time as he'd been thinking about this very part of his lover.
You won, and she chose you
"What? No, no, that can't be right. It must have been someone else. Someone who looked like him. Maybe he had a body double. You told him, right?" Sherlock insisted.
"Will you give me what you're carrying?"
The caravan began moving again, heading for the Wall. Inside, Sherlock rested on the bed, completely unaware of how close he'd come to his own demise. It takes another day of traveling before they reach the market and the caravan comes to a stop once more. Janine returned to the cage and removed John from it, returning him to his true form with a touch of the flower.
"Mycroft, go away," Sherlock grumbled. "Hello, Mummy.... Gary."
"I do?" John asked.
"Ah...whoever holds the Power of Stormhold is coming this way, into these mountains. I can intercept them there," he hummed to himself.
John sat up and chuckled a bit, smiling softly. "Is that what this is all about? You thought I was losing interest in you?" he asked, then reached forward and cupped Sherlock's cheek. "Sherlock, I love you. And I always will. Mary doesn't change that. I don't feel a thing for her. But.....let me prove it to you."
"I burned it. In a fire," John answered.
They had a date today, right. And here Sherlock was, completely naked and embarrassed. He finally managed to scoop up his dressing gown, trembling a bit as he put it back on and tied it closed.
Sherlock began putting the pieces together, looking over at the bird.
After all those years, I never thought I'd lose.
"Such rain! You should get inside the coach. No point in both of us getting soaked," Richard told him.
"Oh, you mean.....we'er boyfriends now?" John asked with a smile, then chuckled. "A bit quick, but I admit, nothing about this day has been ordinary. So yes. We're boyfriends now."
