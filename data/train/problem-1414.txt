“I’ll pay you back in a couple of days,” John muttered, not meeting his gaze.
. Come say hi!
The next morning John descends the stairs from his room with trepidation. He’s learned to sense Sherlock’s moods and is 95% sure his flatmate is in one of his sulks, and has been since John turned down his dinner invitation yesterday, though he’s not quite sure why.
“What?” She asked, blinking up at him with wide, innocent eyes, “Isn’t that what Sherlock wants?”
John slid in beside him, laughing.
“How much this time?” he asked, reaching for his wallet.
When he returned, fully alert, to the world of the living Mycroft was seated at the foot of his bed.
(See the end of the chapter for
John frowns. “Why haven’t you got any regular red roses then? They’re traditional. Shouldn’t they be your control group or something?”
“Yes, John’s already been in touch about the coat. I assume you have an opinion on the matter.”
He flagged the waiter down for the check without getting dessert. For her part, Alice took it in stride, though John knew the chance of a second date was almost non-existent.
“What, Sherlock?”
Sherlock tightened his grip in response and shook his head. He probably didn’t need the support anymore but John didn’t need to know that.
John felt his heart flutter as he caught the look of frustration on Sherlock’s face.
-----
Lestrade clicks his tongue impatiently to indicate that he’d rather skip to the facts pertaining to the case instead of listening to the victim’s entire life story, but Sherlock presses on.
He drew the bow across the strings, trying at first to imitate the solemn requiems he’d heard at village funerals, the ones that made flowers bloom in wreaths around the headstones of the dead but it felt forced, too common for the extraordinary life he had lost.
7 February 12:59
There, barely visible behind several bins he sees Sherlock’s slim outline and a mess of dark curls. John breathes a sigh of relief and moves to join him. Then out of the corner of his eye sees a shadow move around the corner. He presses himself against the building and peers out. It’s Winter. And he has a gun.
“No. Go away.” John reaches out as if to hit the snooze button and catches a handful of curls instead.
(See the end of the chapter for
John stopped mentioning the music to his father, learned to tune it out in his presence, but when he found himself alone he let the sounds wash over him, taking comfort in the way the gentle breeze seemed to find and speak to him.
“Hush, Watson. There is much I need to do. I believe you mentioned a patient you had to see this afternoon. Perhaps now would be a good time to attend to him. If you will be good enough to meet me here for supper I would be most grateful for your company.
“I’ll leave you to your deductions,” says Sherlock as he sweeps out the door.
John turned his head and saw Sherlock gazing back at him, the twinkling lights reflecting themselves in his eyes. He was so beautiful, so perfect that even if he’d wanted to, John would have been hard pressed to think of anything else to wish for. That was the thing about this tradition. Under the canopy of pine, surrounded by colourful lights, he found it impossible to say anything but the truth.
Sometimes it was a joyful jaunty tune that brought to mind adventure on the high seas, sometimes the music had a more studied pace, a sense of duty.
John rolls his eyes. “Okay, so what are you doing then? Seeing how long it stays alive? That’s not much of an experiment, is it?”
John continued before Sherlock could properly delve into his mind palace to find the answer. “It was before the sheep case.”
“Everything about your life with me contradicts that statement.”
7 February 12:56
Sherlock continues, “Also, do they look calm? At peace with the world? Ready to die with the great love of their life by their side? Maybe they had a change of heart. Unlikely, if you assume a love suicide or an escape from the law.”
what his name is,” Sherlock said.
A few faint bars of a sonata ruffled John’s hair.
John handed him a piece of paper and Sherlock smiled as he read. Rosie had alternated between red and green crayon with each line. She’d insisted on writing the list on her own, he noticed - the faint pencil outlines that John used to write for her to trace were missing. Sherlock wasn’t familiar with the standard developmental milestones, but young Watson seemed ahead of the curve. He couldn’t help but feel a rush of pride as he read on.
“What if it was the other way around, hmm?” John asks, “Would you want me sitting here ignoring you and feeling guilty or would you want me to say ‘thank you’ and keep you company? Because it’s bloody boring sitting here with no one to talk to.”
“It’s supposed to report back to Santa every night to say if the kid’s been good. Then in the morning it moves to a different place.”
After a moment Sherlock hung up and placed a hand on his shoulder. John raised his head and saw that Sherlock's expression was torn between excitement and...something else he couldn't quite decipher.
Molly was about to put her phone away when the three dots in the corner of the screen caught her eye. She smiled and felt the cold fading away as she crawled beneath the covers and let Toby warm her feet while she waited for the conversation to continue.
As I darted across the road, through traffic I caught sight of his familiar cloak, which stood out against the fitted suits and casual clothing of the people surrounding him.
“But Holmes, what you’re saying is impossible!”
He adds “social experiment” to his search but all he gets are videos of people standing on street corners giving roses to strangers and articles about wooing your date. He hits the back button and returns to his previous search. Several minutes later John finds himself perusing a horticultural directory. He scans the cultivar names looking for a corresponding image that matches the flower on their table but he can’t seem to find it. He breathes a sigh of relief when he sees that the few plants on the list which are named after actual people are nowhere near the same shade as the flower in front of him. Then he scolds himself - first, for being jealous of some hypothetical past lover, and second, for believing, even for a moment, that Sherlock would be that obvious.
Lestrade motions to his team to continue securing the unconscious prisoner then jogs over to them. John smiles feebly up at him and Sherlock repeats his request for an ambulance.
Molly interrupts him, “Of course he does. I’m sure he’s just waiting for...er...something.”
“Take care, John.” Lestrade says, resting a hand briefly on his shoulder, “I’ll look in on you tomorrow.”
“Does that sound like a something you should wish for?”
He wants to ask Sherlock who this person is but can’t bring himself to form the question. Instead he grabs his laptop, props his leg up on the coffee table, and types “floribunda rose” into the search engine. He’s met with images of the ruffly flower in all combinations of colours and patterns.
“And murder apparently,” says Lestrade.
“Like
“Never mind.”
Mycroft tapped his fingers on his stomach, shrugged, then took a seat beside Sherlock and reached for the tin.
“There is simply no other logical explanation,” he said, “We have already determined that we are not asleep. Nor, judging by that woman’s attire, is the entire world participating in an elaborate charade put on solely for our benefit.”
He stopped but didn’t turn. He couldn’t bear to face John, to see the pity in his eyes, the rejection. He felt John close the distance between them until he was standing barely a foot away.
Molly opened the door to her flat with a sigh and shook the snow from her coat. It had been a long day, followed by a tedious evening out with a group of her old school mates. It wasn’t that she didn’t enjoy spending time with them - she just didn’t need the constant reminder that she was almost 40 and still single. Jenny’s boyfriend had proposed the week before (What was it about people getting engaged during the holidays?) and the entire night, the conversation had alternated between talk about the upcoming wedding and speculating about when “Little Miss Perfect” would finally find a man.
John cringed. He should know by now to have extra cash on hand any time Sherlock was summoned to appear in court but he was low on funds until his next paycheck.
“How do you -” Lestrade begins, then shakes his head, “Never mind. No, they didn’t remove anything else.”
John looks up at her in surprise. She chuckles and hands the old roses to John, who places them into a jar and sets them aside in case Sherlock wants to keep them for some reason.
“You are to me.”
Ever since John was a child he could hear things other people couldn’t - a whisper on the wind, a melody in the afternoon breeze, a quiet sonata drifting through the silent midnight hours.
“What?” John asked, a mix of annoyance and amusement in his voice.
“I can think of no way to help the unfortunate Mr. Wilde. But cheer up, dear boy. It seems we have a client. Let us pray he has something interesting for us.”
The usual clutter of Sherlock’s experiments is absent from the table. In its place is a single rose. Granted, it’s in a graduated cylinder instead of a vase, but still. It seems almost ordinary, which is unusual in 221B.
“Thanks, Angelo.”
John feels as if he’s only just dropped off to sleep when Sherlock is shaking him awake again.
John laughed.
-----
“Hi John,” she added.
It’s not for lack of desire. He wants to. God, he

“On the fridge,” John says, nodding toward it as he drops his dishes in the sink.
Sherlock turned to add a gumdrop to the path that led to his house.
“Holmes!”
Beside me Holmes was turning on the spot, his eyes wide with wonder at the towering city that had evolved around us.
The door swings open and the doctor enters, followed by Sherlock and an extremely disgruntled nurse.
“Why not?”
Finally he settled on telling Rosie about one year when he and Harry were little. They’d ended up going to their Aunt’s house up north and, upon discovering she owned a pair of huskies, tied their leashes to the front of a sled and tried sliding down the hill. They’d managed to get about 10 feet before the sled rolled sideways and the dogs broke free and ran back to the house. They’d gotten quite a scolding but, once that was over, discovered that the dogs were good partners for playing hide and seek.
On the way over to Hampstead, Sherlock’s fingers tapped rapidly at his phone. It seemed that DI Stella Hopkins had been called out to investigate multiple break-ins on a single street, none of which had any clue to the intruder. While Sherlock scrolled through a street view of the area and pulled up the backgrounds of the residents, John sat beside him, blood ringing in his ears. He couldn’t tell if he was angry at Hopkins, annoyed at Sherlock for taking the case, or relieved that he’d quite possibly avoided a painful rejection.
“Exactly,” Sherlock said, as if that explained everything, then let Rosie climb up onto his shoulders and led the way down the path, following the pine scented trail.
“The ice really wants to be my friend.”
“Case,” he said without looking up, and pushed some packets of ice into the empty spaces in the freezer.
One night after everyone else was in bed Major Sholto found him lying on the ground several yards away from camp, staring up at the sky. He expected a reprimand for breaking curfew but instead his commander settled in beside him.
“Of what could have been?”
Sherlock seemed to be the only person in his village interested in science. Why build a machine to regulate temperature when the ice and fire players could do that easily enough? Still, there were a few teachers who were willing to tell him anything he wanted to know and who opened his eyes to things he never knew existed. Sherlock never cared that these people were among those shunned by society because they hadn't learned to properly play an instrument or harness their voice to control the elements.
John shook his head and looked up at Alice. “Sorry. It’s just Sherlock. I’ll turn it off.”
It began five days ago with a call to investigate the deaths of Alexandra and Howard Garrideb. It looked like a standard love suicide but within seconds Sherlock deduced that the victims had never met before. Then we learned that the IDs found in the car with them were fake and it became apparent that this wasn’t a suicide. It was murder. So, who were the Garridebs and why were they killed?
Sherlock half-rises to help him up the stairs but John shakes his head and insists, perhaps a little too roughly, that he’s fine. Sherlock frowns over the striped flower but bids John good night and watches him retreat into the hall.
“You really care about him, don’t you?” She said.
Sherlock had called this a ‘social experiment’ but this creates more questions than it answers. What could drugged flowers have to do with...what was it he said, ‘the effect of symbolism on interpersonal relationships’? Could Sherlock be asking-?
Eventually he shrugs. “They’re pending.”
It’s always worse in the mornings. Something about the transition between sleep and waking seems to disorient Sherlock and even with John there it takes him a while to comprehend the reality of where he is.
Mycroft examined the drawing. “Those buttons don’t look functional.”
“My dear Watson,” Holmes interjected, “not all men think the same way you do.”
“Sherlock?” John asked.
Sherlock sighs in annoyance and stalks over to the sink, dropping his dishes in with an alarming clatter.
John sighed. Now that the day was over and he had no more patients to focus on, his mind automatically replayed the events of the previous evening. The candlelight, their conversation, his hand on Sherlock’s. He’d been so sure in that moment, so ready to take the plunge, to ask if they could be something more, but then Sherlock had run off on a case, without a second thought. And John didn’t know what to feel.
John’s breath catches in his throat but then he feels the mattress shift as Sherlock rolls over to face away from him and he knows better than to reach out this time even as Sherlock sniffles quietly into the blankets.
“Hmm…” Holmes stared over my shoulder watching the crowd. Women in short skirts and high heels and men in cut-off trousers and sandals passed in pairs or small groups.
paper money. It was starting to look like the Garridebs case was connected to another case DI xxxxxxxx was working on. You know those reports in the paper about the counterfeit bills popping up across London? Yup, turns out that her client, Jonathan Evans (not his real name obviously) was involved with this somehow.

“What, because you’ve not had to stay there overnight? It still counts!”
Holmes fell silent, fingers steepled beneath his chin, hesitating for the briefest of moments. Then he placed both hands on my face and brought his lips to mine.
Hours later they’re still sorting through the records with no progress to show for it. The sky outside the windows turns orange, then pink, then darkens to a deep blue. Lestrade checks his phone, frowns, and turns back to the autopsy and forensics reports. Both confirm that the victims died of carbon monoxide poisoning with no sign of a third party present but contain no insight into the Garridebs’ elusive identities.
Then he kisses him softly in the slanting morning sunlight spilling across the room.
“Holmes!” I reached for my companion, pulling him out of the way as the lights continued their dance and a pack of carriages surged forward. “Where on earth are we?”
Molly smiled. She knew there was a running pool at the Met about when those two idiots would finally get together. Greg had apparently put his money on the week between Christmas and New Year’s.
“You know I’m not that kind of girl,” she teased.
“I asked my mother to send over her recipe,” Sherlock said, “I forgot she had to take Mycroft’s cookie consumption into account when she used to make these. He always ended up eating the equivalent of a gingerbread
As always, thanks for reading!
“It’s not about a case Sherlock.”
Since then Sherlock’s been hovering around the flat making sure I have everything I need, which is very sweet but I finally convinced him I could look after myself for a few hours while he went down to Scotland Yard to find out what happened with the case.
“Come on, I can make it downstairs at least. I’ll let you help me if it makes you feel better.”
Inside with the door closed, the darkness was disorienting and I found myself wishing I had thought to bring a lantern. But Holmes, seeming to read my thoughts, wrapped a hand around my wrist and led me forward until my eyes adjusted to the faint moonlight seeping in through the openings near the ceiling. In the center of the room was a dias in which a trapdoor stood open revealing a set of stairs. Holmes’s eyes found mine. I nodded and we descended the stairs together.
John turns back to Mycroft, “Wait, what?”
“Hey,” John said softly, laying a hand on his arm, but Sherlock rose, mumbled something about sleep and retreated to his bedroom, closing the door behind him. It was childish, he knew, but he couldn’t quite bring himself to care.
“This is dull,” Sherlock declares.
“I’m fine, John.”
Sherlock stirred but did not immediately open his eyes. He leaned closer to John and his head shifted on the pillow, causing a few wayward curls to fall across his forehead.
No sooner had these words left his mouth than the landlady appeared at the sitting room door with a card upon a tray. I glanced at it and did a double take. It wasn’t unusual for the aristocracy to seek assistance from my friend but I could not imagine what services the Marquess of Queensberry could require. The coincidence of his visit immediately following our discussion of his involvement in the Oscar Wilde trials was unsettling.
John raised an eyebrow and Sherlock continued in answer to the unasked question.
“You’ve got to stop going through my wardrobe.” John mutters as he shuffles off to the bathroom to change, though he has to admit that it’s much more efficient this way.
This must be it, he thinks, after several minutes of searching. He clicks the link and finds the definition of red roses just as Sherlock read out all those months ago. This time though he continues to scroll down the page. Yellow roses are for friendship. He’d already known that - once he had made the mistake of giving one to a girl because he thought it was her favourite colour and she’d burst into tears thinking he was breaking up with her.
He didn’t mind as much as he thought he would though. The music on the wind was just as beautiful, and so much more intriguing than even the most celebrated violinists John could find in this world. And whispering his problems into the wind like a quiet prayer was easier than returning to the house where his sister snuck out the window every night to see her girlfriend, leaving John alone to deal with a father who refused to accept his children for anything but “normal” and a mother who had given up on reality.
“At home with Mrs. Hudson,” said John, “Hopefully asleep by now.”
The earnest look on Sherlock’s face made John laugh in spite of himself. The corners of Sherlock’s mouth twitched up they spent the rest of the ride giggling uncontrollably, much to the confusion of their cabbie.
Sherlock shrugs. “Just returning the favour, Greg.”
“I thought we were quoting Oscar Wilde. He’s all over the papers.”
John is sitting close enough that he can hear Lestrade’s excited voice through the earpiece, “Sherlock, the property was paid for in cash.”
“Oh come on, Sherlock. I’ve known both of you for years and it’s -”
He hesitates for a second then rests his arm across Sherlock’s shoulders. Sherlock finally looks up, perhaps surprised by this new closeness.
Of course, he knew ignoring Sherlock wouldn’t work for long and sure enough, a steady stream of text alerts punctuated the conversation as they worked their way through the appetiser sampler.
John reluctantly forces his eyes open and sees Sherlock sitting on the coffee table, already wearing his coat and scarf, with a pile of John’s clothes beside him.
“Sorry about this,” he said as they stood outside, unsure what else he could say.
Holmes’s eyes slid closed and his hands came to rest beneath his chin as he slipped into the only place I could never follow - his brilliant and unpredictable mind.
“You’re not the one who punched the Superintendent,” John said, a flicker of amusement crossing his face.
, for the first time in ages. But now? Loyalty? Yes. Friendship? Certainly. But as they climbed the stairs to 221B, John couldn’t shake the nagging feeling that there was something more.
As they emerge from a dense patch of buildings Sherlock brings them to a halt, head tilted back, face to the sky. John follows his gaze, scanning the rooftop before realizing that Sherlock is actually looking beyond it at the stars.
He felt Sherlock shift beside him and turned on his side so they were facing each other. Sherlock’s pale eyes were visible in the faint light from the window.
“You’re staring.”
“How do you know there were carolers?” asked Stella.
“Did you get arrested just to ask me to be with you?” Sherlock asked.
“Some sort of reaction,” Sherlock says, “Preferably a reciprocal one, though I suppose any sort of response would be a result nonetheless.”
“There’s only one bed,” John said, the moment he opened the door, too tired and hungry to care that he was stating the obvious.
“Who is he?” John asks.
“Why me?”
The photo was far too dark to see their faces but Molly could imagine the way Sherlock was looking at John in that moment. It had been like that since the very beginning, back when she’d dreamed that he would look at her that way. And now it seemed like they were the only two people in the world who didn’t recognize how much the other loved them.
Then suddenly it fits - all Sherlock’s questions about John’s life, the unnecessary deductions of things he already knew, his lingering over John’s blog, the frequent touches and the way he visibly relaxes when John returns to the flat.
“Rosie?”
-----
“So, where is this place?” he asked.
“So, did he have - ” he started to ask, but Greg cut him off.
“Let me watch you, I’ll figure it out.”
Now it’s John’s turn to try to catch Sherlock’s eyes as the latter stares at a large crack in the concrete.
They made their way to the towering spruce tree in the corner. The upper branches were draped with garlands but the lower ones were hung with colorful baubles that each of the children had decorated the week before. They searched for Rosie’s and eventually found the glittery silver orb facing the window as though the bright red flower Rosie had drawn on it was reaching for the setting sun.
John cradled his mug of peppermint tea in his hands as he nudged open the door to the upstairs bedroom. Rosie was laying on her stomach surrounded by paper and crayons, writing her letter to Santa. She had insisted on writing it herself this year and John was both proud and a little sad about how quickly she was growing up.
John highly doubted it, but took the opportunity to scroll quickly through his messages. This had become a sort of accidental game over the past couple of years. At first John had found Sherlock’s near constant stream of texts when he was on a date infuriating, but somewhere along the line, Sherlock had figured out that instead of insulting John’s dates (which always backfired because John tended to dig his heels in just to spite him), he could send tantalizing hints of an interesting case to seduce John away from nearly any woman he happened to be seeing at the time.
Sherlock lowers his bow, “John.”
“John insists on letting her believe in Father Christmas, so it’s my job to make it somewhat convincing.”
Thanks Mrs. H. What would we do without you?
John sighed. Sometimes dealing with Sherlock was like having a child, especially when he fixated on details like this. “Roses are sort of a universal symbol of romance,” he replied. Anticipating another ‘but why’ question he continued, “Dunno why. Ask the floral industry.”
“A good case.”
Eventually he gives up trying to convince Mrs. Hudson that he’ll be moving back upstairs and allows her to redecorate the bedroom, though he persuades her to keep the patterned wall paper contained to one wall. The idea of being surrounded by dozens of airborne pachyderms is a bit alarming.
John’s phone buzzes with a reply. “I stole Lestrade’s ID again. He was being annoying.”
“Good night, Sherlock.”
“Home,” he said.
“Holmes?” I whispered, “Where did Ross go?”
“The parents are supposed to move it to a different spot every night.”
Sometimes they’ll collapse on the couch together where Sherlock lets his head fall into John’s lap and sighs in contentment as John runs his fingers through his hair. But more often than not they spend their evenings sorting through evidence from some new case until John’s eyelids are heavy with sleep. Eventually he’ll get up to plant a kiss atop Sherlock’s unruly curls before dragging himself upstairs wishing that the criminals of London would have mercy on him and take a collective vacation for one night so he can take his boyfriend to bed with him.
“Oh hello dear, do you have a date tonight?” She nods at the roses in his hands.
“Sherlock, I don’t know what you’re thinking, but I’m not going to leave. Not for a girl, not for anyone.”
As always, thanks for reading! And extra thanks to those of you who left comments and kudos. Love you all <3
“Have your least idiotic officers search the area. And make sure Molly does the autopsy. You know where to find me.”
John’s actually not bad at googling things. It’s just really hard to find this specific cultivar if you only search for “floribunda rose” without knowing the specific name beforehand. What you do find easily is all those other names I included (yes, those are real names of roses). I happened to stumble across the fusilier rose when I was looking up info on another rose variety (which appears in the next chapter) and just had to include it.
To be fair, it was sort of a team effort.
Sherlock shook his head. “It was...nice. Besides, I know you like holiday traditions.”
“They won’t,” Sherlock says, “You’re still missing one key thing...unless your lot have taken that too, which I don’t doubt, given their incompetence.”
John thinks. He opens his laptop and pulls up the old searches. Luckily he’s been a bit lax about clearing his browser history though this means he has to sort through pages of strange searches from times when Sherlock couldn’t be arsed to walk an extra five feet to get his own laptop.
Despite the cold rain still falling outside, Greg felt himself warming up as they left the shop huddled under Molly’s sunflower umbrella.
“What can we do for you?”
(See the end of the chapter for
Instead of answering, Sherlock stands and pulls on his coat. “I’m going out.”
“The key, Watson. He needed a key to get in. Ghosts don’t exist and if they did they wouldn’t need keys to enter a house for the dead.” He seemed to be trying to convince himself as much as he was trying to reassure me.

As we left the cemetery and made our way along several streets, I realized the noises I was hearing were not those of the city I knew. There were still sounds of drunken laughter and the whisper of conversations. But instead of hearing the clip clop of hooves and the clatter of wheels we heard blaring horns and a cacophony of strange music.
“You choose a place.” John says, his throat tight, “One where you won’t be interrupted.” He senses Sherlock trying to meet his eyes but averts his gaze.
The edges of Sherlock’s mouth twitched upward.
“Said she needed to finish helping Mrs. Hudson,” John chuckled, “Don’t know how helpful she’s actually being but Mrs. H said it was fine.”
“Of course. She was annoyed because you couldn’t spend the night since we had to leave early the next morning.”
“What, you’re not going to bother deducing it?”
John continued walking for a few feet before he realized that Sherlock wasn’t beside him anymore. When he turned, Sherlock was no longer staring at his phone, but at John. An odd look crossed his face.
In case anyone's interested,
“It’s nothing.”
“Relax, John, it’s just water.” Sherlock says, “Plants need water to keep them alive, though of course, a more effective way of doing so would be to leave the root system intact, but for some reason society dictates that we rip flowers from the ground and sentence them to a short, if superficially beautiful, life.”
Sherlock waves his hand dismissively then turns away to rearrange the roses on the table. He lapses into silence and John eventually gives up and goes back to reading.
“This is becoming a bad habit.” John said, breaking the silence.
She nodded and walked away to look at a bird that alighted on a low-hanging branch.
“What aren’t you telling me.”
“Mmm.”
“Doing alright, John?” Lestrade asks while Sherlock makes a show of clearing a space to lay the rose on the bedside table.
Then John laces their fingers together and whispers all the things he wants Sherlock to remember when waking. As he does, his mind replays everything in their past, good and bad, that has brought them to this point. As he reaches the end of his list he finds the courage to finally add one more thing - something he should have said weeks, months, maybe years ago.
“I’m out, aren’t I?”
Sherlock gave a sharp nod then turned away, drawing the bow slowly across the strings.
“Of course I want this,” he murmurs against Sherlock’s lips, “I’ve wanted it for ages. I just didn’t know if you wanted it too.”
Sherlock keeps his face buried against the back of the sofa but John knows better than to think he’s sleeping. He bends to examine the rose. It’s yellow - bright, cheerful and friendly, a sharp contrast with the tension radiating from his sulking flatmate.
John nodded.
16 December 21:17
John shrugged, “Apparently it’s a tradition now. Part of the whole waiting for Santa thing.”
“Not one to mix business with pleasure,” she nodded approvingly, “I respect that, but it’s alright if
For those of you who don't know, I totally ship Molly and Lestrade. She deserves better than whatever was going on in TFP and he deserves someone who won't cheat on him. Don't worry, we'll be back to our Baker Street boys later tonight. (or possibly tomorrow morning, depending on what time zone you live in.)
The date had started off well enough - pleasant small talk, promising hints at what the night had in store. It was all going smoothly until his date had commented on his tie, joking that it matched the painting hanging above their table. Without thinking John had blurted out that Sherlock had picked it out for him. The look she had given him, a cross between jealousy and resignation, had him wishing that the lava cake, which arrived seconds later, was real lava so it could swallow him up and bury him along with that stupid tie.
. Just don't be like Sherlock and ruin anyone’s important papers ;)
“Because I can’t teach both of you at the same time.”
“For Christ’s sake!” Lestrade says, slamming his cup down on the table, “It’s like dealing with a child. Either tell me you’ve got something new for us or go home. This isn’t your playroom.”
Still, there was nothing more we could do at the moment so we went back home for the night. I was looking forward to sleeping but of course Sherlock figured something out at 3am and dragged me back to the warehouse to have a look. Turns out there was a hidden trapdoor behind a stack of boxes and inside, a couple of machines set up to print counterfeit bills!
“He’d probably want more eyeballs to experiment on,” he said automatically before remembering he was addressing his four-year-old daughter, “Wait, no. You can’t write that.”
Sherlock wondered. John hadn’t mentioned anyone new lately and Sherlock quickly ruled out the possibility that Sarah had decided to give him another chance. If it had been anyone from work, a shared ending time would mean a later reservation, given the fact that most women would want more time to get ready.
“John?” Sherlock asked, wavering between confusion and concern.
Sherlock is unusually quiet as they eat, and John makes it to the entertainment section of the paper before he feels the need to break the silence.
“Well, for one, it’s a waste of money.”
“Leave it, John.”
“Well, another flower then. Perhaps if you found one that more accurately expresses your intentions instead of lying to your dates they’d be more inclined to continue their romantic association with you.”
I glanced around at the myriad of lighted symbols. The one closest seemed to be a bright red hand. As I stared, it changed to a white silhouette of a man. Trios of circular lights alternated between green, yellow and red. Other illuminated signs flashed words and phrases in various colours.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Where are we going?” I asked.
Meaning of pink roses: love, gratitude, appreciation. Light pink has a more sympathetic message and is a common choice to send as a get well soon present.
Greg turned in a circle. There was the oak tree whose roots Rosie was balancing on and several maples, but no pine.
It had taken Sherlock no more than an hour to deduce that the swaps had been done as part of an experiment by a scientist studying the behavioral and social patterns of sheep, and by the time they’d managed to track him to a condemned property, it was still only mid-afternoon. But of course, Sherlock had to go and be Sherlock, which resulted in him being arrested along with the sheep scientist under suspicion of collusion and trespassing. So instead of enjoying a nice dinner, John found himself arguing with the local police force, trying to convince them that Sherlock was more help than harm. He suspected Sherlock’s constant stream of deductions about the arresting officer hadn’t helped his case.
The music settled into a slow melody of wavering tears and John remained there until the wind quieted itself to a gentle breeze that stayed with him as he walked home.
As he was leaving, John spotted Lestrade in a heated discussion with a well-built middle-aged man, who he assumed was the Superintendent.
As the ground levels out Winter twists and manages to land on top of him. John hears a crack, feels a sharp pain in his ankle and cries out. He must have loosened his grip because Winter has scrambled to his feet and is already several yards away, following the curve of the river downstream. The next second, Sherlock is there, leaping on Winter from above like a great bird of prey, cloak flying out behind him. As he wrestles the gun from Winter’s hands his eyes meet John’s for a second, sharp grey clouded with worry, then he knocks the butt of the gun against Winter’s skull. Winter slumps forward from the blow and Sherlock rushes to where John is curled, cradling his ankle.
“Did you find something?” Sherlock asks without preamble.
“I’m not the one full of nostalgia right now,” Sherlock pointed out, “Besides, I see Mycroft far too much for my liking.”
“She wanted to ask Santa for a nice murder for you,” John explained, his expression flickering between disapproval and amusement.
“If I remember correctly, you and your sister were forced to wear horrible matching outfits in yours.”
Sherlock made a faint noise of disbelief and John continued.
John’s heart stops as he sees the gun aimed at Sherlock who is still squinting around in the darkness, keeping careful watch on the warehouse door. He doesn’t think, just sprints straight at Winter and tackles him, knocking him sideways, and together they tumble down the embankment. John feels Winter struggle against him then the gun fires somewhere to the left of his head. He hears the shot ricochet off the gravel and Sherlock’s anguished cry of “John!”
“Fine. Molly was going to take Rosie shopping tomorrow anyway, so you and I are going ice skating.”
He walked over to stand beside Sherlock.
Instead, John ducked behind a large potted plant and waited, peering through the leaves at the front door. Minutes later he saw a tall, curly-haired figure being led out the front door in handcuffs.
“No point.”
John rolled his eyes and pressed speed dial. Sherlock answered almost immediately.
John frowns. “Today’s Tuesday. And you’re definitely not asleep.”
When Sherlock doesn’t respond he presses on, “Why all the different colours?”
“Any luck finding Evans?” Sherlock asks when they return, his eyes sweeping over the information on the papers and screens scattered around the table.
“Is he doing okay?” Lestrade asks. “After...everything…”
Sherlock pulls out his phone and starts tapping away. John leans back in the passenger seat but jolts upright when he feels his phone vibrate. He pulls it out and sees a text:
(See the end of the chapter for
John pushes the door open and gasps. Sherlock is nowhere to be seen but the room is full of flickering candles that illuminate a trail of rose petals. John follows them down the hall to Sherlock’s bedroom. The door opens as he reaches it and Sherlock emerges wearing a tight purple shirt and dark slacks that hug his body in all the right places. John lets his eyes slide up and down Sherlock’s lean form barely noticing the single red rosebud in his hand.
The girl glanced from Holmes to myself, and gave us a curious smile before hoisting her bag onto her shoulders and continuing along the path.
The music returned the day John was deployed to Afghanistan. At first he didn’t hear it over the hum of the engines, then he thought it was just the exhaustion and the desert heat playing tricks on him. But slowly the disjointed notes coalesced into chords and a soothing rhythm emerged to ease his tired mind. That night as he drifted off to sleep with the wind singing outside the barracks he felt more complete than he had in years.
At five years old Sherlock’s violin concertos were the most beautiful anyone had heard in living memory but he couldn’t light fires like his father did when his fingers flew across the strings of his guitar. Nor could he divert water with the lilt of his voice like his mother. Sherlock wanted more than the gentle breeze that flowed from his strings and disappeared quickly into thin air. Try as he might he couldn’t make the wind do his bidding.
“Then what’s the point?” Sherlock asked, handing it back to John.
Sherlock thought back to his conversation with Greg during their last case. He knew about the pool at the Met that had been reinstated after John had moved back to Baker Street. It seemed that Greg had finally decided to put money down and his chosen date must be approaching rapidly; it was usually Molly who asked those sort of things, not him. Sherlock didn’t care that Greg now had confirmation about his feelings for John, but it wouldn’t make this evening any easier.
He nodded.
At this, John turns toward the roses on the table and sees that a white one was added overnight. His movement does not go unnoticed by Mycroft who follows his gaze, raises an eyebrow, then looks from John to Sherlock.
Back at the Yard, Lestrade has buried his team up to their elbows in data. They spend the remainder of the afternoon and evening looking closely at Saunders and Prescott’s phone logs, emails, and anything else they can get their hands on but nothing new jumps out at them. Without any evidence at the warehouse they’ve reached a dead end.
did you want to interrupt my date?”
Once she was asleep John laid back on his bed, staring at the ceiling, watching the flickering shadows from the nightlight.
Red rose meaning: a true love that is stronger than thorns and can outlive all obstacles. The red rose expresses the throbbing heat of new love, a passionate expression of attraction. Red is the color of consummation, of raging desires and craving passion. [
“Nope. Using the wall as target practice is you being bored. Why were you so determined to get my attention?” John wasn’t sure why he was pressing this. He knew the sort of answer he was hoping for, but he didn’t expect -
“It’s from Rosie. You can open if now if you like.”
to happen.”
Before my brain had quite processed what was happening he pulled back and gave me a searching look, possibly trying to deduce what I was thinking.
He entered university, tried to focus his mind on something concrete, but his professors were morons and the labs had all sorts of regulations that prevented him from discovering the melting point of eyeballs and other body parts.
Sherlock was bored. The criminals of London had apparently chosen this week to be more mediocre than normal and the only messages on the website were people asking if their spouse was cheating, (the answer was yes), whether their bookkeeper was stealing from their business (also yes), and if he would please help find a lost tortoise (no). To add to his frustration, John had decided that going out on a date was more interesting than helping him find a new case.
“I will consider it,” Holmes said, “In the meantime, might I suggest you have another look around your residence. Perhaps check under the mattress. You’d be surprised how many lost objects are found in the place where we lay our heads at night.”
“Ah, Dr. Watson,” Mycroft says, “good of you to join us. Perhaps you can add some much needed rationality to the room.”
“It’s because of me isn’t it?”
When they reached the restaurant however, there was a sign posted on the door indicating that the owners had been on vacation since the end of November and that they would be open for business again next weekend
“Why did
“Can’t say that it does,” Holmes murmured, glancing over the rest of the cover story.
. Come say hi!
“Thanks, Mrs. Thompson, but no.”
-----
He disappears between the buildings and John turns to Lestrade.
She led the way over to a house mid-way down the street.
Still, this isn’t about him and whatever Sherlock needs, John promised himself he would give it. So he pushes aside his own feelings, pulls back the covers and slides into the empty space in Sherlock’s bed.
“Maybe you could play something a bit more festive,” John said, “it’s supposed to be a party, after all.”
Sherlock nods and reaches for his phone as Lestrade swipes back to the photo of the real estate agent.
John supposed it was partially his fault. He’d disappeared upstairs as soon as they’d returned home from the case last night, knowing that Sherlock wouldn’t follow for fear of waking Rosie. Then he’d left without saying goodbye that morning. It was a cowardly move, but John hadn’t been able to face him just yet. What if he’d been wrong. Maybe Sherlock didn’t need more than John’s friendship so long as he had his work to keep him happy.
“I mean it, Dr. Watson,” she says. “Besides, I’m sure my boyfriend would be the same way if anything ever happened to me.”
“Hmm?”
“Yeah, he’s here. I know. Less than 20 minutes, that’s gotta be a new record.”
This new arrangement seems to help though. Something about John’s presence in his bed allows Sherlock’s mind to relax. He seems moderately well-rested now, if not completely at ease, and for that John is grateful.
Sherlock turns to the line of roses and runs his fingers lightly over them one by one.
He tugged at his tie again then pulled it off. It still didn’t look quite right. Behind him Sherlock rose from the sofa, stepped over the coffee table and in four long strides made his way to John’s side.
It was a simplified answer but it was the best he could think of. He continued, “Sherlock doesn’t want anyone dead. But he likes to solve the mystery of how it happened. That’s why he was excited. Understand?”
John just shrugged, “This is how mum and dad taught us.”
Mycroft raised an eyebrow.
“I’m sorry,” he said, “I didn’t mean anything by it. She’s not just my daughter and I love that she’s interested in your work.”
Then he scooped Rosie up and headed toward Baker Street before he could change his mind.
Don’t you read the papers? The counterfeit cases have been in the news for several months because that’s how long Scotland Yard takes to solve anything on their own. If you’d bothered to do any research you would know that banks check their bills before dispensing them. It is highly unlikely that a bank, even one idiotic enough to accept counterfeit notes, would be unable to detect them before they are released back into circulation.
Sherlock shrugged and continued watching John. There was no point denying Molly’s implications but he couldn’t bring himself to look at her and see the pity in her eyes.
Lavender Rose meaning: love at first sight. Also shares some of the symbolism of the fabled blue rose: mysterious and unattainable.
Sherlock turned and met his gaze, uncertainty in his eyes, but he let John lead him back toward the bed.
“It’s basic physics,” Sherlock said, glancing at the teenagers zipping past them, “I’m sure I can figure it out.”
Lestrade chuckles and shakes his head. “I can’t believe you, of all people, are giving me dating advice.”
“It’s in your top right drawer, third from the back,” Sherlock called after him.
“What have you got in there?” he asks.
“One of the Magi,” John replied.
Sherlock opens his mouth then closes it again. For once his desire to always have the last word seems to have been overridden.
“Well, aren’t you?”
“John, is there anything you need?”
7 February 12:51
Her phone pinged with another text.
So the police got a warrant to search the property, which was a warehouse near the river, and we tagged along only to find...nothing! There was nothing in the warehouse except some old furniture, dust and abandoned boxes. But Sherlock had that look in his eye that he gets when there’s a really good puzzle that he thinks only he can solve.
He turns instead to Lestrade who seems frustrated with more than just the case.
“Why roses though?”
John stifled a laugh as he hung up the phone. Poor Greg. He wondered how many badges the DI had lost over the years to Sherlock.
“I need to talk to the residents,” Sherlock said, “All of them.”
He hears Sherlock shuffling around in the kitchen and takes a few deep breaths in an attempt to calm himself down. However, this plan backfires because with each inhale John breathes in the scent of
I decided to go back to the previous chapters and add the meanings of each color in the notes so feel free to go back and check those out if you hadn't looked them up already.
Sherlock shook his head. “No, that doesn’t make sense. If it was about security they wouldn't have gone through so many. They'd have just targeted the house on the end and let the others be.”
Sherlock had called this “an examination of the effect of symbolism on interpersonal relationships”.
He glided several yards forward then turned gracefully to face Sherlock.
“What?” Asked Alice.
John frowned and scrolled up, reading through the conversation.
“What is that?” John asked, “It sounds familiar.”
After wandering the streets for several hours without any sign of Robbie Ross, Holmes and I settled in to rest under one of the many bridges spanning the Thames. The number of unfamiliar structures alone made me wonder exactly how many years had passed, if indeed we had somehow traveled into the future. As fantastic as it seemed, I found myself accepting Holmes’s claim as fact while the sounds of the city rumbling around us lulled me to sleep.
Lestrade wastes no time getting a warrant for the warehouse and a couple of hours later they’re standing outside the old building at 136 South River Road. Lestrade is practically bouncing on the balls of his feet with the anticipation of closing not just one, but two big cases.
He gazed at the card wistfully. He had wanted kids. Maybe if his ex-wife hadn’t cheated on him repeatedly and blamed it on his busy schedule, or maybe if he’d had the courage to let her go sooner, he might have a family of his own to spend Christmas with.
“What about Sherlock?”
He could hardly dare to believe that John meant what he hoped he did. He reached for John’s hand tentatively. If he was right, maybe this was the encouragement John needed; if he was wrong, well…
They keep at their vigil in silence - Lestrade is watching for a sign of Winter but John finds himself scanning the dark corners for Sherlock instead. He’s not aware of shifting anxiously in his seat until Lestrade unlocks the doors and tells him to get out.
Peach rose meaning: If you are ready to say, “Let’s get together,” peach roses are the ones to choose as the rose color symbolizes intimacy. (Yup, that is the word for word definition from
“Shut up.” John says, bringing their lips together once more.
16 December 22:03
“Hopkins. This had better good.”
“Or women, if that tickles your fancy,” Carol added, “We don’t judge.”
John was more than a bit annoyed. Sherlock had dragged him out of bed early that morning and, after an incomprehensible journey zig-zagging through several neighborhoods, had shimmied through an impossibly high window to search a missing woman’s flat for clues leaving John standing alone in an alleyway like an idiot. Again.
And with that he swept from the room.
“Any childhood traditions you want to relive?”
Thanks so much for the lovely comments and kudos on the first couple of chapters. You guys rock!
If only it were that simple with John. Sherlock sat listening to Rosie’s quiet breathing and thought, not for the first time, that she would soon need a room of her own. On the rare occasions that he allowed himself to hope, he imagined John moving into his bedroom downstairs when this inevitable transition happened. But more likely John and Rosie would be forced to move out and he would be left alone again.
John took a step forward and placed a hand on his arm.
“It looks like a bomb shelter,” John murmurs.
“And you fear this fact will prevent the official police from aiding you for fear of upsetting the balance of the trials?”
His day took a turn for the better when Molly Hooper greeted him brightly and waved him over to her table. She had clearly made quite a dent in her Christmas shopping because she had to shift several bags aside to make space for him to join her.
Sherlock nodded, “Those elves had arrows and fought those hooded things.”
“I know, but it’s not your fault, Sherlock.”
“Seriously?” Sherlock snatched the papers from John’s hands and his eyes lit up.
Lestrade shakes his head, “No, they’ve still got wallets, phones and a decent amount of cash. As far as we can tell, nothing’s missing.”
“But how did you know about the keys?” Queensberry cried.
Hello friends! Sorry for the delay with this chapter. Thanks for all your kind comments! I'm glad you're still interested in a belated holiday story because I definitely want to finish writing it. Updates will likely be every couple weeks now that life is back in full swing after the holidays.
“Sure. Yeah. That’d be great.”
He turned and climbed the stairs to his and Rosie’s bedroom. Sherlock had taken her up to bed after she’d fallen asleep on the couch and hadn’t yet returned. John suspected that he’d decided to use it as an opportunity to remove himself from the festivities. He paused to listen at the door. No sounds of a bedtime story or the conspiratorial whispers that Rosie and Sherlock often shared when it was his turn to tuck her in.
When he reached the seats John had pointed out, Sherlock was surprised to see a makeshift sign on each:
-----
The gun fired into the ground but Sherlock must have thought I’d been hit at first because he nearly killed Winter when he disarmed him. I don’t think I’ve ever seen him look so scared. I just remember thinking it was worth the pain, worth so much more than an injured ankle to have him safe and to see how much he cares. It’s not often that he drops his guard but when he does he’s as transparent to me as the rest of the world is to him.
“You need to come down to the station.”
John looked up and saw a row of identical dolls with red bodies and Santa hats looming over them. Their large blue eyes that were all stuck looking to the right created an unnerving effect.
16 December 22:09
-----
“No,” Lestrade corrects him, “
“Less security?” suggested Stella.
“Glad to see you’ve fixed the Met’s abysmal response time to home invasion reports. Too bad you can’t speed up the process of getting a warrant.”
Par for the course, mate.
Once Sherlock had reclaimed his belongings, they hailed a cab and John was surprised to hear him direct the cabbie to Baker Street instead of chasing down another obscure lead.
“Is this a bloody competition?” John asks.
I knew of course, the rumours that had followed the two of us when I’d first begun publishing our adventures in the Strand - two bachelors living alone, sharing nearly every aspect of their lives. It was only when I married and returned in earnest to my medical practice that the whispers stopped and the public began begging once more for stories of the great detective.
Greg crossed his arms, “Sherlock, you need a warrant for that.”
Sherlock is seated at the kitchen table waiting for him with a box of pastries and the roses from the past couple of weeks clustered around him.
As Lestrade’s team departs, Sherlock grabs John’s sleeve and leads him down several alleys. They walk in silence until they reach a row of old storefronts where Sherlock spends 20 minutes circling a closed up locksmith’s business then hails a cab to New Scotland Yard without explanation.

7 February 14:18
“Seriously, Sherlock you can’t keep doing this,” John said, gesturing vaguely in the direction of the station as Sherlock strode down the sidewalk, fingers still flying as he tapped out another text.
He winced as John elbowed him in the side.
John smiles as an image of himself bringing flowers to Sherlock, not because of some experiment but ‘just because,’ drifts across his mind.
Sherlock shook his head, not ready to leave the safety of the railing.
He glanced back at the image on his phone. He’d seen that place before. He closed his eyes as he tried to remember where, but kept getting distracted by the memory of candlelight and John’s hand, warm on his. He shook his head and tried again to focus on the snow-covered building in the picture, but instead the feeling of John’s strong arms steadying him at the ice rink forced itself in and...oh! The ice rink. The Winter Wonderland at Hyde Park.
“I’m not talking about this,” John nodded toward the gingerbread houses, “but of course it’s just like you to make the perfect gingerbread house.”
“Why on earth would we do that?” Sherlock asked, adjusting some of the ornaments so the colours were more evenly distributed.
Holmes continued, “As you are clearly experiencing the same sense of disorientation as myself we can safely rule out a drug-induced fantasy. Therefore -”
“I dunno, doesn’t everyone go ice skating as a kid?”
“I thought it was obvious.”
“What about your experiment?” John asks.
-----
“Isn’t...isn’t that what you want?” he asked.
actually have a chance.”
When there was no case on hand, Sherlock resorted to texting him a sort of stream of consciousness that more often than not made John picture a web browser with a dozen different tabs open at the same time. Still, tonight’s texts seemed even more random than usual:
“You shouldn’t have given her a red rose,” Sherlock said in greeting when John came downstairs the morning after his disastrous date.
Lestrade takes the papers back and nods. “There is a connection though. You know that counterfeit case I’ve been working on?”
-----
Sherlock turned to glare at them.
“Why can’t we take Rosie with us?”
“Boring. Goodbye.”
I have an extra vase I could bring up.
John was quiet on the ride home from the station. As he opened the door to 221B, Sherlock broke the silence.
So, this doesn’t exactly fall into the series of events I've got going on here. Basically it can be read as a standalone that takes place anytime within the same Christmas season. Also, I switched the order of the prompts I’m using because the next few chapters after this ended up being one continuous section.
“There’s enough eccentric millionaires who dabble in real estate to explain it away,” Lestrade said, “Besides, I don’t think she was really in a position to argue.” He nods at the company ledger. John’s no financial expert but even he can see that her finances were in dangerous waters.
“You didn’t say you were working there again.” Sherlock says.
“That’s the big dipper.” John says, pointing, “and that over there is the North Star.”
“Right here,” said Sherlock, turning the screen to face him. There were several tabs open, all with titles like ‘The Language of Flowers’ or ‘Say I love you with roses’.
Sherlock flung his arms around Redbeard’s neck and pressed his cheek against the greying muzzle, unable to accept that his best friend would never open his eyes, would never lead him on adventures again.
“John, wait! I need you to come get me.”
Sherlock appears at his side immediately, checks that John’s ankle is elevated at the proper angle then looks at the clock and asks if he needs another dose of pain meds.
And this, my friends, is why you should always have your phones turned off during a romantic dinner.
“Not sure if that’s a good thing. Half the time I want to strangle him.”
“I...I guess you could say I’m completing your experiment.” John says, shifting his weight from one foot to the other.
16 December 21:20
“Fancy a bite to eat?” John asks.
“200 quid”
When they arrived at her front door John kissed her goodnight but declined her invitation to come up for a cup of coffee. Instead he wandered the streets, letting the music lead him where it may until he came to a halt by the river. As he gazed out at the thousands of twinkling lights across the water he imagined that one of them belonged to the person behind the music, and wondered desperately if that person even knew he was alive.
John looks over and sees Sherlock staring down at the floor, his right thumb and forefinger folding and unfolding the cuff of his dressing gown.
“The carolers from tonight,” said Sherlock, “do you know where they’re from?”
John was ready for the day to be over but his last patient, a middle aged woman who had come in for a sprained wrist, was trying to convince him that he would be a perfect match for her daughter who had just moved home after a year abroad.
“Around the other edge of this,” Sherlock said, gesturing at the Winter Wonderland festivities around them.
Molly laid a hand on his arm, drawing him back to the present.
Priorities change when you become a parent. I guess that’s true for everyone, even Sherlock.
“Sherlock, how many times have I told you: Stop indexing my ties!”
“Okay, well, I don’t love that she knows so much about crime and murder at her age - ”
Then John was struck with an idea. Maybe it was crazy. Maybe it was just wishful thinking inspired by the sappy Christmas shows that kept playing on the telly. But there was only one way to find out.
“Things could be worse,” Sherlock said, “She could end up being a serial killer.”
Sometimes she felt like Sherlock just said things based on probability rather than observation. But this time he had been alarmingly specific. She didn’t think she’d been that obvious, especially since she thought it would never work out. He’d been married after all. But now…
“Okay, just one step at a time,” John said, skating carefully backward while holding Sherlock steady, “Focus on me, not the ground.”
“You never dated?”
John stopped abruptly and gave him an odd look, “That’s not why I’m upset, Sherlock. It’s that they think the whole thing is a joke. When I want – ”
“Don’t you dare.”
“It’s all part of her education. You agreed we should encourage her interest in science.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Where is your little angel tonight?” he asked.
“John, have you got any cash?” Sherlock asks as they turn away from the warehouse. He had refused to get in the police car with Lestrade and now they’ve got at least a ten minute walk to a road that will likely have a cab.
Once the last batch of gingerbread was finished baking, the three of them sat around the kitchen table amidst a mountain of sweets.
“Yeah. Are you okay locking up by yourself? I’ve got to get Sherlock. The idiot managed to get himself arrested again.”
“Hmm?” Sherlock mumbles into the cushions.
-----
of your love life?” Sherlock says, then jumps as John hits him with a well-aimed paper glider.
Sherlock turned sharply to look at him.
John was searching for an age-appropriate anatomy kit for Rosie when he heard Sherlock calling him from the next aisle.
"One meaning of the orange rose is fascination. When you are totally besotted and completely bewitched by somebody, send them an orange rose." [
John returned to London. Broken. Uncertain. Alone.
He glanced back at the window then shouted to the cabbie. “Stop here. Yes, this will do!”
“Fine. Will you be late? I thought we could go to Angelo’s.”
After a short pause, Sherlock answered, “I was bored.”
“This is enough to feed an army,” John said, “Why’d you make so much?”
“You said my music would save someone’s life,” he sobbed. “Why did Redbeard have to die?”
After the party, John and Sherlock share their Christmas wishes under the tree.
“What, you didn’t see him in there?” John asked, nodding toward the door Sherlock had just emerged from.
“So, both banks were hit with a high volume of counterfeit bills!” Lestrade exclaims. “Look! These two cases are connected. Whoever this ‘Evans’ is, he’s either the counterfeiter or a key player.”
And he certainly doesn’t write about the softer, gentler expression that sometimes appears in these quiet moments that Sherlock spends organizing his mind palace. This smile spreads slower, is purer, remains longer than the others. No, John definitely keeps these things to himself.
I'm back, guys! Sorry for the long delay with this. Thanks so much for all your comments on the first chapter - they truly make my day and really motivate me to keep going with this.
I shook myself loose from his grip and pulled out the coin purse I had been reaching for.
John bit his lip. He hadn’t realized Rosie had witnessed his outburst yesterday when his laptop crashed for the third time that week. He was sure it had something to do with Sherlock borrowing it while working on a case last month that sent him trawling through more than a few dubious websites.
John sighs in relief when he confirms that his ankle has healed enough for him to limp up the stairs without assistance because having Sherlock touch him in any way right now would be more than just a “bit not good.”
“Why? Is he looking for a concert violinist?” Sherlock scoffed.
“John?”
The voice sunk through layers of drug induced fog to float around the blissfully empty lobby of Sherlock’s mind palace. What did the voice mean,
“But I still have trouble knowing
Sherlock shakes his head. “You can’t possibly know that. Maybe one day something will happen in my mind palace and everything about you will be gone.”
“John, wake up. We have to go back.”
On the third day John is unsurprised to see another rose sitting on the table, though he is a little surprised at the color - lavender.
Then he looked back at Rosie, torn between excitement for the case and responsibility. There was no way he could keep her here while he searched the scene. John was still at work, and probably wouldn’t be too pleased that he’d taken Rosie out on this particular case to begin with. Not that he’d known it would turn out to be a murder, but still.
Sherlock shakes his head a bit and continues folding the paper over and over.
“We had horrible timing didn’t we?” she said as she refilled both of their wine glasses.
As a result John isn’t sure what to expect. For all he knows Sherlock could be planning to drag him all over London so they can snog on every street corner where they’d found a corpse. It seems like the sort of mad thing Sherlock would do - the precise blend of sentimental and crazy that made John fall desperately in love with him in the first place.
The closest thing he can find is a dark red flower called “Canyon Road”. It’s hard to tell on the screen but it looks like a deeper shade than the rose on the table and as John scans the description he can’t think why Sherlock would associate this particular rose with anyone, at least not in a sentimental way.
He trailed off and for a moment they both stood there, frozen. John took a steadying breath then continued, “When I want it more than anything.”
Sherlock relaxes into John’s arms, fingers playing at the waistband of his trousers.
But things are different now. It’s not just that he’s sharing the upstairs bedroom with his baby daughter or the rounded corners on all their furniture, and the childproof locks on the cabinet doors. It’s not even the absence of Sherlock’s usual experiments with human body parts littering the kitchen, though that’s part of it.
They both knew John’s words were an empty threat, that no matter how many ridiculous things Sherlock did, John would always be there to bail him out of whatever mess he got himself into. Not because followed with blind devotion, but because he was addicted to the excitement that came when he allowed himself to be swept up in Sherlock’s insane life.
“No, you getting arrested.”
“My husband,” she says, “always brought me roses when we were first dating. Gorgeous red ones.” she stares at the collection on the table wistfully, “Even after we were married he’d bring them home on certain days.”
You do realize this is a public blog, right?
John lays a hand on Sherlock’s shoulder and feels him lean into his touch. This is new too, the way Sherlock seems to crave physical contact, though John can’t say if this has more to do with the aftermath of their reconciliation or whether it’s Sherlock’s way of affirming the reality of the world around him.
“Ouch!” Sherlock gives an irritated huff and John breathes a sigh of relief as his footsteps retreat.
stopping at the gift shop downstairs. All they have is this appalling color,” he says, nodding at the bubblegum-pink rose on John’s bedside table.
7 February 13:27
John chuckles, thinking of how Sherlock seems like a walking GPS in the streets of London but hands him a map and demands that he navigate every turn when they drive out for a case in the unfamiliar countryside.
“Ringwraiths,” John said automatically.
“Talked to one of the mums on the decorating committee, Rita.”
“Here,” he said, “Just start slow. Bend your knees a bit and shift your weight to the balls of your feet.”
“Come, John!”
“Why are you calling them that?” John asks, “We know their names now.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Sherlock’s eyes lit up. This was exactly the sort of case he lived for - a murder, no known motives or suspects, and now to top it off, a frozen corpse despite the mild winter weather they'd been having.
But a couple of days before his employers returned, Hastings lost his nerve and went to take the body out. He knew he wouldn’t be able to move it very far so he waited until late at night and, dragged it into a bunch of trees where he buried it under a bunch pine clippings.
Months passed. Even amidst the rush of London the silence stretched on. John felt the absence of the music like a missing limb. His friends put it down to exhaustion. He had just started his residency program, which would be enough to wear anyone down. But John thought that he could manage if only he could hear the music again.
John drifts off to sleep to the rustle of pages turning and the whisper of Sherlock’s soft breathing. When he wakes a few hours later Sherlock is folding Lestrade’s evidence reports into paper airplanes. There’s an impressive variety - the standard harrier design, one shaped like a fighter jet, another with a fan-like tail, a wide-winged glider and a bottle-nosed dart.
“Please. You know I delete all irrelevant details once the case is over.”
Sherlock sat up to face him.
“Been doing it since I was little,” John said, “There was this lake near our house that used to freeze over during the winter. Harry and I used to go out there every weekend for as long a the ice was thick enough.”
