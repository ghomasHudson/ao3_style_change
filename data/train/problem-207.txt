It’s with clenched fists that Sherlock watch the two innocent brothers fall and the guilty one fall afterwards and he listens to Euros mock John’s outrage. He closes his eyes and sucks in a breath.
Sherlock barely manages a nod, choking again on his own voice as John’s shifts just right and picks up pace. He strains to listen as James begins to speak again.
As Mycroft begins to recite the dates, Sherlock traces the numbers on the floor so he can see them somehow visually. The song sung in the back of his head he begins to line up the words with the dates until he finally comes across the message hidden - and at the end:
When Sherlock is done playing, he lowers the violin and looks at her and in a very rushed and desperate whisper he asks “Now can I speak to John?”
Sherlock’s voice drops down in pitch first before trailing on a breath that hitches on a moan as James starts to scissor two fingers into Sherlock’s already stretched hole - he seems enamored with watching the come slide down in between his cheeks.
He whines again at another twist to his nipple, accompanied by the command to speak loud enough to be heard. “And… AND!” Sherlock’s voice pitched higher as James’ fingers tightened around his nipple and he exclaims, “I come! When I am told!”
“Shhh… shh…” both John and James hush him gently, John wiping the tears from Sherlock’s face while James frees Sherlock’s hands. “Good man,” James whispers. “You’ve been so strong. You can come.” He helps Sherlock off of John’s cock, helping him settle between both of them. Both he and John rub the numbness out of Sherlock’s arms and assist his hands to settle around his cock, wrapping his fingers around it. John presses a kiss to Sherlock’s lips before he nods to James for the approving command. James provides it.
Sherlock tries to only nod, his voice becoming coarse against his throat, but he yelps his answer James thrusts hard against him in a way that makes his thoughts go dizzy and blur. He opens his mouth wide, as John anchors him by the hair, and he whimpers in protest when the other man teasingly strokes himself. He sucks greedily at the tip as it hits his lips, his tongue curling around the head, reveling in the taste and texture. John’s grip shifts to the back of Sherlock’s neck, guiding him downward as Sherlock surrenders, stretching out his mouth and relaxing his throat as John hits the back of it.
“Shut up.” - but the smile makes it hard to take him seriously. Sherlock pulls his coat tighter around himself - the Belstaff is retired, threadbare and slightly charred with a few punctures from a thankfully nonfatal stabbing incident, and hangs in the back of the closet - in its stead is a long black double-breasted peacoat that has become Sherlock’s new signature.
When Mycroft and Sherlock wake up, they find themselves in a concrete room with a large window and the Governor leaning against the wall. He is watching them carefully, with a very shaky grasp on a gun that he keeps trained on them. Before Sherlock can move to disarm him, Euros appears on a monitor and tuts at him softly.
“Stop struggling,” James growls in a command that makes Sherlock’s vein attempts at pulling at his restraints still. He looks back up at James with wide, expectant eyes, waiting for permission. “Repeat after me…”
There’s a slow clap resounding behind them, “Well I suppose you get your prize then. Your belongings are waiting for you just outside the room. I certainly hope you can get to Doctor Watson in time.”
John’s hands catch Sherlock by the shoulders as James expertly maneuvers him onto his knees in front of where John is sitting. Sherlock teeters forward slightly, anchored only John’s grip on him and the tight grasp James has on the dressing gown sash that still tightly binds Sherlock’s hands.
Euros gives John a soft (though irritated) ‘I’ll allow it’ before he answers. “Just my leg Sherlock. I’m… fine. Given the circumstances… I just have to make sure…”
Sherlock looks down as he weakly starts to jerk himself off, his wrists held by John and James, guiding him. Sherlock digs his heels into the floor and starts to buck upwards, his own body’s desire to reach climax outweighing it’s need for rest. He gets lost in the kisses exchanged between the three of them, John reaching down and cupping his balls, while James pulls his hand away to play with Sherlock’s come covered hole with the tips of his fingers.
“Tsk tsk, Sherlock. One wrong move and you don’t get to speak to your friend. And please, not that it matters, but don’t hold any harsh feelings for The Governor. His stakes are as high as yours.” She spins around to show that she has his wife bound behind her and then smiles. Sherlock flounders a bit but finds he’s unable to respond so he just stands still, his eyes fixed on the monitor, and waits. Euros heaves a dramatic sigh and picks at some controls in front of her. “Oh fine. If you wish.” There’s some static and she interrupts John before he can actually speak. “Now John, remember what I said - if you give away anything about where you are before you are told, my brothers die.” She jerks her head as a signal and the Governor steadies his hand and takes a shot at the window, just to prove the seriousness of the matter. “Mycroft can go quick, but I’ll be sure to make Sherlock’s suffering last. Though I’m sure he’s fairly use to being shot by now.” There’s a silence as the memory of Sherlock’s death experience looms between all of them. “Alright then, I suppose I should let you speak. But be quick. We have a lot to do.”
Sherlock musters all he can to reach out and grasp at James’ coat cuff as he passes by. “Please…” he croaks. “Come back.”
“No.” John shakes his head and sighs. “No. You know what? I’m tired of hearing ‘sorry’ from you. We’ll talk everything through when I get home the best we can.”
“A well. The well Mummy and Daddy would never let us go near on the property… That’s where John is!”
Another beat of silence that makes John’s ears ring in trepidation before a deep, rich chuckle filled them.
“I think you’re quite good at it. Maybe something to consider when the criminals get too fast. Sherlock Holmes - consulting matchmaker and wedding planner.”
“You could. If anyone could find me on nothing, you could. Don’t. Please, God, Sherlock - don’t. You’ve done enough. You understand? You. Have. Done. Enough. This is enough.”
(now - do not be cross, but I did not change Sherlock and Molly’s interaction for the sake of this fix-it, though I know there are many great fix-its out there that have. Please feel free to substitute whichever you prefer, but know that I plan to handle the scene as-is later. My opinions on the callousness of this scene have not changed. It’s still disgusting. But I’m gonna work with it.)
John pulls back so his mouth pops off with a slurp, but Sherlock barely can process it now that James is relentlessly pounding into him, he hardly registers his own voice, wrecked and broken, softly pleading, “Harder… harder… come inside me… oh please…” his breath shudders as he tries to draw it in and the moan comes out choked as he feels that first hot spurt shoot deep inside him.
“Seek My Room…” Sherlock whispered and spun around to face her. “This? All of this? Redbeard? The house? And this entire puzzle? Just a cry to get my attention?”
He closes his eyes and sighs in relief as James leans down and presses a kiss to his temple, pushing his hair back and runs his fingers through it and whispers to both him and John.
He is barely conscious as James helps John move him to the couch, strip him of the rest of his clothes, and use his ratty tee shirt to help wipe him off. His vision remains unfocused by he hears as James begins to gather his clothes and get dressed, and John’s quiet pleas that follow him.
Sherlock barely notices James pulling out until he flipped onto his back. He can feel the warm, fresh come dribble out of him as his stretched out hole flutters and clenches. His head falls back on James’ lap and he spreads his legs invitingly to John, but his eyes stay fixed on James’ face with John’s first thrust inwards. He watches as the Major’s lips curl into a vicious smile, watching John fill Sherlock up and fuck him hard and slow. James pulls Sherlock’s tee-shirt further up, exposing his chest and plucking at one small, tight nipple until Sherlock is bucking his hips and meeting each of John’s thrusts.
When Euros lets John speak, he warns that the water level has slowly started to rise. What was once closer to his lower calves was creeping dangerously close to his knees at a very steady pace.
News of a fire at Baker St reaches Mycroft and Sherlock when they arrive. Thankfully, no one was injured, but the apartment has been scorched. Spurred on by the knowledge that his younger and incredibly manipulative sister has John (who is hopefully alive) and is mostly likely responsible for the burning of his home (somehow), Sherlock lets Mycroft handle the Governor and moves straight to the holding cell. That’s when he finally meets her officially - no disguises.
John closes his eyes and exhales a near silent sigh of relief. He opens and lifts his eyes to meet Sherlock’s to find a smugness that he has an intense desire to wipe off thoroughly. He smirks and replies.
As Sherlock ticks off the list (Unmarried, practical about death, lonely…) he reaches the only remaining option.
“Hooper? The pathologist? Certainly not…” Mycroft scoffs but then he pales at how serious Sherlock looks. “Oh… Sherlock. Why would she…”
John is sitting on a park bench, typing on his open laptop. A little blonde girl around 3 years old, crawls up next to him. “Daddy! Papa says laptops are indoor things! This is outdoors!”
This is what makes it click for Mycroft but before he can provide the answer to Sherlock, Euros cuts him off. “I can tell when you’re ahead, brother. Say anything you like, but give him the answer and it all stops. No more second chances.”
John stumbles backwards, gripping his leg, to which Euros just rolls her eyes. “Buck up,” she quips, “I thought you were a soldier. Being shot should be easy.” She hoists him up and keeps the gun trained on him. “Don’t try anything funny. I’d hate your daughter to be an orphan… or… at least you would hate it, I’m sure.”
Sherlock sees John nod just before he’s bent over again, head back in John’s lap, gentle hands running through his sweat soaked hair. James’ voice is soft when he speaks again. “Four times and you’re still not satisfied. How does John keep up with you?” Just as Sherlock is about to beg, James thrusts back in, eliciting a pleasured sigh. “Do you like John’s cock, Sherlock?”
Mycroft tries, but falters, ultimately unable to pull the trigger (“Not really an Iceman, are you? All show.” Euros mocks) so Sherlock takes up the gun. He readies it and aims, all the while the Governor thanking him. He’s taken a life for John’s sake before, he can do it again. But John pleads with him not to.
Just as Sherlock begins to lower the gun, in a panic, the Governor grabs Sherlock’s hand and finishes the job, effectively shooting himself. When Euros shoots his wife in response, she spins and faces the monitor but not before cutting off John’s feed.
Sherlock looks at Mycroft helplessly and the eldest brother flounders before he finally starts to share memories of Sherlock when they were children.
“I know…” Sherlock replies with a hoarse whisper. “They belong to Victor Trevor. A missing boy. Old case… and my best friend when I was a child.”
Cut to Sherlock finding the unconscious psychiatrist. He paces through the house a few times, obviously worried. He strides back into the sitting room, eyes trained to the bullet casing on the rug, deduction stuck in his head before he finally averts his eyes and looks at his phone. He then makes a call.
“Do you mean… Baker Street? I mean, I understand if you’d rather stay at your own, I know the stairs aren’t easy but… with you and Rosie and your currently living arrangement I would really much rather…” John holds up his hand and offers Sherlock a smile.
“Let me clarify,” the gravely voice of the Major grinds into his ear, making his knees slip forwards, John reaching out to steady him so he stays upright. James’ breath his hot against his neck, his cock pressed against the crease between his cheeks, and Sherlock looks down at his own erection, so hard and weeping between his legs, the slightly chilled air offering no relief. He sobs in frustration when James speaks again, “If you want me to keep fucking you, you’re going to have to be honest. So let’s try this again… how many times have you let John fuck you in the
“We built 221B back up - to its original legacy and to reflect who we are now. We continued on our ridiculous adventures as two men against the world, while trying their best to father a daughter who was growing up far too quickly. And as our lives took shape, and we learned from our past, we found old wounds that only each other’s company could soothe. Both junkies in our own right, we finally found our slow way to sobriety in the only way we knew how - side-by-side.
“Sherlock, I realize you’re hurting but need I remind you - this is not about just you. We’re all… being threatened. We’re all dancing. So for the sake of getting out alive - so I can get back to Rosie and you can… apologize to Molly… and we can go home - please… I’m begging. Soldiers. Remember?”
“I… Sherlock Holmes… famous and brilliant consulting detective…” Sherlock parrots the words back, his sentence broken by gasps and moans. “Am a greedy… needy… slut.”
“My leg is going to heal, just so you know. But yeah… Once I’m out of this hospital, I’m coming back to 221B. I told you… we would go home when we got out alive. That’s what soldiers do.”
(note: I play with the order of these rooms because the original doesn’t make much sense in the context of this fix-it. For obvious reasons, I’m sure.)
“W… what?” Sherlock croaks out, eyes rolling back again before he tries to blink himself back into focus.
Mycroft slowly sifts through his memories before he stares back. “A mural. There was a mural. Of a forest. Similar to the one near the house and in the middle was…” he trails off and Sherlock picks up his thought.
“Musgrave…” Sherlock whispers before he grabs Mycroft’s shoulders. “The funny graveyard. Quick! What were on the tombstones? I know you remember. Tell me!” (note: in my head, Mycroft has a photographic memory)
But imagine James’ surprise when he’s greeted at the door with a very satisfied John and Sherlock, stripped to nothing from the waist down, wrists bound behind his back by the sash of his dressing gown, with his legs propped open and spread wide up on the arms of his chair.
Euros goes through the rules of the room - The Three Garridebs challenge is set up the same. Sherlock needs to solve the case that only Euros has figured out so far. John is allowed to stay on the line - as Sherlock’s “phone a friend” so to speak - and he listens patiently as the events are described to him. Mycroft offers his own intel but it all comes down to the gun.
“Cheating, Doctor Watson.” Euros interrupts, “Alright, gentlemen. It’s time to move along to my experiment - my game. Let’s see how you do, shall we?”
“James? Sorry. Let me clarify,” John clears his throat, fighting the tightening panic in his chest before he forces out, “I have a very unruly, gorgeous, and horny man beneath me and I think I need help taking care of him.”
“It was a long and revealing conversation.” John nods with an ‘ah’ and they both exchange smiles. John breeches the topic of Euros as carefully as he can.
At the admission, John reaches over and takes Sherlock’s hand. Sherlock averts his eyes and stares down at the wedding ring that John still wears. “John. I want to apologize for bringing up Mar-”
James steps in and eyes the squirming, near sobbing, detective, his top teeth catching his bottom lip before he looks back to John, seeking permission.
Sherlock didn’t answer. He just stared straight ahead as the carriage took them back to where the ship was docked.
Mrs. Hudson talks baby talk to Alice, then pauses. “Who wouldn’t want to watch, Alice, she’s an angel.”
The waiter sighed as he grabbed a pack of cigarettes out of his jacket. “John Frigging Watson, oh excuse me. Doctor John Frigging Watson.” He said in a perfect imitation of John’s posh voice.
Sherlock look a deep breath when they reached their destination. “I love the smell of chemicals. Now Wiggins, hand me my black coat and destroy the batch of strychnine. I have something far more interesting in mind. Put some gloves on and go to the cabinet and hand me the herb container with Chinese writing on it.”
“Sherlock, I know where you’re going.” I fling open the door, moving to shut it. You are too fast for me. “I know what happens in this room. I’m not home more than 5 minutes and you are using…” Your voice trails off when you observe the beauty of Alice’s room. I cower behind the bassinet. I hate you for seeing me like this. I must hurt you as you have hurt me.
“I say, what do you think, Watson?” Teddy’s voice bored into John’s consciousness like a horrible thorn in his shoe.
John laughed. “The cabbie doesn’t care.” He then sighed with pleasure when he noticed that Sherlock’s trousers were noticeably tighter in the front than they had been. John leaned into Sherlock, and applied a little more pressure with his hand.
John almost seemed to get a perverse delight as he tightened his hands around Sherlock’s throat. Sherlock turned his head to the side in an effort to get air. “John, please come back. I love you,” Sherlock coughed.
Mycroft levels his gaze at John. “He’s going to rehab. We can’t trust him. I thought we agreed on this John.”
Clare mockingly bowed in acknowledgement and then smiled at John. Sherlock looked from one to the other. He didn’t like how they seemed to have some sort of secret connection. “Can I be jealous?” Sherlock thought.
Mycroft met Sherlock’s gaze with a challenging one of his own. “Then perhaps you should have treated him better.”
John nodded and as Sherlock’s arm encircled his waist, John had never felt so safe and so vulnerable at the same time. “God, this is heaven,” John thought as Sherlock nuzzled his neck and even after the music stopped they both swayed in each other’s arms until a child’s voice calling for help drew them apart.
Sherlock leans back against his pillows, propping his head on his folded fingers, in an adapted meditation position.
He opens the doors to his Mind Palace,  walking down the halls, past the music room, past his living room, and into the Watson room.
"There's my little monster," he pecks her cheeks,  looking over at Sherlock with the same bright smile.
Sherlock nods an affirmative, setting the child down on her feet on the bed where she walks to John.
They sit in quiet silence, neither of them wanting to ruin the intimate atmosphere that has arisen in the air.
But this interruption was something he needed to document; the smell of John's hair, Watson's squeals of delight, the press of John lips against his own.
Eventually, Sherlock shifts onto his side to face John, looking directly into his lovers eyes. "I love you, John." John leans in to press his forehead to Sherlock's, taking care not to squish Rosie, "I know, love. As do I."
John reaches over to Sherlock, taking his hand. "What were you doing in there, love?" He asks, squeezing Sherlock's hand.
Rosie crawls up John to situate herself in between them, and John pulls the covers up just enough to cover up to her neck, about up to their waists as they were sitting up.
Him and John dancing in the living room. (John had found one of Sherlock's recordings of himself playing violin, and they found themselves in each others arms within a moment, Johns hands cupping Sherlocks neck, Sherlocks hands on Johns waist. Their first truly intimate moment together.)
He then stands in the middle of the room, eyes roaming the walls. Everything he enjoys about being human is in this room. All his favourite memories are stored in this very room;
Their very first kiss, after Mary died. (John was still deep in mourning, eight months later. Sherlock had rushed into John's bedroom after hearing screaming coming from the room. He held John as he sobbed into Sherlock's shoulder. After John's sobbing died down, he pulled away from Sherlock, wiping his eyes and hiccuping. Sherlock's hands roamed up of their own accord, cupping John's face, wiping his tears. In a moment of human weakness, Sherlock presses a soft kiss to John's lips.
A piercing cry wakes Sherlock from his light sleep. He hears John groan next to him, covering his ears.
With his other hand, John cups Sherlock's cheek and pulls him into a soft kiss, Sherlock closing his eyes and kissing back, memorising the feeling of John's lips against his own.
The hug he and John shared at John's wedding. (That one didn't need explaining. Sherlock had marked that as one of his worst days, but even bad days can have highlight.)
He then approaches Watson's crib, where there are some of her favourite stuffed animals. He takes the memory of her holding onto him and places it in the crib, where it sinks into the bed.
John nods in the darkness, running his hand up Sherlock's arm, light fingers tracing patterns onto his arm. Sherlock lays his hand on John's thigh, doing the same.
Ever since they had gotten together, Sherlock had stopped (well, cut back on) his 3a.m. violin sessions, choosing to give into his transports needs and sleep next to his lover.
They sit in silence, John rubbing small, soft circles into Sherlock's thigh, Sherlock rubbing John's shoulder. "Looks like someone has the right idea," John glances down at Rosie, who is already back fast asleep.
John bared his neck and Sherlock almost fainted when John allowed him to nip a bit of white skin beneath his chin. “Keep it up, Doctor and we shall miss lunch as well as dinner.”
I sigh, my work is done. They both make small talk, which seems ironic, considering that we are standing in the middle of a crime scene—bombed out Scotland Yard. In the distance, I see Lestrade making his way towards us. “Lestrade, I’m glad you made it through.”
Sherlock ran to the bathroom, washed himself up and then grabbed a tablet and a writing utensil to take notes on the experiment. At first nothing happened, John just lay there half asleep, grinning like a stupid idiot. “Sherlock, you have the best ideas,” John slurred as he lay back, rubbing the inside of his thighs.
He nodded, grasping Sherlock’s slender fingers in a tight clasp, then he stopped and smiled. “Sherlock, you look so real. I could swear you are with me.”
John looked quizzically at Sherlock and said, “Sherlock, do what you must, this cabin is geared towards the handicapped, I’ll be lonely but quite comfortable.”
Sherlock was feeling antsy, and bored. John had gone to some meeting about how when the snow drifts cleared a little, they would all play soldier and fight the bad guys. “Who cares if demons come in our world, for after all in the grand scheme of things, weren’t they already there anyway?” Sherlock thought. The way John had come to his rescue so gallantly during the sparing incident, yet again was starting to get on Sherlock’s nerves. “Was he getting tired of John? No never,” Sherlock thought. “Was the sex getting old? No, John was always open to trying new things. So what was it then?” Sherlock mused. A tap on the door relieved Sherlock of the idle thoughts that swirled around in his funny little brain like, fish in a tank. When he opened the door, his drug supplier, the small Asian woman stood at the door smiling at Sherlock. Sherlock looked both ways and invited her in.
The next morning, my body aches and my head pounds. You breeze into the room, the regurgitation from Alice’s breakfast are spattered in dots all over your shirt. I smile. You are adorable, an adorable father. I move to get up but you push me back into bed.
My whole body snaps to attention, ready to move on. “The one with the handcuffs, the plug, the crop and the honey?” You laugh when I lick my lips.
I am calm and sedate as I walk through the streets and back to Baker Street. “I will beg John not to move out of our bedroom, if I have to,” I think as I whistle tune from Mozart’s ‘The Marriage of Figaro’. I open the door, spin Mrs. Hudson around and then look around the empty flat.
A gentle hand rests on my brow. I open my eyes and the figure takes shape. It is Anderson. “Sherlock, are you okay?” He asks.
A slight jolt of turbulence shook John awake, his head bumping against Sherlock’s shoulder. Sherlock opened his eyes, looking down at John in tenderness. The glance between them held, then Sherlock blinked, becoming all business once more. He looked down at his watch. “We should be landing soon. Time for battle.”
Sherlock smacked his head with the heel of his palm and said, ”God, John what a selfish pig I have been, you must be exhausted. Come on, let’s put you to bed.”
John grinned as his eyes looked around the room to find the water spot on the floor he had observed a few moments ago after a fruitless search he said, “Oh, yes Laura I certainly do.”
Sherlock held the violin up and smiled, “Grandma, join me at the piano,” he said as he tightened up the hair of bow.
John closed his eyes, as he waited for the all-consuming kisses that Sherlock had bestowed upon him  while they were at sea, and was disappointed when there was only one gentle kiss. “Well, that was not like the kisses you gave me when we traveled last.” John said jokingly in an effort to hide the rejection he felt by such a platonic kiss.
The last thing I hear is your laughter. “Baby Alice, always puts him to sleep. We’ll have to remember that when he gets his bouts of insomnia. God knows, riding him around in a cab doesn’t work.”
Laura chuckled as she made a pouting downward motion with her lips. “Oh, poor little Mycroft, are you feeling ignored?”
“Sherlock?” John asked as if he had just been napping. “Sherlock, are you okay?” John asked again in a firmer voice.
Sherlock nodded curtly and then drew in a deep breath as he looked at John with the cardigan draped around his shoulders. “You know I painted you like that once, the Gallery owner said it was my best work. I thought I would never part with it, but a young man came in and wanted to buy it, he had no money, so I told the owner to give it to him. Besides he was he was…in a …in a …oh Jesus no,” Sherlock whispered as he made his way to John’s bedroom and threw open the door. There on the wall the painting hung, the angelic face of John wearing the cardigan as an ethereal light shone in his eyes-the eyes of an angel-his angel-John.
He bites his lip and looks down. I throw the crop down. I am ready to move on. I grab a plug and a blindfold, then I turn towards Anderson. He is shivering uncontrollably. I watch him in fascination for a few moments. I have pushed him beyond his limits but he won’t recant.
John leaned back against Sherlock as he was fed him pita bread and hummus. “John, you are my dearest one, but alas we must confront the case. While you were sleeping Hugh texted me and Laura has taken the bait. She has set up a meet with him to provide evidence that will expunge his record. The game is on my dear Doctor.”
I follow the surgeon to the nurses’ station, where I am then directed to Anderson’s room. I take a deep breath before I open the door. He looks so small and pale, too pale. I walk over and my mouth salivates when I notice the strength of his Morphine IV drip.
John had managed to get the guard’s gun and he pistol whipped the man until he was unconscious. Sherlock thought he would stop pummeling the man once he was inert, however, John continued to beat the man’s face with his bare fist.
I am amazed at the effectiveness of the sleeping pill, for it is morning. I can hear you on the phone arguing with some official about the details of Mary’s urn. “How bloody hard is it to burn up a body and get the ashes back to London?” You shout.
We fall into a routine, you, I and Alice. Though I have no wish to change nappies and such, watching baby Alice fascinates me, her small fingers, toes, the way she smiles, a combination of you and Mary. We haven’t discussed the Anderson Proposal since you brought it up last week. I am irritable. I need a case. I need a fix, or at the very least a cigarette. Perhaps I can get you back into bed. I am just about to propose this very suggestion when my phone rings. It’s Lestrade.
Sherlock’s beauty took John’s breath away every time, but never so much as when he showed his emotional side. “Of course, what happens to you happens to me. It’s just the two of us against the world.”
A wave of dizziness assails me and so I relent and lean into you. Feeling the warmth of your body makes me want to purr and then I am ashamed for Mary is dead. The stairs seem to yawn into infinity as I look up at them in annoyance. Then right on cue Mrs. Hudson comes down and begins to fuss over You and I like a mother hen.
I arrive at the murder scene and am surprised when Anderson falls in step with me. “Did you sleep alright?” He whispers just before we duck under the yellow police tape.
I stare at Anderson and then smile. I am going to make this the date from hell. I start first by grinding my pelvis into his back as we ride on his motorcycle through the rain soaked streets of London. Everything is wet, just the way I like it.
Sherlock smiled. “Irene always said you wanted me and that you were jealous of her. No, I’ve never slept with a woman.”
“ENOUGH, Get out, I’m not taking your case…we’re not taking your case.” Sherlock shouted as he pointed to the exit.
Sherlock reached out his hand to take the case and then John snatched it back. “Hey, how do I know this case is yours?” John asked skeptically.
Sherlock got in John’s face and said, “Something new.” Sherlock wasn’t particularly worried about John, for he had given John a lower dose than he himself took on a daily basis and also the servant woman had assured him that it was safe for a half-human, half demon to take, but the one thing neither of them counted on was John’s past traumas.
“Sherlock, talk to me, what’s wrong?” John asked. His voice had an edge to it that Sherlock knew well. Now was not the time to talk to John about this. They made small talk until Clare gave John the all clear sign that the shower was free.
Mycroft fixed his blue eyes on Irene as he whispered through clenched teeth. “I’ve always been there for him and I always will. Now show us what you know about the key or I will splatter your brains against the back of the wall and let brother mine solve the mystery without your assistance.”
John held the white cardigan up that had been Sherlock’s Grandmother’s, “Oh, so that’ why my letters came back. I’m so sorry Sherlock.”
Sherlock felt overwhelmed as he always did when John focused all his energy on him. “John, you’ve never lost it. How did I ever survive without you?” Sherlock said sadly.
Mycroft looked at Laura in disgust and then scrunched his body away from her, pretending to be fascinated with the view outside his small round window. John smiled as he looked out the window at the moon. For a moment he imagined he could fly, that he wasn’t in pain and that he and Sherlock were alone together. His chest grew heavy. “I’m tired,” John thought as he attempted to locate the glowing sands that rushed by beneath them. He fumbled in the folds of his robe. “Where are my pills?” John muttered as beads of sweat began to stand out on his forehead.
John was just about ready to drift off to sleep in Sherlock’s arms, when he felt Clare’s presence in his mind. It wasn’t like she could read his thoughts; however, John felt a strong urgency like a summons. John sighed put on a robe and quietly opened the door and stepped into the hallway. Clare was there, her eyes glittering in the light like a wild animal. John sighed in irritation.
He looks back at me and his shoulders sag. I can tell he is grateful. “Yes, Mister Holmes, it is,” he whispers.
After you’ve left the room my hands start to shake. “Sherlock,” a voice says and I turn with a vengeance on the person who has seen my weakness.
“That was what I was going to do and you went behind my back and gave a rotor cipher to a psychopath. You’re a hypocrite Sherlock Holmes, that’s what you are.”
Sherlock took John’s hand in a gentle clasp at the same time he was railing on the security officer. The veins stood out on Sherlock’s neck making it look as if he had steel rods connecting his head to his shoulders. John watched Sherlock’s display of temper in wonder. For Sherlock was holding his hand as if it were a small nest egg, while he yelled at the officer. “How does he control his body like that?” John thought. Then a cloud of depression settled over him as he thought about the loss of control over his own body.
Sherlock paced around the cabin like a caged animal. “Sherlock, stop you are starting to make me sea sick,” John said as he wheeled his chair into Sherlock’s path.
John leaned over the back of the wheelchair and looked up at Sherlock, “Sherlock, it’s okay…I’m not exactly…an object of desire…”
I open my eyes. I lay in his arms. The look on his face is enough to burn the heart out of the most stalwart individual.  John has left himself open. For it is obvious that my death would destroy him. His eyes are swollen. He has been crying on and off for about 6 hours. For that is how long it would take for the skin under his eyes to appear, red and puffy. John extends his hand towards me and pulls me out of the primeval looking ooze.
“Molly, I do love you and your small, inadequate breasts fascinate me. I wouldn’t mind looking at them, only for scientific purposes of course.”
Sherlock squeezed John’s hand so tight that he almost cried out, “John, I…” Sherlock’s voice trailed off as he rolled over on his side to face John.
I pull John down beside me on a dirty mattress. “They will soon be here,” I whisper into your ear. “Follow my lead.”
Mycroft stood up and began to pace, his motions slow and agitated like a caged animal. “Last night was a danger night.”
John shrugged looked over at Clare and leaned back against the seat. No one said a word until they arrived at China Town. The cabbie seemed relieved to be rid of them and drove off so quickly the cab’s tires squealed against the pavement. Once they were alone John and Clare each took a deep breath, looked at each other, and began to head deeper into the dark recesses of China Town. Sherlock hurried after them, feeling like a small child trying to keep up with his older siblings. They only had gone a few feet when a dark figure loomed out in front of them.
Mycroft watched his little brother go from a furious state to a fixated one in the space of a few seconds. John. He wanted him, craved him, loved him. He turned away, hoping that John’s love could protect his beloved younger sibling. “Fine, just be ready to leave bright and early tomorrow.” He waited for a retort. When none came he turned around to see Sherlock taking John’s hands in his own. He was down on his knees speaking in low tones, his fingers rubbing John’s arms, while his head bowed in grief. Mycroft swallowed, sad that John was learning the truth about Sherlock and sad for himself that he would never have the privilege of someone to weep over him.
I shake my head. “No, Mycroft didn’t know about it until my time in Eastern Europe. During one of the interrogations it slipped out.”
By the time they reached their appointment John was exhausted and when Sharon opened the door, John turned on the T.V. and plopped down on the couch.
No one comments on my blood spattered torn shirt when I step to the front, pacing while I look at the picture. Then I stop. Chill bumps race up and down my arms.
Anderson smiles. “Hmm, that sounds interesting, then he plucks the lemon out of his water and sucks on it.”
I ignore Lestrade and forge ahead. I push past two uniformed police offers, ready to bay like a hound. I am so intent on my quarry that I fail to notice the crazed figure that charges towards me, screaming obscenities. My intellect is no match against the fight or flight adrenaline that causes my body to freeze in place. I wait for the cutting blow and am surprised when another figure rushes forward, throwing me to the ground. Who has taken my place with the grim reaper? A shot rings out and my would-be assailant drops, letting his machete clatter to the floor.
You come into the room, God, how I am aging you dearest John. I don’t put on a robe I just lounge on the chair. You pause for a second your eyes clinically observing my naked body as a Doctor would. Wait; hold on, John you do know exactly where to look. Your eyes roam over my body like a hungry predator, pausing to look on my pubescent tree and its fruit. A thrill of electricity runs through my body, I spasm, jiggling the fruit. You stare. You frown. You lick your lips. You then look away. I inwardly sigh with relief and disappointment; there will be no cherry picking today. I am glad I am disciplined for the thought of you tasting my forbidden fruit is enough to send me into a pre-orgasmic fit.
“I’m sorry, Sherlock, it’s all my fault that we are running behind. You would have made better time alone, not to mention the strain on the horse.” John said as he patted the horse’s warm, sweaty neck.
John felt as if things were getting out of control and was just about to tell Laura to get to the point, when a clumsy waiter dropped a tray of glasses. The crash made John jump and he looked over at the poor waiter in sympathy, wheeling over to help him. The waiter shook his head and said in French, “No, no I am fine, sir.” John had reached down to help and when his hand touched the waiter’s he knew it was Sherlock. For a moment Sherlock’s green eyes met his, they burned with a promise of love, protection, passion and something else jealously, an all-consuming obsessive glance that made John weak in the knees.  Sherlock let his thumb linger on John’s index finger and then he got up in a profusion of apologies, cleaned up the mess and left.
Sherlock lay back and held John’s hand until it became heavy with sleep and dropped out of his grasp, dangling limply towards the deck.  Then for the rest of the morning and into mid-afternoon Sherlock watched John sleep until the light shifted to the other side of the ship leaving them both in semi darkness. Sherlock shivered now that the warmth of the sun had left them but not for a moment did he leave John’s side. Motioning for a ship employee Sherlock asked for a blanket for he could tell John was cold from the way he laid curled up in a ball.
“Dr. Watson, it’s time to go hunting.” Clare whispered back, her voice was low and grating like the wind that howled outside.
A few metallic clicks latter and I am in Anderson’s flat. I expect the inside to be as dismal as the outside and I am surprised when it is not. Though the décor is sparse, the place is clean. I smirk, looking at the freshly polished kitchen floors.
John was already dressed as he sat in his chair. He grimaced as he shifted his weight. “John, are you alright?” Sherlock asked his eyes round and focused on John.
Sherlock grinned back. “Let’s ponder the ‘Rear Window’ aspect,” He said in that low dulcet toned voice that drove John crazy.
John felt the blood drain from his face. “Oh God, Sherlock, …I’m not sure if we should continue to…”
John’s head was still spinning from the turn of events that evening, “Sherlock, how could we possible get a civil union ceremony performed so quickly?”
When he was through Sherlock sank to the ground, seemingly obsessed with the piles of glass around him, finally he raised his head and Mycroft walked over and held out his hand to help Sherlock up, Sherlock was about to refuse, but thought better of it as his feet slid on the uneven floor. “Sherlock, now you know what is like in our funny little brains.”
I hear Mrs. Hudson greeting Mycroft. I wait until he enters the room, then before he can go on the defensive I ask him, “Did we have a sister?”
“Everything’s fine, Sherlock, you worry too much. Clare told me her secret on the way to China town. She also informed me that you already knew about her being only partially human, which would have been nice to know before I saw her change into her other form. It was frightening, yet magnificent. Clare has agreed to let me take some blood samples from her, so that I can study the Claymore.”
Before John could reply, Sherlock scurried out of the room, leaving John alone. No matter how many sheep John counted, he couldn’t get to sleep and was still awake when Sherlock slid in next to him around 3 A.M. “Sherlock?” John asked.
An got up from the floor, carefully skirting around John, and stood before Sherlock. “It is obvious that I have been attacked, so perhaps I could say I was injured when you three escaped. However, you are going to need some help interpreting the Chinese texts that contain the stories about the end of days. I will talk to my cousin; he is an expert in ancient Chinese. In the meantime, you must go quickly. Come,” she beckoned, “this way.” An with the help of Clare pulled open a door that An unlocked, and they made their way through the darkened passages of an old abandoned sewer system. As they quietly walked through the tunnels, An whispered directions on how to find their way out to Sherlock. “I have to go now, I will be missed. Sherlock, can you find your way back?”
Clare stopped short of going in the living room when she heard the unmistakable sounds of Sherlock and John’s love making. A tear slid down her cheek, as she contemplated the evil that would consume John. John’s destruction would be Sherlock’s destruction and the world would be a darker place without them.
His eyes spark with hope, then it is doused. “Good one, Sherlock you really had me going there. After all, one offs don’t spend the night. Do they?”
“I detect no poison, blunt trauma to head or neck, the larynx is engorged with roast beef but not crushed.” I state as Anderson watches me.
Laura informed them that a contact would meet them with details of the statue’s last known whereabouts, which Sherlock suspected she already knew. “What’s she up to?” Sherlock said as he scowled in Laura’s direction.
Sherlock watched John as he gathered up the last of his supplies that he would need for their tracking of the Golem. John’s body quivered with excitement at the prospect. He reminded Sherlock of a dog before the hunt. John turned around and smiled at Sherlock his eyes full of life and love. Sherlock swallowed and looked down at the ground. John’s love for him was a mystery that Sherlock would never be able to fathom. In his entire life Sherlock had never felt so strong and confidant. The flip side was that Sherlock had never felt so afraid; it was a type of fear that threatened to consume him at the thought of anything happening to John.
A small scratching sound at the door made Sherlock stop musing in his mind palace and he sighed in irritation as he got up to see what it was. As soon as Sherlock left the bed John was instantly awake. “Sherlock, what is it?” John asked as Sherlock opened the door. “Uh, Sherlock, you’re naked. Don’t you think you should put something on?”
John couldn’t take any more, “Sherlock, I’m tired I’m going to take a nap.” He said and then without another word wheeled out of the room, all the while swallowing down the lump that formed in his throat, for Sherlock hadn’t even noticed his departure. The room was cold and John shivered as he wheeled over towards the adjustable bed that Sherlock had bought so that John could maneuver himself in and out of it if he needed to. Every bone in John’s body ached as he slid out a side panel from his wheelchair, and then a few herculean movements later he was in bed lying down. “Damn,” John thought as he stuck a pill in his mouth, “there’s no water in my glass.” Not wanting to go through the process of getting in and out of bed again, John bit down and just chewed the pill up, grimacing at its sour taste as it burned its way down his throat.
You look over at me in exasperation. “I’ll be right back.” Then you look back at me, taking Anderson’ bottle of pills with you. After you leave the room Anderson looks at me.
John walked out and slammed the fragile door, leaving Sherlock to laugh at his struggle for control.
Once Sherlock and the demon-John, were armed Sherlock smiled and said, “Come on, John let’s go kill a horseman or two.”
“Sherlock, why did you wake me up? Are lonely my detective? Because if you are,” John said in between kisses. “I have a big surprise for you.”
Mycroft rounded on Sherlock, preparing to give him the verbal thrashing of a lifetime, then stopped when he noticed his brother smiling down at John in adoration. “Sherlock, what have you done?”
John looked defensive when he answered, “Yes, who the hell do you think  you are, barging in here like this?”
I raise up. “In case you haven’t noticed there are two other people in the room. How come everyone always blames me when something untoward occurs?”
He looks from me to Anderson and then back again. “Why did you lock the door? I thought you would have killed each other by now.”
As they disembarked, Sherlock spotted a limo that hovered on the fringes of the private landing strip like an ocean predator. Mycroft went down to meet the black, long sleek vehicle while Sherlock wheeled John over where it sat waiting to whisk its inhabitants into its cavernous interior.
In two strides Anderson is across the room, he locks the door and then slams me up against the wall. “Don’t do that. I don’t like it.” Grabbing my hair, Anderson begins to kiss me in a most impure manner. He then takes the heel of his palm and rubs my crotch until I cry out. The room swirls around as black spots appear before my eyes. Anderson is stronger than he looks and I am amazed when he lowers me to the ground.
I then close my eyes and pretend to sleep. You lay down next to me. I roll over and lay my head on your shoulder. I then drop my hand on your stomach, my long fingers feel through the opening in your shirt. I touch your bare skin. Your stomach muscles tense, but you don’t dislodge my hand. My index finger rests in your navel, as if it was always meant to be there.  What would you do if I kissed you? What would I do if you kissed me? I am an asexual person; it is all about the work for me. I have disciplined myself. If I were to allow my passion to ignite I would burn us both. I would burn the heart out of you and you would do the same to me.
Sherlock sat in a small, chair made of some kind of bamboo and thought about the chemical analysis of the drug and then the idea came to him. “By God, I will try it out on John and I will monitor his responses. Perhaps, this evening was not going to be as dull as he thought.” Sherlock mused as he rubbed his hands together, but first he must contact the Asian woman to see if she would come back later, once he had done this Sherlock waited.
John’s comment drew a couple of stares and a snicker, which John totally ignored as he looked up at Sherlock’s flustered face.
Anderson’s haunted expression mirrors my own as he says, “It’s fine, Sherlock. When I speak I may lower the IQ of the whole street or the whole world for that matter, but I know that an addiction cannot love me back. It’s a temporary fix for an unrequited need.”
“Anything you want, John, just name it,” he whispered, in between the open-mouthed kisses he covered his chest with, letting his tongue encircle around a nipple until it hardened between his teeth in a small nub.
John was giggling by this time. “Yes, please.” As Sherlock ran his hands down John’s shirt, John stopped laughing. “Jesus, Sherlock we’re going to get arrested, stop.”
John still felt a little overwhelmed but answered. “My fiancée thought a trip would be good for me,” John said as he walked over to the rail of the ship and glanced into the dark crashing waves of the ocean.
“Hush,” Sherlock ordered, his eyes fixated on the burgeoning prize between John’s legs. John closed his eyes as Sherlock pushed his knees open and then back. In the background John could hear Hugh singing, “Can’t Help Falling in Love,” in front of him the sounds of Sherlock’s slurping dominated the area in the small stall. Sherlock stopped for a moment, looked up at John, his lips were red and swollen, the area around his mouth glistened with moisture. “John, hold still, you know it’s all about the work for me and God knows I love my work.”
“John, where are your clothes? Did you just walk out here naked?” Sherlock asked in surprise, for John had always been the modest one.
John didn’t reply he just looked glassy eyed towards the chair that Sherlock had occupied and then turned his attention to the Shaman.
As soon as your lips touch me I whimper. “John.” You have no mercy. Either you’ve done this before or you are a quick learner. I wrap my fingers in your hair as you work. “God, John, you need to let up. It’s too much,” I say in a shaky voice. You look up at me for a second, but otherwise ignore me. Then I feel a pressure that starts deep within me. It makes everything tight. It makes everything hurt. “John, I think I’m going to pass out,” I scream out as I pull harder on your hair.
The room grew so quiet that John could hear the traffic noise from outside. Mrs. Hudson’s  muted laughter also drifted in from somewhere. Sherlock was the first to break the silence. “We’ll take the case.”
“Here, here,” John said as he downed another scotch. The song, “Isn’t it Romantic,” drifted across the room and Elsa hummed along with it as she smiled at John. “Come on, let’s dance,” Elsa laughed.
We approach the front of the club. Anderson takes my hand and leads me around back. “I know you wouldn’t want to be seen with me so I arranged for us to go through the side door.” Anderson says smiling sideways at me. I blush, feeling the heat of his words.
You soothe your hand over my curls. “Sherlock, you are so gifted. I love you so much. We’ll talk about the living arrangements. I’m sure we can work something out.”
Sherlock’s shoulders slumped, disappointed that John couldn’t peer into the nuances of his convoluted mind.   “It’s a machine, so that you can be on top if you want to.”
Before anyone could react Mycroft pulled a glock from his jacket and held it to Irene’s temple. “Stop with the mind games, now!”
Anderson smirks, then takes the pill you offer him. When your back is turned, I open my mouth, curling my tongue around a little white pill, flicking the tip, then swallowing it with a sip of tea. A stream of liquid runs down my chin, and I take out a handkerchief, making a show of wiping it clean.
The scene is being secured when I jump out of a cab and run upstairs to the victim’s flat. The smell of death and patchouli assails my nostrils when I open the door. Lestrade motions me over to where the victim lays.
You look murderous and Anderson blushes when Mrs. Hudson opens the door. “Boys, I thought you might like some…tea.” Her voice trails off and she wrinkles her nose. “Oh Sherlock, what have you done now?”
John wondered how Sherlock was going to explain Clare, but when he turned around she was gone. God, that was irritating. How did she do that? Sherlock brushed past John and began to examine the body. Sherlock bent down circled the body and sniffed, then stood up.
“I was ten. Mycroft and a friend left the house to get cigarettes and three of them stayed behind.” My hands start to shake as I remember that horrible day.
Clare sniffed John, in a long inhale and John felt his face flush. “Dr. Watson, you smell of sex and blood lust. I hardly think that will bother the Golem. Come on let’s go while the trail is fresh, I need you to help me track the scent.”
As John advanced on the trembling messenger, the Shaman came and stood between them, “John, you have greater problems than Sherlock. You must focus on the task at hand, for if you destroy the three remaining horsemen, the fourth will fall.”
“God above, Sherlock, we have responsibilities. We have a baby and Anderson to look after. Your last blood panel revealed that your kidneys and liver are under a great deal of strain from your past abuses. I can’t lose you again. Why do you feel the desire to hurt yourself? You need therapy.”
Clare’s breath was coming out in gasps as she attempted to stop John. “Sherlock, I am going to have to kill him. He is only going to get stronger. Can’t you see?”
“John, tomorrow I will give you the details of your game and you will also be initiated.” Laura said softly.
When Sherlock began to part John’s hair for further examination, John wheeled out of his grasp. “Sherlock, I’m fine let’s get back to the case.”
I clear my throat. “Umm, your eyes look really blue and if you drape your blanket like this,” I then rearrange the blanket on his lap, “no one will see the colostomy bag.”
Sherlock smirked, “You’re mad. There’s no such thing. Besides who do you think I am, Indiana Jones?”
You frown at me as you read my chart. “It sounds like you’re having a drug reaction. I’m going to call the nurse.”
Doctor Shaw smiled. “I’m not asking you to write about puberty or your first pimple. I’m asking you to write about…”
Another one stood in front of me. “God, he looks so fresh and sweet. I bet he’s as tight as a drum.”
“You little beast,” John said as he made a grab for my robe. I laughed as I slithered away from him. Then we were chasing each other around like a couple of kids. Finally, John got the upper hand and pinned me to the ground.
“Sorry, I didn’t want to disturb you,” John mumbled.in embarrassment, for he wished the ground would swallow him whole because the next item on his agenda was the bathroom. “Sherlock, can you take me to the bathroom?”
Sherlock brushed past the girl with a triumphal glare, resisting the urge to stick out his tongue. Angela led him to her office, gesturing for him to sit. Without any preamble, Sherlock rushed ahead with his request. “I want you to hypnotize me.”
I stare at her in annoyance. She is right of course. What sane person would bring a baby to 221b Baker Street?
After he got dressed, Sherlock walked over to the bed and gently kissed John on the lips, like a happy child, John smiled in his sleep and then rolled over totally contented. “My totally innocent Doctor,” Sherlock thought as he quietly left their cabin.
Clare stopped short of going in the living room when she heard the unmistakable sounds of Sherlock and John’s love making. A tear slid down her cheek, as she contemplated the evil that would consume John. John’s destruction would be Sherlock’s destruction and the world would be a darker place without them.
Sherlock peeked around the corner and John looked down, “Sherlock, my land lady does the shopping for me and well I’ve already eaten so no need to worry.”
John shook his head again, “No, if I let you help me out, he wouldn’t like it and if I got well and left you for him, you wouldn’t like it. Plus, it’s enough that you’re flying back to London with me. Not to mention the job you got me as a consulting physician job in a clinic.”
John pulled Sherlock even closer. “At the risk of being sacrilegious, I would fight God himself to save you.”
The terror is over. He has been caught. I look at the miscreant, while he is being led away. His eyes bore into mine. I stand before him and smile. “It’s good to be recognized, isn’t it?”
Sherlock opened his eyes. A cool hand brushed against his forehead. Even before his eyes focused Sherlock knew it was John.
After John had finished filling John in on the details Sherlock frowned, “So, what do you get out of the deal?”
Wiggins came into the room. “Ah, Sherlock’s thought of everything he has, he has a machine that can do that.”
I fix my bird of prey glance on you as I say, “John, you’re still dehydrated. For god’s sake get something to drink.”
Sherlock approached the bed and handed the black orchid in its coffin shaped case to John.  John read the note and frowned. “Who do you think it’s from, Sherlock?”
As I count out the money, I am appalled at the increase in price. The weasel of a man looks at me and shrugs. “Sorry, Mr. Holmes, but everything is going up. The whole world is going to hell in a hand basket.”
Laura smiled making her lips curl up in a joker-like grimace, “Good, there is a Doctor from Vienna that can make that happen for you.”
Mrs. Hudson smiles, then looks sternly at both of us. “Now I’ll look after Alice, but just this once. Remember, I’m your landlady, not your babysitter.”
Sherlock deposited John on a bed in a near-by room, then came back to where Wiggins stood. “If you whistle one more time, I will knock you out and cut your vocal chords.”
Sherlock pulled John from the back seat, gathering him in his arms, holding him tight against his chest. “Sssh, you’re going to wake John and by the way I never told you that I would leave so much as a schilling to you.”
“No.” Then you pin me to the ground. I turn away but you force me to look at you. “Oh god, Sherlock, I’ve missed you.” I rest my head on your shoulder, while we both weep. “Sherlock…”
John got his breathing under control. “Sherlock, what are you talking about? I would never break your heart.”
Sherlock made his way downstairs to where Wiggins sat. “Come on Wiggins, time to mix up a potion, while the good Doctor attends to John.”
John rounded on Sherlock. “Are you kidding me? That was the creepiest woman I have ever met. Are we in the freaks of nature business now?”
Sherlock stood up and patted her on the shoulder, “It’s okay, Mrs. Hudson, it’s okay…”Sherlock said as he moved towards the window. An armored truck rolled through Baker Street and Sherlock could just hear the words, “The city is under quarantine, do not leave your homes unless you have a medical release pass, if no one has a medical release in your household, put the green flag out on your door and emergency supplies will be delivered as soon as possible, if you have dead in your house, put them in the white body bags that have been provided, if you are out of bags wrap up the dead as best you can and put a white flag at your door, noting how many dead are to be disposed of. God save the Queen. God save us all.” The announcement cut off and Britain’s national anthem played over the speaker.
Dan smiles. “That’s alright. You really are quite attractive. Now may not be the time, but in my business a person learns not to waste time. Molly, would you like to go out for a cup of tea sometime?”
Mrs. Hudson fusses over me like a mother hen. “Here, I got your favorite biscuits. Have a few more, you’re so thin, Sherlock.”
I am mad. I am ashamed. I am alone. I am bereft and so I lash out. “John you have an unerring knack for stating the obvious.  Let’s get back to Baker Street and hash this over once more.”
“John, what happened? Are you alright?” Sherlock checked John for injuries, hoping that John found his response appropriate.
John scratched his head, for he was pretty sure that he hadn’t ordered room service, however he shrugged and then pulled open the door. A tall steward entered the room, his hair slicked down, peppered with gray, his long face reminded John of a weasel, his thick black glasses accentuated the weasel effect by making his eyes look round and beady. The steward wheeled a cart across the room and then the realization hit him, for the steward was none other than Sherlock. However, John decided to play dumb for a few moments.
Sherlock turned his face away from John. “Do you remember when Clare told us that her family had been killed and that she had been taken along with the killers and raped and used as a play thing? Well, John, that’s when I made up mind that we should assist her. No matter what Clare became after her experiences, she is still a damaged creature that needs our help.” Pain was etched on Sherlock’s features as he turned back around to face John.
The noises of the café seemed to implode on Sherlock’s already frayed senses as he tried to focus on the problem at hand. The clinking of glasses, the low chatter of the anonymous voices that filled the room. “Think, think,” Sherlock whispered aloud as he attempted to organize his chaotic thoughts. Hugh opened his mouth to say something and was silenced by a warning glare from Sherlock. “Stop, just don’t say anything. I need to think.”
“Someone just blew up our camp”. Sherlock said as he looked over at Laura, noting that she was as shocked as he.
The day of the ceremony, John was so nervous that he felt as if he were going to be ill. Sherlock arrived right on time and as he helped John into his wheelchair and then bundled him into a cab, John’s head spun with the energy that Sherlock exuded with every move. “By God, he’s going to be difficult to keep up with,” John thought nervously as Sherlock fidgeted in the seat next to him. The cab had barely come to a stop in front of the magistrate’s office when Sherlock jumped out, paid the cabbie, came around bustled John into his wheelchair and off they went, so fast that John laughed for it felt as if he were a child again on a  tilt o whirl ride at the fair.
Sherlock crawled over to where John had fallen and took him in his arms. John was pale and sweaty, but still conscious. “John,” Sherlock gasped as he ripped off his jacket to stop the blood flow. Sherlock, watched with horrified fascination as dark blood soaked the jacket. At first Sherlock thought that the blood was deoxygenated because of the deep color, but on further inspection, Sherlock realized the blood wasn’t a deep red, it was black. John’s blood was black
John immediately responded. “Oh God, yes,” John groaned as he sucked hard and harder on Sherlock’s bloody fingers. When he had sucked them clean, John began to kiss Sherlock, biting his lip so that he could taste more of Sherlock’s blood.  The villagers stood by and watched in horrified fascination, for they knew better than to disturb a creature like John. John sucked on Sherlock’s lip a few more seconds and then stopped. His breathing was heavy and the corners of his mouth had blood caked in them. John’s eyes went from golden to blue as he stared at Sherlock, as if it were the first time he had seen him. “Sherlock, what have I done?” John whispered.
Sherlock was a third of the way up the stairs when he heard Lestrade cry out in fear and then he heard a gun going off. Jumping down the stairs Sherlock grabbed the harpoon he had hidden under the stairwell and came to Lestrade’s aid. Lestrade had emptied a round of shots into a hideous creature’s abdomen; they slowed the creature, otherwise it appeared as if it hadn’t been affected at all. The creature turned to watch Sherlock’s approach and Lestrade took the opportunity to stab the back of the creature’s leg with a knife he pulled from his belt. The creature moaned and fell to the ground just as Sherlock reached it. He held the harpoon above the creature and was about to plunge it into the creature’s neck when something stopped him.
The sound of torrential rain and crashing thunder filled the room. “Sherlock, what aren’t you telling me?” John asked softly.
Sherlock’s eyes narrowed, then he took the call. After he powered off, he smiled. “Well, it seems we have a therapist for John.”
“I have the report of our enemy sir.” The scout replied nervously, as he licked his lips, for he was hoping that John was not displeased with him.
Sherlock shook his head, “Nope, we’ll be there come hell or high water,” he said as his eyes devoured the sight of his sweetheart Doctor that he would not see for six months.
The show was some type of interview show and John leaned forward in excitement when he noticed that Sherlock was one of the guests.
John collapsed beside Sherlock as Sherlock lightly rubbed his fingers across John’s face. John closed his eyes and smiled. “Sherlock, that feels so good. You know how I love to feel your fingers across my skin. They are so soft and yet I can feel the calluses on the ends of your fingertips from your violin playing. I revel in the contrast, you know?”
John laid his hand lightly on Sherlock’s arm, “Then how do you know that you like them, men I mean and what about Nina?”
John felt cold and lonely and so he went into the bar to have a drink. As John sat down at the bar, he ordered a Scotch and Soda and was surprised when the bartender put a Scotch and Soda in front of him and then sat another identical drink next to him. John was about to tell the bartender that he only wanted one drink, when Sherlock sat down next to him. He looked at John and smirked, “Well, so much for us not meeting again.”
The Doctor laughed again, then his expression sobered. “Sherlock, you are still young yet. Though you may not see it, you are just like me-dark.”
Sherlock slid out of John’s grasp and went to run a bath for the two of them. When he came back John noted the red splotches on Sherlock’s face, the red-rimmed eyes that stared back at him making John gasp at the power they had over one another, for Sherlock the machine had been crying. John swallowed and then grinned, “Did you put bubbles in the bath?” He asked suggestively.
A tear rolled down Sherlock’s cheek as he gave in to his dark side. It no longer hurt to puncture his vein, but Sherlock hissed as the liquid burned through him. One minute Sherlock’s neck and back muscles were as tight as a drum, the next they were fluid, relaxed-free. “I can now relax, for the boredom cannot harm me now,” Sherlock thought as he curled up on the floor and slept.
Sherlock’s lips trembled as he glared at Mycroft. “The past is the past, brother dear. What does she want?”
It appears that this machete has a twin, see the marking on the handle? It indicates that this weapon is one from a set of two.” I say aloud.
I stand there at the window alone. I stand there for an hour and twenty minutes, until Mycroft comes for me.
Irene was in her element. Sherlock looked pale and weak. “The place looks a little run down; don’t you think?”
I scoot to the side, making room for you. You kiss my forehead, then hold me in your arms until I drift off to sleep. My last thoughts are,
You pant as you look into my frightened eyes. “Good, that’s the way it’s supposed to feel. Just wait the best is yet to come,” you say. Then you go back to work.
Sherlock looked down at his hands, setting the violin case on the ground between them, then leaning his head against John’s shoulder. “But I am here, John.”
John licked his lips and took Sherlock’s ice cold one in his own, “Sherlock, just because I’m in a wheelchair doesn’t mean that I’m not…well you know…functional. I mean I can have intimate…relations.”
You jump up. “Come on let’s see what Mary has in store for us,” you say as we push our way through the dispersing crowds.
Sherlock stood up and patted her on the shoulder, “It’s okay, Mrs. Hudson, it’s okay…”Sherlock said as he moved towards the window. An armored truck rolled through Baker Street and Sherlock could just hear the words, “The city is under quarantine, do not leave your homes unless you have a medical release pass, if no one has a medical release in your household, put the green flag out on your door and emergency supplies will be delivered as soon as possible, if you have dead in your house, put them in the white body bags that have been provided, if you are out of bags wrap up the dead as best you can and put a white flag at your door, noting how many dead are to be disposed of. God save the Queen. God save us all.” The announcement cut off and Britain’s national anthem played over the speaker.
“Now,” I say and he stops. He slips on a condom. My virtual John then slips one on me as well. I knock him face down on the bed. I slide into my virtual John. I dominate him with my pumping motions. I never tire of the feel of penetration as I bury my head in your shirt. Your scent makes the head of my reservoir full. I scream out in mental agony. “JOHN,” I scream out. Then as I become flaccid I weep. I whisper your name over and over.
Anderson pulls open his robe, showing me his wound in the full light. I grimace. It’s dreadful. “I wanted to save you, but there was something else too. I wanted to bleed out in your arms. I wanted you to be the last face I saw, the last voice I heard.”
Sherlock lay in bed listening to John’s breathing patterns as he slept. The gentle snore was evidence of John’s slight case of sleep apnea; however Sherlock didn’t mind. The funny little whistle that escaped John’s lips comforted him; it was as if to say nothing had changed. Everything was okay. Sherlock reached over and kissed John’s bare shoulder. Normally John would have muttered in his sleep, or at the most looked up into Sherlock’s face with that shy sweet smile; however, this time John’s body stiffened as he quickly rolled over to face Sherlock.
Sherlock let himself be lead to the morgue. He had been to morgues before, identified bodies, made suppositions, deduced and analyzed. He had never looked on them as flesh and blood until tonight. What would he do when the tray was rolled open? What would he do when John’s lifeless eyes stared back at him? They would be dark blue incapable of reflecting light back. Tears poured down his face as Sherlock clenched and unclenched his fists for control.
Without another word John grabbed Sherlock’s arms above his head and handcuffed him to the head board of the bed. The next thing Sherlock felt was John’s hands firmly slipping some sort of collar around his neck and then John grinned down at his captive. “Sherlock, blindfold, or no blindfold,” John asked as he held up a small black piece of material.
John thought when he released the lever that would lower his twisted spine to a place where he could penetrate Sherlock.
Sherlock glanced over at him noting how pale and worried he looked. “I’m fine. You look exhausted. Let’s get you to bed.” He started to hook up John’s motorized wheelchair device, then John stopped him.
I open my eyes. Though I am feeling better, the burden of the conversation I must have with you weighs heavily upon me. What I wouldn’t do for a fix. Just something, anything to take the edge off.
The journey home goes by in a somnambulant haze. I crave the needle. My hand shakes for it. Tonight is definitely a danger night. I smoke one cigarette after another.You say nothing. We enter Baker Street in silence. You barely mutter a “Good-night” and then you run upstairs.
All over the world the social media networks were jammed with news feeds that read something like this, “Sherlock Holmes to marry rich American Heiress Nina Summers, Nina has finally found her romantic destiny with the detective Sherlock Holmes, she is worth 900 million. Well, it doesn’t take the world’s greatest detective to figure out that 900 Million is a lot of cheddar in any language.”
Sherlock’s eyes grew moist and he fingered John’s palm. “I am quite well, John and more importantly I remember where the Doctor put the key.”
It is only after you and I are on the way home that I realize that I didn’t say anything to Anderson.
I shake my head. “No, I’ll do it.” I then navigate the stairs with ease, setting the tray down by the side of the bed.
John nodded and then grabbed his shirt and waved goodbye as he ran out of the shop and down the street. As he ran closer to his destination, John felt as if the frantic pace of the city were keeping time to the beating of his heart. He ran parallel down the side walk so that he could see the Empire State Building from the opposite side of the street, “I’m almost there, I am almost there, Sherlock. Sherlock is the closest thing to heaven I will ever find, “John thought as he hastily looked both ways and darted out into the street. He never heard the car as it tried to screech to a halt, he never felt the impact of metal against flesh, and he never felt Sherlock’s anger as he waited and waited for him hour after hour for a person that would never show up.
“Mm…” Sherlock hums an affirmative as he wriggles his toes against John in a way that makes the flush to his cheeks burn a bright red. “Then maybe it’s not food he’s hungry for.”
“I can’t say she understood, really. I mean… she did, but… it’s not that simple. She doesn’t hate me, so I suppose there is that. It’s a work in progress. It’ll take time. I’m on catsitting duty for awhile and I’ve officially run out of favors at the morgue… but I promised if I came across a good match for her, I would send them her way.”
It starts with a late night call from John. He hangs up after the first ring. James returns the call, but John’s too nervous (and not nearly drunk enough) to answer. Sherlock does it for him.
“John’s therapist’s. There’s a woman unconscious, bound in the closet - I’m assuming the actual owner of this house. Sitting room empty aside from the usual furniture - save for a discarded contact lens… bullet… bullet casing… and slight discoloration on the red rug that could only be… blood.”
He closes his eyes and inhales again, the smell of John making his mind swim in its own incoherence. He makes a desperate whimper when James pulls out, jerking Sherlock upwards by his wrists and pulling his body flush against his chest. Sherlock’s eyes refocus on John, who is shaking his head.
He forgets basic functions like breathing and his heartbeat as his brain sends out a pulse of sensory pleasure that sizzles through him with that first thrust. James slides all the way into Sherlock, huffing a quiet chuckle before he pistons his hips back and the forward again rapidly, a satisfying sound of skin against skin making Sherlock whine and John shift just slightly.
The short bout of laughter, dark and deep and soft, shoots a shudder down Sherlock’s spine and he struggles to tighten himself around James. “I can see why John would want to fuck you four times. Listening to the world’s only consulting detective… the brilliant Sherlock Holmes…” James pauses when Sherlock’s breath hitches, taking his time sliding back into Sherlock, watching as the man beneath him writhes and gasps and sobs again. “Reduced to a needy… little… slut…”
“In most cases? Yes. In this one? No.” John fidgets a bit, trying to get himself comfortable. “I found bones at the bottom of the well, Sherlock…”
Sherlock visibly flinches but he draws himself up straight and takes a deep breath before he finally agrees.
Mrs. Hudson calls us her “Baker Street Boys” - but I can tell you, that we are undeserving of such a title.
“Am a… a…” Sherlock bursts into a cry as James twists lightly at his nipple, making Sherlock arch into John’s hands. “A greedyneedyslut…” his words come out in a burst as he looks at John between his legs, his ankles pressed against his shoulders, John’s eyes fixed hungrily on James’ face as he speaks, only to bring his gaze to Sherlock to watch him recite James’ depraved litany.
Sherlock receives a Stradivarius from Mycroft (She refuses to play. Quite frankly, she doesn’t deserve it) to replace his being damaged in the fire. (Consider it pirate’s booty). As he begins to play it, the montage begins - and John is the narrator.
The two Holmes brothers then begin to try to narrow it down, Sherlock doing his best to map it out in his head, while Mycroft offers his suggestions.
Sherlock slowly sinks, guided downward so his cheek rests on John’s thigh, nuzzling the worn fabric of the pajama bottoms John had hastily pulled on upon James’ arrival. They smell of John - of sweat and linen scented soap with hints of something spicy and just pure John - and it’s enough to make Sherlock groan and bury his nose into the crease of John’s groan and inhale deeply. His eyes skew upwards as he feels a set of fingers card through his curls. He hears James pull away, listens as articles of clothing are slowly and carefully removed and fall to the ground. His eyes dart to the side to see John’s flaccid cock begin to stir and wets his lips, sucking in a breath as the back of his dressing gown is pushed up, bunching up with his tee shirt and exposing his bare arse to the air.
He ends the call and tosses the phone to the coffee table. He grips Sherlock by the hips and pulls him close, laughing at the purr in his ear.
Sherlock offers a hand to help John to his feet, and John accepts it, smiling at the tiny kiss his partner decides to sneak onto his lips. “Your daughter is on the move. We better hurry to catch up.”
James drops to his knees in front of Sherlock, watching as the other man’s eyes spark, an angelic smile twisting onto his lips, his unruly curls falling around his face in a brunette halo of debauchery. James leans in and presses a kiss to Sherlock’s top lip, then to the bottom before drawing him, kissing him thoroughly until his mouth is pink and Sherlock is left gasping. His tongue darts out as James pulls away, trying to bring him back like a parched man chasing away a few drops of water. Rich, deep laughter fills James’ chest as he pushes Sherlock’s hair back forehead and whispers into his skin.
Sherlock was nodding frantically in agreement as he whispered back, “And I come when… when I am told…”
Sherlock’s ministrations help bolster John’s confidence. His second attempt to overthrow the taller man ends in success, with Sherlock’s thighs around John’s hips and heels pressed into his backside. His grip to the phone jars loose as John rolls his hips forward, making Sherlock choke on a moan. John catches the phone before it tumbles to the floor and brings it to his ear.
Sherlock shows Mycroft the letter left by the fake Faith Culverton. (”So it wasn’t a delusion?” “Unless my delusions can materialize notes that say ‘miss me’ when illuminated by black light… although if that were the case, then Wiggins truly is a wasted talent.”) and during their discussion, Mycroft suddenly figures it out.
made for it. Or - Sherlock could just admit to never having sex, depending on your headcanon. I think are both valid points. I just want him to answer the damn question definitively Now back to your regularly scheduled fix-it)
Sherlock closes his eyes and smiles as he hears the sound of their lips touching, and the kiss that deepens as they meet. He hears as they stumble and fall together against the desk, years and years of repressed feelings bubbling forth in a long awaited renewal of an old relationship that never reached full fruition. And his heart drops when he hears James pull away and whisper. “I have to. I have to get back. I can’t have anyone notice that I’ve left. It’ll just cause trouble.”
Euros groans, exasperated, and taps her foot before stepping over the partition where there was only the illusion of glass and walks up to Sherlock. She rolls her eyes at his shocked expression. “Don’t pretend you didn’t know already. It’s tedious.”
Sherlock hesitates and then clears his throat. “I… deleted my information on firearms after… after I was shot. It proved useless in that situation and I assumed…” he falters until John coaxes him softly ‘and?’ “I always assumed that I could rely on your knowledge on the subject if needed.”
“Now John said something about needing help with an unruly, gorgeous, horny man… but if my eyes aren’t failing me, it looks like you’ve been thoroughly fucked already… so… explain to me. Why am I here?”
“New staff has been appointed. She remains locked up. I have agreed to take on more of the cases Mycroft throws my way so he doesn’t have to continue to appease her for her help. She’s asked me to visit. I haven’t replied as of yet.”
As his nose hits the base and he inhales, body thrumming at the strong smell, he feels James’ pace pick up. His moans and pleas are muffled by the cock filling his mouth and he feels as if his entire body may vibrate into nothing. John moves his head, helping him bob along the length. Each sound John and James make above him only coils tighter inside him, but release remains just out of reach and he feels himself weeping from the pressure.
No matter how bad those times had been it had brought them closer together, and John had learnt a lot about Sherlock because of them; one of the most important lessons being to not mess up his sock index. Certain things could be easily deduced if one paid close enough attention. How Sherlock took sugar in his coffee but not in his tea, how he never ate during a case but could be persuaded by a cup of tea and some toast and how he always spent an extra ten minutes in the bathroom when he washed his hair. There were other, more subtle, distinct traits that John had figured out over time. The fact that Sherlock's mood was often translated into his music, how he hid behind his label of sociopathy in order to not have to explain his eccentric behaviour, a fact which John figured out due to his previous discovery of how affected Sherlock truly was by what he deemed failure whenever a life was lost in a case he was working on. He may claim that he found it easy to simply not care for those involved but John had seen the shock, and later on the anger, on his face when Moriarty had killed the old lady and subsequently another eleven innocent people, even after Sherlock had solved his puzzle.
"We need to talk about this," John said, worry seeping into his tone, "You're not sleeping, you're barely eating and you're smoking more and more each day. This has to stop."
He made his way up to their flat for the first time in two days. He couldn't help but think that the last time he had been here he was with Sherlock, and everything had been fine.
Their lips connected and they found themselves unwilling to let go. John angled his head down slightly so as to take the pressure off Sherlock who was stretching himself far too much for his liking and he deepened the kiss. Soon Sherlock's tongue had set out to explore John's mouth, moving slowly across John's lips and meeting John's tongue.
Sherlock lifted his hips off the bed to help John and quickly took off his shirt as well. “Everything you need is on the top drawer.”
They chuckled, both out of amusement and the relief of finally being together again. John stood up slightly from his chair, still holding Sherlock's hand, and closed the distance between them.
John smiled sheepishly at him and saw a similar grin spread itself across Sherlock's face. John sat back down on his chair, surprised at his show of affection in front of Lestrade. "How are you feeling?" he asked Sherlock, trying to clear the air and also trying to ascertain the state Sherlock was in.
John watched in amusement as Sherlock opened his mouth, clearly ready to spew out some smart remark, and then closed it again once he realized there was no arguing with John, not when it came to his health anyway.
Sherlock nodded. “I trust you.” He slowly pulled his knees apart from one another, fully exposing himself to John.
After dinner he laid down on the sofa, waiting for Sherlock to return. He was tired and if Sherlock were here he would probably go to bed, but he didn't want to sleep until the detective arrived. He only realized he'd dozed off when he heard shuffling on the stairs.
"Calm down, John," Lestrade said before Sherlock had a chance to reply and possibly piss John off even more.
Neither of them spoke, or felt the need to fill the silence with words. They simply enjoyed the other’s company until Sherlock finally broke the silence.
"Oh, okay." John scrambled off the bed and grabbed the sling, carefully setting Sherlock's arm in the right place. "Do you need some painkillers, are you okay?"
Sherlock walked slowly up the stairs, trying to avoid the creaking sounds he knew would most definitely wake John up. He figured John had fallen asleep once the texts had stopped. When he reached the living room he spotted John lying on the sofa asleep. It was clear he'd tried to stay up until Sherlock returned but had been unable to.
Even though Sherlock was known to loathe accepting anything from his brother he couldn't hide his excitement at the prospect of a case. He took a drag from his cigarette, not even bothering to finish it, and stubbed it out on the ashtray he had stolen from Buckingham Palace, making a show of it to Mycroft. He walked towards his brother and took the case file out of his extended hand and placed it on top of the desk.
The anxiety leftover from his nightmare wouldn't leave him and Sherlock knew he needed something stronger. Seven percent stronger his mind whispered. He chased the thought away, determined not to give in. Instead he retrieved the cigarettes John had hidden in the skull. He took one out, noticing there was one missing from the last time he had seen them. He remembered the lingering scent of cigarettes when he had visited John on his birthday; John must have smoked one that day. After lighting the cigarette he walked over to one of the windows and opened it, blowing the smoke out.
Sherlock couldn’t keep still. The feeling of having John inside of him was just too much and he kept rolling his eyes, trying to get John to go a little deeper, a little faster. He couldn’t stop the broken little moans and pleas that were leaving his lips. “Hurry up, John,” he moaned.
"Breathing's boring, John, I've told you. Besides, if you insist that I eat than I will do so quickly so I can get back to work. It's a most interesting case."
John was left standing at the door with his mouth hanging open in complete shock. He had seen Sherlock worked up before, upset, even angry, but this was different. Sherlock had been desperate. Desperate for an escape and John had been the only thing standing in the way.
"You're welcome, dear. Just try to get some rest, Sherlock will be back soon, I'm sure," she said reassuringly and went back down to her flat again.
This changed Sherlock's plans. He had to clean up the kitchen as soon as possible so he could take care of everything else. John's warning had come in handy and Sherlock managed to prepare everything just in time.
That was all the invitation John needed. He lunged forward, wrapped his arms around Sherlock’s waist and dragged him off the bed. His grip on Sherlock wasn’t the best and the detective was squirming against him and they both quickly tumbled to the floor laughing.
“Good, for I have something new I want to try,” John said as he jumped out of bed.  A few moments later he came back with a blind fold, hand cuffs and some sort of long, pointy things.
Laura stuck out her bottom lip in sympathy, “Oh, you poor dear, mustn’t let Sherlock down, he may leave you if he were to become bored.”
Sherlock looked lost for a moment and then he smiled, “Fine, we’ll order in. John, I’m going to take care of you, I’m going to take care of us both.”
Irene made a clucking noise with her tongue as she smiled at Mycroft. “So, you do care for your little brother.”
Sherlock could feel panic and anger building up in his chest. He was going to lose it any minute. In order to keep himself in check, Sherlock spewed out the first thing that came to his mind. “Well, at least I’m not dark like you. Don’t think that the word ‘dunkle’ escapes me. It means dark in German. That’s what you are, a dark evil person and evil never triumphs.”
Sherlock reached his hand back and tugged on John’s sleeve. “John, don’t go yet. I want to feel you.” John knew what Sherlock meant and frowned. He thought Sherlock most kinky in this regard, but John shrugged as he let Sherlock reach into his pants and run his hands through the remnants of John’s moist fluid. Sherlock reached in like a greedy child, until his hands were covered with John’s moisture, he rubbed it into his arms and hands. Then Sherlock brought his hands to his face and inhaled deeply. “God, John, I love your scent.”
Sherlock had tears in his eyes he was so uncomfortable. John squeezed himself behind Sherlock on the toilet seat, and then reached around with his hands to undo Sherlock’s trousers. Sherlock’s face flushed, he didn’t want John to see him this way, he was a mess. “Ssh,” John cooed as he brought Sherlock to a climax. Sherlock was drenched in sweat as he leaned back in John’s arms. All of his emotions threatened to overwhelm him when John kissed the back of Sherlock’s neck.
John grinned at Sherlock as he said, “We are going somewhere in a helicopter and as for spilling it come here. We have at least two hours before the chopper and I want you to make love to me, Doctor’s orders.”
John was mentally exhausted though and so he asked Jake a nonchalant question. “Okay, where is Sherlock? I had better check on him. So, lead the way,” John said as he gestured for Jake to take the lead. Their living quarters had the same green columns that adorned all of the buildings and the roof was covered with purple tiles that looked like scales. The front door was the same color as the purple roof tiles. John thanked Jake for showing him to him and Sherlock’s residence and then John waved good-bye as he went inside. The residence was smaller than it appeared from the outside. The main room was nearly empty, the floor was dotted with cushions here and there and there were large blue vases in each corner.
“Ah, yes I know. “‘To sleep, perchance to dream—ay, there’s the rub. For in that sleep of death what dreams may come, when we have shuffled off this mortal coil.’ Now, let’s sleep, Sherlock, then let’s dream. Rub, your fingers along my face until I fall asleep?”
I can no longer hold my activated libido in check. It is time for me to make a visit to a quiet flat. I have given them strict instructions. My partner-prostitute is to be 169cm tall, 62 kg, and he is to have blonde hair. He will be my virtual John Watson. I prepare for battle. John’s black coat- check. A bottle of John’s aftershave lotion-check. John’s striped shirt-check. A package of condoms-check. One sex toy-check.
Anderson twists around on the bench so that he is facing me. His elbows rest on the piano lid, his legs spread slightly in order to maintain his balance. My mouth begins to water. I want to snake my hand up his pants until he thickens in my grasp. I kneel before him as if to confess my sins. “You would do anything for me wouldn’t you?” I ask, then I reach for him.
Sherlock and John had made love several different times that night, “Each time had been more exquisite and unique,” Sherlock thought as he smoked a cigarette, looked out the window and watched Clare and John train together. John thrust and parried, until Clare’s arm began to tire. “My God, he is magnificent-strong. There is no sign of vulnerability about him here. Other than losing me nothing seems to scare him,” Sherlock thought, as he turned away from the window. He was exhausted and yet did not want to rest, as John had suggested earlier. Sherlock curled up on the bed in the fetal position and covered himself with a blanket. “God, I need something stronger than a cigarette. I wonder what sort of recreational drugs they have here,” Sherlock thought as he burrowed further under the covers. He fought sleep for a few moments and then Sherlock ceased to struggle, as his eye lids became heavy he drifted off into a deep slumber.
Sherlock was across the room in an instant, “That’s Doctor Watson, my husband,” he said as he laid a possessive hand on John’s shoulder.
Clare leaned forward, moving her face so close that she was almost touching Sherlock’s nose. “Sherlock, I need you to help me find the Golem. My tracking abilities are somewhat limited in your world, so I require assistance. I was told you are the best detective in the city, is that a fact, Sherlock?” The tone of her voice was soft and musical, yet no one could doubt that it conveyed power.
Sherlock looked down at the ground, tracing the stones of the training area with his foot. “No, I want to keep the smell with me. You know how I like your special fragrance,” Sherlock said as he tried to look bored.
Sherlock’s grandma smiled up at John and said,”It’s so nice to see a man that helps out with household things.” John blushed and looked shyly at Sherlock’s grandma.
John flushed under her intense scrutiny and asked awkwardly, “The chapel seems so lovely, may I go in it?”
You hover over me staring, not saying a word. My teeth are clenched so tight that my jaw hurts.  I know what you want and you know what I want, but we are both too cowardly to act on it. Then something in me snaps. I thrust my hips until your body makes a circular arc. You are now underneath me. “John, I can’t do this anymore I…” My voice trails off in a whisper. You look frightened. You look angry. Yet, I peel back your expressions like an onion until I see something in the depths of your eyes; something that makes my heart beat faster. I count the pulse beats in your neck. They race as do mine. I place my hands on either side of your cheeks.
Blinding pain and nausea threatened to overtake Sherlock as he proceeded with his inquiries. “Did you say a group of Golem?”
John knowing what Sherlock meant decided to tease him a little. After all who wouldn’t get off on the fact that he, John Watson, could turn Sherlock’s knees into jelly? “Umm, Sherlock whatever do you mean?” John asked in wide eyed innocence.
Then all thought drifted from the genius detective’s mind, when his lover entered his physical and mental mind palace, taking them both by storm.
Sherlock inspected the kitchen and the staff, once he was satisfied; he was just about to leave when a young waiter came into the kitchen and slammed his serving tray down on the counter.
Lestrade shrugged. “We got an anonymous call from a burner phone, so we have no idea who the witness is.”
Sherlock made a point of inhaling, then exhaling in an exaggerated manner, then he spoke in clipped tones, accentuating each word. “Oh, for god’s sake, you can cook up a batch of meth in no time, now figure it out. The kitchen’s that way.” He then pointed in a vague gesture towards a hallway to their left.
Sherlock disengaged his hand from John’s and began to pace around the room. “Nothing will befall you John, I won’t let it.”
Laura laughed as she stuck out her foot and began to play with the foot rests of John’s chair, “John, I forwarded your medical records to him.”
I observe as his eyes lose their luster. Like a corpse he slumps to the ground. I hear pounding; it is not my heart. Someone is knocking on the door.
A few moments later the items John requested were handed to him by a frightened looking servant girl. John took the items and then said,” Sherlock, I need you to gently blow your nose into this towel,” John instructed. After Sherlock had removed as much blood as possible by blowing into the towel, he lay back against John. John felt as if he were going to throw up, for this was going to be so painful for Sherlock. “Sherlock, keep your eyes fixed on me,” John softly ordered as he put his fingers at the top of Sherlock’s nose and pressed firmly.
John smiled and said, “Well, I guess you’re right there is no sense in a lovely ring going to waste and as long as they were cleaned properly then no harm done. Sherlock, the rings have been cleaned haven’t they?”
Sherlock leaned his head against John’s and whispered, “Yes, it was.” Then without another word he pushed John’s chair in the direction of evil.
“John, are you alright?” Sherlock asked in concern when he noticed John rubbing, and then scratching the back of his neck.
A few hours later Sherlock, awoke the room was empty and dark. Confetti lay at the bottom of his bed growling at John as he stood in the doorway.
John entwined his fingers in Sherlock’s black curly hair as Sherlock whispered all the things that John loved to hear. “You are my true love, John Hamish Watson-Holmes. I want to devour you with my tongue and mouth.” After a few panting breaths, Sherlock stopped and then looked up at John once more as he whispered, “I will protect you.”
Sherlock’s blue eye’s widened with excitement. “Blindfold, Doctor, please and put it on tight this time.” Sherlock’s vision was blacked out as John slowly slipped a blind fold around his eyes.
Laura giggled as she looked over her shoulder at Mycroft. “Oh, he’s so cute when he’s protecting his mate. Isn’t he big brother?”
Sherlock looked away from the computer screen. The entries stopped. The next day John got locked up in a facility. The police found him on the roof of St. Bart’s screaming ‘SHERLOCK, DON’T BE DEAD. PLEASE FOR ME, JUST ONE MORE FUCKING MIRACLE. JUST ONE.’
Mycroft smoothed down the sleeves of his jacket, intent on an unscheduled grooming ritual. “She was seven years younger than I and one day younger than you.”
A few days later, Sherlock went over his notes about the drug, he still didn’t know exactly what made it work, he had used John as a cuddly lab rat, a means to an end like he had and would continue to use John and others in the future, for he was a scientist-a detective. But he was also something else, he was John’s friend and lover, and for the first time since he was a child, Sherlock was afraid, for he didn’t know how to be a friend or a lover, he just knew how to think. He just knew how to deduce. He just knew how to solve puzzles. Love and friendship and how they made one think and act were aspects of life’s riddles that Sherlock had no clue how to solve.
John watched Sherlock train with pride, though he was not as strong as himself and Clare, he was fast-cunning. Even though Sherlock was convinced that he had lost his mental acuity in this world, John knew otherwise, Sherlock was still well…brilliant. It made John’s head hurt as he tried to keep track of Sherlock’s fighting strategy. Even before his opponent would make a full strike with the Bo, Sherlock would counter it. “God, he is brilliant-wonderful,” John thought as he watched Sherlock with a mixture of lustful longing, hero worship and just plain adoration. It was hard to compartmentalize just how he felt about Sherlock. All John knew was that Sherlock was his link to life, his friend, his hero, his lover. For a moment John let his mind drift over every aspect that he knew about his beloved and then the unthinkable happened, Sherlock left an opening in his defenses and wham his opponent hit him on the bridge of the nose.
I sink down in a chair next to the bed, putting my head in my hands. “I’m sorry,” I whisper. There is no answer, only the beeping of hospital equipment.
You come over and rub Anderson’s back, then kiss me on the forehead. “The doctor says you are recovering nicely and should be able to go home in the next couple of days.”
John stood up and faced Sherlock, “Thank you,” he whispered, as Sherlock took his hand and kissed it. John looked up at him; his lips slightly parted beckoning to Sherlock. “Jesus,” Sherlock thought and pulled John into his arms and began to kiss him. After a few moments of such intense pleasure that Sherlock could never hope to repeat it; he pulled away from John. “You’d better leave now, unless you want to stay,” Sherlock said huskily as he encircled his arms around John’s waist.
“Mary Morstan, was a nurse John dated after I was dead, well, fake-dead. They went on three or four dates and then she quit her job and disappeared.”
As soon as they got home, John ran a bath for Sherlock. Afterwards, John wrapped Sherlock in the bed covers. “Get some rest, Sherlock.”
“Dearest John I want to take your hand. I don’t. I just pout. You place your hand over the cuff as if to protect me from the cold metal. I look up at you….John.  How can you not know? How can you not know how I feel about you? How do I feel about you? Do I love you as a friend? Do I love you as a brother? Do I love as a lover? I can’t imagine what it would be like to kiss you. I can’t. I can’t imagine what it would be like to have you…to have you make love to me…I can’t. I want you to read my mind. I want you to ravage my soul, like a pirate-like a pirate-dearest…John. Your brow is furrowed, your lips pursed. You are just as lost as I.
John traced Sherlock’s bottom lip with his thumb. “You were distracted because your emotions weren’t in check.”
John hated the fear and anxiety that ripped at his sanity. No matter what Sherlock said or did John was inconsolable for he was terrified that he would lose Sherlock or perhaps he had already lost him.
John opened his mouth to say something then thought better of it. He stood still for a moment, frowning at Sherlock’s hunched over posture. Then he turned and left.
We go through the final check out process, then we wheel Anderson out to the curb and wait for a cab. The cab arrives and while we help Anderson in, he clenches his jaw in pain. A sheen of perspiration gathers on his upper lip. You ease him into the seat, but I can tell that the ride is going to be a painful one for him. Once again guilt washes over me.
John frowned.  He lifted up Sherlock’s shirt again. The bandage seemed fine to him. “Sherlock, everything looks fine.”
“Shhhherlock, you died on me several times. Not just once several times,” John stutters as he looks down.
Sherlock looked down at John while he wheeled him out of the hospital to the curb, where their cab waited. He helped him out of the wheel chair and into the cab with one swift move, kicking the wheel chair out of the way.
“We’ll be in touch,” Sherlock said as he removed his hand up to push the chair. He moved his hand in front of John’s nostrils, just long enough for his own musky scent to flood John’s olfactory senses. Then without another word he turned the chair around and wheeled John into the men’s restroom. Once they were in a stall, Sherlock knelt down on the floor and unbuckled John’s trousers.
Sherlock sniffed and then picked up John as if he weighed nothing, “John, I put bubbles in the water and also a rubber ducky.”
“I love you too, Mrs. Hudson, be safe.” Then I hang up and take the cigarette, placing it between my lips, I inhale, enjoying the mouth hit. I close my eyes, the world fades around me, the only thing I see is the puzzle, its colors swirl around, mocking me.
Sherlock led John’s horse down the trail, watching the Bedouin guide as he took them through the desert. Laura followed at a discrete distance, not wanting Sherlock or John out of her reach for long. They had only gone a short distance when a rumbling noise caught Sherlock’s attention. He turned behind him to see the source. It was a huge ball of fire that lit up the desert.”
“I’m sorry to call so late, but it’s me Elsa. I think I’m in trouble. I think someone is trying to kill me.” She whispered frantically. “John, can you meet me outside the bar where we had a drink?”
“Shut up,” Sherlock snapped shaking his head. “Mycroft, give me a boost so that I can climb up on that metal cabinet over there.”
Clare’s lips turned up in an attempt to smile. “I’ve heard that in the past you and your companion John Watson have had dealings with a Golem.”
Sherlock let John pull his body closer to that he would be able to sit up and yet still have John’s body against his back for support. Sherlock was out of breath from the small effort. “So, where is here?” he gasped.
John sighed, pulling Sherlock into him. “Remind me to fill out your comment card, Fernando, for this is by far the best room service I have ever received,” John gasped as Sherlock accurately pinpointed his spot.
John snugged closer to Sherlock, “Sherlock, I love having you here, but aren’t you going to blow your cover by showing up to work late?”
“So, you see that even though his synapses appear to be more productive than his previous scans, he’s still not functioning on all chemical levels.”
He then lifted John out of the tub and into the chair, drying him off with a towel, then rubbing lotion into his skin. John looked up at him while he worked.
Clare was the first to react as she pulled her sword on the Golem “God, they were terrifying creatures,” Sherlock thought as he observed the height, and the grotesque facial expressions of the thing in front of them. John rounded on the creature next, slashing at its neck with his sword. Clare drove her weapon into the Golem’s kneecap and he went down with a groan. John rounded on him next, his eyes feverish with the thrill of the kill that was soon to be his.  Taking his sword in both hands John plunged it into the Golem’s throat. Thrusting his hips forward John buried his sword up to the hilt in the Golem’s neck.
“I don’t understand why all of you except Clare had such a bad reaction to the portal. I came through it pretty easily.” John thought for a moment and then shrugged. “Oh, well, it’s just one of those mysteries I suppose.”
I hold out my arm to you. I stretch as far as I can until the IV wiggles a warning in my vein. You clasp my fingers and bring them to your lips. “Somehow we will get through this, Sherlock….”
You always bring out the playful side of me John. I bounce to the side, bark and lick your cheek. For a moment or two we wrestle. Then you pin me down on the bed. “Mr. Holmes, are you ready for another round.”
Sherlock attempted to concentrate on Irene’s words but memories bombarded the present until he no longer saw or observed the others, only the others from his past seemed real now. “I remember,” Sherlock thought. “I remember you all. You were all so brave.” Then his mind shut down and carried him back, back to the day his parents checked him into The Thames Hospital for Children.
John was still recovering from Sherlock’s kiss as he struggled to breathe normally, “Yes, Sherlock I will marry you.”
Before the Golem breathed his last he shrieked at John. “You are too late, human.” The rest of the sentence was cut off by a gurgling sound and then the Golem lay silent.
