"Yeah, exactly. Basically a protectress against bad spirits and demons. 'World soul' is what we called her." Janine explained. "You know, I should probably say that we had all kinds of sects and imported gods coming and going. They weren't a bad thing at all. This cult didn't have cross-dressing or castrated priests like those of Cybele or other off-putting things at first. But yeah, our teachings said that she could help us overcome the border to death.. find eternal life in death so to say. I'll spare you the details of the ritual, but it entailed a sacrifice and receiving their "Ichor".. They really took 'finding life in death' literally." Janine said and shuddered at the thought of that night.
"Yes, I'll come too, dear. And I'll have a word with Sally." Violet told Rosie, partly because she found that three small children probably were a bit much for the boys. She then turned to her youngest and tried to come up with an age-appropriate answer. "You know, some people are very mean to other people that are different from them, because they have serious problems or want to feel stronger. No one has a right to do that to anyone, love. And no one deserves to be treated like that. But, because most couples are a boy and a girl - like mummy and daddy - there a bullies who pick on boys who love boys and girls who love girls. Those people are called 'homosexual or gay. That's where the word 'homo'phobe comes from. Any questions?"
"Good, you take care of that, alright?" John asked, since he wasn't exactly up to date with those kinds of apps. After glancing at his watch, he let go of Sherlock, a bit surprised by how late it had got. "I'd better just go upstairs and get them."
"But we can't see the stars from inside!" Rosie chirped and thought for a moment, "But we can go outside and lie down on the grass!" she suggested happily.
"Scratch sleeping.." Sherlock murmured and opened his eyes to look at John, giving him a smile, "I've been up since about 4.." he said and chuckled as he leant over to press a kiss to John's cheek, "You were just way too comfortable to leave you here." he said and grinned, trailing his hand down John's side, before resting it on his hip.
that he got dragged into." he said with a small shrug. Apart from that, by telling them about this he had proven what side he was actually on.
As always Charlie stayed up reading until it was five to eleven. After slipping out of bed and grabbing her torch, she quietly walked up the stairs to Mrs Hope's office and waited for her accomplice (However, it was really tempting to just go inside by herself, now that she'd found the key anyway...). Only two minutes later though, she saw a tiny ray of light and gave the other person a little wave, figuring it was Rosie. "Hey there, Speedy Gonzales." She whispered and smirked a little when she could make out the other girl. "I like your pyjamas."
Sherlock smiled at Rosie as Sally disappeared around a corner, "So, how has your week been? Have the kids been nicer to you?" he asked and Rosie shrugged, "I don't know.. they didn't say anything, but they didn't sit with me again at the meals when they noticed I don't have any more kinder eggs." she said and Sherlock sighed, ruffling her hair, "I'm sorry, honey bee, but you'll find real friends, I promise. And you still have John and me, and my mum and Amy and Ally."
"Erm, well, Sherlock and I love each other very much, so we both know we're going to marry." John started and decided to tell her the truth. "I just haven't had the chance yet to get a ring for him and propose properly to him, you know."
Charlie came over to her and frowned as Rosie insulted her food, before chuckling when she got what was wrong. "Okay, first of all, what's wrong with spinach? And second of all, that's basil pesto. Here, if you smell your plate, you'll see it's very different." She explained and handed her carefully the smallest plate.
"Well anyway, how about we watch some of the videos now while we're waiting for the pizza?" Emma suggested, looking through the box for the tape she had mentioned before. "That sounds like a great idea." he said, grinning at John.
"Well, I avoided it too, so I'm not much less tense." Sherlock said and smirked as they entered the house. "Let's hope your dad's gun is still in his night stand." he said quietly, giving a quiet laugh.
Sherlock hummed against John's lips, getting lost in the kiss until he heard Harry clear her throat, "You guys remember that we are still here right?" Harry asked with a laugh.
"You're looking at my browsing history again?" John called back from the kitchen, where he was seated on the table, his chemistry notes scattered all over it.
Jane smiled politely and bowed as she gave their names, nudging Charlie a little to remember her to bow, before she let her into the large hall, where a lot of people had already gathered. Spotting a familiar face, Jane smiled, "Oh it seems we're in luck." she said and smiled over to the rather tall for his age, dark haired young man, she had to admit that Lowell really was a pretty young man. "Look who's there." she said and smiled as she nodded with her head into his direction.
"At least no one would believe the story." John said with a dry laugh, before taking Sherlock's hand. "Let's go to sleep, love. We've got to go back down here in roughly a handful of hours anyway."
Sherlock smiled, "Well.. yeah roughly six years. Mycroft, me and Jane were attacked on our way back from visiting you.. you know the last time we were over before I erm.. 'died'." he said and shrugged, before his eyes grew wide, "Faith! You don't know that, I nearly forgot. Jane and Mycroft are both still alive as well. La! Jane will be so happy, she was crushed when she heard about your death!" he said, not even noticing that he fell back into old slang.
"Well, the staff isn't big and good news spread easily. Besides most people here adore her." Greg said with a chuckle. "So you'll be working with us all, yeah?"
John grabbed his jacket as well as his phone (he'd known the torch app on there would be useful), before going to the door. "See you in a minute." He said with a short smile to his boyfriend, before following Harry outside. Closing the front door behind himself, he rubbed his hands together against the cold, before looking around and frowning slightly at her. "So, where's your car?"
"Do you think she knows that we almost enjoy seeing her so happy more than she enjoys this trip?" Sherlock asked, looking at John with a grin.
Sherlock snorted a laugh at that, "Your sister was dating a turtle in your dream and you didn't think that might be a hint to.. you know.. being a dream?" he asked with a smirk as he followed John and Charlie down the stairs.
John smirked and got to his feet; he could always muster some strength for that. "Good, let's go then, shall we?"
"Don't remind me.." Sherlock said and took off his coat, before he walked into the kitchen to pour himself a glass of blood.
"That does sound intriguing." John agreed. "I didn't really love the idea of a couples night but this is something else entirely. Especially with the children in the orphanage that community is bound to grow." He nodded.
Yeah, they were so soul mates. Charlie chuckled and leaned back against the counter, feeling quite special to be back here in the first place. "So which school do you go to?"
''Ah, okay. Are we talking just maths here or anything else?" Greg asked after a moment, because with their shortage in teachers he believed Dorothy would hire people even before they were teachers. But damn... this fellah reminded him of someone.
"What? No, I haven't checked, I assumed she had told you that she had had a nightmare." Charlie said, before frowning; she still didn't like this, especially after that dream she didn't want to take any chances. "You check upstairs, I check downstairs."
"Erm, okay, he's begun to snore. ... Yeah, he really is. ... Yep, see you." John hung up and put the phone away again. Christ, Sherlock was bloody adorable right now; Half mucus, by the looks of it, and half precious. Since he didn't want to wake him up right away he stroked his hair for a few more minutes before untangling himself from his boyfriend.
"Mmh, let's do it after dinner. So I've got something to look forward to." Charlie said with a smile. "And John's upstairs now?"
John looked at him and gave a laugh, because of how suddenly that had come. "Quite mad, I should think. And as tempting as it still is, I want those flower girls on our actual wedding."
John was a little disappointed when Sherlock was up on his feet that quickly and smiled a little to himself at those questions. "I don't really have to see everything right now love." He said, before rising to his feet and going up to Sherlock. The room was cosy enough for him as it was, so he wouldn't have a problem with staying right here. Standing close to the other again, he wrapped an arm around his torso and looked up at him.
"Come on you can't be serious." John looked up, unsure if Sherlock was laughing because he'd bought his joke. "But that aside, you can't possibly want to share your bank account with your boyfriend of less than a bloody month."
"Because it's... unnatural." David said eventually, sounding a little defensive; which in itself was absurd, since that view wasn't something he kept a secret. "Marriage is between a man and a woman. It's only proper and balanced and originally I wanted my children to have a more respectable position in society."
"Yeah, it probably is." He said with a bit of a smile and ran a hand lazily up and down Sherlock's back. He was starting to get tired again, but wanted to stay awake until Sherlock was beginning to relax. Not as if he was going to tell his boyfriend though.
"Well, yeah.. but to be honest, I think he was extra hesitant because one of his kids was still undecided since becoming more or less immortal also means he'd have to watch you die if you after all had decided against it." Sherlock said with a shrug.
"He absolutely hasn't." Sherlock said and frowned again sitting down next to John, "I guess part of it was that he witnessed how I felt after Victor died. Guess that wasn't exactly encouraging him to go and find someone for himself."
"I'm sure he does.. he talks about it sometimes, but he wasn't sure how to pull it off.. or if your dad would even want to see him again after he'd been away for so long.. and of course.. there's that thing with all of you being sceptics." he said and laughed, "I really think we should tell your father what I am first, before we even mention your grandfather."
"And I take it you two are spending the day together because you enjoy each other's company the so much, yeah?" Greg asked, looking amused.
Sherlock chuckled, "The picture of Dorian Gray.. I mean.. a guy that stays young over decades?" he asked and chuckled, "Ring a bell?" he laughed.
"Yeah, true." Charlie chuckled and stepped inside the café. "Oh, it's nice here." She commented, glancing around.
Two hours later Janine was sitting on Sherlock's lap, her one arm on his shoulder and the other holding her champagne glass. "...And then I gave gave him my big, sad eyes and put on my best German milk-maid accent 'Bitte, Herr officer, these miles and kilomtres are so confusing.. And I just can't be late for my Onkel Franze's funeral..' " Janine said with an exaggerated German accent, before beginning to laugh in earnest. "It did work, though. What about you, Harry?"
"We go shopping, I guess." Sherlock said and laughed, shrugging a little, "I suppose that's the risk we agreed to take when we took them in. And really.. they've been deprived of so much for so long.. they do deserve a good deal of spoiling before we start making sure they won't become too spoiled." he said and smiled.
"We're just waiting for Sally to return with some glue and-" John told Sherlock and got up to his feet, when he noticed a little incredulously the packed plastic bag in his hand. "how much chocolate did you just buy??"
"Good, that's noted. And I'll try my best not to." John said with a chuckle and grabbed his keys, before opening the front door. "Love you, Sher" He called into the kitchen, before turning back around.
"Oi, Amy, that's not a nice thing to say to your sister." Sherlock said and Ally frowned, "But you called Mycroft fattie, that's not a nice thing to say to your brother!" Ally said and Sherlock cleared his throat, glancing at his mother, "No, no you're right, it wasn't a nice thing to say and I will apologise to him and you should apologise to your sister as well, because it's important to apologise when you've been rude to someone that's important to you." he said and frowned, being a trainee dad really had left a mark on his manners.
Sherlock smiled, "They're not super thrilled about any of this still, but... I think they're starting to accept it. And well.. after that talk with your father, I'm pretty sure he's realised that his main concern is the happiness of his children and that they're having a good life, rather than what gender their partner has." he said and smiled at Harry who was a bit too stunned to speak right now. "He hasn't announced it exactly, but I'm pretty sure he'll apologise to you /and/ Clara." Sherlock continued and Harry huffed a laugh, feeling a bit dizzy about all of that, "Can.. one of you two drive perhaps?" Harry asked after a moment, "I've got to process that first." she said with a laugh. "Oh sure, I can." Sherlock said, getting out of the car and switching places with Harry, who sat down next to John. "You think he will apologise to Clara?" she asked, looking at John.
"Yeah, erm, I was surprised actually when Sherlock told me you were fine with us two. He's always been very... conservative in those things. Refused to visit Harry's wedding actually and had pretty much broken off contact until today, I think." He said, assuming Richard knew about Harry as well. "We introduced Sherlock to our family and, even though he looked like was going to kill him in the beginning, he didn't throw us out. And even hugged Sherlock when we left. I think there aren't many people in our family though who haven't done that yet though."
"Wow, sounds like I've missed quite a lot." John said, before listening to the rest of Sherlock's story and how his initial suspicions had been confirmed. "Jesus" John said eventually. "That's... bad."
"Thank you!" Rosie chirped and looked around again, grinning widely, before bursting out laughing, "Mycroft why are you the only bumblebee?" she asked and Sherlock snorted a laugh, "Er.. there must have been some.. mistake when we ordered the costumes.." he said and tried to look innocent, but spectacularly failing.
Charlie smirked a bit at the praise, before asking. "But what do we do now? We can't just call him, can we?" She looked back and forth between them. "No, that's not really an option. We still have to decide what to do with those people." John said and sighed; Charlie didn't like that answer... She didn't know better either, but waiting just seemed... wrong. "He might we fixing the computers tomorrow again."
John chuckled at that. "Guess it's my turn now. By the way, didn't you say something about a tank once?" He asked and traced his fingertips aimlessly across Sherlock's upper back.
Sherlock chuckled softly, "Alright in short, think for yourself, but if we tell you something's dangerous or not good for you, then don't you bloody do it." he said and gave her a smile. "Look how about you try to sleep for a while? That'll give the medicine time to do what it's supposed to and you'll get some relief."
Sherlock pouted a little, but let go of John and sat up a bit, holding his forehead to cool it a little.
"It's actually just the Hobbit" John said with a smile and kissed the top of his head. "But yeah, sounds good to me. Do you think Charlie would like that one too?"
"Hm, but at least the first few decades she must've made sure that wasn't going to happen." Greg commented and pulled out his keys as well as a draft of the house. "Okay, Charlie. Your box is on the second floor in this room. It's got your initials and birth year on the front, alright?" Greg showed her after letting them inside. "Understood well and clearly. I'm waiting for you there." She said with a nod, before running off again with a chuckle. She wanted at least a few seconds to herself when she looked at her biological parents' stuff... plus, she couldn't wait any longer.
"Neither did I and that's what they were counting on, apparently." John said, biting down his anger.
John, who felt like he was intruding a moment, stepped quietly outside again, closing the door behind him. "I love you so much, darling. And I'm glad neither of us have to worry about you getting your tea anymore." Violet smiled and ruffled her hand tenderly through his hair, before pulling back.
Charlie frowned when she saw Sherlock's expression. "What is it? You've got that look on your face again."
"Oh, no I don't." Sherlock said, pouring just a little bit of his blood into his coffee cup, stirring the mixture, "Probably they've figured almost no one would come on valentines day anyway.. at least not to uni.." he said with a smirk.
John grinned as he watched Sherlock stumble out of bed and went over to his boyfriend with a chuckle. "I really don't mind to be the one responsibly for making you squirm on your seat." He leaned in to casually run a hand through his dark, dishevelled curls. "Sex hair suits you, handsome." John said with a fond smile.
"I want to be your friend too!" Ally exclaimed before Rosie could answer and the little blonde smiled happily, "You can both be my friends." she said and Sherlock watched the scene with a fond smile, he really enjoyed seeing Rosie so happy. "And I don't know if I'm an animal expert, but I know some things about animals." she said and chuckled, "Did you know that bees cuddle in winter so they stay warm? They all cuddle up in their hive and form a big cuddle ball!" she explained.
"What is it?" His wife returned and stood in the door. "We've got a gay in the house, apparently." He told her angrily. "All rotten, the lot we take in.." He said, before striking William across his face with his free hand. "Stop it, you disgrace!" "Oh Lord.." His wife said and clasped a hand in front of her mouth. "What are we going to do with him? Call the vicar?" She asked, not even looking at William anymore. "No, call the police. I don't want anything to do with this."
"What? No. I- "John began, before focusing his eyes properly on Sherlock this time. "I think I might love you too much, if anything. Does that make-" He shook his head in an attempt to clear his mind a bit. "We're good. Definitely good, I'm sorry I'm like this right now." He told Sherlock and looked at him for a few seconds so the other would see he meant it. "I just need a shower right now."
Lowell looked all but crushed as Charlie said goodbye, but quickly gathering his manners and standing up to give Charlie a bow, "I'm looking forward to it." he said and smiled at her again, but remembering much too late that he hadn't asked where she was staying, so he didn't even know where to start looking, but Jane had led Charlie away already. "Are you out of your mind?" Jane asked, once they were outside and a bit away from the crowd. "You can't just.. I mean.. how could you... your father is going to kill me." she said, but soon her expression softened, "How was it then? If I'm going to suffer for your pleasure, I at least want some details." she said and chuckled a little.
"Well yeah that must have been dangerous." Sherlock said and frowned lightly, "Anyway, I agree though that it would be nice meeting a couple that's in the same situation.. or even a vampire vampire couple for that matter..." he said and Richard nodded, "Yeah.. that would add some normality to the whole situation.." he said with a smile, "Well at least we know some vampires, so at least sometimes we can actually be who we are, that's also worth something." Richard said nipping at his wine.
"Rosie isn't in our bed.." Sherlock said with a frown, oh no not again. "Are you sure she isn't upstairs?" he asked, growing nervous again.
"Thank you." Charlie said with a smile and put on the bonnet, almost feeling sorry for covering up her new hairdo. "Shall we go outside then?" She asked them.
John chuckled and gave Sherlock's earlobe one last suck, before pulling back to look Sherlock in the eye. Running a hand through his curls, he pecked his boyfriend's lips and smirked at him. "Such a gorgeous thing... It's bloody hard not to go for a metaphorical dinner right now."
"Sure, I've got you." Charlie said with a smile; it was pretty cool to have Rosie look up to her a little. "Is that the guy that helped you hand out those surprise eggs?" She asked and remembered those two new fellahs sitting at the small children's table.
Sherlock chuckled, "I half expect Mark to stand in the living room waiting for us because he remembered he didn't hug me." he said and turned to look at John. "Your family sure is a fan of hugs." he chuckled.
"It's incredible that she did find photos at all though, it a good deal of digging to find that hospital in the first place, it was a rather small one and it didn't even exist that long, nothing spectacular happened there." Sherlock said and sighed.
"Oh, shut it, I wasn't the one who shared a dress with Harry yesterday. Speaking of which, we had /sex/ on /my sister's underwear/?" He said with a scrunched face, as he looked at the offending piece of clothing, before getting out of bed for good.
"That's alright, I'll just be on my way." Viktor said and ignored the phone, as he shouldered his backpack and (to Fay's disappointment) called Scout to get him back to his side. "Good night" John said, still a bit surprised as he walked out of the door. "Night" And with that he was out of the house.
John's jaw tightened just a little at the last part, but since he knew that was ridiculous, he swallowed another bite before saying. "Yeah, that's him. Any idea what he's doing there at this time of the year?"
"Guess so." Sherlock said and smirked at John, "Are we going to make it a competition? Who gets there last pays the lube?" he asked with a grin.
"Hm..." Rosie said and thought very hard about that, "Like tea when it's still too hot to drink?" she asked and looked at Charlie questioningly.
"I-, yeah, sure. See you later." Charlie nodded and got to her feet. Right, they'd have to go to Mrs. Turner now.
John took Sherlock's hand and smiled. "Oh, I definitely agree. This is better." He looked over at the other man for a while and gave his hand a gentle squeeze. "I love you."
"I do, but I like it a lot when you remind me." John said with a smile and rested his head against Sherlock's, getting out some tea bags. "I love you too."
"Not yet, but well, she was sort of distracted and anyway, it's her thing when or if she talks to us about it." Sherlock said, looking up at John with a smile, "I mean, eventually in a couple of months or so if she hasn't said a word about it, we can probably ask, but even then we should respect if she wants to keep this all to herself."
"So how did the manslaughter go..." Harry said with a laugh, "How bad was it, I want all the dirty details, boys. Oh and.. just for the record. I. Told. You. So." she said, turning around to face the two of them, while Sherlock got into the car, "Why are you looking so happy? Is that some sort of psychotic breakdown reaction?" she asked incredulously.
"Sounds like a plan." John nodded; they really couldn't just throw it in the bin without an explanation. "And after tonight's events Rosie might actually do that anyway in the morning." John said with a bit of a smile.
"Well, I can't deny that it's a positive factor." John chuckled faintly, before leaning in to kiss Sherlock, just in time remembering the wine and running his hand through the other's hair instead.
Sherlock took a deep breath once they were outside with the closed door behind them, "Well.. that went.. surprisingly well." he said and smiled, moving his arm around John as well. "No offence, though, but ... your aunt is a bitch. And I don't use that word lightly." he said and sighed a little. "I honestly like your dad though." he said with a smile, "And well, no need to mention that your mother is amazing."
Sherlock smiled as he lay down with John, nestling against his chest, sighing fondly, "Can I ask you something?" he asked quietly and tilted his head to look up at John.
John frowned a little at that. "Hm, what- oh. Right. I forgot." He said and chuckled a bit. "That bit's still weird, I guess."
"Yeah, still no tomatoes for me." John said with a nod. "Pity, John, you're missing out." Charlie teased lightly, which made John shake his head with a chuckle.
"Well, I thank you for that." John commented with a smirk and waited for Sherlock in the door frame.
"Don't be ridiculous, of course I don't. So, does an hour sound alright?" He asked with a smile, incredibly happy for his boyfriend. Though, it was kinda strange that their families were already intertwined like that.
"That's so true though, that distinction just turns you off half the best books." Charlie said with a smile. "And I've actually just read the Hobbit."
"So as a matter of prudence, I've already bought everything we need." John said with a chuckle. "Wouldn't want to waste our time in a queue."
John leaned towards Sherlock a little him. "You sure you're alright? you look sick to your stomach." He commented a bit more quietly.
Just as they're lips touched, the sound of their door interrupted them. "So, there we are, girls." You could hear Mrs. Hudson saying in the living room, before Charlie quickly pointed out. "Look, there's Dad's wet jacket, Rosie. What do we deduce from that?"
John did the same thing and wrapped an arm around Sherlock's waist to pull him close. "This will have to do then" He said and turned up the TV volume two or three notches higher than usual.
John looked shocked at the sudden revelation and his expression softened when he slowly began to realise what that could have all meant for his boyfriend. "Wait, you were a patient there?" He asked gently. "Why?"
"Mostly fantasy. The Hobbit and stuff. And well.. if you promise not to tell anyone.. I do have about every book Jane Austen's ever written. I like the way she's captured the time she's lived in." Ron said and blushed a little, "I don't really think there are girl books and boy books.. I mean.. always depends on the story."
After they were gone Rosie went to bed fairly quickly after that and Charlie too was in reading her room one or two hours later. Now that the flat was unusually quiet and they were all lying in their beds, John turned to look at Sherlock. "Now, today was unexpected, wasn't it?"
Clara's eyes widened a little as she shook her little cousin's hand. He, he was a vampire too? He had been all this time? What in the... And she could tell by the look on his face that she wasn't just imagining things. "Heavens, I almost forgot to give you two this." She said after a second of probably awkward staring and reached in her bag to get out a small bottle of wine, not even noticing she'd used their old speak. John all the while frowned at the way the the two were staring at each other. After Sherlock didn't look back at him, he shot Harry a glance that said 'What the hell? Have they shagged and we don't know it?'
"That's right, but I do end up sharing the foods with him that we can both eat. But he can't eat for example onions." Viktor explained kindly to Rosie. Meanwhile John remembered that this was there first completely blood free meal in... months. Or was it? "Did you by any chance put tomatoes into-" He began to ask Charlie who shook her head. "No no, I used the traditional recipe."
"Hmm, we could get muffins for breakfast in that case. Or waffles with syrup." John suggested. Not because he was hungry, but because waffles with syrup were a much nicer thing to think about. Maybe that'd help put Sherlock's mind at ease a bit.
"So.. M-I-S-T-L-E-T-O-E?" Rosie asked, putting the two words together already, "I think I can write that." she said with a smile.
"Alright." Sherlock said and chuckled lightly, "I think there barely is anymore we can do, since actual witness protection would probably be a step to far.." he said and sighed, "It really drives me up the wall that we can't even say, okay, we'll train them in self defence or something, since the people they need protection from are very likely immortal."
Rosie shook her head, "I can practice the letters some more until you're back!" she chirped, taking a bite of her lunch, "Maybe you can try to figure our how to write 'sober' and 'rise' all on your own." he said and smiled, "You can write both with the letters you've learnt."
"No, obviously not." John said and shook his head. "It's nothing he needs to worry about." He said and followed along. And it was true; however this was going to end, Sherlock would never know, which was comforting, since he had a feeling Sherlock might not agree with him.
"No, I promise you I won't." John said and brought Sherlock hand up to kiss the back of it. He could genuinely see how it was a terrifying thought that someone was willing to do that for you; which was exactly why he hadn't wanted Sherlock to find out in the first place. "Not that I hope we'll ever be in a situation like that."
"Well.. maybe therapy would be helpful. But I'm still not confident about letting them walk free either way." Sherlock said and sighed, "I keep thinking that a secret vampire society would be incredibly useful. If we'd have an own legal system in place, it would make things easier. But the logistics of a secret vampire prison would be incredibly difficult to work out, especially since prisoners could just call the actual police given the chance and tell them they've been abducted.”
"Uh maybe let her be for tonight at least?" Sherlock said and chuckled a little, taking John's hand to make sure he wouldn't go upstairs, "Just let her enjoy it a little. She's only just met him, she's probably replaying their meeting in her head and staring at the photo she took of him, writing a diary entry.."
"Right. They didn't take any photographs of you towards the end, did they?" John asked after a moment, not wanting Charlie to find something else that'd scare her today.
"Good, I'm glad." John said and closed the door behind himself, careful not to be too fast, because damn, Victor was impressive; the story book picture of a trained 18th century soldier. He could definitely see what Sherlock liked about him and he certainly didn't want to get into a fight with him in any case."Right, you call him William here." John remembered and shook his head a little. "Okay, so first off, do you already know about his, erm, I don't know how to put this in case-" John began carefully, before spotting tell-tale bruises on Victor's neck; thank God, he already knew about the vampire thing. "Good, forget what I just said." He said. "Going by your literal love bites, I'm safe to assume you know about the vampire thing too, right?" He asked, just so that they were on the same page.
"Well.. yeah, she's not that good.. she just doesn't really get the hang of it, maybe I could ask Lowell if he could give her some guitar lessons, she would probably really like that." Sherlock said with a chuckle, smiling when the big ben came into view, they could just about make it.
At least this felt only half as embarrassing now. And Sherlock would have said something if she had made it up. And he had to chuckle a bit at how sweet she looked with her strawberry shampoo. "That's very kind of you, but I've got my own. But could you maybe look after Scout while I'm away?" He asked her, before glancing questioningly over at Sherlock, who had seemed fine with her being around the dog.
"Yup, I made an older girl tell me after reading that there's a subject called 'vampire studies' on her time table. I mean, this hole story - well, all of those little lies you're being told as a child - doesn't really add up, if you've once only cut your finger and put it into your mouth." She said and shrugged and let them into their room. "Also explains why practically no one comes by to adopt."
"Are you serious?" John asked her quietly, but couldn't help a chuckle, before sneaking his mobile out of his bag pocket. David rolled his eyes and continued to twirl next to Rosie now that he knew she was having fun; and so was he to be honest.
"Boring!" Rosie said and smiled at John, "But now it's not boring anymore, because you're here.. the other kids don't play with me.." she mumbled, her smile faltering a little, "They say I'm stupid because I don't like boring games, like playing mummy and daddy..." she said and frowned, "It's stupid.. and I don't even know how to play because I don't remember my mummy and daddy.." she said and Sherlock sighed, lifting the little girl up again, "You know what, even if you don't really remember them, they sure remember you.. and from what I've heard from the others, they loved you very much, sweetheart, remembering that is enough." he said and smiled softly as Rosie nodded, leaning her head against his shoulder again.
John chuckled and smiled back at him. "You have to ask?" With that he leaned into Sherlock again and kissed him, not caring about the state of either of their lips
"Sounds like a reasonable idea." Sherlock said with a smile and gave John a soft push towards his father, not bothering to be subtle about it, wouldn't hurt the Watson men to realise that they needed a push sometimes, all of them, really.
John nodded at that and smiled back at him. "I know you aren't. But thanks for reminding me of that... And I love you too. More than I can say." He said and kissed Sherlock's lips lightly, now that he was conveniently turned to him anyway.
John continued with his ministrations and went on to call his aunt. "Hi, Vanessa. Yeah, good, thank you. ... No, it's about Sherlock actually. ... No, he's come down with the flu. ... Yeah, he's quite miserable frankly and he's been asking for you. Could you maybe- ... yeah? Great, he'll be glad to hear that." John smiled, before he looked over at Sherlock. "Sher, do you want to talk to her over the phone?"
"Well who knows, maybe your photography takes a private detective turn." Sherlock said with a chuckle, "I'm sure you could do it, with your mind, I'm sure you'd already be a better detective than three fourths of London's police." he said earnestly.
"She is.." Sherlock said and held out the small cut on his finger for John to see, it had been larger fore but it was rapidly healing with a double dose of vampire saliva, it was looking just like he had pricked himself with a needle, but he figured John would get the point. "Normal canines wouldn't cut like that... just.. what's going on? Do you think that Vanessa woman... I mean.. would she do that? Turn her daughter? Is she even a vampire? Even if Amy was ill, which is the only partly reasonable reason to do that... wouldn't dying be better than staying two years old forever?"
Sherlock sighed, "I've survived two wars, I sincerely doubt I could get traumatised by another one." Sherlock said and closed his eyes, "Just.. promise me that if you do decide to turn, we'll do it before you leave." he mumbled, opening his eyes again.
"Excuse me, Mister!" Daphne said, tugging at the sleeve of the taller one, "Are you Shaggy?" she asked, finally figuring out why they seemed familiar. They looked like Shaggy and Fred! "Are you detectives? Because I'm too! I've watched you the whole time and you didn't even notice!" she babbled on, chuckling happily.
"It'll still make her uncomfortable to know we're right on the other side of the door." Sherlock said and chuckled a little, "Uhm.. I don't know.. I've thought it sometimes, it just never really seemed like an option, being constantly 18 years old and looking it makes it hard to adopt.."
"Okay granted. You so have to tell me the best story you've come up with so far some time." Charlie chuckled and looked around the room. "Whoa, this is almost twice the size of mine."
"Well, yes." Sherlock said and chuckled a little, "But who knows, maybe she runs into another vampire boy at some point, at least with Lowell we know that he knows that I can actually kill him if he dares to hurt her. Another vampire boy might not know that, since he wouldn't know we're all vampires as well."
"Ah don't worry about that..." Sherlock said and chuckled, "He's still ridiculous, you don't even have to watch some of his worse clothing choices to see that." he said and shuffled up a bit closer to John, moving his arms around him, "Is it strange for you? To.. well to see me like that?" he asked and pointed at the screen, "Seeing me... well live and breath on footage that was recorded more than a hundred years ago?"
Charlie almost imploded when she heard Lowell began to sing the song he'd written for, well, them... Even if he didn't know, they had a song now. About their first kiss. And they were gonna sing it together. Eeep...
"Definitely. Though I have some constant reminders with my brother and Jane, my mother.. Clara." Sherlock said and looked at Janine. "Do you know anyone from your time?"
"Yeah? I'm already excited to meet him then." Rosie said with a smile. "What do they know, what we others don't?" She asked curiously.
Jane smiled and pulled her along as she started to walk towards him, "Well, I'll introduce you two and you bow after that, he will bow too, so that'll be your cue." she said and smiled at Lowell, "Good evening, Mr Trevor." she said and bowed, waiting for him reply, "Good evening Miss Jane." Lowell said and bowed as well, looking curiously at Charlie and giving her a smile, "Mr Trevor, may I introduce Miss Charlotte Watson to you?" she asked and Lowell smile grew just a little wider as he bowed to her, "Good evening, Miss Watson." he said and Jane smiled, she could tell that Lowell was just waiting for the common small talk to be over and it was appropriate for him to ask her to dance with him. Those two had palpable chemistry, she found.
Charlie glanced up at Sherlock and John with a small smile, before John said. "Yes, that's exactly it, even though we still should've thought of it either way. I'm glad you've still found out." He said, not really knowing what else to say, though Charlie quickly took over for him, quite excited they had people over just because of Rosie and herself. (Already having known Violet anyway, she hadn't really thought much about the fact John and Sherlock had families.) "Yeah, so am I. Do you live in London too?"
Oh! Wait, Clara was a vampire too? Okay, that turn of events he wouldn't have expected... Well, he should have expected that probably. She looked exactly like the day they'd married and 'spends money like she's been saving it for centuries'... And Sherlock had talked about the uncle who'd let him inside Newgate, hadn't he? At least she wouldn't leave Harry because of her vampire grandfather. "Well, that's a better answer than that you two looked at old antiquities in the bedroom, while exchanging make-up tips." He said with just a bit of a huff. Sherlock could've really told him earlier, so he was still a little grumpy. (Even if he couldn't have, at least John would've liked him to)
"No, not really." Charlie agreed a sigh. "But it's a nice gesture, I guess. And still better than being told you should feel bad; at least a lot of the time." She said and gave him a bit of a smile; it was always nice to be able to talk to him.
"Right.." William mumbled and frowned a bit, "I suppose talking is the more pleasant one then?" he asked warily.
"Yeah." Rosie said and nodded, "I they look almost the same! I thought both have to be the same way around." she said and frowned, finding that to be the only logical concept.
"Hm, right.." Clara said with a frown, not sure what she had expected here. "Oh, there she comes." She said and gave Janine a smile. "I hope you haven't missed me too much" She said with a chuckle and picked her glass of champagne back up after sitting down next to Sherlock.
"Well then I know who's not going to nursery tomorrow." Sherlock said and frowned at Charlie, "You don't have to go to school either, we could say you both have the flu." he said and sighed, "Although it might be less suspicious if only Rosie doesn't go to the orphanage.. but if you're afraid you don't have to either. I'll be there the whole time though, I'll ask Greg if I can go into your class for a week or two, I mean, it's after all a sort of work experience so it'd be easy to pass it off as just getting a look what teaching higher grades is like."
Sherlock smiled and handed the driver a fifty pound note, "Keep the change." he said and got out of the car, holding his hand out for John, "So... lets see what they have to tell us then.." he said, "Either way.. after today I at least won't have to fake a migraine anymore, so that's good." he said and chuckled.
"Shit." John commented yet again and was quiet for a while, because really that seemed to be an ongoing theme in this story. "And I didn't at all mean that as a reproach. I only wondered what the rest of your time there was like."
"Yeah, that's not where we're going. It's right over the street, but I'm not saying more." John said with a chuckle, now that the trees around the lake were coming in sight. Checking his watch, he was quite glad they were just early enough to catch the start of sunset in a few minutes.
"I mean, Hufflepuff scarves sort of loom like they're bee-themed so not everything would be completely new." Charlie said with a smile. "I wonder what house Rosie'd be in. My guess is Hufflepuff or Gryffindor." She commented and John smiled, quite proud she seemed to be that much into Harry Potter.
"No, I think you're right." Charlie said with a sigh. John walked into the kitchen and pulled a chair up to sit down ext to Charlie and Sherlock. "Okay, Mrs. Hudson's looking after Rosie until we're done here. "What could this guy want from us? I feel like the personal attack on Sherlock might be a bit of a stretch."
"Profiling?" John asked and turned to lie on his back, still looking at Sherlock. "Sounds like a crime show. Glad to hear you haven't been bored to bits though."
"I'm not saying she is involved, but we have to consider that it might be the case, even if unlikely." Sherlock said and ran a hand through his hair, "Until we know what to make of this, we just have to lie low and pretend everything is okay. If that guy really is behind this, we've got the advantage that he doesn't know yet that we know."
Charlie gave him a small grin. "Amber did me a bit of a solid yesterday.. Or well, we played truth or dare and I dared her to call Lowell for real and ask him about his first kiss. But she like actually did it, even though I didn't expect her too, but you know I was really curious... Anyway, she pretended to conduct a survey - I think she's done that as a summer job before because she sounded very professional and all - and then she ended up asking him about his first kiss. And now guess what he said!" Charlie said, practically beaming; if she'd been any less enthusiastic about the whole thing she'd have probably been too embarrassed to have told him.
"Well.. when that money is up, you'll get another donation like that. It's just.. there was this little girl, Rosie, she told me something, she said that there wasn't enough money for an experiment she wanted to do, thank her for that extra 0 on the cheque. I just think the kids here should have the means to be able to use their talents, be it science, computers..whatever. All I really want in return for the donations is that when a kid shows talent for something, encourage it, get them what they need to work on it." he said and chuckled, "Even if it's indigents for a fingerprint powder recipe they saw on a kids show on TV."
"It's just us!" Sherlock called back and chuckled a little as he crouched down to the little ones, "There's my bee troop." he said and hugged the girls as well.
Sherlock nodded, "Alright." he said and cleaned the crook of John's arm with rubbing alcohol before he established the vascular access and attaching the tube, taking a deep breath as John's blood started to fill the transparent tube, leading into the measuring cup, where Sherlock had attached it with some adhesive tape. "And there we go..." he said and looked up at John.
"So a life sentence to solitary confinement is worse than death, hm? Wouldn't it be noticeable though? If someone just won't die nor age?" Charlie asked after a moment. The thought of something like that happening to people was horrific, but she was glad someone actual told her about all of this for once.
"Don't tell Mycroft or we might get a few other surprises with him." John said with a laugh. "And what did Greg say about him? I can't really imagine him to be a romantic."
"You mean for instance when your vampire boyfriend is suffering from some ages old trauma?" Sherlock asked with a small smile, leaning over to peck John's cheek, "Thanks, though.. it's appreciated." he mumbled, leaning back in his chair and putting the laptop on his lap.
John chuckled. "Do you think we should maybe invite them to a double date?" He suggest mostly to tease Sherlock.
John chuckled a bit and nodded, giving his mother an amused look. "Yeah, Dad. Come on. I've tried it as well." He said, though his father didn't look to eager.
Charlie came down the stairs with a bright grin on her face. She'd just about had one of the coolest dreams ever, including her entire family in cosplay and a happy ending. Jeez, she wished her actual first kiss could play out like that (especially with her paps' second/ final reaction) it had just been too brilliant for words. And kudos to her imaginations for that image of Lowell, nice...
"Making out is very social." Sherlock said and chuckled, looking for a moment longer at John, before he turned on the car, "So if anything, I'm improving your social abilities." he smirked.
When classes were over, Sherlock went to Charlie's room to let her know that Mrs Hope had agreed (and even found that it was a good idea) for her to go out with them for dinner. Smiling, he knocked at the girl's door.
"Right, we were the only ones at the table yesterday.." John remembered with a frown. "Yeah, kids can be cruel." He said with a sigh. He hoped he could get her to join the rugby team; in his experience that could do wonders for the team spirit in a group.
"I am..." Sherlock said and feeling a semblance of compassion, he added, "And well, I know him a bit, we talk about this and that... you know small talk like for instance that he's single.... not that you'd be interested in that kind of thing.." he said, trying to keep every hint of mocking out of his voice (because if he was honest, mocking was generally the tone of voice he always used with his brother.)
"Uh.. hey." Ron said as he opened the door and poked his head in with a smile, "Don't worry I've got permission to be up here and all." he said and chuckled a little, "Is it okay if I come in?" he asked, just to be sure, he really didn't want to mess this up.
William crossed his arms in front of his chest against the chilly air in the room once the nurse had left the room, taking a deep breath and enjoying the moment of privacy.
"I'm always nice to Mrs Hudson!" Rosie said and smiled as Sherlock crouched down to hug Rosie as well.
"No one asked you," Sherlock said and shot his brother a look. "Although then again, the fact that he thinks it's a good idea makes it seem like a terrible idea."
"Tell me what?" Amber asked immediately, turning to look at her step-mother questioningly, who in turn had begun to chuckle too. "Yeah, go ahead."
Sherlock smiled, "Sure, I can." he said and looked at John, "Can you lift Rosie up?" he asked as he crouched down to pick up Amy and Ally, who didn't even ask since it really wasn't the first time Lock had held both of them at the same time. "Do you think the bees still look the same? Or did they move?" Rosie asked as she walked over to John, looking up at him.
"Yes. It was rare, but there were people that actually got married at your age." Sherlock said and frowned, "And don't you even think about marrying Lowell here." he said, half joking, half serious as he knocked at the door of Jane's house, "You need to do a little bow like that," he said and demonstrated how a young lady would bow, "If we meet Jane's mother, don't bow to the maid that will open the door, she's lower in rank than you are, so she will bow to you. With Jane it doesn't really matter, even with the danger that we'll end up in one of her books, I'll tell her the whole story anyway. She's a vampire, she's a bit more open minded about unbelievable things."
Charlie pocketed her photo and turned on her torch, before beginning to walk back downstairs. "True. That's why you shouldn't hang it up on your wall. But if Sherlock frames it for you, you can still put in into your bookshelf, drawer or hang it on the inside of your wardrobe." She suggested.
John looked over to him and nodded, before swallowing dryly. How on earth had that been an actual possibility? Obviously he had believed it at the time, but now that he was back here with his family... He'd actually talked to Victor and he almost didn't get to have any of- literally anything. That hadn't /just/ been a dream. "Jesus Christ" He muttered to himself, before clearing his throat and pulling himself together as best he could so as not to scare the girls (he'd even made that promise to Victor, hadn't he?...) "I need some time to myself, Sher. Could I just leave you here with the girls while I go outside for am hour?" He asked him after a while.
Sherlock followed quietly, wondering where they were going, but having a distinct feeling they were moving closer to the gun. "You are not planning to murder me, are you? Sir?" Sherlock asked only half joking and giving a nervous chuckle, chewing on his lips. He was praying to anyone who'd listen that Mr Watson would be ruining the whatever changes John had made about his opinion on his father.
"Well, I don't think I'll have chance to find out about something like this at this point." Sherlock said with a small smile, "I think I'd like it though.. I mean.. if I were in your dads position and would meet my mother or father again.. I'd be thankful.." he mumbled.
Sherlock chuckled, "Hm, I think I know how to annoy him quite well already." he said and smiled as he got out of the car, "And don't worry, I won't. If he can't deal with it.. it's his loss. He'd have to be very stupid to abandon great kids like both of you are though.."
Sherlock sighed as he finally caught up with Richard, "It's okay, really." he said, figuring why Richard had left so abruptly, "It's not okay, do you know who that is? It's my grandson, Sherlock. He's probably seen photos of me. How do you want to explain that?" Richard rambled nervously and Sherlock took a deep breath, "In fact, I have already explained it. He knows what we are and that we know each other.. and well that's why I called you over. He wanted to meet you." Sherlock explained and Rich frowned, visibly calming down a little, "Wait... if you know who he is.. why the hell are you making out with him?" Richard asked with a raised brow and Sherlock laughed softly, "Well.. let's just say.. you're pretty much my soon to be grandfather in law.." he said and smirked, "Oh you and him are... right.. right. Well that's good. I guess... you sure it's okay if I come back upstairs with you?" Richard asked and Sherlock nodded, "Yeah.. John really wants to meet you." he said, before gesturing Rich to follow as he made his way back up the stairs with him. "John.." Sherlock said as he entered the flat, "May I introduce you to your grandfather." he continued as Richard walked back into the flat, "Hello, John..." Rich said hesitantly, clearing his throat a little.
"Case in point." Sherlock said with a chuckle relating to his comment about the plus sides of having a family. "Wanna sit down with us, we were just having a sweet and awkward conversation." he said with a smirk.
"Hm, weird. I'd actually kind of like to know who the people in this group are.. Just out of interest. From what you've said they're probably brainwashed anyway. A few moments later John returned from the loo. "Have I missed anything? He asked with a warm smile and sat back down next to Sherlock. "By the way, I've just told Angelo what we want to eat."
"What are we having for lunch today anyway?" Charlie asked him from the back. Their fridge was literally almost empty so there was technically no reason to cook one of their favourites.
"You'd like that, hm? A house full of squealing little kids?" John asked with a chuckle. "And we could always move into a house if we're deciding to have a family. Although... that would feel a little strange; imagining us anywhere but 221.”
"I don't think I was, but that was a different situation, for a start, I was an adult when she left. I was very sad, yes. But.. not really angry, I mean after all that's the way it goes normally. Your parents die at some point, but it isn't supposed to happen when you're that young. Just like a parent shouldn't have to bury their own child. But sometimes it does happen and then it's absolutely alright to be angry." Sherlock said and sighed. "But even though we can't bring them back, we can still try to get to know them. Make some memories, who knows, maybe someone even has videos of them.. don't get your hopes up there, but maybe you could even get to hear their voices." he said and smiled a little at her.
"It does, actually.. sort of at least. You can imagine it like licorize in some combinations it goes with both, sweet and salty, not that it tastes like licorize." Sherlock said and chuckled a little.
–---------------------------------------------                                                                                                                                                                      The next few hours were spent talking a little more and actually wrapping up their study session, though unsurprisingly, they didn't get as much done as they'd planned. Sometime in the early afternoon Scott left again and John and Sherlock were alone in the living room again. "Can't get used to the fact everyone's now calling you William." John said with a chuckle; though, it really only were his ex-boyfriends until now.
"Hm.. so you can stare at whoever actor currently playing James Bond like you stared at the lasagne?" Sherlock asked teasingly and smirked.
"Freak you out in a good or bad way?" Sherlock asked and yawned quietly, though he wasn't nearly as tired as John.
"Do we have to walk all the way up, daddy?" Rosie asked as Sherlock walked around the car to get Charlie's and Rosie's overnight bags out of the boot.
John chuckled at that and got to his feet. "Even though they aren't Watsons, you've definitely got us all three wrapped around your finger." He said and walked up to Sherlock, wrapping his arms around him.
John's throat painfully constricted when he saw Sherlock talking to Victor, so he glanced away until Sherlock addressed him again. "Course, love." John nodded and moved to get his coat and trying to put it on without getting it completely dirty. "See you in a few minutes." He told Charlie, before moving to go to the door.
John chuckled at that and kissed Sherlock back, caressing his cheek with his thumb. "So beautiful" He said in between breaths, glowing with anticipation.
"I was actually talking about our pa.." Sherlock cut off, blushing a bit at not getting the joke right away, "Right.." he mumbled against John's lips, starting to pull John's pants down his hips.
"Good point, ten then. Do want to tell her to stop growing or shall I?" John, before chuckling into Sherlock's shoulder.
Sherlock smiled, "God it's so strange to think that all of that was real, though.. I wasn't sure before, I thought that maybe it was all just a massive coincidence, something.. I don't know what, but certainly not time travel, but Victor did mention you by name in his letter..." he said and rested his forehead against John's.
"You know, you could at least try it on, before pretending you're not sure." Sherlock said and laughed, handing the dress back to Charlie.
"No, I'm not." John said, forcing himself to stay calm (at least one thing, he'd become quite good at); if roles were reversed he'd be suspicious too. "No teeth or anything. If you go at me, I'll just bleed to death, like any normal person, if you need proof, but I'd prefer if you just checked my teeth, if you really want to." He offered, still not into the idea of getting stabbed to death, even if he didn't think that that was extremely likely. " But I'm glad Sher- William's got a protective boyfriend like you."
"No, it certainly isn't." David agreed and walked into the living room, noticing that his son actually looked over to them slightly relieved. "Emma dear, could I just talk to you outside a second?" He asked as he walked over to his wife.
"I suppose she'd have held back a little if she hadn't known you're in on our little secret." Sherlock said and shrugged, "Normally she just behaves like you'd expect from a woman her age.. or what she thinks is how a woman her age behaves." he said and rolled on his side again, wrapping his arm around John's middle.
Sherlock chuckled at that, before lifting up both boxes stacked on top of each other, "Do you want to watch the videos alone, or would you rather have John and me around while you do?" he asked, guessing he could probably get Charlie an off day tomorrow so she could look through all the things without stressing about going to bed early, so they, or she on her own could stay up late and watch most of the videos.
"Yeah, that sounds like a good idea. I'm sure she'd love that." John nodded. "Though, we should probably take things slowly, you know? I mean, we've already just arranged to take her into the zoo after being here the second time. Just, you know, if the very next thing we take to Mrs. Hope is having Rosie over for Christmas.. well, people might talk, you know. Maybe let's wait with that a bit, that's all I'm saying."
"Got him off a murder charge two years ago, I proved that he was on the other side of town housebreaking when the murder had happened." Sherlock said and chuckled, "Since then he's been overly thankful. He doesn't let me pay when I'm at his restaurant." he rolled his eyes.
"That sounds amazing. I do hope I'll get the chance to listen to you sometime." Charlie said with a shy smile. "The guitar is one of my favourite instruments."
Two minutes later the girls were back in their coats and shoes and they were all walking downstairs to the car to drop John off at uni first and then go get furniture.
"Me! I want!" Rosie said and smiled, "Can you really hear my heart with that?" she asked inspecting the little metal knob Paul was holding against his arm. "Can I hear it too?"
"Then I don't want an elevator in the living room." Rosie said as she put on her backpack, holding out her hand for one of her family to take it, it was a new rule that she had to hold one of their hands on the street now, daddy and papa had told her yesterday.
When Sherlock walked back into the bedroom to get dressed he still had to think about his dream, that was weird, he just couldn't shake it off like normal dreams, but maybe that was because that dream had been particularly realistic and maybe because it had contained a lot of faces he hadn't seen in a long time. A very long time.
Opening the door for Charlie, Sherlock smiled, "So, do you have any ideas already?" he asked, waiting for her to get into the cab, "For the colours? You know what, while you have my phone, maybe look up wallpapers and floors, if you can decide on a style for that already, I could have that ready for you on Friday already so it's really only the furniture."
"Lovely." Rachel commented with a huff and Mycroft rolled his eyes at Sherlock; as if he seriously wanted to meet the children. "Did you get that or do I need to pin that memo to your forehead?" She asked impatiently, crossing her arms in front of her chest. No wonder he and Rosie got along so well; she ignored everyone and everything too, but at least she wasn't as rude.
"How about an agreement instead of soothing words though." Sherlock said as he got out everything they needed for the pesto, "We both stop beating ourselves up over it and use that energy to work on being a little more attentive? How does that sound?"
"Mini dictator is a better term." Sherlock said and laughed, nipping at his champagne, before looking at his phone again when it vibrated on the table, "Ah, there we go." he said and grinned holding the phone out for Clara to see the photo.
Sherlock smiled against John's skin, "Well, I guess I'll just have to find more creative spots to kiss.." he said and moved his lips down John's neck, tugging the collar of John's jumper a bit to the side to kiss at his shoulder.
"Yes, you've told me about your theory." Violet said with a nod. "I still can't believe neither Dorothy nor I have looked into that more closely." She commented; she'd known those kids herself... "Have you found out anything new?"
Sally came outside with them to the car and looked inside the windows. After giving Violet a wave, she turning back around to walk back into the orphanage. "Have fun, Rosie! See you at half past seven."
"Speaking of that.. we could have dropped by at your place on the way back home to grab some clothes for you.. or grabbed some clothes for you when we knew we dropped by here so I could drink before we went to your parents." Sherlock said and chuckled.
"I'm sure I could get her to go to the cafe in front of your house if I do it right." Viktor suggested after a moment. "If I text you, you should have enough time to come there before she leaves."
"Rather sooner. Maybe we can combine it with their sleepover, you know, we pick them up in the morning, get the beds, put them up in their rooms, then we play and later they can sleep in their new beds." he chuckled, parking the car in front of the house.
"Then make it, Mom, dad, this is my vampire boyfriend." Sherlock suggested and grinned at John, pulling his hand out of his boyfriend's and instead wrapping his arm around him.
"Yeah.. me too." Sherlock said with a sigh, "Anyway, thanks for looking into this though, I appreciate it."
John chuckled a bit at that. "Well, you've definitely learned how to play us right." He said and Charlie smirked a little, though she was still looking at him pleadingly. "Is that a yes?" "Are you absolutely sure you want to change schools?" "Yes, absolutely. And not just because Ron. And I know I can't just change back to my old school." She added quickly, remembering her conversation with Sherlock. John smiled a bit at that. "Care to show me the presentation?" He asked with a smile and Charlie darted off with a grin to get her laptop. They could see how much thought she'd put into all of this. "Back in a sec!"
"You know.. perhaps you could go to the flower shop around the corner while I go upstairs to have lunch? I don't think taking something with me would be a good idea. I mean.. it would be hard to explain why I'm bringing my own drink..." he said and squeezed John's hand, glad that he was so understanding about this.
"Not in a million years." John said with a no-shit expression and stepped closer to it, careful not to touch the thing. "Chemical, rotten organ or a mixture of both?" Damn, that stuff looked worse up close, especially that bit of texture that was left.
"No, he's fine. He wants me to tell you that everything's alright, but that he wants you to stay in your room just to be safe. He'll meet you tomorrow as usual at the shed and will explain everything." John repeated.
"I will." Sherlock said and turned to walk back up the stairs, hoping Mrs Hudson would have time to keep an eye on the girls for a few minutes while he'd go to get their medicine.
Quietly making his way downstairs with John, he gave Viktor a little smile, "Sorry about making you wait that long.. we just thought it would be good to cover up any sound we could make coming downstairs. They'll probably think we've fallen asleep when the film ends and they don't hear anything." he said quietly, shrugging a little.
John grinned at his boyfriend and let go of him with one hand to pull him lightly in the direction of the living room. "Yeah... let's see if it can accommodate the both of us."
"Well I wouldn't call it naive." Sherlock said and frowned a bit, "But.. I'd be lying if I'd say I wouldn't hope he'll change his mind about it at some point."
"I think self defence classes would still be good idea though." John said with a frown. "I mean, the goal of that isn't exactly to learn how to kill an attacker in mortal combat. You know, knowing how to hit and kick without hurting yourself or how to escape someone right is still going to be very useful for them. And even if they were mortal.. I'm pretty sure the girls wouldn't stand much of a chance against me either, so that wouldn't really make a difference anyway."
John woke up some time later to the smell of... eggs and bacon? After opening his eyes, he actually saw a tray with breakfast (it was morning already?) right in front of him and slowly sat up. Now that was a nice surprise.
"Then wear it with pride." John said with a chuckle and came over to kiss his cheek. "I could tell they liked you right from the start It might actually be a good idea for you to work with children."
"Well, I could hardly say no, could I? I'll always come around when you feel like a train wreck; that's how this works." She replied with a smile and sat down next to him on his bed. "Are you taking medicine with your blood?"
"That's true.. You know, I'm not happy about it, but I can't help the looming feeling she's going to end up choosing an illegal profession."
"Probably." John said with a chuckle, before looking up when the front door opened and the girls and Vanessa walked in. "Hello there" Violet said with a smile as she entered. "Happy birthday, darling" She said with a bright smile as she walked towards her son.
"I'm sure Rosie would still be surprised if you asked her to put together a presentation." She offered with a giggle, before pulling out a USB stick out of her pocket and handing it Sherlock.
"Erm, yeah. That's mine." Charlie said and swallowed as she read how she'd come here and who her parents had been... They'd told her the gist when she'd asked of course, but they hadn't told her much of.. this. Apparently an attacker had broken into their home when she had been two. She'd been sent straight here after a hospital stay because of some superficial wounds.
"Well that's because I know what it's like.." Sherlock said and shrugged, "I can see the same thing I saw in Rosie, in you too. You're way smarter than your age suggests. Basically my whole family was like that. My mother, my sister back then, she died very young, though, but my brother and even my twin baby sisters are incredibly smart, we were lucky with my mother. She could relate, but most people can't. With Rosie, obviously we have to limit what she learns a little, since she's still young, but I'm pretty sure you have a good idea what you can handle and what not. So if at some point investigating this becomes too much for you, I expect you tell me. That's my only condition to let you help me here."
"No.. but you might want to make sure you don't label all boys hormone driven monsters and actually scare her." Sherlock said and chuckled, "Although.. I think every man with a daughter thinks that way about teenage boys and especially teenage boys interested in their daughter." he said and smirked.
Sherlock smiled, watching John as he took a bite himself, "Glad you like it." he said and chuckled, "Don't elope though." he said, taking another bite.
"Whoa, that's huge." Charlie said and gaped a bit. "You must be able to look over the whole district up there." She said and unbuckled her seatbelt. "Wake up, Rosie, where there."
"Probably better not tell him that I play the violin and have done ballet then..." Sherlock said and chuckled, "Good think I can still adjust to the sir routine pretty well.." he said with a smile, "Military left over.. too bad I can't actually tell him about my military careers... I /could/ tell him I've been in a military school when I was younger, though.
Violet chuckled and got out a small bag from the inside of her blazer. "Paul and Amber like it too, so from time to time I'll make a good stack of teabags for the few times the house falls ill." She chuckled and put it on her lap. "I thought I might bring a couple."
"It really doesn't." Sherlock said and smiled at her, "To be quite honest, I feel rather at home in our time, actually." he said and turned around as the door opened and Jane walked in on her own, "Sherlock, it's been so long." she said, closing the door and chuckling a little, "I expect you've been occupied with Victor? I'm so glad I introduced you, but I feel offended you forget me over that." she said and smiled at the girl with him, "Oh and who are you, my dear." she said and gave Sherlock a worried look, "Don't tell me she's your fia.." she began and Sherlock shook his head, cutting her off, "Good god, no." he said and shook his head. "Sherlock! Show some manners, you don't have to make it that clear. Don't be offended, my dear." she said, turning from Sherlock to Charlie, "He doesn't mean it that way, he's just never been good with words." she said and chuckled a little.
"Well, no. My mum was human when she was still with my dad." Sherlock said and smiled a little, "She had faked her death after she was turned, she didn't know my brother and I had been turned as well, after all and she thought it was the best she could do. I didn't know she was still alive until about two weeks ago. Just like I didn't know that my cousin Clara was still alive, she's married to John's sister." he said with a laugh.”
"They are." John said with a chuckle as he poured two more glasses for the girls. "And we're still taking all of Charlie's friends shopping, don't forget that."
"Course. I have to greet the girls, don't I? And you two have been pondering the universe, yeah?" John joked with a smile, before glancing over to the couch where Rosie was lying; what a sweetheart. "And hey Charlie. Welcome home. Everything alright?" John asked and walked over to Charlie, who in turn jumped to her feet. "Sure. Just pondering the universe, you know." She replied purposely nonchalantly to hide how nervous she was in actuality. Though, she did lean happily into the warm hug he was offering and closed her eyes for a moment. Well, she already knew she liked that part about him. John chuckled at that and drew back after a few seconds. "Good, I'm glad you're not bored here. Has Sherlock already offered you something to eat or drink?" He asked and set down his bag, figuring that if the two had been too excited to sleep they probably hadn't had breakfast of their own accord either. (Just like Sherlock.)
A few minutes Sally returned and put on her polite smile for Rosie again. "Seems like everything's right. She needs to be back at supper time, that's at half past seven. Violet is accompanying you?"
"But not if you'd gotten us children?" Sherlock asked and laughed, "Maybe.. if you do that.. mention the children part in the text." he chuckled, nipping on his glass, before put a pot with water on the stove for the noodles.
John chuckled and smirked back at him. "Yeah, you did. Makes you great boyfriend material if I dare say." He said and brushed a strand of hair from Sherlock's forehead.
"What kind of bee is it? Not the bad ones, right? Because I don't like the bad ones, like hornets they aren't good for anything, they only sting!" Rosie said and scrunched up her nose as Sherlock helped her with the sting. "No hornets, those bees are very friendly, don't worry." he said and smiled to himself.
That 'ew' made John laugh. Of all people Sherlock was one of the last people he'd have expected that opinion from. "Really? It's actually not that bad, the taste I mean."
"Yeah, sure thing." Charlie said and gave her a smile. "Do you write your 3's and E's facing the same way then?" She asked her as they began to walk outside.
Janine chuckled to herself at that and Clara said "Well, had a thing with Virginia Wolf once." She said with a chuckle. "Terribly posh thing. But Janine looks as if she's got a whole journal full of names." Janine shook her head. "Not quite a whole journal, but you might've heard of Franz Beckenbauer or Martin Heidegger, the philosopher.. I met him in Freiburg." She said with a smile. "And what about granddad?"
Walking downstairs, Sherlock quickly made his way over to the door, making a mental note to put a peephole into the door, so they could check who was standing behind it, before opening it. Unlocking it, he chuckled a little, "Oh.. hi Lowell." he said, quite relieved that it wasn't a murderer and/or kidnapper. "What are you doing here?" he asked, stepping aside to let his.. sort of brother in law in, "Well, I was just wondering if I could borrow a couple of blood bags from you? Just to tide me over a bit of a shortage? I mean you did offer so.." Lowell said with his trademark smirk as he walked into the house. "No, sure that's fine, although I should probably stock up my supplies in future." he said with a laugh, "My consumption has risen a little." he said as they walked up the stairs together.
"Is his brother that awful or what's going on?" Janine asked with a frown and Clara shook her head. "Just imagine the most unsocial person with seemingly no emotional nor social life. That's Mycroft."
"Yeah, that's true." John smiled back at him, before shaking his head a little. "You know, looking at you I get why people compare us to Disney films."
"Yeah, sure." She smiled and went over to him. She still wasn't sure if she found Sherlock's alertness rather reassuring or unsettling; though, those people were out there either way if she was reminded of them or not, so his ignoring them would only do harm. Looking at it like that, she decided she should go with the former. "What are we making? Sandwiches half-half?"
"No, it would." Sherlock said and smiled, "Which is why I'm terribly glad I've snatched you off the market when I still had the chance." he said and leant in to peck John's lips. "And one way or another we'll get those beautiful babies too." he said and sat up again, "Speaking of babies, though.. I was actually thinking we could drop by that orphanage tomorrow when I get back from uni.. I'd like to see it for myself, even though the idea of a whole bunch of toddlers and kids all drinking tomato juice is incredibly creepy."
"You mean over my father's personality?" John asked and shook his head slightly with a huff. "Sorry, it's just strange. But no, she said she doesn't. After having to come to terms with us and Richard he's become nicer again, she says."
"Mmh, okay true." Charlie said with a chuckle. "Still, if I ever have the chance again, I'll read it properly and not just the part about my parents. That's one of the very few downsides of not living there anymore. Those break-in and -outs would be much more difficult now from across the city." She said with a chuckle.
Harry looked for a moment longer at her wife and her brother's fiancé, before turning to look at John, "Uh.. no.." she said and her frown turned into a small smile, "But.. dad phoned me..." she said and chuckled a little, "They invited /us/ over for next week. And he didn't once tell me what a disappointment I am." she said with a shrug. "That's a start."
John watched them and kept his hands deliberately relaxed. He had no idea whether they were referencing something John didn't know or if they were flirting. What he did know was that he didn't like the way this guy was smiling at his boyfriend. (Nor the way Sherlock was smiling back.) So that's what he'd left his dinner for?
"Oh.. yeah I can see how that would be a problem. Though.. for what it's worth, I have more respect for people thinking for themselves than those that are blindly following orders." Sherlock said and gave Viktor a smile.
"Oh no, she's cool with that, I know that for a fact." John said with a chuckle. "I think it's safe to say she's the most progressive person in the family in terms if relationships." He said with a bit of a snort. "Seriously though, you'll like her."
"Right, I mean, it's not like I've never tasted blood before, but I'm not sure I'll be fine with kisses like that." John said; at least this wouldn't be some stranger's blood, though the thought wasn't really thrilling.
"I'll text you once I'm done talking to him." John said with a smile and ran a hand through his curls. "I'd better find that gym then. See you, love."
"Never a full one though.." Sherlock said and shrugged, "It's always only the years between 16 and 30 and that over and over again and on your own .. sometimes it's annoying, really badly annoying." he said and sighed, shuffling a little closer to John and resting his head on a cushion as he laid back on the sofa, "Though I think now with a family.. it's bound to get much more exciting."
Sherlock had to bite his lip very hard to not start laughing, he didn't really want to risk their fragile relationship just yet - perhaps he could start laughing at David's cooking skills in a year or so.
Sherlock smiled and nodded, "Yeah.. they are.." he said and reached for John's hand, taking his hands and the cloth away from from his eyes, "Guess it's really quite useful for me to have a doctor around." he said and chuckled softly, once again feeling the urge to kiss him. There was a real possibility John might cause him to develop an eating disorder.                     (
"Don't think so." Sherlock said quietly in reply to John's previous question, not wanting to wake up Rosie who had dozed off on the sofa, using her book as a pillow, before he turned to look at Charlie. "Why did he leave so soon?" he asked, he had actually thought they would have to eventually drag him out of their house.
Sherlock frowned as he looked around, his cold feet and the way people stared at him kind of tipped him off that maybe he wasn't dreaming after all. "Oh.. oh my god, I'm sorry.." he said and sighed, blushing as he ran a hand through his hair. "It was just .. it was almost exactly like my dream started... the exact same situation.. and even nearly the same dialogue... I just thought.. I thought I was dreaming again."
"He is the British government. When he's not too busy being the British Secret Service or the CIA on a freelance basis." Sherlock said with roll of his eyes, "However, I suppose.. I would be.. quite.. erm.. grateful.. if you could use your connections on that matter." he said and sounded like he was coughing up a hairball, which was his usual tone when he was reluctantly thanking Mycroft.
"Oh, yeah, you're right." Dennis said after some typing. "Looks like there have been only like 5 adoptions in the past 30 years.. And not a single one in the last two years." He said with a frown as he began to gather the documents. "Hm, must be some brats living there." He joked.
"Glad you're enjoying it." Sherlock said as he sat down next to her in the car, quickly leaning forward to tell the cabbie his address, before he leant back again, fixing his seatbelt.
"Well every child /is/ different." Sherlock murmured with a roll of his eyes, "Anyway, let's go and show Amy and Ally the bees." he said with a smile and looked at Rosie, "You want to lead them to it?" he asked and Rosie nodded, "Yeah, okay!" she said and took Amy's and Ally's hands again, "It's this way!" she said, starting to lead them through the hall.
"I mourned you. I used to look visit your grave and talk to you, tell you about my problems." David replied tensely. "Yes, you had reasons, but at the bottom line you ignored me when I needed you. Who is to say how I might've turned out that way? You never asked me for my opinion. You didn't even intend to come back."
Sherlock smiled at that, "A night without interruptions and without being so exhausted from the day that we fall asleep instantly... that does sound really, really good." he said with a smirk. "How about Friday? Having them spontaneously stay somewhere else increases their safety too."
"Of course I want to be your friend." Charlie said with a warm smile and wrapped an arm around the younger girl. She really knew what Rosie was struggling with; if she hadn't started trying to do what the other kids her age liked (as dull as it was sometimes), she'd likely still have no social life. "And I know it can be hard to play with others if all they want to play is mother, father and child, right?"
"Sure, I'll get your luggage then." Sherlock said and gave her a smile, before looking at Rosie, who head her head rested against his shoulder. "What about you then? You've got someone else to say goodbye to?" he asked and Rosie shook her head, "No." she said and shrugged a little, "All my friends will be around me when we're there."
"Cool!" Rosie chirped and walked to the cafeteria with her, where Sherlock was sitting with a glass of blood, smiling as he spotted the pair, having asked Greg if he could skip the first period so he could talk to Charlie. "Ah, there you are." he said, standing up to greet Rosie with hug and with a bit of hesitation (after all he wasn't sure if Charlie would be weirded out) he gave Charlie a small hug too.
Charlie smiled at that, glad she'd contributed something to finding Rosie. After a moment she turned back to Jane about what she'd said first. "So you think I'll actually get to meet some boys?" She asked her with a bit of a grin. "Back at home, I literally only know one boy my age and a handful that are a bit younger or older." She said with a sigh. "But, you know, Sherlock's actually already showed me a few old regency ballroom dances, so I already know that." She said, before wondering if they were already calling their time period that.
"Nope, the degradation products are toxic and I'm pretty sure the stuff itself is carcinogenic." John said, remembering that from a book about the history of medicine.
"Ha, you wish" She spat as she was being dragged into the flat of the old landlady. What she didn't expect to see there, however, was the homeless mortal she'd paid, who was now standing in the living room. ...He'd told them. They'd/tricked/ her?! "You dirty mortal" she roared in his direction. "you lot are only good for food, aren't you?"
"Me too!" Rosie said while Sherlock smiled down at his girls, before opening the car door and setting Rosie down on the floor so she could get inside, trusting that Charlie would help her with her car seat as they usually did as he walked around the car to get in as well.
"Well, going by your logic society makes laws. Hence you wouldn't be wrong to blame it for your former situation, correct?" Charlie said quietly after a moment, steepling her fingers under her chin. "May I ask what you think about society as a whole?"
Sherlock frowned at the house, "Well.. this isn't quite what I expected," he said as he looked the building over, chuckling lightly as he spotted a blonde little head mostly covered by a pair of binoculars, looking right at the two of them - but disappearing almost the very same moment Sherlock had spotted them.
