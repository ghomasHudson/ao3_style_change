Joanna shakes her head. “No, I—” She coughs, covering her mouth with the towel. Her throat is raw. “There’s something I need to do, and to do it properly I need your help. Your blessing, at least.” Her leg is steady beneath her, and she walks back to the table. She sits. “I know a way to protect us from Moriarty, but when I tell you what it is, you’re going to think I’ve gone mad.” She glances at the ceiling. “Well. Madder.”
Mycroft looks back and forth between them like a spectator at an unexpectedly violent tennis match. “Ladies, if I may interject—”
Adrienne holds out her hand, empty and palm up. “I’ll give it back if you can’t manage,” she says. Her lips quirk in a small, taunting smile. “Think of it as an experiment.”
Mrs. Hudson gives her a knowing look. “Gets a bit private, does it?” Her eyes widen. “Ooh, do you dance about with your clothes off? I saw that on telly once – though that was probably a different sort of magic, now that I think of it.”
,” the assistant says through her teeth. Her face is flushed, her breath fast. Her Blackberry lies abandoned in her lap, but her eyes are still fixed on the empty air just over her clenched hands. “We really should be going.”
Lake water surges up through the bed sheets, murky and ice cold and stinking of algae and rot. It rolls over her in a crash of yellow foam, flooding the bed and sucking her down into the mattress. Water fills her mouth and nose and she chokes on it, her lungs burning. Sherlock is standing and shouting, but she can’t hear him through the rush of the water and the wave; the lake spills onto the bedroom floor, coursing under his feet, and he lands hard in the mud. He doesn’t let go of her hand.
sorry – I didn’t realise you were so delicate. Shall I call for a doctor, or would you prefer to lick your imaginary wounds in private?”
Joanna takes a deep breath, and the spine of the recipe book presses hard against her side. “Whatever you want to call it,” she says, “it isn’t part of my life anymore. Sherlock doesn’t need to know.”
Joanna feels it like an ache at first, a strange pressure building behind her eyes and her teeth. It spreads along her skin, a prickling flush of adrenaline and heat and
she asks, summoning the sensation of falling. Of landing, broken. After a long moment, the oak replies.
She tells them over dinner. Harry comes up from her flat in Westminster, steps through the front door in a cloud of cigarette smoke and subtle perfume and gives her sister a false, jarring smile. “Hello, darling,” she says, because she calls everyone
But the woman Agamede was not content. Before he had given her his final gift, Death had torn a single page from the book of secrets – the only page the woman truly wanted. She had at her fingertips the hidden, final fate of every man, woman, and child she met, but without that page she could not know her own. Death had deceived her, and for all her skill and secret knowledge the woman was as mortal as she had always been.
,” he says from the second level balcony, arm deep in one of the dark wood bookshelves. “None of these are
sound like a mild but potentially embarrassing disease. He closes the compact mirror with a snap, and as he does Joanna catches a glimpse of his reflection, long face and dark hair haloed by the light overhead.
There is, of course, a perfectly reasonable explanation for this. If her head would stop pounding, she’d probably be able to remember what it was.
Violet Holmes died twenty years ago, but Morland Park remembers her still. It remembers her like this: breathing slow, shallow breaths in a bed built for the dying, her eyes closed as she listens to her son play his violin.
An expression of genuine amusement flickers across his face. “Yes, of course. I was only speaking of family in the figurative sense. I’m sure Sherlock thinks of you as the sister we never had.” The corner of his mouth twitches. “Your feelings, I assume, are equally sororal.”
The assistant shakes her head and smiles, a Mona Lisa in black Manolo Blahniks. “My name isn’t Anthea,” she says, and leaves.
When daylight filled the cottage, the girl went to the window and saw Death standing again at the door. She held out a hand and offered him the pomegranate. He did not take it. “The hermit’s fever has broken,” the girl said. “He has no need of you now.”
“Oh, very funny,” Joanna says. She climbs into the car and takes the seat opposite, slamming the door behind her. “A forgetting spell, then. How many times did it take before I realised?”
Moriarty shrugs. “Carl sank like an innocent. But then, I did help him along in that, didn’t I?” He leans forward, Seostris’ book open in his hands. “Do you believe in fate, Doctor Watson?”
“No. Helene kept her ancestry a secret, even from me.” Moran tilts his head slightly to one side, curious. “And you, Joanna? What do you see in Agamede’s mirror?”
“I’ll see if she’s taking requests,” Joanna says, and returns to her bedroom. A moment later, she hears him descend the last of the stairs.
Night fell again, and the man’s image returned to the surface of the pool. Agamede spoke to him, told him of her travels, of the places she had seen and the deaths she had undone, but if the man heard her, he did not reply. The sun rose and set and rose again, and for ten nights and days she slept and watched and wept at the water’s edge, offering the man her secrets and her skill, her blood and her breath. He wanted none of it, and as one night passed to the next her love slowly turned away from her, his pale face fading into the dark.
She tears off what’s left of her paper jumpsuit and lets him boost her up, his hands cupped to support her foot. She swings one leg over the wall and sits unsteadily on the top, bricks grinding first under her weight and then under his as he jumps, pulling himself up and over. The wall trembles beneath them for a perilous moment before they land together in the garden on the other side, blinking in sudden blinding daylight.
“You’ve been avoiding me for weeks, Jo – you’ve left me no choice. I’m kidnapping you and feeding you at least one meal that isn’t served freeze-dried in a packet.” She drops her mobile into the handbag over her shoulder and snakes her arm through Joanna’s, leaning close to take some of her weight. “Come on. It isn’t far.”
Murray rolls her onto her back, and her vision goes white with pain. “You fucking idiot,” he gasps, terrified. “Bloody Saint Jo and her glorious
“The same way I know everything. I pay attention.” He climbs over her legs and settles on the other side of the bed with a huff. “Your reactions to stress are entirely predictable, and yet you spent last night alone in the flat drowning yourself in a bottle of cheap gin. There must be something, some piece of information I’ve missed.” He slumps back against the headboard and scrubs his fingers through his hair. “What am I not seeing?”
“It’s probably a mummy or shrunken head or something else dead and cursed and morbid. I bet Gran doesn’t even remember she left it up here.” Harry turns back to the stairs, but she stops just before she reaches the first step. She looks back over her shoulder, frowning. “That mirror—”
“Step back,” he says, and when she does he slides off the bed and kneels at her feet. His hair brushes her thigh, and she can’t stop the gasp that hisses through her teeth. “More sensitive here,” he says, and she nearly stutters a denial before she feels him gently probing the bruised skin around her right ankle. “You must have injured one of his flunkies, if they felt the need to bind your feet as well as your hands.”
She cleans every window in every room and oils the hinges of every door. The house grows unfamiliar under her hands, a stranger in the sunlight. She comes to miss the taste of dust.
She releases him abruptly; he takes a stumbling step back, his lips still slightly parted. He breathes deep and watches her chest rise in time with his. “Joanna—”
“She is. Probably cleverer too, in her way.” Gran tips back her head, looking up into the blue depth of the sky. “But it would be a wasted effort. Your sister, Joanna, lives in the world as it is.”
“Stop it,” Joanna says. “I’m blushing.” Her grandmother’s blankets lie discarded on the floor. Joanna gathers them up and covers her again, tucking the edges in close around her. Gran lies still, unresisting, and Joanna can’t quite stop herself from finding the pulse at her wrist, or watching the shallow rise of each breath as she sleeps.
It is the first thing she sees when she wakes again. Its limbs are black in the moonlight; a gust of wind and the dead branches click like fingers against the glass. The window is tall and narrow, the moulded-wood frame painted white. It matches the rest of the little bedroom, with its pale wallpaper and delicately pretty white wood furniture – the ivory-inlaid armoire in the corner, the little night table cluttered with empty china teacups. The armchair beside the bed, where Harry sits with her hands folded tightly in her lap.
He smiles then, thin and false and cut with cold condescension. “But it was never really a risk, was it? The mirror’s already shown you how you’re going to die.”
Martha Anne Hudson sits on the staircase, holding tight to the banister and half in tears. Joanna sees her face through blind eyes and hears her voice with deaf ears, hears her gasp, “Oh, oh
“Oh god,” Joanna says. “Can we skip this stretch of memory lane, please? I still haven’t recovered from Harry’s birds and the bees speech; I don’t know if my sex drive can withstand further trauma.”
When she turns back, her grandmother is taking her worn leather sewing kit from her cardigan pocket. She opens it and holds up a long silver sewing needle, pinched between her thumb and forefinger. “Best do it now,” she says. “Give things time to settle before we plant.”
She could have started the fire herself, if she’d realised. Could have taken Moriarty with her and left Sherlock unharmed. Safe.
“I would have told you,” she says, her voice too loud in the small, too-warm space between them. She feels her face heat, but she doesn’t look away. “I would have told you, if you’d asked.”
She raises a wet hand and flicks water at him, laughing when he recoils from the spray like a startled cat. Some things, she thinks, will just never get old. She shuts off the tap and dries her hands on the cleanest tea towel. “Pass me that recipe book, would you? The one with the cardboard cover.”
, she thinks, and some small part of what she feels must show in her face, because he grabs hard for her arm, his eyes wide.
“Thirty minutes out,” the man says. It’s hard to see in the dark, but his right hand is tucked close against his body; he must be the one who grabbed for her first. Idiot.
Three more leaves shoot from the splinters in her arm, filmy and green and curling down to the black puddle of blood spreading slowly across the table.
“That’s sort of what I’m counting on.” She leans forward, resting her elbows on her knees, and takes a deep breath. “Mrs. Hudson, I want to cast a spell on 221.”
Joanna grins. “That I won’t forget,” she says, and slaps her bloody palm into the long list of names carved on the underside of the table.
“Of course.” His head reemerges, his hair wild, and he rubs the towel over his chest and arms. He smirks at her. “But I did catch the thief.”
“I never much liked that version,” Adrienne says, her even voice echoing in the metal-walled silence. “Never liked the ending.”
“A bug,” Joanna says, resting her hands on the back of one of the visitor’s chairs. “It was recording everything we said in the flat and bottling our voices in that glass.”
“Sherlock,” Joanna says. “When I looked in the mirror, I saw Sherlock Holmes.” Then she covers her face with her hands and
Joanna first sees him on a Tuesday, just after she arrives home from school. The house is empty, hollowed out by the silence; her sister is at a friend’s, her gran out doing the shopping. The afternoon rain is loud against the windows and roof.
There is a sound like wind or waves, like the scrape of the dead birch tree’s black fingers against the window glass. Harry looks around at the unfamiliar little room, at the pale wallpaper and the white wood furniture. The empty night table beside the bed.
“Don’t answer,” Gran says from her armchair. She’s sitting beside the second floor sitting room fireplace, swaddled in blankets and shivering with a marrow-deep cold Joanna cannot feel. “He’s only here to sell you some rubbish thing we don’t need.”
The house towers above them, dust-filmed windows glinting in the sunlight. It had frightened Joanna, when she was small – the size and the silence of it. The way it made her father frown and her mother’s eyes go distant and sad. Before the accident her visits to the house had been rare, and brief.
She looked down at the pool, the book of secrets cold in her hands. “If he has left me,” she said, “I shall have no fear of death.” She watched as the book sank seamlessly beneath the water, and then she turned.
There is nothing wrong with Joanna’s leg – nothing at all, aside from the fact that whenever she tries to walk, it won’t bloody
“Yes,” Joanna says, tapping the end of her pencil against a squiggly blur that might be Scorpio. “I read it in one of your books.”
going to end.” She shakes her head, drying her eyes with the edge of her sleeve. “Oh, what a relief. I thought for sure all this was going to mean something awful once I sorted it out.”
– it matters. A lot more than you’d think.” She swallows and ignores the ache. “It might save Sherlock’s life, Mrs. Hudson. It might save yours. I wouldn’t lie about that.”
, which includes a helpful list of concoctions that require toad’s eyes, toad’s bones, or toad’s heart should that recipe prove less effective than the first.
One morning Harry finds her asleep on the attic floor, curled inside the sleeping bag and shuddering with cold.
On the thirteenth night the witch woman Agamede stood at the pool’s edge and waited for her love to appear in the water. Hours passed, and the surface was as dark as the moonless sky above.
“Not going to happen,” Joanna says, and though she’s smiling, there’s nothing friendly in it. “Not tonight, and not tomorrow night. Probably not the night after that, either, but that depends more on the state of Sherlock’s latest toxic mould experiment than on anything you might say.” She takes the book from Adrienne’s hand and drops it neatly into an open box. “I’d like to go home now. Are you driving me, or do I need to phone for a cab?”
“Almost always, yes.” Mycroft looks down, smoothing his already perfect tie. “Mrs Hudson has asked me to speak with you. Again.”
Joanna lets her cry for a bit, wondering if Sherlock can hear them downstairs. He’s been without a case for nearly two weeks, and has spent the last few days obsessively reading the classified section of every newspaper he can find, muttering about secondhand hoovers and a lost parrot. When she’d asked what he was looking for, he’d simply said, “Fan mail,” and grabbed for the next paper in the pile.
“Light pollution,” Gran calls from the kitchen, raising her voice so Joanna can hear her outside on the garden steps. “You’re wasting your time.”
They search without speaking for more than half an hour, each trying to pretend they hadn’t heard the other humming
I know it's been a long, long time since I last posted, and I wanted to thank everyone who has read and commented and kudosed over the years. I really love this story, and it means so much to me that others care about it too.
His grip is strong, but she could pull free if she wanted to. Instead, she leans into his side. Their shoulders touch, lightly. “I did. It would have been better if you’d told me yourself, but I didn’t think you’d want to be disturbed.” She flexes the tendons of her wrist, and they move in his grasp. “How do you know what clothes I was wearing? You were gone when I woke up.”
Moriarty and his snipers are gone, and the only sign of the explosion is a long tower of flame rising behind them, a fire stretching from the ashes of the vest to the high ceiling above. There isn’t even much smoke, now – just the single fire, burning impossibly bright. “Definitely not Semtex, then,” Sherlock says, and the madman’s about to step closer to the flame when Joanna jerks him back with one hand on his arm. He scowls. “I only want to see what sort of accelerant he’s used. It would have to be fairly unusual to sustain such a controlled burn.”
“Yes, sir,” the assistant says, but her voice is still strained. “I don’t believe she knows she’s doing it.”
Mrs Barrow smiles at him, her eyes misty. “You are, aren’t you? You might even look a bit like him, if only you weren’t so tall.” She shakes her head, tears spilling over onto her cheeks. “Oh, it’s such a pity. Such a terrible waste. You’ve both been so kind, and I’ve gone and ruined it all.”
Sherlock bends until his face hovers over the corpse’s, his expression equally serene. “You think she was murdered, then.”
The room is high-ceilinged and half-lit, echoing with her footsteps and the last bell tone reverberations of Sherlock’s voice. He stands at the water’s edge, looking away, and in the moment before he turns to face her she sees his reflection.
Three stitches of white jumper wool beside black thread and suddenly Mrs. Hudson is gone. Instead she sees herself – sees Joanna Helene Watson standing in the doorway, fair and bright-eyed and burning, sees her face and hears her gasp of breath as the house shifts beneath her naked feet.
Harry is curled on her side in the bed, hidden by blankets and facing the wall. The water glass lies empty on the floor. Joanna picks it up and sets it carefully on the bedside table. She sits on the bed, her back against the headboard. “You ready to sleep?”
He drops into a crouch beside her. It must have started to rain; his hair is damp, and he smells like wet earth. There’s a smudge of dirt on his chin. “You’re not serious.”
“Then yes,” he says, “she probably hates you.” She feels him shift beside her on the bed, and a moment later he presses a cup of cool water into her hands. “A half bottle of gin and you’re sicking up into your landlady’s sink. So much for that famed Watson tolerance.”
She must look ghastly – Thompson’s gaze flicks down to the notepad in her lap. “You haven’t answered my question.”
Joanna can’t help it; she drops her head back against the kitchen counter and starts to laugh. After a moment Gran joins in, the sound low and hoarse and rare.
She tries to be subtle, but there’s no doubt that he’s noticed; his wardrobe disappears item by item, shoe by trouser by suit jacket by shirt, and then reappears ever-so-slightly altered – new stitching in the lining of the collar, a whiff of fresh glue at the heel. Details he couldn’t possibly have missed, and yet he hasn’t said a word.
“James Moriarty,” she says, and there is the echo of another voice beneath her own. “Sebastian Moran.”
“I’m sure you will,” Sherlock says, and whirls off towards the front door of 221. Joanna steps out onto the pavement and closes the door firmly behind her. The car drives away.
“Moran,” Sherlock says, breathing the name like a revelation, and for a strange, unsettled moment Joanna cannot place it. Can recall the name, but not the meaning behind it.
,” Joanna says, sure of her answer but stumbling a little over the pronunciation. “Queen of the Meadow, or Bridewort. Used to treat stomachaches, diarrhoea, and the pains of first love’s heartbreak.”
When the car slows to a stop outside the flat, Adrienne breaks the silence. “Moran will try to get access to the house. He’ll have guessed Helene hid the mirror there.”
“I wouldn’t worry,” Joanna says. “I’m not his type. If he has a type.” She slides down until she and Harry lie side-by-side, shoulder-to-shoulder. For a moment they stare in silence at the ceiling, at the elephant-shaped water stain above their heads and the motes of dust floating in the lamplight. “Did you ask Clara to take you back?”
Joanna circles the glyph with her pencil. Definitely Ceres – the hooky bit on the top is all wrong for Jupiter. “People have looked to the stars for guidance throughout human history, Gran. I’m just trying to follow in their footsteps.”
,” Joanna says in her very best Mrs. Hudson. “Nor, for that matter, am I your wife, mother, or personal chef.”
“Not the first time she’s been forced to deal with the intoxicated ramblings of a naked tenant, and almost certainly not the last. At least you didn’t vomit.”
“You have got to be fucking kidding me,” Harry says. She grabs the axe out of Sherlock’s hands and strides back up to the base of the oak. She leans hard against the trunk with one hand, her palm grinding into the bark. “Jo, is that you?”
She returns to the flat the next afternoon to find Mycroft Holmes sitting on the sofa, wearing a pair of latex gloves and flipping casually through her grandmother’s recipe book.
Sherlock’s needle is the third, the last, and when she sews the first blue stitch in the skin of her palm Baker Street disappears. She sees Sherlock Vernet Holmes crouched beneath a bridge in a rain-soaked circle of huddled strangers, his familiar features disguised. She sees his face and hears his hiss of breath as he startles, miles away through the city and the dark. His lips form the silent shape of her name.
The answer comes in nothing like words, but she understands it nonetheless: She does not belong. Those who belong have the key. Strangers do not have the key, and strangers do not come inside.
The assistant ignores her, attention fixed on her mobile again. Joanna climbs into the car and sits beside Sherlock, her wet clothes squeaking against the leather seats. Alice takes the seat opposite and closes the door hard behind her.
The door opens, and a man in dark fatigues and a black facemask ducks his head inside. “We have arrived at the set location, sir,” he says in crisp, slightly accented English. “Everything is in place.”
He finds a stubborn knot at the nape of her neck and her scalp sings with pain, a symphony among the stinging roots. It makes her muscles go loose and her mind go quiet, and when she opens her eyes she sees the thistle and the ivy withering at her feet.
His fingers still. After a moment’s pause they continue, weaving the plait down her back. “The thought had occurred. I only have so many attachments to exploit; as my flatmate and colleague, you are the obvious choice.” He finishes the plait with quick, economical twists of his forearms and wrists and ties it off with the snap of an elastic. “No sane person would risk her life for a convenient flatshare.”
Dust cloths still cover most of the library shelves, protecting their contents from sunlight and the passage of time. Sherlock tears the cloth from the next bookshelf, lets it spill over the balcony and onto the floor below. It falls slowly, flowing through the air before it lands in grey ripples at Joanna’s feet.
Her bark. His blood seeps through the surface and into her veins, flows through her branches and rises bitter at the back of her throat, a sour humming magic that fills her mouth and grinds like metal against her teeth. She chokes on it, unable to breathe.
“He took you not far from the flat,” he says. His voice is cool, detached; it sounds strange through the rush of her pulse in her ears. “No farther than three streets away, because you consider that home territory and he wanted to make it clear that he can take you anytime, from anywhere he likes.” He pauses, and she feels a familiar tug at her temples as he begins to plait her hair. “Am I right?”
Mycroft tips his head slightly to one side, studying her with the barest hint of genuine amusement in his cool eyes. “Your grandmother’s name was Helene Elisabeth Russell, and she was a witch. As are you, Doctor Watson, despite the lengths you’ve gone to deny it.” He turns to his assistant. “
“Not the point, Sherlock.” She can’t look at him now without seeing the boy she knew, his too-long, too-young face and the winter afternoons spent in alone her grandmother’s attic, surrounded by schoolbooks and empty bags of crisps and his cluttered desk, just on the other side of the glass.
Joanna sinks back down to sit on the streamer trunk. The anger is gone, but the clarity stays – the clarity and the terrible, steady-handed calm. “A mirror that shows you your own death. My grandmother’s mirror.”
she thinks, and remembers the ashes of the vest, swallowed by flame. “He was playing with us. He never intended for me to burn.”
The cane shudders, like it wants to bore through the wall and follow Mycroft out into the street. Joanna swallows. “I didn’t do that.”
The woman walked past him, through the trees and close to the water’s edge. “I was tired of being afraid.”
“She died when I was eighteen.” Thompson’s never worn the bracelet before, not during one of their sessions, but it isn’t new. An heirloom maybe, or rediscovered favourite – Sherlock would know which, and a thousand other things besides. “I don’t remember much about my childhood.”
Her shadow still stands against the kitchen door, the sewing needle buried in its chest. The fire cannot harm it; the brighter a fire burns, the darker the shadows become.
“Oh, it’s no trouble,” the woman says as she bustles into the corridor. She wipes her hands on a tea towel, her small silver spectacles fogged with heat. “The biscuits are still in the oven, is all. I’d hoped they’d be ready by the time you arrived.” She tucks the towel under her arm and holds out a tiny, wrinkled hand out for Sherlock to shake. “And you must be her Mr Holmes. Lovely to meet you. Just lovely. Come in, come in. So sorry about the mess – it’s always like this when I’m baking, I’m afraid.”
Joanna rests her chin on her hand and nods. “Except for CPR,” she says. “And sometimes defibrillators.”
He wheezes a laugh and then his hands are on her back, his face hot against her cheek and the shell of her ear –
Joanna shudders and the oak shudders with her, still growing as its limbs lengthen and branch and bloom, straining against the walls and ceiling. Seeking sunlight in the verdant dark.
Sherlock is speechless, frozen in place. The fire lunges for the cane in his hands, its burning fingers grasping for the handle.
His eyes follow her as she leaves the room, and for a moment her chest aches as it had beneath the water, too full and painfully tight. She stops in the corridor, breathless.
Joanna winces, and the towel twists in her hands. “I know. I wouldn’t have said anything, but the house is yours and that kind of thing,
They’re closer now to her grandmother’s house than to Baker Street. Closer than she’s been in years.
She elbows him gently away from the sink and turns on the tap. “I’m making soup and sandwiches for dinner. You eating today?”
“I’ll text,” he says, and leaves her standing alone in her bedroom, her hair still damp in its single, perfect plait.
The next day her sister is waiting for her when she leaves the physiotherapist’s office. Harry’s eyes are hidden behind sunglasses, despite the winter clouds overhead; she has a large Burberry shopping bag in one hand and her mobile phone in the other. “I’m buying you lunch,” she says. “Don’t try to argue.”
“Your mother gave you your violin,” Joanna says, spreading a careful layer of grease on the guide rails of the Browning’s frame. “Is that why you play?”
“My shoulder’s fine, Mrs. Hudson.” Joanna turns off the phone and tucks it back into her pocket. “Anyway, he doesn’t need me. He only texted to say he wouldn’t be home tonight.”
She stands in front of the window, arms crossed over her chest. Her mouth is dry, her tongue thick with sleep. “Sherlock, is something wrong with our front door?”
“This should be with you or your sister,” she says, her eyes on the long columns of names and dates burnt black into the wood. “It’s meant to be used.”
, the smile says, and rage clenches like a living fist in Joanna’s chest. “Tell me one thing you remember about your grandmother.”
“One of your better attempts, certainly,” Sherlock says, and before she can object he’s scooped her off the floor and into his arms, carrying her back to the bed like she’s a newly-wed sack of bloody potatoes. She covers her face with her hand and groans.
“Well, excuse me, Miss Glinda. For some reason no one ever bothered to fill me in on the proper terminology.” Harry heaves her handbag into her lap and pulls out her mobile. She slaps it onto the table between them. “Take it. It’s 2010; no one uses a landline anymore.” She stands, folding her coat over one arm. “You know, if you end up dying in a gutter somewhere I’m going to be terribly annoyed.”
Harry’s face goes still and quiet and shuttered, and Joanna hates herself for it, a little. “Yeah,” Harry says, looking away. “Of course. Good idea.” She hesitates, then takes a step into the room. “You want some company?”
They’d packed the book away when their parents died, along with her mother’s murder mysteries and her father’s poetry. Harry was too old for fairy stories then, and as the years passed Joanna forgot, as she’d forgotten so many things.
“Sherlock will be furious when he finds out he missed this,” Joanna tells them from the study’s open door, watching Mycroft try to scowl at Mrs Hudson and chew at the same time. “If I weren’t incorporeal right now, I’d take pictures.”
Once he shows her his mother’s silhouette as she passes in the corridor, a slim, elegant shape that shifts seamlessly from one shadow to the next. Most days his house seems as empty as hers.
Joanna rises and goes to the window, pushing the drape aside. Outside she sees a peerless blue sky and the empty front step. The stranger is gone.
Sherlock flips through the pages – slowly at first, and then faster. He stops abruptly, just short of the end. Joanna watches him stiffen, rigid muscles tensing in his shoulders and back, and wishes she could fully see his face. His profile reveals nothing.
“Yes. Yes, you are.” His hand moves to her hair, the plait at the back of her neck. It settles there, a long-fingered weight against her spine. “Do you know why?”
“Of course he’s bloody well going to kill me,” Joanna says, grinning wide enough to make her cheeks ache. “Less than twelve hours ago I put a psychotic criminal mastermind in a headlock for the man, and God only knows what I’ll be doing for him twelve hours from now; I hardly need some ancient magical artefact to tell me how
The rich man’s son soon recovered, though he limped on the bitten leg for the rest of his long life. When his father died he inherited his great fortune and his grand house in the middle of the town. The rich man and his wife lived there happily for many long years, until the day the rich man’s wife woke to see Death standing at the foot of their bed.
The car slows and comes to a stop. There’s a knock on the window, and Moriarty slouches back in his seat.
And so Death gave the girl Agamede his scythe, with its blade as sharp as blood is red and its yew-wood shaft as long as night is black. The girl took it, and held it close at her side.
“That would have been the sensible response, yes.” She rubs idly at the stiffness in her knee. For a long moment she doesn’t say anything at all. “Whatever you saw in the mirror, it must be important to you.”
“You’ve told me that you haven’t been close with your sister since you were small. Since your parents’ deaths.” Thompson leans forward slightly in her chair, and the silver charms on her bracelet catch the light from the office window. The two of the charms touch, and the sound is like a bell chime. “Your grandmother took you in after the accident, is that right?”
The body in the bed is unchanged. In the half-light of the hallway her face is a study in ivory and shadow, as smooth and unforgiving as stone. Her pale hands are folded over her stomach, and her hair is loose around her shoulders. Sherlock switches on a lamp, and in the warmer light Joanna can see the slight rise and fall of her chest as she breathes.
,” Joanna says, laughing around the lingering taste of earth on her tongue. She laughs until her throat aches, until her stomach roils and her eyes water and she remembers not having eyes at all, remembers Moran’s lined face and red blood and the black hollow of the oak tree as it drew her inside.
A stranger looked back at her, his round face luminous and pale. He was beautiful and his eyes were kind, and Agamede, who had cared neither for beauty nor for kindness, could not turn away from him. She sank to her knees beside the water and as the hours passed she forgot all but the sight of his face. The sun rose, sanguine and gold, and when its light touched the pool the man was gone.
‘Look again,’ said the witch of the wood, and when the widow Agamede looked again into the mirror she had made, she saw her young husband standing in Death’s place, holding his hands out wide in the grove of white trees.
“Snotty,” Joanna mutters, just under her breath, and weaves her way through stacks of boxes and crates and disassembled furniture. The dust grows thicker as she passes from the mid- to the early nineties, and then, from the corner of her eye, she sees her grandmother’s kitchen table.
“Excuse me,” Joanna says through gritted teeth, her face hot with embarrassment. “I have to get my flatmate upstairs so I can break the rest of his ribs. Goodnight.”
She says his name through chattering teeth. “Sherlock.” Her fingers cup the heat at the nape of his neck. “Sherlock, what the
Years passed, and Death kept his word; the girl did not see him again. She took the book, the blade, and the horn and travelled far from the village where she’d been a child, through forests and cities, along deep ravines and across storm-churned seas, and wherever she went she used Death’s own gifts to save those he would have taken. Word of her skill spread far, and with the secrets written in the black book she cured kings in their castles and labourers in their fields, delivered whole those infants meant to die and restored to the aged the strength of youth. The girl grew to be a woman, and where she walked the people had no fear of death.
“Of course not. It was the family of invisible elves who live in your fireplace. They love a good javelin toss.” The assistant pushes herself out of the chair, Blackberry clutched in one hand. “That was sarcasm, by the way. It was definitely you.”
The man called Moran reaches up and touches the shell of his ear. He lowers his hand, showing her the dots of blood on his fingertips. “I see you don’t share your father’s fondness for Eliot.”
“I won’t let them. Give me your hand.” No hesitation this time – he holds his right hand out palm up and she jabs him with the needle, drawing blood. She looks up and meets his eyes. “I can help you breathe once you’re inside. Will you let me?”
“DI Dimmock knows our address. If he has questions, he’s free to ask them later.” Sherlock turns away from the body, and Joanna follows him out of the warehouse and into the lamp lit street. It’s raining lightly, mist cooling the summer air. They’ll need to walk some distance before they find a taxi.
“I’m sure jewels all over Britain sleep easier tonight because of you.” She frowns; he’s trying to hide it, but he’s still shivering. “Do you need help with your shoes and trousers?”
Joanna slides out of bed, and he looks up. He nods politely. “Hello, Joanna,” he says, the depth of his voice muffled by the glass. “Enjoying your evening?”
Her right arm is swallowed to the elbow, encased in the living wood of the trunk. She breathes, and the oak breathes with her. She clenches her fist, and Moran hisses in pain.
Harry smiles. It isn’t a particularly pleasant expression. “She frightened him. She frightened a lot of people, you know that.”
The hermit lay awake, his clever eyes unclouded by fever. The girl touched her fingers to his forehead, to the echo of his heart’s beat at throat and wrist. He batted her hand away. “Girl,” he said, “you have not slept.”
people – she tries to help them, of course she does, but everyone disappoints poor Saint Jo in the end. Poor, suffering Saint Jo.”
Harry laughs, but the sound is not a happy one. “I’m not going anywhere. Not unless you’re coming with me.”
The other woman pauses, and for a moment she looks almost bemused, as if she’d forgotten the elder Holmes entirely and was struggling to place the name. “I don’t see why I should,” she says finally. “We’ve been aware of Moriarty’s obsession with the mirror for some time, but without Moran he had little hope of finding it. Now that his pet warlock is returned to London—” She shrugs and offers Joanna the book. “Moriarty will either use the mirror or he will not. What you’ve seen in it is irrelevant.”
“Harry, no!” Sherlock cries, but the oak is already growing, her branches crashing through the roof and spiralling towards sunlight and the sky. The old house begins to crumble around them in a hail of plaster and brick and wood, but neither of the humans runs for safety.
“You’re going to lose!” he shouts, and disappears down the long, wide hallway. Joanna hears a polite sniff from just above her right shoulder; she turns and sees a pudgy thirteen-year-old Mycroft standing on the step behind her, carefully turning the crisp page of a paperback book.
“Of course.” He sets the book down on the table. “Despite recent revelations, the simplest explanation is still the best one. You would do well to remember, Sherlock – it is not the world that has changed, but your perception of it. Not every mystery has magic at its heart.”
Sherlock blinks at him. “Yes. Obviously. You promised Amelia that her son’s remains would finally be recovered, and in exchange she agreed to trap Joanna here when we arrived to investigate.”
, it will be soon. Harry watches the battle from the sidelines, curled at the kitchen table with her head in her hands. Joanna shakes with rage, her fists clenched as she paces the tile.
Gran pushes herself out of her chair, leaning heavily on her cane. “I suppose you want a reward of some kind, then.”
“Doesn’t take a genius to deduce that someone with a hangover might be a bit dehydrated.” She nudges him with her knee. “Thank you for the water.”
The bride banged her fist on the door of the little black house. ‘Come out, Mother Witch, come out!’ she said, and out came the witch of the wood.
At first the rich man’s wife did not believe him, but you and I know that Death cannot lie; the body in the bed beside her was cold and still. The rich man had been dead for hours, while his wife lay sleeping.
The gun is whole again but for its magazine. She tests it quickly, aims it at the floor and tugs back the slide in a smooth, practiced motion. She eases her finger over the trigger. “Alfred Boyle didn’t die of a heart attack,” she says, and pulls.
“Now,” she says, and the shadow stabs the needle into its own heart, plunging the point deep into the wood of the door.
“Acute photosensitivity,” Sherlock says from over her shoulder. “She kept heavy shades on all her lamps, and often worked by candlelight.” He leans forward until his mouth is near her ear. “Well observed, but hardly germane to the task at hand.”
After a moment, she nods.  He pulls a folded piece of paper from his coat and passes it to Sherlock.
Sigils are complex, capricious things, often highly personal and easy to misread; the basic intent of the spell on the tyres is invisibility, sure enough, but the subtleties—
He blinks at her, a brown smudge of sauce between his eyes. “That, I imagine, was an attempt to make some sort of point.”
His palm cups the top of her spine and she goes quiet, curled over her knees and breathing hard into the sudden silence. A seed embedded deep in the fibres of the mat at her feet sprouts delicate roots and a thin, spiked stem; Sherlock’s thumb brushes the sensitive skin behind her ear, and the thistle blooms.
He has mud smeared across his forehead, down his left cheek and the long bridge of his nose. His hair has curled in the heat, turned stiff with dirt and sweat, and his clothes are no better – suit jacket missing, trousers ripped at the knees. His knuckles are badly bruised, raw and bleeding; she wants to take his hands and press them against her face, wrap her fingers around his wrists and feel the heartbeat under his living skin.
. She rubs Harry’s back in small, soothing circles. “She’s just trying to do what’s best for you – she always does. The woman would set herself on fire for you, if you asked.”
Joanna’s grandmother died on a clear morning in early spring, just before dawn. Joanna sat by her bed for a long time afterward, fingers pressed to the paper-soft skin at her grandmother’s wrist. Then she walked down to the kitchen, phoned for an ambulance, and went to find the soldering iron.
He huffs. “You know it is. You wouldn’t have left it out for me to find, otherwise.” He steps off the armchair and down to the floor. “Yew is an unusual wood for a cane. Not unheard of, but irregular and therefore significant.” He curves his fingers beneath the handle and lets it swing before him in the air. “It was hand carved for its original owner no less than forty years ago. Expertly made and tailored exactly to the owner’s tastes and needs – simple, sturdy, hardwearing. Elegant yet utilitarian. It belonged to your grandfather.”
She rips open the bottom seam with her good hand and her teeth, wrinkling her nose against the smell. Datura stinks of decay, of birds rotting in shoeboxes. Sick beds and blood on sand. She reaches into the open satchel and pinches two gloved fingers through the leaves and seeds and ash until she finds the source of the spell that nearly killed her.
Harry sits at the table each night, her head bent over cups of coffee long gone cold. She reads old magazines and eats crackers and brushes the crumbs onto the floor, her eyes red-rimmed and dry. She waits for sunrise, and she does not drink.
“Insufferable woman,” Sherlock murmurs, and rolls over until his face is squashed against the back of the sofa. She has a sudden, inexplicable urge to reach down and ruffle his hair. “If you do,” he says, somewhat nasally, “I shall bite you.”
her grandmother did not say, would never say again, and Joanna burnt the rest of the inscription into the wood with the tip of one finger, smoke curling around her skin.
The bathroom is wonderfully warm. She strips off her wet cardigan, her shoes and her socks, and dumps them all with Sherlock’s things into the bath. She washes her hands with hot water and soap, trying not to look too closely at her reflection in the mirror. Her hair is a tangled mess, her face raw and bruised dark beneath the eyes. She shuts off the tap and crouches down to open the cabinet.
“Agamede’s, passed down from descendant to descendant. Passed down to you.” Adrienne steps closer, and her heels click on the concrete floor. “What did you see in it, Joanna?”
Joanna looks down at her chart, her shoulders slightly hunched. “You know Harry didn’t mean it like that.”
The satchel hangs high in the window over the sink, tied to the curtain rod with a bit of twine. Joanna pushes up onto her toes and reaches for it, fingers outstretched.
Joanna sits back against seat, wrists pinned tight between her back and the leather. “What about the boy? Carl Powers. Was that a proper drowning?”
She grins stupidly at them. “If I gave them my blood every day, we’d have a full-grown garden within a week.”
Thompson sits back, her hands folded in her lap. The bracelet stills. “Sherlock can’t cure you, Joanna, not completely. I think you know that.” She gives Joanna a small, encouraging, infuriating smile.
The next morning Joanna limps downstairs to find her grandmother’s cane mounted by hooks to the wall above the sitting room fireplace, just below the mirror. When she looks closer, she sees that the cane’s been polished, the yew wood gleaming almost red in the morning light. The skull grins widely at her, and she grins back.
“Yes, but not from the same source – your options for friendly companionship are considerably more limited. You do think of me as a strange sort of comrade in arms, but as has already been established, I was otherwise occupied. That leaves Mrs Hudson, Mike Stamford, or Lestrade. Good souls all, but none of them likely to welcome you into their bed any time soon.” He smirks. “At least, not until Lestrade’s wife leaves him again. Bit of a wait on that one, though – two months, minimum. Not sure he’s worth it, honestly; you’ve seen the man try to open a packet of crisps.”
Sherlock stands, the bruise a shadow across his ribs. “No, I didn’t. But then, I am rather clever.” He lifts his hand until his fingers hover over her left shoulder, just above the scar. “May I?”
She finds Sherlock standing outside, looking in. His hand clenches on the doorframe; for a moment he is perfectly still, his shoulders rigid beneath his rumpled shirt. Then he lowers his hand and goes inside.
“I performed according to expectations. Earned myself a shiny gold star.” Her fingers brush the damp sleeve of his suit jacket, reaching without her permission to pinch the fabric and feel the gentle heat-thrum of the sigils sewn inside. “He wants you dead, Sherlock.”
The witch of the wood sat in a chair outside the door, waiting. She looked the widow up and down with her laughing black eyes and said, ‘No, you are much too old. Come back when you are younger, and I will bake you in my oven and eat you for my supper.’
The bed would be more comfortable, but even with a towel laid beneath it can be difficult to contain the mess. Instead she sits with her back at the open window, towel and brushes and tools spread in front of her like a place setting at a rather morbid dinner table. She works in silence, her fingers slick with solvent and oil.
The house is tall and old and narrow like most near the wood, but it seems almost curiously well cared for; as her eyes adjust to the sunlight, Joanna notes the neatly trimmed hedges and too-perfect flowerbeds, the fresh paint on the eaves and window frames. A child’s swing hangs from the branch of a nearby ash tree, swaying gently in the breeze.
“No, of course not,” Joanna says before she can stop herself. “Dad never left Mum. He decided to take her with him instead.”
The hermit’s cottage was dark and smelled of rotting food and sick; the girl pinned the curtains back from the windows and let in light and the summer air. The hermit slept and sweated with fever; the girl drew pails of cool water from the well and scrubbed him clean with a rag torn from the hem of her skirts. When all this was done she built a small fire in the hearth and brewed a tea with the herbs of her basket.
Sherlock turns away, feigning sudden interest in the stack of file folders on the table in front of him. “Then you can kindly ask Mrs Hudson to stop meddling and piss off.” He elbows an enormous leather bound book off the table, and it lands on the stone floor with a heavy thud. “Again.”
Joanna swallows. She knows Gran is only guessing; she could lie, if she wanted. “Yes,” she says. “I wanted to know about the mirror.”
Mrs. Hudson reaches across the table and pats her hand. “You needn’t worry about me, Joanna. I have some experience with dangerous men.”
and she almost forms the words aloud before the dream fades and she recognises Sherlock, trapped outside on the fire escape. He’s crouched at her window, trying to free the latch.
The pull surprises him, and he drops the comb. She hears it fall, but he doesn’t bend to pick it up. He stands close, and for a moment she can feel the warmth of him at her back. He drags his fingers through her hair, and they slip through easily, unimpeded by tangles or knots.
Joanna turns around. The building rises tall above her, its featureless stone façade almost deliberately bland. She turns toward the street and sees one of Mycroft’s town cars waiting for her, door open. Adrienne is already inside, staring at the screen of her Blackberry.
“That won’t be necessary. Her discomfort is only temporary, I assure you.” Mycroft walks to the door and opens it. He turns back, his hand on the doorknob. “You have a remarkable gift, Joanna. I hate to think it might ever be used against you.” He leaves, closing the door behind him.
“They’ll find that she ingested the datura voluntarily during the autopsy. Until then, this is your proof.”
. She isn’t hung-over; she’s half-dead with magical exhaustion. She turns her face into the pillow and groans. “Mrs. Hudson. She must hate me.”
She smiles. “No sane person would call sharing with you convenient.” She turns her head to look over her shoulder at him, but he stops her. Brushes two cool fingers over the forgotten sting of the injection site at her throat, the welt and the bruise. She feels her pulse under his fingertips.
All of which is worth precisely fuck all when he’s about to get his neck snapped by an enraged serial murderer.
, and then the foundation of the house shudders beneath her. Harry screeches, grabbing hold of the table, and the tremors shake the pots from their hooks, the cups and bowls from their shelves. The lamp swings wildly from the ceiling, ceramic and glass shattering across the floor, and then Gran reaches out and pokes Joanna hard in the shoulder with the end of her cane. Everything goes still.
“You were a talented surgeon. You could have been of use here.” Joanna looks away, and Thompson leans forward, persistent. “It wasn’t enough for you. Why not?”
“Twice. Both times to defend a patient from an immediate threat.” She looks away, easing her weight off her leg. Her fingers twitch, reaching for the cane she no longer needs to carry. She forces a chuckle. “You were right about one thing – I’m definitely about to crash. Mind if I kip on the sofa for a few hours?”
Gran doesn’t frown, but a new line furrows between her eyebrows. “You’re too young. Next year, maybe.”
“Yes,” Joanna says. “Now drink.” She slips out of bed and pulls a clean t-shirt and pair of boxers from her dresser. She tosses them at Harry’s feet. “At least one more glass of water after that, and then you’re going to sleep it off. If you still want to talk in the morning, we’ll talk.” She closes the dresser drawer, and when she turns back to the bed Harry’s staring into space, resignation dark in her red-rimmed eyes. Joanna sighs. “I’m sorry. I wish there were something I could do.”
“Maybe it’s for the best,” she says to no one, her voice cracking a little with disuse. “I’m not a child anymore either.”
“Well, I did learn from the best.” She shuffles to the bedroom door. “The ‘best’ is you, in case you were wondering.”
She stretches a little, testing the stiffness in the muscles of her back and arms. Her bad shoulder aches. “How long have I been asleep?”
“No,” he says. “No, I wouldn’t think so.” He looks away, his bright eyes focusing on the great oak above her. “If you still intend to kill me, Joanna, you should do it now.”
“Regular cleaning is an essential part of gun maintenance.” She sweeps a brush along the inside bore of the slide, clearing away a thin sheen of dust and unburned powder.
He shakes his head. His gaze is still fixed on their hands. His skin against hers. “No,” he says. “I didn’t.” The calloused tip of his finger maps the scar tissue of her palm, the touch impersonal and maddeningly light. Her breathing changes, deepens, and her knuckles brush the soft underside of his wrist. She watches the rise and fall of his chest and marks its rhythm as it slows to match hers. “These scars are from self-inflicted wounds,” he says finally, his voice low. “All more than twenty years old, none of them serious. Some were made with a small knife, but most with a sharp, slender tool with a pointed tip.” He looks up and meets her eyes. “A sewing needle.”
“Probably,” she says. She wipes the brush clean on the towel. “Do you have something you want to say to me, Sherlock, or did you just come upstairs to pick a fight?”
There’s a strange strain in the fine lines around his eyes, at the corner of his mouth. He watches her face, waiting for her answer.
He leans in close, his eyes darting across her face. “Flushed skin, dilated pupils.” He presses two clinical fingers to the hollow of her throat. “Accelerated pulse.”
“Gran, please—” Joanna tries to take her arm, to lead her back to the sitting room, but Gran shrugs her off.
. Devil’s Weed, or Moonflower. Used as a hallucinogen or lethal toxin. Symptoms include delirium, hyperthermia, and severe sinus tachycardia; overdose can result in coma and death.”
This chapter also involves some graphic gun violence, but nothing much beyond what has been featured in the show itself.
Joanna folds her hands over her stomach. “The magic? You never understood why I liked it in the first place.”
“I’m gorgeous,” Harry says. “I’m single for the first time in a decade, my sister’s home from her suicide mission in a desert hell, and my weekly Pilates has done simply
Sherlock rips open the plastic dry cleaning bag, revealing several of Harry’s absurdly expensive tailored suits. “Your arm isn’t bleeding.”
, Joanna thinks, and she’s about to slip out of bed when she hears Sherlock’s reply – his voice louder now, almost careless.
The smell rises from the sawdust, and Adrienne’s fingers go still on the keyboard. She slowly turns her head and looks down at the box, her eyes slightly wide. “This was in your flat.”
Harry keeps their grandmother’s kitchen table in a storage unit in Haringey. Joanna remembers sitting beneath it when she was small, tracing the burnt letters of her name. Of her mother’s.
Her grandmother’s cane, on the other hand, was bound to draw his attention. She hasn’t lived in Baker Street a week when she comes home from the shops to find him perched on the back of her armchair, balancing it between two long fingers.
“And what about pain management?” she asks. “If you won’t stay in hospital and you won’t let me hire a nurse, what am I meant to do when it gets bad, Gran? Draw up another decoction of willow bark and put a fucking knife under the bed to
The stack of paper doesn’t seem to have anything else to say. Joanna crouches beside it and shifts through the mess until she finds a battered wooden cigar box with a Post-It stuck to the top.
Joanna stands, furious and beautifully, beatifically calm. “And what the bloody fuck,” she says, “is that supposed to mean?”
Joanna tries very hard not to laugh. If she starts again, she might not stop. “Well, now you know,” she says. “Your new flatmate is a cold-blooded killer. Shoots a deranged cabbie one minute, devours a double order of beef with broccoli the next.” She leans forward, her arms folded on the table. “And so you ask yourself: what fresh terrors lie beneath her mild-mannered exterior? What
,” Mycroft says, sitting back in his chair, “is Sebastian Moran, a devoted confederate of the man you know as James Moriarty.”
“You hardly needed to. I’m sure there’s something in the way I butter my toast or clean my teeth or tie my bloody shoelaces that gives me away. As far as you’re concerned, I may as well have the word
“You sent it to me,” Sherlock says, his fingers steepled beneath his chin. “Thirty years ago, from the shop in Peterborough Road.”
, he’d said, but now he stands like a ghost in front of her, barefoot and damp and slightly flushed from the warmth of the flat, and it can’t be him. She would’ve known.
“He won’t. There are other ways.” He shifts uneasily in her grip. “All wards have their vulnerabilities, Joanna – even Helene’s. Even yours, though you nearly killed yourself in the casting.” He shakes his head, the hard lines of his face deepening.  “She should have given you to me when I asked; I would have taught you not to be so reckless. I would have taught you
Adrienne tests the first knot, and the edge of the rug twitches. “Not bad. I prefer coir when I use mass-produced. It has a nice spring to it.” She drops the string into Joanna’s open hand. “I could get you some, if you’d like.”
The song is meandering, tuneless – the soft, absent-minded sort of lullaby you hum to yourself when no one else can hear you. It sounds at first as though the song is coming from very far away, and Joanna strains to hear it – the rise and fall of Mrs Hudson’s voice and the familiar rustles and clicks as she putters about a room, tidying and straightening. So rarely able to stay still.
Then he looks down again at the remains of the dead child, and all she sees is her idiot flatmate, desperately seeking a puzzle to solve. She climbs carefully down into the pit and stands at his side. They watch as a frizzy-haired tech works in silence, brushing dirt from ribs and bird-thin shoulders.
.” Joanna doesn’t raise her voice, but she’s never needed to – not when she uses this particular tone. Its effect is dramatic and immediate. Harry’s mouth closes with an audible click of teeth, and Joanna sighs into the silence. “I know you’re worried, Harry, but I’m sorting this out on my own. End of story, end of conversation.”
The shadow snaps the fire back by its wrist and forces it face down onto the bricks. It writhes in her hold, crackling with sparks, and then with a sudden, sharp roll to the side it flips their positions, pinning the shadow to the ground with both burning hands wrapped around her dark throat.
,” he says, and that’s when Moran steps around the table and aims the gun at the back of Sherlock’s head.
She can buy Sherlock and Mrs Hudson more time. She can force the wards to hold. All she needs is a needle and thread.
The witch began to close the door, but the bride stopped her with a long-fingered hand. ‘Death has come for my young husband,’ the bride said. ‘If you save him from the viper’s bite, I will do whatever you ask.’
The angle is odd, different from the day before – he’s above her somehow, kneeling, and beyond the dark halo of his hair she sees the ceiling of his room, the foot of the bed. His face is close, but his eerie, colourless gaze is fixed on something just out of sight. He sees her, but only from the corner of his eye.
,” she breathes, and glances down at the crisps again, her too-long fringe falling into her eyes. At the edge of her vision she sees the boy’s face, and the impatient twitch of his eyebrows. He says something, his mouth forming a quick, soundless series of words – a question, she thinks, but she can’t be sure. She taps her ear once and makes a slashing movement with her hand:
“It is,” Joanna says around the cold lump at the back of her throat. “Very important.” She looks up and meets her grandmother’s steady blue gaze. “Will you unlock the door?”
Moran stiffens a little. “Quite right. Time to soldier on.” He moves to press his hand palm down on the table. “I’m afraid I’ll need your gun for this next part, Joanna,” he says, and then with a terrible sucking sound the splinters collapse back into the table, ripping through the flesh of Joanna’s arm. Moran snatches the gun from her hand just before she falls to the floor, clutching her bleeding arm and biting back a scream.
“I told them he’d exhibited symptoms of a heart attack before he collapsed,” Sherlock says in an undertone. “Is that all right?” When she doesn’t answer, he steps between her and the body, his head dipped towards hers. “Joanna? Is that all right?”
, the boy had said, and in the simplest, strongest of magics that’s all that’s required – intent and the sting of fresh-spilled blood. Joanna looks down at the long-faded scars of her open palm and says, “I can’t, Mycroft. Don’t ask me again.”
“No,” he says, “I don’t suppose I will.” He scoops up an armful of books from the table and holds them to his chest, tea mug clutched in his other hand. He walks out of the kitchen without another word. A moment later, she hears the soft click of his bedroom door as it closes.
“Oh, aren’t you?” He closes the book with a snap. “Well, never mind, then. I was going to ask you to read my palm, but I suppose I won’t bother now. Killjoy.”
“Yes. For a person not sentimental about much else.” He gives her the recipe book, shifting its weight into her hands. “My mother died when I was sixteen.”
“I can’t really imagine Clara threatening anyone with anything,” Joanna says. Harry’s hands are steady, her face perfectly smooth. Joanna wonders what her eyes look like behind the sunglasses. “Are you all right?”
She rubs her fingers over the unbroken skin of her right forearm. The places the splinters broke through. The skin is as smooth as polished wood.
The boy stands, unfurling gracefully from his chair. He’s taller than she is now; if she were standing, she’d only come up to his chin. He walks to the bed and leans over her, his face just above her own. “I’m afraid you haven’t been paying attention,” he says, his voice smooth and touched by the cold certainty in his smile. “I only ever tolerated your presence for the sake of the puzzle you presented. Now that I’m certain you aren’t real, these little visits have become nothing more than an egregious waste of my time.”
must give her answer for her, because he lifts the wet weight of hair from her neck and begins to work the comb through, one knot at a time.
In a week or so the plot will be ready and the weather warm enough, and they’ll sow the first seeds of the year’s garden. Joanna’s never had a garden before, never wanted so much as a potted plant, but now she feels a solid sort of contentment at the thought of a summer spent outside, tending to growing things.
She sews three stitches of blue thread in the palm of her hand, blue beside white beside black. When it’s done, the shadow on the door points her needle towards its heart.
“The mirror?” Joanna asks, frowning. There’s a cracked antique mirror over her grandmother’s armoire that might be worth something if the glass were replaced; still, she can’t imagine why she’d— “Oh,” she says. Gran’s hand slips from her suddenly loose fingers. “The mirror in the attic.”
“And a lovely little corpse to use for fertiliser,” Gran says. She seizes Joanna’s wrist in strong, bone-thin fingers and turns her hand over, showing her the still bleeding wound in her palm. “This sort of power does not come cheaply, Joanna. It is not a toy, and it is not a game. You will use it wisely or not at all. Do you understand?”
The shadow shudders against the door, the edges of its silhouette suddenly darker, more defined. It looks at its hands, curling and uncurling its fingers as though fascinated by their articulation. Then the shadow looks north, her own face shown in profile, and speaks three short summoning words in a language Joanna cannot hear.
Joanna added Gran’s death the morning the ambulance left with the body. She burnt herself with the soldering iron; she still has the scar.
Joanna takes a deep breath. The fingers of her right hand clench around a cane she no longer carries. “I had Harry.”
She reached again into the twisted horn of plenty and used its gifts to prepare a thin soup for him to eat. He held the spoon himself and lifted it to his lips with an unsteady hand. “Girl,” he said, “you have not eaten.”
They found the pool at the heart of a grove of birch trees, far from the village and the home of any living man. The trees were bare, and stood like pale sentries around the water. The woman reached out and found their bark cold to the touch. The pool lay just beyond, its surface as still as silence and as smooth as glass.
A beam from the roof snaps in two and smashes through the ceiling above them; the oak’s lower limbs strain to catch it before it crushes them both. Some of her branches bend under the beam’s weight, but after a perilous creaking moment, they hold. Sherlock and Harry are safe.
A sudden snap of bone and his arm is free of the tree’s grip. Before she can react he slams his hand palm down on a nearby sharp-growing branch, and she feels the slick rush of warm blood against bark.
When daylight filled the cottage, the girl went to the window for the third time and met Death with her stubborn chin raised high. “The hermit lives,” she said, and behind her the old man sighed in his sleep.
The song is not lovely, exactly. It is simple and bittersweet, each note pure and clear and uncomplicated. Joanna has never heard him play it before, or anything like it; the melody reminds her of the long nights before Gran’s death, of sitting alone beside her sickbed and listening for the sound of the wind in the chimney. For the tap of tree branches against window glass. Sherlock plays and it is beautiful, and horrible. The loneliest thing she’s ever heard.
“Probably when you dragged me out of the water with all the grace of a trained gorilla. I can already feel the bruises.” He gives up the search for the keys and slumps back against the locked door. “I don’t suppose you still have yours?”
“A favour you can return when my own manipulative elder sibling next comes to call.” He takes a step back, out of the light. “I’ll send her up. Goodnight, Joanna.”
“You need to get into dry clothes,” she says, but she pulls her dressing gown from its hook on the door and goes downstairs anyway. She’s seen Sherlock undressed before – modesty is not one of his virtues, in either sense of the word – but if he wants some privacy, she’s happy to give it to him. She’d like a little of her own, come to that.
Joanna’s fists clench behind her back, and the plastic bites into her wrists. “Seostris had something you needed, and she refused to give it to you. What was it?”
The largest map on the wall is, unsurprisingly, of London. He’s circled several locations in red ink – their flat, her grandmother’s house. The pool where Carl Powers died. Eileen Farmer’s house in Stroud Green, and Mrs Barrow’s by Coldfall Wood.
“Bruised,” he says, “not broken.” He pushes himself up onto his elbows with a poorly hidden wince. “I’m fine. You?”
The kitchen floor sags suddenly beneath the tree, sending them sliding through the mud. Sherlock heaves Joanna into his arms, one around her naked back and the other hooked under her legs. “The front door,” he says, staggering a little under her weight. “Where—”
“Perhaps,” Moriarty says. “But you can’t, can you? You turned your back on it. Gave up your inheritance for a glamorous life of sand and blood and shit.” He leans toward her, his elbows resting on his knees, like an old friend inviting a confidence. “Is that why you never told Sherlock you found my name at the crime scene? Because you knew that if you told him about the magic, he’d find out how utterly
The facts, then: she has a really terrific hangover, she’s mostly naked, and she’s in Sherlock’s bed.
When Sherlock finds her five minutes later, he drops a wad of crumpled blue paper at her feet – strips from her tattered jumpsuit, caught in thorns and brambles as she ran. She looks up at him, and he gives her a thin, unhappy smile. His skin is flushed with exertion, and he has dead leaves in his hair. When he speaks, his voice is tight with anger.
It’s a man shaped out of clay, small enough to sit easily in the palm of her hand. Its arms are bound behind its back, its clay legs tied together with twine.
Moriarty grins, wide and hollow and white as bone. “Fear death by water,” he says, and Sherlock fires.
Joanna looks at the cigar box on the desk. She can still smell the bitter mix of sawdust and magic and blood. “You have to tell him about Moran. It’s too dangerous for him not to know.”
It’s subtle, but she sees some of the tension bleed from the still muscles of his shoulders. “Perhaps, but you’d take less time in the shower if you cut it.”
Joanna has seen these pages before, has carried home pocketfuls of crow’s feathers and watched closely as her grandmother prepared decoctions of valerian root for sleeplessness and willow bark for pain. Gran prefers small problems with smaller solutions, but at the back of her stiff-paged book there are recipes for more. Recipes Joanna isn’t meant to read.
He’s still reading at the table, his dirty hair limp and falling into his face. He looks as though he’s been sleeping rough for a week, or not sleeping at all – his eyes are bloodshot and bruised, his jaw dark with unshaved stubble. She’s seen him severely sleep-deprived before; she’s never seen him like this.
it through the stitches in her palm, pushing her magic through the blood-soaked thread and deep into the shadow’s heart.
“The position of the sofa cushions, more likely.” He looks down at the book again. “Do sit, Doctor. Your leg must be paining you.”
She feels Sherlock’s hands – brushing unsteady fingers over her unseeing face, her shoulders, her back – and then he is pulling her from the earth, slowly, carefully, as if he knows how it hurts her.
In some dreams she tries to follow him. In others she looks only for an exit, an escape from the narrow garden paths and the flat, summer-blue sky overhead. She grows used to wandering alone, in sunlight and in the shade. She never finds what she’s looking for.
“If I knew what you were looking for, I might be able to help you find it,” Adrienne says, sounding like someone so used to knowing all the answers that she can’t quite remember how to ask a question. Joanna can’t help but notice that she also sounds like someone who needs to blow her nose.
The shelves under the sink are a jumble of scientific equipment, hair care products, and junk. Even so, it only takes her a moment to spot Stamford’s pilfered stethoscope. Sherlock’s left it on the top shelf, coiled neatly on top of her grandmother’s sewing kit.
Adrienne snaps up the box and pushes open the door to Mycroft’s office. She strides inside, and Joanna follows a step behind.
“Yes,” she said, “but you are not.” She lit the candle again and used a strip of cloth torn from the hem of her skirt to bind the bleeding wound in her arm. Then she sat again in the chair at the hermit’s bedside and waited for the sun to rise.
The stranger steps forward, then hesitates. The threshold between them is the same timeworn oak as the doorframe, but now the dark whorls of the grain are seeping together, bleeding through the wood like ink spilled across an empty page. The darkness spreads from the threshold to the front step, a living shadow painted across the stone, and as it grows it reaches for the stranger with two straining, long-fingered hands. The stranger stumbles backwards, off the step and into sunlight, and the darkness recedes as quickly as it had come. The threshold lies between them, once again a simple, foot worn plank of wood.
“Good evening, Doctor Watson,” he says without looking up from the time-yellowed page in front of him. “Did you enjoy your walk?”
“You know you won’t find anything,” Sherlock drawls, his head tipped against the window glass. “He’s much too clever for that.”
She closes her eyes and sees him again – pale face and dark hair and the effortless, steadying surety that whether she could see him or not he was always there, just on the other side of the glass.
A yellow toad hopped out and landed upon her young husband’s leg. It fixed its wide mouth to the viper’s bite and began to drink the venom from his blood, drawing it from his veins sip-by-sip and gulp-by-gulp. But the toad stopped too soon, pulling away from the venomous bite; the bride seized the toad and forced its wide mouth back to the wound. She made the toad drink until its small body was all over black with poison, and then it leapt from her hands and died.
“Joanna, I—” He goes silent. She listens to the sound of his breath in her ear. “I meant to thank you, earlier. For what you did. What you offered to do.”
The Joanna Watson in the bed is as pale and still as porcelain. She breathes in the shallow, steady rhythm of deep sleep and coma, her hands folded neatly over her stomach. In repose her face is smooth, untroubled; her hair spills loose across the pillows. She sleeps without dreaming while her shadow watches from the open door, a dark silhouette standing alone in the light.
“Damn,” Sherlock says, his breath hissing through his teeth. The book in his hands has sliced open a small cut in his finger; he drops it, and Joanna catches a brief glimpse of blood before he slips the finger into his mouth.
“Yes, yes, I’m all right. Don’t start tearing my clothes off again.” She stands and helps him to his feet. Her gun lies abandoned on the tile not far away. She picks it up, checks the safety, and shoves it in the waistband of her trousers.
His arm lashes out and the book hits the far wall with a muffled slap. He stares at the place where it hit, breathing hard in the silence. Then he reaches across the bed and folds his hand over the limp fingers spread across her stomach.
at the top of his lungs, waltzing himself about the empty hall to the tune of Strauss’ Blue Danube. As the melody builds he spins faster and faster, adding the occasional fart sound for musical effect.
His hair is dark, his child’s face moon pale. She sees his fingertips pressed against the glass, tapping. Trying to reach her from the other side.
It’s absurdly posh, of course, though not quite as bad as Joanna expected – the menus are bound in leather, but the daily specials are written in chalk on a sign above the bar. Joanna chooses the cheapest pasta on the menu. Harry orders the soup and a glass of red wine. When it arrives she takes a neat sip, sets the glass on the table again and says, “I’ve left Clara.”
, Gran had said once, and Joanna hadn’t argued. Hadn’t even stopped to wonder who exactly her grandmother meant when she used the word
and for the first time in months she’d felt her heart beat in her chest. Her blood in her veins. He’d stood there and smiled at her, the first real thing she’d seen since the war, and it had felt like magic.
She shrugs. The adrenaline has made her muscles feel lovely and loose; she could stare him down all day. “The postman’s never complained about it, no.”
Joanna has never swooned in her life, not even when she was nine and broke her arm falling off a climbing frame; she doesn’t intend to start now. She steps into the centre of the herb plot, remembering to stand with her feet a steady shoulder-width apart. She looks down at her trainers. “Should I be barefoot?”
The shot slams Joanna down face first into the dirt, and she feels the force of it long before the pain.
, and she doesn’t bother to try. It fits nicely beneath a loose floorboard in the upstairs bedroom, along with two boxes of ammunition and a rather passive aggressive note reminding him of the basics of gun safety and maintenance. She keeps her journal in the locked drawer of her nightstand, knowing full well that he’ll read it the first chance he gets. She hasn’t written in it since she returned to England, and most of it is irrelevant nonsense, dry recitations of the daily minutia of war. She figures if he sticks it out through that, he’s earned the right to the few secrets buried amidst the drivel.
Gran looks up then, a quick, unconscious glance at the dark shape of the house above, the gable of the attic sharp against the sky. “No,” she says. “It isn’t odd at all.” She holds out her hand for the chart. Joanna gives it to her. “There will be many things I choose not to teach you. Once you leave this house you can read all the tea leaves in China if you like, but until then—”
The night before the first autumn frost, she dreams of the boy sitting at the desk in his bedroom, bent over a book.
“That’s not what she means, Sherlock.” Joanna is suddenly aware of the gun at her waist, and the distance between Sherlock and the door. The clock in the next room begins to play the Westminster Chimes, each note round and clear as it echoes through the house. Mrs Barrow’s watery eyes go wide behind her spectacles.
He blinks up at her, squinting in the light. “Tea,” he agrees, his voice rough from lack of sleep. “And silence.”
The man’s gaze moves to Joanna, fixed bleeding to the table by her right arm and aiming the gun at his heart with her left. “Hello again, Joanna,” he says.
“If the hermit lives through this night,” Death said, “you may ask a third gift of me, and when that business is done I will leave this place. You will keep my gifts, and not see me again for many years yet.”
Joanna looks at Sherlock. He looks back at her, his expression unreadable. The clock ticks in the next room. “Yes,” Joanna says. “I think we did.”
, she thinks, and she’s about to step toward it when Sherlock whirls out of the room and down the hall.
, she says, lips moving soundlessly against earth, and even through the shock some distant, reflexive part of her mind notes the fire of the penetrating bullet wound to her left shoulder, the shattered bone and warm pooling of blood. She breathes in dust.
The boy’s jaw tenses, his face a careful blank. “I was a child then,” he says. “I’m not anymore.” He turns and disappears into the maze.
A house that size is never really quiet. Her grandmother’s house groaned and murmured and sighed as they slept, and Morland Park is no different. Joanna walks the long corridors and listens to the mournful sound of the wind in the chimneys, the settling creak of floorboards and the whispers inside the walls. It sounds almost like speech, or music; Joanna thinks of Baker Street and its city sounds, its groans and grumbles in the night. Clinking dishes in the kitchen and the faint electric hum of the bathroom lamp. His steady pacing footsteps, and the piercing tones of his violin.
The street outside is deserted, silent but for the groans and creaks of the house behind them. No police, no curious passersby – the windows of the other houses are shuttered and dark. Joanna twists in Sherlock’s arms and looks up at the crumbling roof. At the great oak’s highest branches, withering in the sun.
Donovan’s waiting for them on the other side of the tapeline, arms crossed over her chest and her eyebrows raised. “Old friends of yours?” she asks.
The twisted horn was not heavy in the girl’s hand, and it was not light. When she looked into it she saw nothing, but when she reached inside she felt its potential – the weight of the world’s abundance in her small hand. Her mouth watered at the thought of olives and of wine, of ripe apples and rich creams and foods she’d only ever dreamt of, but when her hand emerged from the horn she held only a single pomegranate. It was as red as a drop of a village girl’s blood, and smelled as sweet as a kiss.
Joanna spends each afternoon in the attic, drifting through her schoolwork and eating crisps. She unrolls a moth-eaten sleeping bag over the cold attic floorboards and nicks a few ratty pillows from the old sofa in the second floor sitting room; the boy moves his mirror to the edge of his desk, clearing away books and papers so they can see each other as they work. He never seems to do much regular schoolwork – the books he reads have long, embossed titles in French or German, or are science texts so advanced they may as well be in another language, for all she understands of them. Joanna quite likes science – it’s one of her best subjects – but she’s only just learning about gas giants and the different types of stars; it’ll be a few years yet before she’s ready for
He reaches for the doorknob, his fingertips just about to touch the fire when the warding spell slides over his hand like a burning glove. He reaches further and the corona of flame flows up his arm and over his shoulder, flaring bright and then swallowing him whole as he opens the door and steps inside, unharmed.
“You don’t want to know.” She looks down at her mobile again. “Your grandmother’s house is still one of the most heavily warded buildings in Greater London. Anything you want to keep from Moriarty is safer there than in Baker Street.”
Then she turns and walks away, pushing through the crowd until she reaches the entrance to the alley behind 221.
, a voice like her grandmother’s says, and Joanna takes the black-threaded needle from the tray and stitches it through the skin of her burning palm.
It’s all-saint’s fire, of course; Moriarty must have hidden the spell in the fake explosives. The impact of the bullet would have been more than enough to set it off.
The trunk feels hollow under her palm, empty in a way it hadn’t been the moment before. Joanna slips her hand into the glove again and walks back to the pit.
, Gran had said, and Joanna knows it to be true – knows that her body is wax and wick for a flame that consumes, a flame that burned once in the chests of her mother and grandmother and in the hearts of ancestors unnamed and innumerable. Magic passes from mother to daughter to father to son, and a long line of blood and bone and candle flame descends from deathless, ancient Agamede to simple Jo Watson – the broken soldier with a stolen gun. The woman who forgot.
Gran smiles, shaking her head. “Such a better liar than your poor sister. I’m so proud.” She walks closer, the polished tip of her cane clicking against the floorboards. “Harry didn’t lock the door, my dear – I did. Which means you’ll need more than a key to open it again.”
Joanna tucks the pencil behind her ear and closes the star chart, folding it into neat squares. “I just think it would be useful, knowing the future. Is that so odd?”
It’s half past three on a Thursday afternoon when a strange man knocks on the front door of the house.
“Fever is not the only way a man might die,” Death said. He moved closer, and his long shadow fell over the open window, blocking out the sun. “Choose your gift, child. You will have anything it is in my power to give.”
“I’m looking at those ribs the moment we get home,” Joanna says, but if he hears her, he doesn’t respond. They sit in silence until the car turns onto Baker Street twenty minutes later.
He reaches out and plucks a leaf of bok choy from the hair behind her ear. He holds it up to the light, studying the green-edged glow of its veins. “It bothers you more than you let on. Killing.”
Adrienne sniffs. “How efficient,” she says with a familiar edge to her voice, and rips the tape off the lid of the nearest box. She opens it, rolls her eyes, and drops it to the floor beside her.
“Not just voices,” Adrienne says, still looking at Mycroft. “When retrieved properly, the information inside these bottles would include a rough psychic impression of any mind within a certain radius. Basic emotional responses, some surface level thought—”
She walks up to the flames, coming as close as she dares – a stray spark could swallow her whole. The wall of fire seethes in front of her, popping and spitting with heat, and through the smoke she can see the rippling, unreal canvas of the warding spell, forced into the visual spectrum by the strain. The spell clings to the chipped paint of Mrs Hudson’s kitchen door, a sheen of magic woven from familiar threads, black and white and blue and all burning. If not for the fire, they would be close enough to touch.
Joanna looks down at her arms. Under the dirt they are pale and blue-veined and hang limp at her sides. She doesn’t see any blood.
She undoes the latch and opens the window. Night air prickles along her skin, her exposed arms and legs. She steps back, shivering, and he slips into the room, graceful despite his height and the narrow window. His shoes squelch as they hit the floor.
Harry sighs and leans toward the bed, her elbows resting on her knees. “Flowers,” she mutters under her breath. “Jo doesn’t even
. She and Harry read them over and over again, stealing the book back and forth between them in the day and repeating their favourites aloud each night in the dark, long after they were meant to be asleep.
“Magic, probably,” she says. “Though you don’t seem like the type to accept that as an explanation.”
“You know why. Don’t ask foolish questions.” Gran takes the recipe book from the shelf above the oven and sets it on the table in front of her. “You read my book without my permission.”
Thompson looks up, at the clock on the wall. The session is over. “We should continue this next week,” she says.
Joanna’s hands clench into fists at her sides, but Mycroft breaks in before she can disagree. “As I recall,” he says, “one of those visits ended with a near skewering by walking stick. I’d call that a fairly strong defence.”
Sherlock watches her fingers as they move briskly down his chest, opening his shirt. “No,” he says. “Koi pond.”
“Obviously,” he says, sounding pleased and a little off-balance, like he always does when she gives her honest opinion of his abilities. He retreats a few steps. “Ask your sister to verbally eviscerate you in a slightly less piercing tone of voice, would you? It’s distracting.”
” The door opens, and another masked man stands inside, with another gun. A corridor dark and echoing behind him. The man with the broken hand moves close behind her. “But the water is not what should frighten you,” he says, and together they take her by the shoulders and pull her into the dark.
The witch of the wood laughed a horrible laugh. ‘Just so, just so,’ she said, and took a small wooden box from the deep pocket of her skirts. ‘This box holds the antidote to any poison. I will trade it for a promise.’
The witch tapped her wise old finger three times against her wise old teeth. ‘You have already married him. What do you care if he dies and leaves you all the rich man’s money?’
Joanna squints at one of the crumpled corners of her star chart, trying to decide if a glyph is meant to be Jupiter’s thunderbolt or Ceres’ scythe. Or an inkblot. She looks up at the sky again. “I’d see more if you put out the kitchen light.”
“Moriarty asked if I remembered the story of Agamede’s Mirror. I’d forgotten, but I knew I’d seen the name before – in Seostris’ burned arcana, and in
Joanna sighs, unsurprised. “Goodnight, Anthea.” She walks over to the fireplace and returns the cane to its spot above the mantle. In the mirror she can see the assistant standing in the open doorway, watching her. “What?”
The lamps lead her to a pair of massive, curving staircases; her fingers skim the banister as she descends into a vast entrance hall, the marble steps cool under her feet. The ceiling arches overhead, and when a small boy in stiff-pressed trousers rushes past her on the stairs, the great house echoes with the sound of his footsteps.
Joanna laughs, the sound dry and humourless. “No, please – let’s talk more about my vivisected intestines. It was doing wonders for my appetite.” She pushes the door open and climbs out. “Wouldn’t have figured you for the type to be sensitive about your age.”
. Something foreign and feathered and sharp as bone and it is lodged within her trachea, growing. Sherlock wheezes beside her, hands at his own throat, looking at her with wide, panicked eyes. All around them police officers and forensic techs are breathless and gasping, on their knees in the mud fighting for air, and Joanna’s vision is turning dark at the edges when she feels the feathered thing inside her expand, feels it rise into her mouth and over her tongue and escape as a voice – a voice that is hers and is not hers at all. A voice that sounds like a child’s.
“Of course,” Joanna says, and trudges off to the bathroom. She cleans her face and teeth, re-plaits her hair and changes her clothes. When she comes back downstairs, there’s footage of a bombed out block of flats on the television.
Sherlock’s fingers slide over the names as he reads, his gaze flowing from one line to the next with unsurprising speed. Joanna watches his face as he reaches the end.
Death stood among the trees, the pomegranate red in one hand and a single torn page of yellowed paper in the other. She did not need to read it to know what it said.
The cane falls easily from the wall, leaving behind a gaping hole. Mycroft’s assistant steps up beside her. “Think your flatmate will notice?” she asks, her face so entirely without expression that for a moment Joanna thinks she’s serious. She isn’t.
Gran laughs, low and pained. “Foolish girl. Of course I have.” She squeezes Joanna’s hand. “The book is yours. The mirror too, if you want it.”
“Yes,” Joanna gasps, laughing so hard tears well in her eyes. “Yes, but ages ago. Oh god—” She dissolves into giggles again, and Adrienne stands back, the book tucked awkwardly under one arm. For the first time since Joanna met her, she looks as if she doesn’t know what to say.
The alley bricks are rough under her bare feet, still warm from the day’s sunlight. She walks quickly past the lit windows of the empty flats in 219, their lamps left burning in the rush of evacuation. The fire hasn’t spread to the other houses yet, its flames drawn to the magic of the wards, but if the wards die—
Gran clicks her tongue disapprovingly. “You’ve memorised them – that’s hardly the same as knowing them.”
The cuff of Harry’s borrowed blouse is beginning to fray; Joanna pulls at a loose thread and unravels it carefully, drawing the silk out as far as it will go until it snaps. She threads the stolen sewing needle with steady hands, and when she turns around she sees her shadow – a dark shape cast on the alley bricks by the eerie light of the flames.
Joanna hesitates on the landing, stuck halfway between the flat and the front hall. She licks her lips. “You don’t have to stay for this part,” she says. “Not if you don’t want to.”
“That’s it,” Joanna groans, pulling her upright. “You never get to call me an idiot again. Not after a stunt like that.” She helps her grandmother through the sitting room door and onto the nearest sofa. “You couldn’t just rip it to pieces or throw in it the fireplace like a normal person, could you? You had to be
, but Eliot always puts Sherlock in a mood, so she doesn’t say it aloud. She starts to laugh instead.
Adrienne stares back at her, sphinx-like and unmoved, and eases the book from her hand. “This is only a story. The mirror is real, and Agamede was its creator.”
The girl ground the flesh of the radishes into a thin paste and seasoned it with the last herbs of her basket. She warmed the paste over the hearth fire and then fed it to the hermit, spoonful by spoonful.
Joanna keeps a wooden comb in the top drawer of her bedside table. She hears Sherlock reach for it, the creak of the drawer as it opens and closes, but she still tenses when he steps close and gathers her hair in his hands.
Her left arm is numb from shoulder to fingertips, a dead weight at her side. If she hadn’t been wearing gloves the spell almost certainly would have stopped her heart – the heart thundering now in her throat, beating out its furious rhythm against her ribs.
He shakes his head. “I tell you, if it weren’t for all the paperwork I’d have to wade through after—” Anderson shouts somewhere in the distance, and Lestrade sighs again. “Bloody children, the both of them,” he mutters and disappears down the hall.
“You’re the granddaughter,” he says. “The second one. Joanna.” His voice is low, cultured despite the gravel in it. He looks past her, at the empty darkness of the front hall. “I’ve come to speak to Helene.”
Whatever it is he’s after, she hopes he gives her a little warning before it blows up in their faces.
“Could be,” Sherlock says, and for a brief moment his expression turns rueful, almost self-mocking. “Though not, I think, directed at you.” He steps back, his hand falling to his side. “Turn around.”
“So’s your face,” Joanna says cheerfully, and yanks hard on the door handle with the cold-numb fingers of her left hand. It opens, and the lights overhead blink on to reveal a long, narrow room piled high with boxes.
“Oh, to be young again,” Gran says, her voice full of false sweetness. “You might be stupid, but at least you’re resilient.” She claps Joanna on the back. “Go inside and wash that hand. I’ll catch you up.”
“I do not want his thanks,” the girl said. “I want him to live through the night. If he does, you will give me a second gift – one that I will name.”
“Yes.” She shifts in her seat, testing the give of the plastic ties. The car windows are tinted near black, but the coloured lights of the street outside flicker as they pass, distorted and indistinguishable. “Are you going to answer it?”
“I came to see you, not him.” Joanna pulls the wooden cigar box from her shopping bag and sets it down beside the keyboard. “Open it.”
Sherlock looks at her, his expression strangely awkward. Almost gentle. “She was ill, Joanna. She’d stopped taking her medication.”
He laughs, shaking his head. “Well, look at you. The girl glares daggers at your back whenever you get within three feet of him, and you still—”
She looks down. His bare feet and hers, in her white cotton socks. The floor needs sweeping. “I can’t, Sherlock.” She smiles, her heart in her throat. “Anyway. It’s not as if you’ll need me.”
Joanna licks her lips, trying not to look as desperate as she suddenly feels. “It’s my garden, isn’t it? And you said nothing that grows will work properly for me unless I do it all myself.” She holds out her hand. “Please, Gran?”
They talked of her travels, of the places she had seen and the deaths she had undone, and when they had finished the hermit emptied the cup in front of him and said, “I never thanked you for what you did.”
The bird had been pure white, the type released at weddings and at funerals, and Gran had taught Joanna how to soothe it, how to pin its struggling wings with one hand and thrust a needle into its still-beating heart with the other.
“Gran told me you’d be hiding up here,” Harry says, her shoulders hunched low as she steps up into the room. Her nose wrinkles delicately. “Jesus. This place smells like a corpse.”
She pushed past the wedding guests standing in a circle around him. The rich man’s son shuddered and twitched and twisted in the dirt, his leg black with poison, and she heard Death moving through the tall grasses.
Sherlock flips the wallet open, closes it, and throws it onto the worktop. He drifts to the other side of the kitchen, tying the belt of his dressing gown firmly around his waist. “I have a new case. I leave for Minsk in a few hours.”
“Yes.” She leans forward on her cane, her fingers folded around the handle. “Your parents died young, Joanna, and so you think all death is unfair. It isn’t.” The corner of her mouth twitches in something like a smile. “That, I think, is the last lesson I have to teach you.”
“None of my concern?” she says. “You know my grandmother’s house is warded. If Moriarty wants the mirror, he’ll need my help to get inside.”
The sound is – the sound is not a sound but a sensation, a tremor in the earth and a shudder in the teeth. Then it passes and Joanna is choking, is clutching her throat because there is something trapped
She breathes clean air for him – one deep breath, then two. His heart beats fast in the palm of her hand.
“Right,” Joanna says, under her breath. She takes the silver needle in her right hand, pinched between her thumb and forefinger, and holds her left out over the ground. Then she takes a deep, sun-warmed breath and stabs the needle into the centre of her palm.
Joanna slips over the side, landing on the flooded carpet with her legs tangled in the heavy wet flannel of her nightgown. Sherlock inches towards her, his knees sliding in mud. He smells like stale air and cigarettes, and he’s as hot as a furnace under her hands when she reaches out and draws him in, pulling herself up by his shoulders.
“It’s written in my diary,” the woman says. “Has been for weeks. Otherwise I tend to forget, you know; the old noggin’s not quite what it used to be.” She looks up at Joanna. “Won’t you sit, dear? I’ll make us a nice pot of tea.”
“Let me try,” she says, and pushes him gently aside. It’s her latch, and it’s locking her window – a simple piece of steel bound to wood, atoms and electrons and the silent, ever-listening space between.
There’s only one chair. Sherlock sits at the round table in the centre of the room, his head bent over the open book.
“Not a problem.” Sherlock opens his legs, letting her step between. He tips back his head and looks up at her, a smirk curling at the corner of his mouth. “I have a very high tolerance.”
“I bet he has pamphlets,” Gran says. “I bet he visits all the little old ladies and tries to save their sweet little pensioner souls before they croak.”
Mycroft looks up from the book, something almost like uncertainty in his eyes. “You remembered this. After thirty years.”
. He drops it onto the worktop. “Also your grandmother’s, I see.” He frowns at the worn cover, tracing the blurred silhouette of the woman pictured there. Her cornucopia and her scythe.
“I could say the same to you. At least I’ve eaten in the last twenty-four hours.” She sets the brush aside and looks up at him. “What do you want, Sherlock?”
Used to treat pain, inflammation, and bleeding wounds. Not as good as borage for courage, but better than mugwort for protection of a home.” She looks up, her fingers still buried in the soil. “Rosemary for memory, comfrey for knitting bone, cinquefoil for strength, asphodel for the dead. I know these, Gran. You don’t have to keep testing me.”
It isn’t really a question; you don’t have to be Sherlock Holmes to see the sheen of sweat on her skin or the way her left hand trembles at her side. “Thank you,” Joanna says. “For trying to keep her out.”
Joanna crushes their hands together, palm to palm and blood to blood, and then with a deep breath she stretches up onto her toes and pulls Sherlock’s face down to hers, fitting her lips over his open mouth. She breathes out hard into the heat of him, her air in his lungs and his mouth under hers, and when he inhales she feels the pulse of their twinned heartbeats in her bleeding hand.
Gran rolls her eyes toward the sky, as if asking it for patience or mercy or a conveniently timed lightning bolt. Joanna starts to giggle again; her grandmother is hilarious. “I most certainly am not,” Gran says, peevish. “And be careful of the thyme as you get up – your little stunt woke some of the perennials.”
If Sherlock is right, Seostris was using datura to augment both her spells and her state of mind as she cast them. This time of year, she’d almost certainly have to be growing her own, probably under a heat lamp in a garden shed behind the house – she’d have kept the datura as isolated as possible, and she never would have handled it without gloves. Unless, of course, she were about to commit suicide.
She reaches into her trouser pocket and takes out the broken stick of white chalk she’d nicked from a drawer in Sherlock’s desk that morning. It’s been some time since she last wrote in chalk; it feels cool in her too-warm hand, sliding smooth between her fingers. She crouches in front of the storage unit lock and writes the first sigil. Chalk squeaks against steel.
“You’re wasting your time,” says the boy in a high, posh voice she’s never heard. The manor garden has twisted, grown a labyrinth’s walls and a labyrinth’s silence. It towers high above them. The boy folds his arms across his narrow chest. “Only children look for things that aren’t really there.”
The front door of 221 is dark wood, solid in its moulded frame and cool against the skin of her palms. Joanna has walked through this door hundreds of times, maybe thousands. She has locked and unlocked it, turned tumblers and thrown bolts, has crossed its threshold time and again and lived for months within the walls of its house – the house that rises around her now, a body of wallpaper and wood and brick. She has counted its steps and scuffed them with her heels, has shouted up to the flat above and down to the basement below and slept and bled and dreamt beneath its tiled roof. A house has bones and flesh, the joints of its floorboards and watching eyes set in window frames and as much as any house has ever been, this is her home. Her bones and her flesh.
The bomber. Joanna sits up, rubbing her hand over her face. The flat is freezing, but early morning sunlight streams in through the cracks in the boarded up windows. She tugs the blanket close around her. “Did I say anything?”
Her legs give out and she lands hard on her knees, gritting her teeth against the pain. It’s not enough. They need more time. She didn’t give them enough time.
Night fell, and the widow polished the stone that stood over the rich man’s grave until it shone like a mirror in the moonlight. When she looked at the stone she saw the dark heart of the wood razed to the ground, a terrible black-towered city burning in its place, and she saw the grove of white trees, but she did not see her beloved.
She feels the rip and the tear of it, feels blisters of heat beneath her skin like the sparks of a flame yet to catch
as she had been taught; she was not the sort to waste time with pointless courtesies. “This is a hermit’s cottage,” she said, “and he does not welcome strangers.”
Joanna lurches out of her chair, ready to grab Sherlock and run for the door, but the old woman yanks her back down with impossible strength, pinning her arm to the table. The clock chimes the hour, and Mrs Barrow begins to weep.
,” he says, and his mother coughs a little, trying to hide a laugh. Sherlock slides the violin under his arm and pours a glass of water from the pitcher on the bedside table. “Stop it,” he says, pressing the glass into her thin hands. “You’ll send yourself into another fit.”
“Drive!” Sherlock shouts, and Harry’s foot hits the pedal hard, sending them speeding toward Baker Street.
“I’m not shot,” he says, his voice faint. “Blacked out when—” her searching fingers find the fourth and fifth ribs on his left side and he hisses. “When we hit the water.”
“Well, if you insist,” Harry says, still sounding a little shaken. She walks at half her normal pace as she leads the way to the restaurant.
Sherlock’s pyjamas and dressing gown are in a pile on the bathroom floor. She scoops them up into her arms and grabs two of the cleanest-looking towels from their racks. When she gets back to her room, she finds Sherlock still in his shirtsleeves and trousers, his suit jacket a wet lump behind him on the floor. His coat is spread carefully across her bed, leeching muddy water into the sheets.
Sherlock opens the door and jumps out of the car, Joanna barefoot right behind him. They weave through cars until they hit the pavement at a run, Sherlock leading the way as they fly past people and shops and streetlamps. They turn onto Baker Street and nearly collide with the hushed crowd watching from the barricades.
The sun is hot overhead. Joanna squints up at the sky, trying to guess the time. It’s early morning still, but soon the heat will be unbearable. She should get Gran inside.
The needle swings towards the ground in a perfect arc. Just before it falls, Joanna’s shadow reaches out and catches it.
There was a forgotten legend, he said, a legend of a pool in the forest whose waters were as dark as ink and as still as a mirror. It had been hidden long ago and wisely, for a man who looked on his reflection in the pool’s surface saw not his own face, but a reflection of the future – a glimpse of his final, mortal fate.
There are footsteps in the corridor. Joanna listens as he walks past – his pace measured, steady, familiar – and follows the sound, letting it lead her into the east wing of the house. Up a narrow staircase and down a long hallway, to the open door of the little white room where Joanna Watson sleeps.
Long fingers circle her left wrist, lifting her hand. “They bound you while you were unconscious. Not tightly enough to cut off circulation, but the skin’s still raw where the tension in your arms pulled against the plastic.” He returns her hand to her side, and his fingers slip away. “You lost your temper with him. What did he say?”
It sounds like the truth. Sherlock frowns, but she can tell that he believes her. He looks up at the underside of the table. “E. Farmer,” he says. “In defiance.”
Sherlock is already gone the next morning when Joanna leaves the flat. Which is just as well, really, considering what he’d think of her destination.
“People are idiots.” He stands and walks to her, stopping when the tips of his shoes touch the towel. He towers above her, black trousers and belt and white shirt with the sleeves rolled to the elbows – his only concession to the warmth of the day. He looks ready for a fight. “How did you know about my violin?”
,” Sherlock’s shoes say, storming into the kitchen. “Find a couple of chalk stars drawn on the floorboards and suddenly the Keystone Kops turn into the Brothers bloody Grimm. Of all the backward, simple-minded—” He stops abruptly. “You’re under the table.”
but he was persuasive and she was still young enough to be persuaded, so when he stood her in front of the target and gave her the gun, Joanna raised it and fired.
He laughs, delighted. “Oh, much better. This is what I like to hear. You, Doctor Watson, are my most-improved hostage of the week.” He raises the bottle to her in a mock toast and downs the rest of the water. He drops the bottle to the carpeted floor, empty. “You deserve a reward, don’t you? I’ve never kept pets for long, but even I know that a good doggie gets a treat.” Moriarty takes the book from the seat beside him and opens it to a page marked by a withered silk ribbon. He spreads the book over his lap, brushing his fingers over dense lines of narrow script that turn the pages black in the low light. “All those books burned, decades worth of research and study, and the one thing she most wanted to keep from me was charmed against fire.” He looks up, a quiet smile in his eyes. “Sounds a little like fate, doesn’t it?”
Gran watches her carefully, blue eyes sharp. “That may be true, or it may not. Either way, it will make no particular difference to me.”
“Shut up.” He sets her down on the bed entirely too gently, her back against the headboard and the blankets tucked around her hips. His expression is anything but gentle. “You’re an idiot.”
Then his father makes a sharp gesture – punctuation for sharp words she cannot hear –and the boy flinches.
The table was a tree once, and it remembers – remembers roots and bark and reaching branches, moss and ivy and soil and light. Joanna remembers with it, remembers pushing deep into the earth and drinking her fill as spring rose each morning and winter fell each night, as leaves bloomed and withered and bloomed again. Remembers snowbound sleep, and the sky.
” The song fades into a hum again, one melody shifting into another as her mind wanders. Her footsteps move away, and Joanna hears the snick of a door closing behind her.
is the book’s last story. Joanna sinks down to sit on a nearby steamer trunk, turning past brittle pages filled with animals that speak and murdered children who sing, men built from river clay and thieves who fear the dark. Stories that change the shape of the world.
“And if that’s true,” he says, “if that’s true, then we’ve been here before, just like this. I’ve sat in this chair and said the words I’m saying now, and if time is a circle I’ll say them again, trapped in an infinite loop of this pointless, self-pitying, metaphysic
“His heart’s stopped.” She pushes past him and drops to her knees at Boyle’s side. He has no pulse. He isn’t breathing. “Sherlock, your mobile. We need emergency services.” She starts chest compressions, the rhythm instinctual, automatic. She breathes into his slack, bloody mouth and lets her mind go blank.
She kicks hard to the surface, sucks in a single smoke-filled breath and dives again. An arm hooked around his chest and she drags the dead weight of him up to the air, breaking the surface with a gasp. Sherlock’s head slumps forward, his hair dark in his eyes. He isn’t breathing.
“Harry’s locked it,” Joanna says, a little breathless. “Gran, can I have the key? I left a book up there, and I need it for school.”
Gran had disapproved of witches who used magic when a mundane solution would do just as well. She’d called them wasteful, self-indulgent, and Joanna never had any reason to doubt her – her grandmother was the only other proper witch she’d ever met.
A billow of smoke escapes over their heads. Sherlock braces Mrs Hudson by the shoulders as she coughs the burning air from her lungs. Her body shakes with the effort, and grey tears stream down both their faces, stained with smoke. The wards condense around them, keeping them from the flames even as the doorway begins to blacken and char.
Joanna pushes the window drape aside and looks down at the stranger again. She can’t remember the last time anyone but the postman came to the house; there’s almost something surreal in the sight of him, just standing there. Waiting. “If he’s a salesman, he isn’t a very good one. He isn’t carrying a case.”
Thistles grow up from between her toes and twine about her legs, drawing pinpricks of blood where they scratch her bare skin.
Joanna beams up at her. “But I need my thumb, Gran. I use it for thumb-things.” To illustrate she wiggles the digit in question, ignoring the sting of pain in her palm. “See? Thumb-tastic.”
When she returns to the room he’s still sitting on the bed, shirtless and moon pale even in the warm light of the bedside lamp. She moves close, until her knees touch his. “I’ll have to palpate the area around the bruise. It’s going to be painful.”
The assistant frowns, still staring through her Blackberry. “Certainly. What little magical control she once learnt she’s clearly forgotten.”
, she thinks, stepping carefully over the threshold, her eyes on the satchel. Datura is common enough, but no one sane would think it a cheery scent to add to a home decoration. Every part of the plant is poisonous, often fatally so, and it’s used only in the most desperate and dangerous of charms.
Sherlock’s hand follows the curve of her spine, sliding down until his palm rests in the small of her back. “Adrenaline,” he says. His voice is low, as though he isn’t speaking to her at all. “Addictive variation on an acute stress response. Norepinephrine, dopamine, serotonin—”
, Joanna wants to say, but then she is sinking again, slipping down through the pillows and mattress and bed and deep into the waiting water.
Boyle shakes his head. His nose is already beginning to purple; she’d cracked him in the face with her elbow during the fight. The sleeve of her shirt is wet with his blood. “You wouldn’t,” he says. “You wouldn’t help me.”
He must expect her to deny it. Instead she smiles at him, showing teeth. “And you killed Peter Barrow.”
She copies the sigils from her grandmother’s book, tracing and retracing each curve and line until her fingers ache. She writes sigils for safety and strength to hide in the lining of his jackets, charms for speed and sure-footedness to secret beneath the soles of his shoes. She sews anonymity into his disguises, and shadows into the dark wool of his coat.
Joanna chuckles, looking away. There’s little humour in the sound. “Well, then,” she says, “I suppose it’s a good thing I’ve plenty to spare.”
can’t be that dim,” and they’re off. Lestrade steps in the middle to referee, and Joanna tunes them out.
Joanna reaches over and drags a grey wool skirt out of the dry cleaning bag. It crackles with static. “Must have been Moran, then.”
“He doesn’t,” Adrienne says, and walks off down the corridor, phone already at her ear. “Now stop stalling and open the damned door.” Her heels click in quick percussion against the concrete, and Joanna listens as the sound of her footsteps fades.
“I see,” Alice says. She taps a button on her phone and lifts it to her ear. Mycroft answers immediately. “You’ll want me at the scene,” she says. “I’ll return as soon as the flat’s secured.” There’s a pause as Mycroft replies. “Yes, sir.” She rings off.
