Eventually, Steve drew back, breathing heavily. Tony licked his lips and took a deep breath, relieved to find he hadn’t dumped his coffee all over the bed. Steve sat smiling at him. After a moment, he cleared his throat.
“As a submissive approaches their limits, a skilled dominant watches them closely.  The submissive will typically become increasingly tense.  Their breathing will become tighter and more labored. Their muscles will grow more rigid.  A good dominant backs of before the submissive calls their safeword.” (53-4).
Thanks so much for reading!  I'm so excited to be back to writing.  Another chapter in less than a month?  (Ok, that's still slow, but good for me! :)
Bruce looked at Steve apologetically.   “Ah.  Timer.  Best get back to the lab.”  He picked up his bowl.  “I’ll finish this in there.”  He glanced around as if just noticing something.  “Tony skipping lunch again?”
“Look at me, baby,” Tony ordered, voice quiet.  Steve tipped his head back to meet Tony’s eyes.  “Beautiful,” Tony murmured.
“You’re awful quiet,” Steve murmured softly after a few moments, leaning down to Tony as Clint rehashed his old critique of Legolas’s absurd technique.  “You ok?”
There he was, Captain America in all his Domly Dom glory, puffed up with righteous indignation. And, yep, his voice had carried and a little clutch of party-goers were turning their attention. Jesus. Rogers had probably run across the ballroom. (Ugh.)
Steve smiled. Tony slowly began to unwrap the tape, layer by layer to reveal Steve’s hands. They were large—so much larger than Tony’s—soft and smooth, but strong. It felt good to have Steve’s hand in his, to do this small thing for him. Tony felt more breathless than he should, just unwrapping his lover’s hands, winding some tape. The first hints of a blush tingled on his cheeks.
He'd called SHIELD to see if they had any use for him and Hill had replied, a little impatiently, that he could check the roster online to see when he was required and did he need someone to go over the SHEILD website with him
,” Tony said and it came out a little strangled.  He grabbed Steve’s hand to pull him closer as he leaned over, reaching out to touch Steve’s cheek, unsure what to say, but needing to kiss Steve, to

“So,” Natasha said after a few moments, with a sly smile, “I bet you’re excited about J. J. Adams’ new
“Hardly,” Tony drawled, then realized he didn’t have a single follow up quip. Luckily, Steve cut in.
“Right. I remember.” Tony turned his attention to his right. “Okay, Katie, hit me. What have you two cooked up?”
Steve shuffled on his feet then seemed to push his awkwardness away.  He threw back his shoulders (does he know he does that?) and said more confidently, though still quietly:  “I like sleeping with you and waking up with you, Tony.  So when you decide to get some rest, if you’d like to do it in my room, with me, you’re always welcome.”  He smiled.
Tony’s mind leapt ahead to imagine what it would be like once Steve was ready to fuck him—that gorgeous cock, not just against his hip, but deep inside, hammering into him. Feeling spread open, taken,
Steve herded Tony easily from the elevator and down the hall to his bedroom. Tony shuffled along heavily, half-clinging to Steve's side, making no protest at his lover's firm grip around his waist. Steve wondered if Tony might fall without him.
“Good morning, Tony.” Steve said the words, soft and intent, like they were code for something more profound and he just keep
“Sweetheart?” Steve said, “I need you to tell me your safeword.”  He squeezed Tony’s wrists.  “Answer me.”
“Yep! You’re in for a treat,” Tony began, but now Leila was striding down the hall to greet them. Her hair was pulled back in a French braid. Her crisply pressed, plum colored blouse matched her lipstick.
) What was Tony supposed to think after that?  (I told him what I wanted sexually before I even said I loved him!  What the hell’s the matter with me?) Steve’s heart rate was climbing.  (Does he think I’m using him?  That we’re together because there’s nobody else I could trust to tie me up?)  Steve shook his head.  (No, he can’t think that.  He
(Ah! His daughter. Somehow, Tony had assumed she’d be another towering Domme . . .) Tony looked at them, father and daughter, Dom and sub and felt a certain pleasure that Tyrone had introduced her as
As Bruce and Steve chattered about food, and everyone served their plates, Tony couldn’t quite shake the feeling that everything maybe wasn’t quite fine after all.
“Yeah,” Clint said, eager to sound conciliatory.  “And lots of stuff has changed.  Socially and stuff.  I get it—things were different back in the day.  But we’re pals, right?  So, I wanna give you some advice.”
Pepper’s mouth went tight. “One-hundred and ninety.” She paused then added, “Over half of them SHIELD agents, local law enforcement, first responders, and the National Guard. The rest were bystanders.”
“If I make a joke about the size of your endowment, will I get myself spanked?” Tony asked with a smile.
“I just thought, when you left that I’d crossed a line.” Steve reached up to fiddle with his bow tie then stopped short. He put his hands in his pockets. “I hope you’d tell me if—“
Tony seemed to be waiting for a reply, so Steve forced out the totally insufficient words: “I’ll see you then.” Tony just nodded and sauntered to the elevator, coffee maker cradled in his arms.
, assault in progress, assailant is a Caucasian male Dom, 6’2 wearing—‘ but the guy doesn’t want you to finish describing him, so he lets me go and tackles you. He knocks the phone out of your hand and you’re trying to fight him now, but the odds aren’t in your favor. I jump in there, attacking from behind, and by the time the police show up the two of us have fought him off together.”
“Sir, I'll need you to fill these out--” she waved a folder at him, “and enter your biometrics on the pad.”
“Yes, but it’s the one that’s most directly under the power of our government. So I’ve written to my representatives to suggest a bill that would provide additional funding for the VA to assist veterans with PTSD.”
Tony’d let Pepper rant her way through a stiff double scotch then, when her familial duties drew her away, hung up and rejoined his team. They had assembled in the living room to drink Natasha’s poinsettia cocktails and wait for Steve. Not that they
“I’m glad you did—but I’d very much like a repeat.” Tony gave a sly grin and said in a sultry tone, “How ‘bout you finish that omelet, soldier, then carry me back to bed and strip me again?”
“Please say you were cool about it,” Tony said. “It’s good she takes care of her friends! That’s a good thing.”
Steve bit his lip, looking flummoxed, his ears positively red. And for a guy who’d been so beautifully in control twenty minutes ago, he was looking pretty lost now.  It wasn’t exactly sexy, but it was terribly, achingly sweet.
Tony strode inside and the doors slammed closed behind him.  Never one to back down from a challenge, Tony let his fur cloak fall to the floor as he approached, eyes demurely fastened on the floor. He heard the king gasp.
“Absolutely not,” Tony cut in. “It’s too cold. Also, I have drivers on staff. What’s the point if they don’t get to drive us? Francis might feel rejected!”
Tony’d never met a more ardent liberationist.  Tony sometimes suspected that Isaac despised his fellow Doms on principal, or at least mistrusted them.  (After what had happened to his baby sister, though, Tony could hardly blame him . . . Isaac had left Goldman Sachs for the Foundation two days after her funeral.)   Over the years Tony’d felt the occasional pang of regret that Isaac, like Rhodey, only dated women.
“Sure,” Steven said slowly. “I was a painter before I defeated the dragon; they elected me after that.  And, well, the last two kings had been eaten.”
Tony opened his mouth, then closed it again, struggling to find the right words for the moment: to reassure Steve that he’d never hold his inexperience against him; that it was the most loved he’d ever felt in a scene; that he’d honestly forgotten Steve came too fast and it was sort of adorable anyway. But Tony’s brain was still sleep-muddled without coffee.
“Tony?” Pep repeated softly. He hated to see her nervous—it made him worry what she might say next. “Would you like me to— I mean, could I hold you?”
“Steve. Yeah, sure.” Tony paused, then added, fumbling around for one of the big coffee cups, “Still gonna call you Cap, though.”
Bruce poured his own cup and smiled at Steve.  “I don’t think it matters where you go, as long as you go together.  So just pick a place you’re comfortable with and don’t worry about it.  He’ll love it if he’s with you.  Ah,” Bruce gave him an embarrassed little smile, and an awkward pat on his hand.  “Well, that’s what I think.”
“Don’t forget to get some sleep though, ok?” Steve said, looking a little concerned. “Big day tomorrow. You need your rest.”
“Yep,” Tony said, leaning back into her embrace. “Except for the arms on Clint’s uniform. Sacrificed some strength to mobility—only 5.6:1, but feel how lightweight it is.”
“And I’m really glad we . . . talked . . . earlier,” Steve said.  “It was—”  He closed his eyes for a moment and took a breath.  “
Steve pulled back to look up at Tony through his lashes, but didn’t take his mouth entirely off Tony’s dick.  (Oh fuck!)  He paused, waiting for Tony to speak.
.  Maybe Star Trek too.  Order Chinese food, drink beer, eat on the couch—that kind of thing.”  Tony paused, glancing around the room.  “What do you think?”
“Oh!  That—“  Suddenly, there were tears in Steve’s eyes.  Tony reached out and took his hand; he gave it a squeeze and Steve squeezed back as he took a deep breath and found his voice.  “That was very kind of her.”
Steve groped helplessly, looking for the right words to express his horror and revulsion, the deep seated sense of
In the Mandarin above, Tony is trying to practice phrases he might use on a business trip.  It goes roughly like this:
“Seriously,” Tony said, tone savage, “the ‘whole Captain America thing’ and your big Domly Dom muscles are part of what slowed us down. I saw you as some macho orientationist meathead. I’d have liked Steve Rogers—5’1 and 99 pounds—Brooklyn artist or human rights lawyer or social worker just fine. Better even!”
“Of course not,” Tony said. “Since we have no previous experience with life in the public eye, we’ve given absolutely no consideration to the various complications, obstacles, and PR backlash we may face.”
As he pulled the bike into the Tower garage, Steve’s heart leapt.   Maybe tonight would be the night?
Huh.  Suddenly everything felt more complicated than it did before.  Steve bit his lip.  (Tony, come back!  It’s all so much easier when you’re here. . . )
Tony smiled and checked his rearview mirror. “Nah. If it were too much trouble, Leila’d have no qualms about telling me to piss off.”
Steve's stomach churned with dread. The guilt he'd felt over the past six days was no longer simmering-- it had positively boiled over.
Tony glared at the schematics and sketches spread before him. Wasn’t like him to be so indecisive, but--
Tony was nearly forty, for fuck’s sake! He oughtta be able to hold his liquor by now. (After all, he’d had lots of practice.) And for Steve who was, shit, like fifteen years younger, to be hauling him to bed . . . that was just ridiculous.
that and still pull away?)  He folded his trousers and put them on top of his shirt.  (Next time, I should just kiss Tony.  It’s the twenty-first century!  Nobody will care.  Right?)  Steve stared at his nice clothes, meticulously selected for their second date.  (Damn it!)  He slammed his fist down on the dresser.
As Tony's fingers worked Pepper's arches with firm, even pressure, his mind started to drift pleasantly.
“Veronica!” Tony said with a grin, turning to look up at her. She was six feet tall, even before donning her stilettos or piling her sumptuous braids high on her head; counting those, she was probably the tallest person in the room. Tonight she was sporting a stunning tuxedo with red piping and tails that accentuated her long limbs. Her crimson lipstick was brilliant against her dark skin and matched both shoes and piping.
“It was good to see you, Tony,” Pepper said.   “I’m in town for a few more days.  Then it’s DC, Chicago, San Francisco before I’m back to LA.”
“Um,” Tony said. “Not exactly, Cap. I think that other alien is just sort of . . . stretching itself out.”
“Did you just take our picture?” Tony asked. The man nodded, still taken aback, and Tony rushed on, “Yeah, okay, how much do you want to delete it? Name your price.”
“Mr. Alvarez!” Tony said with a polite smile.  “I don’t believe you’ve met my teammate and Dominant, Steve Rogers.”
“It’s very impressive,” Rogers said, taking in the granite counter tops and black leather upholstery.  “And very different.”  And Rogers was giving him that little smile again.
“I’m not sure if you heard me properly earlier,” Steve said after a few quiet moments.  “Thank you for the flowers.  They’re beautiful.”
Tony bowed his head and lifted his palms—presenting them to Steve again—and then couldn’t resist arching his back a bit more. (Showing off.)
Tony caught his breath.  There he was—big, blond, and beautiful—hovering on the threshold of Tony’s lab, actually
Steve’s ears turned bright red as he hopped away from Tony; Tony was sure his cheeks were no better off.  Bruce was looking at pretty much anything but them.
Tony saluted. “You know me so well.” A pause. “So, hey, should I have JARVIS call and set up an appointment?”
Sorry for the long hiatus!  Between setbacks at work and two rounds of health problems, I haven't had much time to write.  Thank you so much to everyone who has left me comments and encouragement.  You are wonderful.
Tony clutched his coffee in one hand and held the other up in surrender. “Not judging,” he protested. “Just saying. It’s not like you.”
was his response to comments on youtube, Tony was glad he hadn’t mentioned the really nasty stuff, like routine death threats. Or rape threats. Or the coverage of the Hanson trial. (Then again, maybe Cap had already found that stuff too.)
Clint’s fork came down to hard on his plate with a clatter that drew a (subtly) disapproving look from Natasha.
Tony had schematics to work on. (He always had at least six projects going at a time.). But he was curious . . .
Steve’s face was a mess—brow creased like he was in pain, bloodshot eyes staring distantly at the wall, his red face covered in tears and snot.  It really should have been gross, but somehow it wasn’t.  Tony reached to the nightstand for a tissue and swabbed awkwardly at Steve’s nose and upper lip, cleaning him up as best he could.  Steve closed his eyes, and tipped his head down, away from Tony’s sight, cheek still pressed to Tony’s chest.
. . . . . . . . . . . . .. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
Tony looked between the plate, piled high with a super soldier serving size, and then to his schematics and back. He blinked.
“What do you want, Tony?” Steve asked in a rough whisper.  He squeezed the back of Tony’s neck and pulled a little on the ropes. “Do you want me to mark you?  Want my mark on your skin?”
“It was no trouble,” Rogers said.  “And now, I should leave you gentlemen to your work.”  He bowed to Tony, then paused and asked, his voice pitched only for Tony, “Mr. Stark? Would you really like donuts?”
or now?”, but Tony swallowed the words down unsaid--looking at Rogers’ expression, he was pretty sure he knew the answer. He could imagine Rogers’ sketches with surprising vividness: a street in Brooklyn, teaming with long skirts and sharp fedoras; wrought iron streetlights and boxy-looking trolley cars; Peggy Carter and The Howling Commandoes.
“Of course! You had my best interests at heart, right?” Tony asked bitterly.  “A Domme clearly knows what I need better than I do.  Why bother so much as telling me what it was before injecting me, let alone asking?”  Tony shook his head.  “We’re done here.  You’ve been warned.”  He gave her a blinding smile.  “Welcome to Stark Tower!” he exclaimed, and turned to walk away.
, truly I am, about jumping to the wrong conclusion, but if Steve makes you happy then I’m happy for you and I want to hear anything you want to tell me.”
“Yes?” Tony said it like a question, but Rogers took it for a real answer and smiled at him.  He broke six eggs carefully and whisked them with a fork.  Added salt and pepper.  Bruce must have showed him around—he knew more about Tony’s spices than Tony did.  Rogers put four slices of bread in the toaster.  Tony just sat at the kitchen counter and watched the whole thing.
Steve looked over again as if to confirm Tony was still listening; Tony nodded and took a sip of his coffee. Steve smiled.
When Steve and Tony emerged from the master bedroom (only slightly rumpled), Pepper had joined the others in the living room and somebody had opened a bottle of red wine.
“—I know who you are,” Tony interrupted, earning the barest hint of a frown.  Tony hesitated a moment before he reluctantly gave Rogers his hand; the man’s handshake was gentle, just a warm little pressure.  Tony wasn’t sure if he should be relieved (so many people liked to crush his hand in a shallow attempt at Dominance) or insulted (I’m not THAT fragile, mere mortal and sub though I may be).
“Steve, I want to be your dom.  I had no idea how badly I wanted this until you slid to your knees and looked up at me, telling me you want to surrender.  You’re so beautiful, so perfect like this.  I don’t just say that I love seeing you kneeling for me, tied up, desperate, obeying my commands because it’s what a dom should do.  I really love it.”
Pepper had woken up to chat with Rhodey on the couch. Natasha and Clint were on the loveseat having a tete-a-tete while Bruce, Mrs. Rhodes, and Steve stood in the kitchen.
“JARVIS?” Steve said to the ceiling. “Could you please tell the team that Tony and I are cooking breakfast for them and ask them to please join us?”
“Yeah.” Tony sighed.  “I hate that I can’t figure it out and, sure, I don’t have the full data, but I can’t just
The swipes of Tony’s tongue were soft but overwhelming on his over-sensitive cock.  Steve shivered and stared.  The sight of Tony’s pink tongue lapping at his come seemed almost to filthy-beautiful to be real.  When Tony eased his fingers slowly from Steve’s body, it left a strange open, empty feeling that filled him with longing.
“I’m used to that,” Rogers answered, then added with a little smile, “and who’s to say I won’t surprise you?”
“Do you maybe—Uh. How would you feel about telling the team we’re dating? I mean—that we have been on a few dates?”
“Sorry! Shit, just a sec!” Tony cried, fumbling through his suit from last night until he found his wallet. He tossed it to Steve who caught it one-handed (without spilling his coffee).
Steve’s breathing was speeding, steadily faster and faster. Tony wanted to drive him wild, needed to show how badly he wanted Steve to have him.
“You are NOT hanging a Picasso in a kitchen full of bacon grease, smoke, and steam,” Steve said. He crossed his arms for emphasis. “It belongs in a museum.”
Tony’d known Steve was strong. Strong and graceful, but he’d never seen him like this before, not when he had the luxury of standing there to watch.
And, yep, that gave him a little more to work with.  Tony skimmed over the list and the various edits and changes, taking in the patterns, looking for the underlying connections and governing systems and associations.
Cap nodded and returned his wallet to his pocket. “All right,” he said, smiling again. “I’d like that. Thanks, Tony.”
A moment later Tony was encircled by huge projections: Steve’s spreadsheet, various annotated ebooks, shopping carts at JT’s Storeroom and Mr. S Leather, and of course his own notes.  He yawned.
Bruce gave Rogers and Tony a shaky wave and followed the ninjas out.  (His eyes were looking a bit green, but he seemed to be weathering their training pretty well.)
“Rare teas,” Bruce said, holding up one of the neat little packets. “Including ‘Iron Goddess of Mercy’ and ‘Monkey Picked Oolang.’ Really wonderful.”
Tony sent Dummy back to his charging station, threw out the now empty cartons of Chinese take-out, and skimmed over his Stark Industries email, then headed up to the common room.
Bruce had gone to bed a few hours ago, but the rest of the team had stayed up drinking around the Christmas tree.
“It’s a line from a Renaissance poem by John Donne,” Steve explained. “He wakes up with his submissive and fantasizes about leaving the world because the whole world is contained in his beloved. I thought it was beautiful.” A pause, then Steve grinned. “And when I was thirteen Donne’s ‘To His Submissive Going to Bed’ was pretty racy reading material for me, you know.”
Rogers managed to get him in an upright lock the next three times, but on the fourth attempt Tony managed to pivot then drop. He jerked the Captain a little off balance as he fell to the mat, but Rogers didn’t loosen his grasp. Tony rolled between his legs and got ready to knee him in the groin. (What? The guy had his wrist—they weren’t playing Marquise of Queensbury anymore.) No luck. Rogers saw that coming and drew his knees together, blocking the kick, then easily knocked Tony’s leg out of the way.
“And, hey, tell you what,” Tony said, bumping his shoulder into Steve’s and aiming for casual, “next time I have a nightmare, I’ll wake you up and you can return the favor.”
Tony caught Steve’s hand and pressed it to his chest, so he could feel the outline of the dogtags under Tony’s tux.
Running on instinct, Tony crossed the room to stand beside the couch. Steve looked up, maybe a little surprised, but mostly he just seemed exhausted. Tony laid a hand on his shoulder and asked again, wishing he could come up with something better to say, “Steve? Are you sure you’re okay?”
“Dr. Banner, I’m sorry to start this conversation under these circumstances.  I trust by now you’ve read the briefing package I gave you on the Avengers.”
This story is such a source of comfort to me and so are all of you.  K.  Gonna stop before I get gushy.  THANK YOU SO MUCH!
“Tony, you promised me you wouldn’t do this anymore!” Jackie stepped forward to peer at Tony, nimble despite the clunky heels. “Tony, baby, the next time you’re feeling low, you
Tony got up to fetch his wine glass from the counter.  Rogers got to his feet.  He remained standing until Tony sat back down and then gave Tony this sidelong little glance, like maybe he thought Tony’d be pleased. Tony bit his tongue.
“Leap of faith, Hawk!” Tony called getting in position.  Clint jumped from his ledge just as it was overwhelmed with giant digital spiders.  Tony caught his chest harness in one gauntlet and flew him across the gym to the next ledge.
When the elevator doors opened, Rogers was waiting, barefoot and dressed in his navy blue sweat suit. (
“You mean, that he isn’t--”  Rhodey waved a hand, unwilling to finish the sentence.  Tony gave a wry smirk.
“Yeah,” Tony said. “It was a great interview, Steve. You set up everything for the gala and you spoke out about something really important.” Tony licked his lips. “I love you.”
Tony tore his mouth away from Steve’s and turned to bite down on the tender spot where his neck met his shoulder.  Steve cried out as Tony nipped and sucked at it.  (It’s going to bruise. . . He’s leaving a mark!)  A fresh wave of arousal swept through him and Steve let out a hoarse moan.  Tony thrust his fingers in a little harder.
(Curled up in an armchair in the Tower, catching up on world history, reading about “gay rights” . . .  It had felt as remote and unreal as Asgard. . . )
“And either way, he doesn’t speak for me.”  Tony wouldn’t look up.  Bruce sighed, “Tony, I’d never forgive myself if I hurt you.  I just want to be sure you get to the armor.”
“Pep, you’ve lost me.”  Tony squinted at the screen where Pepper was giving him this funny smile.  “Why wouldn’t I want to go?  I mean, besides the obvious ‘high society events are tedious and self-congratulatory’?”
“I’ll just carry these, shall I, buttercup?”  Tony asked, holding up their drinks with a little smirk.
“No!” Steve said, grabbing Tony’s wrist. He took a deep breath and shook his head, letting go of Tony abruptly. “Sorry. Just, it’s too cold out. It’s fine. We’re fine here.”
Tony emerged on Thursday. He headed up to the common room and didn’t realize he’d been expecting to find Steve there until he was disappointed. Tony made a sandwich and lingered a while before going back to the workshop, emerging from time to time to raid the refrigerator. When Tony didn’t run into Steve or anyone else around the Tower all day, he had JARVIS ask Steve if he wanted to watch
“We agreed,” Steve said, clearly tired of repeating the point, “that Bruce—and then the Hulk— should see us cooperating more first.”
.  I . . . just want you to be safe and happy.  I couldn’t bear to see you get hurt.  You know that.”
The situation in Central Park was less than ideal. The portal was floating some eighty feet in the air—high enough that it was in plain sight for myriad rubbernecking tourists even SHIELD was having trouble keeping away. As far as Tony could tell, they were trying to tread a fine line between “cause mass hysteria” and “no, seriously, you need to get out of here.” You’d think the sight of seventy-five heavily armed people in Kevlar would do it, but apparently nope. And, oh, goody. News crews. (Shit. Better give Katie and Michael a heads up . . .)
“Okay, good. Good! We’re brainstorming! You’re right,” Bruce said, voice frantic, “So, it has to be an injection—direct into the—“
, you know? So then I thought, maybe just let you pick out whatever you want from the art I have in storage--we could finally hang that Cezanne or the Pollack I got last year? Maybe find a place for it in your suite or something?”
“Nope,” Tony agreed abandoning his plate and hopping down from his bar stool.  “I’m one of those debauched atheists the nuns warned you about.  Godless sinner all around.”  Tony said it cheerfully, with a big smile.  “Thanks for breakfast,” he added, “Enjoy your church thing.”
Tony pressed a little kiss to Mrs. Rhodes' cheek on the way past her. “I think it’s time to get some air,” he announced to the room at large, in a casual tone.
Steve’s breath hitched.  Tony pulled him down for a kiss, slow and gentle, and Steve felt warm and content, more reassured than he’d imagined.  (My eyes.  Thank you.  I’m glad.  They’re
“Sure, Tony.  I can pick a codeword if you want.”  (And it’s clear that Steve doesn’t get it, doesn’t really understand, but he’s happy to do it anyway and I guess that’s enough for now.)
“And we don’t have to stop at the Met!” Tony enthused. “We could fly to Paris! Or Florence if you want! Go to the Louvre or the Uffizi or wherever else!”
Hope you enjoyed it!  As ever, comments are cherished. (And, yeah, I remain weirdly obsessed with hearing which parts / lines you liked best / hit hardest / etc...)
“Tony!” Steve crashed to his knees beside Tony, landing so hard the dishes rattled in the kitchen. “Oh Christ! I’m sorry. I--” He looked stricken. “Are you all right?”
While he cooked Rogers hummed something slow, regular, and plodding.  It sounded like the kind of thing you’d hear in Church.  Tony blinked.  Oh right.  Church. This was Sunday brunch.  Post-Church.  Tony sipped his coffee, and looked around the counter at the rest of the team as they picked up their conversation and ate their pancakes and their omelets. Weird.
“I want to suck your cock . . . want you to fuck my face until you come and make me swallow it all. Tony, I—”  He’d run out of words.  “Tony, please?”
Tony moved under him, eager to urge Steve on, but his Dom pinned him down, holding him helpless, immobile.
Steve was sure Tony’d been close-- he let out a disappointed little sound.  (Why didn’t you come?  I want you to .  . .) Tony was flushed and panting, wild-eyed as he looked at Steve, studying him again.   Tony held his hair tight with his left hand and caressed Steve’s face lightly with his right.  When he ran his fingers across Steve’s lips, Steve opened his mouth to pull them inside and suck.  Tony’s breath hitched.
Rogers arrived at 9 am sharp, with a large army duffle slung over his shoulder, an artist’s portfolio obviously containing his shield, and one medium-sized cardboard box carried in his arms.  He stood in the lobby looking a little wide-eyed, making small talk with Darla at the front desk.
Steve cleared his throat. “So,” he said, “I was thinking we could just spend the evening relaxing, maybe watch the next episode of
“Tony, no. I mean it,” Pepper said firmly. “You have training. I know this time at the ranch is important for your team.”
If you enjoy this, do consider letting me know...  Comments are cherished, adored, and feed the muse!
Rogers nodded and smiled, pulling food from the fridge. They shared the kitchen in comfortable silence while Cap prepared Sandwiches of Reconciliation.
They stood silently for a moment, then Tony fixed himself a tonic water with a slice of lime. (No gin.) He turned abruptly, eyes narrowed, and opened his mouth—then shut it again with a frown.
Bruce waved him off.  “Nah, then wasn’t the time.”  He shrugged.  “The pancakes were delicious, though.”  He smiled.  “Thanks for that.”
“Easy there, babe,” Tony said, tone amused.  (Oops.  Pulled a little too hard…)  Steve eased his grip, but continued stroking Tony’s back urgently and then (feeling bold) slid a hand down to the curve of his ass.  Steve could feel Tony’s cock against his hip-- he was hard again.  Steve moaned into Tony’s mouth and kissed him rough and frantic until he had to break away for air.  (
“Nah,” Tony shook his head and let out a little snort.  He waved his hand.  “I’m the one who got it wrong.  Rhodey said it was fine and to leave you alone.  That you were just a soldier having a bad day and it had nothing to do with us.”
“Ah!”  Steve cried out again, as Tony brought his hand into play too, twisting and squeezing, moving faster and faster, urging him on.
Tony nodded emphatically and leaned up for a kiss.  Steve obliged him for a moment then stepped away to sit down on the edge of the bed.  He was looking at Tony again and, yeah, that was clearly A Thing for Steve. Tony’s cock gave an eager twitch.
“You really are a good guy, aren’t you?” Tony said softly. It was the sort of thing he’d usually say snidely or at least half as a joke, but tonight alone in the gym with Rogers it was a gentle observation.
“Tony,” Steve murmured. He reached up to caress Tony’s cheek with a large warm hand, then tipped Tony’s chin up. Tony’s eyelids fluttered up and he found himself looking into Steve’s wide blue eyes, their faces close together.
Ta-da!  There it is. Finally.  FINALLY! I really hope you liked it.  Uh, maybe let me know?  Favorite bits?  Stuff that surprised you (in a good way)?  Comments are love!
Tony settled on the edge of the couch.  “Besides, that ad told you all you need to know: buy this car and you’ll attract sexy subs!”
Steve drained the entire bottle of water, refilled it at the fountain, and started back towards the unbreakable bag. He sometimes felt like Sisyphus with that thing. (Ugh.) It was great to have a bag he couldn't destroy, but it was maddening too. (Especially today.) He changed his mind halfway across the gym and sat down on the bench.
Tony didn't elaborate and Pepper didn't press him.  She knew in moments like these Tony'd be more open than usual, but he didn't like to talk.  When he was . . .
“Well, I was wondering if I could take you on a date Saturday night.  We’d have to get an early dinner.  Or, well, maybe a very late one.”
Captain America pulled himself to his feet, a little heavily but not shaky. He wiped his shield off on the grass, leaving behind a smear of blood and guts.
Tony took a sip of his scotch and nodded. “Yeah. I was going over some of the Foundation’s reports and it turns out we’re looking for a new trustee for the Stark Scholars Fund. Our mission is to support talented submissives in highly dominated fields, and I thought you might be interested.”
“Sweetheart, you don’t have to do some sort of strip tease or put on some sort of performance.  I just want to watch you take your clothes off.  Because I told you to.  Okay?”
“Yes, clearly,” Pepper said exasperated. “I’m meeting you there and it’s going to be huge for photo ops; I want to coordinate outfits. So what are you wearing?”
Tony shook his head and added, “I don’t need you to fight my battles because you’re a big strong Dom and I’m some sweet helpless little sub.”
“It’s just,” Bruce rubbed his brow. “I get snatches of it, sometimes, after--or maybe during? It’s weird.”
God, Tony hated this shit. If he made a scene it would be bad PR: “Tony Stark! Such a drama slut!” Tony had hoped to avoid TMZ, especially tonight—his first event as an Avenger. They were on the balcony, but the ballroom had a clear view of them.
“Yes, I realize that,” Rogers said.  “But I’d still like to look at it and speak to Fury on the subject.  If you’ll allow me, Mr. Stark.”
Tony stretched and rubbed his neck as he padded over to the elevator and sent it up towards the penthouse.  The floor indicators glowed as they passed.
into the wall—kissing passionately, rutting against each other, hard and frantic.  Instead he stood very still, trying not to fidget under Tony’s considering gaze.  It made Steve feel like an equation Tony was trying to solve, a schematic that wasn’t quite turning out as imagined.  Steve focused on the pressure around his wrist and tried to let it ground him.
Bruce nodded again. “Still, it's never fun to see him like this.” He stirred the pot serenely. “I'm glad I've left the obsessed, workaholic, self-destructive phase of my career long behind me.”
“Well,” Bruce said, taking off his glasses with a sigh. “None of these theories seem to be playing out.  And,” Bruce added with an amused little smile, “judging by how often you’ve checked the clock, I bet you’re hungry again.  Want to order Thai?”
“Mmmmm,” Steve mumbled groggily, nestling back in Tony’s embrace and rubbing his cheek against Tony’s arm.
“Yep!” Tony said it cheerfully and swung Steve’s hand as they walked after the others. He knocked his shoulder into Steve’s and added a little more softly, “Guess we’ve got quite a few firsts left to explore together.”
“I have to go back.” Rogers said apologetically. Tony didn’t know if he was relieved or disappointed.
Steve turned his attention back to the turkey, taking a weird looking giant eyedropper thing and dripping turkey juice all over the bird. (That’s ‘basting,’ right?)
“Should be ready in twenty minutes,” Steve said, checking the timer.  “So let’s start setting the table.  And, yes!  We’re eating at the table.  We have a guest and should eat like civilized humans.”
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . ..  . . . . . . . . . . .. . . . . . . . . . . . .. . . .  .. . . . . . . . . .. . . . .. . .
“I think it’s my duty to be ready if they do attack again. That’s what our team has been training for.”
Tony laughed. “Yeah, that sucked big time, so, I don’t know about anybody else, but I was thinking movie.” Tony glanced around hopefully. “Movie?”
“I think it’s a wonderful idea, however you set it up.”  Steve grinned. “I love that you’re so generous that your gift to me is really a gift to the city.”
Tony felt a sudden pain in his left big toe. (Ugh.) Start up dude was too intent on wooing Tony’s money to focus on dancing. Tony gave another gentle push to keep them from colliding with another couple.
know, but just watching him with you I was pretty sure there was something there, at least on his side. And I just thought, ‘Finally, a Dom worth Tony’s attention.’ Was just hopin’ you’d notice.”
“Get on your knees for me, baby,” Tony said, pushing him down.  (Yes!)  Steve whimpered.  “Good boy,” Tony said and caressed his cheek before grabbing his hair again.
“But you’d like that, right?” Steve asked, as if he couldn’t help himself and had to double-check. “Old fashioned date nights?”
Harry—(you couldn’t talk about mathematics so joyfully for so long without inviting first names)—nodded agreement.
It bothered Tony that Rhodey fretted about him like that, that Rhodey worried about some big Dom “trying to pull something” with him; but at the same time Tony was grateful and unexpectedly
“Oh for fuck’s sake!  If this is the thanks I get for flowers and shoes of gratitude, trust me, I’m learning my lesson.”  Pepper didn’t reply and after a moment Tony added softly, “Really, Pep.  I’m great.  I’ll see you tomorrow.  1pm?  Marseilles?”
Tony tried to moderate his tone, be a little less angry, a little less aggressive, but his blood was pumping fast and it wasn’t easy.  “Look, Rogers—you wanna be polite?  Fine.  I’m telling you: knock it off.  The door holding, pulling my chair, standing when I get up, bowing when you go. Just stop, okay?”
Tony swallowed. “But, maybe after we go to the ranch, if everything goes well, maybe then you could? Right?”
And it was good, really. Bruce wasn’t the sort to hold a grudge. (Probably.) And, despite popular opinion, Tony didn’t
), he couldn’t possibly have imagined talking to a member of his unit about wooing another man.  Bruce made it seem so
Something about that step, the little pause, the slope of his shoulders, and the way Rogers blinked all made Tony think that there was more to it than that.  It only made Tony more curious.
Tony realized with a rush of embarrassment just how completely Clint and Natasha had been pulling their punches and slowing their movements with him.
It was a column tie, the simplest tie in all of bondage.  One that even Tony could do it in his sleep and like most (though not all) subs he had little to no interest in tying other people up.  But Steve was giving it the rapt attention one expected for brain surgery, as he looped the rope around Tony’s wrist and his own fingers, brow furrowed biting his lip just a little.
Steve was still shuddering and jerking in Tony’s arms, his body wracked with sobs.  It was staggering how those movements—Steve, gasping and shuddering-- could look so similar to something joyful and erotic.  The similarities-- and contrasts-- seemed cruel.  Tony stroked Steve’s back with light fingertips.
Cautiously, tentatively, Steve kissed him back, tilting his head to the right angle. Tony hummed his approval.
They must have made quite a sight: Tony, naked and spent, on his knees; Steve, big and beautiful and fully clothed, towering above him, stretching Tony’s mouth with his dick.  (Mirrors.  Why didn’t he have mirrors anymore?)
But the longer Steve pressed kisses to Tony’s hair, murmuring little words of affection, and gently stroking him, the more it felt like this was concluding aftercare.  (But Steve hadn’t— Didn’t he want--? Wasn’t he still—? )
“That won’t be necessary, Mr. Stark,” she said briskly. “Eventually, you’ll need to give an interview, but--”
place (where they had to order fifty dishes to have enough food).  They were all great, and the owners were used to them.  But, well, those were all
“Come on over, Rogers,” Jerry said, patting the seat next to him. “Got a seat right here for you. I wanna hear this one direct!”
Tony wanted to poke and jab and jostle, but he didn’t know where it would hurt so none of his usual covers would work; he felt exposed and awkward as he took a step to lay his hand lightly on Rhodey’s shoulder.  (Not enough.)  Tony eased a little closer, arm going around Rhodey’s good side, crutch and all, for a gentle half-hug.  Rhodey smelled like that cheap aftershave Tony always complained about but Rhodey refused to give up.  Tony tipped his forehead against Rhodey’s shoulder and took a deep breath.
Then Pepper smiled, pulled her chair closer to his bedside, and resumed her report: “Rhodey caught you.” Her voice shook only slightly. “The portal was already closing when you came through, but you weren’t flying. You were falling. And Rhodey— Rhodey caught you.”
“Ah, of course,” Harry said, a little downcast. “Have a safe trip home. And, uh—“ Harry fumbled in his pocket. “My card. In case you’d like to get together sometime.”
“If I’m upset,” Steve mumbled, mind still a little hazy with arousal.  He shook his head to clear his thoughts.  This was important to Tony.  He answered more decisively:  “I use it to communicate distress to you quickly.”
“I’m flattered, really I am!” Tony said, tone snide. “But if you think that I can build a containment unit strong enough to withstand the Hulk
Steve kneeded his ass, pushing rough fingers against his crack through his trousers for a moment before ripping his pants open and touching bare flesh.
After a few moments, Steve calmed. He washed his hands and checked the time. 10:47. It wasn't that late, but all he wanted to do was curl up and go to bed. Steve sighed. It wouldn’t be the same without Tony. Steve hated to interrupt, but was tempted to go down and check on him. Steve had almost asked Rhodey if he stayed long enough to make sure Tony actually
Tony’d heard Margaret Macmillan was Tyrone’s right hand, and had been since he married her late in life; surely he hadn’t--
“Haven’t published, won’t publish.  Nobody gets my tech.  Well, not in this format anyway.  The StarkSafes have elements in common with J, but they’ve got IQs of 70 or 80 to JARVIS’s 140.”
Tony frowned. “Are there any particular problem areas?” Then he called out, “JARVIS, get me a screen with Cap’s suit, here.”  Tony slid the glowing blue screen over where Steve could see. “So, what’s the problem? Chafing? Impaired mobility?”
After a few minutes, Steve gave Tony a hard squeezed, then threw his shoulders back and stepped away.  The elevator doors opened.
Clint couldn’t help it--he laughed.  (Yeah.  That sounds just like Tony.) Steve frowned at him--(Seriously, Captain Dour?)-- but then what Nat said seemed to sink in and his lips twitched up too.  He even looked kinda proud for a moment before returning his attention to Nat.
After indulging Harry’s enthusiasm for erdgodic theory and talking up the Stark Scholars a bit more, Tony left the main bar to mingle, though he was feeling a bit weary of the whole thing. Luckily the band was on break, so nobody could ask him to dance. (He needed a break too.)
“Nope!” Tony said, looking tremendously pleased.  “It’s crash time.  I fixed the damn things.  Victory is mine!”
with a university degree. But Bruce didn't think it was silly. Bruce thought it was a good idea. He'd go talk to Natasha about sorting out some sort of cover identity and then talk to Tony about--
Their cab was ready and waiting as they crossed the Stark Industries’ lobby on the way to the street. Tony fussed with the top button of his coat and rearranged his scarf. (Fucking New York winter…) Steve got to the door first and held it open for Tony, head high and shoulders back; he seemed happily proud for a split second before hunching down and looking self-conscious. Tony was sorry to see the change.
When they reached Conference Room 22—Natasha got the door for the entire team—Fury, Hill, and an unknown Domme in a suit were already there waiting. Everyone exchanged bland greetings, then took their seats. (Tony pulled out his own chair, thank you very much.) Hill introduced the glossy looking Domme as “Melinda Alexis Carmichael, PR Consultant.”
“No!” Pepper shouted him down. “You’re refusing your pain killers and resisting sleep to stay glued to this thing and watch as the death count’s adjusted. You’re not allowed to punish yourself for things that: Were. Not. Your. Fault!”
Cathy Dworkin had given Tony shit about appointing a Dom CFO of a submissives’ advocacy foundation, but he’d shrugged it off.  Isaac Greenblatt was the best in the industry and if he wanted to give up a vast salary as CFO at Goldman Sachs to join the fight against orientationism, then Tony said let him.
“So, if the . . . Other Guy shows up, they probably can get away on their own. I just wanted to know somebody would make sure you get to the suit.”  Bruce stepped a little closer.  “Not just because I worry about you, which I do—I’m your friend, I’m allowed—but also because Iron Man is really best equipped to deal with the Other Guy. It’s the best strategy, ok? It wasn’t an insult.”
Steve looked confused, so Tony clarified, “Like global weirding—the better name for global warming, since it’s really all about the disruption of weather patterns, not a universal temperature increase.”
“Rather a dull party,” Belford said as they stepped onto the balcony. "I’m not sorry to step out for a while. Especially with you.”
Rogers looked incredulous. “I don’t care about PR,” he cried, outrage stamped on his face. “I thought you were in
“You have no taste,” Natasha told Clint, rolling her eyes again. “Steve, you’re an artist—why won’t you back me up?”
Thanks so much for reading this!  There will be more in this series at some point in the future.  I'm having fun writing Steve's POV for a change.  If you enjoyed this, I'd love to hear from you!  Comments are a delight. :)
The elevator doors parted to show Rhodey wearing a suit—one not made of metal—and carrying a large box, probably full of his mother’s cooking supplies. (She’d learned she couldn’t trust Tony to have obscure kitchen implements, or even the items she declared ‘standard.’) Rhodey was a solid foot taller than his mother, but she filled the space with sheer presence. Maryanne Rhodes was always poised, dressed with a simple elegance that needed no fancy designers to validate it. Clean lines, polished and precise: red blouse, white cardigan, black skirt.
Bruce spread his hands helplessly and made an apologetic grimace. “I know when to pick my battles? Sorry. Apparently, I’m totally transparent. Have some pizza.”
“You don’t *actually* want to hear all about that, surely? All the bla-bla-bla, how it all went to shit, the ins and outs, and all that.  You cannot possibly be interested.”
“Yeah.”  Tony stood staring at him.  (Ah, shit.  Awkward.)   Tony swallowed.  He took Steve by the hand.  “Come on, sweetheart.  Come sit on the bed with me, would ya?”
Steve's heart was pounding. No matter how loudly his mind screamed at him about eavesdropping he couldn't quite force himself to move forward or back. He bit his cheek and focused on breathing quietly in and out.
“Tony,” Clint said, hand landing heavily on Tony’s shoulder as he started to pursue.  “Let Nat do her thing.  She’s good at it and she’ll talk him down.  Just give Bruce some space.”
Tony snuck a look over at Steve.  There was something almost child-like about how intently he watched
“Good,” Tony said with an approving nod, leaning closer to the old motherboard. “Katie Winters is the best at SI, and that means
“May not have to after all, Cap,” Tony announced, watching as the readouts from the mini-orbiters fluctuated wildly. “Looks like it’s about to—“
“Cap doesn’t like that kind of language,” Nat scolded Clint with a teasing glance to Steve, who looked a little embarrassed.
When Rhodey’d first invited Tony over for Christmas that miserable winter after his parents died, he’d been about to accept until Rhodey got to describing all the glorious attractions: stockings, two trees, traditional cooking, church—quite a bit of church—and grandparents and uncles and aunties and a veritable horde of cousins. Just hearing about it had nearly sent teenage Tony into a social anxiety attack.
Steve shifted a little, hips hitching restlessly. He rubbed his cheek against the couch cushion and let out another breathy little sex murmur.
Tony stared at him for a few long moments, trying to get his thoughts in order. He was pretty sure that Rogers was actually holding his breath, waiting for Tony to react or say something.
Tony was about to speak when Steve rushed on: “But either way, I’m afraid I can’t. I don’t know how to dance. I’d just embarrass us both.”
The drink was sweet and heavy on Steve’s tongue, like honey and ripe fruit, the flavor lingering after he’d swallowed.  Steve licked his lips.  Tony smiled and reached over to the plate, then offered Steve a small piece of dark chocolate.  He let it melt on his tongue, the taste mingling deliciously with the drink.

“It was fine,” Rogers repeated blankly staring into the garbage at the entire omelet Tony’d just tossed.
Bob disappeared after thirty-seven minutes and, if anyone had doubted Tony’s volume and inventiveness in the field of swearing, they would doubt no longer. Seriously, it should be his seventh PhD.  Some of the SHIELD agents even looked
Tony glanced over at Bruce with a tentative smile. Organized religion made them both a little nervous, but Tony knew Mrs. Rhodes didn’t mean to make anybody uncomfortable and, well, everything she said was so earnest and nice Tony would have been kinda sorry to miss it. Bruce smiled back.
“I’m—I’m gonna loose it,” Bruce mumbled, shivering against the chest plate, “I’m more dangerous than they are. I can’t— I, Tony, I
As Steve started briskly back to Stark Tower humming “Joy to the World,” but little by little his pace slowed and he fell silent.  It was a beautiful night, clear and bright, the city glistening with Christmas lights far whiter than those he remembered.  It wasn’t a very long walk, but his feet dragged.
Ms. Potts examined his face intently.  The silence stretched between them. Steve wondered how long they’d just stand there.  At last Ms. Potts spoke: “You might try letting Tony be Tony. And leaving him alone.”
And, oh fuck, there it was—Steve’s shy, sweet little smile, with his head tilted down, the intimate one he only gave to Tony.  “Yeah,”  Steve said softly.  “Yeah, you do.”  He reached out to squeeze Tony’s hand and let it linger there for a few moments before pulling away and saying, “So, phasers on stun, huh?”
“They didn’t bite or scrape the skin,” Stevee said consideringly with a hint of a frown, “but it looks like the pressure might be enough to bruise.”
“Why not?” Tony asked. (Oh! Of course. Shy baby.) “Don’t worry—JARVIS can put the gym in lockdown. Nobody’ll come in.”
I really really hope you like this!  Any musings, curiosity, favorite moments? (I'm a bit out of my comfort zone, so I'd be extra glad to hear from you here...)
“Cool.  Right, well,” Tony rambled.  Seriously?  He was supposed to be smooth. “So, I’d better give you the tour.  Go ahead and set your stuff down.”
The man gave Tony a speculative look then asked, “They didn’t want to see Iron Man? You just the chauffeur?”
And earlier, Tony had sent him flowers!  Sure, it felt a little bit silly to be so elated by that, but . . . well, it was sweet.  Steve didn’t care what Tony said about clichés—it was romantic.  Roses were
Besides, he should have tried this sooner. He’d promised Rhodey he’d look after Cap and he hadn’t exactly been living up to his word.
She quirked an eyebrow. “You want to show Steve a movie in which a guardian angel shows a man what the world would be like if he hadn’t been around to live in it, but ends with him being restored to his loved ones and living happily ever after with them.”
Half an hour later, Clint slunk stealthlessly to the Christmas tree with a set of messily wrapped packages in his arms. Tony felt a wave of relief that he’d planned ahead with presents, even though nobody had actually
Steve  thought about visiting the gardens first, but wanted to get away from even the moderate street noise.  The plain, wooden double-doors were unlocked; it was during tour hours.
.) Even more distantly he tried to picture suggesting to Tony that they postpone sex until marriage.  Steve had to smother a laugh.
“Steve put his foot in his mouth—I don’t think he meant it the way it sounded,” Bruce said.  Tony snorted.
“They weren’t boring and they went well, but I’ll choose to interpret that as an expression of gratitude.”
sound suggestive or downright post-coital? Tony glared at the notepad and geared up for a final attempt:
Bruce blinked and looked back and forth between Steve and Tony a few times. (And, okay, so Dummy’d wanted to cover Steve with Tony’s lab blanket, and Tony didn’t want the bot to wake the guy up, so maybe
“Yes! No!”  Steve couldn’t keep up with Tony’s questions.  (Shit!)  “Wait.”  Steve shook his head to clear it.  “Wait.  Sorry, I—”  Steve paused, trying to put his thoughts in order.
“Nope! It’s fine! Just a side project. But you’re early, aren’t you? I thought we were meeting around lunchtime.”
“Feeling pretty useless like this, Iron Man!” Cap complained while Tony took out all the baddies.  “Here—I’m gonna jump!”
“You know, though,” Pepper followed up more seriously, “there’s nothing wrong with having an interest in fashion. You’re aware how I feel about my Louboutins.”
Tony snatched Clint up by the harness they (thankfully) hadn’t gotten rid of yet. “Where to?” Tony asked. Clint pointed to a high tree with a long outstretched branch; Tony maneuvered them carefully, firing repulsor shots as he went. Clint got three shots off in transit, but remained silent.
(Hardly a rousing, ‘Yes let’s get it on like bunnies!’ . . . Was this what they meant by “Catholic guilt?”)
Without really meaning to, Steve flipped forward to the section on pain play— (play?) —and felt bombarded:
(Thanks for the champagne from Katie; update on the Foundation renovations from Isaac; ‘congrats; sweet press conference’ from Rhodey; etc.)
Tony gave a manic grin and spread his arms like a carnival salesman: “Welcome to the future, Cap! There’s no place you can go that you won’t be tracked by someone.”
“Uh-huh,” Tony said, trying to pull away. He could hear the noise of the party just inside. They’d left the doors open behind them and Tony was glad of it. “Well,
“So, first, I guess I had to figure out that it really is okay to want another man—to want you.  After that,” Steve shrugged, “it wasn’t so hard to figure out the rest of it.”  Steve squeezed Tony’s hand.  “I’m not ashamed anymore, just angry at myself that I used to be.”  He looked rueful for a second, then squeezed Tony’s hand again and added, voice so earnest Tony’s throat felt tight: “Now, it just feels right.”
Katie gave him a little smile and shake of her head. “You took most of the challenge out of it. Saving New York is always good PR.”
Steve and Tony followed the boy (probably the owners’ son) to a small table, surrounded by floor cushions.  It was in the far corner of the restaurant, near the hearth.  There were a few young hipsters who stood out, but other than that the clientele looked mostly like middle aged Moroccans.  (And, yeah, 42 is NOT middle aged, thank you very much.)
Rogers took a cautious step forward, then paused, waiting to see if Tony’d take the opening. But Tony wasn’t stupid—his best shot at this was to use agility and speed, not rush a guy twice his size who had bulk and strength on his side. Rogers waited a little longer and Tony thought he saw a bit of approval on the man’s face as he realized that Tony wasn’t going to fall for it. (Headstrong, not foolish.)
“Yeah, yeah,” Rhodey said. “Fuckin’ paparazzi.”He rolled his eyes, but didn’t look especially annoyed. Not entirely anyway. Tony nearly snorted. (Just wait, Rhodey-bear. It’ll get old soon . . .)
“Come on, man,” Rhodey said coaxingly from the doorway. “You’ve been down here for ages. There’s pizza! And a movie. Something Natasha picked.” Rhodey made a face. “I had a few suggestions, but she just went stony faced and said the movie was already chosen.”
“Got it,” Tony said, not bothering to explain what he’d meant. JARVIS was way smarter than the StarkSafe and would be monitoring him the whole time from his cell phone, so it was kinda doubling up, but whatever.
Rogers leapt at Agent Dominick. Tom thought he was about to witness Captain America in action—swift and bloody action. But the Captain froze before laying hands on Dominick. He took a deep breath and hissed, “How
in an unplanned outpouring that had felt utterly unstoppable, like a dam breaking.  Just twelve days ago, in those sleek uncomfortable armchairs on the other side of this vast room.  (“It’s called open floor-plan, Capsicle.”)  And now Steve knew.  (Tony loves me.)  He’d risked everything and won.  (Thank God.)  It still didn’t feel entirely real.
He scrolled down and felt a little stab of pity at Rogers' first set of google searches: Peggy Carter, Bucky Barnes, D. D. Dugan, Howling Commandos, Howard Stark.  Tony Stark.
“Professor Ellis,” Steve said, holding out his hand.  They shook.  “Steve Rogers here.  I modelled for your life drawing course a few weeks ago.”
“Seriously? ‘Corresponding?’” Tony laughed. “You from the ‘40s now too? No, whatever—just tell me everything! Come on, Rhodey baby, spill!”
Steve swallowed thickly; Tony’s eyes flicked to his throat. He was giving Steve a considering look that made his insides squirm.
“Of course you do,” Tony said, unable to stop a smirking little smile from quirking up, “but you should still let me drive. We’ll take the Lotus.”
He snapped up the tablet by his bedside, turned down the volume, and flipped it on. Apparently Pepper had been preparing a brief for him on recent events, all while multi-tasking—corporate mergers wait for no man, nor woman, nor alien invasion apparently.
“I’m Sir James, Captain of the King’s Guard,” he said briskly.  “I’m to take you immediately to the King.”
“Not long after you modeled, a young woman—afraid I’ve forgotten the name!—came  in to look at some student work and show it to the collector she works for who sometimes acts as a patron to promising young artists. He liked young Mr. Winslow’s drawing from that class and purchased it directly, though sadly no additional patronage seems to be forthcoming thus far. But a few days later one of this young lady’s colleagues came by to reiterate the collector’s satisfaction with the work.  And with its subject.”
Rhodes rolled his eyes and turned towards Steve again with a wry smile, saying, “Tony may have some issues with authority, in case you hadn’t noticed.”
“Oh.  Right.”  Tony swallowed.  He glanced over at Pep—all curiosity, concern, and affection—then turned away.  “Well, I needed to talk to Steve about something important, really
Tony smiled sweetly. “I’m bugged. This entire conversation has been recorded on a remote server and, under Title III of the Submissives’ Protection Act, it is admissible evidence in court. Now get the fuck off me.”
“As a last resort?” Tony asked. “If we’re absolutely desperate and need to help you before someone comes to dire harm?”
“Anyway, Pep and I couldn’t believe they didn’t have a sit-down restaurant yet. Eventually found out that it was because they were having trouble with start-up capital and finding a space in such an expensive city and other morons eating their food hadn’t pounced on the investment opportunity. We did and they started Café Leila later that year.”
“Bruce? Tony?” Steve called from the front porch, a dish towel thrown over his shoulder. “You two wanna come in? Dinner’s almost ready.”
Rogers’ hair was perfectly combed and absurdly shiny.  His dockers were still terrible, but the white t-shirt stretched across his glorious chest left little to the imagination and more than made up for the dockers.  With his ridiculous muscle mass, he should have been lumbering and awkward, but Rogers moved with a certain easy grace that—

“Mr. Stark, it's an honor to meet you,” Lieutenant Johnson said briskly. She looked a bit like Pepper, only blonde and in a crisp navy uniform instead of a crisp navy suit.
Steve knew better than to try the workshop directly, but he was hoping he’d get lucky soon if he stayed near the coffee maker.  (It had worked last time. Sort of.)
Steve shook his head.  “Tony, I loved them.  And it wasn’t predictable.”  He looked down at the table.  “Nobody’s ever given me flowers before.”  Steve gave a little shrug, then looked up and added, “It was nice.”  Steve squeezed Tony’s hand.
There it was: slightly shaky, slightly grainy footage of him and Pepper bouncing and shaking around on the karaoke stage, singing:
Chapter dedicated to: noman, thatwhichyields, and phage with thanks for hand-holding and encouragement. :-)
Clint was stretched out on one of the long chairs reading a comic book, bag of chips at his side, and--
’ I tried to say that I love art, but wouldn’t presume to call myself an artist. Even with Gabe’s lessons, my French probably wasn’t up to the task, but he still got up and said ‘

interested.”  He added ruefully, “Even when I don’t entirely understand.”  He shrugged.  “I mean, I know I’d never be able to keep up with you and Bruce no matter what I did, but it
They lingered over coffee. The tables were mostly empty now and, over the course of their meal, the other diners had either kindly left them alone or failed to notice them entirely.
I'm really sorry I'm behind on answering comments--even if I don't always manage to write back, please know they mean the world to me (and I'll hopefully get back to you soon).
Steve flushed slightly and looked down and to the right, shy and bashful again, the very picture of submission.  He looked up at Tony from under his lashes with a hint of a hesitant smile as he nodded.  And then Tony couldn’t keep his hands to himself—he scooted closer and ran a hand through Steve’s hair.
Tony wasn’t stupid, though.  This was obviously another “team bonding” thing, but he could do that.  He was Iron Man. He could do anything.
Steve’s face fell slightly. “I, uh—no. Mother Superior suggested it, but, well, if I was gonna dress up I wanted to be St. Nicholas, not—“ Steve cleared his throat, then continued, “So I’m just going, you know, as myself. But I’ll bring the shield for the kids to pass around so they aren’t too disappointed.”
“Awesome! Good! Great.” Clint nodded effusively. (Huh. He was really worried?) “So, I’ll see you for burgers, yeah?”
Tom watched from the neighboring table as Vikram hurriedly moved to a new seat. The Captain cast him a questioning look as he went.
The liturgy washed over him and he sang happily with the multitude around him, starting to shake off the chill.  He couldn’t focus on the sermon (too many references he couldn’t understand), so instead he listed to himself the things he had to be grateful for.  (Thank you, Lord, for letting me continue to serve my country.  I’m so grateful that we were able to defeat the Chitauri, that we helped to protect New York and the rest of the world.  That we prevented so many casualties. . . sorry we couldn’t prevent them all.)  Steve felt a little guilty that he couldn’t make a longer list.
Tony was bathed in the blue glow of his floating schematics, surrounded entirely with charts, rows, columns, and notes. It was a huge amount of data. After all, a Master Contract was meant to be exhaustive.
Now's your chance to get some beautiful art from the very talented LePeru!  She is currently accepting commissions to help her through a bit of a tough time.  (http://leperu.livejournal.com/3038.html)  I've ordered a couple of illustrations for the Surrender series and am very excited! She's really, really amazing.  So, if there are any illustrations you've been longing to have, please consider helping her out.  (Not that I'm selfishly hoping for more Surrender art or anything.... yeah.  :-)
,” Steve wined, face burning.  Suddenly, he couldn’t find words or get enough air.  He closed his eyes.
Dummy wheeled up to Tony’s side, claw head swiveling. Tony reached out to pet him as he bumped his head lightly against Tony’s hip.
Happy Valentine's Day!  I hope you enjoyed this--and if you did you'll let me know?  Thoughts, musings, curiosity, favorite bits?  Kind comments are a valentine day gift to your sad stressed out writers!  :)
His heart sped a little and there was a hint of a tingle in his cheeks as he opened the wine and set it on the coffee table to breathe.
“Publically?” Tony asked. He’d meant it to come out angry and challenging, but somehow it sounded a little breathy and hopeful instead.  Goddamn it.
“No lasting damage. His tastes aren’t particularly extreme and he has exceptional control. As I said, he’s not by nature cruel.”
Pepper stroked his hand with soft little caresses; it seemed almost unconscious. The world still felt a little blurry, but Tony forced himself to focus.
Tony rolled over and pressed his face into the duvet. (Wait . . . why was he in the common room?)  Tony frowned.  (Steve?)
“And you won!” Jerry continued, still oblivious. “I can’t believe nobody told you about it. I guess Dom didn’t want you to have a chance to join the pool.” He laughed. “I mean, really, like there was any doubt Stark’d go belly up for the one and only Captain America.”
“No, I’m expressing myself badly,” Tony interrupted, frustrated. “I’d like to give it a try because—“
Tony’s finger slid deeper, caressing him inside, then pulled out to move in a slow circle around his rim then press in again.  Steve moaned and spread his legs a little wider, desperate for more.
Tony pressed his face into Steve’s hand and a long-lingering tear escaped his eye to slide down his cheek. Steve kissed him.
“Oh, that? Meh. Even my dream team can’t control the tabloids. Bla bla, Stark’s a slut, bla bla.” Tony rolled his eyes. “Either they’ll say I’m serving the Avengers as team whore and you’re all banging me, or that I’m a seductive little minx who has lured you all into my den of vice as my harem of Dominants.” Tony paused. “Actually, they’ll probably run one story, then the other—why choose?” Tony shrugged it off. “But, don’t let it get to you, Cap.”
“It wasn’t my idea,” Tony protested, digging his hands into his pockets.  “Bruce thought it would be good for team dynamics.”  Rogers blinked and looked around the apartment again.  “I’d have expected you to agree, quite frankly,” Tony added, feeling a bit put out.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
Tony took a deep breath.  He settled back to run through the evening again (and again and again), waiting for Steve to wake up.
Tony was sweaty and greasy-haired, stripped down to an old tank top that nearly showed the top of the arc reactor. (And surrounding scars.)
Tony got out of the car first, all his usual swagger on full display. He’d been working the red carpet for so long it hardly required thought. He smiled and waved and posed. Natasha sauntered out next, effortlessly fabulous in Vera Wang. Tony sped up slightly to make sure there wouldn’t be any pictures of them together—he didn’t want anyone to suggest he was her date. (And therefore that
Tony gasped. He felt unexpectedly lightheaded; all the blood seemed to be rushing from his brain to his cock.
Clint continued, with a loud snort, “Iron America romance? Seriously? I mean, fine, they write trash and are total assholes, so obviously they’re gonna pair the only sub on the team off with
(I rewrote this chapter 9 times.  I have finally decided to post it so I don't rewrite it 19 times more and thus never move on to their first date, Avengers Assembling, the tantalizing spreadsheet, and new inventions Tony is working on for Steve....  I, uh, hope it worked.  Yeah.)
“Yeah,” Bruce answered heavily. “I managed to stabilize you—used a modified adrenaline shot, if you were wondering—but we had no idea what you’d encountered up there. I used a combination of procedures for containing infectious disease. Hazmat suits, the whole thing, until I was sure you weren’t contagious.”
“No!” Pepper frowned at Tony, then said firmly, “Or if you’re going to try that, don’t ask. Just tell her that you can get to Williams in—however long it takes—if she would like you to. But that if she’s too busy with her friend
“Well,” Tony said, looking up at the blue-ish energy field crackling high in the sky above the tree line. “That sure looks like the start of a portal to me.”
“Huh? Of course,” Tony said, nodding and turning back to his tablet as Steve curled up with his book and Natasha’s knitting needles tick-tick-ticked in the background.
, this wouldn’t have happened if the chain of command--  No, sir. . . . No, sir! . . .  For now, I’ll keep a force here with the spectrometer in case the anomaly returns. Though it seems unlikely.”  A pause.  “I’ll keep that in mind.  Sir.  Rogers out.”
’s spin. (After all, it was true Tony had gone on a second date to The Lion with hedge fund manager Marco Paolini, then decided Paolini was an asshole and ditched him to go home with their handsome waiter instead.) Matt was a sweet kid. They’d hooked up (or dated or whatever) for the next week or two. Tony remembered Matt fondly (though he wasn’t the brightest). Tony wasn’t exactly surprised that he’d fallen for
In the car on the way back to the Tower, Steve seemed tense. Angry.  But maybe a little nervous too?  While Clint and Bruce did a reprise of their Eddie Izzard routine, Steve acted like he was focused on them, but he kept darting these little looks at Tony.  It was starting to make Tony nervous.
The sub on TV made ecstatic “chocolate-noise” and the camera zoomed in on her brightly painted mouth.  Rogers changed the channel.  Tony rinsed off his fingers, fixed himself a scotch, and wandered over to the couch.
Tony soon lost track of time, adrift in the repetitious motions of rocking Steve in his arms, stroking him like a cat, murmuring the same useless platitudes to him in a loop.  Little by little, Steve’s heaving sobs diminished in frequency, subsiding to intermittent gasps and little tremors.
Steve picked up the sleeve of Clint’s uniform, turned it carefully inside out, and peered at it closely.
“Beautiful,” Steve said at last, breaking the lingering silence. “Someday, I’m going to draw you like this—I’ll fill page after page of your gorgeous lines, learn your every proportion and angle. The jut of your hip bones. The arch of your foot. The curve of your shoulders.”
“But, that’s still only got it up to 54 hertz, which is just the sciency way of saying ‘times per second’.”
“Mr. Alvarez,” Tony said, “I hope you’re still shopping for your wife.  I noticed her eying the sapphire ring on the silent auction table and it is Valentine’s day after all.”
Tony’s hands were a constant presence as Tony stood and walked around to stand in front of Steve, hand still resting in his hair.  Tony was naked, his cock hard, and Steve’s mouth fell open at the sight of it, flushed and leaking so close to his face, but then Tony knelt in front of him and cupped Steve’s face in his hands.  Tony knelt there, examining Steve so intently it felt hard to breathe, hard to think.  It was like Tony was analyzing him, taking him apart, pulling away layer after layer.  (Touch me!  Say something! Do something. I--)
It had been an excellent evening. Slight bruises from Rebecca’s rope work were already blossoming at his wrists and elbows, and he was looking forward to seeing the marks from Sam’s whip latticed across his back. There was a happy ache in his muscles and a twinge in his ass. He shivered. It had been a while since he’d done a spit roast—the memory of deep throating Sam while Rebecca pegged him would be making his jerk off material for quite a while.
“ ‘m glad you came,” Steve mumbled against Tony’s shoulder.  Tony’s chest felt tight.  (Oh fuck, I love you.)
Bright and early on day four—after creating seventy-nine altered hypotheticals—Tony ran out of coffee. (Unacceptable.) Also he was vaguely aware that he probably hadn’t eaten since Mrs. Rhodes left. (In fact, nobody had brought him coffee since Pepper. . . and that was a day ago! Where was Steve? )
“Yeah? What do you need?” Tony asked, rolling over on the floor so he could get eyes on Rogers who was—huh.  Who was standing in the hallway holding a tray.
Tony kept fiddling with the fancy coffee machine, wrapping up cords and wires, rambling on:  “’cause I really should have a back up.  Coffee is sacred.  Sacred!  And, seriously,  next time Dummy does something like that I’ll use him for scraps.  Or donate him to City College.  It’s cruel and unusual to force a man to go more than a hundred yards for coffee.”
“I was thinking . . .”  Steve swallowed.  “It’s good obeying you.  You’re in charge and . . . I want to please you.”
“Huh? No! Of course not! I invited you.” Tony protested. “I was glad you came.” Tony said, just meaning to reassure Steve, who was apparently as nervous about the evening as Tony had been. (Or got nervous because Tony was nervous?) As he spoke, though, Tony realized how entirely he meant it. He
Steve shuddered and fell silent.  (Good, being good for Tony.  Shh.  Hush.)  Tony was pressing his fingers in and out again, touching off more dizzying sparks. And it was good, so good, but didn’t Tony want him?  Wouldn’t it be better for Tony to be fucking him, shoving his cock deep inside Steve, feeling Steve clench all around him and—  Was Tony really doing what he wanted to?  Why--  Steve tried to push those thoughts aside, keep floating.
Steve wrinkled his nose and tried to suppress a grimace. Okay, maybe lately Steve had felt at loose ends and a little lonely without his fella, and maybe Steve did like to cook and keep things tidy and be, uh,
“You really don’t want to tell me what to do,” Bruce said, breathing a little more heavily than before, but each breath steady and regular.
Not showing off the wealth—donating it to a good cause, unlike everybody else on that red carpet. Boom! So, go on, baby, spill.”
“Good.”  Tony grinned at Steve, that rakish grin, and scooped up the coffee maker.  “So, I’ll see you here. Noon.”
Tony was a futurist, but not when it came to people. He couldn’t predict what would happen between them.
Thank you all so much for reading and for all your kind support!  “Merry Christmas!” (in Steve voice), “Happy Holidays!” (in Bruce voice), and “Wait, what?  No, wait, it's December what?  So?  Oh. Right. *that*” (in Tony voice).
So. Something unpretentious, but wonderful. Something low-key, but where they wouldn’t be harassed. Something personal. Something special.
Tony alternated between playing with a pen under the table—just something to keep his hands busy—and trying to make an ‘I Am Politely Listening (to Things I Already Know)’ face. One thing to be rude to SHIELD; another to be rude to Steve. (He was pretty sure Steve hated repeating himself almost as much as Tony did, but still…)
“Oh.  That’s all you’ve read?” Tony tried to sound interested, but casual.  “So, in your process of—” he fumbled for the right word, “
something like a touch screen before . . . I kept bumping “a” when I meant “b” or “c” when I meant “d” and then spent so long trying to undo it, the whole test, quote
“Would I know any of his work?” Steve asked, thrilled (and more than a little bewildered) by the idea that a luminary of the art world--both rich and famous?--might want him as a muse.
Tony’d left Steve enjoying a chat with a kind older couple who were on the board for an arts and social outreach non-profit.  Splitting up meant covering more mingling ground (And maybe raised their chances of sneaking off to make out in the coat room?)
Rogers’ expression went soft. “I know that, Bruce, but you’re on our science team. And, well, I assume you don’t want to go out in your bathrobe.”
Tony laughed. “Best social advice my mother ever gave me,” he said with a grin, “was ‘everyone thinks they’re fascinating, darling—just play along and they’ll love you.’ ‘Course, I didn’t listen to that advice very well, as you can imagine, but it’s good stuff anyway.”
Pepper took a step closer and leaned forward, putting an arm around Tony’s waist as she examined his handiwork.
Steve eased Tony upright again and brought his wrists forward. Steve bent to kiss his left palm, then his right palm. Steve rubbed his cheek against Tony’s hand as he swore, “I’m gonna take such good care of you.”
“I was so numb,” Steve whispered, surprised to hear the words coming from his own lips. He had meant to stay silent, but somehow--
“Well,” Tony said with a little huff, “don’t start humming the wedding march or anything. It was one date; we’re not on the verge of riding off into the sunset.”
(When Tony turned his parents mansion into a high security shelter for homeless and battered subs, Pepper’d suggested calling it “Stark House.”  Tony declined; he hated to put his name on everything. Especially considering his less than sterling reputation . . . )
St. Michael’s was beautiful in the late afternoon light.  It wasn’t the oldest church or the most majestic, not by far, but there was something cozy about it. Like a humble country church nested in the big city.  Steve had even drawn it a few times, just the architecture, in clean simple lines.*
“Just get out,” Tony said, giving Steve an uncoordinated shove without turning to look at him. “Get the fuck out.”
“You’ll probably only get a couple of questions where this stuff might come up anyway. Like Mikie said, they’ll probably ask you about procedural stuff, our training, and your impressions of the 21
“That’s the spot, isn’t it?  You like me nailing your prostate, making you gasp and moan.  Maybe I’ll tie you down and make you take it until you scream.”
“Well enough.” Silverstein shrugged. “I confess I’m reluctant to talk about Morgan Stanley with you though.” He gestured to the ballroom expansively. “All anyone wants to talk to me about here is Morgan Stanley; I sought you out since I’m pretty sure you’re the only one here able and willing to talk about the most recent Fields Medalists.”
“See the thing is— Tony,” Clint began awkwardly.  “He seems invincible and he’s really loud about his whole sex-positive liberationism and casual stuff, but he’s--  That doesn’t mean--  Just, he’s not casual with people he’s close to.  Like Pepper—they’ve never! He’s not like that, ok? Tony wouldn’t start something casual with a teammate.”
“Nobody is implying that,” Fury spoke up. He glared at Carmichael—or maybe that was just his usual expression.
Also, there's now an outtake conversation where Rhodey calls Steve as promised.  :) You can read it here:  http://archiveofourown.org/works/4511202
“Oh, hey, me too.”  Tony smiled.  (Reassurance!)  “It’s fine.  Rain check.  Definitely a rain check.”
Steve couldn’t keep the astonishment off his face--that was enough to pay four months back rent AND his heating bill; his shock undoubtedly doubled as she continued.
Steve shrugged. “Me neither, but your garage is immense. Figured I’d just drive her around, slow and easy, for a few minutes to get a feel. Can get my leathers and take her out proper tomorrow if the weather’s decent.”
He'd just snoop around a little bit.  Okay.  What kind of username would Captain America pick?  Well, start with the obvious.
Steve nodded, nuzzling at Tony’s chest while Tony gathered his thoughts.  (Go on.  Say it.  Tell him.)  Still stroking Steve’s back, Tony frowned, his brows furrowed.   Steve couldn’t see that Tony was frowning, but he’d have recognized it as Tony’s “concentration face” even if he had.
actually,” Tony corrected.  Pepper shrugged.  “And, yes, you definitely know him.”  Tony paused to gather his courage—and seriously, why should this be hard?
“They’re well engineered,” Natasha said, looking at her launcher approvingly.  “Though I prefer a knife over a net and spear.”
Steve kissed him, rough and demanding and Tony matched him stroke for stroke as those clever fingers pressed urgently inside him and Steve pushed and pulled, moving Tony up and down against his body again and again and again.
“Come on, Cap,” he said, “You need a hot wet hole for your dick—and I’m right here. So let’s go, stud. Show me what you got.”
"Plenty of ways to serve," Phillips said. "Or do you think being a soldier's the only way that matters?  What--farmers, weavers, dairy maids beneath you?"
Steve worried his lower lip and continued leafing back through the book.  (Doesn’t that take an awful lot of concentration?  Can Tony focus on all that and still enjoy himself?)
Tony reached out to lay a reassuring hand on Steve’s arm, then said: “Jesus! You’re freezing! Come on: onto the couch, under the blanket. Up, up!” Tony dragged Steve, now pliant, onto the couch.
Steve sighed and pulled away, taking his hand from Tony’s. He looked away and his voice was heavy as he said, “I’m sorry you had to see me like that.”
My infinite gratitude to EVERYONE WHO HAS CHEERED ME ON!  I really couldn't do it without so many kind words from so many kind people.  I'd have given up long ago without all of you.  But especially I'd like that thank thatwhichyields, Mary, pandowl, shards-of-divinity, and lilragekitten for going above and beyond with their EPIC beta reading and cheer leading!!!!!!
Steve gave him an exceptionally chaste little good night kiss and high tailed it out of the workshop.
Steve wouldn’t make eye contact. The embarrassment Tony’d seen on his face last night had deepened into
As Steve slowly tied his wrists, Tony’s cock was still a throbbing weight between his thighs, but his arousal felt distant, non-urgent.
Tony made absolutely no effort to craft a briefing accessible for the layman—at least, until Johnny asked some intelligent follow-up questions.  After that, Tony ignored Dominick and he, Bruce, and Johnny had a pretty enjoyable (or at least painless) chat before handing things over to Steve who was explaining the strategy the Avengers had come up with for their training.
They drank quietly for a moment before Tony took a step closer. He laid a hand on Steve’s arm as he looked up and asked seriously, “But really. Are you doing okay?”
Steve was still stroking his hair and murmuring indistinct terms of endearment as Tony sank into a warm, contented slumber.
“So, tell me,” Tony said. “Do you sleep in the Wonder Woman armor? Because I’ll be flattered if you do.”
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
“One might argue,” Tony jumped in, “that team banter is a key part of our cooperative dynamics and hence an asset to the Hulk acclimation process.”
“Please take your time,” she said, then added to Steve, “Can I start you off with drinks? Or a bottle of wine?”
Tony ignored them and strode over to the coffee machine.  Somebody had just brewed a new pot, but it had the sharp, acidic smell of bad institutional coffee, the kind that tasted burnt even when it was fresh.  Tony didn’t really want it anymore, but maybe he should take some all the same.  It was piping hot so, worst-case scenario, he could spill it on Agent Dickface if he got too close.
In the end, Good Queen Peg had sold her jewels to the Itani in return for grain; many had still starved to death and most of the kingdom remembered the long gnawing feeling of not enough food, too long without a full belly until their harvests recovered.
“Thank you. Thank you, Steve,” Tony murmured softly, in a soothing litany. “Sweetheart . . . thank you . . .”
“No of course not!  I didn’t think--” Steve began awkwardly.  He grabbed the letter. “I posted this, but the letter came back.  I thought maybe they don’t want to give him mail there? So I hoped maybe you could . . . ?”
“Well, in that case, before you go,” Steve began awkwardly, with a glance at Tony, “there’s something Iron Man and I—“
Vast thanks to everyone who leaves me delicious, nourishing comment cookies to feed the muse.  You are wonderful!
Thank you, everyone, for your kindness and support.  I hope this story can be a comfort in dark times.
“When I said I was ‘good,’ ” Tony interrupted with a grimace, “I meant, ‘I’m not interested in you.’”
On the limo ride home, Bruce chatted enthusiastically to Tony about the developments in symplectic geometry he’d discussed with Harry; Clint and Natasha spoke quietly, their heads close together; and Steve stared out the window, watching New York crawl by.
“Yeah,” Tony answered roughly into Rhodey’s sweatshirt, then said more forcefully as he pulled away, “Yeah, what the fuck?  What the hell happened?”
Steve frowned, mulling over their recent conversation.  Safeword, huh?  The whole concept seemed a little odd.  If he wanted to be untied, wouldn’t he just ask? And if Tony wanted him tied up, wouldn’t he want to stay tied up too?  Wouldn’t it be obvious if he was upset?  It was hard to picture being upset with Tony there to take care of him.  Tony wouldn’t do anything he knew would distress Steve. (Ugh.  Some of the things on that chart.  Just ugh.)
Tony’d almost run after him. Almost. But instead he’d just stood there, frozen, for who knows how long while Rogers’ words echoed in his head. (“
The next time Rogers came to the lab, Tony was alone again.  The Captain was wearing khaki slacks, a blue button-down shirt, and a brown leather bomber jacket.  Tony couldn’t help sneaking another look while pretending to work on his tablet at the console; the man was
“Oh, you know me,” Tony said with a teasing tone, laying one hand flirtatiously on the man’s chest, “I’m no good at asking for what I want.” Tony let out a theatrical sigh. “I’ve been on the sidelines all night wishing someone would lead me around the dance floor a few times, but alas.”
I'm BACK!  With extreme gratitude to lilragekitten who heroically figured out my timeline so I could focus on writing new chapters.  The timeline revealed that Tony and Steve went on their first date just THREE WEEKS ago.  Feels like years, doesn't it?  Oh, right.  In RL time it has been years.  *face palm*  I've gotta finish this story soon.....
“Fine, Steve,” Tony said, taking a huge armful of brightly colored packages out of the back seat. “So you were right about the Lotus. I’m big enough to admit it—even with my god-like Tetris packing skills, there was no way. But we’ll be fine in the Audi.”
Steve shook his head.  (No.  Tony loves it.  He does. We’re good.)  Steve called up a picture of Tony grinning at him, naked and sweaty and pleased.  (Tony obviously likes it like this.)  But suddenly another image of Tony flashed into his mind: Tony smiling, happy and satisfied, completely at ease surrounded by reporters and investors.
“Steve’s hardly the ‘mama’ type and Nat’d kill him if he tried it,” Tony answered, tossing a new ball over to the Hulk.
Rhodey squinched up his eyes, then tilted his chin up. Tony crowed inwardly—it was one of Rhodey’s most obvious tells.
“It’s gonna work,” Tony said. “We’re a team now. Really.” Tony bumped his shoulder into Bruce’s and added, “I mean, look at us! We baked cookies together for fuck’s sake!”
Tony took a step back to admire his handiwork. Pepper’s Wonder Woman body armor was ready to be wrapped and it was perfectly designed to inspire envy in top army brass and cosplayers alike. (Not that he expected her to wear it out without Vera Wang or Chanel over top, but she’d look fabulous if she did.) He’d ordered Mrs. Rhodes another Ferrari, scheduled to arrive on Christmas Eve. (It was a little game they played—he bought her something extravagant, she called and scolded him, then made him return it and send something deplorably ordinary, like a stand-up mixer.) He’d gotten a receipt from MIT for his annual donation in Rhodey’s honor, funding three more talented students for the James T. Rhodes Scholarship. (Rhodey’s middle name didn’t actually start with a T, but Tony couldn’t resist making the man one step closer to Captain James T. Kirk when he filled out the forms.) And across the workshop, the Norton Dominator glistened and gleamed in the light. Outwardly, it looked like something from the 1940s, but its new engineering would make any modern gear head drool. He’d really been in the zone with this one.
Natasha walked around the workbench, sauntering closer and closer, until she was right next to Tony.  She had so much presence; he always forgot he was actually taller until they were standing close like this.
“Tell Steve I’m going to try and learn to make myself an omelet and he should come join me. If I succeed, I’ll feed him; if I fail, he can save me from myself and put out the flames.”
.” Tony paused, then glanced down at his stomach. And thighs. “Uh, sure.” He frowned. “Yeah, salad. Good idea.”
This chapter was extremely hard for me to write and contains some triggery stuff.  It probably won’t surprise you, having read the previous chapters, but here it is:
Tony stroked Steve’s hand in silence. Tony rummaged at the back of his brain for the advice and the phrases he’d read long ago in pamphlets and help-books with hokey titles like “Helping Heal / Healing Help: PTSD and Your Loved One.” He’d never known when to listen or when to talk, but until he actually knew what to say, he’d stroke Steve’s hand and wait.
“Good evening and welcome to Cucina Paradiso,” their server said with a smile at them both. “Are you ready to order?”
Tony thought Natasha’s eyes flicked to Steve for a second before she agreed, “And we’re less likely to attract unwanted attention if we don’t go for a thirty minute walk before dinner.”
"You'd best not be caught speaking like that in Manottan," Phillips said sharply.  "They would take it very ill."
Thank you all very much for the positive response to chapter 5! It was very encouraging, so here's another chapter.  :-)
Steve divided his attention between the movie (which is pretty hilarious)  and Tony (who is far more interesting, to be honest …).  Little by little, Tony’s eyes started drooping, and his body started to sag, until eventually he was fast asleep on Steve’s shoulder.  Tony looked beautiful like that, relaxed and content, in the flickering light from the television screen.
Tony sat and stared: equations and diagrams, rigorously ordered, direct.  They still weren’t quite right.  He wanted to do something with his hands, but he really should wait just a little longer since he’d had . . . how many glasses of wine?   Dummy wheeled over to nudge his leg.  Tony sighed and settled for petting his bot, scanning his work for errors.
A few hours later, the diagnostics had returned almost perfect results.  One of the 756-Js was faulty, so it had fucked up their data yield, but that was small potatoes.  Tony was going at it with his most delicate tools-- relishing for once his small, nimble fingers—while Bruce hovered, reviewing the output.
“We eat breakfast at the table, lunch at the table, and dinner on non-movie nights at the table,” Clint pointed out.  “I think we can have couch-dinner this time.”  He turned to Natasha, “Hey, Natasha—beer me!”
He’d almost forgotten how much he liked Rebecca. Shame they didn’t live in New York. And that she seldom had patience for society events unless they truly required her presence.
“The Russian church isn’t on the Gregorian calendar,” Steve explained. Natasha gave him an approving look.
Pepper raised one eyebrow. “You see why I was concerned? Anyone who could get past your security protocols would have to be dangerous. It only took two minutes to put on the suit—the added protection seemed wise. At least until my SWAT team arrived.”
“Yeah, but it’s not just that,” Tony said, not quite sure how to put it into words. “He just . . . he really likes cooking. And feeding people. He makes this fantastic roast chicken and potatoes. And he and Bruce like to make Indian food together. It’s—I guess, it’s kinda his thing.”
“Yeah, of course, Steve Rogers.”  They sat, staring stupidly at each other over the lavishly arranged table.  “Wait, who did you think--?!?”
“And I pointed out, well, what you said.  You’re committed to the team or you wouldn’t be doing all this. You want a place on the team and you want it to be public; I told him I thought you’d do everything in your power to keep that publicity positive, but you can’t be expected to control the press.  I really just repeated what you said, Mr. Stark.”
“Tonight?” And was it just surprised pleasure in Steve’s expression, or maybe a bit of relief? “You’re not too busy?”
Steve was still talking, voice gentle and Tony really wanted to be angry about that, but his head was spinning a little and it made it hard to focus. “This is different. Can't you see that? I didn't give you a hard time when you had to fix those phones for Stark Industries, did I? But look at this, Tony.” Steve waved his hand around the workshop. Tony blinked. His vision swam for a moment.
“What’s with all the women in my life nagging me about financial reports?” Tony complained. “You! Pepper! Who’s next?”
Pathetic terrible platitudes—hollow philosophical soundbytes, religious reassurances Tony didn’t believe in—raced through his mind, and he rejected one after another after another.
Rogers gave him a look half hurt and half frustration. “Not everything is about orientation for me any more than it is for you.” He frowned. “It’s not because I’m a Dom and you’re a sub, it’s because I’m a person and you’re my friend.” Rogers paused then added softly, “And I don’t have that many friends here.”
Clint got out first, flashing a peace sign and joking around.  Bruce next. Then Natasha. Tony could hear the reporters calling their names, the clicking and lighting of cameras exploding.
Something onscreen made Steve laugh out loud. Tony smiled and curled more closely against Pepper’s legs, trying to pick up the thread of the movie.
Tony took the offered paper and laughed. Steve had drawn a pair of cartoons: Dummy with a goatee and Dummy as Iron Man.
“Yeah.”  Tony sighed.  Pepper waited silently, but Tony couldn’t make himself say it out loud.  He was sick of trying to explain Liberationism 101 to thick-skulled Doms.  It was exhausting and usually pointless since they either already got it or wouldn’t fucking
Tony shrugged and approached Bruce’s desk. It was littered with crumpled stationary. The wastepaper basket was full, and one balled up paper had fallen on the floor. Tony picked it up to shove back in the basket, but first--
Huh.  Tony hadn't expected a guy from the '40s to be more liberal than that, but he'd at least expected a little more class.
“So,” Bruce added, “shall we reschedule this meeting for a time when we’re all better prepared to discuss the matter fully?”
Sitting on a giant throne was a thin, frail looking man.  He was dressed in a thick blue robe that looked too big and a simple golden circlet balanced awkwardly on his head.  The throne--massive dark wood, elaborately carved--dwarfed the smiling figure sitting on it. For a moment, Tony thought he was advanced in years, but as he drew closer--keeping his face blank--he realized, to the contrary, the king was quite young: bright blue eyes, elfin cheekbones, pale, snowy skin.
“Yeah.”  Tony took another sip of scotch, deliberating for a moment before he added, “And I oughtta know.  Firsthand experience and all that.”  Tony shrugged.  “You can read about it, you know.  On wikipedia and whatnot.  Hell, there are dissertations written about the trial transcripts alone.”
But as he rambled an apology (and silently rued the greasy state of his hair) Steve started grinning.

It felt like Tony was everywhere at once, holding him to the headboard, sucking his nipples, caressing his hips, his legs.  (Tony . . . Tony . . . !)
“Bruce,”  she said quietly and Tony really should have known, shouldn’t have been surprised, but he was.  He really was.
“Never,” Steve said, the word warm and vehement against Tony’s neck as Steve pulled him close again.  With a firm caress, Steve’s hands mapped Tony’s shoulders, his back, the curve of his ass, holding Tony tight against him.
“Oh, God, Tony,” Steve murmured.  He knelt beside Tony and took his wrists to kiss first his left palm, then his right.  Tony kept his head bent, eyes down, a picture of submission.
The elevators were quiet in the Tower (of course), but they hadn’t been designed with Steve’s acute hearing in mind.  There was an elevator on its way past Steve’s floor, and it sounded like it stopped just one above, at Tony’s.
