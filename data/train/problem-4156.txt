“Aw, that’s just not a fair game,” Dean mumbles, complete bafflement competing with his awe at the absurdity of it all.
One miscalculation though – Dean’s been on hundreds of roadtrips like this with Sam’s burrito-digesting ass. So he just rolls down the window and, to Cas’ immense displeasure, endures.
The smile that crosses Cas’ face is genuine this time. “That’s good.”
Absently, Dean tries to figure out how much time they have left before Sam’s finished showering.
, that’s what it is!” He smiles, proud of the pun he could sneak into his pep talk. “You’re apparently so at ease around me that you don’t care to put on your ‘make-up’. You just
Cas lifts his head an inch to catch Dean's eyes with his own.
Dean was with him. The last part had come out by accident, and it had surprised both of them.
Gabriel’s laugh interrupts him. “Oh no no no, you’re not getting off this hook so easily!”
“Sure,” Dean says, not very convincing. At Cas’ pointed look he relents, “I guess Anna’s okay. And that customer service angel. Alfie.”
“I haven’t been touched there in a while,” Cas amends, and from anyone else this admission could’ve had huge flirty undertones, but coming from Cas? There’s no ulterior motive here at all, which all the more strongly sparks in Dean the wish to grab Cas and hold him in his arms. Which he does, because what’s holding him back?
Finally, Cas gets to breathe. “Thank you, Anna.”
“Yes.”
“That good, huh,” she says knowingly. Then her gaze shifts to somewhere over his shoulder, settles on something that makes her smile meaningfully. “You know what’s good too?”
It’s a total lie, and it slaps a wicked smile onto Dean’s face. “You’re totally purring!”
“You ever relax, Novak?”
“Why did you do it?”
there, in Purgatory? You don’t
So he decided to come clean. “No, of course not.” He tilted his head back to stare at that boring spot on the ceiling again. “A… transferral is not necessary, the pain can be extinguished out of existence,” he said, voice almost a whisper. “It just makes me feel better.”
Castiel stares ahead, hoping his expression broadcasts exactly how little he thinks of Dean. “I spat in each of them before you ate them.”
For some reason, this choice of wording grated on Cas’ nerves. “I don’t need anyone 'babysitting’ me. There’s no harm done with what I do. On the contrary, it’s
“Poof,” provides Charlie.
He’s actually using finger quotes, the dweeb, as if there’s so much as a chance his idea of
The lamp on his nightstand that blows up on Cas’ next thrust? Replaceable and what’s it matter?
Once it’s all in there, Cas is a fucking machine. Perks of sleeping with a guy who doesn’t tire out? He never, even for a second, loses steam on you.
He doesn’t look, but he thinks Winchester may be rolling his eyes. “Told ya he’s a robot,” he directs at someone among his visitors, or maybe all of them. Castiel doesn’t know. He’s had enough of their intruding eyes. He rolls carefully over to his left side, swallowing the grunt that threatens to escape him at the wave of pain shooting from his ribs, and stares at the door.
“Geez, didn’t know you were such a big sex baby.”
“If it's any consolation, Sam,” comments Cas. “you're not a 'mood killer' from my perspective.” At Deans scandalized look, he adds, “What? Your brother is aesthetically pleasing.”
Because the universe is conspiring against Castiel and his newfound pursuit of a fulfilled love life, however, the sweet moment is short-lived. A cleared throat reminds them of the two other people in the room, and Dean and Cas draw apart.
His patience is being tested, yes, but Cas must remind himself that a delay is better than a definite
There's a knock on the Bunker door, and Cas answers it.
But Dean shakes his head firmly. “Fat chance! You're not going in your condition, it's way too dangerous.”
“He got discharged today,” nurse Tessa tells him even though he has not asked.
“– But you're the best mood killer, so we're good.”
A muffled noise escapes Cas’ throat that he hides by ducking his head. It’s an awkward motion, one Dean’s not seen on him before. He likes it. He’d almost say it’s kinda cute. But that’s ridiculous. Cas isn’t cute. He’s a warrior.
Cas draws his wing back a few inches, but otherwise leaves it in place before Dean. “I closed them all to reduce your discomfort,” he explains. “Sorry.”
“Mhmm.”
These are the things he does not ask.
What Crowley hadn’t considered was that the tongues of angels are hella fucking convincing for a
“Quite foolishly, I
It all escalates on hour five, when Cas points out, “We’re lost.”
His thrusts have pinpoint precision, his kisses along Cas’ neck are blissful torture, and the interplay of all these sublime sensations almost make Castiel forget why he is keeping his lips pressed closed, why he is trying to muffle his own groans.
Dean stops short. “They're not angel killing bullets?” He demands, head turned to Garth now.

He smiled. This was good. This was what it should feel like to do good. The Bad had to go somewhere after all, and it better go to a place that
The opposing forces never stood a chance.
is, do you? F-U-N. Look it up, it’d do you some good.”
And let himself be pulled up.
Dean doesn’t seem to notice any of that, though. He looks at Cas like he’s trying to drink in his sight, and the corner of his mouth ticks up when a choked-off laugh leaves his lungs and he says back, “Hey.” His right hand twitches as though to reach out before it thinks better of it. “Good to see you.”
than this. A warm hug and a sappy smile is all he needs to reach Nirvana.”
Castiel doesn’t even grace him with a look. “I would prefer not to.”
Still, it was nice. Cas closed his eyes and absorbed Dean’s warmth into himself, breathed in the familiar scent of leather and motor oil and Dean. Absently, he wondered if this may be a better way to deal. It felt nice, anyway. And the world seemed just a fraction more bearable.
“They,” repeats Dean.
“Ya don’t have to bullshit me, brother,” Another prolongated moment passed in which Benny scrutinized Cas. His eyes had lost their challenging glint they usually had when directed at Castiel, which sparked the thought in Castiel that maybe he had to rethink the entire basis on which their relationship was grounded.
, he judges.
“Happiness, I hope.”
Dean and Cas stop right in the doorframe, staring back at the group of angels who are taking a break in their endeavour to get royally drunk to shoot them expectant and judging looks respectively.
The “
“Absurd?” Dean echoes, wounded. “Your
Sam sighs. “No, that’s what
He pulls Dean closer all the same, curling up flush against him and burying his head into his stomach. Dean, resigning himself to his fate, lets himself be molded into a human cushion.
Touched by an angel, Dean feels as pure as it gets. There’s not even any spunk left on their skins: yet another angel perk, go figure.
(Once again, Cas mourns his ability to roll his eyes.)
“Yeah, good,” agrees Dean. “All good. Fantastic, actually.”
Unfortunately for him, his group of friends is, in fact, very intellectually and strategically gifted despite their collective momentary lapse in sanity, and therefore said gifted minds are conspiring against him.
“Healing,” repeated Benny, and Cas had to admit it was impressive to hear how many layers of judgment he could carry through just that one word. “I called Dean.”
“So, that was-” Dean laughs awkwardly, rubbing the back of his neck.
Smiling up at Dean, Cas nods. “Just let me say goodbye to the others.”
“I know they’re gruesome to you. I didn’t mean to show them to you anyway, it’s an error I deeply regret, Dean, I’m-”
His breathing becomes short. His hair, under the bandage, feels soaked with sweat.
Dean throws her a thankful look that Charlie acknowledges with a nod. Cas really misses earth as it was before the homo sapiens sapiens evolved from the species of the primates. The pterodactyls
A shaky laugh escapes Sam at that, and before Cas can blink, he's got the woman wrapped in a crushing hug.
Dean had become quiet instantly, ready to withdraw. The moment of silence had stretched endlessly. That’s how it had felt at least, even though Cas knows it isn’t logically possible for time on Earth to move in any other way than linear, at least without supernatural interference – but awkwardness can apparently reshape entire concepts of physics.
They’re trading furtive glances between them, like it’s still a novelty to be sure of the goodness of their bond, the blessing, and it pleases Cas greatly when he notes a certain shyness in Dean’s smiles that’s slowly but surely becoming familiar to him.
Firstly, there’s the sense of safety that Cas manages to encompass him in with just the sound of his voice. Compare that to the complete madness that is waking up to the sight of a lion head on the pillow next to him like it belongs there, and Dean’s hunting instincts are at a loss about whether to shoot or protect, or let himself be protected.
An awkward cough puts an early end to their erupting argument. “How about I take the girls, and Team Research takes the first Cas shift?” suggests Jody.
At that, somehow, the whole room is rendered silent as though everyone is holding their collective breath.
Cas is sitting inside. His booth’s purpusoley facing the door but his gaze is equally purposely focussed on his plate.
“But for the second one, Dean is basically the
is Dean’s life now for the nearest future. All that exists is Cas' cock pistoning in and out of him.
Sam's gaze is locked on the screen of his own phone, though. “This seems like a big deal.”
“If I get a cold, I’ll fucking send you the bill,” he says, as Castiel makes his way back to his bed.
Absently, he lifted a hand to his face, noted the way his limbs trembled even before he felt it.
Cas sat up sharply, ignoring the way the world was still spinning around him. “You didn’t.”
“You,” Cas says. “Shouldn't even be here. I'm not any of your concerns, I'm sorry for wasting your time, Claire, but you can all go now.” Maybe if Cas can corner Dean alone in his bedroom, a repetition of last night's events doesn't have to be completely out of the cards yet.
“Sure,” Winchester repeats.
They are crowded, full of germs, and inefficient.
All of that.
But Dean shakes his head calmly. “You don’t need to do that,” he says. “To be close to me.”
“Great,” Dean said, sitting down on an available chair next to Cas’ and folding his hands in his lap. “So? I’m listening.”
Dean’s brain needs a moment to recalibrate and his voice a glass of water to return. As though Cas read his mind, he’s producing one out of thin air and placing the rim of the glass to his lips. Greedily, Dean swallows it down in one go.
So he sits down beside Cas on the bed. “Look, man,” he starts. “I’m just saying. You fainted…straight into my arms. You know, if you wanted my attention you didn’t have to go to such extremes.”
In a show of how classy his delinquent band of brethren really is, the sound of wolf whistles follows them outside.
“I put my guard down,” he says. “I didn’t mean to confront you with this sight, I truly didn’t, but it was warm and comfortable, and you were here by my side, sleeping soundly and…,” He pauses, grasping for the right words.
Castiel snorts. “I’d like to see you try, with that thing keeping you back,” he says, pointing at his cast.
The body above Cas’ stills. Cas opens his eyes. “Dean, what?”
“It’s not for work,” lies the liar. “It’s for, uh, ‘watching Netflix’ in the evening.”
is absurd!”
Without Dean there to argue with him, Castiel regards the passage of time as admittedly dull.
Because it's starting to feel like Dean needs to prove something, and this is definitely not how this should go. This thing between them should be slow and sweet and
, Sammy,” Winchester remarks testily. “Dude’s a noble.”
No use protesting, that would only prolong the process.
This side of death was not absolute. Where there was suffering, there was still life, and so the end of theirs could still be averted.
Dean looked at him. “Where did it go all the times before now, then?” he asked. “Don’t tell me you always had to take on their –
“I do if I want to!” Cas grouses. Then he downs the last glass he’ll get in this pub and slides from his stool as gracefully as he can. He spares no glance towards Dean and Long Legs, but shoots Sam one last daring look before he blips out of this boring establishment.
“This should give us a few hours head start before the brigade arrives, whaddaya say?”
“What-”
“Oh god,” Dean gasps, and he looks like he's gonna be sick very soon. “Maybe my dick is what finally does you in permanently.”
“There’s no title on this book. Just a picture of a spindle,” informs Charlie. Her eyes widen. “A spindle! Ooh! Do you think this has anything to do with the fairytale?”
Half an hour later, he pulls up at the small town’s only diner.
Suddenly, that’s a big If.
“Hey, no, I was looking at that!”
Castiel lifts his own lips in a smile that probably looks constrained. “Yes. Uh-” He opens his mouth, closes it again. “It’s good to see you too. Is Sam-”
Head falling back onto the pillow, Cas lets out an impatient sigh. “I don’t know, just –
His lips are warm against Dean’s, for the second the kiss lasts. It’s as sweet as it is fleeting. Far too soon, Cas withdraws.
Cas isn’t normally a drunkard. At all. Only when circumstances really demand it that he must become, as they say, ‘wasted’, and he seeks to apply the distraction methods Dean taught him to forget about how awful he’s feeling for a while.
He can’t help himself. He starts laughing.
It’s crazy enough for Dean to forget his basic hunter instincts, and instead of being a big warrior guy about it, what he does is fucking scream his fucking lungs out!
“Right there, huh,” Dean teases. His damp hair is sticking to his forehead, the tattoo on his chest stands out bright against the flush that has spread there from exertion, and he is beautiful.
It’s Cas who pulls him back down.
“Your lion head is touch-starved,” he surmises, when the purring starts up again.
“I... don’t allow myself to. Not very often,” Cas admits. “Why are you here?”
They go outside to eat Dean’s lunch on a bench.
Pleased at having found a different outlet for his agitation, Castiel rolls his eyes at him. “I hadn’t realized you’re such a ‘wimp’, Winchester.”
To distract, he takes a gulp of water. “I’m fine,” he says again.
Cas’ shoulders slumped. “That sounds excessive, you…” he sighed. “You don’t need to do that.”
Winchester blinks. “Wait, seriously?” he asks, forehead wrinkled in a way that can only be described as confusion. “I was kidding, that was what a social call sounds like for you?”
It became a sort of beacon for him, and he longed for it, to seek out the fire that burned him, even just for a little while. He healed every little scratch and wound and made it his own, he transferred the long faded but ever-present ache of scars onto himself, and he thrived on it all.
Strangely, it is the sight of his scorched flesh that breaks Cas out of his stupor. It's just flesh. It will heal. No real harm done.
And then Benny slipped out into the hallway. The thump the door made when it slammed shut sounded judgmental in itself, which was impossible – doors had no capacity for the forming of their own opinion – and Cas almost flinched at its finality.
Another drawn-out thrust sends happy tears to the corners of Cas’ eyes. He loves this, he loves Dean, he–
list of my sexual past doesn't uh... throw you off or something,” Dean worries, but when he lifts his head, he sees Cas already immersed in a reunion hug of his own with Anna. Won't be a problem on that front, then.
The first orgasm rolls through him and Castiel wastes no time to move on to the main course.
A myriad of moments flashes before Cas' eyes right then. All those times he and Dean had looked at each other, when their gazes dropped to the other's lips; all of Dean's prayers after the apocalypse, in purgatory; the pull he felt whenever he was in Dean's vicinity, the pull he still feels; the push of one of them retreating into their respective shell of longing...
“You don’t need to do that,” Dean says.
Through the litany of curses he internally hurls towards Dean, he hears a series of quick little steps, and the turn of pages.
He hears Cas let out a long exhale that tells Dean exactly how hard he’s still plaguing himself with worry, before he says, “What you’re seeing is, thankfully, a mere reflection of a fraction of my True Form.“
that cling to them.
The two meet in a warm embrace, and at the brightness of Dean's smile, Cas suppresses the little pinprick feeling in his chest that makes him wonder what it means that Benny of all people is among this group.
“You’re not getting a cold from a little bit of a breeze.”
Dean takes a moment to gape at Cas, digesting the betrayal. “Okay, that’s it,” he says as soon as he recovers, and restarts the car. He doesn’t stay to watch Cas approach a helpful looking lady with a map.
“Ow!” Cas complains dramatically.
His fingers loosen their tight grip on the bedsheets and Cas’ upper arm respectively, and he opens his eyes to find the angel inches from his face, brushing sweaty strands of hair from Dean’s forehead.
Cas looks down at his shoes, taken aback. “You don't have to be mean.”
That fact, among many others about the man, is grating on Castiel’s nerves.
,” he gasps out, and he would not beg in the face of Raphael’s wrath, under Naomi’s meddling hands or Lucifer’s taunting but he begs now.
“Burn?” says Dean. “I'm talking about your
What’s left of Cas’ brain short-circuits. “Love?”
“Colorful,” comments Kevin.
“Not all of it, no. Think of this,” and here he makes a gesture that encompasses all three of his additional body parts, “As a three-dimensional projection of a multidimensional object, the object being myself. The three-dimensional level isn’t capable of reproducing the whole image, but what does come through is tangible and true to the original. I suppose it is for the reason of this incompleteness, that the sight does you no harm,” he pauses, training his with contrition filled eyes directly on Dean. “I would never have forgiven myself, had I hurt you, Dean.”
While Sam and Charlie work out a plan how best to transport everyone to Lebanon and designate drivers for each car, Dean and Cas take their chance to discreetly sneak away.
He didn’t know where he was, didn’t know where he’d been when he lost consciousness, or the fact that he lost consciousness at all.
Soon, his Grace would work on defeating the foreign matter, and in the meantime, it would put his consciousness into a sleep-like state, or as sleep-like as Castiel could get fully powered.
Dean clicks his tongue against the roof of his mouth. He nods, because yeah, angel wings come with a ton of creepy eyes apparently, and
“New,” Cas finishes for him.
Cas doesn’t say anything. He just keeps glaring – at the ground for a change so Dean gets a reprieve, if temporary – and that’s an awkward silence if there ever was one.
“Your fault if you keep babbling like this. Gotta know if you’re not gossiping behind my back!”
“I only ever needed to have…,” A soft smile blooms on Dean’s face as he continues, “Faith.”
“I spent all this time in the same room with you, what do you think,” Dean affirms. “I woulda just flicked you against the head, woulda been enough for you whiner.”
Castiel could peek over to the other man’s name tag as well, but he already knows what he’s called. Everyone in the corridor knows Dean Winchester. He’s loud, he’s rude and he’s shameless. He flirts with anything with a heartbeat, and for reasons that escape Castiel’s understanding, he is dearly cherished by everyone.
They speak at the same time.
“How come I can see you like this anyway?” He inquires. The last time Cas wanted to reveal a part of his True Self to him, blood had spilled out of Dean’s ears. Thankfully, both his ears and eyes are still intact now, and Dean’d like to keep it that way. But still – it’s curious.
Home, sweet home, Dean thinks as they step into the shabby motel room of the week. It may not be the most comfortable – or the most sanitary for that matter judging by the suspicious dark stains on the ceiling – but at least it offers some shelter and warmth after that bitch of a hunt they just wrapped up. If that’s all Dean gets, he’ll take it.
“Unintentionally, of course,” Cas hastes to add. “A... former colleague fell with me.”
Never mind that he’d left behind an equally naked Cas writhing on their bed with unrelieved tension.
“We’re doing this, Sammy.” Rolling his eyes, Dean heaves the second duffel bag into the trunk, grunts dramatically at the unexpected weight. “The hell did you pack, whole ass bricks?”
“If I wanted to murder you, you’d already be dead.”
“Eeee-claaair,” Dean mumbles in broken French. “There.
“The question is,” Crowley muses. “What are
Turning his head slowly, Dean says, voice dangerously low, “You did not just suggest that.”
As if anything about Cas actually could.
Castiel doesn’t answer.
“No, no, wait, I asked Sammy to close that!” Winchester says, when he recognizes what this action of Castiel’s leads to. “I get chilly!”
Averting his gaze down to his feet, Cas says, “Yes, basically.”
“It worked!” announces Charlie, quietly, as though she doesn’t want to disrupt the solemnity of the moment.
He doesn’t get that that’s exactly what excites Dean about Cas. Cas keeps him on his toes, keeps the flame between them alight, and Dean craves the way that makes him feel alive. With Cas, the grocery store becomes a war zone. Movie night a court case.
Dean shrugs. “At least
Sam widens his eyes comically, a deliberately worn facial expression of Sam’s that aims at showing his judgmental disbelief, as Cas has come to realize after all the years of spending time with him and the corresponding attempts at categorizing his moods.
“Well,” says Jody, who sets to quench the little fire and wipe up the mess with the joint effort of Sam and Charlie. “Maybe you need to reconsider that, Castiel.”
And suddenly something clicks in Dean’s head, and it all starts to make sense. Because the summation of Cas + madness isn’t so far off from the equation of Cas = safety, and really, Dean shouldn’t have expected his first night with his angel boyfriend to be any less crazy.
From under lowered lids, Cas inspects him, evaluating the perks of undressing Dean in the blink of an eye with his powers versus banking on the slow, savoring way with his hands. “I say
Cas frowns. “To Wichita.”
And yet looking Dean in the eyes right now feels impossible to bear.
Dean’s pretty sure his ears are ringing, or maybe that’s just Cas’ grace singing to him, prophesizing Dean’s Second Coming. Or Third, or Fourth, who can keep count?
But his Grace did not stop there. It took their pain and
“Yes, Dean?”
Castiel glances at Sam and Dean, who appear to be so perplexed that they are unable to close their mouths.
“Hey, you okay there, buddy?” A voice fights its way over through the congestion in his ears.
Looking around, Dean notices most of the wing eyes, too, have averted their gaze bashfully, and if he didn’t know any better, he’d say the lion head was sporting a faint blush around the whiskers.
“T'morrow,” Cas agrees, voice muffled against Dean’s shirt.
If Dean weren't in the ridiculous belief that sleeping with a Winchester was ultimately fatal.
At that, strangely, Benny snorted. “Have you even
Castiel cants his head in a clear show of
charms – hey, kinda like Kevin and me! Who are still alive of course, because the author of this story is not a complete bozo.” Kevin looks up from his coffee for a second to meet Charlie's raised hand in a high-five. “But you gotta admit, Cas. There's a pattern.”
But it brings a smile to Dean’s face and he calls that a win in itself. “No, I know you’re not.” He bridges the gap between them again to drag the back of his hand over Cas’ cheek. “That’s kinda what I love about you.”
Cas moans.
Since sharing a room, Castiel has met Winchester’s brother Sam, what Cas assumes is his father Bobby, his sister-or-girlfriend Jo (Cas is at a loss in that regard) and her mother Ellen. Cas also learned that the Winchester family is acquainted with a morally questionable hacker named Charlie-something, a conspiracy theorist with the name Frank, and Pam the medium and Kevin the next president and – at this point Castiel had finally caught on to the fact that Dean was messing with him.
“It does,” he says, mouth turning downward. “You know, Dean, I heard a kiss from an attractive human can cure even the most severe wounds.”
Deeming the situation sufficiently diffused, Dean dares to drag Cas back against him (Cas lets him) and tucks his chin over the other man’s head. “You probably won’t remember this once you’re sobered up, but dude, I hope you’ll appreciate the irony one day, because you-” He presses a soft kiss into Cas’ hair. “Are exactly what I want, buddy.”
His phone has forsaken him the three times before when he tried to connect to the head office, and this time is no different. Castiel grumbles under his breath and pulls the useless phone off his ear.
His lips are rough and his hands are gripping him so tightly it’d be bruising on an average human being but when he parts Cas’ lips with his, it’s gentle and his nose is digging into Cas’ cheek in a way that’s almost desperate and all Cas can do is stand there, stockstill.
A heavy sigh leaves Cas’ lungs.
“So,” starts Claire, once they've all assembled in varying positions around the tables. “You and Cas hooked up, huh.” And then Claire punches Dean on the arm, hard.
“I don’t love
Dean’s always been better with actions rather than words. That’s why it’s easy, so easy for his hands to come cradling the back of his head, fingers tangling in his hair as he dips Cas and gives him the hell of a kiss he deserves.
Cas has half a mind to throttle Gabriel right here and now, archangel powers be damned.
Dean’d want to swipe the smugness off his face if it weren’t so attractive.
As Dean ushers Alex over to take a look at Cas' legs, Sam and Charlie divide everyone into their stupid groups. Although Alex can't do much more than cool the area of the burn with cold water and put gauze on it, Cas is grateful for the treatment. Holy fire is one of the more painful angel-harming weapons, and the wound will likely take a while to heal.
Tragically, the first time it happens, there isn’t a single useful book in the room. Which leaves Dean walking all the way to the library, naked from his head down to his toes.
It streamed into him, painfully slowly. It didn’t burn hot, like all the previous pains had. It was cold as ice, almost freezing the edges of his Grace. Everything slowed. His face felt as stone, eyelids drooping half-shut. It closed around his heart like a fist.
Dean grins. “Not
No joke, there’s a row of big, sharp white fangs mere inches from Dean’s face.
“I don’t sleep either.” The angel’s voice is very faint now, nothing of that mighty warrior pitch left in it and Dean’s heart aches for him. It must be terrifying, he thinks. Teetering so close to the edge.
But Dean smirks at him unrepentant. “If the roles were reversed, there would be some other stuck-up office douche on this bench with me,” he says. Lifts a shoulder in consideration. “Probably be making out by now.”
Cas frowns. Slowly, he tries to stand up, but Dean’s at his side in an instant, hand pressing against his shoulder in a silent command to take it easy. With no protest except for the scowl on his face, Cas lets himself be positioned against the headboard.
Wide-eyed and accompanied by at least ten chorused screams of alarm, Cas throws himself to the side. In the blink of an eye, the whole puddle of holy oil has caught fire right at the place where Cas had been standing mere seconds ago. He stares into the heat, willing his heart to slow its rapid beating despite the image of the dancing flames that burns itself into his retinas.
A plea dies in Cas’ throat and he wishes cosmic entities would make deals in which the ground may swallow up a desperate angel who’s experiencing the most mortifying moment of his eternal life.
Leaning down so their eyes were on the same level, Benny said, “I know a junkie when I see one, brother. Don’t matter your poison… Drugs, blood, something else – that’s just a technicality.”
Cas shakes off this train of thoughts and decides to answer Sam instead. Which isn’t easier since he has not much of a clue what he’s talking about. “Why would I want you to 'kick’ his 'ass’?”
the lion head, plus a dozen of wing-eyes, naturally – and there’s such a hopeful glimmer in his eyes (yes, all of them) that Dean’s heart aches for him. Only logical that he reach out with a comforting touch to Cas’ shoulder in order to quell that ache.
Dean barks out a laugh which he tries to cover with a cough as to not get caught eavesdropping. “Look what's Sammy getting himself into,” he whispers to Cas who just smiles sincerely.
“Well, lucky you,” Dean says, and Cas is no expert in social interaction, but that’s a weird way to respond to someone else’s accident, even to him.
With angels like Gabriel in their midst, however, it doesn’t stay calm for too long. Soon enough, 80s music is blasting from some unidentifiable source and the few of the more boisterous among their ragtag garrison are dancing over the ashes of their vanquished enemies.
“Good,” Dean says, taking another bite of his burger. “Good. I knew that.”
“It wasn't a resurrection,” comes the explanation from a voice Castiel had hoped to never hear again. “Because we were never dead in the first place.”
“I...,” Sam rasps out. “I thought you were dead. All of you.”
Furrowing his brow, Cas attempts to figure out what causes Dean’s hesitancy, if it’s regret or doubt or something else.. when he realizes that he just furrowed his brow and that’s his eyelids fluttering in reverberation of the pleasant dizziness that comes with Dean’s kiss. Which means he has regained control over his nerves and muscles which means that –
And he’s absolutely fucking okay with that.
Once Dean reaches the top of the stairs, he puts his arms around Cas' back as if Cas was about to faint any second now, muttering about how he's “gonna be fine”, and that “it's just a scratch” and his concern would be kind of sweet were it not so utterly misplaced.
“Did he read poetry to you?”
“The fuck is that,” Dean demands, holding a hand before his nose.
. And to think that’s only Winchester and his brother at the moment who are making all this noise, heads thrown back with laughter over something or other.
But he might’ve been onto something with the road trip thing being a bad idea.
If his condition had already improved so far that he could leave the hospital, Castiel wonders, maybe he let him have that win.
Dean scrunches up his nose. “What the fuck have you been drinkin’?” he asks, because Cas smells like a whole goddamn liquor store.
Instantly, he felt bigger, sturdier. Readier to take Dean’s repressed disappointment and Benny’s unabashed judgment. He didn’t remember having taken off his coat, so maybe Benny had, when he’d carried him into this room and deposited him on the bed to recover. Speaking of-
“Hmmmm,” murmurs Cas. He sounds sleepy, or as sleepy as an angel can get. Dean wonders if his attention span is still big enough that he’s listening.
Heat rises up Cas’ neck, and his eyes try to evade Dean’s gaze but it’s unrelenting, fixing him in place. “You
“Hmm.”
“Cas!” Dean interrupts, and despite himself, he laughs. “You were jealous?”
in here.
In any case, the (almost) unafraid touch to that part of him that’s new to Dean, makes Cas relax quite a bit. So far, in fact, that the fur under Dean’s palm begins to vibrate.
Except they do, Dean thinks, as he grabs Cas’ hand to pull him out into the hallway and towards his room. Good things do happen, and Dean’s determined to hold onto them for as long as he can.
Dean chuckles. “So, I’ll just–” Discarding the book, he strides back to their bed and plops on his back, makes a move to drag Cas over him. But Cas protests.
Castiel rolls his eyes, but that can’t stop his cheeks from heating up and unfortunately, it’s not something Gabriel misses. His eyes go wide and he waves a finger in Cas’ direction almost like in accusation. “Oh oh no! Tell me you didn’t! Did our dear little Cassie finally get his cherry popped by our good ol’ reliable righteous man?”
“Okay?”
“Tell me ‘bout it.”
“Ya know, all this talk about Dean – fascinating, don’t get me wrong, but the real question is, why did healing this one girl wear ya down so much, huh.” He shaped the question like a fact, so Castiel didn’t deem it necessary to reply.
None other than Crowley steps around the pile of hugging humans and into the metaphorical spotlight, running a hand over his chest and the impeccably tailored black suit covering it. “Excuse my impoliteness: Hello, boys.”
When Dean finally returns, it is with a dictionary in hand, a grin on his face and cock softened to half-hardness. Cas lets out an indignant whine that doesn’t seem to faze Dean at all.
Castiel sighs out an exasperation he doesn’t really feel and lifts a forkful of cake to his mouth. His eyes close at the rich taste. When he opens them again, Anna is watching him with a smirk on her face.
“OKAY!” yells Sam, no doubt on a mission to preserve his own sanity. “How about we split into groups to watch out for Cas and prevent this,” he waves his hand around in incomprehensible gestures. “Curse or whatever from killing him.”
”, he just enjoys this lightness and the smile seeing his friend puts on his face. That stupid weight that’s been dragging him downim during Cas’ absence is shoved far away for now, letting him breathe a little easier.
Allowing his gaze to slip away from Dean’s face, he says. “You already know. What else do you want to take from me?”
“Maybe,” Sam pipes up between their quarrel. “Uh. The curses are kind of contradictory, right? The first one, Cas dies if he gets too close to Dean-”
“Cas!”
Cas is raising a brow at him, Dean knows that as a fact without even dragging his eyes away from the road. “Do you.” The dryness of his voice makes it clear how absolutely moronic Cas thinks he is.
Cas licked his dry lips, a sign of nervousness he must have adopted somewhere along the way between falling, and flying, and falling again. “It overshadows my own.”
“Was not!”
That was the last one of the nest.
distracting.
But Dean Winchester may be the one person to hold a candle to this specific brand of stubbornness.
language.”
Absently (because his consciousness is preoccupied with ogling Dean), he overhears the conversation going on in the front seat.
“There's a special task force just to keep Cas from seducing Dean because turns out Cas can be a horny bastard if he puts his mind to it and Dean is a weak, weak man.” Charlie adds helpfully, effectively upsetting Cas’ plans who slumps into his chair at the realization.
He receives a glare for that, but with his leg trapped in a cast there is no other way for Winchester to protest. Getting up on his own would be even more of a process for him than it was for Castiel. Which is what he is counting on.
He knew, logically, that he’d cross paths with Dean again, that he’d have to confront whatever his deathbed confession had rendered their relationship. He knows, as well, that he’d rather be by Dean’s side as his friend, his confidante, than be nothing at all to him because he’s been parted from Dean before and he knows how it feels and he’d rather tether himself to a man who has his heart but knows not what to do with it than be set adrift. He’d rather live in his periphery than just watch from behind glass because Cas has grown fond of living amongst humans too much to be satisfied with just watching anymore. He wants to touch, to feel, to experience, even if it’s just through friendly taps on the shoulder, through long rides in the backseat of a black car.
“Your thing is a gas-eating deathtrap on four wheels.”
“You asshole, I’m getting a cold!”
Castiel pressed both hands on either of their heads, brushing past the sweat-soaked hair to get to the pain underneath. His Grace found their ripped skin and fractured bones. It mended their wounds and sutured their skin and it stilled their cries.
In a way Dean’ll dispute to his dying day, a string of embarrassing giggles rushes out of his mouth at that. “Shit, Cas, you well and truly rocked my world.”
The place with mysterious warding turns out to be an abandoned warehouse.
In all his time on Earth alongside the Winchesters, he has never seen so many living women in one room. They are not exclusively women. But they present a majority that is worth taking note of.
Cas frowns. Clearly, complimenting the physique of your lover’s brother crosses some kind of social boundaries he had not previously been aware of. He takes a mental note of it, but decides that avoiding a repeat offense isn’t a priority since the good (making Sam feel good about his body image) outweighs the bad (annoying Dean) in this case. Maybe Cas’ judgment stems from his frustration towards Dean’s unwillingness to resume the new intimacy of their developing relationship, however, and he is doing wrong by Dean.
“Dungeons haven’t been customary for centuries,” Castiel informs him.
“Her name was Gina by the way.”
A small smile slips onto Cas’ face, there and gone again, but not unseen. “Of course.”
Charlie grins, pleased. “Thanks, I try.”
When Cas makes to open his mouth to explain, Dean cuts in before he can and says, much more gently to make up for the gruff, panicked tone from earlier,
“You know we could hear everything,” Rachel breaks the awkward silence and gestures to her ear. “Angel hearing.”
Huge, black shimmering wings are jutting out of Cas’ shoulder blades. And despite the careful, chivalrous distance he’s keeping from Dean since the dramatic reaction of the latter, one of the wings is still draped over a great portion of Dean’s body.
“Sure you do. I even did the voice and all.”
Cas falls quiet, looking down at his hands which are folded in his lap. “I don’t talk like that.”
Dean Winchester into The Angel’s business, you just get out of the way when he slays his way over to 'im.” He spread his arms in a grand gesture. “This is me, gettin’ outta the way.”
Cas moves to cradle Dean’s face, and it takes Dean a moment to realize that the touch doesn’t come from Cas’ hand but from his wing. He presses his face against the feathers, soaking in the feeling of comfort that is just as strong like this as it is coming from human limbs and skin.
He can’t move anything but his eyes in their sockets and this immobility is so terrifying, it immediately goes on the list of his most traumatizing phobias.
“One minute and forty-two seconds,” Cas clarifies, and, figures.
Winchester’s attention feels like a headache all by itself, his eyes that of a vulture, just waiting for the right moment to peck Castiel’s own eyes out. He doesn’t know if it’s genuine concern or malicious glee at seeing Cas like this. Doesn’t know which he’d prefer.
He reached out his hand, let his Grace flow through her body, followed all the nooks and crannies of the spider webs and, very delicately,
Inefficient not because he doesn’t trust the doctors and nurses to do their job – on the contrary, Castiel holds high regard for the professions of the medical sector. No, it is rather because being entrapped in a hospital room the size of a closet on an uncomfortable hospital bed and no reliable internet connection bereaves Castiel of all sensible opportunities for applying himself to his work.
And then Dean’s feeling it. That all-consuming warmth coursing through his body at Cas’ touch. The gash on his cheek closes, his sprained wrist stops being a problem and he hadn’t even noticed how splitting his headache was until Cas took it from him.
“I wasn’t done looking. At your wings, I mean,” explains Dean, making impatient gestures with his hands. “C’mon bring ‘em back over.”
“Sure don't look that way,” Winchester comments, but Castiel has already removed his attention from him, trying to breathe through his nose in a way that he hopes will make the panic attack recede.
, really?”
Dean gets nailed into the mattress like he’s an effigy Cas needs to get absolutely right and all he can do is grip the sheets between his fingers and hold on for dear life. He doesn’t even need to do anything. Just lie there and take it.
Things get hazy from there on out.
Dean grins. “You so were!”
It's thanks to this closeness that Cas notices a change in Dean, some air that's stuck in his lungs and pressed out in a long exhale.
“Nothing we couldn't take on, though,” says another woman who must be one of Sam's acquaintances because he identifies her as 'Alicia'. (He stutters out an unnecessary and quite incomprehensible explanation involving post-hunt adrenaline and one-night-stands). “Thankfully, we had the help of an, uh. King of Hell?”
What happens next, he could not have possibly foreseen and should in no way be held against him.
He’s mostly wrong, of course.
Cas might appreciate their banter more if he weren’t stuck in a paralysis on the floor. Although Dean thought to tuck a soft pillow under his head, which is needless but very thoughtful of him and if it could, Cas’ heart would swell at the notion.
And Cas can't not lean forward to get a taste of that smile.
Cas extends a finger to Dean's forehead and in the blink of an eye, they're in Dean's room in the Bunker. Dean will complain about constipation later, but it will be worth it since they're finally getting laid.
“I mean, you guys basically just fight all the time,” he goes on. “Imagine that on an eight hour car ride where neither of you can escape when things get rough.”
To its credit, it seems to be doing everything it can to look considerably less threatening than it did just a few seconds ago, what with its mouth now shut, and backed off on the mattress as far as the width of Dean’s bed allowed.
When Dean looks up at him, a frown painting his expression one of confusion, Cas’ hand finds its spot on Dean’s right shoulder and he squeezes once. “Then
Dean, who still looks a little pale (though he blames it on the harsh Bunker lighting), rubs a hand up and down Cas' back, which is nice, and when Cas makes to descend the stairs again to welcome their guests into their humble abode, insists on carrying Cas down bridle-style, which is less nice and more, as they say, 'overkill'.
Before Dean can give him another hint about what he actually wants, his brother gives an amused snort from where he’s sitting at the other side of the table. “He’s asking you to spend the night in his room.”
“Uh, what?”
“Aw, hell, you know how to make a guy blush, Cas.”
“Sam’s fine, he’s getting us some fast food,” assures Dean.
You are my salvation.
“Deeaaan!” he whines, but Dean is still thumbing through the collection of books, trying to find the right language combination. “French,” Cas says. “
“Proper
“Healing,” answered Cas finally.
close to ending it all for him. Since Benny had stepped in despite what Castiel presented for him.
And it’s crazy how these two words are enough to settle Dean’s whirling thoughts.
And then he leans forward.
“Uh, I don’t know, maybe because you two are dating?”
“Is that a friggin’
“Mm-hm.”
Cas wakes up after ten hours of sleep he shouldn’t need, and squints into the dimmed lighting of the room. To the immense relief of one Dean Winchester, who’s been sitting beside the bed for every minute of those hours.
“Dean.”
?” If drinking is the next bad habit Cas picks up from him, Dean might have to turn himself in.
“I don’t-” Cas starts. Dude’s always been a crappy liar.
Castiel had wanted to ask since Purgatory, since that Leviathan got
A corner of Cas’ mouth twitches. It feels unfamiliar, to smile. “Thank you,” he says softly.
“What’s that mean?”
It doesn’t take long for Dean to realize how strategically positioned his hand is, for more than just to hold Cas there.
The vampire snorted, and now Castiel could open his eyes wide enough to notice the strain around Benny’s jaw, the tension in the arms he had crossed over his chest. “You should thank me, ya know,” Benny claimed. “Could ‘of been any other day that I’d come collect my blood ration. Any other hospital. But no, it’s on the same day, the same hospital that you crazy bonehead decide to – what the hell’ve ya been doin’ in there anyway?”
And always.
“I fell out of a window.”
He sounded at least a bit angry, but his tone was lowered to a strangely soft growl. It was nice, his voice.
He commanded armies. He has the history of the Earth ingrained in his very being.
Dean's eyes are suspiciously wet, and his voice sounds laden with raw emotion as he asks, “How are you alive? Who-”
“I will not make a sound.”
“Ironic,” Castiel rasped out. “Of you to say that.”
But Cas isn’t interested in deflection. His expression is as earnest as ever when he returns Dean’s gaze. “Being caught before I fell.”
he says whenever Dean urges him to just
stuck-up office douche.”
two assholes on a roadtrip. Dean PoV
Flexing his hand to assure himself of the presence of his angel blade against his Grace, Cas prepares himself for this hunt, when Dean's hand on his chest stops him in his tracks.
. I don’t understand why you’re taking such an interest.”
“Come on, Cas,” she says, mirth in her eyes as she elbows him gently in the side. “Live a little.” And with that, she shoves his plate with chocolate cake closer towards him.
Instantly, Dean presses a hand to Castiel’s chest, shoves at him in a gesture that urges Cas to look at him. Their eyes lock, the warm earthy green around Dean’s pupil shining with wonder.
The bed, as well as the wall it gets knocked into at every other thrust are wiped from the plane of existence that makes up Dean’s new universe. The weapons attached to the wall above the headboard follow suit. Dean doesn’t care. Because they’re not important anymore.
Hugs are exchanged all around, and once Cas regains Dean's attention, he decides to be 'that little shit', but Dean beats him to it, “Let me guess, you're itching to deal out your 'I told you so'.”
“I can give you that, y'know?” Cas blurts nearly incoherently, so Dean has to pay extra attention to catch every word.
Holding back a sigh, Cas nods his assent and Dean perks up. “Great!” He waves a careless greeting in the vague direction of the other angels as he grabs Cas hand to drag him out the door. “Good to see y’all. Happy resurrection! Not to the dick angels, you know who you are. Oh hey, looking good, Anna! Seeya ‘round!”
Cas raises an eyebrow at her. Before he can ask, she’s grabbed his chin and turned his head slightly to the right and–
“Really,” Cas says dryly.
These are the things he wants to ask.
“If you’re,” Dean says between breaths he begs to come more steadily. “If you’re asking about your performance, you’re not as smart as I thought you were.”
And yet…
Dean barks a laugh. “Gotta tell ya, buddy. For all that you’re supposed to be this perfect heavenly choir boy, you don’t let yourself believe in a whole lot, do you?”
And then, before Cas can beginn to process this, Dean lets go of his arms to give him a firm shove in the chest. “You asshole! You don’t get to spill all your stupid feelings to me and then fuck off to– to– You don’t get to do this and leave me behind and then tell me how I should feel about that! I don’t have to pretend? Well, that’s great, Cas, because I was never good at following the script and if I want you to fucking
Sitting up, Cas chases Dean’s contact before he can withdraw, clasps his hand between his own and clutches it against his chest. “Dean,” he says, voice matching Dean’s low tone.
In answer, he gets a not less cryptic, “I can be that for you,” before Cas lifts his head a few inches so his big puppy eyes can look right into Dean’s and
Cas regrets bringing it up, but the future of their epic romance is at stake. “Cassie Robinson?”
“What happened to you anyway?” Dean asks after a prolonged moment of silence, gesturing towards Cas’... everything.
The second kiss is much more satisfying. As is their third. And their fourth.
ask about that. Later. But right now he just sends a spurt of Grace through the hand and savours the shudder that sends through Dean as well as the shy smile that paints Dean’s face even redder.
But Cas doesn’t seem in the mood to listen. “I can give you… tail,” he says, testing the turn of phrase skeptically, and it makes Dean laugh.
“Tuna salad sandwich,” Cas replies with angelic innocence. “Organic.”
“Angels are warriors,” Cas growls, licking a salacious stripe up the underside of his dick as he oh so diligently proves him wrong. “Soldiers,” he adds, tongue making a detour around Dean’s balls and Dean arches his back at the touch. “We have a mission and we pursue it thoroughly. Vigorously.”
“I’m watching out for Dean,” Benny added, softer this time, in a way Cas had never heard it directed at him, not from the vampire. “Means I also have to watch out for
“Hey now,” Dean makes to defend him, but Cas isn’t done with his confession time yet.
, but all the words in his throat and in his mind and in his heart are swallowed up by Dean’s mouth that crashes into his.
A tickling sensation against his cheek wakes Dean up the next day. It’s a long and pleasant dream he surfaces from, feeling so well-rested as he hasn’t in pretty much forever. That’s why it takes him an uncharacteristically long time to pull himself out of sleepy disorientation.
“If you didn’t at least see him like Dad created him I’m gonna have to slap you, Cassie!”
“Alcohol,” Cas provides helpfully, and then, “Lots of it,” like Dean couldn’t have guessed.
“Eileen,” Dean says, if for Castiel's sake or to comprehend the reality of the situation, Cas can't tell. “And... Sarah Blake?”
“If you step out of this car, Novak, I swear I’ll leave you in this godforsaken town and you can
Sarah smirks at the surprise on Sam's face. “What? You think we can't have our fun without you, Sam?”
They listen to Zeppelin as Cas leads them back onto the highway.
By the way he slides a little closer on the bed, pressing his knee against Dean’s, though, maybe it’s a good thing after all.
But before he can say anything else, Charlie pipes up. “Uh, hey Scooby Gang? Sorry to interrupt but there's kind of thing going on over in Wichita,” she holds up her phone for everyone to see, which shows some kind of red alert that Cas can't make sense of.
So he turned his attention to the survivors, the humans that had been abused as prey for the vampires to feed on. They looked like death; the side of it that was merciless and brutal and excruciating. Crusted blood glued the strands of their hair together, large gashes separated the skin on various parts of their bodies and when Castiel looked more closely, beyond what was visible to the human eye, he recognized severe internal damages as well.
to hide part of my True Face from your capacity of perception. And then you woke up, and it was too late. It is incompetent and unforgivable, and I apologize for my sluggishness. It will not happen again, I promise you.”
“He comes from a conservative family.”
“Sure, I can see you not-caring all over the pub’s shrinking stock of booze,” Sam huffs at him. “Cas, you never drink.”
And it feels like an apology.
The feathers are soft to the touch, and pretty and delicate though they look, Dean judges them impressively resilient. It only makes sense, considering what they probably had to go through in Cas’ epic angelic battles.
can drive.”
“Driver picks the music, Cas, them’s the rules!” Dean reminds him firmly.
, why do they always seem to be a different shade of agonizing blue?
“Jesus, Cas,” he wheezes. “Holy shit! You scared me!”
Sam doesn’t get the relationship he has with Cas. Because Cas, for him, is stored in his memory as the rude as fuck patient everyone in the corridor was trying to avoid. They’re like sprinkling oil into a kitchen fire, Sam says.
Next stop: Miami.
“Are you sure this is a good idea?” Sam stands with his arms crossed over his chest, looking down to his brother like the very picture of disapproval, signalling to him that
“I fell onto a car,” Cas says. If Dean doesn’t want to talk about how he got his leg ‘nearly squashed’, Cas thinks, he doesn’t have to. “I suppose that counts as a ‘car accident’ as well.”
“Did I what now?” Dean almost actually turns to check – hey, stranger things have happened – but then it dawns on him that Cas is still a weirdo, even after all these years. “You mean 'chase tail’?” He chuckles. “Nah, didn’t get lucky today, I guess.” It’s a lie that he doesn’t know why he tells but not like Cas is in any shape for an adult conversation right now anyway.
. Learned that way back when.”
“Ugh, I hate her.”
If he turned his head to the side, he’d see Dean’s eyes flit from one side to the other, unseeing, as he tried to piece together various shreds of information.
Now Benny just shrugged again. “Do I look like a monster to ya?”
“You gotta be more careful”, Dean spoke again, his eyes narrowing at the way his concern made Castiel grin lopsidedly.
“Jesus, you’re heavy,” is Dean’s way to excuse his lack of muscle power.
Somewhere at their periphery, Eileen responds to Sam's laments about how much time they've wasted with, “I'm actually happy all this happened.”
“I did, in fact,” Cas says back, calm as anything, as if his heart isn’t beating like a jackrabbit against his ribcage from the unexpected halt. “And since you pulled up already,” he continues on this perilous path, unbuckles his seat belt. “We can now find someone to give us the directions.”
“A crime against nature, that’s what it is.” Dean fake-gags a couple times in the hopes of spoiling Cas’ appetite.
Cas sighs. Which is not a denial, so Dean counts it as a win.
Yeah, he could really get used to this, falling asleep beside Cas.
That tension around Cas’ jaw is slowly starting to reappear. “I am not a noble.”
“Dean.”
He closes his eyes, and pretends to be asleep for the rest of the visitors’ stay.
“It’s not actually a lion,” corrects Cas helpfully. “It’s… well, to be truthful, its Enochian name wouldn’t be perceptible by your ears, so there is not much point in lecturing you about it. At any rate, the
It’s a short-lived moment of happiness, however, because once he’s healed, Cas moves to retrieve his hand, if reluctantly.
He doesn’t answer. There’s nothing
He looks at Cas, who is probably the one person who’s even less versed in “relationship stuff” than Dean is. Right. Who’s he asking.
,” Cas argues pitifully, not even bothering to try and put real authenticity into his tone. The way his thighs are still pressed close to Dean’s even as he tries to play butthurt betrays his lie.
The voice was familiar, but unexpected in this setting. Even without being aware of his surroundings, Castiel knew that much. The last time he’d seen him, Benny couldn’t wait to be wherever Castiel wasn’t. And the feeling had been mutual.
“This is absurd!” Cas laments. “There's a technologically gifted hacker in this room, a former prophet of the lord, two sheriffs, a powerful witch, a former student of an American elite university, as well as the best man I've ever met and yet I am here, doomed to listen to all this bullshit.”
is even better, as it turns out.
It doesn’t need to be said through words. Judging by the hopeful gleam in his eyes, realization seems to be dawning on Dean.
“Dean-”
“Part of it,” Dean agrees. “I didn’t exactly have time to make a list or the guts to actually say it out loud but uhm. Yeah.” His shoulders lift in a helpless shrug like
Cas orders apple pie to-go and hands it to Dean. Dean hands him the car keys in return. As they leave the diner, Cas hooks an arm under Dean’s and rests his head on his shoulder briefly.
“Can you please stop saying 'Dean's penis',” begs Sam.
It’s fun.
He doesn’t know for a tormenting few minutes during which Cas’ eyes are still trained firmly on him, waiting for an answer like it’s the most important question in the universe how Cas can change his personality to be more pleasing for Dean and
“I am ready.”
has the sense to not get his ribs and head fucked up.” Then: “
Feeling suddenly weary, worse than when he first woke up in the hospital bed, Cas returned his gaze. “You’re so very aware aren’t you.”
Sitting and watching grass grow on earth for a few billion years suddenly doesn’t compare to the impatience that rises inside Cas at the prospect of not feeling Dean’s naked, heated skin against his’ for several more hours.
“Yeah,” Dean agrees. “Not many. Probably not. But hey, more for me!”
It’s a bit awkward, trying to hug both heads and the body they’re attached to at the same time, especially when there’s also wings involved, but Dean tries anyway. After Cas wraps his wings around the messy pile of bodies they’ve created, it’s actually pretty cozy. Dean could happily stay like this for a while.
Everyone but Castiel.
Sam raises his brows in consideration. “Sleeping Beauty?” he huffs. “Didn't think Cas was the type.”
In the aftermath, there’s a sense of uncertainty.
Beside him, Anna shrugs happily. “Just trying it out, little brother.”
He'll apply for a life membership of the heavenly choir, and gladly, if that's what it gets him.
“No, there must’ve been a kiss
“Hey, Cas?”
“It would be a shame if the last your ass saw was-”
To Hell.
A few minutes later, Dean Winchester strides right into Castiel’s room like he owns the whole hospital and Castiel wonders if Doctor Milton downplayed things because his head injury must surely be giving him hallucinations now.
But this was only physical pain. It would not endure for long against the thrum of his Grace.
Lines of confusion appear on Cas’ forehead and it’s so cute Dean can’t believe this dork is the same one that turned into a sex machine just moments before Dean found Paradise. “It was good then?” He wants to make sure.
Dean’s eyes look like they’re about to jump out of their sockets. “Dude.”
“Anytime, buddy,” Dean promises, and lifts his hand to Cas’ right shoulder, squeezes once. “Anytime.”
Suddenly, the blanket over his body is feeling too hot. He feels like a chicken in a coop, it’s too
Savoring the sensation, Dean’s eyelids flutter close and a contented sigh escapes his lungs before he can stop it.
When Doctor Milton stops by to let him know his ribs are healing well without posing any more danger towards his lungs but she’s still worried about his head trauma and would like him to continue therapy with a physician, she has a smile on her face the whole time. It’s not good news to Castiel, so he doesn’t know why she would be so excited for him.
Having had a taste of it, Cas finds a new meaning in physical closeness. It’s comforting and exhilarating at the same time, and like Icarus to his hybris, he is already addicted. He could make himself a home in Dean’s arms, if Dean wasn’t under the misguided impression that he was the sun. Bright and shining and so very, very
“I’m not a-” Cas tries to protest, but is interrupted by Dean brushing his fingers through Cas’ mane, which causes the purring to grow louder.
So Cas nodded, the motion causing Dean’s hair to tickle his cheek.
Cas had been so distracted by their conversation, by the numbness that had settled around him that he hadn’t even noticed the hunter’s approach. Dean nodded towards him, lips pressed together tightly. “Cas.”
Claire and the Donna are waiting for them in front of the entrance, and they wave at them with their weapons. “Took you long enough,” Claire comments with a cheekiness that Dean often attributes to the impertinence of ‘this goddamn generation’.
Before Dean can protest against the implied insult to his Baby, Cas replies, “Sam drove very carefully,” which he thinks defends the car’s virtue enough without hurting Sam’s feelings at the same time.
He’d stand up and go to the corridor, but his ribs are still hurting even just trying to sit up and he can’t let that weakness slip towards his boss.
like you
And stays right where he is.
That seems to pull Cas out of his pleading spell. Remembering to feign indifference, he huffs, and rolls off of Dean, folding his arms in front of his chest. “Noooo!” He drawls.
Dean jumps back on the bed, straddling Cas’ thighs. “I did,” he claims. “Several times. You weren’t
“Dude, that’s not a bad thing at all, that’s a,” Dean snaps his fingers, trying to summon the word he’s looking for. “That’s a
It hit him as a wave. The evidence of human fragility, multiplied by two. Castiel welcomed it into him, soaked himself in it, his veins burning hot with it and his eyes filling with tears.
Cas, meanwhile, is standing there, feeling little more than a tickle in the area of his stomach, and wondering if being surrounded by fucking idiots might be a just punishment for all the sins he's committed in his life. If so, he'd rather rot in hell if Chuck asked him, but of course he never would.
Once Cas had regained his wit, he’d wasted no time. With big strides he’d bridged the gap between them and aligned their bodies, pressed all up in Dean's personal space for a slow but sure symphony of lips and tongues.
“I’m… practicing an exchange of energy,” he began. “When I heal, I channel my grace into the wounded body, and instead of laying waste of the broken parts, I… I channel them over to mine.”
, Cas wants to tell him.
Cas tilts his head, wanting to inquire more, but Charlie continues.
“Alright, Mr Workaholic.”
“Heya, grumpy,” Dean greets, waving a brown paper bag in his hands. “I come bearing gifts.
“There are deviations, of course, victims that were just not attracted to men for example and therefore not prone to Sam or Dean's
“Anyway, I’ll head out.”
Dean arranges the bottles of water and beer in the cooler before loading the whole thing into the backseat of his car.
Cas’ smile must betray his lie because Dean slaps him on the arm. “You asshole, I bought you a fucking burger!”
He needs to open the window.
“Hey, Cas,” he says, just to make this whole thing more real.
“Plural.”
?” No one but Balthazar has ever called him that, at least not in that same fond tone Anna's applying. He looks over to where his estranged brother is twirling a glass of wine in his hands and indulges the twinge of pain from the unresolved conflict between them. Maybe, someday, they’ll get to repair that relationship.
This decision is met with no protests, so Bunker it is.
When he made to stand up, Dean offered him a hand.
The trauma she must have endured, it was all gone. Castiel swallowed it all into the black hole in his stomach, in his chest, until it swallowed him whole.
and he maneuvers them farther onto the bed, attempting for a more comfortable cuddle arrangement, letting his fingers card through the angel’s tousled hair. “You have no
Dean steers Baby to the side and jams on the brakes so hard, they’re both catapulted forwards before the seat belt throws them back into the seat. Behind them, someone yells obscenities and a car honks angrily as it passes them.
When Cas just eyes the plate in suspicion, she rolls her eyes. “Come on, Cassie, we’ve just returned from the dead, let’s enjoy the perks of human life for a little while, hm?” Anna says, miracling herself her own slice of chocolate cake.
It’s passionate.
By the way Cas says it, Dean really can’t tell if that’s supposed to be a good or a bad thing.
Balthazar snorts. “Of course not, our Cassie is more
Cas nudges him. “They’re the good ones.”
“Listen, uhm,” Dean starts, running a hand through his hair in a move that – can it be he’s nervous? “Can we, heh. Move this somewhere else?” He throws a pointed look around the room full of heavenly voyeurs.
Maybe there’s such a thing as the calm
“That's right, darling,” affirms Crowley, the usual overly proud smirk on his face that Cas wants to knock right off.
Cas shrugs. “He was still able to run away, so I suppose he’s fine.
“Look, man,” Benny said. “I just thought Dean’d like to know why you passed out on a hospital floor, creeping over some girl in the psych ward. Least I could do. No matter how low a’ me you think.”
Cas shifts in his seat, impatient. “
Castiel harbors a great dislike for hospitals.
“No, it’s…” Dean cuts in before he has to hear another of those sad, misguided apologies. “Just takes some getting used to, ya know?”
they do.
But he might’ve been onto something with the road trip thing being a bad idea.
“Hey, he's plenty beautiful!” Dean defends his honor.
Dean’s by his side in an instant, checking for injuries with the air of someone who thinks having watched all those episodes of Dr. Sexy automatically gives him the qualifications of a health-care professional. While Dean frets over him, Sam and Charlie check the book carefully, only daring to touch it after producing some gloves for safety.
“Jesus Christ,” remarks Sam.
as you know it was created in this image.”
thing is the car that brings us places,” Dean reminds him, and he likes to think this line of argumentation gains him the upperhand.
But it’s Anna who saves him. Strong, clever, lovely Anna who steers him away from the crowd of atrocious angels and sits him down at a table. “Give him a break.”
It was all he knew how to be.
, it startles a choked laugh out of Cas.
“Cas, you have giant wings with terrifying eyes on them, and a second head in the shape of a predator. What hunter doesn’t dream of baggin’
He licks his lips and considering they’ve been on Cas’ a second earlier, Cas’ gaze drops to track the movement. It’s an instinctive reaction that evades Cas’ control so completely, he hates himself a little for it.
Donna's eyes are wide, and as secretive as she tries to be, Cas gauges the pending confrontation largely nonthreatening. Whatever's in there will likely already be dealt with and won't require high defense precautions, so he lowers his blade – but doesn't let go of it completely.
Dean waited until Benny’s footsteps faded away, and only then did he turn around. “Cas-”
“I’m sure he knows. Grapevine says it’s what brought him to the Empty after all, right, Cassie?” Balthazar’s tone is light but his eyes reverberate the ache in Cas’ chest at the memory of their shredded bond, and Castiel wants to reach out, to make amends, but it’s not the time.
Rolling his eyes, Cas already makes up his mind to leave this stupid place after downing this drink, and continuing at another venue.
Dean’s spotted him already when Cas walks up to him, and he’s watching him approach with an unreadable expression on his face. His feet seem glued to the spot.
Sam doesn’t get the relationship he has with Cas. He’d been totally dumbstruck when Dean told him that his asshole hospital roommate was now also his asshole romantic partner. He’d been seconds away from suggesting his head be scanned in case his leg wasn’t the only thing damaged in the car accident.
Cas himself hasn’t gotten that memo yet, though, it seems, because with one clumsy move he presses himself closer to Dean, snakes his arms around his waist and
and it’s only then that Cas notices the redness rising to Dean’s own cheeks. For all his bravado, Dean’s actually… what? Scared of rejection? After all the ways in which Cas has laid bare his heart for him?
“Anyway, what these guys here accomplished,” and here Jody gestures at the whole group of presumed dead friends and acquaintances. “is wearing down the warding that kept them inside these four walls as defenseless prisoners until it stopped working and they could finally fight back. They got rid of him before we even got here. At least we arrived soon enough to get wind of the whole situation before they could scatter in all directions.”
Dean blinks at him, but he does not retreat. “Please what?”
A hand on his forehead rips Dean out of his thoughts, and he gives a start, hand already flying to the knife in his boot before he realizes who the foreign hand is attached to.
“Benny?” The name leaves Dean's mouth like a plea. Cas looks at him. From all the losses Dean had to suffer, he hadn't realized the disappearance of the vampire had hit him this hard.
“They’re fine.” The answer trickled out of him as though he was underwater. He pointed a finger into the vague direction where he thought the siblings were sitting, now upright again, gasping, and holding onto one another with renewed life.
“Uhm, Cas? You comin’?”
Prepping Dean is a task Cas takes very seriously, and that’s one area where he won’t budge.
“Never mind,” he says. “Point is: You’re showing me a side of yourself you haven’t dared to show me ever before, that’s a huge ego boost for me! And look at me, dude, I love what you got! The wings, the whiskers – the whole nine. So there’s the ego boost for you. It’s a win–win.”
But Sam interrupts his impending torrent of curses. “See, that’s what I mean.” He gestures between the two of them as if presenting the key piece of evidence in court. “I’m giving you guys two hours,” he decides. “By then I’ll probably be scraping one of your’s remains off some street in the middle of nowhere.”
He’s be more relieved if that weren’t the exact same time when Winchester’s whole entourage pays him a visit.
me with the natural look, that’s healthy relationship stuff, right?”
And that voice he knows, because that’s Cas’ voice, and the synapses in Dean’s brain are working rapidly to figure out what Cas’ voice is doing in his room so early in the morning and how that relates to the big lion head that’s still lurking next to him.
Finally, he moves his face so only his cheek is pressed against Dean’s stomach, allowing for better intelligibility. “It is not important, because I’m not going to speak at all from now on. In
Cas nodded meekly.
When he came to, it was in a daze.
Cas raises his brow. “Both?”
“Cas”, the surface said, and it didn’t sound like a surface at all. It sounded like Dean. “You dumbass. You shouldn’t jump right into this, I said – goddammit, Cas.”
“Well, even if such a curse existed and it befell whoever enters an intimate relationship with either Sam or Dean... I'm not exactly defenseless. I assure you, I don't need a bodyguard, much less several.”
“Can I?” Dean remembers to ask, not wanting to dive into the feathers without the owner’s specific consent. Who knows what the etiquette for wing touching is between angels, and even so, sticking a finger at somebody’s body parts unasked is just generally rude.
answer.
Dean slides onto the seat opposite him without a word. The waitress comes over and he orders a bacon cheese burger with chilli fries and a coke and waits for his food to arrive.
Dean whistles. “Michael doesn’t deserve your loyalty, if you ask me.”
“Dean, it really is just a scratch,” says Cas. “A regular gun shot can't kill me, see? It's already healing.”
The words burst through the barricades that make up Cas’ willpower, his need to share them stronger and more coercive than any of his age-old restraint.
In order not to give the man any ideas, Castiel ignores him expertly. He clenches his jaw and stares at the wall opposite, which is white and unassuming, a reassuring opposite to Winchester’s brash personality.
Face unreadable, Cas meets his gaze. “We have to go back and take the second exit on the highway,” he offers.
“There’s more than one.”
Dean seems to agree, because once all eyes land on him with an expectation that’s almost palpable, his Adam’s apple bops and he lifts a hand to rub at the back of his neck in an awkward motion. “Uhh…” He plasters on a grin that might fool strangers but certainly not anyone in this room.
Technically, he doesn’t need to breathe, but basic human necessities like that have woven themselves into his own fabric of natural instincts long ago.
Upon closer inspection, he also notices that the lion head isn’t even the weirdest thing about early-morning-Cas.
“He does,” Cas says. “That’s no excuse to dawdle.”
“Crude,” someone beside him gives voice to Castiel’s thoughts. In contrast to Castiel, however, a shark-like grin is gracing Uriel’s face. “I like it.”
So when have Dean’s stupid girly, one-sided feelings become Cas’ problem too?
Dean narrows his eyes at him. “I’m gonna drive us places with shit to no WiFi,” he decides and nods, satisfied with his retribution.
“I would, if you'd stop
Dean Winchester is loud.
her. I told you.” Benny made it sound like he was being indecent, and the mere thought appalled Cas.
With a nod of his head, Benny dismissed his thanks, but the warm smile on his face betrayed his own gratitude. “I’ll take you up on that, brother.”
“Got a few missing pieces,” Benny admitted. “Why you came to a hospital for instance. And what the fuck you been doin’ to that girl-”
Arriving at the bottom, Dean lets him down, and they all make their way over to the War Room tables where Sam and Charlie are hunched over a chaotic arrangement of laptops and books. Even the loud gun shot seems not to have roused them from concentration. Kevin has joined them with a cup of coffee, though he appears not to be involved in their work at all.
. Maybe, if two curses with such opposite meanings overlap,” muses Sam, “one neutralizes the other, and… and they go-”
Dean dips his chin to hide his grin against his chest. Leave it to Cas to confess his feelings by saying the opposite.
He figured a hospital would do well enough to allay his hunger.
For a frightening moment, the idea of him dying because of some curse lying on the Winchesters' nether regions becomes an actual possibility to him, and in a sudden internal burst of theatrics, he considers signaling a quick I-love-you to Dean and to ask him to tell Claire,
and how very much
“It’s just a burger, dude, it won’t bite,” Dean says, nodding towards the still untouched paper bag.
This is how he had been last night, too. After he’d shouted his lungs out about how
Once they’ve closed the door behind them, the anticipation of the first night they’ll spend together as a couple hits Dean unabatedly. As he attempts to deal with the roller coaster in his head, Dean can barely do more than stand there and stare.
Dean, please come back here.”
The other man grins insolently. “No, but I can read.” He points towards the name tag on the foot of Castiel’s bed. “You know mine?”
“Excuse me, can you repeat that?” Cas holds a hand over the ear that is more exposed to the Winchester clan’s bickering. “No, I’ve… I will send it to you as soon as possible, I- what?”
Said hunter-slash-werewolf looks like a deer in headlights who just realized what he thought was a car racing towards it had in fact been the moon all along. “No,” he says, exhaling a heavy breath. “No, I didn't even know there's such a thing as angel killing bullets! Phew, Cas, I'm so glad you're healing. We really both escaped death there, huh, because for a minute there I thought for sure, 'Dean's gonna kill me for this', ha ha!”
“You’re impossible, Dean Winchester.”
When Dean pulls back, he’s the one who can’t look Cas in the eye.
“It’s not as bad as it sounds,” Cas tried to placate.
“He was hard to kill, though,” says Eileen, frowning at the white male, heterosexual corpse on the ground. “He kept coming back for no evident reason.”
doing
“Don't worry, Dean, we got him covered!” promises Donna, and as if on silent command, everyone draws their daggers, guns, flamethrowers, and in Rowena's case, just wiggles with her hand in a dramatic show of purple sparks.
It is frustrating, to say the least.
“I don’t ‘babble’. And besides, it can hardly be ‘behind your back’ if you’re right in front of me,” Cas argues.
But the boy and the girl – siblings, Castiel noted after a brief skimming of their consciousness – were writhing on the floor, faintly crying out the pain and sorrow that was finally, finally heard.
His confrontation with the cursed spindle book has had it’s perks that way, he muses. Because now Dean has abandoned any and all qualms that made him keep his distance. In fact, he has deliberately chosen to sit in the back seat beside Castiel while Sam drives the Impala.
“Which is soggy and clogging my arteries which probably means this is all an elaborate plan to murder me.”
It seems to be Jody's complete household that greets him, Donna and the girls; plus a skinny looking guy who must be Garth, and Rowena of all people.
Castiel’s deep chuckles send vibrations through both their bodies.
When Dean reaches out a hand to touch them, though, Cas retrieves and folds them behind his back in one swift move.
Dean builds up the required strength to lift his head and kiss Cas on the nose. “More than,” he assures. “Fuck, I think I even blacked out for a second there.”
On second thought, Castiel will have to retract his statement. The worst part about hospital stays isn’t the inefficiency. It’s the people you have to endure because they are hospitalised with you in the same patient’s room.
“I was only healing a young woman.”
Jesus, Cas either is just that blind or he needs that praise like a drowning man needs air.
“Guys,” he says, raising his Voice into a higher frequency for all his brethren to hear. “We don’t have time for this.”
Another perk of angel sex? You don’t play by the rules of human libido anymore. One spark of Cas’ grace to Dean’s pelvis, and the show can go on.
He swings his feet off the bed and stands, gritting his teeth against the throbbing in his head, the pain in his chest.
A nuisance, an obstacle between Benny and freedom.
The whole Winchester clan, who has previously been busy discussing the state of the flowers on Winchester’s side of the room, is now directing their attention to Cas as well. It makes him uncomfortable, to be the focus of their scrutiny.
He’s made peace with it. He doesn’t think he can stomach hearing the rejection out of Dean’s own mouth.
“Never had one of those, huh,” Winchester guesses.
please
Then: “I take it, it’s funnier in Enochian?”
“Cas,” he says, voice softening to a much more reassuring tone, and he scoots across the mattress towards his partner, searching for closeness. “Let’s get one thing straight here: your wings? Are fucking
Cas looks at him. “You’d make out with Virgil?”
Ironically, it’s exactly what drunk Cas has in that drunk mind of his too, so he goes willingly where Dean pushes. Once they reach the bed, he suddenly flips them around so it’s Dean’s knees that hit the edge of the mattress. Cas follows, letting himself fall onto the hunter’s chest and stays there like Dean’s the world’s most comfortable human cushion.
A small reprieve.
“You don’t know him.” Cas doesn’t know why defense is still his first instinct, when Michael hasn’t paid him a visit a single time during all his stay in the hospital. When Sam had been there for Dean whenever he could.
But he’s barking up the wrong tree. Baby is Dean’s territory, and he’ll defend it against anyone, even the one who gets him laid spectacularly on a regular basis.
?” Dean wonders aloud, voice taking on a decidedly un-manly shrillness.
“We gotta talk about this tomorrow.” Dean says it like a promise.
And he enfolds Cas’ hand in his and pulls him back through the door.
Minutes, or hours in – it can’t be expected of Dean to keep track at this point – the sensory overload starts to fill Dean up just as much as Cas’ cock already is. If Cas working his hole tirelessly wasn’t enough, the guy’s also got something extra to give that Dean swears makes him see Heaven As It Should Be: his grace.
Jody resumes with her report. “This bad boy here has made it his life mission to kidnap every, well,” she coughs awkwardly but pulls through, “every
Winchester scrunches his nose up, and Castiel finds similar expressions of disbelief on the others’ faces. “He not know that you’re, like, out of action?”
But Cas' mind is still stuck on what Dean said, a specific sentence that has the wheels in his head turning. “Wait a minute,” he says. “Is
This time, it’s a whisper: “I want everything you have to give me.”
But –
“You really like it?”
“What do I want to take?” Dean growls, actually growls to the point that Cas has to look up– “I want to take
“Does it hurt, baby?” Dean asks, probably not even noticing the new pet name that just rolled off his tongue. For a moment, Cas forgets to be annoyed with him and revels in the attention Dean gives him so generously.
Really, Dean’s the one who’s sorry, because while his coffee-deprived brain was all occupied with processing everything he’s been confronted with so far, he’d neglected to notice Cas’ own bashful discomfort. He’s showing Dean a part of himself he’d kept hidden for as long as they’ve known each other, and is actually afraid now that his True Face might appall Dean.
Especially like this, when he couldn’t even see where the fall might end.
The atmosphere in the hospital is noticeably less jaunty without Dean there to flirt with the nurses and doctors and fellow patients.
Winchester ignores that fact too, and Cas is glad for it.
“What?” Dean can only ask, because drunk Cas turns out to be even more complicated than regular, sober Cas.
All at once, the rush of the feathers stills completely, and Castiel turns to blink owlishly at him. “What?”
“I’m not an idiot, dude, don’t disrespect your queen like that!” Charlie puts her hands on her hips, and it’s curious how she can make herself look taller than Dean despite her actual physical height. “But this is our best shot right now – at least it’s something we can do!”
With a happy sigh, Dean curls deeper into the sheets, his arm draping across Cas’ chest as he lets the angel’s familiar scent lull him to sleep.
“I need more coffee for this,” murmurs Kevin, who appears generally unimpressed with everything.
There was something poetic to it, Castiel thought. That the destruction of one was salvation for him.
“Yes,” Cas smiles, pleased. He leans forward so that their noses almost brush to get a close-up of Dean's eye-roll when he says, “I told you so. Your beautiful, welcoming heart is not toxic. On the contrary, it is giving and considerate and good ”
He’s bringing an entire army with him.
“You asshat! I told you to look after him, not impale him with your Michael lance!”
Then, his mouth decides to translate the relieve at seeing Cas whole and well in his room into the petulant question,
Because Cas in his room is a rare and welcome sight.
Everyone drops their weapons immediately, but the safety on Garth's gun must not have been on anymore, and upon hitting the ground, it shoots out one bullet which lands, as if perfectly aimed, in Cas' stomach.
So now they’re on their way to Wichita.
He cuts off this train of thought before it affects him in inappropriate ways. Instead, he stands up and rummages around the room to have at least something to do. Since he can’t leave the room without throwing his friends in a panic, he’ll make do with evading Dean’s hovering and Sam’s worried glances and Charlie’s strategic positioning of the library furniture into an arrangement that’s supposed to be helpful in warding off threats towards him, though Cas fails to see the how in that.
“Benny?” Dean said, and again some secret communication seemed to go down between them because Benny took that as his cue to leave.
But Cas just turns a cool look on him. “With both my hands on the wheel, I wouldn’t be able to eat this,” he points out like the evil genius he is.
Those extra inches Crowley sold his soul for got nothin’ on him.
, huh?” He’s quoting Cas’ words, translated from the Romanian that slipped out of Cas’ mouth in the midst of ecstasy.
Cas frowns at her, betrayed.
“But you didn’t say how bad it was!” Dean yells back. “How’m I supposed to know how bad it is if you don’t give me anything to work with? If you told me, ‘Dean, if I beam you to the past with me, it might just kill me’ – do you think we would’ve insisted on coming along?”
“Hello, will you answer me?”
Shrill and undignified and nearly pissing himself while he’s at it, and it takes him a few more embarrassing seconds to think of grabbing the gun from under his pillow and point it at the friggin’
At that, Dean barks a laugh. “No can do, buddy, it’s an earned title.” The fact that Dean presses another quick kiss to Cas’ lips smoothens the frown of discontent on Cas’ face, however. As does the way Dean’s arm drapes over his shoulder, pressing him against his side as he moves them towards the general direction of the door. “You ready for a ride home?”
“Them… all?” Dean croaks. “Cas,
if they weren’t all so
“Hate to interrupt but… we got a text from our little group of wayward gals,” Charlie regretfully informs them, waving her phone through the air for emphasis. “They say they’ve found something ‘very interesting’, and they thought we should come see it.”
“Your own wha-,” Dean interrupted himself with a gasp that sounded punched out of him. “Your own pain?”
“I’d like it more if I knew how to keep you in bed,” Cas retorts testily.
One of the women steps forward and speaks, her words accompanied by fluent sign language, “The rumors about my death have been greatly exaggerated.”
And that’s practically their way of saying good night.
“Dean, I-”
“Cas,” Dean rasps, eyes trained on the area of his legs. Following his gaze, Cas absently notices that his pant leg is singed at the seams, and through the charred fabric it becomes evident that his skin hasn't gone unscathed by the ordeal either.
This pain was different. This pain was emotional, deep spider webs that had weaved their way through the human brain to spread their darkness in the woman’s soul. It was more difficult to extract. But also more difficult to withstand, to bear, and Castiel thrummed at the anticipation of making it his own.
“It makes you collapse from exhaustion, Cas, how is that not bad?” Dean sounded angry now, and definitely not placated at all. “You… you’re giving them health and in exchange, they give you whatever was fucked up with theirs? That’s a pretty shitty deal, Cas.”
“Oh, I’m sorry, I didn’t know. I’m too much of a shitkicker to be educated proper.”
Dean doesn’t let him. Sitting up again, his own hand shoots out and snatches Cas by the wrist, and he holds him there, inside their little bubble of personal space.
Castiel closed his eyes, suddenly missing the solidity of the mattress against his back. He sacked into the chair which had held his coat earlier, not bothering to keep in a deep sigh.
Cas shakes his head. “Not hurt at all!” he assures.
try stopping once he does this thing with the-”
“No monster activity as far as I can tell, but there's a warding that just blinked up in my system? My app hasn't notified me of any kind of supernatural warding in that area until now, so it might be worth looking into, since it seems to be, you know, getting weaker and all.” With a shudder, she adds, “Maybe it's holding some eldritch monster inside that's trying to escape after a thousand years of imprisonment. And it feeds on human flesh!”
them never quite goes away, Cas has found.
This time, when Cas sets foot on Earth again, he’s not alone.
of all people would drag him off the ground.
Cas turned his head in an exaggerated full-body eye-roll. Half an hour with Dean’s way of driving combined with his stubbornness that could easily turn the laws of time and physics on their heads… Castiel stood up carefully and searched the room for his trench coat. Spotting it on a chair next to where Benny leaned against the wall, he reached for it and draped himself in the comforting fabric.
He’s mostly wrong, of course.
Dean snorts at that. “How’d the other guy look?”
Dean swallows audibly. The rest of the room has grown suspiciously silent, no more background music there to try and drown out anyone’s internal emotional panic, and Castiel spares a moment to throw a reproachful look to Gabriel for that.
So he stretches out his arm towards the nightstand, where his foresightedness had left the Enochian handbook to keep it a little more handy for a less time-consuming intermission.
“Don’t you see it now? You
“What happened?” Cas asks, voice rough with sleep, rougher even than normal. He looks around. “Where’s Sam?”
“He was so fortunate to grab onto a balcony railing a story below,” Cas relays. “That way he could break his fall more elegantly than I managed.”
He hasn’t noticed the deep sigh that presses out of him until he finds Winchester’s eyes on him. “Family call?”
He felt his eyes falling shut.
Castiel wouldn’t even
Everyone’s eyes are on them.
Dean raises an eyebrow at him. “What, being in my arms?” He laughs, makes a joke of it. Because what Cas is trying to say there sounds a hell of a lot like the emotional crap he usually gives a wide berth to.
“That’s a lie, you love everyone, you big ol’ hippie.”
Cas just huffs. “Please. My existence has been full of life-endangering situations before any of you were even so much as a thought in my Father's mind. This,” he gestures from the dying fire on the floor to his damaged skin, “has nothing to do with Dean's penis.”
Subconsciously, he bites his bottom lip, gives Anna a helpless smile, and then does it anyway.
Dean nods, slowly, like he's thinking something through.
to get you in the mood again, then, I wager.” And with that he winks, and moves down Cas chest and...
“Fuck,” Dean says, more than a little breathlessly, because that’s what his train of thoughts has been reduced to – an angel’s ceaseless pounding will do that to you. “Nice guys don’t fuck like that.”
Belatedly, distantly, Castiel realizes the voice must belong to Winchester.
Cas’ eyebrows draw together in a frown and he opens his mouth to say something eloquent like
“I-” Castiel clears his throat. Tries again. “I'm fine.”
Castiel scrunches up his face in distaste. It’s all very–
Castiel just rolls his eyes. Tries to hide that stupid smile that threatens to take over his face.
“Yes, they do,” he attests.
The laugh that leaves Dean’s mouth is so melodic, Cas wonders if there’s any other sound in the world that could rival its beauty. “Man, what did you do wrong?”
“F-fighting,” he admits. “He was about to ruin Michael’s career. The falling was an accident, though. We were not paying attention.”
“Just leave ‘im, he’s a delicate little plant,” Winchester immediately proves Castiel’s thoughts true. His younger brother presumably got all the empathy genetics while Winchester’s DNA was drenched with assholery.
And yet, he had saved him.
Through the whirlwind in his mind, he doesn’t even bother to ask himself how Dean made it here.
“We’re gonna figure it out, okay?” Dean murmured into his neck, and that felt nice too.
The question comes from the brother, Sam, and to Cas’ surprise he looks genuinely concerned. Castiel can’t imagine how he and Winchester share a bloodline.
“Last one for you,” warns the bartender, making Cas scowl at him reproachfully. “You’ve been drinking more in the last hour than our town drunk does on a whole day. Trust me, no more.”
But he recovers his senses quickly.
“What, you think I sleep with every angel I stab at first sight?” Dean laughs, but it's a quiet thing, still earnest in its carefreeness. “I love you.”
“Ow!” Dean protests, feeling bullied by a kid half his age.
Winchester’s head perks up. “Sammy, no, that’s what he wants.”
“Dude, are you
“I know, okay?” defends Dean, looking positively miserable. “I'm sorry! But in my defense, I've held myself back for almost ten years now, and I only have so much self-control. Plus, Cas is a really distracting kisser.” And he gets that dreamy look in his eyes that tells Cas he's reminiscing about last night. Cas doesn't care to hide the smugness he feels in the face of that. “
His whole body joining in on his eye-roll, Cas says, “For the last time, Dean, cursed objects have and will never be something as absurd as a human's genitals.”
“By the driver, of course.”
“Hmm,” Rowena hums. “Well, are we certain she's still alive?” she wonders aloud, and Dean blanches. Cas moves to comfort Dean, tell him that he's sure she is and if not, there would be no reason for Dean to blame himself, but Garth blocks his attempt to approach Dean. Cas glares at the werewolf.
Years of friendship, of fighting, of losing and finding each other again has taught Dean one thing: With Cas, you have to be straightforward or not at all. And Dean’s no fool. He chooses option number one.
, before Dean can even answer.
me of it.”
“I need some air!”
He doesn’t notice the tear running down his cheek until Dean wipes it away with a calloused finger. Cas takes that same hand and presses a kiss to his knuckles, still swollen from whatever recent physical fight he had and Cas
They are legend.
Because Cas? Cas sure as hell knows what he’s doing.
He regards the human head with his adorably mussed hair where it’s flattened from the pillow on one side, as well as the lion head that looks a little less like the zoo animal Dean is familiar with, and more like a very old, very distant ancestor of the good old Twentieth-Century-lion, his mane a dirty shade of gray and so long that it reaches down to Cas’ shoulder.
“Alright, I'll play,” Cas concedes. “If there really was such a 'curse', then how, pray tell, is Lisa Braeden still alive?”
Castiel turns away. “Just because you’re a ‘mother hen’ does not mean that everyone else should follow your example.”
“Whose ass?”
They both let out identical nervous laughs.
Shutting the door behind them with finality, Dean turns around. He’s slapped on a grin that seems frozen around the edges and it’s another sign of Dean’s nervosity that Castiel can’t quite comprehend.
Dormant for so long, they’re full of pent up grief for things unfinished. Guilt and rage and hope all at once thrum through their veins, chasing away the icy water that had them frozen for so long. Mangled by the poisonous fangs of Free Will, they are forever corrupted. They are delinquents, deficient specimens of their race.
“Oooohh!” Gabriel singsongs in delight. “Don’t tell me, I wanna guess! You rode a rollercoaster! You went to Disneyland!”
“Half an hour ago?” Benny estimated vaguely.
Cas spreads out his hand on top of Dean's chest, right where his anti-possession tattoo lies. He doesn't take his eyes off Dean once. “I can forget it happened,” he suggests, voice lowered to a whisper. “You can tell me again, like I'm hearing it for the very first time. Once you're ready.”
Dean scoffs. “Over my dead body.”
been great conversationalists, and he'd favor their company at this very moment.
The fingers around his biceps tightened their grip. “That’s not what I asked,” Dean said.
They could've made out in the backyard of the den of iniquity. In Dean's car in Rexford. Hell, against a tree in fucking
Cas feels his own annoyance represented in the full-body eye roll Dean performs at that. “Can’t they deal with it alone? Kinda in the middle of somethin’ here.” And he winks at Cas in a way that recovers his hope for a shared objective which leads preferably onto a flat surface in Dean’s room.
“Do you really think so?”
“I think I can handle that,” Cas says haughtily.
“No, the edge is off. I don’t want to anymore, you ruined it,” Cas complains. In the pettiest corner of his mind, he might even admit that he thinks it serves Dean right to suffer the same way he’s made Cas suffer all these times.
Dean does something with his face that makes Cas want to punch him. “Please, you’re way too boring for puddings.”
The eyes of the lion that had fallen shut at Dean’s caress, open again. “No,” Cas says.
means soul, right? Got that one. Oh!” He looks up to Cas from where he’s crouched down with the book in his lap, the dimmed light creating mesmerizing art with the contours of Dean’s body. (Cas gets the sudden urge to paint him like this. But he doesn’t get up and gather his brushes, right, because who does that in the middle of sex?)
Cas frowns lightly. “I don’t know the exact statistics, but I assume not many do.”
?” Dean asks, and Cas supposes that’s fair.
“Why the fuck are you asking me this?” Dean lets out, desperately browsing through his memories of the two of them screwing that would explain any of this – because it had never been anything more than that, at least according to the lie Dean had fed them both in order not to disturb that fragile friendship they’ve build together because if he lost
So Dean pulls.
Something in the way he says it gives Dean the urge to look down to his shoes – no need for his brother to see the unmistakably mushy grin, nor the embarrassing blush that’s taking over Dean’s face. His very new and tentative relationship with the angel had been cause for enough of Sam’s teasing
“Right,” Dean says. “Gonna kidnap everyone’s favorite angel now, don’t mind me.”
The frown on Cas’ forehead deepens. “But I don’t-” he starts, but God must be actually present somewhere in a far corner of this universe because Cas’ expression clears and, “Oh,” he says again, this time in a much more comprehending tone which makes Dean grin. “Of course, Dean. I’ll… follow you.”
That seems to throw Cas. He looks up – with the human
Once the door shuts behind him, Dean whips his head around to the other bed. “You’re the actual worst, you know that.”
“The pain has to go somewhere, right?”
“The book,” continues Dean, a little red in the face, which could be attributed to their previous physical activities but Cas knows better. “With the spindle. That kind of sucked man – I mean, that you weren't able to move was terrible of course, but I'm actually talking about that other thing right now, uhm...,” he sighs, deciding to just spell it out. “I didn’t wanna have a curse make me admit my feelings to you. Or the fact that I have no fucking filter during our stupid arguments. I wanted to do that myself, on my own terms.”
That trademark frown appears on Cas’ face as if on cue. “You were injured.”
But other nights, he craved it a little rougher, a devil in the sheets to let off some steam.
“Tell me, Dean, and I’ll change. I can be like
“Yes, that was my brother Michael, he is my boss.” Castiel doesn’t know why he tells him this.
the rest of the way.”
Cas sighs. “Dean, it's just a burn, I'm okay to fight.”
And then it’s back on him in full force. That icy stare that would burn Dean’s eyes right out of his skull if it could. At least that’s how it looks to Dean.
“Actually, it can, if you wanna be literal about it...”
And, finally, kisses him.
“It's okay, Sam,” murmurs the woman who must be Sarah, and Cas observes that Eileen never breaks contact with either of them. Her head rests against Sam's shoulder and a hand is sneaking up Sarah's arm in a way that seems intimate, as though they're trading such affections all the time.
“See, that’s the thing,” Dean begins as he shoves the phone unceremoniously back into his pocket. And then he surges forward in a movement not even Cas could’ve predicted and his hands lock on either side of Cas’ shoulders, effectively trapping him.
They’re at each other’s throats by hour two-and-a-half. Dean knows because he checked the clock just so he can rub it into Sam’s face later that he was off by about half an hour.
“Car accident, basically,” Dean reveals. “My apprentice, he’s... doesn’t matter, he means well. Anyway, nearly got my leg squashed. Not the first time to fuck up my leg, so. There.”
This pain was more all-encompassing. Physical pain was instant, sharp, yes – but this pain
Castiel stared. He didn’t understand the way Benny talked. It was like a whole different language when Castiel knew every language of the world by heart. It was even more cryptic to him than Dean’s abundant references to popular culture. Dean and Benny had shared that language, leaving Castiel to observe them through a barrier of looking-glass. Close, but never enough so.
Fingers brush through Dean’s hair, then lower, tracing a warm line down Dean’s spine. He smiles and sinks deeper against Cas’ chest.
Cas turns to look at him with his earnest, blue blue eyes and responds with his usual, “Hello, Dean.”
Gladly, Dean complies.
“Dean, there is no 'curse'. I've died regardless of whether your penis has come anywhere near me, several times in fact!” he dares to remind Dean.
“Kitty,” Dean confirms, pleased.
In answer, she just shoves a plate with a slice of chocolate cake towards him. “Try some.”
The cheerful spirits his innocent little flirt had put him into have vanished completely after Sam’s running commentary about his “promiscuous ass”, and Cas wasn’t anywhere to be seen either since they left the bar. Looks like it’s gonna be another night of the guessing game as to whether the idiot’ll be back in the morning or if he’ll be god-probably-doesn’t-know-either-where.
, not forced and uncomfortable.
“Be careful,” Dean warns again, when Cas moves to pick up a random book from a random shelf, and he rolls his eyes so hard that his wing-eyes feel the echo of it in the ether.
“I’m not perfect.” It’s not even the first thing on the list of things he wants to say but the part of his Self that has reasonable thoughts and acts on them he seemingly left behind in the Empty.
“Dammit, Cas.” And this time, Dean sounded neither angry nor panicked. It was a different nuance of a bone-deep fear that Cas would have rather not poked at again.
His boss gives him a string of instructions and Castiel struggles to note them down on a stray piece of paper which crinkles on the unreliable surface of his blanket-covered thigh. “Alright, I will… get to that,” he promises, not knowing how he’ll manage any of it in his current situation.
Kissing Dean had been… a revelation.
But Cas apparently doesn’t mind Dean prodding at his wings, because he nods his yes readily enough. So prod Dean does.
It was just like back then, with Sam and his hallucinations.
You are not my damnation.
“Just the essentials,” answers Cas crisply.
Dean smiles, clenches the hand he has clamped on Cas’ shoulder. “Yeah.”
No one knows such a ragtag band of people.
“I don’t eat,” comes the instant reply and Dean rolls his eyes.
“Bitch,” Dean calls at the closed bathroom door, and the obligatory “Jerk,” follows promptly.
, Cas would like to say.
, Dean thinks. The hit wasn’t even that hard.
They’re like sprinkling oil into a kitchen fire, Sam says.
“Did Dean send you?”
And that – that punches the breath out of Dean’s lungs. More than Cas landing on his chest with his full weight. More than that wendigo did last week, when it flung Dean against a cave wall.
“No thanks to you,” Cas huffs back. “You stole all my puddings while you were here, don’t think I didn’t notice.”
“Away,” Cas grouches back, stumbling forward a few steps, and instinctively, Dean meets him in the middle to catch him. Up close like this, he can smell another note in the Eau-de-Cas that he hasn’t recognized before, kind of sweeter and a little like…
It’s a transparent lie, but it works because Dean’s eyes are wide when they turn to ogle Cas‘ profile. “You didn’t!”
“So, uh,” Dean murmurs. “About what happened earlier...”
“Cas, look it’s-”
at it, drew it over and into him.
Dean pulled away, but let a hand rest around Cas’ shoulder, drawing Cas a little closer to his side, as much as the position of their chairs let them. “Okay, here’s what we’re gonna do. We’re gonna get you to Baby and we’re gonna talk about this on the way back home, how 'bout that?”
It’s not an ideal thing to say, because it makes Cas restless again. He tries to squirm out of Dean’s embrace before he decides he wants closer and not away, and then just buries his nose in Dean’s shirt, fussing into it because apparently he’s reached the stage of whiny drunk. Which would be cute, if it wouldn’t threaten to break Dean’s heart. “Please, Dean,” he lets out, a pitiful sound. “I can do that for you too, you don’t need to look for uh, these women or, well, men, in these bars or diners, I can-”
“I’ve
Cas perks up at the mention of his name. For a while there, he seems to be genuinely confused at the question, but opts for a matter-of-fact reaction. “Oh,” he says. “I don’t sleep.”
