"How are we supposed to do this?" Dean asks Cas, leaning up against the hallway wall while Sam helps Rowena set up for a spell that's basically a check-up.
"Well, hey," Dean interrupts, holding his arms out beside himself, "not dead. So, no harm, no foul. Cas saved the day. Woohoo, just like old times. Uh, actually, how
he really likes it. Only in the quiet of his mild buzz with Castiel's gentle smile flickering in his mind can Dean admit it, but he does. He likes it. He
That wakes Cas up. He jerks, his eyes getting all big and blue—even bluer, somehow, despite the way his pupils
"Do not ask questions you don't want the answer to, Dean," Castiel warns, dropping his head and glaring at him. He spreads his hands, helpless to the bitterness he feels as he says what he does next. "I am at your disposal. Use me as you see fit."
"Thanks, Jack." Dean huffs a laugh and pulls down a mug from the cabinet. "So, what are you and the girls gonna get up to? I didn't know you spent a lot of time with them, especially one-on-one."
Dean cackles, tossing his head back with genuine mirth. He reaches out and shoves at Sam's shoulder, making him loosen up, earning a huff of laughter. Jack looks up from his computer, curious.
Dean's convinced it would have pleased him. Dean spent so much time not getting to make Cas happy, not knowing how much he would one day ache to. It's too late now, but Dean doesn't care. He'll do it anyway.
In the next second, there's the sound of wings, and then Cas is gone. Dean sucks in a sharp breath, running his tongue along his bottom lip as he tilts his head up and tries to breathe around the lump in his throat. He slowly turns, unable to stop himself from making a full circle, a kernel of hope still burning along with that betrayal in his chest.
and he does whatever Cas wants him to. That turns about to be more kissing, which Dean gives into almost naturally. Cas squirms underneath him, unable to hold still, fingers fumbling for the button on Dean's pants.
"No. No, uh, my—" Dean swallows and fixes his gaze on the flowers, a lump in his throat. It takes him a second to say what he needs to. "My husband gave me a flower like this once."
Dean wonders why. It's a good opening. Castiel could say that they would be good together. He could suggest that Sam thought that because there's some kind of logic to it. He could even ask how Dean feels about it, or if there's ever going to be a chance that it's true, or what he could do to
That's a lot, actually. Dean hasn't given much thought to marriage. He just...doesn't think about it. He doesn't think he wants it. It surprises him a little that Castiel does. Or, well, he'd be open to it, at least. God, the balls of fucking steel he must have to be completely okay with the idea of Dean Winchester being his ball-and-chain. Jesus Christ.
Castiel remembers the feeling of Dean's soul cradled in his essence. Not his hands, as he didn't have any, but held within him, shielded and safe. His soul had been so bright, so hot that it had almost burned, the intensity branding Castiel in a way that wouldn't leave a visible mark, but would linger forevermore all the same. It was partially the reason he branded Dean—rebellious retaliation, even then, a strange urge to leave an impression since Dean certainly left one on him. He thinks about it, about how Dean had wept, how his soul wept, when they met.
Zoey laughs and pats his hand, standing up fully and stepping back. "Tonight is just not my night. I'm going to head out and accept defeat, but I'll consider you something of a success. It was good meeting you, Dean, and good luck with your hot friend."
but he doesn't think he'll ever be able to say those words out loud again. It didn't go so well when he finally did say them. Confessing it really was a curse. They got their answers, alright, but they never got each other.
Dean cracks up, laughing and shaking his head. He reaches out and curls his hand around Castiel's hip, the gesture familiar and intimate, new and not, terrifying and exhilarating. "No, not at all."
, Cas," he chokes, whipping his head around, a lump in his throat, his nails digging into the counter, warmth pulsing almost painfully in his chest.
With a small, pleased sound, Cas slips to the side and settles down, his head on the pillow next to Dean's. One of his hands comes to a halt on Dean's chest, a finger smoothing slow circles on his sternum, the touch light. Dean turns his head, staring at him from up close, frowning a little.
unrelated, but sam being like "bro you've got a HUSBAND you do realize?" and dean being like "yeah but does he love me back?" is the ONLY 'sam has opinions about destiel' dynamic, actually, because i said so.
"Right," Sam says. He stares at Dean for a long moment, then blows out a deep breath and knocks on the table with his knuckles, his eyebrows raised pointedly. "So, either way, you'd be doing life with him. That's what imagining a future with someone
It's not often that there's any time to take much of a break in Purgatory. It's mostly just running, and fighting, and trying not to get killed.
Dean doesn't go very far. He stares at Cas from way too close, all up in his personal space, still holding on. He takes Cas in, studying every feature, basking in the intensity of his gaze and the expressions that are his alone. He's missed him.
"I'm done. I'm just—" Sam shakes his head and tosses his hands up, turning around and marching out of the room, muttering under his breath something that sounds like
don't need him," Dean snaps, his voice rising higher and higher against his will, sharp and gruff and furious. "What we fucking need is a case. Me and you, back out there again, not slowing the fuck down for anything. Saving people, hunting things; that's our goddamn hamster wheel, ain't it? So let's fucking run it."
"And you," Dean adds, because Cas has left a glaring absence on that list. It doesn't sit right with Dean. This has got to end well for him, too.
"I don't think you're cruel, Dean," Cas says softly, smiling sadly. "I just know that it changes things."
hot, but it was only one of those for you, so you were definitely scared. Even after we softened him up with our bad friendship and poor examples of humanity, you knew somewhere deep down that he could break you like a twig if his mood shifted like the wind. You oughta be thanking me, Sam."
summon it, we'd have to reason with it, or start something we may not be able to finish to get it to even consider breaking that deal. A deal that is
"You gonna pass out on me?" Dean mumbles, hands snapping out to catch him and steady him, making them slot together with ease. Their chests bump, and Dean gets to watch in slow detail as Cas' lips part and his eyelids flutter shut. "Cas?"
"No, you misunderstand me. Yet again." Cas heaves a sigh and shakes his head. "It's not that I don't want to stay with you. It's that I have a home. I like it here. I don't want to live in the Bunker. It's genuinely not you."
Well, damn. That...hurts. Yeah, that one hurts, truth be told. Dean hasn't really thought well of himself since...ever, admittedly, but it's one thing to know you're a piece of shit and another thing entirely to realize that the person you love knows it, too. Of course Cas knows that. Cas knows
The petals are brown and stiff, practically crumbling under his fingertips. If he weren't so careful, he's sure that it would break off and drift away. The stem is split and curling, the structural integrity of it the same consistency as paper, flimsy and easy to tear. The red-tipped yellow has been overtaken with a dull brown and various rotted black spots.
Castiel checks once more to be certain, waiting for even the hint of anything too negative, but Dean just seems to be waiting with a bated breath. Perched precariously on some sort of edge he's asking Castiel to push him over. Some need that push, apparently, and Castiel won't deny him if he's asking.
"You being you is why I love you," Castiel says, as if it's the simplest thing in the world to say, as if that has absolutely no effect on Dean at all.
"Uh, I—" Claire flicks her gaze to Kaia, who smiles and offers a tiny shrug. Dean watches in real time as Claire's fingers clasp together, her eyes brightening in an endearing way, like a young girl getting her first car from her parents. Ah, hell, that's kinda bittersweet, now that Dean thinks about it, but Claire's excitement more than makes up for it. "I don't mind taking it off your hands, especially if you're angling for a new car from Dean. Sure, I'll take it. If you—if you're sure."
"Simple," Cas agrees, lips turning up at the corners. He stretches up and forward, pressing a simple kiss right to Dean's lips, like he's sealing a deal. When he pulls back, he nods. "Okay. Let's do that."
when he's asleep. Dean shakes his head and leans to the side so he can reach out and flick his nose, grinning when Castiel's face scrunches up and turns away.
fucking nice sometimes, and Dean wishes he could give him more, give him anything at all. He'd probably be bad at a blowjob, admittedly, sort of like the worst one he ever had. He doesn't remember the woman's name, but she'd used too much teeth and had zero rhythm. That was okay, though, because she was a really sweet person and her hips—her fucking
Jack is different, too. He's confused by so much. He has a sunnier disposition, always ready with a smile, even if the situation doesn't call for it. He's blunt like Cas is, but not unkindly—born from not knowing that complete honesty is not the route to go, whereas Cas just didn't care. And he wants so,
It's the kind of drunk that he could probably drive with, but won't. The kind that means he's going to remember everything the next day and likely won't have much of a hangover at all—just a tiny headache, at most. The kind that ensures he's feeling pretty good, a little stupid, but not
"No, yeah, I know. It's just…" Sam clears his throat and takes his eyes off the road for a split second, then focuses back on driving. "I don't know, man. You've been...pretty quiet."
Sorine glances over at him. "You know, I go back to our bridge all the time, and I think the water looks a little cleaner. I put my hand on the spot next to me where she used to sit, and it feels warm like she's right there beside me."
Cas doesn't even look up when he comes in. He's squinting at the laptop screen—the codex—and Dean wouldn't think he even noticed the moment at all if not for the fact that he's red in the face. He's also determinedly
job. Why he thinks that, Dean doesn't know. He's kinda sure that Sam is just tired of Castiel metaphorically biting his head off with scathing remarks just because he clearly doesn't feel well. So, it's on Dean to endure it.
What they had couldn't sustain outside of this place, though. Benny was still important to him, and he knows he was important to Benny. More than just the necking near the creeks while Dean doggedly hunted down an angel, they had a thing. Yet another unlabeled thing, and once again, it wasn't love. Not for either of them. But it was
Sighing, Dean shuts the door and looks down at the flower in his hands, twirling the stem between his fingers so the petals will spin in a blur of yellow and red. It's one of the flowers that has a little more red than yellow, and ain't that ironic as hell?
"You fuckin' sap," Dean mutters. He seems to finally catch onto the soft bubble of safety around them, something light and sweet and vulnerable. As per his nature, he immediately works to break it in the swiftest way possible, which apparently involves him ducking his head and biting at the tip of Castiel's thumb playfully, waggling his eyebrows.
Let it not be said that Dean's not fiercely loyal. No matter his mistakes, once he's devoted, he's un-fucking-shakeable. It's like with family. With Sam, and Bobby, and Charlie, and his mom, and even his dad—arguably someone he shouldn't have been so dedicated to. Cas has been in that category for a long time, and that's where he will remain, even if it's in a different way now. In a way that it never got to be, though they both wanted it.
He's not surprised when he finds Cas packing a small bag in his room. The zipper is open, revealing some extra weapons and a few books. Cas glances up when Dean lightly knocks on the door and steps in, and his face goes tight with strain.
Cas looks at him for another second, and the clear skies of his eyes have a moment of lighting up, an understanding flickering in his gaze. He steps forward, too, hovering closer. Dean feels his nearness like a hook in his chest, like a chink in his armor, slipping right past the goddamn leather jacket that he pulled out for this one purpose, to make him feel impenetrable. But Cas slithers right on in, just by getting
because of him. That's not even Jack anymore, as far as Dean is concerned. He's just another person Dean—or anyone else—couldn't save, another thing that has to be handled. His kid? Well, his kid has been gone for a while now, and that only fuels his anger and his determination to do it.
"It isn't stupid, but yes." Castiel makes a small noise, an appraising one. "I think it's nice that you have interests and things you like to do."
Dean can do. It's a little bit of emotional whiplash, but he's more than happy to shift with the proverbial wind and go in this direction. He opens his mouth and immediately closes his eyes when Cas' fingers slip back in like they're slotting into place, finding a home in the wet heat between his lips. It's so
As Castiel wraps his lips around the mouth of the bottle, he thinks about Dean doing the same, thinks about the way Dean's throat bobs with each swallow, thinks about how his lips glisten and how he licks them. He quickly identifies what other emotion accosts him with the shame—a sharp, heady desire.
"You are, as always, severely undervaluing yourself. Dean, if we never had sex again, I would still want to be with you. If all I could do is stand next to you for the rest of my life, I would choose that." Cas swallows. "I did choose that."
"You can be with—of course you—" Cas shudders out a deep breath, eyes flashing. "And Lee? When you went?"
"Do you fall asleep every time?" Cas asks, sounding absurdly fond for the moment they're in currently.
Things are different between them now, and Castiel can sense it. Dean is always watching him, gaze flicking to him over and over, assessing. He knows now, so he's surely seeing Castiel in a new light, trying to understand. It's not the curiosity that bothers Castiel, but rather the mockery that puts him on edge. Just because Dean is uncomfortable does not mean Castiel will stand by and allow himself to be pushed over and over, not for something he doesn't even regret.
"I thought maybe you just…" Dean shrugs a little, clearing his throat. "I dunno. Maybe I was good in bed, but more than that wasn't—I mean, I'm not exactly someone anyone should
"I do not regret it," Castiel croaks, drawing his gaze. His eyes are soft, fond. "Forgive me for saying so, but I find myself almost...grateful. Your near-death isn't something to be thankful for, and those are not the circumstances in which I cherish being back, but I do, frankly, cherish being back. To be here with you is… I am happy to have made the choice I did, and I would gladly be ill every day in exchange."
Dean hasn't made a mixtape since he was a fucking teenager, and he has never made one for someone else consisting of
for you? Tormenting me?" Castiel asks, needing to know, because surely not. Why is Dean enjoying it? He doesn't understand.
There's nothing blurry about this. It's cut and dry. Simple and self-explanatory. Cas pins him up against the door and snarls into his mouth and kisses him like it's going to be the last time. And maybe, maybe,
It's currently 9:23am, which explains why Cas is taking no shit at the moment. Dean shakes his head and leaves him to it, going to do exactly as he said he would. Bathroom first—relieving himself, brushing his teeth, all that jazz. Kitchen next, except Jack is already up, reading a book at the table.
Sorine smiles back, and then she slips into her car, and she's gone in fading headlights as she takes a curve. Dean turns around and walks back into the meadow, ducking under the chain, heading further in while he can still see.
When they pull into the garage, Dean cheerfully sing-songs, "Hey, Cas," in a way that puts him on edge immediately.
Dean tries not to think about Cas, but as always, he fails. He closes his eyes and takes a swig of beer to give him some time to get his shit together. His fingers tremble around the neck of the bottle, and if Sorine notices, she kindly pretends not to.
The moment Dean stops in front of the coffee machine, Cas startles and fumbles with the mug in his hands. It clatters against the counter, and he clears his throat loudly as he jerks his hands out to forcefully sit it down to silence it. He glances at Dean, finds Dean staring at him, then quickly looks away again. As if he can't be still, he reaches out to fiddle with the mug again, his head ducked.
"Hey, fuck you, don't go stealing my shit," Dean blurts out, picking up his pace towards the table, averting his eyes just a bit.
"Sam thought—" Dean hesitates, unsure, but he wavers and continues anyway. "He thought we were together. Like a couple.
Dean releases a low groan, sounding—embarrassed? Why? "Dude, that's really—fuck, I'm so sorry. I'm—"
Dean fiddles with the bottle, lips ticking down. He doesn't talk about Cas, not usually. He doesn't know if he wants to, or if it helps. "I guess, um… Well, Cas saw good in the world, even in the shittiest parts of it. I mean, he would find beauty in the ash imprint of a flower, just the same way he would before it burned. I try to see the world through his eyes sometimes, ya know, but I don't think I manage."
"I told you that I make things difficult for you, that I am largely responsible for our issues, and you wanted to come see me?" Cas asks, skeptical.
Dean surges up with frantic energy, scrambling to his knees and almost falling over. He nearly smacks Cas in what he assumes is his face as he swipes his hand through the air, searching for something. He finds it just as Cas' hot breath wafts over his jaw, his hands curling under the hem of Dean's shirt. There's the sound of the string being pulled, then light floods around them without warning.
Castiel understands why Dean is angry. He expects it. This is not a burden that he wants to be saddled with, and Castiel cannot save him from it. "Dean, I understand you're angry—"
Dean scrambles away from the desk with the mixtape because he knows that look in Sam's eye. He's all little brother right now, and oh god, this does not bode well for Dean.
Eventually, Zoey abandons him. A pretty woman comes into the bar, and she's halfway out of her seat as soon as she notices her. "This has been fun, Dean, but
There's nothing else for it. Dean tries to launch himself across the bed the way he would the hood of a car, but he's not as young as he used to be, and the mattress just conforms to his body. Betrayed by memory foam, say it ain't so. He ends up sprawled half across his bed, half on the ground on the other side, and the mixtape goes skittering from his hands, sliding across the floor.
signals that Cas can clearly see. He responds to it, eyes fixing on him with intent, shifting closer like it's an instinct.
"Interesting, yes." Dean coughs and stares at the coffee as it pours into his cup. His face is very hot. Goddamn blushing again. "Case stuff, no."
"Why was Claire upset about the truck?" Cas asks abruptly, turning to look at him with a small frown.
Cas just smiles at him again, wide enough that the skin next to his eyes crinkle. "You're tired. You said you wanted to sleep with me when you're tired, so go to sleep. I'll be here."
"What," Cas bites out, his voice so sleep-thick and rough-and-tumble that Dean's a little dazed about it. He sounds all snarl-y and pissed off, like he gets when he wants to burn things down.
This is going to be bad, isn't it? Dean can feel it in his bones, because that's definitely some hesitation on Cas' face. He only hesitates for the really bad things. Jesus.
He doesn't even know when blue became his favorite, when he traded the color of blood in for the feeling of peace. He can't recall.
Anyway, as the second week comes to a close, they find a case. It's not too far, just out on a ranch in Oklahoma. Actually, it's a Hunter who reaches out to them for help, a man they haven't ever met before, but one who apparently heard of them through Claire and Kaia. He was told they were looking for something to do, and he needs some assistance, so it all works out for everyone involved, really.
"Yes. All of it. Anything. Every single terrible thing that could happen because of it, I've thought of."
Sam grins at him. "Okay, hear me out, because I've got just the thing. I've been meaning to ask, but I didn't want to upset your flow just yet."
stronger than she is. We will beat her, whatever it takes," Cas tells him, then slides his hand around to Dean's back, yanking him in.
He's never really operated under having nothing to lose. He's always had Sam, and losing him isn't something he can accept. So, he's aware that he has things to lose. But this is different, somehow. This is a different type of loss—or, it was this time.
of heartbreak, or bitterness, or misery. There's nothing to be found, and while it scares Dean shitless, he has to know. He
Dean chuckles weakly and reaches out with fumbling fingers to fiddle with the front of Castiel's shirt, rolling the cloth between his fingers. "I have no idea what the fuck I'm doing. The kissing is, ya know, self-explanatory. But the rest? Beyond me."
"Good morning, Dean," Jack responds, looking up with a broad smile. "Are you about to make breakfast?"
Dean makes another noise into the kiss, his hips moving with fervor now. Castiel can feel the way his body moves under his hands, against his thigh. It's inelegant and desperate, almost frantic, and Castiel is positive that it's the loveliest, most sinuous thing. Castiel kisses him in encouragement.
"Okay," Dean says, jerking a quick nod and hooking his thumb over his shoulder. "Well, I'm gonna head on in. If you're out here for longer than an hour, I'm dragging your ass kicking and screaming back inside, you hear me?"
Dean gives him a pointed look and shoves the pills closer. Castiel has his hand pressed flat against his chest as his coughing subsides, but he glares at Dean as if he's personally offended him. With a mild grunt to show his disapproval, he lets Dean pass him the pills and water, swallowing them down with a scowl. He flops back into his pillow with a huff, after, frowning as he lays back.
capacity is pretty much his biggest fear, as far as I know. He literally left to avoid it, because he was scared you two would fall out if you figured out how he felt about you. He made peace with the idea of having you how he believed he
"—just like I said," a familiar voice says. "I was really surprised when the song blew up the way it did, but I'm very proud of it. Honestly, it's really special to me."
But he was also jealous? He also pinned Dean to a counter and got him off? If he felt like he wanted to be
"Did they take you to Eve?" Dean grits out, working very hard not to get angry again. Cas and his stupid,
desperately to be good. It practically spills out of him all the time just how badly he wants to be a good person, to do the right thing, to make the right decisions, even when has no idea what those are.
"You wanna—you—" Dean sort of just...waves his hand at himself, and Cas doesn't even blink, or move. "Um. That's not, like, a requirement for me to move in with you, right? Because, dude, I can probably swing rent."
"You're not interested in men," Castiel says, grasping at straws at this point. He's quite sure that Dean is, in some way, but that hardly matters if Dean doesn't know, if he won't admit it.
"Leave it alone, Sam," Dean insists, fixing him with a serious look. "I mean it. Just leave it alone. I'm good with what I've got, and you don't hear me complaining. You know, if you ignore all the bullshit we go through and just narrow it down to the little things, the very
he must have sat up and wriggled around to help Cas at some point, but he has absolutely no recollection of doing so.
"It's just one," he says as he stops by Dean's car, holding it out. "This shit will weigh on my mind all day if I don't do
Because he didn't know love could feel like this. Like it's rotting, and he's just watching it deteriorate with no way to stop it or breathe life back into it. Like it's broken in some irreparable way, warped way past what it once was to the point that he's not so sure it's the same anymore. Like there's just bitterness and pain, as if there's nothing else they can find with each other.
It's weird to wish Cas was a flower for, like, two seconds, right? Because Dean's one hundred percent sure that he could say it if Cas was a flower. Jesus, he's going to royally fuck this up.
Dean continues to think about sex outside in nature because it is somehow soothing him, and then he stops thinking altogether when he finally spots Cas.
"Uh, this says you do," Sam tells him, waggling the mixtape at him, clearly having the time of his goddamn life right now.
"I like touching you," Dean replies, waggling his eyebrows and watching Castiel roll his eyes hard enough to tip his head, his smile poorly hidden. Maybe he doesn't want to hide it. "Hey, Cas."
Dean feels that resonate through him, his heart flinching and his stomach lurching. His face spasms, throat bobbing on a harsh swallow. He wants Cas to take it back. That's the final nail in his coffin, and Dean knows it. He doesn't want this to happen.
"Oh, wow," Shawn says, his eyebrows flying up. His grin grows, turns a little sharper, more pleased. "Ah, well, someone's confident, aren't they? Alright, fair enough. I figure I walked right into that one. You got a name, angel?"
Dean leans back, but he's still staring at Castiel like he isn't half-aware of what's going on, like the garage could be burning down and he wouldn't notice. He doesn't look afraid.
"You have a point," Cas concedes, eyes opening back up to show the fondness in his gaze, like Dean being an explosive asshole sometimes is something he finds cute. He has terrible taste in men, but looking at Dean's past record, he has no room to judge Cas on that one. "Were those the only times?"
"Dean…" Cas' expression twists a little, and his fingers catch against the bottom of his shirt, twisting it around and around. A nervous gesture. He's anxious, and yet, he continues. "I'm at fault for our friendship failing. It's because I don't—I have never treated you as one treats a friend. You need only look at my friendship with Sam to see that. Dean, you have always been—more. I don't treat you as a friend should because I do not feel for you as a friend would. I—I—"
"Cas," Dean whispers, his voice rough as he turns on his side, hesitantly reaching out to touch the back of Cas' shoulder, "I—"
Sam is silent for a long moment, then he says, "You know, everyone will be glad to hear that you're back. It's—it's good, Dean. Good news like this, even if we don't know how it happened…" He gives a rueful chuckle and shakes his head. "Well, it's still good. Jack could do with some cheering up, especially."
Cas looks away and says, "Yeah," before he keeps right on going, leaving the room without looking back, his steps fading as he goes.
Dean severely hopes that's true. "That's good. That's really good. Just, are you—" He pauses, taking a deep breath. "Cas, did I break your heart, man?"
Sorine snorts. "Sometimes. I guess I'm just on the cycle again. Give me some time, I'll be at acceptance soon enough. Looks like I'm at anger right now."
Castiel's smile slips, his eyes fluttering shut. Distantly, he thinks that he shouldn't be so enticed by the idea of ownership, but it's very distant. His breath shudders out of him, and he says, "I'll keep that in mind. I tend not to want to mistreat my things, so you have to tell me if something is bothering you in any capacity."
he finds out where he is, and Sam looks confused about the new direction. He's still quietly asking what's going on, because something clearly is, and then Cas is complaining that he doesn't have any more quarters and someone else needs to use the payphone, so he has to go,
him that's what they're going to do, and Dean can't really argue that. Well, he can, and he wants to, but he knows it'll do him little good. Cas is a stubborn bastard, even more so when he's in a mood like this, pissed off and done with the world.
When Cas does finally slip free, Dean's eyes open again, just in time to see the thumb coming and keep his lips parted with an eagerness that he has no business feeling considering all the things he's had in his mouth already. Still, he likes it a ridiculous amount when Cas pushes his thumb inside. Cas' whole body fucking
Slowly, Castiel sinks down the length of the door, panting. It takes him a few moments to sort out his thoughts, and then he opens his eyes and looks down at his lap with judgement. He arches an eyebrow at the mess, as if it is to blame.
Despite this, Dean is bristling immediately. He goes tense in his seat, jaw clenched. He and Sam have fought in the past. Hell, they've even fought with fists and kicking and stupid brother shit like that. It's not even the first time that Dean has ever wanted to punch Sam in the face over Castiel, and it probably won't be the last.
"It woulda been worth it for you," Dean mumbles, heaving a sigh and shaking his head, lips curling up when Cas looks down and away—a bashful gesture. It's cute. "But it didn't happen like that?"
Desire is such a complex thing. This isn't like wanting a burger or a beer or a quick fuck. This is more than just skin deep. Dean feels rattled to his fucking core every single time, shaken and left jittery with adrenaline. Because he's always left. The moment things get intense, Cas beats a hasty retreat and spends some time after making sure that they're never alone, letting things cool off between them.
Dean is pretty much tasked to take care of him, which feels kind of unfair, but Sam just raises his hands and declares that it's
"Hm." There's a long beat of silence, and then Claire heaves a sigh. "Look, it's not that I'm—against the idea, okay? I don't need your help, but I don't mind if you want to come. It's just,
Eileen does eventually come bustling in, talking a mile a minute as she breezes right past her own boyfriend to give Dean a hug first, because she's Dean's favorite little shit in the whole world. She gives Castiel a hug second, hiding a smile while Sam frowns in his sad-puppy way, and then proceeds to talk to the girls and ignore Sam for a bit longer. Dean adores her. He's never adored anyone more.
With that, Sam stands to swing around the table and walk away, off to bed, most likely. Dean stares after him for a while, then turns his gaze back to his beer and stares at that instead.
it's not like Cas hasn't been confusing the shit out of him pretty regularly. He doesn't even know what the hell is going on, or what they're even doing, half the time.
"Yeah. No offense, but before...you looked kinda older. And more exhausted. And pretty done with the world as a whole," Sam points out.
Cas declares, arching an eyebrow, "I have all intentions of doing that at some point. Will you listen?"
The moment Cas steps in and kisses him, walking him backwards, Dean forgets what the hell he was talking about in the first place. Cas has his hands in Dean's hair, cupping the back of his neck, keeping them connected as they go stumbling backwards. Dean's already trying to work that fucking trenchcoat off.
"I love—" Dean snorts and holds up a finger, waving it under his nose. "You almost got me, you little shit. That was pretty good, I'll give you that."
Embarrassed, he looks away and drinks the last two swallows in his cup. All those damn times he got uncomfortable about Cas watching him sleep, and now look at him. Oh how the table turns. He doesn't mean in it a creepy way, though. Cas just looks nice while he's sleeping deeply—kinda soft, kinda messy. Lovely, if Dean were inclined to such verbiage. There's really no other way to describe him.
because it doesn't stop there. If Dean says something bad about himself, Castiel argues with him on it. He can't say that he's an idiot without Castiel stepping in to say that, actually, he's very intelligent. He can't say that he's an asshole without Castiel telling him that he's more, that he's good with kids and kind and easy to get along with and actually quite funny. He can't say that he looks like shit without Castiel staring at him blankly and, in a very flat voice, declaring that he should shut up because there's no one else more beautiful.
Dean sighs and heaves himself up off the couch. Shuffling up the hall and into the room, he manages to make it to the bed with minor incidents. He only stubs his toe on the side of the dresser, which makes him hiss and curse under his breath, but he's otherwise fine. He slides into bed in silence.
Dean looks at Cas and wants to reach out. He wants to wipe the small bit of toothpaste away with his thumb. He wants to poke the hole in Cas' shirt. He wants to pat his hair down, or maybe push his fingers through and make it stand up even more. He wants… It's almost
"I don't—" Dean grimaces and looks away, shoulders jerking up and landing somewhere around his ears. He's uncomfortable. Very much so. "It's not really...like that."
He waits, because he isn't sure what else to do, and he watches. There's a shift in Dean's expression, life coming back to his face. A twitch in between his eyebrows, like a small crack forming that slowly grows until it eventually shatters. Dean is abruptly looking right at him, focused, his eyes wide and his lips parting as his breath leaves him all at once.
"No, I fell in love with my best friend," Zoey tells him, lips twitching. "She took it in stride, but in the end, I couldn't deal with it. Kinda hard being that close to someone you're in love with, knowing you can't have 'em. So, the friendship didn't make it, but hey, you win some and you lose some."
here is a second that he could be. What follows is usually just simply missing him, a deep well of longing that seems to have no bottom, which always leads right back into that giddiness that Cas is back overall.
"I have no desire to speak to you," Castiel declares, and that is very true. He doesn't. He has nothing to say to Dean. He has already said enough.
this conversation. Of course he does. "I've been slapped during sex before, and that was—yeah. Scratching, biting, all that jazz. Once, a lovely lady from Minnesota saw my angel blade and got the hots for it, you know, so I—"
and Dean still loves him like Cas hasn't thrown out all the stops to make sure they'd never become what Dean had hoped they would.
After that, it's hard for Dean to keep his hands off of Castiel for the remainder of the day. He just keeps touching him. His hips, his hands, his shoulders. He can't help it, because no one says anything, and no one
"Yep. I have to leave in about…" Jack tugs his phone from his pocket, then looks panicked. "Oh, I need to go
Dean's legs give out, making him stumble back against the wall and slowly sink down it. He stares around with wide eyes, searching for what's no longer there. Cas is gone. He's gone.
Dean, on the other hand… He seems to grow agitated a little. Not in the way that suggests he dislikes the hugging, but more restless, as if he can't hold still for too long. Castiel is quite sure that's it until Dean says, "Not that I'm complaining, but—"
Castiel sighs. "You see my point. You have to have some input. You are a person, Dean, one with desires and dislikes. I need to know those."
Locking him in, containing him… It's hard. Yet, Dean almost welcomes it in a weird way. It's distracting, and it keeps him from being too focused on other things. Like the things he wants but can't have, as Michael so eloquently put it.
Dean's face clears as he blinks, then his eyebrows drop into a displeased scowl. "Oh, so you just...didn't care that I was getting laid at my leisure?"
"Kyle still lives with his parents, and they won't have it in their house, so I get to have the extra. They're in a cooler," Sorine informs him, backing up towards her car with a crooked smile. "Bottle or can?"
"Hello, Dean," is all he manages to get out, and he's clearly about to say something else, but whatever it is escapes him in a low
wanting to hear it. Now? He'd go his whole life never finding out. He'd spend his every remaining second confused and not having anything confirmed. Because, if confirmation comes at the cost of Cas, Dean would spend forever in the dark so long as he would get to stay beside him. If he has to lose Cas to turn on the lights, he'd rather close his eyes and see nothing else forever.
Sam, from the other side of the table, lets out a snort. His eyes are bright, playful. "Why didn't I get a cup of coffee, Cas? What, are you his wife now?"
his coffee. So, there's silence between them until then. Cas spends it not moving from his spot, his fingers dancing restlessly over a different mug—nervous, still so nervous, visibly so. Dean keeps glancing at him, unable to help it.
Shuddering out a deep breath, Dean uncurls his fingers and shakes his head. Even right now, he's grinning down at his hands. He's so stupid. He hates himself for being this ridiculous, but he doesn't know how to stop. Before that phone call tonight, before Cas stepped forward, alive and in the flesh, Dean couldn't smile a real smile like this at all. What's wrong with him?
stop? There was nothing sexual about Dean's touch, but that doesn't stop Castiel from turning to his metaphorical bandaid for the second time today. A shower. He needs a shower.
of you. The world's saved, Chuck is handled, it's just us now, okay? Time to move on and let shit go. We're finally free, right? So just...stop being idiots."
"Yeah, I'm good with that." Dean hums, swaying forward, his eyes drooping. "Is it always gonna be like this?"
"I—I...whew. I don't know why I get so angry. I just know that it's always been there, and when things go bad, it just comes out. And I—I can't stop it, no matter how bad I want to. I just can't stop it." Dean swallows thickly, fighting valiantly to stop crying, to get his shit together, then letting it happen anyway. Cas deserves to know. Cas should get to hear this, all of it. "And I—I forgive you.
It hits Dean square in the chest, just another betrayal all over again. Not enough. He's not enough, and it's all going so wrong, and Cas is making all of this so fucking hard.
Dean shakes his head. "Nah, I almost did in Purgatory, too, but then you—" He blinks, rearing back a little bit. "Dude, did you
"So why'd you leave me, Cas?" Dean asks, and it comes out raw and strangled, sort of just ripping right out of the pit of him, where that ache lives.
Dean grunts and mutters, "You're not even six months old, kid. Anyway, there's no way in hell I'm teaching you to drive in Baby."
so hard that it's just making things harder on himself. I told him to just accept it, especially if it'll help him sleep at night."
"Yeah, man, sure," Dean mutters, staring at the crown of Cas' head. He has the most invasive, ridiculous urge to press a kiss to the top of Cas' head, and it's genuinely a struggle not to.
clothes but all these clothes. You don't have to wear so many layers, Cas. Actually, it would be better for me, personally, if you didn't."
That it would feel so similar to wanting a woman, except it's Castiel, and somehow that's something else entirely, something bigger. That it would rock him solid and shut him down, the surge of his own want knocking the ghost of daddy issues past right out of his goddamn body. He didn't know that it would feel this
"Figure it out," Dean teases, back to working on the belt and rocking forward so their noses will brush together, whispering into Cas' mouth. "Come on, sweetheart. Weren't you some kinda strategist once? I'm sure you'll think of something."
And Dean's going to do it anyway for a multitude of reasons, but it all boils down to the main one. Dean knows deep down in the squeeze-and-release of his heart, where the blood flows out and circulates through every part of him, that Cas is it for him. He's never going to fall in love with anyone else. He's never going to fall out of love with Cas. There's nowhere to go from here but forward, because Dean can't go back, and he can't turn away, and if this is the one thing his sad, shitty life will grant him, he'll be glad to have suffered to get it.
"Do you know, comparatively speaking, that's not actually that inaccurate? I've existed for a long time, and he's a significantly short portion of it."
He must be pretty transparent, because Sam steps up beside him and mutters, "I don't think I've ever seen you get jealous like this before."
"Okay," Dean whispers, opening his eyes to stare down at his boots. On one hand, there's something to the fact that Cas knows he needs quarters. That's something to be proud of, right? A bright side? Jesus fucking Christ, he hates himself. "Uh, I'll leave some. Don't worry about it."
"Don't think so," Dean mumbles, barely managing to say it because he's not currently pissed off or in the throes of passion. God, he's so fucked up.
It's really nice, actually. Dean's always liked fishing, and Cas seems to enjoy it for the most part, too. Well, he doesn't like putting the bait on the hook, so Dean has to do it for him. He feels bad for the worms, which shouldn't be cute but is anyway. He also insists on throwing all the fish back, no matter how many times Dean insists that they could actually have fish for dinner. He won't hear a word of it, and he murmurs quiet apologies every time he works the hook out of the various fish's mouths.
The seventh thing that happens is that Dean tries to self-sabotage (even if he doesn't know that's what it is at the time, but no one ever does, really), only to fail spectacularly at it for the very first time in his long, self-sabotaging career.
Castiel has absolutely no idea how his appreciation for bees correlates to his rather complex sexuality, nor does he understand if this means that Sam knows or not. As much as Castiel would like to be grateful that Sam and Dean do not care about his preferences, he can't when his main preference
As it turns out, Shonda has exactly the information they need. She didn't know she did because she doesn't know ghosts are real, or that the painting that's been moved through family members is technically haunted. In the end, the painting burns, and everything works out. Suck on that, Tim.
Cas' head snaps up from where he's showing Eileen one of his rocks—one of those he keeps outside because they apparently make his garden look prettier, or whatever. "Wine?" he calls, the same way a dog would say
It's here now, and Dean sinks into it with a helpless sigh, his whole body unclicking like he's been unspooled. It's not a particularly deep kiss, but it doesn't have to be. Just the feeling of it, the feeling it invokes, is enough. The press of mouths, the slide of tongues, the catch of teeth. It's so,
is true, but it's not like she doesn't already know that. There's nothing to say about death, not really. There never is. So he doesn't say anything at all.
Cas is kissing him as deeply as he always has, but deeper. Harder. Panic tinged in it. A plea in every swipe of his tongue, anger in every harsh bite on Dean's lip. It's like he's the one consumed with emotion now, and Dean didn't know he could feel like this, or even this much. Can he?
Dean is startled in his own way. Startled by the way Cas looks, yeah, but it's more than that, too. He's been caught off-guard by the sudden absence of the ache in his gut and the way the world comes into sharp focus, like a bubble around someone's head finally popping. The ringing in his ears is just
Dean barks a laugh and shakes his head, raising his beer to his mouth. He swallows more of it down, hating that it seems to go sour in his throat. After, he tosses the empty bottle from hand-to-hand restlessly. "Look, things between me and him… They are what they are, and what they are is
The wrench in his plans turns out to be a woman a few years older than him named Zoey, who looks younger than him, wears black lipstick over full lips, and has dreads all the way down to her waist. She's got the whole leather get-up going for her—leather pants, leather top, leather jacket. It probably wouldn't look good on anyone other than her, and Dean doesn't even have to look outside to know she drives a motorcycle—he looks anyway, and sure enough, there's one out there when there wasn't before she arrived. In other words, Zoey could probably chew him up and spit him out, or grind him to dust under her boots, and he'd thank her.
"I want so many things," Dean assures him, his chest heaving. "Jesus fuckin' Christ, sweetheart, you have no
"Ah." Cas' lips curl up, breaking into a broad grin that Dean is in no way prepared for. Jesus Christ, it's so
Cas' hands tighten around Dean's wrists, then he wrenches Dean's arms back further, tighter. Dean chokes out a groan, half-frustration and half-desire. His head falls forward, and all he gets—all that he
"I love stickers, too," Jack announces very seriously, turning in his chair to stare at Dean with wide, excited eyes. "Do you have some?"
Dean tells Cas as much in a phone call. It's stilted on both of their ends. Cas' answers are short, and Dean's words are accusatory. He can feel how pissed they are at each other right now, which burns through him and makes him ache all at one time. Still, he can't stop himself from telling Cas to watch himself, needing to warn him, no matter how angry they are. The only thing that would make any of this worse is if something happened to Cas. Angry as Dean is, that would… He'd never survive that.
Dean has just enough time to open his mouth for a warning, but not enough time to actually get it out. In the next second, the hand yanks, and Cas goes down like a statue, hitting the deck before he's abruptly wrenched into the water. He's immediately tugged down, and Dean proceeds to freak the fuck out, automatically trying to shuck his jacket.
He stares at Castiel, waiting for that starburst of warmth in his chest to go away, and Castiel stares right back, blinking.
"I think, for him, it was all three," Dean murmurs, staring off into the distance with furrowed eyebrows.
"Oh, and Dumblefuck was so innocent? Please. That old geezer was pulling the strings behind everything. He had all the knowledge and all the cards, and he sent these kids off on this stupid ass quest with barely any knowledge. He's definitely Chuck. Fuck Dumbledore. Voldemort was… Oh, Voldemort was Lucifer. Acting out 'cause nobody hugged him as a child, always around and coming back when everyone hated him. Both of 'em were ugly, too."
Cas works four days out of the week, and his shifts last for five hours, generally. The first time he goes to work, Dean feels unreasonably off-kilter, like someone just snatched his safety-blanket off of him, which is just ridiculous. Jack's still in Heaven that first day, so Dean's alone. He's left to his own devices to find something to do.
When Dean wakes up, it's to a hot arm thrown over him and a hot body pressed along his back. He is currently being spooned. There is definitely a dick pressed against his ass—thankfully not hard, because Dean has no idea what he'd do about that. Probably rock back into it. He's not going to think about that right now. It's way too early.
"Can I…?" Cas' hand lands on the side of his neck, his body twisting towards him like his plants growing towards the sun. His thumb presses into Dean's jaw, then shifts to rest against Dean's lips, and there's a question there. Unspoken in the tense silence, but so very loud.
Castiel thinks he does, now. He doesn't want to hear it, because it's crystal clear. He's not sure if Dean could have made it any more obvious how his feelings have changed them irreparably. He drags his gaze up, aching with it, with knowing that he made yet another mistake, knowing that he would do it again to save Dean's life.
It's like a challenge, one that Dean's way too into. It heightens everything, so goddamn stimulating that his muscles are jumping and every brush of his own fingers as he rolls his pants and underwear over his thighs makes him tremble. The few times that he gets too eager, he ends up gagging and having to slow down, and it makes him moan way too loudly, too obviously, showing how good this is for him. It exposes him, and he just doesn't
It happens so fast. Too fast. Dean barely gets any time to say or do anything. He just slips wildly against the wall, panicked bursts of air escaping him, and he's forced to watch as the Empty surges forward to first consume Billie, then slip over Cas and take him away. Just like that.
He knows he'll go fishing and perch on rocks, imagining another line in the water along with his own. His happiest memory with his dad, fishing, and now it's improved and softened and replaced. Dean will look for Jack in the flowing water of creeks, and he'll hang a fishing hook off his mirror so he can reach out and touch it every day. He'll tell his kid stories long after he's around to hear them.
"Right," Dean says eventually, gruffly. He looks down at his shoes. "I'm not gonna tell you how to live your life, man. It's—you know, yours. Do your thing, love who you love, whatever. I can't really stop you from loving me, if that's what you've decided to do, but I don't—I can't—"
"Of course you did," Dean mutters, turning his face into the pillow a little, the rest of his words coming out muffled with exhausted sarcasm. "Why wouldn't you? It's stupid, so
"I'm not you," is what Sam says, which is so few words for having said so much. Dean swallows and looks away, and Sam releases a heavy yet shaky exhale. "So, yeah. You should go after him."
It's that, in truth, that gets to him. Because Cas is right. This isn't about Dean right now. If all he can do is be there by Jack when he goes, then he should damn well do it. He takes another moment to breathe, blinking hard, and then he turns around.
Things ease up between Dean and Castiel while Jack is present. It's simpler, somehow, and Castiel doesn't know why. He basks in that, too, grateful to see that they still can be some semblance of what they once were. He'd think it was an act if not for how genuine it all feels. Dean's smiles are warm, his laughter lovely, so beautiful and bright that he's almost blistering. He's so often overflowing with love that he can get away with never saying it. For all that he thinks he's a stain on those who get too close, he's more like a hearth—the moment he allows himself to embrace the love he has for his family, he warms everyone around him.
"I called her, because I planned to leave and meet with her tomorrow, but she...changed my mind. She insisted I stick around for at least a week and see where things went. She was remarkably kind to me about the entire thing, and she said there was only a twenty percent chance you didn't want to suck my dick," Castiel explains.
Dean sets his burger aside, looking up and blinking hard as he reaches out to rub his hand over his mouth. He didn't have much of an appetite before, but there's no chance of him eating anything else.
"A very wise thought," Cas murmurs, swaying closer, his hand landing on Dean's arm and dragging up, pressing into his skin. It's exhilarating.
"Like I said, he's a goddamn fool," Lee repeats softly, pushing away from the sink to press right up against Dean, his broad hand fitting into the curve of his neck. It doesn't fit the way Cas' does.
Dean jolts against the counter, his elbow knocking into the side of it, yanking him out of his own head. Well, obviously Zoey doesn't find interest in all those things because she doesn't know half of them. Whatever. It's probably his lips, or something.
Dean's jaw clenches. "Ya think? You know what pisses me off the most? You're actually back now, and you're acting like—you're being like this."
The expression quickly shutters, and he shakes his head. "No. If this is where we're at now, telling you won't salvage anything. It will only make things worse."
laid on Dean Winchester. She had no right. Neither did he, to be fair, but he wasn't the type to ask for permission back then. Apparently Anna wasn't either. He'd think of her more fondly if he didn't have
Dean doesn't give in. He only pulls back, then returns to whatever mockery he's assigned to himself as his new mission in life with a determination that Castiel didn't think him capable of when it came to
Well, Cas is a pretty good-looking dude. Dean's kind of crazy about him as it is, so it's not like he's got that far to go to get
Dean waves him off and starts tugging on Sam's shirt to get him to stand up. "Yeah, yeah, whatever."
Dean swallows and looks down. He resists the urge to cross his arms. It's a defensive gesture, but there's no need for it. He's not under attack.
"I genuinely do not have favorites. Everything I do for and with Jack, I would do for and with her, if she wanted me to," Cas murmurs, lips tipping down.
and he thinks he's got to be the biggest goddamn idiot alive to have missed it in the first place. He can't even call it his lightbulb moment because it's as glaring as the fucking sun.
To make matters worse, Dean keeps having these weird, out-of-it moments where his vision goes funny and the world seems to fade in and out. It happens with no warning, a bizarre thing that he can't make any sense of. He worries, but he doesn't want to be worried. He's so tired of being worried.
"Uh," Dean says, a little unsure himself. He doesn't really know what he's doing, just that he sort of wants to do
Before he's really thought about it, he's curling in closer to Castiel, trying to do—something. Anything. He's not sure what, exactly, but he doesn't get very far anyway. Castiel puts his hand on Dean's chest, releasing a shuddering breath.
Cas stares at him for a long, long moment. There's something about his expression, something about his eyes. Dean can't really put his finger on it, like it's some kind of unfathomable knowledge that he'll never understand, that Cas knows intricately. It's enough to yank him right out of his own self-hatred, stealing his focus entirely.
"I'm not sure." Castiel looks thoughtful for a long moment, humming. "I like to read. Movies are nice. I considered botany at one point."
Castiel eventually notices him in the doorway, startling briefly, then looking annoyed by it. He still smiles, though—a warm, genuine smile, not tinged with bitterness or pain. "Dean," he says, "I didn't see you. Claire and Kaia had to get back on the road. Kaia wanted me to tell you thank you."
to me? Why can't you just open your goddamn mouth and consult with me before you run off and do something stupid that helps
The brook in the distance continues to trickle, and the flowers are in full bloom, and Dean thinks about how he's right here yet again. It's almost like nothing has changed, like where it started in this meadow was all that he was ever going to get. Everything else? That was just a flash of what could have been.
It's kind of funny, Dean thinks. This is sort of something he would associate with hunters, except a little nicer and fancier. It's out of the way. Minimal neighbors—just the one, apparently. The only thing is that it's not some cabin in the mountains. No, it's just a lovely little yellow house surrounded by green fields of grass and trees in the distance.
"Sorry I brought it up," Dean mutters, looking straight ahead, a surge of annoyance hitting him. The anger spikes, and he's bitter all over again, words escaping him accusatory and harsh. "Maybe if you didn't just up and
Claire grunts. "I just told you not to react like that. And don't—don't think you, like, saved me from them, because you didn't. You fucked up my life. You still fucked up my life. You know that."
Dean reaches out with his free hand to hesitantly touch the wrinkled skin between Castiel's eyebrows. He's still unsure about it, just a little. Slow in the touching he does when he's not primarily focused on sex. "S'okay. I mean, it's not, but that's kinda a hard line not to trample all over anyway. Everyone does. It's a pretty big expectation to have."
of this. She just scoffs, then whips around with her long, blonde hair flying as she stomps her way back into the Bunker.
He weighs the problem in his mind. Perhaps he should just see it through to the end. He has suffered many different things. Dean wanting to pester him consistently in a way that usually ends with him hiding away to find sexual release really isn't something he can wholeheartedly label as suffering. The parts that hurt truly do, but the rest? Well, if Dean hurting him was enough to make him leave without ever coming back, he would have left long ago and never returned. This is just a new form of pain he's not used to. He can adjust.
"I've already made up my mind," Dean mutters, reaching out to grab the coffee pot the moment it finishes. "And no. I think I'll just show up, actually, and then he can answer my fucking question, and then he can dump me to my goddamn face, and
to, he relaxes into it and reaches out to fist his hand in Cas' shirt, needing something to hold onto. There's a bite to this kiss, harsh like a fight, hot—so fucking
If not now, when? Dean can't just sit around and wait for sunshine and rainbows. He'll be waiting forever. His life—their lives—is
Dean has absolutely no idea what the fuck he was saying in the first place. He blinks slow and stupid, fingers twitching. "You're back?" he asks, like an idiot. "For good, I mean. You'll stay?"
"Yes, I…" Cas' gaze seems to get lost along Dean's arms, trailing over them with a kind of helpless expression, his own want so clear on his face that it's like a punch to the gut. He swallows and blinks, looking back up at Dean again. "Sam wanted me to—he, ah, asked if I would tell you that he…"
and it—it just does something to him. Something inexplicable. Something terrifying. Something amazing. He wraps around Cas like a goddamn vine, now that they're here, because not even an act of
"Be more careful," Cas says as he pushes to his feet, looking at Dean with a faint frown, just barely showing emotion on his face. "I was busy. I can't come every time you pray, Dean."
He puts his food back in the bag and goes out to get his own change of clothes for a shower. When he shuts himself in the bathroom, the door closes with an almost-silent click—shame. He takes his time, going through the motions, guilt eating away at him until he almost can't stand himself. After, he scrubs himself dry a little too harshly with the towel.
"Yeah," Dean gasps out, struggling a little with his button. "Pretty much all night. Look, can you make me coffee? Put it in a cup I can take on the road."
"I'm sorry," Sorine whispers, her eyes drifting shut when Dean focuses on her. "That was—I just get really… It's hard. I'm sorry."
The movement of Cas' hair blowing in the wind. The belt on his coat, just a little looser and longer than it used to be. The color of his coat, too, a shade slightly different than before. The grass brushing the very ends of the coat, like fingertips only
"Yeah, I do," Benny echoes now, and he shuffles closer, mouth immediately latching onto Dean's neck.
"What?" Cas jolts when Dean reaches out to point at the coffee cup, and then he slides it across the counter. "Oh, yes. Of course."
like it's some kind of exchange. Is there a customer service number I can call and put in a goddamn complaint?"
At some unclear time later, Cas tugs himself away just enough to sit up and start working his shirt over his head. Dean can see the outline of him in the dark, and he lays there, chest heaving, so goddamn ready that he's blown past eager and landed on desperate. He watches the blob of Cas' shirt go sailing away, lost in the dark.
"Many things," Cas tells him, his tone low and intimate like he's telling secrets. He reaches out and touches the pads of his fingers against Dean's arm, a barely-there touch. "You, most of all. Just you."
Cas blinks just once, eyelids staying closed for a little too long, then he nods again. "Yes, exactly."
angry about the way Dean is treating him...but he genuinely can't complain about the results. They do bring him to this point, where he sets aside his shame and restraint to indulge in hedonistic pleasures that might only be amplified for the reaction Castiel imagines Dean would have if he knew about them. Not that he will ever know about them, because Castiel likes living in ideals.
"Little over a month now," Dean forces himself to say, his fingers twitching and curling into fists. He stuffs them in his pockets and looks away.
While Dean is in the shower, Castiel has to talk himself out of yet another shower, simply for more knee-wobbling experiences. He's frustrated and pent up from Dean constantly pushing him all day, but he's quite sure an additional shower would be ever so slightly suspicious. What he does in the privacy of a room that's never felt like his anyway, however...well, that's his business.
drunk, but fucked up enough to be aware that he is, except he can't do anything about it. He knows that he's losing his inhibitions, and he just doesn't care.
Nonetheless, he sticks to it. He plans to do what he has to do. Cas doesn't talk to him about it. In fact, Cas doesn't even talk to him at all. He seems to communicate with Sam and only Sam, and Dean doesn't mention it. He focuses, pouring every cell of himself into staying on task. This purpose, this burden, it's his cross to bear, and bear it he will.
him. Sam is still puttering around, cooking, but he keeps turning to look at Eileen and grin at her. Eileen is literally right next to him, so she absolutely won't miss a move he makes. Claire and Kaia are on the other side of Castiel, but they can see him, too.
sometimes to—to want to keep on living the same goddamn torture over and over again. I thought handling Chuck would change that, would make it easier, and that's why it was so important. I wanted to be free to have a life I wanted to live. But never,
Unreasonable? No. Castiel doesn't think he's being unreasonable at all. He's doing both of them a favor, in fact. The sooner they can fall into the waiting rhythm of ignorance, the better off they will be in the future. Castiel just needs time. He needs space. If Dean will get the message, if he'll just...back off, then Castiel can relax enough to at least be able to pretend that everything is okay.
"Well, maybe if you weren't so set on being an asshole about it, I wouldn't be one back," Dean snaps at him, his jaw clenched.
to seek penance for my actions by staying in Purgatory, but you and the will of Heaven made that very difficult," Cas mutters.
"Ah," Sam says delicately. He makes a face and reaches around to scratch the back of his head, clearing his throat. "Right, so...you two
"Over you?" Castiel asks, his irritation with Dean coming back slowly, trickling through him. It's not quite what it has been for the last two days, but it looks like it could get there. For now, it mostly seems to be curiosity.
"We have to—Dean, we have to—" Cas rattles against him for a moment, clinging even tighter, and Dean has to be the one to peel them apart.
Dean clamors to his feet and abandons his beer, following Castiel towards his room. It feels like being led to the gallows. Dean's never really had to do anything like this. He's pretty sure Holly in the eleventh grade doesn't count—he'd dumped her like an asshole, and she slapped him, but that doesn't really compare to this. He doubts Holly was
"What? He's basically fifty," Claire mutters. "That's, like, half of a hundred. Can you imagine? No thanks. If I don't kick it by the time I'm forty, I'm jumping in front of a bus. Sorry, sweetheart."
He doesn't know where, exactly, they stand. He's been gone. Getting possessed by an archangel is a pretty big life change, all things considered, so who the fuck knows what's been warped and altered because of it. Are they still…?
Dean thinks he's always going to forgive Cas, no matter what they go through. There's danger in that, in knowing it with so much certainty, and he's almost thankful that he's going to die soon, just so he doesn't have to keep existing in that knowledge.
how much of an asshole he's being. "You gonna kick me out? Tell me you don't want me here? Go ahead."
The last sentence is spoken into the small space between their mouths, and Dean rails against the closeness, against how easy it is to
Dean chokes out a weak laugh and turns to rest his forehead against Cas' temple, then brushes his lips against his cheek because he's a goddamn idiot and his common sense has been drained through his dick. When he pulls back a little, he mumbles, "I bet you did. God, I need a shower.
Dean's eyes flutter shut. "What about you? A nap is somethin' I wanna do, but you wanted—you wanted other things. What was it? Oh. Tell me a poem. You gotta know one right off the top of your head, right? One you think I'll like."
Dean swallows. "Yeah, man. You can—you can come in. I've got something to show you anyway. Come look at this."
"As soon as Jack takes me," Cas tells him, his voice hushed, apologetic. "He mentioned that he hoped to visit with you and Sam before we went and at least tell you both of what he'd achieved. He knew I would come here, but neither of us expected that you would be waiting when I did."
"You don't have—" Dean snaps his mouth shut and freezes like a startled deer when Cas abruptly leans across the space between them, reaching out to catch his face in one hand, tipping it up so their mouths will meet in the middle.
alrighty, folks, i am back to drop off yet another longfic and continue on my merry way. you're welcome. life's been a little crazy for me, as of late, so im indulging in some very lovely destiel-related escapism here.
When Sam notices them noticing him, he raises his water bottle as an explanation, smiles at them like this all completely normal, then walks right out of the kitchen without saying a goddamn word.
"Well, he doesn't have to be a wuss about it," Dean mutters, frowning as he heads for a cabinet to get a wine glass. One of the smaller ones.
"Dean," Cas says, opening his eyes and tipping his head down to look at him with an arched eyebrow, "I thought that was rather obvious."
and he's terrified that he's put that in jeopardy. He's scared he's lost it already. He can't lose Cas again. He
"You fuckin' poet," Dean bursts out, his hips canting up at the feeling of Cas' finger sliding in just a little, only the tip. The joke flashes through Dean's mind, then dissipates before he can grab onto it and toss it out into the world where it belongs. "If you're tryna make me feel better, you're wasting your time, man. I feel—I'm feeling pretty good as it is."
"I thought everyone was." Dean stares resolutely out the window, trying not to shift with the increasing tempo of his heart. He's not going to be stupid about this. He's
In the next second, Dean finally wrestles out of his jacket, and before Sam can truly protest, he sprints down the length of the deck and dives into the water. By the time he resurfaces, he's among a sludge of dead bodies—gross—and there's a splash behind him, indicating that Sam jumps in, too. Probably for the woman, because that's clearly not Dean's target right now.
badly. It's selfish of him, once again, but that's a feeling he could get addicted to, even if he'll never act on it, or feel the same.
"You sound like a teenage girl. But Daddy, I love him! Girl, you are fifteen and you've known him for three days. Calm down."
It's not something he'll admit out loud, but Dean wants to go home. Go back to his own time. Fuck Zachariah for this bullshit.
Claire and Kaia stay the night, retiring earlier than everyone else, despite being much younger. Considering the hunt, though, it makes sense. Sam and Eileen retreat to the Dean Cave for movie night—apparently they're having a stay-in date, which Dean is fond of with Castiel, so he knows all about those. Castiel, however, drags him off to bed to make good on his promise of a reward from the coffee, as well as apparently releasing some tension from being touched by Dean all day.
he thinks. He's internally begging himself not to go down this road. If he thinks it, he won't be able to unthink it, and thinking it is a really,
After, Dean slumps back with a moan, panting and trying to reorient himself. He feels like he, himself has been fundamentally changed. Rearranged. Shaken up. Jesus
proved that," Dean tells him, raising his eyebrows. "Slow down, maybe, but stop? Nah, you're in the shit until you're forced out. Most do it young, but we got lucky, I guess."
He can't finish. He can't put that thought out there, the one that suggests hope for them. Just the thought that maybe Dean can clean his mess up a little, and Cas doesn't have to worry about them losing their family, and
"Yeah," Dean whispers, "I know," and he folds in to kiss him slow and deep, warm and unhurried, as if they have all the time in the world to have this.
Besides, the kid's clearly excited to be helping, and Dean isn't about to pop his balloon. He's got a lot to make up for, so he might as well start here.
So, the ghost of daddy issues past is more of a poltergeist, whatever. It doesn't have to be an issue. Dean's not
He fucked up, just like he always does, and at least half of his anger is at himself. And, if he keeps going on like this, he's never going to be able to make it right.
"We're okay." Dean braces himself, then reaches out to clap Cas on the shoulder, counting to three in his head, giving a careful squeeze, then dropping his hand like it's no big deal. "Seriously, we're fine. All the shit we've been through, and you think some sex is what does us in? Come on, man, I'd like to think our friendship is a little stronger than that."
that he's crying. He knows that, and he knows Sam is concerned, but he doesn't really care, either. There's nothing else in this world he'd like to know more, and Cas treats it like it's just some offhand fact that Dean might find vaguely intriguing. Yes, yes, alive again, moving along.
"I went to the hospital a few weeks after she died. I checked myself in with chest pains, and I thought—I mean, I
Dean can hear himself making these god-awful noises, like something going off to a corner to die in misery. He's
"Yeah, well, Dean's not a very kind person either. He's giving you a terrible gay experience, and that's just fucked up. Go date someone else."
"I get the picture, Cas," Dean cuts in breathlessly, telling his brain to shut the hell up when it points out how exposed he is right now. What he would not give to have Cas' fingers in his mouth right this second, but he unfortunately only has two hands.
"So," Dean says when he's made a dent in his coffee, and he feels a small thrill of amusement shoot through him when Cas jumps again at the sound of his voice. "Heading to Dodge City today."
"I told Jack that I was sorry that I wasn't here for him," Cas says. "I think I owe you my regret, too."
"I want to ruin you," Cas whispers, like the confession is shameful instead of the hottest thing Dean has heard in years. "You couldn't possibly understand how deeply I want to just
Maybe. Possibly. Dean hasn't decided yet. There's still the small chance that Dean has a secret desire to just spend the rest of his life hanging out with his best friend. Nothing wrong with that. Maybe that's all this is. It doesn't have to be...more.
"I actually do wanna tell you something really important, something I—I should have said a long time ago," Dean murmurs.
A part of him that's bigger than he likes just wants to beg, if he's got to. And that's not him. He doesn't do shit like that—except he has, for Cas, and would be willing to again right now. Just hit his knees and say that yes, it is stressful, and yes, they do struggle with it, and maybe it would be easier to just stop subjecting themselves to the same push-and-pull of complications they cradle between them, but he doesn't
One day, though, he slips up, and it becomes vibrantly clear why Jack's not supposed to. It starts out innocently enough, to be fair.
Dean's tired of feeling sorry for himself. He knows he's just stuck in this cycle of hating the world, hating himself, and hating everything. And then he circles back around to anger. It's always fucking anger, and that always gets him nowhere good. He's ruined so many things on that anger. He lost Cas because of that anger.
Dean hits the door with a thud, and Castiel is on him before he can even react, wading into the storm. It's a lovely thing, getting the permission to do so. There's no room for doubt here on his end either; he has to trust that Dean isn't lying, that Dean will do whatever is necessary to end it if he can't do it, or doesn't want to. Castiel can't exactly do this gently, and perhaps he's enjoying that a bit too much.
