"There was no need to do something like this, Sherlock. There’ll be other cases. I'm not dying, you know, I'm just going back to work." John hesitates. "Unless your client and his friends actually manage to kill us tonight."
But it doesn't take forever. It just takes moments, really. Much too short for him to enjoy Sherlock's hands in his hair, to admire his trembling thighs and to revel in the sheer power he feels over his best friend, the cleverest man in London.
When he gets home again that day, having removed three generously sized warts, and been puked on once (by an eighty year old woman – the nurses do their best in sparing him the children. “Considering.”) he is thoroughly unsurprised to find Sherlock on his sofa again.
"I'm not supposed ter do magic, 'specially not in fron' of muggles, but I guess you're not gonna let him go if I don'," Hagrid sighed and raised his pink umbrella, pointing it at an innocent vase. He muttered something under his breath, and the vase exploded.
"Quidditch will be held in the second week of term. Anyone interested in playing for their house team should contact Madam Hooch.
The entrance was dusty and plain, no signs of forced entry. Sherlock walked through, taking in every detail. Harry followed close behind him, much more nervous that he usually was. He almost screamed when Fred and George came up behind him.
"And now, before we go to bed, let us sing the school song!" cried Dumbledore. Harry saw that the rest of the teachers' smiled became quite fixed.
"They're goblins. Very intelligent, and very protective," answered McGonagall. "This is one of the safest places in the world, if you are caught attempting to steal something, the goblins will be ruthless." Harry looked at each of them warily and saw the intelligence and cunning behind their beady black eyes.
Sorry this took so long. I'm back at school and lockdown is over, so I've got a lot less time. Thank you for reading. :)
“Charing Cross Road. I’ll tell you when to stop,” said Harry to the cabbie before they drove off. Draco looked at him oddly.
Vault 713 has always been an interesting one. The first owner was found dead inside the vault after attempting to enter it without a registered goblin a few years before. This was the first of many wizards and witches who would suffer while using this vault.
"You head down, we'll be with you soon." Harry nodded and pulled on a hoodie, then ran down to the dining hall.
“And we’ll probably go on a case or something,” said Harry, smiling as the twins’ faces lit up with child-like glee.
By the time they finished breakfast, Harry was shaking so hard he had to clench every muscle in his boy just to walk to the lift. Sherlock looked at him, slightly worried, but John didn't pick up on it, unsurprisingly. Harry had always found it funny that even after living with Sherlock for years, John struggled with the simplest of deductions.
John looked astonished. An army wage did not get you to the Ritz. They sat in silence for a few minutes. It gradually grew more awkward until Harry burst through the door and dove onto the floor. He picked up the remote and turned on the TV, flicking through channels until he was on CBBC. Horrible Histories was on, the one show that Harry could never miss. John and Sherlock laughed and the tension resolved itself. Everyone in the family loved the show, even Sherlock. It was the only history that he knew. Harry was constantly making references and talking about it, so it was worth it.
"And this was just an everyday thing for you?" asked George incredulously as the five of them walked back up to the castle.
“Special circumstances,” replied Sherlock, helping Lestrade lift the limp headmaster. They turned to take him out of the room, but McGonagall stopped them, insisting that they dissaperate. No one looked too keen, but there were no verbal complaints as they linked hands and began twisting and squeezing through space once more.
shit happens and stuff, and it's not like i don't think all of you are awesome for reading it, but i rlly gotta wonder why you got this far,, it's a bad story.
"Excuse me, Madam Pince." The stern woman looked up from her book, eyeing Harry suspiciously. "I was wondering if you had any books on Occulemency?" Harry put on his best innocent eleven-year-old act. Madam Pince looked at him carefully, trying to find any evidence that the book Harry desired could be harmed. Upon finding nothing, she pointed him towards an empty isle near the restricted section.
"D-Dumbledore, wants to see you in his office," she said to Harry. Harry sighed and nodded, looking at his friends apologetically before following the student to the headmaster's office.
Harry smiled to himself as he pulled out his school list. It was quite long, and so far he only had his robes. He wandered through the shops, buying everything on his list and a few more things. He spent the most at Flourish and Blott's. There were so many books he wanted, he had to buy a bag with an undetectable expansion charm to carry them all. Harry wanted to disassemble it and figure out how the bag worked, but he knew it would be more useful whole.
"Just before we send Harry off to some school so secret the Prime Minister barely knows what it is, would you be able to prove the existence of magic?" inquired Sherlock.
“I know you didn’t go straight home,” said Sherlock when he came into the room. “But, if you show me how to make the tracking potion, I won’t tell John.” Harry nodded and grabbed the potion ingredients and a cauldron. Everyone came down from his room to the kitchen.
Harry heard the words of a fat monk. "Forgive and forget, I say, we ought to give him a second chance-"
Harry had also been plagued by nightmares. Dead bodies and crime scenes littered his sleeping mind, as did an odd-looking flat, the walls covered in newspaper clippings and a Cluedo board underneath a large mirror. There were other things in the flat too, things that might be ordinary alone, but together, were just a bit off. Harry couldn’t figure out what these things were, as dreams were always difficult to remember. For some reason, everything in his dreams was extremely familiar, even though he knew they were all made up by his imagination.
"Well," said Hagrid, "We need to buy your school supplies tomorrow, so I'll just stay overnight, if that's okay?" He raised an eyebrow at Sherlock who nodded. Then the four of them went their separate ways, Harry, John and Sherlock back to their rooms, Hagrid to the nearest sofa. It sank down slightly as he sat down. He sighed and pulled his coat closer around himself. There was something strange about Harry, Hagrid thought, he's going to do incredible things.
He sat back down. Harry didn't know whether to laugh or not. Everyone else was cheering and clapping, but Dumbledore was acting weirder than your average eccentric old man. Harry pushed the thoughts away. Headmasters rarely interacted with the students, so Harry felt sure he would have no issue avoiding him.
"Can we please go in, Mrs Hudson?" asked Harry, doing his best pleading voice. Mrs Hudson nodded and they went inside.
"The Sorting Ceremony will take place in a few minutes in front of the rest of the school. I suggest you all smarten yourselves up as much as you can while you are waiting." Her eyes lingered on Neville's cloak, which was clasped under his ear. Draco smoothed his flawless hair back nervously.
Even with his wand shining a bright light into the hole in the floor, he couldn't see the bottom. There was no ladder, and he didn't want to risk breaking a leg, so Harry closed the trapdoor and sat on top of it, wishing he knew just a few more spells.
"One of four in this house," said Sherlock. McGonagall raised an inquisitive eyebrow. "My brother," he gestured behind him, "my son," he pointed to Harry, "and my husband," he pointed at John, who waved at the professor.
"Perhaps. I think we might need a bit more information first. I don't want you to be in any danger," answered Sherlock. Harry and Hagrid nodded.
"Oh well, it could be worse. I could be a Malfoy," he whispered to Draco, who looked mock-hurt and rolled his eyes.
"No problem," replied Harry before going back to eating his waffles. John looked at his son's empty coffee cup disapprovingly.
"Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry is a place of immense secrecy," read Sherlock from Mycroft's text. "Every year, twenty or so children that have been signed up for secondary schools will be taken off the register with no explanation. Before this happens, parents will often report being sent hundreds of letters from this mysterious school. That was all I could find. Any details about the school itself are for the Prime Minister's eyes only." Sherlock sighed.
The three of them were walking past the front door to their rooms when their idle chat was interrupted by a massive boom. It happened again. Someone was trying to get in, and Harry had a feeling they were not friendly.
Days passed with Harry barely leaving his room, in a caffeine-induced craze, trying to find a way to prove that without even a shadow of doubt, that Sirius Black was innocent, and that Dumbledore was completely guilty. It was proving quite a challenge, but on the morning of Dumbledore’s trial, Harry sprinted from his room, a binder filled with hundreds of scribbled notes under his arm and proudly dropped it in front of Sherlock.
"Take him to the hospital wing," spat Snape at Seamus. Seamus grabbed Neville's arm and walked the whimpering boy out of the classroom.
When the day ended, Harry was exhausted and had a bit of a headache. John had let him have champagne as a treat, but Harry reckoned he might have drunk too much. He put all thoughts of his pain aside and went to congratulate his dads. They were grinning like fools as they climbed into a taxi. Harry almost climbed in with them, then stepped back and closed the door. He found Mrs Hudson and took a taxi with her back to the flat.
After about a month of this, Harry did the only logical thing. He sat them both down on the sofa as if they were clients, and began to talk to them.
"I'm going to adopt him, of course." The tall man then walked to the side of the road and hailed a taxi.
"We have an issue. We have reason to believe that Harry is being stalked, and it has escalated quite considerably." Lestrade sat up instantly. He looked at the worried faces of John and Sherlock and swore silently.
"I had way too much to drink last night," said John. Sherlock nodded in agreement. They both stood up, struggling to keep their balance as the hangover set in.
When Sherlock and John had replied to his letter, Sherlock too had been frustrated by the lack of science, but intrigued by the mystery. John had been more worried about the three-headed dog and the threat of death that could come to the curious. He had also been concerned about Harry being the Boy Who Lived and the possibility of a dark wizard coming to the school to find whatever had been moved from Gringotts.
"That is pretty cool. It's a shame I don't remember any of it, then again, the death of my birth parents doesn't seem like a fun thing to remember," said Harry. Draco nodded.
"Well, we've got Dumbledore. Whether he's trustworthy or even a good person doesn't matter. Enough people respect him or are afraid of him to know to leave Hogwarts alon-aaaa." A sharp pain shot through Harry's scar.
"When I call your name, you will put on the hat and sit on the stool to be sorted," she said. "Abbott, Hannah!"
"Do you want to go back to London already?" he said, opening the train door. Harry and Hermione smiled, then Harry shoved his book back into his trunk and quickly pulled a robe on, hoping no-one would notice it wasn't the full uniform. Then he closed the trunk and locked it with a spell before jumping out of the train to join his friends.
He walked through the castle in silence, not passing a single perfect or teacher. When he reached the third-floor corridor, the door was locked. He quickly opened the door with a spell and slipped inside.
A few long hours later, Draco, Harry, and Hermione were sitting under a tree beside the black lake, discussing their findings.
When dinner ended, Mycroft left to his study. John, Sherlock, and Harry moved to a living room and watched TV together like they did most nights. None of them spoke of magic or letters. The only thing that was said were Sherlock's comments about the shows they were watching.
"This is where we part. Here's your ticket," McGonagall handed Harry an envelope. "To get through to the platform, walk quickly through the barrier between platforms 9 and 10. And run if you're scared." Harry thanked her and said goodbye, then followed Sherlock to a staircase.
Together they not-so-carefully began moving the old man. Harry knew that McGonagall could easily use a spell to transport Dumbledore painlessly.
'We can't find anything, but your flat is filled with hundreds of letters. What happened here? We've got a cleanup crew in here, so you should be able to come back in a couple of days.'
"I suppose it makes sense. I've done some strange things that I always put down to circumstance, but I suppose it could be magic," Harry said.
"Of course he is. You can't expect him to stick around all day, can you?" said Draco through a mouthful of chocolate.
The next day, Harry woke to the smell of frying eggs and bacon. He got up quickly and washed his hands before sitting at the small table. A plate of food was placed in front of him. A full English Breakfast. It was slightly burnt in places, but Sherlock was still only just getting the hang of cooking, so Harry ate it without complaint.
"Do you even get walks?" Harry asked, looking at it sadly. Unsurprisingly, the sleeping dog didn't reply. "You should be in the forest, eating unicorns or something." He sighed and sat up against the wall, turning his wand over. The national anthem was starting to get on his nerves.
Platform Nine and Three Quarters was filled with students in regular clothing and adults wearing multicoloured robes that swept along the brick floor. There were tears in eyes, some of sadness, some of joy. Students were hugging their parents goodbye and greeting their friends. The most amazing thing of all was the scarlet steam engine with Hogwarts Express emblazoned on the side.
"Hello, Professor McGonagall," said Harry. The woman looked shocked, but quickly regained her serious demeanour.
Harry had changed a lot in the past month. While he was still quite skinny, he was no longer emaciated. Almost everything brought a smile to his face. It had taken a long time for him to get used to three meals a day and not having to cook or clean the whole house just to get it. He had also begun to try and figure out where his scar had come from. It was an odd shape and didn't seem to be from any regular cut. He still liked it though. Though his fringe often covered it, he would gladly show it to every person he met.
"I think I'm gonna head back to the common rooms." Harry stood up, one hand still pressed to his forehead and started walking out of the room. He was stopped by none other than Dumbledore.
"You really should get up, Holmes," someone said. Harry groaned, but sat up, rubbing his eyes. He grabbed his glasses and put them on, allowing the dormitory to come into focus. Harry saw Draco standing over his bed, already dressed.
Sherlock was holding John close to his chest, whispering words of comfort and stroking his hair, occasionally sending glares at Hagrid.
“Sorry about the mess,” he said, stepping around a vase that had been shattered sometime during the day. The client muttered something under her breath.
"Do you guys know who Nicolas Flamel is?" he asked his friends. They shook their heads. Harry was sure he had heard the name before, but he couldn't remember where. He racked his brains, but came up with nothing.
“Eventually, the spells ended, and Sherlock and I went into the room. Both aurors were knocked out on the floor. The murderer smiled before turning on his heel. Sensing what he was about to do, Sherlock jumped forwards and grabbed onto his arm, disappearing with the wizard.
“What plan?” he asked. Dumbledore refused to reply. “WHAT FUCKING PLAN?!” Harry said the spell again, sending Dumbledore to the ground, writhing in agony, but still said nothing. Harry kicked him in the ribs, his leather school shoes breaking the old man’s rib with a loud crack. “WHAT FUCKING PLAN GIVES YOU THE RIGHT TO TAKE AWAY MY FAMILY!?” Harry kicked him again, rage filling his every nerve as he looked down on the headmaster.
“How the hell am I supposed to find a Death Eater if he can teleport?” asked Sherlock angrily. “And who the hell is the Boy Who Lived?”
The day dawned and nothing unusual happened. Harry woke at a usual time and walked into the kitchen to see Sherlock making waffles and John arranging gifts on the table.
"Well, he's not joking." Many of the other kids started muttering. There was a bit of an uproar from a few prefects, but they were silenced quickly.
He’d asked Hermione about it, and she’d said it was probably from a movie or something. Harry had agreed, at the time, but he’d never really watched movies. The Dursleys hadn’t let him. Though something about the Dursleys felt off too.
“Fawn V!” groaned Dumbledore, his voice filled with pain and shaking in fear. Fawn like the one from my dream? thought Harry. He stood up and paced around the office, the professor still lying in pain.
much of the night reading and practising occulemency. While he was unsure how effective he would be, when morning rolled around, he had all but mastered putting up walls around his mind. Having spent his whole life learning how to organise his thoughts and keep track of just about every single one, simply blocking them out was pretty easy. He had complete control over his mind, something unbelievably useful when it came to occulemency.
The professor pulled out a roll of parchment and began taking the register. When Harry's name was called, there was a moment of hesitation before the professor moved onto the next person. Harry was slightly thankful that he hadn't said Potter. It seemed that his old name would give him nothing but trouble.
“Are your headaches getting worse?” asked Hermione a few minutes later as she left the great hall. Harry looked up at her, bloodshot eyes and sunken features. “And the nightmares?” She looked at him, pity clear on her face.
"We have the legal documents that disagree, Hagrid. And why would Harry's 'real' parents leave him with such awful people?" asked Sherlock. John took a slightly less logical approach and punched Hagrid in the gut with all his strength. It barely fazed the giant man, but John's kick between his legs certainly did.
sorry it’s been so long. exams on top of more pressing work, and my own personal things took up far more time than i would’ve liked. I’m far from out of it though. I’ve got a couple more weeks of very little free time, and then, if i’m not burnt out entirely by that point, we’ll see how it goes
Another thing that concerned the three of them was Albus Dumbledore. The old man had a few too many secrets and an uncanny knowledge of Harry's life. Just about every week, Harry would be called into the Headmaster's office. Each time, they barely spoke, but Harry always left with a splitting headache.
When the sun began to set, Harry was explaining the finer details on how the suspicious circumstances surrounding the death of a woman in London had been brought to light. Fred and George had wanted to know everything about every single case. Though they already followed most of them through muggle newspapers, it was different to hear such detailed first-hand recounts of cases.
"But the whole point of magic is that it's outside of what we consider possible. It doesn't have to obey the scientific laws of the universe because it's not scientific," Harry said. He had always wanted magic to be real, because who hadn't, and had spent a considerable amount of time thinking about ways it could exist.
Just as Draco was about to reply, there was a clattering outside the compartment. Harry opened the door and saw a dimpled old woman pushing a trolley laden with sweets and treats, all of which Harry had never seen before. There were chocolate frogs, liquorice wands, sugar quills, pumpkin pasties, odd-looking jelly beans and more.
However, if you did have a trained eye - as was the case of Sherlock Holmes - you would notice things that would seem insignificant to anyone else. Like the constant wary looks, the fact that they spoiled their child so much he screamed if he wasn't holding something brand new, as if to tell the child before them that he was the greatest and the only one that mattered, something that an only child would have no reason not to believe.
Eventually, the cart slowed to a stop and everyone got out quickly. They were standing in front of a large door. Griphook took the key out of his pocket and opened the door. It opened to reveal a massive room filled with thousands upon thousands of golden, silver, and bronze coins.
"Right, I am making a new rule, one shot of coffee a day. No matter what. Okay, Harry?" John sounded sterner than usual. He was on edge because of the letters, thought Harry.
Lestrade tore Harry from his thoughts by telling him that the court was being organised, with a lot of help from Mycroft. They had decided on a magic/muggle mix that, if all went to plan, would sentence Dumbledore to a max-security, magic proof prison for a good while. Even though Azkaban was the wizard prison., they’re practices were inhumane and Harry wouldn’t be able to live with himself if he was the reason someone had to go through that.
John had promised to take him to a petting zoo in the new year and Sherlock was plotting revenge for next year’s gift exchange. So far the best ideas had included a surprise striptease sent to the Diogenes club at tea time and a botox gift-card. Sherlock assured John that the botox suggestion would make Mycroft so paranoid about his looks that a long internal debate filled with doubts about bluffs and double bluffs would surely end with Mycroft actually redeeming the card, thus providing Sherlock with ammunition for years to come.
“Ah, my conductor of light.” Sherlock didn’t lift his face from John’s neck, but John could hear the smile in his voice.
John had been trying to think, at the pub, but found himself unable to focus in the noise and the crowd. There was something niggling him about the situation that he couldn't quite get his head around. He felt like it was just out of reach - almost there - if only he managed to stop being this emotional about the whole thing.
"Honestly," John insists. "This considerate version of you is giving me the willies. I’m back now, we can go back to normal."
Sherlock isn't stupid. He has, after all, gone through a lot of emotional growth over a short period of time.
Not at Sherlock, though. Sherlock has been trying his very best at being inoffensive and even sometimes succeeding (he's Sherlock, after all - he wouldn't feel like the same person if he suddenly turned into the perfect housemate. But he's trying).
As if he was going over all the things the two of them had done over the years. All the things that had happened without the law ever catching up on them. Property destruction, burglaries, forgeries… And worse.
Sherlock slammed a glass into the water-filled sink with unnecessary force, making suds fly everywhere.
Sherlock didn’t move for a bit. Then he stood, turning his face away, and said, “Yes. Why would you?” in a flat voice – and then he left.
“Let me make this perfectly clear,” John growled. “We made a deal. About you either complying and getting a reward, or getting punished for not playing along. Now, you can back down anytime you like. You can tell me that we aren’t playing right now. You can sit down at the goddamn table with me and pretend to eat a cookie. But if you outright refuse, there will be consequences.”
And Ella made notes and asked questions and made silly, stupid assumptions about John and Sherlock that people had been making about them for years and…and then she suggested looking at gay porn.
It's much too tempting to touch everywhere - John doesn't want to stop, he can't even focus properly on the way Sherlock is fluttering kisses everywhere, biting an earlobe, removing John’s shirt, feeling everything, cataloguing John with nimble fingers.
John snorted. He could think of a few behaviours Sherlock would surely avoid if John’s annoyance was such a thorn in his side.
"He will be if you do this right," she says. "And I want you to do this right, Sherlock. You're my boys," and she gives him an oddly wobbly smile, like she's about to cry. "Or at least you were. For a time."
“A Secret Santa. Where everyone brings a gift and then we draw lots when everyone’s here. It’s fun.”
"Yes, well, I'm sure he'll do excellently in finding some, after you leave. He did before he met you."
John is heroically not explaining to Sherlock just what he thinks of him and this stupid plan and this stupid not-mafia-gang of his, but only because he feels his life might hang in the balance. He is, however, putting together some choice phrases to use in his rant when (if) they get out of here.
After dinner they move back to the sofa with their glasses. Usually, at this point, either one of them would reach for the remote controller, but neither does.
Sherlock might avoid John’s gaze these days, but when he does need to meet it he can do so with his head held high.
He couldn’t help, though, thinking that there was certain reason to assume that he wouldn’t need the chocolates. That he might need to be planning not only for rewards, but also for the… Consequences.
Once her movements have made him sure Morocco is the intended destination, he books the flights, helps John pack up Rosie and they’re off.
“Sherlock, I am going to set some aims for this Christmas, okay? There are some basic things I'd like to achieve, and I'd prefer it if you helped me achieve them.”
And so John does. Sherlock doesn't disappoint, his sigh when John's lips touch him is almost broken, his taste is deep and intimate and when John has done enough licking and mouthing and takes him as far down as he can, John feels as if they were made for this, as if he could do this forever.
Could that be the reason Sherlock feared that John might think this mess had happened on purpose? Did he think that John would suspect him of trapping him in a marriage (
Nothing they hadn’t done before, but as soon as Sherlock was discharged from the hospital it became clear that the invisible force-field of Sherlock’s personal space needed to come down. John needed to support him up the stairs. He needed help getting on his shirt. He sometimes needed support just moving around the flat.
John feels like he's drowning in Sherlock's smell and his closeness and why the hell does this feel more intimate than sharing a bed? They're wearing a lot more clothes than they do in bed, so this shouldn't be awkward. This shouldn't be tense. But damn it, it is.
Certainly he would've been even more furious to find Sherlock there, lounging about (he needs to have this breakdown by himself), but his absence nevertheless irritates him.
The one thing John does know is that he doesn't want to lose Sherlock. All choices must be made with that in mind.
“That’s a bit of an exaggeration. I can name things you don’t know. Manners, for one.” John gave Sherlock a half-smile but he didn’t even seem to hear him.
“In a hurry, are we?" Mycroft sounded distracted and not a bit interested. "Surely a few months don’t make much of a difference at this point.”
John thought he must be a bit tipsy – he couldn’t imagine a sober Sherlock talking about loving someone.
John has, on several occasions, been close to telling him that he's feeling much better now. That he doesn't need quite that much taking care of. But he doesn't know how to phrase that without potentially saying something stupid.
"Good. So you'll know that the only reason you haven't been arrested yet is his idea of a filial..."
But all of this this had been something that John knew on some basic level. Not something he'd thought about consciously or analysed.
It's John's last day at home before returning to work at the clinic. He's spending it by the fire, sending out CVs.
"Ah, you’re a genius, but you do have your blind spots, dear," says the woman who murdered him and winks.
“I didn’t realise you lived in such constant fear of Santa Claus,” Sherlock said with a near invisible smirk. “So what would you like to do during your immunity from imaginary childhood concepts, then?”
Sherlock’s breath was slow and unlaboured. He wasn't unconscious - not properly. Just asleep. And drugged. He had broken a few ribs, his left arm and had a huge gash in his thigh, but his head was remarkably unscathed. (John couldn't help seeing him fly off the roof of St. Barts every time he closed his eyes, but he hadn't done years of therapy for nothing and was able to dismiss the phantom. Until he next closed his eyes, that was).
He puts himself to rights as much he can and uncaps the water. It is cool and welcome and helps him gather his thoughts, a bit.
Reginald, the otter, made a disgusting sound in the corner. One of the herring John had put in there with him had presumably been decapitated.
And the words might've sounded friendly, something between warm and casual, if that hand hadn't been sitting there, at the top of his thigh. Waiting.
"It's fine," John says lightly. "No harm done. They didn't catch us, and you did manage to provide something exciting for my last day as a mental patient. Mission successful, I should think."
In the afternoon he has an appointment with Ella, where he successfully deflects her questions about Sherlock by talking about dead offspring and imprisoned wives. Afterwards he emails Sarah to tell her that Ella has written him a note declaring him to be neither a threat to himself nor anyone else.
So when John came home and Sherlock refused to stand up from his place on the sofa to help him put away the groceries, he didn’t put up a fuss.
John is sure that he sometimes does it without John ever waking up, shifting from nightmare to deep slumber without realising it.
Bloody hell, If Sherlock managed to get himself killed before the dissolution of the marriage John would become a real, honest to god widower.
Sherlock stood in a corner of the room and made deductions - mainly about how long it would be until particular members of the force would vomit.
Christ, they’d be in marriage counselling for communication problems before the month was out. John ran a hand through his hair and valiantly struggled on.
And he feels out of character. His heart is still beating furiously in his chest but he hopes he's exuding calm.
The next morning John had slept long enough not to be hung over, which left him free to focus on the knot of unease in his chest.
The next kiss is greedier. Sherlock wants to feel everything. His fingers tear at John’s shirt, eager to touch the soft skin underneath it, and he licks and nibbles John’s lips, his jaw, his neck.
"Right. Okay. So it should all be sorted quite..." John trailed off and then glared at Mycroft. "Been aware of it for quite some time? What does that mean?"
Luckily, the terrorist they were chasing was lurking among the hotel staff during the ceremony, unable to resist the spectacle of Sherlock Holmes marrying his Dr. Watson. It all worked out rather well.
They're pushing forty and the sofa is a bit shit. Okay for watching telly, but not much good if you want any real kind of sleep. So John briefly considers blowing his fuse and ranting about personal space and so on and so forth, but in the end he decides... not to.
He saw Sherlock's face close off. His featured hardly moved, but still - it was like someone had drawn the curtains. “I was drunk. Obviously you could see that there wasn't much sense in what I...”
The gesture is crude, considering everything that is behind it, even though John’s palm is warm and soft on Sherlock’s thigh. But after everything that has remained unsaid between the two of them it feels decidedly vulgar to finally broach the subject with a hand to the upper thigh, fingers digging into Sherlock’s skin.
He has a pounding headache, after spending the afternoon with his mother, and he can't deal with this right now. She rises as he flops in his chair and heads for the kitchen.
“I’ve told you that this is important to me. And I’d like to have your help in celebrating this holiday, okay?”
"I wasn’t complaining about you being close, I was complaining about the brooding," said Sherlock, who was draped over the sofa, pillows piled under him at strategic places to make the position as compfortable as possible. "I’ll just make the tea.”
"Where are we going?" John breathes as he follows Sherlock out from the warehouse, away from bloodthirsty, SWOT-analysing criminals.
“No,” John squeezes Sherlock’s hand. “No, I mean... Christ.” John fumbles for his hair. “I mean, you deserve better than this. I mean this wasn’t supposed to happen like this. But it was supposed to happen. It
“Mmhm,” Sherlock said against his lips, grinding his hips against John's in a way that made it obvious that the bed would come in handy sooner than later. “But I wasn’t really that fussed about
Sherlock stares at her in horror for a few minutes before he ducks over a fence and into the enclosed pet cemetery, where he has some urgent business to take care of. And possibly a Victorian era dog to exhume, once darkness has fallen, but that’s neither here nor there.
"See, Sherlock? This is why I need to tell you these things. Because you can’t tell the difference from being in a relationship or turning yourself into a housewife. Because you… You’re not good at this, are you?” She smiles at him, almost ruefully. “You can’t just barge in and try to be friends with benefits. He needs more than that. He needs a relationship."
John noticed that Sherlock didn’t mention it as much as he did. Sherlock seemed a bit nervous about it – which John found almost sweet. Certainly both of them avoided mentioning John’s first marriage, so maybe Sherlock was being considerate by avoiding the topic of marriage altogether. Or maybe he was being considerate towards John’s heterosexuality. Sherlock being considerate about anything at all was rather endearing, so John didn’t really mind what it was about.
"Nope," Sherlock says, popping the p. "And really, John, you should try to be a little more ambitious in choosing passwords for your online banking needs than you are with your email."
He's walking through Kensington Gardens, shortly before closing time, when she materialises next to him.
But he's holding on to John's fingers. Knowing... Knowing everything. About John and how he reacted in the wardrobe and how he reacts every morning and he’s still not letting go.
Sherlock tugs on him, dragging him up for a kiss, making their groins slot together and John can't help groaning.
His hand drifted towards his trousers, but Sherlock was quicker. He deftly unfastened them and then that huge, nimble hand that John had so often thought about was easing its way into his underwear. John gasped loudly as Sherlock grabbed him and used the opportunity to shift them around, so that John’s back was flush against Sherlock’s chest.
Certainly she’s not without her faults – fatal shootings, compulsive lies and poisonings spring to mind – but he likes her. And she knows that she will never forgive him for breaking up her little family.
The thing about tea is that it shouldn’t matter who makes it. It’s just hot water poured over some dried leaves and allowed to steep for a set amount of minutes. You shouldn’t be able to mess it up.
“Sherlock?” His voice sounded distant to his own ears and he cleared his throat. “Should we move this to a bedroom?”
"How often can I say this, Mary? I don't need any help. I've lived with him longer than you have. Everything will be fine. John will be fine. The only thing stopping us from being fine is your continued presence in London. Go. Away."
Sherlock gives John a small smile, and that careful smile - more than anything - shows John how much Sherlock has been tiptoeing around him.
But he was here now. He'd just get his information and then retreat. There was no need for Sherlock or anyone to read too much into it.
John has never really thought of his back as an erogenous zone, but Sherlock certainly treats it like one. He licks up and down the column of his back, he examines the scar on his shoulder with eyes, lips and fingers, he rains kisses all over John's skin in a way that make him arch his back, thrusting his arse in the air in what must seem like a shameless invitation.
John wasn’t sure what Sherlock was after. Telling him he’d be getting a lump of coal in his stocking seemed redundant. Sherlock was the main coal distributor of the house, after all.
John is a bit dismayed that all he needs to move house is a black cab. People his age should require moving vans. But he doesn't. Never has, really. So half an hour later he locks the door of his and Mary's house behind them.
He probably just did his thing in the shower, not thinking about anything in particular. His body was, after all, just transport.
This must be written on his face, because all of a sudden they are both giggling like they used to. Years ago – when things were uncomplicated. And now – now
"Quite," said Mycroft with one of those half-smiles that suggested that there was more to the joke than anyone other than him understood. John hated that smile.
John and Sherlock had touched thousands of times. They’d probably had millions of casual touches between them. Hand on the shoulder, bumping into each other in the kitchen, tackling each other to the ground during chases. And John had never given any of them second thought.
That part doesn't FEEL like shit. It feels like the only thing that keeps him going through the day. But - shockingly - upon this closer examination it is turning out to be shit just like the rest of it.
Sherlock stilled under his touch. John wasn’t sure, but he imagined that he could feel him holding his breath.
John raised his eyebrows, waiting for more, but it didn’t come. Clearly Sherlock was going for baby-steps in this. Right. He stalked off into the kitchen.
"Sherlock, if he knew how... How you feel. It would change everything for him. It would turn his world upside down. It would... It would give him hope and joy and excitement and all the things he'll need. If he's supposed to get through this."
Before he could reach it John was on him. His hand gripped Sherlock’s wrist tightly and his voice dropped low.
“Mind you,” John speaks over him, “that by "someone" I mean Mycroft or your parents. Possibly Mrs. Hudson.”
It is lovely, being held like this, but Sherlock is acutely aware that he still hasn’t touched John below the waist, and he is also aware that there are roughly 14 minutes until the decent will start and the lights will be turned on again.
John blindly reaches over and finds Sherlock's hand. Gives it a friendly squeeze, just to tell him that they're good. It's all good.
This is the first time since they’ve seen each other since they said goodbye at the tarmac. By then, Sherlock had mentally said goodbye to all of this. London. 221B. John. Resolved that he’d never see them again.
But SHOULD a landlord ask the question, John can't very well say that, could he? Not while looking at Sherlock's face.
“What are you doing, John?” Sherlock was still standing close to him, crowding him, towering over him and John didn’t know where to look. He felt dizzy.
He stays in the city centre. Sometimes he doesn't leave the flat all day. But last week, Sherlock offered him to join him on a case, and John accepted.
He stares at the sleeping pills for a while and ends up grabbing the bottle and swallowing two. (He's a bloody doctor - he knows how to responsibly mix sleeping pills and alcohol, damn it.)
He tries not to think about the Watsons' future – not to notice the tell-tale signs of betrayal in the swoop of John's hair, the new cut of his underwear, the bottom lip that’s swollen from guilty biting.
She was supposed to uphold the values represented in The Guardian, to believe in the power of meditation and women’s rights and to march against nuclear weapons. That was the sort of person she was supposed to be. And that sort of people – that sort of people didn’t support pornography in any way, shape or form.
Sherlock doesn’t even think before pulling his hand from underneath the coat and licking it clean, but the moan from John sounds like it’s something unusual. Brilliant, even. Extraordinary.
John kept waiting for the moment when he’d start freaking out – but it didn’t come. He just wanted more of everything. He wanted to see what kinds of noises he could make his best friend make. He wanted to learn
John was cornered against the kitchen counter and found himself backing away from Sherlock as much as he could. It wasn't much.
“So, do you think, you might need – I don’t know – maybe some… Help? To work that out?” Why, oh, why doesn’t he stop talking?
And it is brilliant – but it is also sad. Because now it’s over, this single, shining moment that Sherlock was given. And they need to focus again – on the subject of John’s wife.
Sherlock feels like he’s been running for days, for weeks, ever since his release from custody. But right now, in John and Mary’s boring little flat, everything has ground to an agonising halt.
And then John’s hand lifts from Sherlock’s lap and he turns away. Sherlock can feel the air disappear from his lungs.
John jerked upright in his chair and scrambled for a gun that wasn't there before he realised that Sherlock was slumped on the sofa and was silently watching John.
"I... I think I should go to bed," is all John can say as he downs his glass, still thinking about the tiny white coffin.
“Actually, I’m not even sure if it is a meme,” John said as he peered at the screen. “Does it count as a meme if it’s just a picture with a joke written on it?”
They break apart, carefully, and Sherlock knows that everything he feels for John Watson is written on his face. He is completely vulnerable at this moment – there’ll be no preserving his dignity after this. They won’t go back to pretending. John now holds all the cards.
Sherlock wasn't slipping anywhere. He was fine. He would be fine. He didn't need any particular comfort beyond the undoubtedly healthy buzz the drugs were giving him.
John has started to feel the urge, occasionally, to touch Sherlock. To place a hand on his back to guide him somewhere, or to sit close to him on the sofa, or (for crying out loud) to glide his fingers through his hair.
She stands up lightly and moves towards the window. She's wearing some cross between civilian clothing and her assassin-wear. It's black and tight and probably easy to move around in, but doesn't really stand out.
“Sherlock, I’ll make this right. I… I promise. I’ll sort myself out. And I’ll come back to you. Once everything’s been cleared up. Okay?”
However, living with Sherlock Holmes also meant that John had access to someone who could help him connect the dots when he was out of his depth.
"Ah," says Sherlock. "An excellent reminder. You tried being his suburban housewife, and look how well that turned out." He gives her a hard look. "Why are you so invested in turning me into the same?"
Sherlock is often still awake when John starts thrashing about. He places his had on John's shoulder, shifting closer to him so that they're touching all along each other's sides. And John feels better.
But there was this other thing that Sherlock had been saying in his drunk ravings. That John couldn't quite get to add up.
John stretched out his legs towards the fire, feeling happy and content. And although Sherlock wasn’t smiling, there was a twinkle in his eye that showed that he wasn’t bored either.
“No, perhaps not. Thera are, however, plenty of things that are within bounds for married people that we don’t usually do. Such as this.”
“Anyone what? Anyone I’ve slept with? Anyone I’ve wanted to sleep with? Anyone I’ve…loved?” Sherlock, however, didn’t seem to share John’s qualms.
“Well.” John was regretting this phone call already. He’d actually started regretting as soon as he’d punched in Mycroft’s number, but now he just needed to muddle through. “Well, you deal with…census data and such. Surely we all just want….we want official data to reflect reality.”
Morning wood completely aside. Those are two very different issues and John would never try to further one of those issues under the guise of the other. Because that would be both wrong and unethical.
It was for a case, naturally. And Mycroft would sort it all out afterwards, so that it would be like it never happened. All quite mundane, Sherlock assured him.
Dozens of voices flared up in John's memory, the ghosts of girlfriends past, each telling him that he never seemed to shut up about the great Sherlock Holmes.
His outburst is short, as they usually are. He throws a nearby coffee mug on the floor, yells a few curse words and nurse Olive flees the room. Takes less than 15 seconds all told.
Staying in works better, anyway, John thinks. More casual. More privacy. Not THAT sort of privacy, just enough privacy to discuss things. Classified things. Things he should've talked about to Sherlock weeks ago, but was unable to.
Sherlock really has an excellent way of making John feel like a first class fool. If he’s going to urge Sherlock to seek therapy he probably should be focusing on his global murderous spree, rather than ex-girlfriends.
After a few deep sucks Sherlock shudders and comes down John's throat, in is mouth, over his face and it is absolutely disgusting but also best thing ever.
“I’m sorry, your highness, but I kind of need to be close to you if I’m supposed to be at your beck and call.”
On the other hand, Sherlock had a tendency to be surprisingly sensual, buying loose leaf tea, enjoying the silky feel of a good dressing gown and listening to music while he napped. So he might take long, leisurely wanking sessions that….
kind of absurd that he didn’t even know what sort of porn his best friend, his flat-mate and his husband preferred. He didn’t mean in specifics, just in general, really.
That was probably why he was staring at Sherlock's hand right now. Because he had some Pavlovian response to hospital beds and handholding, John thought to himself.
The man sitting in front of them has completely stopped reading his paper, although his eyes are still glued to the page as he listens to them.
That didn't mean he wanted to rush it, though. He felt hyper aware of his senses. The feel of the slipper in his hand, the slight of the nape of Sherlock's bent head, the all-encompassing smell of cookies in the air.
“John… I can’t. Not like this.” And he tries to put everything he feels into the meagre words, because he cannot –
That sort of people lobbied against pornography, argued about how it was degrading for everyone involved in making it and filled the heads of the consumers with wrong and dangerous ideas about sex.
Like when standing next to Sherlock on a crowded tube. Or just sitting next to him on the sofa. Or when he's in the shower, idly considering having a wank and an image of Sherlock pops into his head. Making the idea of a wank no longer idle.
Honestly, Ella probably had all her suggestions about matters like this from reading Cosmopolitan and gossiping with her friends, rather from her years in higher education. Her professional expertise was with PTSD – it was John’s mistake to think she could assist him in getting rid of the mental block he had about this marriage thing.
“Gingerbread?” he wondered out loud. “Something I can’t pronounce with cranberries and white chocolate and pistachios? Or your garden variety chocolate chip cookies? What do you fancy?”
He let his eyes wander over the bookshelves, half-looking for a suitable book, before his eyes landed on that damned Moroccan slipper. Excellent. He grabbed the slipper and tipped out its contents before turning back to Sherlock, who was still facing the wall, head bowed, like John’s hands were still holding him in place.
"Mary was close to Moriarty for years. But in the end, obviously, she had reason to suspect he wouldn’t be very pleased with her. That he might wish to take out revenge.”
He gets out of bed, reliefs himself, and returns to the wrong side of the bed. There he cuddles under the covers, so very glad not to be alone and whispers: "Thanks, Sherlock." Hoping it says enough.
“Well, you’ve found out that she was… What she was. It can mess you up. Knowing that your ex was something other than you thought she was.”
The suitcases are piled onto the sidewalk (this is the first airing they get since his honeymoon). Sherlock takes some boxes and John takes his suitcase and together they drag his possessions into the flat.
"As I said - this will be complicated. He'll be furious. But not at himself, like he was the last time."
But lurking behind those thoughts are other thoughts. Thoughts that sustained him, in his exile. Thoughts about more. Maybe. A little more. A small, guilty hope. Fantasies – fantasies! – about stupid things. Like John’s hands.
"No, you don't. You just said so. We need to move." Sherlock doesn't look up from his laptop, and really, when did he bring that? Has he moved in, without John noticing? What is his plan in this bizarre arrangement?
Which is frankly absurd. When has Sherlock Holmes concerned himself with being considerate... anything?
Sherlock didn't sleep with Janine, John reminds himself. Almost ANYONE would've slept with Janine, but not Sherlock. Because Sherlock doesn't work like that. He's not good with this stuff. Not when it's not means to an end.
"Girls," John gritted out, deciding to stick with this somewhat bizarre line of questioning. "What should I tell them?"
“Yes, well, as we know marriage doesn’t have to mean very much, does it,” John asked with a tight smile.
After a prolonged silence he gives up on his idea of a heart to heart. He grabs for a topic from the newspapers at random.
“You can touch,” Sherlock rumbled into John’s ear, “anything you like,” and John could hear himself make an embarrassing half grunt, half moan, as he allowed his hands finally to travel lower, down to Sherlock's arse. Sherlock moaned and whispered into John's ear: “What can I touch?”
And he is grateful to Mary for finally making her destination of Morocco known. Because leaving 221B finally broke the spell.
For a moment they were silent together. Not like when they were reading or watching TV or doing housework - not silently co-existing, but silently watching each other.
It doesn't bear thinking about. He'll need some hint from Sherlock of what's expected. About what's allowed.
Also - he really, really wants to, he thinks as he tugs Sherlock’s underwear down. He wants to know what Sherlock sounds like as John swallows him down, he wants to taste him, he wants to get to know every part of him.
He noticed that the CD that had been rattling around in their stereo had gone quiet. There was no sound in their living room, except for the cackling in the fire. The lights on the Christmas tree were the only electrical lighting in the room, twinkling happily, not knowing that their season was quickly coming to an end. Tomorrow they’d return to their dusty box.
Sherlock makes tea while John carries his things upstairs. Within minutes they are both settled in their old chairs.
But he's gone through it. The emotional growth, that is. It's been painful and constricting and Mycroft's obvious distain and amusement about the whole thing has been utterly insufferable, but the thing wasn't to be avoided.
He didn’t even know if Sherlock looked at porn. Theirs had never been that kind of friendship, no naughty jokes or laddish comments. And if Sherlock looked at porn John didn’t know what sort of porn it was.
That sort of people was not supposed to suggest rubbing one out over a couple of naked chaps going at it in front of a camera!
John wasn't sure when he'd started yelling. He wasn't even sure when he'd stood up from his chair. And he wasn't sure when Sherlock had gone pale.
And he could feel, every second, that Sherlock was a man, and somehow it didn’t matter. His stubble, his lean, hard body, his towering height – it absolutely didn’t hurt. This was the best kiss John had ever tried, not despite it being with a man but because it was with Sherlock.
What on earth is her agenda here? Even now, when the battle has (just about) been lost and won, Sherlock still can't quite wrap his head around Mary Morstan. He knows the facts. He knows some of her background, her contract with Moriarty, her plan in marrying John. But he doesn't quite know what makes her tick. Not fully.
John did some quick calculations and it dawned on him out that since the two of them had met, they had actually spent much more time apart than they ever had together. He’d never thought of it quite like that. Sherlock was such an all-compassing presence in his life. It was a strangely sobering thought.
When it was time to shape the cookies and Sherlock decided that this was prime time for a long, hot bath John didn’t say a word.
It isn’t until he’s almost to the surface that he realises that this time he didn’t bother correcting her assumptions about him, John and a relationship.
“I’ve never had one,” John continued, “and I’d like one. Preferably one that matches one that you are wearing. At the party.”
Sherlock tries not to deduce things about John’s love life – it’s better if he doesn’t – but even Anderson must have realised that John has sensitive nipples. Sherlock's explorations of John's sides and back must, eventually, lead him there.
"As if,” John snorted. “You'd probably have designed a computer virus to destroy all digital evidence of the hat if you hadn't known that you could."
"Mhm." Mycroft was the only person who knew about their short introduction to matrimony and John found it in a bit of a poor taste to discuss the thing with his erstwhile brother-in-law -- not in the least because Mycroft always looked like he had a bad taste in his mouth when he mentioned it.
Thankfully, this detachment spares him the roar of pain and anger. He doesn't blame himself. Not really. Not enough to break through the apathy.
Secondly - well, he spends his nights with Sherlock. Planning to spend a night with someone else - nameless and faceless as that person might be - feels... Odd.
Because that was just the sort of thing you did, working with Sherlock Holmes. You did all sorts of stupid things – although John reserved the right to roll his eyes at them as much as he deemed appropriate.
His voice sounded hoarse and distant. He could feel Sherlock nodding against his skin and yet they didn’t move. John’s hands kept trailing up and down Sherlock’s back, wandering up into his hair and then hesitating over the waistband of his trousers before moving back up.
"I rather think," Sherlock muttered, "that you're overestimating your place in society if you're worried about your Times obituary, John.”
"No longer a concern," says Sherlock and John can see the shadows of Russia, Serbia, India and Santa Barbara (Santa Barbara?) in his face as he says it. And suddenly he aches from the loss of innocence in his friend.
"You know I care about him, Sherlock." She stuffs her hands into the pocket of her hooded sweatshirt. "And, although I doubt you'll believe it, I care about you."
"To be fair the siblings of arch enemies are often exemplary human beings," Sherlock says with a twinkle in his eye. It takes John a second to realise that he's referring to Mycroft.
His baby is dead. A daughter. Killed mere hours after Moriarty appeared on the nation's television screens. By her mother's hand.
These past few days had been different still. Like a window into a future that could’ve been but never was. A future where John didn’t get married, a future that was still theirs and still filled with possibility.
John has stopped taking the sleeping pills, useless as they were. He sometimes gets nightmares, but they're not as bad when he's not alone.
"Unresolved ones. And he'll have those now too. Because he loved me, Sherlock." She stares at him, as if to dare him to object.
He takes ten times longer calming himself, gearing up to apologise. Schooling his features into something appropriate for the eyes of patients. Even wipes up the coffee and throws the broken mug into the trash.
He was, he felt, getting rather good at tolerating Sherlock. Even Mycroft. After all these years he'd stopped blowing his fuse at the smallest annoyance.
“I… I don’t think you’re the only one who wouldn’t have had patience for long directions,” Sherlock panted above him.
John stared at him for a moment, trying to judge if he was being serious. Then he slowly rose from his chair.
John was sat in his chair, thinking about this, feeling inadequate for not being able to do something millions of people all around the world were probably doing right this minute. Granted – most of them were probably making horrible tea – but still. They were still making it. And not feeling inferior and miserable for not being able to do it properly.
John doesn't ask why he's there, rather than at Baker Street. He doesn't ask what happened with Moriarty. He doesn't ask after the health of his former wife. He doesn't ask anything. He just sits on his sofa, eats Sherlock's food and goes to bed. His and Mary's bed. His marital bed, even.
Hopefully this is enough. Enough not to make John feel abandoned. Enough to make him smile in the middle of the night.
Because this was it. He was absolutely sure that this was the moment. The moment they’d both been… not waiting for, exactly, but anticipating. He’d felt its presence thrumming beneath his skin every day for ages. It had been just out of reach. Lurking at the edges of every smile, of every accidental touch, of every kindness shown. It had been there in the bow on the Christmas present John had found at the edge of his bed a couple of days ago. It had been there every time Sherlock’s craving for Chinese gave way for John’s craving for Indian. It had been there in their toothbrushes, standing side by side in the mug in the bathroom.
“Yeah, okay, don’t be mean.” John reached for his mug of some cinnamon scented holiday blend that Sherlock refused to acknowledge as proper tea. John liked it, though. Not everyone had a metabolism that could handle two cinnamon lattes per day like some lanky gits apparently did.
He is trembling and not even sure why. Fury, yes, certainly. Humiliation, partly. But there is also a jumble of other stuff and he would very much like to go back to his non-feeling state of the last few weeks. He can't deal with a meltdown now. Especially not a meltdown that everyone seems to have been expecting, god damn it.
And he certainly tended to be a bit possessive. Unreasonable, some might say (and had said) about his claims on John’s time and attention.
“He’s supposed to know things! He’s supposed to…” Sherlock gestured wildly. “What sort of a brother… Ugh…”
John was unsure where to look – at Sherlock’s face or at the white strands that were coating his hand, it was equally mesmerising. Sherlock's knees gave out and he slid down the wall to the floor, next to John. The more part of John's mind that was prone to fussing suggested that this had probably been a bit much for someone in Sherlock's current medical state - but his very pleased primal brain pointed out that it was very unlikely that any lasting damage had been done and surely this had been worth a little discomfort. He wrapped his arms around Sherlock and leaned in for a long, lazy kiss.
John cleared his throat. “I think ten is a good, round number to be getting on with.” He could feel that his breath was getting shorter and he clenched his free hand a few times before taking a stance on the right side of Sherlock.
"Well, it wasn't my mission. It was yours," said Mycroft and John's feeling of unease kept growing. "It wasn't my job to deal with the details. It was yours. And this was your solution."
John picks up a few things in the kitchen and moves around the living room while Sherlock plays. He takes a shower (because a day spent on the move in London can make you seriously icky, even without any close calls with criminal gangs).  Still, Sherlock doesn’t speak.
I'm not quite back, but I had a small amount of free time and was able to write this. I don't know when I'll get the chance to post again, but until then, enjoy this. And thank you for waiting.
Eventually, he managed to fall into a fitful sleep. When he woke at eight the next morning, he was exhausted. He sat up and rubbed the sleep out of his eyes. After putting on his glasses, he got up and made himself a giant cup of instant coffee. It may have tasted terrible, but four shots did wonders for waking up in the morning. Unfortunately, he drank eight shots instead and got a bad case of the shakes. He sighed and clenched his fists. Sorting out his coffee problem was a task for another day.
She led Harry to the back of the shop where a blond boy with sharp, pale features was being fitted. He had swirling silver eyes that shone in the dim light. He was wearing long black robes that were pinned up in various places. Madam Malkin stood Harry up on a stool next to the boy, then pulled some robes over Harry's head, pinning them in various places. Harry was glad she hadn't told him to take off his hoodie.
Harry quickly paid for the wand and put it in his bag, wanting to get out of the shop as soon as possible. Sherlock saw his discomfort and followed promptly.
Anyway, I got past the bit that I didn't want to write so the rest of the book should come faster now.
“While Sherlock and I were still in the hallway, dozens of spells were fired, causing the entire house to light up. We waited patiently, both knowing that entering the room armed with only guns was a death sentence.
The foyer was rather sparsely decorated, nothing more than a few paintings and a coat stand. The rest of the house was quite similar. Mycroft was hardly one for sentimentality. The man himself was not there to greet him. In fact, Harry didn't see him until after they'd all been led to their rooms and dinner had been announced.
"SLYTHERIN!" This was yelled out loud. Harry smiled and took off the hat, walking over to the Slytherin table and sitting down beside Draco. He now had a much clearer view of the head table and all the teachers sat there.
“I think it’s best you five got to bed,” said John, checking his watch. Everyone nodded and slowly made their way to bed, yawning and dragging their feet.
"At least them you wouldn't fail all your assignments," Draco said before returning to his work. Upon hearing the professor mention and unfamiliar topic, Harry was quick to follow suit.
“What I really want to know is what’s school like?” asked John as he helped carry the numerous trunks up the stairs and drop them in the lounge.
"Well, wizards aren't quite human," said Griphook coldly, glaring at McGonagall, as if expecting an argument. She said nothing and the four of them continued walking through the bank, passing vault after vault until they reached one that clearly hadn't been touched in years. Every single crevice in the iron door was coated in dust. Griphook raised a finger and stroked the centre of the door. It dissolved, revealing a vault that made the Potter's fortune look like spare change.
A few days later was Harry's first Defence Against the Dark Arts class. This was one he had really been looking forward too, one that disappointed him immeasurably. Instead of learning defensive spells and interesting things about dark magic, the lesson was spent talking about small things that taught the class nothing. The teacher himself was a joke.
Harry spent hours looking at all the different fish. Each one had him entranced. He read all the information plaques and asked all the employees dozens of questions. They all answered him, most of them shocked at his intellect. Sherlock had taught him well, he was way smarter than the average three-year-old.
"Goodbye, guys. I'll miss you so much. I love you." Then he let go and pushed his trolley over to the train and started loading his trunk into a car. Drawn out goodbyes led to tears, Harry told himself as he struggled to lift the trunk. He looked behind him and saw John leaning on Sherlock, a few tears rolling down his face. Sherlock was doing his best to comfort his husband, but Harry could tell he was fighting off tears of his own.
“Woah,” said Fred as he looked around. The walls were covered in case files, newspaper clippings, and pictures of both victims and criminals. Hedwig was sitting on the windowsill, a dead frog in her beak. Upon seeing the six visitors, she dropped the frog and flew to sit on top of Harry’s cupboard.
Around halfway through the day, after Harry had finished reading most of the books, there was a loud rumbling and the apartment shook slightly. Bloody lorries, he thought to himself, then he returned to his book. The rumbling didn't stop. Harry got up and walked to the lounge to see what was making the noise. After checking the window, he saw that it was not made by lorries. He walked around the room. The noise seemed to be coming from the fireplace. Suddenly, hundreds of letters flew into the room from the chimney, covering the floor and floating through the room. Harry looked out the window again and saw dozens of owls fly past.
