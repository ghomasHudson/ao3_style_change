"I promise. I only downloaded a small application that you might be interested in. But maybe not." Sherlock shrugs, gets to his feet and heads towards his bedroom. "I'll have a lie-down for a while..."
The words echoed in Sherlock's head, making him roll his eyes and huff with exasperation. He was right, of course he was. He'd never seen an alpha put on such a pitiable act before. But why should he have expected anything different?
"I couldn't. I couldn't do that to Sherlock. I couldn't tell him that his own brother had killed his dog. It would have driven a wedge between them back then. How could I have borne that responsibility? We were just children, adolescents," Mycroft said, running his long fingers through his thinning hair. He still seemed to be deeply shaken by the affair: John had never seen the civil servant so emotional.
Sherlock turned away peevishly and folded his arms across his chest. He couldn't explain why he was so easily upset by the topic; especially as he knew there were a lot of good things happening right now. He felt Mike's eyes on him but didn't know how to bring up heats of all things following his outburst without appearing foolish. He exhaled loudly and directed his attention to the large posters on the wall, examining a drawing of male omega anatomy.
John nodded his acknowledgment to Mycroft, letting him know that he appreciated the effort, before returning his attention to the three teacups.
"How about some tea?" John said from the living room. He looked back over his shoulder at Sherlock from where he sat in the red upholstered armchair with the Sunday paper held open in his hands. A warm smile flickered at the corners of his mouth. He couldn't have been up for long, as he was still wearing his pyjama bottoms and the t-shirt he usually slept in. His short hair was uncombed, and stuck out stubbornly on one side.
"It's almost like I'm fucking both of you at once, don't you think?" Ryan moaned and pushed against the back of Victor's neck with both hands, forcing his head down into the crook of Sherlock's neck without interrupting his movements.
" Sherlock moaned as John angled Sherlock's right leg and slid his shoulder underneath Sherlock's knee so that the leg rested on his shoulder.
"I apologise, it wasn't my intention," Sherlock said, clasping his hands behind his back. He couldn't help but notice that Bill didn't make any attempt to placate Henry or tell him that Sherlock wasn't going to hurt him. She simply offered him protection and a safe distance. Sherlock clearly picked up the note of rebuff in her scent, and Henry must have as well, presumably sending him even more mixed signals.
"Did you speak to Moran?" John asked from where he stood in the opening between the living room and the kitchen. There was something ominous in his voice.
The whole thing still unsettled him. He was uncomfortable with the thought of sharing a bed with his best friend's omega, even going so far as to conceive a child with her. Good Lord, he would be a father! Even if he had nothing to do with the child, as all of the rights and responsibilities would lie with Bill as the bonded partner. Nonetheless, he would have procreated – which had never been something he'd planned on.
Visits from his family members were few and far between. Mycroft didn't show up until one day three months after he was admitted. He came over to join Sherlock in the garden. They gave each other the silent treatment for a while, until Sherlock couldn't stand the oppressive silence any longer and asked after Anthea and Archie.
Cilia refrained from asking about the drugs, withdrawal, or the state of his addiction today. John had probably already told her some of it, or perhaps she simply didn't want to invade too far into his privacy and discover all of his dark sides.
Victor had turned around to inspect the bookshelves again, skimming the titles of the books, pulling one out here and there and reading the blurbs on the back covers. Thus distracted, he didn't notice the cardboard box filled with papers that stood between John's armchair and the fireplace. He tripped over it, knocking it over. The cardboard flaps opened, spilling a large number of loose papers, notebooks, and letters onto the floor.
Sherlock had found out quickly who Tom was. An athletic youth with strawberry blond hair and loads of freckles, he was quite a bit shorter than Sherlock, but his shoulders were at least twice as broad. He obviously spent more time hitting the gym than the books. The reason might be his latent insecurity, which he tried to conceal – unsuccessfully. At least according to Sherlock. He couldn't help noticing the way the other young man constantly chewed his nails, nor his excessive nervousness when apparently stronger men passed by him. Sherlock assumed Tom had had some bad experiences with bullying at school. Which presumably had to do with his ginger hair – even though Sherlock couldn't understand rejecting someone based on a certain hair colour. Or else it was because he was gay.
John chokes a little and coughs into his fist. Ginger is burning in his throat. "Thanks," he manages to say and reaches for his glass.
Sherlock's eyes darted to the heart monitor. The distance between each peak of the green line had already increased. Their time was running out. The faster he ended this insanity, the faster he would be able to free John from Moriarty's clutches and get him treated. Every second counted.
"Why?" Sherlock asked pointedly and sat up, forcing John to relinquish his comfy position. Instead, he found himself in the crosshairs of his omega's laser-sharp gaze.
Greg grinned quietly to himself as he watched the verbal exchange between the two men. It was good to see John laughing again after such a long time.
Mike gave him a few extended seconds to collect himself before speaking again. "How are you doing, Sherlock? Can I do something for you?"
The springs of the mattress creak under John as he repeatedly turns from one side to the other. When his bladder turns against him and he feels the need to pee, he folds back the duvet, grumbling, and swings both legs out of the bed. He goes downstairs in the dark and switches the light on in the bathroom. After he’s used the toilet and washed his hands, he drinks a glass of water in the kitchen. He refills the glass and takes it upstairs.
It would be unthinkable for Sherlock to throw himself at John just now – or at any other time, for that matter. Never again, and not just because his body wanted him to. Jealousy and territorial behaviour were two things that Sherlock didn't appreciate in others, and he wasn't about to make an exception for himself. And so before John got the wrong idea entirely regarding his intentions, Sherlock turned on his heel and went into the kitchen – although not without directing a few choice words at the alpha as he passed.
"But you're obviously feeling overly warm, even though it's quite cool inside the flat. You're constantly eating, and yet you're still hungry all the time. And you've been tidying. It's never been as clean in here as it is right now. You also went into nesting mode last time, even if it wasn't as extreme."
It was freely given, deliberate and reciprocal. A bridge between the here and now and a future they both wanted to embark on together.
Several people were standing in the background of the photos, watching the spectacle, but no one intervened. The attacker wasn't visible. Just the fist gripping the man's collar, along with the cuffs of a dark blue shirt.
Sherlock snorted without humour. Cilia's words sounded as if being a beta were a fatal condition, or at least a serious handicap – which was one way of looking at it, compared to the many abilities which alphas and omegas possessed. It was quite likely that many people felt that way. On the other hand, it was just as easy to say that betas were free of both the backwards rules of alpha-omega society and their complicated biology. They might be lesser in some respects, but they certainly weren't worse!
Breathing heavily, John looked down at Sherlock and pulled him up into his arms, sealing their mouths in a nearly brutal kiss. When he let Sherlock go again, the latter's lips felt swollen and raw. An exhilarating sensation, even if he would rather feel it somewhere else on his body.
The monitor informed him that the next train was delayed due to a technical defect. The more people who gathered around him, the more restless John became. His eyes darted over the crowd of figures, vigilantly studying their expressions. A strong sense of panic began to stir in his gut, and his stomach twisted into knots. Feeling anxious, John closed his eyes and took a deep breath. In through the nose, out through the mouth. He simply wasn't used to so many people anymore.
John smirked and let Sherlock pull him to his feet. He stretched and yawned, then grabbed his toilet bag and headed for the door to go to the bathroom.
"Oh bloody hell, sorry about that," Victor apologised and put the book in his hand back on the shelf.
"Tea?" Sherlock asks hopefully and plops down heavily into the chair opposite John. He inspects what's on offer on the table with hooded eyelids. John has already had breakfast hours ago and just finished lunch, but he hadn't cleared Sherlock's place yet. Feeling helpful, he gets up, pours tea into Sherlock's cup, and adds milk and sugar. Then he puts two slices of white bread in the toaster and fetches the jam out of the fridge.
He leaned over the omega, who presented a picture of innocence with her large eyes and rosy cheeks as she lay on top of the lacy white coverlet in her nightdress of the same colour. Something about the realisation that he would be the first man to penetrate her, who would take that innocence from her and plant his seed within her, awakened a primitive, primal instinct in John and initiated an urgent throbbing in his loins. Even though Cilia was bonded to another alpha and not technically a virgin – such an antiquated view being disingenuous in any case – John still found the notion highly arousing. He was pleased to see his cock begin to harden.
Ryan turned away, ashen, and went over to the couch, where he stripped away the condom and picked up his clothes to get dressed. "No one's ever been fired for an affair. Your threat is completely unsubstantiated."
John was panting and dazed. His heart and pulse were hammering against his ribs with no discernible rhythm. It was as if every one of his thoughts had been extinguished, leaving nothing but
Sherlock replayed the words a couple of times in his head. Betas functioned very differently from alphas and omegas, and yet it seemed they had a lot in common.
Their lips met again and again, each kiss an affirmation for the step they were undertaking. In between, they whispered each other's names into the rare bits of empty space between them, holding fast to one another in order not to lose their precarious balance.
"Kiss me," Victor demanded, then let out a satisfied sigh when Sherlock tilted forward and pressed his lips to Victor's, the tip of his nose cold against Victor's cheek. Sherlock's fingers were frightfully cold as well. Victor felt for them blindly, then pulled them in underneath his leather jacket, right where there was enough heat. Sherlock went along with it all easily enough, but his kisses became sloppier, as if he couldn't focus on all of the input at once that was flooding in.
"Oh, for God's sake!" Sherlock muttered under his breath before he punched John causing him to shout in pain. John quickly countered causing Sherlock's face to explode in pain.
Mycroft watched unsurprised as Lestrade lost consciousness. The ring had been the only thing keeping him going and when he took it off he had lost his battle. Mycroft knew that the priest needed his relic, but he dreaded what would happen when he removed it from John's neck. "I'll do it." Sherlock said and approached John before Mycroft could protest. Sherlock pulled the relic from John's neck and placed it around Lestrade's. The relic glowed softly and the light infused into the priest's body, but he still did not wake. The same could not be said for John, however. John groaned and began to stir. Mycroft once again tightened his grip in his wand preparing to strike. His brother may never forgive him, but he couldn't take the chance. John Watson was too dangerous. Lestrade had confirmed what he had suspected. John's eyes shifted to a golden hue and blinked at him almost in askance before closing as John's aura pulsed with power. Warded symbols appeared etching themselves across his bare torso. Mycroft stiffened at the sight. He had never seen such a thing. He was unsure of their origin; whether they were light or dark, but one thing was certain; they were powerful. He would need all of his strength for this.
She frowned and replied hotly. "Whatever you're implying…" Before she could spout off some pathetic excuse, Sherlock cut her off and continued.
"Oh please! That wasn't even a two. I need another! Something challenging until we get the results of the autopsies for the priests. When's the next one?" Sherlock insisted as he continued to pace restlessly.
Molly Hooper hummed softly as she moved about the morgue at Bart's. She had just finished her final autopsy and sat down at the microscope to look at her histology slides from all of the biopsies done that day. She closed her eyes and could sense death around her. Unlike most, death did not disturb her. It was simply an unavoidable consequence of life. Everything had a beginning and an end. Unconventional attitude, but then almost everything about her was unconventional. Molly always had been considered odd and was shunned by most of her brethren. It didn't bother her. She refused to use her powers for evil and instead used them to help fight it. That was how she had met Sherlock Holmes and Gregory Lestrade. She remembered that day clearly, it would be one that she would never forget.
Greg had always felt different even as a young child. He would talk to children that no one else could see. He hadn't known what they were at first, but he soon learned. Spirits. His parents had shrugged it off as an over active imagination and Greg quickly learned to keep his conversations private. He had no desire to be admitted to the psych ward. As he grew older, he learned control and how to shield. After he was ordained, his power and knowledge grew even stronger. His natural psychic abilities gave him a major advantage in his order and in the beginning he often called upon lost spirits for aid, those that had not fallen prey to the darkness, and in return he would free them from limbo. Greg rarely dropped his shields now. After that night when Sherlock had nearly been killed, Greg had decided that the risks were just too great. Once you opened a door to the afterlife, all kinds of things could slip through.
"Surely, you're joking." Sherlock retorted sharply. "People laughed at your father too with all of his theories about Baskerville." Sherlock then spat out a flurry of deductions. "Baskerville. Interesting. We'll take the case."
"Hardly. What did they say? Greg, in particular." Molly needled. Sherlock chuckled causing her to frown. She failed to see the levity in this situation. But then, Sherlock always had possessed a rather macabre sense of humor.
"I would be willing to pay you a considerable sum of money for information, nothing indiscreet. Just tell me what he's up to. I worry about him constantly. We have a difficult relationship." Mycroft explained.
"What is it with men and their labels? Not gay? Hardly, bisexual at the very least." Irene insisted. "Denial, Sherlock. He was in denial." Sherlock shook his head and his eyes flooded with pain and regret. Irene cursed herself again. The man had suffered enough and rather than give him solace as she had expected; the revelation only served to increase his pain. "Sherlock…" She trailed off unsure of what to say afraid of unintentionally causing more pain to a man that was hanging on by a thread.
John sighed and debated how much to disclose. He didn't want to alienate his fellow officers and John knew that his rank and age would garner some sideways glances, so he really could blame the man for asking. "I've held a number of occupations as a civilian before reenlisting. I have served with this regiment during my last two tours in Afghanistan." It was now Jones's turn to raise an eyebrow, but he had the good grace to let the subject drop.
The teen broke his silence looking right at John. “I’m not the one you need to worry about. Moriarty and Moran. Those two are bloody dangerous, even on suppressants. They keep bouncing between group homes and junvie.”
"Feel free Greg, but I have a feeling that Sherlock will beat you to it. This will be on his radar. The mere possibility of you being killed will be enough to motivate him." Molly insisted. Greg laughed.
"First, this wreaks of the occult and second Lestrade is too valuable an asset to lose." He explained with a flip of his wrist.
"Lestrade's a strong median. It's why raising the dead disturbs him so. Conjuring can leave deceased soul's stuck in limbo even after the dead are put back to rest." Sherlock explained deducing Molly's thoughts. Molly shook her head in disbelief. She should have seen it. John looked just as shocked at the revelation.
"Somebody loves you." She insisted repeating her claim from earlier but this time she wasn't joking. Her eyes moved purposely from John to Sherlock causing John to shake his head. There wasn't much time. She had to stall.
That should have been the end of it. PTSD and intermittent tremor should have barred him from re-enlisting, but someone had altered the records. Why? She thought as she read on still perplexed and unsure of what significance this man seemed to have in order to justify all this subterfuge. He was currently stationed in Kandahar, under commanding officer James Sholto, and in just a few months time, Watson had led several successful missions leading to his promotion to the rank of Major. Mary studied the battle logs and frowned deeply. While Watson had ensured that his men were sufficiently careful in battle, he himself was not. He had been aggressive, borderline reckless in his pursuit of the enemy. Then she came across the missing puzzle piece that fit the actions together. Suicidal tendencies. The man had a death wish; this was why she was needed. She must protect him from himself, so to speak. Why her employer wanted this man kept alive remained a mystery.
Sherlock smelled good, no doubt. Mainly of shampoo, hair products, and shower gel. Fainter was the fragrance of fabric softener on his fine-knit pullover, underlaid by the aroma of coffee, a trace of peppermint toothpaste, petrichor in his hair, and... John moved in even closer, nearly touching the delicate skin beneath the man's ear with his nose. There. An echo of something delectable. Something that made John's mouth water and his heart rate kick up a notch.
"God, Sherlock... why didn't we – "John cut himself off before he was able to complete the thought, pressing his forehead against Sherlock's nape. But Sherlock could virtually feel the words hovering over them in the air anyway:
John grunted pensively. He didn't quite know what to say about this whole thing. On the one hand, he felt the ugly jab of jealousy in his gut. On the other hand, he was well aware that he of all people didn't have any right to feel that way. After all, John had ended up having sex with Victor less than four weeks ago.
He hurried up the stairs to his room on the second floor and stuffed a few pieces of clothing into his duffle. He couldn't stay here. He'd always had a hot temper and been extremely easy to provoke. But he'd never lost control of himself this quickly before. He'd physically attacked a defenceless man –
Sherlock shrugged again. This time, the layer of soap suds parted, revealing his collarbone and shoulders.
Anthea sobbed between breathy gasps and cries of pain, angrily smearing the tears running down her face. "Mycroft!" she whimpered over and over, while Sherlock cursed his brother for his insensitive, egotistical behaviour. He sat down next to Anthea on the bed, pushed her hair back off her face, and wiped away her tears with a tissue. At the same time, he tried to get his own panic under control and make some practical decisions.
Curious as to what Sherlock was going to say, John pushed himself up far enough to see Sherlock's face, even if he couldn't make out much more than the outline. He pushed a damp curl off his forehead and dropped a kiss on Sherlock's cheek, unable to contain himself.
But John couldn't help noticing Victor's hand on the couch next to him curling into a fist, practically trembling with anger. Maybe it hadn't been such a good idea after all for them to come here. There were obviously still unresolved differences between the two fronts which John hadn't wanted to stir up. He cleared his throat discreetly and tried to draw the attention to himself instead.
John became more and more aghast as he listened to the omega's explanation. Although he didn't like to admit it, what Sherlock was saying made a lot of sense. John was also furious at himself for not having realised the momentousness of the prohibition. He'd always been the one who felt discriminated against, as an unbonded alpha.
“What will I do?” Sherlock asked. If he presented as Alpha, it would be easier in some ways but harder in others. Alphas were able to tolerate long term use of suppressants as long as they cycled off to allow for a rut approximately once a year. But even with suppressants, Alphas became unstable without a bond.
He had been raised in London by French ex-pats. Both of his parents had been devout Catholics. Ironically, Greg had rebelled against the arcane rules and rituals within the church and though he was sent to Catholic school and served as an alter boy, he had lacked true faith as a youth. In order to avoid world war three with his family, Greg had simply gone through the motions from baptism, to communion, to confirmation at the age of 14. Sometimes he wondered how he had made it through the Catholic school system without being expelled. He smiled as he remembered nicking the sacramental wine before the service and having a pleasant buzz throughout the mass. No one had caught on. He never missed a cue. He had cut his catechism classes whenever possible. The Enchiridion had been unbearably dull, but he had always managed to pass his exams with flying colors, even classes that most other students failed, like Latin. That subject had been one of the few that Greg had enjoyed and because he was fluent in French he took to it naturally. The history of it fascinated him; the Roman Empire had been a thing of awe in its prime. It also helped that Greg had been fond of the teacher, Father Giuseppe Tragillio, who would later become his mentor. Unlike most priests, the old Sicilian had a wicked sense of humor laced with dark undertones and sarcasm.
"You're John's sister, Harriet Watson." Greg confirmed. Molly's anger was suddenly replaced by horror.
Bill's expression hardened. "Captain!" He hissed out the word angrily forcing John to look up and finally meet his eyes. He then continued in a much gentler voice. "Don't ever think that no one cares. I know for a fact that every recruit that has worked with you in the last 14 weeks would attest to that, myself included." John felt his throat tighten, and rather than risk his voice wavering, he simply nodded in acknowledgement.
"Forgiveness for what? You've led a moral life: defended the crown, healed the sick, and now you're fighting the darkness." Sherlock looked at him truly puzzled. Before John could answer, his phone rang giving him an out. He quickly answered it much to Sherlock's annoyance. Greg's voice greeted him.
Molly’s voice floats up “You always say such terrible things.” Sherlock’s chest tightens as he recalls his missteps. “You have to control the pain.” Pain; love is painful. It is a lesson that Sherlock learned the hard way.
"Fall in!" John ordered with a shout above the din. He was the troop leader and as soon as he was sure that he was uninjured and that he could move. He drew his weapon and was poised to attack. There was another explosion somewhere off to his left, the air had yet to clear from the first. Gun fire rained down upon him as the sand kicked up again further obstructing his vision causing everything to once again disappear in a haze of sand and dust.
The priest grunted in acknowledgement lowering his palm and allowing the water to fall back into the Thames beside them. He then untied the rosary from around her wrists. He shoved her roughly snapping at her. "Go! Get out of here, before I change my mind." Molly turned and looked at him. He was furious and Molly knew she shouldn't press him but she had to know.
A demon attacked attempting to devour her soul, but before it could strike a bright light appeared. An angel appeared from within the light. Greg knew instinctively that it was John and watched in awe as he struck the demon down saving the young girl. What happened next shook Greg to his very core. The Arch Angel Michael appeared and used John's own sword against him. He struck him down burying his sword into his shoulder. This was how John had fallen from grace? Saving an innocent soul? It seemed so unfair and Greg wanted to ask John the reason, but was powerless to do so.
John’s mouth dropped in shock. Mike smirked. “Welcome to Alpha group home for teens. There’s only three ways out. Drafted at 18, juvie or my your own hand.” Mike explained. John couldn’t hide his horror and disgust.
"I have a good idea where to start, but I'll need your help." She confided. Then it had begun; they had followed a trail of fruitless leads. Even powerful men had little information on the insurgents and where their secrets lie buried. While she had used lust, Sherlock had used deduction, but it seemed as though they were always one step behind and their time was running out. The longer John remained MIA, they more likely it was that they would find him dead, or not at all. Though Irene would never say it to his face, Sherlock was off his game and it was slowing them down. It seemed as though he was right. Love was a serious disadvantage. But they were close now, oh so close. Irene's was pulled from her thoughts by the man's shout as his body stiffened preparing to climax.
"Mycroft, Anthea, Sherlock; you have to be ready. I don't know where this will lead." Greg warned. Sherlock held a small crucifix and a silver rosary. Greg tried to insist that he carry a stake as well, but he had refused instead giving it Anthea, unable to kill his friend. He did, however, have multiple wards hidden in his Belstaff. The witch held the stake with ease, with her blade within reach ready and waiting for whatever was to come. Mycroft stood resolutely. He too was heavily warded. The Eye of Horus glinted on his lapel and the runes shone brightly on the handle of his umbrella. The ring on his right hand also shimmered eerily. He had pulled the glowing handle of his umbrella from the base revealing an ancient wand, which shone brightly and pulsed with powerful magic ready to strike.
John looked up calmly at the man giving away nothing and replied "You seem to have me at a disadvantage, who are you?"
“Right. Probably because I really can’t think of any circumstances that justify.... There are times when it’s absolutely justifiable to kill; self-defense.” Greg explained still unsure where the conversation was going. Sherlock had warned him to keep his head down and mouth shut, but it may already be too late. The British government may at this very moment be plotting his death.
"I wish to offer you assistance." Mycroft admitted softly with a glance at the grave. "It's what he would have wanted. I spoke that same warning to Sherlock and he did not heed my words. He cared for you, John. Never doubt that fact."
"The element of the profane heightens their pleasure leading to a more satisfying feed." Sherlock replied answering John's question regarding the succubus before trailing off. "John, how did you…"
“Never, Lock. I won’t send you away, but I will have to lock you in the attic and myself in the basement. If you present as Omega, I’ll be fine. You’re kin so your heat pheromones won’t affect me, but if you present as Alpha, your rut will trigger mine if I am too close and that would end in disaster.” Sherlock sighed and hugged his brother unable to quell the fear for himself and his brother regarding the future.
John raised an eyebrow, but otherwise made no comment. "What tour number is this for you?" Jones asked he looked John over seriously. "Did you get a late start? Career change?"
John waited and watched with his eye in the scope squinting as the wind kicked up grains of sand significantly reducing the visibility. Recon training was equal parts patience and precision. John spotted the barest movement amongst the dunes. He pulled the trigger. The red paint marked the target's chest right over the heart, a kill shot. John smirked when he caught of glimpse of the soldier's scowling face. Peter Small. Small looked around angrily for his assassin. "Should've guessed." Small shouted in his direction when he caught sight of John. John only winked at his victim. John's thought's briefly drifted back to the day that they had met.
"A man like you, an alpha like you, deserves a partner who appreciates him," she whispered against his lips and lowered her mouth onto his.
Sherlock leaned forward, pulled out the plug, and let the water drain out. Then he stood up and reached for the towel that hung nearby. He stepped out of the tub and wrapped it around his hips.
John's gaze wandered over the light reflexes caught in Sherlock's hair, combing his fingers through the soft curls as if trying to catch the golden specks. He dug his fingers in hard when Sherlock surprised him by doing something particularly filthy with his tongue. His breath caught, only to escape his lungs a moment later in a shaky sigh.
On the other hand, they were Sherlock's parents. The two people who had created him, who were responsible for his existence.
"...she's an omega?" Cilia crinkled her button nose wryly. She groaned as she sat down on one of the low wooden chairs and sent a grateful smile John's way when he plucked her cup off the tray and set it down in front of her. She dipped her spoon into the heap of whipped cream topping her drink, then licked it off with a blissful smile.
The flat looks exactly like it did when he left. With the small addition of some files which suspiciously look like they belong to Scotland Yard (which Sherlock hopefully received from Greg and didn’t nick), and a couple of empty teacups lying around. This can only mean that Mrs Hudson, who usually takes care of the inexorable chaos when John is not at home, is either visiting her sister for a few days or that Sherlock has scared her away. Hopefully not the latter. John would have to grovel to excuse the uncouth behaviour of his flatmate because Sherlock probably doesn’t even understand what he might have done wrong. But in John’s opinion Mrs Hudson is vital for the survival of the two men living here and she must therefore be handled with care. He makes a mental note to drop by her flat tomorrow at the latest and check if everything is in order.
"Quite so, I'm afraid." Sherlock confirmed pulling his bow across the strings harshly causing the violin to screech. John winced and grit his teeth. Bloody hell. "Did he ask you to spy on my for money?" Sherlock asked.
John lifted his head a couple of millimetres and gave her an assessing look. "It's generally difficult to deal with being lured into a trap and beaten up. No matter the reason," he said after a while.
"Yes. No. I don't know. He knows that I've always had satisfactory sex with betas, and that a heat isn't—"
"Home. Now." Sherlock murmurs. Spots of heat are appearing on his cheeks and neck and send a promising tingle through John’s limbs.
"Nothing. That's just it... He didn't do anything. In fact, he was always quite solicitous with me. Not like Mycroft. He was patronising. But Sherrinford... he always kept an eye out for me. I was the baby of the family and he was my big brother. He often read me fairy tales, I still remember that..."
"Let's go then. Sherlock, you're coming too," Victor decided and grabbed Sherlock's arm to drag him toward the exit.
John sighed and set the bottle down on the counter so that he could pull his omega into a tighter embrace. He ran his hand soothingly over Sherlock's hair, the back of his neck, and his tense back. He knew Sherlock was having a hard time waiting for his heat to start. Although their sex life over the past few weeks had been extremely fulfilling and John was completely happy and satisfied, the lack of a heat overshadowed their relationship. Not that John was missing anything. But he'd caught glimpses here and there of Sherlock furtively taking his temperature, checking the calendar, and unconsciously rubbing the scar on his nape. He was restless.
Just then, John noticed the billboard directly in front of him, which he had studiously avoided looking at until then. It showed a futuristic stereo sound system, which could be purchased for a horrendous price. A red-cheeked Father Christmas promised that it was the perfect gift for any music lover, and that it came with an
With a sudden burst of intuition, Sherlock sat up and looked around the living room. Something must be here somewhere... but unfortunately, unlike himself, John tended not to leave his stuff lying out all over. That was probably the one good habit that had stuck with him from his time in the military.
Standing beside John, Anthea said, "He's always been mad for him," in a strangely bored tone of voice, without specifying whether she was referring to Sherlock or Archie. "Thanks for the flowers. They're quite lovely."
"We need to do something about your hair," Victor said and got up to go into the bathroom. He returned a few seconds later, rubbing his fingers together in a circular motion, and reached for John's head. John just barely managed not to look too sceptical as Victor tugged at his hair. Victor examined his work with a satisfied grin and went to wash his hands.
"We want someone we trust. Someone with integrity. Someone who's brave, smart, and strong. An alpha who isn't like all the others. Someone like you, John!"
Sherlock chuckled lightly. "I wasn't sure it would work, but the experiment was definitely worth it. And it was surprisingly simple."
John stopped in the doorway, rooted to the spot, as he slowly absorbed the grisly scene. Covering his mouth with one hand, he realised that a gun would be of as little use here as the bandages he'd brought. The bedroom he found himself in – presumably that of the master of the house – was spattered with red as if an overly enthusiastic artist had tossed buckets of paint around.
Yes, his denial could be called half-hearted at best. John knew that Sarah wasn’t wrong. John knew that Sherlock was fascinating. John knew there was nothing and no one he liked to talk more about. And why not? Who didn’t like the crazy adventures of the clever and world's only
"And I felt what you were feeling. More than once. And not just in the extreme situation when you almost died." John casually stroked Sherlock's arm, running his thumb along the scar on the inside of his elbow. "Do you understand what I'm trying to say?" he pressed.
John shook his head and gave Bill a lopsided grin. "No, just the opposite, we haven't even really got started."
John shrugged and picked up his teacup, only to hold it in his hands rather than taking a sip. The red-hot porcelain burned against his skin. "What does it matter?"
As if in a trance, John walked the few metres back to 221B, nearly causing a rear-end collision on Baker Street. As soon as he stepped into the living room, his legs finally gave out and he dropped to his knees. He spread the newspaper out so that he could view all of the pages of text and pictures.
The time between each murder had increased, but there was no recognisable mathematical pattern there either. Lestrade had hit a dead end, and Sherlock couldn't help him. Whoever the killer was, he was holding his cards close to his chest.
"You don't know what you're talking about, Sherlock." Months later, Sherlock would recall the icy chill in his brother's voice at that moment. "I am not having an affair with another alpha. How can you even dare suggest such a thing?"
Sherlock stood with his back to John. His head lowered, he grasped the countertop as hard as he could, his breaths coming in stuttering gasps. The scent was much stronger here, and multiplied John's arousal exponentially. His mouth filled with the familiar taste of honey when he ran his tongue across his lips. Still, he needed to be sure.
John stared at the screen for a while, waiting for an answer, but when none came even after several seconds, he stuck his phone back into his pocket.
Sherlock was acutely aware of his pulse beating faster – although he couldn't quite explain why. "Scenting is... something extremely personal and only occurs within a family unit. Parents usually initiate it when their children are small – but I presume that was never the case in your family."
." Sherlock almost tilts forward, when John maximises the vibration for a moment to silence him. Sherlock gets the hint, exhales audibly and squints to apologize. "I am sorry. Please forget what I’ve just said. You are of course absolutely able to solve this case alone. Please excuse me."
A few days later, he was sitting in Mike Stamford's waiting room; Mike was also a beta, but had practised omega medicine for years now. Sherlock had avoided seeing him because he was the one who had introduced Sherlock and John. It would have been incredibly unpleasant for him to explain the arrangement they'd made.
Victor broke out in peals of laughter. Not because of the new nickname, but because of Sherlock's deer-in-the-headlights expression. He looked at the young woman as if he'd been struck by lightning, apparently completely unable to comprehend her impertinence. Before he'd managed to find the right words to protest, Abigail had manoeuvred him onto the dance floor and started swinging her hips provocatively in order to get Sherlock to dance. Sherlock's eyes darted to Victor for a moment, seeking help, then back to Abigail. He eventually capitulated and began moving in time with the music.
John shook his head incredulously. The smile didn't disappear from his face, but it didn't reflect any joy. "And you think it's that easy?"
!" Sherlock leaned his head back and moaned breathily when John bit down a little too firmly on his neck, and sucked hard. This time he was definitely going to leave a prominent hickey.
Sherlock wanted to have him here. Wanted to make the 'we' come true that he'd carelessly mentioned in the kitchen not long ago. Even if Sherlock only wanted a guiding hand, backup, someone he trusted...
John's veins filled with ice water. The small amount of lust he'd been feeling up to that point evaporated into thin air. He looked around for Bill, and found her massaging a long-haired omega's small breasts. The girl had her head thrown back and one hand on her crotch, which she was rubbing feverishly.
It was obvious that some secret message was hidden behind the words; a message that wasn't intended for John's eyes. He couldn't help but notice that all of the texts sounded suspiciously like excerpts from fairy tales. John couldn't recall whether his parents had ever read him any fairy tales. He was only familiar with a couple of details from the more well-known stories. But without further assistance, he wasn't able to match the letters with the associated fairy tales.
"I'd really like to know which of the components can alter your scent. I've been working on a substance to suppress omega pheromones for quite a while now. If I'd had my breakthrough earlier, I wouldn't have had to bond with an alpha at all!"
Nonplussed, John looked at him, eventually nodding. It wasn't unusual for people who had been physically attacked to need company. Or at least that's what he told himself.
"His network. We're taking it apart piece by piece. My best operatives are currently in the midst of uncovering and eliminating individual cells that have been linked to Moriarty all over the world. Those gangs have become sloppy since Moriarty's death was made known in the proper circles. However, we don't know who has taken over the helm since his supposed demise, or whether chaos still reigns within their ranks. For that reason, we need to proceed with utmost caution."
John scraped his fingernails across Sherlock's scalp one last time, then withdrew his hand and stood up.
"Oh, thank God!" John could physically feel the weight lift off his shoulders. A sense of lightness spread through his body as he pulled Sherlock into his arms and hugged him just shy of too hard.
He'd spend a few days at Harry's and think about how he wanted his life to continue. He'd never expected to be injured so seriously in combat that he'd be sent home on an invalid pension. He'd never expected to have to ask Sherlock for shelter. Good God, he'd never even expected to see the man again. And if he did, then not in his current condition, but as the powerful alpha he'd once been.
"And how am I supposed to...?!" he barked, then fell silent when two lips landed on his. He froze completely, only realising at the edge of his awareness that he was being kissed. In the middle of campus. By a man. By his lab partner's boyfriend. Just like that.
"Your face. Precious! You're not particularly good at hiding what you're thinking, John," Victor said, leaning into John a little so that he was the only one who could hear his next comment: "Do you want to take a peek?"
"Will – iii – aaam," Sebastian repeated, drawing each syllable out to an unnatural length. "Almost too pedestrian for such an extraordinary omega as you." He tilted his head to one side as if to inspect Sherlock from another angle, then took a deep breath although he didn't comment on what he smelled.
"Well, that's the point. A bond between an alpha and an omega is generally consummated during a heat, for the specific reason that the processes which the body undergoes ensure that the omega doesn't feel any pain. It's similar to intercourse. Outside of a heat, penetration by the alpha may be perceived as unpleasant or even painful, especially if the omega hasn't been fully prepared. During a heat, the omega's body adjusts to the demands of the act automatically. Muscles relax, essence is produced, and all of that is necessary for the omega's body to fully accept a knot. Pleasure hormones are produced that have a euphoria-inducing and pain-killing effect. Many even report the bite as being pleasurable."
John looked up from the paper that he was reading as Sherlock rifled through the flat frantically searching. "Look, Sherlock, you're doing really well, don't give up now." John urged.
“No, no one, not even you, could be that cruel. You wouldn’t hang Sherlock, your only brother, out to dry.” Greg Lestrade insisted. “I want to help.”
“What about Mrs. Hudson? Voodoo is considered part of the dark arts. Do you considered her beyond redemption?” Sherlock looked at him with his changeable eyes. “Greg will help us, Molly has offered to assist as well, but you have to believe that not all hope is lost.”
He had awoken on the battlefield in Afghanistan with a bullet in his shoulder amongst utter chaos. Bill Murray's voice echoed in his mind. Hold on, John! He had looked into Murray's worried eyes as he squinted against the sun's blinding rays as gunfire rained down upon them and sand kicked up causing the scene to become hazy giving it an almost dreamlike appearance. He could recall with stunning clarity the sound of his own harsh breathing and the erratic pounding of his own heartbeat echoing in his ears as Murray applied pressure to gunshot wound on John's shoulder as his life's blood stained the sand red. John wondered if Murray would be the last thing that he would ever see. John could remember moaning in pain and praying and calling out. "Please, God let me live." Why cast him out and down to earth only to allow him to die? Was this not supposed to act as a test; a way to earn back his all of his grace and if he was good enough, maybe, just maybe, earn back his place in heaven when death finally came for him? His wings were gone for all eternity, but his soul could still be saved. John's back burned as a living tattoo formed in the shape of his wings, a constant reminder of that which he could never hope to have again.
"I owe you my life. I'll do anything in my power to help you." She replied. Sherlock breathed a sigh of relief. "But tell me, what is that I can do for you that your other contacts can't?"
"No, only that it would strengthen his grace enough to keep the darkness at bay." Sherlock replied now regretting not pressing Greg for more information at the time. None of them, not even Greg, had expected to get this far. They never thought it would work. It had been a last ditch effort, a result of Sherlock's heartfelt plea to a friend. John groaned louder and his eyes fluttered opened. Rather than their normal dark blue, they were now a mixture of blue and gold. They darted around anxiously taking in his surroundings before settling on Sherlock and then moving to Mycroft who continued to call John's name. John hissed and squinted averting his eyes away from the rosary's glowing crucifix. It was in that moment that Sherlock caught a glimpse of fangs. Sherlock felt his chest tighten painfully at the sight. Sherlock closed his eyes unable to continue to look at his friend. John, what have you become? The question echoed in his mind over and over. It may all be for naught. Greg had insisted that the white glow of the wings on John's back were evidence of light, but Sherlock was beginning to doubt the truth of Greg's words.
"Jim Moriarty, hi. Don't be silly. Someone else is holding the rifle. I don't like getting my hands dirty. I've given you a glimpse, Sherlock. Just a teensy glimpse of what I've got going on in the big bad world. No one ever gets to me and no one ever will." Moriarty boasted.
The handle of his umbrella was craved with enchanted runes and they glowed eerily in the darkness producing not only a powerful warding affect, but also serving as a conduit for casting spells, enchantments as well as curses. The man also wore a small tiepin shaped in the eye of Horus, another powerful warding symbol. John closed his eyes and concentrated on the mage's magical signature, the equivalent to a DNA footprint looking for black magic. Sensing nothing, John breathed a sigh of relief. What was puzzling was how a self-taught human could have gained such a high level of skill without it. John decided to let that go for now. There were more pressing questions at the moment.
"Let me guess. You're an adrenaline junkie, without a doubt, but it's more than that." Small theorized. "Atypical background, you've got the bearing of a solider, but you're opened and approachable, almost to a fault. You're constantly on the look out, not only for yourself, but for others as well. Protective. Medical background?" John's jaw dropped in surprise and his throat tightened as he was reminded of Sherlock. He closed his eyes tightly and pinched the bridge of his nose pushing the thoughts of his friend back before he broke down in front of a perfect stranger. The smile on Small's face vanished when he realized that he might have stumbled into an emotional minefield unknowingly. "Sorry, mate. I didn't mean to upset you…well, I did warn you, and my mouth gets me into trouble. If it's any consolation, everyone has demons and I'm no acceptation." The young man's eyes turned serious and John could see the pain in them and they were not the eyes of a fresh-faced kid, but of a man who had seen too much and was wise behind his years.
"Angelic grace, it's still present." Lestrade murmured as he caressed the tattoo causing the feathers to pulse weakly, then to flutter and shift much like a hologram. The missing pieces fell into place; that was why John had set off his wards. While not inherently dark by nature, fallen angels were by their very existence on the edges of darkness, until they earned back all of their grace and moved back into the light and to their redemption into heaven. John's grace was weak, but there was still light and goodness in him, but it was fading as he turned. John's grace needed strengthening, but he was turning. As that happened, John was being pushed further into the darkness away from the light.
“All lives end. All hearts are broken. Caring is not an advantage.” Mycroft murmured the words into his brother’s ear as Sherlock trembled beside him. Sherlock shook his head and buried himself into Mycroft’s side. Mycroft sighed softly and allowed it at 18 he towered over his 11 year old brother. “Sherlock, I tried to warn you...” Mycroft trailed off as his brother shook softly attempting to quell his tears as they both stared at the gravesite. The matching headstones engraved with the names of their parents Violet and Sigerson Holmes stood side by side.
"John, do you hear me? Can you understand my words?" Mycroft asked as he pulled Greg's silver rosary from his cassock and held it in front of him like a shield; it glowed softly with holy magic still infused with the priest's light. "Sherlock, did Gregory tell you what to expect if the ritual was successful?" Mycroft asked as his wand pulsed brightly as Mycroft prepared to cast another spell.
Perhaps Sholto hadn't called him here to discipline him. No, that wasn't his intention. He wanted the full story that much was sure, but it wasn't to make his life miserable. The man was knew what it was like to have a death wish and could see himself in John. He wanted to save him. John didn't quite know what to make of that.
He'd moved all of Sherlock's things up to the second floor. The only thing he'd kept was Sherlock's blue scarf, which he stored safely tucked away amongst his jumpers. He'd lugged a cardboard box with personal documents into the living room so that Mycroft could take care of them when he had time. John hadn't really looked at the papers, feeling as if it would be like snooping in Sherlock's private affairs.
Sherlock checked his watch and calculated that he had a little over an hour before John returned from the late shift. That should be enough, he decided, and went into the bathroom. After a thorough wash, he walked nude into the bedroom and opened the bottom drawer of his dresser, where he kept the alpha dildo he'd bought several months ago to get John's goat.
"Did he touch you?" John growled hoarsely as he yanked Sherlock up, almost manhandling him and scratching his chest as if in doing so he could destroy all trace of the imaginary rival. "I'll kill him, you hear? You belong to me!"
John let his groans sound unabashedly throughout the room as he picked up the pace. Sherlock sighed and gasped along with him. He quivered and shook, adjusting his own motions to the tempo set by John as well as he could from his position.
The thought that no one had ever touched Sherlock in this way before sent a heady tingling sensation zinging through Victor's body and straight to his cock. He bit down hard on his bottom lip as he tried to tamp down the urge to ravage Sherlock here and now. He scratched his fingernails over the rough fabric, ramping up the intensity of his touch by several factors. Sherlock's eyes fell shut and his brow wrinkled, his mouth dropping open slightly as his breath caught.
The content was as clear as water, pristine and innocuous. However, Sherlock knew that the appearance was deceiving. After all, the liquid contained a mixture of alpha pheromones and other chemicals that were invisible to the eye. Arriving at a decision, Sherlock reached for one of his last disposable needles and drew about half of the contents of the first vial into the syringe. He then rolled up his left sleeve and examined the crook of his elbow. The last puncture marks glared at him in an angry red. Another injection would hurt much more than usual.
Mycroft withdrew his mobile phone from his trouser pocket and entered a number with the quick-dial button. "You can come up now, the cat is out of the bag," he said and ended the call again.
"Mrs Holmes... I know it's not an excuse, but Sherlock would have discovered drugs with or without me sooner or later. He was always looking for things that gave him that special kick. Not just with drugs, but in all areas of his life. I didn't seduce him into anything. I was just there with him and took care of him as much as I could without forbidding anything, which he would have just done in secret anyway without any backup," Victor countered calmly.
"That's utter nonsense!" Sherlock hissed, and tore open the door to the consultation room in order to get as far away as possible.
It was true. The boiler had used up all of the hot water, leaving only lukewarm water to come out of the showerhead, and even that was cooling rapidly. John quickly untangled himself from Sherlock, lathered himself up as fast as he could, and rinsed off. Then he got out of the tub and reached for a towel to dry himself off peremptorily. He then took another towel off the rack, which he held up for Sherlock, who was squeezing the last few drops of water out of his hair and turning off the shower. When Sherlock put out a hand to take the towel, John shook his head.
The blow that hit Sherlock wasn't entirely unexpected. In fact, he probably could have sidestepped it – if he'd wanted to. Pain exploded in his head and he was overcome by a sense of vertigo. Dazed, he staggered back two steps before he got himself under control again and placed one hand on the throbbing spot on his face.
Still somewhat wobbly on his legs, John staggered to the showers to wash off the dust and filth of the past few days. Then he had a late breakfast and returned to work around lunchtime. There, he ran into Bill, who greeted him with a small, lopsided smile and red-rimmed eyes.
"They didn't teach you much in that stupid club, did they?" Victor mocked, only to be overpowered by John a moment later and thrown to the floor again. He groaned out loud when John landed on him with his full weight. Another punch split Victor's lip open. Victor moaned in pain and held the back of his hand against his mouth.
"As if you needed to worry about that kind of thing," Harry sneered, scowling as she scooped a helping of peas onto her plate. "You were always the model son, weren't you? Mr Perfect, Dr Watson, soldier, alpha. Enough to make anyone sick!"
Making a spur-of-the-moment decision, Sherlock reached behind himself for John's cock, which was brushing his perineum in a very promising manner, and stabilised it as he sank down on it. He sucked in a surprised breath as it passed through his naturally dilated ring of muscle yet still managed to stretch it noticeably. He paused halfway, straightening up a little so that John almost slipped out, only to lower himself again when he felt a fresh wave of omega essence flow out of him.
"Hm," Sherlock grunted his acknowledgement as he filled the kettle – just to keep busy until John had disappeared into the bathroom. As soon as the door closed, Sherlock set the kettle back on the heating element and hurried over to the duffle bag. He opened it and dug out two or three articles of clothing at random, which he held up to his face. He slung the t-shirt that smelled most of John over his shoulder, then stuffed the rest back inside and pulled the drawstring closed again.
, Sherlock thought to himself and reached for his coffee cup. He stared down into the dark brown liquid, in which the six lights of the contemporary chandelier hanging over the table were reflected.
"Yes... that wasn't the first one, though." Victor told John about receiving a call from Mycroft when he was in the States and Mycroft telling him about Sherlock's overdose in the abandoned house and Abigail's death. Victor had returned to England as quickly as possible and found Sherlock in an appalling state.
"I'm sure you're right," Victor said, laughing, and manoeuvred himself into a sitting position, flipped the comforter back, and swung his legs out of bed. "What time is it anyway?"
Sucking air in between his teeth, Sherlock plunged the needle into his lower arm, squeezed the plunger down, and then withdrew it. A single drop of blood welled up out of the injection site, catching the light that fell through the gap in the curtains, and rolled down his arms as if trying to spread the light there.
Mrs Holmes sat stock still on the upholstered cube, staring down at her hands folded in her lap. Her blue eyes, which were so reminiscent of both of her sons', remained motionless in her ashen face.
Sherlock glanced over his shoulder and saw Mycroft clenching his hands into fists. A whining sound escaped his throat, but Sherlock couldn't tell whether it was from grief or anger.
John wasn't in the room; instead, someone had left an open laptop computer on Mycroft's desk, the screen showing only a black square. The little green light at the top of the screen indicated that the camera was on.
The happy gleam in her eyes was promising, and a little social networking never hurt anyone. But they hadn't taken more than a couple of steps before Victor regretted his generosity. The young woman had apparently decided to take advantage of his attention to pour her heart out to him over the pluses and minuses of her college. Things that Victor was no stranger to. The campus was fairly old, and so were the residence halls; the heating rarely worked, and things were constantly breaking. Of course, no one felt responsible for making repairs, so you had to either take care of things yourself or simply accept the situation. Most students tended toward the latter course.
"Happy New Year, Mr Hard-to-Get!" Abigail said with a smirk. Her eyes widened when he let her in. "Oh, I see my matchmaking efforts have borne fruit!" She grinned broadly as she pointed at Victor's neck.
They walked together to the lift and rode down one floor to get to the secured interview rooms. They stopped in front of a solid iron door labelled 03, which was guarded by an armed beta wearing full-body armour.
"Stay here, I'm going to have a look around first," Mary said and walked past the kitchen toward the living room, her hand on her gun. She looked into both rooms to check them before knocking on a closed door and raising her voice.
"Don't you think I know fairly well how an omega works? Do you really believe that one small bite will do more damage than knotting with some random alpha who my brother picked out so he could finally get me out of his hair?!" Sherlock fell silent, shocked at his own words, and snapped his mouth shut. He'd given away much more than he'd intended. But it was too late now. He needed to convince John. At any cost.
John shrugs. "It's okay. You're just not used to anything that hot." His grin widens when Sherlock gives him a half-amused, half-disparaging look.
. As a result, Nigel's first impression of John was made in connection with the terms 'drugs' and 'violent', and had been filed away in that drawer in his head. John didn't have any influence on whether Nigel might change his mind at some point. But he didn't really care whether the coach liked him or not, as long as he could conjure up the illusion of old times for a couple of hours a week. Even if it was the harmless version.
John stopped directly behind Sherlock and examined the smooth, creamy white skin covering his narrow shoulders. He thought he could make out Sherlock's pulse fluttering in his throat. What he was sure of, though, was how fast Sherlock was breathing and how tightly he was gripping the armrests.
John carefully withdrew his finger and held it up for inspection. The tip gleamed wetly in the light from the bedside lamp.
He sighed as he went into the kitchen and put some water on to boil. While the kettle was heating up, he dug some clothes out of the wardrobe in the bedroom and got dressed. It was nearly five o'clock when he settled into his armchair in the living room with a cup of tea and stared blankly at the black television screen.
He picked up the phone debating for moment before dialing the number. It rang a few times before a female voice answered. "Hello, this is Harry." Greg hoped he wouldn't regret this.
"This is a lost cause and we all know it, Sherlock. As badly as we all feel about what happened to John, it's reckless to ask Lestrade to do this. It's putting him in grave danger. End it now, before it goes any further. If you don't want to do it, I will." She said as she held up the stake and hammer. The athame blade tucked into her belt shimmered in the candlelight. Greg was glad that she had the foresight to bring it; it was a powerful weapon, which only a natural witch could harness. The blades were often used in pagan rituals and Greg could see that this one was strongly enchanted.
"That's when the drugs started. We went to a lot of parties – there's always a lot going on around the New Year – and he wanted to try something new. There was no stopping him. As soon as he figured out who was selling what where, he was willing to try out all sorts of things. I didn't try to stop him. How are you supposed to stop a hurricane?" Victor asked acerbically and shook his head with a resigned air.
Ryan's hand slid down Sherlock's body and between his arse cheeks, his long fingers resolutely smearing the gel onto his hole. Gasping for air, Sherlock dug into Victor's nape and let out a cut-off sound when one finger, then two, pushed inside him. His body writhed and jerked at the mercy of the hands methodically stimulating him; he didn't seem to be in control of it any more.
"No idea. What day is it? Monday? Tuesday?" Lestrade shrugged and tried to conceal a yawn. "Doesn't matter. I won't be able to sleep peacefully until this whole mess has been sorted and the noose is off my neck. After all, it's my case being driven straight into a ditch. You cannot begin to imagine how furious I am."
Various images from the past years flashed past his mind's eye. He saw himself – young, carefree, and naïve – entering the laboratory at St Bart's and meeting Sherlock for the first time. He instantly dismissed the memory of the bite – of the omega in general – as fresh heat simmered in his loins. Instead, he focused on his time in the army and all the different people he'd met there. All the patients he'd been able to save and the countless others for whom it had been too late. He thought of Bill and James. Of his family. Of the tears that had welled up in cornflower blue eyes when they'd broken up because the relationship had been doomed from the start. He'd truly tried, but it wasn't meant to be...
"The baptism?" Sherlock asked, unable to keep his voice entirely free of disparagement. "Why do they want you to be the godfather? Have you ever seen the child?"
Now that Bill was there to offer her the security she needed, the omega was like a different person. John decided to continue from the point at which he'd been rejected before, and ran his fingers up Cilia's thighs, first on the outside, then the inside. He was fascinated by the way gooseflesh spread across the surface of her body. He noticed her flat stomach twitch underneath the silken material when his fingers finally neared her vulva. When no protest was forthcoming, he stroked upward along the smooth slit, carefully spread her labia, and exposed her clitoris. He gently brushed the bud with his thumb, stroking downward towards her opening. The scent of rock candy seemed to intensify.
But it was different this time. Sherlock had felt very clearly John's attraction to another omega. An omega in heat. His feelings about that were conflicted. On the one hand, he felt excitement, lust, and desire; at the same time, though, there was anger and disgust. It was hard to tell whether those negative emotions were directed at the other omega, or at Sherlock, who had refused John and taken away any chance he might have had to ever connect with his own omega.
omega of having killed someone in cold blood? And beyond that, you allow another one of my omegas to be raped by one of your people in my own home? How bloody impertinent are you anyway? Sebastian is far too much of a simpleton to have been able to so much as plan anything like that! Plus – how the
They hadn't spoken much more, falling asleep entwined soon after. Both too exhausted, physically and emotionally, to stay awake any longer. John was therefore quite surprised when he woke in the middle of the night.
The table was set and full of food. Along with coffee and tea, there was toast, croissants, jam and honey, along with cold cuts, bacon, beans, grilled tomatoes and fried eggs.
He scratched the stubble on his cheek with his thumbnail and tossed his razor back into his shaving kit, unused. Beards weren't exactly a welcome sight in his unit, but John didn't care one whit. They could go ahead and discipline him if they didn't like the way he looked. Didn't matter one way or the other.
Sherlock still thought it was a good idea for them to buy John's parents' house, even though John had expressed the opposite opinion. All the same, Sherlock wanted to find out whether an investment like that would be a waste of money, or alternatively completely unproblematic. It was just a question of having security. But explaining that to Mycroft... Sherlock didn't think it would do any good. At least not today. Once he had John on his side, on the other hand, things would look different.
John hurriedly approached the bed and held his index and middle fingers against Moran's neck. As expected, he felt no pulse. Instead, the head rolled to one side, revealing a massive gash where his neck gaped open. Another slash appeared to have opened his femoral artery.
John sighed softly. "I know. It's not going to be an easy path. But that's exactly why they need as much support as possible. Mycroft needs his strong, brilliant, fantastic brother on his side to fight for his rights. And I'll be there too, doing my best."
"What the hell are you on about?!" she snapped, which in turn caused Henry to burst out in tears and begin crying bitterly. Cilia was at his side in an instant to lift him away from Sherlock. She turned her back on the group and tried to calm Henry with soft, soothing words.
Sherlock effected a lackadaisical shrug and waved vaguely between John's head and his feet. "The underprivileged classes. I mean, look at you."
Several weeks later, John was sitting in a little café sipping a glass of hot tea. He was trying to filter out Bill's chatter from amidst the noise of the other guests at the neighbouring tables and the hectic market sounds around them. Even if he was only listening with half an ear to her anecdotes about Cilia and the baby. Everything was too loud, too warm, too crowded. And he had little to no interest in what milestones the young Murray offspring had achieved, and how far ahead he was of the other children in his age group.
Although John appeared to be anything but convinced, Sherlock left his alpha standing there and crossed the street. When he pulled open the pub door and entered the gloomy dive, the smell of stale beer, fryer grease, and sweat slammed into him. His eyes grazed across the scattered patrons until they alit on Harry sitting in a booth in the back part of the room. A half-empty pint glass stood on the table in front of her, but Sherlock doubted very much that it was her first. Her head drooped forward, and she was scribbling moodily on a piece of paper.
John took a step back, his initial reaction shock. But a blink of an eye later, he saw Sherlock's cool facade crumble and collapse in on itself. Anguish, incredulity, and a hint of relief were reflected there, as if he couldn't believe that it was John he was seeing. He pressed his left fist against his temple and dug his fingers into his tangled hair. A single tear ran down his cheek and dripped off his chin.
Sherlock fell silent when Archie let out a cry of protest and waved one of his little arms in Sherlock's direction.
Sherlock listened anxiously to the footsteps going down the stairs, then the click of the front door a moment later. Only then did he breathe again, rubbing his right hand across his face. He could barely move that arm. It throbbed and stung as if his nerves were on fire. Despite being left-handed, John had, contrary to instinct, chosen to place his bite on Sherlock's right side.
Sherlock felt like an outsider. Like a detached observer who didn't fit into the others' perfect little family. John and Bill weren't trying to include him in their conversation, and all of Cilia's attention was focused on feeding her child and attempting damage control on the associated mess. It wasn't the first time Sherlock had felt this way, and it certainly wouldn't be the last. He was well aware that he wasn't the most desirable guest, with the way he acted and his unpopular views. But adding in the fact that he hadn't been able to talk things out with John yet, and the thorn of uncertainty that was boring into his side, he felt even more off kilter than ever.
"As if you give a shit." Harry gave her brother a disparaging look and drew the thin hospital blanket up to her neck. "And spare me with the bedside manner. I'm not one of your patients!"
Mike hesitated a moment, but then replied confidently, "Yes, we discussed the possibility of a soul bond between you and John. Has your feeling about that changed in any way?" he asked, his curiosity evident in his tone.
Sherlock started violently when a hand landed on his shoulder. It took him a moment to break through the veil of his own pain and recognise his brother. Mycroft's furrowed forehead and drawn-together eyebrows reflected commiseration and understanding, things that Sherlock only rarely saw in him.
A heat without his alpha would be pure torture for Sherlock. Of course John would also feel the effects, and he didn't want that either. But he wasn't going to be hobbled by Sherlock's dramatics any longer. Not after everything that had happened over the past few weeks.
"I've brought biscuits," she announced and let go. She briskly picked up the two cups of tea John had prepared and set them onto the kitchen table, then went over to the refrigerator and got out the milk.
"Calm down, John." Bill put one hand on his chest, which was rising and falling at a frantic pace. "Inhale and exhale. We don't want any panic attacks. In... and out, with me now. That's right."
After she had found Marcus, the five of them went out to his car together. Happily, he had agreed to be the designated driver for the evening, and hadn't had anything to drink. Or at least less than anyone else, Victor suspected.
He went into the kitchen, where he discovered that John was wearing the dressing gown and setting the table.
Sherlock watched his alpha until the bathroom door closed with a soft click and the water in the shower turned on. He swallowed down a sound filled with longing that was trying to escape his throat, and reached for the teacup that stood ready on the table.
They lay side by side, arms wrapped around each other in silent accord, too tired to express themselves with anything more than soft kisses and caresses on innocuous parts of their bodies. It was a new form of intimacy, one they'd had little experience with before. An intimacy that had been, at best, forced on them by their biology between heats and been powerless against. But now it progressed naturally, without compulsion.
John thought about Mycroft, who appeared to be even more rigorous in that regard than his younger brother had been. Even if Sherlock certainly never would have admitted it, Mycroft had definitely had a formative influence on his manner of thinking and his actions. Was Mycroft responsible for Sherlock's belief that emotions were a bad thing? That they were an obvious disadvantage to the losing side?
"Help me..." He indicated the trunk, and once Mary had opened the metal lid for him, he numbly pawed through the papers, photographs, and letters.
What had happened? What had they discussed that would have an effect like that on the man who was otherwise such an even-tempered port in every storm?
Sherlock promptly obeyed the silent command, albeit with slight irritation. Something seemed to be wrong. Had he done something wrong?
"Yeah, I think so too." Lestrade said, keeping his eyes locked on John as he continued his examination.
In the meantime, Sherlock was carefully stowing the shopping in the refrigerator and cupboards, lurking around the edges of John's space, never straying more than a hand's length away. Now and then, he would nab a piece of the vegetables John had chopped and pop it into his mouth. Out of the corner of his eye, John watched as Sherlock stuffed a couple of TV dinners into the freezer, lingering in front of the open door a little longer than necessary as if basking in the chill from the icebox. He sighed before closing the door firmly and rubbing the back of his neck.
"Look, her construction is quite shapely, don't you think?" Sherlock asked curling his mouth into a smirk.
important to me... and I... shouldn't have taken advantage of the situation on New Year's Eve. That was...
"Where are we going, anyway?" John wanted to know once they were sitting in a carriage on the Victoria line. He examined his image in the window pane across from him. Victor had done quite a good job. John wasn't used to wearing his hair combed back, but he quite liked it. He normally had it cut shorter, but he'd been putting off his usual visit to the barber for a few weeks now.
"Hey," he said curtly, stuffing his hands into the pockets of his jeans, which had the effect of making him look rather shy, an image that didn't suit Victor at all.
Sherlock's breathing stops audibly at the sight that presents itself to him. He pushes the pyjama bottoms off his legs and kicks it off the bed, holding both arms out to John and sighing in relief when he readily lies next to Sherlock and snuggles up to him. "John..."
