“I have access to the royal library,” Sherlock explained. “There isn’t much about the Fire Swamp, but that was one of the accounts.”
“And it never happened.”
Sherlock heard the shouting, made dim by the thick chapel walls. He glanced at Jamiarty. “Here’s John now.”
*******
Billy comes to visit his grandfathers at the cottage. He has a few questions.
Warnings for minor character death and some angst.
“Yes, that one.”
But the shirt was nice and big and warm and smelled like Sherlock, so John pulled it on. Sherlock lay on his side on the bed, the blankets drawn back. It was a small bed, barely big enough to be called a double, but it was just big enough for John to cuddle into Sherlock’s chest and holding him tightly, manage to pull the blankets up and turn off the light without falling out of bed.
And his lips are soft. So soft. Softer than they have any right to be in the frigid night air.
Cheers,
Sherlock’s lips quirked. “That’s
Without question, John's life started going odd again the moment a girl came crashing through the front window.
Watson approached him, not quite knowing what to say.
Holmes stood near him the whole time, saying nothing to defend him. In a way that felt worse—his husband no doubt knew of his injuries no matter what he did to conceal them, but his lack of rebuttal was shaming. Watson didn’t speak to him as they got into a cab and returned to Baker Street.
The song was quiet for a long time, though the violin played other songs—ballads instead of fugues, Mendelssohn instead of Beethoven, songs to sleep to instead of songs to think to. The violin understood its master's fingers, and kept the true notes disguised under soft, distant harmonies. The master hoped to put the wistful notes to sleep by playing them out, but when he least expected it his fingers would retrace the same patterns, and only a quick change of key would keep suspicion at bay.
“The wedding starts at sunset,” Grezzik said suddenly.
Mild sexual content.
Grezzik picked up John’s body in one hand, grabbing hold of Maria with the other.
“Good. I want you to go and renew the treaty. Make up whatever you like, just get in the door. In fact, you should agree to whatever they say. While you’re talking, get Riley into the castle. She can search for the baby, and lead you to it.”
Cheers,
“Yes.”
“Is…” John stopped, but it was the question on everyone’s mind. If Riley hated Anderson, if she could defy Jamiarty…was the child alive?
“So are you thinking adoption, or…”
“Well there you go. You’d better come with us—taking you to Florin is inviting your murder.”
The two guards looked up in surprise. “Fucking spy,” one of them snarled.
He was the most beautiful man on earth.
Dimmock raised his eyebrows. John glared at him. "He's got a migraine, Dimmock."
Now she ran, and there was more than Waverly in her mind. With every blast of pain she saw something new—her childhood where she never knew her father, an empty grave, the pain in her father’s eyes, and her people. All her people, suffering under a murderous Prince.
“Apologies,” he called. “I seem to have brought several lunatics to your cottage.”
Hope everyone who celebrates Christmas has a great one, and for everyone else have a lovely day tomorrow and I hope your holiday is wonderful.
Sherlock held him even tighter, somehow. They stood like that for a long time.
“You put a lot of faith in your dearest love.”
For the first time since they’d met, Sherlock was completely quiet as John led him past Lestrade and out of the small park. He didn’t say a word as John signalled a cab, just nodded when John inclined his head (he wasn’t going to make that mistake again, thank you). John dropped a piece of paper into the front seat with the address. The cabbie gave him a look, but John just smiled. “It’s a surprise.”
Now he knows for sure that that’s not true. He would give up anything to do this with John for the rest of eternity. For John to want this, for him to have permission to reciprocate. He wishes he could just forget this night, for it not to torture him every time he sees John, or even thinks about him, a reminder of what could have been. But as his mind palace is cataloging every detail, every touch, every noise, he knows that is impossible.
John’s hand abruptly stills.
And just like that, he breaks out into a full-blown grin, the first one Sherlock has seen in years. It’s a simple action, but accumulated stress seems to physically fall off of him and he looks ten years younger. He bites his lip, an action that has been bloody antagonizing for years, and Sherlock brings his finger to his own lip in an unintentional response, to the same spot where John’s mouth was mere hours before.
Because he has finally found a way to make John laugh again. And he unquestionably refuses to ever let a case, or a psychopath assassin fiance, or an underground terrorist network ever become a higher priority than that.
Without thinking, Sherlock shifts slightly, angling his leg upward to the right and not-so-subtly providing friction directly against said bulge.
John lazily rubs his thumb along Sherlock’s closed cock, clearly pleased with the effect it’s having. The sensations are almost overwhelming.
He turns back, expecting John to be upset, possibly violent, but instead he is sitting, eyes open and vulnerable, confusion etched into every line of his face, staring intently at Sherlock as if he’s attempting to solve a complicated puzzle.
The thought shouldn’t repulse him as much as it does.
“And you once shot a cab driver” Sherlock beams fondly back.
“For what it’s worth, I’m glad you didn’t die”. Oh God. That’s even worse. It makes the whole situation seem flippant, casual, almost funny, when in reality, it is the most since statement that Sherlock has ever uttered in his entire life. Also it brings the attention back to the fact that Mary did die, highlighting the fact that he still hasn’t responded to any of John’s other sudden declarations.
All he knows is, John can't finish that second bottle. If somehow, miraculously, the alcohol alone isn’t enough to kill him, who knows what that level of inhibition would do to his already fragile mental state. When he's drunk he becomes painfully honest, angry.
That was when he had decided to steal a ceramic ashtray he’d seen John eyeing with amusement. It was all white except for a few hideous blue splotches. He wondered if John was remembering the one he stole from Buckingham Palace. Probably not. He probably just found it funny, didn’t matter.
Now, for the first time ever, he is certain John is never going to leave this flat. Not in the next 24 hours at least, and, even then, definitely not alone.
“Why da ya care about me anyway?” he slurs as his hands reach for the bench as an anchor to keep himself from toppling over. “You’d be better off without me”.
. Sherlock’s own words come back to him. He remembers the first time he heard them, when Mycroft said them to him the third time he found him curled up on the stairs outside a local drug den, knowing that his next hit wouldn’t be his last, but almost wishing that it would. Back then, he genuinely hadn’t thought anyone would mind if he suddenly stopped existing. Mycroft would put on a good show, his parents would bring flowers to his grave for a few months. Eventually though, life would go on.
Didn’t he?
Unsurprisingly, he still receives no response.
The real reason, the “because I love you” remains unsaid of course, but as he watches John’s eyes bore into his own, and hears the soft “oh” escape his lips he feels that it was understood.
So Sherlock took the dull case, he took lots of dull cases. And instead of arresting the woman immediately, or during any one of the 17 opportunities that were available to him throughout the day, he dragged John to stake out her apartment when he knew she’d be at work. And when her military brother happened to invite some of his friends over, he had decided that would be the perfect opportunity to waltz in and announce that s
John must be remembering that moment too, because he turns and brushes Sherlock’s hand with his thumb, still beaming. “I’ll have you know, last night, kissing you, that was the most ridiculous thing I’ve ever done.”
“You”, he slurs, obviously taking great pains to try to control himself and talk coherently even as his body sways unsteadily on the bench. He pauses for a moment, his face scrunching together in concentration, making Sherlock want nothing more than to kiss the adorable little wrinkle that forms in the middle of his forehead. “It’s you. You make me happy. You…”
Sherlock is in the cab before he has time to think. He can't lose his best friend. Not again. He's not delusional. He has no idealistic fantasies that he could ever be enough for John on his own, for the rest of his life. But he has to reach him now. He has to be enough tonight.
Sherlock steps back, anchoring himself against the table. For God’s sake, if John doesn't touch him right this fucking second he feels as if he might combust on the spot. He arches back and smiles in what he hopes is a semi-seductive manner, at least enough so that the shorter man will be able to get the hint.
“I mean look at you. You’re here. You’re HERE”. He waves his hand generally towards nothing in particular, gesturing at the deserted land around them. “There were so many times during that first month of our marriage that I just left, had to get out. She never once came after me.” He pauses and then picks up speed, slurring words as if in a desperate attempt to get them out before they become locked inside of him forever. “But ya know the worst thing? I don’t even miss ‘er that much. In the last few months I felt angry, but now…” he trails off. “I can’t even remember the last time we had sex.” Another humorless laugh. “The worst part is, I was getting ready to leave her.” He stabs absentmindedly at nothing, or perhaps at where he is still seeing her in his mind. “And then she was dead and I felt nothing, empty, and alone. But I felt like I should feel sad. Like I should have saved her. And now i dunno. It’s gettin’ harder to picture ‘er face.”
“Fuck”, John breathes, finally resuming his kisses, though much less coordinated and meticulous this time. Sherlock wants to take his time, to filter each moment, to construct a whole new room in his mind palace just for this. But soon his own erection is aching too much to ignore.
“Really?” John seems genuinely surprised. “I would’ve thought you’d have liked having the place to yourself again. Focus on the work without all my drama slowing you down.”
What if he’s getting ready to let Sherlock down easy? If he’s not saying anything because he doesn’t want to hurt Sherlock’s feelings? If at least he still cares about Sherlock that much?
John has one hand on Sherlock’s cheek and keeps the other on his hip, almost as if he’s afraid that if he lets go Sherlock will vanish. That, or he’s just focusing all his attention on Sherlock’s mouth instead, which is equally plausible given the intensity with which he’s maneuvering his lips and tongue.
Sherlock still has not really reciprocated, except for his body’s continual betrayal by refusing to allow him to close his mouth in the slightest. His hands remain on the bench, his eyes open, finally regaining their sense of sight only to start cataloguing each movement. John’s golden hair shines under the faint glow of a nearby street lamp. His eyes are closed, his hands clutched desperately to Sherlock's coat, pulling himself closer and closer, almost as if he were trying to melt into Sherlock's body as a final desperate attempt to escape his own.
Nothing as coherent as before, not what am I supposed to say to John?, or what does John want me to do?. Not even,
He was always fine when John was there.
But now. He illogically needs John to like this, as if one incomplete melody can possibly make up for all the hurt and anger from the past three years.
Either way, it’s clearly time to go before John passes out entirely.
John had called him insane, but had followed him in anyway. Just like Sherlock knew he would, just like he always did. Given the circumstances, the fights that followed were relatively amicable. There was one brief moment of being caught off guard when one of the men pinned him to a piano, but John had come to his rescue within seconds. The police were there within minutes.
“No, no, it’s no trouble. This experiment was a wash anyway, I lost interest days ago.” More like never had any interest at all because thoughts of John kept popping up insead.
Back then, even as he was letting himself experience feelings of joy for the first time in over a decade, he was sure he was going to find a way to screw it up, that it was too good to be true, that John would eventually leave.
“I really thought Mary was the one.” He sways on the bench for a moment before grabbing onto the side to steady himself and slouching down. He turns his head upward, gazing into the sky as if the answers he’s searching for are somewhere within that eternal darkness. “I just thought… i dunno what I thought.”
As Sherlock shifts his position, matching John’s thrusts, both of them becoming more breathless, John breaks free and pulls back slightly, Sherlock’s wrapped arms around his waist holding him in place.  “We don’t have to… I mean if you don’t want to..”. His eyes are dark, pupils dilated. His voice is deep and rough, and for all his valiant efforts at forcing the words out, he is still slightly thrusting against Sherlock, seemingly without realizing it.
The thought of Sherlock not wanting this after all the looks, the tension, the fantasizing over the past years is so ridiculous that in any other situation it would cause him to laugh. Now, however, he simply  grabs John’s arse and moves him slightly to the left. Sherlock’s semi-seated position on the table lowers him just enough so their cocks match up perfectly.
“I’ve missed hearing you play. My house is entirely too quiet now.”  Embarrassed, John looks down at the floor, a soft and tender smile playing at his lips. Still not quite genuine, but a marked improvement from the past few months.
John’s breath catches. He leans forward, also not breaking eye contact. The only sound in the flat is their slight breathing, but for once it’s not awkward.
Tomorrow John will go back to his house, he’ll go back to never mentioning Mary, back to keeping his feelings bottled up, back to awkward conversations when he even sees Sherlock at all.
After a few moments, he slowly regains the slightest bit of composure to find that his mouth has gone slack, clearly an unconscious effort on the part of his body to allow John better access. John takes this as consent and continues to press in with full force. Sherlock has never seen him so vulnerable and yet so determined. Other than the occasional bite of food after a full day without, John has never taken charge of anything related to Sherlock. The occasional eye roll of course, and “oh god” whenever a new body part appears in the fridge, but certainly never like this.
"And how exactly does that make any sense?" Sherlock snapped. "How could anything coincide?"
(See the end of the chapter for
“As I observed,” Sherlock snapped, hands shaking as he tore at his tunic. “Here, I’ll make you a bandage.”
Watson shook his head fondly. He knew Holmes would likely be cleaned up and on the doorstep before he was. He managed it every time.
Ireni’s smile vanished. “You don’t
“Did you d-dive in?”
“And you’ll tell me?” Billy asked, eyes round.
“All that I have and more.
No one said a word.
Her mother’s worship of the sun goddess had brought her to Ireni’s father during an eclipse. He was a hunter, blessed by the Moon as a child. They were only together for that one night; they couldn’t live in the same light, different as they were. So Ireni went between them as a child; summer and fall with her mother, winter and spring with her father, learning her powers.
The woman made the decision for him.
That was Grezzik again, his eyes still blank.
“Sure,” John said agreeably. “We do have about twenty minutes.”
This will be over soon, my dear John. I promise—SH.
“What do you mean?”
Sherlock came up behind him and pressed his lips to his neck. “Want to bet?”
“The Thieves’ Quarters is empty, and there are sixty men at the gate.”
I'm taking a break from fanfiction posting for about two weeks in general, and as for the Sherlock fandom you may not see much until December (I have a bunch of SPN and Harry Potter stuff coming up, if anyone's into those). Hope to see you then!
And here we are, the scene several of you have been waiting for :)
I am so, so sorry this is late! My ribs got messed up this week and I fell a bit behind!
“How come you haven’t left already, if you are so ready?” Grezzik asked.
“Your word you won’t double-cross us?”
“I’ll tell you later,” Watson replied, the darkness gathering again. “I need to sleep.”
“I have heard that Princess Sherlock has taken a husband,” he said stiffly. “My congratulations.”
Sherlock chuckled. “That’s a very interesting question. What love is, I mean. Though that’s not what you meant, it’s rather in line with what I want to ask you.”
, said the other part.
Janine swallowed hard. If she’d succeeded, Waverly would have disappeared.
“I don’t think that’s right. The Princess is innocent.”
“We don’t have to do this, you know.” Maria got to hers, her sword in her left hand. “If you leave now and go the other way, I’m happy to let you go.”
Molly had her hand around her sword handle in a second, but the girl picked herself up. “Good to see you, husband.”
“I am rather disappointed I never got an announcement.”
Holmes stared at John, a lump coming into his throat. How could he put what he felt for this man into words? Even if he’d had a hundred years, he would never be able to say it exactly.
“That would be unwise,” Holmes agreed, arm still interlocked with Watson’s. “We’re just exploring the park by night. Wandering urges, you see.”
“Spring is eternal in our hearts,” Janine retorted, making a fist above her heart. “Besides, we needed cloaks. We’ve got quite a few dignitaries among us.”
John still didn't quite understand.
John sat down heavily. “Sherlock...dear, what's wrong? You must tell me, you know.”
“Course he didn’t, he’s a fucking spy!”
“What’s happening? A fire?”
“There’s nothing more pathetic than an accidental traitor,” Mycroft mused. He stepped closer. “You’re quick, Riley. You might as well tell us. Jamiarty had another half-sister, did he? We would have heard of a legitimate child, and Queen Bella is infertile.”
“It’s drops from the Veritas flower,” Savira said. “It’s rare as anything, how did you get so much?”
A shudder went through every Carrier. The bleeding woman stared at Sherlock. “What did you say?”
“I’m here, love. Thanks to Grampy, I suppose.”
“Daughter,” Holmes said. “I am so sorry that we must leave you like this.”
John smiled and shook his hand. "John Watson," he replied. "Pleasure to meet you. Now, Blackwater..."
The song became
“I hope that’s enough to buy a miracle. Come, bring the body.”
“You poisoned both glasses. Iocane is deadly, but you can build up an immunity to it.”
Cheers,
“I thought we could spend the day together, that’s all,” Sherlock said.
The tall figure rolling menacingly towards them was bad enough. Then he began to speak.
“Are you sure you have to go in?” Anderson asked.
“Maybe not, but we’re here now.” Janine took Molly’s hand. “We saw the horses and recognized the disguise. And now here we are! Where is Sally?”
“The Hudsons?”
“You lie.”
Once he was finally ensconced in the Diogenes that night, he found himself reaching for pen and paper. It was ridiculous; the letter would get there not two days after Lestrade reached Scotland, but Mycroft wanted to get the first letter over with. It would be the hardest to write.
Years.
Sherlock thought back to the marks he’d seen on John’s back, his shoulders. He’d known they were too old to be from war, too deliberate to be from rugby accidents…but he hadn’t asked.
Sherlock launched himself at the bed, the knife clattering to the floor. “John!”
"We're married now," John explained. "And it's not that marriage itself changes it, it's just that we've committed today to being together forever, and we could, and this is something I never thought I would have."
“Shall we begin?” Mycroft asked a little impatiently.
“You alright, John?”
So if anyone's confused about the Carriers and their genders...it really doesn't have much impact on the story (other than Cerise, since she is a Female woman). I just wanted to extend Florin's gender tolerance to even the low class (and "breeding stock" for the Crown is technically low class, even though they're treated like royalty.
Sherlock freezes. Which part? Not that it matters, of course. He meant everything.
But he doesn’t. Of course.
“No. It wasn’t. That’s the point.” His voice doesn’t change in volume, but it has a certainty to it now. One that leaves no room for debate. “You have to stop being so hard on yourself. It wasn’t nothing. It was definitely something. Something no other person did for me, which makes you the most human human being I know. When was the last time you’ve even taken on a case because you wanted to?
“I shoulda married you ya know”, a singly husky bark of a laugh, devoid of all humor, escapes John as he sloppily sits up, waving the bottle as he looks off into the distance again. “You’re a bloody sociopath too but at least I mighta been happy”.
Sherlock continues to sit quietly, eventually reaching his thumb out to brush against John’s hand on the bench, then gets bolder and slowly moves his whole hand until it’s covering John’s. Human contact. And, as John makes no move to pull away he hopes desperately that by some miracle it will be enough. That it will make John realize everything will be ok. That he is not alone. That he is loved.
He puts John’s arm around his shoulder, stooping so that he can reach, and half drags, half carries him to the street, where miraculously a cab is coming despite the time of night and the snow now falling rapidly. Upon further contemplation, it was probably sent by Mycroft, but at the moment it’s his only option and John is his first priority. Hacking into Mycroft’s phone to deliver a strongly worded message via morse code can wait for another day.
“She was the one that was supposed to feel grief. I was supposed to leave her. She took everything from me. And she went and died and made me feel bad about not being there in time...”
John had reacted in a way he never could have imagined during his two year absence. He had actually grieved, he had actually missed him. He had actually cared.
Sherlock grins all the way to the bedroom. Can’t remember being this happy since that first day, when John had ditched his cane and chased him through the streets of London without a moment of hesitation. When finally, after years of searching and even more years of resignation, he had found the one person who accepted him unconditionally. Who didn’t run screaming at the eyeballs in the fridge, or balk at his too-forward deductions. Someone who truly saw him, and amazingly, liked what he saw even when Sherlock couldn’t see it in himself.
“It was nothing.”
Eventually, Sherlock cannot stand the silence any longer. He slides over slightly, so he is now on the opposite side of the bench, half-angling his body towards John, half toward the water in front of them. He opens his mouth to assure John that he doesn’t expect a response, that he doesn’t expect John to still consider him his best friend in return after everything he’s put him through. But even as he is struggling to push the words out, John comes to life again, his eyes flickering up to meet Sherlock’s for a brief moment before traveling down to his lips and remaining there for one second, two seconds, three… before Sherlock can deduce what’s happening, John is pulling on Sherlock’s coat to force his mouth closer to his own and pushing in.
John steps forward, breath racing slightly, his eyes searching Sherlock’s to ensure he hasn’t somehow been reading the signals all wrong.
It had made him end up here.
Another pause. Only six seconds this time.
Which he might not have the mental capacity to do much longer.
Another message, again from Mycroft. “This isn’t his first bottle. He’s already finished a half-empty one”.
Sherlock had ignored the way his hairs stood on end and his mouth went dry as John had rubbed his hands against his chest, checking for wounds. He was fine, of course.
But he’s even more afraid that John will leave once the music stops.
Through it all, John stares at him intently, an expression written across his face Sherlock can’t quite read, as his eyes explore every inch of his body, every movement, before finally settling on his hands and staying there. Sherlock can’t remember the last time he’s cared what someone has thought about his performance on the violin. He knows he’s good. He knows other people are better. It’s just an outlet, a way to pass the time.
He nods.
Before John has time to react, Sherlock has grabbed the bottle and strode to the water’s edge, where he throws it as far as he can. He stands still for a second, watching it hit the murky darkness and get sucked under.
“Right, well.” John clears his throat and stares at his shoes. “That was umm. Very nice. I’ve missed this”. He sneaks a look at Sherlock’s face, offering a shy smile, and Sherlock’s heart leaps to his throat.
In a way he was right. But not anymore.
Sherlock wonders if John remembers that he was the one who said that phrase first. He must, right? He wonders if he realizes how long it took him to choose those words exactly. How no combination of sounds in any language could ever have adequately described the multitude of ways in which John had saved his life. How three little words in particular kept forcing themselves to the forefront of his mind no matter how hard he tried to push them away. How terrified he was, because he’d never felt them before. Didn’t even realize he felt them at all until it was too late.
Molly stood next to her and read the scroll. It was precisely as Moran had said.
“You have six fingers on your left hand.”
“Watson, we should go to see a doctor.”
“The greatest of humiliations.”
“Then your trial is complete. May the Powers witness this and grant their favor.” The King paused for a moment. “Cerise of House Donovan, have you determined a punishment for the prisoner?”
“I found her body. I believe it was poison; there were no wounds. There were two cups, but the man in black and the Princess were gone.”
“Your safety comes first, John!” Sherlock shouted. He had leapt up too, towering over John. “How could I live with myself if one of them found you when I was gone, hurt you to make me come back, or to tell where I was?”
“I do. He loves me too, which is handy.”
Grezzik grunted.
Sherlock flexed his hands and stepped a bit closer to John. “I used to think that it was a chemical defect, one that proper training could overcome. All it did was make you weak, and that was hardly useful. So I decided I didn’t need it. Then you came along and proved me right—violently right, because work was no longer enough. I couldn’t sleep with you having nightmares, I forced myself to eat to stop the worry in your eyes, and I felt fear for the first time since childhood when you were threatened. And of course, I thought you didn’t feel anything for me, and I was wasting my time. In short, love made me a fool, a weak one.”
"Sometimes love works that way," John said reasonably. "I never did peg you for bisexual, though."
Domingo shook his head. “You’re a fool. You undersell both my masterpieces and you see only gold. I pity your ignorance.”
“No, thank you,” Watson replied. “Your brother sent me to pick something up from you…?”
“You mean we need her to act like the gullible, greedy bitch that she is.”
The King raised his hand, and the room fell silent.
(See the end of the chapter for
“We are circus performers who have lost our way,” the woman explained. “Is there somewhere nearby where we could earn our bread?”
“Speaking of coming…”
“Who?” It was a fair question.
“Hello Kate!” Sally called.
“We found that place when we…when we were looking for John.” Grezzik bowed his head. “That clearing had an entrance to the Pit of Despair.”
The beggar-woman limped up the palace steps. She ignored the guards who tried to help her, drawing her bundle of rags to her chest and glaring at any who were more persistent. When she got to the Prince’s door, she walked right past the lords and slammed the bundle on the Prince’s desk.
That seemed to set John off again. Greg groaned. "I'm never going to live this down."
“Wildly exciting.” A gray haired Mycroft stepped carefully out, still dignified but more relaxed since his own retirement. “I believe I have performed the required amount of trips now.”
“We have to get them out,” Sherlock said when he could speak. “Jamiarty knows that one of them must be Carla or Sally’s mother.”
“My aunt Cerise is living. She’s in the capital.”
“I am. I would get up, but I am somewhat indisposed.” Watson gestured to his side.
"I've gotten better," his husband protested.
In which, for once, fears are unfounded, and our Victorian family welcomes a new member.
Where in Hell was he?
Without a word Sherlock slowed, grabbing hold of John and tucking them into a doorway. John leaned against the detective, his heart rate refusing to slow.
"I'm a woman dealing with a man who thinks women are inherently inferior," Molly shrugged.
Sherlock stared at him in astonishment. "You...you do, don't you? John, how could I possibly be bored by you?"
“Aren’t we early?”
Cheers,
“Fine.”  John made to go, then stopped. His shoulders were suddenly tense. “Actually, there is one thing you could help me with. For the wedding, I mean.”
Sherlock reached for a stick, wishing he had a knife, but then he had an idea. Taking careful aim, and using all the force he could muster, he knocked the rat into the Snow Sand. The creature made one horrible shriek and then it vanished into the sand.
Upstairs? Watson looked around. The room was incredibly messy, clothes askew everywhere and piles of commonplace books teetered on every table.
It had gone brutally, quickly downhill from there. They couldn't work together; it was as simple as that.
Post 'Adventure of the Three Garridebs', Holmes and Watson return to Baker Street. Watson thinks he's fine. Holmes knows that he's not.
Holmes laughed, then sobered. "I am sorry I didn't tell you. I thought it would be over with quickly, and I—"
“In a lot of pain, and kind of worried,” Sally gasped out. “I’m glad you’re here now, though.”
Anderson nodded, his eyes wide. “I…you’re right. Of course. I just thought I should give her a complete answer.”
“They abused you,” Sherlock guessed.
Until then, she would be in trouble.
"Sorry," he said, and tried to move past her.
“Just two more, I think,” Mycroft replied, eyes twinkling in the fading light. Footsteps—Holmes groaned as he recognized the treads—announced the arrival of the final two wedding guests, Mrs. Hudson and Lestrade.
“Kitty’s doing well—she took Lily and Jacob shopping for Christmas presents today for their families.” Stan paused a minute. “We were thinking of dropping in later, is that alright?”
“You weren’t always. You couldn’t always.”
"Please don't."
“You already know I love him. You’ve known as long as everyone else I'm sure, way longer than I even knew, just for the record. But this…taking me to your club, drugged and bound, threatening me in person rather than a phone call…I must say, this was more than I expected. More than he expected.”
“True.” Grezzik pulled Molly’s matted hair away from her face and tried to run his fingers through it, but the knots were too thick. “But it will be alright, Molly. We are together again, and everything will be fine.”
Billy didn't bother to knock, and simply burst into the room, nearly tripping Mrs. Hudson in his haste. "Hello!"
To his credit, Moran didn’t flinch. “I understand, Princess Janine. And both messages will be related. Should there be any further reason for…royalty-to-royalty communication, send a falcon.”
All that was left was to say their vows, hands joined together.
Four days later, Mycroft came home to a letter.
“I understand.” Riley’s voice was sweet and high, not at all what Janine expected from a woman with such fierce eyes. “I can figure out when I’m beaten. Shame none of you can.”
Ireni stood before the table and bowed. “All I have is a promise for the next full moon. I’ve got something to show you at the tallest tower.”
“Yes!”
“Sherlock, dear, I know you think the body’s transport, but you do need your heart to live.”
“Well…” Lestrade hesitated. “With your brother retired, and Hopkins so busy taking over the Yard and with his two hellions—”
“As did I, John.” Sherlock pulled away, looking intently into his eyes. “John, I thought this would keep you safe.”
“So why does that matter, exactly?” Gruner asked, disappointed. “Could you claim paternity?”
Cheers,
“Sher, listen to me.” John cradled that dear face in his hands. “I love you so much. You know that. And I hate Jamiarty almost as much. But the love eclipses the hate with no question. And I want a future with you, with our family, where we can be free of his influence. If he dies, we’ll never hear the end of him.”
It stopped at last.
. He deletes the definition. Then he meets John, and suddenly that word explains everything.
“What has your brother done now?” Watson said with a sigh.
She’d been more fair than she realized—her weakness against his strength. Maria hoped he was good, hoped it would be a fight. She touched her blade to his. “You seem a decent fellow. I hate to  kill you.”
But Sherlock had decided to be sociable, and really, Sherlock rarely asked for this kind of thing. Why not go along?
Kitty kissed him, and I tapped Holmes’ arm. I knew we had no more business there.
"We'll help you," John said firmly. "I promise."
“None of this politeness would be necessary, would it?” Molly stood. “What can we do? What do we know about witches?”
"A touch of fever, I think," Holmes said quickly. "Nothing to worry about."
Greg’s ex-wife finds herself in constant financial troubles and her hairdressers keep ignoring her directions. Greg finds this quite sweet…and a little alarming.
“Rather like you and Prince John,” Janine said, a sly smile on her face.
The moment she told the other’s her suspicions, they accepted it. Immediately. “Everything you said makes sense,” Sherlock told her, a rare compliment.
"Yeah right."
The doctor's husband reached out to the woman's husband as a long scream echoed down the stairs and took his hand. "It will be over soon, and the rest will begin," he said soothingly.
you, Janine.” And Molly fell into her arms.
“I suppose I am useful—”
Holmes heard the floorboards creak and released John reluctantly as Billy came into the kitchen. “Mornin’,” he mumbled.
“There’s no time, love,” John whispered. “And you know it.” With his last ounce of defiance, he pulled the phone away from his ear and turned to Moriarty with a glare. “Can you give us a moment, please?”
"Kitty, then." Sherlock turned to John. "John, this hasn't happened in a while, and never in quite so dramatic a fashion—I had a basement flat on Montague Street, which is where I assume your information comes from?" He directed this inquiry at Kitty, who nodded. "This—playing burglar—was a way I devised to allow for people to get in touch with me, people who can't be seen coming to me."
Sherlock put his laptop aside. “What is it?”
“He told you that?”
“We’re alright, love.” John turned his head, and kissed Sherlock. “We’re alright.”
I do not apologize and will never apologize for the gratuitous fluff that follows.
Sherlock was awake before John that morning, a first in their relationship. Even before he knew his heart, he would wake to see John in the fields, or to breakfast left in his room.
“DI Lestrade.”
“I didn’t think Sherlock was the marriage type,” he admitted.
Why not make it even worse? "His brother," Greg said hesitantly.
Mummy was very surprised.
"Ah, yes. I'd forgotten for a moment."
“No point bringing this little girl into the world only to die, right?” Ireni looked at Molly. “I suppose I still owe you a boon. What would you like?”
In what felt like five minutes but was more logically twenty, John touched his face. “Dear, we ought to eat something.”
"Or you can draw us a map," Sherlock retorted. "Kitty if Gruner sees you, if anyone in that house sees you he'll know that the jig is up. He'll take Delia, kill your friends and disappear. You know there's nothing you can do, and I know that's frustrating, but you're going to have to trust us."
“Of course.” The Count was white now, pale as a ghost.
John’s smile vanished as Sherlock chuckled. “Greg, I
“I am. Not just from my own, though.”
The first steps they took in, hand in hand, were tentative and careful. The light dimmed quickly, and when Sherlock looked up he could see only tangled branches and vines. John, looking up the other way, noticed a flicker of movement, and he kept his sword ready. Even in his offhand, he hoped to be quicker than the lurking beast.
(See the end of the chapter for
John smiled. “I don’t think he really minds.”
So they had a quiet weekend with their daughter, who'd become such a wonderful, happy woman, braving her losses with dignity, and held her tight when she sobbed and swore that they needn't worry about her. With their son, who now walked in a world where gender wasn't nearly so important as your quality, but was exceedingly thankful for the men who'd accepted him when the world was different. With their grandchild, who in spiritwas partly their Mum, partly their Dad and partly them, through blood and heart, who grew up thinking that love was brilliant, even if they didn't want it.
John nodded against his shoulder. He stepped away from Sherlock, wiping his eyes. Sherlock took a step forward, encouraging him.
The man in black did. “Please pour the wine.”
"He's got them locked in his basement."
Months after that strange night, Holmes was still surprised by the change in his…well, in his John’s face. They were subtle, small and insignificant to anyone that hadn’t seen that face every day for years (Holmes swallowed his guilt about the three years he hadn’t)…but they were clear as the blue sky to him.
MwahahahahaHAHAHAHA.
But she’d never known. She’d never been able to say she was a living person’s daughter.
“Wonderful. I’ve always loved trains, myself. One of the best parts of working with Holmes.”
“You made me the same promise,” Grezzik said. He stopped rowing. “Wait. You have magic. Was it—”
“You can never do that. Her thought might change your mind.”
The old theatre loomed above them.
“When did you get here?”
The Summer Palace was as beautiful as Sally remembered. It was a low building, only one story sprawling over nearly a mile, and the stained glass almost sparkled in the dawn. Where there was stone, it was marble, polished and carved with the royal crest.
Moran held up a scroll. “Prince Jamiarty has drafted this royal announcement, that Princess Sherlock’s true love came back in the end, and the Prince let him go with blessings upon their love. He also discovered that the Princess was not kidnapped by warriors of Guilder, and that the kidnappers are all dead. He would like your approval.”
“As you wish. Sherlock, are you alright?”
Watson swallowed. “That is my worst fear,” he said quietly. “We do everything we can to keep up appearances, to give no scrap of conversation nor deed that could substantiate such a rumour. We have done so for six months, and none has questioned us.”
“The Princess?” Grezzik asked.
Cheers,
“Yes, and I thank you. You’ve been more than fair.” The man in black drew his sword in his left hand.
Holmes took his hand. “Your husband took care of mine,” he said softly. “I am happy to return the favour.”
“Well, yes, that's the idea.” Moriarty shrugged, his eyes going cold. “It's the personal touch, you see. Coming from me it would just be an act of war—this? This is an act of love, desperate, painful love! It will haunt him forever. I'm really going to enjoy watching that. Shame you won't see it.”
That is, until Mycroft, Greg and Mrs. Hudson announced their arrival by Greg falling up the stairs.
The one he’d called Bob launched himself at Anderson, but Anderson took one step forward and knocked Bob flat. The guard groaned on the ground.
“Get out of my way, infant.”
She was right, but there was nothing wrong with the document Moran extended to her. It was all legal, all binding. But Jamiarty knew how careful the Princess of Gondor and the Duke of London were about contracts. So he’d written it extra long, plenty of time for Riley to sneak from the boat into the castle behind Moran, and begin her search for the baby.
Count Magnussen shook his head. He nodded to the albino, who scuttled out of the room. He quickly returned with a book, a quill, and an inkwell, and laid them on a small table John hadn’t noticed before. The Count opened the book, flipping past some pages.
“True love!” she cried. “There is no nobler cause than that.”
“It won’t. Promise.”
Happy New Year's Eve everyone!
Wait.
“I can attest to the poison.” Sebastian Moran of all people, walked towards the steps.
“You need to head more to the left,” Molly said.
Cheers,
“Why not?”
“Yes, of course.” King Lotharon passed a hand over his face. “You can prove that Jamiarty did this, I assume? Even though my son is unpopular, there are others who will not…”
The Count dipped his quill in the ink. “The principle’s quite simple, even if it took a lifetime to perfect. It’s rather like water suction, except it sucks life. I just sucked a year of your life away. We might experiment with different amounts—maybe go as high as ten at once—but I really don’t know what that would do to you. Now, how do you feel? Be honest, this is for posterity.”
A moment later, Molly pulled away. “I’m sorry, this is your wedding day!”
They stayed there like that for quite a while, the tea forgotten.
“We are not enemies,” Grezzik said. That seemed like the most important question. Best to do them in order. “My name is Grezzik, and this is—this is Maria. And Stam.”
After dinner they relaxed on the bench and watched people walk by. Holmes kept up a steady commentary of who was walking where and why, while Watson listened attentively. After a few minutes, Holmes slowed down, unaccountably worried that he was boring Watson, but his companion nudged him impatiently. “No, go on Holmes, whose husband is that woman seeing?”
“Jamiarty doesn’t give a fuck about that sort of thing,” Sherlock muttered. His face was pale. “We shouldn’t have come here.”
“I meant no offence,” I said hastily. “I know that you are more than capable…but things might be easier if you had a story to go with your name.”
“If you wouldn’t mind.” Kitty looked desperately hopeful. “Then I know—it won’t be a stranger, and I won’t be worrying the whole time, and you could count it as a million Christmas presents—”
Sally looked at Ireni. The Woman was frowning, her tongue tracing her lips. “That doesn’t make sense.”
“John, will you keep faith and love in your heart for Sherlock?”
“Hasn’t Kitty told him yet?”
He and John were young again, for starters. John had done a rather enthusiastic cartwheel when he realized that his old wounds were gone too, even the scars faded. For his part, Sherlock's chest no longer felt tight and his hearing was as good as ever. They were also in an interesting blend of their retirement cottage and their Baker Street flat bedroom. John was keen to see if sex was easier than it had been in recent years, but Sherlock resisted, wanting to see if the rest of the flat was there.
“So for a whole year that’s how it was. ‘Goodnight Watson, good work, sleep well, I’ll most likely kill you in the morning.’ And I just kept learning how to do things; fight, fence, become stronger…it was a wonderful time, even if I was facing death.”
“Sally was born before the King remarried, but there would have been room for another child.” Max bit his lip. “I delivered all the babies at the palace, but I can’t…the King never spoke about another child. There were none who died young.”
"What on earth..." Watson turned pink. "Oh. Is there..."
It was a late night, and no one would be watching them, but the listener drew the curtains before taking the master's ringed hand, pulling him to his feet.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Hello?”
Cheers,
“Does that really matter, Holmes, if he’s got her heart?” I put a hand on his shoulder.
John thinks Sherlock's lost his mind.
Holmes swallowed the sudden lump in his throat. "He was a good man," he whispered. "We hadn't written in some years, but I always thought that he would still be there, somehow."
One day a special case came, but Michele didn’t bring it. That day, the customer came himself.
“What is that you’re ripping?” Maria called.
John had plenty of reasons to curse Moriarty—kidnapped children, really? If he had to blame them for something, that was truly the worst he could do—but he was too winded from running to lay out proper damnations. They were running roughly in the direction of Kitty Riley's flat: there, Sherlock assured him, Moriarty would be hiding under a fake name. John knew they had to get there as quickly as possible, that Sherlock's life depended on him keeping one step ahead of Moriarty, but he needed a rest.
And Sherlock, who had climbed up every flight of stairs at St. Bart's to personally inspect the corpse of his worst enemy, who had fallen in love with a man who'd killed for him twenty-four hours after they met, did.
“With your confession, we find you guilty of the charges against you.” King Lotharon stared at Sherlock and John. “Are you sure neither of you want to press additional charges?”
John raised his eyebrows as he took his plate and mug. “Where’s the other kitchen chair?”
“Oh, for—I said yes, didn’t I?”
(See the end of the chapter for
The flat door swung open, and Grandad Sherlock peeked down the stairs. "Ah, good evening, Kitty."
Molly shivered.
It wasn’t more than ten minutes later, though, that Anderson dashed in.
“He truly is.”
He woke with a start a few hours later to a kindly stewardess shaking him by the shoulder. "We've landed, sir. Do you want to wake your husband?"
“Get back, witch!”
Sherlock softened his voice. "Kitty, you've done as much as you can do, far more than anyone could have asked of you. Now you've got to hand it over, and I know that it's frustrating, but this is the best thing you can do for your friends."
“The grieving partner.”
“Of course. Well, not quite the same, and I couldn’t quite articulate each change, but…” Watson took a quick glance around the dark alley, then put his hand on Holmes’ face, cool in the growing chill. “I can see the change in you too, my dear.”
“My clever Sherlock,” John said.
“And she’ll make a wonderful mother.” Sherlock was quiet for a minute, playing with John’s fingers. “So if she has the courage—”
John and Sherlock's wedding night, and an anniversary for Holmes and Watson.
Sally’s head snapped up. Jamiarty was in the room now (where did he come from, had he been waiting?) He stood with a sword, and there was a madness in his face Sally had never seen.
Waverly squirmed in his hold, and Grezzik let her down. Yes, he’d saved Sally, and he had this precious little child to care for. Ever since her birth, he seemed to know how Waverly was feeling and what she was doing all the time. He couldn’t always help her (he’d cried for an hour when she got a fever), but he could understand her, and sometimes that was all she needed to calm down.
She didn’t know it would only be a couple of months before that promise was tested.
"Hush," John said soothingly as they began walking to the car park. "Try not to talk, love."
"Shouldn't we mark it?" Billy said at last, his voice hoarse. "So we don't accidentally dig it up?"
What about Sherlock and John and Anderson? They’ve been here since yesterday evening!”
******
, she could handle the little ones), Mama and Papa were awake too. Aunt Janine and Aunt Molly were there with Domingo and Ezik, and they grinned at Waverly when she came in. Uncle Mycroft was there too, and Waverly gave him a big kiss.
“How dare you!” Sherlock snapped, leaping to his feet.
“Sherlock,” he panted.
“He’s not going anywhere,” John promised, leaning harder on Jamiarty’s wrists. “What do you want to do with him, your Highness?”
“John”. Sherlock is still standing, his voice low and husky, his eyes piercing into John’s, begging him to understand, needing him to understand. His mind flashes back.
. God, he really had ended up being obvious after all.
Fifteen minutes, eighteen seconds. That’s the length of time before the music comes to its natural end, before Sherlock can no longer pretend he’s doing anything but stalling. Each second, Sherlock searching John’s face for signs of boredom or impatience. Each time being surprised when he finds none.
But he was also open, vulnerable, affectionate. Sherlock is allowed to gaze at him, to touch him, to smell him, to bring him back to Baker Street like the old days, like nothing has changed.
“I love you” he whispers into the darkness. I have always loved you, since that first moment. I will always love you. He startles for a moment when he notices John’s eyes flicker open before closing again, a silent acknowledgment that he’s heard. Sherlock prays he won’t remember in the morning, yet finds he doesn’t mind as much as he should if he does.
But perhaps it’s not. Maybe he really was fed up with her lies and disappearing acts, and now feels guilty for not missing her more, wishing he could go back to simpler times.
712. That’s the number of John’s heartbeats Sherlock can register in the silent cab, the snow falling outside making the experience seem almost dreamlike. He wonders for a brief moment if it is actually in his head. He’s always worried about one day getting so deep into his mind palace that he can’t differentiate between it and reality.
But then,
“Ya know, the truth is I was just jealous. Of my wife and my best friend. How cliche is that? I mean, I get why you liked her. I get why you texted her that night. She’s so much better at helping you than I ever was. I shoulda been the one who went first. I shoulda died”.
They sit in silence for 4 minutes and 19 seconds until, finally, John speaks, head still facing straight ahead, bottle still open in his hand. “Ya dint have to come”. The words are slow and slurred, more so than Sherlock has ever heard them before. At least he’s still conscious and forming thoughts. That has to be a good sign. Right? Alcohol was never really his area after all.
Still, Sherlock can’t seem to bring himself to push John away. If he’s being honest, he knows there will never be a moment where he will stop John from touching him in any capacity or in any form.
Sherlock absentmindedly realizes it has started snowing as John leans back on the bench and slides down until he almost falls off.
He hesitates another beat, tenderly resting his hand on the doorframe, capturing this moment in his mind palace where it will always remain, no matter what tomorrow brings.
It’s ironic really. In becoming this close to John Watson, he had proved himself right. Love really is a dangerous disadvantage. It had cost him his life, multiple times. It had made him uninterested in the work these last months, no longer as effective at his job. It had made him hurt in ways he never thought possible. It had almost made him return to cocaine, if not for the knowledge that John might need him again.
Ten minutes twenty three seconds. The idiotic cab driver continually ignores Sherlock’s incessant demands that expediency is vital, muttering something about slippery roads and the impending storm. The promise not to tell his wife of 20+ years about his affair with her younger sister gets him a string of curses shouted in French, but also finally increases the speed slightly. Finally, he can see a shape in the distance, and he’s out of the car before it even comes to a complete stop, a wad of bills thrown in the driver’s general direction.
18:37. His phone pings and he grabs at it, hoping it is John saying he is on his way. Instead it is Mycroft, no text, just a picture of a man sitting on the bench near the Thames. He expands the picture and looks closer, realizing with a start the man is John. And that he is holding a whiskey bottle. Only a few sips missing though, this isn’t necessarily not good, maybe John had just wanted to clear his head with some fresh air. Never mind that a blizzard is expected to hit later that night. He deserved a drink after all he had been through.
He remembers his mother talking about this piece when he was younger. It was her favorite; one her and Mr. Holmes had slow danced to on their third date. She always had a wistful tone when she spoke of it, saying it was the sound of love beginning, the notes innocent and plaintive. He used to scoff, brushing her off as a hopeless romantic, but now he finds the notes are perfect.
Now, however, Sherlock is pacing the floor of 221B. Mrs. Hudson had tried to interrupt with food or something equally tedious, but a well flung tea cup into the door frame above her head had sent her scurrying. Mycroft had called earlier in the day, reminding him that tonight was a danger night for John, the anniversary of when John had met Mary. “Sentiment”, he had explained dryly to Sherlock, but for once, Sherlock understood. Mary was the only person John had ever truly loved, the person who was supposed to be different, the person who was supposed to help him get over his trust issues. If Sherlock ever stooped to something as pedestrian as marriage (not likely), he knew that he would hate it if the person had betrayed his trust.
Fourteen thousand eight hundred and seventy two. That’s the number of minutes it’s been since Sherlock last saw John smile. Two hundred and forty eight hours. Over 10 days.
All too soon they arrive and Sherlock manages to wake John up enough to half drag him through the door. As they ascend the first few steps, his mind is immediately pulled back to John’s stag night, into what now seems like a different lifetime. He barely remembers what they talked about, something about “international reputations” and “Hudders”, but he remembers laughing. He remembers feeling safe, accepted, comfortable. He had pretended to have had a horrible time the next morning for John’s sake, but in reality it was the happiest he’d ever been. Even more surprising, given that he wasn’t thinking about work at all. Who could have guessed that after all those years surrounding himself with more and more cases in an attempt to challenge himself, all he really needed was one night of having a certain, stout army doctor all to himself again, one night of seeing him laugh, of watching him let at least one of the walls that he do determinedly surrounded himself with down?
All of these various thoughts filter through Sherlock’s brain in a matter of seconds, and before long, maybe realizing Sherlock is simply sitting there immobilized, maybe finally realizing who he’s kissing, more likely feeling dizzy and sick as the alcohol continues to take affect, John slowly pulls back and sits up. Sherlock braces himself for the look of disgust in John’s eyes, for perhaps a slurred apology or some other indication of regret, but it doesn’t come.
He racks his brain, wishing he could just take on John’s pain instead. He would gladly throw himself in the river if it meant John got a chance at happiness. At normal.
At least before he knew what he was missing, he could pretend, try to make himself believe that friendship was enough, that physical contact, while fulfilling for ordinary people, would just be a useless distraction from his work. That feeling John, kissing John would be no different than his other encounters, and ultimately unsatisfying.
Sherlock took advantage of anything John found funny these past few months.
. Or this is definitely, totally, completely not good. Not yet anyway. It is just
He thinks about all the times John has surprised him, astounded him, He remembers what he had started to say the time John had last heard The Woman’s text, before he was interrupted by John’s vision of Mary. All these years. All the looks, all the selfless acts, all the brief touches, haven’t been enough. It is time to finally say it out loud.
So he still continues.
As torturous as it was to give that speech knowing he could never say what he really felt, the one small mercy was that he never had to hear John say those words to Mary either. Still, he must have when they were alone.
Now, he would give anything, would leave Mycroft to deal with Moriarty on his own, if it meant that John would stay.
So he really does despise her. That’s new information. Perhaps it is still him dealing with his grief.
Sherlock’s sudden inability to breathe has nothing to do with the rapidly dropping temperature. Mercifully, John continues before Sherlock is forced to figure out what in the
But then John looks down at his bottle as if he’s forgotten about it and Sherlock is tired of sitting there doing nothing. Tired of not being able to help. He may not be able to make everything ok again, but he sure as hell can save John’s life tonight. And tomorrow night. And every night after that for as long as John will tolerate him.
“Me too.”
“So… did you mean what you said last night?”
Sherlock settles on an original composition he’s been working on. Based on John. Obviously. What else? Everything he’s too much of a coward to say out loud. It begins slow, mimicking his own hesitation and trepidation at letting this ridiculous army doctor intrude upon his life and get closer to him than anyone ever has. Soon, it begins to build up speed, the notes reminiscent of all their chases through the streets of London, creschenos building as John saves his life, as the criminal is apprehended, as adrenaline takes hold. Again. And again.
He knows he could easily get addicted to finding all the things. Chase the high of discovering the many noises John Watson makes forever without getting bored.
He can’t delete anything when it comes to John.
John licks his lip deliberately, grinning when Sherlock reluctantly tears his eyes away to follow the movement. They both lean forward at the same second, and then their eyes are closed as their lips connect and they both sigh.
As his notes are dying down, he decides on a whim to continue by playing Handel’s Ombra Mai Fù. John unaware of the transition, still concentrating his attention completely on Sherlock’s face, his hands. An expression of awe and amazement on his face, as if Sherlock is explaining the mysteries of the universe, rather than plucking at some strings.
But also not nearly enough.
Sherlock just hoped John was not an idiot. At least not about this, at least not tonight. He had tried to show John over and over how valuable he was to him, asking for his input on cases, even commenting on that ridiculous blog. Tonight, he had made sure to specifically ask for his help, certain that he wouldn't be able to refuse. But he hasn't heard a word from him, not even an "I'm busy".
He turns for the first time and clumsily places his hand on Sherlock’s shoulder. “I’m so sorry about that by the way. Blaming you. It’s not your fault. It’s my fault. You were right. I chose her. It’s always my fault.” He makes a feeble attempt to laugh again, but by now the situation is distinctly not humorous and it turns into a coughing fit instead. Finally, he just sighs and leans forward, haphazardly running his foot along the ground, seemingly trying to conjure up enough courage for what he’s about to say.
It still hasn’t, he reasons with himself, hard as it is to form rational thoughts while Johns body is pressed so close, his hand on his neck, his tongue continuing to explore, his lips softly forming whispers of groans that reverberate throughout Sherlock’s entire body and make his hair stand on end. The only reason this is happening is because John is lonely, depressed, and drunk out of his mind. He simply wants human contact, and Sherlock is relatively that. Also the only body available at the moment. John probably won’t even remember in the morning.
As he goes to leave, he turns at the door and is stopped in his tracks at the image of John, lying on his back, one arm draped lazily over his forehead, lips slightly parted, eyes closed. Comfortable. Warm. Safe.
Does he really believe Sherlock is amazing?
Suddenly, the words he left unspoken are too much, and have been for far too long.
Sherlock is positive John has nothing on his schedule, and even if he did, he always cancels his plans for the promise of a case.
John settles back and crosses his legs. He still seems a bit on edge, as if he’s contemplating saying something else. Instead, he softly smiles again, this time meeting Sherlock’s eyes and Sherlock almost stumbles backward. He’s missed that look so much. How could he possibly have taken it for granted? So full of warmth and trust and admiration, a look that unequivocally says there’s no place in the world he’d rather be. With Sherlock, of all people.
Sherlock sits down in his chair. Sits down in John’s chair, breathing in the faint scent that still remains. Goes into his mind palace to remember all the conversations that took place here, back when John was still calling him an idiot, still sitting here daily, cancelling dates to go on cases. With him. Lies down on the couch. Folds his hands. Checks for cigarettes. Curses Mrs. Hudson for finding his hidden stash. Curses himself because his other hidden stash is in the bedroom. Goes and stands by his door, checking to make sure John isn’t thrashing about or experiencing a nightmare. Stays there much longer than necessary trying to make out John’s breathing pattern. Almost opens the door, just for a glance, but he’s only 74 percent confident John is actually asleep and doesn’t want to risk it. Walks to the kitchen. Attempts to work on an experiment but gives up after eight seconds. Walks back to his chair. Takes out his violin and strokes it absentmindedly. Contemplates playing. Doesn’t want to wake John. Does want to wake John. Argues with himself. Compromises by simply making the motions of playing above the strings, barely ghosting over them. Silent, yet still calming. He’s able to stay in one place for the first time in the last two hours.
Sherlock would know.
“That’d be nice, thanks. Whatever you like is fine.” John shuffles to his chair as if he never left it, still in the jeans from last night, his shirt unbuttoned to expose a white undershirt below. If Sherlock focuses, he can make out his chest underneath it. If he lowers his eyes he can barely make out his nipples peeking through the thin fabric. Lower still and he can make out the bulge in John’s trousers, imagine stepping close enough to press his thigh to it. Feel John gasp underneath him for real. Do all the things he wasn’t able to last night.
John is a romantic too, after all.
But that’s what John had wanted. Wanted her. Wasn’t it?
There it is.
The thought sends an unexpected tingle up his spine. That such a small action can cause such an effect because he did it. His John. Always the soldier. Always in charge. Always composed. Now losing his ability to think clearly all because of him of all people.
He looks down at the floor and smiles, and when he looks back up, Sherlock almost shatters. He knows Sherlock, and is still here. Standing in the kitchen at 221B. Still in awe. Still open with his declarations of praise.
It certainly can’t make it any worse. And it’s keeping John back in his chair.
Then, suddenly, John’s other hand slips lower and it’s him holding onto Sherlock as Sherlock almost bucks off the table.
But now. Not only does he think he would not mind, he almost craves it.
Sherlock slowly circles his thumb on the back of John’s hand as he continues to sleep. Does he really wish he could go back to not caring? He genuinely doesn’t know. He does wish that this moment could last forever.
He pulls John into the seat next to him, hoping that he won’t be sick on the ride home, but he is mercifully asleep even before the door is closed.
For a brief millisecond, Sherlock is concerned that he did something wrong, but John’s closed eyes, elevated pulse, and ragged breathing soon lead to the obvious deduction that he’s simply trying to get himself under control.
308 minutes, 22 seconds. That’s how long John has been asleep, not counting the one time he wandered out to use the toilet. Though to be fair, Sherlock was 82 percent certain he wasn’t awake for that either.
Come back home. Sherlock thinks, his eyes roaming John’s face in an attempt to read him, but his gaze remains fixed on the carpet. Move back in, and I’ll play you whatever song you like, as often as you like. I’ll compose whole sonnets just for you. I’ll never stop playing. My fingers can fall off, and I’ll learn to play with my teeth.
Funny, when he decided not to tell John he was alive after jumping, all he could think of was not jeopardizing his plan, that nothing was more important than taking down Moriarty’s network. He never could have conceived that John would actually greive. Certainly never imagined that he would so easily find someone else to commit his life too, given his prior history with relationships up until then. Didn’t realize it would bother him so much that he did.
But he picks option number 88. And doesn’t turn.
He gets what all Jon’s girlfriends were on about. He wishes it had been him instead all those years.
A few more minutes pass in silence. Finally, John turns his head and speaks again.
John stands and walks over to the kitchen. “No, don’t trouble yourself. I’m fine. Really, God knows you’ve done enough already-”
“That seems to be the only suitable course of action, yes”.
“Well in that case, I say we move things to the bedroom then.” John’s voice, low and gravely against his ear is so delicious that it takes Sherlock a second to process the words.
He hates himself for it. His inability to utilize basic human emotions. But he’s afraid that if he looks at John now, sleepy and tousled, still a little unsteady from last night, lips chapped, the same lips that were on Sherlock’s not ten hours ago, Sherlock’s eyes will betray him and John will just know. Assuming he doesn’t already, that he doesn’t remember Sherlock’s words as he closed the door.
All too soon, though, he reaches the end of the unfinished piece, and, though John doesn’t appear to have noticed, he’s struggling to decide what comes next. It’s impossible when his fragile relationship hangs in the balance. He doesn’t want to play anything dark and stormy, nor detached and uninteresting, though that’s what their relationship has been the past few months. Especially if this is the end. Perhaps it will remain unfinished forever, all the endings that could have been continually unwritten, mocking him.
Ok, then. He doesn’t actually want to take his life. Not yet anyway. He just wants to forget.
one is supposed to say to that.
He checks his phone for the fifth time, making sure his message went through. “Come at once”. Sent at 16:34. It was now 18:02. He knows John has been off work for four hours, and he desperately wants to make sure he is ok, but he doesn’t want to just show up at his house uninvited. That’s not what people do. Is it? He doesn’t know anything anymore when it comes to John. He doesn’t know how to make him happy, He doesn’t even know what he’d say, if he’d even be welcome. Maybe John has someone over, maybe he’s finally starting to move on with someone else after Mary.
For a brief second, he allows himself the indulgence of pretending that it is real. That John is sober and by some miracle still wants him anyway. That they’re on a proper date and this is just a prelude of what’s to come when they get home. That afterward they’ll fall asleep in the same bed and John will make him breakfast and laugh, finally, in a way that reaches his eyes, and sit in his chair again, and write his blog in his ridiculous hunched-over, two-fingered typing way, and...
Sherlock eventually reaches a part of the piece he’s still working on. It’s slower, relaxed, almost romantic. He’s nervous, afraid John won’t like it, afraid that somehow John will guess the hidden meaning. Even though that’s ridiculous; John is an idiot when it comes to all things musical.
He takes a breath as he once again returns to his seat on the bench, John still searching his eyes for an answer. “John. You are doing yourself a disservice. I have known many people in this world but made few friends, and I can safely say that you are the only one with whom I would ever want to spend an extended period of time, much less with whom I could ever live. You’re a skilled marksman, a phenomenal doctor, and an even better friend. Far from making my life worse, you have made it infinitely better and I am forever indebted to you for saving my life again and again. Mary wasn't your fault, she was mine. I’m sorry I wasn't there when you needed me before, and I will do everything possible to rectify such an error. So I will be here as many times as you need me, for as long as you will let me. From now on. You are my…”. He pauses awkwardly. Why is this so hard to say? He’s a grown man for Christ’s sake. Surely it’s obvious by now anyway, but still somehow has never been uttered aloud. He takes a steadying breath and tries again. “You are my best friend.”
John never said anything, but it was obvious that he needed the distraction, that the moments when his life was in jeopardy, when the adrenaline kicked in, were the only times he was able to stop thinking and to forget, even just for a moment. He also liked knowing that he was still needed, and Sherlock liked needing him, more than he admitted to himself.
He snaps back to reality with a blink, John’s tongue still sloppily pushing against his. No need to get carried away. It’s just pathetic and can only possibly lead to disappointment.
John didn’t want better. Did he?
Upon consideration he realizes that that’s probably a bit not good, given the fact that John has had one of the worst nights of his life and is currently almost unconscious.
“God, Sherlock. You’ve put your life on hold for me and I’ve been nothing but an arse to you in return. I don’t deserve it, which makes you even more amazing. Why can’t you see that?”
But to think that Sherlock would rather have Mary than John in his life is so absurd he can’t even process words to form in response. John hasn’t actually been thinking that this whole time, has he? He hasn’t really been believing that he should have been the one to end up with a bullet? If anyone should have died that day it is obviously Sherlock.
Headache? Oh. Of course. He must have quite the hangover, and all the violin music can’t have helped. Sherlock snaps into action. God, he’s such an idiot. He quickly places his violin back in its case and rushes over to the kitchen table, rummaging among his latest experiment that’s strewn about. “I know I have phosphoric acid and acetic anhydride here somewhere, we can mix it with some water and ethanol and it might not be quite the same as an aspirin, but it should help that headache some. I wish I had salicylic acid, maybe in the drawer by the sink…?”
"People such as?"
Holmes’ brow was furrowed, eyes still full of anxiety.
He didn’t speak again, and John, exhausted, was willing to close his eyes again, and just breathe in air that wasn’t dank and musty and awful.
He didn’t stop until they crashed into the shore.
“Watch her,” he told Molly, and then he didn’t speak again, just kept climbing.
“I don’t think I can…really process talk,” John admitted, surprised by how tired he suddenly felt. “Just…this is nice.”
“Most of the countries we sent word to have recognized Sally becoming the Heir,” Stam answered.
“What?”
“I did ask them,” Kitty said. “Molly said she always wanted a wedding and a good man, and she couldn’t see why she shouldn’t have both and still be a feminist, Mike said he wanted to make Molly happy, Uncle Greg said it was to spite some of the people in Uncle Mycroft’s office, and Uncle Mycroft said it was because he wanted Uncle Greg to be officially family.”
Okay, either most of you know the original source, or I'm as bad at hiding who the man in black is as William Goldman. Which is it?
"No, being a burglar."
“So…we kill the executioner?”
"I think I'd better go now," David said gently. "If you've got any questions, don't hesitate to ring, my number's in your phones. I reckon you four want to get on with things." He walked to the door, then turned, a mischievous glint in his eyes. "Oh, and one other thing; Sherlock, John, you might appreciate this more than the other two, but...there's no need for lube."
So why tonight?
Sherlock, Stam and Sally were all staring at Anderson.
“He is. He’s disowned me. Punishing him will only make you suffer his loss.”
"She isn't cross at all!" Billy called up the stairs.
“Very well. You may have the child back. If you can catch her.”
And Grezzik, who had never been paid for his brains, who wasn’t supposed to think, didn’t. He just dove after Waverly.
Sherlock craned his neck. The man in black’s ship was now at the base, but the man wasn’t in it. To Sherlock’s shock, the man was…
“That isn’t what you said two days ago, your Highness.” With one quick movement Cerise ripped off her bandages. The crowd gasped—there were deep cuts up and down the woman’s arms. Some were still bleeding. “When you were cutting me, trying to make me tell you who carried Sally, you told me I was just above my daughter. That you’d taken her from her beautiful grave and stuffed her into a pit.
“We’ll let you know by Christmas,” John promised.
That shocked Watson. "You've never...not ever? Not even with a woman?"
Now I want to give everyone a heads up for next week. It's going to be a two-parter and the first part...well, I'll update the tags to reflect this, but there's going to be major character death. It's worth it, I promise you all it's worth it for part two, but this is just a heads up in advance that sad is coming, and you might want to skip that chapter and go straight to part two when it goes up on Thursday, or skip that week entirely, it's up to you.
What, you didn't think I'd keep them apart for long, did you?
He’d never known how wonderful that could feel.
John struggled, but he didn't really want Sherlock to let go anyways and he didn't want to crush his own hopes with movement.
Kitty shuddered. "The only thing that can break Bertie Gruner's spell. It's his...lust memoir, I suppose. It's fucking frightening. It's got all these pictures of all of his 'flowers', little notes about them...even records of how long it took him to break them."
John was breathing hard. Anderson looked terrified.
Then again, he'd been doing that a lot lately.
Billy leaned his forehead against the table. “Not before breakfast,” he pleaded.
“And you, Sherlock.” Mycroft examined the cottage. “It’s a lovely home.”
As the room echoed the chant, and the banner man from Nepce removed her headdress , Molly turned puzzled eyes to Janine. Her lover winked, and tapped her tiara.
Kitty was grateful for the simple, clear wills of her fathers. The cottage was theirs, as were all their possessions, except for two. And there would be two, simple burials.
Twenty years after Watson returned from the war, Holmes finds William Murray, the orderly who saved his life. Murray brings his son with him, named for the bravest and finest doctor he’s ever known. John Murray doesn’t understand why the Doctor cries.
Sally glanced at Molly, who had gone very still, hardly breathing.
“So do I. Don't worry, it will be.”
Jamiarty glanced at the Count, who left the chapel with four other warriors, Anderson among them. “Please, Bishop, can’t we skip to the end?” Then he took Sherlock’s hand and kissed it. “I must wed my beloved. Since his own is dead.”
“I think you’re bluffing.” Jamiarty had faltered though; he’d taken a half-step back.
Molly drew in a breath. “And it doesn’t just lead to Guilder.”
“Man and husband,” the bishop finished.
“Sher? Dear, it’s alright.”
They made their way carefully down the path to the Brutes’ headquarters.
They climbed on and on, and the distance started to close between the four of them and the strange, silent man in black. Sherlock closed his eyes. He wasn’t sure who he wanted to win. He definitely didn’t want to fall.
Grezzik went to the ornate chest in front of an altar to the Powers, and pulled out an enormous bundle of robes. For the first time Sally felt doubt. Could she wear all of those? Could they even put them all on in time? And the other burdens—her dead mother, her murdered half-sister. She shouldn’t even be here to do this.
“Forgive me,” Watson said automatically. “I did not intend to be here.” Then it hit him. “Sherlock?”
John just shook his head. "Not everything matters, Greg," he quoted. "But Stan's name matters to notice."
“That’s not true.” Stam had kept this secret since the escape, and it was hard to admit it now. “I—I thought a hundred times about trying to save you. You haven’t always been a bad man, cousin. Away from Jamiarty’s influence, I thought you could be saved. But every time I thought about it, something stopped me. I knew you…well, I didn’t know you anymore. I didn’t think it would work.” He stepped away from the cell. “My hands aren’t clean either, cousin. But my loyalty to my prince pales before my loyalty to my country.”
Grandfather Sherlock shook his head. “Billy, lad, I swear you’ve gotten twice as tall. You haven’t eaten your sister, have you?” He threw a purse to the driver, who tipped his cap under the waterproof drape.
Holmes smiled, laying down his bag. "Happy Christmas, my dear John," he whispered, kneeling next to the sofa. "I'm home."
“EVERYBODY MOVE!” Grezzik yelled.
Sebastian looked over at Riley’s cell. “Is that true, Riley?
Maria shivered. There was no remorse in his cold eyes. And yet she wasn’t afraid of him.
“I’d better leave too,” Kitty said, quickly brushing a kiss to my cheek. “I need to return in time for supper, or Mrs. Turner will have my head.”
“How far is it to London?” John asked. He was suddenly quite tired.
Grezzik was silent for a minute. “My arms,” he said quietly. “They’ve never failed me.”
John and Sherlock are home from their honeymoon, Greg is happy and some wires get crossed.
“Why is he coming?!”
“Prince Jamiarty would like to propose a two-year renewal of the treaty, rather than a one-year.”
Sherlock wrapped an arm around John's waist. "Oh my dear John, of course I do. Isn't this one of the fun parts of being a parent?"
Sherlock held him tightly. Leaning down, he sang along.
Mycroft Holmes looked Watson straight in the eye. “I believe you know, Doctor.”
“You’re a rotten liar.”
When he got to the bottom, he laid only a few feet from John. And it
He closed his eyes and leaned back.
“He may survive the fall,” Count Magnussen comforted him.
“I want to rescue the Carriers,” Anderson said. “Any chance you’d help me out with that?”
“Why?”
“You mock my pain!”
“Is that them?” he whispered to Molly.
Maria waved away his concerns. “M’fine,” she slurred.
“Ireni. Have you come to kill me now?”
“Tell me.”
“Shut your face,” Stam snapped.
“Surely things cannot be easy for a single woman in this city?” I asked.
John returned a few of his kisses, but he didn’t move his hands.
Stan blushed. "Well that might be...exactly what happened. We didn't mean to!"
Now Greg wasn't a morose person by any means, and he was certainly friends with Sherlock and John, so it made sense that he'd be pleased. Still, there was something a bit...odd about it. If his subordinates were pressed to describe his attitude towards the newlyweds, the cleverer ones would use the term 'lovingly exasperated'. He certainly wouldn't be playing Vivaldi (quietly, of course, but with his office door cracked you could just hear it) just because they were coming home.
Grezzik laid the man in black on the miracle man’s table. Miracle Max poked his chest a few times, and bent his head and listened.
Now Sally thought about that. It wasn’t entirely unusual, but the Carrier generally—well, carried the royal partner’s child. Even though the Carrier line reached back to a royal by-blow, there hadn’t been too much need for them. In twelve generations, there’d been two children from the Carrier line: a prince given to two queens, and a princess born to two kings. Sally’s child by Sherlock would have been the third. It was a bit close, but it wouldn’t be the end of the line in terms of incestual risk.
Sherlock rolled his eyes. "I'm not infallible, love. I'll think about it."
“She saved my life as well,” Grezzik mumbled. “Riley…well…”
“Adjust her bonds,” Janine directed the guards. She felt ill. They all knew what Jamiarty was capable of doing to adults, but murdering a seven year old? When he himself was only ten?
John slid to the edge of the bed, sword at the ready as he rose to his feet. “Or maybe I don’t, after all. Drop. Your. Sword.”
Moran shrugged.
"I love you, Sherlock dear."
“Move?” Sherlock said in a daze. Trembling, he reached his hands up, put them on John’s shoulders. They were solid, real, his hands didn’t go through them as they often did. “You’re alive. If you want I can fly.”
Sherlock took her to find lodgings shortly after, acting in ‘his goddaughter’s’ interests. I thought that was inspired, on his part—should she begin to call him Uncle Sherlock (should we ever tell her the truth of our relationship), none will be the wiser.
“A book?”
“I’m not
Sally looked at her father. “I think Stam should bring him to the dungeon, Father. He can stay there until we can hold a trial.”
“What about Molly?” Janine snapped.
"..."
“Don’t let John go in swimming!” Martha called. “Have fun storming the castle!”
...Look, it's still Christmas Eve where I am. For like an hour.
"It looks like you two were snogging and knocked the tea cup over," John offered.
"Trying to get some information out of his contacts, see if he can find any weaknesses with Gruner. If at all possible we want to do this without violence—Gruner's powerful, and any little slip could cause a lot of trouble for far too many people."
“Give us the gate key,” John ordered.
Rachel smiled hugely, showing off the gap in her front teeth.
“Do you want them?”
“Thank you,” Grezzik said. “I’m sure Sally and Anderson will thank you too.”
Then the man in black cut under her Agrippa, and Maria started. She’d worked hard on that defense. She backed away, switching techniques, but the man in black’s dancing blades kept finding weaknesses, kept pushing her backwards. Backwards towards the Cliff’s edge.
Watson imagined living alone again, as he had briefly after Afghanistan, and then again when Mary died. He imagined only practicing medicine, seeing Holmes perhaps once or twice a month. He shuddered.
“He has no strength,” Molly explained. “His healing will take longer.”
Billy turned around. He was getting hungry.
“She’s not hungry yet,” Grezzik answered. “Don’t fret, Sally.” He patted her foot.
That’s why he was genuinely sympathetic when the lords were all in. “Do you want me to explain, Ri?” he asked. “I know this isn’t easy for you.”
So Sebastian Moran is going to help...what can he provide?
When Molly Hooper was thirty-eight she got the surprise of her life from Sherlock Holmes, who offered her congratulations. Eight months later John Watson delivered her twins at St. Bart’s during a hostage situation. Molly named her daughter Lily after Mike’s sister, and named her son Jacob.
Stan’s eyes went wide. “Did you just—Da, did you just forget?”
Cheers, Acme
Cheers,
“I killed him myself. You can see the body later if you like.”
What the Prince’s signal meant was simple. It was ‘obviously we’re not going to do what I just said’.
And then he was gone, gone in a swirl of fiery haze as
“I have a garden,” Mycroft replied. “I grow it there; the soil here is excellent for it. You may have some to take home, if you like.”
“It is far from the royal chambers,” Mycroft admitted. “I don’t know if everyone would be particularly happy about it, but so long as there is one human witness it will be true before the Powers.”
Cheers,
“S’alright.”
Molly helped Sally brace against her, and winced as Sally gripped her arms.
But she made it around the throne, ignoring Jamiarty’s shouts, one foot in front of the other. Her shoulders were bowed with the weight, but her head was held high.
"Won't people think it's sort of odd, this carriage coming in?" Molly asked.
“I can’t imagine that sort of situation arising,” Ireni said lightly. Though she felt a pang. It might be nice to spend time with a child. They always said such fascinating things, and she could guide them to whatever they wanted to do. If she didn’t know how to do something, she would learn.
But he was swooping up, and up, and he still felt warm, and he could feel Waverly in his arms. Had she died too?
I recommend listening to Great Big Sea's 'Ordinary Day' while reading, I did while writing :)
"Shame," Sherlock said. "He would have made a lovely dancer."
But Sherlock shook his head. “No presumption of innocence for those accused of high treason,” he murmured back. “And anyone who helps them, joins them. No one will risk doing it, for fear of the Traitor’s Fate.”
If John was writing the story of their honeymoon (which he was never, never, never going to do, not in any level of detail, no matter how much people had been asking) he would have drawn a blank over the next hour of customs, luggage collecting, taxi finding, and to-the-hotel-travelling. It was bad enough for him to experience it once. At least he wasn't so tired now.
“Where’s John?” she asked as she started crushing herbs.
to see you, little brother.”
Sherlock took Rachel very carefully from John, holding her in front of him, supporting her head carefully. “Hello Rachel,” he said. “You won’t remember this, but I’m your other grandfather. It’s very…very nice to meet you.” He cradled her against his chest, closing his eyes.
“It’s ten to one, Greg,” John said, trying hard not to burst out laughing.
Sherlock's phone buzzed again, and he pulled the phone away from his ear, and looked at the text message.
I, ___, take you,____ , to be the [wife/husband] of my days,
“I suppose I could help you,” Maria offered. “We’ve got some leftover rope here, but I don’t think you’d want my help. I’m only waiting around to kill you.”
Mycroft slammed his hand on the table, and Grezzik jumped. “Of course it’s wrong! What about saving yourself, Grezzik?”
"I don't want you to go."
"Really? How is that?" Against his will (he was a grown man and could look after himself, thank you very much) John started looking around for Sherlock. He was standing near the far wall, talking to Greg. He wouldn’t be able to hear John from that distance without attracting attention.
“Thank you,” Maria panted, and she ran again, down a flight of stairs…
She was a Princess.
“That Jamiarty doesn’t know that Sally is his sister.”
Now the woman was in front of him. “
The next chapter will be in modern times, before all of this.
Hopkins let out a cry of joy, leapt up, danced about the room, then hugged Holmes and Watson in quick succession. "Healthy! The baby's healthy! Kitty?" he asked, suddenly anxious.
Then the song changed into a lilting, waltzing melody after a dinner and chase of a criminal, played by a man fairly giddy with joy and a sense of pure rightness, that for once he belonged with someone. Someone so remarkable as his flatmate, the best man he'd ever known.
"Right," he said, "I'm going to look for Bradstreet."
They didn’t talk during the short ride, still hand in hand. Sherlock wasn’t even looking out the window, trying to deduce anything. He was looking at John, and John felt a strange kind of lump in his throat. He couldn’t see Sherlock’s face all that well, but the brief flashes of streetlight gave him a hint, a glance at the kind of love he’d been so lucky to find. To have.
John allowed Sherlock to lead him into the house, heart pounding. For the first time in a long time he didn’t want to know what Sherlock was hiding. Or rather he did, but didn’t want to be wrong.
“And...what? Say that again? We want this to happen?” John glanced between the brothers. “Funny, because I don't want that. Did 'we' discuss this when I was at work?” He was trying to keep his tone light and failing miserably, because Mycroft looked sympathetic now and Sherlock wasn't meeting his eyes and dear God something was wrong, something was horribly wrong...
Molly swore, and dashed after the old woman.
The man in black took the two cups and the bag of iocane. He turned his back carefully, and was busy for a few minutes.
It was strange—it wasn't as though either he or Sherlock were virgins, and they'd made love plenty of times before getting married. Why would this night be any different? Other than John potentially falling asleep in the middle, that is.
“Alissa, wake up!”
When Princess Sherlock regained consciousness, it was nightfall. “Where are you taking me?”
It didn’t help at all, but he needed some kind of argument to face Holmes.
Prince Jamiarty closed his eyes.
Holmes' eyes lit up. "That will be interesting." He paused. "I don't suppose...but no..."
“Sorry we startled you,” the shorter (was it he who spoke?) said. “We’re not looking for any trouble."
“Mycroft,” Watson said. His tongue felt too large for his mouth. “He took us to international waters.” He pulled on the chain around his neck. “Here.”
Riley didn’t speak, but her face was turning pale.
“I love you,” Sherlock said at last. “And sometimes I’m worried—I’m worried that it’s just the dream. That it was all that made you care.”
“Ireni?” Philip looked at John. “Didn’t you…”
John glared at Sherlock. “You guessed.”
Mycroft Holmes leaned back in his chair. “And that is good, but can you do this forever? You and Sherlock are both still fairly young, and despite your line of work you could easily live another twenty years. Can you pretend for that long that there is nothing between you?”
“Not all of it,” Sherlock admitted, feeling a little uncomfortable. Since when was he the open one of the two of them? “Just the parts that I think will interest you.”
“Max!” Martha tapped his arm. “Be polite.”
“Duke Mycroft, you have been an admirable ruler, and a formidable adversary for Jamiarty. You’ve essentially stolen this duchy from under him. But you must understand that there are people here in London who are still loyal to the Crown. Still loyal, therefore, to Jamiarty. And those people make excellent spies, especially when they’re within the palace.”
“Time to go,” Miracle Max said. He watched as Grezzik picked up John, and looked at Stam. “Is your boat down at the old dock?”
When Sherlock heard the news he went into his room and shut the door. It was deadly quiet behind that door for three long days. His parents were terrified when he finally came out. His cheekbones were sharp in his pale face, his hair was cut short and had turned fully black, and his body was stiff and hard. And his eyes, which had always caught the light, had become light themselves; piercing, merciless, and cold.
Watson rolled his eyes, relieved. “He didn’t think to pass that on to me.”
“I knew he was bluffing!” Jamiarty exclaimed.
"Yeah, Kitty and Sher found me not too long afterwards," John answered. He looked awestruck.
John undressed and coaxed Sherlock into the shower with him. There was nothing to do with sex—hell, it was nothing to do with intimacy in some ways. It was about making sure that Sherlock felt safe, and having John that close was the best way to do that.
“Sherlock, everything’s going to be alright.” John spoke as gently as possible, keeping his grip steady around Sherlock’s pale hands. “If there’s a hound, we can kill it. I’m a pretty decent shot—”
“Are you loyal to Prince Jamiarty?”
“I think we might have some other things to do,” Anderson said. He looked thoughtful. “You know, the executioner didn’t put up a lot of resistance. She actually let me put her to sleep. She doesn’t like Jamiarty either. And she might not be alone.”
Holmes spotted his brother the moment they reached the docks—a person of Mycroft’s stature tended to draw attention. Here, in a suit far better suited to Parliament than holiday making, he stuck out even more so than usual.
“But if the child already had people who loved them, and you just took care of them, taught them…?”
“I swear it will be done,” Prince Jamiarty said. He gestured to Sherlock. “I apologize, my love. I thought he was your captor. But of course, he is free to go. Thank you, sailor, for saving my precious darling.”
Count Magnussen rode closer to John, who stood watching as Prince Jamiarty and Sherlock—as his whole world—rode away.
John glared at his partner. “You were asleep when I got up,” he protested feebly.
Waverly is gone, and her family races to save her.
When Kitty received an email—written months before, programmed to be sent only if no one was there to stop it—she knew.
“I accept.”
Princess Janine stepped forward and took Molly’s hand. “Well, Molly, you have your name again. Does that mean you have your justice?”
“I should have noticed you sooner. Can’t I go with you?”
Molly had other ideas.
“When you say small—”
“Don’t lie to me…”
Prince Jamiarty was the world’s greatest hunter. No one dared disagree.
Grandfather John smiled. He swung their intertwined hands over Billy’s head so he was perched between them. “Sherlock, I think the lad wants to hear our story. And I think he might just deserve to hear the whole thing.”
Watson took his hand in his, stroking the long fingers tenderly. “I…yes,  I think that would be lovely. I will be your husband, and I don’t care if only we know it.”
John Watson Holmes never backed down from a dare.
Sherlock rolled his eyes—marriage apparently hadn’t softened his attitude towards stupid questions. Without even knocking, he drew a card from his pocket and swiped it. The door swung open.
They sat down and Angelo handed them their menus before going off to fetch their usual candle.
“He’s the only family I have left, Max.”
“Do you know where he took them?” Sherlock asked.
“You’re not a bad mother, Sally.” Max held up his hand. “I’ve seen you. Every time someone has to carry Waverly instead of you, every time she drinks milk that isn’t yours, every time Grezzik solves a problem you didn’t even know was there…I see it. You hate it.”
The Count didn’t strike her. A cruel smile was twisting his lips.
And with that, Stam slipped out of the room. The others would get along fine without him; after all, he’d never left Florin in his life.
“Thank you.” The relief in Sally's voice was immense. “I'll see you soon.”
“But this is not the only way to promise!” Kitty slammed the cup down. “I’ve already promised him everything I can give, I shouldn’t need a dress and a ring and flowers to show that!”
“Good man,” Maria said shortly. “Now come, we’ve no time to waste.”
And when they joined Mycroft at his table that evening, they both wore their new cufflinks, Holmes' set engraved with J.W., Watson's engraved S.H. It was an entirely suitable exchange of jewelry for two old friends.
“Yes.”
“What were you going to do with her?”
“We still have some questions to answer,” Molly said. “Once we’re inside, how do I find the Count? And how do you find the Princess? And once that’s done, how do we get out and to Stam’s boat?”
Mrs. Hudson nodded and left the room. Watson counted her steps in a haze. He didn’t quite hear her door close, but Holmes must have, because he sprang forward and grabbed Watson in a tight embrace, leaning carefully to keep from putting pressure on his wounded leg.
, and Sherlock refused to do any work. “I’m busy thinking,” he would snap.
Sure enough, Sherlock returned a moment later, clutching a large map. He spread it out on the table, John moving to his side to hold down the corners.
Sally faced her father. “Do I…do I kneel?” She wasn’t there when Jamiarty was made Heir, and had only heard stories of how this ceremony went.
“He’s still following us,” Maria called.
“The loser lived. She ran off that way, and the winner followed those footprints—” Jamiarty indicated the footprints of a giant man and a dainty woman. “They lead to Guilder. We need to follow those. They will have the Princess.”
John. A terrible liar under the best of circumstances, he is positively atrocious at it when drunk. And he’s not lying now.
“What you did last night for me? That was umm… good. More than good. That was bloody amazing.”
His head rests again Sherlock’s shoulder, and once again, Sherlock is startled by how natural it feels. Normally, he detests physical contact, but this is John. John. Who can incapacitate any adversary without batting an eye but who struggles to use a chip and pin machine. Who can beat up a criminal, leaving several bruised ribs and sprains, yet in the same hour with the same hand, gently bandage the most gruesome wound. Full of contradictions: the doctor and the soldier, arrogant and humble, brilliant and an idiot. The best thing to ever happen to Sherlock, and also the worst. John taught him what it meant to care about someone more than himself, to be human, to become the person John already thought he was. And then he left, making Sherlock wish he could go back to simply being a sociopath. But apparently there isn’t a switch for that sort of thing. Sherlock would know; he conducted extensive research on the subject.
He continues to play.
But, no. Even there, he would never have John say what he said, do what he did.
“Shut up John.”
What if he does?
Laughter and John. Yes, everything is absolutely going to be ok.
John continues to process for what feels like an eternity, the confusion in his eyes deepening before slowly fading, becoming replaced by an emotion Sherlock has never seen before, that he can’t quite place.
Sherlock waits a beat, then offers a simple “no” in response as acknowledgement. Of course he didn’t have to come. But where else would he go, what else could possibly be more important than John? His best friend. His only friend. He wishes he could reach out and offer encouragement, something to show John how much he means to him, how broken he would be without him, how broken he is without him. To find some way to express to John that none of this is in any way his fault, that Mary would want him to still find some way to live, to help him somehow begin to heal. But, of course, he says nothing. He hates himself for it. Conversation, sentiment, has definitely never been his area and he’s sure he would just make the situation worse.
John, clearly experienced and pleased at finally having the advantage, somehow manages to smirk proudly when a particularly deft tongue motion gets Sherlock to actually groan out loud and sink slightly down on the table.
“I didn’t put my life on hold John. These past years, you… this…” he gestures to the flat that has always been theirs “... it has become my life.”
Would he still care now? Now that Sherlock was at least partially responsible for his wife’s death? Probably not. Deep down he wishes he would.
Sherlock has wanted this moment for so long, dreamed about it, thought about it more than he likes to admit, despite his constant efforts st keeping his mind under control. But he never thought that it would actually happen.
It’s normal. It’s what should have happened that first night six years ago.
John laughs and his eyes project confidence once more, this time quickly darkening into something much more primal. He closes the remaining distance between them and rests his hand against Sherlock’s hip, pressing him into place. He’s clearly in control and Sherlock is surprised at how good it feels despite him not having the upper hand. He feels safe, secure. Excited. Without breaking eye contact, he does what he’s wanted to do forever and reaches up to cup John’s cheek, his long fingers resting behind John’s neck, intertwining his fingers in the hair at his nape.
But before he can speak, John visibly relaxes as understanding dawns in his face. His features soften, his shoulders slacken.
Once again he is caught off guard by the longing for different circumstances. Circumstances where John ending up in Sherlock's bed, sleepy and disheveled, is a regular occurrence. Where Sherlock is allowed to crawl in next to him, to rest his head on his shoulder, to kiss the irritatingly exposed patch of skin on his left side, right underneath his colllerbone, to let his lips trace up to his shoulder and down his arm. To still be there in the morning, to see John wake up with a drowsy smile, to finally kiss his lips fully and passionately. He’s never felt the desire to cuddle before. God. Just the implication has been enough for him to abruptly leave after several one-night stands, rapidly lecturing on the effects of chemicals firing and the parallels between desire for meaningless comfort and idiocy, calls of “arsehole” and “bloody prick” following him out the door.
“Not like you don't, Detective.” John tucked his head against Sherlock, listening to the steady beat of his heart. It wouldn't be much longer until he would have to pretend that this precious, wonderful heart had ceased to beat. He shuddered. Mycroft meant well with his acting classes, but he didn't understand that the horror John felt at the mere idea of Sherlock being dead would be enough to convince the casual observer of his pain.
“Yes, I have.” Cerise stood tall. Her face was tearstained as she looked at Jamiarty. “You will be kept in the Zoo of Death, from now until the end of your days. You will be in a cage, surrounded by other beasts, and you will be an example to anyone who visits there. It will no longer be a hunting preserve, but an educational one. Carla loved animals, after all. Anyone who aided you will join you there, chained without magic.”
Also, in case you haven't noticed, I'm kind of addicted to backstory.
“I’m just checking to see if anyone’s following us.”
He explained that to John and Anderson when he rejoined them.
“John!” Sherlock yanked his lover close, just out of the way of a sudden spurt of fire.
Anderson shook his head, but he couldn’t seem to cry anymore. “No…no…”
“You’re still going to talk to him, aren’t you?”
“We’re meeting Anderson further—”
“I’ve seen worse. You got money?”
There was something about the promise in his voice that made John shiver. He did his best not to show it, but by the amused look in Sherlock's eyes he hadn't succeeded.
“You’d be a much better father than me.”
“You really are a meanie.”
“I’m afraid so. I can’t compete with you physically, and you’re no match for my brains.”
“Happy anniversary, John.”
“Right.” Janine spread a map out on the library’s table. “Who wants to kill us?”
"Maybe I should go instead," Kate offered. "I'm not as....recognizable."
“Thankfully.”
Cheers,
“Oh, I’m just getting started,” Ireni replied. “Because iocane comes from Australia, and Australia is entirely peopled with criminals and crocodiles, both creatures who are used to having people not trust them so I can clearly not choose the wine in front of you!”
“Have you heard from Inspector Lestrade?” Mycroft asked.
Warning for minor character death (no one you know), reference to assisted suicide.
“Thank you, Ireni.” Molly hesitated. “How much control do you have over the child?”
And Sherlock understood. He saw, for the first time ever, two masks shift. He caught a glimpse of something truly terrifying; a man with beating heart without a soul, without conscience, without mercy.
See ‘Cats and Dogs’
Mike was driving as quickly as he could, Molly shouting in the backseat, switching between her phone and Sherlock's as she tried to coordinate with Mycroft and Greg. Sherlock sat motionless in the passenger seat, eyes fixed straight ahead. They were going to save John—no, he was going to save John. That was all there was to it.
"Anyways, again, not all the dimensions are caught up with each other. Stupid, really. Just so we're clear, there was nothing wrong with the way you two loved each other. Nothing at all. We were all quite happy with the way things turned out after we…showed you each other." David beamed. "Nothing better than watching real love, it never gets old. "
John buried his face in Sherlock’s shoulder. “Sherlock, I’m not—”
And there was. Waverly’s favourite meal was breakfast, and the cooks had pulled out all the stops for the meal. There were five different kinds of pancakes, for a start, and dishes heaped with fruit.
Then they were at the docks, and Anderson was reaching down for his daughter and grabbing her to his chest and sobbing. Grezzik lifted Molly and then Ireni out of the boat, and Molly raised her sword, angling the ray of sun off the blade so it sparkled.
“We’re fine, your Highness.” Sherlock put his arm around John. “He didn’t succeed with us, anyways.”
Where the hell was he?
Somehow Mycroft Holmes had gone from the-posh-man-with-a-brolly to brother, and if the man was unaware, John had always been good at explaining the obvious to geniuses.
Before Grezzik could ask what on Earth he meant, Mycroft pulled him down—gently, and any second Grezzik could have stopped him but he didn’t want to—into a kiss.
“That is not true,” Moran said doggedly. “Nor is it true that Princess Sherlock left the Prince after their marriage.”
I do what I want, says I.
To his surprise the night stayed balmy even as the fog surrounded them. Holmes stepped closer to Watson, and they both stopped. The night was quiet, their breathing the only sound.
“And Princess Janine? Is Guilder satisfied?”
And yes, I brought Ireni back. I didn't want to kill her in the first story (even though that's what happens to Vizzini), but she was going to be too much trouble. She's helpful now!
Sherlock whirled. Jamiarty stood in the doorway, a knife against an albino’s throat.
He felt John’s hand around his wrist. And now John was pulling him up, but it was so much slower going up than down, and Sherlock’s arm felt like it was being pulled from his socket, and now he was starting to panic, but he swallowed it down, pushed it into the cave where his heart had been hidden, shredded and bleeding, three years back…
“Ah, you’re awake.”
“John, that’s hardly appropriate for the morning. Besides, you’ll wake Mrs. Hudson.”
The sound of a speeding car drew John's attention. Mike's old car was coming down the road. John's breath caught in his throat. When he turned back it was a second too late; Moriarty had the gun drawn now.
Grezzik looked up, saw the heels of the witch’s boots. It would be so easy to just speed ahead, but instead he kept pace with her. At least, until the witch was over the top. Then he sped up with a burst of strength, and vaulted them over the top of the Cliffs. Molly somersaulted over his back, and landed with her sword drawn. They’d practiced that move hard, once upon a time.
Mike never thought he’d be a good dad. His seventeen children, two blood and fifteen adopted, say otherwise.
There was someone waiting for them at the dock, someone John had honestly never expected to see again.
Sherlock sniffed. “The fact that he thought that would work is insulting.”
“I believe you.” The man in black held his sword steady. “What happens now?”
“Are the horses disguised?” Ireni asked.
Grezzik craned his neck, and his blood went cold even as he continued to row.
“I will do whatever it takes to protect the Princess,” Moran said.
Cheers,
“I know how you feel,” Sally whispered.
At last the song was presented from trembling fingers into the listener's hands. The listener, who had caught snatches of the song for years, never understanding the music to be for him, about him. Never guessing that the notes were the words of a man who had never known how to show his heart.
Bertie Gruner had been an attractive man in a sense—tall, dark, smouldering eyes, strong jaw and firm mouth. Now acid—it was sulfuric acid, and Sherlock had a sneaking suspicion that it had come from his kitchen table—was eating away at his features, turning a face any woman would look twice at into a mockery of the human form.
The next day they rode out together and found Sherlock in the woods, tending to a patch of strange flowers.
"Shut up, dear," Watson and John said at the same time.
“The executioner is also the interrogator,” Sherlock answered. “For high treason they have to do things by the book, otherwise it’ll look like an Abuse of Power offense. Jamiarty wants to keep the crown, not lose it on a technicality.”
John knew better to ask questions, but there were several burning on the tip of his tongue as he pulled on the clothes Sherlock had laid out for him— jeans, a dark shirt, a cream coloured jumper, and his old leather jacket. Sherlock was dressed in a white shirt and a black blazer, and he pulled his coat and his old scarf on as they went out the door. A cab was hailed in an instant, and they were off.
“Your daughter is buried here,” Sherlock said.
“Probably a local fisherman out for a pleasure cruise at midnight through eel-infested waters,” Ireni said. She examined her nails. “The night air is supposedly good for your skin.”
“I don’t know if I’ll be a very good husband,” Holmes admitted as he reached out for his lover’s hand. “But if you’ll give me the chance I’d be grateful.”
"Yes, Kitty. Put your laptop away, the show's about to start!"
The woman shook her head.
“Which at best will be tomorrow night.”
Stan laughed. “Not at all; that means the hormones are really working.” He stroked his beard. “Anyways I…well, I can’t. We can’t have our own baby.”
Two down, and the hardest to go...
They separated their blades, and the duel began.
That coaxed a laugh out of John.
Sherlock kissed him. “It’s perfect,” he said when he let John go. “I just don’t totally understand yet.”
Sometimes Jamiarty would join him, an arm around his waist, and they would talk about the 500
Sherlock laughed. “You’re correct.” He swept John up in his arms, ignoring his husband’s indignant protests. “Which way to the cake, brother dear?”
“My parents didn’t want me. They as good as told me right from the beginning, and I was expected to deal with that. I was never starving or anything like that, but when I wasn’t perfect…well, Father always made his displeasure clear.”
“And you’ll be put up for murder. I see it in your eyes, girl. It won’t help her—he’s got seven brothers, all worse than him. She knows she’s lucky right now.”
Sherlock didn’t answer, concentrating instead on the wound.
“Honestly, love, I’m not sure what the problem is. You know we’re all safe, you know that we have the upper hand…”
Kitty shrugged. "It's all one, I suppose." She leaned back just a little bit on the sofa, body still curled in on itself. She looked exhausted, all of a sudden, and John wanted to give her some kind of comfort. Not knowing what the problem was, however, made it difficult to treat the symptoms.
John reached over and took Sherlock’s pulse. “Your heart is racing like mad, and your pupils are dilated. And you’re sweating.”
“I’m with Princess Sherlock and Philip Anderson, husband of Sally Donovan. We represent her interests.”
“We’ll be there by nightfall. We don’t have much to bring.”
“Thank you, Ireni.” Grezzik hesitated. “Which way’s my way?”
“Of course,” Grandfather John said. “Mind you stay off the rocks, though. They’ll be slippery.”
“Who told you?”
And after all, dreams had always been good to them.
When Kitty got two letters in one week, she knew something was wrong.
So John listened as his lover laid out his plan of self-destruction. To feed Moriarty information that could lead to a public disgrace. To let Moriarty go ahead with his plans feeling secure; let him get out of this sentence, let him pull Sherlock down. Make him a fraud.
"We need to strategize," Molly realized after a moment. "There needs to be a plan."
Those furthest out in the country saw the messengers last, and by then they were weary of describing the beauty of the Princess. Those slightly closer to the capital heard stories of a man beautiful beyond compare, and those closer still actually saw a sketch (most of the sketches were torn to pieces before they got past the first town).
Sherlock didn't answer. His partner's eyes were closed, fingertips pressed together.
Watson swallowed. “Of course.” It was odd, this; he’d been in similar situations before, but never when the stakes were quite so high.
“Are you sure you’re alright to walk?”
“Impeccable family medical history, tall, attractive, amazingly intelligent…” John took his husband’s hand. “Dear, don’t be stupid. It looks bad on you.”
That was definitely a lie, Molly could tell. But Moran did seem sincere about something.
better than I do.”
John rolled his eyes and turned around.
The Reichenbach conclusion. Warning for character death (though if you know me by now you'll probably guess it isn't someone anyone cares about.
"Quite frankly, the most beautiful child I've ever seen," Holmes replied, voice deep with emotion. Watson saw tears sparkling in his husband's eyes. "You did a fine job, Kitty."
“Does it have to be loud, this ceremony?” Janine asked hopefully. “If they did it in secret, in silence…maybe they could be done before he can get there.”
Watson reached under his shirt and pulled out the ring Holmes had given him nearly twenty years before. He put it on, sliding it perfectly into place. He reached out and took Holmes’ hand.
