Both Mike and John couldn't help to smile. The doctor ran his hand through his hair, looking for the correct words and pointed to them.
Moriarty grimaced with lust. When he recorded the “Holmes killing Holmes” message for Eurus at Sherringford, he complained of not seeing the brothers killing each other. But now, he had a second chance to witnessing it and in a stall sit. He approached a bit since he didn’t want to miss any detail of the scene: Sherlock pointing a gun at Mycroft and the older Holmes pointing back Sherlock.
Lestrade smiled and helped him settle in, tucking him in with a blanket.
He missed talking with Sherlock. He didn’t want to admit it, but he was worried about how Sherlock would be doing with the kids. The detective seemed shocked when he walked away.
"It's okay. See you around then,"
Bruce tilted his head and pressed his lips together, annoyed, looking dangerously at the detective, a greenish glow illuminating his eyes.
John smiled and shook his head sadly.
"You are a genius, no doubt about it," Jake said.
The bombers just checked the main gate. There was no indication that it was connected to a bomb. But if Clay had a detonator and was watching them, he could set it off if he went inside.
Both Holmes nodded.
It seemed for a moment that Peter was going to burst with pride. He turned to Tony, who looked at Sherlock gratefully for a second and got his pride back by looking at Peter.
He wanted to scream, rant against everything and everyone, and cry out to heaven to disappear.
"That you would have left me. It's bad enough dealing with someone like… me, to also carry the burden that I was ... responsible for Anthony's death".
Sherlock gulped audibly. Every time John gave him that order, the doctor became a merciless teasing demon, relentlessly teasing him, bringing him to the edge of orgasm over and over again without allowing him to come. John turned his fingers, and Sherlock moaned when he hit his prostate, making his cock jumping hard.
Sherlock groaned in pain. John approached him, grabbed his hand and caressed his cheek, trying to calm him. But he knew that if his husband was not treated soon, he could die.
“My mummy says phones are not allowed while eating,” said Paul, another C captain, and the rest hummed in agreement.
"Rosie's done this drawing before with permanent markers, right?"
“The rest of the parents?”
“It's not your fault” repeated John, so close to Sherlock as he could.

"Unless what has jumped from one universe to another, it jumps to a different one, realizing that it can travel between them. Then it can move at will," replied Bruce, and Stephen nodded.
But he surprised himself by thinking about Strange every minute. He sought excuses to meet him, even went to the New York sanctum a couple of times. Until he decided it had to end. He could not live in love like a child with a man who would never notice him.
"But..., this..." muttered Sherlock surprised to notice the box's weight and warmth. And even more so when the box began to whine softly.
“Fuck, John!” was all he finally managed to say, snuggling the doctor.
“Two words: fallow deer.”
"Even Anderson and Donovan helped," said Molly.
Moreover, Sherlock was
The children replied with a disappointed ooooooooh. Then they grouped together and whispered between them.
“I’m… I cannot… Fuck me, John.” the detective seemed to be squirming over the sheets.
It was Sherlock’s turn to raise an eyebrow.
"Gate to Uzbekistan, sir, he is just arrested there," one of their agents told Mycroft. Two seconds later, it was one of the Yard who warned Sherlock was being held at the gate for Beijing, and shortly afterward, a third reported he was at the Kabul gate.
"Daddy!" shouted Rosie from upstairs, "come and see my room."
Suddenly it all made sense in John's brain. The whole thing had been staged to protect them.
"Tell me, was there cake?"
"But..."
"Greg," the DI turned to face the window, from where he could see Mrs. Hudson's distressed face. "Bring my boys back home," she implored.
Pete gave the agreed-upon signal. Sherlock rolled his eyes at that lousy imitation of the owl's wailing. Still, Pete had not consented to change it, and the detective knew he would have to cope with his companions' little quirks. Soon after, seven men came out of the shadows. Among the nine of them, opened the hangar doors and ran to the private plane waiting inside. One of them sat at the controls. When the last men got on the aircraft, Sherlock waved the pilot off. He was about to climb the ladder when someone put his hand on his shoulder.
Little by little, the rest of the guests arrived: some of John's army mates, Sarah, and other colleagues from the clinic, Mike Stanford - who Sherlock and John asked to be his best man, along with Greg, but he politely declined the invitation, saying, amidst laughter, that he had done enough as a matchmaker. The doctor also saw Angelo, Henry Knight, who they met at the Baskerville case and different faces familiar to him from having seen them at Sherlock's stag party. Greg, Donovan, and the rest of the Yarders arrived together. The DI approached Mycroft and brushed his hand in a loving gesture. He would have liked to kiss him, but he didn't know if the elder Holmes would be knocked down.
“For what?”
“Kids, this is …”
"Sherlock asked me to prepare your breakfast."
All three laughed. Bill took one look at the place and whistled.
******
"Sherlock!" cried, John. The doctor practically jumped over him, making the detective wobble until his back hit the wall, his lips pressed by John's ones.
He was making Sherlock Holmes purr like a kitty.
“Now, wait for the baby with your friends.”
"Of course," he replied to Rosie's joy, "are you coming, Sherlock?
"You want my cock?" he asked, playfully, "come and get it."
“I have to pick Sherlock up at the hosp…, never mind”.
He turned as he heard the truck's brakes squeal as the skilled driver easily lowered the dune. Sherlock entered the building, a warehouse completely clear except for several metal columns and... empty. The Major rushed down behind him, while the detective ran across to the other side.
“Because,“ Sherlock answered, embracing John again,“
John trusting became erratic and finally, with a howl, came inside Sherlock, the detective squirming and wriggling feeling John’s hot cum inside until the doctor fell on Sherlock'’s body, both panting heavily.
“It’s still the four victim, isn’t it?“ Asked Sally.
So he pretended to go to the lab. He knew John will go to talk with Mycroft. He smiled sadly. It was three in the morning, but, for Sherlock, the doctor didn’t care if he had to drag the British Government out of his bed.
"What the hell is a ghoul?" asked Lestrade.
Everyone looked at the door in silence for a few moments, surprised. Lestrade turned to Sherlock in disgust.
"Come to bed. You need to sleep".
The two living dead turned and jumped over the dissection table in the detective’s direction. They were faster than Sherlock expected, and he barely had time to shoot them while they came upon him. Molly screamed again, watching the three bodies rolling around the ground. Seconds after, Sherlock stood, a bit dizzy, unaware of a third body jumping over him. Before it could reach the detective, three bullets made the zombie fall into the floor. Sherlock looked at Molly, who was holding his gun and bowed his head lightly. Molly smiled, scared, her hands and his lower lip trembling, but with a fierce look in her eyes.
"Whichever one you want" answered John "the one you like best".
"An ancient Chinese legend says "began Stephen "that there is an old matchmaker God, Yuè Xià Lǎorén, who goes out every night to look for the souls that are destined to be together on Earth. Once he finds them, he links them with a red thread tied to the little finger of each one".
“See love? You could do it”.
Sherlock’s retreated himself in his Mind Palace, his mind racing unbridled, much faster than usual. He run into the memory of John repeating "It's not your fault" over and over again. Listening to it, he managed to breach the fear. He wasn’t the sensitive and lonely twenty years old boy Moran met. What happened broken him, but also made him stronger. He learnt to fend by himself, and not only in a metaphorical way. From that point of view, Sebastian didn’t seem so powerful. Surely he never was, but Sherlock wasn’t able to see it then. The idea helped him to regain some of his courage.
"He gave you a lot of money in payment for the job."
******
"The Necronomicon", also known as "The book of the dead" is a fictional grimoire (textbook of magic) appearing in stories by the horror writer H. P. Lovecraft.
John jumped from the plain with his ex-army mates and ran towards Irene's.
“To Baker Street?" she asked with disdain, "To beg him to help us?“ Lestrade stirred uncomfortably. Donovan wasn't reasonable and, definitely, not helpful. Anyway, he didn’t want to argue with his subordinated, so remained silent while listening to the woman’s wailing, “I'll better go home.”
"What is he up to?" asked Sholto, gesturing toward the sleeping Sherlock with his head.
"You heard him, quarantine at Baker Street. Basically, how they get past the quarantine. According to the Internet, Dr. Watson inadvertently connected the signal to his blog, and from there to the webcams, they must have in the living room or the kitchen, I don't know. But it's a lot of fun".
"It was cool! Can we do it again? Did I do it right?"
"As hell."
But he needed something to let Sherlock know that he wasn't buried there. Otherwise, if they found the graves and left them for dead, they would wait until they could repatriate the bodies. And by the time they realized the deception, it would be too late. His hand trembling, blocking the painful memories it brought to him, the doctor wrote Sherlock's initials on a third stone.
The DI chuckled again, proudly.
“Your fault.”
“Creepy Camp” the detective whispered in his husband’s ear,
“Well, this was Rowan’s merit,” muttered the detective, touched.
"There is no possible way to reconcile eating with the mask. That's why Rosie has already had dinner, right?" the girl nodded vehemently, "but she will have hot chocolate with us."
"Joooooohn!" Sherlock's shocked scream made him turn around, while the detective's phone ringed without pause.
“Nonsense. I’ll figure it out.”
John laughed out loud.
John kissed Sherlock's head, noting how he huddled even more against him without letting go of his phone. After a few minutes, the detective's breathing became regular, but John knew that he was only pretending to sleep. He kissed his hair and sighed, worried, wondering what had frightened him so much.
Suddenly, his face lighted up.
To settle the matter, the detective stepped aside and waved Sholto and the others upstairs. John stood beside them, watching them. He gestured to take off his sling.
Sherlock stared at him for a bit. He took the doctor's feet and put them in his lap.
"Don't tell him I told you. He'll kill me if he finds out. And now get dressed. You won't be late for your wedding day."
Sherlock rolled his eyes. Of course, he remembered the route perfectly.
But if it was not the police, what was it then?
"That is why you didn't let me look into it."
Mycroft left the room dramatically. John and Greg looked at each other before bursting into laughter.
“Boring, you know. Sorry if I scared you.”
"Sorry, Greg. I didn't want to upset you. It's only that... since the attack is like...".
"Yes. Boringly predictable, as Sherlock used to say. But he liked Anthony. He was a good man, loyal, and was in tune with Mycroft from the very beginning. He even could keep up with his brain, and Anthony loved Mycroft's intelligence, powers of deduction… and well, so many hours working together and..., they fell in love".
"It worked! Lyon is the closest airport to Charmant."
"Yes, love?" asked the doctor, pushing his tongue inside Sherlock hole as deep as he could, fucking him with his tongue, as Sherlock panting whines increased in volume.
Anthea approached Sarah. The girl looked at her, frightened but relaxed by the sight of Mrs. Hudson behind her. She had played many times with Rosie at her nanny's house. She gave them biscuits and milk and the three of them would have a snack watching a Disney movie.
"This is impossible," muttered Lestrade.
There was silence on the other side of the line. Sherlock pressed his eyes and grimaced in disgust.
"You've just missed the beginning. Every day, the girl does an hour's homework. The first day she did it with Mr. Holmes".
Little by little, as Sherlock filled in the drawing of the jellyfish bell with water, it did indeed seem to come to life, as Rosie's lines floated over the water precisely as she had drawn them.
“You ok, love?” John asked softly.
Mycroft stood up to face her. He stopped short as he saw two other huge submissive men flanking her, clearly awaiting his orders.
“No, I’m focused!” assured Sherlock raising his hands, watching Molly preparing herself to slap him again.
"What if they were taken by car?" asked Jake.
"No. I didn't. I love you, remember. I want to start with you a new life. She… it wasn't too hard for her to imagine that, as soon as you could, you'd come back to Baker Street".
"But in another reality, another version of you decided to fight for John, that he wouldn't let him marry Mary."
"It doesn't have to be them, Sherlock."
"I don't know what to do, Gregory."
"We'll see about that.
"Shut up, Mycroft!" they all shouted in chorus.
He jumped on his car, shifting in his seat to rearrange his erection into a more comfortable position. During the trip home, he had to adjust his trousers a couple of times and then forced himself to grip the wheel till his knuckles went white, to control the urge of freeing his cock and stroke himself in every red traffic light.
It hadn’t always been so little. There was a time, fifteen years ago, when the content of the box filled all his Mind Palace, running through his brain restlessly. Somehow, he managed to confine it to several rooms and, after meeting John, he could put the load inside a box, which was getting smaller each year. But he could never break free from it completely. It would accompany him until death.
Mycroft turned to him, shocked.
They had been hiking for almost ten minutes, John and Rosie leading the group and Sherlock the last in line, to make sure none of the kid got lost when John and his daughter looked at each other, astonished. Sherlock was singing. Not humming a classical piece of music, as he used to do. He was actually singing
Limping slightly, he went to the kitchen, opened the fridge, cut two big pieces of cake, and gave one to John, who had moved behind him. Sherlock kissed him, tasting the chocolate aroma from John's mouth and took his hand, guiding them to their bedroom. He jumped onto the bed, still cramming the cake down.
“Well, you are four. You will have a lot to compare”.
"What are they going to do now?"
"Sir!" cried an officer, looking through the window.
Sherlock bit his lower lip as John shook his head. The detective got serious.
John, Sherlock, Rosie. Memories of Sherlock's childhood, Beach, The Princess Bride.
Mycroft shook his head.
The detective nodded.
"Do you want me to show you your room?" Bart asked Rosie.
"Sherlock was devastated. He was a sensitive child, more than their parents understood. The poor boy dug for days and days, alone or with the help of the gardeners, trying to find the place Eurus was referring to in her song. Until he lost all hope of finding Victor. Then he locked himself away. He stopped laughing, playing, eating… He barely spoke, and, when he did, it was only to spit out deductions, to drive others away”.
Lestrade sat in the other. Mycroft slowly walked over, picked up a chair and sat down next to the DI, who smiled, winked at him and took his hand. Some minutes later Molly, Anthea, Donovan joined them.
"How well she knows you," laughed John. "Anyway..."
The receptionist hesitated to ask her to speak more quietly when several people in the hall turned around when they heard the detective's name.
"What is the bad one?"
"What were you doing here?" asked Tony.
Sally freeze.
"Okay!" cried the little girl, running inside.
"Just trust me. You'll beg me to bounce you in the sand."
“Ditch the gun, Sherlock. You don’t have any chance against me”.
“YES!!!!,” all of them shouted at the top of their voices.
"Nothing, we had a slight difference in the number of guests."
"You look tired," said the detective when John bent to kiss him in the lips, "Hard day at work?"
John hit Sherlock in the arm. The detective's body shook to the rhythm of the laughter he was trying to conceal, hiding his face in his hands. He finally managed to pull himself together, got up, and pulled John towards the living room window, followed by an amused Rosie.
John looked at him as if Lestrade had slapped him.
"And why your accident?" asked John "You didn't know anything about his activities, did you?"
They both laughed.
"Count me in," added Sholto.
Mycroft pursed his lips in contempt.
"Major?" Lestrade's voice mixed with the wail of the sandy wind.
The room was filled with pants, gasps, and moans coming from the mouth of someone desperate for release.
He caught his lips, in a soft, tender kiss, and then brushed his nose gently against Sherlock's, who felt his heart melt, feeling loved, warm, safe and happy and, a fact that still surprised himself sometimes, reading the same in John's eyes.
"Myc, we are in the desert, and you took sedatives. You have to drink."
"You idiot".
Donovan raised his eyebrows but refrained herself from asking.
John joined him in the chorus
"Sir," shouted the SAS sergeant, driving at full speed, forcing the occupants without seats to hold on as best they could so as not to be thrown back and forth inside the huge truck by the strong swaying and jumping, as it ran over the dunes.
"How does Mycroft feel about you being back?"
"Ouch" snarled Sherlock.
With a trembling hand due to fear and anger, he began to dial Irene's number, but before he finished, Sherlock weakly tried to take his hand off the keyboard, intendedly looking at Mike.
Lestrade's face lit up.
The man whistled.
"Shhh, that's it, that's it, Mycroft."
John's scream bounced off the walls, startling him, the mercenaries, and even Sholto and the others still used to the doctor's outbursts.
"You are wrong. If Mycroft has to, he will. And so will I."
Sherlock rolled his eyes.
Sholto and the ex-soldiers have locked up rest of the mercenaries in one of the old dungeons of the castle, bound and gagged, waiting for the French police to enter and arrest them. They only left a handcuffed Mike with them.
Sherlock came first, an agonizing chock leaving his mouth as he tensed his body, covering his abdomen and chest with come. A couple of minutes later, John and Greg came almost at the same time, mixing his come with Sherlock's over his body.
"What's the plan?"
Mycroft rolled his eyes as the man disappeared for a moment to return, pushing a bar from which they were hanging several garment bags. Without a word, he took them and gave one to each homeless, who looked at them, a bit puzzled, noticing their names on the labels. Finally, he gave one to Mycroft and another to Greg.
Sherlock heard the click of the bottle of lube and closed his eyes. Slowly, he bent his legs and pressed his feet on the mattress, stifling a wail of pain. John helped him to raise his hips and put a pillow under them, making sure Sherlock was as comfortable as possible.
“Are you fine?”
He turned and walked quickly across the alley, but soon another group of about twenty men cut him off.
"He came in here."
Holmes opened his eyes wide, breathless, frozen, and Everett could see a hint of hope in those verdigris eyes as he bit his lower lip.
"Thank you, thank you, thank you. You are the best parents in the world!!! But don't ever leave without me again".
Lestrade clapped, giggling. His impression of Sherlock was great, and he knew John was mad at the detective because, contrary to what happened when he was the injured one, Sherlock was following the instructions of John's doctors with Spartan discipline.
"Leave him alone," intervened Sherlock, "There's no point in looking for blame. You have to look for solutions."
"Cockcage."
Moriarty laughed again.
John and Sherlock nodded. The net was close enough that they could watch her from the canopy. Excited, after letting John smear her with sunscreen again, she ran after her new friend.
The Serbian extended one arm, grabbing the doctor's throat. He had enough strength to strangle him easily. But the demon went crazy and hit him in the elbow. The Serbian shouted again, feeling his nerves torn from his joint, while a new rain of blows fell on him.
“See? You are acting different. But I know it is due to something Sally told you.“ He smirked. “She’s been busy today”.
“Thank you for bringing our son to the hospital,” said the woman, taking John out of his thoughts. “We know he can be a bit annoying, always getting into trouble.”
"And why don't you do that?" he asked in a smug tone, not stopping to fiddle with his umbrella. Sherlock narrowed his eyes, focusing his attention on it for a few moments to look back at his brother.
"John, what is this?"
At the Avengers' headquarters, John was telling Peter the details of the latest case while the two of them wrote the blog post, something the doctor stated in the first paragraph of the article. Peter was about to explode with emotion.
Mycroft frowned at what John said. He was relieved to hear that Sherlock was okay. Not hearing from him made him fear the worst, although he wanted to strangle the detective for not letting himself be taken care of.
"You really care", and this time it wasn't a question.
"Bruce," snarled the scientist.
“What are you doing?” Sherlock tried to sound nonchalant but failed miserably. His all-powerful brain wasn’t able to understand why, being so dominant, he found so extremely arousing to surrender himself to John, to let him take the control. Sherlock, who always hated being touched, who had always avoided other human being’s proximity as much as he could, felt how his body turned on at the same time his brain turned off with John’s touch.
Anthea shrugged, worried.
The girl pointed to a net about fifty feet away, around which children of various ages were grouped, and said something else.
John looked into Sherlock's eyes and kissed him softly.
"You can fool everyone, but not me."
We decided to split chapter 8 in two. After posting it, we thought it was better for the story.
“What is your name?”
“What?”
Sherlock didn't answer, trying to control the distress. If they had broken their word to John, they could do the same to Rosie. He could only pray that the ploy to get her to safety would work on time.
Mycroft felt relieved, knowing his brother understood him.
"Remember what I told you about your parents looking for a long lost friend of your Daddy's, and about the people who don't want them to find him?
"Don't worry. Sherlock is not going to do anything foolish".
The workers looked at each other and back at her again, undecided. They were trained to fight spies, dismantle plots or terrorist networks, but not to deal with a furious and resolute Mrs. Hudson.
(Extract of Sonet 116)
Holmes scratched his head with the gun. John was right. Damn it! He went back to Baker Street to make John remember their time together, but he never thought he'd be found quickly. Especially not Donovan. In fact. Why were they looking for him? For four or five bodies?
"Shoot me. Kill me. The moment you do that, the beautiful little girl you both worked so hard to protect will blow away. And you know I'm not bluffing, boss" he spat the last word scornfully.
"No".
He smiled mischievously.
"Sherlock, untie me!" he panted.
"You can call it what you like, but it's still disgusting, just like you," snarled the detective, carefully probing the area around the wound and looking at his brother".
Molly nodded.
One of the three he had was his favorite: John sitting in his armchair, with Rosie on his lap, while the doctor read her a storybook. Sherlock took the picture himself a couple of years ago, from the kitchen, leaving one of his experiments unattended to listen to John reading and Rosie's comments in her baby tongue.
"I killed you myself." whispered a horrified Mycroft, his eyes dazed, lost it his memories.
"Soothe the pain," the detective replied laconically.
"Shut up and listen to me," he unlocked the safety gun and rested the barrel on the detective's forehead.
The truck rolled through the desert, moving quickly through the sandstorm that came out of nowhere. Just the bumping of the sand against the truck's frame would occasionally startle its passengers.
John nodded.
“You two, behave” nagged Mycroft, slapping both men in the back of their necks at the same time, making them giggle. “There are children around.”
“I don’t think it’s ME who you should apologize.
John gestured as if to play down the importance and looked sideways to the other terrace when Lestrade and Mycroft sitting each one in an armchair chatting quietly,
"Volunteers?"
he wrote, turned off the phone volume and sent the message.
"I'd like to see it, especially Sherlock's face, but no, I don't think so. Do you know, Mycroft?"
He turned to Mycroft who stopped him with a gesture.
“How is he?” he asked immediately, not bothering to hide his anxiety.
"Get on the B right away. We will soon have company", she answered hastily. Donovan hummed, understanding what she meant, and hung up.
“Well, I'm glad you did. What do you want to drink?”
"So he says. But he does. He criticizes it, but he loves it. When I wrote he didn't know the Earth revolved around the Sun, I found a human head in the fridge. I don't even want to think what I will find if you write he guesses instead of deducing..."
Sherlock slowly got up and went over to the window, not daring to go through it. No matter how hard he tried to make it disappear, the fear that John would one day get fed up with him and abandon him was always there. And it was further accentuated by the doctor having a great time with his old army buddies.
"Don't believe a word this tinhorn detective tells you. Don't let it go to your head".
"Anderson, your ability to be wrong breaks even the law of probability," sneered Sherlock.
Sherlock's lips quivered with fury, and he made a gesture to throw himself at Clay.
John stretched the detective's arms and put his wrists together, covering each of them with a small towel so that the ropes would not hurt his skin when he tied them together tightly.
"What for? So that his stupid brother can…?"
Total silence, unless John considered an act of communication Sherlock moving a few millimeters to turn his back on him more ostensibly.
"Vincent Spaulding. Anthony kept repeating his name over and over while he was dying. I thought he was delirious because he was saying they… they were two Clays or something similar…" he opened his eyes as he realised what it meant "you created your own doppelganger".
Sherlock bit his lower lip, looked at the floor, and nodded, almost imperceptibly.
The older Holmes remained some minutes silent. He opened his mouth, closed it again, and opened it again.
"It's not the food. I mean… I'm hungry, but…, it's only" Everett hesitated a couple of seconds," I can't understand how you are capable of doing this to me."
Sherlock's fingers moved to the middle of John's forehead and rubbed his thumbs to his nose, tracing the path to the tip, drawing the arches of his eyes, returning to his nose with his fingertips to finally draw the line under his cheekbones, down from his temples to his neck until his jaw.
"The prize deserved it," muttered Sherlock, chewing his last piece of cake and looking at John with puppy eyes.
"Oh, Fuck, you feel amazing...so tight...."
Lestrade nodded.
“I offered you my help when the murders began but you rejected it.” He whispered in a rush voice.
Dimmock pulled them out, and the three of them left the place.
"Why?" Wong asked. "Nothing is happening in New York.
It was Rosie’s class parents WhatsApp group. Tommy’s father, after explained what happened to Tommy, wrote that the other kids remained at the camp with Sherlock (only - with - Sherlock, he highlighted), and the rest of the parents got instantly mad, writing messages about experiments, antisocial behaviour and taste for crime.
"Instructions, pet," he said in his best Capitan's tone.
They moved to a little, dark room with a glass wall, through which they could see a short, bald man around his fifty who, terrified, refused to answer the agents' questions, repeating one time after another that all was a misunderstanding. He was shivering and tearful, but stubbornly repeated the same sentence over and over again.
But that did not mean that, if no reinforcements came, they would not be able to find them. And from her past relationship with Moriarty, she knew that whoever led that attack would have no scruples about kidnapping a little girl or even killing her. Yet she was willing to give her life to prevent it, if necessary.
Greg laughed willingly.
"Sherlock called me and said: You have a table booked with Irene at Angelo's tomorrow at nine. There will be a candle. Don't miss it. Wear lipstick."
So they sat and wait.
He resumed reading:
"John Watson," said vehemently, standing between Natasha and the detective, with the clear intention of marking his territory, which made her smile mockingly.
"As I told you, in the worst possible place," he looked sideways at the God of Thunder, who nodded. "As you know, on all planes of the universe, light and darkness complement each other; they cannot exist without each other. Ying and yang, positive and negative, even on the astral plane, we can find light beings and dark entities trying to harm us".
His whole body was in pain. His shoulder ached from the brutality with which his hands were tied behind his back. He didn't know how long they had been dragged across the dunes to the camp. More than a day, because they walked at night, but his dehydrated brain lost track of time.
“What did you say?” He whistled through his teeth.
But there was no way Clay could have known that Sherlock was going to take Rosie to Irene's house. Even he couldn't have foreseen that his brother would do that. Molly was predictable, but Irene...
"Thank you, Captain, yes, yes, thank you."
The detective looked at John, inquisitive.
"A couple? You are aware Sherlock doesn't like celebrating his birthday, aren't you?"
She nodded firmly.
John almost had a stroke.
"Give me another one. I now you can" John's panted growl in his ear made his cock about to explode again, as the doctor stroked him in pace with his erratic thrusts. "Come with me, love", John moaned and buried deeper his cock with each thrust, his mind dizzy with lust as Sherlock arched off him and fucked back onto his cock.
"Toy Story!" cried Rosie, clapping her hands, enthusiastically, as John and Sherlock bowed, taking off their hats. John gave Rosie hers. Sherlock put it back on and walked to the kitchen to prepare three glasses of orange juice, followed by John.
"And how will she take the chocolate, genius? By osmosis?"
"I put in when the girl does her doctorate. Because she's brilliant, and I'm sure she will."
"Captain in the Fifth Northumberland Fusiliers. Three years in Afghanistan," answered John, making the military salute in the English way.
"We know where he is" announced Anthea on the other end "I got a call from Mycroft and Craig located it. A car is arriving".
"I'm fed up! I quit! The wedding is over!" he bellowed, looking at the ceiling, his hands curled in a fist so tight his knuckles were white
Soon after, Sherlock trotted into the room, wearing a black cowboy hat and a red scarf tied around his neck cowboy style. The detective approached John and knelt beside him.
"No, get on with Mycroft," interrupted the detective, stirring uncomfortably in his chair. "He got all of you a job, and he gave you references".
"Mrs. Hudson, it's Molly," she shouted.
"We have to help her."
"How will he be? Will it stay the same?"
He gently brushed Sherlock's asscheeks with his fingertips, just a ghostly touch that gave him goosebumps were his fingers caressed him. He started at the waist, going down his tail bone, almost reaching his ass's crack. In that triangle of skin, the detective was almost unbearably sensitive. As John's fingers ran over it, Sherlock closed his eyes, bit his lower lip, and moaned, arching his back and wriggling his hips, his cock throbbing hard while he tried to escape from the ghostly touch of John's finger, that inflamed him with desire.
Mycroft cursed to himself. Ironically, it had been he, when Clay was at his command, who taught him to foresee all the unexpected, to have alternative plans in case something didn't go as planned. And Clay did it thoroughly, crawling and infiltrating himself everywhere without any of them noticing. He could read in Clay's crazed look that he wouldn't flinch when it came to carrying out his threat.
The girl looked at him blankly.
"No," he grunted around Anderson's cock, guessing the officer's intentions.
"No, no, Sherlock doesn't guess. He deduces," laughed John, sitting on the couch next to Peter, correcting the word in the article Peter was writing.
"Questions?"
"Let's go play," Sarah asked Rosie, cheering.
They remained silent for a few minutes, all sharing the same thought, but without any of them daring to formulate it. In the end, it was Luke who decided to do it.
"You are an idiot," John murmured, relieved and touched, feeling himself fall even more in love with him, reaffirming, once again, that he was the only one who truly knew that brilliant madman's heart.
"It's no bother. Just... well, if you're not too busy, you can stay and watch it. I usually watch it on the computer, but I'll turn on the TV."
Sensing John’s foot getting ready to kick him again, he dropped the phone on the table.
"John Watson is gone too."
"Sherlock, you have to stop this madness," implored Mycroft. "Don't worry, I will get help."
Sherlock sighed, exasperated, his eyes fixed on the screen.
He covered his mouth with both hands, trying to stifle the sobs that shook his whole body, trying to put himself together, but the pain was too intense, too dense, too real to allow him to stop crying.
Sherlock nodded.
John sat again in the couch, face buried his hands, sobbing. Greg felt sorry for him. No doubt he had suffered a lot, but it wasn’t fair for him to destroy himself in that way.
"Don't be silly. Why are you wearing a blanket, Rosie?
"John, don't, fuck” grunted the detective, his body quivering harder.
Sherlock stopped before giving the next stitch.
“Not as much as you.”
“Stop complaining like a little girl. You like it,” teased John, smacking Sherlock’s arse again. The detective shook his head, but his cock started to get hard again.
"No, we watched Hercules Disney movie with Rosie too many times".
Sherlock smirked. He took a deep breath and stirred on the seat.
"Wait."
"There's no better place. That woman scares even Mycroft Holmes. But call me in case you need something, okay? I don't want to scare you, but now Rosie vanished, they could try to get you, to know where she is."
"Your drug bust will never be the same again," said Mycroft's assistant as she walked to the fireplace and crawled inside.
John wasn't sure about what to say. He didn't want to discourage his daughter, but he was afraid she could get frustrated at not achieving things that could be accomplished only being a genius, as Sherlock was.
"It indicates a route, usually at a point where walkers or hikers can get lost. Sherlock and I used them when we were kids. I was tired of having to look for him in the woods and beaches surrounding Musgrave when he vanished with Victor playing for hours. We agreed he would leave these signs so that I could find him easily. Captain, we're leaving. I'll show you the way."
He looked at John, a mute plead in his eyes
"You can't do it if you're the one who created it.." apostilled Tony.
"Delicious."
Lestrade closed his eyes. He knew Mycroft was playing with the poor man like a cat with a mouse, waiting for the perfect moment to launch the final, fatal, and merciless attack.
"Bring John's gun," she ordered, "until Dimmock come, we will try to hold them, of, though there is little we can do with just two guns".
"Would you like to check the fridge for orange juice?"
"Don't you dare..." started Molly, but fell silent immediately as she heard the girl's footsteps approaching. Oblivious to everything, she threw herself into Mycroft's arms and then into Lestrade's.
"I assure you it would be easier if they were zombies," replied Thor.
Mycroft, worried, asked John to go and check on him. After several hours and as many pints, he told the doctor what upset him so much.
"What the hell is going on?" asked Donovan, looking curiously at Lestrade, Anderson and the rest, who shrugged without answering, all of them blushing slightly
Sherlock was about losing his mind, submitted to the intense but at the same time slow stimulation, that kept him on the verge of the orgasm but didn't allow him to come.
"Sherlock wants to wait a bit until he is more recovered. Although I think it would be better to tell him now, while he still has one arm in a sling. He still hates me."
“I wear the regulatory booties.”
Everett hesitated. He didn't expect a confession so sincere, so passionated. The man was mad, but suffering from unrequited love as much as was himself. Everett wondered if he could also get crazy for lovesick, as Holmes did. The detective's words came genuinely from his heart, were sincere, and, even being his prisoner, Everett felt horrible for playing with the man's feelings. But he had to finish what he started.
“Of course,” the Chief Superintendent answered for her ”for now, however, we cannot make public our advances since that could disrupt the investigation.” He cleared his throat.
A wedding surprise, John and Sherlock's vows, and the wedding dance.
The DI smiled. Amid that pandemic, anything that made people feel good, even those who were most alone, made them forget about fear and put aside anxiety and loneliness, was right. He would deal with John's anger and Sherlock's shock later.
"Yes, it is," replied John mockingly, planting a pair of floured fingers on the detective's blue shirt.
John walked away and got into the black car that would take him to the airport. When they had been rolling for almost half an hour, he remembered that he had left Sherlock's violin in his armchair. He was sure Mycroft's minion would pick Sherlock's things from the flat, but..., he wasn't sure they would be careful enough with Sherlock's most precious treasure. His violin. John closed his eyes, letting the tears roll down his cheeks, and decided to go back to Baker Street, take the violin, give it to Mycroft and never return.
"Because he loved you, idiot" Lestrade answered fondly "And people do crazy things when they are in love" he whispered.
"Now, we have to prepare the dough."
“Mycroft, Mr. and Mrs. Holmes begged her to tell them where Victor was, but she only kept humming that hideous song in response,” continued his husband. “When she started talking about 'drowned Victor', they got terrified, imagining the worst.”
"The night at the restaurant, when you tackled my brother by throwing him on his back to the ground. An enviable style, by the way. You must have been a star at the University. But when he fell backward, many of his wounds reopened. It was excruciating, and he lost a lot of blood once again. I may have been sitting there while he was beaten, but it was you who tortured him again. And not just physically".
Sherlock groaned. He didn't quite understand what was wrong with his body, his brain, or both. He was dying to come, he would give anything to be able to do it, but the feeling of being in John's hands, at his mercy, of totally submitting to him was greater than his desire to come. Pouting, he stood up and waited, hands behind his back, for John to get up.
Another group of officers approached with the fugitives from the dolmen and made all of the prisoners get into the squad cars, on the way to the police station.
"Brilliant, Myc," sighed Lestrade. "At least Sherlock is in good hands," he muttered.
Mycroft turned to look at John.
“I thought Lestrade was here with you”.
The door through which Peter had appeared opened again, and Bruce Banner appeared, ignoring those assembled, and headed for Strange.
Lestrade couldn't believe it.
Sherlock was snapping his fingers in front of his face.
Mike sighed, looking intently at him.
"I thought only Strange could."
"What is this shit?" asked Anderson.
“Still recovering from Sherlock’s hug when we went out from Baker Street yesterday” They both chuckled quietly. “He said he is going to check all the documentation about… “ Mycroft closed his eyes “ rapes that took place fifteen years ago. Maybe we can get something from there”.
"Anthony used to stand behind Clay and make the gesture of hanging himself with a rope, bowing his head and...
"Freak!!!!" Donovan's angry voice was audible from the other side, "Open the door. You could fool Lestrade and Mycroft, but not me. I know you are there with John. I swear I'll be the one putting you in handcuffs in the squad car!".
"We are not the stupid blokes you and Sherlock think. It's time for you to stop playing James Bond and let me do my job".
He was sure that it had been Rosie’s enthusiasm and joy in every activity, which prevented the detective from sulking and complaining about the lack of crimes and blood around him. As well as the nights they spent in the private cove, some involving wild rough sex, others tenderly making love, each one going through the other’s body with soft kisses, caresses, whispering praises and words of love only listened by the sea. Not forgetting the cold cases that Lestrade sent Sherlock on the phone and the detective solved from his deckchair while he pretended to be reading a scientific magazine.
"Please. You control time. All you had to do was wind back that green stone and..." Tony replied.
"Mycroft Holmes' operation is underway," she reported when they picked up the phone on the other end.
"You are a cruel and evil man, John Watson."
Mycroft, his face infinitely sad, nodded.
Lestrade hawked and guided them into the small room where they had found the woman.
Both moaned, and a slow knock of the headboard against the wall started.
“Perfect.”
"First I tried to talk him out of it, then I negotiated, then I argued... until Sherlock advised me to threaten to leave him. Then everything magically disappeared, even the trainee agents."
“I’m not h… ouch!” John kicked him with all his strength, throwing him a warning look.
"Let me come with you. Let's go together."
But in front of these fourteen pairs of eyes fixed on him, his mouth dried up and his brain went blackout.
Lestrade put his hands on Sherlock curls, (God, how many times he wished to do that), and tugged at the detective's hair, making him deep throating his cock and groaning louder at the same time.
"So be it," said the man.
The chief of the mercenaries jumped out of the truck and stepped forward.
“In the Archive, as usual.”
Sherlock complied and lowered his body, letting John's cock finally get inside his arse. John almost dried and tried again to thrusts his hips up, to get deeper inside the detective, unable to do it. Sherlock moved up and down, only letting the head of John's cock inside him and not going any further, clenching his hole around it. The doctor's whole body was trembling. The teasing was devilish, excruciating, but at the same time delicious, sending sparks of pleasure to every millimeter of his body as if every nerve in his body could only transmit one thing: pleasure.
"A bit smug, don't you think?"
The doctor invited Lestrade to approach them with a gesture. The DI quickly stripped himself and sat on the bed on the opposite side to John. Sherlock's body tensed a bit, feeling his proximity.
"And then you'll release him."
“One night, when I was on a night guard, he came to my post and asked me for a cigarette. We started talking and we discover we enjoyed each other company. So, from that day, he came to my post and we talked until dawn. Then I went to sleep while he stayed awake. He was somehow like a dolphin: one of his cerebral hemispheres was still functioning while the other one was sleeping.”
Sherlock smiled.
Someone removed the spreader bar from his feet. A hydraulic motor started working, and the chains moved, separating his legs more than the bars had done, so much so that he did not fall forward just by being restrained by his hands. The chains began to pull him up, so he was sitting in the air, his legs spread, but thanks to the efficient bondage, he did not feel uncomfortable in that position.
“Well, in your books, Sherlock Holmes says the DI with whom he is working is the less stupid one of all the Yard. If you were referring to me, that has to mean something.“ He mocked.
"You are always insulting and bullying him. You hate him. And now, are you complaining because he is not here to save you?" he tried to contain the irritation that flowed through his voice. "You barely believed me. If it had been Sherlock, you would have limited to insult and laugh at him, and, by now, all of you would be dead. So, yes, he thought about saving you even though you don't deserve it. Fortunately for you, he is extremely more good-hearted that all of you together".
Greg showed his badge to the security guards and the two doctors who were with them, one of them with a syringe in his hand. The yarders had come to the ruckus, and Greg asked them to keep the patients, hospital, and security personnel away.
The DI sighed and rubbed his eyes. He didn't want to confront Mrs. Hudson, but neither his boyfriend. However, the law was the law. He looked at Mycroft and then at Mrs. Hudson again.
The fuss in New Scotland Yard was amazing. All his team members had received the message, but Lestrade, considering John's contact list, decided forwarding it to ALL the Yards staff:
"I will guide you. Get this jalopy going. Go on, go on!" she yelled, gesturing exaggeratedly.
Sherlock smiled and nodded.
"Well, that's easy. Return it to its universe, and Everett will be back," decided Steve.
The distorted laughter sounded sinister and dismissive.
They entered the building and got on an elevator that went down to sublevel ten. The doors opened and they appeared in front of a vault door, that was opened without a minimal sound. After crossing it, they walked down a narrow grey corridor, the sound of distant growls filling the air.
"Any news about Sherlock? John?"
"Please, Greg, enlighten us," begged Sherlock, amidst laughter.
"I warned you," said John, standing by to pick up the phone.
Now she was able to see it. She had always thought that Lestrade humbled himself in front of the freak due to his lack of ambition. But it was completely the opposite.
"I don't hate your Daddy."
"They were shocked. They felt guilty, terrified, and lost. When they had to take Eurus away…it was... terrible for them. It was obvious Mycroft and Sherlock needed help, but they were overwhelmed, so the children got by as best or the worst they could. I’m not blaming them. It was really hard for them, especially when Mycroft told them she died, though, in the end, it wasn’t true”.
The screen went black. Sherlock hid his face in his hands, feeling awful as a father, his mind still spinning on his daughter's words. Suddenly, he opened his eyes and lifted his head.
Sherlock moved from the couch to join them, and the three of them performed the sun salutation, all three quickly passing through all the salutation positions until all three were back on their feet. When they finished, they clashed their elbows, one with the other as the five would have clashed in the past.
“I don't indeed but I need something strong. The Chief Superintendent gave me forty eight hours to resolve the case.”
"He saved my life, you idiot."
"I can't; you're not ready."
"John has an old shoulder injury. If I wanted to torture him, I would focus on it. Any blow would hurt him more than on healthy tissue," Sherlock explained.
"They could have done before taking off. No one would have noticed. No one ever looks at them," replied Sholto, referring to the homeless.
"You didn't say anything about this in the rules," gasped Sherlock, when John put his hands on Sherlock's thighs, motioning to make him spread his legs as far apart as possible.
They both stopped, and John grabbed the base of Sherlock's cock, preventing him from coming, as a chocked frustrated noise came out from the detective's mouth, who mumbled something about torturing both of them when they untie him.
An uncomfortable silence followed as the two of them looked around the room.
Lestrade frowned.
"He's where he has to be."
"Come here, love" John turned on the seat and reached out to him.
"Git," smiled Lestrade, walking through another door. On the other side, he found a spacious bathroom with a shower, and next to it, a dressing room with mirrors. He opened the bag and pulled out a two-button black suit. He didn't even want to know what it had cost, but he was sure that many months of his salary in NSY. Accompanied by a dark blue shirt, no tie. Mycroft knew he hated wearing them. He smiled affectionately at the detail. It must have cost him a world not to add it to the set.
Greg was stunned about how beautiful Sherlock was that way, his lips red and swollen after sucking his cock, his hair disheveled and glued to his forefront with sweat, the poor man completely wrecked, all his usual coldness and self-control lost as he was subjected to the most delicious of tortures by John's cock.
"You'll be able to come when you're fucking me."
John looked at him for a few moments. He'd be lying if he said it never crossed his mind to try it, but never felt comfortable with the idea of being helpless, even with Sherlock. Well, at least not the entirety of John, because his cock throbbed in agreement. And he knew he could trust Sherlock completely.
“You are the best camp organizer in the world,” John chuckled, watching Rosie melting at the praise, exactly as Sherlock when John told him he was brilliant.
"That kid is a genius," chuckled Sherlock.
"John, what the hell? How...?"
Molly nodded.
He stood up and approached Sherlock, slowly unbuttoning the detective’s shirt, as Sherlock writhed, trying to avoid the contact of Sebastian's fingers and fighting with the bounds.
Another moan reached the officers’ ears, and both suppressed a wicked giggle. It wasn’t necessary since the detective couldn’t hear them. They were in a van on the other side of Baker Street. They just finished to intercept some suspects’ communications and, when driving in front of the consulting detective’s flat, their equipment caught a signal that, judging from what they were hearing, transmitted everything that happened in the flat.
Both chuckled.
"Yes, I can," refused the elder Holmes, stubborn, "I have to."
Donovan covered her face with her hands. She felt dizzy, frustrated, scared and had the feeling that everything was going from bad to worse. She looked at poor Mycroft, scared like a fawn. Shit. In some parallel universe, Sherlock Holmes was roaring of laughter.
"It has been a true pleasure to have you here. I can never thank you enough for bringing Sherlock back. In every way. When he asked us to prepare the house, we couldn't believe it. He never returned after Victor's disappearance. Too many memories, I'm afraid”.
"We didn't play much with other kids. When we did, being a Latin language, like Spanish or French, Mycroft was able to fluently speak it in less than fifteen minutes".
Sherlock's brother pursed his lips and opened his mouth to assert his authority, but closed it when Lestrade put his hand on his thigh.
Stephen looked at him, gratefully. He was mortified by what happened, so much he began to doubt his ability to be the Sorcerer Supreme.
Sherlock nodded slightly.
"You are very special, Sherlock Holmes."
"And you love it."
"Nothing, nothing. Don't mind me. It's just... nothing," she stood up, dragging the chair tightly, panic reflected on her face. "Sorry I have to go."
“Have you ever worked for the British government?”
As she did so, an opening opened up on the floor, from which several steps started. Rosie went down them quickly, followed by the dominatrix, entering a small room barely one square meter in size. She brought her eye close to an iris reader, and a door opened with a click, giving them access to her panic room. They entered, and the door closed behind them with a buzz.
Everyone quickly looked away when the detective turned to look at them.
"On a wild goose chase."
"Did the freak drug you?" asked Donovan.
“You!” he yelled his voice a mixture of loath, surprise, and fury. Then red light engulfed him, and Moriarty’s body exploded into thousands of itty-bitty-pieces, creating a blast that gobbled the zombies and ghouls, making them dissolve into the reddish cloud.
For Sherlock, being accompanied by several Scotland Yard officers was no guarantee of safety ("
John opened his mouth, but closed it due to Mrs. Hudson's warning look. He did not know why, but that woman made him feel as if he was fourteen years old again and the director had caught him playing truant. He nodded and leaned back in the seat. He waited for Mrs. Hudson to leave to face Donovan again.
Sherlock's legs spasmed. His cock, vibrated wildly inside John as he stroked his own cock, until he came with brutal force, arching his back, his moans matching Sherlock's in volume. John kept riding him through his climax while long strands of come landed on Sherlock's stomach. His body's spasm made his muscles tighten around Sherlock's cock, who, with a piercing shriek, came brutally, moans of pleasure mixed with shouts of pain, the most glorious and pleasurable pain he felt before.
Sherlock chuckled.
"John, please don't make the situation worse," Greg begged from the screen.
"Passing the time, proving a point."
The detective's cheeks were blushed with anticipation, feeling all the eyes focused on him, feeling them hungry for him.
"Sir," interrupted the SAS sergeant, "these men need medical attention, get some food and drink and rest."
"Sherlock, I need you to stay here, taking care of Rosie. And even if I didn't, I know you. Instead of staying by our side, you'd be running around on some dune, getting into God knows what ambush. I can't take care of you and the mission at the same time. I'll be back before you know it"
Without further ado, Mycroft made his way to the truck and Sherlock to his cot. The others looked at each other, puzzled.
He couldn't say anything more. Sherlock madly ran down the dune, shouting John's name at the top of his lungs.
He bit his lower lip.
The girl smiled, reassured, and stepped into the gap. Irene came in later, almost crawling into a squat. She held tightly to the gun and closed the panel.
“Excuse me?” mocked the doctor, his thumbs rubbing around the sleuth’s arsehole.
Sherlock's words echoed over and over in his head.
Sherlock wasn’t comfortable having his personal space, usually so well defended, invaded in that way, but he didn’t want to disappoint Rosie, who now seemed so proud of him. And, in his heart, he couldn’t deny he enjoyed being, for once, part of the group. He only regretted John not being there to see it.
"Mycroft, are you drank?
"Look, Mycroft, I know you are used to bossing your brother around, but I'm not going to let you do the same to my boyfriend."
“Show me the kids.”
He grabbed Sherlock’s hair and pulled back, forcing Sherlock to tilt his head back.
“Oh, it’s in the car. I’ll…”
"And you did all this without realizing how you felt about John?"
The detective smiled fondly and nodded, kissing him again. He frowned, amused.
"Okay, but you have to call me every day," she said, pouting a bit.
"I was by his side through his worst times, while he was detoxing," muttered Lestrade, "while he was going through hell. I never ever saw him like that."
“How?” he muttered. And then he got it. Blind of deadly lust, he didn’t realize he crossed the magical barrier and entered the cell. He looked at Sherlock, kneeled next to John, the detective’s face contorted with grief, both physical and spiritual.
"Oh, yes, it would be great to know our daughter has a bar to slide down to the living room. Reassuring."
Next, a handwritten note from the Chief Superintendent:
“Not without my conductor of light.”
"Understood," he chewed.
Rosie swam up to him and took his hand, guiding him as they followed John. The detective looked at that little hand in his, and followed her meekly, fear forgotten.
Or perhaps it was because of one of the things that secretly most pleasured John was, knowing he was the only able to make Sherlock moan, scream, pant, curse, beg and come while melting him into a cloud of absolute pleasure, a part of him totally unknown for the rest of the world, only unveiled for the doctor.
Answered Sherlock.
Donovan shouted, exasperated, holding the impulse to stomp her feet.
"Hello, Molly," greeted the doctor when the pathologist picked up the phone.
Sherlock smiled.
John emitted a strangled scream, pinned down Sherlock's head, as he continued to thrust brutally, groaning Sherlock's name over and over like a mantra as his orgasm hit him. He pushed his hips one last time, holding them there and came down his throat, while his body shivered with the intensity of the orgasm, increased with the feeling of Sherlock wantonly swallowing every drop of his hot come.
“You should stay with them.”
"Can I take a souvenir photo?" asked Peter, taking his cell phone out of his pocket.
It was he who now chewed in silence, his sight lost on the horizon. Sherlock left him time. He stretched his legs and tilted his head back, letting the sun caress him.
They crowded around to listen behind it, while Mycroft and Sherlock remained on the foyer, completely unsettled
"You are welcome. I'm off to do the paperwork. Don't make too much of a fuss, you both," he joked, closing the door behind him, shaking his head in happy disbelief.
John was so close, an intense orgasm growing inside him, feeling Sherlock's hot mouth around him. In other circumstances, Sherlock would have been getting off himself. But knowing he wasn't able to come pushed John on the verge, his hips moving with a will of his own, furiously fucking the mouth of a complacent Sherlock who held on tightly to the lounger so as not to fall under John's onslaught and to contain the urge to jerk off.
The two melted into a passionate kiss, John wrapping his hand around Sherlock's hair, the detective, embracing the doctor, forgetting everything and everyone, time, space, the past, and the future. Only they existed, the here and now. Almost breathlessly, they undid the kiss, their foreheads together, both lost in each other's eyes until they became aware of their surroundings. They parted, their cheeks reddened.
John rubbed his now extra sensitive nipples with his palms, slowly at first and then increasing his touch's speed and pressure, deliberately building the pleasure within Sherlock's body. The detective moaned harder and louder, whining when John licked one with the tip of his tongue and pinched the other.
"We can't leave her there, Holmes,... if she dies..."
After a few minutes, the taxi driver took a small black device out of the glove compartment, placed it on the dashboard, and pressed a button. A red light came on, blinked several times until it turned green.
"Please don't disappear before the dawn again," Stephen mused, resting his forehead on Everett's, a mute, desperate, and vulnerable plead in his eyes that he closed after speak.
He started the car at full speed. Everett wobbled from side to side in the turns sharpening his ear to identify any familiar sounds that would give him a clue as to where they were going. It was clear that Holmes' only goal was to get him to remember. And if they were in London... He smiled under the hood. Holmes was about to make a mistake. The place they were going would be full of police.
The van sped through the streets of London. It was getting dark, and there were few vehicles left to go to the outskirts like them. Sherlock had an hour's drive ahead of him. There were few Mets cars to be seen, and he was sure that the black van, one of many in London, would go completely unnoticed.
He never loved me. I was just the perfect nerd. All his properties were in my name, all the companies he created to launder money were in my name. I signed, without knowing it, transactions for those launderers, because I thought I was signing stock purchase orders... and everything was happening right under my nose. Those kids were being held in the basement of the house. In the fucking basement of my house. While I was living a life of luxury, those poor devils were rotting there".
Sally’s gaze run through all documentation over Greg’s office and raised an eyebrow.
"Sir…"
"You didn't hit that hard when you were a kid."
"Don't worry, Sherlock. Thanks to you, Molly and Irene, she experienced all this madness in the least traumatic way possible. But she needs time, especially after you and John came back injured" Anthea tried to calm him.
“Doctor Watson, though I admire your trust in my brother, no one in their right mind would have left him alone with … kids,” he shivered at the word as if they were some kind of disgusting bugs.
"That's how that bastard came out," Donovan groaned, "hours and hours of watching him and Holmes was jumping off the roofs like Mary Poppins."
The click of opening a bottle of lube filled the room.
"With all due respect, sir, your brother has not left Baker Street."
Books and folders fell to the ground as Sherlock grabbed one of the shelves over his head with both hands and firmly wrapped his legs around the doctor's waist. He raised his hips while John grabbed his arse, controlling the movement as Sherlock sank on him. They both groaned while John stabbed him with his hot, large, and throbbing cock until he bottomed out.
“The freak has kidnapped Rosie and other children.”
Mrs. Hudson shuddered, remembering the huge workman whom she offered a cup of tea on the day of Sherlock's death. John frowned and clenched his fists, as did Lestrade.
They were barefoot, feet on the coffee table, phones tossed over the floor, eating silently for a while.
“He said focus!” shouted Mind Palace’s Molly, slapping Sherlock’s face, making the detective gasp, swivel on himself, and, of course, focus.
"Welcome. And now, go get some rest. Everything will return to normality. But get upstairs before Mama Bear realizes you're late, and Papa Bear sends all MI6 after you".
Sherlock rubbed his face. He remembered himself on the tarmac, near the plane John was about to take to Afghanistan, wiping furious tears of rage and helplessness.
“Time? We DON’T have TIME, Donovan. Today it’s Wednesday. In four days another murder will be committed, and we’ll be as clueless as we are right now. We need Sherlock. We need him to solve this right now”.
"No. It's ok like it is. Redbeard will always be... a good memory." He looked at Rosie and caressed Milo's head while the dog looked at him with adoration "It's time to leave the past behind. It haunted us for too long".
If John had been looking at his future husband, he would have seen him, for the first time, about to faint with embarrassment, especially with the presence of the Yards. But he wasn't looking at Sherlock. Clenching his fists in an attempt to contain his anger, he fixed his murderous gaze on The Woman, who cynically raised an eyebrow.
(See the end of the chapter for
Sherlock chuckled and turned his attention back to the journal. The DI glanced at John and the rest of soldiers and homeless, animatedly chatting and laughing.
“But… do you know how many people in the world bite their nails?
"You're not thinking of leaving us there and going by yourself, are you?" he asked, raising an eyebrow.
"And on enjoying days on our own, no cases, no time travel, no fuss, just you and me."
Sherlock's desperate voice filled the warehouse.
"For heaven's sake, my name is Sherlock!" barked the detective but let the woman hug him, though he pushed her away when she tried to kiss him on the cheek.
"Here's a trap door," announced one of them. Sherlock closed his eyes, praying John and the others would be down there. Jake and Mark opened it and pointed their guns at the stairs. Not a move: They came down slowly, one after the other.
"Wow, I admit I was expecting something else," chuckled Molly, who feared that Irene would put the child in one of the basement cells that theoretically didn't exist in that building.
"I would trust them with my life."
"There are only four of us?"
"The little girl was so keen to have dumbbells like her parents that the doctor made those for her." explained Martha.
"It seems only the ones with a teddy bear can sleep tonight," replied the nurse, mockingly, in the direction of where John and Sherlock slept.
"I don't think they will make any more trouble than you do. That way, when you're bored, you can take them out for a walk instead of shooting at the wall".
And each time, John shook his head, while the puzzle started to complete in his head. The man wanted him to call Sherlock, force him to go there and surrender to them without resistance. Sherlock was the target, and, as always, he, John Watson, was the fastest way to get to the detective. Mike wasn't alive. He had never been. It had all been a ploy to make John lure the detective.
"What's that?" asked Lestrade, looking at the small mound of stones piled up anyway.
"Don't laugh so much. Next time you'll walk a lot funnier than me," snarled the doctor, leaning carefully on the table.
"Oh, gddddddddd I'm………fuck I'm," and Sherlock came again for the third time, as the others kept on licking and pinching his nipples. John came hard on Sherlock's cock. The two officers that stopped for a bit sucking Sherlock's cock threw themselves to lick John's cum from it, sucking him hard and fast, making the detective growl and beg, writhing madly, as Donovan thrusts grew deeper and harder inside Sherlock, the officers and Lestrade stroke themselves, hypnotized by the vision of the sergeant fucking the detective.
"Sherlock Holmes!" Peter's cry, behind the door that had just opened on his left, startled everyone.
, he repeated to himself, trying to calm and convince himself.
Three hours later, they landed in Heathrow. The detective inhaled deeply. John laughed at the evident craving of London the detective has. They took a cab to Baker Street, where Mrs. Hudson was waiting for them at the door and smiled widely when he saw them. She missed them. Too quiet the flat without them.
"It's a shame we have to owe Mycroft favors to come back here."
"You seem to be in a big hurry," observed the driver and burst into a loud cough, squinting, dazzled by the car's headlights immediately behind them.
John closed his eyes. His balls tensed, and his mind got a bit dizzy. The feeling of long fingers probing his perineum, gently massaging his prostate, while his mouth mixed with Sherlock's devilishly skilled and warm mouth led him was killing him.
“Where did you get this?” Donovan shrieked.
"Is it Myc yet? You're in a hurry, even being separated by the pandemic..." she joked.
"When you... left, I thought of all the missed opportunities, but mostly that I was too coward to do this."
” Sherlock’s voice stated in her head.
"I was thinking."
“Let’s go.”
I know no ways to mince it in love, but directly to say ‘I love you”
Greg came out of the bedroom, and Sherlock started dressing.
"I'll bet you an ice-cream cone we will be on the BBC," whispered Sherlock to Rosie, who laughed, amused.
"It will cost you dearly."
John nodded.
"I would pretend to be an Uber or Cabify."
"Playing the violin."
"Don't worry, you'll be fine. Besides, it's good that you practice. After all, you will soon become a Holmes".
“So, all this time, you weren’t investigating the murder. You were looking for Moran”.
"Well, as I said before, you'll be able to come..."
John grabbed his hand, led him through the door, the wooden floor echoed beneath their feet. They took a few more steps. The doctor stopped and removed the blindfold.
Anderson looked at her, a bit puzzled and shrugged.
"Ohhhhhh god, so gooood," his loud and filthy moans now echoing around the whole warehouse, grunting a bit when John took his fingers out.
"Thanks for warning us. Otherwise, we would have started shouting right into the building," smiled Molly.
He reached a narrow spiral staircase and climbed it in pairs. He must have got one of the turrets. He finally reached the end and entered a square room with small windows that barely let in any light. It was stifling hot, and the air was quite thin.
"Either you put down your weapons, or my men will shoot at the cabin." the chief menaced.
"You won't laugh so hard when the FBI shows up there to arrest you for the kidnapping of John and the murder of four men."
Mycroft opened his eyes wide when Greg increased the intensity of the vibration of his cock rings. The dildo began to vibrate on his prostate, and the clamps vibrated on his nipples. He moaned aloud as his body twisted with the torture of not being able to come while his whole body was stimulated beyond its capacity.
“He is going to kill him” warned Donovan’s voice.
"Do what he says, jump to your feet, and let yourself be done," ordered he in his Captain's voice, with a certain mocking leave.
"Are you with Mrs. Hudson?"
"That was simply fucking great," muttered John, and Sherlock smiled smugly, his eyes still closed.
"I won't disappear. And the Bermuda Triangle thing is..."
“Now? It’s still night time, Papa”.
Sherlock, hands tightly held to the edges of the table, eyes closed, moaned and whined, noticing how the orgasm grew in his abdomen, clenching his teeth trying to control it although, as he well knew, with his cock and ass in John's hands and mouth, it was a losing battle.
Sherlock and John silently looked at each other, both with a smile floating on their lips, eyes full of love, while Rosie looked at them alternately, smiling mischievously.
A military helicopter flew near the windows, and Moriarty stepped down from him, entering the office. All of them shooting at him at the same time, but the bullets seemed to collide with an invisible barrier and fell at Moriarty's feet without reaching him.
"I wasn't planning on coming, but without me, you would be lost in Afghanistan."
"I've already prepared myself, don't worry."
Lestrade chuckled and kissed his lips softly.
"Sherlock is unassailable there, with you and your brother-in-law."
He shouted in a rage, and, picking up momentum, turned them both over, so that he straddled Sherlock and responded with another punch. The detective grabbed his arms, quickly immobilized him, turned his body with force, and rolled them both over Mycroft.
Because if people looked at John as the walking promise of a mind-blowing fuck, the doctor could see all those hungry eyes fixed on the detective's arse, envisioning themselves savagely fucking him on one of the deckchairs, embedded in a wall or lying in the sand. Damned black swim shorts that fitted him like a second skin, accentuating his arse, the contrast with his pale skin, making him even more desirable.
"You will be a good boy now and let me give you something for the pain now?" asked the nurse, smiling, noticing the .general relief.
The sleuth leveraged his advantage and hit the two of them. Then he cut several flexible bush branches and intertwined them to get a kind of strong rope he used to immobilize the fugitives.
"Welcome home, darling. This is going to be soooo funny" Moriarty's laugh echoed the zone.
"Even so," John shook his head "There must be something else."
“There is no fallow deer, isn’t it, Papa?”
Both turned to look at John.
"And you never listen to me. Or are you going to start now?"
Molly burst into laughers. The crowd turned to look at her, puzzled.
The detective was dangerously bordering the end of his tolerance for that social gathering, and soon he would start firing deductions. Sherlock thankfully looked at him, muttered a goodbye, went back to their canopy, lay down on the deckchair, and sighed, enjoying the solitude and silence.
"A pity the wine gets lost in the fabric, don't you think?" John asked as he removed his shorts, throwing it on the sand, exposing Sherlock's hard, leaking, aching for attention, cock.
“Holmes”.
He put the key in the ignition, and, when he was about to turn it, a hand landed on his shoulder, almost giving him a heart attack. So embedded in Rosie and John's words, he didn't realize Jake and Pete were sleeping in the back seat and woke up when he opened the door.
“You cannot deceive my Papa” whispered Rosie in Mike’s ear.
“Which one?”
How Mycroft must have felt all his life made him dizzy and made his stomach shrink. And then he lost the only one who understood him, who loved him, who really saw him. As he thought about it, the image of a devastated Sherlock at John's grave came to his mind, as well as the memory of John after Sherlock's fake death.
"Greg would never do that," replied the sergeant when Sherlock succinctly told her what happened, as they both ran around the docks, looking for John. "He has enough tolerance for alcohol to last for hours without spilling his guts, and he's no snitch."
John could help to laugh again looking at the child, the living image of repentance.
He understood better then the little attention Sherlock paid to day-to-day things like cooking, cleaning, or laundry. Not just because he considered them minor or boring or because he was wasting his intellect doing them. The detective was not used to it. From the time he was born, his house was clean, his food was ready, and his clothes were washed and ironed without any effort, thanks to the cooks, gardeners, and cleaners who worked in Musgrave. And Bart and Geena were determined to keep it that way while they were there. Dangerous. It was too easy to get used to that life and then go back to Baker Street.
The detective, exhausted, looked at him, his gaze followed John's and gasped, trying to move away from the table.
“Did you…?”
The Woman smiled triumphantly in her usual malicious way.
As he did, his gaze fell on the shadow cast by Sherlock's coat behind him. He frowned. Hallucinations didn't cast shadows because they weren't corporeal.
"The best."
The kids nodded bodily, their eyes opened wide, trying to dissipate the darkness and the dim fog that surrounded the wood at night. Sherlock couldn’t help feeling a twinge of guilt, thinking about the kid’s disappointment when they’ll realize there was no fallow deer.
"Great," clapped Bruce "now we only need…"
But instead of untying him, Sherlock got down on all fours over John, so his arse was inches away from John's face, so close and yet so unreachable, and lapped John's soft cock.
Soon, the silhouette of the castle appeared before them. They looked at the detective with disbelief. As Mycroft had said, it was not a medieval castle. But it was still a 15th-century three-story renovated building, from which emerged three turrets with grey roofs in the shape of an inverted cone. The guardhouse (a house of two hundred square meters and a hundred meters of a garden) left the stables to its right. The building was surrounded by a French garden, meadows, woods, and lands.
"Don't be like that," Mrs. Hudson scolded them.
"Beautiful, isn't it?" he whispered.
"God," muttered Sherlock as his hips bucked a bit more, a new orgasm wave running through his body, his head threw back, his eyes wide open, a blush covering his cheeks and chest.
*******
"But John...." begged Sherlock, making the same puppy face as Rosie.
She picked up the phone and dialled it.
Greg admired the pale and slim but athletic body. Since the day they met, Sherlock exerted a strange attraction on him, but, given the detective's rugged nature, the DI never allowed himself to explore it. Now, the vision of that beautiful perfect body made his cock twitch and stiffen. His eyes traveled from the beautiful Cupid's bow of his mouth through his long neck, rested toward Sherlock's pectorals, with his pinkish nipples, and went down to his firm and flat abdomen, rested on his tempting cock and finished running down the long detective's legs until his feet.
"What?! We'd make a killing. I know exactly when he'll get over it. When Rosie finishes college,".
Sherlock couldn't hold his laughter, looking at him as if John were the eighth (for him really the first) wonder of the world.
The detective's mouth made the journey in the opposite direction, emerging from the water and smiling malevolently. He took both of John's ankles, spread his legs apart, looking at his hard cock aching to be touched.
"You saved me," murmured the Sherlock of the present to Stephen, shocked, "You knew this would happen."
"A random portal?"
“I needed to take them from the camp without scaring them. I’ll deal with that later”.
"I have to go. I will explain it to you some other time," replied winking.
The DI raised his eyebrows and informed Mycroft.
"As soon as you wake up.
The detective moaned softly. John smiled in the kiss. He broke it and motioned Sherlock to get on all fours again.
“Why haven’t you say that first?” Donovan got up like a spring. “Let's go.”
“Thanks, Mycroft”.
"Time to say goodbye to papa," announced Molly, and Rosie laughed, waving goodbye to him. Sherlock blinked and smiled.
"Please, Molly," begged Lestrade. If putting out the fires when Sherlock worked with the Yards was challenging, putting out the fires Mycroft created was exhausting.
"Good morning," Geena's voice, accompanied by the cup of coffee she put in his hands, took him out of his thoughts. "Breakfast is ready on the terrace."
He stripped and crawled into the bathtub, groaning at the contact with the warm water. A deep moan filled the place when he finally, finally!, let his hand caress over the shaft of his cock, stroking it slowly up and down, the oily water allowing his hand to rub smoothly, teasing the tip with his palm. Soon, he increased the pace and panted, clenching his eyes while biting his lower lip, arching his back and bucking his hips in an attempt to fuck his fist, until he came with an animalistic groan, splashing water out of the tub while his body wriggled and tensed, his other hand slipping over the tiles looking for someplace to hold to.
Sherlock bit the inside of his cheek.
“John it’s a wonderful father.”
"Come on, Sherlock," he rumbled in the detective's ear. "You were provoking all of us… you know all of them are dying to fuck you, and you are dying to be fuck by them, over and over and over again…, you enjoying their cocks, they playing with your body…".
“Don’t tempt your luck.”
"An idea? By now, he could tell you even their great-great-grandmother's name".
"For the last time, it was not a suicide mission!!!" Mycroft exploded.
“Maybe it's the best you could do.”
What shocked him was the living room covered with packs of different sizes and forms. There should be around fifty of them, surrounding John, his brother, and their friends.
"And I am happy. But I'm a private detective, and the last thing I need is this circus."
John eyes softened and smiled.
Sherlock smiled.
"How...?"
Mycroft sighed.
"You look nervous, captain."
He crawled until he came out from under a shaky Sherlock, who collapsed on the sand. Instead of letting him catch his breath, John motioned him to get on his four again and spun him around until his body was parallel to the shore, water bathing his thighs and splashing his softening dick, the detective shuddering at the unexpected contrast between the cold of the water and the heat of his mouth.
"Horny."
Mycroft appeared at the glass door.
"I couldn't warn you, but I could make all of you stay away from me. Gregory let it slip that you told John about Serbia".
Suddenly, everything fell silent. Disconcerted, Irene watched how the attackers halted the attack, returned to their cars and abandoned the building; in the distance, they listen to police sirens approaching. She doubted that this was what had caused them to retreat and leave their mansion.
