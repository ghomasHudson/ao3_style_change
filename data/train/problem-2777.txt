“I’m sorry about Bella,” Dean sighed while they got inside the car. “She’s been trying to get in my pants for a while. And she’s not the type who gives up, apparently,” Dean snorted.
“Now, let me take a close look at you,” she said to Castiel, peering at his eyes like she wanted to read everything about him inside them.
Dean had had a fling here and there with guys, but had only dated girls. Not because of any convention or hetero normative rule, no. It had just happened that all the guys Dean had been interested in were in the closet, and Lawrence was a small town, and Dean hated to hide who he was. If he was with a guy, he had no problem admitting it to everyone. It just had never happened, Dean and any guy usually didn’t last enough to call it a relationship.
Castiel shrugged. “This is a respectable job, just like any other. Besides, I am grateful for Missouri’s kindness. I don’t want to just leave her.”
Castiel shook his head, so sad he couldn’t even describe. For someone not used to feeling emotions – angels were warriors, feelings were a completely foreign concept to them – he certainly had been feeling a lot of them lately. Maybe because his Grace wasn’t completely there to buffer all the human emotions he had no clue how to fight.
The faint glow illuminated Castiel’s little bedroom slowly. He opened his small wardrobe and started looking for a clean shirt, one that Dean wouldn’t find too horrendous. He liked stripes and Dean didn’t, and more than once Dean had said, joking, that Castiel dressed like his grandfather.
Then, to think it was all Loki’s scam? It makes Dean’s blood boil, makes him angry and… whenever he’s like this, he feels the Mark of Cain burning a little. Like a snake about to pounce on its prey. Waiting for him to fall, to give into the blood lust. But, this time, the blood lust isn’t there.
“Oh my God,” Dean whispered again, voice trembling at the mere thought of Cas in the hands of the red-eyes demon that plagued Dean’s nightmares since that night at the police station.
Dean rolls his eyes. “Come on, you two, lighten up! We’ve been spending these past ten years dealing with the Apocalypse, Heaven, Hell, Purgatory and every other shit there is under the sun. If we wanna celebrate Christmas, we’re entitled to do that, right?”
Dean rolls his eyes and huffs, but he steps into the room. Crap. “Okay,” he mumbles, knowing Bobby is right behind him.
But Crowley didn’t pay attention, and Castiel was too focused on the demon to answer. “You tried, angel,” Crowley went on. “And it would have worked! But me and dear Fergus McLeod here – that’s the meat suit name – we have a pact, and you see, one can only die if the other is dead too. But you, good old fools, you left him alive.”
Castiel finished the ancient words and heard a thunder in the distance. All the lights in the warehouse went out. The windows started to vibrate.
it. In fact, he knew even before he heard his conversation with Sam. It’s evident, in the way Cas looks at him, in the way he stands too close, in the way he does
Dean chuckles, sarcasm evident in his face. “Yeah, because he’s never done that before.” He sighs. “Come on, I’ll make coffee and we’ll start researching. There’s gotta be a solution to your bal – I mean, problem, somewhere.“
? Have you never heard of giving up?” Crowley looked at the devil’s trap he was standing on and rolled his eyes. “This is getting old.”
Leaning on the wall for support, he waits. He needs his strength back now. Determined, he rubs at the Mark of Cain until it’s red and angry, and it starts to glow faintly. “Come on,” Dean mutters, rubbing at it again, until it hurts, until the skin on his arm is swollen. As the glow starts to get stronger, so Dean’s demon juice starts to come back. He starts to feel better, stronger.
But at 11 P.M., when the last client left, Castiel started to worry again. If he had Dean’s number, he would call him, just to know if everything was alright. But he didn’t, and he wouldn’t dare to ask Missouri. The knowing looks she’d been throwing at him and Dean together were at least unsettling, and even if Castiel didn’t understand their reason, they made him feel… exposed, in a way he hadn’t felt before. As if the older woman knew something Castiel didn’t.
Castiel was getting anxious. In no time, the policemen would realize it had been a false alarm, or worse, that it had been on purpose. They would look for intruders and they would find them, all dressed in black, faces covered, stealing the police’s secret archives. Oh God.
He gathered his belongings, not that he had too much and, since he didn’t have a suitcase, he put what he had in a duffel bag he found in the deposit. He wrote Missouri a note thanking her for welcoming him and saying that he was sorry for everything. He also asked her to not tell Dean of his departure. Actually, he
“My brother is gone too,” Gabriel snapped. Then he frowned, looking at his dead brother. “But maybe…” he frowned, appearing to be thinking very hard about something. “I wonder if…” he trailed off.
“And you’re a prude, since when?” Dean asked. “Fuck, Cas, I didn’t… not even when I was drunk. And I owe you no explanation, man, so don’t you dare judging me.”
“They also believed it to be bad luck if two friends don’t kiss under the mistletoe; something to do with the friendship ending.” Cas puts a small bouquet in Dean’s hand. “I don’t want our friendship to end, Dean. You’re my best friend.”
“The burgers are burning, you idjit!” Bobby screams from somewhere, and Dean just looks at Jimmy, gives him a yellow half-smile and leaves, relieved. He never loved the smell of burning burgers so much.
That’s right, they never celebrate normal holidays, because their lives are anything but normal. But an idea is slowly starting to form in his mind. This is the first time he and Sam have something close to a home; some place that’s
When they arrived back in heaven, Dean had no idea where Cas and Rowena went, but on a hunch,  he went to the bunker. Rowena was sitting at the war room, elbows on the table, red hair in disarray, head in hands. She looked shaken.
He takes his time. There are some dirty plates in the sink and he washes them slowly, reveling in the feeling of doing something normal for a change. After making a pot of fresh coffee, Dean pours a mug for himself, another for Sam and goes to the main room again.
It’s annoying, really. Cas built the Roadhouse for Ellen and Jo? That’s great, they more than deserve it, but… he didn’t take the time to see Dean when he arrived?
“Really? Wow, I thought you were a teacher or something like that. A librarian maybe, I don’t know. You strike me as the nerdy type.”
When John called him, Sam agreed to meet his father without much questioning. It was just a meeting like any other – well, almost – but Sam didn’t hate the guy, so he went. John looked tired, worried and almost paranoid, looking around several times as they sat eating lunch at a diner on the other side of the city.
“You knew this.” It’s Castiel’s turn to lose his temper. He grabs Metatron by the collar of his tattered shirt and shakes him. “You knew this, that’s why you gave Sam and Hannah my Grace so easily. You knew we would set the Mark free and unlock the Darkness.”
Castiel closed the door quietly when he left, and the weight of his defeat was so big that it was almost too hard to keep standing. Slowly, he started to walk back home, knowing nothing was going to be alright, ever again.
“Cas went home to his angel family, Sam!” old Dean almost yells. “He’s better off without us. And you know damn well we’re better off without him!”
“Huh… he wasn’t in the living room when I passed on my way here. I thought you and him… never mind.”
"Nope. But I recruited them from Heaven, so they could help me with your reward for freeing me. Of all people, Dean-o, I never thought you would be the one to help me."
Castiel shook his head. “Don’t worry. God does not wish to annihilate the city and its inhabitants. But I can’t tell you anything about my task. Only that I am no danger to anyone. There is someone I need to protect, that is all.”
He let out a thunderous laugh. Stupid, stupid angels. They had put his prison next to a fucking portal to Earth? Or whatever that thing was; it didn’t matter. For ancient creatures, the angels could be so naïve… he would have cried of happiness, had he still a heart.
Death seemed to think for a few seconds. “Give me your Grace first and I’ll see what can be done,” he said finally with disdain.
“Yes, it was. I was one more pawn in the game at first ,but I became the one closest to you. And every time I tried to do something right, I just brought you more grief,” Cas rambles on,  “and if I had just stayed away, maybe things would’ve been easier. All the mistakes I’ve done… all the times I let you down…”
“Humble yourselves, therefore, under the mighty hand of God so that at the proper time He may exalt you.” Gabriel half smiled. “Peter, 5:6. You know, there are lots and lots of misinterpretation in the human’s Bible, but this one they got right. He rewarded you exactly because you don’t think you deserved it. And you know what? Death thinks too highly of himself, Cassie. I believe in due time, Dad will have him reminded of who gives the cards around here.”
“But if things had gone wrong – if, if anyone had seen you there, things would get so much worse, and not only for you, for me too. I told Dean he is forbidden to meddle with my life, ever again.”
"Do not try to fool me!” Death snapped. "Trying to bribe me into accepting another soul in his place! Suggesting I accept the father, whose soul is tainted by adultery!" he yelled, stepping forward so his nose was almost touching the angel's.
But little by little, his tiredness was getting to him, and he could not rely on his Grace to maintain the necessary agility. One knife hit his left flank, and as he bent to the side, with his hand on the bleeding wound, one of the demons passed by him and grabbed Dean, throwing him with ease against the opposite wall.
“Well, thank you, but I’ve been taking care of myself since Dad left. Don’t need anyone to do it for me.”
Cas smiles, the kind of rare smiles that scrunches his nose and wrinkles the corner of his eyes. The smile Dean has never seen in him, except when they’re together, laughing. “I’d like that,” he says. “A lot.”
“Do it,” Dean challenges, but he already knows that Sam won’t have the guts to kill him. And he’s right. Sam sighs and lowers the blade. Smiling, Dean’s eyes turn black and he takes a step in Sam’s direction, ready to –
But before he can even start, Sam comes and opens his door with a heavy bang. He looks… normal, but he stops in front of Dean with huge, frightened eyes. If he notices Dean's been crying, he doesn't say anything.
Miracle jumps on the bed and Dean holds his dog close for a while, taking comfort from his furry best friend. They grew very attached to each other, and so far, no one has come to claim the dog, so Dean is confident he’ll be able to keep it for good. He gets up, getting ready for another day of Sam making breakfast, going for a run, maybe calling Eileen or Jody and Donna. Dean will walk Miracle, maybe. Watch old reruns, make pancakes, even though Sam will complain one shouldn’t eat breakfast food for lunch, and have a tasteless salad, as always. Dean doesn’t care, Miracle will help him with the stack of pancakes. He still needs to finish filling the job application on his desk, but he’s not in a hurry. He has all the time in the world, right? No one is controlling them now, and Jack  sounded like he’d let things run free.
But Cas surprised him, looking at Mary and Sam with a bit of sadness in his eyes. "I was recently...demoted from my previous position in the…  family business. Mrs. Moseley is a friend of one of my brothers and kindly offered me a place to stay." It was clear that Cas wasn’t going to answer anything else about his family. He slowly and politely cleaned his mouth with his napkin, his plate completely empty now. "Thank you for the dinner, Mrs. Winchester. It was delicious."
“Dean!” Cas comes from the kitchen, holding a spatula. Despite wearing an apron – a red one, with a huge ‘
committed those sins, because deep down? Your soul is tainted. Soiled. Dark. And that’s why you belong with me in Hell.”
Lebanon is a small town, and the bunker is in a remote area of the city. So he walks until he finds a gas station and steals the first car he sees, when its owner stops to use the bathroom. He’s not proud of having acquired this ability, but he’s not concerned about this right now, especially when Dean is in danger.
Cas dies and Dean can’t get up, can’t look anywhere except at his wings, frail and broken shadows engraved on the ground. This is it. This time Cas’ death is for good. Dean isn’t ready for this, he can’t deal with this, he needs to get up and pretend he’s not there, kneeling on the ground next to his best friend’s body. His mind is empty and too full at the same time.
It took Dean years to admit to himself that his feelings for Cas go beyond platonic friendship. Dean has never been interested in guys; he’s always been a ladies’ man. But Cas is not really a guy, he’s in a guy’s body, and that’s totally different. Not that Dean cares. He’s way beyond thirty, if people don’t like him, or something about his life, they can go fuck themselves, he’s already given too much of his life so everyone can go on living theirs without a care in the world.
When he woke up to an empty bunker, he realized Dean had played him. Dean knew he would be weak immediately after using his Grace, so he made Castiel use it, and when he slept, Dean ran away. And he took Castiel’s car.
Cas shakes his head no. “Not heaven. Just me. No other angel would follow me down there. But, as you see, I’m a bit hurt and I can’t go on my own. I was thinking that maybe you and Sam could help me.”
Dean looks at Cas, waiting for him to talk, but Cas doesn’t say anything, he just keeps staring. Dean wants to break the stare, but he can’t, because deep down he doesn’t want to break it, and shit, when did things get so complicated?
“You’re awake. Good,” Gabriel said. He was sitting on a chair beside Castiel’s bed. “Feeling better?”
“But they’re there. Look, maybe the little Grace you had, you burned with the fight and that’s it, or maybe it will come back eventually, I don’t know. It’s got to be at least a little bit in you, somewhere, although I can’t feel its presence.  Because you don’t have a soul, since you’re an angel and all, but you’re not an empty shell, that much I can tell you.”
“Fine!” John yelled. ”I was following Sam! I… I just want to be sure you two are safe.” He looked at Castiel, meaningfully, but Dean completely missed that.
Days pass, turning into a week, and nothing’s changed. Every waking hour, Sam is in the library trying to find a cure for Dean.
“We don’t have much time, son,” John says, just like the other ghosts did, and Dean sits up, meaning to follow them. “We need to get going.”
They were alone in the diner – except for the cook – in one of the many late nights when Dean was eating and Cas was cleaning, and they were talking about nothing and everything. Only, today, after Cas admitted he hadn't eaten anything the whole day except for a donut, Dean had made him eat something.
Then the door opened, and there, wearing as little clothing as possible, was Bella Talbot. “I hope I’m not… interrupting anything?” she said with a false smile.
“Keep your hairless monkey quiet, Jessaliel. I’m sure Castiel’s lover would appreciate this one’s company in Purgatory.”
“If I had just obeyed him, none of this would have happened. I would have brought Dean’s soul to Heaven and…”
They crossed the street together, side by side, Dean eyeing Castiel curiously. The man looked fine, refreshed even, for someone who was up so early in the morning. Dean always woke up feeling like shit. And right now his butt hurt from when it hit the sidewalk.
"I wasn't going to say that," Castiel half smiles. "But what you said is true, I know you didn't mean that."
Death, the Pale Horseman, the most powerful of The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse, adjusted his tie and ran his thin hand over the right sleeve of his pristine, black suit. "What took you so long?" He asked.
The creature didn’t answer. Instead, he looked at Castiel with disdain. “My, my, someone was punished…” he laughed again. “You’re still as I remember, Castiel. But you’re not… there’s a big part of you missing. You don’t shine so disgustingly bright as you did when we last met.”
“You should drink it, Dean,” Cas says, sitting up and accepting one mug from Sam. He waits patiently for Dean to sit up too, and he gives him the mug on his hand. “You can drink it, I already cooled it a bit for you.”
so much at Dean, that it made him feel very self-conscious sometimes. Dean had caught Cas staring, more than once, and there was
“Come on, don’t say you never noticed his complete disregard for personal space with you. And he looks at you as if he thinks you hung the moon, man.”
“Only family, of course. Sam, Evelyn and the kids, Charlie and Dorothy, Jody, Claire and her boyfriend, Ed and Harry.”
“No so fast, hotshot. I want to know what you will gain from this. And why you didn’t do it before.”
like you, who have feakin’ wings and lives in Heaven. But I was… I was sincere, goddammit. And I did it all for a lie, for something that wasn't there."
human, wasn’t he? He felt love, pain, pleasure and now fear, like humans did. He was almost as human as any of them; almost as helpless and weak in the face of things he couldn’t control. Just like any human, he had no control over the future; he had no say in what would happen and how. It drove him crazy.
At midnight Sam popped the champagne open and we made a toast. I may have made a fool of myself and cried a little, saying how much I loved all of them. Dean hugged me and said they all love me and they’re really happy I came back. I may have cried a lot more after that.
“What?” Castiel couldn’t believe his ears. Anael had always been the most obedient of them. She was the garrison’s general, a true leader. How could she have fallen?
Castiel gave him a nod, and after a pause, he said, “I don’t require much sleep. Missouri started going home earlier because I don’t mind staying and closing the diner, since I still have to clean it.”
When Metatron made him human, it was the first time Castiel had a heartbeat – not Jimmy’s heartbeat, no, since Jimmy had been gone since Castiel’s first explosion by Raphael’s hands; but
“Dean!” she greeted, patting Dean’s back affectionately. “Can’t say it’s a surprise to find you here, boy. You seem to like my diner very much these days,” she said, winking at Castiel, but he frowned, completely at a loss. If that was a joke, he didn’t understand.
Castiel closed his eyes, resigned. “My blade cannot hurt humans. Only the demons inside them are dead. They will wake up hurt, but alive.”
"The point is that I'm older than you by millennia and, although age isn't a synonym for wisdom... I know what I'm doing. I didn't act on an impulse, not really. I would do it again. I
“I heard you, when you tried to take them out. I’m sorry I couldn’t help, but the plants tend to relocate to whatever room I find myself in.”
He pulled his angel blade from his sleeve and drew a symbol on the ground. It was his name in Enochian, and he felt his Grace flaring inside his chest. Saying the spell was easy enough, and although Dean whispering “
Dean sighed. “I don’t want to sound like a martyr or anything, but… I did break the Ten Commandments.”
He crowds Dean against the nearest wall, not touching, but so close that Dean can feel his warm breath. Dean opens his mouth to speak, even though he has no idea what he’ll say, but Cas doesn’t let him.
Only, he has no idea what to do with this. He’s not sure he’ll ever be ready to – to accept that… well, Cas is a man. One could argue that angels are sexless, and real Cas is a being of light. But he’s in a very male vessel, and a vessel that’s only his, now that Jimmy is dead. So, Cas is a guy. And Dean… Dean is a ladies’ man. He has no idea how to be anything else. He’s a ladies’ man finally admitting he’s… in love with his male best friend.
“Brother, please! Don’t swear, and don’t blaspheme!” Castiel insisted. “I am not in love with Dean. I saw him only five or six times.”
“Sam?” Cas enters the kitchen hesitantly. “I believe I found a way to cure Dean. But I… I need you to help me to tell him. He’s not going to like it.”
Gabriel nodded. “You shouldn’t have trusted the Reaper. Apparently he had no intention of taking your Grace in return for Dean’s life. He just wanted to make you disappear.”
“No… time. Go, p – please.” Castiel closed his eyes again, welcoming the approaching darkness. He was so tired…
So Dean prayed. Every day. Several times a day, even. At first it was really a prayer, but soon he started talking to Cas as if the angel was right there with him. He started telling him about his day, about Sam, Jess, Dad, Mom, Missouri. He asked him to come back if and when he could, and always made sure to add he was still waiting and would always be. It was as if a wave of calm and peace had surrounded him, making him feel strangely comforted, even with no sign of Cas. Dean had accepted that Cas would come back and that was all. The knew he would see the angel again. In the mean time, he prayed.
“Don’t know what you’re missing, boys!” she called while Dean pulled Cas by the arm toward the counter, where he paid the bill. In less than three minutes they were outside, the breeze messing with Cas’ hair even more.
Cas opens his mouth to say something, but he suddenly stops. He closes his eyes and frowns, as if hearing something. “I’m needed elsewhere,” he says. “I have to go.”
“Missy, my doll!” Gabriel greeted, as he and a very uncomfortable Castiel stepped inside the diner, empty at the ungodly hour of five A.M.
Dean’s voice was low, almost tender. “You be more careful next time. You know, knives cut, especially those ones.” It almost sounded as if he was talking to a child.
Now, almost a month later, they were happily settled in a new routine that, to Castiel, was more than perfect. Well, nothing was really new in their routine. Dean still didn’t sleep much, still went to have breakfast and dinner at the diner, still worked with classic cars, and Castiel still used his yellow apron while he helped Victor and Gordon at the diner. Only, now Castiel, always so serious, laughed a lot, and everything seemed better, brighter, and funnier. Maybe Castiel was getting used to being human – well, almost human. Or maybe it was the fact that Dean’s presence made the whole world a better place.
“Please, Metatron. Please.” Sam says gritting his teeth. “We need the Mark of Cain off Dean’s arm. He’s going to die again, and he’ll just keep coming back, as a Knight of Hell, like Cain. Please. You were the scribe of God. You must have been a decent angel at some point. There’s not even the slightest trace of mercy inside you?”
The place seems empty and desolate. Dean is sitting in an armchair, watching an old Christmas movie. Alone. He has a beer in his hand, and on the floor next to him feet, three more bottles, all of them empty, and a plate with half a sandwich.
as a victory that the serious guy beside him, who had apparently lived inside a bubble of work and duty until now, was slowly opening up to life.
“No one is sacrificing anything here,” Dean snapped. “I’m a big boy, and I didn’t ask your opinion. Go back to the diner if you’re so scared and let me plan this thing, because I can’t chicken out now.”
“They have already sent a garrison to look for Crowley. He escaped prison, after all, they want to send him back there.”
Once Sam comes back, Dean tries to put Cas on the couch, because he won’t have hot coffee with a baby on his lap, but Cas wakes up every time and starts whimpering.
“Close your eyes,” Castiel said, looking at the cave’s entrance. The noises were very close now. There was no time to waste. “Remember that I love you.”
“Oh. That is, err… great,” Dean said, at a loss of words. Missouri had the habit of employing stray guys and girls once in a while. They always stayed in the little apartment in the back of the diner. And they always went away. One day they were there, the other day they weren’t anymore. He looked at her worriedly. Did she even know where this guy had come from?
“I didn’t know how to say this without leaving you upset. You were too invested in the whole thing.”
Dean: “I know, but I wish you hadn’t needed to make another sacrifice for us. And… I’m sorry that I told you to leave the bunker, man. You know that asshole made me do it, he said if he left Sam without him being healed, he would die and I just – I couldn’t…”
In fact, Crowley is needy. Dean would pity him if Crowley deserved anyone’s pity. But really, he seems lonely. It almost looks like he never had a friend. He’s always around, always wanting Dean’s opinion about this and that, always speaking with that annoying pompous accent of his. Dean doesn’t want to be Crowley’s new best friend, but it looks like this is exactly what Crowley wants. And what Crowley wants, Crowley gets, right?
“Forget it,” Dean snapped. “If love does to people what it did to Mom and Dad, thanks, but no thanks.”
Mary looks at him tenderly, and Dean’s heart aches so much he thinks he’s gonna start sobbing any minute now. He doesn’t, though. He just stays there, lying on his bed while his mother cups his face with one soft hand. “Hi, baby. Time to get up.”
The rest of the dinner went smoothly, Castiel managing to take the conversation away from himself. They talked about Dean’s childhood, and the pranks Dean and Sam liked to pull on their Uncle Bobby. He wasn’t their uncle for real, just John’s best friend, but he had always been there for the boys when their own dad wasn’t.
“Fuck this. And fuck ya, Cas! Nobody cares that ya broken! I don’t care, so just leave me alone, ‘kay? I’m waiting for someone.”
Then Castiel plunged the knife in his own chest and screamed, feeling his insides melting in searing pain and agony. He started to shine again, but this time it was a lot brighter; there was light coming from his eyes, his nose, his mouth, the tips of his fingers. “My Grace is yours now. Collect it and bring Dean back,” he whispered. Then he started to scream in agony.
Castiel hadn’t known who was the one possessing Sam, until he put his hand on Sam’s forehead. But by then, he needed to expel him from Sam because Gadreel had almost killed Kevin, and who knows what else he was capable of doing. He had already made sure Dean kept Castiel away from the bunker, so he wouldn’t get caught.
They stood side by side, facing the black tree, and together, they started chanting in Latin. Suddenly, a lighting fell on the tree, right in the middle of it, dividing it in two parts. And between the two halves there was a black space that seemed to emanate a foul smell; the smell of pure evil.
During the torture sessions, while Crowley avidly watched, his face alive with expectation, Castiel had never made a single sound. No whimper, no moaning, not even a heavy breath had left his lips as his flesh was being torn apart. He knew that his behavior frustrated Crowley immensely, and there was a strange pleasure in knowing he was going to die without giving his enemy the victory of seeing him beg.
For a few minutes, they managed to fight next to where Cas was, protecting the unconscious angel a bit, but soon the demons dragged them away from him and he was left there on the floor, alone and unprotected.
“It’s okay,” Dean shrugs again. “I’m happy now. And I didn’t want to have gray hair anyway. Been there, done that, didn’t like it.”
Dean was eight years older than Sam and he had always been there to take care of him. When Sam was very little, he wished that Dean was his father, because it was Dean who picked him up at kindergarten, who cooked him lunch and dinner, who helped with his homework, who read to him all the Lord of The Rings books while Mary worked to make ends meet.
“Well, we’re not, so stop saying you don’t deserve to be saved, like it’s your destiny or some shit like that.”
Oh! On top of that, Kelly Kline apparently sees him a lot. In fact, she sees him more than she sees her own son, since Jack is always busy being the almighty and all. How does Dean know? He finds Kelly by chance while walking around, and as soon as she greets him, she asks “Have you seen Castiel yet?” with a knowing smile. He hasn’t, of course. And then she wastes no time telling him how wonderful Cas is for helping Jack with the heaven thing, since her son is young and has a lot to do. Apparently, Cas and Kelly spend a lot of time together, talking. Dean changes the subject and leaves as soon as he can. He is not jealous, of course. Of course not.
“You know what I do. I don’t even want to think what would happen if the guys up there found out.  You know I go to every fallen brother and sister that asks for my help. I help them adapt, I find them a place to live.”
He went home with a spring in his step, thinking that he would take a chance and maybe, if he were lucky, Cas would like him back. Maybe, his nerdy, adorable friend would be more than just a friend.
Castiel buried his hands in his hair in a desperate gesture. “What do I do now?  I can’t leave Dean there!”
He wanted to kill Crowley with his bare hands, wanted to see him suffering and begging for mercy. He wouldn’t give him the chance to live this time; he wouldn’t make the same mistake twice. He called Gabriel again, to ask if he knew of Crowley’s whereabouts, but his brother knew nothing and he couldn’t stay long. All he knew was that the garrison that was trying to capture the demon hadn’t found him yet.
Yes, Sam is convinced that Cas’ feelings for Dean are not so unrequited. In his own way, Dean loves Cas back. The fact that Cas is a guy… well, Cas
He knew what was coming next, but when twenty minutes later the familiar pain in his chest begun, he knew Dean had had sex with Bella, and he knew Dean was doomed.
Dean didn’t come with Sam, he went back to the Gas’n Sip place Castiel was working to see if he had gone back there. Again. Because they’d already gone and talked to the owner before, a woman named Nora, but she hadn’t seen Castiel for some time.
“Dean loses his patience, just a little. “Cas! For Jack’s sake!” Then he adds, softly, “I’m trying to kiss you here, so unless you really, really want to stop me, just. Shut. Up.”
, guys. One moment I was in my car, the other in a cell. How do you explain that?” he looked around at them.  “Wait. You guys believe me, don’t you?” Sam asked abruptly, looking at his mother and brother with desperation.
“God, no,” John raised his head, his face a mask of pain and regret. “You must have heard what Dean said the other day. I c – couldn’t come back, after what I did. I was ashamed. I didn’t wanna see Mary and the boys again, because there’s no excuse for my actions. I was young and stupid, and I cheated on my wife. I t – thought it was better to leave them in peace.”
Castiel woke up feeling dizzy again.  He had no idea if it was day or night, or even which day it was. When you’re being tortured, you tend to lose track of time, because you measure it between one torture session and the next, so time seems to pass slower than it really does.
It was overwhelming. Castiel felt as if there was a live wire under his skin, Dean’s hand on his back leaving goose bumps on his flesh, his mouth burning hot, heavy and demanding.
Dean doesn't say anything. He nods in silence, eyes still wide, as if in shock. Castiel only hopes he doesn't lose Dean's friendship forever this time.
No one knows what Gadreel wants. But Dean and Castiel say it can’t be good, because they don’t understand why he tried to kill Kevin. Prophets should be protected, not killed. They think Gadreel is working with someone, but the other angels wouldn’t work with him, maybe they would even tried to kill him if they knew where he was. And, of course he knew that.
the one you hurt the most. If… if she agrees to see you, me and Dean, we will agree on anything she decides.”
“The Dean Winchester we both know would rather die than be consumed by the evil inside him. He gave his life more than one – as you did, Sam – to save the world. I do not believe being a demon is what he really wants.”
“All right, then. I’ll just… um…” Sam walks to the door, because he’s sure Dean will bite his head off for calling Cas to help and 'waste' his mojo again. But Dean is looking at the angel, his eyes soft, almost tender, and
The other man looked at Dean with a deer-in-the-headlights expression. “P – Paradise,” he stuttered.
“Jack wants to build a new section in heaven, and I volunteered. And I, um… I need your assistance.”
Dean was used to Sam’s teasing. His brother had never said anything bad about Dean’s bisexuality; he knew Sam got his back in everything he did. But Sam always teased him whenever he had the chance; especially if good-looking guys were involved.
“Yes,” Cas says, getting up from the bed. Dean’s bed. Where he was laying on. Naked. “I heard him. Sam has a nice voice, Dean, but I don’t think I like it when he’s singing.”
Apparently, Cas had no idea how to get a library card, and Dean volunteered to help him. That was why they were going to Lawrence’s public library, walking side by side in a Friday afternoon.
“Cas!” Dean was at his side in an instant, a hand on his back and the other supporting him. “What’s wrong?”
Then Cas blushes, of all things, gives Dean a small peck on the cheek and leaves the garage as fast as he can.
“What happened, Dean?” Cas asks at some point, because it seems that Cas is always paying attention to Dean’s every move, and Dean knows he’s unusually quiet tonight.
“You don’t have your old healing powers anymore, do you?” Crowley murmured, his face inches from Castiel’s.  “If you do, go ahead. I put this knife through his chest, you kill me, and then you heal him. Simple. Go ahead!” he provoked.
Oh, Sam and Cas, so cute, their friendship. So sweet and annoying, and Dean wants to get the First Blade and stab them both as many times as he can.
“Dean?” The angel immediately thought there was something wrong. He immediately berated himself, for letting his guard down, for enjoying these few weeks with Dean as if he were a normal person, as if he had the
Castiel let out a relieved breath. He was overreacting, which was natural, considering all that had happened with Crowley, but he needed to have better control of himself. The demon and his threats belonged to the past now. “Come,” he said, grabbing Dean’s hand and walking to his room, at the back of the diner.
, when all Dean could think was: he loved Cas. He loved him. He was probably the love of Dean’s fucking life. And if dean didn’t go to him, someone was going to
But hey, the party was great and there was food too! There were pork ribs, mashed potatoes, salad (for Sam, of course), green beans and tuna casserole. And, for desert, we had two pies; one apple, one cherry.
“Look up,” Castiel whispered. And there, on the ceiling, another devil’s trap was painted with beige ink, barely visible, but there nonetheless.
Dean doesn’t have time to retort, because Castiel buries his right hand on him, on his chest, like he did when he was looking for Sam’s soul. Dean screams and thrashes, but he can’t move much, so he keeps screaming.
John speaks first. “As you must have guessed, son, we’re your Ghosts from Christmas Future. We’re here to show two possible futures for you. How your future is going to be, depending on the decisions you make.”
There was only Heaven, and everything was peace and contemplation of the word of his Father. But then, the Lord created Earth and everything that came with it: fauna and flora, sea and sky, day and night. The angels became enraptured by the new creation, and many ventured on Earth to see its peculiarities.
Castiel forced his way inside and closed the door behind him. Dean huffed a breath and went to the sofa – the same sofa where they had first kissed – and sat on it heavily, grabbing an almost empty bottle of beer.
Dean looked around. Maybe the guy had mistaken Dean for someone else? “Um… hi?” he said, when it was clear the man would not move before he answered.
But what Dean regrets the most is that first time, that first night he went to ask for Sam’s help to find John. Because Sam was happy, he had his scholarship, he had Jessica… and Dean changed everything when he showed up. Who knows, maybe Sam would have been able to escape Azazel, maybe not… but Dean considers his fault the fact that Jessica died and that Sam was thrown again in a life he had fought so hard to escape.
One hour later, Dean is sitting on the couch, a heavy book on his lap, ‘Medieval Wicca and Sorcery’, and his eyes already hurt at the too small letters. Great, now he needs glasses? He huffs in annoyance. Sam disappeared to the library with a large mug of coffee. Poor guy. Okay, he laughed at seeing Sam bald, because he takes so much care of his hair. But if said hair doesn’t grow back… it stops being funny and becomes worrying, because the bunker is supposed to be one of the safest places in the world, right? And this means that there’s something there with them. Because Sam wasn’t the only one affected, was he? Dean had a nightmare too, even though his didn’t leave after effects. He thinks he can safely assume that it was more than a nightmare.
“I’ve been told that more than once.” Castiel felt so heavy that he just had to sit down, and the sidewalk was just a good place as any.
“No you don’t. You really don’t.” Dean looked down again. “And you know what else? I fell in love with a guy, a human, for Christ’s sake, a little awkward, but simple and cool, and you’re not him. I don’t know you. There’s nothing real about our story, because you were lying to me all the time.” He gave a small, hysterical laugh, “Fuck, you’re not even a guy! You’re a – a freaking angel and – this is crazy, man. I need to process this in my head, because I feel like I’m gonna go crazy any minute now.”
“Yes, you can!” he insisted, and they went on like that for a bit, Sam pleading and saying he couldn’t, and Castiel insisting he could.
They moved slowly, like one, against each other, a whirlwind of emotions inside Castiel’s heart and an avalanche of sensations in his body. It was like a giant wave, crashing against him, destroying him completely and making him whole again.  It was intense, Dean taking everything from him and giving him everything in return: his mind, his body, everything he was and ever would be. He felt like, if he could have this, if he could have Dean, he would never miss flying, ever again.
, what were they thinking? Dean would never jump on Cas in his own bedroom, while his mother and brother were in the living room! Not that he didn't want Jump Cas. I mean, not that he
They stay in silence for a little while, and Castiel does his best to not look at Dean. It’s not easy, because the way they are on the bed, facing each other, limits Castiel’s field of vision a lot. He looks at the ceiling and follows the small cracks in it. He turns his head to one side and tries to guess where the tiny ant going up the wall is headed. Anything, so he can escape the embarrassment of looking at Dean, after having said things like ‘all I have, all I am, is yours.’ Dear Father in Heaven, he is pathetic.
“Dean, let’s make something clear: I completely disagree with you about this. I think this is one of the worst ideas in the world, and so many things can go wrong I can’t even start thinking about them. This is illegal, not to mention dangerous, stupid and-
homemade burger, and before he started, Dean was going to ask him if he wanted chili sauce with it. So,
Dean snorted humorlessly. “What a bunch of misfits we are. A nerdy guy who works in a diner, an old guy with no job and a fuck up with a GED who works with old cars.”
“What happened?” Dean asks, one hand on Cas’ arm, another on Sam’s shoulder. Then he takes a real look at his brother. “Whoa. Sam. Your hair is back.”
The slap made Castiel flinch. Dean, on the other hand, didn’t move a muscle for a while. John’s face became even redder, but he backed away from Dean one or two steps, breathing heavily.
So yeah, he really, really needs to keep busy at all times, or he’ll go crazy. And, since last week’s show, hunting is not an option right now. According to Sam, it’s not ‘
Metatron looks at Sam for a long time, to the point that Sam gives up and looks at Hannah, shaking his head. “Let’s go,” he says. “It was a waste of time.”
“Cas, Cas, I didn’t mean to kill you, it was the demon, I didn’t want to do any of this. Blood, so much blood, I didn’t know angels bled so much.”
Castiel and Kevin were at the library with the tablet, when one of them mentioned Metatron. Castiel then started to explain that Malachi had planned to join forces with Bartholomew to take back heaven from Metatron, and that we should all expect a huge war and lots of deaths, because they’re angry and they don’t exactly care about their vessels.
He crept slowly from the hole. It was deep, and very, very dark, like a grave, but he had been in worse situations before. This one, though, it was in a place he had never seen. There was a bright light
The diner didn’t open on Mondays, so Castiel spent the day looking for Crowley. Well, looking for John Winchester, in fact, because he wanted to see if Crowley still possessed the man.
Dean woke up with the mother of all hangovers. Again. He had spent the night drinking and playing poker with Benny Lafitte. He didn’t see Benny much, because the guy was all kinds of screwed up and probably never worked, spending most of his nights – and days – drunk as a skunk.
He only realized he had been kissing Cas by his doorstep, giving his neighbors quite a show, when Cas grunted and started pushing him a little so he could close the door. As soon as the door closed, though, Dean’s mind started to cooperate. He didn’t want to talk now, and Cas appeared to agree with him, because they stood there just looking at each other for a while.
Mary looked at Dean, and a silent understanding passed between them. Sam looked from his brother to his mother, feeling that something big was going on, but unable to understand what.
Cas munched on his food slowly and hummed, clearly pleased at its taste, then took a sip of water. "Angelus," he said, after a while.
When Sam leaves, Castiel doesn’t waste any time. He walks right into the Devil’s trap and stops in front of Dean. “This may hurt,” he says.
Sam smiles, relieved. He’ll think about Metatron later. When Dean is cured and Cas is all right, they’ll sit and talk and try to figure out why Metatron helped them, because that’s gotta be a catch. With Metatron, there’s always one.
Now Castiel understood that he had loved Dean since the first moment he saw him. That was why he couldn’t take his life, as ordered. Now the angel knew that, although Death had killed Dean, Castiel was the guilty one. Because Death was ready to make Dean’s soul suffer forever, only to make Castiel pay for rebelling, only because he knew that Castiel would never have peace knowing Dean would be in pain. The angel would have to live forever with that knowledge and that alone would be pure torture for him.
"I'm very glad you consider me your friend, Dean," Cas said, and Dean realized they were very close and they were alone in his bedroom and – wait, Sam had actually chuckled when Dean and Cas left the dining room, and Mary had smirked a little.
“I will,” Cas said from behind them, and hey, apparently a little bit of angel Grace was more than enough, because Cas put his hands over the demon’s faces and they fucking
Dean takes a deep breath and looks around, because suddenly he can’t look at the pictures anymore. His eyes sting, and when he speaks, his voice is hoarse. “Is there any purpose in this? I mean, other than show me Sammy’s a lot tidier than me?”
Castiel took a deep breath and sat on the floor. He had to find a way to stop Crowley. He had to find a way to protect Dean. Because if Dean kept on breaking God’s Commandments like that…
space’ he asked for? I’ve been whispering in his ear the whole day. A suggestion here, another there… I even went to him this morning using a new meat suit, with my broken sports car…he is so, so easy to manipulate.”
So, Christmas comes. Apparently, this is a special time in heaven too.  There’s a party at the park and Dean finds himself in charge of the cheeseburgers. He’s there, by the grill, flipping the patties and making sure they don’t burn. Then Dean sees him.
When John left the garage, it was almost morning, a Tuesday like any other.  There was nothing different in it; the sun was still shining and people were still going to work as they always did. But Castiel’s heart was heavy, and he said goodbye to Dean with a sense of foreboding he couldn’t get rid of.
“He won’t come looking for me or Sam,” Dean said barely repressing his rage. “But Mom’s it’s a whole different thing. I swear, if he makes her cry of if he upsets Sam, I – “
It’s really Cas. “He’s a baby angel,” Dean whispers, mesmerized, trying not to wake him up. He has no idea what they will do once Cas is awake. He doesn’t know how much awareness Cas kept in his actual condition.
This time, Crowley didn’t keep watching, he practically flew onto Castiel and he was right there, in his face. “Gimme the angel blade, idiots!” he yelled to the other demons. And one of them must have disarmed John and kicked the blade in Crowley’s direction, because he snarled at Castiel with the blade in his hand once more.
“You only went to Hell because you sacrificed yourself to save the world! And you were never a demon.”
Dean held Castiel’s hands, intertwining their fingers. “What? Talk to me. I said we would take things slow.”
Castiel picked up the cooking book and started to read aloud. “In a medium bowl, stir together all streusel ingredients except the butter. With a pastry blender or fork, cut in one-fourth cup of butter until the mixture looks like coarse crumbs. Sprinkle over the apples. Place the pie on a cookie sheet in the oven – Dean!”
“This is madness. I won’t let you do this,” Castiel said. “Invasion and theft is against the law, and Dean can end up in jail for that.”
The following days pass in the same pattern. The only difference is that now, every time Castiel feels weak, after curing Dean momentarily, the hunter insists that Castiel stays with him for a little while.
“It's one thing to not reciprocate my sympathies, my… feelings. You have no obligation to do so, and I understand that you don't. But to belittle the way I feel because you think you don't deserve it, is... infuriating, and a disrespect.”
It was only when they reached his bedroom that Dean realized he was holding Cas' hand. He let it go, awkwardly pointing to his bookcase where, instead of books, a huge collection of DVDs was displayed.
As the day goes on, they become more and more frustrated, though. Dean and Cas check all the wards, and everything seems fine. Sam finds several records about how the bunker is the most protected place in the world – at least against supernatural creatures – and nothing goes inside or outside without its residents’ knowledge.
But he couldn’t find the angel. He waited and waited, but he couldn’t find the one who had caused his torment. He knew Castiel was way stronger than him, but strength wasn’t everything. Castiel was an angel. Therefore, all the malice Crowley had, Castiel lacked. Crowley would find a way; he would come up with a plan. All he knew was that Castiel would pay dearly for imprisoning him.
“Castiel, darling,” Missouri said, “be a gentleman and get the groceries I left in the car, will you?”
Dean doesn’t want to die. But as it is, death comes in the most stupid way possible, and he doesn’t want to fight anymore. He’s tired. He doesn’t want Sam to call an ambulance, because it’s not gonna work and he doesn’t want the kid to get his hopes up. The rusty thing inside his lungs hurt like a motherfucker, it’s getting hard to breathe and his mind is fuzzy.
“He was small when Dad left. Doesn’ remember a thing. Doesn’ feel left behind.” He gave a small, humorless laugh. “Didn’ see Mom dyin’ inside.”
“Too late,” Crowley said, triumphantly. “I’ve watched you, Castiel. I know how attached you are to that man. You…love him.” Crowley almost spat the words. “Dean Winchester will die, Castiel, and there is nothing you can do about it.”
Dean was trying to fight and at the same time keep an eye on his angel, because Crowley was still around and no one was keeping him busy. He saw when Jess stabbed a demon in the groin and he fell, howling in pain while she threw holy water on him. Sam was one lucky bastard to have her.
After diner, he hangs some of the plastic icicles and candy canes on the tree. Cas is particularly fond of the stars, and he and Sam start hanging them in a pattern of sizes and colors that would be funny – because Sam is, in fact, a giant girl – if Dean gave a shit about Christmas right now.
“Cas!” he said, his eyes widening, and he fought the pain and tried to sit up. “How – when – where – shit, Cas, what are you doing here?”
Castiel frowns. "Why?" He asks, because he can't think of any reason why he wouldn't want to see Dean. He always wants to see him, talk to him, be close to him. It's embarrassing, even.
It’s late, everyone has gone home. Dean doesn’t have a home to go to, and he really doesn’t care about it right now. He’d be there alone, anyway. He has no idea how much time has passed since he came here, and it’s a bit disorienting. He’s sitting by the pond, where he saw Jimmy earlier. He’d be drinking right now, if he thought it would help him forget. Can you get drunk when you’re dead?
His thoughts feel disconnected from one another, like he’s thinking about everything at once and at the same time, doesn’t want to think about anything.
“Here are your beverages, gentlemen.” Cas arrived with Dean’s coffee and Sam’s latte, making Dean almost jump from his seat. Thankfully, he didn’t seem to have listened their conversation.
Then we decided to have a Star Trek marathon, because it’s fun, okay? And because Castiel had never seen a Star Trek episode in his life.
He feels Castiel’s arms around him, trapping him. He tries to get free, but Cas is stronger. “It’s over,” Cas says, and his raspy, guttural voice feels like daggers inside Dean. His arms feel like fire around him. Dean screams and roars, trying to use as much strength as he can, trying to take everything the Mark of Cain can give him, so he can knock Cas down on his butt, but Cas doesn’t let go. “Dean, it’s over,” he repeats.
Castiel listens to everything in silence, offering a small comment here and there, humbled and grateful for the opportunity to learn so much about his friend.
Gabriel smiled. “Perfect! Cassie, today is your lucky day. I know someone who can help you; an old friend of mine.”
I wonder how Carver Edlund would put this mess in one of his books. A lot of people would hate Castiel, I’m sure. But some of them would hate Dean.
them; she did, and there was always food on their table and a kiss before bed. But she had started to work as a waitress, and because the salary was barely enough, she frequently took extra shifts, leaving Dean to take care of Sam. Of course, sometimes her friends helped, but Dean insisted in taking care of his baby brother by himself. It was
"Hum..." Death mused. "It just occurred to me that… since this man is so... noble as you say, I think I can spare him for a little while."
? Really? What about Mom and Dad? Why didn’t Dean go see them? What about Ellen and Jo, probably right there inside the Roadhouse,  where Bobby was… why didn’t Dean get inside? What about Cas? Isn’t it strange that Cas wasn’t there to welcome him to the afterlife? And… Dean didn’t do anything except wait for his brother for four decades? This is surreal.
That seemed to take Dean out of his stupor, and he patted at Sam’s back. “Hey, calm down, calm down, Sammy. It’ll be alright.”
So Dean would tiptoe to Sam’s room and then to Mom’s. Just to check if she was sleeping. Sometimes, right after the divorce, she took sleeping pills, and Sam would cry and cry at night, so Dean had to get him and sing for him a little. Then, after Sam calmed down, Dean would go to Mom’s room to see if she was still breathing. Just in case. Just to make sure she hadn’t left him too.
Cas is so naïve sometimes that it drives Dean crazy. The way he says that he would follow a demon Dean from afar, even after all his friends were gone… makes something clench inside Dean’s chest. He doesn’t deserve such an open affection. He doesn’t. “Because you can’t!” he says very loud.
“Help me turn him,” he tells Sam, while he cups Dean's face with one hand, willing his Grace to cooperate and sending it Dean's way. He says a few words in Enochain, a prayer, for good measure.
He reached the center of a gray field where great piles of stones were scattered here and there. He stopped, knowing that the Leviathans would reach him soon, but if he didn’t concentrate, he would never be able to feel the connection between him and Dean. And, if he didn’t do it now, he would never find the man.
I fled from the library, telling them I had been there napping and I’d just woken up, and I was hungry and… well, I almost ran from there. I hope at least Dean bought my story.
He wants to kiss Cas, but he doesn’t. That would be taking advantage of him. That’s all right. Where he’s headed to, Dean knows he won’t need any of these memories. Soon they won’t matter anymore.
But Dorothy said adventure needs to be lived, not read about. And I agree with her. Adventure needs to be lived, but it’s not my fault if I spent all my life behind a desk with a computer in my hands and now that I needed to run, hide, shoot and everything in between…I tired easily, I stumbled, I made noise when I shouldn’t… I admit I was always a little clumsy. So, yeah, maybe it was taking a little time for me to get used to this life. Maybe I wasn’t as ready for adventure as I thought I was.
, you know? Because I know you’ll always be there for him. I know I’m not the only person he has; he has you too. I just want to say… thanks, Cas. Thank you for watching over my brother.”
“Hey, Dean!” Sam arrived with Jess in tow. They looked happy, and Dean felt a pang of envy that he hurried to suffocate.
Castiel checked his reflection in the mirror nervously. His white button down and his dark jeans looked too simple compared with Dean’s clothes. But Dean’s eyes widened when he looked at Cas.
Castiel didn’t take his head off Dean’s chest and he didn’t stop crying. He wasn’t ashamed of loving him. His only regret was that he had ever approached Dean Winchester, because he had no doubt he was the reason Dean was dead now. Maybe if he had kept his distance, Dean would still be alive. Death had wanted to teach him a lesson about obedience, and Dean had merely served as a pawn.
But the thing was that… he loved her. She wasn’t fully human, would never be, and who knew if they would ever be able to have children. But Sam didn’t care. He loved her; angel, human, mermaid, he didn’t care. She was good and brave, and she had kicked ass back in the warehouse. He was proud of her.
Well, it wasn’t. And Death itself had joined the party in the end. Sam still didn’t know how he was able to fight them, because he kept thinking ‘this can’t be happening’ and all he wanted was to wake up and find out he was just having a nightmare.
But deep down, I know that the upcoming mess wasn’t the only reason: Sam needed his big brother as much as Dean needed him. Because, at the end of the day, what matters is that they’re brothers, a family, and they should stick together.
When the Angel of Death told Castiel he would be banished from Heaven, without most of his Grace, the angel didn’t know what to expect. But when he woke up naked, in the middle of a forest, unable to fly long distances or to make himself invisible, he knew he needed help. And there was only one that would help someone in his situation.
“I always envied Sam, ya‘ know?” Dean said, after a few minutes of silence. “He always had ever’thing.” For some reason, his speech wasn’t so slurred anymore. “He was spared.”
All he feels right now is confusion and most of all, anger: at himself, at the whole world, and especially, at Sam. Who gave him the right to try to fix Dean? He was great; he was at the top of the world! Now, besides this headache that makes his head feel like it’s splitting in two, he needs to deal with his old and unwelcome human emotions trying to come back.
They took Dean’s body to Jessica’s house. John wouldn’t dare to take his dead son where Mary could see him. They were all waiting to see if Gabriel could do anything. They doubted. Dean was dead, and to Sam that was pretty final. But Jess urged them to have faith. So, they prayed.
“That’s not true!” Sam’s voice brings Dean back from his thoughts. “Dean would be very disappointed if you left, Cas. No, not disappointed, he would be devastated. He cares a lot about you.”
He looks at Sam, who is very red and looking everywhere but at them. “Yes Sam, everything is all right.”
Okay, that was enough. I rubbed mu eyes until they were red and got up from the armchair, trying to look sleepy. “Hey, guys,” I said.
Castiel concentrates and pours Grace into the dark patches, slowly, paying attention to not hurt the pieces that are
“Too many,” Jack answers. “Angels fight aiming to kill, never to just hurt. But he’s going to be alright now.”
“Stop!” Castiel yelled, but the voice continued, and Dean screamed, and Castiel’s heart ached so much he thought it was going to explode. Desperate, he started to call Dean’s name over and over, praying that the pain would stop, but nothing happened.
Dean opens his eyes, gasping for breath, and he sits up so fast he gets a little dizzy. Looking around, he sees he’s still in his bedroom, in his ratty t-shirt and old sweatpants. Was everything a dream? Did he dream that his grandfather’s ghost came to him last night to torture him with his past mistakes? It seems so.
By nine, they were all in silence, while Mary said grace before eating. "Lord, we thank you for this food we are about to receive. We know you are in Heaven with your angels, watching over us. Bless this house and the people who dwell therein, and allow us to live in your love. Amen." Dean noted that Cas was a little uncomfortable when Mary mentioned God and His angels, but he shrugged it off as one of Cas' oddities.
“You better grab the strongest booze we have,” Dean said with a bitter chuckle, eyeing John warily. “I think we’ll need it a lot more than any tea you can make, Mom.”
John eyes Castiel suspiciously, but started talking. “I called your mother today,” he said. “I’ve been calling her these past weeks.”
Cas is sleepy again as soon as his head touches the pillow. Apparently being a baby is tiring, even for angels.
“Don’t.” Dean whispers, giving Cas a half-smile. “This is the most awesome kick-ass wonderful thing someone ever said to me.”
Dean woke up with his whole body aching. For a few seconds, he just remained there, with his eyes closed, breathing deeply. As far as he could tell, there was nothing broken. He was, miraculously, alright. Or, as the case was, he was dead, but the important part was that he was apparently in one piece.
Cas shruggs. “He’s my best friend, Sam. And… I do not believe I could ever part ways with your brother. It’s already hard to get used to the idea that you’re… that
“You’re late,” John said, kneeling beside Dean whose head was cradled in Sam’s lap now. “My son is gone.”
“Wait, wait, wait!” Dean suddenly said, and Castiel’s stomach dropped. “I think you’re making sense, Dad.”
criminals, Cas,” Dean snapped, irritated. But seeing Castiel’s mask askew, he grimaced. “C’mere,” he said softly this time, adjusting the mask on Castiel’s face. “C’mon, Dad and Charlie will arrive any minute now.”
Dean spent half an hour sipping his chocolate and eyeing Castiel suspiciously while Missouri taught the man to use the coffee maker and fetched a new apron for him to use. More than once their eyes met, and Dean had to look away, uncomfortable with Castiel’s piercing gaze.
Rowena has gone back to hell, once her lackeys got rid of all the bodies. Jack went back to the Empty, they’re negotiating Gabriel’s release. Sam, as soon as Cas woke up, remembered he needed to visit Mary and John asap.
But Jess couldn’t stop crying and asking for forgiveness, and Missouri was right there telling him a crazy story about fallen angels coming to work in the diner until she could find a place for them. It was crazy. Surreal. These things didn’t exist, right?
Cas didn’t look like he wanted a milkshake, but he followed Dean willingly, shaking his head good naturedly all the way.
“It’s necessary a huge amount of strength to restrain an angel, even one as weak as Castiel is now, and since no demon has such strength, they will use sigils to restrain him,” Jess said.
Gabriel threw his hands in the air, exasperated. “And here you come with the self sacrifice. Haven’t you get in enough trouble acting like this? How do you think Dean will feel knowing you’re there in his place?”
“Because you have the brightest soul and the biggest heart I’ve ever seen. Because you’re loyal and you try your best in everything you do. Because you think about everyone first and never think about yourself. Because – “
Castiel opened his mouth to speak, but choked on his words, his throat dry and aching. “Dean…” he finally managed, “Leave, this… is a t – trap.”
But Castiel wasn’t listening. At the world ‘married’ the burning in Castiel’s throat and chest got worse and he gasped, everything black for a second.
It’s almost liberating, really. This way nothing hurts. There’s no guilt, there are no feelings or regrets. There’s only blood, blood and more blood. There’s also booze and sex. Hell, everything is great.
He approached Dean’s father slowly, and stopped by his side. “Hello,” he said softly, not wanting to startle the man.
“Dean, I miss her,” John said, running his hands through his hair nervously. “I miss having a family. I miss having a home, someone to return to every night!”
Then, Sam came from the corridor, limping a little, on his way to the kitchen. “You okay, Sammy?” Dean asked, but Sam didn’t even look at him. Dean got so sad that my heart ached for him. I understand that Sam is angry; who wouldn’t? But crap, it’s hard to see them like this.
Sam already knew there wasn’t going to be a Christmas tree or presents for him. Mary had told him that. He was only five, but he tried to accept the fact that they were poor and that Mary hadn’t worked the extra hours she needed for the extra cash to buy him and Dean presents.
At eight thirty he opened the doors. It would be around that time that Dad and Bobby – his business partners – would arrive, bringing with them coffee and pastries that they always insisted Dean took a bite. Sometimes he did, sometimes he didn’t, because if Ash or Chuck got to the pastries before him, there would be nothing left, but Dean didn’t mind. He never ate too much these days.
Two hours later, they were still talking about the films. Sam had arrived from his girlfriend’s house and the three were sitting in the living room with pizza and beer.
“Yeah, because that worked wonderfully in the past. Forget it, Sammy. I don’t wanna braid your hair and show you my diary right now. You go do your yoga, or find your own diary to pour your feelings into. I’ll clean this shit and maybe we can go out for some burgers later?”
“I’m not doing this for you. Dean is like a son to me, and I can see you really love him. So gimme your apron and go.”
“Shut the fuck up!” Dean yelled, his face suddenly very red. “You come here and say you’re a fucking angel, and you expect me to what – to throw myself at your feet? To start praying and singing religious hymns?” He ran his hand through his hair. “This is fucking crazy, you gotta be kidding me,” he gave a humorless laugh.
They stayed in silence for a while, but Castiel could feel John’s eyes on him. He walked to the coffee table and picked up a magazine, flipping through if only to have something to do.
Castiel seemed to understand now, and his eyes widened almost comically. “Oh,” he said, “My apologies.” He got up awkwardly, all bones and angles, and Dean finally could breathe.
He walked to the main street carrying his duffel bag and sat at the bus stop. There were no buses at that hour, and he stayed there for some time, trying to put his thought
“If you’re already emotionally attached to a piece of clothing, I wonder… your attachment to Dean must be even greater,” Gabriel teased.
He looks older. His hair remains short as ever, but he can see silvery reflections in it, especially near the temples. He seems a little chubbier too. He’s wearing… an old bathrobe over dark blue pajamas, and there are slippers beside the chair.
Castiel closed his eyes and took a deep breath, fighting another wave of nausea, even if his broken ribs protested.
“Of course,” Cas says, and he raises his hand to touch Dean’s forehead. Dean grabs his hand and puts it in his own face, like Cas did in the crypt, when he beat the shit out of Dean. Cas frowns, but a second later, Dean is already feeling better.
“I don’t understand why. He thinks it’s alright to sacrifice himself for others, but the contrary is wrong?”
Castiel liked very much that Dean was affectionate, and just like he’d said, Dean didn’t hide that they were together. His mother had actually gone to the diner one afternoon just to tell Castiel how happy she was that they were together.  Sam treated him like a long-time friend, and said once that they were almost brothers now. And Missouri…
“You said you had something to tell me,” Cas says. He’s not looking at Dean, and there’s a slight tremor in his voice, almost as if he’s afraid to know what Dean has to say.
Jess had her eyes fixed on the trench coat too, and she seemed to be hypnotized by it. “Castiel… this is Castiel’s?” Her voice sounded too acute, scared and small.
But more came. Many, many more, and Castiel knew he couldn’t win. Soon there was fire everywhere, because Castiel couldn’t do anything other than try to burn them. The trees all around were on flames now, and it was spreading fast. “Leviathan!” he yelled, and all around him, the other creatures, that until now had remained paralyzed in disbelief, started to run.
Without any effort at all, Gabriel got up with Castiel in his arms. It was almost funny, because Castiel was clearly bigger than him, yet Gabriel held his motionless body like he weighed nothing. “I will be back when I can. If I can.”
Castiel holds Dean’s forearms, bracing himself and looking at the green eyes he loves so much. “What is it, Dean?”
Sam and Jess had also gotten married. They’d decided to anticipate the wedding date and the ceremony had been simple but beautiful. Jess was radiant in her white dress, beautiful like an angel, pun intended. Sam was nervous, sweating in his suit, but his eyes showed everything Dean needed to know: he was completely happy. They were moving to Kansas City in February, Sam’s new job waiting for him.
When he goes back, Bobby is already there, inspecting his room. He makes a face of approval at the pictures he sees displayed on the bedside table, but he greets Dean with impatience. “What took ya so long?”
“Hey, no.” Dean put his hand on Cas’ arm. “If it makes you uncomfortable, you don’t have to say anything.”
of you. I had no idea of how beautiful human beings are, how perfect. You're perfect, Dean. Your soul shines brighter than anything I have ever seen, and even now, I can see the light shining between the shadows within you. I will always thank the fate that put you in my path because you made me experience love for the first time. For the only time, for there will be no other. I will love you forever, until the day I die. And if that day is today, that's fine. Because all I do for you will always be worth it.”
Castiel couldn’t breath. Leaning against the wall, the pain inside his chest was so great that, for a second, he thought he was going to faint. But he didn’t and he took a deep breath to steady himself.
Dean goes on. “You’re a poor excuse for an angel. You’ve never been more than a tool, but now we’re done, you hear me? Maybe without you around, things will start to work out again. I whish I’d never met you.”
“In my defense,” John said, with his mouth full, “I had no idea that Mary was saving all that lasagna for you. I was hungry after a particular busy night, if you get me. That’s why I ate everything.”
It was a shock, finding him inside the bunker, about to smash Sam’s head with a hammer. When he grabbed Dean and immobilized him, he could feel the demon inside him screaming to be set free. The angel in Castiel felt revulsion for the twisted thing in his arms, but Cas, Dean’s friend, ached for the completely changed man. So, he didn’t let go. “It’s over, Dean,” he said.
Dean’s reaction surprised even him. He hid his face in his hands and started to laugh. It was a humorless, creepy laugh, but he couldn’t help it. “This can’t be happening.”
“Ha ha, very funny,” Dean says, adjusting the baby on his lap again. “You’re gonna scare him even more with this voice, asshole.”
“Yeah, and what a great father he is,” Dean snorted. “A father who abandoned her with two small children, Sam was only six months for God’s sake!” Dean looked at her seriously. “You know Mom and Sam are everything to me. I would do anything for them. Shit, if God himself came to Earth to make me choose, I would put them before anything in the world, even Him. I
He felt Dean’s soft lips on his, and there was nothing more in this world besides the feeling of Dean’s lips: no Heaven, no Hell, no Earth. There was nothing more important than the feeling of the kiss and through the touch Castiel could feel Dean’s emotions, a swirl of confusion, excitement and a tenderness so strong that made Castiel want to weep too.
without neither Grace nor soul inside it was too terrifying, and Castiel shook his head, as if to send the thought away.
Castiel took a step back. His blade couldn’t hurt humans. But real knives could. This was Dean’s father, and even if Dean was resentful of him, Castiel would not hurt an innocent.
“Just because I sweep floors, like you said, it doesn’t mean I will be completely useless,” Castiel replied icily. “I’m going with you.”
Sam looks at him and he can tell that something isn’t right, but they’re really out of time. “Where is it, then? Cas’ Grace?” he asks.
The kiss had been everything Castiel didn’t know he wanted. But, boy, did he want it. It had been perfect, because it had come from caring and from genuine emotion, not only physical attraction. Not that Castiel didn’t feel attracted to Dean; it was impossible not to, because Dean was perfect, aesthetically speaking. But it was so much more than beauty, this pull he felt towards Dean. It was more than mere friendship, or desire to protect him.
, he and Dean would be torn to shreds very soon. Dean would suffer and heal, only to be torn to shreds again. And Castiel would die, leaving Dean forever trapped inside this place.
Dean moves his hand, hesitantly, and puts it over Castiel’s heart. It’s a good feeling, the weight and the heat from Dean’s hand, on his chest. Of course he doesn’t say a single word about it.
Again, Dean feels a pang in his chest. Of course Cas feels this way. Dean asked him to leave, didn’t he? When Cas was human and had nowhere to go and no one to help him but Dean and Sam, Dean asked him to leave the bunker so ‘Ezekiel’ could do whatever he wanted with Sammy.
It was Dean’s job to take care of Sammy and Mom, because even though he was eight when Dad left, he was the oldest man in the family.
“Are you, really?” Jack asks. “Happy?” He looks genuinely worried, like he doesn’t already know the answer.
Gabriel had left Castiel’s body safe back in his house on Earth. He didn’t want to have to worry about its safety, because he feared he would have to fight. Or not. It all would depend on what he would find here.
“As you wish,” Castiel said, resigned, promising himself he would try to find Anael next time his duties took him to Earth.
Dean barely had time to answer, because Crowley was already up, holding the knife with his blood on it and, walking with a limp, he advanced on them. In the way, he snapped his fingers and various demons appeared scattered around the place.
“Ecclesiam tuam securi tibi facias libertate servire, te rogamus, audi nos.” John finished for good measure, and the red smoke tried to escape through the window, but Castiel was faster, slashing through it with his blade. The smoke evaporated instantly, with a loud bang noise and a strong wind, and everything went quiet and still.
Only, Missouri never lied. She had helped Mary raise them and she was like a second mother to him. Sam was sure she would never, ever, try to fool him in any way.
“Right now, you are my best friend and the person I wanna be with. So, yeah, it’s important to me that you forgive my sins. Okay? ”
answer. He was overwhelmed with fear, with the realization that Dean’s life was very much finite, and if he broke another Commandment, it would be even closer to its end. Instead, he kissed Dean harder, praying that this wonderful, perfect man would not be harmed.
“About that, Dad…” Dean says, frowning a little, deep in thought. “After you escaped Hell, you disappeared in the cemetery in a flash of white light… you went to Heaven, then?”
“I fixed everything at the police station. Put everything in place. Erased the memory of the poor people the demons used as meat suits, healed all their wounds. Also, all the cops and witnesses; no one remembers a thing.”
Sam suddenly looks uncomfortable. “I, um… I gave it to Jody, Donna and the girls. They did a great job over the years, built a really big net, organized the branches… Claire and Kaia, they’re, like, top hunters in the country now.”
“Okay, Cas, okay,” Dean smiles, happily, pulling Cas to him. “I’ll just leave him here to protect the bunker, alright? And the others can take care of him when we’re not around.”
Dean’s heart is beating fast, about to jump right out of his chest. If this isn’t the most selfless love declaration in the world, Dean doesn’t know what it is. He knows, with everything that he is, that he doesn’t deserve it.
Dean raises his hand to make Cas stop talking. “The thing is… When you said those words to me, and I didn’t say anything… I should’ve said something. I should’ve. Even if it was just ‘
Pain. A mountain of huge stones that needed to be loaded from one side to the other, a pile that never got smaller no matter how many stones you carried. No rest, no food, no sleep. The occasional beast wanting to tear your head off your body. Extreme heat, then extreme cold. Grime and dirt everywhere.
“I’m already dying, Hannah!” Cas sounds exasperated. “Can’t you see? This could work! I don’t know why I haven’t thought of this before!”
Usually, Dean ate a lot. A. Lot. But Sam ate even more, only his food was ‘healthy’, instead of edible. So, Mary's dinners were planned to please her two sons. Today, there was gnocchi casserole, meatballs, Caesar salad, tofu stir-fry and for desert, fruit salad. As always, there was a lot of food.
“I’m an Angel of the Lord,” he said, straightening himself, trying to show all the confidence he didn’t feel.
For a moment, Castiel thought that Crowley had caught Gabriel. But then his heart sank when he realized that, if Crowley’s intention was to break him, there was only one person he could bring to this torment.
“We just… live. We do what we want and see who we want. When Cas built this place for us, ‘cause I said I preferred to work; you know me, I’m no woman to sit still… anyways, he said that the things we’ve always wanted to do, but it was never the right time…”
“Dean…” Jess looked at him apprehensive, as if fearing that he would leave running to save Cas any minute now.
"Fuck, it hurts," Dean moans, clutching at his head with one hand and his chest with the other. He's getting paler by the minute, breathing fast, and it looks like it hurts to even stay awake.
Suddenly, everything around him changed. His closed eyes and his sensitive skin felt the absence of the maddening heat, and he frowned.
Jess bit her lip. “I’ll pray for you. And I’ll pray for Gabriel too, because if he can help you and Castiel, you’ll be fine. The demon is no match for him.”
“Dean is as important as Sam,” Castiel told John angrily. “Would you sacrifice a son to save the other?”
“No one will,” Castiel said with conviction, remembering that Gabriel had taken care of it. He had erased everyone’s memories, hadn’t he? Not that he could tell that to Sam.
“My apologies,” Castiel said, and this time he was the one leaning for another kiss, a soft one. Now there was flour in Dean’s hair too, so that meant they were even.
Dean closes the distance between them and his lips touch Cas’, briefly, softly. There’s no electric current, fireworks, sparks flying, like in the paperback novels Dean will deny forever that he reads once in a while. There’s only this indescribable happiness. There’s this sense of “
John nodded at Dean, determined. “We won’t have much time to plan, this needs to be done as soon as possible. But we have to at least try.”
Dean opens the door and sees… a living room. A very familiar living room, and although he hasn’t seen it for more than thirty years, he knows exactly where he is. “Home…” he whispers, not daring to go any further.
Dean doesn’t even realize how he falls asleep with his head on Cas’ shoulder. He also doesn’t see that Cas carries him to his bed. Most important, though, is the fact that the Mark of Cain doesn’t burn on his arm even once.
Castiel was sure that the demon was responsible for the fight between father and son. But why? Why would a demon posses Dean’s father? What would he creature gain from that?
, he gave Sam one; at least the best he could. Dean needs Sam to tell him he’ll be alright; that Dean can go in peace; that Sam will get a life for himself  after this.
,” he concentrated, trying the connection he hoped would be there, but there was no time, because there was already a group of creatures in front of him. They were human-shaped, black like ink, with twisted and scarred skin that seemed to emanate smoke, black and dense.
His vision turns dark for a few minutes, but not before he sees Dean opening his eyes. It’s with relief that he closes his own eyes and rests.
“The thing is…”Gabriel’s eyes were sad when he looked at Castiel. “There’s nothing I can do. I’m sorry, but… you’re as human as a fallen angel.” Suddenly, Gabriel raised his head and looked to the ceiling, as if he was seeing something. “I’m being called. Gotta go.”
They also find Santa Claus throw pillows, vintage celluloid Santa toys, a few candles, celluloid reindeer and a lot, a
“Then nothing. All I know is that I… I woke up in a cell at the police station. They… they sad I had been in a bar fight and they had found… marijuana in my pockets. B – But I swear, I swear I didn’t do anything!”
Dean kisses him back, his chest almost bursting with joy, with love. And, in his lips, Dean tastes the forever that awaits them.
“All right!” John shouted, and his face was so red that Castiel was afraid the man was going to have a stroke. “I fucked up! I admit! But give me one thing, one reason why I shouldn’t have a second chance! Everyone deserves one! Your mother still loves me, I know she does! Why can’t I have a second chance, Dean?”
“Look, Cassie…the angels fall and Heaven simply doesn’t care about what happens to them anymore. Did you have any idea of what you’d do if you hadn’t prayed for me? I help them because they’re my family. I just think it’s wiser to do it in secret. You never know who could be watching.”
Dean’s mind flashes to that day, in the crypt, when Cas punched him, broke his arm and was about to kill him, because Naomi was making him do it. He remembers Cas’ desperate voice saying ‘
Dean widens his eyes, and the look on his face makes Castiel realize what he just said. He opens his mouth to try to take his words back, but he knows that Dean heard them loud and clear. He gets up as fast as he can, looks at the floor and whispers, "I'm sorry. I... I'm going to call Sam, see if he's already coming back. You must be hungry." And he leaves Dean's bedroom trying hard not to show his utter mortification.
There was a place Dean and Castiel liked to go on most date nights, to simply watch the sky, talking for hours and hours until Dean would be too sleepy to talk anymore and Castiel would take him home. They referred to it as ‘
Her eyes had softened instantly and she had patted his cheek lightly. “Alright. I’m glad we had this conversation.”
“Yeah, but did he tell about Destiel?” Sam goes on with a smirk. " 'Cause those girls read Chuck's books, and if they saw so much "subtext"... there must be some truth in it and..." Sam sighs. "Oh, never mind."
“Do you love Dean Winchester that much, Castiel?” Hannah whispers, and there’s sadness in her voice too.
Dean is nothing like that. For him, money is just a means to an end; a tool, because rich people die the same way poor people do: alone. When it’s your time to go, it doesn’t matter who you are. When the reaper comes for you, there’s nothing you can do. Well, except if you’re Sam and Dean Winchester. Luckily, no one else is.
“I’m entitled to make my own choices, however stupid you think they are. I want to be by your side, in any way you'll have me. Nothing needs to change, you don’t have to do anything. I just... I just want to be near you. To be your friend, and to help you carry as many burdens life throws your way as I can. If you let me.”
. More than eternal happiness, and he feels a bastard for not being satisfied with eternal bliss. But he misses having something to worry about. He misses the bunker. Shit, he even misses hunting, even though thinking about his last hunt gives him chills. But most of all, he misses having Sam, Jack and Cas by his side, the four of them against the world. He misses Cas’ eyerolls, his deadpan lines, his lack of notion about personal space. His hand on Dean’s shoulder,  eyes solemn, glistening –
Dean looks at his brother. Sam looks like shit, his eyes red and tired, his shoulders hunched and his baldness doesn’t look so funny anymore. Cas is a freaking doll, and seeing him so helpless makes Dean’s heart heavy. Since he doesn’t want to examine why, he mumbles some excuse about needing more coffee and goes to the kitchen, where he can take a deep breath and try to calm down a bit. The last thing Sam and Cas need is for Dean to freak out right now. It’s almost six in the morning, and Dean already knows it’s gonna be a long day.
Dean sighs. Yeah, that’s really Bobby; always so soft and affectionate. There’s so much he wants to ask, so much he wants to say, but he ends up saying, “So, why are you here?”
“Gabriel.” Castiel blinked again, and Gabriel’s face came into focus before him. “Why am I here? Where is Dean? Is he alright? I want to see him.”
Castiel stayed motionless, wide eyes looking at the woman while she studied him. She was intimidating, like Gabriel had said, but even he could feel that her soul was kind. The angel decided that if Missouri was good enough to be Gabriel’s friend, she was good enough for him too.
“Dean! I guess you met my new employee, Castiel,” Missouri appeared out of nowhere, patting Dean’s back like she always did. “He just arrived in town, and he needed a job and a place to stay, so he’ll be working here and staying at the room in the back.”
Smiling to himself, Dean stopped at the other side of the street, just outside of his mother’s shop, by the window. Spring was coming and soon he and Sam would have to help Mom rearranging the showcase again. She insisted her boys participated in the ‘family business’, although she knew neither Dean nor Sam would sell flowers. Dean repaired vintage cars and Sam was almost graduating at law school.
“I can’t. There is a profound bond between us; you know that. I can tell when you’re not fine and I know the Mark of Cain is affecting you.“
“You can look at all the pictures in this box,” Bobby said, almost softly. “And in all of them you’ll see you and your brother. Together. He keeps all of these pictures, boy, because you’re his family. You weren’t only his big brother and you know it. You were his father, his mother, his teacher. You were the only constant thing in his life, Dean.”
So now it’s been two days and nothing. It’s like the guy vanished into thin air. What if another angel caught him? What if someone killed him?
“You finished?” Dean asks, angry again, because no one will talk crap about John in front of him. “If you did, get the hell out of here.”
From then on, every door Dean opens is to a different version of Christmas after the fire that killed his mother. Sometimes John is with them, sleeping while Dean tells Sam stories; sometimes they’re at Bobby’s, watching Christmas movies and having pizza. There’s even one Christmas Dean spent by himself, because John was AWOL and Sam was at college. But most of the times, there are only Dean and Sam, alone in a motel room. There’s always Dean, trying to give his brother some semblance of normalcy, sometimes stealing to give Sam things any boy should have on Christmas, like food, presents, safety. There’s always Dean trying to make his father stay with them; trying to make him stop moving them from town to town; trying too keep his family together, but always failing.  And there’s always Sam, angry at John for leaving them, but looking grateful and relieved to have his brother with him.
Gabriel had bought a few clothes for him, explaining he couldn’t wear his black suit and tan trench coat all the time. Missouri had a small room with a bathroom and kitchenette in the back of the diner and she let Castiel stay in it. Gabriel helped him arrange his clothes in the drawers and his new toiletries in the bathroom, explaining patiently how to take a shower and other things a human would do, but giving up when he tried to comb Castiel’s stubborn hair.
Yesterday morning, I put on the Ruby Slippers, hugged Dorothy and Glinda (Yay me!) The slippers give the wearer the ability to travel anywhere they wish to go, so all I had to do was think about the bunker and… voilà.
“Are you kidding me? It’s hot to know I will be the first to-” then Dean stopped, blushing furiously. “I mean, if you want me, that is. I don’t want to assume anything; you don’t have to feel pressured to” –
Mary didn’t seem that surprised to see John. But she only had eyes for Sam in the current situation, and Castiel knew that everything between Mary and John would only be dealt with once Sam’s problem was solved.
He didn’t knock, just went inside the garage, locked the door behind him and went straight to the office, where Dean was sitting behind the desk with a beer in his hand and his head resting on his other arm, his eyes closed.
Castiel put a hand on Dean’s elbow, pulling him to the side. “Dean, this is not the time to fight with Sam. He needs you. Let your father come with us; he just wants to help.”
“You know I don’t sleep much,” Dean retorted, and yawned immediately. “Crap,” he snorted. “Okay, let’s go.”
“Cas, you damn fool,” Dean says, and Castiel buries his face on the crook of Dean’s neck and breathes in. “I’ve got you, it’s all right, you’re all right.”
Jess kneeled in front of him. “Listen to me, Castiel: this is not true. Dean loves you and if he’s drinking and fooling around with this woman is because he’s hurting. It’s his way of dealing with all this. Bella has always been trying to get in his pants, and he never cared much about her.”
“I’m sorry, Castiel.” Hannah shakes her head slightly. “But we arrived too late for Dean. When we got there, he was already a demon again.”
What mattered was that Cas was here, and if the angel had said that he had a plan, then he had a plan, and Dean hoped it would work. Cas had come for him, he had gotten inside freaking Purgatory for him, and if that wasn’t love, Dean didn’t know what else was.
Castiel went to the counter and came back with a pen. He drew a couple of Enochian sigils on a napkin and pushed it on John’s direction. “Here. Put this on your skin. A tattoo would be more appropriate and effective. The demon won’t be able to possess you if you have these symbols on you.”
As always, it was still dark outside, and Castiel looked at the desert street while he cleaned the windows.  He liked these quiet moments, early in the morning, when he could meditate while cleaning the diner. He wondered if Dean had slept the whole night or if he would be coming early to chat, like he frequently did.
Today, I finally found the courage to go to my place and get the rest of my things. Dean said that, since I’ve decided to stay in here, I should stay with them in the bunker. They attract enough crap to get me killed too, and that’s a scary thought. But the bunker is the safest place there is at the moment.
“I mean… I figured this could help other people to solve their… unfinished business, you know?  I solved mine,” he says, looking at Cas, who is talking to Eileen using ASL. He’s really amazing. “If I solved mine, a lot of people can, too. Just – just don’t read it near me, or don’t ask me anything about the things I wrote there. It’s…  I still don’t like chick flick moments, okay?”
But all he could do was stay there, unable to speak, to move, to look away. And the voice went on and on, each word like daggers in Castiel’s heart.
Dean is not stupid. He knows that Crowley’s apparent “friendship” doesn’t come for free. Crowley wants him as his second in command in Hell. Dean also knows that Crowley can go fuck himself, because Dean may be a demon, but he’ll never set foot in Hell again. No sir. One time is more than enough. Especially under Crowley. Eww.
Dean kissed him again, and again, and again. And each kiss was different from the previous one, and maybe Castiel should buy a notebook and categorize and describe all of them? Surely there couldn’t be so many kinds of kisses like that. Perhaps Dean had some kind of power unknown to mankind, – angelkind, in this case – because each kiss made Castiel
“We need archangels, Dean. Heaven is too big, and we need someone with power enough to contain everything while others rebuild. I – I can’t do everything alone, and… we need someone with more power, who’s not Jack, in case he needs to be away for a while. And I – I don’t want more power. We already know how I acted when I had more power than I could deal with. More pride than compassion.”
That gave him strength to fight even harder, and he kicked at the demons, hitting one in the face and the other in the chest. But they were stronger, and they were two, so they pinned him to the floor again.  One of them smiled deviously at him. “Who will save you now, pretty boy?”
Jack blinks and suddenly Cas’ armor is gone. He’s in his old attire – suit, tie, trench coat. Then he puts a hand on Dean’s arm and squeezes a little, forcing him to raise his head and look at him.
“Oh, you had to talk about him and spoil everything, huh?” she laughed again. “But I’m not angry, I swear. And if you don’t talk about Earl again, I’ll let you and your boyfriend take me home, whattya think?”
Of course, no one had told him that. But with Mom always depressed and Sam still a baby, what else could he do? At eight, he already split his time between school, homework, and Sammy.
But he remembers something and raises a hand in warning. “Wait. I need to know you’re really you. There’s been some confusion around here, and someone is playing pranks on Sam… he could be shape shifting into you guys, and…” he shrugs. “I just gotta know.”
Cas is in a golden armor, holding a huge sword, expression solemn. He… glows. Like, there are little sparks of light floating around him. And his wings… wow. Huge, beautiful black wings, making him officially the most amazing creature Dean has ever seen.
Well, except that, for Dean, none of that had happened. He had more money, though, that was true. And if life was indeed a soap opera, this was a good moment for the last chapter, with everyone happy. Only, Dean’s role would be that of the uncle, the bachelor with money, who never brought anyone to the family parties, and all the children would be around him begging for a story about his adventures; stories that always featured him alone doing something funny so the little ones would laugh. The children would love him, the adults would worry about him, and he would smile and say he was fine. And, after the party ended, he would go home. Alone.
When Christmas morning came, Sam didn’t bother to get out of bed. He decided to sleep the whole morning and maybe later go to the park, if it wasn’t too cold. But he hadn’t expected that his brother would change that Christmas morning the way he did.
“Well, the tradition to kiss someone under the mistletoe is in fact a wish of love and peace among friends.”
Dean grabs the box and is about to open it when he sees the small letters on the lid, and then he remembers something: John told him to read the warnings on the box before he opened it!”
Castiel was tied to a metal chair. Iron shackles kept his hands back, and the sigils drawn on them made it impossible for him to break free. A collar with inscriptions as old as the world, in his neck, kept what was left of his Grace trapped deep inside him, so he could not use it, even if it miraculously returned. He was trapped and there was nothing he could do about it.
“So, if… you know, if you wanna go in there and talk to him, I’ll pretend I didn’t see you getting inside.”
So I ask myself what are we going to do now that Castiel is human. Having an angel fighting with us is reassuring, and even though the grace was not his, it was something he could use to protect us, right? He fixed Kevin, saved Sam (and healed the wound I made on his back with the Ruby Slippers).
“You were, believe me. Only, it wasn’t really death; it was a trade. You made a deal, right? You gave something and you should have gained something in return. The moment Death fooled you, it stopped being a trade and your Grace just zapped itself to the Garden. You were a very impressive tree, by the way.”
Dean doesn’t give up. “If you don’t kill me, that is. Because you don’t do anything right, do you? You destroy everything you touch, and now you’re going to destroy me.”
He falls asleep before he can finish the book. When Scrooge is about to meet the Ghost of Christmas Future, Dean closes his eyes and start dreaming.
Sipping his coffee, he remembered his near-death experience from a few minutes ago. Shit, he really was distracted. And Castiel had saved his life. He decided that Castiel wasn’t so bad, after all. For a weird guy.
Sam is yelling at Dean again. But it's Dean's fault, because Sam's brother is stubborn and infuriating and... he drives Sam crazy.
And… damn. That was Dean’s weakness: Cas’ serious, earnest expression, his blue eyes always scrutinizing Dean, like Cas wanted to read his thoughts.
“You mean all those stray people Missouri takes to the diner, that disappear after a few weeks are ex-angels?”
“I know what you’re thinking, boy, and you don’t need to worry. His brother is an old friend of mine, I’m completely safe.”
They looked at each other, Castiel’s cheeks burning at Dean’s words. “Do…Um… do you want to come inside?”
“You completely missed the point here, you know. This was never meant to make you suffer, Dean. It was meant to make you see the truth.”
crap they kept talking about... It’s like John and Mary spoke in riddles. Sam is smart; Sam will help him figure out how Dean believing he’s worth anything will help him get rid of the thing in his arm.
They waited patiently while Castiel ate everything. Dean cleaned the floor and Missouri only opened the diner when they were sure he was alright. Then Dean left for work and Castiel spent the whole day between cleaning tables and serving coffee; before he knew it, it was late night and the diner was closing.
When Monday came, Castiel was driving himself crazy with anxiety. Things were too quiet, and that alone was a signal that something bad was going to happen. Crowley was probably hiding, but Castiel knew he wasn’t going to give up; he had proven it already.
He grabbed Dean’s waist with both hands and pulled, kissing him, because Dean had to understand, he had to. It was bruising and messy, lacking any finesse at all. It was desperate, and frantic, a ‘please don’t leave me, and please try to understand’ kiss.
Hannah sighs. “He was leaving, walking down the road. Not too far. I think he was going to wait for a car to pass on the road and hitchhike. Sam ran after him and, with my help, we trapped him with the handcuffs; the ones with the devil’s trap on them.
There was a moment of silence in which Castiel felt Sam studying him curiously. “You’re strange sometimes, Cas.”
Castiel grabbed Dean’s arm and made him sit on the tattered couch. “Stay here,” he ordered. “I’ll look for the car keys.”
“Hey dad?” Dean narrowed his eyes at Sam. “You’ve been seeing him? ‘Cause you sure don’t look surprised to see him here.”
. God knows what will happen to Cas once he uses all his Grace. Dean is not one bit interested in finding out.
Dean hadn’t called the whole Sunday. So Castiel waited, but didn’t worry. He would need some time for himself too, to summon the demon in an abandoned warehouse he’d found at the other side of the city.
“Cas,” Dean murmured, “You’re killing me. I want you so bad…” He interrupted the kiss only to suck lightly on Castiel’s earlobe, and the angel whimpered, feeling his pants suddenly really tight.
If Dean stops to think about it, being a demon is not that bad. He heals quickly, he can drink the whole bar if he wants to without damaging his liver forever, he can have sex all night long without getting tired, he can get in as much fights as he wants and he always gets the upper hand, and no one, no one messes with him. Not bad for a dead guy, huh?
