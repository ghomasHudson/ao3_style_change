“Payment,” Sherlock says, leaning forward and tilting his head up towards John. “I’ve given you something, and so something of equivalent value is necessary as payment. Too much or too little won’t do, John, or there will be grave consequences.”
He hurries to her bedroom, but a chill runs down his spine and his eyes widen in fear as soon as he steps through the doorway. He feels as though his heart has stopped and for a moment he can’t move; he can only stare, trying frantically to process what he sees. Though it feels like hours in his anxious state, it’s really only a split second of hesitation before he rushes to her bed.
job, one that pays in money and not wishes, and so he goes to an interview the next day for a part time position at a clinic. Frankly, he’s overqualified for the job, but he’ll take what he can get. He doesn’t really want to commit to a full time job, anyway, not with his strange side work with Sherlock.
“Very much,” Sherlock says, smiling. He takes a moment, gathers his courage, thinks about the warm fluttering that’s been in his stomach since John’s moved in and realizes what it means. “I love you,” he says, voice barely above a whisper.
He doesn’t know what he expects, but it’s not for John to make no discernable sounds of movement, for Sherlock himself to lie in fear because he’s unable to deduce what John’s thinking while he’s standing there looking at him, and it’s definitely not for Sherlock to hear rustling fabric sounds, and then to feel John carefully lay the blanket from the back of his own chair over Sherlock’s form while Sherlock is frozen and stunned.
“You sure? You haven’t said anything in a while,” John says, and his eyes are crinkled up in a smile.
“Quite sure,” Sherlock says. “It’s nothing but a consultation; you’d be quite bored. I’m sure you’ll find something to do here instead.”
“Please,” Sherlock says.  His voice is barely a whisper, and John weaves his fingers into Sherlock’s hair and leans down to press their lips together, soft and chaste.
“You could never,” Sherlock murmurs, setting his phone aside. He cradles Iris’ head again, presses a kiss into the exact spot John had kissed earlier. He inhales her warm, clean scent and kisses her again, just because he can.
“‘The present world is dream. Dreams at night are truth,’” Sherlock murmurs when they pull away. A small smile is on his lips, though his eyes are red and the smile is shaky.
John swallows hard. “Coming to get you, you git,” he says, trying for a sense of normalcy. He wants to run to him, wants to take care of him, and wants to take him home. It’s all wrong; Sherlock’s not supposed to ask him any questions. Sherlock’s supposed to
It takes Sherlock a moment to catch up to what John’s talking about, but he realizes John means the window. “Of course,” Sherlock says.
“Is that why you were home schooled with tutors, then? Hogwarts would have been too easy for you?” John asks. “I don’t understand why people say you’re a Squib.”
He plays through it, though, and spends some time in first position, then goes up to second, ignoring the clumsiness of the simple transition between positions he’d mastered over thirty years ago, telling himself it will smooth itself out as he plays.
John pulls away for a moment but can’t bring himself to go far. He keeps his hand on the back of Sherlock’s neck to hold Sherlock’s head in place and he gazes up at him, their faces inches apart, so close that he can see the flecks of gold near Sherlock’s pupils, can count his eyelashes, see every flake of skin on his lips.
The pipe fox, Redbeard, squeaks again, and its tail twitches back and forth against Sherlock’s wrist.
Mycroft gives another tight, insincere smile, but doesn’t say anything, just inclines his head. Sherlock stands and John follows suit, still holding the tube carefully, wondering what’s inside. It’s not particularly heavy, but neither is it particularly light. It makes no sound when he moves it, and he doesn’t get any strange feeling from it, like he would if it were some kind of bad spirit. His curiosity is piqued, and he’s eager to open the tube.
John makes his way to the park on his way home, but his shoulders are hunched and he’s shivering with cold. He coughs, and he doesn’t like the deep barking sound of it; he’s definitely getting a cold. He’s tired, but he’s looking forward to seeing Arthur.
in a way he’s unaccustomed to feeling. It’s almost unsettling, though not in a bad way, and he doesn’t know how to respond, so he simply says, “No, they’re not.”
“Right, okay,” Mary says, still chuckling. “Hello, Billy.” She reaches a hand out, and Sherlock passes the skull over to her. John watches from behind his hand as she examines the skull, smiling and seeming greatly amused.
“Sherlock didn’t explain it to you?” Greg asks. John shakes his head, and Greg nods. “Right. Well, in a way, you’re sleeping,” he says. “You went to bed, and your body is in your bed, but you’re here, too, and so am I, and this is really happening right now, only this isn’t the same roof you think it is.”
this, and so when John comes back and sits beside Sherlock on the couch, Sherlock’s not looking at him.
“Treasure,” Sherlock says. “Do be careful; some of it’s dangerous. Mrs. Hudson, can you bring him down?”
“Oi,” John says, but Sherlock puts a hand on his arm to restrain him.  John looks at him in confusion, but he shakes his head.
He’s desperate for John.  He wants to kiss him, wants to hold him, but the idea of John’s mouth leaving his cock is unthinkable so he does the only thing he can to get close to him: he reaches out blindly until his trembling hand comes in contact with John’s head and he rakes his fingers through John’s short hair, rests his palm there. John moans at the contact and Sherlock feels the vibration around his cock and he shudders, tugging on John’s hair for a moment to hold him still, biting his lip and panting and holding his body as still as he can, his toes clenched, desperation washing over him because he is
And then it happens: a soft, sweet press of lips, just for a moment. John’s lips are soft and dry, and they fit perfectly against his own. It’s over before it’s even begun; just as Sherlock registers the feeling of lips against his own, John is sliding back down, and Sherlock stares at him, stunned, his mind spinning and desperately trying to process this but he realizes he doesn’t have time for that, realizes that this is happening
“Now,” John says, his voice strong and deep. He stares at Moriarty, who is staring back at John in fascination, with uncertainty in his eyes that John’s unaccustomed to seeing. “Get him,” John commands. There is certainty deep inside of him that they’ll obey, certainty born of the strings of fate that have been working long before he was even born, since Sherlock made the wish that would change their lives forever.
“I’ll just make some risotto, then, shall I?” he says to no one in particular, and when three voices chorus back, “Oh God,
John sighs even as a smile overtakes his mouth. He turns and looks up at the sky. “Nothing is ever normal with you, is it?”
Sherlock sighs but he stares at John with intensity before he speaks again, clearly attempting to think of an easier way to explain. “I wished into existence a vision I saw that could have been real or could have been fantasy – there’s no way of knowing, not when you’re divining your own future. Either way, I wished you into existence, John, and I wished into existence the very power that would break Moriarty’s hold over me and rid this world of him – he is
Sherlock stops speaking when John stands up suddenly. His eyes are bright, but his jaw is clenched. So is his fist at his side. Sherlock takes a slight step back, unsure.
, here in 221B. Their strange little family is here, and he scrubs a face over his hand, trying to take it all in.
When he enters the flat, though, Sherlock’s mood doesn’t seem conducive to eating. He’s lying on his back in his dressing gown, smoking his long, unusual pipe. He turns his head and looks at John when he comes in, and John feels distinctly uncomfortable and can’t help but stop and stand awkwardly under Sherlock’s gaze; Sherlock is looking at John in a calculated way and obviously seeing thousands of little facets of his character, life, and day that the average person would miss.
Sherlock has a lot he wants to say about John’s leg, but he’s interrupted by Angelo coming to pour their wine, and then John starts asking about his potions research, and the moment is gone.
Billy chuckles at Sherlock’s comment, and John can’t help but stare at the expressionless skull’s shaking jaw as he does so.
Sherlock smiles at him. “Except you have that,” he says, gesturing towards the tube. He takes his hand away from John’s, and John feels surprisingly bereft.
“I have exceptional hearing,” Billy says, and John wonders exactly what that means before he glances back at Sherlock and the woman beside him.  He stands up in alarm, though, when he sees the woman crouch in front of Sherlock, who is sitting still and watching her with clear interest.  She reaches her arm out to his stomach – only it extends past his flesh until her hand disappears.  It only lasts for a moment, but she reaches in, twists, and then pulls out the cupcake Sherlock had eaten earlier.
washes over him when he sees John’s familiar countenance smiling at him in the doorway, sees the new wrinkles on his face interacting with the old familiar ones, sees the creases in the elbows of his shirt and down near the cuffs he gets from rolling them up while he’s working. He swallows, his throat suddenly dry as a strange warmth washes over him, and turns back to his microscope, his heart pounding.
Sherlock’s heart is beating quickly like a rabbit’s. “I’ve never…it’s never been like this,” he admits. His words are soft, quiet, woven into the air between them.
“It’s a pleasure to meet you, John. I’m Arthur, but you can call me Art; that’s what all my friends used to call me,” Arthur says.
“Oh,” John says. It’s soft, almost reverent. He shifts forward, tucks his knee between Sherlock’s. His leg is warm and heavy and real and Sherlock swallows hard and lets his arm slide around John’s waist, tugging him closer. There are mere centimeters between them, and everywhere John’s skin touches him is warm and real. He can feel John’s breath, feel John’s body expand and contract.
John sighs. He’s a bit tired, to be honest, but he supposes that wherever they go, it’ll probably be exciting, so he fills up his plate and digs in. “And when are we going?” John asks.
“We haven’t,” Sherlock says. He thinks of sitting alone with only the John that lives in his mind palace for company, of watching John get married, of dying for John, of killing for John, of surviving for John. He shakes his head, lets bravery take hold of him, puts his hand on John’s waist. “We haven’t wasted time, John. If we hadn’t – if we hadn’t gone through what we have, this wouldn't be – this wouldn’t be
“I have something very special for you this year,” Uncle Augustus tells Sherlock, crouching down again so they’re on eye level, and Sherlock listens intently, leaning forward so he can focus. “I confess, though, I didn’t make it from scratch. I found it, and I fixed it up for you, but I really think you’ll like it.”
He adjusts his shirtsleeves carefully and straightens a few books as the two sets of footsteps travel up the stairs (curiously, one has a very strong limp, he notices), and clears away the remnants of a questionable potion he’d been working on with a flick of his wrist, just in time to respond to the knock on the door.
Sherlock is like a different person after he’s gotten his way and eaten his share of risotto. Once the aroma of cooking food had begun to fill the kitchen, he’d suddenly risen and gone to the bathroom, and then emerged a good while later, just as dinner was finishing, wearing proper clothes (a suit), his curly hair wet from a shower.
John’s eyes widen for a moment when Moriarty’s finger points straight at John’s chest and he feels a surge of energy from the spirits. They’re coming towards him, and he wonders if this is it, if they’re going to attack him. Redbeard growls, and John squeezes his eyes closed. He’s shivering, freezing cold and nauseous, and he panics when he feels pressure on his shoulders, trying to force him down to the ground. He knows the spirits are confused; they’re used to obeying Moriarty, used to responding to the strongest presence in the room. He remembers what Sherlock told him, though, that the spirits preyed on him because he was weak and couldn’t control the power he so clearly had. He needs to prove to them once and for all he’s strong.
He leaves Redbeard at home, eager to have a day to just himself, but as he’s locking the door to 221B behind him, he can’t help but frown when he looks beside him.
“John,” Sherlock says. He feels as if he’s forgotten how to say anything besides John’s name. There is so much he wants to say, to do, to feel, but he’s overwhelmed. He tightens his hands on John’s waist. He feels vulnerable, unsure, and John brings both hands up to Sherlock’s face, cups it in his hands, steps ever closer until their chests are flush, making Sherlock’s heart beat even faster.
To his surprise, Mike laughs, though not in a way that shows any derision. “Told you he’s brilliant,” Mike says to John, who’s still holding his hand out but now looks quite shocked, if his raised eyebrows are anything to go by.
“Er,” John says, furrowing his brow, wondering if he should lecture Sherlock on the proper ways in which to use furniture. He decides, though, that it’s the least of his worries, all things considered. “Yes?”
John struggles against his hands, limbs flailing, before he manages to make his way to the surface. He gasps and laughs, and then dives for Sherlock, who laughs and dunks underwater, swimming quickly away from John. They chase each other back and forth for a while, their clothes floating awkwardly around their bodies, shoes probably ruined, but John doesn’t mind.
John frowns, feeling suddenly depressed. If things were that simple, he wouldn’t be here in the first place; he never even would have met Sherlock.
“It was really amazing,” Mary says.  She steps away from John, pulling her arm away from his, and shakes Sherlock’s hand.  “Congratulations, Sherlock,” she says.
His eyes suddenly fly open and he holds himself perfectly still when he hears a thunking sound coming from a room nearby. He’d call it the living room, but he can’t be sure this is actually Sherlock’s room, can’t be sure that he’s actually in 221B, not after the bizarre things that have happened to him over the past few days, and not after he’d been so sure 221B had disappeared.
He doesn’t know what he expects, but John holds him closer, his arms warm and strong, and something inside Sherlock is cracking.
When he had been standing outside Appledore, lights flashing around him and his hands raised in surrender, he had known very well that he’d just done something even
“I know that,” John says. He stands up hurriedly, and Sherlock feels frozen when John takes a step closer. “I know that, Sherlock, I
“I’ve waited nearly all my life for this,” Sherlock says. His eyes are still closed, his face turned down towards John’s, his lips so close they brush the corner of John’s mouth when he speaks.
“We have to hold the lantern up to the fruit,” Sherlock says, his voice hushed, as if he doesn’t want to speak too loudly in front of such a powerful presence as the tree before them, which he looks at with a reverence John’s unaccustomed to seeing on his face.
John closes his eyes. His heart is pounding, and he knows Sherlock can feel it, but he doesn’t care. “You’re all I have,” he says. “And all I need.”
John wants to punch him. He wants to punch him and kick him and beat the bloody daylights out of him. But more than that, he wants to grab him, hold him as close as he can, hug him so tight neither of them can breathe, bury his face in Sherlock’s neck, wind his fingers through his hair. The feeling is visceral, burning through his veins. He stares at Sherlock, trapped in this madman’s web, and he takes a step closer, wondering if he can somehow cut the strings.
“Sit down,” Sherlock says. He feels unaccountably nervous. “I’ll make tea. Mrs. Hudson brought up a shepherd’s pie for lunch. Do you want the leftovers for dinner?”
There’s no answer, though, so he frowns and rings the bell again.  There aren’t any lights on inside, which isn’t encouraging.  Nevertheless, he stands still for a moment and waits, hoping she’ll come to the door, but there’s no movement.  His shoulders fall a bit and he feels disappointed and unaccountably embarrassed.  Discouraged, he turns around, but gasps and startles backward when there’s a familiar tall man standing directly behind him.
“Do you think you’re strong?” Moriarty asks him, condescension dripping from his lazy drawl. “You’ve brought the spirits here, but do you really think they’ll obey you? They’re spirits, John; they’re demons and ghosts and terrible creatures. They have no
“Just one question, Sherlock. Did you know from the beginning what would happen to him? And does that mean you know everything that will happen to me?”
John nods. “He – someone has him.” He sucks in a breath; it feels like his chest is constricting, like he can’t breathe. “I have to find him,” he says desperately, feeling his eyes burn. “I don’t know – I don’t know how, I can’t –”
“I appreciate it, Sherlock, of course I do. But you don’t have to – I know I’m in a bit of a state, yeah? But you don’t have to walk on eggshells,” John says. He wants normalcy; he wants Sherlock to drive him round the twist all hours of the day; he wants
this moment, this unreal moment in which he walks in solidarity amongst the very creatures he’s working so hard to stop seeing.
John’s breath catches for just a second as he watches Sherlock cook breakfast, more than enough for both of them. It’s 7 AM, hardly late. Sherlock isn’t looking at him, and John thinks he must be acting more depressed than he realizes if
John blinks. He doesn’t really understand, but he doesn’t expect to. “Why can’t he kill me?” he asks, his heart aching to find Sherlock even as he tries to figure out what Mycroft is explaining to him.
“I see you’ve done your best for Mary,” Sherlock says. “Nicest shoes, pressed trousers, blue shirt that matches your eyes. Well done.”
There hasn’t been a case for days. Sherlock feels the ennui settling in like a shroud; it covers 221B, making the dust that usually sparkles with promise in the sunlight twist itself into useless, heavy sediment, making the laboratory equipment and half-finished experiments nothing but a clutter of useless trash, making the familiar and comforting smells of home cloying and contemptuous. He hates this feeling, especially
“It’ll dry in a few minutes,” Sherlock says. He plops down on the grass, lying back and folding his hands behind his head.
“I don’t think I am, either,” John says a moment later. Sherlock looks at him questioningly, the thread of conversation already lost to him. “Good at this,” John clarifies. “So, we can…” he looks away and his mouth twitches and his eyebrows dip and rise but he looks back at Sherlock with a placid, brave smile. “We can figure it out together, yeah?”
“He’s trapped you all here, hasn’t he?” John says. The low murmur of spirits’ voices is getting stronger, but they’re listening to him, he can feel it. “He’s trapped my –” He pauses and swallows, thinking of Zosima and her kindness. “He’s trapped my most precious treasure, too. I can help you out of the forest. It’s the least I can do; I owe my life to all of you. But please,
The night air is cool around them, and it feels quiet up on the roof, far removed from the traffic below. Sherlock’s fingers are warm on John’s wrists, and John looks up at Sherlock again, about to ask a question, to say something to diffuse the strange tension that’s settled over them, to ask what is supposed to happen next, when Sherlock’s features suddenly sharpen into a focused expression.
“Is he dead?” John asks as calmly as he can, his entire body on edge. He’s desperate to both hear the answer and to
His head hurts and he thinks he’ll be sick. Mummy casts a spell to straighten Mycroft’s robes out on the street, and Sherlock winces, feels it crackle over him, presses closer to Dad, rocks against him.
John blinks, realizing he’d been too wrapped up in his own issues to question that.  “So, he wasn’t waiting, then?” he asks slowly, glancing up at Mycroft for confirmation.
Sherlock takes it reverently, shifting it back and forth a little bit to try and guess what it is. It’s definitely wooden, he confirms, but he can’t be sure exactly what the wood has been turned into. Hastily, he pulls the wrapping off and tosses it on the floor, much to Mummy’s dismay, and a brown box is revealed, like a shoebox but without any writing on it. Sherlock has never seen a box quite like this, and so he’s still not sure what will be inside. Grinning, he pulls the lid off the box, which Mummy takes before he can throw, and he stares in awe at the contents.
“You’re wrong,” John says, putting teabags into their cups and pouring hot water over them. “I think it was rather lucky I met her, to be honest. She’s quite attractive.”
“Sit here,” Mycroft says, pushing John down into his armchair. John closes his eyes and attempts to breathe while Mycroft goes down the hall. He tries to calm down, but his brain is spinning in circles and it’s all he can do to just focus on breathing – in and out, in and out, in and out. He looks up when he hears someone clear his throat, and Mycroft is standing in front of him, holding his hand out towards John. Redbeard is wrapped around Mycroft’s fingers, squeaking frantically, alive and whole and well.
room, and opens the door. Slowly, silently, he pads out into the familiar hallway, his eyes wide and his limbs unstable. He feels as though he can barely stand up, and he can’t let himself believe the voices he hears are real, and yet –
John reaches up with clumsy hands to pull at Sherlock’s arms. Somehow, he manages to get Sherlock’s arms around him, and he collides into Sherlock’s chest, breathing in his familiar scent as sleep pulls him under.
John sighs, turning and going back to the kitchen. Sherlock gets up from the couch and follows, his dressing gown swinging behind him.
“Sherlock,” John says. “Sit down; you’ve just gotten nine stitches. I’ll make the bloody tea.” Sherlock doesn’t reply, and John sighs, rubbing a hand over his face. He goes to the kitchen and stands beside Sherlock.
John frowns. “I was – oh. I was thinking about Moriarty, and I was mad, and then suddenly I was here.”
John gestures Sherlock to stand.  When Sherlock doesn’t, John sighs and goes to him, pulling him up and dragging him over to the woman.  He shoves Sherlock down onto the swing beside her and gives him a warning glare.  Sherlock still looks amused, and John goes back to the fountain to sit beside Billy, crossing his arms in a huff.
After a moment, Sherlock rubs his cheek against John’s hand, and John leans forward, lets his nose ghost alongside Sherlock’s. Sherlock feels the warmth of John’s breath whisper over his lips, and he lets his eyes open, just a fraction, and he can see John’s lips, soft and warm in the glow of the fairy lights, and his eyes flicker between John’s lips and eyes, and then their eyes meet and he lets his eyes close and then it happens so naturally, as naturally as breathing, and their lips meet in a gentle, sweet kiss, soft and tender and perfect and Sherlock feels his heart swell, feels John’s fingers squeeze his own, feels John’s thumb stroke his cheekbone.
“Mummy!” Sherlock complains, and she laughs and lets the familiar weight of her arm curl around his shoulders, urging him out of the kitchen.
Arthur shakes his head and turns to John with a fond smile. He pats John’s arm. “It’s all in the past,” he says. “Don’t worry about it. If he were still alive, though, I’d like to imagine he’d be something like you. You’re a good man, John, I can tell.”
He turns to her, and she looks like she’s about to cry. “Hey,” he says. “Don't cry, alright? Thank you. I really appreciate all you’ve done. I’ll be fine, thanks to you.”
“It’s no trouble,” Mary says.  She gives him a soothing smile.  “No trouble at all.  I hope my ribbons come in handy for whatever it is you’re doing,” she adds, then gives a tremulous smile and closes her door.
“Thank you,” John says, looking at him in a way that makes Sherlock feel as if his heart is going to leap out of his chest. One of the birds nuzzles against John’s jaw.
“Give him back!” Sherlock screams, standing up and reaching for him. Mummy grabs him and holds him, trying to rock him and shush him like he’s a little baby, but he twists and pushes in her arms. “Daddy, give him back!” he pleads.
“No need to thank me,” Sherlock says. “After all, you’ll be paying for it. I’ve added it to your debt.”
John sighs, knowing there’s never a straightforward answer with Sherlock. “Yes. So, can you answer it?”
Sherlock pauses for a moment with his hand on the doorknob, one step into his closet, and he turns back to John. He hesitates, his breath catching, and then his eyes meet John’s for a moment and he’s very serious. “Be careful,” he says. “Don’t do anything stupid.”
“Do you realize how much you’ve done for me, even before my leg?” John asks. He’s still smiling, still talking to Sherlock in that quiet, intimate voice that’s making Sherlock feel like he’s melting.
Sherlock shakes his head immediately, fingers twisting further into John’s jumper, breath coming out in a shuddering gasp, the pleasure of John’s hands against his back equivalent to torture in the way it’s making him
“Baker Street’s a nice place for a bachelor pad,” Arthur muses. “I had some good times there in my youth.”
John swallows shakily and blinks a few times, his heart racing. His stomach twists. “Thank you,” he says, his voice rough. He wants to say so much more; he knows these words aren’t anywhere near adequate, but he’s stunned, unable to express his gratitude.
Sherlock frowns. The night had been magical and beautiful and somehow, he still can’t believe it’s happened. “But what if something happens? What if you turn back into a nutcracker?”
“You’re awake,” Sherlock says. His voice is deep and rumbly, and John smiles fondly, knowing Sherlock has been sleeping, too.
Sherlock opens his eyes and looks at John. From this close, John can count Sherlock’s eyelashes, can see every speck of color in his eyes, every pore in his skin. It’s mesmerizing, it really is.
“When I was younger, a lot of Healers came to try to figure out what was wrong with my magic,” he says. “Most of them were idiots, and had nothing useful to say.”
“If you want me to go, I will,” Sherlock volunteers, eyeing John shrewdly; he’d been going for the last few weeks, after all.
“Of course you do,” the woman says. Her voice is soothing. “You’ll find him, I know you will. But you need to rest for a little while. You’re of no use to him like this.”
“No,” she says, and she’s smiling, but it doesn’t reach her eyes. “You’ve got the most important bits down.”
“John,” Sherlock says anxiously as soon as the suspect is down, turning to John, his eyes wild and the fallen suspect forgotten. “John, are you hurt?” His eyes are moving frantically over John’s body, and he steps closer, patting him down.
Sherlock’s heart skips a beat. He smiles, pleased at the thought that they will do this again. John’s thumb brushes over the corner of his curled lip, and he wants to keep this moment forever.
Greg grins and takes a drag of his cigarette again. He blows the smoke out slowly. “Sorry, John. You’ll find out eventually,” he says. “Anyway, I have a lot of knowledge about the history and rules of the kinds of magic we use. That’s why I’m useful to Sherlock; when he first started out, he had a lot of questions about how to balance wishes and their payment, things like that.”
Sherlock’s answering small smile is so warm, his face sculpted in the flickering shadows of the lantern’s light, that John swallows against the emotion rising unexpectedly in his chest, suddenly very aware of their hands on the handle of the lantern. “You’ll see,” Sherlock says, his voice rich and dark, but hushed.
When they get inside, John goes to the kitchen and says he’ll get them drinks while Sherlock sits in his chair, head fuzzy and warm, smiling absently in the direction of John’s chair until John comes back and hands him a glass of wine.
“Will you come up here?” John asks, and Sherlock hears the words in his brain, recognizes there’s something he’s supposed to do, but his limbs feel heavy and sluggish, as if they’re out of his control, and he’s not sure he can do that, and he feels his breath speed up and hitch, feels something like panic skitter over his skin, but then John’s fingers are sliding up and down the back of his head again and he finds himself calming as he listens to John’s murmur of, “it’s alright, it’s alright, you can stay there, it’s alright, you’re so good, stay there,” until he is pliant against John once more.
“We’ve still got more to do, we really shouldn’t linger,” Sherlock says with a tight smile, turning away from John to swim towards the shore. “Shall we go?”
“Of course, I’m not sure why you’re surprised. Terrible things happen to those who attempt to divine their own futures,” Sherlock says. He takes John’s tote bag from the day before, puts a bottle of wine in it, and then grabs Billy. “Let’s go,” he says.
John doesn’t turn around. He continues out the door and goes down the stairs, pulse still pounding in his ears, questions swimming in his mind, fears fighting for purchase in his heart.
Though the words are simple, they make something in Sherlock’s heart break open, make something inside him come alive. He feels warmth in his sinuses and he closes his eyes under the weight of John’s statement, breathing deeply for a minute, the words hitting him like a brick. He forces himself to breathe deeply, to save this reaction for later, to focus on John.
Sherlock does, shifting his hips and tugging the waist of his pajamas down just enough to free his cock, then lets himself curl back against John, nuzzles against his knee. “Good,” John says. “You’re doing so well,” he adds. He tugs on Sherlock’s hair and Sherlock lets his hand move faster, lets sensation wash over him, feels a tightening in his stomach and limbs that feels delicious.
“It wasn’t hard,” Sherlock says, shrugging. “Not for me, anyway. The process is actually quite fascinating; I’ll have to explain –”
“Alright,” Sherlock says after a moment. He looks down at his notes again, still uninterested in their contents. John is surprising.
“Molly doesn’t expect payment of any kind,” Sherlock says. “But I know the importance of maintaining balance, so I make sure to keep our interactions level. Otherwise, the consequences could be terrible.”
- but he presses his face into John’s neck instead, allowing himself this selfish indulgence, hoping to ease the flood of emotion, to ground himself into reality. He doesn’t even realize he’s shaking until John starts to rub a hand up and down his back, sending shivers over him, his flesh breaking out in goose pimples. He’s not sure anyone’s ever held him like this, and the twisting thing inside of him is threatening to spill over.
“That reminds me,” John says. “That quote on the wall, the one about dreams. What was that all about?”
John stops just inside the door and closes his eyes when he’s entered the familiar black void.  The door closes and disappears behind him, and he shivers in the cold, trying to ignore the way this place makes his skin crawl.  It feels like there are spirits lurking everywhere, doing their best to encroach on his space.  He feels paralyzed.
John freezes. His heart skips a beat in his chest and his mind begins to race. Of course he’s wished that his entire life, every moment since he was a child, every time someone told him he was crazy, or he had to run and run and
“’Course,” Mike says, holding out the large parcel in his hands to Sherlock. Occasionally, Mike ran errands for him, getting him potions ingredients the apothecaries wouldn’t send via owl when he didn't want to go to the trouble of going to Diagon or Knockturn Alley.
“John,” Sherlock says. His voice is tremulous and soft and he feels flayed open and exposed, but John only smiles warmly at him. John squeezes Sherlock’s right hand, then lets go of that, too. He rests his hand on Sherlock’s waist instead, and Sherlock lets out a shaky, surprised breath in response. John’s fingers curl around Sherlock’s back, his palm rests strongly against his side, his thumb burns into the flesh of his stomach through the fabric of his shirt. Sherlock feels as if he exists only in the places in which John is touching him, as if the rest of his body has dissolved, as if he has no sensory input beyond where John’s hands lie.
“Oh,” John says. “Well, yeah, it’s, er, always been here, as far as I know.” He gives a slightly uncomfortable smile and looks away from the man and squints against the bright light of the sun for a moment. He’s not sure what to do; he doesn’t want to leave a stranger on his doorstep while no one’s home, but he doesn’t want to stand here with the old man, either. He glances back at the old man, ready to make an awkward excuse that will get both of them to be on their way, but he notices a pin on the old man’s jacket. “Are you a veteran?” John asks, gesturing towards it.
He smiles at Iris and leans down to kiss her, just because he can. “Good morning, Iris,” he murmurs, his voice scratchy from disuse. He kisses her again, in full sight of John, and she gurgles and reaches out to take hold of his hair. He laughs and John pries her hand off his curls. Sherlock smiles at him, and makes no effort to hide his expression.
quite eager to understand the situation. The urgency has passed now that he knows that Sherlock seems pleased that he’s met Greg, though, so he takes his steaming mug and leisurely sits at the kitchen table. Sherlock abruptly stops pacing and sits across from him. He immediately leans forward in his seat and stares at John intently, holding his hands together almost as if he’s praying and resting his chin atop his fingertips.
John doesn’t know what to make of this.  It’s the second time someone’s referred to him as powerful, and he’s not sure why.  He ignores it for now.  “Who is ‘everyone’?” he asks instead.
, you git. I don’t have to get to the bottom of every secret anyone’s ever had,” John says. The words could be harsh, but they don’t feel that way, and Sherlock can’t help but smile.
Hope floods through John and he squeezes Sherlock’s hand, his heart pounding in his chest.   He remembers this boy as being shy, but now, he is somehow a strong, fierce, and commanding presence that John desperately hopes is enough to sway the spirits.
“Touché,” John says, but he seems amused rather than offended, and a relieved smile stretches across Sherlock’s face, something settling in his chest that he didn’t know was unsettled.
When John wakes, he’s lying in his own bed. It’s much easier to breathe, and he feels warm and tired. He blinks blearily around the room, and wonders what time it is, and what day it is, but when he notices that Sherlock is sitting on the edge of his bed watching him, he focuses on him instead.
, the self-declared sociopath, to do all of this, to try so hard just for John, to push himself to this point of emotional upheaval. It hits him, and he presses his forehead closer to Sherlock’s skin.
Sherlock smiles, looking up at the sky again, and not at John. Like before, the moonlight illuminates his cheekbones and the tip of his nose, winding its way into the highlights of his curls. After a moment, he turns to John, his eyes crinkling at the corners as he smiles patiently and the moonlight shifts against his skin. Again, there’s something wistful in the expressive planes of his face, in the gentle lines around his eyes and the small but genuine smile that doesn’t quite meet his eyes. “There are many worlds out there, John. And you’ve gotten a good start making yours, haven’t you?”
“You seem a bit jealous, mate,” Billy says.  He sounds cautious, and John realizes he’s radiating anger.
He feels panic wash over him; he’d been staring at John like a fool, and he doesn’t understand the way John was looking at him, and he has an urge to flee, to hide away, but John suddenly appears in the kitchen doorway, and Sherlock looks up at him, feeling caught out, though he’s not sure at what.
John stares at the teapot for a moment.  The water is overflowing, but he ignores it until Sherlock’s words sink in and he turns to him.  “What?” he says.  “He – what?”
Sherlock leans forward, buries his face into John’s neck, wraps his arms around John’s back and pulls him close in a hug, feels John’s hands tightening on him. “Happy Christmas,” he says, warm and surrounded by John and, for the first time since he’s been nine years old, incandescently happy.
“I couldn’t tell you in the beginning,” Sherlock says a moment later. His voice is hushed. “I wanted to, so many times, but it would have been dangerous if you knew.”
John presses closer still, his leg sliding further between Sherlock’s, and Sherlock lets out a strangled gasp when their hips connect and he feels John’s hardness against his own. Something like electricity jolts in his stomach and he presses his fingertips into John’s back, urging him closer.
The door to 221C is unlocked, and the lights are on as he opens the door. It’s the same organized chaos of mysterious items that he remembers from the first time he was down here, the time he’d found Billy. It seems like years ago now, and the time before Sherlock is like a hazy memory, indistinct and unimportant, though in reality, it’s only about a month or so prior.
Sherlock has seen John hold Iris with two arms, cradling her in the traditional way parents seem to hold newborns, her soft head carefully supported by the crook of his elbow. He’s seen him hold her this same way but with only one arm, propped against a pillow, the other carefully holding a bottle to her lips as she gulps down formula and blinks up at him. He’s seen John hold her in a more upright position, her head tucked next to John’s neck, stomach pressed against John’s chest, as he burps her or soothes her when she’s crying. That’s Sherlock’s favorite way, he thinks, because he imagines she’s smelling John, learning his scent, imprinting him as her most dear person. Sometimes he catches himself thinking foolishly wistful thoughts when he sees John holding her that way, and he tends to stop watching, turning instead to his phone or his computer.
“Of course I do,” Sherlock says. “He’s one of the few people in this world who’s not a complete idiot.”
“Oh…really?” John asks. He tries to imagine the two of them meeting, but finds it difficult. “I mean, yeah, maybe. He’s a bit…odd.”
John shakes his head, and his smile doesn’t waver. “It’s alright,” John says. “Next time you can touch me all you want.”
“I wasn’t sacrificing myself,” Sherlock says.  “I knew you’d save me.  But you had to see that she wanted to see you.  You have to understand how much people care about you, John.”
Sherlock smiles at John, his eyes flicking over John and Mary’s intertwined arms quickly before going back to John’s face.  “Naturally,” he says, and John raises his eyebrows.
“John!” Moriarty says, his eyes wide in delight as his voice echoes through the room. “You found me! And, oh, you’ve brought
When he opens the door, though, Sherlock is sitting on the couch, his knees tucked up to his chin. His head rests sideways on top and his eyes are closed. He’s facing the window; perhaps he’d been looking outside. John thinks he must have fallen asleep. He can’t help but notice how skinny Sherlock is, how small he manages to look in this position. His face is smoothed in relaxation, and in their absence, John realizes how many new lines are there when he’s awake.
Sherlock rolls his eyes. “You used cleaning charms on your room, but you put your clothes away without any magic, and you’re sick of wizarding society. Very few wizards from magic families would act that way,” he says without thinking.
John doesn’t reply; he’s not sure he’s expected to, and he doesn’t think he can. He can only focus on the feel of Sherlock’s fingers against his skull, his head drifting forward until it’s resting against Sherlock’s hip, his breath warm against the soft fabric of Sherlock’s dressing gown, his eyes closed.
Arthur’s voice is gruff, and John smiles and feels a surge of unexpected affection. He pats Arthur’s hand with his own free hand for a moment, but then takes it away, lest he spread germs.
John does his best to keep his expression casual. “Yeah, alright,” he says. “I’ll talk to Sherlock, but I can’t guarantee he’ll come. He doesn’t get out much.”
Sherlock shrugs. “She touched your shoulder.” He lazily points in the general direction of John’s bad shoulder.
John’s breathing fast, and he groans, deep and guttural, as his hand picks up speed. Sherlock feels sparks deep in his stomach, feels restlessness in his legs, feels his toes start to curl in pleasure. “John,” he says, breathing hitched, feeling desperate. “Don’t – oh god, don’t stop.” He doesn’t recognize his own voice, doesn’t recognize the needy way his hips twist with the movement of John’s hands, doesn’t recognize the strange feeling coursing through his veins.
“Fuck!” John shouts, anger boiling inside of him, frustration and loss and disappointment and fear crawling over him. He wants to break something, kill something, rip something into tiny pieces, he wants to shout and rage and scream, he wants
“I wouldn’t say it’s been bad since this morning,” Sherlock says. “I think it was alright until lunch. You ate with Mary, didn’t you?”
He doesn’t know how to find Sherlock, and he doesn’t know what to do when he finds him. How is he supposed to fight for Sherlock when he has no magic and no understanding of what Moriarty does? How is he supposed to help Sherlock when he has no idea where he is?
He catches a taxi and ignores the cabbie’s questions about the skull in his hands; thankfully, Billy knows better than to talk in a taxi.  The ride seems to take forever.  Every time they are stopped at a red light, John can’t help but clench and unclench his hand, pursing his lips as he stares listlessly out the window, eyes taking in nothing of the scenery before him and focusing only on replaying the events of the day.
“Oh, this is certainly interesting,” Mycroft says from where he stands behind John.  Both John and Sherlock swivel their heads in his direction to glare at him, and he raises an amused eyebrow.
It doesn’t reply, and John’s honestly not quite sure whether he’d been expecting it to or not, but it surges forward and presses what feels like a small kiss onto John’s cheek.
“Come up on the couch with me?” John asks, and Sherlock nods, but doesn’t make any attempt to move. John kisses his temple again, lips warm and dry, and tugs on him and starts to stand until Sherlock is forced to follow, his limbs shaky, but John pulls him down to the couch almost as soon as he’s standing. John lays down and Sherlock goes with him, and they’re much too big for the little couch, but Sherlock curls against John, body to body, and presses as close as he can get, lets John take care of him and soothe him and cherish him. He sighs against John’s neck, presses a soft kiss there, lets his hand trail half-heartedly down John’s stomach towards where John is hard in his trousers. He wants to take care of him, wants nothing more than to see John come apart, but he is
The words cut through the fog over Sherlock’s brain, and Sherlock considers his arms for a moment, forces the one that isn’t wrapped around John’s leg to move. He slides his head into the waistband of his pajamas and curls his fingers around his cock, gasping as John tugs harder on his hair.
John slides her thumb down, and it feels warm and delicious and a breathy noise spills from Sherlock’s mouth before she can stop it. John leans down and kisses her belly button again, lets two fingers slide up and down in place of her thumb, dragging the moisture up and down. John is breathing heavily against her skin, and Sherlock can’t help it, she tilts her hips up towards John’s hand, and John lets her fingers press harder, teasing over her opening, as she kisses her way further down. Sherlock is trembling with anticipation, and the first press of John’s tongue against her clit is like fire, making her legs twitch and her hands come up to grip her hair again. “
The last one is suddenly being repeated with startling frequency, and John feels his eyes widen. His heart is pounding in his chest now, and adrenaline is rising in spikes.
“He is,” Sherlock hisses.  He seems angry, and John feels a bit of pride for a moment that Sherlock is defending him.  “But he relies far too much on emotions,” he adds, and any pride John had felt a moment before deflates and turns into annoyance.
His heart is pounding in his ears and he’s staring, gaping at the blank space in front of him. Redbeard makes a miserable howling sound beside him, and John’s stomach turns. He can still feel Sherlock’s breath against his palm, can still feel a soft curl brushing his finger. He’s horrified, his heart pounding, his eyes wide.
John shakes his head again, mind turning over Sherlock’s words. “I’m making some bloody tea,” he grumbles, heading to the kitchen.
But then, he blinks in confusion, because somehow, he’s entered the building, even though he’s made no conscious decision to do so.
. I shouldn’t have said that. I was just –” John stops talking and he looks away and clears his throat, then turns back. “I shouldn’t have said that,” he repeats.
He drags himself up the stairs to the flat, massaging his shoulder as best he can as he goes. It doesn’t really help against the pain, but it makes him feel as if he’s doing something about it, which is better than nothing.
Sherlock looks up at him, his heart pounding. John leans down a little bit closer, and somehow, Sherlock finds himself stretching up to meet him, and before he realizes what’s happening, John’s lips are pressing ever so gently against his, soft and sweet. They stay like that for just a moment, a perfect moment in which it feels like time stops, in which Sherlock thinks his heart will beat out of his chest, in which the feeling of John surrounding him is overwhelmingly strong, and then John’s lips slide off of his, but he doesn’t go far.
John reaches over with his familiar, steady hand and pats Sherlock’s leg. Sherlock watches in confusion, unsure why he’d do that, unable to stop focusing on the ghost of the touch that remains after John takes his hand away.
John keeps his eyes open, though they’re half closed in pleasure. He feels like he’s melting under Sherlock’s hands, and he eagerly takes in Sherlock’s face from so close. He reaches up to run his fingers through Sherlock’s hair again, and Sherlock leans into his hand once more. He seems starved for touch, and John resolves to fix that.
John smiles. “It means I love you,” he says, and Sherlock swallows, feels his heartbeat lodge somewhere in his throat, feels frozen in time. “It means I want to be with you. If you’d like.”
She gestures towards the house, and Sherlock and John follow, Sherlock sending John a grin when he catches his eye.
Sherlock feels a flush of something uncomfortable, but ignores it, awkwardly eyeing the mess his sitting room has become. He’ll have to tidy, he thinks.
“This,” he says. “This life. I choose this.” His voice is hoarse but sincere, and Sherlock reaches up with his free hand and gently, so gently, cups the side of John’s face, his eyes never leaving John’s. His fingers press there for a fleeting moment, just long enough for John to lean into the touch and look up at him softly, his heartbeat fast in his throat, before Sherlock pulls his hand away.
John feels at his wit’s end.  There is a surprising amount of panic rising inside him, and the only thing he can see in his mind is Sherlock, lying still on the ground with only Mycroft there to stand watch.  John is trained for crisis situations, but nothing has prepared him for this; he’s fighting a battle with unknown weapons, and he doesn’t like it.
They walk for a while in silence, save for the murmurs of conversation they overhear from the spirits, until they’re finally close enough that John can make out the tree in the clearing. It’s still quite far ahead, but he can see it in better detail now. It’s huge, and it’s adorned with fruits that appear to be the same as the lantern John and Sherlock are holding, only they’re still attached to the tree, glowing all the same.
“When she asked you if there was anything else bothering you, you were thinking of seeing spirits, correct?” Sherlock spares John a glance to observe his nod. “If it were that easy to be rid of them, you would have been rid of them long ago. Your thoughts aren’t gloomy and you’ve done nothing to attract the spirits beyond existing. She didn’t know what she was talking about, and she could never begin to imagine the sort of problems you face.”
Mycroft turns on his heel and puts up his umbrella, and John blinks when he suddenly vanishes.  It’s testament to the day he’s had that this doesn’t even seem shocking to him.
“You could at least thank her,” John says to Sherlock’s back before sharing a glance with Mrs. Hudson, who seems to enjoy allowing Sherlock to indulge in this kind of behavior if the faint smile she gives John is anything to go by.
After a moment, he begins walking again. It’s silent in this strange place, and John, with an aching heart, imagines the sound of Sherlock’s violin. He manages a small smile as he keeps walking, thinking of Sherlock playing, his long fingers sliding over the strings.
“Fuck, Sherlock,” John gasps. “So good, so good, like that,” he babbles. He kisses him again, clumsily, kisses his jaw, his cheekbone. They’re both thrusting and moaning and gasping and it’s messy and clumsy, but it’s perfect. One of Sherlock’s hands clutches John’s back, fingers pressing hard into John’s shoulder, and the other is wrapped around his cock, and John tangles his fingers into Sherlock’s hair, kisses him again, cherishes the feeling of closeness.
John lifts his head, but not before pressing a kiss to Sherlock’s neck. Sherlock presents his wrists and John carefully undoes the buttons holding his shirt on and then pulls it off, tossing it over the desk chair. He tugs Sherlock’s undershirt off, too, pulls it over his head, and Sherlock feels exposed, cold and vulnerable in the dusky bedroom. But John’s face shifts, turning more serious, and he steps closer once more, kissing Sherlock fiercely. Sherlock responds eagerly, the feel of John’s jumper tantalizing against his bare skin, John’s mouth hot and warm, the sounds of their heavy breathing and wet kisses loud in the bedroom.
Mycroft smiles a thin smile that doesn’t reach his eyes. “Of course, John. The place where Sherlock is currently being held is not in this world. It’s an altogether different one, but one which
Sherlock climbs through the window easily, his long limbs passing through the small space with grace and ease which, to John, doesn’t make sense; he should have
Sherlock’s cheeks flush after John’s praise and his heart speeds up again, but he doesn’t reply; he doesn’t think he can. Instead, he stares at John, lets himself enjoy the feeling of John’s fingers against his face, lets his eyes drift half-closed. “I didn’t even touch you,” he says after a moment. He frowns and opens his eyes a bit more.
John crouches down beside him, ignoring his shoulder, and takes the water. Carefully, slowly, he pours it into the urn, watching as the moonlight reflects off of it, sending prisms of light into the air.
Sherlock sits up straighter in his seat and arches one eyebrow. “The many faces of Miss Morstan, hmm?” he says.
“Hold the arm in place, Sherlock,” Uncle Augustus says. Carefully, Sherlock looks at the edges of the broken arm and lines them up with the socket on the nutcracker’s torso, sniffling all the while, his heart filled with heavy dismay, and then he looks up at Uncle Augustus to see if he’s done it correctly.
She shakes her head and looks away, clearly embarrassed, but then turns back to him. “Have you figured out what to do?” she asks after a moment, ignoring her red cheeks and discomfiture. “You were gone for a while.”
Sherlock laughs, and it echoes loud and rich in Mycroft’s foyer. John can’t help but join in, his shoulders shaking as he tries to quell his laughter.
Despite his annoyance, John knows he’s going to agree; after all, Mary isn’t home, and he really has nothing else to do, and it’s not like he’s shocked by Sherlock’s behavior.  He falls into step with Sherlock easily.
“How do we get there if you don’t know where it is?” Sherlock asks curiously. He’s never met someone like John before; he is entranced.
, and John’s fingers are curled into his hair, holding it taut but not quite pulling, and Sherlock keens, desperate and needy.
you leave this building. Sherlock’s closet, however, is vastly different; when you use it to travel, it creates a link from this building to wherever you go. The closet creates a sort of cross-dimensional pathway using Sherlock’s magic and allows you to pass through. As a result, when you arrive somewhere via this closet, you are still connected to this building as long as the door you pass through doesn’t disappear.”
John ignores the glare and finds himself thinking about Sherlock’s words. “She wished for that?” he finally asks, and Sherlock’s dark expression lifts.
“I’ll sleep in the grass,” Sherlock says. He sets his glass down beside him on the bench and lowers himself down to the floor on his loose limbs, and then lies down on his back, feeling the texture of the grass through his clothes. “It’s nice,” he tells John, twitching his nose when a butterfly lands on the tip.
She pauses, and John’s watching her with a pounding heart, his hand trembling on the handle where it rests. Her words are unexpected, and he doesn’t doubt their integrity for even a second. Vaguely formed memories of parents he didn’t really know flash through his mind, his heart twisting in his chest.
“Sherlock!” Moriarty calls suddenly, his voice high-pitched and so loud that it echoes through the tunnels. “Wake up now, darling! John’s come to play!”
“Right,” John says, closing his eyes. He doesn’t feel sick anymore, but he still feels exhausted. “What time is it?”
“It was a long time before I could get used to letting somebody lead me around like this, you know,” the man says conspiratorially. “Made me realize how old I am. But I’m ninety years old; I think I’ve earned a bit of help now and then.”
“Shh,” John says, clumsily petting Sherlock’s hair, stroking up and down his back, his own heart beating fast, still out of breath and lethargic.
“How’d you get on my roof?” John asks after a long moment in which the stranger stands still, not daring to adjust his placating body language, as John stares him down.
“I can hear you, you know,” John mutters. Sherlock turns to him and gives him a small, clearly amused smile.
It’s not the same as it was, and he’s not sure it ever will be, but the sound of John’s footsteps and the clean smell of John’s shampoo in the cloudy humidity of the bathroom and the sight of John in his chair do something to Sherlock he has trouble examining too closely. He feels something small and delicate coming back to life, something he has long since given up on and tried to lay to rest, and it’s as beautiful as it is painful.
John’s laughing as he swallows the last bite of his sandwich, his eyes crinkling in the corners. “No, I’m not joking,” he insists, as soon as his mouth is free of food. “I came home and opened the fridge and –
John’s skin is warm and familiar and Sherlock lets his hand gently wrap around John’s ribs, lets the tips of his fingers press between John’s back and the sheet beneath him, lets his thumb sweep over his chest, so close to the tantalizing strip of light and yet not quite there.  He nuzzles against John’s arm and draws closer, drapes his leg across John’s, rests his head on John’s chest rather than his shoulder.
“I’d love some,” Mary says. Sherlock merely inclines his head in agreement, and John sighs, pouring out three glasses of wine.
Sherlock shrugs. “It just seemed like it would come in handy,” he says, but John doesn’t buy it, and he grins, standing up.
“Augustus!” Daddy says, coming up behind Sherlock, interrupting him and making frustration bubble in Sherlock’s stomach; he wants to see his gift. Daddy rests his hand on Sherlock’s shoulder, and shakes Uncle Augustus’ hand with the other.
“Alright,” Sherlock says after a moment. He seems unwilling to let go of John, and that’s okay. John shifts, relaxing against Sherlock, mindful of his side, letting his head press into Sherlock’s neck.
John smiles at him. “Tomorrow,” he says. “I could… believe it or not, I’d like a moment to take it in that you’re going to fix it, anyway,” he admits. “Is that… alright?”
Sherlock smiles, heading up the small pathway to the door. “Things aren’t always as they seem,” he says.
“If you – what you wished, if you have any – perhaps, when you wished you didn’t realize it would be – it’s a long time–”
Sherlock turns to him and raises one eyebrow.  John lets out an annoyed huff of air and looks away, frowning when he glances in front of him and sees a woman sitting on a swing nearby.  He hadn’t heard her approach, but then, he’d been quite angry, so he thinks that could be why.  She’s very beautiful; she’s thin and fair skinned with thick, red hair.  Her eyes are dark, and her lips and cheeks are flushed with color.  She looks like something out of a fairy tale, John thinks, and he doesn’t notice he’s been staring at her until he realizes she’s staring back.
disappears,” John says, panic flooding him; what if he does something wrong and causes the entire building to vanish?
“Most people don’t,” Greg says. “And they’ve had much longer to try and figure it out than you’ve had. There’s a reason Sherlock’s the only wish granter; he’s the only one with the ability, for one thing, but I think he’s also the only one who can understand how to keep the balance.”
“I suppose you’re right,” Mummy says, and Sherlock twists in her arms, finally breaking free of them, and he lunges for Daddy, but Mummy grabs him back just in time, as Daddy heads to their room, where Sherlock knows he will lock away the nutcracker.
Warmth spreads from Sherlock’s stomach to his fingertips. He shifts closer to John and lowers his head, lets his lips part, and closes his eyes in lieu of answering, and then John’s lips are there, pressing against his, open and warm and inviting. It starts soft and gentle, short tender kisses, but Sherlock feels a longing unfurl deep in his stomach that he can’t control and his hands pull John tighter and then the kisses are growing longer and more desperate.
He looks down and meets her eyes, and hers widen for just a moment in something like trust before she holds tighter to his hand, reaching up and clutching it with both of her own hands, burying her face in his arm.  He holds her close and closes his eyes, taking a deep, shaky breath, and thinks of home as his ribbon twists around the one hanging from above.
. If John stops and thinks, though, he knows that Sherlock’s been showing it since he came back, but John has been too wrapped up in his side of things to notice until it moved past Sherlock’s subtle tells and got to this point.
Sherlock nods and ignores the little twist of pain he feels at the thought that John needs time away from him. John shrugs his jacket on and then comes over to the armchair. He leans down and presses a kiss to Iris’ head, then stays bent down for a moment, looking at her face, his fingers stroking over her fuzzy hair. His hand rests against Sherlock’s arm a bit due to their proximity, and Sherlock is dimly aware that he’s hardly breathing and staring at John’s head and watching the soft smile on John’s face.
There’s another case, and John skips work to help Sherlock, who solves it almost immediately. They stumble home a little bit tipsy again, and they’re both giggling, laughing over the events of the day, enjoying each other’s company.
John watches in awe as it fills the lantern. Surprisingly, the weight of the lantern doesn’t seem to change even though it’s steadily filling with liquid. John glances at Sherlock, who’s staring at the lantern, the light dancing over his sharp features. Sherlock turns his head to catch John’s eye for a moment and grins, and John can’t help it; he feels a small laugh bubble up inside of him as the night catches up to him, and then they’re both giggling, heads leaning in towards each other, their pinkies overlapping on the handle of their rapidly filling fruit, watching as the nectar flows.
John’s stomach flutters. He’s irrationally pleased to hear Sherlock sniping at him and it settles something inside of him. He pushes himself away from the doorjamb to sit beside Sherlock on the couch, his heart beating fast. He’s very aware of the scant centimeters between his knee and Sherlock’s, of the murky place their relationship has landed in, but he’s too hungry to worry about it yet. He takes the plate Sherlock all but shoves in his hands and begins to eat, forcing himself to go slowly rather than just inhale it like he very much wants to do.
“Yes, of course,” Sherlock says. “Where I store all relevant information in my mind, to be retrieved when necessary. It’s quite convenient, but there’s only so much space. It’s like a hard drive, John.”
Greg shakes his head. He sighs and reaches into his pocket, pulling out a small bag of hand-rolled cigarettes. “Do you mind?” he asks. “I’m trying to quit, but it’s rough.”
, John. What were you doing before you met this spirit?” Sherlock’s not eating anymore. He’s leaning forward to stare at John intensely.
“I’m not bloody cleaning this shit up by hand,” he says. “You clean it up, then, and give me back my wand.”
“Oh, dear,” a deep voice says, and John automatically covers Sherlock’s prone form before turning his head towards the voice, but then relaxes when he sees Mycroft approaching.  “It seems Sherlock has gotten himself into trouble again,” Mycroft says.
welcome. It’s soothing, and John lets himself enjoy it for a moment. “What happened to Mary’s back?” he finally asks, remembering the bandages he saw poking out of her shirt.
“Yeah,” he says. He sounds relieved, and Sherlock is grateful for the time he’s been spending reading mother’s message boards on the internet. John nods, smoothing his hands over Iris’ head, exhaling loudly through his nose. “Yeah, that’s…can you grab her hat and blankets?”
, but his hand reaches up and cups John’s face, presses against his skin, and his thumb rubs against John’s cheek. He closes his eyes; he hasn’t meant to do that, he hasn’t, but he’s out of control and he can’t help it and it feels like
John looks at it. In a barely legible but quite elegant hand, it reads, “The present world is dream. Dreams at night are truth.” Under it, there is no name, but a butterfly, drawn carefully with only one stroke of a pen.
“He can see ghosts and spirits,” Sherlock interrupts. He’s watching Mary carefully. “Have you ever seen one?”
He stands up and holds out his hand.  She takes it, rubbing her eyes with her other hand, when John frowns.  He glances at his shoulder; he’d felt something strange and wet on it.  He feels it again, and then holds out his hand and realizes he feels raindrops.
Arthur puts his hand on John’s arm. “I’m sorry,” he says. “It must have been hard growing up without parents. But you know, John, for what it’s worth, I would have been proud to call you my son.”
When they get to the park, Mary is waiting for them near the fountain they’d chosen earlier. She really does look quite lovely, John thinks, in her long, flowing sundress, her hair fluttering in the light breeze. He smiles.
Sherlock watches, pressing closer to the nutcracker in fear, as the mice scramble away from their fights to rush to their leader’s side and then scurry away, pulling his body into the darkness of the corners of the room, and presumably, back to wherever they all came from beneath the floorboards.
When he came back to 221B, John had been positive he was the broken one, but now, with Sherlock’s surprisingly fragile heart in his hands, he realizes how wrong he was. He presses a chaste kiss against Sherlock’s collarbone and revels in the feel of Sherlock shivering against him in response.
“It was easy,” Sherlock says with a shrug. “Its magic was very strong, as was the concealment magic.”
Redbeard looks at him and makes some fast, frantic squeaking sounds, and John holds his hand closer to his face, and when Redbeard leans in and presses a kiss against his cheek, John closes his eyes and is surprised by how nice it feels.
The next afternoon, despite his better judgment, John finds himself outside 221B Baker Street again. Half of him has been expecting to find that the flat itself never even existed; that the entire encounter had been some sort of strange hallucination. And yet, 221B Baker Street is still there, and so is he.
Sherlock swallows, and then clears his throat. He opens his mouth to speak, but finds that yet again he doesn’t know what to say, so he closes it again.
“It’s worse on the way to Moriarty’s, but you can’t fear it, John. When you are in the forest, you must get the spirits on your side. Call to them. Focus on why you need their help, and your appreciation of them.”
The man immediately pulls them toward himself and adjusts them so he can read them clearly. After a moment, he stops his scrutiny of the dog tags and looks up at John. John is taken aback by the intensity of the man’s stare, and when the man gestures towards an armchair, John sits heavily.
Sherlock’s heart is beating fast in his chest and his lips are parted and he can do nothing but stare because he doesn’t know what to say. He thinks this is when he says something about how glad he is to have John back, too, how he’d rather die than be without John, how the sounds of John moving around the flat give him a kind of peace he doesn't understand and feels unsettled by, how he wants to help John but he doesn’t know how and he doesn’t know how to deal with what he feels, how sometimes he lies awake and his entire mind and body are taken over with a longing for John he doesn’t understand. Instead, after a moment of uncomfortable silence, he says, “Should we go to Angelo’s?”
and so I can’t help but love her.” He clears his throat, wills himself to keep going. “I always thought I ruined everything we had, but she’s just a blank slate and when I see her, she makes me think maybe there’s a chance and I want to-“
Surprisingly, he’s not asking in a way that feels malicious to Sherlock, though he’s been known to misread people’s intentions. “Of course I don’t have tracking charms in your room,” Sherlock says. “I don’t have the time to worry myself over what kind of magic you’re using.”
“You’re not Mummy or Daddy,” Sherlock says petulantly, his eyes trained on the nutcracker’s sparkling ones. “I don’t have to listen to you.”
at him, knowing he’s divorced, knowing there’s no baby, knowing Mary’s not there, but not knowing the details. He thinks maybe he should find a new job.
“Oi!” John says, indignant, jumping back from Sherlock’s hand.  “What are you doing in my bloody trousers?”
He uncovers his face for a moment and looks up at Sherlock, emotions he can’t name swirling inside of him. Wearily, he pushes himself up with trembling arms until he’s sitting. Sherlock watches in confusion, reaching out to help him and then pulling his hands back, unsure if his assistance is welcome. John looks at him for a moment and then carefully, so carefully, he leans forward and shifts until he can wrap his arms around Sherlock’s waist, leaning into him and holding him as close as he can. He feels nervous to do something like this, to reach out for Sherlock, who is usually so distant and unattainable, but it’s only a moment before Sherlock’s arms wrap around him in return, solid and secure. John eagerly sinks into the embrace, relief to be with Sherlock again tightening inside his chest, overwhelming him in its intensity. Sherlock is so warm and real that John can’t understand why he felt so alone the past few days while Sherlock was gone.
, Sherlock thinks), and pulls Sherlock up to carefully get him on the couch instead. He pulls the blanket from the back and wraps it around him, then goes to his own chair and takes the blanket from there to wrap that around him as well. He casts a gentle warming spell.
Okay, DON'T KILL ME!!  The next part will be up within a week, so you won't have to wait long to find out what happens next.  There will be two more parts, and then this story will be finished!
He’s whistling as he approaches Baker Street, thinking of the beautiful receptionist at the clinic where he’d taken the interview that morning. They’d gotten on quite well, and he likes the way she smiles at him, her eyes crinkling in the corners. It’s rather cute, he thinks, and he’s still whistling as he climbs the stairs to Sherlock’s flat. Even Sherlock in a strop can’t put a damper on his mood, he’s sure of it.
all the time. You’re – I know I say it all the time, but you really are brilliant,” John tells him. “I’m not usually – I’m rubbish at this, at talking, but you really – after today, after what you did for me today, I can’t just – I can’t just
The man stretches his long arm out, his palm up, fingertips stretched towards John expectantly. John holds his closed fist over the man’s palm, the metal chain of the dog tags slipping between his fingers and brushing over the man’s flesh, though the tags themselves remain in his fist. He feels, somehow, that letting them go is significant, and he hesitates for just a moment before he opens his hand, the small bundle dropping into the man’s palm with a tinkling sound of metal.
She turns and starts running, still holding his hand, and he follows.  He knows he shouldn’t, but he hasn’t yet thought of another plan.  “It’s so lonely here,” she says.  “But there are so many of them over there!  It’ll be better, you’ll see!”
John wants to protest being treated like a child, but he supposes Mrs. Hudson is old enough to treat everyone like a child, and he’s much too tired. Sherlock’s fingers rub over the burning area at the base of his neck where the spirit’s tooth had touched him, and John shivers unpleasantly, twisting away from the touch.
“You’re really making an impression, aren’t you?” Sherlock asks a moment later, exhaling a long stream of smoke into the cool night air.
Sherlock is still, his chest just barely moving with the slightest of breaths.  His face is pale, and in the twilight, it looks almost translucent.  John swallows, his eyes raking over Sherlock’s form, eager to take in every bit of him.  He glances behind him at Mycroft, who is leaning on his umbrella and watching John.
He descends to 221C and flicks on a light switch, illuminating rows and rows of shelves with strange things upon them. There are teapots, urns, bottles with strange things floating in them, what appear to be animal skeletons, devices with purposes he can’t even begin to imagine, mirrors, and more, and he finds it all a bit overwhelming.
“I know,” John breathes, his throat constricting. He can’t stop stroking Sherlock’s face, can’t look away from his eyes, can’t shift even a millimeter away from his body.
Carefully, he reaches out and holds the glowing thing that was once a cupcake over Sherlock’s chest.  He doesn’t want to let go; it seems far too precious for that, but he takes a deep breath, holds it in for a moment, and lets go.  The cupcake drops into Sherlock’s chest, and much like the woman’s hand had done before, it vanishes into his skin.  It’s anticlimactic in how easy it is, but John’s heat is pounding nonetheless.
Sherlock shrugs and turns back to his groceries, but his back is stiff. “I’ve been shopping for myself for a while now. I got used to it,” he says.
John closes his eyes and takes a deep breath again. He wills himself to be calm as he thinks over what Mycroft said. “Mrs. Hudson and Billy –” He stops and swallows around the lump in his throat. “That’s why they’re – the way they are right now. Because Sherlock’s – not here,” he says, understanding beginning to dawn on him.
“I have to go,” John says. He coughs again, but this time he’s grateful to see that there’s no blood.
Sherlock goes to sit beside him, but something occurs to him, and he smiles, reaching into his pocket before he sits. He pulls out the little crown, holding it out in the palm of his hand, looking at it in the dim glow of the fairy lights. “I still have this,” he says, voice soft. “All these years, I knew it was real, I knew
“I’ll just let myself out then, shall I?” Mycroft says.  Sherlock rolls his eyes and turns away to flop down on the couch, facing away from the room, and John shrugs.
“But you’ll be able to do it for Sherlock,” she adds, a rare note of confidence in her voice. He turns to her and she offers him a small smile. “No matter what happens, just remember that he’ll be on the other side.”
“No problem,” Angelo says.  He puts the remainder of the food he’d been cooking into a takeout container, and wraps it in a bright red cloth, a yellow crescent moon bright on the outside, as John hurriedly eats his dinner.  “Take this,” he says.  “And don’t worry about paying; it’s on me.”
Daddy crouches beside him and looks at the nutcracker. He reaches out to touch Sherlock’s forehead as if to test for a fever, but Sherlock pulls away, sniffling loudly.
The woman flushes red and stares at him in some mixture of embarrassment and shock.  She seems flustered, and John instantly regrets taking his annoyance on Sherlock out on her.  “He’s really not bad,” John adds, the edge out of his voice this time, and he turns to Sherlock, who is watching John with a raised brow and the corner of his mouth turned upwards.
Sherlock smiles.  “I knew you would get it back,” he says with a shrug, his shirt shifting beneath John’s hand.
“You don’t have to make the potion tonight,” John says. “We’re both a pit pissed. Tomorrow’s Saturday; we can do it then. Why don’t we… do you want to have a drink in here? Is that alright?”
“Yes,” John says. He leans down and carefully picks up one of the mouse’s seven crowns that rolled off his head when the mice carried him away. He stands and smiles as he places it on Sherlock’s head. Sherlock giggles, reaching up and feeling it, pushing it further on his head so it’s more secure.
“John,” he says again. It seems it’s all he can say, and this time, it’s wrenched out of him in such an utterly miserable way that his lower lip convulses for a moment against the upper, and he holds himself stiff and tries not to breathe for fear of losing control.
Mary ignores this and continues speaking, leaning forward a bit. “You want to be there whenever there’s a chance John and I will be alone together outside of work, and yet you told John he can’t invite me to your flat. Why is that? Wouldn’t it be easier for me to just visit you, since the two of you live in the same place? Why can’t I come to your flat?”
He resigns himself to at least finding enough room to make a cup of tea and stealing a piece of bread; he’s too tired for much else. When he goes to the kitchen, though, he stops in the entryway, his hand falling to his side and his mouth opening and closing with no sound coming out.
But suddenly John is turning them over, and Sherlock is on his back.  He likes this, the way John senses when it’s too much for him and takes over.  He can’t think about it, though, not when in the same instant that he finds himself on his back, John’s lips are suddenly attached to his neck, to the spot between his neck and his shoulder that makes him shiver and he finds that he is clinging desperately to John’s back, and that he’s making sounds, soft breathy ones, and that it feels like his heart is crawling all over his skin, that he’s coming apart from the inside, that he will do anything anything anything if it means he can feel this even a moment longer.
“I look forward to it,” Arthur says. John stands and looks at Arthur questioningly, but Arthur smiles. “I’m going to stay here for a while and enjoy the day. See you tomorrow, John.”
Sherlock opens the door with a bang and comes to the landing, tension evident in his hunched shoulders and furrowed brow. “John,” he says, his voice thick. His eyes are flitting wildly over John’s body and the space around it, and he rushes down the steps between them to offer John his arm.
“Sherlock’s magic created this house, and Sherlock’s magic sustains it,” Mycroft continues a moment later. “Therefore, the link between Sherlock’s magic and this house cannot disappear while you are inside it because you cannot die by Sherlock’s hand. As a result, Sherlock
While he’s there making tea, he hears Iris stir, hears a few small whimpers that start up and die down again. John doesn’t appear to be fazed; he hasn't left his chair, so Sherlock assumes this is normal for her and doesn’t mean she’s actually waking. He’s burning to know the ins and outs of her every sound more than he’s ever wanted to know
She shakes her head and drops his hands. “You are. Come with me and I’ll help you,” she says. He’s tired, and though he’s not sure how she can help, it’s a better chance than he has on his own, so he follows her, Redbeard glued to his side. He’s already nearly dry, and he wishes Sherlock were here, laying on the grass with him while their clothes dry instead. He tangles his hand into Redbeard’s damp fur as they walk, doing his best to stay focused.
Sherlock freezes where he’s bent over the box of ingredients, mentally reviewing everything he’s noticed about John so far and assessing whether or not it could be possible. He stands up slowly, looking John over once more. “I play the violin,” he tells him. “Quite often, and sometimes at night. I also almost always have potions experiments going in the kitchen, some of which are quite… dangerous. There are times I don’t talk, sometimes for days. Is that a problem?”
“No,” Sherlock replies. “We’ll be gone for a few days, though, so you’ll be on your own here with Mrs. Hudson for a while.”
Sherlock seems like he’s going to say something, but he stops himself, looking at John with a soft expression John’s unaccustomed to seeing. “You truly are exceptional, John,” he tells him instead.
“I don’t think Sherlock’s interested in her,” Billy says.  John glances over at the swings, frowning.  The woman is staring at her lap; she appears to be quite shy.  Sherlock is sitting beside her and staring at John, who’s beginning to feel a bit guilty for shoving Sherlock in the woman’s direction to begin with – but Sherlock’s a grown man, and he could walk away anytime, and he should really reconsider getting John so riled up in the future, John thinks.  He’s about to go apologize when the woman looks up at Sherlock.
Angelo glances up before he starts to dish food onto a plate for John.  “Seems you’ve got something interesting in your pocket,” he says after taking in the direction of his son’s gaze.  “Sorry about that.”
John stops right in front of him. He doesn’t say anything, and Sherlock can barely breathe for fear of giving himself away. Unexpectedly, John reaches forward and pulls Sherlock into a tight hug.
He rubs her back, and slowly her sobs subside.  She pulls away a little bit, just enough to look him in the eye.  “Do you think I’m a sissy?” she asks.
Sherlock wakes with the warmth of John’s skin beneath him. He becomes aware of his surroundings slowly, feeling relaxed and content in a way he never has. John’s fingers are drifting through his hair, and John’s chest rises and falls soothingly beneath his cheek. His arm is tucked around John’s waist, and he can’t help it; he trails his fingers up and down John’s side, unable to keep himself from trying to feel more skin.
Sherlock looks up from the reaction he’s watching, irritated. “Obviously,” he says. “As such, it’s quite dangerous, and I’d appreciate it if you didn’t interrupt me.”
“I want to,” Sherlock says. He takes the tea from John and takes a long sip, then a big bite of toast. “Let me just eat this.”
“No,” Sherlock says, eyes trained on Molly while she works. “You don’t need to tell her anything. She already knows exactly what you want to know, probably better than you do, and she’ll tell you no more and no less.”
“God, she’ll be dangerous when she’s older, then,” John muses with a crooked smile, eyes trained on her little form.
John’s heart skips a beat when he sees the sincerity on Sherlock’s face.  He smiles, his anger softening.  “Dinner?”
John’s silent a moment, just staring at Sherlock, his mouth slightly open, before he speaks. “Right, I’ll just take these things up, then. I’ll leave her here since she’s sleeping, do you mind?”
He goes to the door where Sherlock’s coat hangs, and for a desperate moment, he wants to gather it in his hands, breathe in the scent, feel the texture beneath his palms – but he can’t. Instead, he scrubs a hand over his face, stares at the coat while a storm of emotions he can’t name gathers in his stomach, and forces himself to keep going. He throws the door open, ignores the sound of the coat rustling against the wood, and runs downstairs to 221A on shaking legs.
Sherlock blinks and looks away. He thinks of playing his violin for John and Mary, of realizing that life moved on without him, of realizing the true depths of his mistakes. He thinks of a thin, dingy mattress, of needles and release. “There was little point,” he murmurs.
John mulls this over for a moment. “Even though I’ve seen him grant wishes and do magic loads of times, I still don't understand how it works,” he says.
that a taxi pulls up to 221B and slows to a stop. Sherlock bounds down the stairs but stops himself just before opening the door. He takes a deep breath, lets his spine settle into a straight line, and adjusts his suit jacket, forcing himself to slow down and not appear too eager. It wouldn’t do, not when this is apparently a time of “emotional upheaval” for John.
“I want –” Sherlock swallows, lets the feeling of John’s cheek beneath his fingertips, of John’s knee against his, of John’s breath against his lips, ground him. “Stay. Forever. Promise me.”
Sherlock rolls his eyes. “If I intended to poison you, do you think I’d be making the poison where you could walk in and see?”
“Are you?” John asks, raising his eyebrows. His eyes darken and his tongue darts out to lick his lips, his eyes flickering down to Sherlock’s mouth.
“People can wish for anything, John,” Sherlock says. “Happiness, unhappiness. There’s nothing we can do to stop someone from wishing for something unpleasant. It’s their choice.”
Time passes, though he’s not sure exactly how long, until finally, with hands he doesn’t realize are shaking, the last of the curse is gone, the last of the stain has left John’s magic, and there’s nothing but
Before John can reply, the man simply disappears, and John is grasping at empty air before he weakly turns to Sherlock, angrier than he has the energy to be. “Why would you do that?” he demands. “Why would you – is it because he’s not human? Is it because you’re jealous I have
John thinks about the way Sherlock took care of him after he’d been attacked by a spirit, about how it felt to have Sherlock’s fingers carding through his hair.  He can almost feel it now, warm pressure against his scalp.  His shoulders relax a fraction, and he remembers sitting pressed against Sherlock, glass of wine in hand as they look out over London.  His mind is filling with images of Sherlock, of remembered sights and smells and sounds.  It’s like the man himself is right there next to him, a warm and solid presence by his side, and he remembers the way Sherlock sat on the fountain edge and unrepentantly licked chocolate frosting off his fingers, the way he’d looked at that woman in amusement and just sat there while she reached into his body and pulled out his soul –
John doesn’t let go of his hand, he just pulls him inside, and Sherlock smiles when he hears cheerful music echoing through the entryway. It’s unlike anything he’s ever heard before, and John cocks his head to listen, then smiles. “Oh, it’s tea time,” he says. “They always play that when they’re making tea.”
said he was quitting smoking, and gave me the cigarettes to hold onto for him. We chatted a bit more, nothing important, and then I felt really tired and next thing I knew, I woke up in my bed.”
“That’s all I’ve wanted, all this time, but I’ve never managed to get it right. In my whole life, I haven’t been as wrong as I have been with you, John, and it’s because never before have I felt such sentiment. Mycroft warned me not to get involved; he says it’s a weakness. Maybe he’s right.” Sherlock swallows hard and forces himself to keep talking.
“Er, sorry, I didn’t mean to come, really, but somehow I’m here again,” the man says, sparing a glance at John.
“Come on, John, or we’ll lose track of it,” Sherlock says, hurrying down the alley to follow the cloth butterfly.
“You are a marvel, John Watson,” Sherlock says. He smiles, soft and small. “I’m so glad you finally see how important you are.”
When he doesn’t continue, John smiles, a small smile that makes his eyes crinkle and his face turn up brightly towards Sherlock even though signs of anxiety show through in the tightness around his mouth and shoulders. “Yes, me,” he says lightly. He sounds amused despite these signs, and he hasn’t let go of Sherlock’s hand. “And you,” he adds.
John’s unsure of how to take that; although he understands now that he has a place in the strange world Sherlock belongs to, it’s still unsettling to think of how much power he wields. He eats instead of thinking about it too deeply, and Sherlock continues.
“What about me?” Billy hisses, and Mrs. Hudson rolls her eyes and grabs him, holding him near the crack so he, too, can watch, something John wonders about considering the skull doesn’t have eyes.
“Sherlock, these flowers are beautiful,” John says again. “This whole room is… it’s gorgeous. Is that a waterfall?”
“I love you,” John says again. It seems so obvious to him now that they would end up like this, that they would be tangled together in Sherlock’s bed, naked and sated and scared and elated.
He knows that some of these spirits are very negative, evil even, but it’s not his place to judge them; it’s his place to communicate with them, he realizes. And he can understand, when he thinks about it, why they’d become so negative, having been feared and isolated for so long. He can relate to them, he thinks, and his heart twists in a pang of sympathy. He thinks of Sherlock again, and he holds onto all the fears he has, tangles his fingers into Redbeard’s fur, and forces himself to walk through the forest, though the air feels heavy and his nausea only keeps growing.
Sherlock smiles and holds his hand out towards John, Redbeard draped over his fingers. John automatically reaches out for him, and Redbeard bridges the distance between their hands.
“Yes,” Sherlock says. His voice is quieter than he had intended, smaller. “Thank you,” he adds. “I wasn’t – you didn’t have to come down here.”
“Are you alright?” the woman on the rock asks, and John opens his eyes to see that she’s leaning forward on the rock, staring at him intently.
“And look at you, so grown up. Nine years old!”   She tugs on his jacket and keeps her hands there for a moment, and Sherlock dutifully pretends to hate it when she pats his lapels and smooths down his jacket. “Such a handsome boy you are, even if you
He grows frustrated quickly, though, because while the notes are easy and he’s playing them correctly, he’s so close to how he used to play that the lack of his ability to play what’s written between the notes, to play the intent that lurks behind them, to show the difference between a hushed and reverent
For one moment, one terrifying, horrible moment, Sherlock is sure that the vice grip he keeps on the knot of emotions about John is going to slip. He’s terrified that things he cannot say will spill forth from his lips.
Sherlock smiles at him. It’s a small, soft smile, and John’s heart skips a beat. “The cost of my wish was my life, but more specifically, it was my presence in your world. Moriarty took it; he removed me from your world. That doesn’t mean I can’t be brought back.
Sherlock unclenches his hands as best he can. He’s still staring at John wide-eyed, still trying to comprehend the way it felt to have a
“My wife died not long after,” Arthur continues, saving John the need to reply. “She got sick; cancer.”
Mycroft opens a door and John listens to his footsteps fade away before turning to Sherlock, one eyebrow raised. “I can’t believe this is Mycroft’s house,” he says, his voice conspiratorially low as he glancing around at the raised ceilings and airy windows.
John wakes lying flat on the ground in the dirt.  He opens his eyes to nothing but rain and a grey, dreary sky.  The hydrangea surrounds him where he lies in its midst, and he feels a weary, hollow feeling deep within him.  He wishes he couldn’t remember it, or that it had been a dream, but he knows that what just happened is real.
forming attachments to others, had a quiche for brunch today in a café near your home that you’ve recently discovered, your family requests no contact from you, and you have your own…
“Morning,” John says. Sherlock can hear a smile in his voice, and it makes his own lips curl gently, his heart beating faster at the way their bodies are entwined, at how perfect it feels. John shifts until he’s lying a little further down on the bed, and nudges Sherlock’s pliant body until Sherlock is on his side, and John rolls onto his side to face him. He tangles their legs together, and Sherlock sighs, pressing closer, feeling an incandescent smile bloom upon his lips.
“No,” John says. “I didn’t. I didn’t realize it wasn’t normal to see the things I saw until I’d already mentioned them to enough people for everyone to think I was mad. Nobody wants to be friends with the kid who says there’s an old lady with her head cut off on the swing set.”
“I have a few regularly scheduled potions deliveries, and they always owl ahead to confirm,” Sherlock tells him, going back to his chair. “Is that so shocking?”
John looks like he’d been about to say something, but he stops and his expression changes to a mixture of concern and amusement. “Alright?” he asks. He sounds fond, and Sherlock swallows; he’s used to that tone. Usually, it means John thinks he’s gotten lost in his mind palace or that John finds the unusual detritus of his experiments funny, and that’s a tone he can work with. He straightens his back, forces his hands to relax.
Mary smiles and walks past him, accidentally brushing his shoulder with hers on her way. “You’ve got a patient in ten minutes! Best be ready!” she calls over her shoulder as she heads out of the break room, leaving John alone. He watches her go with a smile, rotating his shoulder once more. She really is quite lovely, he thinks.
John snorts at this, and more of the residual tension from when he’d first met this man – Greg – slips away. Surely if he can call Sherlock a bastard in such a warm tone of voice, he must actually know and like him.
He’s just about to turn the knob when suddenly, the door swings open on its own, and his arm falls uselessly to his side in his surprise. An old woman is standing there, wearing an apron and smiling kindly. “Hello, dear,” she says, her eyes crinkling in the corners as she smiles. “You must be a customer for Sherlock. Come on in, then.”
John takes another sip of tea and watches while she goes to the far corner of her living room. There’s a large object with a sheet over it, and she pulls off the sheet to reveal a harp. John boggles at this and watches as she carefully folds the sheet and sets it down beside the harp, then sits behind it, reaching her arms up. She glances up and then blushes when she sees him watching her.
Sherlock rolls his eyes. “He’s not my friend. He’s my colleague, at best. I don’t have room in my mind for his name.”
“I’d think you’d be pleased,” Sherlock says. He still doesn’t turn around, and his voice is polite and controlled.
She ignores him and leans forward, setting her tea down on the table. “Every time I go somewhere with John, if I don’t invite you, you show up,” she tells him.
Angelo chuckles.  “I’m glad,” he says.  “It’s not every day we get a human customer, let alone such a powerful one as you.”
Sherlock takes another long drag of his pipe, then watches John as he lazily blows out the smoke. John does his best not to be impatient, and Sherlock smiles when all the smoke has left his mouth, and it’s like a switch has been turned on because he suddenly sits up, eyes bright and smile widening.
