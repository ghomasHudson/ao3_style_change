“John,” he said, his voice strangely modified by the fact his head had dropped forward and his chin was now digging into his throat.
“Confidence John,” Sherlock said as he began to stride across the floor, as if that answered the question.
“I’d have managed to escape by that point anyway.  No use waiting for the Guards to find me, you’d be better just looking for me yourself.”
I would do something for the next issue and I meant to do it last week but, you know, stuff happens, and now we’re here.  It’s an issue about identity so I’m taking pictures of anyone who’s willing and I’ll put it together somehow,” John said shaking his head.  He stumbled a little as he hopped down from the counter and Sherlock instinctually put out a steadying hand.  He hadn’t noticed it in the corridor, but looking directly at John’s face he could see bags under his eyes deeper than they had before and a tension in his shoulders which refused to relent.  John flinched away from Sherlock’s touch on his arm and played it off as just reaching for his camera, with a muttered thanks.
floor.  John was about to ask how he knew where he was going but it was a pointless endeavour.  He resigned himself to the unexpected, letting Sherlock know by heaving a massive sigh.  Retaliating, Sherlock poked him in the ribs with an elbow, smiling slightly.  Dammit, he knew John couldn’t resist that shy smile.
Lestrade met them outside the flat block belonging to Mr Faber and one Miss Marjorie Lincoln, his neighbour.  John’s initial thoughts were mainly comprised of thinking he’d never wondered how much peach one person could fit into a two-bedroom flat and what he could do now he knew the answer.
Three end notes: one this chapter is bloody long in comparison to the others- I'm not sure if this is the new normal because we're into the case or if it's a fluke but hopefully you enjoyed.  Two, I'm not really happy with the ending line but I had it somewhere and it was weird to end it anywhere else so there you go.  Three, I will attempt to get the next chapter up in a week but I don't have my usual weekend writing time so we'll see!
There was a chorus of “Hi John” from a few in the crowd and some others stood up straighter.  Sherlock was midway through a thought of
John leaned facing the bar, whereas Sherlock faced out to the crowd.  John tried to catch the eye of the staff but they were busy at the other end of the bar so he settled in for the long haul.  “Right.  So what we thinking about this?  Bomb threat?”
“He’s not lost keys Jas.  He doesn’t remain in one place if you leave him there.”  Although she may have a point; where had he last seen John?  To Sherlock’s despair, thinking hurt.  A lot.
“Seems to be doing just fine here.  Perhaps it was the company that put him off,” John retorted, hands flexing into fists.
fence.  And we caught the suspect so they forgave the trespassing.” Sherlock shrugged with a small smile on his face.  He then turned his face away which John has noticed him doing a lot whenever he smiled, as if he was uncertain what to do with it.
“What’s the use of CCTV when you have an almost unlimited number of guises you can pick up, if only your immoral enough.”
“Of course, but it’s no good telling him that.  Why he thought this was a good plan in the first place is beyond me,” Sherlock muttered, his eyes already flicking down the short list.
When he had slumped into his own chair, he figured Sherlock had had enough time to process.  John had made a deduction of his own, which he was very happy about.  “Which underground station does it relate to then?”
He didn’t buy into the bullshit about premonitions or an angelic sixth sense.  He did however know that once you’d done this job for a while, there was a specific sinking sensation in your stomach that happened whenever you were about to encounter something Bad.  Capital B Bad.  Around this neighbourhood he was currently walking round, a resemblance of a 21
“Oh I’m sure you’ll think of something.”  Sherlock finally reconnected their lips into another kiss.  They didn’t do much talking after that.
After a few minutes, and quite a bit of swearing, there was the sound of clattering and then Sherlock waved his arms in the air, stretching them out after their captivity.  “Got it.  Now for the cuffs on my feet.”  John felt begrudgingly impressed.  Of course even mildly high, Sherlock retained some of his skill.
New chapter? New chapter! And it didn't take me a month to write this one!  Basically this chapter contains the scene that started it all, the one idea that lodged in my head and started this whole madness, so I really really hope you enjoy it.
It was at this precise moment that John’s brain finally came back online and he remembered everything about the previous several hours including but not limited to the fact that they were on a
The doorbell rang.  Gladstone barked on instinct and skipped to the door.  In contrast, his master froze next to the mirror and looked a mixture of terrified and excited.  Everything was still upstairs for a moment as Biscuit Lady went for the door.
He’d walked a few steps into the hallway before he realised Greg was not with him.  He turned around to see him in the doorway, with a concerned look on his face.  “Has anyone ever told you you’re a strange man Watson?”
And it was that look that had them arguing about the third moment.  Sherlock still maintains he had no idea what his body was doing, how it had drifted closer until he was stood in front of his best friend.  But that term didn’t seem to fit him anymore.  John was
“Soul Pattern Recognition,” she said to John and he nodded.  SPR software could be used in conjunction with the G.O.D to confirm identities.  It was usually used for incoming souls rather than outgoing though.  “I’m part of the logging-in team here,” she explained and suddenly her presence here in the middle of the night made sense.  After all, dying didn’t exactly have office hours.
“Could you roll it back over here please?” he asked and she nervously placed it next to her on the floor and pushed it over.
“Pleasure to meet you,” he replied, equally politely.  Jasmine’s smile was rather infectious and it was difficult to fight the urge to beam right back at her, despite not knowing anything about her
“Magic,” Sherlock stated.  “Non-angelic magic.”  Angelic had at least four more syllables than it really required but John let it slide in favour of making sure his shoulder wasn’t wrenched from its socket.
At Sherlock’s words, John saw the outcome play out in the elder Holmes’ emotions and let out a breath of relief.
John grinned before he ducked his head to Sherlock’s neck again, clearly not finished mapping the area with his tongue. When Sherlock began to writhe, he moved slowly downwards, kissing a line across Sherlock’s shoulders, licking at each nipple which elicited a groan from the man trapped beneath him. Sherlock’s hips jerked upwards and he gasped as his cock briefly brushed John’s, providing a moment of friction. As soon as it was gone, he was craving more, wanting the solid press of John against him. He whined as a strong hand came to press him back into the mattress.
John cut him off.  He’d already heard the speech before.  “What did you say?”  He felt he already knew.
“Bed,” he managed to pant out, expecting John to set him on his feet.  Instead, he was lifted away from the wall and he clung on with his arms wrapped around John’s neck.
Sherlock said, slumping onto the sofa and resting his side to John’s.  He fought a smug smile when John ran a hand up his spine and rested it at the nape of his neck.  “Piss off Mycroft,” he huffed, for the second time that day.  His scowl turned into a glower when Mycroft, instead of taking the hint, came and sat in the adjacent chair.
John reluctantly took Johnson's first piece of advice.  He was fairly sure it wasn't good to start a fight over your not-boyfriend-just-a-friend at your not-boyfriend-just-a-friend's house party.  So he went and he mingled and slowly came to the realisation that most people were Irene and a guy called Victor's friends and so were friends with Sherlock via proxy.  This should not of made him as happy as it did but what people didn't know couldn't hurt them.  He also took every opportunity he could get to surreptitiously check Sherlock out.  Judging by the leering look Bill gave him he was not doing too well at the surreptitious part.  The checking out part John felt he had covered to the point he could successfully draw every inch of curve from memory.
When he did, John was grateful for the pause.  He was frozen, mesmerised.  Unwinding was not Sherlock’s speed.  But there, in the middle of the floor, he looked
He wandered out of the shop and surveyed the scene again.  The jump in vision was being caused by an alleyway, the deeper black causing it to disappear.  This shouldn’t have been a surprise or anything to note, the city full of hideaways and side streets but it couldn’t hurt to check it out, for reassurances sake.  Trying not to be so obvious, he tried to make it seem as if he was headed in the direction of the tube stop anyway, 4 cups balanced on a tray, one in his hand.  The hit of caffeine was blissful.  The tube stop seemed to be perfectly ordinary, a couple of people still meandering down into the depths of the city.  There was the usual amount of graffiti, personal tags crowding each other for dominance of the prime real estate facing the road.
“People with experience in stuff like this.  They were going to get to them before they’d even started work but they didn’t have enough evidence by that time.  I’d rather not say names; don’t want them on my tail as well.”  Sherlock decided against pushing the point; there were other questions which were decidedly more pressing.
Swoops in on the last day of March with a new chapter which means this will be done by April (barring any major catastrophes).  Big old chapter for you which hopefully makes up for the month wait and it means there's only one more chapter to go which is both a relief and terrifying.  As ever, comments and kudos are appreciated (and genuinely do make me write quicker, honest!)
“Sherlock! Thank you so much for this, you really...” John trailed off as he realised where Sherlock was stood, leaning on his room’s door.  “You alright? Didn’t set anything on fire?”  At the lack of immediate response John admonished with a “Sherlock!”
“Consulting Detective.  Only one in the world” Sherlock said, pulling himself away from Angelo to be at his full height.  If there was one thing he was proud of it was his career.  He’d fought hard for it and it was his alone.
His natural curiosity had always overcome any embarrassment or sense of societal propriety.  Questions had answers and Sherlock wanted answers, so Sherlock asked questions.  It was as simple as that.
home.  The idea of returning empty handed was unbearable, to the point that it might be better not to try at all.
Luckily he did not have to resort to throwing himself on the ground and was sat in the same car as John for the ride to Scotland Yard, mainly because they were walking as if surgically attached, but also because Molly said that if she had to spend one minute more with them she would officially "lose it".  On the journey John insisted on checking up on him, making him follow his fingers with his eyes etc, and Sherlock half-heartedly rolled his eyes and played along.
His hands twitched where he had them shoved in his pockets.  Suddenly he had a new set of questions.
, as if he cared enough to make things, and why were they bothering him, couldn’t they see he was Very Busy?  This was all undermined by Molly finding what appeared to be half of Hobbycraft stuffed in the back of his wardrobe when
He was still telling himself this when he couldn’t move out of bed the next day because his core muscles had seized up.
“In order to make this work, we’re going to need to be secretive.  It’s not going to take long before those on the ground realise something’s gone sideways which means we need to do this properly.  Molly’s already received orders to vet as many of her people as she can so we can start going through this-”
He stumbled out of the shower in much the same way as he stumbled into it, feeling slightly more exhausted than when he went in.  He wandered back into his room and glanced at the clock.  7:30am.  Only 11 and a half hours to go.
Lestrade heaved himself up as well.  “Correction, you work better with John.”  Was he really that obvious?  “But, lacking him, I’m second-best.  A lengthy second-best, but still, John’s missing, there’s a shady conspiracy at the Council, and you just collapsed, so supervision is required.”
.”  John looked two seconds away from storming out the room and punching the older angel in the face.  As much as Sherlock wanted to see that however and as happy as he was for dodging the blame, he wanted to keep John to himself for a few moments before his brother inevitably came to split them up again.
Lestrade nodded.  “I don’t think he does either.  But it would be useful for him and you if he can help clear his own name about this.”  They shared a look, one that said ‘Look after yourself first.  And him if you can.’  John was determined to do both.
He tried to concentrate but it was difficult with Molly’s final words ringing in his ears.  “Just ask him out.”  Like it would be that easy.  Just going up and asking John out.  Who did she think she was talking to?  And as if John would even
“Well at least you’ll prove to be an interesting study when you’re dead.  May I be the first to call dibs?” Sherlock mused.
“That would only work if you didn’t run off every two seconds.  I’d probably go home, thinking you were on the chase.  It’d be days before I sent someone out looking for you.”
Lestrade nodded.  “So, let me check if I’ve got this straight up to now.  A rogue individual, or set of individuals, in the Council has been manipulating their power by allowing Fallen’s into the Council limits.  Those Fallen’s have taken on the identities of angels and obliterating them in the process.  Why?  And how the hell are we going to prove any of this?”
As John had stated many times to himself, this was all a trap.  He knew it was a trap.  Sherlock knew it was a trap.  No one should be surprised by it being a trap.
chance that a Fallen would recognise me, and seeing me here would probably alert them to the fact their little club has been discovered.  The Faber-Fallen may have recognised me but wouldn’t have known I was searching for the symbols, just the body.  Here, I have no such cover,” he explained, answering what would have been John’s next question.
John, instead of laughing however, looked inordinately pleased.  “Aw, well, thanks,” he said, scratching the back of his neck.  He did that when he was happy but unclear how to show it.  Don’t ask how Sherlock knew this.  His mastery of human body language had somewhat extended to ridiculous levels in a short amount of time when it came to John Watson.  “So busy weekend coming up?”
“They’ll have taken on another personality by now.  We need to know if there’s been another murder, see if there’s a lead.”  Sherlock looked ready to run off again and John was determined not to have a repeat of yesterday.
Fists clenched.  One foot after the other.  Find the faux-river.  Watch the storm clouds roll in.  Stomping footsteps and a rolling stomach.  Don’t think about it.  How
interesting, some odd detail or a person of note but alas no.  The people, despite their gym fixations, were boringly ordinary; a lawyer, an IT consultant, a student, and an amateur athlete.  Another dramatic sigh went unheard, Mrs Hudson’s selective hearing kicking in as usual when her tenant was being particularly difficult.  He didn’t care anyway.  His perfectly valid concerns (or whinging as Mrs Hudson called it) were met with talk of how he couldn’t expect serial killers to turn up out of thin air and how he should be happy,
, we can work forwards.”  He sighed at their blank faces.  They were nearly they, they just needed- “When a Fallen comes through a portal, what’s the one thing they need?  A
“I think we should get out of here don’t you?” John said, his voice husky.  Right, yes, restaurant.  Priorities.  Get home.  Get
“Okay,” Sherlock said and he quickly kissed him. John allowed him control for a minute, dropping his hands to Sherlock’s waist. It was therefore surprising for Sherlock to feel his feet leave the ground for a second before he fell sideways onto the bed. He rolled onto his back, intending to glare but before he could, John had crawled on top of him, laughing. Sherlock’s breathing stuttered as John rested his arms either side of his head, knees bracketing around his hips, holding himself up.
John wasn’t convinced but he also didn’t want to be fired and lose his only means of income.  “Look, just let Lestrade know what you’re doing.”
“Okay,” Victor said, looking slightly more relaxed, “Sherlock, meet Oli.  Oli, this is Sherlock, the guy I told you about.”
notice the way the silence served to make his actions seem much too loud in the emptiness of the flat, making him feel like a caged animal, feel like he had to run.
“This man drove the taxi that John and I took here,” he said, nearly stabbing the image on the tablet.
“It happened in Afghanistan.  I wasn’t just shot at random, like everyone assumes.  They, they gave me something.  I don’t know what it is so don’t bother asking but all I know is that now I can do things.  I’m stronger, faster, can heal quicker...”  He trailed off, unsure how to continue.
“Oh, hey Sherlock, it’s Molly.”  The muted bustle in the background suggested she was in the cafeteria.  So much for the body.
He stared for a moment.  Then he turned round and cut Lestrade’s exasperated reply before it started.
Maybe Sherlock was onto something.  John Watson looked like he hadn’t slept.  He was slumped on a bench, clutching a to-go coffee, hair ruffled, still in the clothes he was in yesterday and was a general mess.
“You said you had a case, give me no details and then leave a voicemail with nothing but an address and time.  I’m starting to feel like I’m in one of the awful spy movies John insists on watching.”  Victor smiled but it didn’t reach his eyes.  Still worried then.
He could faintly hear Sherlock panting, still chasing his own release and then still and felt his come combine with his own on his stomach and chest.  Sherlock slumped down next to him and they both stayed there, Sherlock curled up round John as they both calmed down.
He grabbed his secondary, secret sketchbook from the bottom of his bag.  The one he used while John was at rugby practice.  He flipped it open and shoved it across the table.  John was still looking at him with panic and slight annoyance (but the sadness was gone).  He sat down and slowly pulled the book towards him.
If you see any glaring mistakes that is because I suck at grammar and any constructive criticism is really appreciated if you see any plot holes forming. Have a good week and hopefully I'll have another chapter up soon :)
.  He was going to have to have words when the real-John was home.  This inability to think properly was unacceptable and entirely the angel’s fault, his presence being the only change in his life to have real impact.  His mind wandered to the dance floor of that awful club, how he had indulged, just for a second his love of dancing, because it couldn’t hurt the investigation could it, a little bit of dancing?  Seeing John stalk his way towards him and being so close together.  He didn’t really think about personal space but despite being near each other, they never really touched, just ghosted near each other.  Sherlock had wondered though, what it would be like to touch properly, to brush a hand over a hand when walking home, to press knees together in a cab ride, to lean over on the sofa and press his side against the solid form of another.  And then finally he gets his chance and everything falls apart.  Figures.
Well obviously, Sherlock thought.  He then struggled to think of a reply.  Although not used to receiving compliments himself, he was always grateful to hear praise for his hound (especially when they were entirely truthful).  He really was an excellent dog and to know people recognised that was somehow important to him for reasons he didn’t want to question.
“Yes you said at the beginning.”  Rude.  Backtrack, backtrack, backtrack!  “But yes, I am new here.  I’m Sherlock,” he said sticking his hand out.  It took him roughly six seconds to realise that a) he did not normally shake hands with people and b) his hands were really gross after an hour-long workout and he did not want his first impression to be of a rude man who couldn’t breathe properly and had sweaty hands.  Unfortunately, this was 4 seconds too late to do anything about as John had already grasped his hand.  He even had the courtesy not to wipe his hand on his top afterwards.
“Be weird if we hadn’t heard anything, it being so close,” John pointed out and Sherlock smiled at him.
John bit his lip to stop himself laughing.  He ran his hands down so he was rubbing Sherlock’s arms so he could get a better look at his eyes.  “Sherlock Holmes, are you drunk?”
He thought the distraction might help him slip away but alas, Lestrade regarded him suspiciously.  “And what will you be doing while we become buried under case files?”
Sherlock glanced around and four people suddenly had a violent interest in their coffee, friend, shoes, and ceiling respectively.  “Are you sure they aren’t looking at you?” Sherlock said.  John tried to stop himself from laughing.
John was speaking oddly.  Stilted.  He was also wearing a green duffel coat, about two sizes too large for him, which Sherlock had never seen before.
“Well it doesn’t matter because I do like you so there!”  Not his finest romantic moment.  John was looking at him, completely blind-sided.
the Victoria Vigilante?” he asked incredulously, desperately hoping he was both right and wrong at the same time.
The loss of his John’s body heat makes it worse, the shuddering and Sherlock would make a noise if he remembered how. Even John smudging a kiss onto his shoulder wasn’t enough. His world splinters more and he can’t contain everything he’s feeling, all the things he’d locked away because he
Sherlock glanced down at his usual button-down, suit, and coat combo.  “These are my clothes.  This is how I dress.”
“You can ask.  I don’t mind,” Sherlock added, although his mouth twisted and he put the biscuits down.
The ‘Sherlock was an incredibly good looking genius who could be an arrogant sod but also incredibly thoughtful and funny when he wanted to be and was awakening his latent bi feelings’ problem.
He didn’t notice at first.  Might not have noticed at all, if the door hadn’t slammed, startling him and nearly ruining the left wing of his latest bee sketch.  After glaring at the culprit, he turned back to the bench and saw it.
After a while, Lestrade leaned back in his chair and, as if pulled by a counterweight, Sherlock sat up.  John, who had become increasingly bored and had zoned out, pulled his attention back into the room opposite.
Sherlock whimpered, eyes flickering between lips and eyes, unable to choose one.  He leant up to try and capture John’s lips in a kiss but John moved back with a soft laugh.
Now there was a lovely thought.  Not helpful right now though.  Concentrate John.  His head was resting on something soft yet too solid to be a pillow.  Smelt good whatever it was.  Earthy.  He could feel the occasional rumbling noise under his left ear.  Like a tractor.  Was he in a field?
“Greg, one, that’s really weird.  Two, your manslaughtering drug dealer just tried to attack Sherlock.  Maybe we want to prioritise slightly.”
“John, I need you to remember everything you saw.”  Sherlock’s voice was low and soft and so very, very close.
“Can’t hear you!” Sherlock’s voice yelled down the stairs, despite the fact this was blatantly untrue.  They marched up after him and John paused in the doorway to witness 6ft of Fallen trying valiantly to ignore the presence of a 5ft4 woman glaring at him. However, whatever silent conversation, or threat, Mrs Hudson was trying to convey was lost on the angel, and John interrupted.
He remembered Sherlock had been working on case.  He remembered Sherlock sighing for most of the afternoon and dramatically flouncing about the flat, sulking about something.  He remembered Sherlock acting like a dick.  He remembered telling Sherlock this. Sherlock huffing and telling him to piss off.  Watching telly pointedly ignoring idiotic flatmate.  Idiotic flatmate being purposefully loud to cover tv noise.  Giving up and going for a shower.  Going to bed.  Dreaming.
John shrugged, crossing his arms across his chest.  He spoke to his shoes.  “That it could work out.”
“That was his soul, yes,” Sherlock said, leaning back in his chair and propping his hands under his chin.  John could almost see the pieces of evidence, like Tetris pieces or a Rubik’s cube, moving and shifting, clicking into place.  He wished, not for the first time, that he could see what Sherlock did, see how it all fit together.
“You know I think I’ve worked out why you don’t wear these bloody things,” he said, scowling at the offending item.  Sherlock was glad because this gave him time to pick his jaw up from the floor and wrestle back the urge to tear off John’s suit until he was left in nothing
,” he said as he caught up with Sherlock’s words and a wicked smile, the exact smile Sherlock had imagined on him, lit up his face.
“Hey,” John said, pressing another kiss to Sherlock’s cheek which made him blush madly.  “You look amazing.”
“I prefer the term consulted.  Adds a little legitimacy you know?  Jim Moriarty,” he said with a little nod to John.
“John does,” Molly said, with conviction, clearly seeing Sherlock’s mood spiralling quickly south.  “And I do.  And Mrs Hudson, and Greg, and yes, even your brother.  People can be awful but you, Sherlock Holmes, are not one of them and I think John sees that.  And so what if he doesn’t like you?  He’s just one person out of seven billion.”
Sherlock lifted his head up to look at John suspiciously.  He might have looked more intimidating if his hair didn't look so wild.
John was slightly stunned.  Sherlock rarely stumbled over his words, as if he’d already planned out a conversation in his head and was simply going through the motions to confirm your answers.
“What do you see?” Sherlock asked quietly.  He hadn’t moved, only indicating he’d spoken with a sly look at John.
“Um, sure, I’ll see if I can go,” he tried to smile in a way that conveyed something close to interest.  Thank god he’d had a lot of practice at it.
What they were attempting was not a small task.  For, despite the tube being a relatively recent invention in the history of the universe, humans were tricky bastards.  There were multiple underground railways in use across the world at any one time, and they were constantly updating the bloody things, so each new section of city had a new part of the tube line.  These were dated according to the year any major updates took place, meaning the entire London side dated back to 1863, New York to 1904.  More tubes, meant more tube stops, meant more monitoring, meant more of John wanting to bash his head against the opposing wall.  Sherlock insisted on a small team however.
He groaned, swung himself up and his legs out of bed in one motion, having to pause as the blood rush made him dizzy.  The walk to the bathroom was not one of his most elegant states but he managed to stumble in and turn on the shower.  As he waited for the water to heat up, he leant his back against the small patch of free wall space, and took himself in hand, panting as the room steamed up and he stroked himself lazily.  Slow and light, only teasingly, but enough to stop the skin crawling feeling of unattended arousal which was humming through his groin.
No one knew what Sherlock did when he wasn’t at the Yard.  It wasn’t as if he discussed his weekend plans with any of them and frankly, beforehand, no one had thought to ask.  It was like Sherlock was a teacher from school; you never thought of them having lives outside it until you spot them in the frozen section supermarket one day.  However, all attempts to follow him were futile.  Upon leaving the Yard, Sherlock would either hail a cab that brought him directly back to Baker Street or scurried off down an alleyway and disappear.
“Hey, they’re trying their best with no prior training.  You think criminal masterminds are paying £25 a head for cocktail-making sessions?”
Lestrade looked ready to argue the point.  However Sherlock, annoyed at the interruption to the victorious unveiling of aforementioned theory, sighed loudly.  “Please
“My god you’re both so cute.  Stupid but cute,” Molly sighed.  Sherlock thought about defending himself but then imagined that this would once again derail the conversation.  He settled on instead asking the question that had been haunting him since John had asked him to dinner.
It turned out that Barry Faber did not have many people in the afterlife he called ‘friend’.  This suited some people and, in this instance, made everyone’s lives a little easier.
Annoyingly good questions.  “There must be a reason, I’m just not seeing it.”  Not-John made a face.  Sherlock ignored it, shaking his head.  “We need to review the data we have, look at everyone that’s been obliterated, see if there’s a pattern I hadn’t noticed before.”
“This man,” Angleo said, dragging Sherlock into a side-hug, “let me tell you, I owe everything to him!  He saved me from a murder charge!”
Hello again.  I don't know what to say other than these past few weeks have been crazy, plus I kind of lost my inspiration for a bit so that's why it's taken so long for this to be written.  It will be finished though, I swear! I feel a lot more like writing now so hopefully the next chapter won't be too long behind this one.  I'm aiming to finish it before I start Uni in late September so fingers crossed! Hope you like this chapter and please if there's any mistakes or constructive criticisms please tell me! They help so much.
“Only if you’re lucky,” John said, giving in and pressing his lips to Sherlock’s.  It was sweet to begin with, more hesitant than their earlier desperation.  The adrenaline of seeing each other had worn off with his brother’s intrusion and the road-bump of the wings issue.  Now they were both fully aware of the choice they were making and neither seemed to want to push too far too soon, to ask for too much from the other.  In fact, it was oddly polite.
“Can easily be found here.  My brother inevitably knows people.  Also, if there’s one thing I am certain of it is that people can find endlessly creative ways of killing each other.  Should keep me entertained.”
“Yes.  I do have a life outside of you, you know.”  This was not an entire lie but perhaps an exaggeration.  He had seen Mike at some point (probably) and had gone to a house party only to leave early because he found it boring.
He stood up and Sherlock panicked this was less sweet and more stalkerish and John had decided to leave.  One picture was a gesture, a book seemed an obsession.  Those thoughts were quickly stopped when John stood up, leaned over and kissed him, kissed him right there, in the middle of the Quad.  John’s hand ran up and buried itself in the curls at the back of his head, pulling him closer.  The table in between them had never been more annoying.
and so having another person, or people, around was a good thing for both of them.  Didn’t mean he had to enjoy it though.
“Yes, well, they are.  Good I mean.  Very good even.  I’m really very happy actually,” Molly said, sounding both flustered and shy but still meaning every stumbled word.
to be here with my boyfriend, although he appears to have run off somewhere, as always.  What about you?”
“Indeed, your very own precious Council. I was here entirely legitimately in fact.  Not something I ever want to do again, far too easy.”
“Yes,” was the reply, a short glance over to John before his gaze returned to the bookshelf, haphazardly filled with various stacks of books yet to be properly sorted or which were being pulled down.
and although his combat scores were good, his medical affinity was higher and he was placed on a front-line medical base, the natural limits on his powers weakened and his own strengths unleashed.  There was a certain high John rode throughout the war, even in the darkest times when the most heinous atrocities were committed, angels obliterated out of existence before his very eyes, because what he was doing was righteous, he was
So Lestrade began to explain.  He summarised the situation as best he could, tracing the events from the stake-out, to the kidnapping, to the Council, to the
Sherlock shrugged.  “I like puzzles.  I don’t want someone telling me that I have to solve one over another and I like taking cases they can’t, especially international cases or ones where people require discretion.  Jewellery theft in manor houses, blackmail in Ukraine, a locked room murder in Paris.  Also, if I had to fill out that much paperwork I’d jump from the 6
“Tell me more,” John distracted him.  “Tell me what you thought of and I’ll tell you what I thought.”
“You stole my laptop and the tabs were open.  You should be more careful with your secret crushed,” John retorted, wagging a finger in Sherlock’s direction.  It was easier to tease him because the only alternative was to start to hyperventilate.  That may have been slightly suspicious and John had
What followed was a 20 minute argument about who was responsible for whose relationships, both present and past until both conceded that perhaps maybe, just maybe, they were even.
Moriarty didn’t seem inclined to rush, instead running his arm across John’s shoulders before releasing him and looking around.  “One of the original platforms you know,” he said, nodding at the surroundings.  “1863 Metropolitan line.”
Virtual was easier however, allowing for the expansion of their dimension to be recorded in real time.  A new bit was made on earth? Create a new bit in the afterlife.  It was like the galaxy expanding into nothingness, apart from here the humans didn’t give a shit as to
"Irene, the barista, said I should talk to you."  John stopped smiling.  Suddenly he regretted his understanding with the barista.  She clearly had sold him out.
Sherlock looked from John around the room once more, and then shrugged.  So much for ‘Sherlock Holmes: solvable of the unsolvable’ a nickname John had just come up with and which he would now never bestow upon Sherlock Holmes.  Satisfied with his scoping of the first floor, the detective moved towards the stairs.  “Well my brother’s goons would be annoyed having to navigate them every time they came to keep tabs on me.”
There were other habits too.  Sherlock veered between never eating, running on coffee and will power (“Angels don’t need to sleep John.” “Yes they do.” “Well they shouldn’t.  A fatal design flaw if you ask me.”), and John catching him eating ice cream by the tub out the freezer at 4 in the morning (“I thought you were a burglar!  And eat something that isn’t just sugar, you’ll be bouncing off the walls.”).  There were more body parts, synthetic ones this time, although occasionally a real specimen came through the door and John restrained himself from asking where they had come from.  In the pursuit of cases Sherlock had, in the three weeks John had lived there: filled the bathtub with frog spawn, eaten 43 varieties of cheese with copious notes taken on each, set fire to a set of ornate wooden dolls (purposeful) and a cupboard door (accidental), and spent a memorable afternoon on roller-skates which John cried laughing about, despite the Fallen’s protests it was actually very serious John!  A woman’s soul hangs in the balance!
“You think someone’s going to be murdered here tonight?” John asked seriously.  Both him and Lestrade had straightened up at Sherlock’s words, ready for action.
“Then enlighten me.”  Both froze.  John knew he had the power here.  He could walk away, refuse to explain and ignore it all and strangely he thought Sherlock would let him.  He sighed and looked towards the ceiling.
Their first kiss could be called chaste.  Sweet even.  When they had returned home, both of them finally
Which was why he was outside 221 Baker Street.  Sherlock's house.  For a party.  A party at Sherlock's house.  With Sherlock there.  In attendance.
There were 12 Council members.  One was clearly absent so 11 to investigate.  Despite ostensibly having control over the entirety of the Above, their identities were slightly mysterious.  Names were available but gaining access to the building was a challenge, never mind meetings with members themselves.  That’s why he preferred using the fire escape and slipping in through the door on the roof.  Then, simply walk with confidence.  Some knew who he was, or more accurately who he was related to, but for those that didn’t, setting a brisk pace warded off any questions about his presence.
Things were looking good and he was fiddling with his camera, taking some test shots to see if the lighting was correct when Sherlock showed up.
Sherlock was still frowning as if he was going to argue but something must have made him change his mind as he nodded.
Sherlock ran through possible options: either 1) John was downstairs with Mrs Hudson (unlikely, he would have heard them as he walked in), 2) John had been kidnapped by either his brother (highly likely) or, 3) John was upstairs which meant that John was hiding or upset (unknown likelihood).
“It isn’t, I mean, I don’t know how much you saw but, it’s not, I mean,” Sherlock stammered.  John found it both endearing and alarming in equal measure.  “It’s not what it looks like.”  He finally stated and then crossed his arms huffily.
4) As ever I hope you enjoy this chapter! There's not a lot of action but it was as if Sherlock wouldn't stop!  John will make an appearance again next chapter, don't worry!
“So, who is trying to threaten you?  And don’t bothering saying you have no idea, everyone has enemies of one kind or another,” Sherlock asked directly after Jake had sat down and Victor had introduced them.  Jake gaped at Sherlock, turning to Victor who nodded in confirmation that, yes, he was always like this.
He stayed where he was in John’s lap, surprisingly comfortable and before he knew it, his eyelids grew heavier, his breathing levelled out and he was asleep.
The figure swivelled his head and John had to resist the urge to duck down out of site.  The only thing more suspicious than being sat in a car, in the dark, in the early hours of the morning, would be to try and look like you weren’t in the car.
It was actually quite simple, just a well placed blow to the abdomen to wind him and then an incapacitating blow to the head.  He should be fine.  Probably.  Maybe.  John didn’t really care.  There were other problems than an unconscious criminal.
.”  Sherlock’s head lolled back slightly.  It had the unfortunate effect of squishing John’s already tender skull, dulling the impact of his sweet words.
The door slammed shut behind Lestrade.   Sherlock flexed his wings in frustration, and John half expected he would just whirl out the door anyway, but to John’s surprise, he simply flung himself into a plastic chair.
A new pair of pyjamas thrown on, he slouched into the living room and rolled himself onto the sofa.  Only his mind palace would be of any use today but on the other hand he didn’t want to get so lost in his own head he would either a) have a repeat of this morning or b) miss the date entirely.
Luckily for John he had time for these thoughts as the other occupants of the alley were busy.  “Going somewhere?” rumbled the Fallen’s deep voice.
“Tosser.  Though because you remember me, I expect a birthday present this year.  Unlike last year.  You know, when you forgot.”
“There are a million tells you are military: the hair, the stance, the way you hold your wings.  But guard-duty means you are no longer in active service.  When this lot were going to stay put, you went to put up your left hand but winced and quickly shifted to your right.  Your shoulders are tense and there’s no other obvious sign of external injury, so left shoulder injury.  You really
However, the City, like it’s former patron, was never idle and there was too much to take in.  His body was tired. His mind was weary. What he needed was a break, a pause in time to regroup and reconnect.
He was going for coffee with his gorgeous neighbour and was going to explain his project to him.  This was fine.  He could do this.  So long as he remembered how to breathe.
“You wanted to talk to me about something?” John prompted and Sherlock realised he had been staring.  How attractive.
Curiosity was one of Sherlock’s dominant personality traits.  Everyone in the greater London area knew this.  He tried convincing himself John really was scowling about rugby practice.  He really did. But he knew it wasn’t true so he couldn’t.  He tried working out the scowl from context but there were so few details apart from John a) was truly concentrating meaning it had special meaning for him and b) he definitely did not want Sherlock to see.  Useless theorising without all the facts.
“I’ll offer you a deal.  I’ll find out who your mystery backer is and prevent them from attacking you further
Sherlock gripped the back of the office chair.  “But that could take decades...”  The thought was horrific.
However, the place wasn’t entirely neglected.  The walls were not crumbling, no damp sprawled over walls and ceilings.  No sign of squatters which was unusual- this should have been prime real estate.
221B finally came into view.  Sherlock launched himself out so John paid and walked slowly upstairs.
“Still getting out of trouble I see,” Raz said, looking disdainfully at Sherlock.  “The fuck are you dressed as?”
Several things happened in that second.  Guards crashed through the barriers and appeared at the upper level of the station, above the platform.  Moriarty stepped backwards with a look of shock freezing his features, as if to run.  Sherlock stepped forward to intervene.  But before any of them could do anything, John swung round, hands raised.
Sherlock kept repeating these to himself as he walked the few steps it took to stand before John.  His first instinct was to bury his face into John’s neck, to wrap his arms around him, to feel himself become enwrapped in his John, to feel the reassurance of his touch, his voice.
John nodded.  All he wanted was to spend more time with Sherlock and so he'd pretty much of agreed to anything that kept them together.  They were quiet for a moment and John was just about to doze off when Sherlock added, sleepily:
There were roughly four streets between Angelo’s and Baker Street.  This was somehow far too long, and they only made it halfway down the first street before Sherlock felt himself being dragged sideways into an alleyway and pushed up against a wall.  John’s hands clutched his hips and a knee pushed his legs apart as he hungrily kissed Sherlock.  Surprised but not to be outdone, Sherlock pushed back, twisting his hand into John’s hair, the other running over his jaw.  John moaned and pulled back panting.
.  Like he was happy for John but there was the pressing matter of illegal Fallen’s running around in Council limits to consider, as well as the fact they were in
He’d slunk out of his room an hour later than usual, not quite sure if he hoped Sherlock was in or out.  Seeing him sat at the kitchen table, nudging something on a petri dish with a pipette, took his breath away.  Red silk robe at odds with the threadbare t-shirt and the goggles perched on his head.  His curls were a perfect riot, not smoothed into careful dishevelment but on their own mission to defy gravity.  John’s hands twitched, as if to run through them.  His lips tingled as if begging to press a kiss to his forehead.  He was adorable, wonderful, he was fantastic, and he was so gone it was ridiculous.
John smiled.  “Good to know.  I’m sure Molly will have something for you to dismantle.  Also, your hair’s stuck up weird.”
A few weeks went by.  Many began to drop out, believing it was one question that would never be answered.  However, a few braver and steadfast participants decided to carry on, thought their attempts were often short-lived and unsuccessful.  Many began (and ended) like so:
“She can handle herself.”  John frowned at Sherlock, who merely raised an eyebrow and hailed a cab.  John followed him in and continued his defence of home safety.
obvious?  There was no mistaking his expression.  He was in love with whoever was behind that camera and it was then that Sherlock decided he’d had enough of patience.  Was this why John was avoiding him?
“Well you can thank me for saving all of your fancy bits later, when we return to a safe, un-burgled flat.”
“Did Lestrade film some of yesterday?”  His voice was scratchy and deep, and John had to repress a shiver.
John kissed him quiet and shifted his weight so he can push an arm down between them.  “Quiet now,” he says, resting their foreheads together as he wraped a hand around both of them.  He dragged his hand up and down a few times, spreading their combined pre-come and making glorious friction.  Sherlock knows he’s babbling, knows he’s making no sense, mixing “oh” and “John” and “please” and “yes”.  John moveed his hand as quick as he can in the limited space and Sherlock’s back with that heat built up in his abdomen, growing and growing in intensity.  Everything around him is John, his smell, his taste, his heat, his noise, everything, everything and he can’t hold on any longer.
Sherlock hadn’t lied about playing violin, nor had Mrs Hudson about his odd hours.  Sometimes he was there when John awoke, hunched over the kitchen table enraptured, others he was nowhere to be seen, and on a few memorable occasions John left him dozing on the sofa only to find him still there the morning after.  However, John never felt that he was in the way of something, or that he was trapped upstairs.  The muffled notes of the violin were soothing and John found he slept much better under the roof of 221B, safe in a room which was small enough to make his belongings look noticeable without feeling like he’d been shoved in the box room for convenience’s sake.
"Sorry it's messy in here," Sherlock explained as he rifled for something.  "We had to shove a lot of stuff in here so there was room."  He gestured to the pile of books that were stacked on the floor and the small table next to it.
Every moment spent in their sketching sessions was spent trying to not think about the back of the sketchbook, thinking about it, getting annoyed at himself for thinking about it, and beginning the cycle all over again.  It was so pedestrian.
“Well if the mountain won’t come to Mohammed…”  He said it automatically, uncertain of where he had picked up the phrase or why it was important to keep.
Sherlock ignored him.  “Mrs Hudson?” Sherlock yelled as a small, older woman appeared out of a side-door.  And it was a woman, a human woman rather than an angel.  Dressed in lilac cardigan, white shirt, and long sensible skirt, but also a pair of boots that wouldn’t look amiss on a 19
John sighed heavily.  "Just in case you've forgotten in the 5 seconds since I last said it, he's not my lover boy.  You are not to refer to him as lover boy.  Ever."
“Great idea,” Molly agreed and the three of them hurriedly scarpered from the house for a few hours, leaving the boys to their reuniting in peace.
“Look, just shut up alright,” Lestrade said tiredly, scrapping a hand over his face.  “I’m going to go get the car, we’ll be able to keep it near those parked ones down there so we ‘re not as noticeable and it’ll give us a good vantage point.”  He said the last bit to himself, already moving down the road.  “Stay there,” he shouted back to the other two.  Their matching innocent “who me?” expressions made me him smile as he walked away.
Sherlock partially collapsed against the front desk, waiting an appropriate amount of time before following John out.
Well, Molly did.  But at this moment Molly could have turned into a space-travelling giraffe being followed by a Mariachi band and his gaze wouldn’t have wavered from the sight of John pinning Jack to the ground by straddling his back, holding Jack’s arms in what must have been a painful hold.
Sherlock raised an eyebrow but Victor just smirked at him.  They followed the mystery boy up to the 3
Sherlock was uncertain what to take offense to first: the fact he would act so obviously out-of-character or the fact Molly was texting about his personal life.
Delicacy was not the object here but as they hared up the flight, John attempted to lessen the sound of stampeding elephants.  He didn’t spare a glance for the bedroom they sprinted through, his only focus how quickly Sherlock was opening the window and thus how fast they could make their escape.  As Sherlock went first, John listened as the person downstairs shouted “Hello?”
John sighed and stalked over to where Sherlock had finished harassing everyone and was peering into the foot-well of the driver’s seat.  He was not avoiding the question.  It was just inappropriate.  Obviously.
There was a dire moment when he was stood looking at his wardrobe, completely unable to find anything suitable to wear.  Luckily, if unconventionally, a dishevelled, mostly dressed Sherlock burst in with a muttered “for the love of-”, threw some items at John, and hurricaned-out with his wet hair and undone buttons.  John told himself that his shortness of breath was surprise at Sherlock’s entrance.  Just surprised.  Indeed, he was still surprised all throughout getting dressed, even down to putting his socks and shoes on.
Of course, he also locked the door, so John could not follow.  Or so Lestrade couldn’t get in.  It was not clear which he intended.
I.”  The worlds tumbled out incomprehensible.  Because he didn’t want to take them back, not really, but if he didn’t something terrible might happen, like John might voluntarily leave and that cannot be allowed to happen, not when he’d just got him back and-
“Okay, I’ll talk it through.  I’m looking for a guy’s missing right arm.  Next thing I know a Fallen’s wandering around with a singular arm that’s not his own.  I know I’m not the greatest detective,” (here he ignored the Fallen’s scoffed “Obviously”), “but I don’t think this is looking great for you.”
“They better not be stealing you away from my classes too often,” John teased.  Molly had known about John and had not told him about him?  What was wrong with her?  And she called herself a friend.
It was as the first creak of the stairs occurred that John launched himself out the window.  He half-slid the window down but Sherlock pushed him out the way and down the set of metal stairs, reminiscent of the one’s they had climbed in the other building.  Leaving Sherlock to shut the window, he clattered down.  They led to the back of the buildings, the thin land between this set of terraced houses and the next.  Not wanting to risk another house-break, he took a left.  God he hoped Sherlock had made it out. He spared a glance back, and sure enough the Fallen was right behind him.  John dropped back, Sherlock’s navigational skills being sharper and he was led a twisting route that somehow landed them at the back of Baker Street.  Sherlock threw himself at the sliding ladder that consisted of their own fire escape and gestured for John to go up first.  He scampered up and shoved the window open.  It took a few tries, the old wooden frame protesting at such treatment but eventually it reluctantly offered enough space for John to fall through.  He ended up sprawled on the floor of Sherlock’s bedroom.  A few moments later, Sherlock slipped through the window, elegant as always and immediately asked “John what
suit, and he was trying to distract himself from being distracted by Sherlock and basically, it wasn’t the poor woman’s fault.  They had been stood waiting for the barkeeper for quite a while and they exchanged the usual questions about who they were and why they were there and how they knew so-and-so.  Then she laughed.  And then she touched his arm.
“John,” Sherlock began hesitantly which had the effect of making John feel even worse.  Sherlock sounded scared.  Sherlock, who would run after criminals, jump over buildings, had gone and fought Moriarty without even knowing what had happened.  Yet he, John Watson, was scaring Sherlock and for what?  His own failure to let go of Moriarty was simultaneously hurting himself and Sherlock and that needed to stop.  Sherlock was better than that.
“Slowly,” John ordered but Sherlock waved at him dismissively.  He then looked at his palm in surprise.  There was a gash, where he had landed on a piece of the metal strewn across the floor that he had identified not fifteen minutes earlier.
“CCTV.”  He pushed Lestrade, whose chair rolled so far, he had to grab onto the end of the desk to stop himself flying into a wall.
Lestrade shrugged.  “If his souls registered, it should be fine.  Part of the reason the others can’t get down is because their souls don’t match their bodies.  Wait,” he turned to Sherlock scowling.  “How do we you’re actually Sherlock?”
Ring John.  Perhaps he’d just stepped out for something.  There was no need to panic.  Absolutely no need at all.  Not panicking.
Sally sighed in exasperation when she saw the black cab pull up opposite.  It seemed her few Sherlock-free days were over.  She didn’t know where the consultant had been but so long as he wasn’t around, she was fairly happy just to get on with her work for once.
People didn’t quite understand John Watson and Sherlock Holmes relationship.  They couldn’t care less, so long as they had each other, and the light, paper and pens.
didn’t work then the experiments would start up.  John could honestly say every day was an adventure.  And every few nights, when the cases weren’t forthcoming or Sherlock was thinking which meant he was formally dismissed, he would climb the stairs, pretend to go to bed, change into his black body gear and steal out the window.  On the rare occurrences Sherlock noticed his absence, he feigned ignorance and said that Sherlock probably didn’t realise he’d left.  It worked perfectly.
“Sorry. Mrs Hudson said I could come straight up. I was in the area so figured it was easiest just to drop by.”
Sherlock sipped his tea moodily.  John didn’t realise before Sherlock that someone could drink tea with any sort of emotion.
“They do little else,” Sherlock said and ended the conversation by kissing him again.  He was not in control for long however.  John’s thoughts had obviously been running in line with Sherlock’s as he found himself spun around and pushed up against the door.  The wooden frame bit into his back and his head thudded against the door.  John looked like he was going to say something along the lines of “you alright?” but Sherlock couldn’t be bothered explaining that the only way he would be alright would be if John didn’t stop kissing him ever for the rest of time, so he dragged John by his coat lapels against him and groaned into a filthy kiss.
Lestrade sighed.  “Sorry there isn’t more to it.  All the technical elements have been dealt with.  You’re registered on the system, the link to the Below seems good.  Had orders that this was a great place for it.  All that’s needed now is you.”
As he looked were bid, John saw what the others had.  It was less noticeable in the crowd of other marks and with the glare street and shop lights, but sure enough, there was a small, bright yellow symbol on the wall.  It was further along than where the original symbol had been.
to know, otherwise the entire thing is pointless.”  Sherlock looked like he was going to refuse so Lestrade added “Otherwise no case at all and I’ll arrest you for interference in an active investigation.”
It had been three months since their residency on Earth had become a permanent fixture and, considering everything, they felt it was going quite well.  They were both alive for one thing.  They had a roof over their head, food and water, they were
“Hey,” Sherlock said, pressing a small kiss to John’s lips and forehead.  He suddenly felt exhausted.
Then Sherlock above him, hands all over his body, nuzzling his neck, letting his own hands come up to tangle in curls. Whimpering as the hands trailed down over his belly and up his inner thighs, teasing but not touching. Normally this was when he woke up, hard and ashamed of the thought of Sherlock finding out about his fantasies  but unable to stop himself. But this ending wasn't as clear. He vaguely remembered waking up but he couldn't quite-
“Oh I’m not using the secretary.  He’s already in police custody. Forgot about the CCTV you see and I know someone who has access to all the feeds so it was child's play in the end. Also, a tip for next time, at least get someone who won't run to their mother's house at the first sign of trouble. No, what I’m using is the destruction of a community centre in the heart of the town, several local politicians with an election to win, teenagers that can influence millions in less than 140 characters and the fact that you abandoned your entire family when your youngest son was 6.”
What they didn’t know was that the ‘fall-silent-upon-someone-loitering’ was planned to piss people off and the two people they were trying to listen to could be right little shits when they wanted to be.
“The peach,” Sherlock sighed, rolling his eyes, and the moment they caught each other’s eye they both broke out giggling.
He sighed.  “I know people in higher places,” Sherlock struggled with the phrasing, turning his head away.  With this he began to walk out of the office, “Don’t forget, any small detail could be important.  Use your
He bid Mike goodbye at the fork in the path, one way going to the halls, the other headed towards the Student Union building.  Well
John answered a few quick questions about the whereabouts of their captors and a few basic medical questions before Lestrade hustled them into the back of his car.
Here Sherlock would be surrounded by people he knew and, despite his protests, some he actually liked.  What if they didn't get a chance to talk? What if they did get a chance to talk? What if he already had a boyfriend?  What if he had to stand there and watch Sherlock dancing with his boyfriend and flirting with his boyfriend and kissing his stupid boyfriend who was bound to be gorgeous and smart and who he already hated?
dramatic?  Purple had always been tight but would that be a good thing?  What was the right choice?  There had to be one, he was just missing it, always too slow, always not quite right, always, always, always-
It had been nearly a week since they’d last talked, the longest they’d gone without speaking since they’d met.  Despite the fact they had only known each other a few weeks, the lack of his phone buzzing with a text alert was unnerving.  He still kept checking it, just in case he hadn’t felt it ring, to the point that Victor had started teasing him for it.  This was despite the fact that he was hyper aware of where his phone was at all times.
,” he said pointing a finger at Sherlock, “Better call me later.  We have much to discuss.”  Victor winked at Sherlock as he left.  Well there was the answer about dating blondes at least.  Less good on the across the hall front.
Trying to cut through the crowd was more difficult than it looked.  Clubs, and dance floors in particular, appeared to make people totally unaware of the space around them.  He thought back to yesterday as prime evidence, the person bumping into him completely oblivious to what they’d broken.  Luckily Sherlock was tall enough that he was easy to find but this also meant that John had a perfect view of him disappearing through the door without him, as he was stuck trying to navigate around an awkwardly placed high table.  He followed as quickly as he could, his senses settling themselves on high-alert.
time, he was told to walk the same beat he always did, look out for trouble, report anything suspicious, and for fuck’s sake John don’t do anything rash.  Bessy on the front desk raised her eyebrows for emphasis.  He could have laughed but merely saluted and swung back out the door.
“Well he’s always been a bit of a vigilante type has Jake.  Thinks he’s bloody Robin Hood,” Oli said, sounding bitter.  Sherlock glanced up.  Bitter about being left out rather than being shocked at crime element.  He’d have to tell Victor to get better friends.  He went back to his list.  Not many noticeable names but a few would certainly be big news.  His eyes hit the last name.
“Can we not?  Later, but not right now.”  John looked ready to insist so Sherlock leaned down so they were forehead to forehead and whispered, “Please?”
Molly looked around at the three other techs also in the lab.  Then she yelled “Guys I need to room!”  Sherlock was startled that everyone listened but Molly just shrugged.  “People are sort of scared of me.”
So Sherlock practically glided away, melting into the crowd as he went down the stairs.  It took a while to locate him again.
) and, while diving through the alleyways, he accidentally hurtled straight into someone else.  It was Victor.
They turned to look at each other.  "Brilliant," John said softly, smiling.  Sherlock's face lit up at the praise and John was helpless.
Sherlock agreed and they swapped numbers so Sherlock could text John the address.  John then glanced at his watch and winced.  “I’m really sorry but I’ve got to go otherwise I am never getting home.  See you tomorrow though, right?” as if Sherlock had decided in the last thirty seconds he’d changed his mind.
“I’m sorry but I must have forgotten my official Sherlock Holmes boyfriend ID card,” John said, pretending to rifle in his pockets.
However, when John tilted their heads and slipped his tongue into Sherlock’s mouth, he couldn’t really help it.  Before he could catch up and/ or cause a scene in the university quad, John pulled his head back.
you promise to discontinue this one man crusade to personally ruin your future.”  Jake looked ready to protest but Sherlock spoke over him.  “If you continue with this, once those people you blackmailed realise they are being coerced by a 19 year old, if they don’t know already, they will bring you to the ground and crush you as if you were an insignificant bug, which to them you are.  They already know where you used to live, it wouldn’t be difficult to find you again or to find your family.  Your social centre is doomed; even if you succeed in this endeavour, there will always be someone else willing to take their place and they are going to get harder and harder to push around.  A better use of your time would be finding some legal ground to prevent them from destroying it, which you would have thought of, had you not wasted your brain cells on watching action dramas and spy movies.  Now agree and give me a list of names.”  Sherlock finished imperiously, producing a pen from his pocket.  Jake looked between Oli and Victor and, upon finding them both glaring at him, sighed in defeat.
Sherlock groaned before ending on a whine as John left teasing touches on his thighs, brushing past but never actually touching him.
“Is this a bad time?”  Sherlock shot up so fast he nearly collided with the dog who had also leapt up at the sound of an intruder/potential best friend.
John pushed the hand back and grabbed the phone.  “Okay, let me actually see.  What am I looking at?”
“Ah so you, um, you enjoyed last night then?” Sherlock asked, stumbling over his words.  John couldn’t help but find him adorable.
Yep.  That would do it.  John let out a noise somewhere between a whimper and a groan, a noise that said
John was about to point out that an effective way of making photography his career would be simply to take photos and that a degree didn’t matter as much but as he looked into his mother’s earnest face, he realised that wasn’t quite her point.  She only wanted what was best for him and this could be a way of meeting her half way.  Also there was a small part of him that wanted to go back to a university setting.  He’d enjoyed the bit of social life he’d carved out and the routine of it and he wanted to prove that he could do it dammit.
Molly stared at him, concerned, but decided it wasn’t worth the fight.  “Fine.  Keep us posted okay?”
“I’m working,” Sherlock cut in, having turned his attention back to the arm.  He was currently prodding it with something, an action which John was certain Mr Russell was going to be pissed about.
His head dropped forward, chest heaving, before rolling his neck to stare at the ceiling.  The only thing he could focus on was trying to breathe normally, and then on the feeling of John’s hands stroking up and down his thighs.
“This morning.  In the shower.”  John had started moving down Sherlock’s chest, unbuttoning his shirt and pressing kisses to the skin that was uncovered.
As a precaution he also disconnected the doorbell and the TV and hid John’s phone.  Short-turn annoyance would be over-taken by long-term gain.  He hoped.
.”  Sherlock’s distain for repetition apparently flew out of the window when faced with the prospect of a date with John Watson.
Greg made a low, sympathetic sound.  “John, I’m sorry.  That, well, that sucks.  There’s no other, intelligent way to put it.”
“It’s a possibility,” Sherlock said, looking serious too, but with an edge of excitement which was missing from John and Lestrade.
And with his thoughts rambling down the lovely tangent that was his flatmate and current pillow, he fell asleep.
The sight of dark wool filled his vision, exactly the shade of Sherlock’s coat.  This was, unsurprisingly, because it
Lestrade looked like he wanted to berate Sherlock but instead simply said “Four.”  Maybe John would be able to talk him out of this madness.
“A favour Sherlock,” Molly said, swiveling to fully face him.  “You need a favour.  Generally people are quite nice to people they require favours from.”
In fact he was so dismissive of biology (unless it was relevant to a case however) that some joked he simply didn’t have one at all.
“Don’t you judge me,” he whispered and then shook his head.  Was he going hysterical?  Why?  It was just the dog walker, here to walk the dog.  Completely normal.  Should he have tidied up more?  No, John had been here before.  He’d probably seen it in a worse state.  Oh no, that can’t be good.  What did he think of Sherlock?  Did he think he was a responsible dog owner?  Did he like the flat?  Were the experiments too much?
John, sat on the other side of the desk, tried not to sigh.  “As in I’m moving into the spare room to help him cover the rent.”
There was the sign of a cap opening (when did he close his eyes again?) and then Sherlock was back, his large hand circling the both of them and yes, that was it, the added pressure he needed.  Sherlock stroked in time to their joint thrusts and he was on the edge and then Sherlock added a twist to his strokes and it felt so good.
“You alright?” John asked as they stepped over the road, where the paint was failing to attract much attention.  The people of London Above were about as jaded as those in the London Below.
After Sherlock had stormed off, he had gone back in to Mrs Lincoln’s and silently stewed while she meandered her way through several answers.  Lestrade kept on glancing at him, clearly desperate to ask what the hell was going on but bound to the procedures of the case.  When the questioning was over and they had walked down to the street, John cut him off before he started.
John didn’t even know where to begin.  What did Sherlock think it looked like?  Why was he blushing?  He was a detective and so investigating was in his nature.  Apart from there was something-
of people.  Not a horrendous night for when he was a newly-formed angel but not one John would rush towards.  Sherlock had spent the rest of the day tapping away on his laptop or phone and generally looking nonplussed about the entire event (after he’d had a good laugh at John’s expression of course).  John, in contrast to his usual habits, kept pacing and moving, unable to sit still.  If he was annoying Sherlock, it wasn’t mentioned.
“Yes,” and there it was again, that nervousness from when he’d opened the door. “That’s why I’m here.”
Lestrade appeared in the doorway.  “You okay?  I thought you were keen to arrest this guy, do some more gloating?”  As they were leaving, Sherlock taped out a response.
Raz just winked.  “Didn’t need to.  Right, I’ll see you later.  Or maybe not.  Just talk to the man for me won’t you.  Tell them I’ll be good as anything.”
“I believe you were just repeating the word John over and over again.  Flattering but you can see why I wasn’t enthralled.”
.  However, when his friend’s panicked voice spoke over the line, hurrying over a brief description which basically amounted to ‘John gone, need help’.  Then Sherlock had instructed him to look round Regent’s Park and promptly hung up with a quick thank you.  It was this thank you that had been the most worrying of all and was the thing that had Victor rolling out of bed and running over to the nearest bus stop.
“Yeah, well neither were you.”  Sherlock tilted his head to the left.  John debated something, opening and then closing his mouth before his expression cleared into a blank mask.
Sherlock strode straight up to them and without any preamble demanded “I need to see all footage from last night, from this shop as well as the surrounding area.  Immediately I need to see the safe things were taken from.”
“Yes dear.  There’s a group chat.”  She was still engrossed in the papers, apparently finding yesterdays newspaper in the pile.
“Oh good,” Sherlock said nodding as they both started laughing.  John ran his hand through Sherlock’s hair as they settled and lay for a few moments more.
“Yeah?” John said, shrugging off his jacket and walking forward to run his hands over Sherlock’s arms up to his shoulders.
He shuffled his way across the hallway, his head still pounding.  He could only think a few steps ahead.  This stupid errand first.  Then a nap which would hopefully clear up any other side-effects of the jump.  Then abuse Mycroft’s high security level to begin the pursuit of the truth.
It wasn't meant to be a habit.  One walk, just to satisfy his curiosity, just so he knew who he was trusting.  But it was soon obvious one walk wasn’t going to be enough.  John was so much more interesting than he'd anticipated and he couldn't leave it at just
“Yeah, yeah, army and all that, I know.  Just if you need anything, or anything looks suspicious, tell me alright?”  The investigation into the symbols appearing at crime scenes was still ongoing and Lestrade was growing desperate for a lead.
“Thought you’d solved the case and handed it over?”  Sherlock resolved to never share anything with Molly ever again.
"Because if this is about last night..." John began, thinking it was the most likely reason for Sherlock acting so...Not-Sherlock.
“Come on.  Do me.”  This was not the way Sherlock had hoped to hear those words, but the challenge proved too tempting.  Well, he was being given permission to look at John intently without it being odd, who could blame him?
"Pleasure to meet you Sherlock," Bill said, holding out his hand.  He looked like it was Christmas.  John was going to have to keep him as far away from Sherlock as physically possible, even if it meant sending Bill to NASA so they could put him on the moon.
“What?” Sherlock asked, distractedly, trying to look under the seat without touching anything.  It was a strange angle to be holding a conversation at.
“I’m getting your phone to ring…” and then Sherlock mumbled something that he supposed was close enough to Lestrade.  John added it to his mental list of “To Teach Sherlock” which included such wonders as ‘Not Leaving Feet Next To Food Even If They Are Synthetic’ and ‘Mrs Hudson Will Murder You If You Leave Chemical Burns On Her Kitchen Table’.  These thoughts stuttered to a halt when John swore Sherlock brushed his nose across the nape of his neck when he retreated with his phone.  He glanced up but the Fallen was staring at the phone, tapping out a message.  Just an accident then.
Sherlock did as he was told.  He clenched his hands into fists so they would stop shaking, gritted his teeth.  He thought of John as Lestrade counted down.
However, much to Sherlock’s surprise, John wasn’t upstairs either.  Which meant John wasn’t in the flat.  Which meant John was missing.
“Thought you wanted my hands,” John said, and Sherlock opened his eyes to see John watching his face as his hands coasted down his chest, his stomach, until they hit his cock.  Instead of stroking him however, John’s hands coasted to his inner thighs and over his hips.
“Oh really.  I had an entire plan set up, and you two nearly ruin it by cutting out of the club early.  That’s really not like you Sherlock, you were always such a stickler for a solution,” he said with a pout.
“Sherlock what? Oh, that,” he said, remembering the gash in his side.  It looked a lot worse than it actually was.  He had acquired it yesterday after one very angry burglar was not all too happy about being tackled to the ground and John had suffered for his second of distraction looking for the other guy who was taking off down the alley.  He’d caught them both in the end but even his healing abilities were struggling with this one.
"The ladder hasn't moved," he said suddenly and in his peripheral vision he could see Sherlock smile.
“Wouldn’t be the first time I skipped, plus it’s for a good cause,” Sherlock said, following John’s lead.
"Sherlock do you know- oh my god!"  A tall boy with scruffy bleach blonde hair had fallen through the door and was currently looking proud rather than mortified.  Irene stood close behind him and was still smirking.
He let Sherlock lead the way into one of the self-catered halls near campus and up to a door on the second floor.  A petite girl with stick-straight, vivid red hair, made even more bright by her pale complexion
“I will let it slide this time because I am an excellent person and you would do well to remember it because the next time I will stab you with a fork.  Now talk about your project,” Mike said, sitting down at a recently vacated table.
) and Sherlock insisted he learn some Chemistry as well.  His brain felt like it was 2 seconds away from exploding from the sheer volume of information stuck in there.
He was surprised to see Molly waiting outside for him.  She was not difficult to spot, her chunky, pink knit cardigan clashing with the sleek, white, Kensington town houses around her.
There also seemed to be a weight pressing down on him, pinning him to the bed.  What the hell had happened last night?
However, when he checked his pocket, he realised his phone was abandoned in their flat so he reasoned someone passing by would notice the strange message and would pass it on to the Guards.  Lestrade would get to them eventually and until then, it was up to him to prevent Sherlock from pushing his lack of self-preservation too far.
“There’s several questions still left to answer however.  First, how did they remain undetected when they got here?  I believe Mr Faber brings us that solution.”  Here he turned towards John.  “They’re taking on human’s appearances, invading their lives in order to be here.  Faber wasn’t driving our car at all, the Fallen was.”
John’s inner crisis was cut short by Sherlock’s abrupt, “Of course I want you to go.  Well, only if you want to of course,” he quickly added, remembering he was supposed to be acting casual, though he feared he may have broken that pretence.
He looked down at his hands, noting the scratches on his palms.  A small piece of glass was still stuck in one.  He circled it.  Probably against medical advice to pull it out.  However no one here was focusing on him so he pinched it between his thumb and forefinger.  It stung a little as he drew it out, the cut welling with black liquid.
The place was fairly busy so John didn't see him at first.  Afterwards he was quite grateful as he would have probably bolted if he was the first thing he saw.  Instead he took in the room with it's quirky wallpaper and battered-but-homely feel.  It was only with Mike repeatedly hitting his arm that he looked away from the skull on the mantel piece (they had been introduced one Friday, he was trying to work out if he should go say hello or if that was ultra weird) and saw Irene waving at them.  The person turned to look at them and John realised.  She was talking to Sherlock.
Because, once upon a time, his own results had also come through as ‘No results found’, until he’d gone through the long winded process of registering.
just put everyone in danger and may have ruined the reputation of John’s place of work.  Not a great start.
“Couldn’t.  Too stupid.”  Sherlock picked at the edges of the arm of the chair, tiny bits of the black leather ripping.
“How do you know that wasn’t my plan all along?” Sherlock said, now lolling against the wall, not making a move to leave but not trying to help again either.
He walked backwards, dragging Sherlock in by his coat and using it as leverage to press their lips back together into an open mouth kiss that turned filthy both way too quickly and not soon enough.  The door swung shut with a resounding slam as John backed up until his legs hit the bed.  His hands pretended to help Sherlock get rid of his coat when in fact they mostly got in the way before one lodged itself in Sherlock’s hair and the other ran up the front of his shirt.
He stood, shaking for a few minutes, trying to keep himself propped up against the wall.  His breath was coming in ragged gasps, as if he’d run all the way from Waterloo Bridge, and his legs were shaky underneath him.  His mind was gloriously blank but as his heart stopped thumping in his chest and he didn’t feel like he was going to collapse in a heap anymore, a strain of guilt ran through him.  He was not exactly sure whether it was a good or bad thing to be imagining your date begin to suck you off before you ever actually
He was right, Sherlock thought, he didn’t know if he could entirely believe him right now, but he wanted to, oh how he wanted to, and for now that was enough.  “If I had known you were trapped at my brother’s house I would have found a way to get to you sooner.”
It wasn’t that John would show just anyone.  As far as Sherlock was aware, he was one of only few to get to see them but once the book was open, it was fully open.
“Got lost?” John asked as Sherlock continued to peer at the tiny building marker that denoted where the Guard Officers were.
The body under him smelt lovely, musky and like sex.  Sherlock wanted to roll in it, to smell like it always and he was so tired his mind didn’t even bother telling him that could be considered weird.  Instead, it was strangely on board with this idea.  He dragged his eyes open and blinked against the light filtering into his room.  Forgot to shut the curtains.  Silly.  Too exhausted to move.  Do it later.
“I was invited,” Sherlock bristled.  John was fairly certain it was because he was relegated to ’the friend’ rather than the accusatory tone and tried not to be offended by this.
"Fancy some company?"  Both of them looked surprised.  Sherlock didn't know why he said that other than they had just started talking and he wanted to hear more.  He wanted to hear everything.  "The work I had to do fell through so I have time."  Well a small lie never hurt anyone.
“If they suspect anything they will burn the whole system. Do you really want to be starting from scratch?” he had asked Lestrade, who looked visibly ill from the thought.  Leads in cases were precious things and so they had set to work just shy of pinky promising not to say anything.
Sherlock, being Sherlock, waited for half a minute.  It was a show of intense restraint on his part.  Then he leapt from the room and appeared on the other side before John could even say “Please don’t.”
“I think he likes you.  We should meet up sometime, catch up properly.”  John agreed on autopilot and they exchanged phone numbers.  Stamford then made his way back to his office.  John had a lot of questions, namely:
Lestrade looked at him in exasperation.  “How many times have I told you about breaking into my office?  And yes, unfortunately for you, I am serious.”
“Ah.” Mycroft, momentarily, looked uncomfortable.  Mycroft had not looked uncomfortable for about three decades.  This was not good news.
“No, I was just going to say thanks for doing this.  Hope it wasn’t too horrific,” he laughed uneasily.
His eyes fluttered open with a soft gasp.  Sweat beaded on his forehead, hands clutched in the sheets, his erection persistent and heavy across his stomach.  He laid there, feeling his heart pounding in his chest, trying to get his bearings.  It was a dream.  It had just been a dream.  He was
century maiden.  Normally Sherlock would be averse to any suggestion he couldn’t look after himself, but if it meant he could have more contact with John he was not above pretending to faint and having John carry him.  He did not know when he had lost his dignity but apparently it was long gone by this point.
“Oh you’re no fun.”  That wasn’t John’s voice.  Higher pitch.  Light and breezy.  Irish?  A Fallen jumped up onto the platform and started forward, pausing just behind John.  “Hi!”
He spent a few moments trying to calm his breaths and closed his eyes. The memories that were hazy cleared in light of this new information and John finally understood what had happened last night.
“He’s down there, check the tread of his shoes and his sister’s address.  Statement tomorrow, got to go, bye,” he yelled at the confused DI.
“Ah.” Sherlock sounded a little put out.  “Wait!” he shouted for no reason and then lent forward to scramble at his shoes.  He lifted something up in triumph.  “Don’t worry, found it.”
Sherlock didn’t sound worried though.  “Ugh, not our problem right now.  Hang on, did he offer you money to spy on me?”
yours,” John said, despite the uneasy feeling he was about to be proved wrong.  Sherlock was the only person with black wings here
In this chapter we see a conflicted John, inappropriate giggling, figure out what the hell a consulting detective is, and there's a warning down the line...
Once again, he was ignored.  “I would advise you to stay away from Sherlock Holmes.  Also take Portland Street to work, it will take less time than Broadgate.”  And then the line cut off, leaving John confused, on edge, and with a nagging feeling that he should text Sherlock about what just happened.  However, Portland
Something lodged in John’s throat as Sherlock sat carefully and faced the Fallen.  His nerves screamed
He scoffed, leaning his head against the window.  “Molly, your own romantic entanglements appear to be clouding your judgement.”
“Yep,” Sherlock replied, his peripheral vision locked onto a pretty brunette already eyeing up John from across the foyer.
Once again, John stated to himself that he did not believe in an angelic sixth sense.  The fact that he decided to double-check the alley was just him doing his job properly.  This meant the fact that there happened to be a symbol a few feet into the corridor, in bright yellow paint no less, was simply good luck.  It appeared fairly fresh, not being overlapped by any new tags or with the usual grime, A4 in size.  Small enough to be innocuous, someone’s identifying tag, unless you knew what you were looking for.
“Hello Angelo,” Sherlock said, cutting off a hug by throwing his hand out for a handshake instead.  Angelo’s grip was crushing because of his excitement and he was bouncing around like a puppy.  It was slightly embarrassing but also bolstering: it was strange but nice for people to be rooting for them so much already.
They talk for a while, about the party, about classes, about the people around them.  Kate introduced him to Mark who lived next door to her and John reluctantly agreed that perhaps he was being overly anxious about this socialising lark and was, however reluctantly, having a good time.
John doubted he would have found the door Sherlock was aiming for without help.  It blended into the wall perfectly.  Clearly Sherlock had not been kidding about messing with his brother’s spies.  He didn’t know whether to be proud or concerned.
“My, my what?” Sherlock looked vaguely scandalised.  Shit had they been keeping it a secret?  Well, too late to back down now.
“Would you like me to go?” John sounded utterly casual.  What Sherlock could not hear however was John’s internal debate about whether Sherlock actually did want him to go or was just asking out of politeness?  What if Sherlock was embarrassed by him?  John knew, in the abstract, that he wasn’t
“How did you know I did photography?” John said, looking at Mike who continued to smile but shook his head in denial.  Sherlock ducked his head.
The usual feeling of feather and bone was curiously absent.  He experimentally tried to move them but there was nothing.  Not a pain or a numbness but a nothing.
), they had set up a date for a week’s time.  Since then they’d managed to bump into each other more in one week than they had in 7 months living across the hall from each other.  Hallways, coffee shops, the campus library, shopping in Tesco: if two people could be in the same shared common space at the same time, they would both be there.  Once John’s crush had been shoved into a box in the back of his mind, he couldn’t believe how easy it was to talk to Sherlock.  Sure, conversations about blood splatter patterns and a disappearing, gold-stealing cockatoo were not what most people would call ‘polite conversation’ but it was interesting and refreshing to not have an awkward ‘getting-to-know-you’ phase.
John cough to stifle a laugh at the word ‘beau’ while Sherlock rolled his eyes.  “Yes, I’m very grateful you didn’t turf him out into the street.  So generous of you to keep quiet about it and just assume I would come and find him.”
“What do you want Sherlock?  I’m busy,” he said, gesturing to the laptop and grateful that for once he had left open the word document and not Facebook.  For some reason this made Sherlock look uneasy.
“What are you doing exactly?” Sherlock narrowed his eyes.  He’d heard the name before but was having trouble placing it.
“Sherlock, you okay?” Victor’s voice sounded concerned but Sherlock couldn’t turn to look at him.  All he could see was that name written in Jake’s neat print.
“John.”  He jumped as Sherlock appeared at his shoulder, dropping from the air.  A phone was shoved in his face.  “John,
"No," Sherlock said slowly, as if he were talking to an incredibly stupid person which did nothing to alleviate Johns mood, "We're talking about last night, I was admitting I had no issue forgetting about it and then you started talking about your feelings which I had assumed but it appears my assumptions may be incorrect."
“Sounds great.  Oh and if you’re looking for something other to do than being chased down alleyways, there’s a party on Saturday, supposedly
John was screwed from the moment he saw him.  The worst thing was that he was fully aware of how screwed he was and did absolutely nothing to stop it.  Even more cliché was the fact he saw him in a damn coffee shop of all places.
As for their flat, it was no Baker Street and Sherlock was already mentally plotting how to get them onto Baker Street once more, but it was functional and warm and most importantly, had John in it.
casually, trying to eavesdrop, only to find that both were sat in silence, practically ignoring each other.
“Yeah, yeah it is,” and Sherlock had to try so hard not to shiver at John’s soft voice in his ear, “It’s alright.  I’m fine seriously.”  John paused for a second.  “Who knew you were a total softie,” he added, laughing as he untangled himself and playfully pushed at Sherlock’s shoulder.
He finished up his current experiment, carefully ensured none of the mess on the table was likely to either be uncontrollably toxic or explode (
The doorbell rang.  “You going to be okay for a bit?” she asked, obviously trying to be caring and not condescending.  Maybe she did like him and he was being paranoid.  It wouldn’t be the first time.
“So demanding,” Sherlock smiled and ducked his head to press a kiss to John’s lips.  “Hello John,” he whispered against his lip, drawing his head back but keeping John in a hug.
“Hey.  Yeah, no worries.  Sorry.  I was just going to say something’s come up, so I’ve got to cancel on our plans.  Sorry it’s late notice but-” he gestured towards his door and backed away towards it.
Because this was it.  Once he handed over the paper, he would be able to find his own answers.  He’d never been afraid of a question before.
Sherlock loved data. It was the one fuel John knew he could use to instigate action in him, even if it resorted to him yelling about people passing by the streets below their humble flat, scouring the newspaper for strange stories, or allowing there to be nine varieties of body part in the fridge.
