"Yes, I’ve known him since he came into the scene. He was very naive- I felt it necessary to help him acclimate. It was obvious that he had nowhere else to go, so he needed a helping hand. It’s not a very safe world for the very young, especially when they look like he did. Most people are not predators but the few that are can be rather persistent.”
“You’re welcome,” Irene called after their retreating figures. “And you’ve got a tab with both bars. Tip your bartenders.”
“What changed? Oh, don’t start, my deductive reasoning is solid here. I’m assuming something out of the ordinary happened, and that’s why they’ve finally contacted you.”
With this last statement, Sherlock’s face had become unreadable. But John was learning that the detective used emotional distance as armor and that his words belied a vulnerability that ran right through to his core. John stood up taller and looked directly into Sherlock’s warily guarded eyes.
Drusilla started giggling, though her eyes remained cold and piercing, boring into Sherlock with a greedy stare that made John’s blood run cold. She twirled around with delight several times, then took Sherlock and John each by the hand, leading them toward the exit. John still wasn’t entirely sure what exactly he was supposed to be doing in this charade but decided that he should just keep following Sherlock, who was effortlessly maintaining his glamoured affectation and following Drusilla like a love-struck puppy. John was looking forward to the fact that half of the Yard was waiting outside to back them up, but as soon as they got out of the door Drusilla yanked them into an alley and began pulling them almost inhumanly quickly down the narrow twists and turns of the London streets. John quickly lost hope that anyone would be able to keep up, or even find them. John could barely keep up with her himself, and only could because her grip on them was so strong that he had no choice but to strain his legs as far as he could while desperately trying not to trip and fall. John was almost certain that he was going to asphyxiate by the time she pulled them into one last alley, deep in a desolate area of town that he was unfamiliar with, when she finally stopped and released them, tossing them with an impressive amount of force against a wall. She spun around and hissed at them.
“What am I missing, Sherlock? Please tell me how there’s a rational explanation for what we saw. Please,” he was practically begging for some return to normalcy.
“He is- was so pretty.  I bet he was really popular,” Molly added dreamily.  “Oh, Sherlock, maybe you-”
Sherlock sighed. “I know you believe that if I had it, I would use my powers for good. That I would be an avenging angel, a hero. But I never wanted it for altruistic purposes, John. I believed I was a monster, and I thought I deserved an eternity of hell. Being an atheist, eternity in this world was the closest I could imagine to it.”
Tears were threatening to form in John’s eyes. Those were the words he didn’t know he needed to hear. Still, he needed to be practical. Greater good and all.
John wondered when Sherlock had the time to acquire this information and quickly realized Sherlock must have been out while he was sleeping. The thought of Sherlock cruising the clubs aroused the first spark of the jealousy that Sherlock had asked for him to show.
“I’m not certain yet of how exactly they are accomplishing this, but trust me. There are two of them. One is an angry male, who identifies strongly as anti-authoritarian and thinks very highly of himself. The other is a woman who is actually the clever one of the two, although she suffers frequent mental breaks that render her child-like. He likes to take care of her. He likes to indulge her whims. Right now, they’re playing a game. They’re taking turns, to be fair. As the last ‘scene’ was his, it is her turn tonight, which is why we are here at Cities in Dust. Many of the victims frequented this club, and may have been chosen from here. The suspects will be hard to distinguish from the crowd, though I’m certain Irene will have a narrow list of suspects- she is quite observant.  At a club like this, among the many regulars there are also gawkers and posers- those are people pretending to be in the ‘scene’, John-”
Sherlock considered before answering, “There was a time when this was a place of refuge for me. These people here deserve the same place of peace.”
The next several hours were a veritable circus of the comings and goings of Scotland Yard’s crime scene investigators. It looked like the two killers had been holed up here for some time, and John imagined that they’d probably be really irritable now that their home had been discovered and dismantled into hundreds of tiny evidence bags. He glanced over at the pile of dolls nearest to him and shivered as he noticed details that he hadn’t before. He’d already noted that they all bore the signs of Drusilla’s rage. Some were missing their heads. Some had been gutted. Most of them were covered in blood. But what John found really eerie was that they all bore resemblance to the victims, though he hadn’t put that together until he saw a uniformed woman holding a dark-haired male doll wearing a trench coat.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
John closed his eyes and took a deep breath, the reality of the situation finally hitting him. He was at a goth club, where everyone is supposed to believe them to be a couple. They were about to dance. He was about to dance with a very, very sexily dressed Sherlock Holmes, the man who had been front and center of all of his fantasies for the last two years. And they were here hunting serial killers, which to Sherlock was probably the closest thing to foreplay that he could imagine. And Sherlock was flirting with him. [Well, fuck it. It might all be a ruse for the case, but I may as well enjoy it while I can.] John stood up a bit straighter and looked Sherlock in the eye. He finally snaked his arm around Sherlock’s corseted waist, returning Sherlock's embrace. He shivered a little as he brushed the corset laces, thrilled that he had permission to touch Sherlock this way.
They broke apart reluctantly, though neither seemed willing to forsake contact altogether. They grazed fingertips as they headed into the nightclub. As usual, Sherlock seemed to posses the sort of A-list magic that allowed them to bypass the queue. As they passed the crowds of people waiting their turn to enter, John was relieved to recognize several Yarders.
As she scanned the eager dancers, looking pensive, she gasped and pointed to a shadowy figure. “Oh, Spike, look. There’s Daddy. Hello, Daddy. Do you like my dollies? They’re a bit wiggly right now but I’ll put them right soon.”
“Sure, love. But we should really hurry up and choose, yeah? Do you want any more dollies tonight?” He waved idly at the crowd of people who were still clamoring to catch their attention. “I’m a mite peckish tonight, could do with a few courses.” John realized that this cocky bloke didn’t even seem to mind that they were standing right there, could hear them perfectly, and that no one else seemed bothered by his comments.
“Only two more now, John. Only two more and then you get to put this- Sherlock ran the riding crop along the length of his dripping cock- down your throat. Can you take it, John? Do you think you’ll be able to take all of me?” Sherlock flicked the whip down on one of the few remaining areas where he hadn’t yet struck.
Drusilla, though. She seemed to have transformed completely from their previous meeting. Last time she’d had something of a childlike demeanor beneath her sensuality and power, but tonight she emanated nothing but pure purpose and rage. She strode inhumanly lithely toward John and Sherlock, reaching them within moments of their noticing her arrival. Spike followed her, remaining just a step behind a bit subserviently, but taunting them as soon as they were within hearing range.
This was most certainly not a situation he’d ever expected to be in. Although they had pretty much both admitted that they wanted to jump each other, John hadn’t even had time to hope that they’d be able to negotiate this sort of thing into their- whatever the hell was going on. Apparently he was taking too long to turn over though, because the next thing he knew Sherlock brought the crop down sharply on his hip, exactly where he’d been describing John rubbing it. It didn’t feel nearly as nice as John had hoped it would, either.
John awoke violently, still feeling the aftershocks of his orgasm. He wasn’t sure if he’d been actually vocalizing, but his sore throat led him to believe that he had. Sweating and feeling filthy in more ways than one, he grasped desperately at the last tendrils of his dream. He wanted to just go back and finish dream Sherlock off, and to have time to decompress from the most intense session of his life. The mind-shattering orgasm he’d just had left him feeling completely discombobulated. Even if it hadn’t been real, the emotions he was feeling as a result of what he just experienced definitely were.  As he calmed down and got his heart rate and breathing back into normal parameters he realized that there were raised voices coming from downstairs and prayed they hadn't heard him. He’d hoped for more time to process, but since they had company he decided despondently that he wasn’t going to get the time he needed to fully recover.  He listened for clues as to what he was going to walk into when he finally made it downstairs. The lack of real anger in Sherlock’s raised voice told John that it wasn’t Mycroft who was the recipient of his scorn. Probably Lestrade, then. Mustering the willpower to get up and go see what was happening, he groaned as he pulled the covers back, seeing the extent of the mess he’d made. A shower first, then.
John pushed himself over and groaned as his now aching erection pressed between the mattress and his stomach. Before he could adjust it and maybe give it a little tug or two to take the edge off, Sherlock brought the riding crop down on his newly exposed arse cheek, though not as hard this time.
John expected a snide remark, but instead Sherlock put his arms around him and pulled him closely into an embrace. He leaned his head onto John’s and spoke into his hair. “We’ll be careful. I promise.”
“Alright-" Lestrade looked skeptical that Sherlock might derive help from anything he had to recount, but he continued anyway. "It’s a right gruesome one. There’ve been four staged crime scenes so far, each containing multiple victims. Cause of death was exsanguination. All of the victims have puncture wounds on the neck imitating vampire bites. The pathologist determined that these were, in fact, the wound they bled out from. Since there was no blood at the scenes we assume they were killed elsewhere and moved. There have been two different sorts of staged ‘scenes’. One type involved victims who were apparently culled from some of the goth clubs around town. These were the first and third scenes that we found. The victims were all well known in their circles as Victorian Goths, or Romantigoths, all frill and lace like. They’re posed as though they’re at a tea party in a doll’s house. Some of ‘em are still propped up around a table with dead flowers and tea cups filled with blood. Others looked like they’ve been tossed about, like dollies that someone got tired of. It’s a little unnerving how much it reminds me of my what my daughter’s playhouse looks like after she’s had a strop, actually, but with real bodies. Creepy. We can’t make heads nor tails of it. Anyway, the other type of scene is, um… well, for lack of a better term,  juvenile.”
“Serial killers,” Sherlock moaned, looking absolutely wrecked, and John thought fuzzily that nothing had ever sounded so seductive. Coming back to himself, John preened a bit at the fact that he could have such an effect on his normally unaffected friend simply by making out at a bar. He gave one last longing look at Sherlock’s mouth, forcing himself to focus on what it was saying. “I appreciate your- enthusiasm, John. But unfortunately we’ll have to save whatever you were planning for after we’ve finished this,” he said, eyes still a bit glazed.
“JOHN, I REQUIRE-” Abruptly, Sherlock ceased his petulant tantrum and stared at John. “Oh. You find me attractive in this outfit. Good, it will help you to be more convincing in your role as my secret lover. Now please hurry up and work through your crisis of identity and help me with this lacing.”
“Alright then, Dru, what are we hanging around here for? Let’s get these pretty new dollies of yours back to the lair.” Spike chomped his teeth at Drusilla as punctuation. John tried hard not to laugh at the overdramatic use of the word “lair.”
John took a few deep breaths. “You did tell me to act possessive,” he laughed, studying his handiwork.
Currently, John was sitting in his favorite chair. His tea was forgotten and cold next to him, and he was shaking his head and cursing under his breath angrily at the daily Times. Sherlock was sitting across from John, fidgeting and glaring at the paper as though it had personally offended him. Since Sherlock so often insisted that he had no time for politics and left John to his mutterings, John deduced that the object of his frustration was likely himself and not the contents of the paper. He did his best to give no indication that he noticed Sherlock's distress while he finished the article that he was reading about Margaret Thatcher’s new public policies.  John’s time serving in the Falklands had given him good reason to be tetchy with the prime minister, and he often muttered at the paper, but his typical stoicism only gave way to his real opinions after a few pints at the pub. Anyone who drank with him could predict that after his fourth lager he’d be sure to brandish his favorite Borges quote about the war being like two bald men fighting over a comb. Though he was pretty sure that whatever Sherlock had to say would probably be preferable to the tripe he was reading right now, he was intent on refusing to give in to Sherlock’s churlishness.  He let his mind wander from the paper and started thinking about his flatmate.  John knew that Sherlock's alleged indifference to politics was a ruse, and that Sherlock agreed completely with John on the PM. Sherlock cared deeply for the network of homeless people whom he’d amassed to help him solve his crimes, and John knew that it bothered him immensely that Thatcher’s policies were killing them. Sherlock paid his network lavishly to act as spies. John had also found Sherlock helping many people in accessing medical care (now easier with John’s help), or even entering university. As such, he had a large and loyal following on the streets of London. But their numbers were growing, and despite Mycroft’s lofty insistence otherwise, everyone knew that it was Margaret Thatcher’s fault. Mycroft had tried to enlist their help in tracking down the organizers of last year’s assassination attempt. Sherlock had looked him and Mags in the eye and stated calmly that he would do it only to help the assassins complete the job next time, and to thereafter never be found. Mycroft had since stopped bothering Sherlock with government requests.
John burst out laughing. He’d never heard Sherlock stuck on one word before. Now he knew Sherlock was distracted. Also, he was developing a theory that Sherlock had been hiding a deeply sensual nature. For instance, if John were to, say, use Sherlock’s own methods of deduction, he might notice that those leather trousers looked worn and fit extremely well. One might argue that Sherlock had worn them before. Perhaps a lot. Oh, he was going to have fun testing this new hypothesis.
John was busy struggling to push away rather explicit thoughts of what ‘later’ implied when he felt his attention hijacked. A man and a woman had entered the bar with a presence that immediately commanded everyone’s attention. He was handsome- Irene had been right about that. But he emanated a sort of smug superiority in his black jeans, floor-length leather duster, and his condescending sneer that John thought was a little bit overblown. The woman, though- she was unlike anyone John had ever seen before. She was small and looked quite fragile. She wore a dress that looked like it was a nightgown from the last century, its high lace collar and long sleeves belying a conservatism that was contradicted by the sheerness of the shift. John resolved not to try to deduce if she wore anything beneath. Her long, dark, unruly hair was loosely braided with dark blue ribbons. She seemed like she existed separate from time- from modernity. Her large, dark eyes were somehow both ageless and innocent as she scanned the denizens of the club. She spun and twirled and practically floated onto the other side of the dance floor. But although she was attracting the attention of everyone in the bar, and enjoying the attention, she was obviously dancing for an audience of one. Her partner followed her onto the dance floor, never taking his eyes off of her.
John’s resolve faltered once they entered the first room. He had truly thought he was ready- he had, in fact, been to a drag bar or two. But this was unlike any place he’d ever seen. It was enormous, and completely packed with men in various states of dress and undress. Some were in full drag and other, incredibly youthful looking men were only dressed in gold bathing thongs. John eventually registered that the latter were waiters handing out trays of colorful shots to whomever was willing to put a tenner in their pants. A performer was on stage doing a bawdy rendition of It’s Raining Men, and this number seemed to be a full participation event. Yet even amid the shouting, singing, and writhing men around them, their entrance created a stir. He wasn’t sure if it was because of their fame in the papers, or because of Sherlock’s past here, but they were definitely noticed. A few people were practically salivating at Sherlock’s arse as he walked by, and John bit down his feelings of jealousy as he noticed Sherlock nodding a bit too familiarly back at a few of them. Men surrounded John too, and they were grabbing at his dog tags, belt, and anything else they could reasonably lay their hands on, trying to draw him into the fray. He’d never been the recipient of such unabashed groping by strangers, and through the haze of his indignation and shame he couldn’t help but wonder if this is how women felt all of the time. He found himself wishing desperately that they had never left 221B, their armchairs by the quietly crackling fireplace, and his cozy and conservative jumpers. He was trying to figure out how the character he was supposed to be playing would respond to being treated like a piece of meat- should he act like this was natural, fine even?- when Sherlock once again came to the rescue. Of course he had noticed John’s discomfort- likely when John had unconsciously released his waist and stood staring like a terrified hare surrounded by foxen- and he took swift charge of the situation. Sherlock took John’s hand and began pulling him toward another door in the back of the room with determination. He leaned close to John to be heard over the din, and John felt his warm breath brush over his neck as Sherlock told him, “You don’t have to pretend to be altogether comfortable with this, John. Remember, you’re not supposed to have much exposure in this environment, and it is definitely not something that everyone would be comfortable with. For most people, entrance to this club is automatically considered consent, but it probably shouldn’t be. We’re headed to the other room where it will be much more sedate.” He pulled John closer and began to glare at anyone who came near them, for all appearances looking the jealous lover. For once John found himself grateful instead of resentful for Sherlock’s sharp intuition as to his state of mind, and of their assumed relationship, and they fought their way through the rest of the club to the door beyond.
Sherlock shifted so that he could reach John’s lips, kissing him deeply before saying, “No, John. I seem to have recently found my humanity, and I’m not ready to lose it, even for all of the time in the world.”
They were climbing a set of stairs as they spoke, a strange in-between world where stragglers lurked smoking, and the music from the different floors melded into an unintelligible din. Sherlock stopped and asked a girl with foot-long green spikes spouting in every direction from her head for a cigarette, ignoring John’s dirty look. “Ta,” he said as she handed him one with a look of practiced disdain. They climbed up to the next landing, and before John could bring up the issue of Sherlock’s smoking habit, he uncoiled a scrap of paper from around the cigarette. “Homeless network,” he muttered, scanning the unfurled note.
“Oh John, you are EVER so good. And we’re so close, now. So close to earning my cock in your mouth. I was going to make you kneel, but I think I’d much rather see you sitting on my marks while you have that gorgeous mouth around me. Yes, I think I’d like you to be feeling me here-” he slapped the crop down perpendicular across his other lashings- “while you also feel me here.” He turned the crop around and nudged the handle into John’s eager mouth.
“Sure, if you say so. They were given makeovers and then positioned in some rather boringly subversive poses- flipping the bird, making devils’ horns, tongues out, and the like. Both of these times the victims were staged in front of the BBC building. If this doesn’t work out tonight we’ll at least we’ll know where to look for the next batch, I guess. We connect them to the other crime scenes because they were also exsanguinated, puncture wounds on the neck. Anyway, we can’t figure out if this is two separate groups, or cults, or whatever…”
“Oh, sit down. We both know that you’re not going anywhere. But you are correct. Lestrade finally allowed someone who wasn't Anderson to examine the bodies and they pointed out the undeniable forensic similarity of the wounds found on several of the victims that they had previously declared unrelated. He has, as such, suddenly found himself unable to disregard my ‘suggestions’ that perhaps we had a serial killer, or killers more likely, on the loose in London.”
“Indeed.” Sherlock scanned the room. “We should dance. Although we’re doing a fair job of attracting attention as we are, we’ll be more exposed if we’re on the dance floor, and I want to be able to have the advantage of as many pairs of eyes on us as possible.”
anyway, i'll post up the next chapter soon, i'm on a roll now and don't want to leave this hanging forever. the thought of it looming is eating away at my ability to work on other projects without guilt lol
“John. You know me. I care little for the emotions of others. I manipulate people into acting in my own selfish interests. I act without conscience or care for consequence. I may not be doing it for the acquisition of drugs or sex any longer, but what is the difference if I’m doing it for the acquisition of truth?”
“So you won’t be needing the fag, then?” Just because they dressed in bondage gear and went out clubbing now didn’t mean John was going to let Sherlock think he could smoke too.
And then he lost his focus, and in fact, all sense of reason as Spike and Drusilla’s faces distorted into something that John’s mind had no reference for outside of half-remembered Sunday School images of demons. Their foreheads elongated and warped into grotesque ridges. Their eyes burned with glowing yellow fire. But most disturbingly, it looked like their teeth were growing into actual fangs! Sparing a moment to wonder if they’d been drugged, his typical steadfast demeanor and preparedness failed him and he fumbled backward and fell over his own feet onto the floor. There was no way he could have prepared himself for this. A rational part of his brain was trying to get his attention, insisting that this was likely some sort of fantastic special effects and that there was no way this was really happening, but it was silenced immediately when the creatures seemed to blink out of existence and reappeared directly behind Sherlock. John tore his eyes away from the monsters, looking to Sherlock in hopes of finding some sort of rational explanation, some hope, but instead saw him simply close his eyes serenely, tipping his neck as though inviting Drusilla’s impending bite.
Basking in his rapt attention, she twirled around a few times, singing to herself and laughing with the sort of manic joy that only small children and the highly medicated are capable of. Spike leered at Sherlock as he and Drusilla slowly closed in on the detective. John took a tentative step backward, then another, trying to avoid notice. He stilled his breath, tensing his muscles and preparing to pull his gun and shoot them at the first signal from Sherlock, but when he realized that it seemed Sherlock was actually going along with this madness he decided that he was going to have to take matters into his own hands, despite near-certain recrimination from Sherlock later about foiling his plans. Banking on the fact that on occasion Sherlock admitted that he needed John to save him from his own arrogance and stupidity, John made the executive decision that this was one of those times. Who cares if they found out exactly how these monsters did it? They had basically had the killers caught red-handed and what they had was enough to justify acting in self-defense. John focused firmly on the expanding wave of calm that was filling his center, his anchor of stillness that prepared him for instant and decisive action.
“I mean it. If we’re going to do this thing, no more secrets. No more running off into danger alone. It’s both of us together, or not at all.”
By this point, John was nearly drowning in sensation and nearly forgot that he was supposed to answer. He felt Sherlock lift the crop, ready to strike.
“You do tonight, John. Just follow my lead. One of the nicer things about these clubs is that there is no wrong way to dance. You just listen to the music and move your body however it feels right.”
“I-I’m John,” he blurted. [Oh, smooth, John. Real smooth.] Sherlock smirked down at him knowingly. [Oh great, and that git’s enjoying the hell out of this too, likely.]
“One day, Dru, I’ll do just that. Just for you. But we’re not going to kill him tonight, so let’s GO.” He tugged at the woman’s arm. “Until next time, gents,” he called over his shoulder as they pushed their way through the crowd.
“And I'll tell you this as many times as it takes for you to hear me. Trust me, Sherlock. I know you, more than anyone. I know your beauty. Your kindness. Your generosity. Your passion. You pretend that you’re all logic and reason, Sherlock, but I see your heart and I can’t imagine how I could help but love it.”
“Probably not,” Lestrade agreed. “Well, it seems he was pretty well-known in the club scene in recent years. He’s got a couple of minor infractions, all in or near the clubs.”
“Thanks, asshole. So, John, the second and fourth scenes we found were made up from people dressed more like punks than goths, though near as we can tell they’ve no history in any subculture. Background checks show they’re all yuppies who’ve been dressed up like punks, altered pre- or post- mortem…”
Sherlock flashed a him a predatory grin before continuing. “As I was saying, there is a certain… decorum in a club like Cities in Dust. Because there is an unstated understanding of discretion, people feel liberated to dress and behave in ways that are a bit… unorthodox. There will people in varying states of undress. Please restrain your libido enough not to ogle.”
Indeed, that was a good word for what John was seeing- everyone looked spellbound. Sherlock was doing a good impersonation of it too, and John realized that Sherlock must be aware of how much the woman’s partner was scrutinizing him. In fact, the blond man was completely fixated on Sherlock, and he seemed to be practically herding him closer and closer toward the woman. As the song came to a climax, Sherlock, the blond man, and the woman had formed a beautiful trio in the center of a whirlpool of writhing bodies. The song ended abruptly, and the spell was broken. The DJ switched to a slower song, and many of the dancers wandered off the floor entirely, looking more than a little disoriented, although a few stragglers milled around trying to get the woman's attention. John decided this was probably a good time to rejoin Sherlock, as the two suspects were now leering at him rather lasciviously. He walked up as the woman was leaning into Sherlock, standing on her tip toes to whisper something in his ear, her hand entangled in the laces of his shirt. John caught Sherlock’s eye and with that uncanny communication they sometimes had, John could tell that Sherlock was barely tolerating her touch. He jumped into action. Wondering briefly what kind of signal Sherlock had worked out with the yard, he hitched himself up a bit higher, put out his chest, and walked purposefully over to the group. He wrapped his arm around Sherlock’s waist, pulling him closer possessively. The woman hissed in frustration, and with excruciating slowness, turned to acknowledge John’s arrival.
“Well, then show me how good you can be. Count.” Before he even finished the last word, he brought the riding crop sharply down across John’s entire arse, just over the crease where his glutes met his thighs.
Although he knew that Sherlock’s time in his mind palace was somewhat restorative, it was no substitute for actual sleep. As he stood there worrying about whether Sherlock would be refreshed enough to tackle what was sure to be another long night trying to apprehend Drusilla and Spike, Sherlock, without opening his eyes, seemed to read John’s mind and roused himself enough to say, “We will finish it tonight. And yes, I’ll take some new tea.” John’s nerves were nearly completely frayed from the stress of the last few days and the lack of sleep. A cold and demanding Sherlock was just about to enough to make him finally snap when the lounging detective opened his eyes and looked over at John, giving a shy, sheepish smile which caused his irritations to somehow magically melt away.
Still, John was having a difficult time ignoring Sherlock’s silent demands for his attention. He was practically vibrating with the effort of waiting as patiently as he could (though his patience was on par with a toddler on cocaine) for John to notice that he had something important to say. John finally sighed and put down his paper, giving in to his curiosity- though he was tempted to let Sherlock suffer a bit longer in retribution for last night’s chemistry fiasco that had ruined the lovely takeaway he’d been dreaming of during most of that day’s clinic duty.
Not breaking his intense eye contact, Sherlock went on. “This club is a venue that entertains two types of clientele. The back room is the goth club, where our killers will be hunting their next victims, if I am correct. Which of course, I am. However, we will have to enter through the front room, which is a performance area dedicated for men who dress up as women to perform musical numbers. Please do not stare or appear shocked. It must seem that you are at least somewhat comfortable with this world.”
John turned an entirely new shade of red, desperately trying to push back the onslaught of images from his dream that had resurfaced at Sherlock’s description. Thankfully, the kettle whistled and he had a reason to turn away from the ever-observant detective, who was still staring through him. He glanced down at the copy of the Times lying on the counter and instantly a cold rage replaced whatever undefinable thing he’d been feeling just a moment ago.
“Oi, this tiny mind has to save your life when you muck up, running into situations without a plan. Try not to piss it off, yeah?”
“Right, where he goes, I go,” John added, really not finding it much of a stretch to play the jealous lover.
“And you’re doing a fantastic job. Brilliant, in fact. However, we need to be able to focus on the task at hand, and I find that I’m having a difficult time with that while you are grinding this-” he ran his hand lightly over John’s straining prick- “into my leg.”
The cab arrived at Kali before John had a chance to press the issue. Sherlock manifested some bills from a mysterious hidden location and tossed them at the driver. They climbed out onto the kerb. “Into the fray, John,” Sherlock said as he handed the leash over.
“You know it is the only way. John, you can stop lurking outside of the kitchen and come join us any time.”
“Really, though?” John wasn’t sure why he was pressing the issue so strongly. It wasn’t like he wanted Sherlock to become a blood-sucking monster. But he needed to understand. Needed to know that when they went after the vampires tomorrow night that Sherlock wouldn’t give himself over to them. He wasn’t sure if he would be able to let him go, especially now.
With the last line, Sherlock’s eyes locked fiercely onto John. Oh. There was no doubt that this was the real Sherlock communicating with him, and Sherlock wanted him. Sherlock… WANTED him. Well. John certainly wasn’t going to lose his chance by responding with mixed signals. He met Sherlock’s gaze and let everything he’d been repressing all these long months blaze through.  As the song progressed, they moved closer and closer, flirting with light touches, maintaining their heated eye contact.  Sherlock spun closer to John, and just as John was sure that Sherlock was finally going to kiss him, he danced instead around and wrapped his arms around John from behind. Still moving to the music, Sherlock nuzzled into John’s neck, saying, “People are filtering in now, John. I’m sure you’ve noted the location of all of the exits.” John had not, in fact, noticed anything but Sherlock, who was currently running his hand up John’s chest. “Watch carefully for the couple that Irene described. They’ll be deliberately attracting attention, it will be difficult to miss them.” John was pretty sure he wouldn’t notice the entire British Army if they marched into this club if Sherlock kept touching him. Sherlock must have been able to read his thoughts again because he huffed a frustrated sigh into John’s neck and pulled away. Some of the blood found its way back to John’s brain. He shook his head a little to clear it, pushing down the feeling of utter loss at the lack of physical contact he’d been able to enjoy so fleetingly. Sherlock danced back around in front of John and gave him a meaningful look. Later, his eyes seemed to promise. Oh yes, later.
“One.” It hurt more than John expected, but his arousal was almost unbearable anyway and he was glad for something to distract him. He wasn't sure he'd last very long in the state he was in.
The cab ride back was silent, and John wasn’t sure how to reach out to Sherlock, or if the detective even wanted him to. It was obvious to John that Sherlock had been shaken by the encounter with Drusilla and Spike, and while he could try and play it off as his typical surliness at being stumped by a case, John had been there and seen Sherlock ready to give up his life to the killers. He wasn’t completely certain that Sherlock actually believed that they were vampires, but either way it was breaking John’s heart that Sherlock would be so willing to throw away everything they had—or could have, if they’d ever get a chance—so easily. Sensing John’s unease, Sherlock reached over and gently took his hand, but continued staring out the window at the rising sun.
“We dance, John. We dance and observe. Look for anyone who seems to be drawing people to them, attracting followers. Anything that sounds your intuitive alarms.”
“Aye, he’s told you, has he? I want you to know that I was also against him helping with this case, John. But he convinced me he’s been clean long enough that he shouldn’t be tempted, so I reluctantly agreed to let him on. And because he was already familiar with the ‘scene’ we figured that he was uniquely qualified.”
John pushed down a stab of jealousy at Sherlock’s obvious admiration of the mysterious Irene Adler. “Please remember that I’m one of those posers tonight, you snob.”
Oh, and as to Angel, I know in BTVS canon he’s not really fighting the bad guys until 1996, but I took some liberties because I didn’t want to invent a slayer character (there’s a gap between Nikki and India), and I like the dynamic between Angel and Spike and Drusilla. Sorry if it offends, but hey, it’s an AU!
“Indeed, one day yet you might even become one of the great minds of history.” John glared and pantomimed that he was about to leave.
“Damnit, he was still just a kid.” Lestrade snapped. They’d been standing silently around the figure on the examining table lost in their own thoughts, waiting for Sherlock to burst out with something brilliant. But instead of issuing a stream of scathing insults and astounding deductions, the detective was simply staring expressionlessly at the boy on the table. John could tell that something was really bothering him from the way he was holding tension in his shoulders and jaw. It wasn’t out of place for Molly, or even Lestrade to express anger or sadness at the more vulnerable victims that have passed through this room, but he’d never seen Sherlock so affected. Looking around, John realized that could see what no one else appeared to notice- that Sherlock Holmes really was capable of love.
“Look at them all, all the little dollies, Spike. They dance for me. Not these two, though. Dance, dollies!” She looked pointedly at John and Sherlock, who made no move to do as she requested.
“What if they’re really vampires?” Sherlock completed the question for him without a hint of laughter.
At last, in a reversal of their earlier position, John found himself straddling a prone and flushed Sherlock. He took the opportunity to exact some revenge for his own earlier torture and began rotating his hips in time to the music still drifting in from the parlor. Sherlock threw his head back when John ground down, giving John the opportunity to admire the expanse of neck that lay before him. He decided that probably he should leave a message for Drusilla. Just in case. He leaned down and bit and sucked, occasionally stopping to blow gently on the heated skin which, John was happy to learn, made Sherlock wail quite beautifully.
Thank you again for reading, commenting, and kudos! Stay tuned for the exciting next chapter again on Thursday!
Irene didn’t appear bothered by Sherlock’s scorn. “You’ll see, Sherlock. But if you’re so certain, perhaps you’d like to place a small wager?” she offered suggestively.
Sherlock sighed. “I received a package earlier. It was a doll fashioned to look like you, John. It bore the same marks on its neck as all of the victims. It was a warning- a summons. I considered leaving you out of this, but eventually determined that we were more likely to survive this together.”
CRACK. The whip came down on John’s perineum, and it was more than he could take. Friction or no, he was coming harder than he’d ever come in his life screaming, “TWENTY!”
“No, John. Do not finish that thought. I refuse to allow you to sacrifice your decency. Your humanity. I would kill us both before I allowed you to turn into one of them. And since I can’t let you become a monster, and I can’t live an eternity without you, we shall just have to kill the vampires and live out our mundane, human lives solving crimes and having as much sex as possible until we are unable to do so any longer. Then we will die, hopefully in each other’s arms, and be buried somewhere to rot away. Now please stop fretting. I find myself unusually tired, for some reason, and you know how much you pressure me to sleep.” Sherlock smiled gently, pulling John into a tight embrace. John did not fall asleep quickly. There was too much to worry about. In a few short hours, they would have to leave this haven and face a threat that he wasn't even certain they could beat, even if Sherlock was sincerely uninterested in joining them. But his mind eventually stilled and he drifted off, lulled by the steady rise and fall of Sherlock’s chest and the sound of his living, beating heart.
Sherlock had been acting dodgy for days. John was aware of the detective talking to himself with more frequency and agitation than was normal, though Sherlock's version of normal was anything but. He’d also been noticing Sherlock staring at him for longer periods than usual. At one point, John had even gotten so fed up that he had returned the stare with what he imagined was matching childishness and intensity, but then he was startled by the tell-tale signs of what looked like the previous night’s eyeliner smudged around Sherlock’s waterline and decided to look away before Sherlock deduced that John found that observation very... interesting.
“Okay, we’ll see about that. But two, your plan lacks an end game. What are we supposed to we do when we identify them? Do you have a net stashed somewhere that you’ll toss over them or something? Pull off their vampire masks and reveal they were the janitor all along?”
“Welcome, mates. I’d say you should make yourself at home, maybe grab yourself a bite to eat, but you’re the snack tonight.” Spike sneered, walking up to Sherlock and sniffing his carotid artery.
Still teasing one another with both wordplay and touch, they started toward the raised dance floor. As they walked up the illuminated stairs, the haunting notes of a violin rang out over the crowd. People from dark corners began filling every empty space, dancing to the unearthly music. Sherlock took John’s hand and found an opening where they were able to fit into the ocean of bodies. John was unsurprised that Sherlock knew the song, or that he sang along into John’s ear whenever they came together in the dance.
“Exactly, love. We’re not going with him but we need to go, right now. We won’t have any more fun tonight.”
“Oh yes, John. Harder.” Sherlock dropped his voice to a pitch that John had never heard him use before, but would definitely be thinking about the next time he had some time alone.
Sherlock affected the face he made when he wasn’t planning on answering, but then he surprised John. “Yes, one of the places. But this is also the club where I decided to get clean. In part, I owe Irene for that, actually. She and Lestrade ganged up on me after a particularly embarrassing incident here one night. Please don’t ask me for further details.”
All of a sudden, the tempo increased. Everyone dancing broke into a frenzy. John noticed that the dance looked almost choreographed. It seemed like there was a pattern to it all, and that everyone knew their place in it. Sherlock looked so right here, practically floating through the twirling bodies with a nearly preternatural grace.
“As much as the idea of acquiring whatever sordid blackmail you have on my brother appeals, I’ll spare you the humiliation of defeat.”
Sherlock sighed and turned away. He hesitated for a moment and then walked out of the kitchen, but not before John saw that Sherlock’s eyes were now suspiciously glassy. Why was Sherlock running away? Did he go too far? He knew that Sherlock wasn’t generally comfortable with emotional displays, but he’d thought they’d gotten past that. He grabbed the cooling tea and followed into the living room, just as the detective was lowering a needle on the record player. There was a brief, rather harsh distorted instrumental introduction, and then a haunting voice began,
Here’s a link to read about it. I love primary source accounts of things, and this is a really great one-
Shocked by Sherlock’s admission that he could even be embarrassed, he relented. “Okay, I won’t if you don’t want me to. But are you sure you should be working this case?” he asked as the cab pulled up in front of a dark warehouse-like building. Lestrade, who had been waiting out front for their arrival, caught this last bit of their conversation.
Actual monsters or no, seeing Sherlock in danger was all that it took to move John to action. He leaped up, ready to intercept Drusilla. But just before he reached her there was a thunderous crash. Sirens and lights filled the hotel lobby as a stream of police burst through the now-demolished doors and windows. John breathed a sigh of relief, realizing that he wasn’t going to have to deal with this alone. Before any of the cavalry reached them, though, John looked over and saw Drusilla whisper something in Sherlock’s ear. Sherlock looked- angry? Disappointed? John was pulling himself back onto his feet, planning to head over and sort out what the hell Sherlock thought he was playing at, but decided that he would deal with that later as he watched their two captors practically scaling the walls to reach an upper-level window for escape. At this supernatural display, all but the most seasoned police had stopped in their tracks and were staring, stunned, as the couple seemed to fly up and out of their reach. Drusilla stopped for a moment, perched on the window sill, and looked back at John and Sherlock. Although she spoke in barely a whisper, John heard her voice clearly in his mind.
“Of course I do, you prat. How can you honestly ask me that after all we’ve been through? Don’t I follow you blindly- into all sorts of questionable situations? And sometimes even dressed like a perverted cowboy?”
John found himself suddenly unable to remember how any his limbs worked. He stood motionless, soaking in the vision of ethereal creature that had taken the place of his earlier bedraggled and obnoxious flatmate. Sherlock had teased his normally unruly curls into a halo of precision ratting and hairspray. He was wearing a white poet’s shirt with long flared sleeves. The front was unlaced half-way down his long neck and pale chest, and John wanted desperately to slip his hand into the opening and see if his skin felt as lovely as it looked. Sherlock had tucked said shirt into the tightest and best-fitting pair of leather trousers that John had ever seen (and he’d seen a few, thank you very much). Each leg also had corset lacing along their front from his iliac crests all the way down his impossibly long legs to his boot tops, with which he’d added a couple of inches to his already willowy height. John congratulated himself that he was able to conjure the coherent thought that the boots weren’t so impractical that he couldn’t chase criminals. Sherlock had gone light on his makeup, compared to what John knew about goth culture, but John's brain, apparently working again, reasoned that Sherlock probably did it on purpose since needed to be recognizable for their charade to be effective. He had applied heavy eyeliner, though, and darkly lined burgundy stain to his lush, lush lips. He’d also done something to accentuate those ridiculous cheekbones. His long violinist’s fingers, now sporting black lacquered nails, was clutching at the strings of a deep purple waist cincher.
“You know what I mean. Proper backup. If two people really are capable of killing that many people in a night then I’m not sure what you and John- even with that gun I’m not supposed to know about- think you’ll accomplish.”
Just as he was losing consciousness, Sherlock said quietly, “I once wished very much to become a vampire.”
Sherlock was moving his mouth as if to protest John’s withdrawal, but all he was managing were incoherent huffs and moans. But although he couldn’t form words, Sherlock was finding other ways to communicate exactly what he wanted. He encircled John’s head with one hand, pulling him back down insistently to his neck. With his other hand, he began trailing his fingers feather-lightly down John’s spine, dipping down the curve of his lumbar region, up the curve of his arse, and then more forcefully into the crevice. When he reached John’s entrance, he lingered, rubbing circles around the sensitive flesh. There was no way this was going to last as long as John had hoped.
Drusilla and Spike wasted no time tonight, ignoring the longing stares and groping hands of the other dancers as they stalked directly over to John and Sherlock. John wondered how he could have, even briefly, considered Spike attractive as he watched him slink and slither with the most self-assured, smarmy expression on his face. In contrast with Sherlock’s natural grace and commanding presence, this guy was bootleg. Maybe his overconfidence was largely derived from his association with Drusilla.
“But I don’t WANT to go with Daddy. He’s not any fun any more. He used to be ever so much fun, too. Now he's just all guilt and rats.”
Eventually Sherlock pulled back, still holding John’s face reverently but out of reach of his kisses. Maintaining heated eye contact, he curled his fingers and ran his nails back along John’s temples, carding through his short hair until long fingers were wrapped around the nape of John’s neck. Sherlock arched up, stretching his long torso as tall as he could while remaining planted in John’s lap, pulling John’s head to his abdomen when he reached his full height. John breathed deeply, drowning in scent and sensation, rubbing his cheek against the downy hair that he found peeking out of the unfastened trousers. Unable to help himself, John took the zipper in his teeth and pulled it down, finally getting to appreciate a part of Sherlock’s anatomy that had been haunting him day and night. He ran his hands up Sherlock’s hips and pulled the obstructing fabric down as far as he could manage with Sherlock still straddling his lap. He ran his nose up the side of Sherlock’s cock, memorizing the heady perfume and reveling in the sensation of Sherlock’s pulse beating through the dorsal vein, noting that it sped up considerably when he reached out with his tongue and licked.
“Hm, yes. Saving London from peril- I’ve been reading about you in the papers. I’ve saved a few of the better photographs they’ve taken too for my… personal collection.”
“Well, should I get up? Are we going after them now? You’ll have to give me a sec to get dressed, I’m not exactly decent here.”
Sherlock didn’t bother to reply. Instead, he leaned in closer to John. “With so few patrons here, we’ll have to find a way to blend in, darling,” Sherlock rumbled into his ear, catching him off-guard again and sending a tremor straight to his cock. “We’d better go get settled in on the dance floor.”
John started at Sherlock's rare use of the word 'please'. He really didn’t want to let Sherlock think he wouldn’t be absolutely chuffed to proclaim to the world that he was in- whatever- with the amazing Sherlock Holmes. He took a deep breath before answering. “Sherlock. I don’t give a rat’s ass of the entire commonwealth thinks I’m a fruit, or a naff, or whatever in-between.”
“It’s alright, I haven’t been very forthcoming about details about my previous life. I’m sure you have many assumptions that I’ll prove wrong.” He gave John a half-smile, then his expression changed to something sinister. “He was in my homeless network. He may have been targeted.”
John rubbed his hands on his thighs and sighed. “Okay, okay. I’d better go get the shopping done then, if we’re to be on a case for the next however long. And the washing up.”
Sherlock let go of John’s head and reached under the pillow behind him, pulling out a bottle with a somewhat smug expression on his face. John said a silent prayer of thanks to the gods of sex for the detective’s foresight. Sherlock flipped the cap open with his thumb and John cried out at the loss of contact when Sherlock reached up to coat his fingers. John spread his legs a bit wider, rutting unabashedly against Sherlock’s hip in the process. Sherlock clicked the bottle closed, tossed it down next to them, and then resumed his earlier ministrations on John’s arsehole, now with more viscosity. Instead of resuming his hold on John’s head, which was now free to have latched firmly on one of the detective’s apparently very sensitive nipples, Sherlock began working him open with fingers from both hands. He was trapped by Sherlock’s arms, held solidly in place while long fingers delicately pressed in and pulled out, curled and crooked, teasing him mercilessly and playing him like a violin. It didn’t take very long at all before John was arching his back and moaning wantonly.
Lestrade looked at the file in his hand. “He's from Hackney. He was reported missing in 1983- he was sixteen. Looks like the lazy bastards working his case wrote him up as a runaway and closed it within a couple of weeks. His parents didn’t seem to press the issue.”
“Nothing we could ever do in public would be even close to the crime that is his attempt at undercover attire.”
“If you could just tell us what you are avoiding telling us, Irene, rather than trying to distract ‘my’ John with your innuendo.” Sherlock drew the attention back to himself, and their reason for being there.
“Oh? And what, exactly, does she need to be talking to my boyfriend about?” John thought he could see Sherlock preening a bit at his terminology.
A new song came on. John stepped back a few paces; he wanted to be able to be at hand if Sherlock should require him. He leaned against the rail that encircled the dance floor. While he was debating if he had time to nip over to the bar and get that drink, he picked up some of the lyrics and chuckled at the thought that either Irene Adler or the DJ seemed to have a great sense of humor.
“Mm, look at him, Spike, he’s all bristly. He thinks he’s a lion. RAWR!” She bared and snapped her teeth at him. Despite the absurdity of it, John found himself a little terrified. “The other one, though, he’s a tiger. Mmm, sleek and cunning. Or maybe he’s a sphinx. So many answers, yet still so curious. Curiosity killed the kitty, though, again and again, and now he’s only got one more life left.”
John had quickly deduced that Irene Adler was as cunning and perceptive as Sherlock himself. He was pretty certain that she saw right through their ruse and he worried slightly at her giving them away. He was also sure that she knew that he was in- whatever he was for Sherlock- and that for some reason she was trying to get a rise out of him . He was nervous that she could put them in even more danger than they needed to be in.  Sherlock must have had the same concern because he seemed to be making an effort to save John from embarrassment, which was completely out of character for the self-proclaimed sociopath. [He’s probably just warning me to stay in character, what with me being the dim one of the bunch.] He was trying to work out how this version of John Watson was supposed to be reacting to this situation when Sherlock wrapped his arm around his waist. Of all the options he'd considered, he was pretty sure he wasn’t supposed to startle quite so violently when his ‘boyfriend’ touched him. He’d have to definitely work on that.
“Fine. But hire some faster backup. I’m not going lose the suspects again because your men can’t keep up.”
“Yes- yes sir!” John cried as he spread his legs obediently. He was rewarded with a light tap on his thigh, the leather just grazing his skin.
John was not at all surprised that Sherlock obviously missed the reference. “I’ve worked out a set of signals with the Yarders inside. They will then leap to action. No nets required.”
“John. You forgot to say ‘Yes, sir’. If you’d like me to show you how much you could enjoy this, you’ll behave appropriately.” Sherlock studied him for a minute, then smacked the crop down again in exactly the same place. “John…”
“I’ll come with you, Drusilla,” he purred, giving her his most charming fake smile, not the one that made the little creases around his eyes that only John got to see. “Of course I’ll come with you.”
Drusilla grimaced, emitting a low moan which gave way to a long, high pitched whine, and stomped her foot petulantly. It was all John could do to not roll his eyes at the sudden childish display, but found strength in the fact that Sherlock still seemed to have his wits about him. In fact, he seemed to be rather enjoying the whole thing.
The tempo increased again. The crowd began circling the dark-haired woman, who had positioned herself in the center of the floor.  There was no trace of her previous demure persona. Instead, she was a siren, a succubus, commanding everyone’s attention with pure seduction and the aura of raw power. John watched as Sherlock deftly used the movements of his dance to observe those dancing around her like worshipers, breathing a sigh of relief that Sherlock hadn’t been sucked into the mass hysteria that seemed to be unfolding around him.
John knew he was fucked. Royally. And literally, hopefully. Sherlock hummed as he very gently smoothed the emerging welt with the leather tongue.  He took his time now, knowing that John was in utter compliance. John felt Sherlock teasing the whip over his sore left buttock. His skin erupted in goose bumps as Sherlock ghosted the whip over his Venusian dimples and down to the center of the unblemished cheek. He began a slowly unfolding spiral outward, around and around, larger and larger, until he had nowhere to go with the tip of the riding crop but straight down the crack of John’s arse.  Sherlock increased pressure as he passed John’s opening and slid down his perineum and John cried out, rutting forcefully against the bed.
“Well, at least it’s put me off sex for the time being. Or maybe forever. I could have lived a thousand lifetimes without seeing him in a mesh vest.”
Sherlock ignored him, working his entrance wider, excruciatingly slowly, though Sherlock’s rock-hard and leaking cock betrayed his façade of composure. John was writhing and wordlessly trying to beg-- he’d lost language entirely at this point. He was drowning in sensation as Sherlock’s clever fingers tortured him with random, delicate brushes against his prostate. He was twisting his hips to thrust his aching cock against anything he could reach, trying desperately to get enough friction, chasing an orgasm that was just beyond his reach. And then Sherlock stopped his exploration of John’s arse, and John cried out at the emptiness that now filled him.
John’s face was flushed, and his jeans were tight again from just listening to Sherlock talk about sex. He mentally added Sherlock’s voice to his list of kinks. “You’re trying to kill me, aren’t you?”
Lestrade looked at the paper, then at John’s face, and said, “I’m gonna use the loo, boys. Be right back.” No one noticed.
“I DID call, John. I knew you’d insist upon it. Also, I really would like to catch these irritating serial killers so that we can resume our earlier activities. But in the likelihood that I’m correct and that they lose us, I assume you found the hidden feature in your vest and accessorised appropriately. I’ll need you to not hesitate, when the time comes. They are ruthless killers, and we might have to fight for our lives tonight. Are you still willing to come along?”
John was deep in thought, going through the unconscious motions of domesticity when he felt Sherlock’s arms wrap around him. Despite all of his simmering anxieties and the uncertainty weighing heavily between them, he leaned back into the embrace, relaxing into the comfort Sherlock was offering. They stood there silently, savoring each other’s company long enough that John had to restart the kettle to finish the task he’d come into the kitchen for. Eventually, John spoke up. “I can’t believe I’m saying this, Sherlock, but what if…” He hesitated, afraid the detective would laugh at him if he finished his thought.
“Yes!” Sherlock snapped into the receiver. He listened for a moment before yelling, “Lestrade, there’s another one.”
“Not people, John. Just you. But I will ask you, this once, would you like me to leave?” There was such confidence in his voice. Sherlock knew John was not going to tell him to stop. And damn it, he really wasn’t. “Good. Turn over. I can make you enjoy this, John. But you’ll have to cooperate.”
Sherlock was staring daggers at him. If John hadn’t known it was impossible, he’d have sworn that Sherlock looked hurt. Before he could be sure of what he saw, Sherlock resumed his neutral face.
The detective wrapped his arms and legs tightly around John, leaning in close as he was hoisted into the air. He took advantage of his proximity to John’s ear by rumbling his approval at this turn of events, punctuating his grunts with nibbles and bites on John’s earlobe. John realized that there was no way he’d make it up the stairs and headed toward Sherlock’s room, crossing the distance in record time.
John gave him a half-hearted glare. Of course he was supposed to have somehow known that now they were investigating other locations.
Sherlock blinked a few times. They passed another two blocks in silence before Sherlock resumed his dialog as though he hadn’t been completely distracted. “I am personally acquainted with the owner of this club. You may find her appearance rather extreme- or perhaps not, given your newly revealed depths. Should I assume that you have a deep hidden knowledge of goth culture as well as gay culture, John?”
Sure enough, Sherlock unconsciously brought his fingertips up to his carotid artery, gently, and licked his lips. John considered this point his. Before Sherlock could sneak in the last word, John picked up his journal, saying he’d be upstairs working on his next article until they left.
“Hmmm, I don’t think so, love. Sherlock will be ever so fun when we turn him. The other one will be gloomy if we take away his humanity. Look at him, Spike. He loves it so much; wears it like armor. Sherlock, though. He’s already half-way here. And when he wakes up hungry and eats his boyfriend, oh now that will be something to see. My tiger will be the best pet a girl could hope for.” She looked at him approvingly. John felt like maybe they were trying to be insulting, but somehow instead felt a welling-up of pride that his humanity was so palpable that even- wait. He stopped as he realized he was actually entertaining the notion that these psychopaths were actually vampires.
Sherlock was silent for a long time. John was beginning to get nervous. If he said yes, would John be able to let him go? Would this be all they had?
John laughed, breaking the tension of the moment. He took a deep breath and adjusted himself in his jeans. “Well, then finish up this case quick please. I’d like to get back to this as soon as possible.”
“Of course. But remember, staring at women’s breasts will not only likely be entirely unwelcome, it will potentially hurt our cover story, which if you’ll remember is that we are intimate and ‘exclusive’.”
Sherlock scoffed, obviously sharing his observation. “Don’t tell me you’ve become superstitious, Irene.”
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
“Spiiiike…” Drusilla reprimanded. “What did we talk about giving the dolly a choice? We did talk about this before we went out.”
After a morning of turbulent dreams featuring vampires and war flashbacks, John woke up feeling not very well-rested. He contemplated trying for another few hours of sleep, but the fear of more nightmares kept him from trying. There didn’t seem to be any noise to indicate Sherlock had gotten up yet, but then again it was just as likely he had come out of his trance and left during John’s sleep. Just thinking that he’d gone out alone was enough to prompt John out of bed and downstairs, but Sherlock hadn’t moved.
“I’d be flattered but I know it’s his way of avoiding the question. I’m not gonna get to know the details of the plan, then?”
“Don’t fret, John. I neglected to mention that part of our ruse involves us being- involved.” Sherlock was wearing his most unaffected face. “I have a list of reasons prepared why this is more important than your rather erroneously adamant declarations of your heterosexuality.”
“Mmm,” John had relocated his efforts, and was busy teasing his way down Sherlock’s pectoral muscle, leaving a trail of reddening marks in his wake.
hello, and i'm back! i'm so sorry to make you all wait so long! i was wrestling with how to wrap this one up in one chapter and realized that what i really wanted to do with it couldn't be done that quickly. so here's an action chapter, prepare yourself for some feels next time. john and sherlock sure have a lot to talk about!
“John. I need you to hear me. I will not accept their offer. In addition to concerns of the restrictions of nocturnal living and the ethics of murder, the truth of the matter is that I could not bear to watch you grow old and die, only to live forever missing you.”
“You’re working for the common good, Sherlock. You catch murderers and pedos and all sorts of bad guys. Your methods may be a little harsh, but the greater good…”
“John, we must go to the morgue now. Be angry later.” Before John could respond that he wasn’t angry any more anyway, Sherlock was flying out of the kitchen. He grabbed his coat shouting at John and Lestrade to hurry up already. John smiled wistfully at his untouched tea. Before following Sherlock and Lestrade out of the door, he carefully folded the newspaper and tucked it into a safe place on the bookshelf. Despite his mixed feelings about the public exposure, he’d definitely be cutting that one out for his scrapbook.
Sherlock continued moving upward, one stroke at a time, as John counted to ten. Once Sherlock reached John's lower back, he stopped lashing and gently ran the tip of the crop around John’s now striped arse, admiring his handiwork. Without warning, he snapped the whip down three times in rapid succession, directly on top of his first target. John gasped for breath, hovering in a euphoric haze somewhere between pain and pleasure.
John pushed down his anger. He knew Sherlock wasn’t used to considering others’ feelings, and that he was trying. But he also knew that he had to make himself very clear, lest the detective get any ideas in the future. “If something had happened to you, and I hadn’t had even a chance to prevent it, I wouldn’t be safe. Not from myself. I would have carried that guilt with me forever.”
John sobered at the tone of the question. He sounded- worried? Hesitant? John wasn’t sure where this uncertainty was coming from, but it was totally out of character for the detective. He took Sherlock’s hand, saying solemnly, “I trust you more than I’ve ever trusted anyone in my life.”
This wasn’t the most romantic song, John thought idly, scanning the crowd. Maybe, though- he amended as he returned to watching Sherlock singing, eyes closed dreamily-  it was the most romantic thing he’d ever heard. If he was feeling poetic, he’d maybe describe it as being made of broken promises, wounded hearts, and the turmoil that was the fear and longing to do it again. If he was feeling poetic. He laughed to himself. This place was really bringing out his inner goth. Sherlock opened his eyes to see John laughing and dancing. Eyes blazing, he slowly bowed his head down seized John’s mouth with his own. So much for not making out.
John glanced around looking for the man who had prompted their flight, but he was gone. John hoped that whoever he was, he was on their side. He seemed to be the only person that the couple was genuinely afraid of. Or at least annoyed by, which to psychopaths must be rather like being afraid, John thought. They exited the sanctuary of the goth club and tore through the raucous front room and past the ever-vigilant Irene, who was pointing grimly in the direction of an emergency door John hadn't noticed before. Followed by a couple of people John assumed were the promised backup, they stepped outside. Sherlock scanned the area. He decisively turned away from the line of people awaiting entry at the front door and ducked through an alley, John just a step behind. They eventually lost the coppers assigned to help them. They careened around corners, scaled fire escapes, and ran along rooftops for hours, until the sun’s rays began to peek over the horizon. John was exhausted, sore, and irritated by the time they returned home, but Sherlock was positively irate. As they climbed the stairs, Sherlock commenced a scathing rant about how two nitwits could not have possibly outsmarted him, loftily declaring that surely they must have had much smarter outside help, and began reciting an increasingly angry list of the ways in which they could have possibly escaped without leaving a viable trail for him to pick up. John nodded along sympathetically, hoping they weren't waking Mrs Hudson. Though he was certain that Sherlock wasn’t looking for reassurance, nor probably did he even notice John's presence. Sure enough, after tossing his coat onto John’s chair, Sherlock plopped himself down onto the couch in the reclining version of his thinking pose. John sighed, brooding over how promisingly the evening had started. He knew he wouldn’t get another word from Sherlock for at least several hours, no less be able to explore the ‘later’ that had been subtly promised. He trudged dejectedly up to his room to try to sleep for a few hours until Sherlock needed him again.
John fell into a rhythm, sliding up and down with mounting intensity, rotating his hips at different angles with each pass to maximize sensation. Sherlock was keening, thrusting up to meet John each time. Just as John thought he’d reached the peak of corporeal pleasure, Sherlock reached out with still-slick hands and began stroking his cock in time with their increasingly erratic thrusts.
John turned around, half hoping that Sherlock would maul him again, but instead Sherlock reached into the chair cushion and brought out his riding crop. He handed it to John and said, smirking, “One must always remember to accessorise appropriately.”
It was nearly time to go, but John was pushing the boundaries of said punctuality. He seemed to be unable to stop gaping at himself in the mirror. He turned around again, and again, slowly. He’d barely registered Sherlock’s comment earlier about buying him jeans and a jacket, but now the reality of it was wrapped around him in denim and leather and buckles and chains. Left to his own devices, he always shopped for comfort first, style second. Now though he was reconsidering his style choices. He'd spent the last ten minutes checking out his backside in the mirror as well as he could, pondering how something as simple as a different pair of jeans could perform such a transformation The tapered leather jacket hit right above his waist, definitely accentuating his- finer qualities. [Well, fuck, maybe I should let Sherlock buy all my clothes. Of course he knew my exact measurements. At the very least I’d be sure to have more luck with women if I went out like this more often. Well, at least until they met Sherlock.] He glanced at his watch, which he'd dutifully left on the nightstand since Sherlock hadn't mentioned it as part of his outfit. He nodded his head once, determined, and decided that it was now or never. He’d been listening to Sherlock crashing around downstairs for the last hour, likely undoing all the tidying he’d done today. Bracing himself for anything, he went downstairs to survey the damage, sparing one last glance at his arse in the mirror.
They stepped through the creaking doors together. John immediately noticed a drop in temperature. He then observed that the staircase was crumbling, seemingly beyond repair in parts, and descending at least two stories below ground. Before they made their way down the first flight he'd already lost sight of Sherlock rounding a corner, always four strides ahead with his impossibly long legs. John followed him with a bit more caution, which he considered quite warranted for what he was certain the imminent collapse of the entire building. He tried to imagine the immaculate Sherlock seeking this place out for refuge, or even recreation, and found it nearly impossible. As he turned the corner to another, somehow more decrepit stairwell, he began to hear the catchy chorus of a show tune that he vaguely recognized. And then, as his eyes adjusted to the dimness and flashing lights emanating from the door behind her, he noticed Sherlock lithely folding himself into the embrace of one of the most intimidating and gorgeous women he’d ever seen in real life. [Well, he did try to warn me... I guess that answers some questions, too. But I can’t believe the bastard had the audacity to tell ME to lay off the women. Christ, aren’t I just the idiot thinking that I could ever be in his league.]
“And you needed to wake me at arse-o’-clock to tell me?” John was getting a little nervous. Knowing Sherlock, this could either be very good or very bad.
“You’re fucking right it makes me angry! Now the whole city thinks-” he couldn’t quite decide how he wanted to finish that sentence.
“Good, John. Very good.” Sherlock sounded sincerely pleased with him, and John realized that he wasn’t even embarrassed at how he preened at Sherlock’s praise. “Now, John. I’m going to need you to count for me. Can you do that?”
“The longer we wait, the more people will die. We will act tonight. I have three possible theories and one of them must be true. I’ve prepared for each potentiality. We will escape, unscathed.”
The cab driver hadn’t even given them a second glance, an aspect of living in London that John was extremely grateful for- he hadn’t really thought through how they would look to the random observer. Now, nestled into the backseat, John began to worry about what the night had in store. They’d been so wrapped up in their personal tension that he’d nearly forgotten that they were about to go confront two psychopaths who had slaughtered dozens of innocent people.
John eyed him warily, having really only listened to about half of what Sherlock just said, still stewing over the ruined curry. “Oh? A case then? Or are you finally taking me out?”
“Sherlock,” John warned out of habit, though as far as Sherlock’s interactions with Molly were, that was rather tame. He must really be distracted.
Sherlock cleared his throat and announced, “John, we are going out tonight. You will wear the Levi’s on your bed, your military boots, and a white crew neck. Please also wear your dog tags. I’ve taken the liberty of procuring you an appropriate jacket. Your disguise will require little else. I will assist you with your hair before we leave. Be ready at eleven pm."
They lay together, catching their breath and lazily caressing each other, too exhausted to speak. Eventually, John rolled carefully off Sherlock, whose eyes followed him contentedly as he left the room to dispose of the spent condom and get a flannel. He took great pleasure in teasing the detective’s sensitized chest with the rough cotton, taking longer than necessary to clean the evidence of their lovemaking. He was still exhausted, so even though he felt a vague stirring at Sherlock’s breathy reaction when he grazed his still-erect nipples, he knew they’d have to wait for another go. He tossed the flannel aside, not really caring where it landed. Gathering up the mussed bedsheets, he folded himself into Sherlock’s waiting embrace and tucked the bedding around them.  He turned his head and kissed the parts of Sherlock that he could reach without moving too much until he began drifting off into sleep.
By the time John felt clean enough to venture into the kitchen in the hope of a much-needed cup of tea, it seemed like Sherlock and Lestrade had calmed down a bit.
“I wasn’t ‘lurking’. I just never know what I’m walking into is all. Mornin’ Lestrade,  I see Sherlock didn’t offer you tea?” Sherlock looked slightly offended at the thought of making anyone tea. Lestrade just laughed. “So, a new plan then?” John asked as he got out three mugs.
Spike snarled, but obediently released Sherlock. John was relieved- he was afraid he was going to have to use deadly force before Sherlock got the information that he wanted, and he wasn’t certain if not solving the case would put Sherlock off sex that night and was glad he didn’t have to take the risk. As he was struggling to regain control over his simmering rage, Drusilla leaped impossibly high and brought down the stair to a fire escape above her head and shocked his anger right out of him.
