Dean lets himself get pressed against a wall and feels her breath hot against his neck. He stiffens and drops his boots beside him. They land with a light thud as she presses herself against him.
He stumbles back into the motel and finds it dimly lit. A familiar face looks up at him from a magazine, from the single bed in the room.
“Castiel?” another barista calls and Dean frowns. What the hell? He gets up and goes to stand by the counter. He’s gonna ask what the hell takes so long to heat up a sandwich.
“You’ve been awake for a week straight, angel. You’re still human. You need rest or else the next comedown’s gonna be a nightmare,” comes the gentle response from beside him.
Dean drops the blade. Instead he presses his hand against the demon’s torso. He focuses the rage in his heart and his fingers pierce through the fabric as he presses inward. The demon gasps underneath him, body flinching entirely as Dean’s hand sinks into the vessel with an echo of the strength of a former knight of hell. He doesn’t grab at anything physical, but instead at the essence. At the metaphysical manifestation of evil that appears as a cloud of smoke nesting inside the warm flesh like a parasite.
The R&R continues for the next several days. The first three, Dean finds, are the worst. He spends most of them asleep, but when he does have to wake up and function, he’s so irritable it pisses himself off. Lights are too bright, things taste sharper than they should, and Dean goes through several moments where it feels like he’s watching himself do things. He hates it. By the fifth, he’s as close to normal as he can be. There’s an itch under his skin that he can’t scratch and he’s on edge the entire day. He spends most of it walking around the neighbourhood aimlessly. It’s the first complete day he has.
He ends up in the stands of the field, taking slow and heavy steps up and down the bleachers. There’s a feeling of peace that floats in the air that generally makes him feel uneasy. He’s hunted ghosts long enough that he knows there’s no peace in a life like his, and yet, here it is.
Sam doesn’t return. Castiel gets up and sits back down on the bed this time with his back against the headboard and with his warmest smile, he invites Dean to sit with him. Dean takes him up on it. Castiel flicks through the channels and they sit there for hours, in complete comfortable silence.
sam nods and gets up. dean hears the door that leads back into the house slide open and then slide shut. and dean is left with himself at the end of it all. he sighs. he’s happy, he thinks.
And, when Dean needs her to, she’ll lure out an evil man. Not exactly family friendly, but they’re not actually family. But, now? Now, she’s not of much use, despite being a decent kid.
The man that approaches them is an ugly wannabe businessman with an embarrassing hairline. He steps forward, towering over Dean with an irate expression on his face.
and dean laughs. it was an emergency, but the kind that didn't have him spiraling into a depression. that was... almost nice, he thinks. they have normal people problems now. he leans over to where cas is asleep beside him and cas' trained as well as dean is. he stirs awake with the movement and opens his eyes in a half-awake gesture.
Things reach a breaking point when they find reports of kids going missing. Well, kids, to Bobby, and hell, to Dean, too. Dean is twenty eight now. The kids going missing are twenty four. There’s weird stuff happening in the lives of the kids, enough that the trail that traces back to a fire in Lawrence, Kansas isn’t so much speculation as it is another lead. They’re all the same age as Sam. They all had weird things happen within six months of being born. Sam fits all of the criteria.
The fingers of his free hand pat at the thin lines of blood and he wipes it down some. It doesn’t do anything except get his torso bloodier. The blood continues to flow as Dean considers, for a brief moment, slitting his own throat. He knows it’ll heal faster than a normal human’s would, given all the demon blood coursing through his veins. He presses the tip of the blade against his throat with very little pressure behind it. He feels the tip dig into his skin and he holds it there until he’s sure it’s broken skin. Then he pulls it away. A speck of red appears at his throat, followed by the smallest drop of blood.
Sam’s observation sends a chill up and down Dean’s spine. But, still he can’t really dwell on that right now. He steps into Cas’ room and finds the guy sitting at the desk, his face buried in some textbook.
That’s the problem, he thinks. At its core, it comes down to taking down what took everything from them. Because, it really wasn’t just limited to their mother. He’d been enrolled in an elementary school and was the most popular girl in the fourth grade when John had made them move to the United States. Sam had only just started kinder and never got to watch the newest episode of Plaza Sesamo that was supposed to premiere the day after they left. They’d arrived on new soil, with people speaking a language that was foreign to them, and were forced to learn to survive here. Most of their stuff had been left at the little house on the street corner in Mexico City.
Sam’s seventeenth birthday comes and with it a celebration. Sam, however, is less enthused. He seems to have a good enough time during the party, which is thrown at a restaurant that’s a little finer than the usual diners they eat at, but later that night when John’s gone out again and it’s just them two, Sam stands at the door, fidgeting with his fingers. He’s got something on his mind.
at the name. He takes a few more seconds before he finally says, “thank you.” It’s breathy, softer than his voice has been the entire night.
he takes a deep breath and thinks about sam. he loves his little brother more than he can ever explain. it’s unhealthy, probably, how much he’d done to save sam from everything. death, despair, sam himself that time he lost his soul. dean was there and willing to bleed for whatever sam needed. and he knew sam would always do the same. it was comforting. and even moreso now that they’d decided to take some time to really asses what was best for either of them. sam let himself want his apple pie life again. and it was the happiest day of dean’s life to see his little brother decorating the house he’d leased with eileen.
“It’s a long fucking story, Sammy,” he says. He looks away, toward the front door, completely hesitating.
His head comes up from the trash can that’s off to the side of the sciences building. The smell of garbage and his own insides makes him duck down again and go for round two. When he thinks he can detach himself from the sides of the receptacle, he fishes in his bag for a half-crushed water bottle and tosses that in to top the pukey pie he’s left the custodial staff as he heads over to where practise is happening currently.
“Everything. The werewolves we’re after, I think it’s a pack. These three guys. I got their pictures from the police,” John shows him the pictures, as if that helps anything.
“Only because you’ve asked so nicely,” the demon responds. He brings Dean’s face back in front of him and kisses him deeply. Dean makes a sound of content that resembles a whimper. His hands go up to grab at the strands of neatly kept dark hair as the demon reaches up to bring them down so he can push Dean’s open button-up off his shoulders, leaving his arms barren. He pulls away, then. Dean flips around so his back is against the headboard.
Dean has always worn his heart on his sleeve and Castiel can almost see the waves of emotion as they wrack through Dean. They’re always overwhelming, they’ve always engulfed him in his entirety. Dean is the most caring human being Castiel has ever known and Castiel has known all of humanity. Understanding how Dean can love so deeply and so unconditionally is how Castiel has come to care about anything in this world. Dean Winchester at his core is pure, raw love and as such, Castiel learned how to love from love itself.
“You’re going to get yourself caught. You’re going to get me fucking killed!” Logan yells, arms outstretched in exasperation. But Dean doesn’t care. He’s so close. He’s in the last stretch of this long damning game he’s been playing for what seems like forever now. Just one more. He’d need to find one more man. And he can, he just needs to get another dose in.
He lets the back of his head hit the door and lets his back slide down until he reaches a sitting position. He pulls his knees up to his chest as close as he can and lets the emotion reach his eyes. He presses the base of his palms into his eyes and rubs violently as he lets out short choked silent sobs that would make John call him weak.
She’s got light brown hair and a set of legs Dean’s almost jealous of. When he approaches her, she turns to him with a smile and a set of green eyes almost as deep as his own. She has to be at least half his age. He gives her a smile that he remembers having won people over.
Dean looks up at Castiel. He makes eye contact with Dean for several seconds before Dean looks back at Sam and his hands give them the answers they’ve been looking for.
His coach nods understandingly. He reaches over and pats Dean on the back and says, “if you miss next week your ass is on the curb.”
It never comes. It feels like centuries pass him by as his hand rests on the angel’s face. His knees begin to ache, but he pays it no mind. The longer he stares at the angel, at the way the lines of his face rest at odd angles, relaxed, unburdened by the weight Dean feels has been set on his shoulders, the more Dean feels like his vision loses focus. Dean doesn’t notice or feel when Sam forces him up to his feet.
“Okay, uh, well, I’m glad you’re doing well. But, I was actually referring to… whatever happened to you and dad,” Sam says. He sits up properly, rubbing the sleep out of his eyes completely.
When he makes it there. Mary is the one that gives him a warm look. She’s trying to mother both him and Sam. Her expression is confused for a moment before she reaches and pulls Castiel’s phone from his pocket, pausing the music for him. Castiel takes the phone back from her and takes a seat at the table across from her. Jack is very focused colouring in a book beside her.
Sam’s head turns back at Dean, but Dean’s put his hand down already. His lips have curved downward and he’s looking down at the sheets.
After an ultrasound he mostly zones out for, he’s dressed and sitting with the doctor, looking at the anomalies in his body that give him the excess pain. No tumours, just the nature of things. He gets given a list of things he’s going to beg John to buy that will help with the pain as well as some painkillers.
“I know,” Dean says, not looking up at the man as he holds the doll out further. The adrenaline of the moment is catching up to him, alleviating the exhaustion that comes from speaking. The little girl stares up at Dean, her eyes still filled with fear. Dean’s smile becomes a grin as he says, “go on. It’s for you.”
they'd gotten back earlier that afternoon and had spent most of the day lounging around until the exhaustion got the better of them at around nine. well, except jack. who could have just driven back to kentucky if he wanted to. cas made sure he didn't want to. so, it's saturday night, cas is breathing deeply beside him, completely asleep, jack is probably watching TV in the dean-cave, and dean has been drifting in and out of sleep for the past 20 minutes when his phone buzzes to the tune of the Call Me Maybe song. it's the tone he'd set up for eileen because, well, she never calls. so, when she does call, it's usually an emergency flare that's followed up with an explanatory text. dean's eyes shoot awake as he watches the call miss and waits a second for eileen's message to come in.
He pulls the pocketknife out from his pocket and flicks it open. He stares down at the blade for a moment, before his eyes flick back to his reflection in the mirror. Dean’s torso is a homage to the things he’s done in the past several years. There are deep lacerations from struggles, from fights, and from Dean himself among the explicitly telling entry points of all the syringes he’s gone through. He drags the dull end of the blade down a piece of skin near his stomach that’s healed over a shade lighter than the rest of his skin. He breathes in deep as he flips the blade and runs it across perpendicular. He goes for as long as he inhales. The shiver that goes up his spine pushes the tension in his chest out with the blood. He exhales as he watches the red begin to drip down his own torso.
Sam says, holding his arms out, “I think I had a right to know when I finally became a fucking orphan!”
Later that night, when John’s out and they’re both stuck home alone, he decides to test the waters, so to speak.
He knows John is around somewhere. John has a sniper rifle trained on the flashlight and the signal is to fire wherever it’s pointed. It does nothing for the fear that doing this instills in his eldest, but he carries on.
Every now and then, Castiel will feel Dean watching him. He’ll turn to meet Dean's eyes with the same easy smile. Castiel wants to reach out and touch him, wants to hold his face and tell him that everything is okay now, wants to hold his hand and reconcile the violence in his heart. Dean’s eyes beg him for a touch they both know Dean can’t stomach receiving. It makes Castiel’s heart break.
He remembers Billie Holiday, or hearing of her, at least. His memory has been faulty since he was pulled abruptly from the empty. Despite the memory issues, he remembers that experience entirely.
And sometimes Sam wishes his family problems were reduced to having illegitimate siblings. It’s always some supernatural adventure that usually leaves him with more questions than answers. This was the case when John would come home covered in something’s guts and is absolutely the case now.
He’d never been with a girl, not really, but he’d found himself in situations on solo-hunts where he’d tried out what he’d told himself was heterosexuality. If he was a man, then he should be attracted to women. And he
The trip to California is just like any other. It’s long, tedious, and he ends up driving for longer periods of time the closer he gets to the California border. Anxiety sinks deep in Dean the closer he gets and he finds himself setting into a mindset where he’s decided he’s just going to go for it. Dean loves Sam more than he could probably say and he knows Sam is also the most compassionate person he’s ever known. If Sam decides to be pissy about Dean, well, Dean’s not going to think about that until it happens.
Sam takes a deep breath as he looks over at Jess, she’s in the doorway again. Two mugs steam in her hands.
prison. Nobody touches him because he’s deemed a threat to both himself and others. He spends most of his stay in solitary, only being let out during breaks between guards, when one of his father’s friends named Deacon, can help him out with the investigation. They find the ghost and the poor man nearly gets got, but Dean’s a professional.
“Oh, me, Dean. You’re getting really good at this. I’m kind of proud of you,” God says, with a chuckle. He pokes at the man’s corpse with the tip of His boot. He looks back up at Dean and nods while saying, “this makes 131. You’re getting there, cowboy. Don’t give up.”
“Have a smoke, I know. I’m just busting your balls, man,” Dean says with a grin. The guy’s expression shifts to one of curiosity in the same way that Anna’s does sometimes.
Dean show up seven years later, with late news of their dad and then have the audacity to ask Sam to go across the country with him? It’s absurd. Sam hates him.
“You’re okay, sweetheart,” Bobby says, running a calloused hand through dry, tangled brown hair. “You’re alright. You’re not alone.”
Dean glances up at him again and does a double take. He stares forward at Castiel, his eyes softening to match his expression. Castiel runs his thumb back and forth across Dean’s knee. Dean can only stare forward at him.
choose to be. If he’s a brat about it, just kick his ass. It’s what we did to little brothers in my day.”
. The tension that had risen in his chest doesn’t fade away, but it doesn’t get any worse. The man manages to scoot out from underneath Dean and he starts to get up.
“Not bait, honey. I’ll be right there with you. You know my shot’s unmatched,” John explains. It’s really that simple.
and dean thinks, as he drives over. that it’s his birthday tomorrow. well- he checks his phone, it’s basically his birthday. sunday january 24th, 2021. he didn’t think he’d live this long. he was the answer to the universe now, technically. 42. he looks down at his hands on the wheel. they’re worn. they’re the hands of a tired man who fought multiple apocalypses, multiple archangels, god himself. and won.
“Phew,” God says, appearing behind Dean. When Dean turns, He’s sitting atop a series of boxes in a corner, pointedly away from the blood. “That’s uh, one… two… six. Wow, Dean. That’s a new record. Congrats.”
Dean walks away having memorized the number on the license plate. He slips into the impala and follows them out of the parking lot. They guide him to a suburban neighbourhood where the houses all look the same. Dean takes note of which house they park outside of and continues on. He finds a nearby motel several streets down, settles in and finds himself exhausted when he sits on the bed. He’s coming to realize that using words takes more out of him than the actual violence does. He rests his head against a pillow and dozes off, waking up nearly an hour later when a car’s horn blares in the distance. He gets up and decides to take a walk around the neighbourhood.
And yet, he can’t exactly go to a bar and score free drinks pretending to be a new FBI agent on his first case. He has responsibilities now, no matter how insignificant. Slacking on the team isn't going to keep his scholarship. He ends up at the boys locker room nearly an hour early and ends up changing into his uniform. As he’s tying his shoes, he hears the sound of a door opening.
Dad’s said it, you’ve said it. ‘Your sister is more of a man than you about this.’” Sam finishes with a mockery of John’s voice.
Her expression brightens and she slips her gloves off, wiping sweat from her forehead as she says, “that’s good. I can’t even imagine—” she stops herself. Her expression reveals she is unsure of how to finish that sentence.
Sam frowns, “I love you. You know that. You’re my big sister and everything you’ve done for me is always gonna mean the world to me. But, I can’t live like this. I’m too
He takes a deep breath, holding the box of donuts he’d bought against his side and finally knocks on the door. He hears a bit of shuffling behind the door before it opens a crack and he sees the familiar shade of blue appear.
Dean grunts at the words. They sting something in him, making him slowly lift himself up into a sitting position. He glares up at the blue eyes that regard him from the demon’s position in the chair. He sits there in the black peacoat, arms and legs crossed, watching Dean like he’s an exhibit at a zoo.
The man laughs at this, relaxing at Dean’s words, “yeah, well. Sometimes that’s for the best. Sometimes the ex-wife is a good for nothing slut that leaves you with the package for the weekend when she goes to whore out with her friends.”
Well. Dean can’t argue with that, really. He helps Cas toss the body around some bags. It doesn’t sit well with him, given he was taught to always get rid of any evidence, but, well. He looks over to Cas who’s now inspecting the area.
John Winchester dies on a Monday, at 2:36 PM. He leaves behind two children, a Deanna Winchester, whereabouts unknown, and a Samuel Winchester, currently in Palo Alto, California.
She crosses her arms and tilts her head curiously to the side. Dean turns away and reaches out to start dragging the corpse beneath one of the semis. When he’s successfully hidden the corpse, they both head inside the minimart. Dean buys her a bag of Doritos and a Mountain Dew. He gets himself a Snickers bar and one of those off-brand iced tea cans.
And every time, Dean stands over a corpse, his eyes vacant. He doesn’t take pleasure in killing. It was just a means to an end. He wipes the edge of his knife on the man’s shirt and reholsters it. His eyes flick upwards to the sky. He doesn’t have to speak anymore, he can wordlessly send a prayer and God will appear unto him.
The door to the motel slams open and Dean would be content to ignore it, but the voice that calls out to him makes him turn out of pure instinct that had been hammered into him when he was four years old.
“Yes, sir!” Dean calls back, never one to back down from a challenge, despite it making his head feel like it was going to explode. He starts crossing the field, praying that the universe grants him a mercy and his coach will stop screaming.
There’s a flirty smile on her face that jumps onto Dean’s when he responds with, “that’d make it a date, wouldn’t it?”
Dean takes a long sip, holding a hand out in explanation as he says, “y sí, vengo por ti. I’ve been looking into stuff and shit is getting big, Sammy. End of the world big.”
She pulls away, calming herself down as she wipes the blood from her mouth with the back of her shirt. The man staggers away, but Dean has already broken the distance. He’s quick enough that his knife goes in and out of the man’s gut cleanly. Now it’s the girl who watches from a distance as Dean holds the man against the side of the semi and plunges his knife in again. The lights go out in the man’s eyes and Dean looks up at the heavens.
“I’ve been… looking into stuff, since dad died—” Dean doesn’t get to finish his thought because Sam cuts him off.
Castiel doesn’t fight the small smile that creeps up on him. He ushers Jack out of the room, turning to give Dean a final look. Castiel wishes he could sit with him. But, he’s unsure if Dean would even want that.
“It’s not a bad thing, you know,” Sam says out loud. Castiel’s eyes flicker up to Sam and then back to Dean. Dean doesn’t look up at Sam.
Castiel regards him with a slow head tilt. He’s staring at Dean like he doesn’t recognize him. But Dean knows he does. Castiel has to. Dean’s black eyes glisten in the moonlight that pours through the window Sam is on the ground beneath as Castiel approaches him tentatively. His trenchcoat is torn and frayed and dirty at the edges.
The track shifts and his mind wanders, following the melody of the violins that mean to encompass the sea in their notes. He thinks of the man he saw all those nights ago in a motel room in Arkansas. The broken man on his knees, staring up at Castiel through blackened eyes. He doesn’t know what any of that meant.
“Hey, Cas,” Dean says. He doesn’t look up immediately. His fingers scratch at the tape grip of the fishing rod as a warmth comes through his chest. He missed Castiel, he missed him so much.
Bobby refuses to back down. Enough that Dean begins to wonder if… Bobby’s not just fucking with him?
Dean also turns to look over at Sam. The confused expression on his face validating what Castiel knows to be true about them.
He flicks the blade closed and sets it down. He stares at the little flecks of red collecting in spaces the blade didn’t cut deep enough. The rest of the blood drips down his stomach and his arm, leaving little trails that remind him of the blood he’s spilling for the debt he carries so tightly in his chest. Dean reaches over for the first aid kit. He bandages himself up and reaches for a shirt that had been tossed on the ground.
“Please,” Dean breathes out, taking the sides of the demon’s face in his hands. Dean leans in and presses a needy kiss to Logan’s mouth. His hands reach down to grab at the demon’s hands, bringing them up to Dean’s chest and Dean buries his head in the crook of Logan’s neck. Dean hears him chuckle.
“Oh, sweetheart,” comes Bobby Singer’s voice from above him. He feels a pair of arms pick him up by his sides and they set him on the bed, but they don’t let him go. He cries into Bobby’s chest, clutching at the wet shirt.
in that same breath. it brings him a sense of peace like he’s never fully properly known. because it’s about trust. and not trust in cas, not trust in himself, hell, the trust has nothing to do with either of them. it has to do with the fact that dean has finally let himself trust that things are going to be okay. that no matter what happens, he’s going to be okay.
As Dean crosses the parking lot, he notes a single other person out there. It’s another guy having a smoke. He’s relatively handsome with dark hair and a long dark peacoat. He stands out against the snow around them. Dean decides he doesn’t care if this man has committed any evil. He walks past this man, heading toward the side of the road.
a venir a mi casa después de siete pinches años, a meterte como un criminal, decirme que ya tiene un año que papá murió y luego todavía, para acabarla de chingar, me pides que me vaya al medio del pinche país contigo?”
The bandages go on quickly enough and his shirt is back on him when he opens the door, but a voice stops him in his tracks.
Dean’s lips twitch into a smile for a second before he runs his hands through his hair and says, “how long do we think you have? Before you get all vengeful spirit and I have to find out what’s keeping you here.”
He turns away, walking quickly and breaking into a sprint when he hears the car doors open. His breathing is frantic and he turns to shine the light at the chest of one. A silver bullet pierces the guy’s chest. He goes down. The other two break into a sprint.
“nope,” dean says without hesitation, “sammy, you died when you were twenty two. i died at twenty seven? twenty eight? god, i don’t even remember.”
Dean wakes up extremely groggy, feeling like he’s been hit by multiple trucks and then run over repeatedly by those same trucks. His body aches and his head pounds something fierce. He lies there for a while, breathing in and out of his nose, feeling that if he moves even an inch, his bones are going to shatter. After enough time, he opens his eyes and stares into the void that is the popcorn ceiling. When he gathers enough courage to move, he realizes he’s alone in the motel room.
Bobby looks up from the book then. A silence falls between them as Dean buries his face in his hands. He takes several more deep breaths.
Castiel turns to look at the back of Sam’s head. He detests that he really does understand. He understands the way in which the Winchesters operate. He knows Dean is willing to take the guillotine with a smile for his loved ones and he knows that Sam’s biggest grief against Dean is that Dean never understands that Sam is also willing to do the same without a second thought.
The wind is hot against his bare legs as he goes down the pitch black road with an empty backpack on his back. He looks around with a flashlight, trying to flag down cars. A shiver goes down his spine when an old yellow car pulls up just ahead of him. The car’s interior light comes on and he counts three heads. His breathing hitches as he forces every step toward the car.
seventeenth birthday and it ensues several passive aggressive comments that lead to John’s actively violent dismissal of hearing anything else. The impala would be Sam’s when he was old enough.
“You’re sure you haven’t seen this man?” it’s Sam. Dean’s memory blurs the memory of what Sam’s face looks like, but Dean can recognize his voice as if he’d spent time with Sam just recently.
Dean looks away as the instinctual feeling of shame catches up to him, despite Dean being a thousand miles away from reality.
“Keep it up, kid. You think you’re hot stuff right now that you’re young. All of these boys right here, they’re gonna end up in the MLB. You know what that stands for?”
Dean nods. He steps towards the door and gives Cas a pat on the shoulder as he steps out. It was just Dean’s luck. He
“Tell you what,” God says, a little smile appearing on His face, “this sort of thing doesn’t come cheap, even for me.” God crouches in front of Dean, the smile on His face getting bigger as He makes eye contact. He continues, “I’ll cut you a deal. Easy peasy. You bring me the bodies of a thousand evil men and I’ll bring you Castiel back. Yeah?”
He hears her bless a child and he thinks back to the child in the bunker. A little boy who can’t be older than six, raised by Sam and Mary Winchester. The little boy who’d asked Castiel what his name was and who’s eyes brightened when Sam introduced him. He thinks of the way the little boy wrapped himself around Castiel’s side, his little arms only barely coming around Castiel’s middle.
“Take care of your brother,” he says, “there’s something in him. Something I should have been able to catch. You might have to kill him,” John says as if it were the simplest thing in the world.
“If you want to run around the way you did all of last week, you need to build your strength up again. You’re not Sam, angel. You weren’t meant to be king.”
“Do you think there are more of them?” Dean asks as they round the corner back onto the street. It’s late enough that there isn’t anyone on foot around them.
Nearly two months later, they’ve all gotten courses. Castiel is fluent in all languages, so when Eileen approaches him with the intent, he gives her a smile and points at himself, and then taps at his chest with the back of his thumb with his hand open, indicating he’s fine. He watches her smile grow ten times bigger and then as she accosts Sam for not telling her.
A tension falls between them. Dean grips at the wheel of the impala tight enough that his knuckles pale. Sam watches his jaw clench and his mouth tightens into a straight line.
“I’m at a party. Whatever I drink, I take a sip and spill some for him. I’m top of my class, dad. Professor told me I’d make a hell of an archaeologist one day. If I can’t make you proud, I sure as hell can make Sam proud. Don’t call me back.”
“and we got out,” sam says. there’s a satisfaction in his voice that makes every single time dean died or did anything stupid for sam worth it. it’s a tone that dean knows means sam is happy. and that’s it, that was dean’s goal.
thirdly, i'll keep linking all the songs used in this fic at the end and if anyone is interested i could put them in a playlist. just let me know here or on
He wakes up at dawn. Emily is motionless on her bed, fast asleep as Dean steps into the bathroom for a quick final shower. He towels his hair and gets dressed just as quickly. He ties the shoelaces of his boots and looks over to the lump in her bed. Something twitches inside of him and he’s not entirely sure he recognizes the feeling anymore.
Dean turns to look at Him. God walks over to him and something inside Dean twists. It’s an odd sensation. Something Dean can process as want, but it’s not want in the carnal sense. It’s a want that manifests differently. A want that’s satisfied when God puts his hand on the side of Dean’s face and says very earnestly, “that’s a good boy, Dean.” And then vanishes.
“Oh,” Dean says, “well, you know, same old same old. I’ve been hunting alone. I uh, ran into some vampires. A whole nest of ‘em. They live off of animal blood. I couldn’t— They were good people. One of them worked in a hospital, the other was a trash man, Sam. Can you believe that? I didn’t— I had
And that’s when he points and shoots. The man goes down, a clean confirmed kill. Dean’s hands shake as he puts his gun away. He’s at a distance from the body, far enough that he can feel like he’s not directly responsible for this, for the betrayal of everything he grew up believing. He takes a deep shaky breath and looks up at the sky again.
“Let go of me, you freak! What the fuck is wrong with you!?” she yells, trying to pull away still. Dean hopes it's enough of a show.
He’d stood, shorter than John, but with the same bravado that he always carried with him, and told his father that he and Sam were doing their best. That it wasn’t fair, the way John treated them. John hadn’t been drinking. Dean tells himself that John had been, but he hadn’t been when John shoved him backwards so Dean’s back hit the rearview mirror of the impala at an awkward angle. Dean’s breathing hitched as John walked up threateningly close and told Dean that he owed everything that he was to John, to the way he’d cared for them.
“No can do, girl,” and Dean winks. He’s just really good at this. She laughs in response and pats him on the chest, the unspoken ‘atta boy’ understood as she heads over toward the girls’ locker rooms and he follows the guys toward the opposite side of the field, where the boys’ locker rooms were.
“On it, boss,” Dean says with another grin that’s meant to be inciting. It doesn’t get anything out of Cas. Dean looks back at the pink box he’d brought with him and adds, “you can keep those.”
“You do enough partying, son, you can conga line your way right off of this team,” his coach says, staring at him with a look Dean would see on John’s face when Dean was learning to shoot and missed a shot.
“right, right. something about how my eyes glitter like the moon?” dean asks, his tone is still jokey.
“From the alley?!” Another voice from behind Cas calls as Cas steps away to open the door more fully. Dean’s smile falters a little bit. Cas had a roommate.
Dean eats in relative peace after that. The diner is mostly empty, what with the holiday giving people a reason to be with one another or alone in their homes. The people that tend to flock to places like this at these times are people who have reached rock bottom or people like John Winchester.
So, that is the impasse they’ve remained at. It’s significantly better than the comatose man they’d had lying in the bunker for two weeks, but there is still a long road ahead. Castiel’s eyes trace the edge of Dean’s jaw, watching the way his lips move as he mouths the things he’s saying to Eileen with his hands. Castiel is not the best lip reader and he doesn’t like to intrude, so he doesn’t watch what movements their hands make.
“Whoever pulled you from hell, angel. Their grace left a signature, a stench all over you. One that you can’t scrub away.”
That’s gotta be where the new identity comes from. Sam waits again, the sinking feeling in his chest not getting any better, but not worsening.
“You got a name, then?” Bobby asks in response. “Cindy’d been born somethin’ other than Cindy, I reckon.”
“Sam, you can’t go to college. How the hell are we going to pay for any of that? What about dad? What about
Dean purses his lips together in a tight line. He takes a second, reasoning it with himself, and then nods at the ground. Sam watches all of this and is about to rush him when he looks up at Sam and with a special Winchester-brand intensity says, “dad’s dead.”
“thank you,” he chokes out, voice breaking because he’s started crying again, “i... i don’t have heaven. but i love you with the power of a guy who fought god.”
After he slips it on, he steps outside and wordlessly finds his boots. He grabs the set of keys, rather the weird plastic square needed to turn the car he had outside on, and he’s out the door.
Dean stops, then. Because, yes, of course. He remembers the mark of Cain. He taps, or tries to, tap into the ease and grace that he killed the entire Styne family with when he goes after his marks. It’s gotten easier as time has gone by, but there’s an ache in his chest that follows him everywhere he goes. It’s a deep hurt, a longing. A love that he can’t shake.
The next year passes and Sam leaves for Stanford. Fucking Stanford. Sam Winchester with his brown skin, his Mexican birth certificate, and his will to do good, headed for fucking Stanford University. It should make his older brother ridiculously proud. It doesn’t. They’re standing in the motel parking lot in the rain.
Dean doesn’t respond to them. He stares forward at Castiel. His expression is unreadable and there’s a sadness in his eyes that Castiel only ever recalls seeing in the aftermath of Dean losing his brother.
He drives through the woods that lead up to the house, finding himself on a highway soon enough. His foot presses down on the gas pedal and the car responds to his touch, the needle on the speedometer going to 80, 90, 100. The cars around him are passed in a haze and he’s unsure when he decides to come to slow exit somewhere. It’s away from the house. Away from everything.
Dean grins and nods as his coach steps out into the field and calls the practise session over. They’re to be back here next week, ready to run the mile again. Two boys about Dean’s age approach him.
The words sucker punch Sam, enough that he staggers back, hand out to hold himself up against Jess’ car. Jess is at his side in a second. His world is out of focus for a second and he takes a deep breath. He grounds himself to the moment, just the way he would if he was hunting a monster, and he asks, “what was it?”
“i have a speech prepared for you,” cas says softly. his hands tap at dean’s stomach and dean brings up his own hands to cover them.
Dean stares up at him with an expression that breaks Castiel’s heart. It’s an apology, a plea, a confession, and the ever present self-loathing that Dean Winchester is famous for. It’s everything Castiel has ever loved.
“something like that,” cas says, “and moreso how you’ve been the world’s lifeline and how i’m so happy you’re finally thinking of yourself.”
“No te pongas de pinche sangrón,” Dean responds, his expression falling into annoyance again. And Sam scoffs, because again, Dean is being ridiculous and here he is asking
Time has passed since Dean confessed in the middle of an already tense conversation from behind his brother’s back, his hand coming up to say, very simply with three fingers: I love you. It’s been months now, that Dean will stand in the doorway of Castiel’s room, looking smaller than he is and ask Castiel to sit with him as he falls asleep. It’s time enough that Castiel has all but memorized the pattern in which Dean inhales and exhales when he’s asleep. He’s also noted that Dean’s head seems to fit perfectly in the crook of Castiel’s shoulder.
“No,” Logan says, crossing his arms. And that’s all Dean needs to hear. He crosses the distance in a second and the demon is pressed against the wall under threat of one of Dean’s knives.
The heel of Dean’s boot comes to rest on this man’s neck. He applies enough pressure to keep him from moving. The man coughs underneath Dean’s shoe, attempting to grab at Dean’s ankle to get him off. Dean pulls his gun instead. The man begins flailing desperately, trying to shove away from Dean.
God chuckles and sticks His hands in the pockets of His jeans. He walks around, past Dean, and over to the body.
“In a few hours,” he says, looking up at Dean again. Dean looks up at the clock and looks back with the smile he’d give a pretty girl.
Unfortunately for Dean, nobody currently in the diner matches that MO. He finishes his coffee and leaves a hundred dollar bill on the table as he grabs his duffel bag from underneath the table and heads out. He doesn’t have change.
Dean frowns now. He figures that answered his question enough. He shakes his head, giving Sam a dirty look before his little brother vanishes again, “forget it, Cas. You didn’t answer my question earlier. Is Cas short for something?”
And Dean looks up at him, mouth agape in the face of the salvation he’s found. But, it’s neither salvation nor righteousness that kneels down in front of him. There’s no telling what Castiel is thinking. Dean watches Castiel’s hands shake as the angel kneels down on the opposite side of the corpse. Dean shudders at the touch of Castiel’s hand when it reaches up to gently hold Dean’s jaw. The angel’s touch is hot, scalding on his skin. And Dean laughs.
Dean puts a hand on her shoulder as he passes by her to look through the passenger side window. It’s a guy who looks like he’s on his way home from an office job. Dean considers it safe and reaches to open the backseat door for her.
and secondly, i've also decided that this is gonna still be the 3 chapter story up until season 5, and then there'll be two epilogues. 12x01 and a lebanon rewrite.
Sam looks over at Jess, because she’s stepped into the room again. She crosses and goes to sit at the couch across from Sam and Dean. Sam takes a deep breath. He hates Dean for putting him into this position.
It’s four months since John’s left, since the last of his family has finally abandoned him, and he’s lying on the ground of a shitty motel room in a fetal position, crying into the dirty maroon carpet as a soft Spanish guitar plays around him from a radio.
And he tenses, because it’s out of his mouth already. He could double down or he could ask Bobby to forget it ever happened, but that would ensue weird looks. He can’t handle that. He has to know if Bobby would still care for him. He lived in the doubt long enough. If Bobby hates him for this, then Bobby hates him for this.
It’s taken Dean a very long time to resemble what he looked like before everything. As the weeks have turned into months, Dean has regained enough weight to shake the look of malnutrition and is mostly a recovering anemic. The light has returned to his eyes, even if his voice has not. It’s been slow progress and they’ve had their setbacks. They understand that Dean’s problem is at its core, an addiction. Castiel and Sam have watched him attempt to fill the subconscious want with everything from sweets and caffeine to the incessant picking at the scars on his arms. Castiel has since brought up healing Dean of the physical representations of the ache he carries with him, but Dean has never once consented to it.
He’s about a month away from being 18 when a boy slips him his phone number. It’s the weekend and they’ve been in town long enough that he’s gotten to know this boy well enough to know what high school he goes to. The number’s scribbled out on a napkin that gets put down with his coffee mug, careful to not go seen by John, given the three of them are sitting at the diner table. John’s reading through a newspaper and Sam is fiddling with a broken EMF reader.
Dean picks up his bag from the ground beside the desk he sits at and makes a beeline for the door. The professor doesn’t say a thing, nobody does. He loves college sometimes.
“Yeah, yeah, ‘course,” Dean says with a forced grin, “it’s just, you know. Shit’s never been simple with us, huh?” and if Sam doesn’t know that.
Dean doesn’t answer him. He can’t, can he? He opens his mouth, trying to form words to give Sam a coherent explanation, but he can’t find the right ones. Instead he shuts his mouth, opting to rub at his eyes.
to a degree. It unfortunately never negated his attraction to men, but he never considered that a problem until he realized that also made him
“I know, I know. It’s why I’d be so appreciative. I won’t tell a soul. Tell you what, you help me find my friend, and I can stop by later. When are you off?” Dean says with a wink.
They’ve been exchanging that smile for months and it’s mostly for fun, Dean thinks. He’s never seen Anna really smile at anyone that wasn’t another woman. She smiles at Dean in the way he’d want to be smiled at, he’s pretty sure. He’d never make a move on her anyway. She was too close to him. He’d hate to lose a shoulder to lean on during linguistics tests.
John had never really raised a hand to them, not in a way that counts, he thinks. Not the way he remembers seeing kids his age treated in the time they lived in Mexico. Hell, he remembers being there to help one of his friends get her father off of her mother. John never treated him or Sam like that. He’d been smacked around as had Sam, but it was never that bad.
Dean stumbles, falling to his knees beside the dirty bathtub. He pants, getting his bearings again before he reaches for the water knobs and runs himself the most scalding bath imaginable given he can’t bring himself to reach out all the way and reach the cold water knob for longer than a couple of seconds. His arms ache to maneuver around himself and completely strip, but he manages. Then, with an ungraceful movement and a final gust of strength he hauls himself upward and falls into the tub. Water splashes violently around him and creates a thin layer of water on the tile outside, but he’s not particularly bothered by that.
Dean sets his duffel bag down on one of them, digging through it for the black kit he carries. It’s been too long. He needs more.
He hears a cough and snaps back into reality, making eye contact with Zach and tapping his right thigh and signing a one, a two, a three and a one again. Zach gives him the slightest nod and the ball goes off a second later. Dean watches the bat hit the ball, he watches Anna scramble past second to grab the ball, tossing it to Isaac on third, too late. Isaac flings it in Dean’s direction. Dean’s already up to catch it. A perfect play.
Sam tries to sleep for twenty minutes to no avail. His mind keeps racing back to the situation at hand. When he gives up, he turns his head so he can look at Dean’s side profile.
“Awesome,” God says with a laugh, standing all the way up. “You just let me know when you’ve got the first one and we’ll start tallying them up.” God vanishes.
“Almost didn’t recognize you. I like the beard,” this demon says, giving Dean an easy grin. “You’re a hard man to find, you know that?”
“I think so, yeah. I’m not a figment of your imagination, I don’t think,” Sam says. He stands and looks around at the apartment, “I don’t think I’d tell you that I think your space is disgusting.”
“Do you need any help? I’m good with lore… or a fight,” Dean says with the smile he’d use on a pretty girl. It’s his most convincing smile and he’d be lying if he said the thought of going on a hunt didn’t excite him.
“the-” jack stops short, looking behind dean. and dean realizes the missing piece of his birthday puzzle has to be behind him.
the thought of turning the bunker’s lights out for good makes dean feel a certain kind of way. still, though. now it’s a thought that’s popped into his head. who knows.
Dean ignores the response. He’s already fished the kit out of his duffel bag and is moving over to take a seat against the bed’s headboard. The process is nearly second nature by now. He’s put another dose in himself as quickly as he ever has. It no longer gives him the euphoric rush, but more so puts air in his lungs.
After he dunks his hair in enough water to rinse the soap out, he tilts his head upwards and lets it run down the front of his face for a second, letting his hair stick over his shut eyes. He takes several deep breaths.
They’d spoken English with John inside their house, but he’d been so used to hearing the general public speak Spanish and having everything be in Spanish, that having to be forced to learn to properly read English was jarring for the first few years. He’s nearly twenty two and only certain words are spoken with an accent now. His hunting notes are still written in Spanish. He can read English fine, but it takes his mind a few extra seconds to process the words. Sam picked up English better. His notes are in English, despite his fluency in Spanish.
Dean’s body relaxes. And his breathing is shallow, but, through what Castiel can only call a miracle, Dean’s eyes flutter open. He doesn’t speak, but his eyes are his own. It fuels the sliver of hope that Castiel had been holding onto.
They get through some batting for a few minutes before the rest of the team starts showing up, their coach at the end.
When he pulls over at a motel, he goes through the check-in motions like he usually would. There’s no difference in Dean’s easy grin when the woman behind the desk gives him the key to the room. No difference in the way he asks her about her day, casual and vaguely flirty. It’s like he hasn’t done anything any different.
“I’m… up?” it doesn’t make much sense. They were off of the side of the road somewhere. What did this have to do with the hunt?
“He enjoys watching television in the room you set up for yourself. Sam says he’ll teach him how to play... foosedball when Jack is tall enough to look over the table,” Castiel says, a small smile resting on his face as he watches Dean.
Dean frowns at the guy, but he’s really not in the mood to argue with some random he’s never gonna see again. He’s got to live it up for Sam. It is his little brother’s birthday. He gives the guy a final, judging expression, and heads back inside.
Dean laughs, turning to look down at the ground as embarrassment creeps up his stomach and into his face. He looks back at Sam and says, “I left, Sam. After you, you know. I…”
“you know sam loves you, you know your friends love you. you know that i love you with the wrath of heaven behind me. and somehow that doesn’t compare to the happiness i feel now that i know that you finally love you.”
“Dean,” Sam says as he reaches out to put his hands on the sides of Dean’s shoulders. Dean lets him. “Let’s go home. Let’s get you to a bed, okay? We don’t have to talk about Cas—”
He lets his head rest against the headboard. He inhales deeply and exhales slowly. His eyes open over black again. They don’t change back when he blinks.
He hears Bobby’s question and he has an answer for him, but he can’t make out words and thoughts over the sound of his tears. He wraps himself around Bobby, eyes staining Bobby’s shirt again.
Dean shuts his eyes. Just thinking about it makes his blood boil. John had the nerve to be calm. His youngest son, full of promise, had been killed in front of them both and John had the audacity to not react. Dean had been a mess, sobbing into Sam’s chest. And John just stood there. Calm.
He takes a step forward into it, reaching for the silver pocket knife he keeps. If it’s a vampire, it wouldn’t be the first time he’s had to wrestle one down. His steps are careful, trained. Sam is behind him, and while it doesn't help his situation, it helps his motivation.
to be calm? Dean continues, “nomas es un viajecito. De volada. Vamos, que tío Bobby te explique que onda y te traigo de vuelta.”
“No mames, Dea-” the knee presses further into Sam’s gut before he can finish. He groans and she climbs off of him.
Before Dean can think about it for too long, he’s directed to a door that’s undecorated. Both the bathroom and this guy, who Dean now knows is named Josiah, have large signs indicating what’s behind the door. Inside, Cas’ room is simple. It’s got a bed with blue sheets, a mirror, a dresser, a desk and a corkboard with several newspaper clippings surrounding disappearances around the university area. There it is.
The demon has more things to say, but Dean drowns them out with the sound of blood pumping in his ears as he heads out.
“What’s me being a hitchhiker got to do with a hunt?” A feeling sinks deep in his stomach, as if this is what would happen were he to try to tell John anything.
“Ew, what the fuck!” she says, pushing at Dean at an angle. He moves over with the force in her push and he reaches for her arm. He catches her wrist and she tries pulling away to no avail.
“Oh, give the man a break. He’s clearly hungover!” The other, a boy with light brown hair at about his shoulders and striking grey eyes yells, laughing at Dean’s discomfort.
“No thanks to you, Zach,” Dean says with a laugh in response, “you practically threw her in my lap.”
Dean shuffles around, realizing he’s cornered himself and he sighs. He confesses, “my brother would have been eighteen yesterday. I had to have a drink for him.”
“What the fuck do you mean?” Dean snaps back. A heavy weight sinks in his chest. “You asked for evil men, what the fuck is a vampire?”
“Okay,” Sam says. He gives her a grin, “apparently Dad left some stuff back home that we have to go claim.” His heart sinks into his chest as the lie comes out of his mouth as softly as any loving words would.
When Dean feels a slick hand trace a pattern up his thigh, he goes slack against the pressures that follow. His mouth hangs open and he finds peace in the patterns his exalted vision creates in the ceiling as the demon rocks against him. The warmth that pools in Dean’s stomach threatens to burn his insides. The excess warmth spreads through his entire body, making Dean’s vision blackout in waves. He pants, unaware of the soft noises coming from his throat.
dean turns back and pulls jack forward to pull him into a better hug as he laughs. that’s somehow the craziest thing he’s ever heard.
No response. He frowns. He grips at the thin little slab of silver that he has dangling around his neck, the one that’s sawed down ever so slightly at the bottom, as he walks over toward the entrance.
“Right, okay. Then, I’m still completely in the fucking dark as to why you were a girl the last time I saw you?”
So, when he comes to the sight of the woman pressed against the wall, her sweater rumpled up part of her torso as this man tries to have his way with her, Dean thinks it's ironic. That he’s spent all of his life up until now, hunting monsters, or rather, supernatural creatures, and the real monsters were always sitting beside him. Were he a different kind of person, it would be very funny.
His head jerks up from the puzzle cube he’s fiddling with. That’s not— He should? Uh. He gets up regardless, awkwardly heading over to the receptionist’s desk despite nobody batting an eyelash. He’s in Tucson, Arizona, the dark skinned woman behind the desk has pronounced his last name as, “Ween-ches-ter,” and somehow the missing part of his first name is what strikes him.
for now, he’s content to stand there with his angel, looking out at the other backyards, at the stars while their respective kids sleep in the house.
“You’re doing so good, Dean. You’re making me so proud,” He says in a soft voice. Dean’s expression shifts into one of reverence. His eyes flutter shut and he revels in God’s touch before it disappears completely, leaving him feeling hollow and cold. His face tilts forward a fruitless attempt to chase the divine, but God has already left him.
Tania? That was the fifth hunter this year. Still, the way John had just replaced him bothered him more than it should have. It was logical and he knew this, but, it didn’t stop him from using it as the jumping off point of anger as he heard the message end and the final beep.
The next day Dean’s got his best wool sweater on and is tracking down a business major. He’d heard these kinds of people were all sorts of messy. He steps into the air conditioned office and greets the student worker behind the desk. It’s a gangly looking guy with dark brown eyes.
Sam rounds the corner in the dim light, arms out to grab at the burglar, but there’s nobody there. Sam turns around, prepared to go back the way he came when he feels his feet get snuck out from under him and he lands flat on his back with a knee pressed into his stomach.
The guard is able to connect Bobby with a licensed medical professional that’s willing to do a favour for them. It’s got to be the worst thing Dean’s experienced thus far. At least on a physical level. He spends so much time in bed. So much. After two days he’s sick and tired of lying around, but even moving around makes him ache. It doesn’t help that Bobby refuses to baby him.
“Mom just really liked the name. Dad begged her to give me something else,” Sam says with a laugh as he turns to stuff socks into the bag. He hates lying to her. He hates having to exist as this person.
Castiel continues, “he’s heard a lot about you. We’ve told him how you’re one of the strongest men we know. He thinks you’re very brave.”
“Demons can do many things. They make deals with students down on their luck, for love, for anything.”
“You should hold off, angel,” Logan says from his spot at the other bed. “If your brother’s anything like you, he’s probably not too far behind.”
Dean frowns, “that’s… I don’t think those are signs of demon deals… who’d sell their soul for something like that?”
not a weirdo except for the fact that you don’t talk. I’ve tagged along with you for nearly a month now and all you’ve done thus far is kill paedophiles. You also knew how to kill an entire nest of vampires all by yourself. And you’ve introduced me to
, like embarrassing 15 year olds. he’s taken cas to the movies, they’ve gone for walks at the mall. dean held cas’ hand under a tree and it was the most incredible thing in the world.
A quick shower later, he’s staring at himself in the mirror again. He’s slipped a belt into his jeans and is only missing a shirt. His eyes are widened, less sunken and there’s a look of malformed determination on his face.
The eighth day comes and Dean slams the door of the motel room behind him when he gets back from taking another aimless walk around the neighbourhood. He clambers into the bed, straddling the demon sitting there, knocking the magazine out of his hands.
He sits on an empty park bench and stares out over the field of grass as the earbuds Sam let him borrow play him tracks from the 1940’s. It’s a curated mix Castiel found on a music application. It helps with Castiel’s newly found aversion to silence.
“Okay,” God says, from behind him, “you know, you really walk the line between playing fair and cheating with this, Dean. I don’t know if any more of these’ll cut it.”
“You should eat something,” comes the demon’s unnervingly soft voice after a few seconds of silence.
He’s fourteen the first time it happens. And he’s never really had an issue with this sort of thing, because his mother had decided to name him after a woman she’d seen in a movie, a Deanna Hargreeves, and he’d only spent nine years in Mexico as their father arranged for visas so they could move back to the United States. So his name was never really an issue after they’d left the titular city.
They walk down the side of the road together. She talks to him about her family, her real family, not the vampire nest that was going to kill her. And Dean listens. She already knows he isn’t one for words, so she’s happy to fill the silence. She is, after all, a child. Dean is grateful for the timbre of her voice. It’s enough of a distraction from the thoughts he holds at bay that he can focus on how, yes, her real mother was an absolute bitch. Why shouldn’t Emily have gone out with her friends on her birthday?
As he and Sam get older, more things outside of themselves change. He’s sitting in a diner with his father at three in the morning, after another successful vampire hunt, a sloppy burger going down both of their throats. It’s the best thing he’s ever had, he thinks. There’s a trickle of ketchup going down the side of his mouth that John points out.
“I know. Family is all we’ve got and I’m throwing it away, I know. Ya me lo has cantado no se cuantas veces.”
“You’re spending the night, then?” Jess asks. She sets her coffee down on the table between them, “we’ve got extra blankets.”
“I was unsure if this would be something you wanted, but Jack wanted to meet you,” Castiel says. Dean doesn’t move nor respond.
“Hey,” he says shakily. One of the men inside eyes him up and down. It makes his knees lock outside the door.
Dean takes a deep breath as the air stills around him. The edges of his vision are hazy and he takes several seconds to catch his breath. He looks down at the gore and carnage around him. Heads lie malfigured from the impact of their fall in several directions. There’s a severed arm that’s currently pooling blood around his boots, its fingers curled inward. He kicks it aside, sending blood spilling in a different direction. His eyes look up toward a window.
It takes Dean a week to get around to showing up at Cas’ place. He’s not entirely sure why it took him that long, or he does, and he just doesn’t want to talk about it. He’s been thinking about Lot A for the past week, going as far as missing an assignment that was due because he’d spend more time researching demons. He calculated his grade and he’ll be fine, but he really hasn’t stopped thinking about demons and the way Cas looked when the demon fell to the ground.
“Heya, handsome,” she says with a practised tone. She gives him a once over and frowns when she notes his boots are in his hands.
“I love you, too,” Castiel says. His voice is shaky, nervous. Had this been any other circumstance, he’d have laughed at himself. He was a creature born on the second day of creation. He’d seen war and death in every way possible, all the glorious and terrible periods of human history. And it was Dean Winchester and his wide, sunken eyes that made Castiel weak.
“Yeah,” she responds. Her body tenses enough for Castiel to notice. Her eyes flicker to the ground for a second before she looks up at him and asks, “can I ask you something?”
Sam wants answers, Mary wants answers, Castiel wants answers, but Dean was essentially comatose. He had been for the past two weeks, since the moment he stopped screaming. They had no idea if and when he was ever going to wake up.
He’s been out of the hunting life for a little over a year now and he’s been navigating the shift into becoming a respectable member of society fairly well. He brushes his teeth every morning, procrastinates his assignments, does his readings, and every now and then he’ll check if the salt lines he’s set at the windows are still there.
Dean wakes up groggy, having slept way too long. But, it’s his off day. He stays in bed half asleep, eyes shut and thinking about the stupid essay he has to finish. Maybe he can get Sam to—. Dean’s eyes burst open and he sits up with a speed learned from years of running out of hotels. He looks to his right, over to meet his little brother’s hazel eyes.
Dean’s thoughts get put back on the back burner when he feels he’s being watched. His eyes open and he’s met with a familiar pretty face.
Their father was a monster. There really was no sugar coating that, not anymore. Dean loved the man more than he’d ever loved anything. But, that didn’t change the reality of it. Sam has no memories of going without eating, because Dean never allowed it. Sam has no recollection of the time Dean tried standing up to their father. Sam had been at school, 17 at the time, and Dean had had enough of their father’s patronizing. It was the most scared Dean has ever felt in his life, and he’s had his soul scraped raw by demons in hell.
“Guess so,” she says with a smirk, hands on her waist. Isaac and Zach raise their eyebrows at Dean. Dean shakes his head.
Inside his apartment, it looks like a man lives there. There are clothes thrown about everywhere, candy wrappers, and the occasional textbook decorating the embodiment of the modern day ‘man cave.’ He slips into his bed and falls onto his back with a bit of a smile. At his bedside table, he turns to look over at a photo frame of two young boys. One’s funny looking, his features yet to grow into his face. The other is just very small, the bright smile on his face indicating the promise of what could have been.
He considers the thought, opting to wonder what colour his life would be tinted with, were lives tinted with colour. A green, perhaps. A green when he first came to Earth. A green that manifested when he first laid eyes on Dean Winchester in hell. A soft, unintrusive colour that Castiel never had a chance to question, because there is no colour in heaven.
“I broke the TV in our hotel room, I tried ripping the carpet out. Dad just sat there. I don’t think anything has ever made me angrier. I had to be there, the only one who could even
He’s the one that turns to go. He leaves his little brother, nose bloodied by their father, in the parking lot of the shitty motel they’re currently staying at.
“I got a daughter, too. Ex-wife won’t let me see her,” Dean says cooly. “Just breaks my heart to see little ones go unspoiled.”
remember that the mark of Cain had made managing those feelings easier when it was about sating his need for violence.
“You gotta be careful with them, though,” Zach says with a grin, “they’ll kill you if they find out you’re there and not in the frat.”
“I’m sorry,” Dean says after nearly twenty minutes of comfortable silence. His voice is low and awfully heavy with lack of use, and it almost doesn’t sound like Dean. It happens so quickly that Castiel is almost sure he’s imagined it. He stares up at the stars they’re sitting under for an awkward moment, realizing he has to try, even if he did imagine Dean speaking to him. Castiel looks down at the top of Dean’s head.
“Sorry, chica,” Dean cuts in from behind, “promise I’ll take care of him. Bring him back safe by the end of the week.”
Dean shrugs off his jacket and hoists his sleeve up enough past the scars from previous injections to reveal his elbow as he takes a seat on the bed. The needle is actually the most difficult part. Dean doesn’t have the patience to keep the air bubbles out properly so he spends much longer on it than he should, injecting the liquid back into the bottle to start over as his fingers get steadily clumsier and his palms get unpleasantly damp.
“You know you have to go get him,” Bobby comments, digging through a book in front of him for any explanation for what may be kidnapping the kids.
“Pinche joto,” he says with a cackle. His voice reaches a higher pitch as Sam smacks the back of his head. Sam deserves it, though. He’s eight years old and has already seen a real ghost, so the dark shouldn’t scare him. Sam is the so called
if anyone didn't fully catch that last thing dean said to sam in spanish and didn't put it into google translate, the phrase essentially means, "
“I’ll get coffee on!” Jess calls from behind them, detouring into the kitchen as Sam leads Dean into the living room. He flicks a lamp on and gets a good look at him. It’s… a very good cover. His face isn’t as soft as Sam remembers it and he’s wearing maybe two shirts underneath a plaid flannel and John’s leather jacket. It seems to swallow him completely, but at the same time give him the right presence. Sam
it's roughly 11 PM on january 23rd when dean gets a call from eileen. he'd been out of the bunker with jack and cas for nearly three days; they'd taken jack to an amusement park. something about never seeing one before which reminded dean the last time he'd ever been to one, he was three years old and didn't remember a thing. which was fine, except that jack had wanted to go to
Yeah, Dean’s looking healthy alright. Sam’s listening to the words and superficially, he understands the concepts discussed, but he also doesn’t understand what’s being said. He’s sitting across from someone who used to be his older sister, now referring to themselves as his older brother, who’s come to tell Sam that their father is not only dead, but also in hell, because he sold his soul.

“no, actually. i wanted to do it tomorrow morning. show up at the bunker with everyone, but, i know someone with worse intentions than me who said that tricking you into coming here at the moment of your birthday would be something you couldn’t see coming,” sam opens his arms and dean lets himself fall in. he hugs his little brother back and the emotions from earlier come back. he and sam were alive. dean’s greatest achievement in life was keeping sam alive and now here he was, reaping the benefits.

Dean can ignore it at times, for long periods of time, even, but when he’s sitting alone in another damp motel room, suffocating on the stillness and the illusion of time soaked with blood, the tension in his stomach manages to rise into his throat. It chokes him as it expels from his pores, his eyes, his mouth, threatening to overtake him in his entirety. And Dean has no way of fighting back. He can only sit there and shake violently at the sobs that rack through him, at the tears that come until they can no longer fall.
“dean!” she says, visibly excited. dean smiles at her and waves, unsure why she’d be so excited that he’s here at midnight to fix her bathtub. she reaches out to grab his wrist and pull him into the house. she leads him through dark down the little hall that dean knows leads into the bathroom. dean notices there is no humidity in the house.
