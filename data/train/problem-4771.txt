“Oh thank God! Nat, I don't know where I am, those guys you talked about, HYDRA has me in some kind of facility.”
“You see him, take a good look. That is nothing compared to what we will do to you unless you tell me where Tony is.” Steve's voice was cool as ice when he spoke and Brock felt a shiver run up his spine. Not wanting to end up worse than his companion he spoke.
Tony couldn't care less and instead took lung filling breaths while attempting to ignore the other man who was currently violating him.
Small chapter because I had the time and inspiration for it! Note to self, writing is a great coping mechanism.
What he really meant was “This is my fault for dragging him into this and I don't want to let him out of my sight ever again” but it went unsaid.
“You mean those two gentlemen who have been going in and out of the basement that mr Stark told us to stay away from? Oh, Edwin, those two give me a bad feeling. And what could they possibly do in the basement day in and day out?” Jarvis frowned at his wife's words, not very happy at the fact that two thugs were making her feel unsafe in her own home.
Steve let go of the right nipple with a wet pop and gave the same treatment to the other one. As he was distracted, Tony took the opportunity to flip them over so that he was once again straddling his lover. Tony struggled for a second remove his pants and underwear, his socks and shoes along with them. He then proceeded to kiss his way down Steve’s chest all the way to his groin. Tony locked eyes with Steve and managed to drag the zip of Steve’s pants down with his teeth which caused the older of the two to let out a low groan. He then dragged Steve's own pants and underwear down, his hands sliding down the blonde’s perfect ass on the way. As Tony tossed the pants on the floor Steve let out a moan at the feeling of his cock hitting the cool air. Tony wasted no time and went down on his hands and knees took the entire length into his mouth. Steve let out a gasp and threw his head back against the pillow while trying not to rut his hips up in the wet heat that surrounded him.
"Bruce, what the hell!?" Tony exclaimed with wide eyes, looking around the room and swing more unknown people in the small room.
Steve's eyes widened in realization and licked his drying lips. He watched with lust filled eyes as Tony reached behind himself and let out a long moan. Tony had two fingers pumping in and out of himself when he leaned back down and reattached his mouth to Steve’s erect cock. Steve groaned at the sight and feeling of his sweetheart sucking his cock while prepping himself, giving Steve a great view of his ass. Tony groaned a little louder but tried not to lose his rhythm when he inserted a third finger.
Sorry for not updating for a while! I have been on vacation with my family and haven't had time to write anything but now I can! Hope you like this chapter!
Steve laughed at the statement before getting to work. He rolled Tony over so that he was on all fours before opening the bottle and coating his fingers with the substance.
Now Tony attempted ho heave himself up on the dirty mattress but was unable to do so when his vision whitened from the pain. Instead he settled with pulling the thin blanket down and tried to cover himself as much as possible to keep the cold out, or as much as he could with a most likely broken arm. He knew it was in vain when he hoped that they would spare him or at least go easy on him for a couple of days just so that he would have time to heal.
‘Perhaps the project mr Stark and his companions are working on is more sensitive then he mentioned?’ Jarvis thought. But that did little to subdue the growing feeling of unease that had taken place in his stomach, especially since mr Stark had only gone down once after the first day the men had entered his home.
By the end of the speech both men had tears running down their faces. Tony buried his face in Steve's neck and clutched him tight, like he was afraid that he would disappear if he let go. Steve held him just as tight.
But it was pointless since he had nowhere to go because the door was still locked. Rumlow had grabbed his arms and was pinning him to the dirty mattress while Tiberius was kneeling beside him.
“It's okay Bruce. We're all worried and gonna say things we don't mean. Tony is one of us now and we protect our own.”
Alright guys! Here is a quick note about the sequel. Since I have a break this upcoming week I was planning on starting the sequel. Unfortunately you may have heard of the terror attack and shootings in Stockholm, Sweden that occurred today. I live very close to where the attack occurred, just twenty minutes away and some of my friends and family witnessed the whole thing. Fortunately nobody I knew was harmed physically, but I'm worried about their mental state. I am pretty shaken up but hopefully will be able to start writing, just maybe not as soon as I had hoped. #PrayForStockholm
Tony looked back up at the two and felt tears well up in his own eyes. His lips wobbled and he hugged them both as tight as he could. The guilt was overwhelming and he was starting to shake.
If you have watched NBC's "Hannibal" you will probably remember the scene where my son Will bit off Cordell's cheek and then having his mouth/chin covered in blood, that is kind of how I imagined Tony doing it and looking afterwards. XD
“Oh my God, Anthony! What have they done to you? Oh, my poor sweet boy, it's going to be alright now, I promise. Captain Rogers and the rest of his team are planning a rescue mission for you, darling.” she hurried to comfort him.
When he opened it he was greeted by two pairs of arms being wrapped around him. The people who were holding him were yelling at him over eachother and he couldn't help but to grin and hug them back.
And just to add, since this fic contains a lot of rape/non-con I just want you all to remember that rape and sexually assault is nothing to joke about. There is nothing funny about it and it ruines hundreds and maybe even thousands of lives all the time, every day. If you ever have been sexually assaulted or know someone who has, just remember IT IS NEVER THE VICTIMS FAULT! If you ever feel like you need to talk about it then do it, whether it's with a parent, police, psychiatrist or a friend etc, just know that you are not alone. And of you ever want to talk to me you are more than welcome to drop a message to me on tumblr ( anthony-e-stark-3000 (previously Captainsuperpotato )) and I'll try to answer it as soon as I can (remember I live in Scandinavia so, you know, time zones). I love you so much and you are worth the world!
Tony slowly came to consciousness to an annoying beeping sound and feeling like he had the mother of all hangovers. He tried to open his eyes but it was like they were glued together. After a few minutes he managed to pry them open but immediately regretted himself when he was met by a blinding white light. He groaned and closed them again before reopening them and adjusting to the light. He looked around himself and saw that he was in a hospital room which was filled with the Avengers, all asleep.
"You are gonna try and stay out of this business, and you better keep your mouth shut about all of this." Came a deep voice.
“Aye! We will protect you and young Anthony as if he was one of our own!” Came Thor’s booming voice.
What did stir a little curiosity in him were the two men who had been coming to the mansion for a few days now and always went down to the basement where they would stay for hours some days. He could never hear what it was they were doing whenever he walked by since the basement was sound proof.
“I don't like this guy, he hurt you and what if he tries something now, huh? Then what? I mean, he obviously still has feelings for you, otherwise he probably wouldn't have asked you out, right?”
When they finished everyone went up together to get cleaned up themselves. Tony went into his and Steve's room (they had decided to share room since they both slept better with the other one there with them, and besides, they always slept in each other's room anyway). He turned around to face the blonde before giving a slight smirk.
He placed himself between the brunette's legs and used his hand to direct his cock to the stretched entrance. He leaned down his head and placed a loving kiss on Tony's lips before whispering in his ear.
"So, now what?" Tony asked unsurely and fighting the urge to look back to Steve, despite feeling the blonde's eyes burning holes into the side of his head.
He barely even noticed Clint putting his hands on his arms when he came out and leading him to the waiting room and sitting him down.
“Anthony Edward Stark, look at me. That is not true, not by a long shot. You were kidnapped and tortured for three weeks straight and then you freed yourself. There was bound to be consequences. Unfortunately you were the one that had to pay the price of my stupidity. I should have known better than to leave you when I knew that HYDRA was after you. It's my fault that you are tormented by nightmares each night. My fault, okay? If anything I'm not the one that deserves you. Because you are amazing Tony. You are kind, smart, beautiful, generous and so much more, I could go on for hours. I love you so much Tony and I am sorry I did this to you.”
“Hey, Bruce, I can take Tony to his room, you told me that you needed to finish up your project right?”
The sound of a slap echoed in the room and all the Avengers stared in shock as Natasha stood in front of Steve who was holding his reddening cheek and watching her in disbelief. She was wearing a serious expression.
“Well, it's great. I honestly don't think I've ever had anyone being this excited to see me but Jarvis when I would come visit from boarding school.”
“Banner!! You better get down here now!!” Shouted Nick on his way in. He would never admit it but seeing the usually energetic and sarcastic kid this still scared him.
Steve laid in the middle of his and Tony's bed, the scent of his lover had long since disappeared and had been replaced by his own causing Steve’s heart to ache in his chest. He sighed and put his arms behind his head and closed his eyes.
He looked around to see that he was in a plainly white room with no windows and a door on the wall in front of him. He was laying on a small bed and his shirt and shoes were gone, leaving him only in his jeans and socks. He remembered going to the grocery store and then… Nothing.
“Because he just wants to apologize to me! Trust me, I don't want to see him more than you want me to but I just want to get it over with. You don't know him like I do, he'll just find a way to contact me until I say yes and I can't do that! I'm already freaking out over that Rumlow and Howard might find me and I don't need another thing on my plate!” Tony yelled. He got up from the couch and made his way past Steve in the doorway and past Bucky and Natasha who were standing a bit behind him with frowns on their faces. He threw on his shoes and went outside and headed towards the coffee shop where he would meet Ty.
He had been so busy the past year that it never occurred to him to call his friends. He remembered how he had been on his way back to his dorm room after the last class of the day and finding his dad's driver by his door. Tony was seventeen and had been working on getting his third Ph.D. at MIT when his dad decided that he wanted his personal punching bag back. He hadn't gotten the chance to say goodbye to Pepper or Rhodey and when he had gotten back to Manhattan he had been greeted with a beating and an order to cut every possible tie with his friends.
“Oh mama” he raised his hand to wipe away the tears of her face “I forgave you years ago.” Maria let out a strangled sob and clutched Tony's hand, placing little kisses on it.
Jarvis head spun so fast he was surprised he hadn't given himself a whiplash only to face the Avengers standing on the opposite side of the room. Clint, who had been the one to speak up, smiled at him apologetically.
“There is something I never thought I'd see, the great Captain Rogers, the biggest mob boss of New York, turned into a blushing mess by an eighteen year old boy he just met.”
Steve just chuckled and rolled his boyfriend out the door and to the car where the rest of the team were standing with stuffed animals, chocolate and balloons. They helped Tony into the car and packed away the wheelchair in the trunk of the car. The road home was filled with happy chatter and excitement, everyone was happy that Tony would be coming home and that they could finally leave that hospital. There was only so many preppy nurses and smell of death anyone could take.
“Oh Tony” he started while caressing the trembling boy's cheek “why are you even trying to resist? You know that it will only make it worse for you.”
“Well, us preparing breakfast before getting distracted, ruining the food and then going out for pancakes.”
Before he could reply the door to the bathroom in the small lab opened and Tony stepped out, fully dressed. He walked up to the two Avengers with a slight limp and a freshly wrapped wrist, all while looking at Steve who slowly trailed his eyes up and down the younger mans body.
Tony heard rather that felt the slap on his cheek. His head snapped to the side and his hand went to cover the throbbing side of his face, he didn't need a mirror to know that it was turning red.
He had been making his way through the different hallways when he heard voices getting closer. Tony looked around and saw a door on his right and went in and closing the door behind him. He pressed his ear to the door and listened as the voices walked past him and disappearing.
Tony desperately tried to break free from the harsh grasp but was unable to do so since the man on him was much larger and not to mention stronger. Tears were streaming down his face as he tried to fight to no avail. He could see the frustration that was burning in Tiberius eyes while he proceeded to rip Tony's shirt in half.
“Yes, thank you mr Lehnsherr. Thank you so much! Yes, my team and I will meet you there tomorrow. Thank you again! Yes, okay, goodnight.” Steve hung up his phone and slumped ungraciously down on the couch while covering his face.
He pressed harder on the pedal and drove past the cars and ignored them honking and shouting at him.
“Don't worry Tony” he whispered while clutching the pillow tighter to his chest “I'm coming for you.”
“Captain Rogers” he started with a British accent and reached his hand out which Steve shook “I never got the opportunity to thank you and your team for saving me. You have no idea how grateful I am and I am so terribly sorry that you have found yourself in the same position that Erik was. I cannot begin to imagine how you must be feeling.” They let go of each other's hands and Steve and his team sat back down again when Charles settled on Erik’s lap which, judging by the lack of reaction on the Brotherhood’s side, was completely normal.
Anyways I hope you guys like this last chapter and remember to leave some kudos and please comment what you thought of it/the whole fic.
Tony was walking quickly towards the cafe, trying to shake off the feelings of anger and sadness before he reached his destination. ‘Why is everyone so against me making my own decisions?!’ He thought. He was so focused on trying to calm down that he didn't notice Bucky following him only a few feet behind, carefully making sure that his friend would be alright.
Tony moaned loudly and arched his back off the bed. He didn't know that his nipples could be so sensitive, he hadn't really thought about it before. The furthest he had ever gone before Steve was exchanging hand jobs with a boyfriend he's had when he was sixteen.
The last Tony remembered before passing out is being tossed into the back of a black van and Bucky screaming his name accompanied by the sound of gunshots
Rhodey and Pepper were still hugging him and Pepper was cupping his cheeks and turning his head around to look over his face. When she saw that there was no damage she let him go and smacked him over the head instead.
When he was about halfway there he got an uneasy feeling in his stomach but figured that he was just probably being paranoid. When he was about a block away from the small grocery shop an object was thrown a couple of feet in front of him. He immediately recognized it as a grenade and quickly backed away and was just about to turn around, the weapon blowed up sending him flying back.
Steve only clutched him closer to his body, that was all he could do so that he wouldn't get into his car and drive over to Coulson's place where they held Rumlow. They had kept him there for interrogations (among other things, they weren't called the Avengers for nothing) for the sake of Tony's sanity.
“It wasn't your fault, Cap. It was nobody's fault but HYDRA’s. Rumlow did this to me, not you. Okay? I love you, I love you…”
Anyways hope you like this and stay tuned for the next chapter as it is already in progress and always remember...
That's when Clint’s phone started to ring. Tony stirred a little bit so the sniper stepped out of the room to take the call. Steve kept stroking his hair and he kept sleeping.
He slowly looked up with wide eyes only to see Howard sneering down at him with pure disgust, eyes filled with nothing but hatred.
The team quickly stood up and went to follow the doctor. On their way Steve fell into step with Bucky.
“What the hell do you think you are doing!? Tony you know you need to rest if you want these injuries to heal faster! And what the hell happened to your neck!?”
Steve only nodded and proceeded to take the boy into his own arms and started to run towards Bruce's lab. He pushed the door open and went right over to the examination table. Bruce's confused expression turned into one of horror when he saw who the injured person was.
“You're wrong,” he started while trying to keep his voice steady “they love me. They love me and they will come for me. And you, all of you, will regret ever touching me, for every mark on my body guarantees one on yours.”
They washed each other and with only a few make out sessions in between. They stepped out and dried themselves off and went to get dressed.
He was immediately greeted by an enthusiastic DUM-E that beeped and twirled around him. Tony petted the claw.
a single tear escape his eye because of you, should you ever hurt him… I swear I will hunt you down to the end of the world if I have to and I will not rest before I have killed you in the most painful way imaginable. Mark my words Captain, nobody will ever hurt my son again as long as I live and no one can stop me. Mob boss or not I will not hesitate to destroy you and anyone who tries to get in my way.” At the end of her threat she had inched closer and pulled him down to her level until they were almost nose to nose. Suddenly she let go of him with a sweet and charming smile.
Ana and Edwin Jarvis made their way to the Avengers mansion hand in hand with small smiles on their faces. They had missed their Tony so much and could not wait to see him and the rest of the team as well. They had grown very found of the mob after seeing how well they were treating Tony and how happy they made him.
Tony woke up to his alarm clock going off at 6.30 a.m and DUM-E poking him to get him up, like most mornings. He groaned and started to reach his hand out to press the snooze button on his phone but caught himself and he turned it off instead. He sat up on his bed and dragged his fingers through his hair. His hand got stuck in the dark curls a couple of times and he just sat there and debated whether it was worth getting up and go to work or if he should just lay down and go back to sleep.
The woman, Natasha, didn't break her glare as she lowered her gun and stepped back to sit next to the injured man.
Heart pounding in his chest he kept going, not giving the bodies a second thought beside quickly grabbing one of their guns and put it in his belt.
“Dude, stop staring, you look like you are about to devour him and you know Bruce will kill you if you try anything.”
Came nurse Darcy's amused voice from the reception. The young nurse was sitting with her feet propped up on the desk and she was smirking at the young genius who just scowled back at her.
“I am really sorry about this. But just so you know, if you ever hurt him, this will only be a fraction of what I'm going to do to you.”
“Oh, darling” Ana breathed softly “we figured it out after Edwin and I went to the mansion to visit you since it had been so long since we last spoke. When we arrived and, and you weren't there… We were so worried and it turned out that the group had been so busy trying to find you that they forgot to tell anyone. And we figured where you were since these two awful men kept coming down here since you disappeared.”
He rubbed his fingers together while lying down so that his face was directly in front of the hole, trying to warm the lube up before circling his index finger around Tony's entrance. He looked at Tony who nodded at him and he slowly pushed his finger inside. He stopped for a moment, letting Tony adjust before slowly moving it. Tony moaned from above him at the new sensation. After a while Steve had three fingers in Tony's ass and the teen was moaning and panting loud.
Apparently Tony was also great with weapons since he had been prepared to take over his father's company his whole life. So he knew how to both build and use most weapons there was (Steve would never admit it but he thought that the image of Tony with a gun was kind of a turn on).
Squeezing his hand, she placed a soft but firm kiss on his knuckles and slowly closed the small window and hurried back to her job.
This is also like a little birthday present from me to... Well... Me! (Like a week late but oh well! B) ). That's right!! Your girl is 18 now!!
Distracted by his own thoughts he didn't notice a strange man walking up behind him until the man pushed him against the wall and had a gun pressed against his forehead.
“I don't know what you are talking about” the response was followed by a small blush and he refused to meet her eyes.
Steve swallowed hard and nodded his head. He helped Thor carry Tony while Bruce made sure that they held him right so that he wouldn't be damaged further. Steve tossed the keys to Bucky and told him that he'd have to drive while he settled in the backseat with Bruce and Tony in between them. He held Tony's head between his legs so that his neck wouldn't move in case it was damaged while Bruce tried to stop the bleeding on his leg from the bullet hole.
Tony, along with the rest except Pepper and Natasha who had just raised a surprised eyebrow, we're looking at Rhodey with wide eyes and open mouths. Rhodey just shrugged and leaned back on the couch.
Around 30 minutes after Tony fell asleep Clint poked his head through the door and asked if they could come in again. Steve gestured for them to get in but stay as quiet as possible. They all complied and sat down in their original spots around the bed. They all looked softly at the sleeping genius and wondered how he had managed to weasel his way into their hearts in such a short period of time.
She just smacked his chest at that and settled so that she was laying next to him and turned off her lamp.
“It's okay Steve, we’re okay now, we will be okay.” Tony comforted him and for the first time in a week, he actually believed his own words.
He blacked out for a second before feeling the sharp pain in his chest and brought his hand up to touch it. His hand was covered in blood when he brought it back and the ringing in his ears was getting louder. Suddenly blurry figures started to appear in front of him and that's when he finally passed out.
"I'm really sorry Tony, I didn't want you to get involved in any of this. I just wanted to keep you safe."
Tony gulped slightly before nodding and Steve slowly pushed the tip in. Tony hissed and Steve paused to let him adjust to the size before continuing. He knew that it was way different than fingers and took his time pushing in.
Came Tony's panicked voice. He knew what damage Bruce could do, he had seen it when a guy had tried to mug him and bruce had sent the guy to a hospital.
Steve told him about growing up with Bucky in the poorer part of Brooklyn, which explained the slight accent.
Tony turned his head around so fast that Steve was worried that he would break his neck. Tony looked at the British man and woman by the kitchen door who both wore an aprons with wide eyes and mouth agape. Tony basically flew out of his chair and into their arms with tears welling up in his eyes.
“This is great and all, really cute reunion. But I'm really hungry now and like Tony said, it smells like heaven, so if we could, you know, hurry this along it would be great.”
Her head snapped up when he closed the door behind himself and a lovely smile spread across her lips. She slipped over to her side of the bed and patted the spot next to her, indicating for him to sit down next to her.
Loud chatter filled the kitchen while the Avengers enjoyed their breakfast when Bruce stood up and headed to the fridge.
Jarvis let go of his wife's hand in order to ring the doorbell since in his other hand there was a bag which held a container of goulash and a pie that Ana had made that morning. When nobody opened they rang again, certain that they had just missed it. By the third time they looked at each other with confused expressions before Ana pulled up her cellphone, another gift from Tony, and dialed his number. When the boy didn't answer she dialed Steve’s number instead and the rest of the team when he didn't answer either.
“His dad was an abusive drunk and his mom was so jacked up on pills to even notice him.” Came Bruce's reply, venom basically dripping from his voice. No one questioned him, they all knew his own history of an abusive father and understood why he was so protective of the young genius.
Relief flooded through Tony at Maria's words, though all worry would not be gone until he saw them all with his own eyes. He did however feel relieved enough to let out a small giggle of his own and tried not to think about how this was the first time he had truly smiled since he was taken.
“Hey Buck, what's-” Steve didn't get to finish his question before Bucky's frantic voice filled his ear. “Woah woah woah! Slow down, I can't understand you! Are you okay? Is it Tony? Is he alright?”
“Jesus Christ Ty! What the hell?!” Tony exclaimed while shooting out of his seat while ignoring the curious stares they were receiving. He swayed a little bit and felt his eyes getting heavier but ignored it in favor of continuing. “I've already told you, I'm in a relationship, a very happy one in fact. And even if I weren't I'd never get back together with you! I can't trust you anymore! Goodbye Tiberius, Steve was right, it was a mistake coming here.”
“Oh, you know, fine. I mean why wouldn't I be? After my dad abused me, my mother neglected me and you abandoning me I should be nothing but happy, right?”
“After a quick stop to the hospital.” Bruce chimed in, the rest of the group and Maria nodding their heads in agreement.
“No, I mean, what are you still doing here with me? Why would you stay with someone so broken that they can’t even sleep through the night without waking up screaming? You could do so much better Steve, you deserve someone who won’t keep you up at night with their nightmares or someone who doesn’t freak out when you try to do anything intimate with them. It’s just… I don’t deserve you.”
Tony's arms were suddenly pinned beside his head that was dangling out of the mattress and he looked up to see Tiberius grinning down on him. He felt his breath quicken when he saw that the blonde was completely naked down the waist and that his cock was rock hard with precum dripping out of the slit. He proceeded to struggle even harder but he was still weak from the hit and his tormentors grips were solid.
“What do you want Ty? You got me here and can you just say what you want to say so that we can move on with our lives? Because I've had a shitty day and I just want to go home and rest.”
Just before he was about to pass out Tiberius pulled out and jerked himself off until he was coming all over Tony's face and chest.
“You must be Tiberius.” Steve deadpanned with a frighteningly calm voice and an unimpressed expression on his face, though his eyes could not hide the fury inside him “I thought you would be, well, more?”
“Well” he started “how about you and I go and visit Anthony tomorrow to get your mind of off this? I can tell mr Stark that we are visiting your sister to avoid suspicion?” He could help but smile at the joy that broke out on her face.
“In a few days, he healed quite a bit while unconscious and since they haven't detected any permanent damages he can come home if he just takes it easy and takes his medicines.”
“Lehnsherr” Howard sneered back “I see Rogers convinced you to join him in his quest to rescue his little damsel, why am I not surprised? I take it you're here to repay your debt, huh? You save his whore after he saved yours?” Howard let out an ugly laugh before jumping behind the wall next to him, leaving Brock and Tiberius to fight of Lehnsherr and his men. He dragged Tony down the corridor, leaving the sound of gunshots and flesh hitting flesh behind them.
Ty just smiled sympathetically and pushed forward the coffee cup closer to Tony who just rolled his eyes and took two big gulps. He sighed in content at the taste and then motioned for Ty to start talking.
Steve looked up with a perfect bitch face and Tony couldn't help but to let out a loud laugh. Steve's expression morphed into a smile and before Tony knew it lips were placed on his own and their tongues were wrestling for dominance. Steve easily won that battle and he had Tony moaning against his mouth. Tony separated their lips briefly to remove Steve's own shirt. They went back to kissing and feeling each other up. Steve started to tug at Tony's pants while moving his lips away from the other man's own and started to suck at the spot underneath the ear that he knew drove Tony crazy.
Tony felt the hand wrapped around his arm tighten painfully and Howard started to shake him violently before removing him from the sink and smashing him against the wall. Tony flinched when his head connected with the wall but he didn't tear his eyes from the face that had haunted his nightmares since he was a child. The older Stark scowled at his only child before opening his mouth.
Even though Steve would deny it to his dying day, he whined when Tony got off his lap to stand up so that he could remove his pants and underwear. Steve copied the action and soon their lips were on each other again and Tony pushed Steve down on the bed so that he was sprawled out on the mattress. Steve sat up so that his back was resting against the headboard and he had a full view of Tony's naked form.
“Wait!” he shouted while running forward, his friends hot on his heels “Don't kill them, not yet anyway.” He walked closer to them and kneeled in front of the blonde one.
Steve stood frozen in place, just staring at the door in front of him. He didn't notice Bucky and Bruce standing next to him, he didn't notice the doctors and nurses running around him, didn't notice the rest of the team coming in. It was like he was on autopilot when he took the new clothes from Thor and going to the bathroom so that he could change and wash away his lover's blood from his body.
He was cutting deep lines into Tony's legs while yelling at him to talk. Tony was screaming and crying but refused to talk. He tried to distract his mind by trying to solve different calculations but it wasn't working too well. Tears were streaming down his face and his throat was sore from the screaming and the bruises that Rumlow had left while strangling him with a piece of rope. Brock was avoiding hitting any major arteries so that he wouldn't bleed to death, the man knew what he was doing.
“Then there was the day when I escaped. Rumlow came into my room and beat me some before he stopped. Then he… He- he r-raped me. I- I managed to stab him in the neck with a shard of glass I had gotten the day before and that's when I left. And then I managed to get to the control room and contacted you guys. I found out that HYDRA had a room that contained their weapons and explosives. I managed to get there and hack their systems so that I could set them off after 10 minutes since that's how long it was supposed to take me to get into a safe distance. Unfortunately I got caught by some of the HYDRA agents but managed to escape before everything blew up. That's why I couldn't get into a safer distance.”
Once again, as you can see, I absolutely love kudos and especially comments, your opinions mean the world to me! I love you all!!!!!!!
Two minutes later Tony let go of the cock in his mouth with a gasp and looked Steve in the eyes. While still remaining eye contact he re-settled on Steve's lap and slowly sunk down on the fully hard, wet dick. Tony stopped to adjust when he was fully settled and by then they both were breathing loudly. Then Tony started to lift himself up until only the tip of Steve was still in him before slamming back down. They both groaned when Tony repeated the motion and soon they had found a rhythm. With Steve's hands on each Tony's ass cheeks and Tony's arms around Steve's neck they leaned in and shared a sloppy kiss. Steve angled his hips and when Tony slammed back down he saw stars as his prostate was hit with Steve.
Jarvis hadn't seen them up close but there was something familiar about the two of them, especially the blonde one.
He started of by fixing the engine for a beautiful black 1967 Chevy Impala, he was so concentrated on his tasks that he didn't notice the hours flying by and suddenly Fury was shaking his shoulder.
Steve gave a little smirk at that, like he knew something Tony didn't. Tony just gave him a confused stare but the blonde just kept pushing him forward through the door. When Tony was wheeled into the house he was immediately hit in the face with the delicious scent of food. He inhaled deeply and felt his mouth water. He heard a laugh behind him and turned to see the team snickering at him. He just rolled his eyes dramatically and crossed his arms over his chest.
“The Avengers, Bruce, Nat, Clint, Bucky, Thor… Steve…” he sobbed out the last name as a wave of fresh tears descended down his face.
I know none of you believe me right now, I'm not even sure I believe myself. But we need to push our own guilt behind and focus on how we are gonna take care of Tony and keep him safe in the future. There will always be people out there trying to hurt him to get to us, but he is our family now, and we always protect our family.”
He looked through the blueprints and found his way to the weapons room which, luckily, was only a few door away from his current location.
Steve just chuckled and kissed the top of the geniuses head while said genius frowned up on him. Steve took a second to admire his lover's face with a grin stretching across his face. Tony's hair was all tousled and his plump lips were a lovely shade of red that made Steve want to kiss them all day. His brown doe eyes were wide and looking right into his own blue ones.
you find him.” Raven, who had been silent the entire time, spoke up. “Because our tracker didn't only see the two of them, she followed them. To Stark mansion.”
It had been a week since they had brought Tony back home and the nightmares had started. His nightmares consisted of his time with HYDRA and the torture they put him through. Sometimes it was about Rumlow beating and raping him while the team watched and laughed, sometimes they participated in his torture and sometimes it was Howard there, beating and cutting him up while telling him how worthless he is. The worst ones though, according to Tony, was when Rumlow was torturing the team and he couldn't do anything but watch as his friends begged for help. He would wake up crying with images in his head like Thor laying motionless while getting beaten with a hammer, Clint thrashing around while being cut up with various types of knives, Steve screaming while getting burned, Bruce trying to throwing his head around and trying to avoid getting drowned again, Natasha's cries while Rumlow raped her and Bucky wailing when he gets skinned alive.
“Because he doesn't annoy me as much as you do.” Was Bruce's calm reply. The scientist hadn't even looked up from the stove when he answered and was unable to see Clint pouting and snuggling closer to Natasha.
Tony felt disappointment well up inside it and let out a quiet “oh”. He had missed his friends terribly and he had just gotten them back only to have them taken from him again so soon.
"I honestly don't know what to say, I'm still trying to process everything that just happened. But what I would like to know is how and when you got involved with all this?" Asked Tony, looking up.
We are unfortunately starting to reach the end of this story. I am thinking four or five more chapters to this and honestly I don't want it to end, but oh well, all good things must come to an end.
Snapping back to the present, Tony looked up at her and let her wipe away the tears on his face, not even flinching when she accidently brushed the fresh bruise that Howard had left after his last visit.
“Ok guys, I got a mail from Coulson yesterday, saying that he needs us to come by his place this afternoon, but Tony won't be able to come with us, so one of us is going to have to stay with him. Anyone volunteer?”
“They left me.” Tony wept. He felt his mother still and looked up at her only to meet a confused expression.
Tony laughed at that and cuddled closer to Steve who hugged him tighter. That fell asleep like that, cuddled close and feeling like in that moment, nothing could go wrong.
After a few minutes and steadily growing anxiety Tony hacked into the surveillance cameras and found a room where they must keep their weapons and explosives. An idea was quickly forming in his head.
“Listen Bruce and listen carefully. I am tired of people apologizing to me for something that happened and that was not their fault. Like last week, Clint was basically bawling his eyes out because he thought it was his fault and Steve blamed himself just yesterday and I can see all the guilt in all of your eyes whenever I flinch from a bit of pain or anything. But it's not your fault, okay? Not yours, not mine, not the teams. It was HYDRA’s fault and especially Rumlow and according to what Bucky told me, he is really paying for it. So stop blaming yourself, alright?”
“What? Can you blame me? I've been stuck with hospital food for a week! And this smells like heaven.”
Steve looked at the archer with furrowed eyebrows. Clint seemed a little bit too happy with the information. Before he could ask Bucky beat him to it.
He didn't get the chance to finish his sentence until Bruce had him tackled and pinned beneath him, punching him and smashing his head against the floor like his life depended on it until his face was unrecognizable and blood pooled beneath him. Bucky went forward after a few minutes and gently pried his friend of off the now shaking man under him. He pulled a shaking Bruce up and they resumed their place at Steve's side. Knowing that Tiberius was done for the blonde leader moved to the other man instead.
They both put on their jackets and went outside and stepped into one of the cars in the driveway. Steve drove them to a small cafe where they were led to a small booth in a secluded area. Tony slid in and was surprised when Steve sat next to him instead of in front of him. Steve slung an arm around Tony's shoulders and the smaller man leaned into his side.
“Wait” he said in between laughs “how come you didn't have to shower off the stench?”  he asked with a raised eyebrow. Maria just smirked before answering.
“I know I haven't been the best mother during Anthony's life Captain Rogers.” she stated firmly “But know this; should anything happen to my boy thanks to you, should
He turned his head back and saw the entire team standing a few feet back, looking at his friends suspiciously. Steve in particular was staring at the arm Rhodey had wrapped around his waist and clenched his fists.
Tony smirked and went up to suck a mark right below Steve's right ear before whispering with a low voice.
Tony took deep breaths, this isn't the first time he had gotten kidnapped. It happened a few times when he still lived with Howard by people who wanted money. Of course Howard stopped paying after the first two times and the three times after that Tony had been forced to save himself.
They reluctantly let go of each other and Rhodey and Pepper got into the car and waved goodbye Tony waved back and didn't go back into the house until the car was out of sight.
“I’m so sorry my dear, but it is. But now we must find a way to save our boy.” The couple looked at each other and clutched their hands together in an attempt to comfort each other.
Tony muttered for himself while going through the computers. He quickly memorized the blueprints and searched for something that might help him.
Tony looked around at his friends and saw them all glancing at each other. It was Bruce who answered him with a grim expression.
Natasha walked confidentiality on Tony's left side while Steve was on his right, his hand slightly brushing against Tony's own until Tony decided to be bold and  just clapped their hands together. Steve raised his eyebrows in surprise but didn't let go, squeezing the smaller hand slightly. Natasha just smirked and kept walking. When they reached the common room she went and sat in Clint’s lap and gave him a quick peck on the lips. The archer smiled and wrapped an arm around her waist.
He made it home in record time but stopped outside the apartment building. Three strange identical cars were parked outside next to Bruce's, Tony wondered who's it might be since there weren't many random people coming to these parts of town. And what was Bruce doing home?
After about an hour and three cups of coffee later Tony felt like his bladder was about to explode so he excused himself and headed to the toilets.
Meanwhile Tony stood still as his brain tried to process what exactly what was happening. The unexpected familiar feeling of his mom comforting him washed over his body and he felt himself slumping against his mother and he ignored the twinge of pain of his sore knees hitting the floor, instead letting the tears flow and allowing her to comfort him in a way that only she could. He wrapped his weak arms around her as tightly as he could muster while ugly sobs tore their way through his throat, completely forgetting and ignoring the people around them that were staring intensely at the scene.
“Ty, uh, wh- what are y-you doing h-here?” Tony cursed himself for stuttering and tried to play it off by keeping his head high and not to break eye contact. He looked the larger man over and couldn't help but notice how much he resembled Steve, blue eyes, blonde hair, the way their bodies were built. Tony shook those thoughts out of his head and instead focused on Tiberius who was still staring at him.
“Alright, here is your room. Mine is just across from yours and Bruce is to your left and the others are just down the hallway. If you ever need anything don't hesitate to knock, alright Doll?”
As soon as he made eye contact he saw tears welling up in her usually joyful eyes. They seemed to widen even moore when she saw the state he was in.
This time when Steve woke up it was because Tony was drawing patterns on his chest with his finger. He wasn't looking at Steve's face as he had his full attention on the invisible doodles. He looked up when he felt the blonde's gaze on his face. For a minute they just laid there and looked at each other until Tony broke the stare by putting his head on Steve's chest. Steve looked down on the genius in his arms and frowned.
Said genius couldn't contain the screams that escaped his mouth when Rumlow shoved in. Too fast. Too dry. Too much.
Steve put his own hands on each side of Tony's face. Steve licked the bottom of Tony's lip, asking for entrance which he happily received. Steve let his hand wander further down so that it was on Tony's waist when Tony pulled away.
Steve took this time to go over well the details of Tony's face, trying to soak it all in. He couldn't believe how close he had been to losing Tony and he wanted nothing more than to lock him up in a tower and wrap him up in blankets and protect him from the world.
Steve didn't tear his eyes from the door where Howard had disappeared until he felt a slight tug on his sleeve and turned around to look at Tony, what he saw broke his heart.
He looked in the rearview mirror and saw Coulson's car right behind them. They were about two minutes away from Tony's location and he felt his stomach drop at the sight of smoke rising from the direction they were heading.
Steve sat up straight and for a second Tony could feel his heart drop at the thought of Steve realising that he was right and leaving. But Steve only pulled him up so that they were face to face and stared deeply into his eyes.
Steve chuckled but wasted no time in coating himself up, groaning at the friction before slowly pushing in. He threw his head back as the tight heat was wrapped around his length. He stopped after an inch, letting Tony adjust to the size before repeating the motion until he was buried to the hilt.
He spent the next six hours like that, sitting in that uncomfortable chair with his team surrounding him and talking in hushed voices with each other.
Steve matches the pace with his thrust and rubbed his thumb across the slit and soon enough Tony was spurting come all over his hands and the sheets and he was clenching down on Steve's member. Steve groaned loudly and it took him three more thrusts to reach his orgasm.
After a few deep breaths Tony motioned for Steve to continuing. Steve took his time preparing Tony, making sure that he was alright at all times. After fifteen minutes he had four fingers pumping in and out of Tony and Tony was a shaking, babbling mess beneath him.
He quickly closed the door and dropped the body before he went over to the sea of weapons. He very carefully made his way through it all until he found what he was looking for. A control station was set up by wall on the other side of the room. He turned it on and quickly hacked through the system. He found out that this panel was connected to several of the explosives in the room.
Clint was the first one to throw his arms around her and hug her tight, soon followed by the rest of the team. Their group hug was interrupted by one of the doctors.
A few dreadful minutes later the blueprints popped up on Bruce's screen and he put it next to Steve's.
“They came to mine and Bruce's apartment about a year ago since Clint was injured and Bruce is the team doctor. I was supposed to be at work but since here was barely any customers I got to go home early. I walk into our living room where this group of ridiculously good looking people are gathered and Natasha is pointing a gun at my face. Bruce managed to calm everyone down and he explained everything. At first Steve was a bit cold and shit but then we had to move in with them since their rivals were after me and I was attacked by one of them. So, Steve and I got to know each other and well… Here we are.”
After a few minutes of Brock pumping his fingers in and out of the trashing teen he removed his hand and spit in it and used it to slick himself up and positioning his cock at the entrance and started to slowly push in before lowering his head to bite into Tony's neck.
Bruce just went right up to Tony and took the boy's face in his hands and started to look him over, not noticing that his hand was joined with the Captains.
Tony sighed with relief and slumped into Steve’s side. He was very grateful for the lack of great injuries. He threw the blanket off of him and saw that he was only in a hospital gown. He could practically feel Steve’s eyes trailing up his legs and the rest of his body and the brunette just gave him a small smirk.
“You were attacked by a member of one of our rivals, HYDRA. He beat you up pretty badly, you were lucky that Nick came when you did or who knows what could have happened. And it's also my turn to watch you. You have been out the whole day and Bruce refused to leave you without any supervision so the team decided to take turns.” Was the explanation. The memories of what had happened to get him into this state came back with force and he started shaking all over. He remembers walking to the shop, a strange man with a gun pinning him to a brick wall, questions about Steve, pain, pain, pain, a gunshot, Nick and then darkness.
“Oh” the butler let out but before he could collapse back on the bed his wife wrapped an arm around his back and helped him stabilize.
Tony reached his hand out to cup the blonde's cheek and turned his face towards his so that they were forced to make eye contact.
Despite the playful reply, Tony put on the much larger shirt and discreetly inhaled its scent, loving the fact that he could smell Steve all over it.
Tony took a deep breath before looking towards the two remaining men in the room. They were smirking at him with hunger clouding their eyes. At the same time they made their way towards the now shaking boy who was still sitting on the mattress.
Tony woke up to his head pounding and his body aching. He tried to open his eyes to little avail. After a few minutes he managed to pry them open and was met by a blinding light and he blinked while letting out a painful groan. He tried to sit up but fell back after the pain in his ribs became too much.
Before he could protest he was pulled into Steve's chest and his lips were pressed on his own. He struggled a few seconds before slowly melting into the kiss. When they finally pulled away Tony's lips were red and a little swollen and his eyes were wide open. Steve took a hold of his chin and looked directly into his eyes.
was even looking for him, if they were coming for him. Maybe Howard was right? Maybe the team was happy to get rid of him? Maybe he was nothing but a burden they had finally gotten rid of?
After around a minute Tony snapped out of his trance and cleared his throat. Steve turned around and gave him a big smile which Tony returned, even though his eyes kept glancing down at the Captain’s toned chest. Steve pretended that he didn't notice and instead went over to the coffee machine.
And Steve, like I said, none of us knew this was gonna happen. Whether they had succeeded when we were away or not they would probably have gotten him somehow some other time.
“Mom?” He coughed, his throat to dry to form any full sentences. Maria stood up and fetched the glass and pitcher of water on the table next to his hospital bed and poured him a glass. She helped him sit up and brought the glass to his lips with one hand as she held his head with the other and gently stroked his hair.
“Jarvis, Ana.” Bruce spoke up softly “we need to tell you something, but you should probably sit down first.”
Hoooooooooly shit it has been a while since the last update. I am so so so so so so sorry!!!!! I honestly have no better excuse other than an extreme case of writers block but I really hope that this chapter makes up for it.
The door opened and a paper plate of some kind of food was pushed in alongside a plastic cup of water. They fed him once a day, just enough to keep him alive and he knew that he had gotten quite skinnier than before this whole mess. He reached out with a wince and grabbed the plate and cup and started eating with the plastic knife and fork. They only gave him plastic cups, knives and forks and paper plates so that he couldn't use any of it as a weapon and when he finished someone always came in to remove everything.
“I must say Anthony, I'm impressed. You managed to take both Rumlow and several of my agents down without a scratch and in your, well, state besides. Though I am wondering, what are you planning on doing now?”
Just as Steve was about to reply, Bruce came and told them to get moving. Steve sent one last glance to Tony's direction before following his friends.
The idea must have been that they would have been able to set of the explosions directly from the HYDRA base.
“You heard me. What are your intentions with Tony? Because I swear to God Rogers, I don't give a damn about how powerful or dangerous you are. If you hurt him, I will hunt you down and I will rip your spine out through your ass and beat your cold, dead body with it. Or worse, I'll send Pepper on you and help her bury the body.”
We are getting close to the end of this fic. Probably around two more chapters then it's done. I... I don't know what to say...
He took a shuddering breath and felt his heart pounding in his chest. When he calmed down a bit be turned around and was met by probably the most beautiful sight he had ever seen.
Tony looked around at his friends who were all staring at him, waiting for him to explain what had happened. Tony felt tears well up in his eyes and let out a choked sob. Large arms were wrapped protectively around him and he looked up to see Steve holding him while telling the team to step out for a moment. Everyone but Steve left while sending worried looks to the sobbing genius.
How dare anyone put a hand on his sweetheart? How dare anyone harm a single hair on his beautiful head?
“Yes, I told you Steve, the boy is a genius.” The scientists said while packing Tony's clothes and books in the other bag. The last one was smaller that the other two and there he he placed his own books and Tony's tools, some inventions and his laptop where he kept all his research and designs.
The rest of the Avengers nodded their heads in agreement and Bruce had to admit that Tony was safer with them than anywhere else.
“Hey baby.” Tony finally managed to open his eyes and after hey adjusted to the light they immediately went to the blonde figure sitting next to him with his hand in their grasp and smiling gently at him.
The room was so silent that you could hear a pin drop but Natasha was still glaring at the silent Captain. Clint would have laughed at the sight of his big, strong, fearless leader looking like a scolded puppy in front of a woman almost half his size if he didn't know that Natasha would surely kill him for that.
“Don't worry Bruce, we will be quick and the rest of the team will be here and watch over him. Believe it or not, they are not completely incapable of taking care of injuries.” Assured Bucky.
Tony whined as Steve and Bruce helped him into the wheelchair, insisting that he could walk by himself.
“Wait, are you trying to tell me that the kid actually built this?” Asked Steve while watching the robot claw at Bucky's metal arm.
The whole team turned towards him and they were immediately on their feet and on their way towards them. They took in Tony's appearance, the terrified expression on his face, the tear tracked cheeks, the red handprint on his left cheek and the painful looking grip the older man had on him.
After Fury’s had explained what had happened there was a thick silence. The silence was eventually cut by Natasha.
Tony whined but soon shut up when Steve's lips were pressed hard against his own and he moaned at the taste of himself on Steve's tongue.
Everyone jumped when Bruce smashed his hand on the wall and Thor had to hold him back to stop him from harming himself any further. He managed to calm him down after a few minutes but it didn't stop the tears from running down Bruce's cheeks.
The blonde's hands were on his hips as he met the rolls with enthusiasm before he stopped and broke the kiss which caused Tony to whine at the lack of contact.
They walked out hand in hand and went down to the entrance where everyone else already were already waiting for them.
The whole team were in front of the doctor within a second and she needed to take a step back to avoid being run into. Questions came from every direction and she had trouble to hear anything anyone said.
He was panting while he tried to get his shaking hands to dial Steve's number. He had tried to run after the van that Tiberius and another man had had thrown a seemingly unconscious Tony in and then sped away. He pressed the call button and held it to his ear while pacing back and forward. It rang three times before Steve picked up.
The fingers were rough and unforgiving when they went in and out of him and he could feel blood run down his crack when a third one was inserted. After a few seconds the fingers disappeared from him and he looked up only to see Rumlow spit down on his hand and slick himself up and then lining his cock up to enter Tony. He shoved in and didn't give the genius any time to adjust before he was pounding into him.
“Yeah, that was pretty shitty of me wasn't it?” He proceeded to grab Tony's trembling hand in his before the genius snatched it back. Ty gave a little glare before continuing. “I want to apologize to you Tones, I miss you, I want to make it up to you. What do you say?”
“I thought that we could try something different today, you know? Yesterday when I left I kept thinking about how to deal with you since I wasn't getting anywhere and you know what came up in my mind? I thought “if I can't break him from the outside, maybe I could try from the inside. And I know just what to do to achieve that goal.”
He also used it as a distraction from all the anger he was feeling. He had barely kept his emotions under control while Tony was in surgery and he felt like seconds away from exploding and hunting down every member of HYDRA when Cho had mentioned that he had been raped.
“Fuck. You.” Tony breathed out. That turned out to be a mistake because Howard's reaction was to tightly grip his son's hair and forcing his head upwards so that their eyes met. Pure hatred burned in the older Stark's eyes and his face transformed into an ugly sneer.
“Yeah, I've  just missed them so much and now they have to leave. I know I'm being dramatic, but, I just want them here with me.”
They didn't say anything for a while, just stared into eachothers eyes until Steve broke the silence.
Tony woke up to the sound of the door opening. He immediately sat up despite the burning in his ribs and watched as Rumlow walked in with a smirk, empty handed. He swallowed hard but kept a poker face on.
Their tongues were battling for dominance which Steve easily won. Tony yelped when Steve’s arms slid down over his ass and stopped right under them. He was lift up and he wrapped his legs around Steve’s waist. Steve pushed the small genius against the wall and started to grind their erections together. Tony let go of Steve’s lips and threw his head back with a loud moan. Steve latched his lips against the tanned neck and started to suck, lick and bite wherever he could reach. The moans got louder and louder.
“I was so scared baby doll” Steve mumbled into his hair “I was so scared that I had lost you forever. Please forgive me.”
Clint was the first one to spot the couple and he groaned into Natasha's shoulder. Tony just rolled his eyes and went up to Bruce and snatched a waffle from the plate and started to munch on it.
The rest of his body wasn't faring any better, he wore a black T- shirt several sizes too big for him but it had torn so you could see his chest and a bit of his stomach. Cuts, bruises, burn marks covered the young man and there was a large wound in the middle of his chest that looked extremely painful and there was a start of an infection. He had some broken fingers on each hand and his left arm was twisted in an unnatural angle. There was a steadily bleeding bullet wound on one of his thighs and Natasha immediately removed her jacket and put pressure on it.
“Doctor Banner called me when- when you were taken. He gave us the address to this house and we have been here since, waiting for you to come back. My goodness Anthony, do you have any idea how worried we have been? We didn't know where you were or what was happening to you. You would think that we would be used to you getting kidnapped but it scares us just as much every damn time!”
Steve looked up at Bucky and nodded. The brunette smiled and aimed his gun at Rumlow who was now a shaking mess on the floor.
“Hey” Pepper started “we still have today and half of tomorrow. How about we go out and grab a cup of coffee and some doughnuts?”
He reached forward and took the cake before blowing the candle out. He and Bruce shared the cake and and drank their coffee and when Tony's phone showed him that it was 7.30 both men put on their jackets and shoes and headed out. Bruce walked over to his car and waved goodbye to Tony before he got in and drove away. Tony walked the opposite direction towards the shop. Bruce had never really told Tony what he works with, only that he was a doctor of some kind. But Tony didn't want to look a gift horse in the mouth so to say and didn't question him about it, the man had already let him into his home and Tony didn't want to risk anything by prying.
When he had finished he looked around at his teammates and saw that they wore a variety of expressions. Some were furious, some heartbroken, some didn't really show much, letting their tense body language speak for them. One thing they all had in common was that they were all out for the blood of those who had hurt their Tony.
“Don't tell me you forgot about little old me, now? Come on Tony, for old times sake? You used to be so good at this! Let's see if your time as the captains whore has made you any better.” Tiberius gave a cruel smile before roughly shoving into the younger one's mouth and proceeded to fuck his throat mercilessly.
“Calm down, you really think age matters in this whole thing? If you both like each other and are both consenting adults then I see no problem with this whole thing. But I promise you Steve, if you hurt that kid it's not just Bruce that you should be afraid of.” She said, her voice getting darker towards the end.
Doctors and nurses surrounded them immediately and they made Steve put Tony down on one of the stretchers and wheeled him to the direction of the operation rooms. Steve held his hand and tried to follow but two of the nurses stopped him and said that he couldn't go any further. His hand slipped out of Tony's and he watched helplessly as the doors shut behind him and he couldn't see his boyfriend anymore.
“Oh, please just call me Charles, only my students call me professor Xavier and frankly it makes me feel old when I hear that.” He said with a small laugh in the end.
Tiberius Stone smirked down on the shorter man and crossed his arms over his chest. His blue eyes raked over Tony's body and he licked his lips at the sight, the young genius was truly a sight to behold.
Of course, those people had been normal people, these ones seemed a bit more professional and if they were out for the Avengers, they had to be dangerous.
Btw sorry if any of the Italian is wrong, it's all from google translate XD, if you find any wrongs then you're more than welcome to let me know!
“Mama” Tony managed to croak out weakly as he buried his face in her neck and breathing in the comforting scent of her shampoo.
Tony couldn't hold back a scream as three large fingers were brutally pushed inside of him with only a bit of saliva as lubricant.
Everyone had stopped what they were doing and looked at her. She in return looked at each one of them.
Tony let out a breathless laugh and wiped away a lone tear from his face. The happiness that he felt turned into horror when the walkie talkie went off.
After a while and six painful cuts later he stopped. Rumlow was staring down at the bleeding and broken figure on the ground with anger in his eyes. He delivered one last hard kick to Tony's abdomen before sneering.
"So, if I've got this right." He said and looked up "You are a part of a mob, but you aren't really criminals, you only try to keep the city safe, but you are technically only their doctor and occasionally help out in fights..."
“Jesus Christ, I knew he was young, but I didn't think he was that young, Nat! I'm seven years older than him!”
Anyways I hope you enjoy this chapter and stay tuned because the next chapter will be the last! (I know, I can't believe it)
Tony hung up the phone and shook his head with a little smile. Typical Aunt Peggy, always fussing over him yet insisting that she is always fine herself, despite her memory getting worse by the time.
They stood there awkwardly for a minute before Tony rolled his eyes and offered to make pancakes which resulted the team to erupt in cheers.
Tony walked up to the desk and saw the numerous sketchbooks and loose drawings. Some were of the team, some were of places in New York and many other things. He picked up one of himself. It wasn't completely done yet but it was unmistakably him. The curly hair, the same eyes, nose, lips, everything. The drawing was very detailed, like Steve had spent hours working on this. He looked over at Steve who was already staring at him.
When the clock turned one everyone except Clint and Tony left for Phill’s. It was an one hour drive so they had to go a little earlier to get there on time.
He tried to guess where he was when suddenly the memories came rushing back to him, the fight with Steve and the team, storming out, meeting Ty, drinking the drugged coffee and being tossed in a van with Bucky screaming after him.
“Wait, wait wait. What about the team?” He said out of breath. Steve just kept kissing his neck, mumbling a quiet “they're out” and moved to suck at Tony's earlobe. Tony's breath hitched and he closed his eyes in bliss. Steve moved his hands under Tony's shirt and pulled it off the genius. Tony pushed Steve back on the couch so that his back was resting against the arm of the couch. Steve looked up on his boyfriend in surprise since it was mostly Steve who was the more dominant of the two. Tony just smirked at him and draped his leg over Steve so that he was straddling him. The brunette dove his head down and started to kiss and suck on Steve's neck while also grinding their cocks on each other. The blonde put his hands on the exposed waist and rubbed the hipbones with his thumbs.
He grabbed his gun and made his way out of the room, looking for threats and doing the navigation in his head.
“Let go of the boy.” Sneered the tall man in the front of the group, revealing a row of to many sharp teeth.
“Goodnight Tony, sweet dreams.” The blond didn't think but leaned down and pressed a chaste kiss to the Tony's cheek and started to walk back to the others, leaving Tony blushing madly.
Was his response before going out the door and shouting that his “mighty friend is in distress and requires assistance!”
“It's okay” Bucky whispered hoarsely into his ear “we'll find him, I promise. And when we do, they will all pay.”
“Fury what the hell is going on? Jesus Christ, what the hell happened to him!?” Exclaimed Steve when seeing the unconscious boy in Fury’s arms.
That night it took hours for Tony to finally fall asleep, his thoughts of what had happened that day kept him up. Some birthday huh? Finding out that his friend and roommate was part of a crime fighting mob, meeting said mob and couldn't help but think about the mobs gorgeous leader.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
“Thanks Buck, I know he should be able to make his own decisions, I know that! But I just have a bad feeling about this guy, you know?”
After a minute of silence Tony took a deep breath and looked up at Steve who was already staring at him.
The door suddenly opened and two men stepped in. The first man wore a big smile and started to talk.
Tony burrowed his face in her neck and inhaled her calming scent. Her arms were back around her and he let himself be held. Rhodey joined the hug and had an arm wrapped around his waist which he used to pull them both into his chest.
Tony and Steve had gotten closer and Tony could feel himself fall harder and faster for the older man the more time went on.
“Oh baby…” Maria began, a small relieved smile forming on her lips “what are you talking about? They haven't left your side since we got here, the same with Mr and Mrs Jarvis. They are out at the moment to get everyone some new clothes and take some showers, Doctor Cho said that the stench they were oozing was going to kill everyone in the hospital and sent them all home to freshen up. They should be back any minute now. You should have seen them, arguing about who was gonna do what in order to get back as quickly as possible. I'm pretty sure that man of yours, Steve, threw his one armed friend across the corridor.” The last part was followed by a giggle from his mother.
He stepped in, unsure of himself, and was greeted by the sight of Steve standing by the stove and cooking bacon and eggs. What really got Tony's attention was the fact he was wearing nothing but shoes and a pair of running pants that gave him a fantastic view of his ass. His eyes trailed up to his back and the genius licked his lips at the sight of those muscles rippling whenever the blonde moved to get something.
“Listen, I don't know what this whore has told you or made you pay him for his… Services, but I'll pay you double up if you let me take him and you'll never be forced to see him again, I swear.”
Even though he knew that Steve would never lay a finger on him it still brought up some bad memories of his time under his father's control, never being allowed to go out anywhere with anyone unless it was for the benefit of the company. And Steve trying to keep him from going out just hit a little close to home.
“Ana?” Tony rasped out, his voice sore from screaming so much. Was he hallucinating? Had he finally lost his mind? Because there would be no way that she would know that he was down here if Howard hadn't wanted her to.
Steve kept pounding into him, seeking his own orgasm and when Tony's walls clenched around him he released deep into his ass, filling his lover up.
That received him a slap on the back on his head and a nasty glare from Natasha. He yelped and rubbed the spot where she had hit him while pouting like a child.
Thank all of you who have stuck with me and reading this crap, it means so much to me you have no idea. I admit, I have been postponing finishing this chapter because I didn't really want it to end. I love all of you guys so much and I am so grateful for you all.
“Well he is right, thank you.” He took a small sip and let out a little moan at the taste. This was some of the best coffee he’s ever had. Steve licked his lips at the sound and trailed his eyes down Tony's throat and watches his Adam's apple bob with every swallow. The blue eyes trailed down the nicely toned chest and stopped at the hips. The sweatpants had gone down a bit, showing some of the deliciously tanned skin. Tony saw where Steve was staring and smirked behind the coffee cup.
At the comment Tony became aware of the state he was in. He looked down at his bruised and bloodied body, barely concealed by the light clothing he had been given. He didn't notice how his legs gave out and his body had come close to hitting the floor before Steve caught him around the waist and picked him up bridal style. His head was to foggy and the pain spread through him now that the adrenaline had run its course.
All Tony could think while he tried to push him off was “No! No! NO!”. Brock only laughed while lowering his hands to squeeze Tony's right asscheek painfully hard and that's when the genius remembered the glass in his left back pocket. He reached his hand down and grabbed it without Rumlow noticing and clenched his hand around it even though it was cutting his palm. He knew he had to wait until Brock was close enough to attack.
Tony shuddered and felt his knees go weak. He gulped and looked up at the taller man. Both men inches forward and just as their lips were about to meet, Tony spoke up.
Bruce stopped his attack and looked over to Tony, the boy looked scared and like he didn't quite know what to do. All his anger melted away and he looked down at Steve's face which was now bloody and bruised. He let go of the leader and stood up, slowly making his way towards Tony.
Tony and Steve just stared at each other for a whole minute afterwards. Tony with embarrassment and Steve with fear. Suddenly Tony let out a bark of laughter and reached his hand out to Steve. The blonde did not hesitate to grab it and was next to his baby at an instant and helping Tony to sit up straight. After he made sure that he was comfortable he pulled the smaller man into a hug, basically pulling him into his lap.
Steve tossed the rag on the floor before crawling under the sheets and pulling Tony closer to his body so that he was spooning him from behind.
“Don't you ever say that again. Tony is not dead. If he had been then there would have been a body, but there wasn't anyone dead at the scene. We know that HYDRA has him. We just have to keep looking and pray that we find him before it’s too late. Now shut up and go back to your research.”
“It's okay Tony, I'll promise that we’ll visit and now we can call each other all the time. And remember, if you ever need anything, just call us and we’ll be there.”
He couldn't help but think that he was right. Maybe the team would be better off without him? All he ever had to offer them was sorrow and heartache.
Steve smiled against the skin and let go of the right nipple to start with the other one. He used his right hand to stroke Tony's hard erection through his pants. He let go of the hard nipple and made his way down the chest and stomach with his lips until he reached the top of Tony's sweatpants, leaving a trail of love bites on the way. He looked up at Tony for confirmation and received a nod to continue. He slowly removed the pants and boxers in one drag, hands grasping Tony's ass on the way, earning a whimper from the genius.
“And you must be Steve that we have heard so much about,” Tiberius smiled from the floor, blood dripping from his lips “you know, Tony never shut up about you. How you would come for him, save him and make us pay. Never shut up the little shit, well, until Rumlow or I shoved a cock in his mouth or up his ass. That's probably the only thing I'm gonna miss about him you know, that tight little-”
When she reached the unconscious boy she wasted no time to turn him around and get a good look at him. He was breathing and she found a weakening pulse.
Steve couldn't help but to flicker his eyes to the brunette’s lips which said brunette noticed. They started to slowly lean forward until there was just an inch between their lips.
Steve groaned at Tony's words and and he opened the bottle, squirting down a fair amount on his fingers. He knew that Tony was a virgin and wanted to make this as painless as possible.
“Next time” Tiberius started with a glint in his eyes “I get to fuck him. You have to try his mouth anyway, it's glorious.” Brock laughed out a “sure” while he punched in the code to the door, careful to hide it from the nearly unconscious teen.
“Thank you, I hope you don't mind though. I don't know about you but I'd be a little weirded out that a guy that I have known for only a couple of days has a drawing of me.” He said with a nervous chuckle.
Tony turned his head around and threw up his breakfast which only worsened the pain in his body. Though it didn't stop him from struggling weakly when he felt hands on his shoulders.
“Well, according to Phil you didn't hit any major arteries so he couldn't bleed out, though he did faint so that's probably why you thought he was dead. He woke up a while after you left and tried to get away from the base, probably because Schmidt would have his head for losing you. Though he didn't make it very far because of the explosion, burned half his body, he was unconscious when Phil found him.”
“Aw, come on Tony! I'm a changed man I promise! And I can give you so much more than whoever it is you're with now and I know you miss me Tony. Why else would you have agreed to meet me, huh? I know you like playing hard to get but I mean, come on? We were good together, great in fact and I know that you want it back just as much as I do!”
I know, I know, please don't hate me. I've been really trying to write this but I have never been so stressed in my life like I am right now. I had two major tests to study for (and my asshole teachers decided to put them on the same day) and I have been focusing so much on them so I didn't have time to write this, but now the tests are over and I finally had some time to finish this chapter and it turned out pretty good if I get to say so myself and it's longer than my other ones.
Steve was licking, sucking and scraping his teeth gently on Tony's hole, trying to drag out as many of those beautiful moans as possible from the younger man. He smiled when a particularly loud one emerged from his lover when he dipped his tongue in the hole. He kept twirling it around until Tony was shaking with pleasure under him and he reluctantly removed himself.
Walking out of the shop Tony was met with rain pouring down on him. He groaned and tightened his jacket around him and made his way home.
“Why don't we do something about that then?” Came Tony's panting response. The panting was soon turned into a shriek as Steve lifted him up by his ass. Steve chuckled in his ear and started to carry him up the stairs and to their room. It took a while for them to reach the room since Steve stopped once in awhile to push Tony against a wall and kiss him senseless and rub their hard on’s against each other.
“Don't worry about it Steve, I get it. I'm just messing with you. It's hilarious how you, the great Captain of the Avengers, have been reduced into a blushing, sappy mother hen after getting a boyfriend.”
Tony tried to keep a straight face and succeeded. For about two seconds. Then he burst out laughing, the team not far behind.
After catching his breath he slowly pulled out which earned him a wince from the genius and took a few seconds to admire the state of his victim.
Pain exploded in his head and stars filled his vision. He was pretty sure that he blacked out for a while because when he came back to it he was stripped down to nothing but his boxers.
When those night terrors occurred, Steve would often find Tony either tinkering with one of his bots or in the music room in his pajamas and playing a sad tune on the piano with trembling fingers.
Tony couldn't help it, seeing what could easily be described as his worst nightmare in front of him and being completely alone. He screamed.
“That's his natural voice, and yes, he really talks like that. Thor is originally from Norway and hasn't really adapted to how Americans talks.” Which received a large grin from Thor.
Bruce only smiled sadly and led the younger one to sit down on one of the couches and sat next to him. Steve followed close behind and sat down on the other side of the young genius who just gave him a smile that he couldn't help but return. If anyone noticed any of this they didn't mention it.
Steve let his eyes trail from the visible collarbones, up the naturally tanned skin of his neck and then across his face. His eyes swept across the sleeping figures face, across the eyes he knew were brown with a beautiful whisky shade, long lashes were resting on his cheeks, cute little nose, thick black curls on the top of his head. But the most capturing feature of all was the boy's lips, they were beautiful and soft looking and Steve wondered how they would feel against his own.
They fell asleep like that once more and didn't wake up again until Jarvis came in with a tray of food
The all too familiar sound of a slap echoed through the room and Natasha was staring at her boyfriend in annoyance while he rubbed the back of his head.
Tony stood there for a while, just staring at the door where Ana had been, thinking that it was finally over. Steve was coming for him.
The words caused Ty's smile to stiffen and his shoulders to tense slightly. He covered it up with a chuckle before opening his mouth.
“What? I mean it. If he hurts you I will kill him in the most painful way possible, co-signed by Pepper.” Tony looked over at Pepper who just smiled innocently at him and he turned his head back to Rhodey. His friend's expression had turned into a sad one and he sighed deeply. “I'm tired of you being hurt Tones. You have gone through so much and you deserve to be happy.”
“Whatever you say boy, anyway I got a meeting with the board in an hour. Now, Rumlow and Stone here have agreed to help me discipline you” he said and gave a pointed look to his son “by any means necessary.”
“Coulson, you and your team go check for survivors! I want them alive! They are gonna pay for this!!”
He hit his head very hard but we haven't been able to discover any permanent damages so far, we will be able to know more when he wakes up.-”
Worst of all was the water boarding. The feeling of ice cold water hitting him in the face, feeling like his lungs were on fire because of the lack of oxygen while he was pressed down in the water only to be pulled up just when he was about to pass out and to repeat the process, over and over and over again.
“Lehnsherr, you and your men go and make sure that no entrance is left unsupervised, we'll go get Tony.” Erik nodded and signaled for his men to follow him. Bucky turned to Steve who was getting up from the floor, splatters of blood on his face and shirt from when Bucky had shot Rumlow.
“Tiberius! I think he drugged Tony, he was basically unconscious when he dragged him out! He threw him in the car with someone else in and they drove away, I tried to stop them Stevie I really did, I'm sorry, I'm so fucking sorry! This is my fault!” Tears were now streaming down Bucky’s face and he was furiously wiping them away with his prosthetics. He would never forget what had happened the last time Tony was kidnapped and he was terrified of what would happen this time around.
While Tony was preparing the pan he felt something crack against the back of his head and something sticky run down his neck. He brought his hand up there and dragged his fingers through the substance before bringing it back so that he could see it. His fingers were covered in egg and he shuddered when he felt it run down under his shirt and down his back.
“Oh Clint, we all know that Bruce's favorite is Tony. He has some weird, mystical power that makes him irresistible. Just look at Steve! Our brave and fearless leader turns into a gooey mess and I'm pretty sure that Natasha would stab everyone in here if something happened to her small person.”
They had arrived at the Hellfire club approximately fifteen minutes earlier and were led to a table where Erik Lehnsherr was already waiting for them with his second in commands/bodyguards Raven and Azazel standing on either side of him with crossed arms but not in a threatening manner. They have known each other for a while and knew that they could trust the Avengers. The club was not open yet since it was still daytime but a few workers/members of the Brotherhood were already there preparing for the eventful evening.
Tony beamed and put the drawing down before joining Steve on the bed and cuddling closer to him. Steve in return wrapped his own arms protectively around the teen. They spent the whole afternoon like that, just talking, getting to know each other, exchanging small kisses and just enjoying each others company until Thor came knocking, letting them know that dinner was ready.
Steve put him down when they reached the bedrooms and told him to get cleaned up so that they could get breakfast for real before giving him a peck on the cheek.
“Calm down, we won't let anything happen to him. But now I'm wondering, how did you even end up with the kid, you haven't talked about him that much before?”
Tony cut himself off with a sob and Steve ran his hand across his back, trying to soothe him. Tony swallowed and continued.
He started by getting DUM-E to his charging station and walked over to his closet and picked out a pair of old jeans and a dark red T-shirt. He took his clothes and went to his bathroom to change. He then picked up his hairbrush and tried to tame his wild bed head to little avail before putting it down and looked into the mirror. He was met by dark purple bags underneath his whiskey brown eyes since he hadn't slept that night, instead he had had been up until 5 a.m working on his AI before he passed out from exhaustion. He had been so close to finish it that he hadn't even thought about sleep.
After around twenty minutes of patching his friend up, Bruce had put him on some painkillers and gone to the living room where the rest of the team had assembled.
Tony gave a full body shudder when he came in his pants, Steve following right behind. They both held that position, panting as they tried to catch their breaths. Tony leaned forward and pressed a small kiss to Steve’s lips which he happily returned.
He loved the Avengers dearly, they were his family, and he knew they loved him back just as much. Everything was great, especially things between him and Steve.
Tony felt the pain in his ass more than the rest of his body and he could feel the blood slowly running down the crack.
He and Ty had been dating for about a year in college before Tony decided to run away from his abusive father. He had come to Ty’s apartment, seeking for shelter but the blonde had just turned his back at Tony, saying that he was just overreacting and that he needed to stop being so ungrateful and basically shut the door in the brunettes face. Tony had the cut off all types of contact with his now ex boyfriend and hadn't seen him since, at least until now that is.
Tony gave a tired smile to his lover. Seeing Ty again had brought back memories from the time he had run away. The feelings of betrayal, sadness, fear and hopelessness had all come crashing back along with them and it had left Tony feeling emotionally drained for the day. And the fact that he had to see Ty again in the afternoon the same day just left him feeling anxious and dreadful.
Steve was running through the maze that was the Stark mansion with Bucky and Bruce on either side of him, shooting down enemies left and right, leaving a trail of bloody corpses after them them.
Brock just kept punching and kicking him wherever he could reach before suddenly stopping. Tony spit out the blood in his mouth and looked up at the other man. Brock had an evil grin across his face and the words that came out of his mouth sent dread spreading through Tony's body.
The first thing Tony felt when he woke up was the pounding headache and the light that passed his closed eyelids did nothing to help the situation. The second thing he felt was the hand clutching his own. He groaned and tried to blink his eyes open.
And now his sweetheart was in surgery, trying to stay alive. All because Steve couldn't keep him safe.
Steve woke up by a loud scream. He shot up from his bed and put his fists up in a fighting stance. Looking around him he saw no one and slowly put his hands down. Just as he was about to dismiss it as an act by his imagination and head back to bed, another scream was heard, this time coming from outside his bedroom door. He ran out in only his pajama pants to the direction of the terrified shout and stopped in front of Tony's door where the boy was still screaming. The rest of the team plus Mr and Mrs Jarvis came out of their rooms looking worried and alert. He just shook his head and gestured for them to go back to sleep and they reluctantly obeyed. He turned back to the door and opened it, the sight he was met by would never cease to break his heart.
Bruce looked them over and took in their flushed faces and Steve's arm wrapped around Tony's waist just as the other Avengers came out the door to see what all the commotion was about. The older scientists face turned red but not from embarrassment, but from anger.
At the end of his rant Tony had tears streaming down his face and he was shaking. He couldn't get a sound out, only a whimper when his father slapped him hard before dragging him out of the bathroom by his bruising arm.
Soooooo sorry for the wait! I've had some trouble with this chapter and I'm not 100% happy with it. Hopefully next chapter will be better and I'd love to hear your opinions in the comment section. <3
“Hey, hey, it's ok now. He's dead, he can't hurt you, you will never see him again. Just take a deep breath, that's it Doll, come on.”
The team took the sight in of the burning building and the destroyed vehicles surrounding it. Body parts were littered around them and the Avengers felt their stomachs turn at the thought of Tony being one of them.
“Take care, Tones. I mean it. And remember, if tall, blonde and handsome doesn't treat you right, I'll kick his ass.”
When he didn't hear a reply he turned towards Tony and saw that he was already staring at him with a soft, loving smile.
Everyone in the living room looked at each other in disbelief for a moment until Bucky shrugged and clapped Steve on the back.
The bot just beeped and Tony gave a slight chuckle before going over to his bed where a duffle bag lied. He opened it and took out his toothbrush, a pair of clean boxers, pajama pants and an old T-Shirt before heading towards the fancy bathroom that was connected to his room, he decided to save the unpacking to the next day. The whole mansion reminded him a bit of his old house, except that this one was filled with warmth, love and family while the old one only contained coldness and loneliness if you didn't count the loving butler that had taken care of him his whole life (he made a mental note to call Jarvis when he got the chance). With the Avengers, Tony felt safe, even though he had only known them for barely a day. They had offered him protection and had opened their home to him and Bruce. In the Stark mansion he had to look over his shoulder all the time out of fear that his father would stand there, ready to beat him until he passed out for no reason at all. On the very few occasions when he saw his mother she was always holding a bottle, whether it was filled with alcohol or pills didn't even matter. She wouldn't even acknowledge him.
After a second he shrugged and went inside the building, figuring his roommate probably also finished early today.
