It had been a month since that fateful night when the maddest man Sherlock had ever come in contact with escaped. 32 days, actually. And Sherlock had spent every single one of them pondering what in the hell it was about John Watson that had caused him to care.  John was kind, sure. But Sherlock had known kind men before. Kindness never seemed to matter to Sherlock, it was usually irrelevant to the facts of the case whether or not the victim or the suspect or Sherlock himself were kind. And John was smart. As smart as any ordinary man could be, at least. He was a wonderful doctor who knew so much about the human body. He would have to, to piece together men broken and bloody and burned by war. But Sherlock reckoned he could do the same if he'd ever felt the inclination to attend medical school. John was loyal, loyal to a fault really. Another trait Sherlock had never felt necessary. But he had decided he rather liked having someone around that was so loyal to him.  It made him feel more responsibility to be careful in regards to his own safety. So how could an ordinary man like John Watson with perfectly ordinary traits, cause Sherlock so much concern that he'd let Moriarty win the game and get away?
"No. No this is certainly not something I ever foresaw. So what do we do?". John suddenly looked so sad, Sherlock wanted to hug him. Well, at least now I can explain that feeling, he thought.  "Sherlock, I don't think there is anything we can do.  I care for you, very deeply.  More deeply than I care to admit.  But this....this isn't in either of us to follow through with it.  I don't think I can be in a relatioship with a man. And I don't think you can be in a relationship with anybody. You said it yourself...you're not a sexual person. I am, though. I love sex. I love sex with women. I don't know if I could ever have sex with a man and I know you couldn't. I think this is something you and I need to learn to get over. Whatever it is between us, we need to get over it. I think identifying it is a good start on that road.". Sherlock took a step back. He knew John was right. John was a good man. He deserved to be with someone who could make him happy, not a highly functioning sociopath. "Yes, John. That is precisely what we need to do. Put it out of our minds."  "Right. And you! You will not be sticking any more needles into yourself to achieve that, do you hear me?" Sherlock went to protest, to tell him that it really was none of his concern but John wouldn't have it. "No! No more heroin or so help me, Sherlock, I will call Mycroft. I will call him and I will tell him everything and I will tell him to call your Mummy and tell her and she will come and they will take you somewhere where you won't be able to hurt yourself anymore." With that, John went into his room and did not reemerge.
"Hmm? Drunk? Oh, yes! I...am..drunk. Excellent deduction, John. I fancied a drink or two down the pub, I did. Now, if you'll excuse me, I am going to go have a bath." Sherlock removed his jacket, forgetting entirely the bruise blackening on his arm. "Sherlock, what the hell is that?" John asked, grabbing hold of Sherlock's wrist to turn him round. "I gave blood." "You got drunk and gave blood? Are they taking alcohol laced blood now?" "No. I gave blood, then I went down the pub." "Well, there you go, you bloody git! No wonder you got drunk off one or two drinks. You're not supposed to drink after giving blood!"
"John, baby, you have to breathe." John wasn't sure if he was more surprised by the fact that Sherlock Fucking Holmes had just called him "baby" or if it was the fact that somehow, Sherlock had become the one knowledgeable in the ways of intercourse. Either way he turned around and kissed him, letting his tongue slide over his and moaning deep into his mouth. Now it was his turn for his erection to flag. But as soon as Sherlock relaxed into his kiss and started to stroke him again, it was back. John broke the kiss and rolled back over, pulled his knee up again and said "I'm ready. Take me, Sherlock."
For Sherlock's part, he was shockingly at ease that day. He smoked his cigarettes and played his violin. He spent some time blogging about skin samples Molly had gifted him. He spent some time reading John's blog. His assessment of The Woman couldn't be more off base. He seemed to think Sherlock had loved her, or at the very least, wanted her body. He had to understand now that neither of those things were true. Sherlock was fascinated with her open sexuality the way a person would be fascinated by an alien. He wanted to preserve her so he could study her. Now he knows that somewhere inside his vast and impressive mind, he was inching ever closer to John. His body and his hormones were pushing him to study Irene Adler and her ways of seduction long before his brain caught up. It upset him to think about such primal urges overpowering his mind so he put the computer away and went back to the violin, anxiously awaiting John's footsteps on the stairs.
"Endless apologies, Doctor Watson. I shall keep that in mind." And with that, Sherlock slowly made his way toward the bath.
"I don't think He has anything to do with this, John, you should beware of such blasphemy in such a morally compromising situation," Sherlock said, completely breathlessly. "Oh, sod him and his morals," John said as Sherlock worked his cock with long, soft fingers. "Oh God. Sherlock, this is a bit embarrassing but I don't think I'm going to last long." He whined then as Sherlock's finger, quite on accident, brushed his perineum. Sherlock immediately withdrew his hand and apologized. "Sherlock, Sherlock, no. It's okay." He pulled his own hand from Sherlock's pants and held his face in them. "No part of my body is off limits to you any more. I want you. All of you. Everywhere."
Sherlock took John's hand and kissed his fingers, all the while maintaining eye contact and sliding his own hand down his stomach and over the top of his boxers to grasp himself. His eyes closed and he palmed himself gently, allowing the silk to slide over his member. He opened his eyes again and looked at John as his breath started to quicken. John seized his mouth. He kissed Sherlock hard and bit his lip, Sherlock opened his mouth as his hand quickened its pace and he began to tremble. All of a sudden, John grabbed his hand and said "Let me." Sherlock pulled his hand away.
John came in the door, then, jarring Sherlock.  That's another new development, Sherlock observed. John's absence and reappearance were something that usually went by Sherlock unnoticed. But ever since that night, John's absence was accutely felt and his reappearance brought a sense of relief. That was a fact that did not go unnoticed. John's whereabouts were at the forefront of Sherlock's mind, where James Moriarty ought to be instead. "I got the butter you like, even though I find it quite repulsive," John said, setting the shopping on the floor of the kitchen because the counters were full with Sherlock's experiments. "I also got you some nicotine patches. You were doing so well, why'd you take up the smoking again?" Thoughtful, Sherlock thought. I'll add that to my considerations concerning John. No. This had to stop. He had to get his mind off John. And when you're a genius who makes deductions constantly and find it impossible to stop, there is only one way to clear your mind. Without a word to John, Sherlock grabbed his coat and headed out the door.
"How?" Sherlock whispered, not leaving his spot on his neck. "I... I want you. Inside me. I want us to lose our virginity, fully, to eachother." "You're not a virgin, John." Sherlock wasn't sure if he was technically a virgin now either. Technically, he'd never stuck his cock in anything so he guessed he was. "I am there," John said. And he meant it. He wanted Sherlock's first time penetrating someone to be his first time being penetrated. He was ready.
From the very moment he tore that bomb off John, from the very moment he felt that wave of relief wash over him, Sherlock knew something had changed. Sherlock had never much cared for people. In fact, he never cared for people for at all.  All Sherlock cared about was his work. Oh, John liked to think he saw some humanity in Sherlock.  Liked to think Sherlock cared for the people whose lives he saved.  But that wasn't about saving lives, it was about the Game.  But when John stepped out onto that pool deck and revealed the bomb Moriarty had strapped to his chest, concern hit Sherlock like a brick wall. He could have killed Moriarty thirty different ways, he would have. But John's certain death made him hesitate, and that hesitation allowed Moriarty to escape. Why? Why did Sherlock care whether John Watson lived or died?
He pushed Sherlock towards the bed until he could sit, which he did, and John straddled him once more. This time, Sherlock took an active part in the game. He quickly grabbed John by the waist, kissed him hard and fast, and flipped him over so that he was laying on his back with Sherlock hovering over him. '"Wow," he said. Sherlock didn't answer but his eyes said "My turn" as he began to explore John's front with his mouth. Once again, John was shocked to think he'd never done anything like this before. But Sherlock was of course a quick study. He licked John's rib cage, making him gasp and squirm, he suckled at his collarbone and ran his hands down and across his stomach. When he reached John's waistline, he moved his mouth to John's throat, bit and sucked and licked there, then said "Do you want me to take these off? Looks like something is trying desperately to get out." "God, yes, please," John replied on a sigh and Sherlock wasted no time. He popped the button with one hand, all the while still applying so much suction to John's neck he knew he'd have a hickey. He didn't care. He was moaning and writhing under Sherlock and praying to God the hand that was now unzipping his fly would just press down a bit harder. But Sherlock was being very careful. He didn't want to touch John there. Not yet. He was realizing that this build up inside them both was as pleasurable as he had heard sex was, and he wanted to draw it out as long as they both could stand it. Sherlock stood and grasped John's trousers, John lifted his hips and allowed him to pull them off. Then he reached for Sherlock's button and said "May I?" He nodded.
"Sherlock...I..." John cleared his throat and tried again. "I want to completely eliminate talk of sex before its proper time, but in order to do that, I need to know: why were you so repulsed by what you watched this morning?" Sherlock blinked. He thought that conversation was over. But he thought he understood why John was asking. "I thought sex was supposed to be about love." "It is." "But those men did not love eachother. They degraded eachother. The common theme in every video I watched was degredation, and pain." "Pain?" "Yes. Pain in the title, in the descriptions. In the dialogue. They all seemed to be in pain and they enjoyed it. They said filthy things to eachother. There was no evidence of love in any of it. It was sweaty and loud and repulsive. The camera shots and the zooms. It was all incredibly degrading. If that is what sex is, I have to wonder why people enjoy it so." John was a bit taken aback. This is why he didn't want Sherlock watching porn to learn what was expected of him. Because John did not expect him to be a porn star. And he certainly hoped nobody expected that of him because he was not. John liked to make love. Yes, ofcoarse, he could get a little wild. Drunk sex, angry sex, wild passionate first time meeting someone in a bar sex. He'd had it all. But Sherlock was right, what people did in porn had nothing to do with love. "Sherlock, it won't be that way with us. It isn't like that for most people. Those videos....they're made with wanking in mind. The angles, the zooms...they're not realistic. And no, those people are not in love. They are actors, getting paid. Most of the time they meet five minutes before stuffing their cocks in eachother's mouths. That's why they're so degrading to eachother. Because they are degraded. And because people...some people...like that. The viewers, that is. It helps get them off."
"John...I...I think you must be mistaken." "Sherlock, I'm not gay." At this, Sherlock reddened again. Not from embarassment now but anger.  "Yes! Yes, I know! You've made it abundantly clear to anyone at all who will listen! For the record, neither am I! I'm not even straight! I'm not bisexual or transsexual or trysexual or sexual in any way! Yet here I am with you telling me that I like you but that you're not gay! So thankyou, very much, for pointing out two very useless pieces of information to me that I will now have to delete from my hard drive to make room for more important matters. Good day!" And he stood and made his way for the door.
Sherlock froze. "Excuse me?" "Fuck me, Sherlock. Fuck me now. Please, God, I wanna feel you fuck me." Sherlock could barely control himself at John's words. He began to move a little faster, a little harder, pulling out a little farther and plunging in a little deeper. But John just said "Fuck me, fuck me, fuck me," over and over. Sherlock grabbed his hip tight enough to surely leave bruises, which he couldn't wait to see, and pressed him further onto his stomach. He shifted his weight so he could now take John's hips in both hands and pulled John's ass, cock still nestled tightly inside, up to his pelvis. John groaned and pressed back and said "God, yes, fuck me!" He began to ride him, John's ass quivering beneath him, sweating, and moaning at the feel of his cock in a vice. John kept a steady stream of profanities as Sherlock felt his climax coming on and he reached around and took John in his hand. John slapped it away and said "I wanna come on your cock. I know I can." "Oh God, yes. Baby. Yes. Please." He really didn't know why he kept calling John baby, but it seemed to work for both of them. He planted his foot again on the mattress and pressed John down into it, driving into him now relentlessly. The sound of skin slapping against skin filled the room as did the smell of sweat and cum and something Sherlock couldn't place and he closed his eyes and breathed in through his nose and out through his mouth as he pounded into the man he realized now he would die for.
"I have to get ready for work," he replied and tried to grab the bag on his way past. Sherlock was already there. "Sherlock, stop!" He froze, about to open the bag. John reached out and took it from him. "I'm going to work. I'm taking this with me so don't even think about destroying my bedroom in your search." John pointed his finger at him and gave him his most serious "I mean it, Sherlock" look.
John chuckled and laid out next to Sherlock. Sherlock stared down at him wondering what was to come next. "Um, John, I...I don't know how to do this." "Ssshhh...Sherlock, I just want to kiss you some more. In a more comfortable position. Here, lie down." John turned over on his left side and Sherlock lay down on his right. John scooted as close to Sherlock as he could get, and very suddenly thrust his leg between Sherlock's. He threw one arm across Sherlock's waist and pulled him in for a deep kiss. Sherlock moaned as John thrust his tongue into Sherlock's mouth and licked the roof. He couldn't believe this was happening. 24 hours ago he was in a heroin induced slumber trying to shake John Watson from his mind and now he was curled up in bed with him, practically grinding his leg with his tongue in his mouth. His cock stirred. John definitely felt that and rubbed his leg unwittingly against it. Sherlock bucked and John groaned. Once again he pulled away. "Sherlock, I...I..."  "Hush. No need. I think we should take this very slowly." With that, John sat up. "I think I should go to my room before things get a little out of control here."
Sherlock was panting now, and he suddenly felt the need to grab onto something, to regain some sense of control. He took hold of John's hair, as gently as he could manage, and pulled him back up to plunder his mouth. The kisses grew fevered, now, both of them breathing hard through their noses as they fought for control. Sherlock opened his mouth wide and John went in like he was invading Afghanistan again. He started to run his hands through Sherlock's curls, and Sherlock hissed when he gave a tug. He gave a tug on John's hair in return and John moaned and broke away, breathing so hard Sherlock was slightly concerned. "Sherlock, my God. I love you," and he pressed his groin hard into Sherlock and rocked against him. Sherlock felt John's erection against his own and said "John, I think we should take this to a larger surface."
This takes place between Scandal in Belgravia and the Hounds of Baskerville, roughly. I don't want to write about Sherlock jumping off a building and John's immense grief over that so my story will end before that. Hope you enjoy!
Sherlock didn't quite know what to say. To be perfectly honest, he was still trying to comprehend the fact that they were having this conversation. Everything he thought he knew about himself had been flipped over and shaken in the coarse of just a few days. These sort of talks, these feelings of uncertainty, of selfconciousness  and longing and lust were exactly what he had been trying to avoid these last 35 years. He did know that John had ben right. He was very keen on him. He did care for John in a way he had never cared for anyone before. And that was worth some further investigation. It didn't matter why he had not seen it sooner, he saw it now.
The needle shook a bit on the way into his arm, leaving a slight bruise. He would have to remember to come up with a story for that later. For now, he was reveling in the feeling of heroin coarsing through his veins. More importantly, in the feeling of it coating his brain. For the first time in 32 days, Sherlock could focus on important matters, not John Wats-his-name. Like, the way his feet felt funny when they hit the pavement. Or the way home seemed much further away than he remembered. Or how nice John's hair looked in the mornings. No. That wasn't right, was it? Damn!
"Why?" John asked, clearly upset.  "Because I have been walking through London for hours and I am parched."  "No. I want to know why, Sherlock. Why are you doing this to yourself? Why didn't you come to me? I'm a doctor, I have experience with this. I did a short residency in a drug facility I could have helped." Upon hearing this, Sherlock froze.  He slowly turned back towards John, forgetting the tea and feeling his lip curl into a snarl.  "Why? You want to know why? And you think you could have helped? HA! John Watson, I believe with all my heart that you're the last person in the world that could help. Not that I needed any. And as for why, if you want to know that you need only look into a mirror because you, John, are why!!!"
He thought back over every second of their friendship so far.  There were no signs of anything of this ridiculous nature forming inside him.  How had this happened?  John sat staring at Sherlock and Sherlock felt that blush creeping up his face again.  No.  No.  Sherlock Holmes does not do this. Sherlock Holmes does not feel attraction. Although, he would have to say that if he did have to feel it, someone as kind and caring and just plain old good as John would be his preference. Not to mention the fact that although Sherlock was often ignorant of beauty, he was not ignorant of John's. It wasn't so much the physical features of his new and only friend, but the way he held himself, the way he respected those around him in a way Sherlock never could.  Stop it! No! This sort of feeling is for ordinary people and why is John staring at you? Oh....you still haven't responded.
When he got home, he could hear the violin. As soon as the third step creaked, though, the music stopped. "He's waiting for me," he thought with some mild satisfaction. He walked into the flat and immediately wrinkled his nose. "Jesus, Sherlock! Have you gone and smoked the whole pack? You could have at least opened a window! Mrs. Hudson is going to kill you!" "Hudders won't even know, she's taken up with that butcher again. Won't be home for a few days." John set the bag of food on the table and turned to his....oh. is Sherlock his boyfriend now? No, thoughts like that would have to wait until later. He wanted to throttle Sherlock right now. Throttle him or snog him? Well, he wasn't going to snog him when he was sure his mouth tasted like an ashtray. But he would settle for a quick kiss, which he gave, only after opening TWO windows.
So while Sherlock waited for John to come home so that he could pounce on him and demand some nicotine, he decided to play his violin. Composing helped him get lost and would stave the craving a bit.
"Fine, John. Whatever you say," Sherlock said as he dashed off the couch, fingers shaking as he tore open the pack and found his lighter hidden under the skull. He lit the cigarette, closed his eyes, inhaled deeply, and as he exhaled he fixed John with an absolutely lust filled gaze. John swallowed. "So what else did you buy at the store?" Sherlock said in a low velvety voice.
John sat up, suddenly acutely aware of their surroundings again. He was nervous again. Silly, he thought. This is what we both want. "Are you sure? We can stay right here and just do this forever if you want." "I do not want that. I want you." That was all he needed to hear. He stood up and helped Sherlock to his feet, kissing him again and running his hands across the wide expanse of back muscles he could finally reach. He stood on his tiptoes and kissed Sherlock, long and sweet, and said "Then lead the way."
They hadn't done this before. John had kept his kisses strictly to Sherlock's mouth and except for that one time, which he chose not to think about, had kept his hands above Sherlock's waist. Sherlock simply nuzzled into John's hair in confirmation and John continued his journey across his throat and collarbones. When he reached the point the shirt would stretch no further he asked "Can I take this off?" Sherlock hesitated. He wasn't sure why he felt so odd when John's skin pressed against his. It was sort of like forgetting deodorant, the odd friction. But he knew this wasn't going to go far at all without removing some clothing, so he nodded and lifted his arms. John removed his shirt slowly, like he was unveiling some great statue. He looked Sherlock over, whispered "My God" and continued his ministrations on his newly exposed skin. The feeling was incredible. As it turns out, when the two bodies of skin are slightly sheened in sweat, they slide much easier across eachother. John kissed and sucked and bit and licked at Sherlock's skin like it was far more delicious than the dinner they had just consumed. Sherlock's breath was coming faster and faster as John worked his way down to his stomach. He paused there, right at the top of the line of hair that lead into Sherlock's trousers. He looked up at Shelock and smiled. "Never been with anyone with a happy trail," he said with a wink and very carefully ran his tongue from Sherlock's waistline to the top of the "happy trail." Sherlock arched his back and hissed through his teeth and John grinned like the Cheshire Cat. It was the most erotic thing he. had. ever. seen.
"So you made me brush my teeth just so we could indulge in marinara and garlic?" he asked with a raised brow. John paused with his fork halfway to his mouth and laughed. "Hadn't thought of that. I...um...I thought Giovanni's would be...kind of...romantic? Because...well..." "Ah. Yes. Our first dinner together." "Our first case." "Yes." Sherlock smiled and took a big bite of the garlic bread. Very romantic, indeed.
Sherlock rolled over on top of John and said "You're sure? We could always...I mean...you could get your cock in me?" John moaned and rolled his hips up against Sherlock. "That sounds lovely," he said, "and I will. But tonight, you're having my virginity, and I'm having yours."
As soon as he was out of sight, John grabbed his purchases from this morning from his bag. He ran to his room and tossed the lube in the drawer next to his condoms. He doubted they'd need those things tonight but as a doctor and a veteran he knew it was better safe than sorry. He went back to the living room and quickly began to set up and light the candles. Sherlock reemerged, freshly shaven, too, and gave John a winning smile. "I sure hope my mouth is now to your satisfaction." John rolled his eyes and continued to light the candles. When he was finished, he opened the containers of food and plopped the spaghetti onto two plates, unwrapped the garlic bread, and sat down on the couch next to Sherlock, handing him his dinner.
Sorry it took so long, so many chapters, but let's be real. Our boys have way too many neuroses to just jump in the sack together.
Sherlock wasn't quite sure he'd ever get used to John saying things like that, not to him, but he wasn't about to let it go to waste. He leaned down and gently pressed his lips against John's. John opened his mouth and sighed and Sherlock took the opportunity caress John's tongue with his own and John groaned, leaning up into the kiss. Sherlock pushed John back down with his mouth and held him there, rubbing his hands over Johns stomach and snogging him until John felt like he couldn't breathe. John liftd his hand and pushed Sherlock back. When the kiss broke, he sat up and took a deep breath, trying to catch his breath. His cheeks were flushed and his hair was mussed and he felt absolutely like his whole body had turned to jello. How can a man who has never done this before be so good at it? John leaned over and grabbed hold of Sherlock's face, staring into his sky blue eyes. "Are we really doing this, you and I?" "We're really snogging, if thats is what you mean. Really, John, you are very obvious, sometimes." John smiled at that. "Not what I meant, Sherlock. I meant this...relationship. Is this really happening?" "Clearly. Now do that thing with my bottom lip."
"So...what brings you here today, John?" "Short version? Yesterday I found out my best friend is on heroin again and that I am the reason why. I am the reason why because he is keen on me and wasn't actually aware of it until he spelled it out for me and then I spelled it out for him. I also realized that I am quite keen on him and we snogged last night and it scares me and I know it scares him. And I think he may want to have sex because I caught him watching gay porn but he said it disgusts him so maybe he doesn't and both those ideas scare me, too." John sat back and took a deep breath while his therapist calmly took all of that in. "So, what you're telling me is that you've discovered an interest in Sherlock and it frightens you because he's a man?" "Yes." "Why?" "Because I'm straight." "John, it isn't about gay or straight. You don't have to tape a label on yourself and stay true to it every day of your life. Sherlock is your best friend. You care for him. He cares for you. Your life has been better, you have been better, since you met him. He gives you a sense of purpose again. He takes you on adventures, keeps you on your toes in a way you have missed since leaving the Army. He makes you laugh. He makes you want to learn more about him. It is only natural that feelings would develop. And if they aren't completely plutonic feelings? Then that is natural, too. People become attracted to people and it doesn't always make sense. A tall man may fall in love with a dwarf. A correctional officer may fall in love with her prisoner. A man may fall in love with his sociopath of a flatmate. Who is also a man. These things happen. If he loves you back, and you can see a future in it, I urge you to give it a shot."
He didn't need to be told twice. He covered John's body with his own and started to sink in, so slowly the muscles in his thighs and arms were shaking with the effort. John maoned the whole time, one long "Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh"
A few hours later, Sherlock returned home hoping that John had just forgotten the whole thing. No such luck, he thought as soon as he walked in and found John facing the door, obviously intent on pickng up where they had left off.
He spread Sherlock's legs, then, pushed his knees up and apart. Sherlock looked apprehensive but John just smiled at him. "I've never done this, didn't think I ever would want to, but I do. If I'm bad at it, I promise I won't get mad if you say so." And without another word of warning, he lowered his head and took Sherlock in his mouth.
John picked up the bottle of lube and applied it once more to his fingers. "Do you want to watch?" Sherlock shook his head and a muffled "Not just yet." came from beneath the pillow. Good. He wasnt entirely certain what he should do next and he didn't need curious eyes observing his process. He laid down on his belly between Sherlock's legs, spread one glorious looking cheek to the side, once again took his cock in his mouth, and as he pressed down, he gently began to rub his finger against Sherlock's rim. "Oh, oh, God, John. Oh, God." He heard from under the pillow. He made a humming noise in the back of his throat, where the head of Sherlock's cock was just nudging his soft palate. He lifted up, swirled his tongue over the head, and as he went down again he pressed his middle finger inside. God it was tight. Tighter than he'd expected.
"It's for a case," Sherlock said again. John grinned and Sherlock, who had been returning to his natural shade, reddened again. "It isn't what you think." "I think you got a litle turned on last night and needed a wank." "John, I told you not to be so crass. Or repulsive. I would never 'wank' to that disgusting video."
Sherlock was really glad that conversation was over. It wasn't like he hadn't started contemplating sex with John, and he wasn't ignorant. He knew a lot about the subject. He knew a lot about a lot of things. But talking about it this way, with John, in a not so hypothetical manner, was a bit more than he was ready for. Snogging, though, he liked that. He never thought he would but when John pulled his lip into his mouth, his whole body tingled. It reminded him of...no. Probably shouldn't think about that. It would make him want it and that would make John furious. No, much better to settle for kissing John.
Sherlock didn't know what to say. John had told him once that if he were too scared to be the one to...what's a good word?...catch?....that he would go first but Sherlock had never been able to envision John spreading his legs or bending over for him. The man had spent the last two years emphatically telling everyone within shouting range that he was "NOT GAY!" Naturally in the last few weeks he had assumed John would stop shouting that out at regular intervals, he assumed John would condescend to bending Sherlock over some surface or another, but he did not think this could ever be something he'd want, to take Sherlock inside himself.
Sherlock sat in his apartment at 221B Baker Street, cigarette burning in his hand, staring at John's empty chair. John was out doing the shopping, which he always did when Sherlock was like this: sitting there, staring at nothing, thinking.  Sherlock had been doing that a lot lately. John assumed that Sherlock was considering Moriarty. Considering how to get the epitome of evil genius back into their grasp. He had no idea that in fact, he was the subject of Sherlock's obsession. That these new and horrible feelings of concern over someone's safety, his safety, were driving the genius mad. No. This was no good. Think, Sherlock, think! Why is John's saferty so important all of a sudden?
That whole day at the surgery, John was very unfocused. He knew tonight would be a major turning point in Sherlock's life. He had already had his when he told Sherlock he loved him. For him, things were settled. But Sherlock could still bolt if things didn't go right. Were they moving too fast? No. He decided as such this morning. He wanted Sherlock, badly. He was scared, but he knew once he had Sherlock naked in his bed, nature would take over. For him. Who knows what kind of natures Sherlock had?
"Oh my God!" John shouted, completely by accident. Sherlock jumped about ten feet in the air, dropped his cigarette, knocked over the computer and pulled the headphones out in the process. The sound of two men very engrossed in eachother's penises filled the air and John scrambled to turn it off. Sherlock stood there, a very pretty shade of red coloring every inch of flesh John could see. Once the computer was fully off (John had removed the battery) and Sherlock's cigarette was removed from the floor where it was burning a hole in the linoleum, they stood awkwardly for a moment, refusing to look at eachother. Then they both spoke at once.
John let go of Sherlock completely and rolled onto his back. The cum on his stomach was cooling and felt like a loogie sitting on his skin, so he grabbed his tee shirt and wiped it off, tending to Sherlock's stomach as well. Sherlock, for his part, was staring at the ceiling with wide eyes and a smile plastered on his face as he caught his breath. To be honest, John had hurt him just a little, and he predicted it would be a little sore later, but that was his first orgasm in fifteen years, and by God, it was the most intense and amazing moment of his life. He could see stars.
This is when he realized his Sherlock was a definite Back Archer. With a hiss, he planted his feet on the bed and bent like a bow. His cock moved a bit quickly down John's throat, but he was able to pull off before he gagged. "Alright?" he asked his magnificent lover. Sherlock came back down to the bed and nodded, still under that damn pillow, which John noticed he seemed to be biting. He twisted his finger. Sherlock was definitely biting the pillow now. He pulled his finger out and Sherlock whined. "Patience! I don't want to hurt you. And since you're supposed to be learning, I don't want you to hurt me when it's your turn." At this Sherlock finally removed the pillow from his face and looked at him.
Sherlock sat his violin down and resigned himself to pacing a bit around the flat. He needed a distraction, needed a case. When John emerged a few moments later, wearing only sweatpants and obviously nothing else, Sherlock pounced. "You've just masturbated in the shower." John flinched and looked at Sherlock as if he'd just announced he shot heroin again. "Your cheeks are flushed." "It was a very hot shower." "Your penis is still semi erect I can tell because you're not wearing pants. Your heart rate is elevated as is your breath rate. The tension is gone from your shoulders, you aren't standing up straight anymore which means your legs have gone a bit 'jelly' and your mouth isn't set as it was when you arrived home." "Maybe I just had a nice shower." "A very nice shower." "Sherlock..." John was going to tell Sherlock how rude it was to call someone out for masturbating but, frankly, was tired of arguing with him. He had had a nice shower and it had helped clear his mind a bit in regards to that whole dating a man thing he was trying to get used to. So he said instead, "Let's try to have a nice night, hmm? I'll get some curry and a few beers and maybe we could watch a movie together?" Sherlock wasn't quite sure how to respond. On one hand, he wanted to spend some time with John, on the other, he really wanted a cigarette and thought he could nag John until he relented but then John would be angry and would go sulk in his room like he had been for days. "Okay. But no curry. Fish and chips." "Deal."
Sherlock grabbed two candles off the nearest surface and walked very casually, so he told himself, to John's bedroom. John followed with a smirk. When they got there, they encountered the same problem as when they had first begun: where to sit, what to do, who should start? Once again, John decided to let his experience take control. He took the candles from Sherlock and placed them on the dresser, turned off the lights, and began to kiss him. Because they were both standing and his pride could only handle so many tiptoe kisses, he started on Sherlock's throat again. That seemed like a very good idea, because Sherlock immediately went weak in the knees and his legs shook a little with the effort of staying upright. "John..." he sighed. John grinned again. He didn't mean to be so smug, had never thought of himself as particularly sexy, but to have a man like Sherlock Holmes go weak in the knees for you and your touch and your kiss? That was an honor.
When John got off work, he stopped at Giovanni's. He was thinking about his first meeting there with Sherlock. The first time Sherlock thought he was hitting on him and John felt compelled to tell him he wasn't gay, but that it was okay if Sherlock was. He laughed at that now, standing in line for his pickup order. The hostess looked at him oddly and he just smiled back. He gave her a five pound note for a tip when she handed him his order and said "I promise I'm not mad. I have a date tonight. Just a bit excited." She smiled and told him to have a good night. Oh, he planned to.
John shuddered again at the mix between his gentle caress and the intensity with which he kissed him. What had gotten into Sherlock? He seemed to be staking his claim on John's body, like dawn was approaching and they would soon have to go back into the world and he wanted everyone to...oh. He wanted everyone to know that John belonged to him now. Well, he is dating a sociopath. "Oh, God, Sherlock! That's cold!" Sherlock had begun to press the pad of his lubricated thumb to John's hole. He reached back and took Sherlock's hands away from his ass and placed them on the bed on either side of their hips. Then he took Sherlock's face in his hands and said "I am not going anywhere. I love you. I mean it. And you said you love me, too. So you're stuck with me. I told you I want you to make love to me. It's our first time, you can stake your claim on my body next time." And with that, he kissed Sherlock tenderly and pressed him back down to the mattress.
Sherlock's face lit up like a firecracker. His smile was blinding and his eyes crinkled at the edges and John just had to kiss him. Especially before he lit a cigarette. "Sherlock, I'm sorry, but I have to get ready for work. These are to tide you over until I get home but I PROMISE we'll talk then."
Sherlock's jaw dropped. He thought he would probably hear those words ringing in his ears until the day he died. John was on his knees on the bed in front of him, clad only in a pair of red briefs, holding a bottle of lube, asking him...no....TELLING him to take off his pants. He trembled as he slipped his thumbs into his waist band, lifted his hips, and did as the Doctor told him. "It's only fair if you do the same," he said quietly. John dropped the bottle onto the bed and with a shuddering breath, removed his own.
"Sherlock. Tell me something personal about you." Sherlock froze again. Something personal? He didn't think he had anything very personal to tell and what few facts there were, John already knew. "Tell me about your childhood," John said, knowing Sherlock didn't even know what personal meant, especially since he tended to air people's personals regularly. "My childhood was dull." "Tell me about it. Tell me about your parents." "Why?" "Because, Sherlock, this is what people do. They tell eachother things."  "Okay. My mother was a mathemetician before Mycroft was born she was nothing but a mother after that and my father was her devoted slave with no spine." Your mother was a mathemetician?" I just said that." "Well that explains a lot. But you said she became nothing but a mother. So...you didn't go off to school?" "No." "Really?" "Why does that surprise you?" "I just figured you and Mycroft for the type to have gone off to school." "Well, we did go to prep, but we didn't board." "Were you and your mother close?" Sherlock looked down at John. He should know the answer to that. "I am not close to anyone, John." "You're close to me."
It was only 6:30 in the morning, nothing was open except the corner shops. Ten pounds for a bottle of lubricant  seemed excessive but he was on a mission. He had rubbers at home and they still had a bottle of wine. The shop only had emergency type candles but they would do. By the time he made it back to Baker Street the florist had opened up. He debated on the sidewalk, staring at the display of roses and chrysanthemums in the window. Would Sherlock want flowers? If he bought flowers for Sherlock, would he think John was treating him like a woman? He could only imagine the look he would get. "Sentimentality..." he could hear Sherlock say. No. No roses. He decided to go against his better judgement as a doctor and a friend and give Sherlock what he knew he really wanted. He bought him a pack of cigarettes. He even put a little bow on them.
"Oh, God, Sherlock!"  he shouted, and his head hit the mattress with a thud. Sherlock grinned. He knew that grin. He wore it earlier. Sherlock pressed his thumb against John's perineum, crooked his fingers again, and pressed so hard against John's prostate he thought he went blind for a moment. Then he released his vice grip on John's most sensitive spot and resumed thrusting in and out, scissoring and twisting, seemingly all at the same time.
He stood and reached for Sherlock's hand who gave it, albeit a bit hesitantly. John led him to the bedroom and lowered him onto the bed. "Don't look so frightened. I'm not trying to plunder your virtue." John pushed Sherlock down onto his side and crawled in next to him. He placed his leg where it had been before. It wasn't a sexual thing, it was John's favorite way to cuddle. To be as close as possible to someone without being actually inside them. He stretched his arm above his head and ruffled Sherlock's curls. He loved those curls. They made Sherlock look rather...pretty. His other hand reached over and wrapped around Sherlock's waist and stared into his eyes. They had done this before, stared at eachother. Often. John often felt Sherlock taking him in when he thought John wasn't paying attention. It always gave John goosebumps and he was just beginning to understand why. John also had a tendency to stare at Sherlock, and he was sure it had not gone unnoticed. Not many things did. He never thought about it, never connected any dots. Sherlock was brilliant, beautiful, ofcoarse he stared. A lot of people did.
John lay there with his mouth open and understood now why Sherlock bit the pillow. He felt like all of his senses were completely overwhelmed and he just wanted to bury his face in something and give himself completely over to the emotions and feelings of lust and love and pleasure they were driving in him. His cock lay completely abandoned, red and straining and leaking on his belly. He suddenly reached down and began to stroke himself, but Sherlock pulled his hand away and he whined. He thought he sounded pathetic. He never thought this could be him, laying in bed with a man between his thighs, fingers inside his ass, mewling and quivering and writhing beneath him. He didn't care, though. Not when Sherlock began to suckle at the head of his cock like a newborn calf on his mother's tit. "Jesus, Sherlock, I can't. I can't  take it. If you want me before I cum, you better take me now." God, he sounded wrecked. He could only imagine how he looked.
Suddenly, Sherlock's hands were on him again, he was caressing John's thigh and whispering sweet nothings in his ear and telling him to relax, to breathe, and then he felt the head of his cock start to enter him. He immediately forgot to  breathe, forgot not to clench, and hissed when Sherlock's cockhead popped past the ring of muscle and settled there, just inside his tight virginal ass. Sherlock groaned and John groaned and Sherlock pulled out again, which hurt, but was followed by an immense sense of relief.
"Are you saying...?" "Yes. Not right now. I'm having way too much fun building this up to go straight for that right now. But yes. You may touch me there. You may do whatever you want to there."
Sherlock raised his hands in acquiescence, took a drag of his cigarette and said "Okay. I'll let you win this round. In thanks for these DELICIOUS things." John kissed him again, made a face at the DISGUSTING taste, and slowly made his way to his bedroom to change, wishing all the while he could just call in sick and snog Sherlock until it was dark enough to light the candles.
The next morning Sherlock awoke feeling relaxed and ready to find Moriarty. It suddenly seemed very important to catch him and make sure people were safe. Odd. However, when he opened his eyes, he was greeted by John Watson sitting in a chair next to his bed. "Hello," John said. He seemed angry. But not in the way he was usually angry at Sherlock. He did not yell, he did not kick the chair or throw anything. No, this was worse. This was quiet, controlled. Like he had had time to practice this moment.  Sherlock sat up and promptly noticed that he felt nude. He tentatively lifted the sheet and indeed, he was. Funny, though. He distinctly remembered falling asleep fully clothed. "John, what's going on?" "I had a good think last night and I thought maybe we could have a chat about it." Sherlock wanted to make a joke about John's excitement over a good think but thought it would earn him a good punch.
John walked into the flat to see Sherlock exactly where he left him. No surprise there. He tossed the bag of blackout candles and lube behind his chair. Best not to just wave that around. He held the cigarettes with a little blue bow behind his back, stood in front of Sherlock, and handed them over with a flourish.
Sherlock's eyes popped open suddenly and with a growl he rolled over, not removing John's hand, and began to thoroughly snog him. As he licked inside John's mouth, swallowed his moans, and swore to never let John pleasure him without total reciprocation ever again, he took hold of John through his own pants, a pair of red briefs that hugged his bum very nicely, now that Sherlock thought on it. At the very first touch, John moaned and curled himself tighter to Sherlock and said "Jesus Christ."
So I wrote this series years ago because I wanted something that felt realistic, like if John was gonna be with a man, how would that really happen? It was meant to be short and spiraled into this, as happens so many times. Because of that, I stalled out and never finished the story. So here I am, years later, to finish the story of how John and Sherlock end up in bed together. I also changed the title because 3 years later the only thing I hate in this story is that terrible title.
John finds Sherlock watching gay porn and things get a little messy. Where will the Baker Street Boys decide to go from here? And why is Mycroft so judgy?
Sherlock was very much enjoying how he looked. His hair was sticking up in every direction, he was breathing so hard Sherlock could see every muscle in his stomach twitch and every rise and fall of his toned, golden chest. His thighs were trembling. His eyes were glazed and seemed to be looking everywhere. He looked high.
John very slowly unbuttoned and unzipped the flies. When he had his trousers off, he kissed his stomach again and fingered gently at the hem of Sherlock's pants. Sherlock always wore silk boxers, John knew. But feeling them like this was entirely new. He wanted to slide his hand across them and feel Sherlock's hardness that was so obviously underneath. But that old apprehension was back. He looked up at Sherlock. Sherlock was gazing down at him with heavy lidded, slightly gazed over eyes. He saw immediately that John had gone from lust filled to hesitant. He removed John's hand from the top of his boxers and laid down in the bed with him again. "Can I show you what I used to like? When I was 14 and allowed myself such indecent pleasures?" "Please do." John said, as if he were inviting him to have a seat in his office and not inviting him to pleasure himself publicly.
John pulled off his shirt and reached for Sherlock's, who clearly hesitated. He really enjoyed seeing John without a shirt. He was soft and tan but clearly had well defined muscles under just a little fat. Obviously a side effect of leaving the Army but still getting a bit of excercise. Sherlock felt too lean, too bony. Also, the skin to skin contact was a bit much for him. He liked to touch John with his hands but all that rubbing of skin...it felt odd to him. John saw the heistation and let it be. He kissed Sherlock again and without breaking away settled himself in Sherlock's lap. This was another favorite way of kissing for him, but really, he just liked kissing in general. Usually, though, he was the one being straddled. It usually worked better that way for the girl to grind into him instead of him sort of grinding into her stomach. All these thoughts about grinding brought John back to reality and he realized that he'd acquired quite the hard on. He broke the kiss and took Sherlock's hand. He put it on his thigh and slowly slid it to his groin, slowly so that Sherlock would know where he was headed and maybe wouldn't push John onto the floor or run away as John had. He pressed Sherlock's palm to his hardness and looked up at him. "I want you to remember this. The first time you made me hard." Sherlock pressed on it harder and kissed John roughly and quickly. "I think we'll both remember the first time YOU made ME hard." John pulled both their hands away and said "I'm sorry about that. That wasn't fair. I...I freaked out a little." "I know. It was obvious." "Yeah well...I don't really have an excuse. I...I'm new to this." "You aren't the only one." "Yeah...that freaks me out, too, though. I've never been with a man and I've never been with a virgin. I don't know what the hell I'm doing and you don't know what the hell you're doing so...I guess we're just gonna have to work out the schematics together?" "Or you could let me watch porn and I could..." "No! Sherlock, no porn." "Why? It's basically a how-to." "Its a 'how to freak Sherlock out and make him go back to life long celibacy.' No. Sod this. I'll handle it." John climbed off Sherlock and put on his shirt, grabbed his keys and walked out the door. Sherlock was rather dumbfounded.
John winced. It was a bit more than he was expecting. Sherlock may have had long soft fingers but they were thicker than they looked, he realized now. The digit currently inside him was stretching him slowly, in and out, working it's way to the knuckle. He realized now he'd been a bit rougher and less patient with Sherlock and wondered if he had hurt him. He pulled back from their relentless kiss and looked at his lover. He was watching John with awe as he pressed and pressed inside him, so gently. John grunted and let his head fall down onto Sherlock's chest, where he used his other hand to caress his hair. John just clung to him. Sherlock withdrew his finger, added more lube, and went in with a second. John arched suddenly and pulled away. That had a bit of a sting. "I'm sorry!" Sherlock said immediately, sitting up and letting John slide from his lap onto the bed. John lay in the bed and laughed. "Why are you laughing at me?" Sherlock asked, but he was smiling, too. "For all my talk of going slowly and being gentle with you and not wanting to frighten you off, here I am pulling faces every time you touch me!" John said and he laughed again. "So the pain is inevitable, then," Sherlock said stonily. John sobered at that. "Oh Sherlock," he said, and he reached for him. Sherlock lay down next to John and draped his arm over his stomach. His erection was waning again but John was still hard as a rock. "It's our first time. It was going swimmingly until now, and there were bound to be some hiccups. We have all the time in the world to get the hang of it. And we have a few hours before I have to be at work. I think we can manage to find the time to get your cock in me by then." He looked at Sherlock and waggled his eyebrows.
John was a little surprised. Well, he thought he was surprised to find Sherlock watching porn but it made sense once he got past the idea that it was Sherlock watching porn. He had felt pretty horny this morning himself. Only natural. But if he wasn't wanking, what was he doing? "Disgusting? They were just giving eachother blowjobs. And why were you watching it if it disgusts you?" And if this thing between us goes somewhere will you refuse to give me one because I rather like that, is what he didn't say. Sherlock sighed and looked at the ground. "Sherlock?" "I don't think this up for discussion, John. I'm sorry I dropped your computer, I'll pay for the repairs." And he sulked off to his bedroom leaving John holding a still burning cigarette and a computer probably riddled with porn viruses.
Once his hair was washed and every ounce of the day's various mishaps washed from his body, John stood under the hot water and tried to ease the tension from his shoulders. It had been a long week. No cases made Sherlock very antsy and John knew he was wondering, but would not mention, what was keeping John at bay. He had decided that he was being a prat, but every time he went to touch Sherlock, the memory of the feel of a hot heavy cock in his hand gave him pause. It wasn't as though he had never touched one. He was a doctor, after all. But those were never hard, always a little more than flaccid as the patient was usually quite uncomfortable under Doctor Watson's scrutiny. It was a bit odd, new, yes. But what really had him disturbed was the idea of what do I do with it? It can't be that hard, he thought, you do have one of your own. He closed his eyes and reached his hand down, trying to imagine it was Sherlock's instead of his own.  He palmed himself until he had worked it into a rather impressive hard on. Having not done this for a while, he knew he wouldn't last long. He tried to go slow, gently stroking himself. He gave his wrist a few turns on the upstroke and ran his thumb over the slit. It did not last long at all and he quickly found himself grappling for a hold as he came hot and hard over his fist. He really hoped that given the chance, he could make Sherlock last a bit longer.
John sat straight up in bed. What on earth was that? he wondered. Then he heard it again. Sherlock was screaming his name. Like a flash John raced downstairs and burst into Sherlock's room.  Sherlock was thrashing on the bed, clutching his pillow, drenched in sweat. John flicked on a light and tried to shake Sherlock awake. Sherlock's eyes suddenly popped open and he grabbed hold of John's tee shirt. Eyes wild, he screamed "I'll kill you!!!! I will find you!!! I will find you, Moriarty and I will tear your throat out!!!!" "Sherlock, its me!!! It's John!!! Wake up!!!!" Sherlock blinked his eyes a few times as John came into focus. "Oh my God, John!!" He threw John onto the floor, jumped down on top and pulled John's shirt over is head. Jesus Christ, John thought, what is happening? But Sherlock wasn't doing what John thought he was. He was running his eyes over John's chest, then his back, then his chest again. Finally, he released John and crawled back onto his bed, taking deep breaths. John went and sat on the edge.
Finally. They had been snogging eachother for weeks, toying with eachother with light caresses and false starts, but now they had talked themselves to death and they could finally be here with eachother, naked, in a bed, on the same page for the first time.
"Me?" John asked, standing to take a step towards Sherlock before taking another one back.  "Me? I am the reason you went out and scored heroin and brought it back into our home and shot it into your body and nearly drowned in a bathtub? I'm to blame? Tell me how exactly you have come to that conclusion." Sherlock didn't know what to say. He had been trying to figure out pretty much the same thing for 32 days. He decided to just tell John the truth as he knew it.
John nudged him further onto the bed and propped himself up on his left elbow. With his right, he slowly slid his hand down into Sherlock's pants and grasped his cock loosely. Sherlock hissed and arched. John stared in wonder. He began to massage Sherlock, all the while watching his face for any sign that he wasn't comfortable. There were none. On the contrary, Sherlock's eyes were closed and his mouth hung open and he was taking deep, shuddering breaths. John had to bite that damn lip again. He started to kiss down his jaw, worked his way across his throat, and began to suckle on his ear, all the while steadily and gently massaging his now throbbing cock.
"Why don't you go wash the taste of impending cancer from your mouth while I set the table?" "Yes, John. I live to obey " "You don't have to obey me, by any means, but if you hope to get more of where that came from you're going to." "Who said I want more?" he asked indignantly. "Your little moan just now." "I did NOT moan!" But he stomped off to the bathroom anyways while John chuckled at him.
John lay there for a minute and caught his breath before rolling over to look at Sherlock. "Alright?" he asked. Sherlock didn't move. John leaned up on one elbow and kissed Sherlock's cheek. "Sherlock? Are you okay? Did I hurt you?" Sherlock turned his head and stared at John with wonder. "I love you, too," he said.
As he pushed John's head down and angled his hips up, he knew the moment he hit that mysterious spot they both had. John clenched and bore down on his cock, holding it there and rocking against it. Sherlock buried his head between John's shoulder blades and listened as John came, long and hard and white hot, and he came with him.
"John. Yesterday, you said you thought you might be in love with me. Is that true?" John swallowed, he rather wished he hadn't said that. It didn't exactly fall in line with the natural order of things he was trying to establish. At the time, it was a necessary statement, to shake Sherlock from the denial he was trying to acquire. "I only ask because...if we do this...that's what will happen. I will fall in love with you. I know enough about these things to know that if two people go completely against their natures for eachother, love is the logical endpoint. Can you handle that?" "Can you answer my question?" "You first." "No. I asked mine first. You answer." "No, John. I'm giving you my answer. I won't sleep with someone who may or may not love me after...or preferrably during." Sherlock had a point there. He needed, deserved, to share his first time with a lover, not a friend with questionable feelings. "Okay. Your way. Yes. I meant what I said. But its too soon to go saying things like that." "I completely agree. I just needed to know if it was true. So...where do we go from here?" John rather liked that question. He had the perfect answer.
