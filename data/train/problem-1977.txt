They had been, even then, unforgettable.
A whisper of scarlet flushed Sherlock's cheeks, and he murmured, "Why do you say that?"
Like the hand-holding.

Sherlock threw John's trousers, with his brown brogues still trapped inside the legs, over his shoulder. The slightly-lethal package hit a new lamp that quickly became a broken, old lamp.
But like bee stung fingers and a head that is actually very hard to concuss—though Sherlock would accidentally try twice more through the years—they got over these hurts too, though never, not ever out of one another's orbit.
had been to finally get his driving licence because apparently that's what grown-ups do, according to his sister, and so he let himself be talked into receiving driving instruction from "a place I know," and on a cold winter day he'd met his driving instructor in a mostly-empty parking lot.
Sherlock opens his mouth, closes it, then, eyes still trained on John's reflection, Sherlock says softly, "That man is lonely. He feels invisible. He tries too hard. But it doesn't make any difference. He's still invisible."
The dog was huge. The dog was black. And the dog wanted John.
And very, very rarely, a man with a brolly sits beneath one of the park's trees. Lestrade always looks for him but he's hardly ever there. Instead, sometimes he's…
Mycroft liked the jam-filled crepes and daddy liked the cream. Usually mummy tried something new and so Sherlock often did, too.
John'll keep going on dates he can't afford, and he'll buy rounds at the pub on too many nights, and because John's a betting man he knows it's just a matter of odds: The more he tries, the more chances he takes, the more likely he is to win, right?
It was years before John realised that grandad Ideal would come seek him out on those childish, ill-tempered days. Then he'd light his pipe, John would cuddle close, and surrounded by the smoky-sweet scent of cherries, together they'd grow calm.
John growled up at the idiot making

Still panting on their indignation and arousal, no one said anything at all for about one minute.
either side of John's cock. "Uh, you don't seem very…professional."
"Johnny me boy-o! It's time for your lunchy lunch!"
* I don't know if I'm a good friend.
Sherlock stopped starting to cry and instead did the d-word thing that Mycroft had taught him. He looked at the boy's shaky little hands, at the dried tracks of older tears and said, "You didn't mean to hit the ducks with the flowers." He was immediately rewarded for this correct deduction with a blonde head bob. Sherlock forgot to cry. He smiled. The other boy smiled back.
Sherlock waved his hands frantically, as if surrounded by chalkboards on which he was hastily erasing his accusation of
Sherlock Holmes ignores John Watson's first comment on his blog.
No one can miss the arrival of Tariku Abrams.
What was here was Sherlock's craving to be not-bored. So he decided to help a boy figure out his path in life—Cesare would quit his degree next term and happily go on to be middle management at HMV—and to liven up the day of a man whose mocha latte was its high point.

was done up in a festive, gory red.
Sherlock stares.
John looked back down when he reached a corner. He tapped his toe onto the pretty starburst inlay there, continued pacing.
"What?"
Sherlock introduced himself. John replied in kind. Sherlock held out a hand. John stood.
Because right from the start John has noticed this particular pretty posh boy. You can't not.
Like that time John said, "Holy happy Christ I will so love fucking you right up," to the guy with the bat aimed at the back of Sherlock's head? Yeah, well that guy totally didn't see John's fear-shaking hands, didn't know John was still wearing a knee brace from a slip on winter ice. No, all the guy with the wavering cricket bat knew was that John sounded almost
vibes as he can manage, and John Watson can manage a fuck ton of prickly.
Sherlock slow blinked, flipped up his coat collar, shoved hands in pockets, a six foot wall. "That would be tremendously ambitious of you, Dr. Watson."

Sherlock Holmes knows her edges, her shadows, her promontories and she is different, his city.
"Again? Your girlfriend's a menace."
"It's a travesty," John says, the first non-donation-related words he's ever spoken to Mr Holmes.
"Oh for fuck. Look. Just. No. No it's not breaking the law Constable Piada it just
Yes, well, it was gone for just a few seconds, the few it took Sherlock to give mummy the thumbs up and then shout at the boy he couldn't see, "Stop throwing things!"
"I heard you say something confusing."
The Thames shore is made up of many things, stones, chalk, bones, sand…and sometimes things that take the breath away. What can you image on that rocky shore?
And when he finally said, "Seriously Sherlock, what the fuck?" Greg was flattered when Sherlock explained. Look, he may want to punch the man as often as praise him, but the git's good-looking, brainy, and has a certain charm if you squint hard and feign deafness.
John is making me take a driving certification course again.
So, if you're going to set a story in NSY you'll want to research when/if that move has at last happened.
Sherlock's not holding John's hand, nor John his. Their hands are resting together, side by side on the bed, close enough to feel the warmth from each other's skin. Sherlock looks at their hands and says, "Yes."
"I don't. I just…it's just…I've just never seen a man
and no he was not flatly rejected. All three times.
"Mike, I need—"
"There is," said Sherlock looking down, skin all prickly and hot, "six sorts of blond in your fringe."
He usually deserved it.
Be that as it may, when you go to a doctor whose treatments focus on organs of a sexual nature, such physicians need to know the range of things you may do with those organs. So there were checkboxes, so many checkboxes on so many forms, including those that said gay, straight, and bisexual. While everyone currently living knows there are more sexual orientations than that, what was

The big man in the good coat put his purple strand down and belatedly administered aid by patting John on the back, continuing to elucidate. "For those that do, milking can lead to quite intense orgasms. Which, as a doctor, I'm sure you know."
"Overheard you say you're looking for a flatshare. I've got my eye on a nice little place in central London. Interested?"
John did not, at that time, address the implication there was no such line near
"My patella." The man pointed at his shin bone. "That's my patella."
Finally, the second best thing John learned through all of this was that once in a great while, when Sherlock gets excited by something their bees have done, he will dance on his toes.
her to think her height bothers you."
John tentatively opened his mouth, then waited. All Sherlock did was list left a little more. John waited a little more.
He liked it when grandmum laughed so he'd usually do both arms and puff out his chest too, which made her absolutely howl. It wasn't until dozens of years later that John realised his grandmother was pushing those rocks out of place on purpose. So that they could laugh. The thing is, when John realised this he cried. Sherlock had held him and asked him why.
Sherlock started picking excitedly at the skull-and-crossbones plasters laddered up his shin. He leaned close, whispered, "Tell me."
I also enjoy learning the big things, like I too can have murderous urges.
"Ouch!"
And so it went, for months, and then for a year, until Sherlock finally found his footing in school. Even so Maddy stayed on awhile, until Maureen was asked to write a book and the whole clan moved closer to Harrow, where the professor would have more ready access to the only fireproof lab in London.
John shoves him with his shoulder. "All of that can't be true. No one's—what's wrong?"
"People forever think the tall wish to be short. They don't. So that beige, kitten-heeled number? Ridiculous. Unless you
"Sherlock Holmes," said John Watson.
"Good, that's good, because I'd really like to get back to the snogging, as you call it. First, I know that Grace doesn't care. Grace is the one who told you to talk to me, remember?"
"No it isn't!"
There's also the bright spear of The Shard poking grand up into the sky as your gaze heads left. Sometimes the glass that tops the Shard—it's a viewing platform up there—changes colour, like the Eye. Usually it's lighted a bright white, but during Christmas it cycled from red to green, too. A little further along there's the dome of St. Paul's, usually over-lighted at night in a way that John thinks doesn't quite become a cathedral.
John had a girlfriend once who said he was perverse. Not content with over-long hours as a doctor, he went and joined the army so he could then risk his own life while saving others.
The train lurched because that's what trains do, and Sherlock let the motion press him against the ill-tempered man with the sweet-smelling mouth, and yes, oh yes Sherlock saw. Saw the little man flush to his hair line at the unexpected press of an expensively-clad
In that narrow aisle Sherlock did what Sherlock does: Exactly what he wanted.
John's breathing heavier than any of this warrants and he realises he's being a dick, dumping his own frustrations onto a stranger who doesn't owe him shit. He blows out an exasperated breath and says, "Well. Right. I am…so sorry."
Years later, when John tells this story at parties, he insists he regained consciousness
Sherlock ignored the perky constable, took his seminar ticket, glanced at it.
They noticed.
"Do you know who that was? That was the Shadow Secretary of State for Justice and Kicking Your Arse. She could've probably made you illegal. Just say no with a nod next time."

"Who—"
would have been bored after three days at home! With the flu! Making them sick!
"Do not even ask me about my knees."
John knows when people will hear. Yet even when he knows they won't, he talks anyway…because sometimes it's he who needs to hear.
He doesn't move.
The park—and therefore the view—is a ten minute leisurely walk north of their flat. Remember how I said that John and Sherlock
You can have John and Sherlock love any old biscuit you please, but the go-to biscuits in the UK seem to be McVitie's digestives, either plain or chocolate covered. They're your stereotypical biscuit, the sort you'd pick up for a morning meeting if someone said, "bring biscuits." Custard creams are popular, too, but digestives are
John nods to Tariku, to the lady who's just taken a couch beside Holmes, to Holmes. And John goes to get lunch at the chippy across the way.
"Why did you thank me?"
"Oh right, Sherlock Holmes!" Mike grinned, glanced down reflexively.
? Well Primrose Hill Park sits on top of Regent's Park,
Anywho, little John Watson follows his nose and he peers into a tall glass that is not empty. As a matter of fact it's one third full with something that looks an awful lot like chocolate milk and it must be for floating on the top is something that looks a lot like a bit of whipped cream.
Four…and then he fidgets again and John
Sherlock reached, grabbed the first frames his fingers fell on, donned them. He barked a startled breath and stepped back. Dear god he looked like his year one teacher. He looked exactly like Mrs. Kleoette.
Bethany looked at her friend. Her friend looked as if her heart were absolutely breaking. Bethany looked west. Bethany debated. She made up her mind.

After awhile the boys stretched back onto the grass and chattered about nothing much. Eventually it was time to go back inside.
Instead he looks down at his still-limp cock and he—
"But! I do remember that I have an international reputation," intoned the man, swaying serenely.
Because no one who meets Sherlock has ever
He grinned and beside him Sherlock looked up from red-penning the half-page write-up he'd got in
He hasn't been by since then—was it only last week?—so Sherlock waits. He tries going down to the morgue but they don't let him in any more, so he sits up here and he stares at the little doctor with the easy laugh and the easy smile and he wonders if everything about the man is easy, and then he wonders what would happen if he said that, if he went over there and—
While John might have been completely unaware of the location of his tongue and that it was now doing a sexy, anticipatory samba across his bottom lip, he was, peripherally, quite aware of the conversation of the two strangers just behind him and to his left.
John rose, swayed, then stilled himself with an index finger to the tall man's chest. "Imagine I said that without shouting. Or swearing. Or calling you…" John looked to the left, as if the word he needed was—
And so it went for three more minutes. Then everything went to hell.

to which the word love could be applied she did not know.
Eleven seconds where Sherlock side-eyed his student, mesmerised by the pugnacious lift of his chin, the way his chest moved as he hyperventilated, the pretty whiteness of his bulging knuckles, and it was only when John licked his lips that Sherlock groaned and by that time they were up the back end of the battered prop car put in the parking lot for just such instructive instances as this.
Bent double, sweaty hands sliding slick on his knees, Sherlock tries, he tries to breathe but he—
Sherlock pursed his lips petulantly. John pursed right on back. The Yard's finest murmured about the Halloween parties they were missing.
Included in my Tumblr photos of St. Mary's is one I took of a restaurant right up the street from it. It's a striking looking place and I imagine John-nothing-happens-to-me-Watson doing his occasional shift as St. Mary's then going down to this place to have a meal and a pint or three.
A half hour later and Sherlock seemed more than happy to accept the magazine. After the brief moment of bonding they, as always, stretched out on Sherlock's floor in deference to the dozen books they were using and they were a mere half hour into the lesson before Mycroft realised that Sherlock had had absolutely no interest in being pacified.
"Don't
Hence a little cafe interview with a young, studious individual named Cesare.
John also closed his eyes so he wouldn't have to see himself getting another thing wrong in a long list of wrong things. A list that started with the whole getting shot thing, the being invalided home thing, and the unemployable surgeon thing, and ended with John dumping caffeine all over a beautiful man, and you know what? John was done now. Just done. He was tired of things going wrong.
Sherlock's startled to find it
He doesn't know how to do this right, he doesn't know how to use the fire to make light, he desperately wants to illuminate, instead he turns everything to ash.
Yet somehow they're about to let the moment pass, because each has been alone long enough that it's begun to seem normal, maybe safe. Then Mike makes a chest-deep sound and turns his head. It's difficult to tell which man he's looking at, but it spurs one of them to speak.
"About the time you started

Madam did not move for many moments. Madam was busy pawing through her mental Rolodex, wondering which friend could be bribed to call her with a sudden surgical 'emergency.'
Sherlock doesn't pretend his instant dislike of DangerMouse, who's arrived early, just as he has.
So he did one important thing: Found someone with a detective's insignia and asked, "Has the boy been found?"
John could almost actually hear the man thinking through the various permutations of this. And he saw the moment the man arrived at the exact wrong one. Mostly because the man was suddenly panting sexily in his face.
Sherlock winks. John smiles. They leave the airport together. They talk on the tube all the way into the city.
Sherlock rolls his eyes. "Never mind."
Three feet from Sherlock's table John Watson leaned on a cafe counter and avidly watched the barista make his mocha latte. He was not aware that his tongue stuck out, or that he was leaning forward a bit, or that he vibrated with eagerness. This would be his first mocha latte of the week. He was only allowed three. He rationed himself. He had no idea why.
Mycroft can believe whatever makes Mycroft
Bum on the bench, Sherlock Holmes had his hands in his lap and his head tilted up as the small doctor probed and poked.
It was right then that the earth moved for Sherlock.
"Think about it. You could buy all kinds of frames for all kinds of occasions, couldn't you? I always used to tell myself that if I ever needed glasses I'd buy a half dozen pair and change them depending on my mood." The stranger cocked his head and a bit of fringe fell into his bright blue eyes. Five. Sherlock counted five sorts of blond. "'Course I was ten-years-old then and didn't know that some fucking frames cost as much as a Knightsbridge flat but there you go."

Finally John gets his call through. He spends most of it barking out facts into his phone, then pausing to hum sweet things into a stranger's ear. The dispatcher's replies never stray to
"Please Mycroft, please."
John…until John started laughing, too.
At Bart's later this afternoon he'd spilt a test tube of blood and it had flowed across the bench like some sort of very small red sea. The student two seats over had watched Sherlock mop up the mess very messily, positively beaming as the smear smeared.
Except not quite.
"He played rugby in college, not football, was in the army not the navy, and he's far too smart not to see through your plans of fraud. So those index cards you've been studying? Wrong. Wrong. Wrong."
"Detective inspector Lestrade said I could
"They do."
The small man across from Maiko sat in his chair so stiffly he appeared bound to it.
Sherlock leans forward as if to get out of that magically appearing chair and he frowns and blinks and opens his mouth from which a tongue pushes, and he huffs and puffs a couple times and he mutters a thing and then another thing and at this point John's come in close and it takes some effort, some focus and careful listening, but eventually John hears what the man's mumbling soft and careful, as if the language is new and sweet and strange.
Here he offers truths. He doesn't know why.
Sherlock stops.
Which causes John's voice to go suddenly husky, which leads to another fucking
"Why does it matter if I think you're looking?"
Which was why he said, "You can borrow her. For a little bit. A few days. Maybe a week.
Sherlock clutched at John's belt—which he had been trying to unbuckle for a solid minute—with both hands. "John.
So right then, instead of answering the doctor with a lie that would get him what he wants, Sherlock answers the man with a truth that'll get him what he needs.
With effort the man does not run his thumb over the fading indent in his finger.

Dr. Watson widened his eyes, scandalised. "Michael Heston Stamford, where did you find this man?"

knows which sandwich Greg wants. Last month he'd bought them both soup and a grape pot because Greg was again thinking he wanted to lose weight, but today—yeah, Mycroft's there today—the British Government's got them both a ham and cheese toasty and Greg is so happy he thinks he'll kiss him.
"Coffee?" Mr. Watson finally asks.
"It was by a rock," John said in explanation, while Sherlock nodded as if he understood. "It doesn't hurt any more," John said happily, and Sherlock nodded again, as if he understood.
Which is to say that John Watson has argued with a barista about which of his own feet is larger (the left). He's argued with Angelo about where mistletoe should be placed (not over the men's toilet, not ever). John has argued with Sherlock about whether Sherlock's penis should have its own name ('absolutely not John').
"I may or may not live very close to Angelo's restaurant."
Greg giggles into his glass again.
Sherlock Holmes doesn't jerk off.
With a deep breath Sherlock poked his head over the roof edge again and said, "Are you John?" despite quick-fast deductions—blond hair, fear-wide eyes, tear-streaked cheeks—that told him this very much was the lost boy.
John reached another corner. Tapped his toe onto another dark starburst. Watched a grey-haired man tiredly usher his crime scene crew from the room.
Right there, in an over-bright store somewhere north along Regent Street, neither man could possibly know that seventeen weeks and several minutes from this moment the only things getting
And kind of wished he hadn't.
Sometimes the boys nip inside and get themselves a pasty. John usually pats his stomach and says “I shouldn’t,” then John does—if Sherlock agrees to share one of the cheese and onion. Somehow John never complains when Sherlock then buys them sweets from the chocolate shop just left of the pasty vendor.
He finds a corner and observes. The man's identity is easy enough to deduce. Sherlock tells himself he'll watch a few minutes, then leave.
Except he does.

Another duck got it right in the noggin with a heavy red carnation. It flew away with an indignant quack and Sherlock danced on his toes in agitation. "Don't! You'll kill them!"
That had been happening a lot lately. The 'nice' thing. People looking at him, Sherlock Holmes, and thinking
When frustrated, Greg Lestrade doesn't vent his spleen, clench fists, or grind teeth. He doesn't roll his eyes or make a moue.
Sherlock's gaze slicked past John. His grin faded. He went dead-eyed. He dropped John's hand, stood, and walked away.
The area in
No one, not one of them except John, realised Sherlock had moved until Sherlock almost touched—then didn't—John's bare shoulder.
Except...
Derisive.
Frankly John didn't really understand so he just laid back and spread his legs so he could watch all the action down there, while Sherlock just kept
Sherlock scowled.
Well, mostly.
This wee park is surrounded by other buildings, so it feels sort of tucked away, still, and quiet. In the park there's a tiny fountain in the middle of a little pond with goldfish in it. Anomalously there's also a half dozen banana trees and, dotted behind them and at the edges of the park—which used to be a graveyard—are headstones.
They laughed then. Oh they laughed themselves absolutely giddy.
Sherlock Holmes opened his mouth again and again John jumped in, so to speak.
John crossed the room, held out his hand. Sherlock reached back. John tugged the tall man tall and all three people in that massive, empty room walked across it and to John's special corner. He tapped a toe onto the crooked…not starburst.
No, John didn't say any of that. Instead he made a big manly sniffing noise to show that he was straight, and he tilted his chin up to give the pretty man's mouth better access to his mouth, and he waited.
"No." Sherlock frowns at the open boxes of Nicaraguan cigars, then at the Cubans, too. He stands slowly, looks at the wall.
Through valiant effort John eventually stopped coughing on his own embarrassment. In part this was because he's a battle-hardened veteran—hell he was once so close to extended rifle fire he was deaf for six hours—the other reason John finally got his shit together was because he was so fucking horny that two pats on the back had already left him half hard.
"Okay, yes, thank you for that, Poirot."
With a bow and smile, John Watson retires from the dance floor.
Sherlock's gaze flicked up to bookshelf shadow. He grinned, and John narrowed his eyes. "What?"
When what happened next was nothing, Greg squinted one eye open. Then dropped his jaw.

Sherlock didn't look twice at the guy with the four science degrees. He talked over the gregarious ginger with the lisp. He actively insulted the banker and the writer, and when the coroner saw Sherlock again a week later, well frankly Lestrade's not surprised the man tried punching him. Twice.
He's complained about its opposite a dozen times a dozen times. "London is too crowded!" he's said, while swooshing. "People are always in the way!" he's said, while twirling. ("I don't twirl or swoosh John" "Yes you do Sherlock").

did it some more. This time with open legs. John cleared his throat so sharply he got saliva in his sinuses, then sneezed so hard his ears popped.
Sherlock is busy being distracted by the heat of the big animal between his legs and the heat of the small one at his back. Again John Watson doesn't wait, but squeezes the horse with his thighs and the moment Mike moves Sherlock yelps ("No I didn't," he'll say one year from today. "Yes you did." John will reply.), so John takes hold of his guest's waist.

all the way to the end of the aisle, then the good doctor joined Sherlock on the stage before he'd even asked himself why.
Sherlock knew Watson's type: Brave when hiding behind a title, a rule, a telephone, but get full-face in front of them and they'd always wilt.
This time John saw who was yelling because the man was holding his arms out and turning in circles, very clearly clearing the space around him.
He wishes the man would make him stop.
Both men looked up from Sherlock's gory scrape. Both sat upright. Neither said a word. Then John made a long arm and grabbed his patient's file. He didn't look at it though.
"That's up higher!"
Right out into the road John went and up onto the far kerb and round the corner and under a shrub and once he was on the high street he damn well didn't turn around to see if the dog was following, no, but he did keep screaming "Fuck off, fuck off, fuck off!" the whole time because Harry's friend's sister said that to make Jessie and Harry go away, and Harry said it to John to make

Sherlock curled lower, crossed his little legs tighter and sniffled against his stuffed bear's heart place. "It's okay," he told her.

The big, burly ‘idiot’ stood. And did not like being called an idiot. He grabbed the slim man by his coat collar and—
Sherlock watches the man nod, a quick bob of the head, and turn away awkwardly, his cane in the way of a woman pressing past.
"Do you have a car?" John Watson growled at Sherlock Holmes.
"I'm that many, too."
"Mind you I do a lot of locum work on the side, so I keep odd hours. I like a pint now and again, too. And I do date a fair bit." John took the stethoscope Mike had finally dug from his cavernous bag, donned it in a way that could only be described as

"You fancy me and I fancy you and people who fancy each other do the kissing thing and other things and so let's do those things."
Instead John looked the man in his pale, upswept eyes and John's body opened like a lotus blossom. His hands unclenched, his thighs eased, his lips parted.
Because that was the thing you did when you built your very own bear, John knew; you whispered wishes to her purple-sparkle heart ("Purple'th my favourite colour now!"), then you tucked those wishes inside, safe forever.
"Tu combles mon cœur," interpreted his lover.

From the man's averted gaze and the speed at which he rapid-fired his monologue, John's pretty sure Sherlock just asked him out.
"For eight months Grace told me about your deductions, your mad derring-do, your demands. She told me how you just about dance around crime scenes, how you strut and cock and crow, how
"Helium!"
"What did you say to Rosie's heart?"
Sherlock sits and stares at the little doctor with the easy laugh and the easy smile, and he wonders if everything about the man is easy, then he wonders what would happen if he said that, if he went over there and...
John Watson squinched his eyes closed, but this failed to shut his ears. The baritone rumbling to his right
John drops the phone, wraps his other arm around the man who has started to moan again and John whispers, "What's your name, sweetheart?"
Of the one hundred and three people currently present at the Met's Christmas party, forty-seven turned toward the shouting. After nothing happened for ten seconds except more owlish squinting on Sherlock's part and the fading of a blush on John's, most of them turned away.
They reach to shake hands. John Watson sticks out his left because he's a lefty. Sherlock pokes out his right. Their limbs clash. For a moment they're holding hands.
It's after Sherlock's fourth terse acknowledgement to the doctor—
"A past client of mine works in the Shard lets me onto the observation deck whenever I like would you like?" The words fall out of Sherlock's mouth as if aided by gravity and he wonders if John, all the way down there, can see the flush he feels creeping up his neck. ("I totally did," John murmurs a month later. "Oh you did not," Sherlock whispers back.)
coked-out Whitehall arse who decides to flip tables after finding out no one offered their phone number.
Sherlock clenches his jaw. He contemplates opening the door with his fist wrapped around his prick. He does not do this. Instead he puts on his scarf and his coat and he opens the door. That his trousers are still pooled at his ankles registers instantly to the short doctor standing there. The man steps inside quietly—
and how to say "—you'll need much more than that to prove I'm an insensitive arsehole detective inspector," but Sherlock did not know how to say
Right about this point John should have tugged his shirt back up, hidden his scars away again, but he didn't. And that? That more than anything is what changed everything.

cross Baker Street then turned left, he’d be on Marylebone Road. On Marylebone you’ll find not only another tube entrance for Baker Street, you'll find a Marks & Spencer mini supermarket. This isn't one of their proper supermarkets, it’s too dinky for that. This is more where John and Sherlock would grab high-end pre-made meals because they've just got back from a case that had them walking hip deep through the Thames, down into the sewers, then along Regent's canal and damn it
Sherlock Holmes was a terrible student.
Nothing.
Sherlock feels beneficent.
"Fibula!"
When mum left him at grandmum's and grandmum was busy doing other things, John would patrol the back garden and tidy things. He'd been taught how to deadhead roses and so he'd do that. And he'd gather up some of the fallen leaves from the hydrangeas, and he'd shift the rocks until they were just, just

"What?"
What John did do was feel suddenly very naked. He tried closing his legs. Being as they were held fast in stirrups, all the good doctor managed to do was clench fetchingly. He said, "Yeah, I know."
Sherlock looks at his hand. He looks at the napkins. He looks a long time.
For months Sherlock's father had despaired of finding his seven-year-old son a tutor capable of coping. Coping with a too-bright boy yes, but more so the houseful of curious Holmeses that came with him.
The boy started dancing on his toes faster. "Oh no you'll kill them,

For example, he liked moving the rock border in grandmum's garden so that it was straight again. Grandmum had a tendency to kick the rocks a bit when she watered the hydrangeas and the roses, so John would follow behind her setting the rocks right.

It's here Sherlock shuts down tight. He doesn't answer because he doesn't want to
"Yes. Prison. Twenty-three years."
Sherlock started picking at the skull-and-crossbones plasters laddered up his shin, leaned close and whispered, "Tell me."
The dozens of drawers had been empty—except one. A folded serviette, on it ten words, the scent of ink still clinging.
Almost instantly the little boy is blinking eyes wide and fighting tears. "Therlock! That'th my

About one minute from Montague Street, it's full to the rafters with stuffed old creatures, things in jars, and the mezzanine—which visitors can't reach but can see—has skeletons leaning over the railing looking down at you (see the photo!). The museum is free and I have this idea that if enough bored Sherlock would wander its small space peering into the many, many specimen jars—including the lion's mane jellyfish.
Another trio of tugs and the rest of their limbs were free. In short order both men stood, turned, looked at one another, and had thoughts.

"So what happened?"

This time Sherlock was not given pause. Because Sherlock will do anything for a thing he wants and he long ago ceased being on speaking terms with embarrassment, shame, or self-consciousness. So the good detective clasped his hands behind his back, he bowed at the waist, and he inclined his shaggy head and he said soft and sweet and low, "Please, Dr. Watson?"
agreement. And before he thinks about what to say he's saying it.
He'd seen Sherlock's jutting chin and hesitant march, saw the blonde boy and ducks in the near distance, and Mycroft knew what his little brother was about to do. He had almost risen, followed. He had wanted to, started to, he—no.
John shrugs. "Uh, you're just fishing in the wrong—"
Yes, sometimes John wonders…
John faded off, frowned, looked right into the pale eyes of the man looking at him. And then he said something brilliant, so brilliant as a matter of fact that Sherlock's brows lofted as high as they could go.
Last time he'd got the kids' essays back just six days after deadline and that was bad enough, now he'd gone and doubled his record for all-time worst tutor in the history of—

Yet, though he closed his eyes against the travesty before him, this did not stop John Watson from seeing everything in mind's eye. The man's pale eyes partially obscured by waves and waves of dark fringe. His long legs drawn up in coffee-splashed surprise. The frown on a face with the most fantastic cheekbones John has probably ever seen

Sherlock frowned, clueless. Mike grinned. "He's not that type of guy, John."
There are, to this day, ten pints of creme egg ice cream shoved in beside the body parts in Sherlock's freezer. They got sick of it after the fourth pint, and tried to give the rest away.
That's not true actually.
He orders a beer. He'll do so each time he comes.
Turns out Sherlock's hunch is right. Giving not very much is just enough.
"African or Asian!"
After a boneless little while, Sherlock oozed himself to the mattress with a contented sigh. John looked down, made a pleased noise at the gooey mess on his trousers. He has long had a thing for Sherlock's…fluids.

Even though he is only just six, some part of John Watson already recognises defensiveness, understands shouting at a bully before they can shout at you. Except John isn't a bully even a little bit so he says, "Therlock is a pretty name."
Sherlock never did learn that Mycroft had watched over him that day in the park, nor would he ever know how many times his brother clutched at a bench or a desk edge or an umbrella,

"They do."
Sherlock puts a hand on his belly, another on his chest, and he says small and soft between small, soft breaths, "Help me."
When Sherlock makes that boy cry is when Sherlock learns how things can look one way and be another and right then he smiles big to make things better. And they are.

Sherlock disappears. Greg slumps forward, under the illusion he's had a narrow escape. After a few minutes Greg starts to worry he's misunderstood something important, then a short man in army dress blues approaches.
Foregoing the benches to sit on the grass, John'll point out things that are so obvious as to be pedantic, yet he does it every time and every time Sherlock—who sits behind him, arms wrapped tight around John's waist—nods and says softly, "What else?"

John laughs. The man—his name is Sherlock—explains. They walk. They talk. John offers tips on pulling in a pub.
Hearing these few highly unusual words in a sinful baritone so surprised the good doctor that he reflexively turned to gape at the man who'd purred them.

He watches their reunion, then leaves beneath one of the arches and goes out into a somehow-slower city. He smiles at nothing and everything. And he just…walks.

Sherlock watches John's careful hands awhile, then shrugs. "They want the dramatics, not the…not the detective," he says softly. Then he raises his chin as if to take a punch, but all John does is hold out the tray full of a dozen colours of surgical tape. Sherlock says nothing, but John knows what he means anyway. So John picks.

Like you may just a little tiny small teeny weeny bit be capable of murder...
"Yes actually, he taught himself. He has two library cards," replied Maureen Vernet Holmes.
Sherlock's voice was high and breathy and aggrieved, and it was right then John became capable of hearing that one voice above all others. He raised his eyebrows so high they made little wrinkles on his forehead, and he sniffled, "Hu?"
When Holmes slipped me the thumbs last week he specifically asked they be buried in constant shade, eight tails apart, one tail down, left for six days, report on decomposition to be provided promptly on day seven. Today.

Sherlock looked up at a little boy at the same time as he hastily scrubbed the back of his hand on the grass. "Um, no." Sherlock sniffled again, wiped with the back of his hand again. He looked at this mess too, made a face, then scrubbed his hand on the earth again.
Then John Watson starts answering questions Sherlock hasn't asked.
This is a strange, bitter-sweet, easy-to-miss park in London but it is wonderfully well worth visiting. I think John and Sherlock know this place. I think the first time John went there he felt like he’d found something precious, because indeed he had.
The thing is, though Sherlock was only six, he knew everyone was doing the looking
"I want to do this right."
The good detective nodded curtly, then politely burped against the back of his hand.
John grabs Sherlock's chin, turns him so they look right in each other's eyes. He makes a hissing sound through pursed lips and nods
"—any the fuck way! The last time you wanted a quickie I couldn't sit for half a day what with all your thrusting and grunting and

Silence.
Now John did a little rhythmic samba with his anus. Sometimes the tight-tight-release-tight gets Sherlock off faster and John thought Sherlock needed to get off before he broke either himself or space-time.
John rushes back to Holmes' bed, tugging a tissue from a box on his way. He calms the furiously beeping machine and says in a rush, "Pleasesqueezethebanana! Where!"
Before John could ask who or where the man swooped away and, for the very first time but not the last, Dr. Watson ran after Mr. Holmes.
I'd wonder this for three reasons:
But first there was soup. A cane loaned. One case. Then two.

They are at opposite ends of the supermarket aisle, the shouting little boys, but Sherlock Holmes' mother and John Watson's father are in the middle, accidentally almost back-to-back, as if each is striving for plausible deniability that the child having the tantrum is theirs.

I can't say I know of any particular honey as being particularly well-loved here and maybe this is because I haven't seen lots of honey in British kitchens. I'm sure it's there, but it doesn't seem a product heavily used in my limited experience. About a third of the folks I know do seem to sugar their tea, but I can't recall anyone putting honey in it.
Fucking fucking
John stands, but doesn't take the billfold. Instead he frowns up at the man and for long, awkward seconds he knows something's peculiar, knows he's overlooked a vital clue, misread the—
"Which part was confusing?"
Before he could hear the completion of that thought, Greg Lestrade dipped his chin a bit, mumbled something to no one in particular, then wandered off. Because while it's true the DI does not do this, that, or the other thing when vexed, Greg does do something pretty well, despite what Sherlock says: He observes.
Sherlock toed off a Fratelli Borgioli, placed a long, bare foot in John's hand. The good doctor slipped a black-velvet stiletto on to it, then shod the other foot.
Which is to say that is why six-year-old John Watson was sitting half under a shade umbrella in this little cafe in the middle of the park, watching his mum talk to some teacher she used to work with over there by the hydrangea, and John's bored, bored,
"Victims?"
When the topic turns to a flatshare downtown Johnny's interested immediately, but the scruffy bloke looks at John, a hunter sighting prey. "Step outside a minute?"
"I'm not falling for that again, Harry."
The lift doors open. No one gets off. Sherlock makes a snap decision:
Instead of going to that Pret, turn right and about 40 seconds from the flat is the Tesco on Melcombe Street. This is the boys' closest chain supermarket. Tesco is the cheapest chain in central London, with pretty much the lowest-end foods, but for your basics, this is where you'd go. Want something nicer? Read on.
Symbols matter, which is why humans make them, and anything can be a symbol. As a scientist Sherlock believed in formulas, but as a human being he'd just learned he believed in signs and portents, in the rightness of a man because that man bore a scar like his own. And though those scars weren't alike, not really—the bullet that got Sherlock wounded only muscle and flesh, not bone—it was still a symbol, one that meant they were alike right where it mattered.
Sherlock Holmes is nothing if not helpful.

"I believe you can't."
Compact. Arms and legs held close. Flyer folded neatly on his lap. Not fidgeting, not looking around, not doing anything but sitting quiet, focused, inward.
The murmur was softer than Sherlock's barefoot dancing about, but he heard it anyway. He turned to John, nestled deep under the duvet, but with one steady, steady hand reaching for him.
The small, humid room in which he stands alone smells like a clean, straw-filled stable.

John looked down at the man's motionless hands. Littered with small scars, not nearly as soft as they should be, they rested warmly and very

"Well lucky me," This time John's grin showed teeth. "I'm thinking of a place in central London. Got a great deal on it because the landlady's daughter is an old army mate of mine. Sound good?"

On bad days you'll find he's his own arch-enemy (some people do have them), inclined to vicious invective when he misreads a social cue, overlooks the obvious, or words fail.
Sherlock stops
Which is why Greg took it upon himself to set up the great Sherlock Holmes.
But John and Sherlock were polite, they waited until the boy was long gone before laughing themselves sillier still.
"Why?"
John was about to say something when the man pointed behind him and precisely at Grace. "DC Superior, the very tall black woman who you—"
Postman's Park is tiny, just a small space quite near the Old Bailey, where the boys are sometimes expert witnesses in criminal trials, it is also close to St. Bartholomew's Hospital, St. Paul's Cathedral, the Barbican, and almost right next to the Museum of London.
and he's looking at some white and purple flowers wave in a sprightly spring breeze.
"Femur!"
A man. Tall. Six feet.
Sometimes Sherlock will, but most times Sherlock just hums back, weaves his fingers through John's hair, and opens wider, whispering, "Fuck, fuck, fuck," until eventually his thighs are shaking as he comes.
Sometimes grey weather gets down into John’s bones and he feels a weird sort of fatalistic. Words won’t work in that instance, so Sherlock takes his love to the best view he knows nearby—Primrose Hill Park—and looking out over things, well for some reason it sets John right.
"I missed you," John said again, only it wasn't about a trip to the loo, it never was. "All my life, I missed you."
Dear Diary,
Neither the DI nor the man on the floor heard him, so
Sherlock shakes his head, confused.
it again, warm lips to an ear hidden beneath a sweat-damp mess of curls, "Hush, it's all right, shhhh."
Sherlock loses his smile. He was prepared for shy mumbling or the squint of a humourously-judging eye. That he got an absolutely certain answer is frankly—
Sort of.
No, instead John looked at the blond hardwood floor at his feet, and then he went Zen and started pacing along the fancy, dark inlay at its edges.

"Lock it again," he said to the constable. "Then give me the key."
Though it doesn't much snow in London any longer, when it last did…that was 2012 as well…Primrose Hill Park was full to bursting with families climbing the tiny hill so kids could sled down. It was positively frantically full and so if you decide to write some mysterious thing happening in a story and you need a crowd, it'd be a bit original to set it in Primrose Hill Park during a surprise snowfall. I'm serious, the whole place was just packed.
He didn't know how to
Infected by the other boy's panic, John clutched his ragged flowers harder and—
"What is it?"
Sherlock kisses John's cheek. This in its turn does two things.
Sherlock Holmes was plastered to his eyeballs—if he'd tried to do any of this flirting thing sober he'd have been dead from a panic attack or frustration—so right now he was happily hammered and metaphorically frolicking naked through a field, not one single inhibited bone in his body.
Sherlock stops. Turns. Sees.
That just left an absurd number of loose apples.
Sherlock stepped close to the DI. John stepped to the next corner…
"Apologise you arrogant shit."
So John feeds him. Keeping hold of the bare wrist, he splays the fingers of his other hand wide on the man's sweat-slick back, and gently, persistently, John moves the rock through quickly-reclosing rapids, up onto a kerb, down a side street.
John opened his mouth, though not to say anything, mostly just to breathe.
So the thing is, I know how stressful the lockdown situation is for everyone. I'm a homebody at heart and even I sometimes go stand in the back garden in the middle of the night, just so I can feel like I went somewhere. So I know people are coping just how they can, and I also know the pandemic is bringing out new sides to people you thought you knew but, but–
All Sherlock does is check the cubbies, then leave his response.

UL, UCL, and SOAS all buttress right up against one another and are right behind the British Museum, so it is barely any time at all to go from one to the other and if nothing else Sherlock could probably have skulked about attending classes as the mood struck.
Because John would fuss with those rocks even when they weren't out of sorts.
Bethany Reeder looked at her very best friend. Then at her own phone. Then at her friend. She murmured softly, as if her heart were breaking, "That's right when the battery died."
So, in my head John and Sherlock go to Primrose Hill just to look at the view on lovely days, but they especially go when John's feeling blue. That doesn't happen to him as
But a bright, strange little boy can learn that he doesn't want to learn some things. If it's not okay to give Andy—who falls down a lot and always has plasters on his knees or his elbows or his chin—something pretty to make him smile, then John doesn't want to know
This meant alone time for the tutor and for Sherlock.
Though it turns out Sai triple-crosses everyone again, evading capture for many more years, John keeps the short hair until London gets cold once more. By that time his ears are erogenous zones.
"Holy shit! It's creme egg ice cream!"
A clench of the jaw, a lick of the lips, an
By the way, if they don't feel like going to the park, John and Sherlock may walk along Regent's Canal, which flows through a large part of London and lies between Regent's Park and Primrose Hill Park. It's a pedestrian path that weaves by the hectic commercialism of Camden Town, through the fussy charms of Little Venice, and on past new and lovely flats built right up to the water.
…well Sherlock? He said yes.
* Another interesting fact about St. Mary's is that it is within walking distance to 221B Baker Street. According to Google and my own two legs, it's less than a mile, most of that along interesting streets with a lot to look at, as opposed to St. Bart's which is three miles from Baker Street and is in a part of town that can be ghost town-ish on the weekends (Bart's is in the financial district of London).
Right about then John Watson contemplated bursting into flames of annoyance and embarrassment.
His little round face was such a hectic red he looked like a rocket ready to launch or about to blow.
Greg feels him before he sees him. And when he turns, what Greg sees is Mycroft Holmes looking at John. Instantly the DI feels like a dolt. A third wheel. A belly button on an angel. Any and all extraneous things. Then he realises Mycroft is asking his partner, "May I cut in?"
And every home in which I've been there was only an electric kettle, never one on the stove top. Electric kettles are always plugged in and must merely be switched on at the base and then turn themselves off when the water boils.
What happens when Sherlock goes where he never ordinarily goes...
Sherlock smiled right back. Accepting that wordless challenge, he stood, stepped up onto his own seat, then armrest-walked a dozen rows down, until he at last jumped onto the raised stage.
John asks if World Cup preparations have bunged up everything in London, if the Lance is done yet, if city hall is still ugly.
Oh yes, that. That bit, there.

Sherlock thought about doing that once. Walking up to the man as if they know one another. He's good at that, too. Sometimes Sherlock does it just to see he still can, convince a stranger they know him, trick someone into revealing too much.
and start talking.
They smiled at each other then. And right after they did that, they did something else. They stared. Into each other's eyes. Except it didn't feel like staring now, it felt like diving deep, no need for air.
"Though I don't want to rush you."
John quickly took hold of Mr. I'm Fine's arm. "Well, based off that nice stumble as you bolted to your feet, I'll guess you're a bit not good. Sit please, let me have a quick look."
"Things'll change soon, just you wait. Uh, an Americano please, I've got to mark papers tonight."
at the hot soups neatly lined up on sandwich shop shelving and looks at the short man beside him.
Despite intensive study, despite interrogating Lestrade—who'd forbidden him to speak of the blackmarket porn case in words of more than one syllable (amazing how constraining such a restriction was on questions of a sexual nature)—Sherlock was no closer to understanding two critical case points. Okay, four points. Maybe six.
When his boss had set them up John hadn't thought to ask about his date's rare name. The good doctor's gone out with an Envie, a Bronte, and a Brooklyn, Sherlock hadn't seemed any stranger.
His resolve lasts six days. Five if you count walking past twelve times. Three if you count the discarded replies he writes on a stack of old post. Not even one if you include his repeated rereadings of the man's note.
Sherlock shoves the little note in his pocket. He drinks his entire beer down. He leaves without writing an answer.
This would be a big bug-bear for Sherlock Holmes in his adult years and without any provocation whatsoever he'll often launch into a nearly-Shakespearean monologue about the elegance of
No, in that narrow aisle Sherlock did what Sherlock does: Exactly what he wanted. And what he wanted was to stare down at his sandy-haired seat mate and flick-flick-flick past the obvious—military, doctor, alone—to observe the less obvious: This small, silent man thrived under fire. Under metaphorical fire, under literal fire, under battlefield conditions that threatened soul and safety.
skull, but the one on his desk.
The funny thing is, John doesn't find the question funny. He should, it's an odd question. But John's not laughing, he's thinking about his answer and he takes his time.
Or there was the time Sherlock briefly lost every deductive capability he had and was so sure John secretly hated his fiftieth birthday gift of a dozen different sorts of haggis—"In honour of your Scottish heritage John!"—that Sherlock actually got nervous hiccoughs and had to put his head down between his knees.
Sherlock smiled. And, even though John had just met the man, the good doctor was absolutely certain that the smile was real and that it was rare. Suddenly John felt sorry for the awkward idiot.
—and the man behind John groans high and long in relief.
After the pub closes the bartender opens the cubbies. He finds in each a single serviette. On every one, the same two words.

"—right here." Sherlock then opened his mouth and sort of dragged his finger down his own bottom lip.
The man was breathing deeper, gearing up to fight or flee.
They both glanced away then, suddenly shy. John looked at all the eyeglass frames. He thought about disguises. Sherlock looked at the white Perspex walls. He thought how easily blood would clean from them.
Instead fourteen-year-old Mycroft Holmes had weaved his fingers into the bench's iron lace and made himself still by holding tight. Because courage is something we teach ourselves, Mycroft knew. So he held tight. And tight. And tight.
"Uh, Rémy and JJ."
And suddenly John gets it, he does, knows exactly what's going on because John's good at snap judgments, at understanding the gravity of any given moment. And so the doctor knows the away man isn't high or drunk or dim, he's just one thing:
is the milieu in which I must fish. The victims claim—"
And then John got up and ran away.
It's always something.
An amendment to Grand-mère Holmes' will—something to do with unmarried males reaching thirty-five without progeny blah blah must bank their genes blah blah assets withdrawn if failure to comply blah blah—has led to Sherlock being where he is, about to do something he has no wish to do.
Sherlock watched in drowsy fascination and finally said softly, "I only made one wish actually."
"Yes, yes they
Thirty-one-year-old John Watson made a drunken
Sherlock smiled, told himself this could be good for his case, that with a little help from a doctor he could more quickly answer questions that had plagued him for weeks.
"Yes, fine, he could be sweetheart to the regiment for all I care. He's a doctor, he can assist me."
"I'm not looking."
"Yes it is."
John Watson's girlfriend sat up quickly. The long-fingered man depilating John's privates went still. And John Watson quickly realised he had said way the fuck too much.
Nope, it didn't look as if the big guy was talking to
Sometimes John wonders what would've happened if he hadn't stopped for coffee that day. If he hadn't seen a stranger trembling. If he'd kept quiet like he told himself to do.
Some lessons are never learned. And some are learned very well indeed.
And with that Mr. Bromley Brown Mousterian exits stage left.
Sherlock frowns. John explains. "It's an LGBT lefty bikers who play snooker group."
"I'll come back," they'd whispered to each other, foreheads pressed together that long-ago afternoon, before Sherlock moved away. "Promise."
The text comes as John arrives at work two days later.
Harry shouldered John in the back. He tripped forward and was about to whine his petulance at her—which Captain John Watson does
They let go, giggling awkwardly. John says, "Sorry. I forgot. This is a lefty club." He does a little finger-twirl gesture, taking in the other bikers.
Which is
Sherlock stumbled back, slid down the wall. "He's dead, Lestrade. Frozen to death by the time we get to him. Just…"
John liked to do that, to think about things. It was interesting and it gave him something to do and John very much liked to be busy, being a naturally sorting-out sort of boy.
That's when Mike noticed the tops of a curly-haired head and one of blonde behind the built-in barbecue. After another moan Mike tip-toed back to the house, giggling.
Sherlock scowled at the walking stick in his hand. "Tripped in an alley behind the Savoy. Caught the arsonist though."
It happens like this:
fics, or to help you imagine when you're reading some.
Mike laughed. "His ex-girlfriend's
Sherlock's socks have been wet since before dawn. He's pretty sure he fractured his toe against the pier railing. He's ridiculously cold.
Sherlock was instantly entranced and mortified. He hiccupped himself to quiet weeping and tried to explain. "They're only little and y–you w-were mean!"
Then Sherlock waited until John had bought them both more coffee before saying, "I'm Sherlock Holmes."
The third time, in Bart's cafeteria, was mostly forgettable.
It was now John's eyes doing the opening wide thing and the rest of him doing nothing. Then he cleared his throat, reached out randomly, and plucked up a pair of frames. They were brown. Faux grained. The little tag called them "Morning Wood." John put them on Sherlock. Sherlock looked very, very good in them. John had thoughts about Sherlock's morning wood. John also began plumping in his pants.

That was when two things happened on instinct.
"This is the one who takes out the hearts while the victim's—"
For four seconds Sherlock Holmes blinked his way through a half dozen separate trains of thought. Then he wrote
Then John frowned. "Where the hell did everyone go?"
you are. And yes, I watched you at the pub quiz nights and at the bonfire—you could have just said hello—and all that time watching you was helping me figure out something that probably I should have figured out a long time ago. Yet, despite the fact that yes, I broke up with Grace because I realised I fancy you, as evidenced by daydreams that have a dozen times left me breathlessly hard in a public place—"
John'll get muddy helping a goose get free of a piece of wire that's trapped it fast, he'll make silly faces at a weeping baby in the park when the father looks so stressed he's about to fall apart, and John'll stand up so fast to get to a hurting human being that he'll knock over his whisky, a double, no ice.
John's about to utter his first and last words to Sherlock—

And his third. Fourth. Fifth.
John nodded. "There are none of the arteries or veins leading off, just the—"
he is. The other thing the man behind him did was apologise. Sincerely. And the third thing the man behind him did was to do all that in a kind and gentle voice.
Maureen extended a hand; James shook it. Each then looked at the other's child. Each had ideas. Fortunately they had the same sort of ideas and within three minutes they'd made four summer playdates for their sons.
wide, admiring, and he says softly, as if right against Sherlock's ear, "It's against every human instinct to let ourselves be hurt, it takes so much bravery to calmly walk into that kind of suffering."
"—and I did these absurd things so that I could show you how smart I am. On Guy Fawkes night the only reason I showed up at the Yard's bonfire thing was so I could show you that I could make a bigger more burny bonfire."
"Yes."
Mr. Holmes does not take it.
"Gorgeous!"
That's the best I can do right now, just…eye stuff. Whatever you think you want to see in an optometry museum it's there. It's tiny, full to its rafters, and I think it's worth every effort to find time to see it. You gotta contact them on their website and who knows, since covid, how easy it'll be to visit, yet I can just say that me and my friend were the only two people inside pre-covid so…*shrug* Give it a go. It's barely even behind Charing Cross station, more to the left and a smudge up.
Sitting in that waiting room, tongue shoved out the side of his mouth, Sherlock wrote that in by hand so carefully it appeared typed. And then he checked the box.
"He's
It happened like this:
Sherlock says something witty—neither later remember what—and finishes up with, "Captain Watson."
"I'm off the clock Sherlock, go away."
7 April
And in the end the TV producer who had been the real target of the dastardly deed was unharmed. She would go on to have an extensive and busy career producing a great many sitcoms, too much reality TV, and a long-running night-time soap.
Mike stopped frowning, looked up, squinted at a limping man coming around the park's splashing fountain.
Sherlock rolls his eyes, grins.
He did something else entirely, as if it explained everything. "My name is Sherlock Holmes. I'm a consulting detective. I solve murders."
For a man on his knees, the good doctor was awfully light-headed. He swayed woozily, reflexively clutched the man's fancy trousers, then squealed.
everything."
"I remember because tib and fib, tib and fib!"
The doctor holds out his hand, "John Watson."
. Literally at the tip of the arrows those two things can be found. I'll have you know I risked getting run over by motor vehicles so I could stand in the road to show you how close the park is to John and Sherlock’s home. So if you wish to set any sort of story in Regent’s Park know that the boys could crawl there with utter feasibility. Depending on your kink one of them might actually be crawling so there you go...
He was clearly totally behind whatever Sherlock was doing, which happens to Sherlock absolutely never.
"Hi. I'm John. John Watson. May I have this dance?"
"If you're, uh, finished there, we could get a pint. Grouse about women. Or the rain. Or who did those stitches at the back of your wrist because that's just criminal."
"That's it," John said, jamming on the brake after the fact, muscles strung so tight Sherlock could hear the man
Sherlock Holmes does not allow himself to be 'set up.' Sex, love, romance—they're pursuits for the terminally
"You can go."
For the splitest of instances, Sherlock pauses. The woman next in the queue looks around to see if anyone heard that. Surreptitiously she begins filming with her phone.
sexy and if the guy was gay he was going to tell him that.
Of course Sherlock can read the man's story in his posture, his haircut, his coat, which is why his apparent sentiment is surprising. Intrigued Sherlock doesn't turn away, instead he steps near and asks, "What's a friend?"
Mike's friend.
somehow he says
John's mum has a lot of friends. Because Madeleine Hamlyn Watson is that perfect balance of inquisitive and conversational. She listens, she talks, then she listens again. There is no one who walks past Maddy who doesn't stop to chat.
and he really likes both those things and so, that's the whole reason little John Watson—"I'm not little I'm six!"—did what he did and so obviously he is blameless.
Now, Captain John Watson, MD, of the Fifth Northumberland Fusiliers and johnwatsonblog.co.uk, doesn't have one fucking clue what sort of scam they may be going for but he's as sure there is one as he is that in his head he calls Sherlock's penis Little Sherlock. And screw whether that's 'infantile behaviour.'
John Watson says it softly, a mantra muttered through pressed-thin lips, but it does not stop the pain.
"Everything's fine sir, PC Piada was just a little worried. We've approved the tugboat and dynamite for Mr Holmes. We won't disturb you again."
"Yeah it is. The drinks are fantastic, the girls even better, and the decor—" Here Harry raised eyebrows toward the reclining man. "—leaves very little to be desired."
Once there he kissed the small of John's back, lipped the skin and licked his lips. Fresh sweat, salt-sweet.
one? That was the one where Sherlock waited patiently, so patiently outside that therapy room, and he asked John if he liked Chinese, and he told him he knew a place, a good one, he could always tell by the lower third of the door handle and…
"Lieutenant John Watson."
After long moments John reaches back. And so two men are fed.
Then one night the good doctor Watson saw his first and only
London is still London and forever will be, but she's a slower city now in some ways and watching people march through the railway station's arches, Sherlock wonders what his world would have been when this station was built, if 1840s London was

"Be still My, I've got you."
"Cortado!"
. This cafe is fantastic for many reasons. It's a cafe and that means caffeine, reason enough. But it's also a lovely place to be when it rains because the glass walls mean you feel as if you're outside—and yet you remain dry. If you're tired and don't want to walk around you can be inside during a nice day and still feel you're outside. You can get a light meal and simply bask in London. I think all of these features would appeal to Dr. Watson and probably he'd drag Sherlock with him on days when it's miserable out and the criminals are resting. They might even get up to a few things there (ahem:
"I missed you," John said, pulling him close.
Arousal.
John stops frowning and blinks his eyes wide. "What?"
Then Sherlock reads.
He told John how the prickly-soft hair felt against his kissing, kissing mouth. How Sherlock couldn't lip at it, could barely take hold of it with his teeth.
And "ding-dong" went the downstairs doorbell just in time for John to push Sherlock off his chest, grab the case file, and head out the bedroom door.
"Will you do me a favour?"
He's not helpful.
Then mummy looks left because her friend is pointing and mummy
and so John kept talking and before he shut up they were in Barking for Christ's sake and the tube had long since emptied but neither of them had moved much, neither had stepped away.

One day in Regent's park nearly eight-year-old John learned that he was a dab shot with a flower head. This led to learning he was even better with a Sig Sauer P226R.
Though the boys don’t often catch a train from the Marylebone Station, preferring Paddington or Euston Railway stations, as they tend to offer more trains at more times…well, still, on summer evenings they like strolling past Marylebone—it’s quite literally around the corner, being barely a quarter mile away from 221B.
Sherlock Holmes wanted to be in love.
It takes ninety eight breaths.
doing. Done trying. It'd be over.
"Ah."
Saying
John went and sat back down then but, as if they were connected already, satellites bound tight in orbit around one another, Sherlock followed and stood in front of John's chair.
Sure he'd heard about this Holmes guy, another poncy git if the stories were true, a mouthy man who'd second-guess every diagnosis, argue the placement of a plaster each time he came in bruised and bleeding. The thing is, when John asked
"Misery loves company," John said softly, "not because we wish one another ill, but because being sad is a lonely business."
"You wouldn't tell us why you're here, not last week, not the weeks before." John started unbuttoning his shirt. "I thought it must be awful, what happened to you, because you've been so awful to us."
Sherlock ignores the receptionist's sharp knock and trilling call, just as he's ignored her for the last thirty minutes.
And now…the environs of New Scotland Yard.
It was the first time that 'the Holmes guy' would say yes to the army doctor, but it wouldn't be the last. Though he
But Sherlock doesn't get time to throw a wobbly, because the man is talking again.
"Don't do that."
John giggles to himself, "Well, I suppose it
He puts the soup on the table and stares at it because he's trying to remember something he's forgotten. He—
that he shakes his head and growls because
It's not that the man's particularly pretty. He's all right in a compact, loose-jointed way. He moves comfortable in his skin. And it's not as if the man's easily-overheard repartee is all that winning. Oh, he gets on, makes people laugh, but anyone can do that. Even Sherlock can pretend to be nice.
"—watch out for ghosts? Ha, yeah thanks Mrs H. No no, I'll get the door, it's snowing and we don't want you getting the sniffles again. Back late!"
Sherlock sighed, as if at the end of an exhaustive lecture. "They put together profiles, perform case studies, but of course they don't know because they don't see."
They begin walking in separate directions, but within two strides both stop. Turn.
Sherlock Holmes doesn't have friends. Not one.
asked me to come so I could be your wingman and…and…" Greg remembers exactly what Sherlock had said, but he wants to make him say it again.
John looked around for the DC and then yes, there she was, all six feet of her by the sparkly Christmas tree, meeting John's gaze.
John opened his mouth to reply but a drunken, pontificating Sherlock did not notice. (To be fair, an abstemious, pontificating Sherlock also would not notice.) "I assure you that your ex-lover does not care that you are…that you're…" Sherlock's mouth was fairly sober but the part of his brain sparsely stocked with idiom was still pretty hammered. "…snogging me."
And in the middle of the street, in the middle of these thousands, stands Sherlock Holmes, not moving. Staring.
James was impressed. "I'm impressed! My boy's more the hands-on type I guess. He taught himself forty different kinds of knots and hitches. And we don't even have a boat."
Sherlock stood, leaned heavily on his stick. He was frowning at the fountain and Mike was no fool, he knew there was something the man was trying to say.
Sherlock wants him to look back.
The blonde boy kept doing that.
He keened when John tugged his hair.
A week later a scruffy-looking bloke shows up at John's local. Buys John and Johnny a beer. Talks about his successful fishing holiday.
By the time they were in their late twenties they'd done enough to know that no one else
John tilted his head and only
Because even while they ate, every few minutes some adult would duck through the door of the crêperie and ask, "Has anyone seen a little blond boy? His name is John and he was scared and someone saw him running this way but no one can find him."
"Look, all I know," John Watson said, standing in front of a Tesco cold case, searching for his longed-for treat, "is that the person who wrote me that letter sounded under duress."
heard about twenty minutes later when he came out to check on his friends was…was that moaning?
Sherlock grunted deep, and John's teeth tugged. Sherlock keened and John tugged harder. This went on awhile, until Sherlock started to shake, and then five, four, three, two…Sherlock moaned, stilled, and started to come and come, a wonderful sticky-wet heat that pooled right through John's dark jeans.

John Watson glanced at the woman on his other side, crossed his legs, stared straight ahead.

ask," with a tip of the head toward Cesare. Then Sherlock had planned to follow that up by chuckling in an appealingly genius-like way.
When he means
"My name is Sherlock," Sherlock says, "And you're welcome."
For example, there is this plaque:
"I'm looking."
Maybe I'll do an entry here focusing just on the museum. Sherlock could find no end of clues in there I think, and so could
Not one of the people John looked at were looking at him in a
But then again, he doesn't stay long.
John Watson inhaled so sharply he snorted his own spit, then choked on it. As he suffocated, he stumbled three steps to the left, away from the big man holding a strand of anal beads.
It doesn't take any kind of genius to understand what Sherlock's not saying, so John says it for him. "So you exposed yourself, because you're allergic to kapok, too."
By the time Lestrade got to the actor and the anesthesiologist there wasn't even disdain on Sherlock's part or much interest left on Greg's.
More frowns. More tears. More mucus. More grass pats.
He's glad that Sherlock told him, so he tells Sherlock something.
Which is why Sherlock was sanguine about deducing Dr. John Watson despite their acquaintance consisting of four grumpy phone conversations.
John is so going to do some shouting later, but right now he's going to take a deep breath, take it down a notch, and
"Nearly there."
And that the loving is as easy as a step taken in unison, as right as a hand on a heart.
It contains The Watts Memorial to Heroic Self Sacrifice.
John grunted with each long and messy suck, then keened each time Sherlock mewled in pleasure. "Sher…Sher…oh Sher…mmmmmm."
The two boys got along like fire and fuel. At the top of their lungs they shared with each other everything Maddy taught them, then everything they learned on their own. Including the highest mountains in the world, coffee drinks—
Without waiting for a reply John rose, reached for Sherlock's hand, grinning, "Greg told me about that. Amazing. Really remarkable."
"—insulting." The short-haired biker is standing up and looking down. "So why don't you just take your bad attitude, mister, and go fuc—"
Because
The grudgingly stilled crowd wants to move again, they shout words that are not as kind.
"Manaslu! Eight thousand one hundred and fifty-six!"
but John heard them anyway.
At this point it'd be entirely inappropriate for John to insist otherwise.
"No," he says to no one. Splitting the controlled-release pill will just rush the drug into his system. He's seen soldiers get addicted that way, quick as…as…
Both men glance at the woman with the camera phone. She smiles and does a little finger wave.
The lift doors open. Four people who were going to get off stay on. Sherlock's cheeks go a deeper red.
A long moment of silence followed.
It does. It did. And eventually
Use it John had, however, and that's probably when everything began changing, because it was then Sherlock started to see what he was seeing.
God he was big.
"Helloooo?"
"I think we'll use the seafoam blue wrap today. It matches your eyes."
That's when eleven wingmen and wingwomen bluster and chatter and exit the lift en masse. Four spontaneously begin a conversation just outside, 'accidentally' blocking the lift doors until they close.
John heads over to the 'queer pansy' in the tight jeans. Eyes made up, spike-heeled boots on his feet, the man emphatically doesn't belong in a dodgy neighborhood pub with dried beer in the corners and walls the colour of bile.
Another crisp turn, this time back toward the table. "How did you…did my boss…uh. Yes. Please. But it's actually a mocha latte."
Two days later they were flatmates.
Sherlock Holmes snorted and rolled his eyes. "Because you're straight?"
Smart, certainly. Smarter than his tutors, his brother, nearly as smart as mummy. With a bit more time Mycroft is reasonably certain he'll match the sharpness of his mother's mind if not exceed it.
John was small. John was terrified. And John could not move.
This time John stumbled to his feet, instinctually waiting for bombs or shouts, ready to command or be commanded.
Good lord with the questions.
John Watson heard but did not listen. He didn't know a soul at this seminar. No one could possibly be talking to him.
for college you god damn arse. God damn it Sherlock you could have gone to UCL or something. Fucking
And maybe I'll sort of back you up on all this because let me be honest: I've not had any locum work in a month and I sit in this coffee shop four hours a day sometimes and this would be the most stimulating thing I've done in weeks."
And didn't look away. Or move. He just kept looking at John, one big hand holding the sofa, and John didn't ordinarily think thoughts like
people, not
"Okay. Well you got it pretty bad with that cricket bat and I know you hurt like a bastard right now. Is there a way I can help with the pain?"
"I want some," John Watson laughed low, holding Sherlock's eye. Then, eventually, tilting toward him a tiny, empty glass.
Sherlock stood and looked down. On his knees, John looked up. All kinds of magical things happened in the intervening space, none of which either man perceived at that moment. That did not stop them from absolutely changing everything.
More blinking. Realisation. "Oh."
The man does.
They had made a promise to each other. Years and years ago. But John Watson and Sherlock Holmes? They keep their promises.
"It was drool Sherlock! On the sheets! She's been feeding her husband poison!"
sort of way, so John looked back to the tall, drunk guy, who still held a long finger aloft. "I'm…Shhhhhhh..."
So when John's mum comes back to their table with a tiny dark-haired boy beside her and says a bunch of stuff to him about "son of a friend's friend" "play together" and "do you need anything?" John's young nervous system is entirely too overloaded to do anything but allow for blinking and vague nods.
before Mycroft realised that the foul effluvium coming from his little brother's butt had been…planned.
Sherlock didn't realize he'd spoken. Apparently at length. Which was now par for the course it seemed, because he also hadn't realized until three minutes ago that he blinks wide-eyed when he can't see well. This stranger's body might be going toward decrepitude but Sherlock's was clearly on a trip to self-rule. This was made even more obvious by the fact that, though he wished to right this minute say something rude in reply to the stranger with the nice teeth and the big blue eyes, Sherlock said nothing.
Sherlock ignores these comments, too. Then John Watson says something Sherlock can't ignore.
Sherlock Holmes wriggle-shifted on the grass, placed his little bear in the hollow of his crossed legs, then curled over her, protective.
It was blissful-warm beneath the duvet. Sherlock's cold toes sang an ode. Then John sang one when Sherlock discovered his morning wood and wriggled deep to get at it.
Sherlock blinks. "What?"
know where stories come from? Well, I think I do: Rather one thing I think I know is a certainty and the other a supposition.
"As if a rat tail stopper or icicle butterfly knot was any more likely!" Sherlock's voice was shrill and there were at least seven good reasons for that. Their names had been Arem, Sarah, and Essar when he was eight and nine and ten, their names had been Matthew, Edward, Ruth and Aisling when he was fifteen and sixteen and seventeen. There had been others, always others to mock Sherlock if he didn't know something, to mock him even more when he did, until Mr Holmes learnt the lesson they never meant to teach—if you don't know a thing make shit up, back it up bombastically, and if you're caught out
John Watson's girlfriend sat up so quickly her logo-emblasoned turban listed left. The long-fingered man meticulously depilating John's privates went still. And John Watson quickly realised he had said
The man doesn't know he's banging his head against the window, John's sure of that. John's less sure of himself as he comes alongside the stranger and says in what he hopes is a pleasant voice, "Bad day?"
Pushing his bulky body—they'd tried to get him to check his coat—through the crowd, then past a dozen sets of knees, Sherlock at last arrived beside his seat mate.
any of those times, they just wandered off after he sighed a lot and do you know what? It was fine, it was a-a-all…
I was going to put
"What a pretty name. It sounds like a mystery, doesn't it? Mine's John. That sounds…that sounds…hmmm…"
Sherlock was so shocked he hiccough-inhaled his own spit and then cried some more because that hurt. After awhile he wiped his nose with both hands and cried even more because now the snot was just so shiny and disgusting and by the time John came back Sherlock was in such a state it took an entire ten seconds to realise his new friend had returned.
Sherlock thought,
They can make you dead really fast if you eat them!"
Stamford covered his eyes with his hands, which did nothing to hide his laughter-shaking shoulders.
Again Sherlock pokes his tongue around his mouth until he seems satisfied he's got control of it again, then he points to the nearby purple flowers dancing in the frisky breeze.
A few hours later Angelo brings them some nice cake. And a candle.
"It's an alpine butterfly loop at the end of a rat tail stopper knot.
Squinting in over-bright department store light, John frowned. "Tall. Dark. Imperious."
Lestrade tucked his chin and said, "If we can follow protocol just a bit, then—"
So the stranger did.
Sherlock reads those two dozen words a half dozen times, snaps his laptop closed, texts the tech who'd done the tox screen on the dead child. The next day the father is cleared of the poisoning charge.
John grins and wonders how the big git got his number. He shoves his mobile in his pocket, pretends he's not going to reply. At half six he does.
If you find that St. Mary's doesn't suit your stories, I'd also highly recommend St. Thomas' hospital which frankly
what he's doing here.
Sherlock's brief joy at the admiration is tempered to resignation, because here it comes. After Sherlock does his Sherlock thing, he's grown used to thank yous that aren't, thank yous that ignore what he just did by asking him to do more, but that's not what he gets now.

Writing Sherlock fan fiction is made easier for me because I now live in London. I can literally peer over the side of a bridge to see if it's feasible John would jump from it to go after a *&^%$# cache of evidence dropped in the river, I can say with conviction how unlikely they are to take a cab past Harrods on their way to Brixton (I'm looking at you Moftiss).
Sherlock narrows his eyes and finds he's waiting for another shove of that sturdy shoulder. Instead John points with his chin again, and says, "That man there. What can you tell me about him?"
This is his city still and she has known good and she has known bad, and London town, she has survived it all.
John presses his ear to Sherlock's back and listens to the rumbling, then the pounding of Sherlock's heart, then its slow steadying. Eventually Sherlock says, "Y'r turn," all lispy-tired, and John holds him still when he tries to shift.
John Watson spent many years in the military. John's dealt with his fair share of big gits desperate for attention. He's learned the best way to shut them up is to feign deafness.
"Attention-seeking? I'm not the one wearing an
Dr. John Watson, however, knew three entirely different things:
Sherlock was plastered to his eyeballs—if he'd tried to do any of this flirting thing sober he'd have been dead from a panic attack or frustration—so right now he was happily hammered and metaphorically frolicking naked through a field, not one single inhibited bone in his body.
Chin to chest, still smiling, the man sips his drink and gazes up at Sherlock. That's when Sherlock decides to gather evidence.

"—once I learned of Mr. Rossetti's symptoms, I suspected his wife. She dusted the pub with powdered kapok, to which a rare few are allergic. The immune response for a healthy but sensitive man would be extreme but not fatal. Chemotherapy had left Mr. Rossetti with an immune system far from strong." Sherlock shrugs. "But I had no proof. The police couldn't search without proof." Sherlock shrugs again.

"That's because I buy your beer."
Sherlock went back to bed, he always did.
Absolutely at the end of his ever-short tether, Sherlock Holmes stood up noisily, took three steps left, and sat down clamourously on an already-occupied sofa.
I love the smell of verisimilitude in the morning!
Professor Maureen Vernet Holmes taught mathematics at both Harrow and Westminster, performed experiments in the labs she had at each institution, and wrote a half dozen academic papers a year. And yet…and yet the professor still somehow managed to be at home whenever a tutor was in the house.
"—was asleep you know."
"Are you blind? You're not even trying and—there, him, the blond? He's attempted to catch your eye half the night. And that woman? Her military kink's nearly as big as she hopes your—"
"I don't want to. I mean, I don't…I'm not… And he's a… Isn't he?"
John's heard just about everything at these events. From toe-curling lies to heart-palpitating candour, he's watched lonely people move from table to table, trying to change their voices, their expressions, their
John opened his mouth in a hint of a suggestion of a promise of kissing but he did not actually kiss. "Excuse me?"
"Are you through?"
And, sat under a shade tree a few dozen feet away, Mycroft Holmes echoed those grins. Slowly he withdrew the fingers he'd tight-clutched into the iron lace of his park bench.
"Oh god I must really love you to have said yes to this."
Sherlock squinted at his own reflection in one of the big, shiny shop mirrors. Despite being barely two feet from the glass, he couldn't actually make out his own face all that well, so he raised his eyebrows the better to see.
At the fourth lesson Sherlock observed that John breathed faster just before Sherlock touched him, but steadied to calmness when he did.
Even if you don't use any of these names, you now know you can damn well
Too late.
As if in immediate proof John Watson frowns, sighs. Then with a rueful smile he presses a palm to his belly. "You deduced about the diet, didn't you?"

"That's not a real drink!"
The point is that the biker, the short-haired man with the big boots, the white vest, the black leather waistcoat and tight trousers, is…he is…Sherlock keeps staring at him because he doesn't know what the man is, except distracting.
It's right then that Sherlock finally
Sherlock Holmes stopped spinning the little eyeglass carousel. He checked behind him, but the optometrist and her staff were somewhere not here. It was eight on a winter night and the only two people in the brightly-lighted optometry shop were Sherlock Holmes and this suddenly-talkative stranger.

"Your hand is on my penis."
Ha! I just noticed my own pun! But mutiny is very appropriate here because this is about Sherlock. Sherlock Holmes. I know you're a brand new diary for 2021, so you won't have heard of him, but he's a big deal in dead body circles, and I used to have a crush on him.
Sherlock Holmes narrowed his eyes. Of all the things in all the world the soldier could have said just then, that word was the only one which would have intrigued. Because Sherlock belatedly observed the obvious: the soldier was interested in him.
John rose so sharply his chair skidded backward. As if on a string Sherlock stood, too. Five other sets of eyes went wide.
DangerMouse's false smile is long since gone. "Good god, it's true what they say. You really are a dic—"
Clad in a thin and faded t-shirt he's the rock around which these human rapids flow, and because this is high noon on a hot London day, the bodies pressing against him are as bare as he. Their sweat-slick arms rub at his, they are so many strangers and they push past him, skin against skin against skin.
and he couldn't tell if John wanted to beat the shit out of him or screw him and it didn't matter, the guy dropped the damn bat and flew like one down that alley and—hosanna!—right into the brace of waiting coppers.
Now, the thing is, if you ever wanted to write your own version of that scene but wanted to use a different setting, you could do that. Because though Arthur Conan Doyle chose for the boys to meet at St. Bartholomew's hospital, there are other hospitals at which they could have met, ones as old, and at least one far more beautiful.

Other times it was John's sounds, breathy pants that came in threes and fours, or vague words like "Ah, ah, ah," or half-uttered "Oh…oh Sher…" as he thrust shallow in Sherlock's mouth. Right now it was husky little grunts of "Yes," while Sherlock's tongue teased round the slick head of John's cock.
"She's a vet, Mike." John gave Sherlock a leisurely once over again. "And you're a…?"
The man meets his eye and stands. John smiles, nods, and walks a very long twelve feet.
Sherlock turns, looks. John's smile is—Sherlock can't think of the word for it right now but he will later, he'll think of the word and that word will be

So both children were seen by the same doctor at the same time, sitting side-by-side on the exam bench.

Sherlock turned to the knee man. "What?"
then goes on to say because Sherlock has no reticence at all about anything ever is that John was so excited after their dangerous little escapade concluded twenty-six hours later he clapped both hands over Sherlock’s ripe behind, snogged him senseless, and
John ignored the interruption. "Looks healthy despite his weight—"
It had to do with how a friendship that will last a lifetime began, how two children together grew into men.
Stories come from
"S-s-sssstron—" hisses Sherlock, but he can't finish.
The best ones, though, they're worth it.
"These should better suit your girlfriend."
John Watson's eyes shifted back and forth fast. His sister does this to him. She always does this to him. She plays word games. No, not games, ploys. No, not ploys. Fishing. It's fishing. Harry will say a lie so that he corrects with the truth, a truth that's his business, except…well…except...
Sherlock Holmes will deduce anyone, any time. He'll deduce you before he's met you, he'll deduce you after three words, he'll damn well deduce you from the teeth marks you leave in your toast.
He'd collected nine pins from a teacher and three other kids, and with them John carefully stitched Rosie's belly together while Sherlock leaned close, huffing mucusy little wheezes against the side of John's face.
"Or you can buy the detective inspector's next drink and socialise like a civilised person, what do you say Mr.…?"
Then Sherlock takes one second more to tease through the jaw-dropped reality that his throat's gone dry and he's breathing funny and… "Yes."
John had no actual answer to give and so he gave none. That was apparently fine by the drunk guy, who suddenly shouted, "I know, I'm Herlock Sholmes!" The outburst caused the man to sway again, this time with less serenity. He employed the wall to help the room stop spinning. "No, wait."

that the exchange begins.
While he spoke Sherlock had watched John's reflection in cafe glass and only when that reflection went wide-eyed with dismay did Sherlock realise what John's expression had been
They are both pink cheeked as Sherlock moans his relief, and at this point John is beginning to have suspicions. John is hoping his suspicions are correct.
"They've been through so, so much. The…grooms."
Sherlock nods toward the woman. "You know her."
Though why John, well past thirty, had had the childish expectation that he'd be running down dark alleys with police, he wasn't sure. In the end he was on rotation between a half-dozen city boroughs, where he gave flu jabs to detectives and constables at the end of their shifts, and he explained the difference between a virus and bacteria vis-à-vis antibiotics.
John Watson is now nowhere near Sherlock Holmes' nipples. Instead he is nestled snug-tight in the divot of Mr Holmes' belly button, giving it a good rummage. They are both pink cheeked as Sherlock moans his relief, and at this point John is beginning to have suspicions. John is hoping his suspicions are correct.

"No I'm not."
"Patella!"
is probably not what he's going to say—but he never does find out because Sherlock talks for him. And for his brother. And probably for god and his twelve apostles, who the hell knows?
Drunk-tripping across a minefield of feet and chair legs, John took hold of the burly man’s raised wrist and said, “Let him go.”
A couple dozen feet distant, Greg Lestrade closed the garden gate quietly.
It is for a good reason though, and the reason is the explosions.
though not what they mean when applied to the previous two).

It was good Sherlock went away though, and it was good that John followed in his footsteps, first with the army and then his own stint at college, studying medicine.
So this year John places his wreath on one headstone and for two people.
He was always pleased with himself after, when the pretty plants all had their nice border lined up again. Grandmum said all that shifting was going to give him big muscles one day, and John always crooked his arm then and made a muscle-y face.
He doesn't hear the crowd.
John Watson took a deep breath.

The seated man looks up. His fixed smile falters. Then falls away.
It did not go well.
However, sometimes John makes exceptions. Oh my yes. If his last nerve is trod on, John Watson's quite willing to give big gits all the attention they so desperately crave. Only not necessarily in the way that they crave it.
What did surprise John just now, stretched out on their bed and eyeing Rosie stuffed up on a cobwebby bookshelf corner, was that he'd never asked Sherlock a very important thing about that bear.
Though little Johnny was now also offering in-depth details of a sneaky mash Auntie Vee had once made out of the dreaded cauliflower "instead of poe-tay-toes!" still and all James Watson heard the other tiny terror's voice and turned. "Your son knows how to read already?"
"I'll go talk to him."
John H. Watson is a war veteran, an ex-surgeon, and once chased an insurgent through a field of detonating fireworks. He is a difficult man to startle.
Then, without a word, John Watson and Sherlock Holmes began to move.
Hands and knees pressed together, John Watson's body language was not just closed, it was locked down tight.
So John points out the bright red or blue or rainbow colours on the London Eye off to the right. They both like the Eye best when there's some sort of event going on and the colours of the lights ringing the Eye reflect the event.
No, this grave is sad because the ashes of the man's descendent are now interred with him. Named after her ancestor, Willa Tyler not only followed William into the police service but she, like he, died young and in the line of duty.

Sherlock Holmes both lifted his chin and looked down his nose. He's unused to being sassed by strangers. By 'colleagues,' yes, by his brother, his brother's assistant, the downstairs neighbor, the corner grocer, the dry cleaner, and by his landlord, certainly, but not usually by people unfamiliar with him.

Yes, he had. Who
The second kiss was the kind of friendly buss John likes. Firm but not aggressive, a bright hello, a promise, and John was sure it was from the host's sister. (It was from the host.)
In the end they did not much talk about women.
Drawn to an earthy scent and the amber and russet glow of open cigar boxes, John enters the tobacconist's humidor and—
Because John only ever had one hour exactly before returning to base.
Sherlock looked down at his arms. In the dark he couldn't
Since he was about eight years old Sherlock's known what to say to get what he wants. Most of the things he has to say are by necessity lies but that's fine, if they get him what he wants he'll lie all day. And this doctor knows the Scotland Yard detective inspector, the one who

Round and round…
Sherlock's ready now, would be on tip-toe, rising to meet the next word, if he weren't purposely keeping himself still. "Yes," he murmurs.
Near the station are cafes, restaurants, and the Landmark (where you might recall Sherlock briefly became a French waiter), as well as supermarkets, businesses, and Western Eye Hospital, but even with all that there is, in truth, not much reason for the boys to wander over to that part of town often, unless they're craving those pasties again.
"And snooker."
"Patella."
"Even if people are watching."
"Release the wheel."
"Let me help."
Sherlock Holmes reached across the shoe-strewn table, plucked the heel from the short man's hand and said, "Describe her in three words."
They never do make it out to John's motorbike that night, but Sherlock
Paddington is probably the next station I’ll show, and yes, Paddington Bear is named after it. They even have a brass statue of the little charmer, right beneath the lovely Paddington clock. But that’s for some other time.
After several silent seconds John nods again, rises. "Right. Good. You should—" He stops. Starts again. "I'd—" No. Never mind. He knows when people will hear.
Reflexively John Watson began picking at the moustache bandage on his elbow, leaned even closer and said, "I'm John." What he said after that he said right up close to Sherlock's ear, soft and whispery, evil and
forum. Most leave comments nitpicking Sherlock's methods or conclusions, his morals or his manners. Of course Sherlock replies to these. In detail. The day they're posted. But John Watson's praise? To that Sherlock has not responded once.
Sherlock breathes deep, lets it out sibilant and slow, "Shhhhherlock."
Sherlock cuddled the bear gently to his chest and said, "This is Rosie." Then Sherlock felt the need to explain a few things. In detail.
As they got to the award for best theme music in an advert of over fifteen seconds but less than thirty, a bored silly John wandered toward the dark-haired man, ready to strike up a conversation.
"Why on earth would they do that?"
Is a friend someone who nods when passing you in the shops? Do friends pick up your post when you're away? Do they notice you skirting crime scene after crime scene and one day tilt their head in your direction until a distracted detective inspector looks up, looks over, then finally

That was when John and Sherlock learned exactly who they were together and that together was what they were meant to be.
Within five minutes of their second playdate Sherlock had taken John's hand, walked them the twelve metres to the local library—Maureen and Altamont Holmes had picked

From it you can see the London Eye, the BT Tower, and St. Paul's. They are all of them gorgeous at night and Primrose Hill park never closes, unlike Regent's Park, whose gates are locked at dusk (I have hurried through the park many nights, sure I was going to get locked in and slightly-somewhat-a-lot-pleased by the thought). Anyway...

The man huffed in Sherlock's face and for the first time all day—all week—something was not
Sherlock is used to railway stations like this being a source of stresses big and small, with too many people cluttering his eye-line and chattering his ears full being chief among them. Yet the pandemic is in its second year now, and things are different.
However, sometimes Sherlock makes exceptions. Listening carefully, he carefully enters the code for one apple.
"Third and finally, I just need one important thing first."
The lop-sided grin he returns to each bar patron who buys him a drink, his casual acceptance when a few of the men touch his hip or back? Well these say he's gay. The combination hints toward an easy bisexuality, and it isn't until Sherlock's mind veers friskily toward the word
"Come back," John mumbled sleepily, both arms reaching from the bedclothes. Sherlock turned off the loo light, yawned jaw-cracking deep, fell back on to the bed. John's arms wrapped round his shoulders and they both slept again.
But the short man's piping-hot mocha latte at last stopped spinning and plunged to the floor—splashing smartly over both of Sherlock's seven hundred pound Tom Ford monk-strap brogues—and the contents of the saucer that had been under John's coffee cup, now ever so full of slightly-cooler latte, landed in the lap of Sherlock's Spencer Hart suit.
Maureen Vernet knew that this bit of exotic fruit also cost six pounds, and that there was a seventy percent chance her picky child would take one sniff of the sliced thing and pronounce it either indigestible, unpalatable, revolting or, his current favourite, "Poithonouth." Sherlock might be only four but his feelings were much larger than the vessel in which they were contained.

Then, just as they began noticing each other in a new way, one of them moved away, and both of them grew up.
John tugged until his scarred shoulder was bare. "For the longest minute of my life I believed in god. I prayed the same words Yvonne did, exactly the same. 'Please god, let me live.' But I'm not elegant like she is, I kept going, a babble of promises, things I would do, wrongs I would right."
Before he could put the full stop on his last directive—"And absolutely no touching"—a non-scent-wearing, facial hair-free person bowed before the blindfolded doctor and pressed their lips to his.

Sherlock exhales.

Maybe that promise was why John returned to London after Afghanistan. Maybe it was why Sherlock turned down that perfect job offer in Paris.

from the thing he wasn't, so Sherlock Holmes vented his frustration by undoing his seat belt, reaching over, and prying his student's fingers off the steering wheel.
On the ground John strokes the gelding's soft side. "Mike belongs to an old army friend of mine. Now and again I get to take him out for a bit of a bareback stroll through the park." The man smiles. "I'm John."
"John Watson's dieting. And prefers chocolate to caramels."
"Because you let me help. It's good you know, helping."
Sherlock blinked. "That's not what people usually say."
"Shut it, Johnny."
"I missed you," John said in response. He always did.
John sits down. "So. Greg Lestrade thinks you're some kind of cranky wunderkind. I think you're lonely. Who's right?"
Sherlock now knows exactly how far this will go…all the way up his street if he lets it. He is emphatically going to let it. By denying it entirely.
It ended with their first kiss, their second kiss, and a good old-fashioned feel-up as Sherlock rubbed John's decrepit knees, which had refused to unlock after John had crawled under a table in search of a tiny eyeglass screw.
The point, the whole point, the sharp pokey point of the point is that Sherlock is three seconds from either telling the man to go away so that he can
Eventually he was assigned to the Met's Westminster borough. There, in the heart of the city, things picked up. Sometimes he saw officers who'd suffered an interesting sprain, a scrape, a bruise. More times he saw officers who needed an ear, or encouragement, or just a moment to breathe. Before he knew it, John felt relevant again, of use. Whatever he'd missed, he'd finally found it.

Sherlock stood lance tall, tugged woolen armour tight, hooded eyes going hard as any helm.
Both men shut up. Both wait because, though they may indeed be idiots, they are idiots who are aware that they find the other quite a little bit of all right.
Still, the DI does love a puzzle and so eventually there was a baker, a beekeeper (that had a promising five minutes), another coroner, and an undertaker. There was an older man, a younger woman, an older woman, twins (one of each), two detective constables, and a chemist.

So if he tries telling the man his date's about to excuse herself to the ladies and leave through the back door with his wallet, Sherlock knows somehow he'll say
Then he saw everything else.
When Sherlock had stopped courting bees on a hawthorn shrub—that's what he called his efforts to coax the insects close, "I'm courting them My!"—and walked toward the little bridge, Mycroft had looked up from his book.
The desert taught John how to be the kind of doctor he wanted most to be. Taught him about the part of the Hippocratic oath that said warmth and sympathy were as important as the surgeon's knife, the chemist's drug…or his own damned ego.

John did. He opened his legs wider.
"Why do you want to know?"
He doesn't move.
"No it's not!"
John then suddenly stepped out of his trousers. This was mostly because Sherlock had just gone and pushed him over and dragged the trousers off. With John's shoes
And when the great big seventy kilo dog, whose name was Buddha, opened his giant mouth to yawn, John saw so many terrible sharp teeth and such a huge wet tongue, that six-year-old Johnny Watson completely lost his shit and screamed—
he met Sherlock Holmes.
Sherlock stops writing and Sherlock doesn't look up. He wants more than anything to look up. He wants more than anything for John to come back, to be the brave one.
Sherlock took the frames off, let them clatter to a tiny table behind him, stepped away from them as if they'd put their hand on his bottom. He was in such trouble.
As they'd been doing for the last hour, everyone in the therapy group turned toward Sherlock. The newest in their small group of five, most kind of welcomed his annoying interruptions. Because sometimes you lose patience with your own misery, and foisting your pique onto an irritating stranger? It does make for a nice change.

Sherlock Holmes looks up, at the man between whose thighs this beauty stands.
guy. That guy was texting like a tweener.
Close they do. Seconds pass. Then more seconds. John presses every last button on the panel. He now has forty-two floors of opportunity. He intends on using every one of them. He turns to Sherlock. "So Mister, uh…?"
Sherlock narrowed his eyes. "Always."
By the time John was placing the last pin in his patient, Sherlock was wiggling back and forth on his bum, anxious and grabby. The moment John held Rosie up Sherlock clutched her and squeezed her. "Thank you!" he shouted into her belly and John grinned a big
Sherlock's brain rat-tat-tats:
Deducing all these things, Sherlock nevertheless sipped his lukewarm coffee and waited for follow-up questions. In front of him and to his right an expensive machine busily dripped rich espresso into a porcelain mug and a short man drummed his fingers on a cafe countertop.
stories, whether you write the boys ducking inside one to take cover from the rain, or have them running to catch a dawn train to Cardiff or Oxford.
John didn't say that, wouldn't say it any of the times his colleagues complained about a patient. Neither of them had served, neither had put a soldier back together to a soundtrack of moaning because the morphine was running out and most of the oxycodone had again "disappeared."
John nods, too. "I'm sorry."

But DI Superior did end up waiting an twenty extra minutes before Dr. Watson saw her.
Only a fool tries driving down Portobello Road on a summer Saturday, but the world's in no short supply of those, so the lorry driver leans out his window and yells again.
To state it more plainly, eating out John's arse will be one of Sherlock's many pleasures in life, as will sucking John, bathing John, cuddling John, bickering with John, being married to John.
Sherlock takes one step toward the doors.
that way either, Sherlock's not sure. Because he doesn't know how you define friend really.
stops to talk with him.
It is only by virtue of his agility that Sherlock missed getting a cold case door handle to the gut. For creme egg he'd have accepted plate glass to the face.
John Watson spoke. "What was the killer's name?"
So their first time neither man even got his kit off. They kissed, they humped, they shoved their trousers to their thighs and stroked one another until they came.
"What's your name?"
John Watson held his breath. He succeeded in not looking the man up and down, in not letting his gaze roam to plunging neckline, lacquered nails, the curve-following fit of the dress.
John Watson blinked. Coughed on his surprise. He blinked some more, until his vision cleared and he finally saw a woman, not a wall.

After recovering that priceless emerald vase Holmes was on every other front page. A day later, after finding the two tiny kidnapped heirs to whom that vase belonged,
You'd think five years of working with Sherlock Holmes would have given him all these tics and more, but mostly Lestrade just shrugs, tucks his chin a bit, and tells everyone that Sherlock's the reason he's gone completely grey.
"There's a sweetheart, thank you."
"—which I'm sure has to mean—oh god John, oh god—"
"DI Lestrade. What? No, it's fine, I already told them they could have whatever they need."
"That's not dif—look, no. I'm not going to argue."
Yes, that, the hand-holding, it's one of their things. One of the seeds that grew into the beauty of ritual.
Besides, Mike still had some papers to mark.
And right now, walking away from the body of a wing-wearing man sprawled face-first on the cobblestones, an unfortunately-dead individual in swaddling-cloth, strappy sandals, clutching golden arrows in one hand, and a half-empty quiver in the other, Greg was pretty sure of one thing.
A fun fact: At UCL is a cabinet inside which resides the
Greg Lestrade made a noise.
"Oh that thing's just for show," the owner had said when he'd started checking each white cubby for clues.
He leaned toward John and Sherlock said, "I was a queen bee on her mating flight. I flew over the top of the tallest trees with just one drone. He stayed close, he fed me honey, and we danced. Then we mated for hours, rising ever higher on summer-warm air until…until we, until I…until…the dream…"
This is happening because during
For example, the Eye may go green for St. Patrick's Day and all over red for Valentine's. During the Olympics in 2012 it was red-white-and-blue all at once. During London Pride it may have all the colours of the rainbow flag. One time it was yellow and neither of them could figure out what holiday that was for but it did make for a nice change. Usually the London Eye is one colour and that colour represents whatever company currently sponsors it. When EDF Energy sponsored the Eye, the large Ferris wheel was blue most times. Now that Coca-Cola sponsors it, the lights are usually red.
Over the coming years John will teach Sherlock many things, things about what's right and what's wrong, about when and where and why.
Then Lestrade put his head down on his desk and slept comfortably for the next four hours.
Licking his lips, John grins at the stranger queuing behind him. He gestures to his own groceries on the chip-and-pin machine. "Do it," he sighs softly to the man.
"You heard the man, be a good boy and run along."
Or sometimes, well sometimes it's John, on his belly on their bed, back bowed so that his bare arse is presented perfectly for eating out, and he groans as Sherlock laps at him, and he keens as Sherlock's tongue slicks inside, and for the longest time John's close, close, so close, humping his own hand and spreading his legs wider, and it goes on so long his throat gets dry and he's dizzy from panting and then Sherlock will do it. He'll reach up, thread the fingers of their left hands together, and he'll hold so fast and so tight, that finally, good god finally, John comes.
John shrugged. "Well tiny floofy dogs make me cheerful, so there's that."
If it was raining and the lesson took place inside, the tutor found themselves inundated with homemade eccles cakes, spiced rhubarb pie, and silky lattes made with Altamont's own La Cimbali M39 TE Dosatron.
But it wasn't okay, which is why Sherlock couldn't stop crying and why, after awhile he had to run the back of his hand under his nose, so nose stuff wouldn't get on his bear. When his hand came away glistening wet, Sherlock made an actual "Ugh," sound because Sherlock did not like…fluids.
As the owner goes off to write Sherlock's meager cheque, he scrawls a reply.
The second time was forgettable.
In a movie this would be the point where John stomps off, never to be seen again. John's also not the sort to let idiots off lightly, so he doesn't.
The man's grin turns into a slit-eyed gaze, a hunter sighting prey. They go outdoors, stand amidst a litter of fag ends and ash.
Because his neighbor's correct. John lets Johnny buy his beers because John's flat fucking broke, but if he doesn't get out of that bedsit now and again he's going to open his desk drawer one night and he's—
Actually he notices much more than that. The flex of hip and thigh as John guides the horse with subtle pressure. He feels the puffs of breath when the man murmurs words surely the horse can't hear and yet seems to and—like Mike—Sherlock relaxes when John reassures, "It's fine, it's good, such a good,

"Sometimes get close enough to—" a deep breath, let out softly and very near by, "—smell things."
a face—"
Jaw unhinged, the good doctor Watson turned and watched the pretty, maybe-prostitute sidle up to an elegant, bearded man in a perfectly-tailored suit. They talked briefly and then, his hand pressed to the small of Sherlock's back, they walked together out the door.
Suddenly Sherlock was bored of being bored. He was bored of being inexpertly probed by a young man who only thought to become a sex therapist because he could make his girlfriend come just by talking to her and somehow they'd both thought that would be a really popular skill for a sex therapist. But that was neither here nor there.
Which is to say exactly John Watson's type.
"And if you properly prepare yourself first that figure rises to thirty-eight."
"It's going to stop hurting," John lies. "I'm going to make it stop hurting, okay, can I do that, will you let me do that?"
Everyone wanted to play Kiss the Doctor.
"I have appeared at five of Scotland Yard's pub quizzes in the last two months pretending I needed to talk to Lestrade or Dimmock or your girlfriend that you were clearly mentally cheating on—"
"What d'they say?"
"I read something once," John murmured a bit later, shifting again until Sherlock's massaging hands were well north of his knee. "It said to fall in love with a person's eyes. Because eyes never age, so if you fall in love with someone's eyes, you'll be in love forever."
Of course John and Sherlock know this firsthand for they would give their lives one for the other. Whether they think so or not they are, in their own ways, heroic. We all have that potential.
If at that instant anyone had asked John his name, he would not have been able to reply.
Greg turned. "The bloke in the white coat? That's Chris's ex." Momentary rumination. "They stayed friends though, which is really kind of ni—"
So Sherlock comes on Monday and Friday afternoons.
If you've wondered what biscuits, tea, jam, or honey John and Sherlock rub onto one another, eat, or otherwise experiment with, wonder no more!
Yes, for this little moonlighting gig all John had to do was wear a tux and tie, hold a flute of something fizzy and non-alcoholic, and keep a doctorly eye on the famous pretty people as they got rat arsed and gave one another some sort of TV award.
Yet still Sherlock believes his advice is something to which everyone has a right.
Some lessons are never learned. And some are learned very well indeed.
Another long minute, two. Sherlock releases the hand on his chest. The one on his belly withdraws. Sherlock sits up, looks around.
Molly, I noticed—" Sherlock nodded at Mike without breaking stride in his stride
Sherlock grins. Then realises he better check which one they're starting with because—
He was doing it because there was no case on, his mosquito larvae wouldn't hatch for another day, and the sulfur he'd ordered (for a small experiment with a very small cannon), was still in transit, so Sherlock was bored. B.o.r.e.d.
Sherlock blinks down, John Watson looks up. And starts deducing.
As if it was feeling left out, Sherlock's half-empty coffee mug tipped over for no reason whatsoever and joined the mocha latte all over everything.
Little John Watson does not know the word caffeine or milligram either, but that hasn't stopped him from just now ingesting one hundred and twenty-four milligrams of the stuff.
Sees the woman's heavy makeup as the mask it is, hiding boredom, anger, pity. Sees that the man's a whole strange mess of things: Tired, eager, resigned, worried, in pain. Sees his mended coat, flaking polish on decade-old shoes, hair in want of trimming. He can't afford what she's about to do.
John snorts inelegantly. "Oh stop."
When the great big seventy kilo dog opened his giant mouth, John saw so many terrible sharp teeth and such a huge wet tongue, that little Johnny Watson completely lost his shit and screamed—
Then the man held out his hand. John blinked at it a few times as if near-sighted and then the good doctor took it. Didn't even discuss the matter with his own hand, just
"That's different!"
The lorry driver tries teasing the tall man from the road.
Clutching his jeans with sweaty hands, sitting alone at the airport gate and seven hours early for a flight that'll finally take him back to England, John rocks in his plastic chair and whispers
Neither Mrs. Watson nor Mr. Holmes were really the dramatic type.
Sherlock nods again, as if now everything makes sense. With the heady musk of pheromones in the air, actually it feels like everything does.
"Men don't do that."
Princess Snookum
"Who told you—" John shook his head to clear it of spiked eggnog and annoyance. He would not be diverted. "I don't know who you think you are, mister, marching around telling me about me, but I'm positive I can and do you want to know why?"
John wasn't done asphyxiating so he just kept right on with it while turning away and running into one of those twirly little product carousels. Fully stocked, it tinkled merrily with a festive array of cock rings, nipple clamps, and—surprise!—more anal beads.
been right about that—seemed to grow six inches. "Listen, you over-pretty little shit, the DI has no claim on that skull and no right to give it to anyone and I'm betting he never even said that and even if he did you're not getting it. She's mine, she's been mine for a long time now, and you'll have to pry her from my cold, dead hands before you have her."
"—since Friday." Mrs. Hudson handed Sherlock his post, placed one remaining item on the hall table. "Mrs. Turner's daughter served with him and when I told her—"

"—anyway, the last time you—ouch! My ankle doesn't turn that way you luna—right, that's better—"

John looked up. From across the room John said, "The killer. What was his name?"
"About the rugby too."
The Newfie wagged himself nearer.
Sherlock could have hastily removed his hands from their non-professional pausing place. He could've castigated himself for his poor portrayal of a spa employee. Instead Sherlock did something else. When John Watson—who indeed isn't an idiot—said…
Cesare, for his part, was not at all sure this interview was helping him with his essay. This wasn't Mr. Holmes' fault. It was because talking about sex to strangers made Cesare extremely uncomfortable, yet he didn't know how to say, "I think maybe we should stop now. I think maybe I shouldn't be a sex therapist. Also this blush I have feels like it's going to kill me."
The words come with a sneer, then the man remembers himself, smiles with his eyes but not his mouth. "Uh, sorry. You surprised me. How do you do Mr. Holmes?" The man stands, offers his hand.

And suddenly he was ninja-invisible.

John Watson did not say anything, not one thing. His jaw, however, was quite eloquent.

At almost eight-years-old John was a much better crier than Sherlock. It took two seconds tops before he went from uncertain sniffles to great walrus-sized sobs.
John Watson grew five inches taller and three stone heavier and also maybe started breathing fire. "How

Mycroft checked his watch. That reminded him, it was time for Sherlock's literature tutorial. With any luck his little brother wasn't still angry about this afternoon's small contretemps vis-à-vis the cinema. He could be such a petulant creature sometimes.
And Sherlock Holmes does not move.
John Watson could not look the coffee-drenched man in the eye for the next little bit of forever.
Once they recover, breathless and pink-cheeked, John says, "Well we can start with the one and see about the other?"
Sherlock ground his teeth. "—then him. I pick him."
"So how do you suggest I…fish?"
"Okay, yes, thank you for that, Poirot."
The man in the expensive suit with the pink socks and slick-backed hair was standing beside the good doctor's table.
"Sir, may I?"
Mr. Coat and Curls stopped, turned, looked the sex toy over and shrugged, "My source did report satisfaction."
"Gay."

The machine beeps. John jumps. Then he coughs violently on his own spit.

Giving flu jabs was not fulfilling. Explaining the difference between a virus and bacteria vis-à-vis antibiotics left him restless. And so when Mike told him about a part-time position with the Metropolitan Police Service, John quit his small job at a small clinic and took it.
The good doctor can not just let that go, so he asks Sherlock how he knew he was in the army. Sherlock explains and in the explaining deduces eight other things and ends up explaining these over a pint, then another.
A breeze that does a little samba over those blooms sure, setting them to dancing, but a breeze that also gusts over the five empty tables around little Mr Watson, bringing him not the scent of blossoms but of
Then, bowing once more over his careful work, Sherlock Holmes said, "I'm sure you know she was also seeing another doctor in the practice, that they just got back from a holiday to New Zealand and are contemplating being exclusive, and that she was less than keen on your taste in clothes, cologne, and hair style. This was likely the first in a progressive series of personal…upgrades."
"—kneeling—"
Right, after checking his watch Greg may go to the post office. If your Greg has kids or siblings or
To completely compound his error, the good doctor made an earnest face at his girlfriend. She made some sort of face back but he couldn't tell what it was through her mud mask. Not content with making a bad thing worse, John opened his mouth to make a worse thing awful when the dark-haired depilatory technician murmured, "I believe it's time for madam's massage."
Sherlock rolls his eyes. "Never mind."
"No, no, no daddy!" "Yeth mummy, yeth!"
Sherlock sits down with his cold coffee and, in a lonely cafe in the middle of Regent's park, he pretends he's alone. He's very good at doing this.

Sherlock starts to count. The inevitable 'piss off' will come in
The small man stood down, literally, but he did not move away. Instead he stood rock-steady still and he kept his gaze locked on Sherlock's sternum and he simply started talking and he didn't stop, didn't stop, didn't stop for

Mike nodded, reflected that it was odd to say 'great' when talking about a killer, but that was Sherlock Holmes for you. He hadn't known the man long, but the poisoning case had gone on for weeks and they'd ended up sitting around a lab, talking into a few long nights, waiting for test results. He was a rare bird, this Holmes, a good heart in there, underneath the scowling armour.
Three hours later a nosy consulting detective returned with the new tenant's single piece of post—
In fact Holmes is literally under him at this moment as John leans over, waiting for another word, grunt, or vague gesture.
No, that's not right. John had trouble finding work he
"I was hoping to ask for a dance. You move so gracefully."
John Watson went on and on and endlessly on about absolutely nothing—the expense of public transit; the cold; army pensions—because it felt like he hadn't talked to anyone in days, maybe weeks, and now suddenly someone heard him and it didn't matter that the man's interest was physical, it didn't matter John believed himself straight, and it didn't matter that they didn't know each other. What mattered now was that John could see the chest in front of him and John's observant, he is, and so he could see the quick rise and fall of the man's breathing, proof that
Lestrade stopped so he could remember the point. He stared at his hand. With the pen in it. On the pad where he was two days into tracking his daily life so he could look back on—ah! Okay.

"What?"
Sherlock showed up at the cafe forty-five minutes early. He fidgeted with his hair until it was a finger-twirled nest of curls. And he wondered if strange men kiss other strange men on first dates and was coffee in a park cafe even a date and…
This is a strange, bitter-sweet, easy-to-miss park in London but it is wonderfully well worth visiting. I think John and Sherlock know this place. I think the first time John went there he felt like he'd found something precious, because indeed he had.

Which is to say Sherlock paused before replying. Which was all the reply the belligerent little man before him required.
