“Dean, he's... unique.”
“Thanks, I appreciate that.”
“You sound more and more like Sam these days. Let's have a sniff around, and we'll see. We should have plenty of daylight left still,” Dean stood up and rummaged around for his wallet, but Castiel stopped him by laying a hand on his arm.
“Neither. I told him to make sure his noise-cancelling headphones are fully charged, and he took it from there. So, is that it?
“I know for a fact that’s not true.”
“That was reassuring,” Dean jokes as he heaves himself into a half-seated position, leaning against his headboard.
“It’s the beast I don’t trust.”
Cas lets out a chuckle, watching Dean zero in on the package in his hands. “Yes.”
“So, let me get this straight. You made a deal with an insane cosmic entity, who's ruling a domain we had no freaking idea even existed, and you agreed to be dragged to said domain the moment you're happy.” Dean's voice was cold and still way too calm. Castiel knew he was going to explode, and the later it came, the bigger the fallout would be. But he was well-versed in dealing with an angry Dean. It was nothing new, it was going to be okay, and if his thoughts were panicked, it didn't mean a thing... So when all that followed was dead stillness, heavy and oppressive, he realized he’d just entered yet another domain whose existence he’d been unaware of.
“Still not fair,” Dean starts to argue but Cas stops his train of thoughts by soaking his panties in massage oil. The now-wet satin clings to Dean’s cock even more obscenely than before and his hips snap up of their own accord, chasing friction. Cas drags it out a little, taking a pause before rubbing Dean’s erection with the heel of his palm, other hand sneaking up to spread the surplus oil over Dean’s stomach and chest.
According to a letter from his kidnappers, which we – as well as other major networks – just received today, they were going to kill him, as a warning to everyone trying to uncover their business. They also attached a photo, showing him in his captivity. Luckily, in the end this photo helped the police to find him…”
“Scratch Gigette’s ears?” He echoed, staring at the mentioned body parts dangling quite far away from him. He swallowed, and leaned forward. To his biggest surprise so far he felt comfortable enough to lift his rear from the saddle while the horse kept walking under him. His chest touched the curve of Gigette’s neck, and finally, he managed to scratch her ears, for which she thanked him by softly whickering.
In all honestly, Jack’s seclusion wasn’t wholly self-imposed. The person closest to his age that he talked to regularly was Claire, and while she was amazing and Jack was in complete awe of her, she wasn’t an entirely accurate representation of people his age. Discussions with Claire often consisted of gossiping about members of their family, debates about the most efficient way to kill a vampire, and sharing stories about their past traumas. Something told him their relationship and topics of discussion were the exception and not the rule.
The new guy, Jack, had sat next to Tabitha in his first math lesson and from the get-go she could tell he was crazy smart. They’d been doing some shit with cos, sin, and tan for about a week now and while it still wasn’t quite clicking for her, he seemed to grasp it straight away. Originally she thought he’d be like some of the other douchebag smartasses in their class, always shooting their hands up in class because they knew the answer, generally being a condescending twat when asked to explain something to the rest of the class, but Jack seemed content to stay quiet.
mean anyway? He’d tried asking for advice from his parents but Castiel had never attended a school before and Dean had never really bothered with friends when he was younger because John would be spiriting him and Sam away sooner or later, so why bother trying to place roots that were inevitably going to be torn out? Jack had then turned to Sam whose only advice was
. It was only when Jack said, “I’ve never been happier that my dads don’t talk like that around me.”, that she realised she had no reason to be worried in the first place.
(See the end of the chapter for
Also, I feel like Jack would hate leaving things up to interpretation after such an uncertain start in life. I think he'd like to solidity and surety of maths and science.
. Not simple or anything, but
Jack felt his shoulders leave his ears and followed Tabitha out of the classroom and towards her friends.
Truthfully, Jack didn’t find the work to be too hard but being a celestial being had some benefits. He just
Jack didn’t know many people in his RS class, didn’t really know anyone else in the wider year group aside from his new group of friends and the various other students he sat next to during lessons, but it would seem that he’d gotten lucky. Jack’s group consisted of Tabitha, Jordan, a girl called Zarah, and a guy who everyone called Bow (Jack thought he participated in archery competitions, although he had no idea as to the guy’s actual name. To be fair, it wasn’t like it mattered anyway.).
There was a general murmur of agreement, and it was only then that Jack realised Jordan hadn’t told them the name of the book series. The first time he spoke in the group was to ask a simple question. “What’s it called?”
He also seemed to keep to himself, which was a bonus. No asking about her, or expecting her to return the courtesy due to fucking societal expectations, just a companionable silence as they both soldiered through their work. Tabitha had definitely sat next to worse people.
. They had definite answers, ones you could find, solve. That was what made them
When Jack had started attending St Óscar Romero’s Catholic High School, Dean had found it hilarious. Castiel, well… not so much.
Tabitha nudged Jack again to say she’d finished copying down his work and so he turned back to the absolutely
She stopped at the door and turned around, seeming to notice he wasn’t following her. “You coming, or what?”
Jack makes some friends!!
The end of the lesson ended up sneaking up on them before they even realised, and they still hadn’t come to a decision. All of the options on their shortlist were viable candidates and would make for something good to analyse as well as something that could be enjoyed as well as analysed. The majority of their possible choices were the result of extensive googling but there were a few that had been brought up due to pre-existing knowledge of the source material, and the piece of media they ended up using was a part of the latter.
After that, Jack hanging out with them became a regular occurrence. He still didn’t talk much but Jack listened well and when he did get involved he was a fucking riot. Jack had an amazing ability to say something completely ridiculous in the most deadpan way ever which sent all of them into hysterics without fail. (After about a week of nagging him about it, Tabitha had finally managed to pull it out of him that he’d learnt the ability from his father. Apparently his whole family were that sarcastic; she could only imagine what family dinners must be like.)
When they got over to her friends, Tabitha felt like she was looking over to check in on Jack every other minute. She knew her friends were quite…
Miss Hawthorne gave them the rest of the period to brainstorm what piece of media they’d like to use, and she even let them use their phones to create a shortlist.
Jack didn’t have much to contribute to the following conversation about different pieces of potential media, but suggestions ranged from films, such as The Blues Brothers and The Matrix Trilogy, to using books containing religious allegories, like The Chronicles of Narnia, or even excerpts of Milton’s Paradise Lost.
. What kind of shit advice was that, anyway? Be himself? Who, the incredibly powerful Nephilim, biological son of Satan, or the socially awkward dork whose social interactions were limited to groups of jaded, cynical hunters? He could hardly introduce himself by saying, “Hi, my name is Jack, and my favourite weapon is this really detailed knife!” Well, technically he
In the second week of their sitting next to each other, she realised she’d only ever heard Jack speak when responding to the register, and sometimes he didn’t respond at all. It wasn’t unusual for students to be quiet, but Jack seemed to be taking it to extremes. After she noticed his complete lack of talking Tabitha began to observe Jack during registration. It seemed he needed to remind himself he had to respond before doing so, and in the lead up to his name being called up was like watching a man prepare to wrestle a fucking hippo.
math and the sciences; things where definite answers existed. Admittedly, having a father who had been around at the start of creation didn’t hurt either. You couldn’t really expect someone who had assisted in the creation of hundreds of creatures to have no grasp of the laws of that world, could you? Compared to the complexities of creation, trigonometric identities weren’t terribly hard.
It sounded bad to say that Tabitha had made Jack her project after that, but the thing is that that description wouldn’t be entirely inaccurate either. Saying that Jack was now ‘her project’ made it sound like she wanted to change him, or study him; keep him at a distance and observe how he managed himself, be an impartial observer. No, what Tabitha meant by making Jack ‘her project’ was that she’d help him overcome his anxiety, and help him make friends – specifically,
Dean had warned him of ‘The New Kid’ effect – basically, it was a phenomenon where the mysterious new kid became the centre of attention because no one knew anything about them. Dean had said it wouldn’t last long, only for a couple of days, a week at the most, but Jack managed to circumvent the whole issue by letting his anxiety rule and not talking to anyone. Not the perfect solution, but he found it to be fairly effective. ‘The New Kid’ effect only lasted for two days before everyone went back to doing their own shit. Dean was slightly appalled his child had already established himself as a social recluse for the rest of his high school career, but Castiel found himself to be a little proud of Jack’s choice. He was being himself and doing so with no care for what others were thinking; what better quality could a father ask of for his son?
(See the end of the chapter for
Despite Castiel’s impotent rage, he agreed that Jack should be enrolled there as soon as possible, and so he and Dean went to meet with the principle, leading to Jack being thrown into his first school in the middle of the academic year with no idea what to expect. He scarcely remembered what grade he was in, and what did being a
RS should have been an elective but apparently going to a faith-based school meant that the course was mandatory, and had been specifically picked by the Church. In Jack’s case, he felt the course had been chosen specifically to torture him. He’d had some catch-up work to do, but the work he’d missed on the course was mostly surrounding the Bible; it probably would’ve been hard, but he had an expert on the subject sat across from him at the dinner table.
The module they were doing at the minute was about representations of Christianity (but mainly Catholicism, because, obviously, a Catholic school) through various forms of media. His class had managed to waste a few lessons watching the musical version of Les Misérables, because that shit was steeped in Catholic imagery and symbolism, specifically Jean Valjean’s journey to redemption, but now their teacher was telling them that about a project they were expected to work on for the rest of the semester in the run-up to Easter.
Finally, after almost three weeks of social isolation, Jack made a friend. He was sat in Math, and they were covering trigonometric identities when the girl on Jack’s right-hand side elbowed him and whispered, “Dude, do you have any idea what’s going on?”
. It was why he found math and the sciences so…
The next two chapters are essentially just filler chapters before we get into the main plot. So please, enjoy some fluff!
The only time Tabitha was ever really worried about her decision to introduce Jack to her friends was the first time they were talking about something explicitly not straight. Yeah, in general Romero’s was pretty accepting, but it wasn’t like assholes were suddenly non-existent just because one Catholic community decided that they personally didn’t care who you were or who you wanted to fuck.
At the end of the lesson, Tabitha turned to Jack and said, “Hey, do you want to come and hang out with me and my friends during lunch?” She finished with a smile, while shrugging her bag onto her shoulder. Jack got the impression her nonchalance was genuine, as if she didn’t really care what he did or how he answered.
Just as they were getting ready to pack up and move onto their next lesson, Jordan’s head snapped up and they said, “Hey, wait, I think I’ve got it! My aunt used to talk to me about a book series she read when she was younger. I think there are five volumes, each making up a year in the story’s universe, and each volume has 22 books, except for the third volume that only has 16. I remember her complaining when Volume IV started coming out because she said that the author wasn’t even being subtle about the religious elements anymore. Gran and Grampa almost stopped her from reading them because apparently they verged on being blasphemous.”
He was sorely tempted to decline, head for the library, and start on the new novel he had in his bag, but his desire for companionship won out in the end. He didn’t talk to her, but he did nod, and Tabitha’s smile grew, lighting up her face and making her eyes seem to sparkle.
After PE Jordan just started fucking gushing about Mitch, their partner in French. Apparently the guy could run like a motherfucker and looked good doing it.
Jordan replied easily, “It’s called Supernatural.”
Lunch was generally quite a loud affair, with bitching and moaning being the main events. The topics of complaint varied wildly, ranging from teachers, to classmates, to assignments, family, and more. There were, of course, other conversations, but these were definitely the most common.
After that, the puzzle pieces seemed to all fall into place; Jack probably had severe social anxiety, so severe that responding to the register required serious mental preparation. No wonder the guy hadn’t found any friends yet, having to go and talk to new people must require a herculean amount of bravery.
, and she wanted to make sure they weren’t overwhelming the new kid she’d brought into the fold, but Jack seemed to be content to sit and listen to whatever random bullshit Casey and Miles were spouting. If anything, he looked the most relaxed she had ever seen him, like he was at home with the chaos.
Tabitha couldn’t help it; she flicked her eyes over to Jack to see his reaction but all she saw was a guy hanging out with his friends, enjoying his day. All she could think was,
With her smile still on her face she started heading for the door, leaving Jack to stare confusedly at her back. Had he somehow screwed up? Did she no longer want him around? Was she simply toying with him, giving him hope only to-
When they were looking for schools for Jack to attend after they moved into a house on the outskirts of Lawrence, Castiel was adamantly against Jack attending the local Catholic school. He had nothing against the religion itself, he just didn’t want to risk Jack taking every religious thing the faculty said as gospel (heh) or have him blurting out obscure facts or details about his extended family. Unfortunately for him, Romero’s was, quite frankly, an incredible school. Despite only being established in 2019, the school had garnered excellent results after every inspection, had up to date technology, and seemed to be an open and welcoming community for everyone, despite their religious affiliations. They’d ticked every single one of Castiel’s boxes, as well as a few he hadn’t even considered, like the quality of the Arts departments, and he was fuming. They would have to ‘donate’ $60 per semester towards Jack’s education due to the reduced funding the school received as a result of being a religious school, but that was the only downside Castiel could find, and he definitely looked.
“Yeah, she is.”
“She is, but she was raised by a hunter who moved around the country a lot, so she never really picked up one local dialect.”
Because it’s true. Sam is still haunted by the ghost of his guilt.
He swallows thickly, looking back into Cas’ eyes. They were exactly as he remembered them…open pools of calming blue. But right now, they were different - full of selfless affection rather than the piercing and serious gaze they always held.
This led to arguments. Arguments became fights that dragged on until the wee hours of the morning. This usually ended with Sam taking refuge on their cramped and lumpy couch that was definitely not designed with 6’4” husbands in mind.
It starts as nothing more than an awkward pressing of lips together, cautious and asking a question Dean can’t find the words for. He’s not sure whether he’s more thrilled or surprised that Cas chases his touch, and not a half second later that he’s replying in kind, gently but firmly kissing back.
Cas disappears in the blink of an eye, the sound of newly restored wings whooshing through the air with his departure, leaving Dean right where he found him. Dean tries not to focus on being left behind again, because honestly, their lives have always circled and spiraled around each other into one magnetic maelstrom of a mess. Their separation always ended up being temporary in spite of whatever disaster life threw their way.
And Sam...well, Sammy no longer needed him. He hadn’t for a long time. His kid brother had his own family outside of Dean, one he shared more than half of his lifespan with. And he was happy for them, of course he was. He was freakin’ thrilled that they could all share this place, this Heaven, together. Not as memories, but as people.
“You may as well come out with it boy. What’s eating at you from the inside?”
Sometimes younger, arrogant, and hopeful hunters would come to gawk at the Great Sam Winchester, often asking for advice on a rather nasty monster in hopes of building their reputation. He wouldn’t exactly turn them away, but he wouldn’t offer them anything more than research, a beer, and a well earned piece of advice to not jump into any battle they weren’t equipped for. If ever a hunter needed an extra hand, Eileen would be the one to offer it.
His breath caught in his throat. From the back, his brother looked exactly like he had 40 years ago. Worn jeans, a tattered trucker jacket, and dirty combat boots. But here, casually leaning against the railing, Dean seemed more relaxed than Sam had ever seen him alive.
“What?”
Dean feels Cas’ grip on his bicep through the thick material of the jacket. His skin tingles under the angel’s touch, though whether from Cas’ newly restored angelic mojo or because of the familiarity of the gesture, Dean doesn’t know. He glances down and is surprised to find Cas’ broad hand no longer appears to be calloused. Taking him in for the first time, Dean notices that everything about Cas looks the same, but…cleaner. Fresher. His face appears less worn down, the bags under his eyes that he acquired throughout his years accompanying the Winchesters have lessened, and even the bit of scruff in his appearance looks deliberate.
“God, I hope not.”
“This is quite the party, Samuel. And here I thought you Winchesters didn’t know how to have a good time!”
Four hours.
Dean felt a pull at his heart watching them from afar.
“…really, Cas? Seriously?” he groans, “Did you honestly believe that I cared so little for you that I was gonna throw away over a decade of history, of us, just ‘cause you were honest with me?”
“How could I ask, Dean, when you always seemed to brush off any attempt I made to show you how much I cared?”
Cas rolls his eyes and removes his hand from around Dean’s neck, much to the hunter’s displeasure.
Between catching up with the Harvelle women and meeting Bill Harvelle for the first time, sharing a few beers with Ash (who loudly lamented that his daring acts of hacking Heaven’s system had all been for naught now that the place was open to everyone), the brothers didn’t get a moment to themselves. Old hunters as well as people they knew came up to say hi, slapping Dean on the back and asking if the boys were finally settling in or if they were just dropping by for a visit.
“I need to get back. Jack is looking for me…I should go and make sure that Naomi hasn’t been trying to talk him into any of her old ideas to reform Heaven.”
Dean wanted nothing more than the ability to say those three important words like it was nothing. But even now, standing in front of Cas, he found his big mouth failing him.
“Seriously, I’m going to be pissed if you show up here in a week and decide you’ve had a change of heart, old man.”
“Oh? You sure you want to keep that up?” He asks with a playful smirk, “‘Cause I gotta say, having an angel who’s in love with me at my beck and call? Kinda a turn on, Cas.”
“I know, but I’m still worried. Good night, guys, see you tomorrow.” She waved at them, and disappeared into the house. Chuck’s gaze followed her.
“We haven't heard a peep from him in weeks, the radio silence could go on for only Chuck knows how long!” Dean jumped to his feet and started pacing up and down the length of the library.
“I thought you wanted to sleep.”
“What’s your name?” Dean crouched down to the level of the small girl.
“Maybe the partner… overreacted slightly.”
, alright. A fluffy-socked, robe-clad, flour-covered Cas is standing next to the kitchen counter that has all the mixing bowls they own spread out on it and he’s glaring at the biggest one like it’s personally done something to piss him off. Judging by the white powder coating every inch of the room, it probably had more to do with the hand mixer that’s sticking halfway out of the bowl, and Dean can almost see the scene of Cas turning it to max speed and dipping it into the flour.
“If I didn't know any better, I'd think you're trying to butter me up,” Dean joked, but the fondness in his eyes made it clear he appreciated the gesture.
“Welcome to HallowInn, my name is Jamie, and it looks like I’ll be your waitress,” she greeted them with a bright, honest smile, “What can I get you?”
“That must be it, yes.”
In the end, the dinner wasn’t half bad. The back terrace was lit by the light of candles, a few torches, and the open fire in the fire pit. The steaks were delicious, and Becky made three kinds of salad to go with them. Soft music was playing in the background from hidden speakers, which even Dean had to admit was nice. It was only the four of them, and they had an immense amount of fun.
“Let’s go then, I will finish this later. You should change shoes though; flip-flops are not the best choice for a walk like that.”
“For fuck's sake, Cas, will you just spit it out?”
Suddenly, they heard a gunshot, and shortly after that Ruby appeared from somewhere behind the building, wiping the blood off of her split lip with the sleeve of her black hoodie. There was a bruise blossoming on her left cheek, and her hair seemed to be a little burnt, but other than that she seemed to be fine.
“Fuck off.”
Cas’ breath stutters when Dean lets go of the last button and then, as the halves of his shirt part, rakes blunt fingernails down the middle of his chest with barely-there pressure, stopping just above his waistband. It’s such a simple touch, hardly sexual, but it’s electrifying. “You’re good at this.”
“Hey,” Dean murmured, hiding his fond smile in Castiel's dark mop of hair, then turned on his bedside lamp. The angel grunted and shifted to press his face further into Dean's shoulder. “Not a morning person, are we?” He let out an amused huff and began caressing Castiel's back, allowing him to restart himself.
Chuck and Becky watched their interactions from afar.
“For an angel, a decade feels a lot less in the grand scheme of things, plus the majority of the time, I had bigger fish to fry than to dwell on this, no matter how badly I wanted to be by your side, any way I could.” Castiel bit his bottom lip and seemed to make a decision to unload some weight. “I've known this was something else for longer than that. Ever since that alley, after you nearly said yes to Michael.”
“Screw up what?” Castiel didn’t understand what Dean was talking about.
“No, Jack, I made the deal knowing the terms.”
“Is she... is she happy?” Sam asks, his voice pained.
“Look at that. What do you think you are, the white knight in shining armor?” He asked with a weird cadence, completely focused on Dean, not paying a second of attention to the horse silently inching its way closer to him.
“Smooth as always, Dean. I didn’t even know Becky knew him.”
“Thank you, Jack,” Sam says, just then getting to his feet from where he landed when Cas pushed him aside. Cas looks at him and opens his mouth to apologise for that, but Sam seems to sense it. “No need, Cas, I know.”
“How did you think I would react?”
“Huh?”
“You don't know, Sam, you don't!” Dean's voice wobbles as his volume rises, unbidden and unwanted tears gathering in his eyes. “Don't tell me you don't want Eileen back!”
“Only if you want to, I’m not sure I want to hear you hyperventilate and give out certain high-pitched noises, or see you faint, but hey, I don’t want to poop on your party.”
“Yeah?”
Neither task took very long, as close to a textbook routine as possible, and they reconvened less than an hour later in a diner near the coroner's office.
“You totally were. At first I thought you were just socially awkward or some shit like that, but then I noticed how you only did that to me…”
“Well, hello there,” a soft-spoken female voice comes from somewhere. Both Jack and Cas stand up to look around for the source, just in time to watch the Shadow assume Kelly Kline’s lithe form. “You shouldn’t be here,” it turns its empty, cold gaze to Jack. “And you should be asleep, I finally put you down!” it snarls at Cas.
He leaned his head back, looking at Dean and offering him a quick grin before leaning forward and swinging his hips around, startling a long whimper from Dean’s throat as he twisted around, never once getting off of Dean’s cock.
Then, without much ceremony, he reached down, lined Dean up, and slid down slowly.
“Good boy,” she said approvingly, giving one last squeeze before letting it go.
Aware that Dean was quickly reaching his threshold of stimulation, he stood up and walked over, flipping off the vibrator. With the low hum gone, all that was left was Dean’s heavy breathing.
“Tell me about yourself, Dean.” He prompts, a pad and a pencil in his hands.
Obvious though it may be, for some reason or another it doesn’t strike Castiel that this is the way it is to be until the man shows up at the doorstep of his shop.
“Your inguinal canals,” Cas said calmly. His fingers moved in and out gently. “It’s the canals where your testicles are pulled into when exposed to cold. I’d heard that it was quite sensitive back there and wanted to see how you reacted.”
It’s warm, it’s wet, and it’s unfamiliar, but Castiel decides quickly there’s nowhere he’d rather be than right here in Dean’s arms, his lips against the model’s, just as soft as he always thought they were. Breaths shared, warmth blending together, just feeling each other click together like two magnets finding each other and drawn irresistibly into the other.
“I just want to make sure you’re okay. We can set up a secure spot for you to hide out in if you’d like – set you up with wards so she can’t find you.”
a good toy,” she hummed, her legs shifting around as she stretched like a cat. Dean felt like his chest puffed up like a proud peacock at the compliment.
Dean’s face was getting more and more red by the second, lip-licking increasing in frequency. Cas pretended to not notice – thankfully, his legs were crossed, so his own reaction couldn’t be seen, and he could maintain his air of indifference.
Really, as the seasoned hunter that he was after a few decades of hunting, Dean should, by all accounts, know better than this. He’s too experienced at this point to have such rookie mistakes.
) behind him so he could fully face the intruder in his den.
Eyes like emeralds flick up and down Castiel’s seated form for a moment, and Dean licks his lips.
“I thought you might like that,” Cas smiled, easing the plug into place.
And relaxed.
Castiel nods, never once looking away. “I’m fine. I love you.”
But, looking at hir grumpy and adorable partner as they forced themselves to sit upwards, xie could honestly say that every moment since had been just as good.
Facing Dean again, he grinned a feral grin, and tilted his hat. “Time to gallop, boy.” His other hand swept out and he grabbed the forgotten riding crop, bringing it around smoothly to crack against Dean’s thigh as he started up his rhythm again.
Dean's eyes widened in realization, and he finally burst.
Castiel is stiff for a moment, but melts into the embrace after a moment, arms coming up to the other man’s back, gripping his clothes. If Dean’s shirt is a little more damp on the shoulder than it was before the hug, neither will ever tell a soul. What Castiel never tells Dean is that that was the first time in his memory that he had ever cried.
When the cake comes out there are still smiles all around, and even Naomi has managed to have the slightest tilt of her lips upwards, her usual cold exterior thawed ever so slightly. It’s delicious, and they dig in, all complimenting Gabriel for his baking magic.
“It’s not,” Cas confirmed. He had to specifically custom order the saddle, actually; finding someone who would do it took far longer than he had anticipated. But it would be worth the exorbitant price; he planned on using it extensively.
Dean whimpered, hips jerking up helplessly before he desperately reigned himself back in. Cas focused back on fingering himself open. As much as he would like to tease Dean more, only one of them had a cock ring on and it wasn’t him, so he didn’t allow himself to linger much before stretching him enough to take Dean’s cock.
It wasn’t always perfect. Children vomited on them sometimes, Dean had gotten hir fur pulled one too many times, and the pay wasn’t amazing.
“You’re fine, you’re fine,” Dean assured him, “It’s just…my knees? Can you not, uh—”
He turns his head to his model. “Beg pardon?”
“Come now, don’t be shy. Kneel right down here and we can get started.”
“Nope, all good here.”
The man kept his hands to himself after that, and seemed eager to let them out of his car at the next town over.
After that, he told Dean dully, he never really had a taste for anything but oatmeal, bread with butter, and dried meat strips.
000000
“Do you promise?” The youth repeated, this time holding out a pinky.
It’s certainly never applied to him. He’s done this many a time, listening to models tell him tales and making notes in his sketchpad. Never once has any asked after him in return, not even Gabriel.
“No!”
The scent shifted somewhat. “Dean, can you hear me? What’s going on right now?”
It was worth it.
“Hm. Nice height, nice build,” He said aloud, pretending to be taking more notes on his clipboard. “Good muscle definition, nice proportions.”
Cas respected the comeback but refused to acknowledge it. “So before we get started, I’m going to need you to get undressed.”
A hand stroked lightly from his navel upwards, fingers passing over his nipples before returning with a hard pinch, rolling the hard nub in between fingers with claw-like fingernails, rolling it back and forth, with gentle pinches.
Dean drops the marble head next to the body of his (
He melted at the visual proof of her approval, and the feeling was almost more satisfying than any orgasm could be.
“He’s right here, angel,” she sang, “all ready for
“What,” Dean said, very slowly enunciated and deliberate, “the fuck. Is that.”
But in this metaphor, the child watching his fragile insectoid form was Michael, and he struck Castiel as the type to smash anthills under his shoes just to spite the ants for existing.
“Kiss my lips.”
“But in the meantime, let’s have some fun and wear these wigs long enough to make buying them worth it,” she joked. “As much as I’d love to have some private fun, we put in all this effort – it’d be a shame to waste it.”
“Why don’t you try swallowing and moving your tongue? That may help.”
0000000000000
“If you feel the need to cough up a hairball, please do so into the trash can in the bathroom please,” they said mildly, feeling laughter bubbling up when the cat’s head swung around with a distinctly offended expression.
A full body shiver went through the body below him. Keeping his eyes locked with Cas’s, Dean opened his mouth with a soft ‘ah’, a gentle sigh, eyelids flickering as Cas maneuvered his cock deeper into Dean’s mouth, and the sigh turned into a low moan.
Then she lowered, and she enveloped him in her scent, grinding against his very face.
They thought about it, then amended their statement. “Well, she could try, but I won’t let her. You have my word.”
A little stunned, they held them back without really thinking about it.
And like the normal human being he pretended to be, he needed to make a living, so after several long weeks of job hunting interspersed with scamming rich trust fund college boys out of their daddy’s money to make rent, he finally found a job at the local grocery store. Nothing glamorous, but enough to get by with some well-played credit card scams.
The next morning, he went to her room and found her body in the tub, water stained a rusty red.
They nudge the bathroom door open with their foot, and elbow the light on. Moving to the tub, they very, very gently place the rabbit into the tub.
It was almost hard to see through the dozens of plants covering every available window, but Dean woke next to hir partner with a ray of light on hir eyes.
“You open to suggestion?”
, you could say.” “I hate you.” “Love you too, babe.”) and Dean had worn a ruffled pink one-piece. The picture was a simple selfie of Dean giving Cas a kiss on the cheek on the beach.

“What do you want to do, now that you’re free?”
She laughed lightly, and pulled away, walking over to the other person who was approaching with big, clumsy steps.
Gabriel’s learned to talk loudly if he wants to carry on the illusion that he’s being listened to. The sound of the hammer hitting the chisel echoes, and the crack of the marble splits the air like lightning, the rubble hitting the ground like thunder. Sometimes Castiel doesn’t listen to Gabriel because he has filled his ears with candlewax to save them from harm, but he was too late to the practice to stop the incessant ringing that fills his ears in the silence.
But he also needs to be able to pay his dues, so he agrees; one life sized marble statue of Dean for Michael.
They wouldn’t realize it at first, but that was the beginning of the end of a chapter of their life.
“Have fun?” Cas questioned, combing his fingers through Dean’s hair. Dean leaned into his touch and hummed lazily, giggling slightly in giddiness.
“Any chance you could explain why I saw you go from naked and human to a four foot tall wolf?” His voice was not accusative, more amused than anything.
But, here he is, naked, blindfolded, and tied to a tree somewhere, and he can only blame himself.
His eyes snapped open.
“My lovely little stud,” Cas murmured, planting kisses all over Dean’s face. “C’mon, sweetheart, come for me.”
But was he really that foolish for thinking that the woman was for real after she was pressed up against his side all evening since he walked into the bar, eyes heated and smile seductive as she offered him more and more flirty touches and rounds of sake?
Unfortunately, that wasn’t a fucking option, because like an absolute
The silence continued for quite some time. It wasn’t oppressively silent, but was the kind of silence that held a thousand words.
“Are you sure?” Cas asked, worried. “I don’t want to only focus on me, you deserve—”
When Castiel managed to sneak out of the compound and go to the library, all of the fantasy books described magic as fantastical, beautiful, powerful, and makes the world better for the protagonist.
The silence was comfortable and held all the way to the sun rising again.
Dean is skilled with his hands, having been responsible for cutting firewood, grinding plants to paste for medicine, stirring pots of food, and tending to his infant brother. He doesn’t have to use his hands very much anymore, living with Michael. Michael thinks it is beneath them. Dean’s dimples deepen at that, and it is disagreement. Swirls on the paper.
He obeyed, his cock sliding smoothly in Dean, and then out again. In, and then out. Strong, muscley thighs pressed up against the roundness of Dean’s ass, returning for a slow grind, as if to just feel his ass pressed against his hard, strong hipbones.
So he fed her again, and ducked in to kiss and lick at her chest, sucking on her nipples and rubbing up against her like a cat, and he gazed at the Empress tarot card tattoo on her stomach with what had to be worship.
to me but what do I know,” Cas shrugged.
But eventually, the need to take care of his lover won out, and Cas slowly untied Dean from his bonds and gently eased the bit out of his mouth, letting him work his jaw for a moment before cupping his face and giving him a chaste but lingering kiss.
With Dean’s arms released, he groaned, rolling his shoulders and flexing his arms in front of himself. “All good, wasn’t in position too long,” he assured Cas.
Dean is twenty six, with a brother four years younger. Samuel, Sammy, Sam. He’s a scribe at the local parish, training to be a priest. He visits his brother “as often as he can,” Dean says, but by the twitch of his cheek it is not as often as Dean would like. Castiel’s pencil flicks almost absently.
It surrounded him, enveloped him, and he felt soft tingles going up and down his body.
He sat up with a jolt. His muscles protested, but he didn’t give a fuck; he really hoped the memories flooding his brain were just a product of an over-imaginative wolfy-mind because otherwise, that meant—
) fiancé, moving to cradle the head of the artist gently.
Dean was a lovely dance partner; he knew exactly when to let Cas have his solo. And more importantly, he knew that when Cas started to bounce, that was his cue to join in.
Once Michael would leave Dean would only have to look at him with fear and the fire in his chest would be doused.
He returned, and laid down next to her body, grapes held up in his hand.
The familiar linked their pinkies, and a visible spark ran up their fingers.
Dean felt Cas move in just a hairsbreadth behind him, not quite touching. He felt Cas’s breath puff softly across the back of his neck.
fight him off, if he had stolen Pup. His claws were coming out, and he was pleased; soon he could rip the intruder’s throat out and find Pup. The ozone smell became stronger before mellowing out to a gentle rain.
“I never thought my sexual proclivities would ever help me in a pinch, but here we are.” Not-Intruder muttered under his breath. “If anything, I thought it’d be the rope or the handcuffs.”
He wants a statue.
The rabbit doesn’t move. For a while, Castiel doesn’t either, just caught in the rabbit’s frozen gaze.
They stared at each other. Castiel’s mind raced as they nodded, and walked back to their room.
A large box sits in the center, with Bartholomew standing over it as if to keep watch. Not that the box moves. Its silent and still, and part of Castiel fears that there is a corpse in there.
(that one stung, but Dean ignored it ‘cause Sam was just being a brat), Dean serenely found himself a nearby apartment to the school, or at least as nearby as he could swing it. Living in Cali cost a fucking arm and a leg (
Cas was slow to release them, rolling them around in his hand and squeezing them lightly. Dean’s cock was responding to the ministrations.
But magic filled in the gaps as needed, and the rest they played by ear.
But Dean was not, in fact, an animal, and was capable of acting like a normal human being. But only from a distance, which was why they didn’t chat that much. Cas was perfectly friendly, sometimes, taking slightly longer glances than necessary, but Dean hardly minded. Didn’t dare to hope, though.
The ropes came loose, and Dean would have fallen over if the man’s grip on his hips weren’t so strong and immovable.
He shook himself out of his reverie, brushing a hand against Dean’s jaw before turning and swinging a leg over Dean’s body, back to him. He squirted some lube onto his fingers, enough to make sure his fingers were fully coated. Then he folded himself forward, reached behind, and gently fluttered his finger around his hole before dipping his fingers in.
The voice was quiet and raspy with disuse, but clear.
have a gag reflex. Why don’t we work on that while we’re here, hm?”
Hope is just too devastating for them.
“Good boy.” Cas fit the bit into place, checking the tightness before moving back and admiring his trussed-up hunter. He really does look fantastic like this.
Her hand came up to his chin, long acrylics digging into his skin and leaving what he knew was going to be little red crescents, and he felt himself harden even further at the thought. She yanked his chin so that his eyes met hers, and he felt like he was melting under her gaze.
Dean snapped his fingers twice.
He hummed in agreement. She was right. He was very comfortable and relaxed. He trusted those fingers. He liked having them inside him. He would be happy to open up for their owner.
,” Dean’s hummed response turned into a poorly concealed moan as Cas applied more pressure, circling his fingers and occasionally dipping his fingers towards the center.
They were back for the evening, having finished the usual to-do list of the day, and found a small cat sitting curled up on their pillow.
“I wasn’t sure which one to put on at first; should I put on the attachment molded after my own human form?” Cas mused, hand twisting around the head of his cock.
She looked from his raised hand to his face, then smirked. “Yes, toy – feed me.”
) and Dean was fortunate to find a place at all; he could have easily gotten stuck on Skid Row.
“Really?” Dean said incredulously. “Why? You can fight, you can do actual magic!”
Being achy in the morning was nothing new; he worked in retail, a sore body was more common than not. But this was an
They look at Naomi again, and she raises her eyebrows expectantly.
Dean shuddered, a shaky grin on his face at the thought. Good.

, Dean calls him, eyes warm) is an old friend of Dean’s; when John was too long on his pursuit after some beast or another, or seeking comfort at the bottom of a bottle, Bobby was there to give Dean first pick of the fresh fish before it was taken to the market. Dean doesn’t see him as much anymore, a realization he makes in Castiel’s shop, and one that turns the warm hearth in his eyes to cold ashes. Castiel traces the lashes of Dean’s eyes from the comfort of his paper.
alive.”)
A deep, long groan sounded behind him, so desperate and wanton that one could be forgiven for thinking
Eventually, the electric pleasure finally cut out and Dean slumped forward, panting and cursing, held up only by the rope around his wrists. Occasional whimpers slipped out, and Castiel languished in it, the vision that was Dean post orgasmic and still desperate for more, cock hard against his stomach and hips still twitching against the vibrator pressed up on his perineum.
Dean looked at them for a moment.
It’s hardly his fault. What does he care of the minutiae of life. When he goes to the market, he buys what he needs and nothing more, no matter how much the vendors holler and screech their wares and prices.
Cas turned and finished opening himself up, then wiped off his hand with the “sex towel” before grabbing the bit and turning back to his husband.
– and stripped off his clothes, putting them into the laundry bin.
“Yes mistress.” His face was on fire. It had to be. So much blood was rushing to his face and his cock at the same time that it was a wonder he could remain conscious at all. He had to resist humping the air.
Dean must pose for him in order to get his likeness.
“Please take a seat,” he said, gesturing to the infirmary cot.
Not expecting a response to what was not a question, he moves to find a second chair and places it in front of Dean, but not as close as he was before. He takes a seat, and turns expectantly to Dean.
“Follow me, please,” he said – ordered – and walked back into the room. As expected, Dean trailed in, looking at him with the same eyes he turned upon a pastry shop with free samples. He felt a bit like he was dragging him around with a leash.
But then his eyes snapped open and he jolted up, and action that he regretted immediately when soreness turned into something a little sharper.
He was a little shaken, but lined Dean up and slid down again, turning to look at Dean, to make doubly sure everything was alright.
“Ahhhh,” Dean said, sticking out his tongue.
“You are very lucky both that you are very cute, and that I don’t have any intent to blackmail you, because I could,” Not-Intruder said, scent like a breeze after rain. The Wolf ignored it, because the door was
Thus far, the kitsune hadn’t killed anyone. She seemed to be more of the trickster variety than the brain-eating type, which was a relief, so he probably wasn’t going to end up dead, but if he ended up on the local news with his whole ass hanging out for the world to see, he honestly would rather have the murder-y kitsune type instead.
Once Dean was dressed, a mirror image of Cas’s (Dean in brown leather, Castiel in black; he didn’t quite understand why, but the attendant at the store assured him that Dean would love it), Castiel settled himself on the chair in the corner of the room.
Packing their meagre possession, putting on a strong cloaking spell, and simply walking out of the compound was all that ended up being needed.
The arousal suffusing his whole body.
Soon enough, though, the man’s hips started to stutter, grinding hard against that part of him that made him feel
His body shaking body and his head rolling back, body trembling on his fingers, he was beautiful to see, lost in his bliss, that Cas couldn’t wipe his emotions off his face before Dean came down from his pleasure.
“…I do.” Cas admitted. They blushed. “I want to be a children’s magician.”
“No, no. I need you to be naked anyway,” Cas said, leaning on the wall. “Come now, don’t be shy.”
and had some sort of nerdy-goth-punk thing going on with his dark sweater-vests interspersed with metal looking tats and at least six piercings in his ear (but only one ear; he didn’t really understand punk fashion but he was benefiting so he was hardly complaining). He had the brightest blue eyes and a jawline that you could beat a man with, and if Dean were just a little more wolf than human he would do that open-jaw-tongue-out pant like a fuckin’ Looney Tunes character every time he caught a glimpse of Cas’s truly
At the moan from his mistress, he did it again.
Marble is cold. Hard. Blank. Unfeeling.
His non-occupied hand reached down to Dean’s leg and stroked it comfortingly. “Shhh,” he murmured, tone not unlike that used with newborn babies, head still turned away so Dean can’t see him grin. “There there, that’s a good boy.”
Michael draws his blade from his belt, advancing as he did so, and the lovers split in separate directions. Michael follows the artist, his ornate blade slamming down against Castiel’s humble metal chisel.
He did. Another crack echoed out, followed by the squelching sound of Dean desperately fucking himself on the man’s cock as he moaned again.
Dean pulled out immediately, knowing he wouldn’t survive more of that, and sat back on his knees as he desperately panted for breath and tried to pull himself back from the brink.
“Don’t worry doc, I know,” Dean said smoothly, less tense now with his instinct to antagonize triggered. “My boyfriend and I’ve got a bit of an age gap so he showed me the ropes. He’s had many a prostate exam, the old bastard.”
The ringing makes him grateful for Gabriel’s voice, sometimes. When he’s not there, he blocks it out with more hammering and chiseling.
It sat between them for a minute. Then Dean started to shake. Cas felt something bright and uncontrollable bubbling up, and they just started laughing. Their bodies shook and they tried desperately to stop, but looking back at each other only lead to more hysterical giggling. It went on and on and felt so strangely innocent for their current entanglement, and it felt so real. They felt ridiculous and joyful and comfortable and still hopelessly aroused; their shaking only created more friction between their bodies, and their gasping laughter turned to moans fairly quickly.
“Oh, you look
Who knew?
He tells him that he was an orphan on the streets with Gabriel, but was taken in by the generosity of the late master artist Annael. She had shown him everything he ever needed to know about the art of stonecarving, had gifted him his first chisel and hammer. She first trained him with cheap rocks and concrete before he was allowed to take a chisel to marble. He took to it like a duck to water.
Naomi swept into the room without even the attempt to knock on the door.
“Oh good, you’re awake.”
“Hey!” He hollered, trying to get their attention. “Hey, can you lend me a hand?”
He rolled off  the bed, grabbing a robe and ignoring Dean’s (very convincing) protests. “Oh, and Dean?”
Cas thought he’d try something.
He would look Castiel in the eyes. Then his eyes would flick down ever so slightly. He would lick his lips, and then his eyes would return back to his.
“Mr. Winchester?” He asked, fully knowing the answer.
“I’m going to need you to relax for this portion of the examination.” He lubed up his fingers, and stroked them across the pucker, not as gentle as he usually would be. This was supposed to be clinical, after all, and Dean never shied away from a little roughness during a scene.
Thank goodness they both are creatures of the night, because they don’t get much sleep after that.
inside.
“Very.”
“You might want to remove the horsetail plug from your ass.” He grinned at his lover’s gobsmacked face, and slid out of the room before Dean could respond.
They stood there. Not moving, just relishing in the feeling, even as it slowly drained away once it was noticed. But still something lingered, like a coal in a hearth.
Cas’s lips taste even better than he smells; metallic, like catching prey after a long hunt. But Dean knows that this time, he’s not the hunter.
Six years later, they saw another sunrise in their condo in the city.
Their brother makes a cake for them, and they eat their favorite dinner – cheeseburgers – with a degree of levity that they don’t usually have. It’s lighthearted, and it’s nice to see their friends Uriel and Anna and Inias crack jokes and laugh and shove each other around lightheartedly.
And in between the well wishes and the drinks, the lovers drink and kiss and Castiel promises Dean a picnic in the summer sun in the meadow of his childhood where the flowers grew.
Dean did.
He starts talking.
“I think we’ve been patient enough waiting,” she said briskly, setting a heavy bag on his desk and rifling through it. “Tomorrow you and your familiar will be beginning training together, so rest up.”
Dean grunted what Cas interpreted to be a confirmation that he was not aware.
Castiel didn’t look up from his notes of Dean’s face, perched next to his bowl of stew. “And how should she possibly know that?” He asked absently.
Dean grumbled inarticulately, predictably flustered at the moniker of “beloved” and still annoyed that his attempt at manliness trapped him into chores, but nonetheless obeying Cas’s demands.
His head fell back, then lolled over onto one of his bound arms. His head felt fuzzy and warm, with a flush from his cheeks to where those skillful fingers lingered. He was slumped over, unable to hold himself up, and his legs were planted shoulder length apart behind him, ass exposed.
“But then you tensed up again. What a shame, all that hard work gone to waste. You’re as tight as a clam, aren’t you, Mr. Winchester?” He gave a gentle two-fingered pat to his hole, inspiring another jolt, before pulling back. “Well no matter. I’m good at making anuses loosen up again for the exam. Be warned that it might stay loose for a while afterwards.”
, he thought. He had said his piece and reached out to Cas like Sam had suggested. Ball was back in Cas’ court now. It was up to the angel whether or not he wanted to take one last risk with the emotionally-constipated excuse of a human.
Somewhere down the street, a couple of teens sauntered back into their homes, grumbling indistinctly. Elsewhere, a car pulled into a driveway, the owner getting ready to turn in for the night.
So when Dean eventually found Sam on the bridge, things started falling into place. He found order in finding his family. In old friends and comforting smiles. He had even reconciled some old grudges and mistakes.
The weight he had walked in with had lifted from his shoulders. Granted, he still had to make things right with his son, assuming he decided to come back at all. He was stubborn, but Dean wasn’t as brash as his father had been at his age. He would be back, and this time Sam would actually try to listen.
“Is everything okay?” she asks, using her free hand to sign while she spoke. “Dean said you were looking into some missing kids-”
Not to mention that their place had a side garage and a freaking front porch looking out to the west. Hell, they even had an honest-to-God white picket fence surrounding the front yard. Dean tried to keep his wisecrack opinion about that one to himself.
And so the years passed this way. Eileen would disappear for a few days, keeping in touch with her boys and letting Sam know she was okay. The dreams never came, but Sam never felt like he could breathe normally until Eileen was back in his arms again.
The brunette woman stops herself suddenly, sensing the pervasive wrongness of the situation.
“Don’t worry about it, Sam. I’m here for you.”
If anyone could turn the Bunker into a home, it was Jody’s girls.
“A part of me keeps thinking he’ll walk in at any moment, all bow-legged and obnoxious, cracking open a beer with a smile and loudly joking about having to crash his own funeral.” A light-hearted laughter flowed through the crowd of hunters, some nodding along that yeah, that sounded like something Dean Winchester would do.
“The point, Dean, was that you tried at all.” He insisted, squeezing Dean’s shoulder in reassurance. “You could have accepted the life you were told to follow until the end of Chuck’s story. To live and die by the hunt like an obedient soldier. That may have been who you started out as, but you are your own person. It just so happened that The Fates have a cruel sense of humor.
Sammy had a point. With his trench coat, Cas was powerful but approachable. Without it, Cas looked...different. More polished and assertive. Even with his immaculate appearance utterly and thoroughly wrecked: white dress shirt rumpled, disheveled hair, blue tie askew, swollen lips and a glowing pink flush spread all across his cheeks and neck…all of it gave him that sexy I've-just-been-fucked-six-ways-from-Sunday look.
There was a note of encouragement in his eyes, the way they were warm and soft and honest. Once again, Sam couldn’t help but stare at the kid in awe.
“Sam,” she resumes, approaching him cautiously, “where’s Dean?”
As he got out, a smirk was playing at the corner of his lips. He stared down at the Impala, sitting innocuously underneath the warm sunlight. He gently rapped her hood with his knuckles and made his way towards the house with a lighter stride, his eyes shining and Jack’s promise playing over and over in his mind.
still feel lonely?
“And you wouldn’t happen to have any experience with that, would you?”
Dean swallows thickly. “But you’ll be back, right?” he asked, feeling pathetic.
They smiled at each other from across the way until Sam raised his arm in farewell, sliding into the vehicle and putting her in drive.
An old man laid back in his bed, listening to the machines beep and whirl around his head. The air was stale with the scent of hospital-grade disinfectant. Above him, hanging on the hospice walls, are the smiling faces of his family looking down on him, keeping him company.
He shook his head.
“Girls’ club, boys’ club, whatever you want. Just as long as it’s being lived in and used to help people who need it,” he smiles, holding out the lacquer box for the young hunter to take.
Or waiting to hold onto Sam’s ginormous fingers and never let go.
The most surprising moment was when a certain redhead ex-witch made her presence known.
Sam followed her gaze and took another moment to appreciate his new wife, still dressed in a simple white gown that, to Sam, could have been made for royalty. Eileen was amicably chatting away with Donna and Jody, her brown locks tumbling down her back with a soft bounciness in them. He felt his face glowing with pride and smiled to himself.
“You told me...you said that I wasn’t ‘Daddy’s Blunt Little Instrument.’” Dean looks away, unwilling to meet Cas’ sincere gaze, “I never told that to anyone, not even Sammy.”
Proving that Dean Winchester had made a difference in the world.
Fuck. He had really missed Cas.
He informed them that he had already burned Dean’s body himself. After everything the brothers had been through together, it didn’t seem right to have anyone else around. He wanted to do it alone.
Dean doesn’t react immediately, his mind trying and failing to come up with a witty comeback. He lifts his head away, gripping Cas by the shoulders and pulling back to examine the man in front of him, finding nothing in Cas’ body language to betray his words. He swallows the dry lump forming in his throat.
The door opened and drew his attention, reminding him that he had been waiting for someone.
Cas maintains a comfortable rhythm, humming agreeably with Dean’s groans of pleasure. Every so often the angel pulls off with a sultry pop to catch his breath, stroking Dean between heated, hurried breaths, eyes half lidded as he watches his partner pant and moan above him, coming apart under his touch.
By the time Dean entered middle-school, Sam had finally earned his paralegal degree.
“Eileen-“
His brother gives him a rough pat on the back, holding him close before breaking away. A weight lifts off of Sam as they break the hug.
Part two of my finale fix it. Even though this chapter deals with a little more speculation and less with actual scene's from the episode, there were still many issues that were left unresolved.
Before he could muster the courage to call out to him, he heard his brother’s low voice call out over his shoulder like a long-forgotten dream.
“Dad?”
“Of course we will,” Dean chuckled, like it was the most obvious thing ever. “This is Heaven. Paradise forever. Wouldn’t be living up to the name if you weren’t there to watch over me.”
“In my defense, I have found from experience that it is unwise to disrupt you midway through your tirades. I didn’t want to, uh, ‘step on your moment’,” he said, quoting the words with his fingers, “as it were.”
Her red lips softened into an affectionate smile, “Yes well, I always did have a soft spot for ya, eh?” she teased, pinching his cheek fondly. “I heard that you were throwing a bit of a celebration and figured it was high time we had ourselves a wee chat.”
He inhales deeply, squeezing the angel’s shoulders thoughtfully. Cas’ posture stiffens in anticipation under Dean’s touch.
Garth had told Dean that he had last seen Cas fighting in the East Wing before he lost sight of him. The poor kid had barely survived a freaking werewolf’s nasty bite and subsequent gnashing wounds, and yet, he still had the sincerity to apologize to Dean for not being able to help him more. Dean shook his head as he ran. That guy always had a few loose screws when it came to priorities. Maybe it was a Gryffindor thing.
“So wait, Cas isn’t gone?” Sam asks abruptly, pulling Dean out of his thoughts, “Then why didn’t he try to reach out to us on Earth? Let us know he was okay?”
There were low murmurs of agreement within the group. Claire’s young face stood amongst the crowd in front of him, her pale hand clutching Kaia’s shoulder and holding back tears, stubbornly refusing to cry. Donna and Jody stood nearby, watching Sam with warm, maternal smiles and a little a bit misty-eyed. Garth stood in the back, smiling fondly, no doubt remembering the good times and wacky adventures he had with Dean. Next to Garth, Bobby, Charlie, and the other survivors from Apocalypse World had their heads bowed respectfully for the man who had fought tooth and nail for their safety and new refuge.
Who needs therapy when you have a sweet ride to take you away from the things you want to avoid?
Sam jumped in his seat, startled to find himself no longer alone in the vehicle. A young man in a white bomber jacket sat with perfect posture in the passenger seat, his hands on his lap, looking around the interior of the Impala with a childlike grin.
Dean kept smiling. It came easy, like their banter, the jokes and teasing, pretending not to see Cas secretly smile as he realizes Dean compared them to a “married” couple. It was always easy to be himself when they were together.
It was like nothing had changed between them, and yet everything was different.
Dean stumbles ever so slightly at this realization.
everyone. Dean clenched his jaw and stared straight ahead through the windshield.
Should’ve. Could’ve. Would’ve. But never did.
Because come on, his brother had literally lived a all-american apple pie life without him. Just like Sammy had always wanted. He probably could have been happier for his brother if his mind didn’t keep reminding him that it was all possible because Dean had stepped out of the picture.
But now, radio silence. It was almost as if-
There wasn’t a single person within the Bunker walls who hadn’t experienced how  loyal and caring Dean had been, and it made his loss all the more tougher to swallow.
The ceremony itself was very homely and small with a few close hunter friends to witness their union. Bobby showed up with a bottle of top-shelf scotch and a firm pat on the back. Donna and Jody rode down together with the girls with food and endless hugs for both of them. Gertie, Kid Sam and Kid Cas took an immediate liking to Claire and her princess hair, much to her annoyance. Patience, being the only one  with any real experience handling kids, came to her aid and wrangled the kids into some fun activities. Before the night was over the kids were curled up at her side, sleeping soundly.
“Should I be?” He challenges, eyebrow quirked, sliding firm hands along Dean’s muscular thighs, thumbs teasingly brushing over the inner seam of his jeans.
“But,” she held up a hand patiently and looked him dead in the eyes, “I get to name the next one.” she insists pointedly. Sam is, for lack of better words, taken by surprise by the insinuation but recovers quickly enough with a short guffaw.
It was freaking fantastic, but something felt
"Are you okay?" Jack's voice was laced with concern. Sam cleared his throat.
Then last night happened. Harry Potter returned to Hogwarts, and it felt like the whole school finally woke up from its dazed stupor.
“Is it over?” Cas groans, his voice sounding heavier and more gravelly than normal.
“Yeah, well this ain’t my first rodeo, Cas, sorry to say. I’ve had to wiggle my way out of far more compromising situations than my little brother walking in while I’m getting blown.”
Cas hums in acknowledgement, focused on the task at hand.
He takes a deep breath to steady his nerves.
With the last dregs of sheer will, he covers his son's hand with his own, giving it a comforting pat. He sighed deeply and settled back into soft pillows, feeling his exhausted body melt right through them.
He replays the fight in his head in intense, vivid flashes.
Then when Dean left, he took all the warmth of the place with him.
“Do you know what really bothered me after you were gone? It wasn’t that you said...you know, that you ‘love me’, or that you kept your deal with the Empty a secret. Which,” he interjects, pointing at the angel, “we are definitely talking about later. No, what really got to me was that you didn’t think it was something you could have. How the hell could you know, Cas? You never asked!”
Sam had been leaning against the side of the house, looking out into the expansive backyard he and Eileen had paid a hefty amount to call their own when he heard her familiar Scottish drawl beside him. He startled, nearly spilling his drink as he turned to face her.
“It’s...good to see you too Jack. How, um, how have you been?”
Which reminded him...
“But what about the demons? Last time Dean and I were in Hell, they were talking about an uprising…”
him in theirs.
How Sam had been the one to trap him in a permanent ring of salt and then walked away, listening to Kevin’s desperate screams and pleas as he left him alone, unable to watch the kid slowly succumb to his madness.
He keeps imagining the same thing over and over again, wondering what he could have done differently that night. He should have called for help. He could have gotten the kit out of the Impala and patched his brother up long enough for them to get to the nearest hospital. He should have decapitated that vamp sooner before they got a chance to get the jump on Dean.
Now he was holding his son, so full of love and disbelief that this was all real, that this little human was a thing he and Eileen had made together, that he was actually a Father. This here, right now, was living proof that the broken, faulty, and cursed Sam Winchester had actually made something good.
He shook his head dismissively, “I don’t know...sometimes it feels like I don’t deserve to be so happy, you know? I just got lucky.”
“I know,” she tells him cheekily, her lips turned up in a playful smirk.
How the sweet, unlucky kid had become a malicious spirit without a tether to burn and free him from his torment.
“I was surprised how well you handled the situation, given the circumstances,” Cas admits huskily, changing the topic while massaging the sore muscles in his jaw. “To my understanding, it takes a fair amount of discipline to maintain composure when receiving a blowjob.”
It felt nice, comfortable even, to fall back into a semblance of their earlier life. Occasionally he glanced at the familiar crowd around him, at Jo’s appraising glances towards him, at Sam and Eileen sitting comfortably in the booth like they had always belonged, and then at his feet.
“You know…” he said tightly. “Then what the hell was the point? If I was always meant to die on a hunt from some freak accident, then what was the point of your sacrifice? Of taking out Chuck, tearing up the script and writing our own destinies instead?”
“Fuck,” he grits out, easing open his clenched fist as he uses the desktop to keep himself propped up. He was so freakin’ lucky that Cas hadn’t pulled a stunt like that while Sam was in the room.
Dean returns his attention to his laptop screen, knowing he’s on the receiving end of yet another one of Sam’s bitchfaces. Sam scoffs and steps back into the hallway, closing the door to Dean’s room shut behind him. Dean hears the metallic click of the latch and keenly listens to his brother’s receding footsteps echoing towards the front of the bunker.
And fuck, if Dean hadn’t just blown his load he’d be at half mast already from Cas’ commanding tone.
, he grumbled to himself. He remembered a time when he would run a mile in the morning, each morning, just for the energy. Now his breaths have become shallow and wheezing, his leg muscles worn down to almost nothing.
The subject of their conversation now seemed irrelevant, considering he had no idea how it led to his current situation, but Dean Winchester was not about to let minor questions like how or why get in the way of a blowjob.
“Of course not, Samuel. Not directly at least.” she implied slyly.
Many times Eileen had come home from a successful hunt to the two of them sitting at the dining room table, heads deep in their homework, their meals cold and forgotten at their elbows.
He almost immediately looks down, ashamed. The one thing Cas deserved to hear most was the very thing Dean couldn’t say without his tough guy personality getting in the way. The beginnings of his half-assed apology was halted by the soft press of deft fingers on either side of his face and the gravelly low whisper of Cas’ voice.
Because that's what Heaven 2.0 is meant to be; a place of reconciliation, where you can (finally) be with the people you love.
“Nope, they were totally married.” He loudly insists, ignoring the skeptical look Cas was sending his way. “No question about it. The world just wasn’t ready to accept it in the 90’s.”
“So...sucking me off, even while Sam was within hearing distance,” Dean pipes up lamely, catching Cas’ attention, “all that teasing was just a way to get back at me for calling your trench coat excessive?”
After taking him in and retrieving his things from the car, letting the frantic dog out of the back seat and locking up Baby behind her, Eileen made sure that Sam ate and took breaks between phone calls. She didn’t even hesitate to snatch the phone out of his hands and take over the conversation the moment Sam looked spent.  She brushed away his concerns with a subtle head shake and made the sign for “it’s fine” when he tried to apologize.
After the funeral, Eileen had visited more and more often as the months went by and Sam’s love for her had only grown deeper. Loving Eileen was uncomplicated, easy, and filled Sam with a deep sense of happiness, something that he didn’t think he would get to experience again.
Once the sun was cresting the hills, Dean decided it was time for him to finally hit the road. His brother had offered to let him stay with them until he got his bearings, but Dean waved him off, saying something about not wanting to get in the way of Sam and Eileen’s much needed “reunion time”. He laughed at Sam’s scandalized expression and quickly made his exit before his brother could retaliate. He manages to shout a brief goodbye to Eileen before the screen door closes behind him.
Cas frowns and tilts his head slightly. “Dean, I don’t think Xena of Amphipolis and Gabrielle-”
It wasn’t just the seasons; everything about the school had a murky oppressive feeling lingering in the air that had gradually seeped into the students for the past 9 months.
Dean knows he has a choice to make here. It's not something he wanted to do yet, he’s not even sure what the hell he wants to say to the guy, but he knows he needs to deal with it sooner than later. Especially now that Sam had gotten it in his head that the certain angel he’s been trying to cut some slack by avoiding may, in fact, be doing the exact same thing to him.
They had agreed to cremate her instead of a burial service with a headstone. A proper and legal hunter’s funeral. The same thing that awaited him.
“Since the start.” He admits, avoiding direct eye contact. “I heard every word you said.”
Dean wants to roll his eyes, because of course Cas can carry out a conversation as though he hadn’t almost been caught by the younger Winchester with Dean’s dick in his mouth.
Dean’s lips bore the semblance of an easy smile, enjoying the prospect of having more quiet moments like these with his brother somewhere down the line.
“Hello, Dean.”
That had been back in November. Dean hadn’t spoken to him since, refusing to acknowledge his presence altogether.
If it hadn’t been for Eileen, Sam wasn’t sure he would have been able to hold it together himself either.
Most new fathers questioned their ability to raise a child without screwing it all up. Sam questioned his ability to keep his wife and child safe from the many supernatural enemies he and Dean had made in the last two decades and, more specifically, whether he could keep them safe from himself.
The boy closed his eyes, furrowing his brow. “In Heaven, but not in the place where I left him.” Jack responded, his eyebrows still pressed together in concentration.
“Couldn’t tell you, man. Maybe he needed some space? Maybe Jack has him so tied up and busy running Heaven 2.0 that he hasn’t had time for niceties. All I know is that the guy made it out of Angel Superhell without us.”
Silence falls heavily in Dean’s room until it’s finally broken with a sharp, delightfully hissing intake of breath.
“I know.” He replies, touching their brows together.
“Dude, gross.” Sam crossed his arms, trying and failing to repress memories of accidentally walking in on Dean in various forms of undress, more often than not accompanied with another, curvier nude body. “I was just digging through some more of the Men of Letters stores. I think I found some pretty heavyweight stuff. Cursed jewelry, illegible books. I think we might even have one of the Dead Sea Scrolls.”
Dean chuckles slowly, now glad that he made Cas watch Police Academy and that the guy had, in fact, been paying attention to the movie after all.
Dean looks at Sam in confusion, getting annoyed when his younger brother chuckles at his ignorance.
“You- okay.” Dean clenched his jaw shut, afraid of what he might say if he didn’t.
“Oh, of course you saw it…” Castiel mumbled when he remembered the circumstances of Dean’s and his first meeting, and he hung his head in shame.
Gradually, Dean melts into their contact which slows to gentle pecks, and then stops entirely until they merely breathe against each other. “Cas… Castiel…"
the answer to everything,” he muses, and he senses Castiel’s confusion five whole seconds before the former angel voices it.
“Seriously, Dean,” Sam let out an exasperated groan. ”At least text him. Preferably from your own damn phone this time.”
“I wasn’t expecting that,” Castiel said as he sipped at his glass of wine.
“We’re here,” Castiel announced, pointing at the HallowInn. There was a horse, tied to the pole in front of the building, and tunes of classic rock were blasting through the open windows.
“But that’s like nine flavors of crazy, with a little topping of insane.”
As he slid into the Impala’s passenger seat, he glanced at Dean, who sat with his arms crossed in front of his chest. Business talk then, Castiel decided.
“So, that’s why you were that antsy the week I had my accident?”
“I did something stupid.”
“Dean?” Castiel’s deep voice snapped him out of his reverie.
“Of course. I meant every word. I wasn't planning on telling you all of it, and I'm sorry for dumping it on you like that, but I thought that was my only chance.”
A few minutes before eight o’clock he heard a car’s engine rumbling loudly. He looked out of the window, and saw a sleek black car nearing. He cast a last glance at himself in the mirror, and hurried downstairs to meet Dean. The other man was wearing black slacks with a red button-down shirt, and even though he looked a little uncomfortable in it, the smile on his face was bright.
“Okay,” Dean repeated. “Don't think that you're off the hook just because you have the coolest attempt at a get-out-of-jail-free card.”
“We have time,” Dean shrugged then settled one of his arms onto the Impala’s door, trying to appear casual.
“Loki,” Dean echoed. “Like… the demigod?”
“Alright, angel.” Dean’s flush deepens but he doesn’t turn his head to follow Cas. It’s theatrical but exciting, just as Cas imagined it would be when they discussed it; and based on Dean’s labored breathing, he wasn’t about to complain either. He runs a finger down Dean’s spine to the lacy waistband of the panties, eliciting a full-body shiver from him.
“Aww, baby, I’m so sorry,” Becky cooed, before continuing. “I read the whole thing till the end that afternoon, and I passed it on to the nicest editor of the mystical horror-genre, because I really wanted to get it published. She refused to work with it, but she said that if I really liked it that much, I should try editing it myself, and maybe we could talk about it then. I did just that, and a month later I was officially the editor of “The woman in white”, since then known as the first part of the Supernatural-saga.”
“Well, I think I will have a special guest assistant for this one then! This way, Castiel,” Dean pointed towards his studio.
“You look great,” Castiel blurted out, and when he realized what he had done, he hid his face behind his glass.
“I’m so sorry for being late, I’m having a day from hell, it’s like I pissed off a deity or something,” he rambled, running a hand through his dark, windswept hair.
It sounded too good to be true. They could take a volume each, read it, analyse it, and then come back together and share notes. From the way Jordan described it, there seemed to be an overarching narrative as well which would allow them to track the developments of the characters across the length of the story. It would definitely make for a detailed and interesting project.
“So, good news, for the rest of the semester you’re only gonna have one piece of homework from me,” A cheer went up around the classroom, “but bad news is that its gonna be a group project, and I’m picking you’re groups!” As the teacher finished speaking, she put the groups up on the interactive whiteboard and everyone scrambled to get into their assigned groups.
Guys, seriously, if you're queer, get yourself some non-toxic queer friends because they're amazing. It can really make you feel less isolated, especially if you can't come out to/don't feel comfortable coming out to your family. I love my friends, they're the most insane group of assholes I've ever met, and I love spending time with them.
If you can't meet people or be open about yourself in person, then the internet is your friend. There are all sorts of LGBTQ+ accounts on Instagram that have posts where you can leave your info if you're looking for a friend. Also, don't be afraid to reach out. One of my friends found her girlfriend because said girlfriend opened a conversation with a really morbid joke. Go for it guys!
“But you tried, you actually listened to what I said, and for once you seemed to take my words to heart. Do you really think so little of yourself that you’d let an unreasonable expectation of who you are make you unhappy?”
Cas smiles lightly at Dean’s confession, a sight that plucks at just the right heartstrings inside his chest to ignite a low, warming fire in his gut. Maybe it was because of the fondness in Cas’ eyes, or the remnants of adrenaline still coursing through his veins from surviving the nightlong battle at Hogwarts, or because he had nearly died and lost Cas in one night, or because after everything that had happened, Dean was willing to throw caution out the fucking window and close the gap between them with a kiss.
“Ah.”
feel the way humans do!”
And the worst part was not even knowing if Dean was at peace. After everything, pissing off Heaven and Hell, averting a few pre-planned Apocalypses and ganking enough soldiers on both sides, what had happened to Dean?
She waved a hand to get his attention before signing, “Everything is okay?” expectantly. There was a hint of worry in her question, something a new parent picks up and carries with them until their final breath.
“Th- Because it was! But that’s not the point here.”
Eileen’s mouth quirked at the corners. She puts on an exaggerated show of considering his question, eyes shining mischievously. They share a smile and lighthearted chuckle together, foreheads touching as they take in the moment.
The blonde scowled at him, but it was all for show.
But at that moment, none of it mattered to Sam Winchester. He looked into Eileen’s alarmed brown eyes and admitted the truth he had been running away from for the last four hours.
“Go on, get out of here,” he jokes. “And tell Jack that I expect a visit from him. Just ‘cause he’s calling the shots in Heaven 2.0 or whatever, the kid’s got no excuse ghosting us. Especially Sam.” Cas gives him another one of those soft smiles.
“Are you okay?” She signs.
Sam regarded the female hunter solemnly. His lungs felt heavy while his mind raced around frantically. Eileen reached out to him and instinctively clasped his massive hand in her smaller one, feeling his normally steady grasp shaking gently beneath her affectionate touch. His nerves tingling at the harsh comfort of contact.
He had fallen asleep at the wheel and dreamt of Jack’s visit.
It was 4 in the morning when Sam first held what he considered to be a miracle.
Dean almost laughs out loud watching his little brother’s nose crinkle in disgust.
“My apologies,” the angel apologizes passively, his deep, gravelly voice carrying a raspy tune as he speaks. “I was under the impression that you enjoyed a little...dangerous thrill, I believe it’s called.”
“Easy on the teeth there, tiger.” He chides, finally acknowledging the dark haired man hiding in the shadows under his desk. He locks eyes with Cas, peering up at him from between his legs as the other man languidly pulls off his hardened cock with a soft pop.
The familiar becomes a steady fixture in Castiel’s life.
He moved back over to the table and grabbed a pair of latex gloves – a bit useless at this point, but it was for the theater of it all. He slipped them on and gave the latex a little snap, and was pleased when Dean made a small, needy sound.
