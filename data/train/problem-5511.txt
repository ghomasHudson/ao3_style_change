“Hi dar- oh! Oh dear what did you do?” Steve shrugged and let his mum sit him on a chair so she could inspect his scrapes and bruises.
No one was talking to him in the conference room. Fury still wasn’t there, Coulson obviously hadn’t been called and Clint was sitting on his own on one side of the table. Natasha, Steve and Tony were sitting across from him, Thor to his right and Bruce to his left. They all glared at him, except for Steve who still looked like Clint had stolen Christmas.
Thor comes over once and Steve lets him in because he genuinely seems to think Steve’s body has been taken over by some alien race and insists on monitoring him for 24hrs. He enjoys it a lot more than he should, Thor is loud and friendly and doesn’t ask the wrong questions.
“Nope, not yet.” Thor let out a loud whoop as Peter wheeled over to the fridge to get himself some juice. As Thor watched the toaster, waiting for the chocolate treats to appear the date August 17th turned into more than just a day.
“What exactly are you doing?” she asks, arms crossed, not even apologising. Tony gives a sigh and lifts his goggles.
“A water would be lovely Steve, thank you.” He’s pretty sure people don’t use their manners when they’re about to kill you, but Pepper was an exception to most rules he supposed.
The letter that he was trying very hard not to rip stated that even though Colonel Fury was out on business, Agent Coulson found the purchase of acidic arrows were more of a 'de-vestment than an investment' and 'people are still recovering from the sewerage incident earlier this year and that was with a bow and twig.'
Natasha could always use that scary voice of hers that has everyone hold their breath and hide- even Steve who’s her favorite. She wouldn’t though. Clint could already see the way she would make that noise in the back of her throat, which everyone knows is a laugh, and walk away rolling her eyes. Maybe he could withhold sex until she got him the arrows. No, that always backfired when Natasha agreed with him and kept a good distance between them in the bed. Clint normally caved two days later.
Tony hated hospitals, he always had and she was sure that he always would. This was just going to amplify his hate.  Tony had ran straight past the large group of heroes standing in the waiting room looking not too super at all.
“I told you the tales of body snatchers!” Thor thunders before literally summoning a loud crack followed by a strike of lightening. Steve isn’t blind to the fact that Tony has gone quiet.
Steve doesn’t see Sharon again, she tells him to call her and when he doesn’t she stops coming over for scrabble and jeopardy and Steve finds himself alone.
“Caller ID Cap, we’ve gone through this one before.” He can see the embarrassment on Steve’s face turn to realisation, and then switch back to embarrassment.
“Why didn’t you?” Tony knows he shouldn’t have half and erection right now, that it’s really not the time or the place, but Steve smells so much like home, and he’s looking at Tony for the first time in over a month with just the smallest amount of light in his eyes, lines on his face smoothed out.
"Yeah oh, and this is the only time you can ever buy me back with gifts." Clint chuckled as she leaned forward and pressed her lips to his.
“I am so insanely proud of you Peter. You are a strong brave man and I will never be disappointed in you. You could never disappoint me because you are so much like your pop, you are so good and you have so much strength and I have so much belief in you. Don’t ever doubt that Peter.” Peter gives a small timid smile and curls into Tony’s chest, strong arms wrap around him and his head is slightly pressed against the arc reactor. Tony holds Peter tightly, feeling his son in his arms and giving a wide grin as tears fall down his face.
“Of course I love you. I love you so much and I am always going to love you because you’re my son, and that won’t change.”
“Steve, I’m really sorry. I’ll…I’ll talk to Fury ok?” Steve sighed and stood up leaving the room. Clint looked after him helplessly.
Natasha was staring at the puppy, she looked almost smitten. “Bruce is going to regret this when he comes back.”
“My pop tarts are casseroles?” he asked, disgusted by the very thought. Peter laughed and threw a box onto the counter of Chocolate Pop Tarts.
“You clean up nicely.” Tony said, announcing his presence on the balcony where Steve is tucked away. The air is chill against his champagne flushed skin, he welcomes it.
, Steve’s hands moved to Tony’s waist, he let out an approving moan at the touch, desperate to be pulled tightly against Steve’s warm body.
It turned out the only thing that could make Tony Stark smile in the morning was either Steve shirtless or an official letter from S.H.I.E.L.D that was addressed to anyone but him.
“He’s lost it.” Peter declares as they look around the house, and they all knew it’s true. Everything, literally everything had been redone. All of it wheel chair compatible, all of it making Peter’s job a little easier, a little less noticeable. The counters had been moved down, the floors all smooth, the carpets ripped up, bars in random parts of the hallway and that was just what they could see from the door.
Tony found him sitting at the bench that morning, the tower still with sleeping heroes. Steve was an early riser and Tony kept odd hours, enjoying the moments he found Steve alone.
“They came from a diner down the road, owner was pretty upset about his failed health rating. I’m serious.” Steve adds when he catches Tony staring at him, astonished. “I can get you out of the debrief if you want?”
She leaves Steve in his apartment where her words echo around him, bouncing off surfaces and ringing in his mind deep into the night. He runs to the rhythm of them, sleeps to their insistent clanging.
“Ste-” Tony’s cut off by two phones beeping, because of fucking course evil takes six weeks off and then decides to come back the exact moment he’s pretty sure Steve Rogers is confessing his love for him.
Once he picks up the phone Tony gave him, dials his number and listens to the pattern of rings and silences, certain no one will be pick up.
“It was because something shifted. It wasn’t you and it wasn’t me but there was something different, you had this new energy that I hadn’t seen before. It wasn’t until they all moved into the tower that I realised what had caused it.”
Really it shouldn’t have been such a surprise. After the entire vintage card scenario everyone knew Phil had a large case of the worships for the Captain. Clint smirked to himself and thought of poor vulnerable Steve who Coulson worshipped.
“We miss your presence at the tower Steve, our brothers and sisters in arms will be glad to know you are still you.” Thor tells him, warm hand on his shoulder.
“I’m sorry. I never told you I was sorry after…after I…” he couldn’t bring himself to say the words. Tony just shrugged, seemingly indifferent. Steve wanted so desperately to see under the mask he was wearing so well.
It caused his breaths to become laboured, his throat to close and his arc reactor to sting painfully in his chest.
“This is too much.” Bruce muttered walking out of the room. Clint looked after him helplessly. Without the threat of Bruce hulking out they could do whatever they wanted to him really…the thought terrified him.
“What did you do Clint Barton?” Ok so maybe she didn’t know…but she still knew…he was never going to understand that woman.
“Iron Man have you evacuated the building?” Steve asked over the coms, his question followed by a stiff grunt. Tony scanned the building one more time, his radar coming up empty.
On these nights, with sleep nowhere in sight and temptation too close for comfort he heads out in the crisp air, runs to the tower and stares up at the windows, wondering if Tony is staring back down at him.
“I meant what I said that day Tony. I’m not the love of your life, that doesn’t mean no one is.” He watched her go, silently closing the door behind her.
Tony has a small smudge of icing on his bottom lip, Steve lets his hand rise between them, reaches out rubs his thumb against it, brings it up to his lips and licks it off.
“ttttttssssit!” Peter gurgled and Natasha froze. Peter might not be able to say his ‘Sh’ but she definitely knew what that word was.
“He’d like that.” Steve agrees and then they just stand there, because neither of them are really sure what to do next.
It was a normal August morning, somewhat warm but Peter still felt the need to use the blanket Pepper had made for him. He wheeled himself into the kitchen slowly, it was early in the morning and he was sure no one else was up, the snores coming from Clint and Natasha’s room somewhat confirmed this.
There was always loud music in these situations. Music blasting from the radio as Harry sang a bad rendition of ‘call me maybe’. Peter hadn’t seen the car, he would have stopped though, even if he did have right of way. How could he not? His pop had been the one to teach him how to drive. But he didn’t see the car. He heard it, felt it, experienced it as metal wrapped around metal and the radio stuttered, skipped and then stopped all together.
“Thanks.” Steve manages, returning the shoulder hold before Thor is swinging his hammer and flying through the air.
“Hulk save puppy!” the big green man said, standing tall with a tiny dog in his palm, the animal seemed barley phased as Hulk made cooing noises at it.
He does take Steve to the gala, but he also invites the rest of the avengers so it doesn’t count as a date. Not that it would have been a date anyway because Tony is not going there. Steve is precious and kind and probably not even gay so there’s not point worrying about it.
“I’m good Pep. Just…in between people” he tried to lace his words with suggestion but the look on Pepper’s face told him he had failed.
“It was a bit of a mess without our fearless leader there. Turns out we don’t make a great democracy. Clint kept telling Thor he’d vote to keep the flying around if he gave him free lifts around the city, then Darcy decided she deserved a say and got on board that band wagon and suddenly it was the three of them against me Nat and Bruce. We argued for hours before finally deciding to flip a coin for it.
“That’s right Petey, that’s your papa.” Clint had said with a sigh before turning back to the TV. He had missed the concentration on Peter’s face as he watched Steve march around. He hadn’t seen the way Peter’s small feet had started tapping in rhythm with his fathers. What he did see, however, was Peter as he slowly pushed up onto his knees.
Folding the letter and placing it on his bedside table Clint pulled out a stack of S.H.I.E.L.D paper that he was meant to use for paper work. If Coulson could write some fancy pants letter telling him he was not at all allowed acidic arrows then he could write one explaining exactly why he would be getting those arrows.
“Steve.” He tries to push down the bile that slides up his throat at how broken Tony sounds, he turns just slightly, enough to see the pain etched all over Tony’s face, and then walks away without looking back.
He was packed thirty minutes later and when he walks past to kitchen where Tony is picking at a sandwich, he keeps his eyes firmly ahead of him, refusing to see if Tony was watching him leave
“Send the  bugs my way team, rigging this thing to blow.” He flew around the building, loading it with explosives.
Steve gently stroked Peter’s forehead as he moved towards the bed, his hands brushing over the brown locks and gently caressing the only skin that didn’t seem damage. His other arm was wrapped tightly around Tony who was looking at Peter with glassy eyes.
“Tony.” Steve nodded when he entered the kitchen, poured himself a coffee and watched Steve eat a slice of toast, thick with PB&J.
"Ahh..." He started unimpressively. Coulson sighed and pushed the door open a little more before walking to his desk. Clint takes that as his cue to come in and sit across from Coulson in one of the black leather chairs. He leans forward to take a few jellybeans out of the bowl. Really, was Coulson a principle in his past life or something?
“I’m just going to go now…” Tony muttered, sneaking past the Hulk how was still glaring at Clint. He let out a large huff that nearly knocked Clint off of his feet.
“Yup. We’ll be husbands and have a family like you and pa.” his ma took his hands in hers, squeezing them tight enough that his scrapes started to burn.
“I fell. Tommy Winkle piggy backed me three whole blocks! Do you think I can be as big as him when I’m older?” His ma smiled up at him, slowly dampening a cloth with antiseptic, he tried not to wince at the sting.
Clint stared down at the letter in his hands from S.H.I.E.L.D that had arrived for him that morning. Tony had brought it in from the hallway with a large smirk on his face.
“No.” Tony glared at him. This Steve thing was definitely getting out of control. Before Clint could even reply the door opened to reveal a large green chest heaving. Clint and Tony both stared as the Hulk stood there, arms crossed and head out of view.
Steve’s eyes would dance with light when he read the comics in the paper and sparkle with triumph whenever he understood a reference past his time. In the mornings Steve would sip on his coffee with the rest of his team and speak with a husky voice, still thick with sleep, hair tousled and soft.
“Honestly the guy disappears for six weeks and then comes back and tries to change the rules.” Clint throws in, Steve hears an arrow whistle past his ear.
He had been reaching for a glass on the top shelf, leaning forward, using one of his arms to support his weight. It all happened very quickly then. One minute the chair was rocking, then it was rolling from under him, Thor turned in time to cry and leap to catch him and Peter closed his eyes. But nothing happened. Thor wasn’t holding him, he hadn’t hit the ground, he was just standing there. Eyes shut tightly, he heard the scrambling of feet down the hall- a result of Thor’s loud call of “PETER!” There was a gasp though, a loud gasp and then Peter opened his eyes. One hand braced on the kitchen counter, the other stretched out in front of him Peter was standing, not leaning, not holding himself up by his arms but firmly standing on two feet. He looked at the floor where Thor was lying, eyes wide, his fathers standing in the hallway, hands clasped as tears swelled in their eyes.
Bucky doesn’t seem to be able to find words, and Loki can feel the mental link opening a little more. Taking a risk Loki lets his barrier fall and floods Bucky with his emotions, letting him see everything he’d ever concealed from him before.
The team know the only way to end this fight is by using the Stones. But who will be the one to do it?
Tony isn’t sure what to expect when he and Rhodes land at the entrance to the address that Sam had sent them earlier. The same man is standing at the entrance looking a mixture of sheepish and pissed off.
. Not to mention we need the public to see me out and about like normal; they all seem to think I’ve died.’
‘I thought Mr Stark’s parties were notoriously outrageous and loads of fun? This is boring as hell,’ he says.
Tony just nods and they continue in a companionable silence for a few moments. ‘Well I think we should all get an early night anyway,’ he says, stretching as they both finish their drinks, ‘so I’m going to head off. We’re setting out fairly early in the morning to get to the site. We want to get back as soon as possible after all. I’m not going to be happy if we’re separated from the team when Thanos gets here.’
Peter swallows, knowing he’s not going to like the answer. ‘Zemo. Helmut Zemo, the guy who forced us all to fight in Germany.’
I'd also be interested to see where everyone thinks we might be going with this series. Do leave your predictions, you never know you might give me some inspiration for a different track!
‘So you got badass,’ Deadpool says, though his voice is quieter than his usual teasing tone. When Peter doesn’t say anything he adds: ‘Why did you do that?’
He taps a finger on the report as he thinks. ‘Why not? Inform him I am pleased with his work so far, and warn him what will happen if his improvements do not continue.’
‘Couldn’t you just make him dream that he did the hunt or something?’ Peter asks Wanda quietly. The girl chuckles and shakes her head.
‘Whatever, Pool,’ he says, taking a bite out of a taco. ‘I thought you wanted to catch up on information?’
‘Just remember to keep your mask up alright?’ he says instead, smiling as much as he can as another cough wracks his body. ‘Can’t be losing you now we just got you back.’
‘Good question,’ Steve smiles, ‘yes we do if one or two of us are going with a team into the field we’ll do a couple of runs of this course and others so they can get used to how our abilities work in the field. So many times stories of what we can do get blown out of proportion and if an agent doesn’t know
“It will be alright.” Tony whispers and it’s a blatant lie. They both know it. Nothing is going to be all right because for all they know Peter could be bleeding out on an operating table right now and they might never see him smile or laugh or make some witty science joke again. And that is most definitely not all right.
“Tony, that day in the lab when you kissed me. I’ve never wanted to be kissed by anyone more than I did in that moment.” Steve notices the tension in Tony’s body evaporate, he leans further in, Steve can feel Tony’s head on every inch of his body, his dick hardens in his pants. “You said you wished it had never happened and I respect that, I get it I reacted…well badly is an understatement but badly. I understand if you don’t want whatever this is, but I’ve had time to think. A lot of time actually, it’s been pretty miserable, but I know that if now, in this time I can love someone, anyone, you’re the only person I’d want to give that love to.” Steve reaches out again, lets his hand brush over Tony’s cheek, trail down his jaw, he hooks it under this chin and tips it towards him.
“No. I mention it and he goes and uses his puppy dog eyes on Coulson because he thinks he’s doing everyone a favor.”
“It doesn’t matter okay? It’s nothing anyway.” He tried to get back to his paperwork, after all he did have a company to run. Pepper wasn’t letting up though, she pulled the files from his hands and stood up, leaning over him.
“Well first you got the arrows…Natasha’ your girlfriend and you want to make her happy because an unhappy Natasha means no sex for you and you said not even a week ago how funny it would be if Thor carried around one of those puppy poodle purses.” Had he really said that? Way to be subtle Clint. He scolded himself and Tony looked triumphant, smirking and all.
“He’s in surgery? Who signed the release papers? Was it Steve? Wait…Steve…where…where’s Steve?” The desperate tinge to his voice didn’t go unnoticed and Pepper fought a wince at Tony’s pleading eyes.
‘You pulled me out of the water,’ he replies, ‘I think it should be me thanking you. Either way you know what this means?’
‘Sorry,’ she says eventually as they wander along one of the paths, ‘you’re probably not that interested in all this are you?’ She laughs. ‘Thank you for taking me, Vis, it was wonderful. Did you enjoy it?’
‘You and me both. Loki… Strange says we can break the link now if we want to,’ he guesses there’s no point beating around the bush.
Ok, ok. Honestly? I didn’t really do it for Tin Can or the rest of them. I didn’t even do it for you fucktards, or because the author doesn’t want to kill Tin Can (because apparently that’s too much… you know still letting Vision die is fine but Tony? Oh no we have to draw the line somewhere apparently).
The dark skinned man sighs, this was going to be harder than he thought. If that was even possible. ‘Don’t play stupid, Bucky, it doesn’t suit you. Loki. Why won’t you make a move?’
‘Uh huh,’ and Tony can practically hear the phone bouncing in the teenager’s hand as he nods. ‘Yeah May and Stewart were
‘Show me the video call from Hammer the day after Scott arrived. I want to see what both sides were able to see.’
So I am going to say I was about halfway through writing the smut scene with Steve and Tony, and then it just didn't feel right having it in this story. I don't know why it just didn't seem to fit. Sorry I know some of you have probably been waiting to get around to it. Maybe there'll be some in future instalments of the series, but not yet. To be fair I feel that smut, like torture, scenes are better when they're left more to your imagination. I'm sure you can fill in the blanks with something much more satisfying than if I just gave it to you!
‘Will you come and join in our Yule celebrations?’ Peter asks Matt as they go to leave the apartment, Wade is going to head back separately so he can tie up any loose ends from his assignment and has already left through the other door.
Peter sighs. ‘It’s not that I don’t appreciate the offer, Deadpool,’ he says, ‘but I barely know you, and what I do know about is that you’re a killer with questionable sanity.’
She looks over at Bucky and he shrugs. ‘Seems like a good plan to me, and he is right: Fury wanted to use him to do this so it wouldn’t alert HYDRA to what we know.’
‘They’re arriving now,’ Fury confirms for her, and Bucky looks up to see several quinjets arriving and beginning to fire into the oncoming hordes.
‘Come here,’ Sam sighs, coming to stand in front of him wearing a matching black suit, ‘honestly, Cap, I thought you’d done this millions of times.’
Natasha has always spent a good part of her time in the training room, for a variety of reasons. Initially it was habit, then it became a way to scope out the abilities of the team she was to work with, and then to build relationships with the people she’d work with for a couple of months before moving on to a solo mission or another team.
‘It’s supposed to be,’ the woman who is left there says, sounding rather harassed, ‘but the performers double booked and they aren’t coming.’ She sighs and looks over at a group of elderly people all sitting in wheelchairs, some younger people stood around the edges of the group. ‘Sorry it’s just, we’re from a nursing home and we make this trip every year so the residents get to see some carols and get to see the city all lit up. It’s one of our traditions and now I’m just not entirely sure what to do.’
Natasha notices the small smile that Peter tries to hide and feels a twinge of unease in her stomach. ‘I’ve faced him a couple of times as well. Not someone you want to be on the bad side of, I’ve seen him make mincemeat out of damn good agents.’
Tony blinks a couple of times, completely taken aback by the question. Then he nods and pulls out the chair next to him. ‘Sure thing, kid. Let’s take a look.’
Nebula brings her tankard up to toast and the two women drink together in a quiet, companionable silence.
‘Anyway!’ Peter cuts across before anyone else can say anything to embarrass him. ‘Aren’t we supposed to be having a party to celebrate the new year?’
Tony lets the helmet melt away from his face, smiling at her in relief. ‘Thanks to you we are. Steve? You alright, babe?’
‘With the amount of food we’re making I’m sure we’ll have enough to eat for the whole year!’ Bucky laughs. ‘Still feels strange having all this to eat after growing up like we did, don’t it Stevie?’
‘You surprised me,’ the humanoid responds, ‘your web caught one of the weights and pulled it into my back before I realised what was happening and was able to phase to avoid it.’
‘You’re welcome, Thor,’ Steve says, clapping the god on the shoulder, ‘keep yourself safe and hurry back.’
Clint grins at him. ‘As Tony would say: “sneaky spy shit”.’ Then he sobers again. ‘She won’t go back to something with him, though, I know that for certain. She…’ he seems to struggle to find the right words, ‘she threatened his conditioning, and when they were separated they started to realise she wasn’t quite the true Black Widow they’d trained her to be.’
Tony waves him off. ‘Forget the money, Lang. And who the hell is Ralph?’ Scott holds up a finger where Tony can see an ant crawling. ‘That’s slightly disturbing.’
A/N: Hi everyone. I'm so sorry I'm late in updating this week, I had a bit of an interesting weekend and didn't get chance to update. I hope it was worth the wait though I'm not so sure if it is yet.
what I am finding difficult: not having her here and being surrounded by reminders of family and friends.’
‘Pfft,’ a female voice laughs, still hidden behind the bank of screens, ‘you just need to learn to chill.’
‘Alright you lot, show’s over! Leave the poor kid alone, he puts up with enough from you lot as it is. And before anyone says anything, I’ve already threatened Wade if he hurts Pete, or tries anything over PG13 before he’s eighteen,’ Tony says.
She just hopes Strange can remember what she needs and keep it at the front of his mind long enough. After this she is never complaining about a study session ever again.
‘She knows, you know,’ Tony says as they lay together on the bed, legs tangled together and Tony half laying on Steve tracing intricate patterns on his chest that only Tony could understand the meaning of.
‘Are you more worried about losing control of your powers or about hurting someone if you overreach?’
When Steve rejoins the group Wanda and Natasha are already challenging each other to races and taking bets on who was going to win. He notices Tony sitting a little apart with Bucky as the two of them tie their skates.
‘I didn’t want to put the pressure on Mom to cook this year,’ Rhodes says, ‘which you know she’ll insist on doing if I go over there. But it seems weird not going to see her for Christmas.’
‘For now,’ Steve smiles, putting his gun away as security officers come in to deal with the rest of the squad.
Strange looks at his trembling hands and nods. ‘Please,’ he says quietly. Loki nods and takes the doctor’s offered hands and frowns in concentration. Tony and Sam look on in silence, and Tony feels strangely humble at being able to watch this exchange; after a few minutes Loki releases Strange’s hands and he can see they don’t tremble quite so hard as before.
At the moment I'm planning on uploading two chapters a week until I've finished writing the story, and then updates will be a little more frequent.
Thor and Valkyrie would travel to replace Mjolnir once Loki was healed enough to help transport them, the trickster would remain with them, the Space Stone still in his possession, to continue to heal and lead the remaining Asgardians; Bruce, Tony and Loki were all going to study the Mind Stone with Vision in an attempt to see if they could understand the stones better and how they might be combated, T’Challa had offered to send Shuri to help, and to open her lab to them. Strange is taking the time to set up a permanent portal between the facility and the Sanctum, and one between the Sanctum and Wakanda so they can move between the locations much quicker; he’d only agreed to do it if the Sanctum was the focal point as it was easier to ensure unwanted visitors stayed out.
‘Yeah but Stevie says since they don’t live here they don’t have to clean it up. Asshole,’ Bucky replies.
‘Come on Point Break,’ Tony pats Thor’s shoulder, ‘let’s get you upstairs and you can tell us what’s going on when the others join us. We’ve got a few things to catch you up on as well.’
He’d remembered the name of the place from the couple of times Wade had mentioned it, and had decided his best bet to track down the mercenary was here. Trying not to think what any of the team’s reactions would be if they knew what he was doing, he pushes open the door to ‘Sister Margaret’s’ and walks down the dark staircase.
‘I don’t know what you wanted to accomplish by coming here and doing this, Sharon,’ he cuts her off. ‘I don’t know whether finding Peggy’s possessions brought back the grief at her death and you wanted an outlet for it, or if you wanted to attack Tony for another reason. But if you were intending to break up the team again you were never going to succeed.’
‘Peter? What’s wrong?’ Natasha asks, standing up from where she’s sat at one of the tables on a laptop.
‘Think you can get him stable enough to get to Wakanda? I’m sure Shuri will be willing to help you in her labs once we get there.’
‘Just have the engine running by the time I get there.’ She turns and, taking out a gun, peers round the doorframe, stepping over the body on the floor when she sees it’s clear and hurriedly pushes it inside the office, closing the door behind her.
‘So Bucky just had to go and prove he could,’ Rhodes finishes. ‘Doesn’t he understand the concept of not drawing attention to yourself?’
Tony feels that everything goes in slow motion as he sees Thanos lift his hand, the concealed knife now in plain view, and he sends it flying towards Peter, whose face is no longer covered by the mask of his suit.
‘Come on, Cap, let’s get out there and say hi to everyone,’ the shorter man says, clapping a hand on his shoulder and steering him out the door.
Whatever insult he is about to say is drowned out by the ominous rumbling sound coming from around them. Steve looks up to see a crack forming in the ceiling. ‘Look out!’ he shouts, pulling Bucky back as the ceiling begins to collapse. Luckily there’s an exit down a tunnel just behind them and they manage to get far enough down it to be safe.
He’s not quick enough and the Titan flips them so he’s pinning Thor to the ground, the axe between them as Thanos tries to drive the blade into his brother’s chest, and Thor struggles to keep it away.
‘Yeah, Laura and the kids aren’t coming though as Laura has family round. Clint was all but begging for an invitation to come,’ she laughs, ‘apparently he told Laura he had to come to do some team building or something.’
‘Loki what happened?’ Sam speaks up and Loki looks around the room, meeting the worried gazes of the team.
‘I’m certain of it. He’s attempting to gain all of the Infinity Stones. If Loki has brought the Tesseract with him then there are three stones here on Earth: one is with Vision,’ he points to the stone in the humanoid’s forehead, ‘and one is with a sorcerer Loki and I have met before.’
‘I’m not really in the mood, Deadpool,’ Peter growls. ‘I’ve had a pretty crap day and I don’t think you’re here to make it any better.’
Sharon’s voice is suddenly cut off and Steve looks at her to see tendrils of red light around her. He spins to look at Wanda, and sees the girl looking furious. ‘Come with me,’ the young woman spits, ‘and don’t you
‘I didn’t realise the mugger had a gun. I didn’t have my web shooters then and didn’t have any way to get rid of it. Uncle Ben must have been passing by, he came in the alley and the mugger shot him instead. I couldn’t- I didn’t-’
‘Now, Pepper,’ he says, pointing at the list of names and pictures that his AI brings up. ‘Tell me what you see.’
‘I hate to break it to you, Steve, but the man does have to lead when it comes to dancing, and I imagine it’ll be a woman who you end up dancing with at the gala.’ The blond still looks unsure so he adds, ‘Come on just give it a go. You’ll probably be better at it than you think.’
Natasha laughs and ruffles his hair. ‘I’m a spy, kid, I’ve been taught to remember stuff like that remember? Besides,’ he arm comes to rest across his shoulders, ‘of course I’m going to remember when you tell me about something you enjoy or want to do.’
‘Don’t promise me it’ll all be alright, Wanda, you’re not the one who can see the future,’ he tells her.
‘I am,’ the blue eyes turn to face him now, face determined. ‘This- learning Thanos is coming and we’re facing the biggest threat we’ve ever faced, it’s made me think I should be taking all the opportunities I can to be with you, Tony. I don’t care if we don’t do more than sleep in the same bed,’ and there’s that beautiful blush again, ‘I just know I’ll be happier waking up next to you than I will be a couple of rooms away.’
‘Well, you just disappeared in the middle of Europe so we all assumed you’d gotten bored of taking Stark’s money and decided to go make your own in a sex ring or something.’
‘Hear me, and rejoice,’ the cosplayer calls, acting as if he’s a herald in a fantasy film. ‘You are about to die at the hands of the children of Thanos. Be thankful, that your meaningless lives are now i-’
The shock clears from Steve’s face and Captain America slips into place. ‘Do not engage until we get there, this is obviously a trap. We’ll be five minutes behind you tops.’ He watches the soldier heading out of the door calling for FRIDAY to assemble the team as his faceplate comes down. He knows his AI already has his emergency exit open for him and he powers up the suit and heads off.
‘You think he likes me?’ the man’s voice is vulnerable and Tony is a little surprised at the tone. ‘But I’m a fucking mess. He can’t like someone like me. There is absolutely nothing about this freak show that anyone would be interested in.’
Peter and Loki meet some old and new friends whilst Christmas shopping, and Natasha learns why Pepper doesn't let Tony write invitations.
‘Sam, Rhodey? Go get Clint and Scott,’ the two scramble to do as their ordered. ‘Everyone else, get ready. No holds barred. I don’t care if we have to kill every man in that facility to get to Tony, we’re getting him back
‘Lucky you,’ Bucky grumbles from Steve’s side. ‘I think we’re being summoned,’ he nods to where Tony is waving at them.
‘Hey, it looks worse than it is,’ he tries to reassure her with a smile, but she can feel the pain he’s in.
‘We like to call it the Wakandan Accords,’ Nick says with a smile. ‘It’s a similar principle to the Sokovian Accords, but places the team outside of the control of the countries of the world and instead under the leadership of a trio of individuals; certain restrictions will be put in place when it comes to performing missions of course, but it gives the team more freedom than it has now to answer threats.’
Tony’s face is unreadable, if Steve hadn’t known what he did he would assume this was a genuine business deal.
‘Oh come on they’re no worse than Steve and Tony used to be,’ Natasha grins at the two of them as she passes.
‘Only so that we may vanquish our foe together,’ Thor reassures him with a smile. ‘I would hate to miss out on the fun because you have taken victory without me.’
Strange looks over the gathered heroes as Tony and Steve make their way back to join the group. All of the kids are inside, being watched over by Laura and watching everything on the screens provided by FRIDAY. One flag has been set up in the grounds on the obstacle course, the other has been set up inside the facility. Bruce wasn’t given a choice on joining in, Tony pointing out he’d avoided far too many things in the past.
‘If I hadn’t done a background check on Senora Valdez I’d assume she was a spy the way that woman knows things.’
‘I’d rather he stay off the team for now,’ Tony admits, ‘he becomes an Avenger and suddenly all the big players take more of an interest in him. He stays the ‘friendly neighbourhood Spider-Man’ and he only has to deal with the small time people. But he enjoys being here and being with the team. And when the next big thing goes down, and it’s going to at some point, there’s nothing you or I can do to stop him getting involved.’
Bucky is silent again, and Sam knows him well enough to leave alone for now. If he’s quiet he’s thinking of how to answer. So he picks up the sandpaper again with a sigh and gets back to work.
‘No more questions!’ Tony interrupts before anyone else can say anything. ‘We’ve got other things that we need to talk about.’
‘It’s just you’ve only ever known Frigga to be the second in command for Odin and you feel bad asking someone to do it who is not your queen or your heir,’ she finishes for him.
‘Wanda tripped me up so I couldn’t beat Sam in the race,’ Steve explains, still pouting, ‘and Natasha-’
‘If Bruce has done a one eighty on him,’ he cuts across Natasha, ‘then there must be a damn good reason behind it. But we can wait to hear it until he’s stable-’
trying to save people and would get himself hurt. Or worse,’ he has to swallow past the fear that stirs up at this thought. ‘I was scared we weren’t going to get there quick enough and we’d lose him.’
‘Oh no,’ the inventor laughs. ‘He made it very clear in his responses that he has absolutely no interest at all in joining our team.’
‘Bucky and I’ll go lend a hand to the officers getting everyone under control,’ Steve says, lifting his shield as Bucky grabs some non-lethal weapons under his friend’s watchful eye.
! No I am not going to date her, why would you even suggest that? Because she’s going out with Vision is pretty high on that list, and I’ve only met her like a couple of times. Ok seriously this is why I don’t talk to you about girls.’
‘FRIDAY? Get the NYPD to set up a road block and start on citizen evac and I want someone to go after Hammer to make sure that slime ball doesn’t get out.’
‘What do you remember about them?’ Bucky asks. ‘You knew them at a different time to us, it’d be nice to hear about them.’
The journey went surprisingly well; for the most part they were able to follow along the rooftops, and Peter only had to help Deadpool when they reached particularly large gaps between buildings, and the man was more than happy to hang on to the webslinger’s arm as they swung between them.
‘All of the team, we’ve got Tony, Steve and Natasha listed as our next of kin,’ Rhodes explains, ‘in case anything happens.’
‘Well…’ he looks down at his feet, then back up and rubs the back of his head, ‘you know you said we’d need all the help we can get?’
Sam realises Quill has fallen behind and turns around to find out where the space captain has gone. He sees him standing by a small tree, it’s rather sparse and is nothing like the ones they’ve been looking at before. In fact its more like the ones they’ve all simply walked past before.
Rhodes fixes Tony with a look that the genius misses thanks to his closed eyes. ‘Stop avoiding the question, Tony. You’re hiding things again and you know I hate it when you do that.’
‘I’ll start doing a sweep of the grounds and start rounding up any escapees,’ Rhodes says, lowering his face plate and taking off.
‘Try and turn it off for one night, Nat,’ Tony sighs, ‘you deserve this break as much as the rest of us.’
Steve laughs and wraps his arms around Tony’s waist as he settles himself on the soldier’s lap. ‘I won’t tell him if you don’t.’
‘Well, well, well,’ the familiar voice says, ‘I would say I’m surprised, but considering what I’ve been hearing I’m not really. What can I do for you, Stark?’
Tony’s too terrified to even rest his eyes. Not that he’ll ever admit that out loud. After the video call earlier, and Hammer’s threat, he’s too worried to close his eyes in case he loses the opportunity to defend himself against the guards. He just hopes Natasha understands his message and the team finds him soon.
Peter laughs. ‘Are you six again or something?’ Her response is just to stick her tongue out at him.
aren’t ready for, I’ve been thinking so much that it’s all about me I didn’t even stop to think what
Tony can’t stop the small smile that spreads across his face. He’s proud of the kid and how much he’s come through. ‘It’s difficult
‘We’re sure glad you’re safe too, Hulk,’ Rhodes agrees. ‘Now how about we go see if Tony needs help?’
‘You always did the same thing to me,’ Bruce points out from his place at the coffee table. Tony just sticks his tongue out at him.
Tony can see the moment Loki catches sight of the alien they’d just defeated, because he desperately tries to keep any emotion from showing on his face. Then the trickster turns, snarling, to the barely breathing alien at their feet. ‘Where is the fourth?’
The doctor sighs. ‘Alright Mr Stark, you’ve got the go ahead. But don’t be out for longer than four hours
‘Please,’ Peter’s shocked at the plea falling from the man’s mouth. Tony pauses, looking down at him and then, squaring his shoulders and setting his expression, looks back up at the soldier holding him. ‘Leave him here. I’ll come with you. No fight. Just leave the kid.’
back where they could keep an eye on them and where I wasn’t potentially going to put you guys at risk? Come on-’
I hope you've been enjoying it so far. Let me know what you think and if there's anything you want to see in the future.
‘Spidey-’ whatever he was going to say is cut off as Peter manages to get his mask over his mouth before throwing up further down the corridor, gripping a doorframe to keep his balance. He hears the merc curse behind him.
The man is standing in a fighter’s stance, ready to fight back should Peter get closer. ‘Why didn’t you tell them?’ he asks.
‘And you will have the army of Jotunheim,’ Loki says as he enters, he turns to Lorena. ‘Take the Space stone,’ he pulls it from whatever pocket of reality he has been hiding it in and hands it to her, ‘return to Jotunheim and bring as many of the army as can be spared. Ensure enough stay behind to defend the realm should the need arise. Go quickly, Lorena, and stay safe.’
Rhodes laughs in agreement. ‘I hear you there. But after the fight with Thanos, after nearly losing Tony and Wade and Vision, it’s just nice to see everyone together.’
Deciding not to take any risks, he grabs the handgun from down the side of the sofa cushion, slips his mask over his head and heads to the door. ‘Who is it?’
‘Seriously?’ Peter demands. ‘I gave you that reason when I first met you and you completely ignored me, why shouldn’t I do the same to you now?’
‘You got that right,’ Natasha says. ‘Now give the kid a hot chocolate, Sam, otherwise you’ll never hear the end of it.’
‘About bloody time!’ Peter turns at the sound of Tony’s shout and suddenly remembers everyone else in the room.
‘I shall see you upstairs for sustenance,’ the blond says, laying a large hand on his shoulder as he stands and leaves the room. Loki tries not to think too much about their conversation as he prepares himself for the day, but a small part of him feels something dangerously like contentment as he runs the water in the shower and tests the temperature.
The trickster doesn’t reply, instead walking over to Tony and starting up a conversation with him and T’Challa. Bucky tries to squash the glimmer of hope that has sparked in his chest, but fails miserably.
, Tony.’ Steve lowers his head close to Tony’s, resting their foreheads together, so all he can see is Steve. ‘We got a life to start remember? Don’t leave me now, love,
‘So awesome,’ MJ finishes for her. ‘Man, I wish I had regenerative powers like that, it would be so cool. Have you ever left parts of you around to make a fake murder scene to see how long you can string the cops along for?’
‘Because they said where they were being held was like an old castle dungeon or something,’ Steve answers, ‘and this farmhouse is your normal, everyday farmhouse. I very much doubt they’ve got dungeons down underneath it, not from the description Loki, Bucky and Wanda gave anyway.’
‘We really do need to stop taking on entire armies when it’s just us,’ he points out, taking to the skies once again. ‘Anyone seen Thor?’
‘We shall deal with the leader,’ Strange replies, ‘as he is going to be focussed on the stone. You deal with his bodyguard.’
A shout goes up from the direction of the pool table and Wade looks over with a frown; sounds like the newcomer was making a name for themselves. He’s certainly surprised to see one of the more lecherous members of Sister Margaret’s pinned up against the wall, but can’t see the person pinning them because of the crowd of chanting mercs.
‘And ever since Bucky has not been allowed to pick me up from school so that he doesn’t maim my classmates,’ Peter rolls his eyes.
‘If we get a few of them down I’ll be able to borrow some of their guns and be a little more useful,’ Clint tells him, before ducking down between the tables and making his way around.
‘What does he think I’m doing when I watch him and Rhodey box? I seriously hope he doesn’t think I’m staring at
‘Because I might understand what it’s like for things to not work out like you intended.’ It’s not the words that stop him shooting the web and swinging off.
It had been Natasha who had taken him for that first training session, spiriting him away before Steve could notice they’d gone and gently putting him through his paces, only increasing the intensity once she was happy he was comfortable at their current level. He still hasn’t thanked her properly. When the Wakandan Accords get agreed, and he has no doubt that Tony will find a way to get them agreed no matter what obstacles people put in his way, Bucky knows that Tony, Steve, Natasha and Fury were going to make one hell of a leadership team. Fury as, in Tony’s words, ‘the ultimate super spy leader’, Steve as combat leader, Tony as their head of all things remotely science related, and Natasha in charge of training. They’d agreed Nat’s role in the week they’d joined Peter on his patrols.
‘That’s not my information to give,’ he replies to his friend. ‘Now what can I do for you, Peter? Not that I’m promising I
‘I hacked into the old Iron Man files,’ Peter grins, ‘and I’ve got Tony’s Mark II video to show you when he first did the rocket boots. He goes straight into the ceiling!’
‘Oh god who thought it was a good idea to get Nick drunk?’ Tony groans, he looks to Wanda when she returns to her seat. ‘How close is Fury to being out?’
‘You are impossible,’ Steve laughs, but gently helps Tony shift over so there’s enough space for him to sit next to him. When they’re settled he pulls Tony against his chest and watches as he opens up one of his smaller projects and starts working on it.
He gets distracted by Sam moving towards the back of the labs to take a phone call, his sensitive hearing picking up the words unintentionally.
‘You seem to have been doing a lot of that recently,’ Natasha raises an eyebrow at him, ‘keeping stuff to yourself until a certain point so we can deny all knowledge and stay out of prison.’
Just then Wanda enters and raises an eyebrow at the grin on Tony’s face, and the three chuckling soldiers. ‘Do I want to know?’
are on the team. It’s not just you encouraging them, Baby Boy, and they’ve got the best people around to keep an eye on them when they decide if they
‘I did an assignment in a choir once,’ she shrugs in answer when the carol is over and the residents start clapping. He knows he really shouldn’t ask, but he’s definitely going to later tonight.
Tony sighs and looks away. ‘Yeah I do, but even I wasn’t expecting him to go off the map like he did.’
Vision doesn’t often find reason to enter the training room unless it’s to help Wanda experiment with some new variation of control of her powers. The main issue is, other than Wanda, there isn’t really anyone that he can safely train with that will test his own abilities. He supposes, if Thor had remained on Earth then he would have trained more with the Asgardian, but as it is he tends to stay away from the room and only takes part in larger group training sessions.
Tony’s side. Peter blinked a few more times, wriggled his fingers, his eyebrows furrowed in fear as he looked at his dads.
“You keep calling me and hanging up.” Tony witnesses first hand Steve turn a colour of red he had never seen, his cheeks fill and then burn right down to his neck, deep below the collar of his shirt. Tony desperately wants to know how far down that blush goes.
Tony doesn’t hear Natasha enter the room, but that’s not surprising because it’s Natasha. When he does notice he jumps out of the air and burns himself with his blow torch.
“It means that Peter might not be able to walk again.” Natasha tells him gently, suddenly behind him, her hands on his shoulders. Steve almost cries, he almost does but Tony beats him to it and before he can register his own emotions Tony’s body has collapsed onto Steve’s and there is a strangled sob coming from his throat as Steve pulls him tightly to his chest.
“Tony!” Pepper had called as he kept running, skidding to a halt and barely missing an old lady and her walker. He turned on his heel and ran back.
He stays standing while  Sharon slides into the booth and then slides in across from her, despite her efforts to get him to share her side.
These apologies meant little to Peter, he had never been one to hold a grudge and it wasn’t surprising when Peter had apologised for ruining Harry’s chance of football that year.
Steve was a good guy and it really wasn’t Clint’s fault that he kept doing these favors for people. It also wasn’t his fault that Coulson had a huge boy-crush on Captain America and said yes to anything that was asked. In fact, if you thought about it really hard he was actually doing a good thing. Using Steve- well not using…more utilizing the gifts Steve offered- to get these things was making the team happy, right? And a happy team meant that there was less fighting and angst, which meant less community service hours for breaking monuments or saying things that really shouldn’t be said on live T.V because they were all fighting. So really, Clint was making Coulson’s job easier than harder and when Fury came back from his holiday he would stop.
“Alcoholism, crippling self-centeredness, constant neglect?” he supplied, wishing she would make true on her word and leave him alone. Pepper sighed, her hand reaching across the table to take his own.
“And what evil has brought you pain! In the name of Asgard I Thor from the house of Odin shall not rest until you are Avenged!” Peter had stumbled over a laugh then and reached his small arms up, begging to be lifted. Thor, feeling a flutter in his heart, obliged, picking up the young boy who nuzzled his neck.
saved your life I’d say I deserve them.” Steve walks further in, leans on the counter next to Tony and eyes the two pop tarts.
“Nah not really. We had to tell him he wasn’t allowed to fly around anymore after he knocked the needle off the Empire State Building.”
“I’m sorry darling, go wash up ok?” Steve stood nodding, he dragged his feet to his room, his heart aching as he took the butterscotch and threw it in the trash.
“I see…excuse me.” Peter breathes before wheeling himself to his room, fighting tears the entire time and ignoring the loud music coming from his dad’s workshop. Peter wheels past his room, down the hall, past the bathroom, past the computer lab and finally to a large metal door of the gym. Inside he can hear his pop working hard, breaking things, grunting, and the split of each punching bag as he goes. Knocking Peter hears his pop give a short sigh, mutter a few curse words of the 40’s and then open the door.
All that's left is to say another huge thank you and I hope you all have a wonderful week. Love to you all!
‘Alright, alright,’ he cocks his head to the side and puts his hands on his hips. ‘What if I gave you a potential out if you’re ever caught without your mask again?’
Steve does his best to look interested in what the girl is saying, but his eyes keep being drawn to Peter and Tony, and Bucky’s fidgeting at his side; Tony, he notices, is listening with rapt interest and applauds enthusiastically when the girl is finished. There’s some opportunity for questions at the end, and Steve has to bite back the smile at his partner obviously trying to hold back the urge to either ask a question or make a comment. There’s a boy that gives a presentation afterwards, and Steve has no idea what it was about if he’s honest.
‘They’ve been attacked,’ he says, his hands curling into fists at his side. ‘Get us landed as quick as you can, Nat. Rhodey? Go on down and scan for them.’
The hum of the reactor fills his ear as Tony’s arms fold him into the inventor’s chest. On his other side the couch dips from Steve’s weight and a hand rubs soothingly up and down his back.
‘Don’t worry Bucky I’ll be glad to give you some tips,’ Rhodes laughs, catching the cushion Bucky throws at him and launching it back at the dark haired man.
‘You see my brother is not one to form attachments to people, it is quite honestly a miracle he has stayed here for as long as he has and I assume it is because of you. Or primarily because of you, I believe the rest of the team also has a part to play. Regardless I just wished to ask you not to enter into any stronger form of relationship with my brother if your intentions are not honourable, and if you do and you should hurt him there is not a corner of the galaxy you can go to that I will not find you in and tear you apart with my bare hands. Ah there’s Steven! I think they have found some trees. Come!’
Peter, always eager to please his mentor, takes a huge forkful off his plate and shoves it into his mouth. His eyes light up and he gives everyone a thumbs up. ‘It’s good,’ he manages to get out around a mouthful of spaghetti.
"Steve? Dear God! Get off of there before you drop to your death or something!" Tony yelled from behind them. Both men turned to see Tony standing there standing at Steve, pale in the face and eyes wide. Steve chuckled.
"I guess. Thanks for the talk cap." Clint walked out and left Steve sitting there contemplating his words. All he had to do was wait.
“I wanted too, to say something.” Steve makes the distance between them just that little bit smaller, Tony can smell him now, sweat and deodorant and something that’s just inherently Steve.
“Okay.” Steve choked out behind him, Tony threw him a look over his shoulder, certain that Steve’s eyes had flicked up from his arse, the thought made him take a quick detour in the bathroom before going back to work.
“My brother who is part Frost Giant. He is small for his kind but filled with power. You will meet him I predict.”
“It’s Steve.” He expected a gasp, maybe a head shake, even a ‘what the fuck’, but Pepper just gave him a soft knowing smile. “You don’t look surprised.”
“Nothing, just needed some air.” It’s a lie, Tony doesn’t know how he knows but he does. This isn’t the Steve who he gets all to himself in the mornings, it’s not the Steve who smiles when Tony brings him a new punching bag that ‘100% won’t break, try it, go ahead’ and then laughs when he smashes it to pieces. This Steve is quiet, reserved, his eyes full with answers Tony wishes he knew the questions for.
that must mean something.” Steve felt hot tears slide down his face, Pepper’s hand came up and lightly brushed one away.
“He moved the spot you know, they aren’t under the sink anymore. He put them in the casserole dish. He knows how much you hate casseroles.” Thor frowned at this.
Steve can’t help the laugh that bubbles through his lips, leaning his forehead against Tony’s when he feels the man’s chest shake in response.
"I'm assuming you're not here for a social visit." Clint nods as he chews on a black jellybean- that was definitely a bad choice on his behalf. Coulson sits there patiently, one eyebrow raised as Clint struggles to finish the black jellybean and wonders if he can casually spit it out. Probably not, Coulson didn't miss much.
He had been bowling on the Wii, bored out of his brains as he waited for Natasha to come home with dinner. It turns out that as great as Stark Tower was it wasn’t baby proof so someone had to stay home with the eleven-month-old Peter who refused to do anything but roll around on his stomach.
‘I’ve…’ Bruce sounds like he’s out of breath. ‘I’ve got the last one. But…it’s…it’s trying to make me…trying to make Hulk…ah!’
Peter laughs and introduces Wanda to the barman. ‘You often let underage people in here?’ she asks him.
Wade sighs. ‘I lost Vanessa, if I lost Peter in the same way it’d…it’d break me.’ At Tony’s questioning eyebrow Wade briefly tells him the story of Vanessa, from leaving her to sign up to the Weapon-X programme, to finding her again and her death just as they decide to start a family.
Tony sighs. ‘Kid you can’t save everyone all the time.  Sometimes you have to put your own survival first.’
‘Don’t suppose you have any of those suits from Norway on you, do you?’ Steve shouts over the rush of the wind.
‘Sorry,’ Peter grins sheepishly at his other friends. ‘Guys this is Harry, we were friends when we were growing up. We kind of lost touch when his family moved away. Harry this is Ned, MJ and Betty.’
of arguments over it,’ he rolls his eyes, ‘but since me and Steve are on the same page he’s realised he’s not winning this. Plus I threatened to get Natasha last night and he shut up straight away.’
That wasn’t good enough for Tony I-will-not-recognise-the-massive-crush-I-have-on-Captain-America Stark.
“My ma and I went to a fancy party like this once…well not exactly like this.” Tony met Steve’s eyes, smiling.
“So you’re using Cap to trick Coulson?” Tony did not look impressed. How on earth was Tony Stark- the man who did what ever the hell he wanted regardless of what people said, not even a little impressed?
“I…” the words wouldn’t come, the anxiety in his chest rose into his throat, choking him up, his mouth going dry.
“Never better” he breathes, and really means it. He would fall 20 floors everyday if Steve would get this close to him. Despite the long fight Steve has barely broken a sweat, his eyes are still alive with adrenalin and as the worry dissipates their natural sparkle return, his hair is sticking up at all angles from his cowl, and there’s the smallest smile on his lips. Tony considers passing out again so Steve will give him CPR.
So Clint may or may not have mentioned in passing that Puppy purses were really popular these days and would be great for the team. Steve may or may not have gone to Coulson and asked for an order of six puppy purses.
“You’re falling from the sky at least once a week. Cap’s the only one that gets his knickers in a knot.” Clint snorts and Tony smirks at Steve who’s blushing a bright red.
Harry had been with Peter every step so far. His first day at rehabilitation, pushing him, telling him not to give up.
“You don’t owe me any explanations.” Steve knows he’s wrong, Tony is the one person he owes everything too. Tony who gave him a home, Tony who made him ridiculous punching bags that flew and spined and flipped through the room. Tony who made his heart warm after so many years in ice.
The restaurant is small, tucked away behind a back alley next to an organic juice place, but the inside is beautiful. Wooden floors and white walls with intricate paintings hung up, there are carvings and small statues, and the entire room smells of spices Steve had never imagined trying as a young boy.
"Want to talk about it?" Clint looked up from his lap to meet Steve's blue worried eyes. God he was a bastard for playing Captain America like this.
Everything really fell into place on it’s own. Clint made his way through S.H.I.E.L.D headquarters and was about to knock on Phil’s door when he noticed the slight crack. Peering in he had stifled his half gasp half laugh as he saw Phil Coulson standing on his desk with a stapler on one hand and a make-shift cardboard S.H.I.E.L.D in the other, dressed as Captain America.
“Holy shit! Shit fuck fuck shit shit! Oh my God! Shit, Just…wait…just stop big guy. Oh God your dads are going to flip that they missed this. Shit shit shit!” he had chorused over and over as Peter giggled and continued to walk behind him.
“Stevie?” His mother called from the kitchen, he walked in forgetting the sting of his hands and knees as his heart swelled in his chest.
Steve shows up at her door at 7pm sharp with flowers she takes gleefully, giving him a small peck on the cheek with lips that are too soft. They walk to the restaurant with her hand on his arm, her perfume is sickly sweet and Steve is grateful for the fresh air that washes it away before it can linger too long in his nostrils.
“I should…” he goes to move, tries to step as far to the side as possible to avoid brushing up against Tony.
‘Won’t know if you don’t try,’ Tony says, raising his glass for the other man to meet. ‘What’s eating you, Barnes?’
‘He’s not hurting anyone,’ Steve says from behind him. ‘He’s already hurt Scott and that’s one person too many. We’ll track him down, we’ll track down Hydra and we’ll shut them down once and for all.’
‘Right, yeah,’ Peter looks down at his own food, forcing himself to eat it even though he doesn’t have much of an appetite any more.
‘I’m not even going to ask how you know that,’ Deadpool shakes his head. ‘Look here’s a suggestion. How about me and the walking Hallowe’en costume go take out the convoy while you lot go in and get Tin Can. We’ll head back here and help you clean up once the convoy’s dealt with. You alright with that Red?’
‘Just do it!’ he snaps, turning and impaling an attacker on the ice he forms on his limb, allowing his Jotun visage to fall back into place.
‘Oh you’re in trouble alright. Starting with how Loki knew before I did, and ending with how many other people know?’ Natasha frowns again.
‘Should I say anything?’ he questions, he’s used to avoiding these kinds of situations. He’s always stuck to his path in the future, and it sounds like that’s not what is needed in this room.
‘So what was that earlier?’ Wanda teases. Tony has to block out their bickering as the military man gets the ball closer to his goal. Just as he looks up to make the shot, Tony notices something over the other man’s shoulder and grins.
The man frowns. ‘If you hadn’t lost him in the first place he wouldn’t have had a choice in the matter.’
‘There’s also some additional energy coming from the Mind Stone,’ Bruce adds, a mirror to Peter on the other side of Bruce and Steve is struck by how much it looks like Tony and Bruce in the middle of a solving a problem. ‘It’s as if the stone is trying to help him heal but it can’t combat the power from the staff. Wanda’s magic is the only thing able to help at all, but even then she’s struggling to get it to heal fully.’
A middle-aged man walks out of the back room that Steve had seen earlier, a group of teenagers following behind him, and Steve finally spots Peter, looking like he wants to run as fast as his enhanced muscles will let him.
‘Of course, Captain, sir,’ FRIDAY’s voice comes through the speakers, making everyone jump, ‘I’m happy to help any of you with any questions you may have, but I must repeat the Captain’s request for you not to go outside of limits unless accompanied by a member of the facility staff. Oh, and Peter? Boss has asked me to remind you that you are not excused from your lab work this afternoon.’
They fall asleep in the gym, Steve resting against the doorframe, holding Peter, soothing him with gentle whispers, stroking his forehead, rocking him back and forth like a child with a stomach ache. Both ignore the music blasting from the stereo and what it means, instead they pretend it’s the past, that Tony is fixing the iron man suit and both are waiting for him to come and jump on top of them, covered in grease and oil.
So Tony stayed away, he worked at home, fixed the house, visited Peter when he could, brought changes of clothes, better food, TV, Peter’s gadgets and left during any appointment. Not bearing to see his son in that anguish, not being able to live with himself because Tony Stark was Tony Stark, and like the fool he was he blamed himself.
“In Asgard being small is not a bad thing. For even my brother Loki is small but one of the most powerful.”
“Thanks.” Steve shifted as Tony strolled over, leaned his back on the balcony and looked Steve up and down.
“Were you worried about me cap?” he teased, taking another step forward. Steve doesn’t make to move towards him, he doesn’t make to leave either.
Bruce had decided that a day out would be good for Peter, so a day out it was. The two had gone to central park, fed the ducks, people watched.
“I don’t understand what that means…” Steve says, his eyebrows still furrowed as Tony leans into him. Everyone in the room looks at him sadly, seeming to understand the strange medical talk.
