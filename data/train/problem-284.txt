John froze. "Sherlock..." he tried to warn but the word came out breathy and unsteady.
Tears prickle at the corners of his eyes but he blinks them back, instead coaxing soapy water all along John's blonde hair, running soothing circles with the tips of his fingers all along each follicle and tenderly rubbing the base of John's neck with careful movements. He doesn't trust that John doesn't have a head injury. He saw that fall. It was hard and it was ugly and if John didn't hit his head on the cold, wet ground then it would be a fucking miracle but still Sherlock prods gently and discreetly along John's skull, biting down on his lip to keep the throb of painful worry at bay, doing his best to take care of his love and ignore his own emotion threatening to swallow him whole.
Sherlock gave him a halfhearted glare, although his heart soared at those words. This was exactly what he'd wanted. For his mother and his family to become John's. For John to have parents in his life that cared for him.
John knows and Sherlock is sure.
John continued after catching himself. "Sorry, that's not... okay you're right. You told me that last night. Just a bit... disappointing, I suppose."
He could be out at a club have a messy snog with some unseen stranger.
Lestrade frowns. "What are you doing here? Isn't John still-"
"We… we really should get up," John tries again with increasing difficulty as the boy beneath him gets bolder, a wet tongue sneaking out to lave against the tendons in John's neck, licking and sucking ever so lightly, experimenting expertly and driving John absolutely mad. "
John's body temperature skyrocketed as he took in this gorgeous human being he had absolutely no business being interested in the way he was. Average at best, John bit down hard on his lip and stood a little straighter.
"Billy," Sherlock called quietly, making his way to his injured friend.
that walks by him. And it's not a stupid, unpleasant, gullible smile either. It's more like someone with all the confidence in the world. More like someone willing and open to any and all people, while simultaneously protecting himself, guarding his true character. To the untrained eye, John Watson is a good boy, a star athlete, a mate of all the guys, a date of all the girls. To the trained, astute observer, John is putting on a show. He's friendly but not open. Kind but not trusting. Caring but not forthcoming.
"-and I couldn't do it anymore, love. I couldn't just let you do that. I couldn't let anyone else have you, they wouldn't take care of you like I would, Sherlock, they wouldn't treat you like you deserve and my god, imagining you with anyone else was
"I'm sorry," John says after a long bout of silence.
And Sherlock
John's eyes were dancing again. Which was odd seeing as he hadn't danced at all tonight. Because Sherlock hadn't been there. And he wanted to dance with Sherlock.
Sherlock's eyes immediately snapped to John's mischievous grin. "Real nice, John," Sherlock glared. "You're just going to tease me now?"
To his surprise, Sherlock was already standing facing the door, balancing on the balls of his feet as though ready to pounce. It wouldn't have thrown John off so much if the stance wasn't topped with a look John had never seen on Sherlock's face before. An angry look.
"Hello my mysterious flatmate," John sang as he entered the kitchen, dropping his bag unceremoniously on the counter. "And how are we today?"
He hadn't even thought of that.
He jerked back and stared into John's wanting, trusting blue eyes and turned away, internally cursing and slapping himself.
He can practically hear John's eyebrows raise themselves in disbelief. "Oh, yeah?" John's question, dripping with sarcasm, hangs in the air as Sherlock nods to the ground. "Work that takes up every waking moment of the day and into the late hours of the night? On the first week of uni? You've must got some tough professors."
"No, don't say that," John whispers brokenly, his words rasping on a sob. "Don't be sorry. I…
John shook his head. "I'm not in-e-ine-braided."
he's in for it as his gaze travel back up to meet cobalt eyes, accented beautifully by the rich navy in the jumper, seeming deeper and darker and heavy, sitting just beneath soft blonde fringe that falls across his forehead and wings out to the right in that unique, messy but completed John Watson way.
Shit.
"It was an accident," Sherlock mutters off to the side, although that particular experiment had worked rather well. He'd been partnered with Sally Donovan and needed a way to scare her off, her snide, rude comments doing nothing for his concentration or mood. In his opinion, things went off without a hitch. He wasn't the one who had to deal with the fire department showing up, so-
Maybe…
Sherlock frowns. "How does what feel?"
And later, he'll curl around Sherlock in their bed, drop soft kisses to his forehead and stroke his naked back. He'll murmur apologies about his jealous behavior and whisper tenderly about how he'll do better and Sherlock will scoff and tell him he has nothing to apologize for. He'll stay awake far longer into the evening as Sherlock drifts off to sleep, watching his lover rest peacefully beside him.
"Just wait," Sherlock whispers against his lover's skin, John's words fueling his plan yet again. "I'm not done with you yet."
And yet, he still has the wherewithal to give his teammate hell.
And then he laughs.
Mycroft gave a resigned sigh and slid into a chair at the table.
Christ, this couldn't be real. How had John gotten lucky enough to get to have Sherlock like this? Sherlock with his unbelievably sensual lips and tousled, wild curls. Sherlock with his sharp angles and long limbs. Sherlock who was absolutely a pretty boy but with such a depth to him that most people didn't fully understand, his intelligence going almost unnoticed. Sherlock with his sharp tongue but soft eyes, gazing up at John, simply watching and waiting with baited breath.
At first glance, John Watson is everyone's man. John Watson is for public consumption. John Watson belongs to the team and the school and the crowd and the world.
And even to Sherlock's ears it sounds like a challenge. Like someone is accusing John of
John reached up and tucked an errant curl behind Sherlock's ear. "I love you, Sherlock," he whispered, resisting the urge to grab at the tall boy and bring him down.
He tossed a glare at Harry and then stormed to the door, yanking it open.
John nodded. "I'm planning on being a doctor, so this will be a good test to see how well I'll be able to stomach a bit of blood."
"I wouldn't be so sure," Victor croons evilly, and Sherlock can hear the smirk in his tone. "I think you might be back sooner than you think. Because I can promise you one thing, Sherlock; John Watson will
"You mean my flat," Sherlock corrects softly. John doesn't live here. He crashes here on when he's in town and has a key but he doesn't live here. He doesn't occupy a space of his own here. As much as Sherlock wishes he did.
"I'll be right there," Sherlock said into his mobile.
Sherlock groans, wriggling his hips in an attempt to get John to continue.
And Sherlock finds himself wishing John had just gone ahead and socked him right in the jaw that first day he'd laid eyes on him standing in the doorway of their room. It would have been preferable, just shatter the illusion day one than experience the devastating realization that none of it was real at all, that there was no true friendship, no compatibility, no endless possibilities like Sherlock had foolishly let himself believe.
"We're friends."
. Even as Sherlock's chest is seizing with panic that his deepest secret could be revealed with the insinuation of this trip, he still finds himself oddly calmed, his insides soothed by his flatmate's ease.
Charles' face had gone bright red; he'd mumbled 'never mind' and hurried off.
"Oh god, there's more than one?"
Which is
"You'll always be there," Sherlock murmured. "You'll be with me at all times, so you have nothing to worry about. My sidekick, if you will," he grinned and John giggled softly.
The urge to grab him by the hips and press him against the wall slams into John like a tackle on the rugby field and he has to close his eyes for a long moment, fingers clenching around the jeans he's holding to focus on the task at hand which is to get out the door and not back into bed.
So Sherlock denied his infatuation for an entire year and pretended he wasn't lusting like some pathetic tween and pretended not to be utterly torn apart when a pretty girl batted her eyelashes at the blond boy.
John is here.
It'll be permanent.
It's all he can do not to scoot forward and bury himself in his John.
A soft pink dusts Sherlock's sharp cheekbones and he dips his head a bit shyly like he doesn't know how to take the attention first thing in the early hours of the day. "Good morning," he murmurs back, though John can see his lips curve into an indulgent smile.
This is a big night for Sherlock.
, then tonight might feel slightly, maybe, potentially… like a date.
John yawns into curls and grins. "
And before Sherlock can even attempt at an answer, John is tugging those tight jeans down Sherlock’s long legs and then his tongue is swirling around the crown of Sherlock’s cock, teasing him by licking down his length now and John knows he’s only expecting a blow job at this point so he is quite delighted at Sherlock’s gasp of surprise when he turns him to face the wall and nudges his legs further apart, giving him better access so he can really reduce Sherlock to
"Do not," John growls, giving Sherlock a shove to lay down, "apologize. I want you to fuck my mouth, Sherlock Holmes."
"John?" Sherlock says hesitantly.
It may have been blunt, but Sherlock has never denied that as his forte.
Seeing his face and hearing his voice and not being John at all.
"Pretty much," Irene shrugs. She glances over her shoulder and out into the main room, eyeing the rest of the patrons at the party before turning back. "Look, Sherlock isn't going to watch out for himself. He doesn't realize what he's getting into with Victor. He needs us but he can't know what we're doing. Make sense?"
"Because it's not right. Do you get credit for any of the work you do?"
A sound of movement.
It's been 5 days, 23 hours and just about 23 minutes since John Watson first kissed Sherlock Holmes in the privacy of their bedroom, away from prying eyes, hidden behind the four walls of their dorm, no one watching, no one judging, no one
Lestrade grinned. "Oh, you'll see."
with him. He's also attended a few parties and a couple rugby games with said rugby player while being fully out and proud and couple-ish during all of these events.
They fall into the backseat when Sherlock finally manages to pull it open, laughter calming in favor of heady kisses and low moans. It's cramped and sweaty and bloody exciting and Sherlock's fingers are abruptly on the button of John's jeans. "Can I?" he breathes, more than ready for this. He'd done his research. He knows what to do.
John blinked at the sincerity in his voice. "It's alright," he responded softly, trying not to focus all his thoughts on where Sherlock's fingers connected with his body.
roommate of yours-"
And Christ, all John wants is to do it again.
Sherlock does not watch rugby practice.
He's funny and caring. He's constantly cheerful and grinning from ear to ear. He actually listens and replies intelligently and is bloody perfect.
"Are you alright?" John's eyes widen as they finally meet Sherlock's, noting the red-rims and the tear tracks.
What had been most fascinating was when Sherlock had turned his attention to Mike, John's pulse had begun pounding. Could have been due to fear for his friend but he hadn't even looked at Mike. He hadn't moved an inch. So it was panic that the attention was no longer on him. Worry that he wasn't Sherlock's priority any more.
John nodded. "Yes, all of one time. But it's clear you're here for the obligatory big brother 'break his heart and I'll break your face' speech. Am I right?"
"Don't care," John murmured, dropping his hands to Sherlock's belt.
"I know just - good Lord," Paul laughs humorlessly, running an anxious hand through his hair. "I knew this was coming, I don't know why I'm so jumpy."
A burst of laughter falls from John's lips and he grins at his teammate, finally landing on the same page, realizing exactly what they're talking about and exactly how much they have in common. "My god, you're telling me," John agrees with a shake of his head. "What is it with them?"
Sherlock was propped up on his elbows, watching John's every move, eyes wide and dark as he eyed the cock about to enter him. He licked his lips and pressed his hips upward as far as he could, silently asking for it.
Sherlock is sitting on one of the log benches next to Jackson Evans, who seems to be scooting closer with every breath John seethes through his nose. Jackson turns his head to murmur something and Sherlock, to John's horror, laughs. He throws his head back, curls bouncing with the motion, and really and truly laughs.
"You taste divine," Sherlock muttered below him, licking the head of John's cock gently before closing his lips are it and suckling, humming contentedly. "God, I've wanted to do this to you for ages."
Sherlock nodded. "My whole life."
"What! Come on, you've got to have learned
He wasn't about to spill the beans on that little secret though.
"So," John says a bit too casually and Sherlock wonders if he also noticed the touch or just Sherlock's reaction to it. "What did you think?"
One day, the name Sherlock Holmes would be known.
John nodded, although he really didn't understand at all. The friends with benefits thing did not sound appealing in the least to him now. Not after experiencing what sex with someone you care about was like. He and Sherlock had repeated their kitchen table episode several times in the past few weeks and it only got better. Why anyone would want to take out the feelings and just have straight sex with someone was beyond John's comprehension.
The resounding laugh of his mother is joined by a snort and a sarcastic
"John," Sherlock breathed against his cheek. "It's fine. I'm fine."
They'd been friends.
But Sherlock was already out the door to the main room, still topless.
He can't live with this person. He can't be anywhere
"Okay," Sherlock murmurs back because really he has absolutely no interest in stopping anything that's going on, pleasure rolling slowly around his belly as John takes his time to kiss him thoroughly, rough fingertips gliding down his back and over his hips, trailing along his sides and forcing a shiver to race down his spine.
"Alright," he replies softly. "Is…is everything okay, Molls?"
Just barely managing to avoid a sound of disgust, Sherlock slumps back on the couch and glares at the two blue-swathed sisters, according to the song anyway, just as they close the number with flurries of their feather fans and obnoxious smiles at their suitors in the audience.
It twists something up in Sherlock's gut, tearing him in two between being grateful for his flatmate's ignorance of the situation and desperately wishing it wasn't this big awful secret, that it was okay for him to feel this way, that he wasn't alone in this miserable swirl of emotion, that maybe, just
"We'll go slow," John promises.
He took the stairs two at a time.
"Oh please, I don't need
Sherlock's breath stutters, nipples tightening on either side of John's lips. "S-sorry," he murmurs. "I didn't want to… I mean I've never… I didn't want to…end it too soon when you first…touched me."
Absolutely not.
"Sherlock," John said sternly. He was fucking shaking in Sherlock's arms. How could this genius not know? "I'm in love with you. Please tell me you knew that."
In all honesty, Sherlock had sort of assumed this is exactly how his boyfriend would handle being injured: ignore it, deny it, claim all is well until his dying breath the stubborn arse that he is, and Sherlock bloody well knew it didn't he, why he thought for even a moment John would allow himself to be managed and cared for and babied a little now completely beyond him as they stand staring at each other having a silent face-off, glaring the other down, waiting to make the first move.
The nicest thing about living with your rugby co-captain and best friend was things like this. Having lived together for the entirety of their uni careers, Greg had essentially become like John's brother, doing almost everything together with ease, having most things in common – rugby, difficult majors, bisexuality, popularity. Greg was about as good at relationships as John was, opting for the more laid-back attitude, never finding anyone he'd quite fancied enough to stick with for a while, but always up for a party.
"No," Sherlock mumbles with an eye roll. Pining? Yeah, right. "We're just fr- roommates."
And then a long-fingered hand is closing around John's erection through his boxer shorts and a strangled, startled cry is bursting from his mouth. "Oh!" John gasps, hips rocking into the touch at their own accord. "O-oh
As two women appear on the screen in blue, sparkling dresses, singing about the fact that they are sisters – how utterly dull – Sherlock notes John shifting slightly in his seat, and he turns his head to see John's mouth hanging open slightly and leaning forward a bit, eyes locked on the screen as though he'd never seen it before, although it was very clear that he had multiple times. Glancing back to the screen, Sherlock tries to determine what has caught John's attention so profoundly.
? John's driving Sherlock positively
What he used to do best.
Then, to his surprise and shock, John visibly relaxed and his lips quirked into an amused grin.
Laughter slowly waning, Greg shakes his head. "No, you wouldn't. We're a team, John. We're all here for each other."
Pulling free the towel, letting it fall to the floor, Sherlock ran his eyes all over John's form, taking in every muscled line and protruding vein, fingers grazing over John's overly sensitive skin.
The next broken cry came from Sherlock's lips against John's, his heart swelling with so much love for the man beneath him it ached, having not realized how much he truly missed his John until this very moment, thrusting his hips into John with more purpose, body desperate to get as close as possible. "John," he breathed, body pulling taut as he stroked in and out of his partner, grasping at him to get closer. John clung to him, holding on as they rocked with each other, bodies touching at every point they could manage, neither one of them barreling to orgasm but just this. Just needing this. Needing to be connected. Needing to know the other was there. Forever. No more waiting. No more fighting against their needs to be together. No more games. Just this.
Mobile phone practically becoming one with John's hand as it's been clutched in his digits for almost nine hours and has since laid absolutely silent, it's definitely not fucking
Giggling like two schoolboys, John can see the tension easing from Sherlock's body with the promise of what this will do to his brother if he goes. His face is soft and excited, still smiling as the laughter slowly fades.
It was a question burning in the back of Sherlock's mind. Along with so many others.
Irene's eyebrows shoot up and Sherlock wonders if they could reach her hair if it weren't still pulled snuggly back from practice. "Have you
There he was and John knew Sherlock couldn't be far.
"Sleep, John." That voice sounded so far away and John tried to shake his head.
He can't help making Sherlock squirm just a little longer.
Fighting back to gain the upper-hand again, seeing as he would be the one teaching this lesson John was requesting, Sherlock grinned and slid a hand over John's thigh, just as they were pulling up to Sherlock's flat.
things to Sherlock.
John's thumb and forefinger close over each of Sherlock's nipples and pull just enough to drag a moan from Sherlock's lips. "John," he gasps, eyelids fluttering under the touch.
"Well, you were right."
"Yeeees," Mike mimicked, laughing. "Come on. You can't pick up anyone in the state you're in anyway, either of you. We'll go to the club tomorrow."
"You sure you're okay?" Victor is eyeing him carefully from where he stands looming over the genius, hands clasped in front of him.
Lestrade's gaze flashed uncomfortably to Sherlock. "Uh-"
"Before we move too fast," the rugby player whispers, carding a hand through Sherlock's curls to soothe the ache of denial that floods the genius boy's features immediately. "I told you; we need to go slow. This is important to me.
"I'm fine, thanks," Sherlock says softly, hovering near the exit.
And for some unknown reason, that makes Sherlock laugh. Sincerely, laugh. "I like Chemistry," he chokes out between breaths, having no idea what this feeling in his chest is. "I enjoy experiments."
"Fuck yes, baby," John moans softly, and fingers find their way into Sherlock's hair. Sherlock hums contentedly.
John shook his head.
"You didn't come here to apologize at all, did you?"
Sherlock burst through the back doors of the building purposefully forceful, banging the door hard against the wall, hoping to startle and stop anything going on in the shadows.
Only John.
And masturbated at every possible moment alone like the titillated teenager he was.
John smiles wider. "I did," he says, admiring the plastic wrapped around his leg. "I can actually function like a real person now."
"So… let me get this straight," Greg said slowly as John slumped in a familiar fashion onto the couch, still shaking from his interaction with Sherlock.
"John," he breathes and John descends upon him.
. There is absolutely
He could be coming for hours, he has no idea. All he knows is his cock is enveloped in the mouth of the boy he's been obsessing over for weeks and he's currently pulsing down his throat and
John's eyes blazed with uncontrolled fury. "Oh, I'm mad about a whole mess of things, Sherlock, but right now I want to talk about this. It's one thing for you to humiliate me, but it's a whole other thing for you to treat my friends like shit."
would trust
John laughs. "Yeah, that's what I was getting at," he giggles, grinning broadly at Sherlock.
"Oh," Sherlock mumbles twisting his fingers behind his back and dropping his gaze to the floor, fear and panic riddling his thoughts into gibberish. He can't deduce these boys. They won't like it. No one likes his deductions. Except John. But John is
"Besides," Link chimed in. "I actually do know where Sherlock is tonight."
Someone is interested in him.
There is a long row of jogging blokes racing out onto the field, backs to the audience, dressed in matching uniforms, head to toe in black and white with a splash of red on two of the figures. Black jerseys, black shorts, black knee-socks, and some sort of black shoe on their feet, hints of white lining the collars of their shirts, wrapped in two bands around their biceps and painted across their backs in the form of numbers and last names, a slick white streak down either side of their shorts, finished off with two white circles atop each sock just below the knee. Two boys wear thick red armbands with the bold block C embroidered in white to match their jerseys.
"You sure?" Greg's brows are creased in genuine worry.
"Christ almighty, ALRIGHT!" John snaps as his shoulders shake with laughter, dropping a kiss to his pouting genius' forehead and rolling out of bed, snagging his rugby warm-up sweats out of his drawer and pulling them on before storming toward the door.
Stalking over like a lunatic, John tore through the groups of people, making his way until both Victor and Sherlock were in full view, both holding drinks, chatting animatedly to each other.
John smirks. "Alright, Sherlock Holmes."
Sherlock was obviously amused by this but refrained from commenting. John gaped at the three of them, still feeling entirely lost. "Okay…so you went to his office…" John tried to move the conversation along.
"Didn't you?"
Sherlock ducks his head as Mrs. Hudson makes her way to the kettle. "How is he?" she whispers behind her hand. Sherlock peeks around her shoulder to see John glaring at her back.
like this.
"Jesus, are you okay?" John asks sincerely. "I didn't mean to scare you."
"I liked..." John trails off before finishing his sentence, glancing around at anything but Sherlock, gently shaking his head. "Yeah, I- I liked it."
"Seriously?" Irene chides, taking a seat beside him. "You can't be that clueless."
John felt sweat forming on his brow.
as bad as Link had said. John forced himself not to panic. He was a good student. He could handle a tough teacher.
But days like today, days where the sky lay dark and ominous, where couples hurried along Baker Street, hand in hand, umbrellas held over head by caring husbands or significant others, prepped and ready to protect loved ones from the rain, John couldn't help feeling a bit cheated.
The words fall dangerously close to something John had text messaged earlier, something that Sherlock still can't shake from his thoughts, something he doesn't think he will ever forget.
Sherlock makes his way back to the kitchen to pour the now heated water. He mentally notes where the telly remote is and reminds himself to grab it on his way back into the main room.
Huffing and wincing as he stood, Sherlock grappled with his shirt, glaring at John.
"He didn't do anything?" John replies a little weaker than before, staring up at what he can only describe as his delighted lover.
Everyone.
who will be the student this evening."
John's eyes bulged. Shaking his head vigorously, the word no just on the tip of his tongue, Victor suddenly turned to Sherlock, hand wrapping around his arm as though urgently needing something. "OH! Oh my, Sherlock, I forgot to tell you, I just spoke with our Chemistry professor, about the homework?" He slowly dragged Sherlock away, continuing to talk above John's protests and holding Sherlock's attention.
Or not.
"Your work was adequate," Sherlock replied shortly then looked down at his untouched coffee and back to John. "Is that what this is? A bribe for more good marks?"
"You could always
And this, he supposes, is how ten beautiful, perfect years of friendship crumbles to nothing.
Sherlock is nodding hastily and John is pulling him in by his cheeks and their lips meet.
"Oh, I-" John Watson's beautiful tenor voice murmurs uncomfortably behind him and Sherlock freezes. "Sorry, I just… I just wanted to make sure you were alright."
Sherlock turns away, decidedly not mesmerized by the boy on the pitch. Decidedly not thinking about
"It's for me," he says. "I play and Sherlock has a keen eye for observations of technique and the things I need to work on. He's quite an asset to me, actually."
There is a beat of silence before the team seems to come alive at the announcement, mumbling to each other interestedly, and John can't help but grin at that. It's been an age since he's kicked a ball around.
Oh no.
he means
Mike raised his eyebrows. "And you do? John, you met the guy a week ago. He clearly only wants one thing from you. Why would you want someone like that who gives it up to everyone? You're better then that mate."
They see each other daily.
It didn't occur to John until much later, after racing all over campus in a fruitless effort to find someone who clearly didn't want to be found, that he realized he had one other person he could try.
"Seriously, mate," Paul nods in agreement. "We just knew you were up here worrying and we wanted you to know it's gonna be fine. John will be fine. Why don't you go back to the hotel and surprise him? He should be back within a half an hour, they're just bandaging him up."
"You heard the woman," Lestrade's louder voice booms as he appears next to Mrs. Hudson. "Off you go."
"Yes you did," Sherlock replies petulantly. "You went on and on about her small waist and… and… well, just her waist but obviously you noticed her body."
"You two are ridiculous," John tries to jab while dropping a kiss to Sherlock's cheek, taking a small satisfaction in the fact that this beautiful boy is pressed to his side and not Irene's, which is
John rolls his hips and Sherlock is panting heavily, never knowing anything could feel this good. John holds him down, arms still bound over his head and Sherlock pushes back and takes it.
And that just wasn't something John thought he could do.
Hesitating for only a millisecond, John threw open the door of Sherlock's bedroom. He didn't have the time or patience to wait for the stubborn genius to answer.
Then a hand is on his shoulder and he's being yanked backward.
Until Sherlock finally approaches him after a victorious rugby game in the middle of a rowdy celebratory crowd.
Which promptly brought John right over the edge, spilling warm liquid from the tip of his dick in long, never ending strings, surely ruining the bed sheets and reaching Sherlock's cock easily. John held on to the boy touching him, riding out the blissful peak of an orgasm he'd never known, sure he was making ridiculous needy noises and unable to care. One of his hands had found its way into Sherlock's curls and he pulled down, desperately needing an anchor, needing to hold on tightly to something, convinced if he didn't he might just float away in ecstasy.
. And now he's currently kicking himself for
John thought about that for a moment. "Oh. What's your name?"
Sherlock glares. "He's only been back a fortnight. It's a bit early to be making decisions."
"You know better, Sherlock. I trust you'll do what's right."
What a line.
The next few things Sherlock sorted out were John's miserable home life, the tiny house he'd lived in with a single parent and a sibling he didn't get on with, gender of that sibling still difficult to sort out. By the tidiness of his side of the room, Sherlock would guess the absentee parent in John's life was his father, unless his father were the more maternal one, though Sherlock would assume not. By the looks of John's belongings, cleanliness and smiles at every passing stranger, Sherlock deduced John grew up in a house run by a mother.
"I had a wonderful evening with you tonight, John."
He wanted John to have everything he ever wanted. He wanted him to have affection and connection and love.
"Okay, so you're a public school brat from London," John muses, lips twitching at the affronted scrunch of his roommate's face. "Got it."
They enter the dance, Molly's arm hooked in Sherlock's, and Sherlock is already scanning for John and Mary.
Mycroft watches as she descends the stairs with the rest of the fans before turning back to Sherlock with an amused eyebrow already raised. "She seems...lovely."
The pink in his face promptly darkens seven shades into a deep, horrified red, gaze trained on the pillow like a magnet drawn to its mate, unable to look away, unable to look at
And it tears something like a hole inside of Sherlock's chest, creating a small empty space between his lungs. It's not large, not all-consuming, but it's there lurking suddenly, making itself known, alerting Sherlock to its presence subtly and staking a claim inside him. A longing of sorts. A small little space that reminds him he will never be a part of anything like this. Not ever.
Sherlock shrugs a response. He wants to believe John. But he knows better.
"I'm not much for keeping records."
He just hadn't realized how awful it had been until he wasn't on his own anymore.
"Your voice is sexy." John wanted to make sure this helpful person knew that.
"Well if you're dead by the time I return, I suppose it's been nice knowing you, John."
So Link was bisexual. He made a note to introduce him to Mike. Sherlock was 19. So all that arrogance and esteem that came off him in waves was bullshit. Sherlock was…promiscuous. With everyone but John apparently. And he did it in public. Somehow that felt worse. Why, if Sherlock treated any sort of sexual activity so casually, why wouldn't he sleep with him? John had sworn he'd gotten some sort of positive vibe from him after their discussions… maybe he'd misinterpreted all of it? Maybe he was just some dumb virgin who didn't know how to read signals. Maybe John wasn't good enough to be counted among Sherlock's sexual conquests.
"No one was out here except me," John assures him quickly. "I saw you sneak out here and saddle Dolly. It wasn't too hard to sort out what you were doing."
Sherlock ignores John and narrows his eyes at his father. "What about Mrs. Hudson?"
He threw his phone down on the bed and shoved his face into his pillow.
"Goodnight, Sh'lock. Have the sweetest dreams everrr," John had murmured into the silent dark of the room, rolling the last 'r' into a soft sigh.
"We need a proper date," John remarks as he kisses Sherlock one last time before stepping away and glancing around to grab his keys and wallet laying on the bed.
That point in and of itself was driven home on an almost daily basis, as Sherlock rejected person after person. Mike's warning really wasn't necessary when John received firsthand proof constantly.
His father sobers immediately. "What? When in God's name did I say that?"
John flinched at that description of what happened. "I'm not some victim," he murmured.
Shaking his head, Sherlock refocuses, pushing the stars around his tiny tree, attempting to clean the chaos into something nice.
"Bad things," John growls. "I'm going to do very bad things to you, Sherlock."
This boy only gets more interesting.
It keeps Sherlock distracted.
John thought about that for a long moment.
He leaves out the part of waking up with a wedding ring on his finger and the man he loved more than anything whispering a proposal in his ear.
His movements seem to make his lover bolder somehow, Sherlock's eyes widening slightly before his licks his lips and reaches his fingers down into John's fringe. "Lick my..." he stutters, cradling John's skull in his gloriously big hands, not pushing but holding on, steadying himself for what's next, pupils blown to the brink making his eyes look dark and dangerous and so fucking sexy. "Lick my cock, John. Please."
John lowers his fork and sighs. "Do you really want to talk about this here?"
So instead of trying to conjure up that single conversation he'd had all those weeks ago, Sherlock indulges in this one, leaving his heart to its own devices while his head spins and spins and spins, rereading the message over and over until the words are no longer more than smudges on his screen and Sherlock's heart calms from a pounding to a flutter, dancing happily in his chest.
He glances up to find John fixing him with a furious glare. "Outside," John growls. "Now."
Sherlock rolls his eyes at John's blatant attempt to take the pressure off of him. "What do
The man did actually laugh this time but didn't respond. John grinned harder at the sight, lost in this man's smile. "Hey, what's your name?" The words tumbled out of his mouth and suddenly his brain snapped into place. "Wait, how did you know my name? And how did you know I want to be a doctor?" He paused for a moment, furrowing his brow. "And why did you want to help me save my friendship with Mike?" The questions were falling out of his mouth with ease now and John had to close his lips tightly yet again.
"This wasn't my brilliant idea!" Greg snaps immediately, attempting and failing not to laugh. "Why am I being blamed for dragging us all out here?"
It's proving to be
Fucking hell.
He'd stuck with his game plan. No point in dealing with it when he was
"Oh come
No one looks like that here.
John wants to handle things in public. Because up until right this very moment they haven't fucking
"John", Sherlock gasps and even to his own ears it sounds like a plea, begging the boy delivering such unbelievable pleasure to his body to stop, scrabbling a hand along John's shoulder and hair. "John. John! Please, John stop,
John had laughed because really there was no other response to the most gorgeous human being he'd ever laid eyes on not understanding why someone would want to date him.
The cheerleaders.
And up until several months ago, up until blue irises and blonde fringe and megawatt smiles, he never realized exactly what that meant. Up until John Watson had given him a minute of his time and attention, Sherlock Holmes hadn't comprehended the fact that being alone all these years has made him so bloody
John stole another glance, this time holding that penetrating gaze and slowly nodded. "Yes."
It's a bit tougher to get out the door after that, and even harder not to let panic seep into John's swirling mind as Sherlock Holmes gives him one last heart-wrenchingly beautiful smile as his bids him a nice day, stepping out of the room and out of John's sight before the rugby player can change his mind.
John's heart aches at the thought of leaving him.
John waited for only a second more before he turned and walked slowly back the way he came, cold with shock, unsure of what else to do with himself and suddenly feeling very exposed out in the open.
He's certain of it.
They grab Thai food from one of their favorite places, and then head back to Sherlock's home.
solid and sturdy and hot under Sherlock's hands. He lets himself float in the warmth of John's frame still fitted around his up against the door, letting pleasure sweep through him as he gazes down at his perfect man.
Fuck it.
"You've informed me twice in a drunken stupor that you would very much like to sleep with me. In some rather colorful ways. Were you lying?"
with that?" Sherlock practically yells, on the verge of being properly irritated all over again and that precious, beautiful John had thought Sherlock had been denying him sex and kisses and love all this time and had been totally at peace with it.
And later on, as Mike is pouring beer into red cups and Sherlock is shaking out his hand in preparation for some serious Pong playing, still feeling like he's floating along in a happy bubble, he catches the gaze of that beautiful blond rugby player he lives with as John grins at him over the rim of his beer bottle, dropping a wink at Sherlock before going back to the conversation he's having with Greg. That beautiful idiot who has been nothing short of a miracle in Sherlock's life, casually taking a moment out of his discussion with a teammate to remind Sherlock how important he is. That beautiful
Sliding fingers into dark curls at the back of Sherlock's head, John trails a line of kisses along the genius boy's jaw until he can bury his face in Sherlock's gorgeous neck, pressing the palm of his hand to Sherlock's lower back and simply holding him close, breathing him in, letting his scent and his presence surround John until his world rights itself again, the last few tumultuous hours enough to throw him completely off balance.
Sherlock nods. "I know. I'll have the papers drawn up. You don't have to worry about a thing."
He nods slowly. "Yes..." he says at length.
"Good," John pulls back suddenly, removing his hands and lips from Sherlock's body and steps away.
Grinning to himself, Sherlock still refuses to look at him, though the soft chuckle he hears in reply only makes him smile harder.
so they love you by proxy," John laughs.
And since John Watson is loyal to a fault, he has no current plans to end this separation early, something about the 'team' and 'not letting anyone down' and some other nonsense that Sherlock just could not listen to considering all of these statements only lead to one fact that this time apart will not end any sooner and the full five days apart would be forced upon him without his consent like some exile he's been ordered into.
From day one Sherlock has wanted John. Good god does he
When the reply comes, he really debates not reading it at all before he realizes he still has no idea what to do about this date situation and resigns himself to it.
, he tacks on internally. He can't be sure he won't vomit later after this little trek home, considering how his stomach keeps rolling, though the urgency of it has dulled to a slow tumble, simply reminding Sherlock that's its still unsettled and perhaps debating how it would like to go about fixing it, not giving the genius an option in the least.
Sherlock glowers at his father with as much malice as humanly possible. "She's mine," he bites. "I should be allowed to ride her."
"You can be loud, baby," John croones, accenting his words with a twist of his wrist. "Mycroft left."
But not quite yet.
"Yeah, sorry mate, I think we're in for the night," John shrugs, trying not to notice the fumbling of Sherlock's key strokes over some part of John's sentence he can't quite narrow down.
He should tell him this is wrong.
His fingers begin to shake where they're still holding onto the drawstring, a ball of messy anxious nerves bursting free in his chest and distracting him into his own head, his worried thoughts grabbing his focus and drawing him in. His breathing goes a bit ragged as he attempts to muddle through his panic, unable to get out of his own way and back to the task at hand but Christ Almighty.
John tried to move away in the small space but his limbs were no longer listening to his brain. John tried to close his eyes, to break the spell those beautiful eyes had put him under but his lids didn't move. He tried to simply blink, do something to prove he was still in control, prove that he hadn't surrendered every fiber of his being to the mercy of Sherlock Holmes.
There was a long silence, then Mycroft rose, scraping his umbrella casually across the floor as he strode to the exit. Sherlock waited, knowing full well his brother would have parting words.
. That is simply
Apparently, the animal currently scraping at the ground and howling its fury didn't get the memo that Sherlock is gay.
"Oi, should we call it?" Paul shouts just as a crack of thunder practically vibrates the ground, the storm suddenly deciding to come on in full force.
subtly whatsoever and even going a pretty shade of pink, John still smiles back like this interaction is something he'll remember for a long time.
He's had 48 hours to think this over and he knows exactly what happened that night and he's ready to apologize and forget and go back to being the friends that they are because Christ if he doesn't miss John more than he ever has before.
John incoherent
Sherlock wrinkles his nose. "That has got to be the worst consolation prize in the history of consolation prizes."
And yet, his brain has decided to all but shut down and zero in on that tiny screen, blocking out professor's lectures and student voices and anything regarding his academic career for the day because Sherlock is somewhere that isn't with John and it's making the rugby player itch for some sort of communication that all is well, that Sherlock is alright and that
It was only a matter of time before one of them snapped.
That's not actually the whole truth but Sherlock would prefer to not ruin the evening with something as ugly as the truth. He tries not to glance at the seat to John's right, ignoring the image conjured up in his head of Mrs. Hudson dressed in all black and staring fiercely back at him, gripping his and Mycroft's hands and telling them they aren't alone. Even now, all these years later it still twinges something in Sherlock's chest, the sight of his housekeeper-turned-parent immediately stepping in after the death of their parents, protecting them the only way she knew how, guiding them through the grief.
"I do," Mike grins, giggling as he zips his jacket.
At least, that's what John told himself over and over for two straight weeks. He hadn't quite decided if he believed it yet.
It's annoying.
Something heavy lands harshly on John's heart, weighing it down in his chest at the sight of Sherlock Holmes asking him if he's kissing him incorrectly, making him ache in places he didn't even know he had, wanting nothing more than to convince the boy in his bed that no,
"I play the violin when I'm thinking. Sometimes I don't talk for days on end. Would that bother you? Potential flatmates should know the worst about each other."
this is thrilling, watching John squirm and moan because of things Sherlock is doing, making such a beautiful boy find pleasure beneath Sherlock's fingertips. God, he wants to make John come. He wants to bring him to orgasm like he's never wanted anything before, wants to watch John arch his back and roll his hips, wants to hear John make such pretty little noises for him, Sherlock wants it so goddamn
John cocked his head. "Do what?"
Thirty is an excellent number. Thirty gives him lots of options.
Mycroft steps back and nods. "Good. You'll have the house to yourselves for the remainder of the night. I trust you'll do the right thing."
Rolling his eyes, he steps around his insane roommate, peering out to see the real damage, unable to continue to look at the curly-haired boy and attempting to shake off the small tremors running through his body at the first physical contact he's had with Sherlock Holmes.
Fuck Sherlock Holmes.
It takes a half second to process those words.
Sherlock wants to make some stupid joke about it to make John laugh. Tease John about how much he must hate those crutches and that stupid cast. He wants to laugh and laugh with John until they're intertwined, finding each other again.
," Sherlock hisses, burying his red face in the crook where John's shoulder meets his neck and attempting to breathe against the touch of John's hand against his sensitive skin. Clever fingers find their way to his flies and work them open, flicking the button open first before dragging the zipper down so agonizingly slow.
Smirking, Sherlock tossed him a wink as a black taxi pulled up in front of them. "You'll see."
But John knows it's the right thing to do and he knows it's for the best and so he calms his body and his mind, dropping his head back to the pillow, resting his hands along Sherlock's cheeks and pulling back gently, desperate kisses waning away to soft tender touches, fingers calming from grabbing to caressing, bodies no longer rocking but settling gently together.
And John very much
-" Sherlock murmured, lips closing around John's ear and sucking, pushing his chest further into John's hands.
"This," Sherlock pants against John's lips, "has been driving me mad all evening."
Because Sherlock Holmes has big plans to
Sherlock stroked the back of his hand with his thumb. "She clearly just broke up with someone, that Clara person I presume," he murmured. "She's just lost someone important to her, probably due to something she did. My guess would be the drinking was what ended it. She's now under the impression that you are the only one that would understand since you were also rejected a few months ago, and she believes her misfortune is due to in most part to her upbringing, something she believes you also relate to. She thought she would find your life in a similar state as hers. And like they say; misery loves company." Sherlock looked back toward the front of the cab. "I'm afraid I may have been the one to set off the harsher comments. She wasn't expecting you to be with someone, nor was she expecting to see that you make that someone very happy. She was unable to do that with Clara."
Sherlock nods and pulls his knees up to his chest.
"That's it, oh that's incredible, you are
Victor, sighing as though a man resigned to his face, stepped aside, looking down. "Yes sir," he mumbled.
John hums. "After I got shot, yeah?"
"Yeah?"
John can't keep up but he still seems thrilled to be a part of it, following in Lestrade's car and grinning when he arrives finding Sherlock pinning a suspect to the ground.
Of course now, Sherlock was finding it increasingly difficult to keep his hands off John. He'd sworn up and down they would take it slow, and he planned to keep that promise but John certainly wasn't making it easy on him. Since the day John met Mycroft, only five days previously, Sherlock had kept things at kissing. Not that there was anything chaste about the way they were kissing, and Sherlock knew that only made it worse, but he was determined to follow through with his plan. When he felt John's hands wander, he'd maneuver properly around them so as not to upset the kiss, but make it more difficult to let it go any further. John obeyed, growling quietly in frustration every time, and Sherlock physically gripped at John's hair to keep his hands out of his clothes. God, just kissing that boy made him so achingly hard and he had to leave him every time all too soon, with an excuse about homework or class or an experiment or anything besides staying. He wasn't fooling John, but the boy was kind enough to let him go without a fuss. John seemed to have agreed to taking things slow, even though it was clearly painful for him. Sherlock appreciated this because in all honesty, if John pushed back even a tiny bit, Sherlock would have fucked him ten ways to Sunday by now.
John caught him and Sherlock laugh. "Alright, you got me," he giggled. "I'm… a bit, eh… drunk."
He's on his precious horse he's longed to ride like this for years.
Warm tongues twirl around each other in Sherlock's mouth, John's much stronger and more sure than the curly-haired boy's but it doesn't seem to hinder John a bit as he slips it between Sherlock's teeth, stroking and tasting and what feels like memorizing, pulling a low, pleasurable groan from deep in Sherlock's chest as the insides of his cheeks tingle.
Victor Trevor.
How anyone,
"Alright, what are you up to in here that is taking
What Sherlock hadn't anticipated was a bitter, drunk sister showing up out of nowhere to throw all of her problems in John's face. By all accounts, they hardly ever spoke, not keeping in touch in the slightest. He'd had Mycroft keep eyes on her just in case after John told him he suspected Harry had a drinking problem, seeing as the only time he heard from her was late at night when she'd clearly been hitting the bottle. But Sherlock hadn't considered her a dangerous person. A sad person maybe but not a trigger for John.

Studying.
"Harry, what in God's name are you doing here?" John asked, slightly panicked. Harry laughed again, flipping her hair and swaying ever so slightly on her feet. She smiled dazedly and an acidic gust of air hit John square in the face. "Oh fuck. How drunk are you?"
"Then what are you talking about John? Please enlighten me, because-"
Oh Christ, he
John nodded once determinately. "Yes it is. Look I know I was a little…I dunno, forward in your office a few weeks ago and I just wanted to say I'm sorry. I get it now, and I'll back off on that front but I'd still like to be friends. Real friends. Not fake 'let's hang out until you agree to shag me' friends."
Fucking hell. John's head pounded but he crawled out and dressed quickly.
, Sherlock."
"Going soft on me, Adler?" Sherlock teases.
"...if you are going to win, although I don't even think
"No," Sherlock replies softly, leaning in to the touch. "I just don't want to go to a club."
"I hope you'll come to another," John rushes to say, following more steadily with, "Also, pick what you want for dinner and I'll go grab it after I shower," before actually bolting, deciding that's as much soppiness he can take without actually running back in and planting a giant smacker on his roommate's lips.
His cunning response, however, promptly dies in his throat, the color in his face draining along with it as all of his panic from earlier comes roaring back in full force, shaking its head at Sherlock's complete and utter stupidity.
"Go away."
"You are beautiful, so beautiful Sherlock, so good for me and so bloody gorgeous," John is gasping, hips stuttering and it's enough to push Sherlock under.
"Fuck, ohhhh fuck," Sherlock muttered, wriggling his hips against John's hand, fingers digging into the sheets beneath him.
Greg waves to the curly-haired boy as he grabs Mycroft's hand and drags him off and Sherlock ignores him entirely, turning back around to get home and away from this conversation that has hit just a bit too close to the mark, because why does stupid, sodding
"Of course I find you attractive."
He's installed a small fridge and icebox to keep the body parts fresh.

. So long, he'd dreamt about being with Sherlock. And finally,

Today, he's got fingers.
"Our poor Johnny," he says with a clap on the back and a Mike-mirrored sympathetic close-mouthed smile of his own. "Honestly, should you even be playing a contact sport right now? Can you focus on anything besides that pretty-boy roommate of yours?"
," John replies fiercely, words quiet but firm as he says them and Sherlock can't help chancing a glance from beneath his eyelashes as John continues. "You are absolutely perfect exactly how you are and Phillip Anderson can fuck right off."
Mike makes a sound like a whine to the general center of the table. "Come
John's mouth drops open in mock-offense. "Adequate?! Mate you got me my first A in Chemistry! It's better than bloody adequate!"
"Hm?" Greg mutters half-heartedly beside him and John turns to see Greg's nose buried in his cell phone, lips pressed hard as he taps out a text message.
"Okay, okay," Irene says, still chuckling under her breath. "Sorry, you're right. Oh man, but not knowing what halftime is? Not understanding the point of halftime-" and breaks off into more peels of laughter. "You really-"
The genius is better off not returning jabs or facts of his own only to egg on the conversation endlessly, but it seems he can't really avoid it lately. It must be the time of year that's got everyone all wound up about love and sex and relationships, more people pairing off lately just so they're not alone on the most romantic day of the year, Valentine's Day already next week and considering the bully is currently secretly juggling two women, it makes sense for Anderson to become more crass, more careless and more vicious than usual, his outlet always being ruining Sherlock's day.
Jesus Christ.
And Sherlock just can't help adding just a dash more happiness to that precious, round face and just barely avoids diving under the tree to grab another small present, one he'd purchased and wrapped all on his own, not half as perfectly as his mother had but he's hoping John won't mind too much.
Sure, he's had orgasms. He's tossed off plenty of times.
"I-… wh-"
"And I'll be there too, you know," John mumbles, looking away to keep the moment from getting too intense, too close to concern, and glancing around for his towel and clothing to change into after he showers because he can already tell what Sherlock's answer will be. "We can just, I dunno, hang out and have a beer or something."
"Hey I'm giving you the keys to make it right," Greg throws his palms up defensively as he laughs. "Don't mock it."
, John," Sherlock is trembling against his soon-to-be-lover, John's words doing nothing but spiking his arousal to new heights, making him want more than he's ever done before.
Sherlock wants to hate him.
John gapes at him for a long moment.
And that's when John realizes his great miscalculation.
John and Greg both turn to find Paul shuffling in the door, shifting his bag on his shoulder looking a bit uncomfortable. The same look he's been sporting for the last week. An uncertain look. A guilt-ridden look.
He missed him so desperately.
He wonders what his mouth is going to produce in response as it opens.
Exchanging another look, both Greg and Sherlock smirk before Sherlock shrugs at him. "No," he says casually and goes to stand. "You wanna go dance?"
And it's like being stuck in some awful limbo, the moment stretching out and almost landing in awkward territory, almost forcing Sherlock to fidget under the stare of his flatmate, and he's unsure what to do with himself.
John grinned. "Most definitely. And I wouldn't have it any other way."
"Oh god, but Sherlock I… I don't… I can't-"
Sherlock.
"I was trying to be considerate," Sherlock shoots back, lips twitching as he attempts to school them into angrily pursing. "Isn't that what people do in relationships?"
Another knock came, a bit more insistent this time and Sherlock threw himself off the couch, storming to the door, already planning to tell whatever solicitor was there to bugger off, when he swung it open and found a very pink John Watson standing in his doorway.
Sherlock knows John saw him. He
Sherlock pushes the window open to find John Watson grinning at him, tiny rocks in his hand.
Lestrade glared at him. "You always work alone."
with Sherlock's family, a scheme Sherlock has been working on for a solid month, not the least bit ashamed to admit to himself how proud he is for this accomplishment. "Come on!" he calls, finding the effort to continue seeming unaffected and aloof becoming more and more difficult as he nears the house.
Dragging fitted jeans down legs a mile long, John's mouth fills with saliva as soft skin appears with every push and pull of his fingers, muscles twitching and tightening beneath John's gentle touch and he can't help dipping forward and nipping at a meaty thigh, teeth sinking in softly, a pretty pink blushing the paleness away in a sudden burst of color.
"Nope," Greg replies with a shrug. "That boy has no idea."
Sherlock nods hastily. "Okay. Sure."
Holmes' eyes ran over him. "Oh due relax, it has nothing to do with you. The ring started long before you arrived."
All is right with the world.
Sherlock blinks. He'd never even thought of it like that.
Sherlock shakes his head. This is so frustrating. Why, if someone actually fancied him, would they write him a poem and not reveal their identity-
"Hello goooorgeous!"
be coincidence, can it? Or maybe it is? Sherlock's head spins as he steps around the corner to find John leaning against the wall, bound in his navy rugby jacket, grinning knowingly at him, eyes bright and twinkling.
The tiny ember that has lodged itself in Sherlock's chest when this all began slowly glows to life. He bites his lip as he types his reply.
"-but that you drank alcohol with a bunch of drunk uni kids.
His voice had gone so soft. "I can't lose you," John murmured.
Close to his heart.
He felt Sherlock's body tense. "I-I didn't mean...I mean I know you're still deciding..."
"I'm taking care of these tossers," John lobs back with a grin as he ties the front of his sweats snuggly and reaches for the door handle.
Sherlock can't move.
Water pours from his face and his fringe, but his gaze stays locked on his cock disappearing into Sherlock's mouth.
It's like fireworks going off as their lips collide in a slow, heated kiss, feeling each other out so carefully and gently and Sherlock's toes are curling in bliss as he practically melts into John's frame, winding his arms around John's shoulders, heat racing up his spine as John kisses him so tenderly, tucking Sherlock's bottom lip between his own and sucking carefully. It's full of tentative wonder and heated promise, the slow push and pull of their mouths gentling against one another, finding their own unique rhythm and already the genius boy is trembling, the possibility of
With a pounding head and a heavy heart, Sherlock drags himself to his next class, wishing more than anything that this brutal day would just bloody
"Don't say fine again-"
On any other day, any other moment in time, Sherlock can easily shrug off the abuse. He can ignore the jabs about his relationship status and the insinuations about his sexuality and go about his life. He can roll his eyes and shake his head and pay no attention to the tormentors in his secondary school, hardly any of them having much of an effect on his everyday life. He knows who he is and he isn't ashamed, not a single bit, no matter what they say, no matter how hard they try to rip him apart.
"Sorry," John murmurs, wiping the wetness from his cheeks. "I s'pose this memory loss thing has me coming over a bit wobbly."
The man let out a fake laugh. "My, aren't you interesting. I can see why he likes you."
A hand comes down on his shoulder, shaking him from his thoughts.
Right?
His damp fingers clench together in each of his pockets, gripping the thick cotton of his hoodie because he needs to hold on to something right now as his heart hammers in his chest, blood pumping in his ears at the same tempo. His knees shudder and threaten to give out as the rest of his body begins to hum at the sight of John Watson in his rugby uniform, like that jersey and those shorts and those socks were created to drive Sherlock Holmes absolutely
This dirty, disorderly, sexy as all hell,
," Mike crows behind them where he stands with Greg and Paul, gawking at the swarm before them before smacking a hand to John's back. "Let's get drinks!"
"I believe they call it snogging, John," Sherlock quips, barely moving from where he lays, though John can practically feel the smirk creasing the genius' features.
That caught Sherlock's attention. He snapped his gaze back to meet John's now mischievous grin. He raised an eyebrow. "Is that a challenge?"
He'd thrown it rather direct and sharp, aiming in the general direction of the pyramid, hoping to hit something, anything, though he panics for a beat as the ball makes its way to the other end for what feels like eternity.
"Of course I do," Sherlock agreed, leaning back to grin up at John, wincing slightly at the movement. John dropped a kiss to his temple, and Sherlock settled back, humming quietly.
Of course now, as he lays eyes on that beautiful boy, currently leaning against the steal bleachers, hands shoved in snug jean pockets, red university sweatshirt pulled tightly over his chest and arms, curls fluttering around in the light wind, all the confidence and courage John can muster in the privacy of his own head seems to dissipate, leaving in its wake a nervous energy he can't do much else with besides fall back into their now comfortable friendship, not moving forward or backward, simply standing still in his comfort zone.
He's not.
A man John had been mad about for months finally told him he was interested, kissed him soundly, made him breakfast, exchanged a few chaste touches, and then informed him he wanted to court John. Court him. Like they were living in the fucking Victorian Age.
"Yeah, I know," John snaps, clicking the End Call button as Paul's voicemail comes on and redials. "But I… I think it would be uh, fun to hang, just the four of us, you know?"
"Hm," Sherlock nods, suddenly blinking away his depthless eyes and wiping any emotion from his face, indifference falling into place effortlessly. "Well. Enjoy yourself."
"Because I was afraid you were on a date!" John almost yelled.
There isn't even a question about who he'll be sending it to, which is reckless and dangerous all on its own but Molly's giant eyes are still looking at him pleadingly and he can't help the tiny thrill at the idea of John Watson getting a candy heart on Valentine's Day from a secret admirer that's actually his best friend. Besides, John loves these sorts of holidays anyway, Sherlock unable to forget the Christmas he'd been dragged out to sing carols with the rugby player in the snow, John pink-cheeked and grinning the entire time. He'll love getting a surprise on Valentine's Day, of that Sherlock is certain.
Eyeing him curiously with a raised eyebrow that the genius can't see, John takes a step forward. "Alright?" he asks softly, concern coloring his words.
And he doesn't know what he was thinking. He doesn't know. He doesn't
smell he has that Sherlock could just-
A tiny prick of panic stabs the back of his skull, but Sherlock nods. "Yes."
Sherlock's eyes widened. "Mar...Mrs. Hudson? My nanny?"
And Sherlock is suddenly trying to remember why he thought bringing John Watson here was such a brilliant idea. Because seeing him now, just inside the doorway of his beloved family home, surrounding by the familiar trimmings that had been a part of his Christmas since he was a boy, it feels much different than a flatmate meeting another flatmate's family. It feels much more intimate. More formal. Like their relationship is something else entirely besides flat sharers and friends.
What John hadn't factored in when he'd declared himself controlled was how much time he actually spent with Sherlock Holmes. Every class, every walk home from school, every adventure out into the woods or the lake or the market, John and Sherlock did all of that together.
"John!" Sherlock cries, digging his hands deeply in John's hair.
He decides it would be nicer to just go out to the clearing and freely ride for the day. No practice. No responsibilities.
Sherlock collapsed to the side of him and immediately rolled off the bed, hooking his trousers back in place. John barely noticed that he was gone, his eyes closed securely as he fell back on the bed, until a hot flannel was laid over his chest. John hummed in appreciation as Sherlock cleaned his skin.
"Yes!" Sherlock shrieks. "I don't understand!"
At least when he's asleep, he's slightly easier for Sherlock to handle.
"Me too," Sherlock replies just as gravelly, arms winding around John's neck and bringing him as close as he can. "I can't say the same for my poor pants though."
that."
"John is fine." He ignores the way his voice softens slightly around John's names.
He lets himself be manhandled, feeling stupider by the minute, realizing he can in fact stand on his own as John settles him on his feet.
The one with his back facing Sherlock. The one with shaggy blond hair shifting with every step he takes. The one with the short frame that has that jersey wrapped around it in ways Sherlock has never even imagined, perfectly accentuating that fit, compact body in all the right places. The one with the number 3 laying down his back. The one with WATSON plastered across his shoulder blades in stark white, loud and proud and melting Sherlock's entire being into a small puddle on the dirty metal floor of the bleachers.
"Seriously, love," John whispers, laying a hand to Sherlock's chest and feeling the wild thump of a frantic pulse against his palm. "Absolutely gorgeous."
"I do," John shushes him before sealing their lips together again and pressing his middle finger inside, swallowing down Sherlock's cry, "Oh god yes, I promise, I
close.
Because what comes next is going to be bloody
They are together.
"Tea sounds great," John was saying as Sherlock took off to the kitchen, his dressing gown flowing behind him as he ducked around the corner. He wasn't even sure if he had tea, but he did have a kettle he could boil water in that he could keep busy with. He flipped it on and took a few deep breaths, closing his eyes and trying to regain his composure as he gripped the counter's edge. He let himself go into his mind for a moment, searching for something else to focus on, something not as heartbreaking as something potentially happening to John.
John couldn't tell if it hurt more that Sherlock was dating someone or that he didn't deem John worthy enough to tell.
John frowned for a moment. "None until now. Why?"
Lestrade was still eyeing John as Sherlock spoke, and bristled as he looked back at him. "Absolutely not," he snapped. "I told you I'd send you information that you could work on later. I absolutely cannot have civilians trampling around a crime scene."
"Do I seem like the type of person to 'go do something', Mr. Watson?"
"What is your problem?" John cried, the numbness from the past few days slowly lifting. "Jesus, I just want to apologize to my boyfriend or ex… or whatever, and you're meddling arse keeps getting in my way."
But it doesn't matter because Sherlock is
John let a wide smile take over his face as he responded.
It comes out sharper than he'd intended but Greg simply smiles in understanding if a bit sadly. "That," he replies by way of explanation, flinging a hand toward where the crowd has parted just enough for them to see through where Sherlock is leaned against the bar beside Irene who is half bent over the top seemingly flirting with the barmaid if her body language is anything to go by. "I saw that awful look you got before he went off with the boys and Irene. You've got to take care of that before it gets out of hand, mate."
"Everything is perfect, Mummy," Sherlock whispers, holding tighter to Mrs. Holmes as his heart continues to turn over in his chest.
No one had ever asked him to coffee. No one ever asked him to do anything. He was approached for…
(See the end of the chapter for
"Oh, I
taking no concern with the incredible boy they were screwing around with, shattering and stomping all over his feelings, leaving him to pick up the pieces.
"Oh, love," John whispers. "God, don't… don't say my name like that."
"Fine, fine," Sherlock mumbled, strolling toward the back of the building, apparently happy to leave John standing alone.
Which John happily obliges him.
Then he's laughing and pulling Sherlock back in for another kiss. "Fair enough," he says. "Then I'll go on telling you how much I want you." John's lips trail along Sherlock's jaw to his neck. "How much I think about you," he whispers against his skin. He exhales against the shell of Sherlock's ear and licks the cartilage. "How much I enjoy sucking your cock. How delicious you taste when you come in my mouth."
draining from both their bodies. John could feel Sherlock settling against him, the tension in his shoulders loosening, and John practically melted under his touch.
"Come on, it's a bit poetic," John cackled, pulling Sherlock closer under the pillow. "The Holmes brothers both started relationships on the same night, assisting each other in the process. So romantic."
Lestrade looked a little confused and glanced between John and Sherlock then said, "Your…partner?"
"Perfect!" Victoria clapped her hands. "We'll sort it out for the week after Christmas then."
Conclusion: he couldn't have a relationship with John.
"No!"
Sherlock's eyelids flutter at the touch but he can't close his eyes. He can't look away.
"I-" Sherlock starts to protest, for some unknown reason, when John snorts.
"How's the diet, dear brother?" He retorted, turning his head back to ceiling.
Walking down an empty hotel hallway is always a little ominous and tonight feels no different as Sherlock grips his somewhat presumptuous overnight bag in his hand a bit tighter, the little contents of a jumper, a pair of jeans and a toothbrush shifting slightly as he picks up the pace, the keycard Greg had slipped him right after the game snug in his grip. He's not going to use it of course, the thought of barging in to John's room to 'surprise' him feeling a bit showy and obnoxious, especially after the ordeal his boyfriend has already been through this evening, but it is nice to have a key just in case.
, but he's almost positive she'd incapacitated him somehow, dragged his unconscious body across the university campus, and dropped him right into the stands that surround the rugby field because there is absolutely no bloody way Sherlock Holmes had gotten here on his own. No way had his own two feet carried him here willingly. Absolutely no way.
Will smiled wider. "Christ, you're even cuter up close."
"Are you going?" Sherlock asks coolly, seemingly daring John to answer one of two ways, one being right and the other very much wrong. Which is which, John doesn't know.
John freezes for half a second before he pulls back to fix Sherlock with wide eyes and a dropped jaw. "What?"
"I know," Sherlock replied grimly.
His lips are still scorching.
His body shivers slightly.
John froze, knowing he was missing something, knowing he must have just given something away about himself that only Sherlock could pick up on. He furrowed his brow, looking at everything except Sherlock, trying to figure it out, trying to-
"There we are," John grins and his thigh presses against Sherlock's, forcing a rather serious shiver to make its way down the curly-haired boy's spine. He thanks his past self for flipping the lights off before sitting down on the couch, effectively hiding the heat creeping into his cheeks.
It's when John says things like that Sherlock is almost certain.
To his credit, Greg, clearly well-versed in the Holmes' family dynamic by now, simply laughs and stands to introduce himself to John, dragging Mycroft by the hand along with him. Sherlock turns away, simply uninterested in the proceedings and attempting desperately to clamp down on the panic swirling inside him because this does not bode well for the…
John stared at the door for a long moment, trying to process what just happened. He ran a hand through his hair and rubbed his eyes, feeling quite out of sorts.
"I like you too," he whispers against Sherlock's lips with a grin, catching his lower lip and tugging. "And I do want to sleep with you. Trust me, I do. But I just… I want to be sure. I want it to be..."
John's body flooded with panic. "Sir?" he asked weakly.
. That would only be asking for trouble. That would be going down a very dangerous path. That would be stupid and sentimental. Two things Sherlock is very much not.
It's so much
John prods his finger in and out, back and forth, and just as Sherlock is getting used to it, he feels a stretch as a second finger slides in next to the first.
He can't look up.
John continues to undress him, and Sherlock complies, moving his limbs this way and that to accommodate.
His heart and his stomach seem to switch places as his entire body seems to roll, squirming and twisting until he has the very real fear of being sick.
"Making my way here, obviously," Mycroft replied airily. "How are you?"
. And John has no business taking up every night of his week with forced feedings and questions and, god help him,
Sherlock waves his hand in dismissal, feeling a nasty swoop of guilt in his gut for making John feel unwelcome. "N-no, it- it's fine." Even if he doesn't have time for distractions right now, he immediately decides he never wants to see that look on John's face again.
Precious locks shake gently as the genius boy nods. "This place is interesting."
"Well do you like him?"
"Er - hello," John says formally as his brows draw together in confusion, the scrutiny feeling like the weight of a bolder as his thoughts are still wholly focused on the cell in his hand.
Huffing out a soft laugh of his own, John shrugs, feeling the knot in his chest loosen slightly, feeling a bit better that he isn't alone. "I have no idea," he grumbles to the ceiling of the bus and Greg sighs beside him.
me," Paul complains with a half-hearted shove at Mike's side. "Ugh and you smell by the way."
Something about those four words charges the air in the small space between them. Sherlock holds his gaze, searching for those words to mean something he can understand. Something he can work with. Blue irises stare back at him, unblinking, pink lips parted below them as though John might say more, hesitating for an unknown reason.
Oh fuck, it's fucking
Sherlock frowns, glancing between her and the exit. "Leaving?"
," Irene squeals with renewed energy, note back in her hand as Sherlock deflates slightly, losing all conviction to his inattentive audience. She glances up to find Sherlock standing there with his notebook in hand. She frowns. "Oh, no," she shakes her head down at the apparently offensive binding of papers, "we're not doing our project. We're going to the game."
's and
Lestrade narrows his eyes. "Good to know you haven't changed a bit."
, the very real threat of Victor fucking Trevor lingering over his relationship with Sherlock Holmes and every fiber of his being screaming for him to dive into action, to glue himself to Sherlock's side, to hold the genius boy to his chest and only let go to long enough to beat Victor to a bloody pulp while spewing vicious, violent threats about him ever coming near Sherlock Holmes again.
He took a shaky step back, physically forcing himself to go through the facts, trying to reason with himself as the jealous beast within him roared savagely.
John's eyes fluttered open. "What-"
Paul laughs and bats his eyelashes at John. "Yes, John, please make her leave so I can make eyes at you, bro."
It's the only way this will end.
On the one hand, he's thankful for missing another embarrassing moment implying him and John as a couple.
"Hello Angelo," Sherlock tries not to laugh and fails, patting the owner's strong muscled back. "It's good to see you."
Mike rolled his eyes and looked back to Sherlock. "So? Go on then. Tell us."
He fails miserably.
John giggles again like watching Sherlock struggle to redeem himself from his snafu is the most endearing sight he's ever seen. He jerks his head back toward the car park. "Come on," he beckons. "I'll give you a lift."
"Okay... why exactly?"
And the curly-haired genius is just not ready for that to happen.
"I didn't want you to know," he suddenly sobs softly. "I didn't want to distract you from your training."
Sherlock hums in reply. He shifts his weight to wrap himself further around John when something hard hits his belly.
"No, really, I-" Sherlock goes to deny again, the volume of his voice on the way to rising with sheer irritation before the wheels in his head start turning once more, catching up with the conversation and halting the words from escaping his mouth, a fine rush of panic shimmying down his spine, all feelings of testiness slowly waning away as realization sweeps in and replaces it.
And again.
how it started.
He can't even speak properly.
Rolling his eyes at the obvious sidestep of the question, John grabs his keys and nods, reaching for Sherlock's hand with a smile. "Let's do it."
"Unfortunately," Sherlock sighs, starting off in the direction of their dorm, John trailing behind. "She's coming to Mike's tonight."
He can't help it. The laugh slips from his lips before he can stop it, barking out sharply at his ridiculous roommate, grinning as Sherlock grins right back. "I'll try to remember that for next time," John giggles, shaking his head fondly at that beautiful boy sitting at his desk chair. "Anyway, I need to go grab dinner still, is Indian still-"
"That's true," John says, turning his damp face up toward the ceiling as if considering. "I mean I did snog my bloody gorgeous roommate senseless last night. That was pretty ridiculous."
The patrons had clearly been stunned into silence until this point because suddenly there was a burst of noise, cheers and hollers ringing out as Sherlock's fingers reached the hem of his shirt.
"Oh my
What John also doesn't like, beyond the fact that Sherlock's lips and body will not be anywhere near him for the better part of a day, is that Sherlock in general will be away from him. And after what happened yesterday, John isn't ashamed to admit that it makes him a little nervous to have Sherlock out of his sight. It sets his teeth on edge a bit, sending Sherlock off into the world unprotected and unguarded.
John nodded dumbly.
Everything seems to go deadly silent and still even as a uni party rages on in the other room. Senses going on high alert, John responds in an equally low tone. "What did you hear?"
Deep down, he knew he was overreacting but after the spat they'd had earlier, John felt uneasy.
Don't take the bait.
John's brow furrows immediately. "What?"
"I'm sorry, John - I- I'm too wound up, I'm too... I can't- I'll come if you keep doing that, I swear I will, I will come-"
"I'm off for my run. Let me know if you want to stop being boring and come hang out with me."
"You're kidding me," John glares, ignoring the way his body is heating up at the sight of his gorgeous boyfriend somehow always being surprisingly unbelievably good at everything they do together. The first night they played Beer Pong together flashes brightly in John's mind and he knows he shouldn't be smiling like he is considering his team just got scored on, but recognizing the difference between true random luck and skill in two different situations just makes John fall even harder for this boy. "You just distracted me to get a sodding goal."
"Hm," John hums in reply, feeling slightly queasy at the influx of information.
Well that right there is telling enough.
Good.
But not before he sees Dolly.
"You should get credit. It's amazing what you do. You can do the police's job better then them. Why don't you become a full-on detective? Why are you even doing your chemistry degree?"
"I didn't know," Sherlock mutters, "I saw." Normally, the
with the rugby player that lives in his dorm room?
John's face doesn't flinch. He doesn't move a muscle. He simply stares.
"That's evidence!" Lestrade's voice rang out from a car that had pulled up to the curb. "Jesus you two, you can't run off like that. And don't
And John will turn on him.
"Very well," a soft, almost familiar voice replied from within.
Clearly, he'd been wrong.
Sherlock glanced up to find John's blonde head peering around the door of his office, smiling brightly, his blue eyes sparkling in the afternoon light.
"Where are you going?"
"Ah, of course," Sherlock replied, reaching for the buttons on his shirt and slowly undoing them.
Sherlock frowned. "On the contrary, John. You're quite interesting."
Sherlock Holmes.
"Cheeky git," John giggles, prodding fingers into Sherlock's side and pulling a yelp from his mouth. "All the surprises. Every single one was fantastic."
"Rule-breaking."
So he pushes a bit more.
Sherlock wants to crawl into bed with the man he hasn't seen in months, find his usual position, with John's hand up his shirt against his stomach and John's lips pressed to his ear.
"Ughn!" John cried, throwing his forearm over his mouth and sinking his teeth into the skin, something like liquid fire rippling through him, flooding him in euphoric bliss.
really good, hardly even twinging anymore, the bruising finally toning down to a dull yellowish green. "I threw a ball today and the trainer said I can start tackling again in a few days. Should be ready to rock for the game next weekend."
He runs out of the stables, preparing to scream for Mrs. Hudson or Lestrade or someone to tell him where Dolly is, when he sees a figure galloping toward him from the distance.
difficult.
Happy without being in love with Sherlock.
," Sherlock shuts up him with a snipped order, though it hardly hinders John's laughter to Sherlock's dismay.
John's heart stutters in his chest and he's suddenly coming to a conclusion; a giggling Sherlock Holmes is an
"See what?" Sherlock grumbles as he stands, his height putting his gaze high above those in front of him.
it feels so delightfully naughty, dirty dancing in a crowd of strangers like the best kind of wrong and John licks at the bead of sweat trickling down Sherlock's spine, his tongue finding its way into Sherlock's ear.
And really, John should be rather ashamed of himself. This boy he now rooms with... well, he is a
Sherlock can't decide if that makes him feel better or worse to put a name to the face he's been thinking about all day.
John wasn't listening. John wasn't bloody
John wants to keep this a secret.
Sherlock huffs a sigh and glances down the street. "You're kidnapping me outside of a police station."
"You're very... chipper." Sherlock raised an eyebrow and again, John laughed. It was an infuriatingly nice noise.

Sherlock did not look amused. "No, on
The frown remains on that round, adorable face. "Uh-" John glances quickly at the calendar on his desk, "it's Tuesday."
Of course, the nerves had slipped freely away after John had jimmied open the door with his elbow and come face to face with giant green eyes staring back at him from beneath large plastic safety goggles, the rubbery fastenings pulled tight around dark curls, forcing them to stick out on all sides and making the boy wearing them look impossibly young and a little insane and fucking adorable.
"Mmhmm," Sherlock hummed against his skin. "I imagine you're out in the crowd, watching me. I dance for you, John."
Which is absolutely
He'd never had any interest in it but now...
Biting his tongue so sharply he swears he tastes blood, Sherlock keeps his mouth firmly shut as the very real fear of a guffaw is threatening to make its way out of it.
"What?"
"Am I also an idiot?" John asked without thinking but this conversation was getting out of control.
Today there are symbols of love littering every inch of the school hallway and there are reds and pinks and purples a glittering representation of romance and there are fake flowers and paper hearts all obvious signs of relationships and Sherlock just can't do it. Not today. Not this year. Not when the last twelve months have been nothing but hell for the genius boy's feelings and libido and
, I've just been in the library and the labs! Where do you get the nerve asking me stupid things like that?"
Lonely.
And finally, Sherlock has the wherewithal to be himself. He yanks his sleeve out of Irene's grasp and narrows his eyes at her as he pops an irritated eyebrow at her. "I'm fine, thank you," he barks, though he does drop back down into his seat, the heat of embarrassment creeping up his neck as he winces at the pressure in his pants. He looks away from her and out to an empty patch of green grass on the field, attempting to keep his thoughts clear and avoid another mishap like the one he'd just experienced. "And I wasn't staring," he half-heartedly argues. "I was just watching like the rest of the crowd. Isn't that what you're supposed to do at these things?"
The nickname makes Sherlock's stomach lurch in revulsion but still he can't seem to move, too stunned at the notion of his deepest secret being known by such a vile human being, in too much pain as the truth of the matter is shoved in his face, a truth he thought was safe in his own head.
It's been glorious.
to me."
John cleared his throat. "Maybe I… Maybe I ask Sherlock? To go with me? Like…as my date? Or something? Not like outright, but maybe just mention it… And see what he says?"
John climbs back over him, settling an elbow next to Sherlock's head and Sherlock feels the tip of his gloved erection pushing against his entrance.
"Oh for godsake, I'm not his bloody keeper," John rolls his eyes, ignoring the warmth blooming in his chest as he considers the fact that he essentially just vowed to take care of Sherlock. Because he does want that. He does want to take care of Sherlock so much, even as he practically denies his feelings to Sherlock's brother.
The heavy sigh elicited from John's lips was his only answer.
"Oh for godsake," Sherlock grouses from where he stands off to the right of Greg, glaring daggers over his shoulder. "Must he? I'd all but forgotten he was here until now."
Sherlock ignores the ache in his chest and instead focuses on the game he needs to win, much like his prize is currently doing.
But John notices it.
John barks out a laugh. "Are you woo-able, Sherlock Holmes?"
being tipped forward by strong muscles tugging the jersey down and Sherlock along with it, down into the open space between the roommate's heights, the space Sherlock has never dreamed to breach for fear of being too close, down into territory of John Watson's face and John Watson's breath and John Watson's lips.
And now it's over.
John turned and ducked down, sliding the paper underneath the door with shaking fingers and as much dignity as he could muster, hardly daring to breathe. He could feel Victor's eyes on him.
"I'll be back in a bit, I'm going to go catch up with the team real quick," John offers, attempting to soothe the soft wrinkle that's formed between Sherlock's beautiful eyes without running his thumb along it.
He's momentarily startled by the swell of cheers seeming to be coming from all around him in the small area as the boys cheer
Sherlock whimpers.
"John, do you have any idea how many times Myc has tried to get through to Sherlock about things? About
Waits for it all to come crashing down.
John's heart physically aches in his chest. The Gallows look. Well isn't that perfectly fitting?
"Can I?" John murmurs into the darkness, fingers tightening in Sherlock's hair ever so slightly, emphasizing his whispered plea, and Sherlock's body melts under the touch.
that Sherlock didn't even think he was capable of. He had no idea that Sherlock's world was slowly becoming revolved around him entirely, that every moment they'd spent together had changed Sherlock in some fundamental way, so subtle that not even a genius could see it until it was broken, battered and sobbing into his chest. That an entire week away from this boy had left him lost and a little mad, following him around like some crazed stalker, determining his habits, hoping he'd yet again show up at his office, holding two coffees and grinning at the prospect of spending more time with Sherlock.
Sherlock laughs. "Lookin' good, Mike."
"I'm sure it was difficult for you not to...react."
He's barely aware of his hand dropping his half empty cup. He's barely aware of Greg asking if he's alright. He's barely aware of Molly eyeing him suspiciously.
"Everyone ready?" Greg calls from the center, football beneath his right foot as his team replies loudly, clapping and hooting and hollering like a bunch of bloody lunatics. "Alright then! Myc, love, would you do the honors of the send-off?"
Then John started giggling. It started as a soft huff behind Sherlock's hand and began to build, stomach muscles clenching.
Panic seizes Sherlock's chest. "Was it just a joke?" He whispers weakly. "Were you just…just teasing me?"
"Oh please!" Sherlock cries. "That is such bullocks I can't even-"
John is the epitome of coziness. He's warmth and safety and cups of tea and crap telly. He's funny and kind and silently strong, always up for a laugh but never at anyone's expense. He's easy-going but quietly fierce, always carefully watching his surroundings, always aware without being noticeable.
John must have told him.
The second thing John wondered was how quickly he could wrestle Sherlock into bed after this case wrapped up, how quickly he could divest him of that coat and those gloves and the whole outfit he had on and press naked flesh to naked flesh for another go.
"Leave it Sherlock." He balled his fists, trying to control himself as he glared at his older sister. "Thank you for dropping in on my life and throwing all this shit at me, I really do appreciate it. But don't you dare speak to Sherlock like that. Yes, he cares for me and supports me, unlike my family members. I'm sorry you have such a fucked up view of the world, and I get it Harry, I really do. We're both bred from the same pair of miserable people, so I get that you went that way but I didn't. I chose to grow the fuck up and try to find something worthwhile in my life and become something of myself, and I got lucky enough to have found someone that I love in the process. So don't you come here and try to fuck all that up just because life dealt you a shitty deck of cards. I got the same hand, and I'm going to do my damndest to make the best of them."
He's being snogged by John Watson.
"You're home… you're home," Sherlock is whispering and even to his own ears his words sound disbelieving and wondrous as though he'd imagined another scenario. Which, in fact, he had. One where John Watson played for a team that wasn't England. One where they never made it back to London, Sherlock following John across the continent to chase his dream. And Sherlock's heart would have followed dutifully. If that's what John wanted, if that's where his road had taken him, Sherlock and his 'Property of John Watson' stamped heart would have tagged along.
"Nothing," Sherlock mumbles, suddenly finding something interesting in the text on his laptop, refusing to turn back around.
John starts walking, lacing his fingers with Sherlock's and pulling him along. "You said following the rules helps you keep the things that are important to you in your life. What things?"
," John continues, his soft voice somehow sounding harsh – almost rough in the darkness. "God help me, I did. But seeing you today… I can't, Sherlock."
Something like worry flashes through green eyes before Sherlock masks it with indifference, a cool blankness that doesn't fool John Watson for a moment, trained all too well by now in the features of his boyfriend. "Well. I wouldn't overdo it," Sherlock says haughtily, inspecting a spot of balled fabric along the comforter like this conversation doesn't interest him in the least, refusing to look anywhere near John. "You never know what kinds of injuries can go acting up again later on."
"Of course," Sherlock grumbles indignantly. "My hands are for one person only."
"SHERLOCK HOLMES! Don't make me come in there and pull the covers off you because you
at you."
But this.
All the time.
The aborted sentences all add up to the same thing; while Sherlock has been panicking about what John thinks they are, John has gone ahead and assumed. And assumed the best possible assumption in the history of assumptions.
"Anything," is the immediate response from the boy beneath him, practically moaning as Sherlock traces a pink nipple, biting his lip as he watches it pebble to hardness before he drags a finger pad over top it, swallowing his own groan as John squirms. "Fuck,
here. He should be the one taking her out. He should be the one on her back while she gallops freely along the property.
Sherlock shakes his head.
"Sure it was."
Sherlock scoffs but crawls out of the car anyway, hands shaking on the handle.
And the second being that Sherlock Holmes just might really believe that John Watson is beautiful.
John's eyebrows shot up immediately. It had been a long time since Greg had fancied anyone. "Really?"
A ripple of rage rolled through Sherlock. "He's not nice to Mrs. Hudson, is he," he murmured low and furious.
He doesn't remember sliding a gold band onto Sherlock's ring finger while he slept against John's chest. He doesn't remember murmuring
So he's been watching.
"Yeah, you probably have it worse than I do," John shrugs, "I'm not technically getting the silent treatment… I don't think, at least. He's probably just busy."
"Oh god," John breathes from where he sits on his knees, hand still wrapped around Sherlock's cock, stroking it lightly and lovingly as he stares upward. "Are- are you sure? I… Christ I would love to see you under me like that, love, but just… I just need you to be sure before we-"
"What would you like me to do with this information you have given me?" Sherlock asked, waiving the notepad at him and trying to move past the images flying around in his mind.
John resists the urge to laugh and turns back to the elder Holmes, who is looking between the two of them with a mix of curiosity and confusion.
Sherlock doesn't laugh.
John nods. He does in fact have to do orientation but it doesn't help the disappointed swoop in John's stomach. He wants to stay near this dark, beautiful boy. He wants to talk to him and make him blush again. He wants to see what happens when he gets him alone.
"Funny lookin', maybe," Paul counters before pounding a fist against the door. "Come on John, up you get! We were instructed not to leave here until you get your arse up and come with us!"
"O-oh g-
"Shut up," Sherlock grumbles, fighting hard against a grin of his own and failing spectacularly.
But that all changed the night he met Victor Trevor. Victor Trevor who was rather irritatingly good-looking and held all the confidence in the world and didn't find anything threatening about John Watson at all if his eager, hungry stare in Sherlock's direction had been any indication. Even then, even in that short, few-sentence interaction, John had known exactly what Victor's intentions were.
Sherlock had to fight down the smile he wanted to return. He liked this stronger almost flirty John. He knew he had it in him, and it killed Sherlock to admit he was excited to see him out. He forced himself to keep his cool demeanor. He couldn't let John know how he was making Sherlock feel. "Again, Mr. Watson, I had a specific goal in mind last night. I did what was necessary to meet that goal."
"Hey," John murmurs into his curls. "Hey love."
Sherlock smiled genuinely at him. "Very good, John. I knew you'd be thinking ahead. But don't worry about that."
John laughs.
William and Mycroft sat deep in conversation, William laughing gayly while his eldest son smiled, seeming quietly amused.
He places his hands against John's chest, feeling the rise and fall as he breathes deeply, air stuttering out as Sherlock's fingers dance lightly along his pectorals. "I want to do something," he finds himself murmuring, mesmerized by the tanned skin beneath his hands fluttering under his touch.
," he emphasized and John laughed. "The deductions…they can be very useful for the police when they're stalled on a case. I'm able to lend my assistance when they request it."
"You know I'm your friend, right?" Irene suddenly murmurs from behind him, snapping Sherlock out of his thoughts and back to the present where he's currently staring at the cursor on his laptop.
Nipping and licking and sucking, John moves with purpose, and Sherlock props himself up on his elbows to watch from beneath hooded eyes which promptly fall closed as John's lips press against his bare hip, tongue flicking out to lick along the dip of his pelvis.
In truth, things could have been different. Things could have been unspoken and laid to rest, festering but never becoming more than they were. Nothing more than notices and glances and shy smiles, occasional brushes of fingers or bumps of legs.
He glances at the curly-haired boy who is staring back at him, excitement and fear mixed clearly in his pretty now-blue eyes, wanting and yet reluctant to venture out into unknown territory with unknown people, somehow silently pleading with John to help without actually asking for it.
So Sherlock will be John's someone. And the Holmes family will be John's people. So what if it's difficult for Sherlock to see his flatmate become a part of the family in no further capacity than a friend? So what if it makes it a little harder to breathe for the curly-haired boy, knowing this wonderful person will never be anything more than his friend? So what? He can deal with it. John
His roommate didn't move a muscle. He lay still on his bed, fingers pressed together under his chin. "John," he acknowledged.
"Pleasures all mine, John," she smiles back. They both glance at Sherlock.
"Tell me what?"
Sherlock's eyes fluttered closed for a moment, pushing into John's touch. "Yes," he murmured back, pulling John into his arms. "Yes, it's alright."
And later that night, as Sherlock laid him down in the sheets of their bed and slid deep into his body, John forgot about the hateful world around them and focused on his own world. His own world gliding in and out of him in slow waves, whispering endearments and tender words and love, protecting John from the cruelness of real life. John let himself be taken, holding on to the man hovering above him, murmuring his own affections and promises, begging for deeper, harder, closer. And when they both came, it was just as beautiful as the first time they'd come together, so many years ago, hidden away in Sherlock's room, touching and holding and loving.
But he just wants to look one more time…
Sherlock replays what he just said back in his mind then freezes. "Nothing," he murmurs, eyes wide. "Never mind." He turns hard on his heel and attempts to take off, but a strong hand wraps around his wrist.
"It's been four wonderful years, Sherlock. Don't you think we should have a nice celebration? Some way to commemorate our time together? Four beautiful years of delusions?"
It was Sherlock's turn to roll his eyes. Mycroft raised a challenging eyebrow in response.
He knows better than to believe
Whipping around with a glare already angrily plastered to his face, John stares furiously into Irene Adler's cool, assessing eyes as she leans nonchalantly in the doorway, eyeing the moment between teammates with something like irritation.
Sherlock rolled his eyes. "'All the people,'" he mimicked bitterly. "Like I bring everyone I meet to crime scenes."
"I'll be teaching Victor Chemistry, John," Sherlock replies dubiously as he slings his bag onto his shoulder. "I can promise you, it won't be fun."
It breaks Sherlock's heart all over again.
John sat down on the shower floor again, remembering Sherlock picking him up off the concrete, dragging him to the street, holding him in the car that took them home, tucking him into bed.
Soft lamplight filters into the room from the streetlights outside, the night quiet and calm and just like any other as Sherlock crawls into bed beside his boyfriend, stripped down to a t-shirt and pants like always, back pressing to John's front as he settles in.
To file away in a room he plans to lock up and throw away the key, never to be seen or heard from again.
"Agreed," John chuckles, plucking at a button on Sherlock's hoodie as his gaze travels down the rest of the genius boy's slender frame, taking in the damp and drooping clothing and furrowing his brow just the slightest before glaring up at his partner. "I see we didn't wear a coat again," he admonishes, pointing at Sherlock's chest. "Honestly, what is it with you and no coats?"
John smiles softly as he retrieves Sherlock’s shirt from the floor and helps him slip it over his head. He pulls him in for another slow kiss before wrapping his arm around his waist and leading him to the door.
Sherlock obeys. Soon, John's hips are bucking shallow thrusts and Sherlock is meeting them, finding a rhythm as John squirms beneath him.
"Lieutenant!"
Sherlock furrows his brow. "What? Why would you ever-" He freezes as John's face turns red with mirth. "Oh. You're joking."
Happy without being married to Sherlock.
At long last, he forced himself to move. John was simply kissing someone. He wasn't in any danger. He wasn't being hurt. Snogging some random person wouldn't ruin his life. He'd be fine.
The notes have only continued to be perfect.
John's eyes darken.
"Smooth," Sherlock grumbled and John grinned.
Sherlock turns to the toaster to hide his blush. "He had to get home."
This is...
And just like that, the voices fade to nothing but a dull, garbled roar behind a closed door, shutting out the rest of Greg's sentence and the thought process Sherlock was attempting to make about the conversation at hand.
"No," John sighed, "I had the pleasure of finding out from Mycroft."
In the looks department, this guy could rival Sherlock.
"Which, by the way," Mike points his finger in John's direction, "I'm a bit offended that I didn't get invited onto this task force of yours. Like what the hell?"
Two long miserable days without laying eyes on John Watson and Sherlock wonders if he's going mad as he hurries to school early, hoping he can catch a glimpse of blue eyes before the dreadful day starts and he won't see him until after both their practices are over. Of course, he's heard from John, a couple text messages over the weekend, but it's done nothing to soothe his racing thoughts.
John was sure his eyes were doing slow somersaults. Almost positive. Or maybe they were just doing a little shimmy. Just shaking away like he had been on the dance floor earlier. Oh the dancing he'd done. Was there even a dance floor? Maybe it was just a loud bar? Hm. Odd.
It physically hurts him not to follow.
"Great game!" Irene calls in false pleasantry, smiling brightly and, god help him, knowingly.
"Oh really?" John inquires, glowering right back at him. "What did he say?"
"I think you'd better find out tonight," Greg drops down beside him. "I won't be there but keep me in the loop, yeah? Myc said something similar about Victor being a bad guy but I thought he was just being an overprotective big brother, you know? But now… Now I don't know what to think."
"It's the second week of school, Mike."
It had been so easy last time. Sherlock had initiated, surprised him, and it all fell into place. John hadn't even had to worry about where his hands went or what Sherlock was doing. It was hard to think about logistics when someone's hand was on your cock.
Exhaling through his nose in irritation, Sherlock rolls his eyes and looks back at his book in front of him, trying and failing not to be completely humiliated. He should have seen that, should have been able to tell that Irene is gay. Stupid,
Those three words somehow soothed John. Soothed and terrified him, suddenly having no urge to run but to curl up as close to Sherlock as he could manage and hide away from the world forever. "What are we going to do?" John whispered, voice cracking slightly in distress, only just realizing how unbelievably complicated this was. Because John wasn't done. Not now. Not when he'd just found out it would be like this. Not when he'd just discovered that Sherlock would be like this. So loving and careful and protective. Not when he'd just discovered Sherlock could make him feel like
If he hadn't gotten used to this feeling by now, John would have sworn the temperature in the cab had risen ten degrees. He rubbed a sweaty palm down his thigh, trying to calm his body down. It was entirely unfair that Sherlock could say such simple things to him and have them fall out of his mouth in the most sensual way possible. Fuck, the things it did to John. Why weren't they sleeping together again? John swallowed, doing his best to sooth his suddenly dry throat.
"Is that vodka?" Sherlock is suddenly, wildly, on alert, the glass looking more ominous now that he believes it's not filled with harmless water, insides lurching with the memory of the last time he had alcohol in him, the drink in front him not looking one bit enticing.
"And I'm not…I deny being gay because I'm not gay. I'm bi. And I deny we're a couple because I didn't want it to upset you if people thought we were. And…and I just thought maybe you'd found someone and were hiding it from me."
"You still think you're getting better at observing?" Sherlock teases as Mike wanders off to gather beers for the table.
John finds himself grinning right back, the familiarity of his best campmate and the start of summer something he'd longed for all year long. The heat is something he always has to get used to, living in London during the school year, but it's worth the acclimation to be back here again. He dreams about this place for months on end, having attended sleep away camp since he was a boy, finding the ten weeks away from city lights is like living in a whole other world. He loves it here. It's not that he has anything against London - he loves it there too. But there is something about warm, starry nights and clear blue skies that just gets to John. That makes him so unbelievably happy.
Mouth parting on an inaudible gasp, Sherlock's pupils dilate, gaze dropping to John's lips without hesitation. "I'm always yours," he murmurs.
"Are you mad at me?" Sherlock's features crease further. "I'm so sorry John, really, I know you were right, I shouldn't have even gone, I'm sorry-"
He can barely process them all.
Sherlock is so caught up in John and Dolly and late afternoon runs that he barely has thought about it himself.
John opens his eyes and pulls back to look at the boy beneath him, double check to make sure all is well, and what he finds is so utterly breathtaking John has to take a moment.
Sherlock had to remind himself that while breathing was boring it was necessary for his life and he sucked in a deep inhale.
, Sherlock.
He already wants to do it again.
Without Sherlock.
But maybe a bit dirtier than John had anticipated.
"What things?" Greg shoots back with a step forward, followed by Mike and Paul, closing in around John like a protective knot, offering assistance and friendship and anything John may need like the incredibly kind people that they are. "Come on, Johnny, Sherlock is practically my family, if there is something wrong you need to-"
But John doesn't disappear. John stays put, blue eyes shining, bottom lip trembling slightly.
"Mm," John hums half-heartedly, decidedly less interested in hearing about Sherlock's painful teenage years. No wonder he'd been reluctant to spend any time with John's teammates. He was probably certain they'd be cruel. Everyone else in Sherlock's life clearly had been. And he didn't have any fucking parents to help. John could relate to being parentless, hell he was practically parentless himself, but John had always been lucky enough to be liked in school. He'd never had issues with friendships or bullies, always the bloke most people liked immediately. It was easy for him.
John's brow furrowed. "So why did you let me see you do it then?"
But Sherlock smiled that soft, reverent smile of his, and closed his eyes, finding John's lips again, pressing and pulling, licking his way into his mouth and touching his frame with such gentleness.
Now watching the exchange between him and his father, John warmed all over at the thought that maybe Sherlock liked to cuddle and walk hand in hand just as much as John did. And that feeling was very nice.
"Are you guys training for something specific?" John asks curiously, glancing down at Sherlock's black pointe shoes laced up his ankle tied with a bow in the back.
He can't do it.
"Have you been talking to Mycroft?"
But he won't.
things to John. Things that have been happening non-stop since Sherlock has come into his life.
"Put your bag inside, we're heading out."
Sherlock is nodding, unable to speak, unable to
He turns Balthazar around, catching Mrs. Hudson's eye as she stands at the fence.
"What do you want, John?" Sherlock asked breathlessly as he turned John in his arms, looking down in his eyes fiercely. "What do you want with me?"
And looks at Sherlock with those now unseeing eyes. Those eyes that now look at Sherlock with uncertain sympathy and confusion and attempts at not pitying but missing the mark by a mile.
There's a dip in the bed as John kneels behind him. Sherlock looks down between his legs, seeing John's hand slide lube over his cock for only a moment before it disappears behind him.
Both in their third years at university, Sherlock has been living with John in a nice flat on Baker Street in the heart of London for nearly five months now and in those five months John has somehow inserted himself into every aspect of Sherlock's life. He has no idea when that happened or how it happened but John Watson simply seems to be a part of him now; his flatmate, his study buddy, the person he eats takeaway with every weekend, the friend he attends social events with. He's the person Sherlock has found himself confiding in,
The perfect ending to the worst day of his life.
, Sherlock," Irene teases at his left elbow, exaggeratingly pointing her finger toward the giant red billboard at the other end of the field, taking great delight in the fact that Sherlock seems to know nothing about sports. "Can you say
John stalked off without waiting for a response.
Things he didn't even think he wanted.
Refused to remember. Refused to acknowledge.

"Sherlock, hey." Victor Trevor is breathing a bit heavily, shoulders rising and falling as though he'd just run a great distance in search of something, though the smile on his face looks like he's found what he was looking for.
"Shut up," Sherlock snaps, pausing before biting out a, "Fine."
Classes had gone by as nothing more than dull sounds around him as Sherlock stayed slunk in his seat, staring off into the abyss and wondering how he's going to survive without what he had for the first and last time the previous night.
John looked away. He couldn't look into those eyes anymore. Couldn't hear words like that come out of that mouth anymore. He couldn't
Arms are wrapping around him, kisses are falling to every inch of his body, hands are finding their way into his hair. Familiar arms. Familiar lips. Familiar hands.
Sherlock swiped his fingers over his eyes and sniffed. "You might be right."
"Yeah, no shit," John giggled.
And then the game will end.
delectable," Irene croons, a spark of mischief gleaming in her eyes. "Just because I have no interest in purchasing the rose doesn't mean I can't smell it."
"I know," Sherlock replies, because he does know, John would never purposefully hurt him.
Heart warming at the happy little glow in John's cheeks, Sherlock works on his own cookie in the shape of a Christmas tree, decorating it with little star sprinkles and generally making a mess. It's one of the Holmes' traditions he loves; decorating cookies on Christmas Eve, though if he's being honest, his love for this has only heightened with John being here to enjoy it with him. Even after the confusing events of the previous night, nothing seemed to be amiss this morning through breakfast or the afternoon of baking and chatting with the family, so Sherlock is planning to simply sweep it under the rug. It's the holiday spirit, he thinks. It must make some people do crazy things. Besides, John is entirely overwhelmed in the best way possible with all the family surrounding him, taking him in as one of their own. He probably just got a little too comfortable with Sherlock. Or maybe it was the rum.
"Well I could have told you that," Greg snips with a glare.
There had been no sign of Sherlock.
to help him with, and how John was the best friend he'd ever had.
"No, no," Sherlock murmured quietly. "Couch. I love my couch."
A John Watson who touches him and holds him.
John throws up his hands in mock defense. "My bad," he says far too innocently. "I was just cheering on the champion."
get in cars with strangers?" His voice was shrill with panic, feeling as though he were trapped, his fragile emotional state surging him into unstable territory.
Or maybe like he has no other choice than to do what he does next.
"I would never lie about that," John all but whispered. "I meant-"
John watches and then says, "I hear you're smart."
Sherlock freezes.
scrawled across the door, fairy lights hanging unevenly from the ceiling and twinkling in the window above an empty table placed strategically for ample city viewing. He can't help offering a small smile at the tiny hole-in-the-wall restaurant he knows so well.
Hanging his head, allowing the tears to drop straight from his eyes to the tiled floor, careful not to get any salty water on the jersey hanging off his shoulders, Sherlock's body somehow feels calmer, snuggly wrapped in the cotton of the boy he adores so much, fiddling with the hem of the front with shaky fingers, not realizing that putting this on would tear him right in two. The one half of him has his heart shaking in his chest at the feeling of this beloved item of clothing finally touching his skin, soothing every part of his body with the softness of it, with the idea that John wears this, that John owns this, that Sherlock wishes so much that he could actually physically become this jersey. Then he could stay with John. Always.
"Except to Victor," John growled. "Don't be nice to Victor."
That's what Sherlock wants. He wants John
And preening.
Sherlock bites back a growl. No reason to upset his horse when he knows this is his fault.
After turning the taps on in the shower, Sherlock prods John gently down on the closed toilet seat, ignoring the protests of his boyfriend claiming he can do things himself, and kneels in front of him, setting to work on slowly unwrapping the ice pack from the rugby player's shoulder with methodical, efficient movements, careful to preserve the wrap for later when John will need to ice again. It takes far longer than he'd thought it would and by the time he's peeling the pack off of John's skin the rugby player has gone all soft around the eyes, grinning adoringly down at Sherlock between his knees, the need to fight every effort of help Sherlock offers completely dissipating, blue irises now only holding warmth and fondness and the genius boy is practically glowing in response, blushing under the attention.
There was something familiar about it and something… nice. Like someone who lived here was loved and cared for.
And just like that John's heart is bursting with so much fondness it's making it hard to breathe, watching this precious boy grumble around in his bed, tired eyes soft and sweet, chaotic ringlets all over the place and John just can't help himself, making his way over to the genius boy and gathering him up in his arms, sliding Sherlock on his knees to the edge of the bed where John is standing, pressing them chest to chest, and John buries his face in Sherlock's neck.
"I'm helping make sure you don't get yourself in a bad situation," Irene hisses back, throwing her hands up in the air incredulously. "Look, I've heard some weird stuff about Victor, okay? I just want you to be safe."
John's cheeks burned again and he shifted his weight to his other foot. "I-I don't... I don't know." Then John found his voice. Finally. "I mean you catch me blatantly staring at you, come over here and save me from a potentially friendship ruining mistake, and give me some sound advice. And all I've done is stare at you like a bloody moron."
John's allowed to date whoever he wants.
"Yeah," Sherlock nods quickly, wishing Victor would stop asking already and move on to a new topic. He reaches for his book in his bag and feels the couch shift beneath him as another body settles onto it and Sherlock's shoulders relax, hoping maybe the worried friend game is over and they can get to work. "Alright, so which chapter did you want to work on?"
"Tell me if you want me to stop," Sherlock said seriously as he pulled himself up to his knees and ran his hands over John's clothed chest.
A loud, sharp bang rang out through the small flat and John's fingers froze in their movements, eyes shooting up to find an equally frightened Sherlock.
"Johnny!" Mike cheers in triumph and slaps a hand to Paul's back. "We got him up!"
Sherlock take his cock in his mouth, faced flushed a dark red, lips bitten-pink and gaping just below deeply blue eyes taking in everything before him, knuckles stark white where they're clenched into the sheets, the rugby player looking the part of a boy wrapped up in ecstasy so exquisitely it makes Sherlock's erection throb against the mattress.
he's hit the nail right on the head, that he's said the words Sherlock's been thinking internally and terrified of anyone ever saying, before the arsehole is finally turning away. Sherlock stands a bit straighter, no longer cowed against cold metal as the bully before him slinks back but not before he delivers one last parting shot tossed over his shoulder, loud enough for the rest of the group to hear, loud enough to make Sherlock want to shrink in on himself all over again. "Pathetic little virgin. You're such a fucking freak."
The door swings open with the force of someone either very excited or very drunk, rattling the metal knocker and flooding the quiet porch with the sounds of voices and music and laughter and warmth.
"What's up 92 percent!" John's happy voice filters into Sherlock's ears as he slams a piece of paper down on the library table.
Sherlock whimpers, propping himself up on his elbows to reach John's lips. "B-But I... I already..." Sherlock tries but John covers his mouth with his own.
"Boys," John nods in greeting before turning to grin up into his roommate's eyes, simultaneously lacing their fingers together in such an achingly familiar and intimate way like they've done every night in bed for the last six nights, and tucking their joined hands between their bodies. "You all remember my boyfriend Sherlock, yeah?"
Sherlock stops breathing altogether.
"Oi, what the fuck?" John demands, tossing his hands up in the air and steadfastly ignoring Sherlock's amused eyebrow raise in his direction. "Why do you get the first pick?"
Third off: SMUT IS A-COMIN FOLKS! I PROMISE!
"I'll take that as a yes then," Irene smirks, watching the flicker of heated emotions play across Sherlock's features at the mere mention of his dormmate's rugby jersey.
"Well," he murmurs to the wall, forcing himself to relax and ignore the stunning boy in front of him murmuring the kindest of words.
John leaned against the new strong surface holding him up. "Why did he leave? He was handsome."
Sherlock just
Seven days has done nothing to cool John's bitter dislike towards this vile human-being.
Sherlock's own stomach flutters.
of patience Sherlock as ever possessed? Repressing the urge to pinch the bridge of his nose in irritation, deciding since this may now be his only male friend in the world, Sherlock carefully works to smooth his features into something of a blank mask as he follows Victor inside, deciding that he'd better put in an effort and play nice. Or neutral. Whichever he can manage. "No, Victor, I didn't run here."
Sherlock wonders more often then he should what it would be like to ride her. To saddle her up, take her out into the clearing and let her run. Feel the thrill of this magnificent creature's hooves pounding beneath him, free of restraints.
He watches John's face closely, thrilled when John's breath stutters or a small whimper escapes his lips.
With an irritating sigh, Mycroft says, "He's dangerous, Sherlock. You need to be careful."
things to him like never before.
This is why he and Irene make such good friends. They dance together, they have much in common and they have no attraction to one another. However, while Sherlock knows his place in school, on the side of the artists and outcasts, Irene seems to toe the line. She doesn't fall to one side or the other, having friends in both groups and she is more than tolerated by all. She says it's due to her wicked good looks and sensual personality. Sherlock thinks it has more to do with her being the life of the party every weekend.
(See the end of the chapter for
"You're right, I don't. You're getting scammed by a rugby player and a bully. Tough luck, Sherlock."
He feels relaxed.
with not having sex with me?" Sherlock bites back in return. "Did you even want to?"
"Oh, right," John said, shaking his head. "Sorry, I didn't know if you were talking to me or not. I'm new."
Not anymore.
"Yeah," Sherlock calls back, turning a pointed look at John. "And I learned how to hustle."
Of course, all those thoughts come to an abrupt halt as John turns.
John furrows his brow. "Okay?"
"Easy there, killer," John laughs at Sherlock's haste, shaking his head fondly.
"Out of context!" John almost yelled, then immediately stopped himself. Sherlock exhaled quietly.
"Oh for God's sake, really I think it's time for you to get back to your room and go to sleep."
It's intoxicating, wanting someone like this. He's read all about teenage hormones and increased sex drives at a young age but this… no book discusses this. No book details what this feels like. Wanting someone like this. Needing someone like this.
Sherlock is trying desperately not to grin. The positive attention is a bit overwhelming. "Um," he mutters to his shoes. "Chemistry. I'm studying Chemistry."
Sherlock crosses his arms defiantly. "Not what I was going to say."
The genius he shares a room with doesn't deign to dignify that with an answer, busying himself with a plethora of slides scattered around his desk and focusing his eyes into the microscope lenses again, ignoring the question and conversation altogether.
He knows that.
"Jesus, Sherlock," John breathes, pulling at the boy to lay down beside him, "Well done."
They don't speak. Sherlock is quite certain he wouldn't be able to form proper words if asked right at this moment.
. John can't stifle the moan he lets slip from his lips, those words coming out so much filthier than they should be.
The heat of a wet mouth is gone.
John chuckles against Sherlock's skin because this just truly cannot be happening to him. This perfect boy is his for the… god for the
"Mm," Sherlock replies, taking a beat to down a gulp of water. "Yes," he mutters weakly down to his drink.
"Oh god no, the leg work for a spy would probably put Mycroft into a diabetic coma. No, that's far to pedestrian for him."
, am I?"
This is the best one yet.
Maybe he can help.
Sherlock was no longer looking at him, gathering his laptop and some papers from his desk and shoving them into a bag as though he hadn't just caught on to everything going on inside John's mind. John knew better then to believe that. He would be fine with Sherlock thinking he was aroused. Hopefully, he'd hidden the panic with the anger.
Turning in time to see a familiar tall genius jog out to center field, John grins and raises his hand. "I've got left side. Mike, you want right?"
Victoria flicked on the kettle then leaned over the table, resting her weight on her elbows. "Was she awful?"
John stares at him for a long time.
John has even seen him blow out a shaky breath to compose himself.
"Really?" Sherlock breathes into his mouth. "Are you sure?"
is sharp and loud.
Clearly, John was in a very poor mood.
Very rarely they talked about Sherlock. John tried a few times, receiving one or two word answers, then dropped his attempts altogether. It became an unspoken agreement then John's life was on the table, and Sherlock's was absolutely not.
"Like what?" John pushes, tone hardening with his own anger at Sherlock's hesitation.
dramatic," John teases, though the look on Sherlock's face is so earnest it makes something in John's stomach flip unpleasantly. "I can't imagine one man runs this country."
"I was talking about you!" Sherlock bursts out, unsure where the intensity is coming from. His emotions are all over the place. Fear, panic, hope, confusion...love.
It's the first day of the new school year.
Sherlock immediately goes rigid and Molly chuckles.
He knows it is. He knows that voice. Those smug, knowing words are all too familiar.
Although, the way John had responded during their conversation was embarrassingly immature. He could barely get his brain to send actual words to his mouth, let alone sentences. Sherlock clearly had one hell of a gift, was obviously highly intelligent, and John wanted to kick himself for how he'd reacted. He really wasn't normally like that. It was utterly humiliating.
"Come in," John says hurriedly like he's only just realizing he hadn't invited Sherlock into his room, which Sherlock's guess is he hadn't. He follows in far enough for the door to close behind him and then John is in his arms again, cuddling as close as possible and Sherlock takes him back in with open arms, feeling equally clingy and a little needy and very grateful that the sentiment is returned so he feels no shame in it.
John cleared his throat uncomfortably. "Yes, well."
"Yes, John," Sherlock tried to reply without being flippant. "I remember graduation."
John shuffled his feet, seeming unsure how to react. "Alright...?"
Sherlock races out of class and off to the library where he spends every free period he has.
Or, whatever it is John and Sherlock have. Normal doesn't quite seem like the right word.
A strong, intense wave of emotion swept through him, surrounding his heart and squeezing, his chest feeling tighter and tighter. He bit his lip hard, feeling incredibly silly for this reaction; swallowing back the threatening tears looming behind his eyes.
on purpose but you weren't supposed to
Years after losing his partner to war, Sherlock wobbled on his feet at the weight of it all, knees shaking, begging for him to fall apart right there, let miserable, horrible tears fall down his cheeks. He'd missed this. He'd missed John being bloody
The rub of it all is that the boy has no idea that John would love nothing more than to corrupt Sherlock Holmes. He would love to take Sherlock apart piece by piece, layer by layer until he's is a writhing, begging mess and the only word he can remember is John's name.
But Sherlock probably had expectations. John had already royally screwed up their first time, hadn't he? Not even thinking about reciprocating. It legitimately hadn't even crossed his mind until so much later. How awful was that? What kind of lover
"How'd you get her in?"
Sherlock stares.
The implication of that statement made John shiver. With excitement or fear, he couldn't be sure.
"Oh-Oh Sherlock. Fuck, Sherlock, I'm gunna come."
John sighed heavily. "No," he mumbled. "No, I'm a giant fuck-up is what I am."
All he knows is by the time he's done, there is silence.
Sherlock holds the note delicately between his fingers.
"Here we are, then."
He just wants to touch him again. To touch John. To touch his tanned skin, feel his warm body, taste his lips.
Mrs. Hudson, as always, takes the snapping in stride and begins making tea.
John's vision blurred. Don't worry about it? Don't worry about your own parents pretending they don't have you? Pretending you don't exist? Don't worry that your sister is a lesbian and was kicked out of your home so long ago for it? And you didn't even know? John's world was suddenly on its head. "Oh right," he muttered. "I won't worry that I don't have parents anymore, Harry."
John glared. "You're certainly treating me like one."
They didn't speak of it.
"I've got to get back to work," the blond says, grinning at Sherlock's obviously shocked look. He laughs and turns to leave.
"You promise?" John murmurs over his lips. "You promise you'll tell me if you're uncomfortable with... with anything?"
Victor fucking Trevor.
"I have a sneaky feeling it takes Sherlock longer than a few hours to properly wrap his head around a new relationship," Paul nods in agreement.
"Jesus, Sherlock," he groans as his orgasm crashes over him. He rides out against Sherlock's hands, moaning softly as his hips shake and stutter to a stop. He glances up to find bewildered eyes looking back at him.
John cautiously approached the shirt as though is may be a bomb about to go off, and carefully took the collar between his thumb and forefinger, shaking it out gently to get a better look.
"Wait, you… you're the other Chemistry partner, right?" The name Irene is suddenly familiar, though John has only heard it a few times.
"I'm- uh… what happened earlier was unfortunate."
it was naughty considering I thought you were my boyfriend for the last three months," John giggles, hands gripping Sherlock's lower back. "My boyfriend," he murmurs, eyes locking on Sherlock's lips, "who I thought wasn't interested in sex… God, the things I
"Yes yes," Sherlock flips his hand dismissively, "now you've met him, are you happy? Can you be on your way?"
in glittery red letters - in Christmas colors for obvious reasons.
He needs to get a handle on the situation.
about John. That made Sherlock the second person on God's green earth who knew. And John sort of loved that. John had already decided he was going to start experimenting with his new life as soon as he got to London. What better way to start then with a handsome gay man already knowing? Even if nothing happened between them…and god did that hurt to even think… John still wanted to talk to him. Hang out with him. Get to know him.
Christ, he is so goddamn
However, John is no longer listening, suddenly surging forward and to the side, practically diving for the contents of the drawer and landing on top of Sherlock rather harshly, knocking the breath from him. "Ow! Jesus,
Sherlock can't fight the tears.
Thank god for the rugby boys. John hadn't been sure he'd make it through the night without doing something irreparably stupid like, for example, getting gloriously drunk and spilling his sentimental guts to his roommate in a sloppy fashion while simultaneously coming off as though he'd pitied and felt sorry for Sherlock. John
together. And nothing has magnified that fact alone for Sherlock Holmes more so than being apart from John Watson for three fucking days.
John was right. He did know.
And with John, it seemed like the game was on.
"Turning brothers against each other for the sake of your relationship?" John raises a judgmental eyebrow at his friend. "I thought you were better than that."
John's hands all but flew to the collar of his black t-shirt, tugging it up and over his head. His two round dog tags fell free from the wrap of the fabric, hanging heavy at the center of the long chain they dangled from, settling against his breastbone. His bare chest sat at the perfect height to Sherlock's mouth and Sherlock took advantage, planting an open mouthed kiss on John's chest between the chains, laving his tongue against the warm skin of his lover's body. John moaned, pushing into the touch, tossing his head back as Sherlock moved to one of his nipples, taking it between his teeth and tugging.
? Like John plans on being around then? Like some sodding
Rugby captain and all-around nice bloke, John is absolutely adored within their secondary school. He's charming and witty and truly a kind boy, always there with a quick joke and a grin to make any dark day light, the kind of bloke you can count on to always have your back through thick and thin no matter what. Back when Sherlock wasn't aware what a fixture this boy was about to become in his life when they used to spend every weekend together, watching films and eating popcorn, Sherlock couldn't understand why John was even there. He couldn't see why this incredible bloke was spending all this time with the genius boy of all people when he could be doing countless other things with countless other people, finding better and more interesting things to do than keep Sherlock company in his big empty house while his parents constantly traveled on business, hardly ever there at all.
Please. Please if there is a God, please make it that Victor Trevor is
"Hell no this wasn't my damn order," Greg huffs at the two of them. "It's our day off for christsake. Myc and I had brunch plans."
This was it. This was the part that would hurt the most. This was the most evil thing he'd ever say. "It's the least you could do after what you did to me."
Sherlock laid John down in his bed, slipping off his shoes and tugging his coat down his shoulders. Surprisingly, this is where John stirred.
. And as little as Sherlock knows about social interactions, one thing he does know is that people love athletes. They love team spirit and they love cheering at games and they l
. His thoughts are slow, so unbelievably slow and his head feels a bit light, like he could float away at any second.
"Apparently," John growls.
Sherlock didn't respond. He closed his eyes again and waited, knowing Mycroft was far from finished.
Mike seemed to snap out of his haze and wrinkled his forehead. "What do you mean, 'even us'? You're not fucking Sherlock yet? What are you waiting for? You've been wa-"
John, for his part, looked furious, his hands already balling into fists at his sides.
Sherlock had stayed silent. He just wanted to get home. Get home to his room where he could lock himself away and stay there forever. It was cases like these that had ended in a good shag in the past. It was cases like these that made Sherlock want to stay far far away from John.
"There," he says in a low whisper, pulling back to look over Sherlock's face. "Wouldn't want mummy asking questions." He moves back toward his bike and Sherlock's hand pushes at his glasses, pretending to fix them, nervous tick becoming his default.
"Sherlock?" John murmurs, eyeing him carefully. "You okay?"
All will be right.
at you."
Mike was suddenly very serious, looking off behind them with a stern look. "That's what I'm worried about," he murmured absentmindedly, then "I'll be right back."
Here's the other thing about his editor. While he managed to come off snarky and difficult to please, the smallest praise made him react in the most adorable ways. John had found their banter always hit its peak when John's shameless flirting got Sherlock flustered and fidgeting, obviously unsure of how to respond. John couldn't tell if Sherlock was genuinely terrible at flirting or if he honestly wasn't interested in John, attempting to change the subject to avoid the topic altogether.
"No," Mycroft mumbles, dropping his gaze and fidgeting slightly with guilt, "I was just going to ask him how things were going rooming with Sherlock."
John giggled. "How old were you when you started wanting answers to those questions?"
"Okay," Sherlock beams at him even as his face darkens a shade, though at the suggestion of the victory or the nickname itself, John isn't sure, but it doesn't matter because grey irises are turning bluer and happier and it's all John could want.
But tonight is Friday, and Sherlock has invited him over for takeaway.
, no," Sherlock's voice shudders slightly and John turns back just in time to see the end of a revolted shiver make it's way through the genius. "Ugh,
His thoughts must have played across his features because Sherlock's hand was abruptly cupping his cheek, thumb gliding over his skin in an understanding caress. "We'll sort it out," Sherlock murmured. "We'll have to keep it a secret but I...I want to be with you."
," Greg Lestrade barks out on a tight breath as he shuffles across the space between John's legs and Mycroft's umbrella, "nope nope
Sherlock nods, ignoring the thrill at the mention of John. "Unfortunately. Who is he?"
The minutes don't even register on his radar as he stares down at the message on the phone in his hand, the quiet of the library doing nothing to soothe his loud, racing thoughts, popping like firecrackers in every different direction, diverting his attention this way and that as he reads it and then reads it again and then reads it again.
