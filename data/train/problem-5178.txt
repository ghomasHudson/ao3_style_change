“You’d better explain to them where you’re going,” she said, picking up her cup to take a steadying drink. “Lord knows I’m not going to do it for you.”
If ever there has been real divinity on earth, it is in this. It must be.
“So?” Dean asks, voice low.
It had been on one of those rare occasions - getting rarer and rarer as the years went by - that their dad was back. It was one of the last times he ever actually took them from Missouri's home, and they spent it someplace up in Nebraska, a few hours out of Lawrence. Dean was seven; Sam, three.
“You mean like Mom,” he said.
He looks down at the beer bottle in his hands. Then he raises it, as if in toast. It’s a strangely human gesture. Dean is still getting used to that.
“Ummmm,” Patience said.
“I swear to you, Missouri,” John said.
Dean huffed out a laugh.
“What’s that?” Sam asked.
He flipped open the phone and pressed it to his ear.
Dean stares down at one hand, half expecting to see it holding a lighter. A braid of hair. A pile of ash.
“Give that back,” Sam said, reclaiming it. “What about you? Anything helpful?”
“Well don’t sugarcoat it, Cas.”
“I’d like to see you make me.”
“No,” John said. “I needed to hear it. Thank you. For the truth.”
“Wow,” Dean said, snapping another rubber band in Sam’s direction. It hit the cover of Sam’s book and dropped to the floor, landing among a dozen other spent rounds. “I’m feeling the love. I really am.”
“It’s okay,” Dean said. “Shh, shh, Sammy. It’s not deep. You’re okay.”
Not just a lock of hair, but two of them - one black, the other brown. They’ve been twisted together into a braid.
He was shaking, Dean noticed. There was a tremor in his hands, almost imperceptible, except for the quavering in the bottle’s liquid. The realization frightened Dean. Before that, whatever his dad had been, he’d been untouchable.
“Dean, quit flirting with my wife,” James said. “Hey, Sam. Have you realized you’re too good for Dean yet?”
“Look, we don’t have to tell him everything,” Dean finally said. “But we need help. We need to know how to fight something like this. I mean, do you know any exorcisms? No, I didn’t think so. At the very least, we need to know what the hell to do with the body.”
He does it before his brain can catch up to his heart and tell him that it’s a bad idea. He’s kissing Castiel before his lips can even remember what kissing is. He’s kissing Castiel almost before his body has even moved. Dean is kissing Castiel years ago, a thousand times, in a thousand different places, under a thousand different skies.
“Anyway, if Pamela’s word is any good - and it usually is - you know your stuff,” Bobby said. “I’m surprised you need my help at all.”
“Last week she told me that she only drinks bottled water because the fluoride in the tap water interferes with her ability to guard against malicious spiritual influences,” Sam said.
Sam thunked his forehead forward against the steering wheel.
It’s the first line that grabs him - ‘For God’s sake hold your tongue, and let me love’ - and then he finds himself slowly muddling through the rest of it, stumbling here and there over the stilted, outdated language. It’s the sort of thing that Sam would have no problem understanding. It leaves Dean feeling a little baffled, and then annoyed by his own bafflement.
“Yeah, it was first come, first serve,” Sam said. “And Steven’s always first.”
“Grants wishes,” Patience said matter-of-factly.
The nuns. They’re probably in heaven. After all that. Almost certainly.
“Look at you in your stupid cap and gown,” Dean said suddenly from Sam's shoulder. “You were such a dork.”
“Out,” she said imperiously. “You are all kinds of mixed up right now and I do not want it in my kitchen.”
“Hey there, Sam,” it said. “I think it’s time we talked.”
And that was a mess that Sam could live without.
Sam and Dean stumbled backward as Steven flapped his hands at them, shooing them down the hall.
“Once, I felt differently,” he says. “Today I find myself shamed not by Akobel’s actions, but by Ishim’s. I wonder what I would have done if I had known the truth back then.”
“It’s way more likely that this is a supernatural problem, don’t you think?” Sam said. “You said it yourself, didn't you? When in our lives has it ever paid off to treat something like this as normal?”
Dean scowled. He cooked most of what Sam ate, and he’d never given anyone nightmares before. Not accidentally, anyway.
“You think?” Sam asked.
His dad huffs out a laugh and shakes his head.
“Nah, your daddy’s saved my hide enough times that it wouldn’t be right,” Bobby said. “Either of you ever dig a grave before?”
Dean shushed him loudly as the phone picked up.
Just in case it was necessary. To cut a sign in the air - or to cut flesh. One or the other. Just in case.
“Out!” Steven yelled, scrambling back down the ladder. “Both of you get out of my house at once!”
“You know that for sure?” Sam asked. “You’ve seen it?”
Dean burst into the room, only to freeze in the doorway.
“They did this to us!” the nuns chorus. “They did this!”
“I wish you two wouldn’t fight,” Sam said to Missouri as she led him to her reading room.
“Of course not,” Sam said. “Of course he’s not answering his phone the one time we call in a life or death situation. Is this what a panic attack feels like? I think I’m about to have a panic attack.”
“Do you have a better plan?” Dean asked, punching in the numbers on his cellphone. “You want to call Missouri and get her input on this one? Dede maybe? Oh yeah, that’ll go over great. Those two definitely know how to handle a corpse. Maybe we can get Patience to help with her little plastic shovel and bucket!”
“Thanks.”
“You know, sometimes I want to tell her the truth about real ‘malicious spiritual influences’ just to see what she does next,” Dean said, retaking his seat.
“I just...think it’s better if you don’t go up there on your own,” Sam said. “Like you were in my - in my dream.”
“Whatever,” Sam said, rolling his eyes. “At least I got to walk at my graduation.”
She smiles. The thin skin covering her skull stretches nearly to the point of tearing, and Dean has to remind himself that ghosts can't read minds.
Dean steels himself and tosses the book back down onto the stone floor. So used to being bent into one familiar shape, it falls open again, to that very same page. Dean pours salt across the words, struggles momentarily with the lighter, and then stands and watches the poem burn away.
“What will you do if I say no?” she asked.
It pulled something out from the band of Marlene’s pants. The edge of it flashed in the light, and Sam squirmed even harder as he realized what it was - a knife. But the demon didn’t point the blade at him. Instead, it pressed the edge up against Marlene’s arm, drawing it across the bare flesh. Blood oozed quickly up and out of the cut and began dripping down her arm in a thick stream.
“You know, now that you mention it,” he said, “I think we’ve got the perfect thing. We’ve got a stock of specialty candles that summon fulfilling relationships into your life and drive out toxic ones with their smoke.”
The early hours of the morning found Sam sitting at his desk, going through his old notes on protective wards. He flipped through sketches of the anti-theft sigils he’d designed for the store and the runes he’d drawn up for attracting potential customers, arousing curiosity in passersby. His fingers lingered over the seals that he’d had tattooed on his shoulders, seals that he’d replicated in the apartment and the store. They were supposed to keep evil spirits out. Clearly they weren’t strong enough to work on demons. He’d have to find something that would work, and soon.
Dean looked up from the plate he was scrubbing and made to set it down and follow.
“Dean,” Sam said, plaintive.
“What do you mean?” Dean asked.
“Figure out how to dispose of a body on our own?” Sam asked.
The spirits are gone.
“Whoa, whoa, calm down,” Dean said. “Everything’s going to be fine. We just have to…”
“Oookay,” Dean said. “Well, if Hitler answers the door, I promise to shoot without question, dog or no dog.”
“Take them with me,” John said at once. “I don’t want to. But if it’s what I have to do to keep them safe, then I will.”
“A little,” Dean said, which probably meant he’d nodded off for a few minutes while waiting for something to finish baking. Currently, he was pouring the contents of a mixing bowl into a pie crust.
Yowza. I already knew how massive this fic was going to be when I started it and I’m still sitting here like golly this has gotten out of hand. I’ve literally written more than 50,000 words in under a month and broken my keyboard doing it. Oh well. In for a penny, in for a pound. If you’re still with me you’re a champ. A true MVP. Your prize is...Castiel. You made it!!!! :D Now the slow burn can start. LMFAO!
Pleased at the compliment, Dean nodded, and set his tea back down so that he could pull Sam closer to his chest. The baby stirred and cooed in Dean’s arms, but was otherwise quiet. They were both good boys. John was lucky. It was unlikely that he knew it.
It’s the same thing, he sees now, that the two of them had predicted for themselves. And they’d been right. They had loved each other, and the world had hated them for it. It had driven them to their deaths.
“Maybe we should call Dad,” he said, then immediately winced as he heard the words leave his mouth.
But that had been before he’d really gotten to take a look at the history of the mission. The actual records of these nuns and their passing are scant, little more than fragments and swapped gossip, but each printed word drips with vitriol. Their names are nowhere to be found, only their crime - and their punishment.
“Tea,” Dean said, entering Sam’s bedroom and crossing toward him. “Sounded like you needed it.”
“Ah-ha,” Bobby said. Bizarrely, some of the wariness left his tone at this. “The demon’s not still in her, is it?”
Sam frowned, feeling unfairly judged for something that wasn’t his fault and probably wasn’t even true.
“What is it?” he asked.
Dean laughed awkwardly.
“The Mysterious Mr. Fortinsky,” Dean said. “Right on time.”
“Son of a bitch,” said Dean.
So saying, he gave Sam a cheeky salute and disappeared out the back door, into the alley separating Rising Sun Magic Supply from Dale’s Butcher Shop (a convenient arrangement).
They both started back a step in surprise.
Sam scoffed.
More than twenty years pass. There are many things in between. Many, many things. Enough that forgetting is no longer just a blessing but an inevitability. The Dean of seventeen feels so far away, he doubts he would recognize him if they passed each other on the street. That boy is a ghost, just as his father is now, and if they haunt Dean, they do it with company, and their voices are lost in the same chorus that drowns the poem out.
The dead nun has seen.
Dean forced himself to shut the nightstand drawer. He crawled under the covers of his bed to catch what meager sleep he could manage.
“I - I don’t know!” he stuttered. “It was just - I didn’t -!”
That was okay. Dean had one, too. He had to look after Sam.
“Dean!” Patience repeated. “Dean! Dean!”
He trails off.
“That’s alright,” John said. “This is enough to start with.” He held his hand out to refuse the cup that Missouri offered him. “No, thank you. I’m afraid there’s one more thing I need to ask from you.”
“Besides,” Missouri said, pressing a button on the oven and wiping her hands on a towel, “there's nothing for you to do. The roast's been in the crock pot since noon and I just put the potatoes in. It'll all be done by the time the others get here.”
“Shut up,” Sam snapped.
“Which one of you is Dean?” Bobby asked, coming to a stop beside a desk laden with loose papers and half-empty whiskey bottles.
“...You may have a point.”
“Sam.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“What?” Dean asked, twisting to face Sam fully. “What are you talking about?”
And so a few days passed.
“We'll what, Dean?” Sam asked, leveling his brother with a judgemental stare. “Shoot him? No offense, dude, but it's super obvious that you're packing right now. It's kind of freaking me out, actually. Since when do you own a gun?”
I pretty much consider everything after season 5 to be optional, especially since the show itself has minimal consistency. This is extra true for the witchcraft stuff, which I've essentially made up wholesale aside from a few things. There's just so much contradictory and confusing lore. I'd rather play around and write to fit a tone than try and make it match canon. The same thing basically extends to all other post-s5 lore. Expect some cherry picking. Nothing wild and crazy, don't worry too much, but mechanically speaking it probably won't acknowledge or fit with some stuff that happens in later seasons.
“You’re still sending him money?” she asked, one eyebrow raised.
Missouri could see what he’d meant to ask.
He took a tentative step forward. Then another. He ducked quickly into the kitchen, opened the cabinet, and pulled out a shaker of salt. That salt could be used to drive off evil spirits was one of the few things he’d ever bothered to retain from his dad’s impromptu hunting lessons, piecemeal though they had been. Carrying it in front of himself like a weapon, he proceeded again down the hallway toward his room.
He didn’t finish the thought. He didn’t need to. They both knew what he was referring to - that long month of torment after Sam’s stupid teenage foray into a darker kind of magic. Each night he’d been plagued by horrific dreams of suffering in a bloody and shadowed realm where dark, insubstantial shades whispered his name. No doubt that was why Dean was so concerned. He was probably wondering what it was that Sam had done now.
Missouri saw plenty of clients who were in trouble, and not just the kind that came from their own negativity and self-doubt. She’d seen many nasty things in her days as a psychic - human, inhuman, and sometimes something in between. But none of it quite compared to what had come for John Winchester’s family, or what now resided in his soul. There was a knot of darkness in the pit of that man. There was little else left to keep him from flying into pieces.
“Every day matters,” she said. “And he’s missed most of them.”
The poem, however, he forgets entirely.
“John,” Missouri said warningly.
Missouri shook her head, mind swirling with grim and terrifying thoughts as she busied herself with making tea. She was already second guessing her decision to tell John the truth. Maybe she should have told him a nice lie, set his mind at ease, let him go back to his ordinary life and try to scrape the shards of it together into something livable. Only, whatever had been in that house that night, it had been dangerous. Missouri couldn’t guarantee that it would never come back. John deserved to know that.
“Uh, yes, yes it was,” Sam said. A flush crawled up his cheeks. He looked away from Bobby, who had raised one unimpressed eyebrow, and cleared his throat. “She talks about me?”
They stayed with their dad for a long time after that. Nearly a full month. They hopped from motel to motel, traveling around the Midwest, following John’s invisible, unspoken plan. They never stayed anywhere for long. Everywhere they went, silence and fear followed after. Most days, Dean couldn’t work out which of his feelings was greater - his relief that he and Sam were with their dad again, or his worry about what was going to happen next. It was like living on the edge of a knife.
“...Don’t you mean ‘inescapably?’” Marlene asked.
Sam shook his head, picked up his book, and relocated to the front counter for the duration of the store’s operational hours.
“Don’t wet yourself,” Dean said.
“What happened?”
“Here we go,” Sam said under his breath.
Look what it had gotten them, he thinks sharply at himself: Arsenic and an eternity as monsters, stuck in the very halls where they had been poisoned to death, slowly, slowly, and then all at once. Then sent to the worms that never die.
An awkward silence fell over the table.
I think this one's a little slow but there are a lot of things I have to set up. It's all part of a greater plan.... It will all come together in the end........... Also I promise Castiel is really in this fic and that it's really Destiel. HEAVILY so in fact LMFAO. I PROMISE. I'M NOT LYING.
“Or it was something else,” he said tersely. “Are you sure it was just a dream?”
“Wait, that’s actually in there?” Dean asked, leaning over the table to look. “Dude, that’s so specific. What the hell?”
“Not the time, Dean,” Sam said in a high-pitched voice.
“Yeah, Steve, that’s what you say whenever you see me,” Dean said. “Still hasn’t happened yet.” He held up a tupperware container and rattled it. “Cookies?”
(That the same Vice Principal Beaukiss would subsequently make it his mission to turn then-freshman Sam's high school career into a living hell had never seemed to occur to Dean. Sam hadn’t bothered to clue him in.)
“Sorry,” he said lamely. “We’re real passionate about the prevention of polio and the measles. It’s how our great grandpappy died.”
The stairs from the chapel to the dormitory are up ahead. He leaps up them as quickly as he can. Dean and his dad had narrowed down the right room to one of two. The first is up ahead on the left. Dean darts into it and slams the door shut, hoping against hope that he’s gotten lucky and found the right one on his first try.
“I don’t know,” Dean said. “But we better not take chances. You and I have both seen what ignoring omens can do.”
Sam rubbed at his mouth with his hand. He could still feel the sticky residue of blood beneath his fingers. Could still taste copper and sulfur in the back of his throat. That, and…it was almost like he could feel it inside of him. Like a low-grade hum, emanating from just behind his teeth.
“You talk to Steven?” James asked. “Really? That kook?”
To be honest I probably should have split this chapter in two because it's literally 11k but I didn’t want to wait for Castiel anymore. Also, at some point I might go back and revise the last couple of chapters, but it won't affect anything outside of general quality so don't worry about it if you already made it this far.
“Come on, Sam,” the demon said impatiently. “Stop trying to make this difficult.”
Looking back on it now, Dean thought that every single one of those times, their dad had really meant to stay, or to keep them, or something. It was like he thought - finally, he knew enough to keep them safe. But then something new would appear and convince him that he was wrong. The world always had fresh horrors in it. Eventually, John had just accepted that fact.
‘For God’s sake hold your tongue, and let me love...’
“He can’t be a bad guy,” Dean said. “He has a dog.”
Someday he will die. He will go down bloody. He will go down hard. Someday, someone will burn his body and throw his ashes to the wind, regardless of who or how or why. It’s practically written in the sand.
Dean took a long drink.
Sam took a drink, too.
Sam stared down at his plate and pushed a piece of roast through a dollop of sauce with his fork. If there was anyone in the world who disliked hearing about John more than Sam did, it was Missouri Moseley.
The smile dropped from Dean’s lips almost as quickly as it had arrived. As casually as possible, he put his hand on his hip near where his gun was tucked into the back of his jeans.
‘We can die by it, if not live by love,
For a long time, Dean sat staring at his closet door, contemplating potential risks, weighing pros and cons. Occasionally, he checked his phone, as if a message from their dad might suddenly appear without alerting him. It never did.
“You okay there, Sammy?” Dean asked from the hall. “You were yelling in your sleep.”
Nerves already severely tried by the day’s encounter, Dean raised his voice to drown hers out and loudly asked, “Have you seen the new sign we put up?”
He wonders what heaven looks like for them. He wonders if it’s a small mission cell, with only a single dwindling candle by which to read, a book spread out across their thighs.
Dean dares to look at him. Castiel is looking back. Their eyes meet - like a lightning bolt out of the blue. Like a punch straight to the gut.
“Actually,” Marlene said, “it hasn’t been Marlene for a while now.”
It was a burnt match.
“I cannot imagine,” Castiel says, drawing his attention once more, “a version of your love that would disgust me, Dean. Your love improves the universe, illuminates it, makes it into something more beautiful than what it was. Anyone who would condemn you for it isn’t worthy of living in the world that it has saved.”
“Why would it even do something like that?” Dean asked. “Bleed in you? Was it trying to pass you some kind of - of demon disease? Work some mojo? Bind you to it somehow? I’ve seen you use blood in binding rituals before.”
“James, quit flirting with my brother,” Dean said. “Not unless you plan to finally make an honest man out of him.”
Dean curses under his breath, then jumps about a mile in the air as the ghosts slam themselves against the door.
Sam sat. He took a deep breath as Missouri sank down next to him on the small couch, trying to clear his head as best as he could.
Steven Fortinsky, self-proclaimed Wizard of Time, lived in an old converted funeral parlor out near the edge of town. He said he liked being close to dead people because it was quieter there. It was the most normal thing he had ever said to either Sam or Dean, and it almost made sense in a weird sort of psychic way, except that Steven had never once shown any penchant for speaking to the dead.
“What, I was going through your shit?” Dean asked. “You know I think your crap’s too lame to mess with.”
“Yeah,” he said. “Fine. You’re right. We’ll wait and see.” He leaned forward on his elbows on the back room table. “Tell me more about this guy’s dream interpretations. What’s it mean if I dream about losing my eyebrows?”
“Talk about what?”
“I’m sure he’ll try, sweetpea,” she said. “That’s all any of us can do, really. Try our best.”
“Calli, calli, calli,” he muttered, concentrating on the cut, pouring all the soothing feelings he could into the phrase. “Smedi sangi calli.”
“That’s not gonna be a problem, is it?” he asked.
“Yeah, sorry, I wouldn’t be calling if it wasn’t an emergency,” Dean said. “Is this Bobby Singer? John Winchester gave us your number. My name’s Dean.” There was a long pause. “Dean Winchester. His son.”
Dean had taken special care to remember those words. He was glad that he had.
“But that’s not right,” he mumbled to himself. “That’s not right at all. Where’s everything gone? Was I wrong about the date? October 2005...2005...What happens in 2005?”
Chapter title is a reference to 'House of the Rising Sun' by the Animals. As is the title title and the name of their store. I realized suddenly that this is definitely a pun that they made on the show but then I had a second realization which is that I don't care.
“Now what do you know about that?”
“Eyes on the road there, tiger,” Dean said.
He can’t afford to make any more mistakes. Especially not today, on the day he’s meant to be  proving himself to his dad. Proving that he’s ready. That he’s a man.
Chapter title comes from 'Burn the Witch' by Queens of the Stone Age, although I would be a little bit of a liar if I didn't admit that the line that was stuck in my head for most of writing it was actually 'I stand accused of being in league with Satan' from 'Burn the Witch' by Shawn James. Pick your poison.
She picked up the tray with the teapot, cups, and sugar, and took them back out into the living room.
Dean flipped the book shut again and slumped back in his chair.
“Well, alright,” Bobby said. “Listen up, then. It’s important that you do everything exactly as I say.”
“Don’t thank me yet,” she muttered.
“No way!” he said. “Not Pam! I love that chick! Hey Sammy, remember your twenty-first birthday party? Your first legal drink was a body shot off of her, wasn’t it? Man, those were good times.”
Sam looked away.
But then suddenly Sam was crying. Dean whirled around to see what the matter was and found Sam sitting with his hand held up, blood running down his small, pudgy palm.
Dean forces the poem from his mind. He forces himself not to think about the nuns. Not ever again. He forgets they ever existed. He forgets that one of them spoke to him. He forgets everything she said.
“Oatmeal raisin?” Steven asked.
“You’re a demon,” he realized, gritting the word out from between his teeth. “You’re possessing her.”
“Uh,” Dean said. “I didn't quite catch that, Missouri. There's some kind of...interference. You're breaking up.”
The first night Sam woke from a nightmare of fire and death, he lay panting for a long time in his bed, hearing nothing but his own heartbeat in his ears and the echo of his own screams. His skin was slick with sweat. Spots danced in front of his eyes as his gaze darted here and there across the ceiling, as if to ensure the vision from his dream hadn’t been real. But there was nothing more sinister than the overhead light.
“Sammy, come on.”
“They are,” Missouri agreed. “So why are you in such a hurry to hand them off?”
“Touchy,” the demon said. It held out Marlene’s hand, examining the long, painted nails with a look of amusement.  “I’ll admit I had fun wearing this meatsuit for a while. But even demons can only take so much garbage, you know? I’m ready to ditch this bitch once and for all.”
about to die. The fire is supposed to symbolize your emotional suffering as a result of the loss.”
“But -”
(See the end of the chapter for
“We’ve got a mutual friend,” Bobby said. “Pamela Barnes.”
“Shut up,” Sam said. “We’re not having this argument again.”
“No idea,” Sam said. “Something I ate, maybe?”
When John came back out, his eyes were wet. Missouri didn’t let that fool her into feeling pity. He was still leaving, after all.
“He seems okay,” Dean said as he finished fussing with the radio. He leaned back in his seat and let the dulcet tones of Def Leppard wash over him like a balm. “He helped us hide a body. If you can't trust the guy who helps you hide a body, who can you trust?”
“Patience, honey, why don’t you tell us about the trip you took to the zoo last weekend?” Tess said, swooping in to break the tension like an angel descending from on high.
He has to, though. He can’t stay here until dawn, not with his dad waiting for him expectantly. Dean tries to imagine telling him that he stayed cowering in a closet all night, afraid of a couple of dead, gay nuns, and finds he would rather eat a rocksalt round this very second. It’s this thought that makes him step forward, toward the door.
“I am,” Castiel agrees - slowly, drawing out the sounds, still thinking as he says it. “However…”
*finds a character who dies in the first five minutes of the only episode she ever appears in* Hmmmm... you are now beloved to me.
Song this chapter's title comes from is 'Tea for One' by Zeppelin.
He dragged Sam past Marlene, out into the hall and toward the bathroom. Turning on the tap, he cupped his hand under the water and splashed it liberally on Sam’s face.
, as they say. They died hand in hand and with arsenic in their mouths. A lovers’ suicide. Now their ghosts linger on as vicious, twisted shadows of the women they once were, their decaying spirits lashing out at any who wander in at night, unaware.
“Dean,” he muttered weakly.
They headed for Sioux Falls first thing in the morning, partly because it was a long drive, and partly because they wanted to avoid running into Missouri at all costs. The only way to survive an encounter with her at this point was to make sure it didn’t happen. They’d have to cross that bridge when they got to it, but they were absolutely taking the scenic route.
“Did we do something wrong?” Dean asked. “Or...will we?”
In her cup, the water dwindled. The leaves swirled. Omens flashed before her eyes. This she knew about tea leaves and omens alike: You could ignore them all you wanted to, but if you did, it would all go bitter from oversteeping.
Sam swallowed, heart leaping into his throat. A sense of deja vu swept over him, thick and unpleasant and wrong. The hallway leading down to their respective bedrooms seemed to stretch out before him into an impossibly long walk. Was it him or were the shadows there darker than they normally were, even at night?
“No, we’re pretty sure it’s gone,” Dean said. “A cloud of black smoke came out of her. Look, man, we’ve never dealt with anything like this before. I mean,
“Lay off, Missouri,” Dean said. “You know as well as I do he’d do anything for us. Me
“She has a family!”
Castiel laughs slightly and takes another drink.
“Yeah, yeah,” Dean said, making a zipping motion with his fingers across his mouth.
“Why would he do that?” Sam asked.
“What it did to me…” he started. “What if...what if it did something…"
As Dean spoke, Sam’s tears dried up. He sniffled loudly, but the pinched expression began to fade from his ruddy face. Dean smiled.
“I swear you use magic to cheat at that,” he said to Sam over his shoulder.
Once she was finally gone, Dean ducked through the beaded curtain into the back room and found Sam watching him with an amused glint in his eye.
“Can we not?” Sam asked as Dean sat up straight in his seat next to him, bristling.
“Or if it’s just me,” Sam said bitterly.
There, in the crevice, is a book.
“I don't know what you're talking about, lady,” Dean replies, gripping his shotgun tight. “You killed yourself.”
He’d felt like some kind of spy or supervillain installing it. Secretly, he’d been a little gleeful. What was cooler than having a hidden compartment in your room? (A lava lamp, possibly, but he had one of those, too.) Any joy he derived from its concept, however, was negated by its contents. In fact, Dean usually went to great lengths to avoid thinking about it. That’s why he’d bothered with the false panel in the first place. There were just some things that were better left forgotten.
>Castiel has entered the chat.
With that, he slammed the door shut in their faces.
“Listen, Dad left a number in his voicemail to call in case of emergency,” Dean said. “Some guy named Bobby Singer. Maybe he can help.”
“Let's hold off on talking to her until after we visit Bobby's,” he said. “She’ll be less freaked out if we have some kind of plan.”
Sam sighed.
By rights, they should have gone to him. He wasn’t the only practicing witch in the area, but he was one of the best. Madam had always said so. She had doted on him, adored him in her quiet, patient way, and had always been delighted to see Sam and hear about his progress. There was a time when she’d even jokingly called Sam her apprentice.
“It’s a load of B.S. is what it is,” Dean says.
“Yeah,” he said warily. “You’ve...heard of me?”
“Uh, Steven,” he called down. “There’s...there’s nothing here.”
“Are you sure?” he asked. “You don’t have to if you don’t want to. I know you don’t like reading me since…”
Sam pressed his finger to the eye on his left arm labeled with an ‘R’ and closed his eyes. The second sight slipped over his eyelids like an image from a screen, showing him his bedroom from the vantage point of the corresponding mark that he had carved into the corner of one wall.
Sam hung up.
“I guess,” Dean allowed.
“Now those two,” Dean said to Patience, pointing at them, “are nerds. You do not want to be a nerd. Got it?”
Missouri's gaze turned sharp. She examined Sam more closely, looking for and seeing what, neither of them could tell.
A part of him, he finds, is bracing for retaliation. For retreat. But Castiel remains right there in front of him, looking both steady and torn open at the seams. He shows the soft part of himself and refuses to look away, as if daring Dean to strike. As if daring Dean to do the same.
Additional note: I know in 13.3 "Patience" James says that Missouri was a hunter and she went off on hunting trips, but I think that's boring and turns the world into an identical mush where everyone either knows about the supernatural and hunts or is completely ignorant, so I've elected to ignore it. I think that's probably (?) clear in the way I've written this story but I figure I'd just say it here anyway.
Sam gave him a wry smile that told Dean everything was going to be just fine.
And Dean had whispered back, "I promise."
At any rate, it meant they now had next to nothing in terms of research material. He made a few runs to local libraries and trawled the internet for anything that wasn’t complete garbage, but both of these efforts turned up fruitless. Artemidorus’s assertion that it was Sam himself that was in mortal peril remained the closest thing to an answer that he had come across, and it wasn't exactly enlightening or hope-inspiring.
“Yes.” Castiel is vehement.
“It’s...from a poem,” he says.
“‘Course, I guess we still can,” it said.
‘And by these hymns, all shall approve
He said it just in time for Missouri to overhear as she entered, carrying the salad.
The demon was right in front of Sam now, standing only a handful of inches from where he was pinned like a struggling moth to the wall. It reached up and ran Marlene’s fingers down the side of his face in a parody of gentleness.
He trailed off.
“Excuse me?”
“I’ve made up my mind,” John said, voice like steel. “I need answers. I need to know what happened that night and - and I need to make whatever did it pay.”
What the hell does ‘the phoenix riddle hath more wit by us; we two being one, are it’ mean?
The next day they were back at Missouri’s.
“Marlene was a demon?” Dean asked in disbelief. “That...that actually explains a lot.”
But his skin crawls as he remembers certain things, unbidden: The way his eyes had slid along the sharp edge of the waiter's jaw last night, not really looking, but not really not looking either. A bare arm belonging to somebody else, weeks or months ago, the muscles in the biceps tensing and tightening as they moved. An anonymous set of shoulders, broad and faceless, seen only from behind. A laugh. A single dimpled cheek.
“Uh,” he said, stopping in the doorway to survey the array of platters cluttering their small table. “Stress baking, Dean? Really?”
So Dean pulls his arm back. He gets up from the bar and walks away.
“Angels are often wrong,” Castiel says wryly. “Besides, you aren’t an angel.”
If it had just been John up against the thing that had killed his wife, that would have been one thing. Missouri wouldn’t apologize for showing a man the thing he’d come looking for. But the children changed things.
“Friend?” Dean asked. “I don’t have any friends.” He considered that statement. “Man, that sounded really depressing. Sam, do we not have any friends?”
Sam sighed and turned to climb the stairs after him, ready to tell his brother off.
She says it like she can see it written on his skin. She says it like she is Nostradamus, prophesying calamity. She says it with dead lips too thin for kissing, now only good for speaking, and when she opens her mouth, Dean sees beyond them a rattling of teeth and a devouring dark.
“You have my number,” Missouri said, following him to the door. “Don’t you lose it.”
“It’ll only be a few minutes,” she said. “He’ll tell you all about it later.” Dean still looked unhappy. “Will it help if I promise not to break your little brother? Honestly, it’s like you don’t even trust me.”
It’s nearly falling apart from age, and it’s small enough to fit in one of Dean’s hands. In the dim light and obscuring cloud of dust that’s raised by pulling it free, he first thinks it’s a bible, just as his dad had suspected. But it’s too small for that, too thin. A book of psalms? He runs his thumb over the fading hand painted letters on the water-stained cover:
“She's going to skin you alive,” Sam agreed.
“Wait,” Sam said, stomach lurching.
hour, anyway). There was always at least one going off. Being in Steven’s house for too long was always an invitation for a headache.
(See the end of the chapter for
“What?” Sam asked. “Who is it? Dad?”
Dean focused on rinsing out a set of measuring cups.
Just to be on the safe side, he should probably burn the book, too. He turns to it, then pauses. He stares down at the page the braid has marked. There is a poem printed there:
“I don't know,” Sam said.
“What brings you boys by?” he asked. “I haven’t seen you since…”
Nothing, Dean tells himself. She’s just some dumb, dead monster and
Dean said nothing to this, only looked down at the baby sleeping quietly in his arms.
-souls or whatever.”
-soul entering the liver is what causes dreams. Maybe you need to lay off the alcohol before bed.”
“It is ironic,” Castiel says, returning to the day’s events. “Among angels, falling in love with a human is considered one of the most shameful acts possible.”
“Not like that,” Sam said quickly. “It was different.”
And there she was, all blonde curls and lipstick and gaudy jewelry. But how had she gotten in here? Sam was sure he hadn’t seen her in the store that day and was equally certain he’d locked up.
“Your personalized wake-up call,” the thing wearing Marlene’s face said. “It’s a shame, actually. I was hoping to have a little chat with your brother before you showed up. Oh well. Maybe next time.”
The room is painfully bare. The floor is made of stone tiles and the walls are plain brick. A rickety cot and a small nightstand are set up in one corner, but they’re only there for tours, not as a genuine artifact. Dean has thought about this, though. He cased the place during daylight hours already, before it had emptied of employees and guests for the day. If there’s something here, it’s been well hidden.
“I was closing up shop,” Sam said. “Then I came upstairs. I was looking for you, I think. I wanted to talk to you about something - I can’t remember what - but I couldn’t find you anywhere. There was a sound, in my room, and I went in, and…”
“I don’t know, I panicked,” he said. “God, I am so dead.”
Wait for Dean to come rushing toward the thing Sam knew wanted him dead.
“Obviously,” he said. “But hey. Game respects game.”
He reached into his pocket and pulled out his phone, dialing Dean’s number without a second thought.
” he said dumbly.
My new strategy for this fic is to write it as quickly as possible because I'd like it to be finished sometime in my life.
Dean laughs.
“Anything except call or write or visit, you mean,” Missouri said.
“Worse,” Dean said.
Dean turned back around to stare at Sam.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Dean,” Missouri said tightly, “if your store was burning down with Sam inside of it, that man would not spit to put it out, and you are sending him the hard earned money they bring in?”
“The body,” Sam said, realization dawning over him. “They’re going to think we did it, Dean. It’s going to look like we murdered her.”
“It broke her neck,” he said dully. “She’s dead. The demon, it said she was still in there and it just -”
Then again, maybe their heaven is another place, far from the stifling confines of that holy prison. Maybe it’s a cottage in the woods where they can be alone. Maybe their heaven is a shore to walk along, or a field where they lay together in the sun, or a little village in the mountains where they are greeted on the street with a smile.
He was young enough, Missouri thought, that he might never have had tea before. She sighed and tried not to let him see her misgivings. Children were sensitive to those sorts of things.
“He just needs a little bit of time,” she said. “He’s got to figure out what to do next.”
Given that these at least had entertainment value - unlike a large portion of their stock which did absolutely nothing, such as the energy realignment pendants and the bottles of essential oils - Sam had restrained himself to a singular roll of the eyes and refrained from further complaint. It was the useless junk that made up the vast majority of their sales, anyway, and they had to keep the lights on somehow. Even if the customers that inevitably came with it were kind of annoying.
It rang four times. Each second felt like an eternity.
“Why would she say that?” he asks, head tilted, brows pinched.
“Now don’t do that,” Missouri said, reaching out to clasp his hand. “Don’t get down on yourself. How many times do I have to tell you? We’re all given options in life. Our opportunities are not who we are. Only the choices we make determine that.”
“Calm down, Steven,” Sam said, raising his hands in self-defense. It was more likely that Steven would snap his own brittle, ancient finger bones than do any real damage by hitting them, but it was the principle of the matter. “What are you talking about? Is something going to happen?”
John gave her a flat look.
“About what happened to Mom?” Dean asked.
“Alright, alright,” the demon said. “All work and no play makes Sam a dull boy. But you’re right. I came here to do a job.”
“Someday someone might kill us for this,” Dean says. “The same as Akobel and Lily.”
“Not for me it ain’t, as long as there are no demons involved,” Bobby said. “And we already ruled that out, so you can put your gun away, boy.” Dean dropped his hand awkwardly back to his side. “I trust Pamela’s judgement. I never in a million years would’a guessed that her Sam Winchester and my John Winchester were the same kind of Winchester, though.”
“Last week,” Marlene said brightly. “Yes, the amethyst Sam recommended really helped center the energies in my car, just like he said it would. You pass along my deepest gratitude for me, won’t you?”
Dean and Missouri held gazes for a long, tense moment, and then both of them looked away. Missouri was shaking her head, lips pursed. Dean stared blankly at the wall over her shoulder.
Sam leveled him with a look.
Bobby squinted up at Sam.
“You leave my brother alone,” Sam ordered, almost on reflex.
The room he brought them to was filled with an even larger number of books, and more - the walls were tacked with old pages covered in drawings and writing in languages Dean couldn’t begin to decipher. He glanced at Sam expectantly. Sam’s eyes were darting around the room with laser focus, like a kid who’d just stepped into a candy store for the first time in his life.
The dreams continued. They had almost become a part of Sam’s normal life now, in a way his teenage nightmares never had. Those had always left him feeling dirty. These ones were frightening and disorienting and had seriously cut into his sleeping hours, but at least he still felt like himself when he woke up. He wasn’t that comforted by the knowledge that things could have been worse. But - they could have been worse.
Dean picked up his beer and took another long drink. Then, examining the bottle label like it was the most interesting in the world, he asked, “So are we gonna talk about it?”
Sam glared at him.
“Can we not?” Sam said again, louder this time. “Please?”
“No, that’s not what she said,” Sam said. “She didn’t rule anything out. She just couldn’t tell if I was any more or less fucked up than I usually am. That’s all.”
“He’d come if it really mattered,” Dean said.
One afternoon, Sam finally decided to take pity on both of them, and told Dean to get lost.
Like clockwork, Sam scoffed.
He quickly plucked it up, studying the shriveled splinter for any clue as to its origin, only to nearly drop it again when a voice suddenly called out to him from the doorway.
But the thought of John dragging those two after him on his hunt for revenge…
“Dad, it’s Dean. Call me back when you get this. It’s important.”
“It’s my niece,” Marlene said. “Her birthday is coming up. She’s turning thirty, nearly out of her prime childbearing years, and she still isn’t married. I’m hoping to get something to help her attract a suitable husband before she’s all dried up. Can you suggest something for me? Sam's phone number maybe?”
“I wasn’t joking about the cooking, though,” Missouri said. “Go make yourselves useful and set the table. For seven. James and Tess are coming with the little one.”
For a bizarre moment, Sam thought he was having the weirdest nightmare of his life. That was the only explanation he could think of that would adequately explain what he was seeing. He nearly reached up and pinched himself as he stared at the figure standing in his bedroom doorway.
He stood in the living room, rooted to the spot, uncertain of what to do next. Something might be in their home. Something that had wanted to hurt his brother, and possibly Sam as well. What could he do? He should turn around and go back down the stairs. Wait for Dean to inevitably rush home so that they could form some kind of plan.
“Are you serious?” he asked. “You want to call Dad?”
For himself, he’s not yet convinced.
“What's gotten into you two?” she asked.
Sam sank down onto the toilet seat and tried not to feel out of place, squeezed between the shower curtain with its palm trees and ocean view and the soap dispenser shaped like a mermaid with enormous breasts. He mostly failed. Everything felt too surreal, too awful. It was like he was watching some false version of his life from somewhere just outside his body. Nothing felt like it was under his control.
“Sit tight,” Missouri said. “We won’t be much longer.”
“So the dowsing ritual failed,” Dean said once he’d put the quiche in the oven and had started on the dishes. “And the smudging.”
Dean holds his gaze.
Patience gave him a serious nod.
“That’ll be the day,” he says. He reaches out to place a hand on Dean’s shoulder, the closest they ever get to an embrace. He says, “Happy birthday, son. You did good out there.”
“Yes, ma'am,” Dean agreed. Already he felt a little more relaxed.
They scream and rage and weep, fists banging at the wood, making an unholy racket, a harmony of damnation. Together, they shake the timbers of the roof. Their beating rattles the door in its frame - the whole room vibrates around Dean. Dust rains down from the ceiling. Small pebbles fall on his head. He begins to worry that they will tear the whole mission down to its foundations just to get at him.
. Only, the fatal version.”
“I’ll call,” John promised. “Every night.”
“And that sucks, but it’s not on us!” Dean said. “We didn’t do this! The demon did!” He paused and made a considering face. “Besides, she was kind of a crappy relative. They’re not missing out.” He supposed the candles had kind of worked after all. At Sam’s disbelieving look, he pressed on, “I’m calling Dad. He’ll know what to do. So just - stay right there and - and don’t pass out. Maybe sit down. You’re looking a bit woozy.”
Hot liquid smeared across his chin and cheek, cooling and drying almost instantly as it touched his skin. His face felt tacky with it. Spots danced in front of Sam’s eyes as his brain screamed for oxygen. At last, it grew to be too much. His lips parted as he gasped for air, and Marlene’s blood spilled onto his tongue. It tasted like copper - but also like something else. Something rotten.
“Promise me, Dean,” his dad said, both his voice and his grip on Dean’s shoulder like steel.
“Oh,” Sam said. “Why?”
He'd hit his growth spurt just the summer before and had still been getting used to his height. In the picture, he was hunched over somewhat awkwardly to get closer to Missouri, who had her arm wrapped tightly around his waist. Dean was at his other side, looking smug, probably because Dede was watching. This had been about the time Sam and Dean had both decided they were going to marry Dede, without ever consulting her or each other. James was next to Dean, looking stern, probably because Dean looked smug.
“...Polio or the measles?” Marlene asked, still looking taken aback.
As he tossed and turned in the tangle of his sweat-soaked sheets, somewhere in a motel room far, far away, John Winchester was pouring over a mosaic of signs. Sleep had eluded him for some time.
“Hey, may as well make a buck off their mistake,” Dean had said, setting out a stack of beginner magic sets with 'Party Tricks to Amaze!' printed across the front in enormous, shimmering letters.
Sam and Dean arrived at Missouri's place early that evening, as usual. Dean liked to help Missouri cook, had liked it ever since he was tall enough to reach the stove. It was almost ritual for them at this point, Dean seamlessly sliding up to her to help chop or peel or stir whatever she was making. That day, however, she took one look at him as he entered the kitchen and made a face.
And somewhere else, both further away and, simultaneously, much too close for comfort, a yellow-eyed demon was watching the last few pieces of an elaborate puzzle slide carefully into place. Down in the deepest depths of Hell, the Cage began to rattle.
“You want to talk about it?” Dean asked, still looking down at him warily. “You haven’t had one that bad since -”
Dean is a little staggered at the relief he feels at this sudden unburdening. The thought of heaven so rarely sets him at ease. But there it is.
But the eye had blind spots. Right under it, in the corner. Above it. On the ceiling.
“Uh, human,” Dean said. He winced again. “Well, it was a demon. There was a demon. In it. Then she kind of...spun her own head around like this was
“Just until this blows over,” Sam clarified. “You could go meet up with Dad, if you want. See what he has to say. Maybe he has an idea what this could be. And if it is a premonition...if you’re not here, it can’t happen.”
“Maybe.”
“You would have done the right thing, Cas,” Dean says. “And you’ll do the right thing now. Whatever that is.”
Castiel’s face is furious. He is filled with righteous anger on Dean’s behalf.
“Well, I’d love to stay and play with you and big brother,” the demon said, “but I’ve got things to do. Places to be. Souls to torture. But don’t worry, Sam. I’ll be seeing you soon.”

He stowed them in his nightstand right beside the bed. As he did so, his fingers lingered on the book's worn and cracked cover, feeling the hum of power lying underneath, coiled tight like a snake. It called to him. It always had.
“You’ve been touched by time,” he said when he answered the door, peering up at Dean from behind thick glasses. “Not yet, but you will be.”
She only hoped that it would be the end of their losses. They didn’t have much left.
“Go put your gear away,” his dad instructs.
“Sam's dreams hadn't stopped before?” Missouri asked sharply.
“What’s that?” Sam asked.
But there was nothing there, either. The ceiling was just as bare as the rest of the room.
Still, he can’t help it. The thought recurs:
Dean Winchester shrugged.
“Right,” Steven said. “Yes.” He studied Sam, then added, with a note of criticism, “And you’re still abysmally stuck in the present, I see. You’re going to have a passing slip in the timeline on Wednesday and you won’t even notice that it’s happening. After everything I’ve taught you. How disappointing.” He tutted.
“Dean.”
“Honey, everyone talks to Steven,” Tess said. “The only alternative is to never leave the house. He’s everywhere.”
That was a fair point, actually.
Dean hovered unhappily in the threshold. He glanced over his shoulder at Sam, only to find his brother grinning into his sleeve. He always seemed inordinately pleased to watch Dean being scolded. Dean glared until Sam schooled his expression.
“It’s Marlene,” Sam said under his breath.
But he still waited until they had left the room to resume the washing, eyes following them warily until they’d disappeared from view.
Dede gave him a disapproving frown, but even she couldn’t seem to work up more than a token defense for Marlene.
He is remembering, all of a sudden, many fragments of many things. A mosaic of times Dean looked, then looked away.
Suddenly, there was a thumping sound in Sam’s room. Just once. A single, dull thud.
“It was mentally scarring!” Sam said. “Both times! Just not, you know - give-me-actual-trauma scarring. And besides.” He hesitated. “Why would I dream about that? About how Mom died?”
“Shaddup,” Dean said. “Or you can’t have any.”
“I can’t believe we just hid a body -” Sam started
“That’s forever!” Patience said.
The man in Missouri Moseley’s living room was coming apart at the seams.
Marlene’s mouth dropped open in surprise as he jerked his thumb over his shoulder at the large sign that read, ‘MAGICAL REMEDIES ARE NOT A SUBSTITUTE FOR SEEKING A LICENSED MEDICAL DOCTOR’S PROFESSIONAL ADVICE’ in block letters. Her lips flapped wordlessly for a moment, which gave her wrinkled face the sudden appearance of a rapidly deflating balloon. Dean cleared his throat.
“I’ll put a little bit in for you,” she said. “Careful - it’s hot.”
But Missouri had already met the love of her life. She had lost him, too. She knew both sides of that terrible devotion - the security and the grief. She also knew something else. She knew her son - James, fourteen years old now - was crouched at the top of the stairs just out of sight, inconspicuously listening in.
But it’s not Dean. Dean is not that. He is not a shambling, loathsome corpse, destroyed and destroying. He is not some persecuted nun, hiding shamefully in the dark, groping desperately with another woman, afraid, ugly, dead. He is not -
“Missouri…” he began. “What if something happens? What if Dean gets hurt, and it’s my fault, because of something I did or didn't do?”
“Maybe not exactly the same kind,” Sam said with a wince. “Pamela’s never said anything to him about me, has she?”
Later, he tells his dad that the lock of hair was tucked into a bible. It’s a dumb thing to lie about. Lying to his dad for any reason whatsoever is dumb, even if there’s no chance of getting caught. But Dean can’t help it. He’s not sure why. Even the memory of that book feels incriminating. Because he burned it. Because he didn’t want to burn it. Because the words are still burned into his mind - both the poem and the nun’s prediction.
Sam rolled up his sleeves and picked up a clean washcloth to help with the drying. There was evidence in the kitchen laundry basket to suggest that Dean had already done several rounds of dishes.
When they were done with that, she turned to him and said, “Let’s take a look at you, then. Come with me to the reading room.”
Note about canon: I initially had this on the first chapter and then deleted it because I was actually sticking pretty close to canon aside from the AU stuff, but with the arrival of angels, it's now become relevant again. So -
“You, uh, you doing okay there, Mr. Fortinsky?” Dean asked warily.
“Fine, my kind. Witches.”
“I mean, theoretically if you had enough power it wouldn’t matter what kind of…”
“We want you to take a look at Sam,” Dean said. “It might be nothing, but just in case.”
At first glance, Rising Sun Magic Supply looked like little more than a cluttered pawn shop. The front windows were crammed with signs and displays that blocked out most of the natural light, and the interior lighting was dim. Long, deep shadows spilled through the maze of towering shelves, gathering here and there in its nooks and crannies. The layout appeared random, but it had actually been carefully set out to fit all of their stock while still somehow managing to meet ADA regulations. If you pulled up one of the many colorful rugs that covered the concrete floor, you could see the chalk markings from where Sam had measured it all with a yardstick. Well, you'd see the chalk markings, plus a few other things, too.
“Yeah,” Sam said. “That’s how Dad always said it went down, anyway.”
“On the other hand,” Sam said, “is it a good idea to trust the guy who knows how to hide a body?”
“Whoa there, kiddo,” Dean said, setting his handful of silverware down in a pile on the table so he could hoist the four year old up into his arms. “What’s got you so excited?”
“The handsome one, of course,” Dean said. “And this is my baby brother, Sam.”
“Dean, where are you?” Sam asked.
Come to think of it, if it was Dean, he’d probably be a little mad, too.
“Yeah, I know,” Dean says. “Since when do you know poetry?”
One harrowing grave digging experience later, Sam and Dean returned home muddy and exhausted. They took several minutes to line the doors and windows with salt, per Bobby’s instructions, then collapsed onto the couch, both sporting hundred yard stares.
It’s Castiel that causes him to suddenly remember. Castiel, and Lily Sunder.
“It’s your turn,” he said, going back to his book. “I dealt with her last time.”
” Sam repeated, gesturing hysterically toward said body.
Singer Auto Salvage was a cluttered labyrinth of old, rusted out cars and car parts, tucked far back in the trees away from any neighbors or would-be prying eyes. Dean found himself immediately charmed by the place. It was the kind of home a serial killer would have. As a lifelong fan of horror movies, he deeply approved.
“You almost said vision, didn’t you?”
Business was slow. It usually was, although it tended to pick up a bit in the weeks leading up to Halloween. They did more business in October than the rest of the year combined. Halloween had come and gone, however, and weekdays were still weekdays. After the last customer had cleared out, Sam began closing up shop. As he was counting out the register, he thought he heard footsteps in the loft overhead. He raised his head to listen, a little annoyed. He’d just got done telling Dean not to go up there alone, too.
“You stay right there,” Missouri told him. “I don’t need you hovering pointlessly while I’m trying to concentrate.”
” the man on the other side of the line asked. He didn’t sound like he thought this was either likely or advisable.
Downstairs, Sam heard the shop door bang open. There were footsteps on the stairs.
“However?” he prompts.
John sagged in relief.
His gut churns.
“Hm,” Missouri said. She nodded thoughtfully. “I'll take a look after dinner.” Then she smiled. “Whatever it is, we'll sort it out. We always do, don't we?”
“It wasn’t like that,” Sam said, shaking his head. “This was too real, too lifelike. I didn’t know that I was dreaming at all until I woke up.”
“My sons,” John said. “Can you watch them for a little while?”
Whatever it is, they are there.
“Oh, Sam,” Missouri said. “Nothing's going to happen to your brother.”
“Who says they’re premonitions?” Dean asked. “You’ve never shown any kind of sign of clairvoyance before in your life. And you’ve done just about everything else.”
Winchesters do not feel bad for monsters. Not ever. And they certainly don’t relate to them. Dead or alive.
Sam sighed, but held up his hand and fist.
Dean and Castiel are sitting in the bunker together, nursing another round of beers. Sam has gone to bed, but Dean has yet to follow suit. He doesn’t want to leave Castiel alone like this. There is something jagged to the way he sits, blood still crusted to the side of his face from his fight with Ishim.
Dean and his dad had put the case together over the course of an afternoon, and they’re pretty sure they’ve got it all worked out. The nuns had been cremated and their ashes were scattered without ceremony, the church having forbidden them burial on consecrated ground. There must be something else still tying them here, something hidden in the mission - a rosary or a bible or something like that, most likely in their old quarters. It’s Dean’s job to go in and find it.
“Your boys need you,” Missouri said.
They busied themselves with setting the table as instructed until James, Tess, and Patience arrived. Patience let out a shriek of joy when she saw them through the entrance way and barely let Tess finish removing her shoes before she was hurtling herself into the dining room and throwing herself at Dean’s knees.
“If it isn’t the most beautiful woman in the world,” Dean greeted her. “Have you realized you’re too good for James yet?”
And Dean did understand. He had been there that night. He'd seen - he didn't know what he'd seen. All he could remember now was what he'd felt. So he never complained, never begged his dad to stay even though he wanted to, because he knew his dad was right. John had an important job to do.
“What the hell did she do to you?” Dean quickly crossed the room. He stepped gingerly over Marlene’s corpse and dropped to his knees to examine Sam for injuries. “Is that blood?”
“The problem is that it’s too general a stone for most complex magic,” Dede was saying. “It’s definitely versatile, but only at the sacrifice of precision.”
“You got a screw loose?” Dean asked. “I just saw you at your ballet recital two weeks ago.”
That was a lie. I know exactly where this is going and it's going to be a Journey. Tags and summary (and probably rating, too, tbh) to be updated as things go.
“I don't know, Dean,” Sam repeated, shaking his head. “I just don’t know.”
“Well, because he’s hunting the one that killed Mary, isn’t he?” Bobby said, like it was the most obvious thing in the world.
“You just keep looking after your brother,” Missouri said. “You’ve done a good job of it so far. Leave the worrying to the adults. Alright?”
The door opened just a crack, and the tupperware container of cookies came flying out. It struck Dean in the chest. He fumbled to catch it as the door slammed closed again, leaving them standing in a silence that hung with heavy finality.
They were just north of Omaha when Dean’s phone rang. He pulled it out of his pocket and glanced at the caller I.D.
“What else could it be?” Sam asked.
Sam hesitated.
Dean sank down to sit on the edge of Sam’s bed. Sam took another sip of his tea, focusing on its heat, its soft spice, and not on the crawling dread that the nightmare had brought him.
“Dean?” he tentatively called down the hall.
“No, it doesn’t. Does it? Let me look at that again. Sam. Sammy! Give it!
There was an even longer pause.
“There’s a dead body in my bedroom,” Sam said numbly. He glanced down at Dean. “A demon just attacked me - or something - and now there’s a body in my bedroom and Marlene is dead and
“You’ve gotta be kidding me,” Dean hissed. “Again?”
After dinner was finished, Dean and James cleared the dishes from the table while Dede and Tess played a clapping game with Patience. Missouri enlisted Sam's help in packing up a portion of leftovers for everyone to take home.
And Castiel is kissing him back.
Chapter title is 'Flaming Telepaths' by Blue Oyster Cult, a song written by and for Sam Winchester:
If the thing that had killed their mom had finally come back, then that meant, inevitably, their dad would be back, too.
“At the bar,” Dean said cheerfully. “Making some friends! You know, what Steven said the other day really got me thinking -”
“Come on, at least rock, paper, scissors me for it.”
“Uh, thanks?” Sam said, accepting it. He peered suspiciously down into its mouth.
“Bitch,” Dean tossed back, slipping out into the hall.
They made simultaneous noises of acknowledgement and retreated back into the hall, toward the dining room, past the framed photographs hanging on the wall. Sam paused to examine one from his high school graduation.
Dean, meanwhile, fished his cellphone out of his pocket and scrolled through his contacts until he reached their dad’s phone number. It rang for a long time, then went to voicemail.
In general, Dean's memories of those first few years after their dad had left them with Missouri were a vague jumble, broken apart and swallowed up by the confusion of his childish perspective and the passage of time. He remembered that James had babysat them a lot - always with some resentment - but when neither he nor Missouri had time, the task had fallen to whoever was available. He remembered a dozen different living rooms, a dozen different kitchens, some of them now lost or unrecognizable.
“Huh,” Dean said. “So why are you dreaming about it now?”
“Sam.”
The realization washes abruptly over Dean, startling and profound.
“There isn’t?” Steven asked. “That’s not possible. Let me see.”
“- underneath another body,” Dean finished. “Yeah, that was pretty messed up. Dad definitely never mentioned that part in any of his stories.”
John frowned, but took the tea.
“At least wait until we know more,” he said. “If we call him out here just for it to turn out to be a bad dream, he’ll be pissed.”
“Okey-doke,” Dean said. “Anyway, we were hoping we could take a look at some of Madam’s old stuff, if you’ve still got it.”
“Another one?” she asked.
I'm on Tumblr @amnesiawiife (two i's in wiife) if you're into that sort of thing.
“I just think,” Dean said carefully, “that if this has something to do with the thing that killed Mom, he would want us to call.” At Sam’s derisive snort, he insisted, “He’d want to know about it, Sam. He would.”
Sam couldn’t be sure that his room was empty, not really, and he had just heard -
“Is that so?” Dean asks distantly.
Her expression softened as she turned to give Dean a thorough once over, taking in the miserable slant to his mouth and the way Sam had positioned himself a few feet back, like an animal prepared to run at the first sign of danger.
“Never do that again!” John ordered. “Never! Do you understand? Witchcraft is dangerous, Dean. You start that, you’re gonna wind up dead. Or worse.”
“Just go to the bar or something,” he said. “Get a beer. Find a girl. I don’t care. Just don’t do it here.”
“Now say ‘ah,’” the demon said, and raised the wound to Sam’s mouth.
“You’re making that up,” Dean said, making a grab for the book. “Let me see.”
“That little demon pact you almost made way back when?” the demon interrupted, voice mocking. “It's not. But you should know what a riot we all thought that one was. You had us all nearly in stitches downstairs. It’s a shame Dean stopped you - we could’ve had all kinds of fun.”
“What the hell,” he says, leaning in a second time. “Heaven can just try and keep us out.”
“Cut it a little close, that’s all,” Dean lies. “But I got the job done, no sweat.”
“Marlene!” Dean greeted with false cheer, rounding the corner just as her long, manicured claws reached out for something on the shelf before her. “I thought I sensed your aura harmonizing with the store’s vibrations!”
“He’s what?” Sam croaked.
“It’s no use,” he said to Sam. “Dad’s not answering his phone.”
“Or two,” Bobby said warily. “What is it?”
Two ghosts; two dead nuns - they haunt a mission in Wyoming, a rundown old place that’s little more than a tourist trap these days. They killed themselves here back in the mid-19th century, after being found together in one of the cells.
He spends years doing that - he spends years playing chicken with that ghost, and he loses every time.
“So we’re back to square one,” Dean finally concluded. “Thick eyebrows and
“Sure,” Dean said. “I’ll give ol’ Cass a call, see if she can hook us up. In the meantime, how about we head over to Steven’s place? He got most of Madam’s books after she passed, didn’t he?”
Chapter title is 'Hallowed Be Thy Name' by Iron Maiden.
“Well,” Sam said, “according to Artemidorus, dreaming about a family member or loved one dying in a fire might actually mean that
Sam glanced across his room toward his desk where he kept all his ritual supplies, including his athame, his ceremonial blade, and wished that it wasn’t so far away. His knowledge lay mostly in rituals and runic work, but at least if he’d had his athame, he would have had a real weapon as some form of self-defense. He felt suddenly stupid clutching the salt shaker, as if it would be of remotely any use against the thing in front of him. Maybe if he could keep it talking, distract it...make a dive across the bed...
Patience eagerly rose to the occasion, starting on a long, vivid description of the otters she had seen. Eventually, with the help of James using his arm to imitate an elephant’s trunk, the easy mood returned.
“Yeah,” Sam said. “Just - just a bad dream.”
