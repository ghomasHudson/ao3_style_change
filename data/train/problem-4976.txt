Tony stares down at him with a wide grin and a strange expression. “Uh, good, better than I have in awhile.” Then, with a wince, Steve tacks on: “thanks.” And tries to ignore how his body aches when he pushes himself up.
“I need to borrow you.” He looks up from the still blank page on his sketchbook to Tony fidgeting in front of him. He looks like hell, dark circles under his eyes, skin drawn and tired.
Tony blinks for a minute before shrugging and flopping onto the couch beside Steve, curling up under his arm immediately and humming contentedly. “‘Kay.” He mumbles in a delayed response.
A little wine stain on the pocket of her shirt hits like a punch to the chest, Steve drinks whiskey usually, and Sharon doesn’t like red wine.
“You don’t have to apologize.” Natasha pulls her hand back and slips off of the arm of the couch to tuck in beside him. “None of this is your fault Steve.” Steve shifts over to give her space, only to bump into Tony. He hadn’t even noticed the genius sit down.
Steve didn’t see Tony for most of the day, finding himself alone in a crowded tower. Distracted, unfocused. Sam got the drop on him in training, ribbed him for not paying attention. Steve didn’t shoot anything back, he just left. Rooms blurred together, faces indistinct. Tony still missing. What could have scared him out of their bedroom? Usually after a nightmare Tony clings to comfort.
Tony turns and holds a hand out for Steve to take. “You’re lucky I love you.” Again, his words contradict his face, voice and actions. Steve takes his hand and lets himself get pulled lovingly onto the plane.
Instantly guilty, Steve offers the snatched blanket back. “Sorry, Tony, I didn’t mean to wake you up, I’m sorry.” He stumbles over his words in a rush to go back upstairs. Tony scrambles out of his blanket burrito to catch him.
It’s silent in the bedroom, Tony curls up on his side, back to Steve in a ball. “I’m sorry.” He whispers after a few terse moments of silence, still not turning around. Steve bolts up.
Steve hates how the events make him jumpy for days, stuck in oversensitive skin. He doesn’t want to hold hands, or hug, let alone have sex. But events do the opposite for Sharon. She hates sharing, needs the reassurance that Steve is hers. So, he deals with scratches that feel like gashes, bite marks far too painful to even be considered pleasurable. Hot skin against his, like he’s being burned. It can’t always be about you she tells him I have needs too.
Their bedroom smells like some floral shampoo that makes Steve’s nose itch, which is weird because SHIELD insists on a scent free environment especially in the field. Sharon’s clothes are balled in the corner of their bedroom, clearly she was in a rush.
Tony huffs “yeah and I promised to stop eating dairy, but Ben and Jerry’s named a flavour after me so-“ he shrugs “- promises get broken sometimes.”
By now, Steve has closed his book, giving his disgruntled partner his full attention. “You’re upset, because strangers assume you get dicked down by Captain America?” He can’t resist the shit eating smirk when Tony chokes on his own breath, watching him over dramatically flail and cough.
Tony glares. “Jesus Christ Cap warn a man!” He sounds amused instead of annoyed, so Steve presses on.
“I don’t cheat.” Tony jumps, spinning around and throwing a wrench at whoever or whatever managed to get into his lab. Steve ducks, narrowly avoiding having his head taken off.
“Tonight’s on me Tones, you’ve done, so much.” His voice goes soft at the end, looking around at the yellow lamps illuminating cobblestone roads in awe. Tony huffs, crossing his arms and narrowing his eyes.
She rocks back on her heels, chin snapping back. “What did you say?” Low and meant to intimidate him, it’s her ‘you’re in shit’ voice and it has Steve swallowing convulsively.
He follows after her, a dog with its tail tucked. Makes sure he follows close, smiling when he should, socializing where he should, never stepping away from Sharon. By the end of the night everything hurts, he feels like a puppet with tangled strings. But she gives him an appraising look and says “that wasn’t so hard, now was it?” And the relief nearly knocks his legs out from under him, his brain fuzzes out, she’s happy. This is a good sign.
The elevator stops once on the way down, pausing long enough for Tony to get in. “Miss Carter.” He deadpans before turning his attention to Steve with a much brighter smile. “Capsicle.” Steve’s smile falls before it fully hits his face and Tony’s expression drops in return. “you okay buddy? You don’t look so hot.”
“Do you want to go back to bed?” Tony asks gently, stroking his thumb back and forth across Steve’s collarbone. He doesn’t, not really, he’s terrified if he falls asleep Bucky will be there again, taunting him, blaming him for the fall,
The lights flash bright and die out, leaving him alone in the dark. Ice water seeping in, the plane slowly sinking. Icy water soaks his boots, creeping up his calves, over his knees. He may have survived the crash, but looking around, Steve realizes there’s no way out of this plane. He’s going to die.
“You pushed too hard Rogers.” Natasha curls up on the couch beside him, neatly folding her legs over his lap. Instinctively, Steve reaches to hold her there, even as his skin burns. He doesn’t open his eyes, keeping his arm draped over his face.
“I should be asking you.” He pushes himself up to lean against the headboard. The sheets slip dangerously low and Steve aborts his eyes, pink colouring up his throat into his cheeks.
“Thanks Tasha,” Steve cradles it close to his chest as he leans into Tony’s side again. Natasha crouches down in front of him, giving an encouraging smile and putting her hand on his knee, careful to keep her nails away from his skin.
The water looks black, dark, cold. The glass shatters on impact, the plane jolting to a sudden stop that snaps his neck back painfully. Black spots invade his vision for a minute, curses not fit even for a soldier pouring out of his mouth, but miraculously, he’s not dead.
When two people connect, really connect, the details of how and where and why don’t seem to matter anymore. With Sharon, it was always work, doing what made her happy to keep her happy. When the person is wrong, everything else has to be perfect for it to work.
“Steve!” Tony cries out, reaching a shaking hand out for Steve, pleading for help. The Soldier wraps flesh arm around Steve’s chest, holding him tight. “Steve! Stop!” Tony’s voice comes from The Soldier, freezing Steve where he kneels.
“Steve, honey, can you let me go?” A soft voice asks from under him. Steve looks around frantically, where did Bucky go? Where did The Soldier go? He looks down, staring into wide, startled eyes.
Tony looks around, checking for company before leaning closer. “Steve got with Sharon-“ Bucky wrinkles his nose “-I know. She’s a manipulative bitch. She’s been fucking with Cap’s brain for months, he won’t listen to me- us. He won’t listen to us.”
Tony groans, following him into the kitchen and hopping up onto the counter so they’re level. “Alright, well, my wrists were bruised last week, what makes this any different?”
Steve frowns, “Oh, alright,” wrapping his arms around himself and sighing softly he continues. “I’ll see you when you get back then.” He’d never argue about work. Sharon’s job is the most important thing, she’s close to getting a promotion.
Tony slides closer, wrapping an arm around Steve’s shoulders and he leans into the embrace for a moment before remembering to pull away. “No. You’re the one not understanding. Cap, what she’s doing isn’t okay.”
Tony pushes the bill more towards Steve and winks. “Just fucking with you Cap, have at it.” He gets up with flourish and strides towards the restrooms, leaving Steve with to chuckle to himself and pull out his card. He shakes his head fondly and pays, posing for a picture and signing an autograph for the starry eyed waitress they send over.
Steve lifts his hands to let his genius settle in and fondly smiles to himself as Tony flips around to stare at him. He hasn’t been sleeping enough, Steve notes, poorly concealed dark rings under his eyes and wrinkles that seem to get worse the less he sleeps. Faint smudges of black that could be motor oil, or grease, that he tried to wipe away speak to what the genius does while Steve sleeps.
The thing is, people have needs. When those needs aren’t met, people go elsewhere. That’s why people cheat, they’re not getting what they need, or what they think they need, from their partner.
Sensing eyes on him, Tony looks up, pausing and smiling up at Steve. “What?” Steve smiles fondly down, reaching out to thread his fingers through the damp hair.
“Didn’t get enough sleep?” Bucky reaches out to steady Tony when he reels back, smirking over at Steve. Before Steve can shoot back a smart ass comment, Tony flinches back like he’s been burned, stumbling over his own feet in his haste to get away from Bucky’s hands.
Bucky raises an eyebrow but doesn’t comment on the slip up. “Dumbass.” He mutters, downing the rest of the whiskey and setting the cup gently on the coffee table.
Tony reaches out, carding his fingers through short, blonde hair and humming. “Besides, your wrists were
Any type of job takes away from someone’s home life, some more than others. SHIELD takes more people from home lives than most organizations, permanently or temporarily.
Suddenly self conscious, Steve wraps an arm around his stomach. “Gotta watch my figure.” He goes for the joke, which flops. Bucky arches an eyebrow disbelieving.
Steve didn’t get it before, the obsession with sex and love, how couples seem to practically glow in each other’s presence.
Even with Steve’s arms around his waist, his strong heartbeat keeping time, it takes a long time for Tony to be able to close his eyes without seeing the hollow blue green eyes lifeless and spattered with blood.
Peggy sounds terrified. They don’t have time to get Howard. “There’s not enough time, this things movin’ too fast an’ it’s heading for New York.” Thinning air means he’s gasping for each breath, glass shattering more from air pressure, shards of glass sting his skin worse than icy wind.
“I don’t know what’s wrong with me.” He whimpers like a broken record, giving voice to the words circling his brain. Tony takes his hand, leading him towards the massive bathroom beside his bedroom.
“I’m tired Steve. I can talk to you later but right now I need sleep. So just, shh, for a bit, please?” He shuts up with a short nod, telling her about Bucky’s homecoming can wait. She heads to their bedroom, and strips, curling under the blankets and falling asleep.
“I love you.” Tony whispers, letting Steve pull him in tight, slipping one arm over his stomach and a leg hitching up over Steve’s. They’ll be okay, Steve doesn’t bother trying to hide his fond smile, warmth spreading from his chest as he wraps an arm around Tony’s waist and tugs, pulling him onto his lap.
Dropping his gaze and turning away, he apologizes again. “Really Tony, I’m sorry for waking you, I’ll just....” He gestures behind him and turns to leave. Tony grabs his wrist and, even though he’s gentler then need be, Steve flinches.
“Do you feel like ice cream? I feel like ice cream.” Peter freezes in place, bag dangling from his fingers
Steve licks his lips, considering reaching out to stop the genius and, with a burst of confidence, rushes out: “What if I don’t want you to?”
He rubs hard at his face, “I don’t know what’s wrong with me.” The confession hurts, ripping out of his chest into the open air. Cold weight of vulnerability disappears before it can fully settle in, chased away by Tony’s hard hug.
Natasha yanks her hand back, clutching it to her chest with wide eyes. “Steve, honey, it’s okay, take a breath for me.” Tony steps into his line of vision and Steve huffs out his breath, Tony’s here, he’s safe. As his heart slows, everything slips into place. Sharon’s gone, Natasha’s here with his things, Natasha was touching his hair, he’s safe.
“You failed, you’ve never been good enough.” The Brooklyn drawl makes it worse, and Steve is so focused on Bucky he almost misses the sense of ‘right behind you’ raising the hair on the back of his neck. He whips around, shield barely coming up in time to block the metal arm.
He uselessly tugs his collar higher, “It’s not always about me.” An automatic reply drilled into his brain. It can’t always be about him. Sharon has needs too.
He chews his lip, swallowing hard around the lump in his throat. “Is that a yes?” For a question that hasn’t really been asked, it hangs heavily in the air between them. For second, Steve thinks Tony might actually bolt.
Sharon backs towards the door. “You’re worthless without me.” She tells him over Tony’s shoulder. “I wasted my time trying to fix you, clearly. You’re broken Steve. No one else is ever going to love you.”
Steve breathes a shaky laugh, shaking his head and gently wrapping his hand around Tony’s arms, feeling the pulse thrumming through his wrists. He’s okay. Safe. “I’ve got you, sweetheart, I’m gonna be fine.” Tony ducks his head to press a kiss to the junction of Steve’s neck.
With Tony, it’s as easy as breathing. They don’t struggle to communicate, not like this. It’s intuitive, and Steve knows that it wouldn’t matter where they were, or what happened, this would always be easy.
Stroking the side of his face, Steve promises. “Never. Never sweetheart.” Neither of them know if he’s telling the truth. In their line of work, how could they? Every time they walk out that door could be the time one, or both of them don’t come back. But for now, it’s good enough.
Tony slowly puts down the screwdriver he was brandishing as a weapon. “Okay...? Thanks for the heads up?” Steve scowls, running a hand through tangled blonde hair and letting out a frustrated groan.
Tony gives a short, humourless laugh. “And where were you last night, Miss Carter?” Steve had nearly forgotten he was here, so focused on keeping his hands from shaking and his knees from giving out.
“Okay.” Tony says hoarsely, nodding. “You’re right.” Steve sways back with relief, already feeling Sharon’s hold on him lessen.
“He said he’s done. He’s not going with you. You’re done manipulating him. Get the fuck out of my apartment before I call the cops.” Tony thankfully speaks up again, walking away from Steve to crowd Sharon towards the door. Cool air fills the space he used to stand and Steve shivers, vulnerable and open.
“Don’t want me to what?” Tony asks slowly, eyes narrowing to watch Steve with laser precision. Steve shifts in place, chewing his bottom lip again.
“V’got a sketchbook under a loose floorboard in the bedroom.” At least, he thinks he put it back. In his rush to get out, the entirety of the night is a blur.
He pulls against the hands, they can’t take him from Steve, not even now. “Tony, Tony come on.” The voice doesn’t fit, barely breaking through the wailing, it’s coming from him, Tony realizes, loud, guttural sobs. “Tony! Come on, you’re alright.” The body in front of him disappears, leaving only a pool of blood before the world turns black.
“Stand down! We can’t- fuck!- we can’t do this!” He’s seen Steve any before, of course. But never before has Tony had this level of anger directed at him. Steve slams the shield down on Tony’s chest and the metal caves, cutting deep into the skin around the reactor. It burns and involuntary tears burn at his eyes.
Tony tucks his still warm blanket around Steve, fussing quietly. “I can’t get out of my head tonight.” Steve confesses in the safety of a mostly dark room. Tony stills for a second, quickly covering it up by tucking himself up and fully facing Steve.
It’s cold. The suit does little with how damaged it is. Warnings flash every half second, it’s distracting. Wind bites through the suit, turning his skin to ice and making bruises and cuts ache more. Metal against metal, Tony hits the wall, just keep breathing.
“Did you know that people assume you’re the top?” His voice is almost accusatory, Steve doesn’t flinch. He simply places his finger down on the page to hold his place and looks up with squinty eyed confusion.
Stunned, Tony starts tossing phrases a mile a minute. “Top and bottom, you know, pitching and catching, guy and girl, Dom or sub, kinda, in the right circumstance, though, not always the case…” He trails off before remembering his original point. “Like, who gives it, and who takes it.”
When Sharon wakes up, Steve hears her head for the shower and puts his sketchbook away, blushing when he catches his first real look at the drawing.
On the other hand, if someone steps in, and says to the frog that it’s boiling? The frog might not believe them. Someone has to step in and take the frog from the water to prove to it that the water was killing it.
Bucky has been off on his own for awhile, travelling, recovering, reconnecting. He comes back brown as a nut and looking years younger, freshly cut hair and neatly trimmed stubble.
“I gotcha, it wasn’t real Tony.” He feels more than hears the words. But it does the trick to slow his galloping heart and help him get in a real breath, his senses coming back slowly. Acting on instinct, Tony reaches out, locking his arms around Steve’s neck and burying his face deep in the crook of his neck.
The past is a disease. You can’t escape once you’re in. Sharon tries to keep him out of the past, she helps him get rid of his record player, buys him an iPhone, introduces him to Spotify. She switches out his wardrobe, his soaps, fabric softener, bed sheets. Anything Old she says. It’s gotta go and so, go it does. Spotify is nice, but Steve misses his record player sometimes.
Morning light filters through tinted windows, warming burgundy sheets. Steve definitely missed his morning run, but with Tony tracing abstract patterns across his chest, he can’t find it in himself to mind.
Stomach twisting, Steve opens his mouth to reply, his face starting to heat up. A knock on the door saves them both from an argument. Tony is up in a second, scrambling for pants. Steve isn’t far behind, ignoring dull pains to pull a pair of sweatpants up his hips.
“Tony.” Steve cuts him off gently, moving slowly to take a flailing hand in his own. “You have nothing to apologize for. What I did was wrong. I hurt you sweetheart, and you never have to apologize for how you react to being hurt.”
He jerks his chin towards the kitchen hotly stating: “You just don’t want them thinking I can, how did you say, ‘dick you down’.” Steve startles and groans, his own inherent stubbornness taking over, telling him to shoot back.
A lot of things in life can be like a frog in a pot of water. It’s why people put on fronts when they meet other people, don’t show them the truth until it’s too late for them to run.
Laughing, Steve throws his hands up. “What do you want me to say! Why does it matter if strangers assume, correctly might I add, that you’re a- a-“ He struggles for a second, “- a bottom!” Tony whips around, mouth agape and glaring with the force of a thousand angry men.
Dirt and fire explode to his left, someone yells. He can’t tell who, he doesn’t know if they’re hurt, dead, captured. He can’t even tell if they’re on the same side or not. He can barely get the shield up in time when someone shoots at him, the ringing echos into his ears.
Both men freeze, a look of cautious hope taking over Tony’s face while Steve nearly trembles with nerves, looking all too ready to bolt.
Steve watches, once again, as the short brunette walks to the doors like he owns the place. “You asked for this-“ He gestures at himself cockily “quite explicitly if I remember correctly.” Steve is again, left to shoot guilty looks at the staff and chase Tony outside.
“For once, I don’t think I’m gonna argue with you.” Tony pulls him into a bone crushing hug, cupping the back of his neck. Steve melts into the affection, he hasn’t seen Tony since Sharon moved them into the apartment, her apartment. “Shit, the apartment! My stuff, Tony I-I need to go back-“
Steve does that a lot, he’s accepted he doesn’t really understand today, and Sharon does, she’s right. She’s always right and he always listens, accepts her superiority, smiles and doesn’t let it bug him. It shouldn’t, times have changed and he hasn’t caught up. Won’t catch up, she reminds him, that’s why you have me.
He stands, ignoring the hands offered to help him out. “Tony, sweetheart, you okay?” A barely there flinch, but a flinch nonetheless and Steve back-pedals, trying to ignore the brick in his stomach. Tony doesn’t answer, stepping over the shattered mug and barrelling to the elevator.
Steve chews at his lower lip, reaching for the door twice before pulling it open. “Uh, thanks Tony.” He mutters, keeping his eyes low.
It’s demanding, time consuming and taxing on the employees and their families, so when Sharon stays out late, leaves early or doesn’t come home all together Steve doesn’t question it. He’s been there.
The corners of Tony’s eyes soften when he looks at Steve, though his jaw clenches when he looks back to Sharon. “Nope.” He agrees, popping the p “but it is his.” He jerks a thumb in Steve’s direction. Steve, who swallows hard and jerks his chin up, with shaking hands buried in his pockets, he’s sure he looks more confident than he feels.
The white cotton threads have off white stains that don’t fit the pattern, and pink lipstick stains on the collar. His stomach revolts, she wouldn’t, it’s just, from an undercover stint, it has to be.
In this century women don’t like being pushed around. Steve didn’t know they were pushed around before, Peggy certainly wasn’t. Today, women get to be in control.
Tony drops his keys in the bowl as he walks in the front door to his floor, kicking off his shoes and loosening his tie. Steve doesn’t even look up from his book, one foot tucked under his body, the other resting on the floor. “How was ice cream?” He asks, turning the page. Tony huffs, tossing his suit jacket over the back of a lounge chair.
“Oh Steve,” She squeezes his hand, pushing the elevator button with her other hand. “You won’t, that’s why you have me.” Steve tries to ignore the ice in his veins, the wind that isn’t really there, the way his stomach clamps in on itself and his heart seems to freeze.
“Don’wanna sleep alone.” He mutters, barely above a whisper and his oversized army tee shirt doesn’t go unnoticed. “Can I?”
Steve falls back, not even wincing when the wooden bed-frame smashes against his spine. His hearing hollows, vision tunnelling while he gasps for a solid breath.
“Yeah we did a social experiment on it last week.” Peter looks mindlessly over the ice cream in the freezers, like he’s commented on the weather and not gay sex. The girl behind the counter giggles as Tony sputters, suddenly remembering his date on Monday night when the waiter had placed the cheque down in front of Steve, despite the fact that Tony is the known billionaire.
The morning sun brings Tony slowly to consciousness, with a headache looming threateningly. Steve runs his hand up and down his back a few times. “I turned off your alarm, figured you could use the rest.” He doesn’t sound sorry.
Steve ends the call, half crawling half scrambling to the bathroom to throw up. The world tilts, spinning and changing every time his eyes flicker.
Those clever fingers trial down his jaw, lifting until Steve looks up. “Your nightmares aren’t going to scare me away Steve. I’m not going anywhere.” He smiles gently, thumb swiping across Steve’s lower lip. Steve can’t fight the fond smile, and he doesn’t want to.
Steve swallows hard, shifting the towel and trying to hide his reaction. “Tony?” The roaming eyes snap up to meet his own, tongue darting out to wet his lips. “What- what do you..?”
“You’re the one who doesn’t know what he’s talking about Steve, like I said. I’ve been there and I know what’s gonna happen. You want to believe her, but she’s lying. You better start running pal, cause all she’s gotta do is tell you anything you wanna hear and you’ll be fifty shades of fucked. Get out while you can.” It’s intense, Tony speaks urgently, tired eyes flickering back and forth across Steve’s face. When he doesn’t respond, staring blankly down, Tony sighs heavily, looking ten years older and defeated.
He doesn’t want to die. He’s barely done anything with his life, there’s so much left to do. Beeping bomb alerts finalize his fate. “I gotta put’er in the water.” Peggy begs him not to, says there’s other options. If he doesn’t people will die. He was meant for more that dancing in tights. Maybe this is it.
“What’s wrong?” He’s frowning, taking Steve in with the laser focus of a sniper. Steve just shakes his head, not the time, not the place. “No. Seriously, punk, you’re skinny as hell, what have they been feeding you?”
“Yeah, I guess they only got it half right. You’re like a mostly-bottom” Steve agrees, wrapping an arm around Tony, who smirks, waving at a guy across the street who is staring and not at all subtly taking a photo. Steve also smile and waves, like he’s not talking about their sex life on the streets of Italy.
Realization doesn’t dawn on him, it hits him like a dump truck after lunch. Tony made an appearance, grabbed a mug of coffee and accepted a plate of sliced fruits from Natasha. When he turned back around, entirely ignoring Steve, he nearly walks right into Bucky’s chest.
“There is nothing wrong with you Steve.” Tony murmurs into his ear, pressing Steve’s face gently into his shoulder and clinging hard. “You’re just too good. People take advantage of that.” They’re not talking about the past anymore, but Steve can’t bring himself to feel defensive, his cheek still burns, the claw marks across his shoulders and arms still sting. He’s too raw to handle anything else.
that bruised last week, I have more self control than that.” Tony makes an understanding hum, tugging on blonde hair until Steve’s eyes flutter shut.
Hot water pours from all angles of the shower, already steaming and Steve throws himself in, desperate to melt the ice. It hurts, defrosting was hell the first time, hurts more now. But it’s working, barely, he can’t see his breath, and he’s not solid.
“I know that look. You’re not even hearing me. When you want out, and you will want out, let me know.” And he rushes away, almost running towards the elevator and leaving Steve in an empty, cold hallway.
“Sharon, sweetheart, there is no one else. I promise you. It was a mistake. I’m sorry.” He reaches for her, trying not to let the hurt show when she smacks his hand away.
Steve yanks the shield up high and Tony holds his hands above his face. He’s not going to fight, it was always going to end like this for him. Violent and bloody, he just never thought Steve would be on the other end. The shield falls in slow motion, and Tony squeezes his eyes shut tightly, he doesn’t want to see this.
“I am not-!” Steve arches an eyebrow “… They’re strangers! How does it not bother you!?” Tony switches tactics but squawks again at Steve’s nonchalant shrug.
“O-Kay...?” Steve drawls slowly, not quite understanding. Tony says a lot, and a lot of it isn’t understandable, most of it comes out wrong. It’s his unique brand of charm.
Steve resumes rubbing his back, tracing his fingertips in casual patterns. “We were cleaning up after, something, something was wrong, you, uhm-“ Steve can feel Tony shudder and threads his fingers through his partner’s hair, crooning encouragements. Tony mumbles something unintelligible, fingers digging into the skin of Steve’s sides.
When the person is right, the world shrinks, in that moment, amidst the heat and sweat and soft cries, nothing else matters.
When Steve wakes, he’s alone, but the bed is still warm so Tony can’t have gone far. Sun streaming through the windows tells him he slept through his morning run, but he’s pretty sure he’d earned a day off.Slowly, Steve gets out of bed, making his way into the hallway.
It’s not an excuse, simply an explanation. In most cases, those needs are physical and not needs so much as wants. Sometimes, people seek out deeper emotional attachments, because they’re not getting the intimacy they need.
“Motherfucker.” Tony curses sympathetically and sits beside him, dabbing at the hot liquid on his arms so they don’t blister. “How’d you find out?” He asks softly.
“…right…” Steve nods slowly, like he understands “Tony-“ Tony’s head snaps up and he freezes in place, letting out a little ‘hm?’ “Is this, some sort of… sex thing?”
Stomach in knots, Tony lands the suit six feet away from Steve, mask flipping back and muggy air replacing air conditioning. No wonder Steve is coated in sweat. With a lopsided grin reminiscent of a puppy Steve pulls his helmet off and shakes his hair out.
Natasha scoffs, sitting higher to thread her fingers through his hair. “Is it ever?” Steve ignores her. He doesn’t know what to say. It’s not a secret Natasha doesn’t like Sharon. No one in the tower really likes her, and she certainly doesn’t like them. But for some reason he doesn’t defend her.
“Yeah Steve, you do.” His voice is hardly louder than a whisper. “I don’t want to hurt you more than you already are.” He admits, looking down at his feet.
Monday nights are date nights, Tony’s way of combatting the Monday blues. He had texted Steve earlier saying: Pizza tonight, authentic Italian place, I’ll pick you up. And Steve had been excited, there’s nothing authentically anything in New York other than American and sometimes it can be exhausting.
He falters forward a step. “Buck, you know I tried.” His voice is small, a scared kid from Brooklyn all over again. The shield feels too big, the uniform doesn’t fit, he doesn’t belong here.
“Don’t be so dramatic. I’m sure whatever you wanted to do can wait a day.” She rolls her eyes over her shoulder at him, grabbing her jacket and slinging her purse over her shoulder.
“Tony, I-“ another hand wave and the music drowns out any apology or accusation Steve could have come up with.
. Nothing about the war, the plane, the ice. The last of his chill washes away with soap, leaving him warm and calm. The whole time, Tony stays uncharacteristically quiet, letting him gather his thoughts in peace, watching him grow softer, more pliable with each press of his fingers.
Another sleepless night in skin that doesn’t fit sends Steve out of his room, carefully, he doesn’t want to disturb Sharon. She hates when he wakes her up at night. He finds himself in the common room, grabbing for a blanket and flopping with more force than strictly necessary, he has so much pent up frustration lately and not nearly enough punching bags to take it out on.
“Stay out of my relationship Stark.” Steve spits, drawing his shoulders down and back defensively. A move that makes him seem bigger than he already is. Tony gives a barely there flinch before imitating him.
“I think that’s the first smart thing you’ve ever said.” Sharon turns her back on Tony, strutting out towards the elevator. “Get someone to get your shit out of my apartment before I get home tonight.”
Steve slowly maneuvers them back horizontal on the bed, rubbing one hand up and down Tony’s back despite the drying sweat. “Wanna talk ‘bout it?” He’s quiet and soothing, not serious or demanding and he doesn’t react when Tony shakes his head. “Alright honey, go back to sleep, I’ve gotcha.” He murmurs as he pulls the blankets back up over them, rolling onto his back and pulling Tony on top of him.
Now that she’s gone, every muscle in his body shakes, he’s freezing, it’s like an out of body experience, on one level, he’s freaking out, terrified of retaliation and terrified of not being with her, he doesn’t think he knows how to live without her. On another level, he’s already compartmentalizing.
“FRIDAY. Lights.” The bedroom illuminates slightly, Tony rolls over, the lights making the red rimming his eyes more obvious. He’s been crying, Steve swallows hard against the lump in his throat. “What’ve you gotta be sorry about?”
Steve looks back up to his face, winking. “It’s a nice ass.” He shrugs, can’t be helped. Tony’s lips twitch and he points another accusing finger.
Steve frowns, rebound? Equal parts panic and shame twist in his stomach, of course that’s what Tony thinks, if the situation was reversed Steve would think the same thing.
Steve moves over even more immediately. “Tony, Honey this is your bed, ‘course y’can.” Tony nods once to himself and crawls in, keeping a distance between them that hurts somewhere in Steve’s chest.
Tony shakes his head, holding a hand out. “Cap it’s fine, it’s a thing now, a common thing.” He doesn’t make eye contact however, and any trace of relaxation vanishes, leaving cold panic. Steve reaches to grab the genius’s hand before he can get out of the bed.
“Captain Rogers, Agent Carter is demanding entrance.” FRIDAY calls quietly into his silent space. Steve huffs a sound too close to a whimper for comfort, wedging himself deeper between the couch and the wall. “Would you like me to tell her now is not a good time?”
She rests her hand gingerly on his shoulder, ready to yank back if Steve responds negatively. It takes too much effort to hide his flinch as manicured nails drop onto his bare skin. He knows, rationally, that it’s Natasha and there’s nothing she would do to hurt him, but on some level, Sharon is back, and those nails are about to dig into his skin until he does what she wants.
“Do you think Captain Rogers would help me?” He’s so innocent, wide Bambi eyes full of hope and wonder. The hero worship still hasn’t really worn off and with Peter, Tony kinda hopes it won’t. He loves seeing the kid get excited over Steve. Speak of the devil, Tony smirks to himself pulling his phone out.
“Just because I’m dating you doesn’t mean you get to be a perv about it.” Steve flinches but nods, bad call on his part. Not that he was trying to be a perv, but clearly that’s how he came across.
Tony raises an eyebrow. “This? The talking? Or do you mean the cuddling on the couch? Or is it the dinner dates? Or the Waffle House? How could I ever get the wrong idea.” He scoffs, shaking his head. “I don’t know who you think I am Captain, but I’m not a home wrecker. Don’t worry, your shitty relationship isn’t in danger. Well..... at least not from me.”
“Honey I’d be taking advantage of you, I’m not what you need right now.” Tony looks down, shoulder slumping. What he needs? Flashes of Sharon telling him what he needs, what she needs and what he doesn’t need disorient him.
Tony bolts up with a choked sob, sheets sticking to sweat soaked skin. The dark room a drastic contrast from the bright sun and blood covered pavement. He gasps, hand pressed hard to his chest, clutching at the reactor. Hands are still pressing on his shoulders.
When he only tenses further, Steve instinctively reaches out to rub between Tony’s shoulder blades. “It’s Sharon, you know, your girlfriend.” The shrill, snarky voice makes Steve’s once reassuring hand freeze in place, gripping Tony’s shoulder for stability.
He opens his mouth, shuts it, licks his lips and finally huffs in a mixture of exasperation and defeat. “What’s that supposed to mean?”
“They don’t understand how to stop being selfish, Sweetie. You’re learning.” Sharon kisses his cheek, squeezes his shoulder and lets herself out.
“Stevie.” Bucky starts lowly. “What the fuck didja do?” It’s unsettling to have that threatening voice aimed at him, as opposed to in defence of him, but suddenly everything clicks. The brick in Steve’s stomach gets heavier, nausea forcing him to swallow hard.
“You’re the one with the reputation.” Hurt flickers across Tony’s mask, he reels backwards and flicks his tongue across his lips.
Damn. Bucky knows him too well to fool him. Which is usually refreshing, but today? Steve just wants him to take things at face value. “Nothin Buck, come on, tell me all about Japan.”
“I love you too Tony.” Steve signals for FRIDAY to turn the lights off again and lays back down, waiting for Tony to wriggle into place on his chest before locking his fingers together around Tony’s back and closing his eyes. Both men sleep free of nightmares.
“That’s not your business, Stark.” Is Sharon’s cool response, not even glancing away from Steve, leaving him pinned under her gaze. He looks to Tony for help, pleading with his eyes to get her out of here before his body betrays him.
Tony hums in the kitchen, swaying gently to music only he can hear while eggs sizzle in a pan. Hickies dot their way up his neck and chest. “Ain’t you a sight for sore eyes.” Steve drawls, leaning against the doorway. Tony turns, grinning widely and holding a hand out.
Steve doesn’t fight Sharon’s control. She’s been repressed for so long she deserves to have control. She tells him under the security of darkness about what it’s like, why she needs to have some control. She tells him about being promoted by men who just wanted in her pants, about being rejected for job after job for being a woman, about being cheated on and cast aside because she’s not perfect wife material, too interested in her work.
Steve undresses in a haze, noticing that the water feels hot against his cold skin but making no move to turn down the temperature, letting his body adjust instead. He feels the grime and tears and claw-marks washing off, leaving him raw and off balance.
For Steve, it took months to stop flinching when a door slammed shut, or when someone’s manicured nails tapped restlessly against a table or brushed through his hair. It took even longer for him to be able to go anywhere without Tony’s constant support and reassurance. What took the longest was unlearning behaviours he didn’t even realize he had. Always saying yes, bending over backwards to make sure no one else was unhappy, not asking for what he wants, not voicing his opinions. Learned behaviours were the hardest thing to break, but he did it.
A hand attached to a delicate, breakable wrist. A delicate, breakable wrist coloured with purple finger marks and splotches. Steve’s stomach drops, reaching his hand out to take Tony’s wrist gently. “Shit. Tony is that- Did I- Did I do that?” His voice comes out strangled.
“Really Steve, it’s fine. I don’t mind. Come sit.” Tony lets him go, but keeps his voice strict, no room for argument and suddenly Steve doesn’t have the energy to fight. He settles back into the couch, trying to ignore just how close Tony is when he sits down again.
The movie is old, and bad, and Tony plays on his phone instead of paying attention. But it reminds Steve of home, his old home in old Brooklyn and warmth he hasn’t felt in months settles his aching body and lulls him slowly into contentment.
Tony hushes softly, running his fingers through the short hairs on the back of Steve’s neck. “Just breathe, she’s gone, you’re safe, just breathe.” He repeats like a mantra, bringing his other hand up to rub along Steve’s spine.
Tony slides between them. “He’s not going anywhere with you, you lying, manipulative, cheating bitch.” He snarls, half holding his arm out as if that would really stop her. Sharon’s arm twitches and Steve flinches back, but she catches herself, she doesn’t reach out to slap Tony.
He gives a weak half-shrug, not admitting she’s right. Three press events in three days, and a gala. Every nerve ending is on fire. “I’ll be fine after some sleep.” Natasha doesn’t call him on his lie, but he can feel her eyes following the mostly faded bite-marks on his neck and collarbone.
Each touch brings Steve back to the present, calloused fingers massaging the ice out of his muscles, soaping lazily over his shoulders, down his chest, over his sides. There’s no ulterior motives, Tony doesn’t focus on any part of Steve more than another, but he doesn’t shy away either.
Steve startles, skittering away from Bucky before covering it up with a stony facade. “Alright? Buck, what’s up?” He’s genuinely confused, perching slowly on the edge of the couch with a perplexed frown.
Instead, Steve leans down, smoothing the hair back and pressing a kiss to his forehead. “Everyone is stupid compared to you, doll.” Tony rolls over, grumbling about unfair advantages, but Steve can feel him grinning against his thigh and smiles to himself, grabbing his book with one hand and threading the other through Tony’s hair.
Sharon carefully puts in her earrings, dressed far too nicely to be going in for a briefing. “Where are you going?” Steve tries not to let desperation into his tone, but he’s barely seen her in the past few weeks and when he has they’ve just been arguing.
Steve smiles bitterly, mouth tasting sour. “Well, good news then, you can’t.” His voice is brittle enough to crack and when Tony looks up again Steve knows he sees the way his hands tremble and how he swallows convulsively, barely keeping it together.
“Morning golden boy.” Tony rasps in a voice thick with sleep. Steve tries, and fails, to hide his smile as he turns his head to look.
Tony stills, blinking down at their entwined hands, he doesn’t respond, just looking between their hands and Steve’s face. “I’m sorry I hurt you so bad you get nightmares, that kills me, but you have nothing to apologize for okay?” Tony nods slowly, scooting almost imperceptibly closer. Steve lets him make his way slowly, painfully slowly, across the bed until Tony’s nearly pressed against his side.
Tony slowly pushes himself up so he’s sitting against the headboard. “I, I get nervous and shut down, and I don’t talk, really, Steve, honey I’m a mess. I overreact and run away instead of dealing. I should have stayed, I know you won’t, do, anything, I do, but I didn’t and that’s not fair to you-“
“Please let me go, let me leave, please.” He can’t even recognize his own voice, blood roaring through his ears, throat constricting, heart desperately trying to escape his heavy chest. Steve’s expression morphs and for a second Tony can’t move, unable to look away from the changing expression, terrified of what it’s going to become.
“You’re distracting me on purpose! I expected better of you Mr. America.” He turns away, feigning disappointment and crossing to the floor to ceiling windows at the back of the room.
“I know doll, that’s what I’ve got you for, right?” He almost doesn’t see her hand move before it clips the back of his head with enough force to send ringing through his ear for a second.
Tony waits until they’re in the hallway to speak. “What I said earlier came out wrong.” He doesn’t look up when he talks, staring at his shoe scuffing the floor.
Tony gently places his hand over Steve’s mouth. “We can deal with that all later. You need to shower, get warm, and get some sleep. I’ll take care of your things and get someone to fix up your old room.” Steve slumps into him again, guilty and thankful at the same time. He remembers just how mean he’s been to Tony lately, and how kind Tony has been in response.
It’s easier to recover with people who love you. People who congratulate you on every success and hold you through ever failure. People who remind you that failure is a part of progress and it doesn’t mean you can’t continue. People who hold you tight and promise to keep trying, promise to help you keep trying.
“Tony? Sweetheart what’s wrong?” The lamp turns on and Steve’s frame casts a shadow. Flashes of blood and blue and green and anger. Phantom pain in his chest, his arm, his head. He tries to look away, but catches a glimpse of the shield in the corner and panic swells.
Sam must see something in his face because he steps back with a broken sigh. “I’m kinda glad I don’t. I wish you didn’t either.”
Unjustified anger surges. “What about what I want!? huh?! I’m so goddamn sick of hearing about what I need and don’t need, what about what I want Tony? Don’t I deserve that?” With his outburst done, Steve wants to crawl back into the bathroom and hide, Tony looks shattered, brown eyes glassy, lips drawn into a tight line as he nods.
When she gets more dressed up than usual to go out at night he can’t question it, it’s always confidential, she’s a spy what does he expect? Jealousy has no place in SHIELD and Steve knows that.
Any anger rolling around Steve’s stomach burns itself away when Tony closes off entirely, shrinking in on himself. “I thought it was just her. Turns out you’re both shit at seeing through lies.”
He drops his head. “I dunno what’s wrong with me.” He admits quietly, glancing up with vulnerable, sheening eyes. Bucky lets himself settle into the couch, holding an arm out for Steve to curl under like when they were kids.
“Defrost?” Tony frowns “Honey you’re not frozen anymore, is that what this was all about?” Steve shivers as the temperature drops, looking around. Pants are drenched and heavy, hanging low on his hips and curled around his feet are half of the bedsheets, trailing from the shower into the bathroom.
Steve doesn’t want to sleep, he’s terrified of it, but with a needy genius curling up on his chest, how could he not?
He doesn’t wait for a response, and Steve isn’t going to give one. Tony slips into the shower, still in his sleep pants, and hisses when he steps under the spray. “Shit Steve, you’re gonna melt your damn skin off.” Steve just frowns, watching Tony turn down the heat. How else is he supposed to defrost?
Tony’s face falls, swallowing hard. “Alright, alright Honey, y’wanna get these off for me?” He tugs at the waistband of Steve’s pants and tsks at his expression. “Don’t worry, I’m not about to offend your star spangled sensibilities.” Steve cracks a smile, carefully peeling the off his pants, watching Tony undress and kick both pairs of pants and the soaked sheets out of the shower.
“I can do that, do you want me to send someone we know or one of my guys?” He offers quietly, Steve stays quiet for a minute, keeping his face buried in Tony’s throat, breathing deeply. When Tony squeezes his shoulder gently for a response, he pulls just far enough away to keep his words from being muffled.
“Tony, deep breaths for me okay? You’re home, you’re safe.” Raspy with sleep and warm, Steve’s voice smooths over Tony’s frantic mind. Settling his breathing and slowing his heart. A hand gently pries his off of the reactor, bringing it to a warm, solid chest.
“I just, I’m with Sharon. I don’t want you to get the wrong idea about... this.” He gesture between himself and the genius. Something unreadable flashes across Tony’s face, followed instantly by rage, and then the empty media smirk.
“Makes her uncomfortable when people touch me.” He quietly explains trying to ease her wounded expression. It doesn’t work and Sam inhales sharply on his other side.
Steve works his jaw, “I need m’stuff” He mumbles, thinking of the sketchbooks and photo albums he has on the coffee table. Tony tugs gently at Steve’s hair, humming in agreement.
“No, nonononono Steve, fuck, no don’t do this. Don’t do this to me.” He’s talking, hands fluttering uselessly around the lifeless body of his Captain. They’re trembling worse than leaves. He’s dimly aware of hands on his shoulders, fingers wiping blood,
“Tones.” Steve calls softly, holding an arm out when the genius looks at him. “C’mere.” A moment of bravery invites him into their space.
Tony chokes, nearly giving himself whiplash with how quickly he turns to face the boy. “What!?” Peter just blinks and tips his head.
“It was about you.” Tony mumbles, not pulling away from his super soldier pillow. Steve stills, then slowly unfreezes and places a book on the bed beside them. “My nightmare, I mean.”
The wall digs into his spine painfully, but he presses harder into it when Tony steps forward. “I-Fuck,
Tony claps, pointing at Steve and lunging across the small space “Exactly! It’s a sex thing, a top is the one to-“ He makes obscene gestures that have Steve’s eyebrows raising into his hairline. “- and the bottom is the one that-“
“You’re still on about that? Jesus Tony get over yourself! No one cares about what you do in bed!” Maybe too loud, if the staring and whispering us anything to go by. But Steve focuses on the slow, wry grin taking over his partner’s face.
Slowly casting his blank page aside, Steve stands. “Of course.” He keeps his voice low and gentle, not just to keep from waking Sharon, who’s asleep on the other side of the couch, but because the genius gets jumpy when he doesn’t sleep.
“Not always a bad thing Cap, if you need some time to think, or just, be, I’ve got an old movie we can watch, you don’t havfta pay attention or anything.”
Tony steels himself, stiffening and swallowing hard. “I’ve been where you are, and it’s shit. She’s not what you thought but you can’t get out because you don’t think you can live without her. It’s… It’s like a disease, Steve.”
He smiles sheepishly, scratching the back of his neck. “I know, I’m sorry, just, hiding from the storm I guess.” It’s something Tony says a lot, that he’s ‘waiting out the storm.’ It didn’t used to make sense. Now it does. Sharon doesn’t look impressed, red manicured fingernails tapping impatiently against her arm.
“You’re something else Stark.” When Tony comes back he grins, leaning up to kiss Steve’s cheeks chastely.
All power to the chest repulser. Bright light, someone yells. Maybe it was Tony himself. Metal digging into the suit, his forearm screams in pain, strained, bloodied and probably broken by now. Another yell, not him. Blood and sweat streak Steve’s face, a face usually smiling or focused, gentle lines by the eyes. A face nothing like the one contorted in anger staring Tony down.
“Hiding behind old metaphors aren’t going to help you.” She recites to him, she repeats herself a lot these days. “Come on, I’m hungry and you clearly need to go outside.”
In a lot of those cases, the other partners emotional unavailability is the downfall of an otherwise good relationship. In some cases however, emotional unavailability is symbolic of a deeper issue, and seeking out emotional connections can bring light to those issues.
But then, the genius relaxes, a seductive smirk quirking at the corner of his lips. He holds one hand out for Steve to take.
“I ain’t wrong Stevie. You’re like a skittish colt now’a’days.” Steve flinches when Bucky gestures and Bucky drops his hands back to his sides, raising his eyebrows. Steve seems to sense he’s proved Bucky’s point for him.
“Got them all?” Steve asks into his com set, affirmations echo from his teammates. Tony does a final sweep, clear. Something feels off. Dread crawling up his spine, sending goosebumps across his skin. He scans again, still clear.
“No, Steve. I’m the asshole here okay? I’ll stop. You just-“ Tony gestures to him. “Get some sleep.”
Pain. Hurt. Shock. Steve reels back, “O-Of, of course-“ he shakes his head. “Tony you’re not trapped here.” Slowly moving back, giving his wide-eyed, petrified partner a clear path to the door and when Tony scrambles to shaky legs and stumbles out of the bedroom he doesn’t follow. Chasing someone who was scared and angry was a sure-fire way to make sure they stayed both ways.
She stalks back towards the party, barely looking back. “Just… try to not be a complete embarrassment.”
“What’re you doing here!?” Steve tries to keep his disgust to himself, judging by Sharon’s raised eyebrow and Tony’s sharp inhale, he didn’t succeed. She pushes her way into the suite, ignoring Tony entirely to give Steve a condescending glare.
They sit for a long while in silence, absorbing contact from one another. At some point, the elevator dings and Tony shuffles in, sleep deprived and rumpled. “Don’t mind me.” He mumbles out, stumbling across the living room.
“Steve, honey, it’s not as bad as it looks I promise.” Tony abandons his eggs to cup Steve’s face between his hands. Steve pulls his hands down gently to examine his wrists. Both wrists bruised and swollen, nausea breaks a cold sweat across Steve’s back and he reels away.
Tony doesn’t bolt awake this time. His eyes fly open, sure, but he’s frozen. The cold lingering in his bones. The sheets aren’t even damp. He doesn’t move. He’s still alive, heart racing, even though his breathing is slow and even, perhaps too slow.
Slowly, things will get better, just because it’s hard right now doesn’t mean it will be hard forever. One day you will wake up happy, completely happy beside someone you love and who loves you and you will realize that every bloody, sweaty, tear-filled breakdown was worth it. Suddenly, things won’t seem so hard anymore.
He finds himself melting into the gentle embrace, curling up impossibly tight and drinking in warmth and affection. “Doesn’t feel like nothin’s wrong with me.” Tony squeezes tighter, surprisingly not coming at him with a joke or a comment about his relationship. Instead, he lets out a strangled, choked laugh.
“STEVE!?!” Tony stumbles out of the suit, collapsing to the ground beside the motionless soldier. Blonde hair staining crimson. The others are yelling, Tony’s hearing fuzzes to white noise, someone screams, it could have been him.
. “Stark are you clear?” Steve’s voice is loud and clear through the ear piece, distinctly worried. Tony answer with some witty reply he forgets before it’s even out of his mouth, scanning the area again.
Tony focuses on the shadowy figure kneeling in front of him. Steve’s here, he’s okay. It was a dream. He can’t hold back the hysteric laugh that sounds suspiciously like a sob and finds himself face first in a bare super soldier chest.
Tony straightens, taking Steve’s face between his hands and forcing the soldier to look him in the eyes. “None of this was your fault. She’s a manipulative, lying, cheating bitch.” Steve lets out a crazed, hysterical giggle and nods.
“We haven’t gotten to know her because we already know her. She’s a manipulative witch Steve. She’s hurting you because she can. You’re letting her treat you like shit!” Tony’s in his face, glaring with a weird mixture of compassion and strength.
Steve swallows hard, they just don’t understand. “You don’t understand! None of you get it! You haven’t even tried to get to know her and here you all are acting like you know what’s best!? This is bullshit!” He doesn’t know where the outburst came from. Everyone stalls. Tony startles, but then he’s on his feet.
Steve hits the ground before he’s fully awake, yanking away from the ice, it clings to him, tripping him as he bolts for the en suite bathroom. Too cold, limbs numb and frozen. He fumbles for the taps, there’s ice in his chest, clogging his lungs, making each breath agony.
It should be weird, he knows that. But then manicured nails stroke down his cheek, Sharon tells him that it’s fine, so he believes her.
Something vibrates on the bedside table, and again, the third time Steve realizes it’s Sharon’s phone, she must have forgotten it. An unknown number Steve can’t bring himself to answer. It falls silent and all he can hear is his heartbeat.
Steve’s attention snaps back to the dangerous arch of her eyebrows “How’d you know I was here?” He’s still trying to process the other man’s shirt she’s so brazenly wearing to come collect him. Pulse racing, Steve can feel himself spiralling into oh fuck which means what the fuck ended up processing.
“Nah,” Tony brushes him off, sitting up slowly. “I’m Iron Man, takes a lot more than a bad dream to hurt me. Take a minute, catch your breath Spangles.” His voice goes soft, slowly signalling for JARVIS to dimly illuminate the room.
The Winter Soldier is undeterred, throwing a punch with his flesh hand instead. Steve scrambles back, cursing and blocking, never attacking. “I’m like this because of you.” The Soldier’s raspy voice accuses. Steve stumbles, hitting the ground hard and rolling to avoid being crushed by a metal fist.
Without pulling back, Steve murmurs back: “you don’t even know how happy I am to see you.” And holds tighter. Bucky stills, squeezing tight before pulling back.
Steve wraps a towel around his waist after drying off, staring at his soaked clothes for a minute trying to decide for himself what to do.
“Honey, if I have to tell you what made that different, we’ve been doing this wrong.” Steve huffs lowly, shaking his head.
“Oh fuck.” Things fall into place, all those midnights sneaking in, with Sharon whispering that she’s sorry for being late again. The way they haven’t had sex in months, haven’t even shared more than a kiss in three weeks.
“Whatever you want Honey, whatever you want.” His voice drops dangerously soft, looking down at sleep rumpled blond hair. Steve lets the tension seep out of his body, his awareness of the world falling away until there’s nothing other than Tony and those gentle, calloused fingers sliding across his ribs.
Sam touches his arm, capturing his sole attention with the gentleness of the touch. “You’ve been pretty depressed man, something’s going on.”
Tony frowns slightly, glancing around at nothing. “Unless, unless you were joking, I mean, I’ll just-“ Steve reaches for the clothes in Tony’s hand, and the genius yanks them back without looking away from some hideous painting.
Water pounding tile drowns out any outside noise, and helps to quiet Steve’s mind, he focuses in on Tony, squirting some shampoo into his hand and lathering it. “Tilt your head.” He does, and his eyes fall closed as Tony massages his scalp.
With a groan, Tony gives up the fight. No one gives pep talks quite like Captain America. Swooping back in a dramatic circle, Tony lets himself flop face first onto the couch. When he realizes he missed his target, he worms the rest of the way up the couch to rest his head on Steve’s lap.
Tony crawls in first, grabbing the comforter from where it hit the ground in Steve’s haste to escape. Steve slides in beside him, pulling him close immediately. “I thought I was the clingy one here.” Tony laughs quietly, but allows himself to be manhandled into the super soldier’s lap.
“I still think they’re stupid.” Petulantly pointed out, Tony crosses his arms defiantly, daring Steve to contradict him.
“It’s not the same thing!” Steve snaps, pushing past Tony, gently, to the kitchen, putting some space between them.
“Sweetheart no, you are absolutely good enough, far too good for me.” He pulls her in close, feeling her shoulder shake and rocking himself back and forth.
Hushed voices slowly bring Steve back to consciousness, he didn’t even notice himself drifting off. “What did she do to you?” Sympathetic and gentle, gentle like the pointed nails scrapping gently across his scalp. Anticipating the pain of fingers gripping his hair or nails digging deep into his scalp, Steve bolts up.
“I’m not upse- They don’t have any proof! It’s an assumption!” Steve’s grinning in earnest now, Tony’s way of taking over a room, no matter how ridiculous he’s being, is one of Steve’s favourite parts about him. Eyes trailing down, Steve notes that those pants make his other favourite part of him look really good. “Mr. Rogers, I’m going to have to ask you to stop staring at my ass.” Tony drops his act to glare non-threateningly.
“Whatever you have to say Stark, spit it out.” Steve snaps and Tony flinches at the harshness. Guilt squeezes his heart, he’s still fucking things up with the other man.
Lightbulb. “Yeah, that guy sucks.” Tony agrees, spooning more ice cream into his mouth. “Good thing you’ve got Mr. Walking History Textbook on speed dial.” Peter’s eyes go wide, his mouth falling open into a small ‘o’ shape.
“You almost did.” Bruising that dark, that fast? The swelling? It’s a miracle the delicate bones in his genius’s wrists didn’t break. “I promised I wouldn’t hurt you.”
Tony slams the door shut, whipping around and half jogging the few steps to Steve, grabbing his elbows just in time for Steve’s knees to give out. “Shit!” Tony grunts under his weight and tries to gently maneuver them both to the ground.
Voice shaking, Steve asks, “can you send Tasha?” in a barely audible whisper, but Tony is already nodding. Pulling out his phone, he sends a text to Natasha, asking her to go get Steve’s things from his apartment and then, in a moment of either pure instinct, or pure stupidity, asks her to bring them to Tony’s suite instead of Steve’s floor.
People fall, left right and centre. Bloody snow kicks up around him. The fighting ceases. Steve slowly lowers his shield. The bodies scattered around him, both allied and enemy. In front of him, Bucky stands stock still, dressed in the Howling Commandos outfit.
“Honey?” Steve turns his head to Tony, who shifts down the couch and holds his arms out. Steve takes the invitation, laying down so his head presses against Tony’s chest and his knees lay across Tony’s legs.
“Ready to go back to bed?” Steve nods after a moment, waiting for the question to process. Tony turns off the water and steps out of the shower, drying himself quickly before turning his attention back to Steve. He drops slowly to one knee, down his legs gently.
Steve jumps to catch his partner before he hits the ground but as his hands touch Tony’s shoulders, Tony jerks away, crashing to the floor and scrambling back, face contorted in pure panic. The coffee mug smashes on the floor, ignored by everyone. It’s silent for a moment before Tony’s face goes blank.
Another warm hand on his shoulder this time, he turns to face Tony. “Cap, this isn’t okay.” He doesn’t know what this is, what’s happening, why they’re so close. Sharon isn’t going to like this. Natasha reaches for his knee, he jerks away.
Sharon came back to their shared apartment for three hours after being gone for a day and a half. She came inside looking dishevelled and exhausted, waving off Steve’s attempts at conversation.
“Don’t lose him Punk, he’s good for you.” Bucky mutters some time later, once Tony is snoring softly into Steve’s shoulder. smiling down at his genius, Steve can’t help but agree.
Steve jerks, crossing his arms and ignoring the way his stomach twists. “You don’t know what you’re talking about Tony. Don’t say that shit about her.” He finds himself towering over the genius, and to his surprise, Tony doesn’t cower away like he’s done so many times before.
“I’ve got you, you’re alright.” Tony murmurs, wrapping an arm around Steve’s shoulders and pulling him tightly against his side. Steve reaches out with shaking hands, wrapping his arms around familiar and warm and safe, burying his nose into Tony’s shoulder.
“Classified. I probably won’t be home until late, don’t be so nosy.” She admonishes, fluffing her hair and double checking her lipstick before strutting over to slide on heels.
“You just don’t understand.” Steve shakes his head, they wouldn’t get it. It’s so much harder for her than they know.
Tony slowly pulls his hand back. “Stop. That’s her talking, not you. You haven’t done anything wrong. Understand?” Steve nods, stunned into silence for probably the first time ever. Tony’s expression softens even more, “you don’t have a clue what she’s done to you, do you?” The compassion in his voice brings tears to the corners of Steve’s eyes as he shakes his head.
Peter usually swings into the lab with so much energy the entire tower seems to vibrate with it. He usually talks a mile a minute for hours on end about everything and nothing. Which is why, when Peter slinks into the lab with nothing more than a dull “Hey, Mr. Stark.” Tony immediately knows something needs to be done.
He shrugs in an awkward display of nonchalance, “uh, yeah, sure Mr. Stark.” His voice is squeaky and confused but Tony just flashes a grin and grabs a set of keys, leaving Peter to follow him dazedly out of the lab.
“I’m not going with you.” His voice is shattered, and he clears his throat. “We’re done.” Two words cut through the tension in the room and Sharon reels back.
“Hey soldier, bed’s pretty cold without you.” A soft voice from the doorway has Steve whipping around, but whatever sexual comment Tony was about to make dies on his tongue. “Honey what’s wrong?” Steve frowns at him, what’s Tony doing in the ice.
Despite that, when the bill came it was inevitably placed in front of Steve, who bit back laughter at Tony’s face and not-so-quietly muttered ‘motherfucker.’ When Tony reaches for the bill, somewhat grumpily, Steve stops him.
Like a switch, as soon as he rinses his mouth out, the world snaps back into place, dull and colourless and utterly clear. Sharon doesn’t love him, she never did. She’s been using him, hurting him, manipulating him, for her own benefit or simply because she can, Steve isn’t sure. What he does know, is that that he needs to leave. And he knows exactly where to go.
Things have changed since the 40’s, and if it sounds like an obvious statement, that’s because it is. And yet, time after time, it surprises him. Things today are either old or new, they either fit or they don’t. Steve doesn’t find a lot of grey areas. And then there’s Sharon.
“Steve, sweetheart, you’re not answering my calls.” Steve scrambles to his feet, brushing wrinkles out of his clothes and clearing his throat. She surveys him, head tilting as she takes in his haggard appearance. Then, a look of pity as she tsks. “Steve we talked about this, hiding doesn’t help you.” She sounds patronizing, but he’s just being stupid.
“I know. God Honey, I know.” Barely audible, Steve doesn’t let him know he heard. It’s too personal, too vulnerable, to open ended to be safe. This, the hugging quickly evolving into cuddling, is already too much.
She stands gracefully to kiss his cheek. “Look after yourself first, Steve, anyone else can wait.” And she walks out.
Sharon is dedicated to her job and Steve admires that. He can’t be the most important thing in her life when she’s got a promising career.
“All that serum and you still couldn’t save me?” A smirk doesn’t fit on his face, not with what he’s saying but he smirks anyways. Steve’s heart drops, nausea swirling through his stomach.
Steve barely lifts his head from between his knees. “Just, just give me a minute please,” Rasping voice barely audible, but FRIDAY always hears him. Every instinct tells him to stay put, stay on the floor, head low, wait it out. The door clicks open, Sharon ignored FRIDAY’s polite request to wait for a moment, and since Steve didn’t say no…
Bucky walks to stand in front of him. “Your girl’s a bitch Stevie. She doesn’ treat ya well.” Steve’s eyebrows shoot up and a familiar righteousness glints in his eyes.
He holds his hands out in a mockery of a placating gesture. “Hey, how about you stop bringing it up then? You came to me Rogers.” Tony’s voice is venomous as he stalks forwards to shove a finger in Steve’s chest.
He tries to articulate how he feels, how he wants to crawl out of his own skin, back into Brooklyn, back into his 5ft Nothing skinny ass where people didn’t know who he was. Sharon tells him that it’s in the past he needs to be in the now.
Steve shakes his head, but lets Tony talk. “I said, he’s not going anywhere with you.” Murderously low, Tony’s voice fills the room. “Get out of my apartment.” Short and commanding, there’s no room for argument and Steve feels the knot in his chest unravel slightly.
Trembling legs nearly send him to the ground three times as they cross the living room, giving out just as he goes to sit on the couch. Hot chocolate splashes up his arms and into his lap, but he can’t bring himself to care. “She’s been cheating.”
Steve sends back a heart and Tony rolls his eyes. He reassures Peter that, yes Steve would love to help him out and no, he wouldn’t be a burden, and after that, Peter seems to perk up again. The ice cream disappears far too fast, and Peter starts picking at Tony’s when he thinks the genius isn’t looking.
He’s on the ground now, Steve braced over him. It’s almost comical, considering they were in almost the same position last week, under drastically different circumstances. Looking up at him now, there’s no trace of the gentle touches, deep kisses and kind praises found there before.
Wind roars, nearly drowning out Steve’s heartbeat. The plane beeps warning signals, flashing red lights taking over dash, Steve doesn’t know what any of them mean. He flips switches at random, trying desperately to disarm the bombs. He’s talking, but he doesn’t know what he’s saying.
Sam steps up, pulling Tony back a step. “Easy man, take a breath.” He leans to murmur something in the genius’s ear and Tony turns on his heel, disappearing from the room. “He’s right. It’s not your fault, but she’s getting away with some pretty bad shit Cap.”
Steve stills, the air sucked from his lungs. “Jesus Tony.” A breathless gasp and he’s crushing Tony tight to his chest. “It wasn’t real sweetheart, I’m here. I’m not going anywhere.” Grasping at skin, Tony clings tight, fighting against hot, stinging tears.
”, Steve struggles away from The Soldier, desperate to keep the one person he can’t live without, alive. The Soldier grabs his shoulder, keeping him from getting to Tony. Throwing back an elbow that connects with nothing, Steve pushes through thick snow.
“I’m not like that. I don’t cheat.” Tony relaxes and observes his Captain. Steve is tense, fidgeting and visibly anxious.
It pours rain the whole jog to the tower, just like in a cliche rom-com, and Steve is drenched by the time the elevator reaches the top floor. Tony is waiting in front of the doors tp has suite, probably informed by FRIDAY, with a towel and a mug of hot chocolate.
“You never loved me.” Steve chokes out the words before Tony can shove her through the doorway. Sharon stops in her tracks, schooling her expression into a cruel smile.
Quietly, although afraid of startling him, she speaks. “Of course, what are friends for?” She hovers for a moment, her eyes flicking from Tony, to Steve and back to Tony. They lock eyes for a moment, Tony tilts his head towards Steve and Natasha gives a minuscule nod before pulling her hand back. “I’ll be back tomorrow” she promises, standing and moving towards the door with smooth, lithe strides.
