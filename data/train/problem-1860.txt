He got along with most of his neighbours, who had raised their eyebrows at him in the beginning and then quickly accepted him into their little village community once it became clear that he was "dear Hélène's grandson". He had his own stall at the farmer's market on Saturdays and sold his own honey, guaranteed local and sustainable. There were solar cells on the roof of his cottage and he spent sunny days in his garden, tending to his bees and growing herbs, or roaming the countryside with his dog by his side. When it rained, he stayed in and wrote down the results of his detailed studies on apiculture.
"Nonsense," Mrs Hudson says. "The two of you can behave yourselves. You're living in the same house, for goodness' sake."
Sherlock thought about that for a second but couldn't find anything obviously wrong with that statement. "And?"
Sherlock woke the moment John’s leg slid out from underneath his. He kept his eyes closed, relishing the rare sensation of peace he experienced just from listening to John moving about the flat after a night spent sleeping next to him.
"Mmh-hm," Sherlock hummed in confirmation. "A token. Something you will give to me before leaving that I can return when you come back."
John lunged and hit her in the back, just enough to make her stumble and fall. He managed to avoid crashing into her and performed a 1-80 almost on the spot, giving her a dangerous growl that made her think twice about getting up from where she lay on the ground, panting.
Sherlock shuddered. He had completely ignored the press so far, which was probably a bit of an oversight because ‘Bride killed at own wedding’ was probably just the thing to fill the summer hole. He could only imagine the media circus once it became clear that the blushing bride had in fact been an internationally wanted assassin.
"It wasn't tainted, though, and I made sure he was exposed in a controlled environment. The same environment that later turned out not to be controlled at all, as is your responsibility to ensure. And I'm not the one who decided to engage in interspecies experimentation."
Two days later, Sally leaves work to find a black car waiting at the curb. She rolls her eyes and gets in. To her surprise, Mycroft Holmes is sitting in the back. On the front seat next to the driver, a woman who appears to be his PA is busy typing away on her phone, apparently completely oblivious to her surroundings. Sally wonders how lethal she is.
It wasn't much of a hardship. Even before they had become official (or even acknowledged to themselves that it was a possibility) they had already been mistaken for a couple so many times while behaving the way they always did that no further changes were really required.
"Oh, for god's sake!" He stepped closer and bent down, battling Sherlock's hands away and undoing the button for him, trying very hard not to touch his chest. That didn't stop him from feeling the heat radiating off of Sherlock's body, though. Bloody hell, the man was like a furnace!
"I'd do it all over again anyway," Sherlock repeated. "I'd let them kill me if it meant you getting the life you want."
He seemed to shrink before Sherlock's eyes, head ducked and shoulders drawn in, making himself smaller. It was unbearable to watch.
Sherlock smirked. "You mean the one where we pretend we're not shagging at every given opportunity?"
"Come with us," Emily said and her voice left no room for argument. "It seems we have a lot to talk about, Sherlock Holmes."
a snide voice in John's head suggested and he resolutely turned his back on the closet, marched into the bathroom and did exactly what he had expected Sherlock to be doing - he washed the taste of him out of his mouth.
The air in the bathroom was freezing, as if he had needed another incentive to hurry up, and he returned as quickly as humanly possible.
"Better," Sherlock replied. "I fixed my shields and added some more layers. The dissonance has stopped for now."
"Why is the list not kept on the PsyNet?" John asked as they stepped into a small room held all in white and metal with nothing in it but one computer station.
"I don't know," Sherlock said. "Such a thing has never happened before, according to the scientists there. It is unlikely that the effects will reverse on their own, so we shall have to wait for them to develop an antiserum. Isn't it great?!"
“True,” John agreed. He hesitated. “You don’t think it was someone who had it in for James, do you?”
There, that should satisfy them. The only one with plans to walk away was John but there was no need to mention that.
John groaned and rolled off him, fishing around on the floor for a moment or two before slapping Sherlock’s phone onto his chest. “Answer it before I end up chucking it out of the window.”
He did another sweep of his shields, this time from further outside, to be absolutely sure they were secure, then returned into their safety and added another layer. Part of him wondered if he was becoming paranoid but it could hardly be called paranoia when he knew for a fact that someone would be out to get him if they realised how fragile his Silence had become.
"Yes of course." Sherlock said calmly. "I've been told this is where wedding rings traditionally go. Where else would I put it?"
Sherlock had retreated to the bathroom to get changed and John took a minute to breathe before changing as well and knocking on the bathroom door. “Can I come in?”
Sherlock recalled the way John would sometimes reach out for him when he got frustrated by a case, when the tension rose and he hunched his shoulders without quite noticing. He recalled how, before their recent agreement, John had always snatched his hand away.
"Fine," he finally said and Sherlock wanted to collapse in relief. "Fine. But only because this is the way that makes the most sense."
"Mmh, you do smell like apples," Sherlock muttered and John watched one corner of his mouth turn up in what was probably supposed to be a smirk but fell short and turned into a soft smile instead.
That was not what John had expected, though Sherlock had already suggested something along those lines. "Pardon?"
He never got the chance to take the thought any further because Sherlock whirled around and used the store employee's distraction to march right to the till, dumping his intended purchases in front of a bemused cashier.
"She's been antagonising herself," Sherlock snapped back. "All I was doing was try to have dinner in peace. I did not invite her here. I certainly didn't ask for her opinion."
They continued their walk, ambling down to the Grassmarket and past its colourful pubs, spilling over with tourists enjoying the sunshine. Sherlock, always the opportunist, dragged John across the market and up the street to a row of secondhand bookshops.
Sherlock smiled back. "Mmh, I did wonder when you did that but then I thought you might only be getting more dog-ish in your behaviour because being a dog was taking over. It had me quite worried you might lose yourself if we didn't turn you back in time."
"I dare say," John muttered and handed him a cup of tea. Sherlock took a careful sip and nodded to himself. Hot water with just a hint of a taste to it. John had barely dipped the tea bag in the cup for him. It had taken him less than a week to learn how Sherlock drank his tea.
John wasn't sure whether the sound he made was a laugh or a sob and he bent back down to muffle it against Sherlock's lips. "I wish I had known sooner."
Sherlock shrugged, supremely unconcerned by the man's demeanour. It was hardly the first time someone had accused him of being unfeeling. In his opinion, Frankland deserved what he got. A good scientist knew when an experiment was fruitless and would never have to resort to such methods as randomly drugging people in a forest just to cover up a murder. In fact, a good scientist would manage to conduct his experiments without having to murder anyone at all.
Now that they were back in the flat where no wind existed to blow away the scent before it reached John's nose, he quickly discovered that the pheromones had not ebbed from Sherlock's system yet.
He was right, of course he was, but Sherlock felt close to vibrating right out of his brother's grip and rushing into that room.
Some minutes later, Sherlock said rather breathlessly: "I have decided I don't care who sees us. Let's go inside and upstairs before we lose the ability to walk."
The doubt in John’s voice was painful to hear. “No. You were raised during the Thatcher years, John. You had that hatred and that shame instilled in you by everyone from your parents to the media. You witnessed your parents turn your sister away for being a lesbian. How could you be anything but terrified to find yourself attracted to another man?”
It wasn't very encouraging, but Sherlock knew it was the best he was going to get. It had taken him half an hour to talk Lestrade into taking him here at all and the DI had only agreed after Sherlock had threatened to make the trip himself.
There was nothing John could say to that. It was true, after all, though he didn't quite know how to explain to Lestrade that it was different. That being a dog had made a lot of things different.
Their conversation afterwards and John handing his ring back to him had seemed like yet another sign that things were improving. He knew, or at least suspected, John wasn't happy about the ring's existence on Sherlock's finger. But when he had had the chance to make it disappear, he had given it back to him instead. Surely that had to mean something, right?
"Because to us he always smells of bleach," John explained before Lestrade could snarl back. "He must have been working there for years, the scent is integrated in his skin now. If it seems fresh to you, it confirms that he was on his way home. To us, he just smells like someone who spends a lot of time surrounded by bleach."
His voice broke on that last word and he hated himself for it. Had there ever been a greater agony than that day?
“...is getting the flat ready as we speak,” John finished his sentence for him. “We might not be able to bring the dog home right away, it really depends on what the shelter thinks is best, but we can go in and pick one right now.”
“Of course you didn’t,” John said, holding him even closer and letting his hand trail over Sherlock’s back again. “You truly are the best and bravest man I ever met, aren’t you? Of course you never even considered letting anyone else come to harm, you brilliant madman.”
"I think I'd rather be alone right now," Sherlock found himself saying. "Just ... leave me be for a while."
There were some more measures and a teeth examination, which John found annoying and rather pointless. Why would they want to look at his teeth when he was unlikely to have them for much longer?
Sherlock stared at him and gave a rapid double-blink as he absorbed this new information. Then he shook his head. "All I am taking away from this is that you are willing to and capable of killing in order to protect others. Hardly something to be ashamed of."
She turned to Sherlock. “When you went and died on us, on the other hand, we had people from a bio-hazard removal agency or some such here to clean out the kitchen.”
"I wasn't eating them," Sherlock immediately defended himself, which would have been more convincing if the cookies in his mouth hadn't made it sound like "I wafn' eat'n 'em".
"Sorry," he muttered, turning his attention back to the relative safety of Sherlock's trousers around his ankles. "It happens all the time," he said gently, patting his friend's leg again. "Now, can you raise your foot so we can get this done?"
His sister Harry, on the other hand, hugged John long and hard before subjecting Sherlock to the same treatment. "Thank you," she murmured in his ear, "for making my brother so happy. I have never seen him so content."
The lift reached the floor he wanted and Sherlock got off with a vague mutter that may have been "Cheers" or "G'day" if you applied some imagination.
Sherlock made an outrageously swooping gesture with his arm, still clutching the empty glass, and John had to duck to not get hit in the face. "Jeez, maybe I'd best take you home and you can tell me all about that brilliant idea of yours tomorrow. I might even let you have an Advil or two if you're nice."
The result was that John found himself on the floor, disgruntled, plotting revenge, and salivating as he tried to extract his dinner from the kong. And all the while, his tail was wagging without consulting him!
"Please," Sherlock interrupted him. "You're getting married in less than a month, John. I've spent the past two months organising most of it. I know very well what is and is not realistic for me to expect here."
Sherlock, on the other hand, was getting more and more restless as time progressed and the shadows lengthened. His headache seemed to have disappeared thanks to the Advil John had given him earlier, but all it meant was that the detective spent all day staring at slides under his microscope and getting increasingly anxious as the day went by.
John barely got a chance to reply to her questions so he just let her continue talking and hugged her back, content to just enjoy being able to wrap his arms around another human being and hold them close. He hadn't realised how much he had missed this. Ever since he and Sherlock had gotten over the issue of petting, there had been enough touch to keep him fully content. Now that he was human again, he couldn't help but wonder what Sherlock made of all this.
They returned to their conversation and he barely noticed as Sherlock stood and drifted away towards his bedroom with a muttered goodnight to Mrs Hudson.
"Good," John said. "That's ... that's good." He nodded, as if trying to convince himself as well as Sherlock of his own words.
So perhaps he could understand why John did not want him around right now when he was already forced to endure the indignity of using a public park as his bathroom.
"True," Sherlock agreed. "Which makes this very interesting. You're looking for a Gradient 8 Psy at least, definitely a telepath. Here we are back to this not making sense. No Gradient 8 Tp-Psy would ever be caught riding the Underground. Eight means power and power means they are more likely to turn volatile or suffer serious brain damage due to their conditioning if their Silence fails. They would not risk the Tube, not if they liked their brain inside their head."
He picked up the files from Lestrade's desk. "I don't have your book at hand at the moment, otherwise I would have checked for myself. I have a bunch of accounting ledgers here that might contain some inconsistencies. Now I distantly recall you having invented an equation for something similar."
Sherlock snorted. "That's one way of putting it, but I do agree that Sergeant Donovan has a good instinct for what is the truth and what is a lie, particularly when it comes to people faking emotions they don't have."
And here they are, on a sunny Sunday morning with the hope for an endless supply of John shyly edging its way between them.
Within minutes they were in a cab on the way to the address Lestrade had texted and Sherlock was giving him a run-down of what he knew so far. The DI had been sparing with the details but that had never stopped Sherlock from knowing more than he should.
Sherlock couldn’t quite bring himself to glare. It was difficult to be in a bad mood right about now, with John all but sprawled on top of him, lips pressed to his chest. Even Mycroft couldn’t possibly ruin that.
"Oh yes, don't you worry. I've got an entire folder on that." Sherlock waved a dismissive hand. "It's tomorrow night. Mary already knows."
Sherlock pushed the plate of muffins in his direction. "Now, Mrs Hendriksen, you were going to tell me about Frederik."
Now, though, Sherlock smelled ... different. Unhappy still, yes, but angry, too. John wondered what had caused the change, what thought process had made Sherlock arrive at anger.
They got up and put their empty cups in the sink to be washed later before returning to Lestrade's office.
Once he was satisfied that the towels were arranged to his liking, Sherlock stretched out on the larger one, turning his head to the side so he could look at John. “Ready when you are.”
And then earlier this morning they had just been so comfortable and it had been much too early to get up after the late night they had had, so why not stay where they were?
For example, there was the first time Sherlock walked through the door that very day and Rosie shrieked "Pa!" and threw herself at him before he had a chance to even put down his bag. He dropped to his knees and held her in his arms for longer than he thought should be allowed but he couldn't make himself let go and she was clinging to him just as tightly, saying "You're back!" with so much delight that Sherlock actually started to cry because he really was.
John looked almost painfully relieved, managing another half-smile. “Guess we’re going to work sitting in our armchairs tomorrow,” he said. “Instead of sitting on the floor. We’re getting too old for this.”
He had drawn the curtains closed and the room was only lit by whatever sunlight made it through the gaps around them. Next door, the shower had been on for what seemed like an excessively long time. He wondered distantly if Sherlock, too, needed a moment to sort out his head.
John shook his head and sat down, watching as Sherlock opened the closet and started pulling out clothes. A pair of jeans, a t-shirt and jumper, one pair of pyjamas in case they had to stay overnight, a pair of socks and pants. John supposed he should have been embarrassed at the thought of Sherlock rooting around his underwear, but the fact was that he had done so ages ago and had probably already deduced what type of underwear John was wearing based on the way he walked or something.
"Your manners take some work, mister, but I can respect a man who makes his pet a priority." She held out her hand.
The plea was there in his eyes, too. John wondered what it was that Sherlock was so desperate for him to do. Vanish into thin air? Walk away? Pretend he had never come here? Pretend he hadn't seen and heard Sherlock so shattered?
John wanted to tell him he had been a very good owner but lacked the words, so he licked Sherlock's hands and pressed his nose to Sherlock's throat instead, breathing in a full dose of his scent one last time. The knowledge that he wouldn't be able to smell this scent and hear this heart from across the flat anymore hit him like a punch in the gut.
Sherlock's gaze snapped back to his, so he continued talking. "I wanted you the moment I saw you. But you weren't interested, you said it yourself, so I told myself I couldn't have you and that was that."
Sherlock's warm skin underneath John's fingertips, his curly hair, his soft lips, the rough scar tissue on his back that neither of them chose to comment on. The sounds he made, half-aborted sighs and gasps and moans of pleasure as John bent himself to the task of learning everything he could about this body that he did not already know. The look in his eyes when John whispered words of love and adoration in his ear. The slick sounds of their bodies moving together, the way their muscles flexed and limbs moved. The way Sherlock threw his head back when he came, fingers clenching around John's shoulder and side, his breath punching out of him.
"I'm sure I would remember that," Sherlock said, stepping closer. "Come on, John, move aside, I can't see with you blocking the way."
Sherlock stared out the window onto the dark street, unblinking and unseeing, and wondered if there was any option that wouldn't destroy them both. If there was, he couldn't see it.
"No, I mean ... this. I won't get used to this. Having you here with me. I'll never take it for granted, John."
When she entered the kitchen, the flat was silent. She found John's coat and shoes where they always used to be and smiled to herself as she set her tray down. And because she was Mrs Hudson and didn't have any shame whatsoever, she snuck down the hallway to peek through the gap in the door into Sherlock's room, just to make sure her boys were all right.
He allowed himself to just shake through it, tried to remove his conscious mind from what was happening and focused only on his breathing, on trying to get enough oxygen into his lungs.
A low groan was the only reply and it sent a shiver of rage through John's body. Sherlock sounded wrecked and John could barely feel him through the bond. He knew Sherlock must have lost consciousness at some point because the bond between them had dimmed to little more than a flicker. That had been around the time when John had jumped across the car.
"She'll have to get access to his bank accounts, but that shouldn't be too hard, seeing as he is one of our murder victims
John quite enjoyed being the centre of attention for once. It wasn't normally the role he found himself in, not when Sherlock was standing next to him and being brilliant, and that was fine. He didn't want the kind of attention Sherlock got. But he wasn't above letting people admire him.
“At least you can put on your pyjamas this way,” John found himself saying, eyeing Sherlock in his customary slacks and shirt. He must have gotten changed while John had been in the shower. Trust Sherlock not to make himself comfortable.
"Well, they haven't even sent out the wedding invitations yet," Sally says. "So we've still got time and no deadline in sight."
"That was surprisingly fast," Sherlock observed. "They finally fixed their second scooter. I suppose Mrs Patel finally made her husband cough up the money."
"No, they left some time ago, presumably to pack and escape through a window," Sherlock said. "They disappeared right after I mentioned the pending arrival of the police."
The week they had spent up in the Highlands, Sherlock swinging back and forth between bouts of euphoria and nostalgia and about one step away from a breakdown as he asked for just one week where they went back to the way it used to be.
When he got to John asking if he could finally come home, Sherlock found a chair. Well, he sagged backwards and a chair just so happened to be in the vicinity, so he sat on that. His legs would not carry him a moment longer.
John watched him go with equal parts annoyance and disappointment. He didn't want to stay here and have to wait and he despised being called "Johnny" - which Sherlock was aware of, the bastard. Also, on some weird fundamental level he did not quite understand, it felt absolutely wrong to watch Sherlock walk away and not follow him.
John shrugged. "I was in Afghanistan. We sometimes didn't hear news for weeks at a time. The only ones who might have been able to share information were the few Psy in my unit and they would not have thought to tell us about it as it would hardly be considered relevant for the war."
Of course he had. John sighed. "And the fridge didn't strike you as an odd place for me to store tape in?"
John was leaving him and he wouldn't even get to say goodbye. You didn't tell your best friend goodbye when he was getting married. You stood by his side and celebrated. But he needed that goodbye. Needed a moment where he could draw the line and tell himself that this was it. No more.
His wife was dead, his best friend had left without so much as a goodbye and now Rosie was gone, too.
But did Sherlock want to be kissed? John wasn’t sure. Perhaps that made him an idiot but there were too many things he couldn’t be sure of.
"I want to surprise John with breakfast in bed. He hasn't had a proper holiday in years and I'm afraid that I cause him undue stress more often than not, so I thought ..." He trailed off, not sure how to express what it was that he had been thinking.
"He lets you touch him." Mrs Hudson laid it down like a well-known fact. "Because you need the contact. Perhaps because he does, too, somewhere deep down."
He nodded, turned on his heel and ran out the door. He barely made it into the next dark corner, hunkering down and letting the pleasure-pain of the shift wash over him.
"Time to go," he said and watched as Sherlock automatically turned, took one look at him and managed a very credible impression of a statue. A moment later his gaze slid away and settled somewhere just past John's left ear. John wondered if Mycroft had put him in camos out of spite.
John breathed a sigh of relief when they finally left the morgue and returned to the lab. Medical training he might have, but autopsies had never been his thing and spending hours in a cold room watching someone take apart a dead body was not his idea of a good time. Even the sting of chemicals in the lab was better than the smell of decay that clung to the walls of the morgue. Cold it may be, but John's nose was very sensitive indeed and he could smell a body breaking down long before it became physically apparent to anyone else.
He had been lucky - his mother was a strong Tk herself and had managed to contain his involuntary outbursts before anyone could have gotten hurt. She had started teaching him self-control before she had begun teaching him how to speak. Intellectually, he knew she had done it out of sheer self-preservation, to protect both herself and her genetic heritage (himself and Mycroft) from his ability, but Sherlock remembered thinking when he had been very young and not yet fully conditioned that perhaps she might have done it because she did not want her child to carry the guilt of being a killer.
Sherlock nodded, looking thoughtful. “Yes. I suppose that does make a great deal of sense, in fact. I’m glad you’ve made that much progress at least, John.”
Mycroft's mouth twists in an oddly familiar expression - Sherlock does the same thing when he isn't pleased with the quality of a crime scene photograph.
He was therefore not remotely prepared to find them in the sitting room, their chairs pushed closer together than usually, each of the flat's inhabitants in his respective chair, engaged in an obviously very serious game of tug of war with a ratty old towel.
"Well spotted," John said, glad to see that Sherlock hadn't bothered with buttoning his coat. He unwound the scarf from his neck, threw it over the chair by the closet and raised his arms to Sherlock's lapels so he could help him out of his coat.
Lestrade shook his head. "The different London Wings have specific free passage agreements, particularly with the Yard. As a member of DarkStorm she can go wherever she pleases at all times and will not be challenged."
That night, Sherlock did not sleep. He went to bed because John all but ordered him to, but did not close his eyes. Next to him, John had fallen asleep within twenty minutes, a muttered 'Good night' the last thing he said.
"This is your fault," Sherlock complained. "I never used to be hungry so often until you started bullying me into eating all the bloody time."
There was no harm in it, after all, and Sherlock's touch was gentle and careful. He even went so far as to give him verbal warnings such as "I'm going to turn your ear inside-out, make a sound if this hurts" and "I want to touch your canines, don't bite my finger off".
Sherlock has no idea when or how they ended up sharing the role of fatherhood to a little girl he is in no way related to, but bathtime belongs to him now. He can hear John rummaging around in the kitchen, doing the washing up after dinner. The dishes need cleaning and so does Rosie. Since John can't do both at the same time, Sherlock finds himself in the role of designated bath-giver. The poetic irony of him putting John's daughter in water doesn't escape him, but the tub is shallow and these waters are clear and easy to navigate. There is no risk of drowning.
Sherlock was staying here, then, if he was already considering how to get rid of the memory of this.
"At the hospital, when you gave us all a good scare the other week. She said your husband had hardly left your side, stayed up all night by the bed to keep you company. She said he was worried sick."
"Oh, be honest, John. You and I both know that a Corgi would have a better legs-to-body ratio to your human form than a Toller."
There are loud, heavy steps pounding the pavement behind them and Sherlock pulls John into the darkness between two overflowing skips, using convenient pieces of cardboard as a shield from prying eyes.
"Oh please." Sherlock nodded down at the red cross patch stitched to the side of John's bag. "And when I suggested our suspect might have a stroke, you turned and checked him over. Not like a curious bystander but like an expert. You might as well carry a sign saying Army Doctor."
"Well, let's make the most of it and go join our fellow holidaymakers, then," John suggested. "We wouldn't want anyone to get suspicious and leave early."
And, well ... while John was there, why not make use of it? Why not give in and have at least one conversation that wouldn't end with John rejecting him?
But first, she held her hand over the body, closed her eyes and focused. "Brain haemorrhage, as suspected," she concluded. "Time of death was precisely one hour and 27 minutes ago. They got him here very quickly."
John knew he should let Sherlock sleep, provide him with a bucket and a glass of water and maybe some painkillers for his hangover in the morning and just leave him here to sleep it off. But he couldn't.
"Nonsense," Mrs Hudson tells her and guides her out of her chair. Sally doesn't put up a fight. "You have as much a right to be here as anyone. And Molly will arrive soon, too."
Being 9.9 on the Gradient, Sherlock had learned that emotion meant pain long before he had had the words for either. His Silence was perfect and impenetrable.
He tried to remember if there had been a moment when he had heard them earlier on their walk but wasn't certain.
Sherlock could see it clearly. There was a new tightness around his eyes and the pesky tremor in his hand was back. Sherlock decided he hated the very sight of it.
He had gotten to investigate eight crime scenes, made three people burst into tears and John had already stepped in twice to prevent anyone from punching Sherlock in the face. The case could hardly get any better.
John huffed. Of course he bloody knew! It itched horribly. He stopped, waiting for Sherlock to walk several paces ahead before shaking himself again, this time more violently. Some of the mud and drops of water flew off, but he wasn't optimistic enough to believe he had gotten rid of all of it.
John stared at him and saw nothing but raw honesty in his face. He nodded once. "Good night, Sherlock."
"We all have to start at some point," John said. "My average life in the suburbs - thank you for that one, by the way - will start with my wedding, though I suppose in some ways I'm already living it."
"Well, come along then," he said, leading them towards the crime scene tape. "I'm afraid John will have to wait at the edge. Can't have dog hair contaminating the crime scene," he muttered, low enough for only Sherlock and John to hear him.
Sherlock rolled his eyes at him. "I suspected you might not come home that night and decided I didn't want to know."
Sherlock smiled to himself. “Countless hours of playing the violin,” he said. “Makes for strong hands, though you wouldn’t think it. The rest is just observation and passable knowledge of the human body.”
She searches for the precise location of the public pool and all surrounding businesses and institutions.
They sat next to each other at a small angle, looking in the same direction but turned towards one another all the same. One of them had been sipping his coffee while the other was engrossed in his phone. They had sat there for at least half an hour, not talking, just comfortable in each other's quiet company, and Sherlock had felt oddly reminded of himself and John for no discernable reason.
Sherlock rolled his eyes at him but stalked away to where John was sitting in the grass by Donovan's side.
Sherlock made another tiny noise, his right hand clenching around John's waist, his left clutching at John's hand as his mouth fell open and his muscles loosened.
"Where are we going?" John asked as Sherlock made a beeline for the stairs leading down to the Piccadilly Circus station. The crowd parted around him like the sea in front of Mose, mostly because it was that or be bowled over. John had to stay close behind him to make use of the gap that tried to close as soon as Sherlock had passed.
"Good point," Sherlock agreed. "But imagine how interesting it would be! So much to deduce, so many threads to untangle! And in such a limited amount of time! Fantastic!"
By the time Sherlock returned home, Lestrade had already left. John was sitting in his armchair, staring at nothing. If he registered Sherlock’s arrival, he gave no sign of it.
Without noticing, he had followed Sherlock all the way past the crime scene and out of the park. A moment later, Sherlock bent down and refastened the lead on his collar.
"Don't be," John murmured. "It wasn't your fault. Not really. You did what you had to do and though it was a complete nightmare at the time, I think we are both better for it."
. Three years and the memory of it still destroyed him. "She told me you said you wanted anyone but me."
There was a snort behind them. "What, those guys? Couldn't find their own arse with both hands and a map. If you're hoping to find out what happened to the concierge by relying on them, you're in for a long wait."
John licked his lips. "I know you love Rosie and I know she loves you, too. If we want this to work out, it needs to be acknowledged. I ... I want you to adopt her."
This time, it was the detective's turn to take control of the kiss, his clever tongue invading John's mouth at the smallest provocation and doing incredibly clever things that had John thrusting down, his own erection rubbing against Sherlock's through the barriers of their trousers and pants. They moaned in unison at the sensation, gasping and shuddering as he deliberately repeated the movement.
He can't for the life of him figure out what might have caused it this time. That's what John is there for, after all. And so, as he always does, as he has learned to do, Sherlock turns to him for help.
Eyebrows raised, Molly leaned back in her chair and crossed her arms. “Do you know that’s the first time you ever admitted it out loud?”
. It utterly upset the parameters of my experiment and I can't imagine you want your scientists to go about their work while under the influence of dangerous hallucinogens."
And it would - as soon as they got back home, away from this place where there were no reminders of why he couldn't and shouldn't and mustn't.
The DI stared at him for a little while longer and finally nodded. “Fair enough. I wouldn’t put murder past you-”
He paused three feet away and slowly crouched down. "I just want to check him for injuries, see if we can wake him. How long has he been out?"
Fuelled by frustration and a certain lack of progress - surely the Yarders had realised by now that there seemed to be no evolution to the killer's methods -, he might try to take his 'game' to the next level. The most logical way to do this would be to contact Sherlock again, his chosen other player.
"When?" John asked, throwing his head back and groaning loudly as Sherlock twisted his hand on the upwards stroke. "Tell me when."
Sherlock was in the middle of a long-winded and forensically detailed description of the precise location of the bullet wound in Mary’s forehead when he got distracted by a commotion outside.
That made Sherlock snap to attention. "What? Oh, no, I think I'm done for now. Why are you taking off your shoes?"
to start in the first place," Sherlock snaps back. "I'm not some ... some substitute you just get to have whenever the mood strikes you, John. If you truly are sorry, you need to stop doing it. And if you aren't sorry, stop saying so because the last thing I want to hear from you is that you're
They were an elderly couple, clearly retired and rather well-off. No, they had been, he deduced, eyes flicking to the woman's jewelry. A bad investment, perhaps? They certainly had less money now than they used to but were still trying to give the impression of being far from broke. He judged them both to be in their mid-to-late sixties and of Eastern European origin, perhaps Poland or Bulgaria. They were also, he noted, very much in love.
John wanted to ask but didn't know how. Or if he was allowed. He wondered what it looked like, the Psy Net. Was it visible at all? Was it a concept? A feeling? No, Psy didn't feel things. They wouldn't base the most important thing they had on feelings.
He stared down at the man asleep in his bed, in his arms, and tried to wrap his mind around the reality of all this. This strong, deceptively compact body was right here, warm and alive and
Sherlock allowed himself to be dragged to Regent's Park and didn't even try to protest when John very insistently demanded to be released by biting the lead.
He tries to be circumspect, tries to approach the topic sideways by asking John other questions first.
Sherlock desperately wanted to reach out and touch him but refrained. "There you have it then. If I were truly Silent, this would be impossible. And yet here we are. And they can all smell it."
Gloves were not required clothing, of course - even the Council saw reason in concerns about impracticality and Psy were generally advised to try and keep from touching others either accidentally or on purpose. Only some of the designations habitually wore gloves - usually those gifted in Psychometry, who absorbed information about objects or people by touching them.
"Sometimes, a bit of distance can be helpful," Sherlock said, shrugging. "Puts things into perspective."
Luckily, he didn't have to, for a moment later air hissed as the pressure lock was released and then the door opened and Mycroft's grip on his arm turned to steel.
All the changelings, Lestrade included, were staring up into a particularly high tree. Donovan, in her raven form, was circling the tree but was too tall to reach the thin branches on which a young ocelot cub dangled.
"You do realise you are covered in mud, do you?" Sherlock asked idly as they passed through the gates, nodding solemnly at the gatekeeper who was in the process of pulling the keys out of his pocket to lock the park for the night.
In lieu of replying, Sherlock opened the file Lestrade had handed him and flicked through it, taking in the information with a satisfied nod before pulling the file he had discovered in Forsythe's office out of his coat.
John wished he could get a look at his face but Sherlock clearly didn't want the other man to know they weren't alone, so he had to contend himself with staying where he was and listening intently.
John followed along, pausing momentarily to admire a red-headed woman who was standing by the reception desk, talking into her phone in rapid French. The language sounded so melodic, he would have liked to listen for a bit longer. Unfortunately, Sherlock tugged at his lead and John refocused on keeping pace and paying attention to the conversation at hand.
"I don't think he even told his son," Sherlock said. "Knowing his father accepted the child might have reduced his stress enough to stop him from making yet another mistake."
The hot house did its name justice. A massive building made of glass and beautifully wrought iron and steel, it was filled to the brim with plants of all kinds, creating a lush jungle so far from the equator. The air was stifling and extremely humid, as could be expected, and the smell of thousands of plants and flowers hung in the air, thick and sweet.
Did John have any idea how much Sherlock had mellowed thanks to him? How much he had changed as a person simply because John existed?
“You couldn’t make me run up those stairs if you set my arse on fire,” he declared, making Sherlock bark a laugh.
Suddenly, the temptation to cheat and look up Sherlock's now ex-husband was almost too much. He wanted to find that bastard and have a word or two. But first he had to look after Sherlock.
And then there was that other sensation ... the mere hint of an idea of the kind of agony he would have felt when faced with the evidence of John and Mary’s mutual love, walking and talking and entrusted to him for safety.
If the reason for their work hadn’t been such a sad one, Sherlock thought he might have enjoyed it immensely.
John sat up, bracing both hands on the mattress to either side of his thighs and trying not to puke.
Sherlock frowned at him. "And the fact that I was out did not make you consider leaving and coming back at a later time?"
"You're curious," Sherlock concluded. "That is your curious face. The head tilt is very expressive indeed. But I do not quite get what you wish to know."
Not that John paid them any attention, except maybe to watch the way the red and blue light was reflected by the water, drawing his gaze without his permission even as he berated his mad flatmate for yet another stupid stunt.
"Well, it was quite obvious, wasn't it? You must have known," Lestrade said. "God, the way he used to look at you. I'm no Sherlock Holmes but I can just about deduce when someone is arse over tits in love, John. So to hear that he had gone and gotten himself married to fuck knows whom was a bit of a surprise. To find out he actually loves the guy even more-so. He's never looked twice at anyone who wasn't you. What did you think why we all thought you two were together? Hell, even Anderson noticed. He really was
He was well aware that he had started to chafe against her, had started to do so within weeks of the wedding. Now, almost a year later, there was nothing left of the woman he had thought he had married. None of her kindness - he must have imagined that - and none of her casual jabs, the little needling comments that weren't quite insults but still burrowed under his skin. Not all of them had been aimed at him and the ones about Sherlock had somehow been worse. Worst of all had been the ones made to Sherlock, who had laughed them off, something stiff in the way he held his body and a flicker of something in his eyes that John had never been able to pin down but that had suggested Sherlock, too, felt the sting.
Sherlock held up a hand. "I don't. I can't. It only works for the short range. Half a mile at best. We need to narrow down where they took her first. I can find her but I need a place to
Finally, the t-shirt was gone and Sherlock pulled John with him as he rolled onto his back, moaning as John's warm weight settled above him, their bodies pressed together.
John's gaze went back and forth between the cook and Sherlock, trying to figure out what had happened before his arrival.
John, who had stopped chewing, looked up at him with big brown eyes - the wrong colour always caught Sherlock slightly off-guard - and gave a low huff as if to say 'what did you expect?'.
"You don't know, do you? You want me to come closer and you also know that you really shouldn't want that, so you'll tell me to leave. Is that about right?"
She stepped closer until she was a mere two feet in front of Sherlock. She was small, smaller than she had first appeared, and carried herself proudly. Her gaze was piercing as she studied Sherlock from head to toe.
He didn't care that John had been about to step away. Of course he had been - Sherlock hadn't reacted for too long.
Sherlock, having used the time they spent talking to examine the body more closely, got up. "I must say, Lestrade, this is the first time in months that you've actually been true to your word and given me a truly interesting mystery. Come along, John, time to take our enquiries elsewhere while we wait for the surveillance footage. Lestrade, text me when you get it, we'll meet you at the Yard."
John leaves his own bouquet of hydrangeas next to them and returns home, the warm something in his chest so large now he thinks his ribcage is going to burst open at any moment.
Several quick steps brought him to Sherlock's side. "Here's your wine," he said, handing Sherlock his glass and making sure their fingers brushed as he did so. "Who's your friend?"
John stroked him through it, trying to find the delicate balance between just enough and too much until Sherlock’s shaking subsided and he was left panting for air.
"I never thought I'd be here again," Sherlock said softly, looking around the room."You didn't change anything... much."
"Livestock prices are still quoted in guineas," she explained. "But you pay the equal value in British pounds. There's actually a 5% difference in value but that is considered the commissioner's fee, so it all evens out."
"What situation?" Donovan asked from the door, entering the room with John following right behind her. One look was enough to tell Sherlock his friend wouldn't require any food for a while.
John eyed him cautiously, his claws itching to break through his skin. Something had worried Sherlock. He didn't know what it was but he could sense it well enough. By now, he knew that anything that worried Sherlock should definitely worry him as well.
She blinked, then attempted to look mildly confused. "I'm Psy, just like you," she said and her voice was remarkably calm. "I do not have emotions."
While all around him chaos erupted as other people gathered around the scene, Sherlock wrestled down his utter disbelief at what his eyes were showing him and did the only thing that seemed to make sense. He pulled out his phone and hit speed dial, speaking the moment someone answered.
John Watson, army doctor, blogger and partner in crime-solving of one Sherlock Holmes, is lying flat on his back on the floor. He is surrounded by various Christmas decorations, tinsel, the tattered remains of a Christmas goose, bits and pieces of paper, bullet casings, pine needles and two empty glasses. There is a bundle of mistle toe hanging from the ceiling directly above his head and Sherlock Holmes' face pressed to his crotch.
"Seriously?," John asked back, not sure whether to laugh or groan in exasperation. "Two men locked in a dressing cubicle, one of them with his trousers 'round his ankles and the other on his knees in front of him? You seriously can't imagine how that might look to people?"
Large, warm hands land on his hips, pulling him closer. One moves to the small of his back, the tips of Sherlock's fingers sneaking just past the waistband of his jeans.
Sherlock shrugged. “If you say so. Just keep your voice down, John is still sleeping and I want him to get as much rest as he can.”
Sherlock frowned and rewound the video. He pressed 'Play' and watched it again, and again, and again.
It's early evening and Sally is running down the stairs to Westminster Station, hot on the heels of Lestrade and followed by a lot of constables. She glances up, catches sight of the Elizabeth Tower - Big Ben to most, though it's only the name of the bell inside - and feels her stomach turn at the idea of it destroyed.
John thought, moving until he was behind Sherlock and pressing his head against his legs to propel him forward and into the room.
Sherlock grabbed a pen and paper and scribbled down the name, address and contact details he could recall. “Here.”
John glared at him over the kong but was too busy to even try and reply with a sound that wasn't panting.
"It's all right," he said, then sighed. "No, that's a lie. It's definitely not all right. I hate that you won't be there for it and I hate that Mycroft can bully us like that. But it's not your fault and I don't blame you. All right?"
"Only if you take off your trousers," Sherlock said, voice muffled against the rough skin of the scar on John's shoulder.
"That would be my older brother," Sherlock said calmly, forcing all of his emotions far away. "Though I dare say that it would be rather hypocritical to judge me for my brother's occupation while your own mate is the daughter of a Councillor herself."
There were about two seconds of lips on lips, softly, and then Sherlock made a tiny noise and his mouth fell open and he pulled John closer and John's hands got tangled in Sherlock's hair and there was nothing soft about
"It's too warm to bother with a t-shirt," Sherlock told him. "Stop giving me that look, I'm hardly going to get sick just because of that."
John had then spent five minutes out on the street, pointedly glaring at a CCTV camera, until a black car had slowed to a stop in front of him. The good doctor had suffered a twenty-minute conversation with Mycroft in which he managed to tell him that Sherlock would be unavailable to retrieve any crucial files, hard drives or anything else his older brother might want him to do; and that no, they would not be attending the annual family Christmas dinner, thank you very much. If Mycroft had been impressed by the doctor's attitude, he had refrained from commenting.
He sighed and tried to think about Mary. Holding her in his arms, kissing her. He wondered what it would be like, dancing with her. She was small, about the same height as him. He would not have to raise his hands quite so high, wouldn't have to bend his head back at all, wouldn't breathe in the scent of Sherlock's shampoo and the air just before a storm and something oddly thrilling that was all Sherlock.
"I ... I think it may have started when I realised you shot the cabbie," he finally admitted. "Though I didn't realise it at the time. But ... it had a- a profound impact on me that I have never quite been able to describe even to myself. As for when I realised ..."
John whined, panicked. What was it? Had he been stung by a bee? He raised his paw, trying to look at the underside, but his coordination was not up to the task yet.
Far too soon, he reached the top of the stairs. The sight of the familiar sitting room door, half-open as always, sent a pang through his heart. He wondered how much of the flat had changed since he had fled from it.
Of course, even a marriage certificate hadn't been enough to keep Sherlock with him in the end but that was another story.
He opened his eyes, not the least bit surprised to find John looking at him. It was still a surprise to see a dog where he would expect his friend. Except that he would never have expected to see John's face upon waking in his bed. Hoped for, perhaps, in a rare moment of maudlin self-indulgence, but never expected.
So far he had seen Sherlock high on tranquiliser and various painkillers, as well as drugged at Baskerville.
So he would have to content himself with what excuses he could get away with. Petting Johnny in public so as not to seem like a neglectful owner, sneaking in little touches in private under the guise of checking him for injuries and-
"Hello Mycroft," Lestrade said, interrupting Sherlock's musing as he climbed into the car, taking a seat next to the man which put him on the seat opposite John.
Sherlock stood in the sitting room, the slam of the door still reverberating through his skull, and wondered how long it would take John to come back.
While Sherlock was still busy trying to sort out how to feel about this surprising turn of events, John did something unexpected. He always did that when Sherlock was least prepared for him to. It was the reason he enjoyed John's company so much. Every time Sherlock was sure he knew exactly what John was going to do or say, he would catch him completely by surprise.
John looked around the pub and raised his eyebrows. "If you wanted peace and quiet, why on earth did you come here?"
"Not yet. She says she reached out but hasn't heard back yet. Apparently the other healer is taking her kids to a football match today so she won't see the message for a while."
"I'm coming, I'm coming," Sherlock grumbled at him, closing the last button on his shirt and pulling on his suit jacket before reaching for his coat. "Where's your lead?"
Sherlock nodded at him, drank a sip of his tea and glanced down at his phone. "I'll got and check in with my homeless network," he said. "I couldn't find some of them earlier but perhaps I will have more luck now."
The past hours had given John a lot of time to think, to work through Sherlock's confession about Rosie's bee and what it meant, the sliver of hope it gave them.
"The same question applies, Mrs Hudson. I was held by the Serbians for a while and then came straight here. They don't hold with feeding their prisoners full rations. Too much risk of someone puking all over their shoes during the forcible attempts at extracting information."
They turned towards home and Sherlock waited until they were out of hearing range before he spoke. "Mycroft called. Apparently, his scientists have had a breakthrough. He's sending a car as we speak. We're going back to Baskerville."
It was Eliza who replied with a shake of her head. "They haven't arrested anyone yet but we've been assured that it was someone from outside the hotel. Apparently there have been some food thefts from the kitchens. They think Freddy just happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time."
He had been a bit disappointed to be unsuitable for the role of Sentinel, but his loner status also meant that he was not nearly as disappointed as another member of the pack would have been and his conscience would not allow him to take on the position regardless if he could not put his full heart and soul into it.
"It's so nice to have you here," Mrs Hudson says, hovering in the doorway. "I'm glad I never got around to furnishing it, besides the kitchen - your brothers certainly made quick work of getting all your furniture here and setting it up."
John barely managed to catch it with his right hand, then continued to drag Sherlock into the hall and past the bathroom door towards his bedroom.
He points to a cupboard and she pulls it open to find the promised plates next to a pile of - hopefully empty - Petri dishes and a wicker basket full of instruments she doesn't want to imagine anyone using.
It made John's skin itch, to think that Sherlock had flung part of his mind, his conscience, out of his body and into the ether, that he was in the mental equivalent of the internet. Were there safeguards? There had to be. He had mentioned shields before and John knew all changelings had natural shields. Did that mean Sherlock had built his shields himself? Was he protecting himself adequately? What was it he was looking for in other people's minds?
Sherlock lay with his back to him, still fully clothed in the beautiful suit he had worn earlier and curled up tight. For all his gangly limbs, he looked shockingly small. He was breathing very softly and John wasn't sure if he was even awake.
"Do you expect me to wear this instead?" John demanded, plucking at the edge of the lab coat he wore wrapped around himself like a very unusual dressing gown.
They got up early the next morning, had a large breakfast and walked through the Princes Street Gardens towards Hanover Street, where they caught a bus to the Royal Botanic Gardens. Although it was a lot cooler in Edinburgh than it had been in London, the sun was shining and, knowing they would spend the day outdoors, they had both donned a pair of sunglasses. Sherlock rarely wore his back home and had never seen John wearing glasses of any kind. It was very distracting and he hoped John would get a chance to wear them all day. Right now, it promised to be a beautiful day, though Sherlock felt compelled to point out that you never knew with the Scottish weather.
He swirled his wine around in his glass, took a small sip and put it aside. It did feel a bit like celebrating. He could still feel the last little flutters of panic at the mere thought of all the things that could have gone wrong today. Even the long drive back to London had not been enough to help him calm down completely, though not all of that was due to the things that might have befallen John during the process of re-transformation.
As soon as they were settled back around the table, Sherlock leaned forward and lowered his voice. "If any of this gets out and reaches the Council ears, my life is forfeit. As is John's. Do you understand?"
"Is something the matter?" Even as he spoke, Sherlock was already reaching for him, running one hand down John's right front leg.
"Almost done," Sherlock promised and turned to John's legs, aiming the shower spray against the direction of his fur to get as much dirt out as he could. "Your legs and paws probably needed a bath anyway. You've been walking through London and running around in Regent's Park for over a week now and we both know London isn't precisely famous for its cleanliness."
Reassured that his friend was nearby and probably having a lot of fun - Sherlock enjoyed chases - John put on another burst of speed just as Conall veered off the street and into a park. The soft earth and grass gave John the grip he needed and he closed in quickly. He could hear the swish of her ponytail and every gasping breath she took. He was barely running at full capacity now and having the time of his life. And then, finally, he was close enough.
"Nothing," Sherlock says innocently and for a moment John feels like he's been punched in the lungs. Then: "There's not much I can do with you pinning me to the ground, John."
Like the feeling of John's fingers pressing into the dips between his ribs through his shirt, the warm hands bracketing his hips, the taste of John's tongue in his mouth, the taste of John's mouth when Sherlock dared to reciprocate.
"Well, there are no traces, no evidence, nothing. So the killer was experienced and knew what he or she was doing, right? So I figured there must be other murders like that. Unsolved ones, I mean, without a scrap of evidence. Doesn't even have to be the same kind of kill, if it's a professional hit. So I started looking through all our unsolved cases from the past two years to find the ones that fit the same criteria: clean kill, no signs of a struggle, no evidence or leads."
Sherlock frowned, pensive, then stood and pulled John into the bathroom, where he proceeded to turn on the shower.
Sherlock made a sound that was very nearly a sob, or possibly a laugh, and turned his head to kiss the palm of John's right hand. "My John."
"Shhh," Mrs Hudson murmured, rocking him as if he were a little boy. "I know it hurts, my dear. But I promise you, you will get through this. And he will come to his senses. He may be as stubborn as a rock but he's not a complete idiot. You could never love a moron."
John stepped back into the sitting room, threw the towel over one muscular shoulder and crossed his arms. "I'm not sure I believe what I heard. Since when are you interested in skin privileges?"
He steeled himself. It had been at least half an hour since John had said these outrageous words - plenty of time for him to change his mind. Sherlock wasn't entirely certain how he would deal with having this snatched away from him now.
Perhaps it was his tone of voice, too soft, too tremulous even when talking to his own fantasy, but John sat up.
John decided it was time to do something, and if that meant sacrificing a piece of his own peace of mind, then so be it. At this rate, he would end up losing said peace of mind anyway, so he might as well sacrifice it for the greater good of getting Sherlock to let go of some of his tension.
They shared a look of understanding and finally snuck back out, John carrying Sherlock's wet clothes and the detective pausing at one of the deck chairs by the poolside to pick up his coat which he had thrown there before jumping into the water. It felt as if it had been hours ago.
"I thank you very much for bringing this to my attention, Mr James. If you would be so kind to leave your card for me so I can contact you if I have further questions, I would be much obliged."
Holmes seems more relaxed after that, and a lot happier. Sally can only hope that John has confirmed his intention to stay indefinitely. She comes home from work one evening to find a van idling outside while a couple of very serious looking muscular men carry boxes into the flat. They are wearing wires that curl from behind their ears into their collars and Sally surmises that Mycroft Holmes must have decided to expedite John's move by having his own people bring the rest of John's stuff to 221b.
He leaned forward a little more and started nuzzling at John's neck, peppering tiny nips and bites along the soft skin under his jaw.
Sherlock lifted his hips and his trousers slid past them and down those long legs easily. The soft whisper of the fabric was unnaturally loud in the room and for a long moment they simply stared at one another, amazed by the simple fact of each other's existence.
Sherlock rolled his eyes. "No point. I didn't even have to leave the house to work the case. When Johnny and I came home from our walk this morning, the lead was waiting for us right here in the sitting room."
