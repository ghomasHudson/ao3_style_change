Tasha’s shouting gleefully, saying that everyone helped to choose it, and Steve is standing tall and looking pleased and proud.
– God, Tony, so brilliant, so proud of you, did you know that? And you have this idea that you’re not worth it. And that’s why you misunderstood the letter. And I know you’re beating yourself up about it, but. Tony. It’s
She smiles at him distractedly, glossy nails clicking on the edge of her glass. ‘Would you like to go, dear? I said you could, but you don’t have to, of course.’
as though she’s enclosed on all sides by Steve-ness. Safe like being in a warm blanket or the suit or something, just nicer even than that, because Steve’s
Steve, and he feels like he has to hide his face because of – everything, so he ducks his head down into the warm pillow of Steve’s chest and wraps his arms around him as far as they’ll go, hugging him fiercely.
After Steve has whispered, ‘Not – not like that, not this time, please, I want. I want to hold you, Tony –
Darcy giggles. ‘You’re pretty as well, Tony, don’t be silly!’ She gives him a little hug, too. Darcy does that a lot. Tony secretly kind of likes it, but he would still rather be sitting next to Steve.
‘I’m so – I’m so close,’ Steve tells her unsteadily. One hand is between her own legs now, moving faster, and she’s cupping Tony’s neck with the other, gently tugging at the soft fur of the garment until she can slide it off Tony’s shoulder, leaving it bare. Tony hums contentedly and pulls away from her breast, tipping her head to allow Steve better access to her neck. ‘Good girl – you’re so good for me,’ Steve mumbles, ‘such a darling baby girl, all mine, so beautiful and perfect and sweet, letting me touch,’ and her mouth is latching and sucking at the juncture of Tony’s neck, and Tony floats in warm waves of euphoria, loving that she can make Steve lose her head like this, beautiful, calm, perfect Steve.
Next week, Tony comes to school and goes slowly to his desk and puts his head down and curls his arms around it so no-one can see his face.
But right now, he still feels sleepy and wobbly, and his hands are shaky when he tries to hold things. So he just yawns contentedly and hands the knife back, basking in the safety and sunshine. After a bit, Steve puts the hide down and curls an arm around Tony, and Tony rests his head trustingly on Steve’s broad shoulder.
When Mom finishes the book, she sets it lightly on Tony’s bedside table, but sits there for a moment, holding his hand. Tony’s eyes are heavy and trying to close, but he struggles to keep them open a little bit longer, because Mom’s right there with him and he doesn’t want to miss it. ‘Thank,’ he says drowsily, and Mom laughs a little bit, a sweet quiet laugh. She leans to tuck him in, the CatBearPuppy cuddled in by his side.
Steve doesn’t have to know that Tony’s sort of fallen in love with her. It’s completely and utterly hopeless, of course, Tony knows that, but that doesn’t mean she can’t sit close into Steve’s warmth and
She feels Steve shaking in silent laughter, next to her; and then Steve bends down to Tony’s ear. ‘Kissy kissy,’ she whispers, because Steve’s a total dork; and Tony can’t help shivering at the feeling of Steve’s warm breath on the shell of her ear.
The bowl is finished too quickly, but Tony knows that you can get sick from eating too much all at once after a hungry time. He feels sleepy again, warm and content and safe, and Steve’s shared his food with him and he trusts Steve. Tony curls back down into the skins and watches Steve eat, looking down shyly when Steve looks up and sees him. When Tony peeks at him again, through his eyelashes, Steve is smiling back at him. It makes Tony’s stomach feel strange and fluttery, as though it’s full of moths.
Steve steers herself onto a stool at the kitchenette, squeezing Tony’s wrist, smiling at her a little bit, lopsided. Tony wants to kiss her, but she doesn’t, she just grins back at Steve and looks away, fingers busying themselves with the first aid kit.
‘Okay,’ Natasha says agreeably, but Tony hardly hears her because he’s too busy staring at Darcy with round eyes.
The iris is very blue. Steve’s eyes are blue. Hothouse flowers, it’s nearly Christmas, where had Steve got these anyway? She must have gone out – Tony’s imagination streaks ahead, Steve going and ordering flowers, choosing them – for Tony!
it and he buries his face in the soft fur and wraps his arms around it and hugs it and hugs it and hugs it. ‘
And Tony nestles into the soft skin of Steve’s shoulder, wrung out and exhausted and content, and sleeps.
and on instinct she bites at Steve's shoulder through the damp T-shirt, tasting salt and cotton. Steve makes a low gasping sound, her head arching back, her fingers clenching on Tony's skin.
It is totally going to be the best ever party. There’s a tree, a really great tree and everyone had helped decorate it together, and Dummy and Butterfingers and You had helped put up tinsel everywhere (even if some of the stuff did end up in weird places like the shower cubicle and inside the microwave). Tony had tried to get Dummy to make punch, too, but Dummy had put machine oil in it, which was a horrible waste and Tony would totally donate that useless bot to a city college except that it was Christmas.
thing she's got going for Steve, a really stupid, stupid idea – and she stares miserably down into the coffee mug. 'I know you – wouldn't.'
And Steve had – had touched her, touched her gently, wonderfully, and God, Tony doesn’t know what it all means. She doesn’t – she just can’t, it’s too much to get clear in her mind, too messy, completely different from the calculations and equations and diagrams that come easily, smoothly. Far away in the back of her mind there’s a furious alarm going, the urgent warning bell of a bruised little heart that cautions loss and fear and abandonment. It’s hazy, muted by the floating exhilaration from Steve’s touch, but it’s there, always there.
‘’Kay,’ Natasha says easily, and hooks Darcy’s pinky before doing a sideways crab-walk back to her own desk to share the news about pinky-shakes with Clint.
Steve kicks the ground, his hands shoved deep into his pockets. His face is a little bit crumpled, as though he might want to be crying himself if he wasn’t
Tony jumps up and lurches away. ‘What – what are you doing?’ she says, distraught, ‘you can’t just act like – you, you sent me a letter! This doesn’t change anything!’
But Steve’s hand just squeezes his arm, rough and comforting, and then tentatively moves around to rest on Tony’s back. ‘It’s okay,’ Steve says gruffly. ‘Y’can – y’can cry, I don’t care, I’ll – I’ll
, Tony realises, and she swallows hard as a great starry-eyed wave of wonderment washes up over her, because when has anyone worried about that ever?
But Steve glances up, and sort of laughs, a sort of sniffle-laugh, but still a laugh, and says, ‘Yeah. Yeah, I should – I should do that. Thanks,’ and grabs a handful of tissues and blows into them hard. Then she clears her throat, and looks up at Tony properly, and her face is still blotched and pink, but she looks like
Tony even knows some of the other kids, now. There’s Steve, of course. Tony isn’t quite sure what to think of Steve. Steve likes drawing and sometimes fighting. He’s not scared of
It’s only when Tony goes limp and shaking and exhausted, overwhelmed tears in her eyes, that Steve relents, flicking off the spray. She holds Tony for a few moments, rocking a little and gently thumbing away the tears. ‘Good girl,’ she whispers. ‘Such a very good girl for me, aren’t you? Always. You’ve had a lot. Let’s get you sorted out.’
the plane! She even knows all about the engines and stuff, because she did a whole Engineering degree! And she looks a little bit shocked when Tony shyly asks about the thrusters and the angle of the ailerons, but it’s okay because after a moment she just smiles again and explains how they work, and Darcy’s Mamá is
, he can feel it, and he glares at Mr Karolidis under his own brows, because Mr Karolidis doesn’t understand. It’s
Steve’s smile widens, but he just repeats, ‘Pretty. Now rest,’ and though his words are different to the ones Tony uses, the meaning becomes clear when he pats the bedskins again. Tony pouts.
He moves his head, and there is the Stranger, sitting by the fire and stirring something in a bark container strung over the low flames. Tony huddles into the skins, watching, afraid yet fascinated.
He can feel the strong rise and fall of Steve’s breath, the life beating steadily in Steve’s chest. Then Steve’s arms tighten around him and Steve nuzzles Tony’s hair.
Tony,’ and then shifted so that she can rock against Tony’s hip and hand, clinging on to Tony’s shoulders for purchase with unsteady fingers. After Steve has climaxed in just a few minutes with a small choked sound of shock, biting softly into the hollow of Tony’s neck, Tony caressing her face and back and skin with gentle little touches as she comes apart.
Steve goes on stroking her hair, one-handed, her fingers raking soothingly through Tony’s curls. Tony leans into the touch, just a very little, taking Steve’s damaged hand carefully in her own, cradling it as she starts to clean it up as well.
,' Steve says very firmly. Tony fleetingly glances up at her; for an instant Steve's eyes are fixed on Bucky in a meaningful sort of way, lips pressed together, her jawline tight. But then she looks back at Tony and her face softens reassuringly, and she says brightly, 'right, everyone, now Tony's here, what do you all want to eat?'
‘That. That’s just incredible,’ Tony moans, ‘just great, listen to her, everyone, is there, like, any sympathy here? Can I get some sympathy? Because seriously, seriously!’
Tony loves the bright red cupcake, even before he tastes it. Steve can tell because of the way his eyes go round and wondrous when Steve offers it to him. And Steve looks at Tony’s long pretty eyelashes and his big brown eyes and his pink mouth, and for some reason he thinks about Mr Karolidis’s granddaughter.
Tony’s in the middle of the wiring, so she can’t go and watch. But she listens to Steve’s wonderful laugh, and seeing as her head’s in the microwave, she doesn’t bother to stop herself from smiling.
'Steve won't care,' Tony says woefully. He tries not to let his lip tremble, but he must fail, because Natasha pokes it.
Tony stares at him, his mouth falling open in surprise. Clint’s looking small and hunched and lonely, and Tony suddenly has a funny kind of hurting in his chest, because Clint looks just like Tony feels sometimes. He’s always been a little bit afraid of Clint, but – but maybe, maybe Clint just wants friends, just like Tony wants friends.
She leans back, cautiously, so that she can just feel the hint of warmth from Steve’s arm, because that’s pretty acceptable, right, that’s okay, Steve’ll hardly notice.
There’s a long pause, and Tony’s face gets hotter and hotter and Clint doesn’t say anything and oh, no, Clint doesn’t want to be friends with him at
And after a few steps, Tony feels rough little fingers reach for his hand. Steve’s not looking at him, but he’s holding Tony’s hand, and Tony feels proud and shy and warm all over, because Steve’s his favourite of
She holds Tony for a few minutes, floating on the waves of pleasure rolling through her body from Tony’s touches; every so often she thumbs the wet patch at Tony’s centre, holding Tony steady as she gasps and squirms. Each time, Steve praises her for being good and keeping her hands where she was told, and Tony glows at the praise even as her breathing hitches and sobs from the teasing. There’s a glistening trail slipping down her thigh, and Steve smears at it, brings her fingers up to her mouth and licks at Tony’s faint sweet-salt taste.
Steve makes a spot for Tony and him on the edge of the blanket, and Tony sits down and crosses his legs, looking around wide-eyed. He's never been on a picnic party before, so he doesn't quite know what to do, but after a bit it doesn't seem like there's many rules at all. Everyone just starts eating, and there's not much in the way of plates and forks but no one seems to care.
of pink iced cupcakes that she helped make with her Mamá, one for everyone in the class. And she has a new bear, a wonderful pink and purple fluffy bear with floppy arms.
‘Merry Christmas, Tony,’ Steve whispers when she pulls away, and brushes warm cherishing lips against Tony’s forehead one more time, fingers slipping gently through Tony’s curls.
Jane sits next to a girl with glasses called Darcy. She looks at Tony inquisitively when he gets there, and watches him closely as he unpacks. Tony doesn’t look at her, because tears are prickling behind his eyes.
Steve finds her nipple through the soft fur, rubbing her thumb coaxingly across it until Tony starts to make small musical sounds of pleasure, softly rubbing her cheek against Steve’s neck. There’s slickness between her legs, sliding a little down one thigh; everything narrows down to three bright pinpoints of desire. Steve’s thumb on her nipple – Tony’s lips tingling against Steve’s neck – the throbbing untouched spot right –
like that. Steve’s eyes are big and bright, watching Tony’s face, and he touches them both and everything is warmth and Steve’s touch and the wonderful way it feels as Tony writhes into Steve’s hands.
‘Whose – whose birthday?’ Tony falters. He has to know, because they only birthday he can think of soon is – but no, it couldn’t be. Could it?
Tony, I’m so – sorry,’ and Tony strokes a hesitant hand up and down the long graceful line of Steve’s back, her throat going all tight and painful and aching.
so terribly, desperately hungry that his stomach clenches with emptiness. He must make a sound of longing, because Steve looks over at him and says, ‘Soon,’ stirring at whatever is in the container.
‘Shh,’ he says. ‘Trying to have a serious discussion with Captain Rogers here, duckling,’ and then Tony licks his hand. ‘Ugh. You’re such a child,’ Rhodey says.
Steve’s forehead might not need stitches, but it looks a mess: a big broken red patch, blood smeared into Steve’s golden eyebrows and matting her hair. Tony washes her hands, gets a bowl and fills it with lukewarm water, drips in the dark red antiseptic, watching it swirl and cloud and colour the water.
Tony thinks, and firmly pushes down on the soft, floaty, squirmy feeling in the pit of her stomach. It's no use
Everyone who drops me a comment gets a CINNAMON COOKIE, because I love you all. *puts trays in oven*
Stevie,’ Bucky says, coming to stand by Steve’s shoulder. He’s looking, pointedly, at the big bite-mark high on Tony’s neck. ‘Feeling better now, are we?’
‘Captain Rogers has just left an envelope outside your door,’ JARVIS informs her, and Tony, who’s stumbling out of the bathroom in a daze of happy anticipation of seeing Steve and unwrapping presents round their tree, stops dead in her tracks as though something’s reached in and squeezed the heart in her chest. What possible reason could Steve have for leaving a note instead of coming in, except – except…
Tony’s mother drops him off at the gate with a light kiss on the cheek. Tony wishes very, very hard that she would come in with him – he can see other kids holding their parents’ hands as they walk inside – but he knows that he has to be braver than that. He’s always done things on his own.
‘Hey,’ Steve says in a soft voice. ‘Tony. Look at me.’ Her fingertips stroke at the hair at Tony’s neck, Steve’s palm warm and steady on Tony’s nape, her thumb rubbing little circles in her skin. Tony sucks in a long fortifying breath and makes herself look back at Steve’s face.
When the bell goes for break, Darcy grabs Tony’s hand. ‘C’mon,’ she says, bouncing. ‘Let’s run really fast and maybe we can get the good swings!’
Tony dabs at Steve’s temple with a wad of sodden cotton wool, very gently, certainly much more gently than she’s ever been with herself. She carefully dampens the dried blood in Steve’s hair, cleaning it away; wipes at the red smears around the edges, strokes Steve’s hair softly away from her forehead so that it doesn’t catch in the wound. She can just smell Steve’s own warm sweet scent under the bitey aroma of antiseptic and the slight tang of blood. Steve always smells so good.
thought that Dad might be able to come to his birthday this year. But then last night Dad had said he was going away for four weeks, and – and – Tony’s not
a long time. Steve’s fingers are tangling tenderly in her hair, now, Steve’s thumb caressing the soft patch of skin behind Tony’s ear.
‘Mamá! This is Tony an’ Steve!’ Darcy says. ‘Tony’s my friend, he’s really nice and smart and likes hugs and you have to be nice to him. An’ that’s Steve.’ She pushes her glasses up her nose with one hand and adds, ‘Me ‘n’ Steve are sorta friends. A bit.’
Tony thinks about it. A giant metal fire gorilla does sound pretty cool. ‘Yeah,’ he decides, and reaches for his Drawing book.
, and Steve is the sort of person who’s always clean and fresh and wholesome and has gentle hands and smells nice, like soap and cinnamon cookies. And Tony is filthy and covered in grease and grime and blood, and so it is sort of embarrassing. Like sort of very, painfully, horribly embarrassing.
There’s a tall lady in the middle of the classroom, surrounded by the kids and parents. ‘Okay, everyone find a desk,’ she’s calling. She’s got bright red hair and every inch of her skin is covered in freckles, and she looks kind of firm but Tony thinks he likes her anyway. There’s a girl standing right next to her, a few years older than Tony, with straight shiny strawberry hair, and Tony hears the tall lady say to the girl, ‘Off to your class now, Pepper. Have a nice day, sweetheart.’
as his birthday party. But Darcy’s standing there, looking pleased and bounceful, holding a roundish lumpy parcel wrapped in pink paper with a gold bow. ‘Open it, open it!’ she says, and puts it in Tony’s hands.
Tony gasps in surprise, and Steve looks down with a concerned furrow between his brows. But Steve is very strong and it’s comfortable and warm in his arms, and Tony nestles in contentedly, smiling up at Steve in consent.
‘Natasha,’ Bruce says in his soft voice; he’s trying not to laugh, and she widens her eyes at him and spreads her hands.
Somehow they make it up off the floor, and Tony guides Steve back so she’s sitting on the bed, an odd fierce wave of protectiveness surging through her as she sees Steve’s blotchy face and the tears clinging onto her thick lovely lashes. ‘Hey, hey, wait,’ she says, and grabs the box of tissues from the nightstand. Steve sort of just stares at it for a moment, so Tony says, ‘you can, you know, blow your nose. I mean, if you want to, if you don’t it doesn’t matter, I’ll just take the box away,’ and then wants to hit herself on the head to stop all the words.
Tony sits between Darcy and Steve, in the car after school. He’s shivering, just a little bit, because it’s so – exciting, and different, and it feels a little bit like he’s in a dream or something.
‘Oh God,’ Steve says, her voice soft and slurred with pleasure. ‘Supposed t’go down there about an hour ago. Bucky and Clint – going t’be bouncin’ through the
Something clinks softly on the nightstand, snapping her out of it before she can panic too much. 'Brought you coffee,' says Steve, and there's a pause and a gentle hand on Tony's shoulder through the covers. 'You okay?'
Tony wriggles her toes in the water, squirming a little, and Steve kisses her cheek. ‘That’s right, darling,’ she murmurs. ‘Let’s get you nice and clean,’ and Tony sighs with soft content and rests her head against Steve’s shoulder.
‘Like this,’ Darcy makes her pinky finger into a crook and reaches out for Tony’s hand, hooking his own pinky with hers. ‘See? Han’shake. You can only do it with friends.’
After a while, he touches Steve’s knee softly, to get his attention, and points to the knife. He knows some of Steve’s words, now, for ‘medicine’ and ‘food’ and ‘fire’ and ‘rest’, and he wants to learn Steve’s word for the tool.
Tony takes a deep wondering breath, clutching at the little red car. Maggie phoned his Mom. He’s going to have a party, a birthday party
‘What – no,’ she whispers, half to JARVIS, half to herself. ‘Not – already, no, really?’ She feels sick, because she – she might have known, know it couldn’t last, not even twenty-four hours, of course it couldn’t. What had she been thinking –
The first bite is so good that it makes Tony hum with happiness. The pocket is all folded up around bits of chicken and ham and lettuce and barbeque sauce, and lots and lots of melted cheese, and it isn’t anything like what Tony eats at home but it's full of delicious flavour. 'S'good!' he tells Maggie worshipfully, and then remembers that his mouth is full and blushes deeply, covering it with his hand.
, he knows how to count and he’d gone and checked on his calendar to make absolutely completely sure, even though he
Darcy’s Mamá looks nice, warm and laughing. Her eyes are all dark and sparkly, and she’s got her arm around Darcy’s shoulders as she moves round the room, answering everyone’s questions. Tony wonders if Darcy would mind if he came and said hi. Probably not? He doesn’t think Darcy would mind. But it’s kind of scary, so he stays safely next to Steve, just watching.
‘Tony!’ Steve bursts in like a storm, glancing urgently around till she sees Tony at the bench, striding over. ‘Oh, my God, Tony, you can’t – don’t
Shit, she’s blushing, she can feel it, face and neck hot, hot, hot, and she keeps catching little glimpses of Steve’s
It feels good. Tony mumbles happily and nestles into the warmth of Steve’s body, and Steve reaches up to run his fingers through Tony’s hair. Tony’s eyes droop closed at the feeling, and Steve’s fingers slide through his curls, stroking, stroking, stroking, until Tony drifts back into warm soft sleep.
Tony sighs in relief, a big smile spreading across his face. Clint’s pinky is small and rough and warm, and Tony squeezes it gently. ‘That’s
Steve perches on the sofa arm next to her and pats Tony’s shoulder. ‘Aw, honey,’ she says, half-laughing, and Tony’s mouth goes dry as she registers the long curve of Steve’s thigh brushing against her arm. She just has a dizzy moment to think how surprisingly soft it is, even through Steve’s jeans; and then Steve’s moving lightning-quick, lunging towards Natasha and snagging the sesame chicken out of her hands.
‘How about something to keep your hands busy, honey?’ she soothes, taking pity. She takes Tony’s wrist in her fingers, guiding Tony’s hand to Steve’s mouth, and nudges with her lips until Tony’s fingers curl open, pressing a kiss to the palm and then sliding her tongue along the delicate crease at the base of Tony’s fingers. Steve licks in warm and wet between them, tasting the faint salt of Tony’s skin and feeling Tony’s pulse jump wildly.

to be closer, closer, needs to touch and taste and feel Steve everywhere, and she’s still crying but she turns her face into Steve’s neck and opens her mouth rather desperately, licking at the warm beating pulsepoint. Steve makes a little sharp surprised sound, and her hand seems to slip of its own accord into the gap beneath Tony’s T-shirt, warm skin on warm skin.
The rush of water smoothly shuts off in the background once it reaches the right level, and welcoming quietness seems to settle around them. Steve can feel Tony’s breaths, in and out, a little quickened, and the strong living beat of Tony’s heart. It’s like she’s holding life, Tony’s life, there in her hands, infinitely precious and to be protected; and Steve bends to kiss the mass of pale scars between Tony’s breasts. Her lips linger there for a moment, and it’s as though something shifts, and Tony shudders with want, her hands coming up to curl pleadingly around Steve’s arms.
‘See?’ she murmurs, opening her hand to show what’s in it. It’s a small green stone with a silky cord attached, and Tony brings up curious fingers to touch it. ‘It’s a jade egg, sweet thing,’ Steve says, stroking her tummy. ‘It goes down here,’ she wriggles her fingers downwards, and Tony jerks involuntarily – ‘right inside you. Would you like that?’
He doesn’t know why his face is so hot, or why he feels so ashamed and worried; it’s too dumb and too confusing and he doesn’t want to think about it. So he hunches down over his milk and glares at it and swirls the glass around so that the milk makes a funnel and spills onto the scratched wood.
It’s only when Tony goes limp and shaking and exhausted, overwhelmed tears in her eyes, that Steve relents.
‘Not sore!’ Tony tells him quickly, and smiles shyly up at Steve. Steve crinkles his eyes, and then his hands are smoothing up Tony’s arms, slow and sure, moving up to his forearms and cupping them, stroking back and forth.
‘Yeah,’ she whispers, and Steve strokes her forehead and scoops her up to take her to the bathroom. Tony wraps around her like a baby monkey, her head resting on Steve’s shoulder, her hand coming shyly up to cup Steve’s breast through her shirt. She hides her face in Steve’s neck, because that’s another thing Tony sometimes does when they do this; she goes timid and embarrassed for a little while, until Steve coaxes her out of it. Her face and neck are pink, and Steve bends over her and kisses the vulnerable spot behind Tony’s ear, hiding a smile against her hot skin.
Tony bites his lip, hesitates. ‘You got that one wrong,’ he points out softly, and then flinches when Steve’s brows go down even further. ‘I mean, I – I could help you? An’ then we could draw it t’gether?’
And then Tony’s T-shirt is being yanked off, and Steve’s fingers are fumbling at her underwear and then it’s tossed across the room, and
It comes at last, that little half-sob that Tony makes every time she asks this, and then Tony’s voice comes, small and wobbly. ‘Want – want you to take care of me.’
‘Okay,’ Steve whispers. ‘Okay.’ Her hands smooth down Tony’s back, firm and reassuring, slowing the pace, and Tony clings onto her, breathing heavily. She tips her face up after a moment, pleading, and Steve meets her with a kiss, slow and quiet and unhurried. It seems to go on for hours, Steve suckling gently at Tony's bottom lip as Tony melts into it, making little soft involuntary sounds.
’ Tony’s muttering crossly, still glaring. And Steve looks at him unhappily, and Tony seems to deflate, all the anger going out of him. ‘Of
And then Steve’s teeth sink gently into the soft slackness of Tony’s lower lip, and she makes a high, desperate sound, and grinds
One day Steve leaves his gold pencil lying on the edge of his desk. Tony doesn’t mean to touch, but – it’s right there, and it’s
Tony nuzzles against her neck, too floaty and happy and sleepy to answer. She’s drifting on waves of warmth, and Steve is solid and close and warm and wrapped around her. ‘Sleep now, sweetheart,’ she hears, as though it’s coming from a great distance, and so she does.
me,’ Bucky growls, making threatening eyes at Clint under his brows. Clint’s chin comes up stubbornly, suddenly looking much more awake, and Tony watches in bemusement as they make several seconds of charged eye-contact.
Steve looks at him quickly, and stops as well. ‘Hey,’ he says gruffly, and then his arm is coming round Tony’s shoulders in a protective sort of way.
‘What’s it mean?’ Tony asks, nuzzling at Steve’s warm pinkened neck, but Steve just laughs and kisses her nose.
, Steve’s room, and it's the morning, and, shit, was she so out to it that Steve had to bring her here, and she didn’t even notice? Oh God, had she –
Maggie’s kneeling in front of him. ‘It’s okay, Tony,’ she says gently, as he trembles. ‘It’s okay. Can you breathe for me? Deep breaths in and out.’ Her voice is warm and kind and reassuring, and Tony swallows again and finds he can breath along with Maggie. Steve is gently patting on his back, and Darcy is cuddly on his other side, and after a bit Tony opens his eyes again.
Tony watches him warily, fingers twisting nervously in the soft fur of the skins. But Steve stays still, hands staying where Tony can see them, his eyes fixed on Tony’s face, clear and earnest. Only when Tony untenses a little does Steve lower his hands.
‘Huh,’ Steve says, folding his arms. After a moment he adds, ‘My mom’s cooler.’ He sounds rather defensive.
‘I gotta sleep,’ Steve yawns. ‘So tired I could drop,’ and there’s that Steve-ness, that command, because everyone forgets about the snogging and starts standing up and saying they’re going to bed too, and seriously, why don’t they listen to Tony like that, it’s her house after all.
‘As a thankyou,’ Steve goes on softly, and then she bites her lip, ‘and. And because – well, I really do think you’re pretty great.’
and he just wants to lie down and rest because he feels too hot and too cold and dizzy all at the same time, but the Stranger is too close and too large.
Darcy’s other mother is called Alex, and she has soft eyes that make you feel safe. She doesn’t fuss over Tony, or make him feel stupid, just sits on the ground as well and starts picking daisies and showing them all how to make flower crowns. It’s
After a bit Steve shudders and chokes out, 'God, m'sorry.' Tony squeezes tighter, because she's so out of her depth here, she doesn't even know how to deal with her own nightmares, let alone someone else's, and all she can think to do is just hold onto Steve. Steve's slumped so that her hair is just below Tony's chin, bright gold, sleep-mussed and silky-soft; and Tony tilts her head and rests her cheek in it, nestling a little, and she dares to drop a kiss there, soft and secret and so gentle that it aches.
uses too many words, why can’t she shut up already, she’s going to make Steve cry again, she’s making a mess of it already.
‘Okay,’ Steve says reluctantly, and sits down again. Tony snuffles, woebegone, and shifts a little bit closer to Steve on his chair. He doesn’t want Steve to go away, really, and Steve’s hand had felt good on his back. He wants Steve to put it back there, and, and
‘No, darling,’ Steve murmurs, lifting her head. She takes Tony’s hands in her own, holding them tenderly. ‘I want you to keep your hands still, okay, baby?’ She lays Tony’s hands over Tony’s stomach, positioning them so that her smallest fingers are brushing the lacy waist of her pants. ‘Do you think you can keep them there for me without touching?’
Steve squeezes her fingers, and there’s a sweet, sweet look on her face and those soft eyes, and for a crazy moment Tony thinks Steve’s going to kiss her. But then Steve’s arm slips down from her neck, curling warm and strong around Tony’s back, drawing her in close to her chest and cuddling her there. Steve’s wearing an ancient old soft T-shirt, worn thin and threadbare, and Tony buries her nose in it, in the soft place by Steve’s shoulder, sniffing in Steve’s warm nice smell.
And it should be irritating, it should be rubbing Tony right up the wrong way, all the fussing and bossing, except that it isn't, because it's so nice to have someone looking after her, just this once. And Steve smiles at her, and reaches out to brush her thumb over the dried tear tracks on Tony's cheekbone, very softly, before she leaves Tony in the bathroom.
‘I – I really am. Sorry,’ Steve says in a small tense voice – and then, in a rush, ‘I won’t – I’ll try – Iwantyoutobemyfriendtoo.’
And Steve looks back at Tony’s face, and Tony breathes in fast, because Steve’s face, his face is so –
‘When’s your birthday, Tony?’ Darcy asks, petting his hair as they sit on the floor surrounded by cardboard boxes and string.
Steve pulls away, and brings his hand up to Tony’s face, stroking it. ‘Pretty,’ he says, with another soft look, and then glances around around the room, considering. ‘Ah!’ he says, and gently turns Tony’s face towards the fire, where the sparks are leaping and showering in the dusky half-light. ‘Pretty,’ he repeats, seriously, and points to the fire.
The brunette quickly turned around, on all fours, and scooted closer to the edge of the couch where Steve was standing and then sat on his heels, a sharp pain jolting through his body from his wound ass, and he twitched. He quickly forgot when Steve's hand ran through his hair, grabbing a handful of it and tilting his head with some force behind it. "Open your mouth and stick your tongue out.", the blonde over him commanded and Tony blushed and quickly did so. Steve slid his impressive length inside his mouth, making the genius moan as it hit the back of his throat.
But now Steve had to go to another camp for 5 weeks and it was their last evening cuddling inside the truck.
The corner of her mouth tilted slightly upwards, "You can drop the 'Ma'am' for now. I'm Tony by the way. And yes, it's bothering me that the army won't support the medical team as it should."
The taller man's lips curled into a smile, "Good. Knew you'd like that." He removed his hand from the throat and instead he straightened himself again and kneaded the two round cheeks in front of him. So full. So plump and sexy. He really couldn't wait to fuck himself into that, but he was going to take his time with it.
His best friend sighed, "You're not. I really hate to say that, but maybe you should ask to...get back home. You're obviously everything but well."
His better judgement betrayed him, he asked one of the nearby soldiers to hand the papers over to the Sergeant and jogged after Stark. It wasn't as hot anymore since the sun began to disappear and the moon took over.
Steve hesitated and stroked Tony's hip in a surprisingly soft interaction, "Are you feeling good Baby? You need a minute?"
Steve watched Tony examining the bullet wound on the leg, "You're lucky soldier, it didn't hit any important blood vessels.", she looked up at Bucky, "You can go now." He nodded and got out. Tony quickly removed the bullet and stitched the wound up, after that leaving him to rest and going to the back of the tent. Steve couldn't resist and followed her.
As the arrived at camp Steve grabbed one end of the blanket, while Bucky took the other and they hurried inside the medical tent. The put the soldier carefully down onto one of the beds and Tony ran to them, "What happend?", She took a pair of scissors, cutting open the pants. Bucky took over the talking, "He was shot in the leg by a terrorist, Ma'am."
As he arrived at the address his body froze, it was a small beautiful white house, a flag softly waving in the wind, and birds chirping from the trees around it.
"Well, I have to go now, or else the Sergeant will notice I'm missing.", Steve interrupted her thoughts.
Steve shot him a sharp glance, "She is just strong. It's not that easy for a woman in the army with guys like you."
"I do not. I joined the army after my mother died. She was very sick. I had nothing left in the states, so I followed my friend Bucky, and joined. I always wanted to do something good for the people. Making sure they can live safely.", he looked up at the stars too.
Tony came back, throwing the ripped up pair of pants in the trash, "Pfuh, these pants are so old, was I really this skinny?", he turned around to start the jet and Steve's jaw almost dropped.
Tony huffed out air and shivered, his cock hanging heavy between his legs, leaking pre-cum like a champ. He was so gonna feel that for days.
A familiar laugh approached his ears from outside the tent. He quickly shoved his stuff under the bed and jogged outside, looking around like a lost fool, and then he grinned. "Bucky?"
The genius sobbed and moaned, his head spinning and a known heat forming in his abdomen, and he came with a loud shout, clenching around the fat cock inside his ass.
They infiltrated the town, positioning themselves as told and watched out for possible terrorists. Someone from the unit was attacked, screaming for help over the radio. All the soldiers ran to help, they shoot the man who attacked the soldier, but he was bleeding heavily from his leg. Bucky and Steve lifted him up and ran to the vehicle. The got him inside onto a blanket and the unit retreated to save the life of the injured soldier.
Steve leaned down and bit Tony's earlobe, "Listen here you little Slut, I'm gonna show you what happens when you walk around showing your ass around like you do all the time, and you're gonna thank me for it, do you fucking understand?", his big hand softly snaked around the throat of the smaller man.
"Still ignoring orders I see.", another slap, "I. Said. How. Many. Men. Fucked. You. Like. That.", between every word Steve send a really hard slap onto Tony's rear side, the skin there already blushing a deep scarlet red.
Steve swallowed hardly, took a few deep breaths and carefully stepped in the direction of the door. Halfway on the path to the door, it opened from inside and a woman stepped out.
He shook his head slightly, "Sorry Ma'am. You need to sign these papers about the stock of the medical equipment."
He reached down, stroking his cock and it quickly got rock hard again, and Steve rolled the condom over his boner, "Turn around again, gonna fuck your plump ass now."
The genius looked down and frowned, "I just bought them, well. I think I had old clothes laying around somewhere.", he rummaged through a few cabinets and found some clothes, "Ah there it is.", with a fluid motion he pulled out a pair of folded pants and went to the small weapon room at the jet, "Nobody come in and look, I mean it!"
Steve moaned loud, "Shit Baby...", he pulled out, removed the condom and stroked his cock until it spurted cum all over Tony's red ass. He sighed satisfied and watched some of it making it's way down to Tony's hole and he held it open so it would go in.
Another evening Steve was jogging to the truck, excited to see Tony and tell her about the things he learned today during the courses. But she wasn't there. Maybe he was just early, or she had an emergency at the medical tent.
Steve was searching for the tent he was sleeping in, his forehead covered in sweat. He really did underestimate the desert sun, hopefully he would get used to that. Well, he had to, there wasn't really a choice.
"Don't worry, I had a few short relationships, not here tho. I don't know if I could handle the daily risk of losing someone...", she sighed, "It kinda held me back of getting out there again. Searching for luck. I rather threw myself in more work."
"I have feelings for you, okey!?", she rubbed her arm and looked away. That was it. He was going to hate her now.
Or when they trained together and Steve has him pinned down, just holding Tony there with his own superhuman strength and use him on the training mat.
Steve started kissing her neck, making Tony tilt her head backwards and gasping, his hand sliding between her legs, cupping her middle through her pants. "Someone could hear us here.", she whispered.
As he entered the town hall, a young woman noticed his uniform and smiled friendly at him from the counter, "Hi, how may I help you?"
Steve moved near to her, "Work or anxiety should never hold you back from being happy. It's not easy, not at all, but we have to keep going every day. You shouldn't limit yourself.", he held Tony's hand in between his own hands as he spoke.
The genius catches his breath slowly, not able to believe what just happened to him. He would really need to tell Steve to do that more often, instead of giving him boring lectures.
The thought of Tony taking in another cock made Steve furiously and he harshly slapped the ass in front of him, making the man under him groan. "How many did you take like that mh?", he underlined his question with another slap, watching the ass jiggle softly from the force.
The brunette's eyes widened, his hands slightly clawing themselves into the couch, his dick twitching from his teammate's words, "Yes, Captain.", he gasped out.
It goes on like this for two weeks, they met at the truck, talked about their life or what they experienced today. They joked and played cards, sometimes Tony massaged Steve's sore muscles, using that as an excuse to touch him. She hated and loved that feeling. When she was near him, her stomach flipped and tickled, there was just no medical explanation for that. Her skin tingled when he touched her somewhere, which he sometimes did when passing her in the medical tent. And don't even get her started on her dreams. She woke up and needed new underwear. Steve was such a polite guy, she wasn't sure if he would like her like that, too. And maybe he just wanted the same thing all guys do?
Steve dropped her legs for a second and opened his pants, pulling out his hard dick, and Tony's eyes widened. She has seen a lot of penises, but that one was really big. Like, really really big.
He removed her boots and opened her pants, pulling them down with her help and massaged her through her underwear. She moaned softly and bit her lip, spreading her legs a bit more.
"It's pretty- Uhm, so you probably have a girlfriend or wife waiting at home?", Tony quickly looked up into the stars. She usually never said something so stupid. But soldiers liked to brag about their perfect wives and their pretty little children, so probably that was saving her ass now.
"Pregnant? Yes.", she chuckled, "That's why the army send me home from camp 3 weeks after you left...it's...yours."
"Steve...", Tony sobbed and started running towards him, jumping in his arms, he cried out in happiness and they fell together into the grass.
As he left the airport, he got into a taxi. But instead of saying his hometown address, he told the driver he wanted to go to the city hall.
Steve put her legs over his shoulders and lined himself up, teasing her a little with his tip. It made her giggle, "Steve! Do it!" He smiled and slowly slid into her. Tony quickly pressed a hand over her mouth to stop her loud moans, as she rolled her eyes from the intense feeling. He held onto her hip, swallowing his moans as well and carefully thrusted into her, going deeper inside with every thrust. Tony shivered heavily and clawed her free hand into the edge of the table over her head.
The other man nodded, Bucky joined the army 2 years before Steve did, so he knew his way around better than Steve did. They both fell into a comfortable walking speed and Bucky showed his friend the camp.
Steve sighed relieved and he entered Tony with one fluid thrust, making him scream out in pleasure and wiggle around. He groaned and forcefully grabbed the smaller man's hips, holding him in place before starting a fast line of thrusts into the tight hole around his cock.
The soldier sitting onto the chair in the background chuckled, "She is a real feisty one. Hot, but damn crazy."
Bucky tried his lucks with girls, but mostly got a laugh and a punch against his chest. There where really pretty girls, he was right in this point.
When Steve came he held her even closer and whispered soothing things in her hair, since she was worn out.
"37 packs of bandages? Is this supposed to be a joke?!", she stares up at Steve, her eyes could cut someone's throat.
Tony sighed, "Already tried that. Most towns are raided by terrorists." She eyed up the soldier sitting next to her, he was gorgeous. Not just his body, his hair looked soft and his eyes were so blue, it was like the ocean. Tony really missed the ocean, if she would go back and ever leave the army, she would buy a house in front of the ocean. Admiring it everyday.
He removed his fingers, wiping them off on Tony's ass, making the brunette hiss. With a grin he grabbed the condom from inside his sweatpants before pulling them down and tossing them to the side, he didn't bother putting on underwear and he ripped the package open, noticing Tony watching him over his shoulder, "Come here, Baby.", his voice sounded demanding.
The blonde carefully stroked the red ass, watching the muscles underneath twitch involuntary, "See Tony, honesty could've spared you from that. Sadly I can't do anything about you being a big cockslut.", he moved two fingers over the pink hole, receiving a horny whine, "But I might as well enjoy it then.", he carefully entered the hole with one finger, not really surprised how easy he got in, and he started pumping it in and out.
"Wait!", Stark almost shouted, "I am sorry. Don't go...", her face softened, she looked much friendlier and less intimidating now. "You wanna sit?", she patted on the spot next to her.
He watched Tony joining them in the jet, he was exhausted too from flying around the heavy suit and stepped out of it, rubbing his eyes and stretching, his hair strands falling in all directions.
On day 9 Steve was assigned to check on the hurt soldiers in the medical tent and do the counting of the medical equipment. He quietly stalked into the medical tent, not wanting to wake or interrupt anyone, especially not the doctors. But he had to ask for the lead surgeon, someone named T. Stark.
His speech threw her off, she never really saw it like that. Was she really the one limiting herself off of relationships?
Everyone had a goal at this evening. Some were flirting, some were leaving after that. A few people played games or danced to loud chanting and the sound of selfmade drums out of bowls.
"Right, of course." Tony nodded, understanding that. She watched Steve getting up and jumping out of the vehicle, before he was gone she shouted, "Tomorrow here? Same time?" He smiled widely, "You bet!"
He climbed up the watchtower everyday, hoping a vehicle or a helicopter from the other camp would cross their sightlines. But nothing happend, he asked several authorities and soldiers inside his camp if they knew anything about Tony. Nobody could answer his questions.
He gripped her legs and pulled her closer, her wet middle against his hard, still clothed, crotch and started grinding against her. She threw her head back and gasped loudly, "Fuck!"
The blonde stretched out, throwing the condom away and put his pants back on, "You're better getting dressed baby, before everyone on the team can see what a whore you are.", with a grin he whistled a song and left the livingroom, leaving Tony there full of cum, ass bright red and shivering like the mess he is.
Natasha obviously quickly noticed that heavy sexual tension between Steve and Tony and often joked about it, which made both of them flustered and they would denial it.
Steve, still unsure, slowly sat down next to her, "Is something specific bothering you, Ma'am?", he shyly looked at her.
He couldn't stop staring at Tony the following weeks, especially at his backside. It drove him up the wall, even through the goddamn roof. Sometimes after dinner when he did the dishes with Tony, that magnificent ass was right in front of him. He wished he could just grab the little genius by the hips and fuck him over the counter, holding his mouth close so their teammates wouldn't hear him moaning from having his ass pounded.
If he put too much pressure on her, it was his own fault. He probably made her feel uncomfortable at one point and didn't notice it, what a dumbass he was.
The most beautiful woman he ever did see was taking notes on a clipboard. Her face had shape, but pretty features. Her brown her was tied into the usual bun, but her hair looked so perfect in it.
"That's it Baby...", Steve petted the brunette's cheek and held his head right there, not allowing him to breathe, spit trickling down his chin.
Steve put his hands on her hip and lifted her up onto the examining table behind them, standing in between her thighs. She grasped onto him as if he was dear life itself.
16 weeks later, Steve and the rest of his unti were still at the other camp. He was a mess, they haven't heard from the other camp in 3 weeks.
People clapped for him or nodded respectfully when he walked pass them. They saw a hero in him. Some asked for photos, but Steve friendly declined.
"There is an old address here, I'm not sure if she is still there. I will print it out for you.", the secretary gave him the printed piece of paper and smiled, "Good luck."
He blushed softly and kissed her again, then continued his kisses along her jawline while whispering, "You think you can take it?"
"...And that's about it. Tonight we're having something like a party, just without loud music and alcohol. You should come!"
She whined and arched her back during it, left some deep scratches on Steve's arm. He let her, and stopped for a few brief moments to give her room to breath and calm down.
About 3 more months passed, Steve's mind became blunt. Everything good his life offered was gone, he was exhausted and depressed. His unit noticed long ago, they mostly left him alone, scared he would beat them up.
She signed the papers quickly, pushed them practically into Steves arms and stomped out of the medical tent. Steve was stunned. That was some strong personality he just met.
The blonde stopped and roared, "Stop pleasuring yourself. You're gonna come from just your ass being fucked.", he made a few particularly hard thrusts to undermine his argument.
Steve looked sadly at the rifle in front of him, Bucky, who sat next to him in the vehicle, patted his shoulder in a comforting manner.
The smaller one screamed out and his entire body jolted away from the slap, "Eight! It was eight! Oh god please please stop! I'm sorry, so so sorry!", he sniffled and put his head down between his hands, which were clawed into the couch.
It was just know Steve noticed a big bump pushing against his abdomen, he carefully placed a hand on Tony's stomach, his eyes wide, "You're..."
"Hey, how about ordering asian food to the tower?", Tony looked into the round, "I'm willing to pay because Steve hasn't given me a hard time today."
As he crossed the middle of the camp he saw the Surgeon again, Stark was her name right? She was demanding to speak to the Major to one of the soldiers in front of the small wooden hut. They sighed and let her in.
He grabbed Tony's ankles and pulled him backwards, nearer to him. The genius squealed loudly and dropped his tablet, "What the fuck Rogers?!", in instinct he kicked back and hit Steve's upper leg, as he pushed his body up with his arms. The kick didn't startle the soldier as he pushed down Tony's pants and his underwear in one swift motion, the smaller man blushing furiously at the exposure, "What the fucking hell is wrong with you-Ah fuck!", he moaned as Steve send a sharp slap onto his plump ass.
Steve huffed out a laugh, "Should've known you have a Daddy kink, fucking Slut." He pushed his hips flush against Tony's ass and stayed there for a few second before pulling back and starting another fast pace, the sound of their skin slapping echoing through the livingroom.
"You better be quite then.", he breathed in her ear, making her shiver. God, that was so hot. She felt like in college again, but more sexy.
He tried different angles and paces until he has found the one to make Tony scream and moan, because he grazed that oh so sweet spot.
He sighed softly, "Tony-...Anthonia Stark.", he nervously tapped his fingers on the counter and bit his lip.
Steve chuckled slightly, "You know I don't like partys or big crowds, I will sit on my bed and scribble something in my book."
She snorted and grinned, "I wish. I was a orphan, my parents died in a car accident. I worked hard and studied even harder to become a surgeon. Joining the army was kinda a gut decision. And now that has been my whole live."
Steve got bored quickly, he small talked to a few of the other soldiers, but nothing really kept him there so he went to bed.
Tony stops only when she’s safe in the workshop, door locked. She stands, shivering a little and trying not to sniffle like a stupid child, as the bots disarm her, gently peeling off the defensive plates piece by piece. When it’s all gone, every last bit, she slumps at the workbench and puts her head in her hands, rubbing savagely, yanking at her own hair.
with it, this thing Steve does, when her eyes go so deep and earnest and she says these awful and wonderful things that rip Tony apart and make her whole, all at the same time. ‘Steve,’ she says helplessly, ‘Steve-’ and Steve kisses her softly on the corner of her mouth.
Steve finally sets his own bowl aside, and carefully lifts the cooking container away from the fire. He pokes at the fire, scraping at the piles of ash around the edge until it’s arranged to his liking, Tony sleepily looking on.
. He carefully packs up all his books. There's his Darcy robot picture, finished now, which he tears carefully out and gives to her.
Everyone stops what they’re doing and turns round to look. Ms Potts comes marching over. ‘Steve,’ she says sternly, ‘Is that true?’ She puts her hand on Tony’s shoulder, and he’s so ashamed of being a stupid crybaby, but it feels kind of good, warm and comforting.
Steve and Tony are the last ones out of the room, and Tony looks up to see Steve smiling at her, a little crookedly. Then Steve reaches out to her, and for one wild breathless moment Tony thinks Steve's going to touch her face, cup it in her palm. But then Steve just drops her hand onto Tony's shoulder, her thumb rubbing softly across the clavicle of her neck. ‘Good night, Tony,’ she says quietly, and goes.
Tony wakes at some horrible, dark, pre-dawn hour of the morning to JARVIS playing an urgent wake-up signal, bip-bip-bip-bip-bip. She makes a piteous, betrayed whimper and crawls under her pillow.
'Have a shower,' Steve says. 'I'll wait for you, hey? Get you downstairs, have something to eat. I've made cookies, the cinnamon ones you like. Then you can go to bed.'
. Tony can’t stop looking at them, at the way they quiver slightly with each tiny breath Steve takes.
I'm really sorry if I take a long time to reply to your comment. I have read and loved every one, thank you so, SO much, and I
Steve pulls back obligingly; her eyes are starting to look heavy, and shitshitshit, isn’t sleepiness a sign of concussion? ‘JARVIS, med-scan, now,’ Tony says sharply.
thank you personally as soon as I can. But, ugh, my life is incredibly busy and scary and stressful sometimes, and, well, sometimes I can't keep up as well as I'd like to. I love all of you. *opens arms really wide for a big group hug* <3
Tony nudges his backpack under the table and opens his Numbers book to the back page. Then he picks out his sharpest pencil, and starts drawing his own robot.
So, I’m a little torn. This is definitely not the end of Tony’s story – I have a whole plan involving Peggy and Howard and Tony’s parents becoming a little more aware of the fact that they have an actual, sensitive, baby child who needs, y’know, love and affection – but I kind of feel like it should be its own fic. It will pick up where this one leaves off, just after the birthday, and still mostly be told from Tony’s point of view, but every so often there will be an adult perspective scene where Tony’s not present. Also, the birthday party feels like a good breaking point, and it’s a nice twelve-thousand-ish word count.
Steve lifts her easily onto the bed, turning back the covers and laying Tony back against the pillows; she rests a reassuring hand on the soft roundness of Tony’s tummy, rubbing, as she gets something out of the drawer. Tony blinks sleepily, her cheek resting on her hand and her body curling towards Steve’s, and Steve smiles softly.
Tony is breathing fast, shuddering a little under Steve’s hands, and when Steve finally relents and circles her thumbs around Tony’s rosy little nipples, she makes a small lovely sound of relief, arching up against the touch, her hands clutching at her stomach where Steve had placed them. Steve keeps the touch light and petting, circling the nubs with her fingertips, loving the way that Tony writhes and pants. ‘That’s right, my beautiful girl,’ she praises, ‘that’s it, you’re doing so well, keeping your hands there for me. Does it feel good?’
Steve looks happier suddenly, his neck going straight. ‘Yep,’ he says sturdily, and Tony breathes out in relief. He always feels braver when Steve’s with him.
The days pass, moon following sun and back again, and Tony rests and sleeps and eats, the sick fever-tiredness slowly seeping out of his body. Steve tends the wound in his chest and brings him food and cares for him, and at night he curls up around Tony and cuddles him, close and warm. Steve is
‘Of course, your father will be interstate, so you and I will just have our usual dinner, but this will be in the afternoon,’ Mom’s saying as she cuts her toast into dainty fingers, but Tony hardly hears.
UM. So. I'm aware that it's been fully three years, and probably no-one is really following this story anymore because I've been so inactive, but I recently got back into writing fic for another fandom and was going through my old WIPS and found that I already had 2000 words of this chapter written. It seemed a waste not to finish and post it, so I did.
I like you best,’ he says quietly, and his eyes are big and soft again and his eyelashes are long and curly and still damp with tears. He gives Steve’s shoulder a soft little pat, and Steve sighs out in wobbly relief. He gives Tony a tentative smile, and Tony sniffles happily and squeezes Steve’s hand.
Then she reaches down between Tony’s parted thighs. It’s swift enough that Tony doesn’t anticipate the gentle press of Steve’s fingertips against the soft mound of her centre. Light as the touch is, it’s electric; Tony stiffens and arches in Steve’s arms, her hands slipping on Steve’s shoulders, pressing frantically up against the touch.
so much, feel every little quiver Steve makes beneath her, feel the soft-strong rise and fall of Steve's chest. Steve's hands are underneath her T-shirt again, gently caressing the dip at the small of Tony's back, and she wants

, he’s too happy, so he slips out of his chair and scampers to the other end of the table and gives Mom a light shy kiss on her cheek, ducking his head. ‘Oh!’ she says, surprised and faintly pleased, and pats his cheek with soft fingers. ‘Oh, Tony. Such a sweet child.’
Something touches Tony’s arm, but he snuffles and hunches his shoulders and keeps his arms tightly circled around his face. He hopes they go away and leave him alone.
Steve pulls them both over to the couch, launches them almost roughly into it, pulls Tony firmly into her chest as she cries, enclosed in the circle of Steve’s arms. Steve pets Tony’s hair, cuddles her close, whispers endearments, rocks her. Steve is – fierce, in her protection, she feels like fire and warmth and safety and stone; and Tony cries into her shirt, messy and wet and entirely unattractive, while Steve murmurs softly against her hair, gentle hushing nonsense, rubbing Tony's back.
nice, Tony thinks, the best thing ever. Steve’s chin is hooked over Tony’s head, her cheek rubbing softly back and forth in Tony’s hair, her hands on Tony’s back, snuggling her close. It feels really weirdly
She clenches down involuntarily, feeling the stone shift inside her. ‘That’s it, darling,’ Steve murmurs, lips brushing her ear, and then her fingers dip lower, sliding against slick oversensitive nerve endings and between her folds and dipping inside her, chasing the heavy weight of the egg and moving gently inside her until Tony whimpers helplessly, shaking all over.
When she calms, it’s floaty and warm again. She drifts and drifts, drowsing in and out of sleep, Steve’s arms holding her safely. At one point Steve is kissing her, very soft and slow, sucking Tony’s bottom lip between her own; Tony kisses back a little, but she’s so sleepy with it that Steve makes a little amused sound into her mouth.
His hand is splayed warmly across Tony’s shoulder, and his thumb starts moving in slow soothing circles over Tony’s skin. ‘Shh,’ Steve says in a soft voice, and Tony is suddenly overcome by how
Tony huffs, sprawling down onto the sofa in defeat, because she’s not stupid enough to try fighting Natasha for it. ‘That’s just, that’s just cheating, it
’ he says, ‘c’mon, tape,’ and Tony blinks. He’s resting his head against Darcy’s shoulder so she can pet his hair, and Steve’s sitting cross-legged next to him holding a toilet roll in place for Tony to sticky-tape. Steve keeps looking suspiciously at Darcy, but at least they’re not yelling.
He tumbles out of bed and scampers over to the window to look at the sky. It’s bright and beautiful and blue and it’s his
‘Goodnight, my bambino,’ she says softly, and bends down and kisses his forehead. And Tony sighs with happiness and lets his eyes droop closed; and he sleeps, and dreams about birthday cake and flower crowns and biplanes and
,’ Steve says belligerently to Tasha, and he flops quickly on top of Tony’s back, squeezing his arms round him before Tasha can get there. Tony squirms in delight and twists round so he can hug Steve back, cuddling into Steve’s bony shoulder.
‘It’s okay, sweetheart,’ Maggie says. She’s sitting on the ground too, not trying to rush him along, just unscrewing the cap from a water bottle. ‘Do you want a sip of water?’ She doesn’t try to push it into his hands, just sets it down on the ground where Tony can reach it.
Clint reaches even further over, so that Tony’s nearly scared he’s going to fall right off, and points at a flat bit near the top of Tony’s building. ‘Whassat?’
‘I’m six!’ Tony whispers. ‘I’m six, I’m six!’ He reaches up and lifts Old-Bear carefully down from the shelf, and wraps his arms carefully around him and presses his face into Old-Bear’s threadbare tatty fur. He smells old and safe, and Tony breathes in a deep breath and hugs Old-Bear gently, and makes a secret, secret birthday wish.
, anything Steve wanted. But Steve’s smile is sweet, and when she bends to cover Tony’s lips with her own, it’s gentle and chaste.
Steve’s big hands are very gentle. He cleans the wound with warm water, and Tony flinches and squeezes his eyes shut as it throbs and stings. Steve strokes his hair comfortingly.
of her, and Steve’s going to take her on a date, too. A real proper date, with dinner and maybe holding hands, and…
‘You made it,’ Steve says softly. ‘For me.’ He’s still looking at Tony, and there’s a smile starting behind his eyes, bright and tender, spreading across his face. He puts the knife carefully on the skins, and then reaches his hand up to slip over the back of Tony’s neck, cupping it. He draws their heads together until their foreheads touch, and Tony closes his eyes, basking in the closeness. He feels very warm, very aware of the places where Steve’s skin is touching his; of Steve’s arm around his body, the way Steve’s hand is low on his waist.
Steve makes a small surprised sound, which turns into a quiet rumble in his chest. Tony can feel it all the way through him, and then Steve wraps his arms around Tony’s smaller body and it feels like he’s surrounded by Steve’s warmth and scent on all sides.
and calm, like she’s pledging an oath or something, and Rhodey is meeting Steve’s eyes with a long steady look over the top of Tony’s head. Steve’s arms are very gentle around Tony’s body, and her hands are curled around her waist and chest, one thumb stroking tiny unobtrusive circles against the underside of Tony’s breast.
It’s a game they play, the different words. Tony will point to something and say, ‘This?’ and Steve will tell him his word for it. And Tony will give Steve his own word for the thing, sometimes, and he never forgets any of Steve’s words, so after a while they can understand each other a little.
He hears Tony make a tiny, wounded, hitching noise in his throat, but he doesn’t fricken care, Tony can fricken stay and watch fricken
‘It would be my honour,’ he says gallantly. ‘Who is your friend?’ He has a different way of talking, slow and clear, not at all like the other big kids.
Tony flips his Numbers book open to the back, where he does most of his best robot drawings, because it has criss-cross lines. He’s working on an extra special one at the moment, a robot armour man like the one on the board but even bigger and cooler. The helmet would look great if it was gold.
‘People shouldn’t poke anyone’s bottoms except their own ones,’ Tony explains, thinking it through. ‘Yeah. ‘Cause you don’t have
She sips her chocolate, her eyes heavy, and after a bit Steve starts talking in a soft voice, telling her a story about cookies and growing up and something about a spanner that Tony doesn't quite catch. Tony's drifting, drifting, Steve's voice washing over her in quiet comforting waves, and she drifts all the way into soft sleep with the sensation of Steve's fingers stroking little circles into the thin skin on the underside of her wrist.
, warm and soft and tender, legs entangled, breast to breast, Steve whispering quiet hushing nonsense into Tony’s hair.
Then Darcy bounces on her feet and says ‘Come look!’ and pulls Maggie over to the long shelf at the back of the room, where the plane is sitting. Tony and Steve trail along behind, Steve still firmly holding Tony’s hand.
Steve is unpacking his bag, putting his things on his desk. Tony stands there uncertainly, suddenly feeling a horrible churning feeling in his tummy again. What if – what if Steve doesn’t want him there? But then Steve’s mom looks up and sees him standing there, shifting his weight from foot to foot, and her expression goes soft and she smiles at him.
Tony blushes, looking down at the ground and feeling warm and pleased and excited. Steve thinks he’s good at stuff! He squeezes Steve’s hand to say thank you.
Steve mouths at Tony’s lip for a moment more, enjoying the way it trembles, but then pulls away. ‘Ready?’ she says, and Tony nods, her eyes big and dark as she watches Steve’s hands strip Tony’s t-shirt up and over her head, her fingers glancing over Tony’s sides.
Tony moans softly and crawls under the pillow. Steve’s pillow. Steve's pillow, which smells like Steve. God.
‘Mummy ‘n’ Mamá are gonna take me t’the Pirate Park after school!’ Darcy chatters. ‘We’re gonna have a
‘I got it, Mom,’ another voice replies, a kid’s voice, firm and sure of itself, and Tony turns round to see who it belongs to.
Tony’s need is like a fire banked beneath her skin, the light touches enough to bring it crackling to the surface again; she chokes and jolts, her body writhing helplessly towards the touch, but Steve holds her still so that she can spread her open. Then suddenly there’s something cold – so cold! – and Tony clutches at the sheets, panting, as Steve gently, gently slips it inside her body, one warm finger following to ease it further in. Tony clenches involuntarily around Steve’s finger, but Steve just strokes her belly again and draws her finger slowly out. ‘Like it?’ she asks.
‘No,’ he whines, and Steve sighs and rubs his chin. Then he shifts forward and puts his hand on Tony’s shoulder, careful but firm, guiding him backwards against the skins. Tony doesn’t want to, but Steve is very strong and very determined, and Tony feels weak and wobbly anyway so he stops resisting, letting himself rest back onto the skins. Steve crinkles his eyes, pleased with him.
Of course, no-one realises that Tony's been having an epiphany there in the corner of the bloody kitchen, so the world doesn't actually stop turning or anything. Things simply run their course as they usually would: the Chinese team (Steve, Bucky, Natasha and Tony herself) win the food dispute, and Natasha phones it in, looking both smug and slightly threatening as Bruce and Clint subside in defeat.
Tony’s whining, her knees giving out, but Steve rises back to her feet and catches her, making little hushing sounds. ‘It’s okay,’ she murmurs, ‘it’s okay, darling. Just one more thing, then we’ll button you up again, all safe.’ She strokes the nape of Tony’s neck with her fingertips, slow and deliciously soothing, and Tony turns her face and snuggles it into the swell of Steve’s warm naked breast, the nub of Steve’s nipple trailing across her lips.
Tony wakes, or half-wakes at least, to strong arms shifting her, hooking carefully under her knees and scooping her up to carry her against the soft pillow of someone's chest. Steve –
Steve leans right over the back of his chair and glares at Natasha. 'Yeah, don't poke Tony's bottom!' he says, angrily. 'I'll - I'll...'
, Steve and Darcy. Not fighting, he doesn’t like them fighting, it’s too loud and too scary and reminds him of sometimes when Dad comes home angry and yells and yells.
Tony flips through his Drawing book to find the plane picture. He turns round when he finds it. ‘Look!’
He looks warily around to see where Steve is. Steve’s got his head in the craft box, rummaging around. He won’t notice if Tony just tries it a tiny bit.
Tony is quiet and good, holding herself still while Steve eases the lacy little pants down and off. The triangle between her legs is thatched with soft dark curls that Steve loves to pet and play with; she laces her fingers through them, circling but never reaching the sweet spot where Tony is aching to be touched.
‘Said YES, SAID YES!’ Darcy squawks, letting go of Tony’s hand and spinning in a circle, hugging herself. Tasha fist pumps, and Clint carefully copies her, and Jane claps her hands.
Steve’s arm goes tighter around his back, and then Steve wraps both arms around Tony and tells Darcy sternly, ‘No licking Tony.’
Note: In relation to some issues that come up in this chapter, I want to underline something. Steve’s mom is a single parent who has to work long hours at odd times to support him. This is a very different situation to Tony’s emotionally neglectful, absentee parents, even though at one point Tony makes a comparison between them. Just wanted to point that out!
He twists his head up to look at Steve, and – and the light is glimmering on Steve’s face, off Steve’s eyelashes, and Tony thinks he knows what ‘pretty’ means, now. He reaches up to shyly touch Steve’s chin, and says, ‘Pretty Steve,’ and Steve opens his eyes wide and looks down with a surprised face. Tony face feels suddenly hot, even in the cooling evening air, and it seems like Steve’s neck is a good place to hide it. He buries his face in Steve’s warm skin.
Also, Tony is a total excited child when it comes to Christmas. ;) I have a vague headcanon about this, involving Tony's childhood and the Avengers and Iron Woman's little baby kid fans, but that's a story for a different day.
‘I –’ Steve gets out, and then snuffles and sort of quivers and tries again. ‘Tony, I – m’sorry… don’t know what – woke you. Last thing I wanted was to bother you,
Old-Bear looks at him with his tired kind black eyes, and Tony hugs him and pretends that Old-Bear says, ‘I love you.’
Tony swallows. Yeah, she’s done this before, lots of times. Cleaned and patched up her own injuries from horrible self-loathing drunken benders, scrapes and grazes and gouges methodically cleaned and patched over so that no-one will see the damage. There’s no way in
Tony nods reluctantly, watching as Steve goes to pull on underwear and a soft t-shirt. It doesn’t take long, and then Steve’s climbing in next to her, drawing Tony into her arms and settling her against her chest. Tony snuggles happily, nosing at Steve’s neck, and oh! Steve’s thigh is between her legs, and if she moves a little it feels so good.
‘I dream about – water, too,’ Steve whispers. ‘I’m flying, and then I’m crashing, and then – there’s water. So much water, and it’s – so
And then – oh God, and then Steve’s, Steve’s tipping her chin with fingers so gentle that Tony wants to cry, and she can’t – she can’t
When they get to the picnic grounds, the first thing Tony sees is balloons. Floaty red and gold balloons, tied on long strings to weights on the four corners of a big picnic blanket. There’s people there already – lots of people, it seems like, and as Tony slips out of the car, something goes watery and terrified in his stomach, and he feels suddenly, frighteningly, like crying. He can’t – he doesn’t know them… what if they hate him? What if they – what if they…?
‘What?’ Steve’s looking at her, a deep wrinkle between her brows. ‘Yes, I – I left you a letter, but…’ Then her face changes, stricken. ‘It was too fast, wasn’t it? Oh, Tony, I’m sorry. I thought – I mean, after last night, it seemed like. Well.’ She clears her throat, her cheeks pinkening.
’ he says joyfully, ‘yes, please Mom, I wanna go. Want to go,’ he corrects quickly, because Mom and Dad like him to speak clearly.
The other bear is very old. It belonged to Tony’s Dad, when he was little, which makes Tony feel funny, because he can’t imagine Dad ever being little and playing with bears and toys and things. Old-Bear is a little bit threadbare at the edges, and sits on the shelf usually, watching the room with a kind, tired face. Tony doesn’t think he’s supposed to really play with Old-Bear, so he just leaves him on the shelf mostly and talks to him sometimes, in his head.
But today he has something particular to ask Mr Karolidis, something he wants to do to say sorry to Tony for being mean and making him cry. He waits until he’s sitting at the table holding his glass of milk. (Mr Karolidis is very big on feeding Steve milk. He says it will help Steve to grow up big and strong, and Steve’s still faintly hoping he’s right.)
Natasha Romanoff is the girl who sits behind him. Her best friend is called Clint Barton and he sits next to her. She likes guns and he likes bows and arrows, and Tony’s a little afraid of both of them but he tries not to show it. Sometimes Natasha pokes Tony’s bottom with her ruler, when the teacher’s not watching, which is rude.
When the bell goes, Thor catches them both and slows the swings to a stop. Tony's legs feel funny and wobbly when he tries to stand, but Thor puts a big hand on each of their shoulders, safe and steadying. Darcy flails round and flings her arms round Thor's neck and says, 'Thankyouthankyouthankyou!'
Right. Right, first aid, that’s all good, Tony can do that at least. She darts over to the bathroom, already pulling out the first aid kit as Steve tells her where to find it. Steve’s feeling at her broken temple with her uninjured hand when Tony comes back, and Tony pushes her hand away. ‘No, hey, don’t, don’t touch it, come on, that’s the sort of thing
Mr Karolidis looks at him sharply from under his bushy, bushy eyebrows. ‘Ah, a cupcake!’ he says. ‘A cupcake, hm.’ He has a pink flowery tea towel over his shoulder. Steve watches him levelly, and Mr Karolidis watches right back with a little quirk forming at the leathery corner of his mouth. ‘For a special girlfriend, maybe?’ he adds inquisitively, and Steve feels suddenly hot all over, hot and worried and defensive.
‘Stoppit,’ Darcy pokes Natasha in her tummy, which Tony thinks is a very brave thing to do. ‘Don’t be mean to Tony. He’s my
Steve’s quiet laughter vibrates against Tony’s back, and Tony leans back and turns his head so he can grin brightly up at him. ‘
But there is a stupid, stupid reason why Steve doesn’t usually play ball. Because Steve gets asthma. Steve gets really bad, bad,
‘Bye Mom,’ the girl says. She passes Tony on her way to the door, and he sees that she’s got freckles all over too, but they’re paler than her mom’s.
Tony comes gradually awake to bright mid-morning sun shafting through the curtains, feeling stiff and sore and achy, but surprisingly well-rested. She whimpers in her throat as the sunlight hits her eyes, burrowing down under layers of dark blue cotton and striped covers.
Then Steve collapses back onto the couch, all lovely pink-flushed cheeks and parted lips and heavy eyelids, and pulls Tony down against her chest and wraps her arms around her so they
Steve just tells them to shut up again, and they listen to her because, well, she’s Steve and she uses
‘Okay, okay, talking, right, I can do that, anything you need me to do, God, that’s weird, mostly everyone can’t wait till I shut up, but yeah, whatever, God, Steve, I’m sorry, I’ve got you, not going anywhere,’ she blurts out, and incredibly, the tension is slowly draining out of Steve’s body as Tony holds her.
‘What do you want, Tony?’ Steve murmurs into her ear, and Tony gulps and burrows her head down. Steve waits patiently, smoothing her thumb into the little strip of skin showing between Tony’s shirt and panties, feeling her body quiver.
‘Sorry,’ Steve says again, quietly. His throat feels raw and his chest aches. But he has to tell Tony something, and he closes his eyes and doesn’t look at him. ‘I – I don’t care if y’like – Pepper Potts better. It’s okay.’ There. He said it.
– and Tony cries out, breathless, as Steve’s fingers are finally on her, slipping through the opening in the fur, warm and strong and rubbing firmly right at her centre.
‘These are for you,’ Steve says, looking down at the flowers, and, are her cheeks pinking up a little bit? ‘I wanted to bring them. Because of this morning.’ She raises her eyelashes and gives Tony one of those breathtaking looks, steady and sweet.
But Darcy’s bear is soft and cuddly and meant to be played with, just like Darcy’s doing now while Ms Potts reads them a story about a princess and a tree that grows balloons. Darcy strokes all the soft fur one way, and then smooths it all back. She straightens the bright pink bow around its neck. Then she holds the bear by its arms and makes it walk along the ground to Tony.
Tony twists his fingers together and glances shyly up at Thor. He wants desperately to say thank you as well, but his mouth is too scared, it just sort of opens and closes without saying anything.
, letting herself think that everything was lovely and good and might stay that way. Tony grits her teeth and squeezes her eyes shut to hold the tears back. It’s not Steve’s fault, of course, she can’t blame Steve. The letter will be kind, of course, very gentle, but it will say that Steve is so very sorry, she’s had time to think things through and she’s realised it could never work. It might say ‘It’s not you, it’s me,’ but Tony knows what that means really.
Steve gives him a careful grin back. ‘I’ll carry your bag,’ he tells Tony with a firm nod, picking it up, and Tony blushes.
‘Let’s get you into that bath, sweetheart,’ Steve finally says, smoothing a damp curl away from Tony’s forehead and smiling softly down at her. Tony draws in a long shaking breath and nods, curling artlessly into Steve’s body to be picked up. Steve lifts her easily, setting her on her feet; Tony is wobbly, but Steve steadies her.
‘Sir, I believe you may be mistaken as to the nature…’ JARVIS is saying, urgently, but Tony isn’t listening.
‘Just – just leave me alone, o-okay?’ Tony says, and the modulator isn’t enough to disguise the shake in her voice. Steve makes a sharp sort of sound and steps quickly forward; Tony recoils.
She takes off, ignoring the surprised voices of the others, and swoops back in the direction of the tower. She just catches Steve’s voice, shocked, surprised, saying ‘Tony? Are you alr-’ and then switches off the comms, shutting it all out.
,’ Steve says companionably, and then he pushes his red and blue pencil case across the table. ‘You should share my colours.’
She releases Tony’s hand and cups her mound lightly through the fabric, feeling it twitch and throb beneath the gentle touch. Tony’s fingers curl desperately for a moment, but then she whimpers in surrender and curls her arms around Steve’s neck again, burying her face in Steve’s skin and breathing shakily through it. ‘Colour?’ Steve checks after a moment, just to be sure.
‘Well, we’re both frien’s with Tony, right?’ Darcy says. ‘An’ Tony got sad ‘cause we were fighting. So we gotta be a bit friends or Tony will be sad again.’
Tony looks shyly up at her, and she’s smiling, looking lovely and soft and kind. ‘Happy birthday, sweetheart,’ she says gently, and puts her hand on his shoulder with a little squeeze. Tony basks in it, leaning happily into the touch, and her face goes even softer.
Steve says, ‘Can I,’ and reaches out to curl her arm around Tony, tugging her in to fit in the crook of Steve’s shoulder. Tony snuggles slightly, and she sort of feels like a kitten or something, with Steve being all touchy-feely like this, but she’s too warm and comfortable to complain.
Steve’s eyes are so soft and bright, and her smile’s so lovely that it makes Tony’s own mouth want to tip up into a smile, too. She looks up at Steve through her eyelashes. ‘Hey Steve!’ she says, ‘do you want, you should try the punch, Darcy and Thor brought it, it’s really…’
‘Pepper’s so awesome, don’t you think?’ Tony says dreamily, and Steve feels like something’s tearing and ripping inside his chest. Tony – Tony’s
and strong enough to fight off anyone who tried to hurt Tony, and he doesn’t want Steve to ever go anywhere again.
When they do Numbers, Tony finishes his really fast, because Numbers are easy peasy. He wants to draw a picture for Darcy, so he gets a big piece of white paper from the paper box and spreads it carefully out on the desk.
Darcy sits down next to Tony on the bench and puts her arms around him. ‘Don’t cry, don’t cry,’ she says softly, ‘Tony Tony, don’t cry please.’ She pats him gently and glares at Steve over the top of his head.
To be continued! Next chapter will contain the title reference and introduce some of the other kid!Avengers. It’s already written and I’ll post it soon.
In a minute Steve’s back in the workshop, good as her word, and Tony risks a glance up at her through her eyelashes. Steve’s got a small pile of clothes and things under her arm; and she slips her free arm around Tony. ‘Come on,’ she says, ‘up with you. Brought you some things to change into, figured it’d be easier if you didn’t have to fetch them yourself. You look kinda awful, don’t want you flaking out.’
She swallows hard, and there’s a lovely warm feeling inside her that she’s trying very hard not to acknowledge. It’s just a figure of speech, of course, a simple expression, it’s not that Steve, you know,
one, and he likes it better than all of them. It fits into the palm of his hand, and it’s small, like him. Tony can’t stop smiling and smiling, and he says thank you three times, and Phil smiles back at him with crinkles around his eyes and helps him wrap it in a serviette to take home.
Maggie chuckles, and Tony realises he’s been asking too many questions, and that’s rude. ‘Sorry,’ he whispers, but Maggie’s shaking her head, softly squeezing his shoulder.
There’s a big warm spot growing right in the middle of Tony’s chest, and he feels a smile start, beginning on the inside of him and then reaching his mouth and curling the edges up, up up. He starts smiling, and he can’t stop smiling and smiling and
Steve is stripping the flesh from the underside of his new hide, using a faceted flint knife. Tony nestles into Steve’s warmth, watching the sunlight glint off the dark shining surfaces of the tool.
,' Tony says, and she's not thinking, she just drops down on her knees next to Steve on the floor because God,
‘Anything you need, honey?’ she asks gently. She knows, she always knows, but it has to be Tony who starts this, Tony who asks.
She limps out, and then Steve’s there again, smiling a little at the too-big clothes. And Steve just makes everything easy; she just says ‘Come on,’ and drags Tony out to the kitchen and pushes her gently into a seat while she makes her a big mug of chocolate with marshmallows. There’s still the little voice in Tony’s head saying she should protest about it, about all the fussing, should get herself together and look after herself. But she’s just so – so
Clint nods slowly. ‘Cool,’ he says in a small voice. Then he looks down at his hands and asks quietly, ‘Me too?’
‘Thank you, Tony,’ Steve says after a bit. Her voice is quiet. ‘I mean – for all of this. For coming over. Everything. Patching me up. You’re – pretty great, you know that?’
When Steve’s gone, Tony sits down very quickly, because her legs just seem to wobble and give way. She can’t think about anything straight. All Steve had done was touch her bare shoulders, what the hell is even happening here, it doesn’t make sense, shoulders!
‘Do not finish that sentence,’ Steve tells her firmly, dropping her hand, and Tony sighs and leans her head on Steve’s arm.
She skims her thumbs lightly across the nubs of Tony’s breasts; Tony’s mouth goes soft and parted with pleasure, and Steve leans forward and gently catches Tony’s bottom lip between her own, stroking her nipples again through the soft cotton as she does. Tony whimpers, this time, her breaths going shaky, but she manages to keep her arms up as she was told.
s–’ Tony starts to say, triumphant, but then a large warm hand comes over her mouth and she squawks indignantly.
And then Steve meets her eyes across the table, still laughing, and it hits Tony like a bolt of electricity or something, straight into the core of her, because
Something’s sticky, where Steve’s temple is pressed against her cheek. Tony brings up a searching hand, not thinking, then jerks it away when Steve flinches, realising that the stickiness is partly-dried blood. ‘Shit, sorry, sorry!’ she says quickly. God, she’s so awful at this caring thing, she hasn’t even checked Steve for injuries; and worry stabs sharply at her gut. ‘Can I look?’
Luckily Bucky’s around, because he and Clint are literally glued together these days, and he bear-wrestle-hugs Clint into a better mood, and then they lounge around and eat chips and pass tools for Tony as she fixes the microwave.
After a minute, Steve’s hands smooth down Tony’s arms and fall away. Her pupils are huge and dark and dilated, Tony notices hazily, and her lips are parted slightly; they’re so
Once he looks up, and catches Steve watching him with amusement, and that’s not good, no! Steve mustn’t laugh at him, and Steve mustn’t see what he’s making. Tony play-growls at him, and Steve chuckles; Tony flaps his hand at him, stay away.
at lunchtime, and it’s all his fault, and he wishes they would stop and there’s a hot feeling behind his eyes like he’s going to cry.
, even though the temperature down here should be just right, why is she cold, and now she has blood going everywhere and she needs to clean herself up and she just can’t, she
Tony opens her mouth, closes it again, repeats, because everything that crosses her mind to say seems worse than the last. She wishes
‘What’s that song?’ Tony murmurs, and kisses Steve’s collarbone, because it’s there and it’s sweet and silky and she’s wanted to put her lips against it for
, and the kiss turns into Tony burrowing into Steve’s chest, resting her face in the delicious soft spot in the centre, breathing in Steve’s warm scent and trying very hard not to hyperventilate.
, let her in then, we’ll do it,’ and something inside of her is cringing, flinching, because getting a breakup letter is one thing – when she actually gets to reading it – but talking, talking
‘Please, please, please,’ Tony begs. Steve laughs softly when she does that, and holds her close, rubbing Tony’s tummy soothingly.
Steve ducks back in through the entrance with an armful of branches and a rush of cool air, and Tony grins up at him, eager. ‘Steve!’ he says, ‘Steve, look – ’ and he wriggles over towards Steve.
' Steve rasps, and she slams forward and Tony grabs her and then Steve's face is mashed into her chest, Steve's whole body trembling against her. Tony wraps her arms tightly around Steve's shoulders, as tightly as she can, and then Steve's trembling turns into shaking and then, shitshitshit, Steve is crying, deep slow wracking sobs into Tony's chest, as though she's trying her hardest to stop but just
‘Okay, kids.’ Natasha’s leaning slinkily back in her armchair, flicking her eyes to the ceiling, smirking almost unnoticeably. ‘Time and place. No snogging in communal areas. Calm it down.’
It's a mess. There's an upturned chair with a missing leg, a big gaping fist-sized smash in the wall. Broken glass spreading out across the floor, mingled with bruised iris stalks and crushed flowers: a smashed vase. The water has splashed all up the wall. The bedcovers and sheets are wildly strewn, half trailed off the bed, and Steve herself is kind of pitifully tangled up in them, curled up in a ball on the floor.
The week is the slowest ever. Tony keeps looking over to see whether Steve is talking to Jane. ‘What if he likes her better?’ he asks Darcy miserably. ‘She’s really pretty.’
‘Do you wanna hold him?’ she whispers, and Tony looks at her, wide-eyed. Is Darcy really – is she really going to let him hold her special bear? Even though it’s her
Tony sighs contentedly, turning her head on the pillow, as Steve starts gently buttoning her up. The fur is very soft and warm, and she feels safe, like a rabbit must feel inside its fluffy coat. There’s a hood, too, and Steve slips a warm careful hand under Tony’s neck, lifting her head a little so she can pull the hood over her messy hair, smiling down and stroking a curl aside. ‘There we go,’ she says, and her voice is soft and warm. ‘Can you wait here for a moment, honey?’
She pulls her lips away for a second and whispers, 'Please,' coming back to the kiss a second later because she can't bear to stay away. 'Suit – please,
‘This way.’ The lady, Steve’s mom, points towards a corridor. They start making their way through the crown towards it, and Tony quickly follows them, trying to stick close behind so his doesn’t lose sight of them. Their sunshine hair is bright in the crowd, easy to keep sight of.
, Tony realises, Steve’s being respectful, and God, she needs to stop feeling like bursting into tears at every little thing that makes Steve wonderful.
for her to feel like bursting into tears. She pushes her face into Steve’s shoulder and squeezes her eyes shut, and breathes through it, and Steve holds her.
‘EMERGE, SHIELD-SISTERS, FOR WE HAVE A LARGE MOUNTAIN OF GIFTS!’ That’s Thor, and Tony starts laughing in earnest.
Tony sniffs and peeks behind him. Tasha and Clint are hanging over their desks, watching, and so Tony hides his face again, embarrassed.
like she can see all the way through Tony’s layers and shells, all the way to the thumping heart inside her, too much, too much all at once. Tony’s biting down on her bottom lip, painfully hard. She doesn’t know whether to lurch back or forward.
. And then Tony grabs the remote and flicks the TV on to whatever, so they end up watching some nature channel that also has dinosaurs, because no-one can be bothered to change it. Tony and Steve share the sesame chicken, because Tony wedges the container between their knees to save it from everyone else’s
Steve nods, and shifts on his feet. ‘Do you want…’ he says, and makes a flapping sort of gesture with his arms; and Tony feels all lit up from the inside with happiness, because
bad, fine, Tony’ll even admit that she missed him a tiny little bit when they, you know thought he was dead and everything, and maybe it’s a little bit shit that he can’t come, but like everyone else will be there and it’s going to be the Party Of The Year.
who’s my friends. An’ – an’ everyone’s got their own rooms but they all live t’gether, and watch movies an’ eat cakes ‘n’ hot dogs ‘n’ stuff. An’ it’s got a whole room full of Legos!’
Tony takes a deep breath, while Clint jumps like a startled mouse. Bucky jolts too, although less noticeably. Clint’s face is pinking up, and he’s scowling at Natasha while Bucky crosses his arms, metal and flesh, tightly across his chest, totally expressionless.
Because the Stranger is different from any Two-Legger that Tony has seen before. He’s so very tall, and he has a broad, broad chest and great muscled arms, and his hair is an odd bright yellow colour like honey. He has a fire, good and strong and red, built close by a little hollowed cave in the craggy rock face, a fresh-killed deer lying nearby. A haunch is cooking, propped neatly on three sticks, sizzling and dripping fresh juices into the embers, the savoury smell wafting through the crisp cold air and reaching Tony’s hiding place.
, huge and kind and strong, and Tony sometimes wonders if Steve is the Sun god himself, come down to save Tony from the sacrifice, except that a god wouldn’t eat or laugh or growl when they burnt their finger on a hot stick.
Tony tips his head to one side in confusion. How are the fire and Tony the same, both pretty? But Steve is crinkling his eyes at him, and Steve gets to his feet, drawing himself up to his magnificent height and offering his hands to Tony to help him up. When he’s standing, Steve wraps the softest deerskin snug around Tony’s shoulders and then simply lifts him up like a little baby, tucking Tony into the crook of his arm.
Steve scoops him up and carries him over to the place where they sleep, setting him gently down on the skins and laying beside him, pressing his face against Tony’s neck and breathing shudderingly for a moment. Tony wriggles closer to him, fitting himself eagerly to the shape of Steve’s body, trembling and excited and waiting; Steve’s heart is slamming hard and fast against him.
Hope you’re all enjoying this dramatic tale! O.o Who knows what hair-raising adventures the next chapter will hold…?
Tony looks around in wonder. He has seen the sun die before, of course, but Tony’s people are of the flatlands, the sheltered caves, and here – here there is just so
‘Maybe Mom’ll read me a story, tonight,’ Tony tells Maggie wistfully, because he likes that. When Mom’s not too busy sometimes she’ll come and say goodnight with a light kiss brushed over Tony’s cheek; and sometimes, just every now and then, she’ll let him pick a story, and rest her hand on his back while she reads and shows him the pictures.
