“That wasn’t directed at you, Dean.” Cas rolls his eyes. “Regardless, I did tell him to find a more appropriate method of pursuing you going forward. You’re welcome.”
And that, somehow, gets rid of all the stupid tension around them even though it kinda started the tension in the first place. Dean snorts and pulls open the lid.
“Hey, uh, me and Mom won’t be around for a couple of days, we’re going on a hunt.”
“Dean,” he groans in that exasperated way that’s so familiar after over a decade of them being bitchy to each other.
Approximately an hour before Dean will wake up for coffee, Sam approaches him with a very bizarre question: “Hey Cas, if I was an angel, what kind would I be?”
believe trying to restart the apocalypse is a great idea? Look at the facts here, Raph. God brought Cas back after Stull-” Castiel absolutely does not see any need to correct him on that. “-but didn’t reopen the Cage. I think it’s safe to say He actually doesn’t want the end of days on Earth to keep going.”
“You ain’t goin’ nowhere we can’t see you. Sit your ass down and don’t do nothin’,” Bobby orders. He knew he’d be the first one to break silence, though. He’s too soft sometimes and outta the three of them, he’s in the least amount of danger if the angel’s gonna try anything because he knows he ain’t worth the effort of tryna kill. “Sam, gimme that ’fore you hurt yourself.”
“I find it difficult to believe there’s only one barbecue place in Dallas worthy of attention.”
Naturally, the apocalypse-world seraph picks them as a target, likely also noticing Castiel’s incomplete plumage and determining them to be a greater threat than the human soldiers. They’re already backed against a wall, there’s debris in this hallway and the bodies of friends and foes alike moving throughout the space; both of these factors combine to leave little room for maneuvering.
“You suffered over this alone for months?” Cas looks horrified. “Why didn’t you speak to Sam?”
Cas’ face is a little worried, but not pitying. “I’m sorry, Dean.”
Cas feels his eyebrows raise. “Okay. Thank you, that sounds nice.” He misses Dean. He misses Dean a lot.
Cas still looks like he’s about to drop dead any second, but his face instantly brightens. Watching him pull the undershirt on and then button his own shirt back up over it does something to Dean. He fights with his tie and obviously has no fucking idea how to actually tie it now that it’s undone so Dean takes pity and helps him do it, even putting it crooked and backwards like it always is because if it was done right Cas just wouldn’t look like himself.
Dean groans at himself and goes to find Sam, because who the fuck else is he gonna talk to about this right now. This sucks. This sucks so bad, it’s Dean’s fault Cas has been so miserable all these years when he could’ve fixed
When they’re finally allowed to board their plane a few minutes later, Castiel chooses to sit beside Dean. It should be possible to have a private conversation with him.
And of course, this turns out to be one of those times when his mouth runs without asking permission first.
“Most people are better.”
Castiel covers his face with one hand as Meg also approaches. “And you’re about to go to work.”
“I brought you one of those salads you’re always getting made fun of for.” Gabriel reaches over the back of the front seat to stuff the bowl and fork into Sam’s hands. “Eat.”
“But it is. You wake me up. Besides, it makes me sad.”
Okay, they’re reminders. I fucked up. Cas. I fucked up so bad, and I can’t fix it.”
“Excuse me?”
“Yeah, whatever…”
what could be considered a “good mood”. He’s not sure what to do with this information, how to process it. It’s just so abnormal that he has no choice but to continue eating his toast in silence. Thankfully, Dean is also eating his eggs as promised.
“Cas, holy shit, what happened?” Dean’s eyes widen. “Is that…?”
find a spell, that
“Can I do the spray bottle?”
The game starts and they glue their eyes to the screen, and the names of each team’s roster are displayed in the top corner by the MSG+ crew. Dean immediately gets angry when he sees that apparently Saturday wasn’t a one-off, Gordon Walker is still called up from Bridgeport to fill in for him. Benny and Gordon don’t actually get along with each other so he’s pretty sure that’s at least part of why the Isles lost against Vancouver two days ago.
“Sure, okay. You’re gonna love my burgers, Cas. Everyone loves my burgers, even Sammy takes a break from his dumbass vegetarian crap for them,” Dean promises. He’s already planning, trying to think what the best variant of his cheeseburgers would work best for Cas. “You can bring some of your cheesecake too if you want, or we can have pie.”
“Could you just use that to kick Raphael’s ass?”
“Don’t tell Dean,” he begs, his voice croaking treacherously. “Sam, please don’t tell Dean. They’ll kill him.”
openly gay players,” Crowley corrects him, which is beginning to attract some attention because the word “gay” in Russian is functionally identical to English. “Unless, you decide to be the third. This doesn’t count - Lee Webb, myself, who are both lacking in preferences, and rumor has it, our very own Dean Winchester.”
When everyone’s warmed up, John sorts out the practice lines and D-pairs; Dean stays with Benny of course because the two of them together are a massive pain in the ass for the other team to say the least, Garth will be their starter goalie for about seventy five percent of games like usual. Castiel gets shuffled into the fourth line with Crowley and Kevin because he’s wearing an A and the fourth line can probably benefit from some leadership, given that the right wing is a rookie and the center is an industrial-grade asshole.
They changed after Cas got turned into an archangel - now, the feathers are teal with black vanes and they’re slightly longer than they were before so that his span is equivalent to Jack’s or Gabriel’s. Dean snuggles backwards even deeper into Cas’ chest and closes his eyes for a minute as he soaks in the heat.
“I appreciate the structure and routine, if I’m honest.”
Sam makes a face. “Good for you…?”
“Because your Castiel is taking drastic steps born of extreme desperation to destroy Raphael in order to prevent a second apocalypse. I’m ashamed of my past actions and I want to undo them.”
“I don’t know, Cas. Not this. But y’know what I would’a asked Sammy and Bobby for help, because they’re my family. I would’a asked
“Yes, I understand. I’ll remember for next time.”
“His presence would be obvious if he were currently operating under his own faculties. I assume someone else is interfering.”
Dean watches his brother. “You saw it, didn’t you? Didn’t you?”
“That was perfect,” Jerry Panowski, the team’s PR manager, tells him once he’s done. “Your second one will happen after everyone else is done.”
“I had a little bit of help from Jack,” she admits.
“You’ve been a professional hockey player for over a decade, I’m sure you know the answer to that,” Crowley snorts at him.
Dean’s body seizes up as he cuts himself off and goes silent. Cas is forced to make a guess about what Dean was going to say.
he knows how time problems work… probably. “Cas, I’m not mad, okay? I get that you did what you had to or whatever. Long as you don’t make me forget again.”
“I don’t got feathers, though. Think you could use a couple’a my shirts or something?”
“I’m not hungry.” Raphael always takes a lot out of him. “I would like one of the weight-blankets, I need to lie down.”
He switches focus to the demonic and isn’t surprised at all by what he finds. Plenty of them topside, operating independently. The ones still down in Hell are fighting among themselves about who gets the throne, but if it’s been going on this long then clearly a winner isn’t going to be decided anytime soon. That’s good, though; without the threat of a large-scale incursion, Winchester And Co can focus on preparing for the big bad to show up.
Dean waves a little bit and once the call ends the smile drops right from his face. “Dude, my dad’s gonna kick your ass for just walking out like that, the hell were you thinking?”
“Aww, thanks Dean, I feel loved.”
“Super. Don’t hit on my brother.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Yeah. Sorry, champ.”
“Quit starin’,” Dean groans, despite not opening his eyes yet and having no way to know that that’s exactly what Cas is doing.
you wanna talk?!”
He gets to the fridge with every intention of grabbing just one beer and going back to the library, but suddenly realizes that he’s actually really hungry and has to stop so he can make a sandwich. By the time he’s done eating it he has no idea what he was doing before he came in here.
“It’s only temporary and the means to an end.”
It’s only because he’s known Dean for years now that Castiel catches the moment that this information feeds into Dean’s logic. The slightest relaxation of posture follows shortly after, so subtle that most wouldn’t catch it. Dean backs away from him and sits on the side of the bed.
“I’m fine, I was just thinking about something.”
“They’re talking about us,” Gabriel comments around a mouthful of… something sugary as always.
With 12:37 left in the 3rd, Castiel’s penalty expires and he’s finally allowed back into rotation. Naturally this means that at 12:31 Crowley is tossed in the box for cross-checking, so the team is immediately shorthanded on the ice. The third PK unit is sent as Castiel settles himself on the bench between
the coincidence, both of us came to see you today and we have presents!”
Dean leans his forearms on his legs and folds his hands together between his knees. “So um.”
“Yeah, us humans blow you guys outta the water, Cas. We don’t gotta come up with goofy shit like that ’cause we can just say ‘sweetheart.’”
“Bobby, this is Jack.”
“Are you seriously saying that making my day-to-day life as difficult as you can on purpose was actually you hitting on me?”
“Sure. Just make sure everyone knows this isn’t an ambush anymore, it’ll be more like a battle royale.”
“Is Dean okay with you running around doing stuff while he’s out for the night?”
The important thing is Cas is still there, and apparently doesn’t mind Dean clinging to him and sleeping right on top of his chest. The guy has patience like a stone sometimes, which makes sense when you remember that he’s literally four and a half billion years old.
“They’re homophobes. This team, it has some openly gay players and my career is no longer in trouble. That’s to me worth it.”
“Y’know, I’m not sure how I feel about my kid being God’s bitch.”
Dean yells at the exact moment that Castiel sighs the word “Fine.”
“Yes they do. Transgender men who desire biological children-”
His phone starts to ring, and it can only be one person dialing him at 9:40 pm because Gabriel and Michael are both wrapping up games of their own, Meg is probably about to fall asleep and Dean already spoke with him earlier.
. As play becomes fully engaged once again, the announcement comes over the stadium speakers:
Two rings.
Whimpering.
“Okay, okay, um. I might be able to help. My brother’s a lawyer. How long do you have?”
“Dean wouldn’t allow it. I’ve been attempting to make due with my grace, but I frequently lose track of which areas need the most urgent tending.”
“Sammy… he alive?”
“Sam. They
prepared or asking for that, man! Come on!”
“Possibly my sister Anna. We’re not always on the best terms, but I’m confident she wouldn’t deliberately harm me. I believe the nurses will have contact info for her, and if not they will have the info for my father and you can reach her through him.”
The truly insane thing about the situation is that Castiel has, in the past, instigated on-ice fights with Crowley by yelling profanities at him in Russian. It was a perk of going to a very nice private school as a child, he learned ASL out of necessity and later took Russian purely for fun. This turned out to be extremely helpful to his hockey career considering the number of players exchanged between the NHL and KHL, and after his sophomore season when he was traded to the Rangers he had a number of Russian teammates and often helped translate.
“Oh.” That one word sounds surprisingly broken. “Yes. That’s. Clever.”
“We’re fine,” Castiel insists, shaking his head slightly. He misses his mouthguard, he desperately needs to chew on something.
“Great. Now get the hell out.” Castiel stands still and says nothing. He’s being himself from four years ago, and himself from four years ago would have no response to this. Dean’s eyes roll. “Don’t you got someplace better to be right now? Like guarding seals or whatever?”
of the Isle who barrels into the man currently possessing the puck, it’s too much movement to be a legal check, and Castiel can’t exactly see which part of the Oiler goes into the glass first but it must be bad because the whistle blows everything dead instantly. All of the Islanders and all of the Oilers watch in stillness, the crowd in the arena is completely silent, like every person here is holding their breath at once. Castiel leans over the bench to try and gain a better angle, assess the situation, but it’s not necessary or productive because there are too many players in the way now.
Dean snorts.
“Oh.” Cas isn’t sure what to make of this, but it fills him with the warm fuzzy feelings that he used to get from Dean’s hugs, which was probably intended. Looking in the bag again, he finds two more in different colors. “Thank you.”
Dean lightly plucks the sketch from his fingers and looks it over. “Creepy.”
“Yeah, I’m Heaven’s new boss.”
Dean’s proud of himself for not choking. He knew they’d have to talk about it at some point, but he was hoping it could be put off at least until they got home. Although… this is probably better. Sammy can’t eavesdrop on them.
he answers, because there’s nothing he can possibly offer to fix the situation.
Trigger warnings in endnotes.
“What’s wrong?”
He hangs up a second time.
is released after his two minutes and the Isles make it out again only for play to get stopped on an offside.
“Bitch,” he says, just for appearances’ sake. His heart’s not in it to banter right now. He’s too tired and his whole fucking body hurts and he wishes Cas just let Alastair kill him.
up to. He can help us stop whatever the hell’s going on in Heaven.”
“It’s gonna be fine, Cas,” Sam interrupts, raising one hand slightly away from the table.
Dean can’t help it - he laughs. “Hey there, buddy. I’m Dean.”
The first intermission comes and Castiel is stopped on his way to the locker room by their on-ice reporter.
“Yes.”
Once his phone is safe supposing one of his teammates decides to prank him by getting into it somehow, Dean switches from the pajamas he had on for his pregame nap to his game day suit. It’s annoying in kinda the same way that it’s annoying when they play in Dallas, except Florida is way worse because at least Dallas cools off at night and isn’t humid as fuck. Dean hates his stupid necktie and button shirt already and he hasn’t even left the safety of the air conditioned hotel yet.
“Regardless of the fact that it’s obviously performative on the part of upper management, the Islanders as an organization have taken to loudly describing themselves as one of the most diverse teams in the NHL in recent years. It’s reasonable to assume that if you came out publicly this would be well-received for a number of reasons, not the least of which would be that you’d be the very first captain of any team to do so. That aside, you wouldn’t have to keep worrying about it turning into a scandal. Someone from the press will find out eventually, so it would be better for you to do it on your own terms, not theirs.”
“But why is that your fault?” Jack demands, in a tone of voice that
Still nothing. He’s only been here for five minutes and it’s already pissing him off. His stupid wings move a little bit, but it’s not on purpose. He has no idea what to do with them or how they actually work or anything. How did Cas fly, back before the fall? How did he do it, the zipping from place to place? Actually… is Cas still warded, now that he’s in the Empty? Can Dean find him this way?
So on a minor note about part of Cas' conversation with Dean about his wings in this chapter: I have read many wingfics by now, and a lot of them are well-plotted and excellently written. However, I don't understand the popular headcanon that Cas' wings would somehow be an erogenous zone. For one thing, angels weren't intended to have sex (especially not with humans), so there's no logical or biological reason why they'd be made that way. For a second thing, wings are limbs. You don't grab someone's forearm and expect them to get turned on. For a third thing, the whole thing with the oil glands - just. No. On so many levels. I feel like if rubbing on those would feel good, it would feel good the same way rubbing the corners of your eyes when your eyes itch feels good, there's nothing sexy about it. This isn't a critique of other writers' works, I just don't get how this particular headcanon came into being.
His palms sweat a little, but he opens the door anyway. And this time it’s not bits and flashes. He watches Cas piecing him back together, making him whole after Alistair tore him apart. And once he’s assembled again, Cas grabs him by the shoulder and drags his worthless ass free from the pit. When Cas’ posse of angels have made it out again, most of them vanish. And Dean watches Cas carrying him, laying him down gently in his coffin the way someone puts a baby in a crib for a nap. It’s tender and sweet, in a really weird way.
“How likely is this to actually work?” Sam asks frantically.
“They make me tired and sick.”
“We aren’t machines for you to run into the ground,” Castiel snaps, dropping his stick and folding his arms across his chest in a deliberately antagonistic manner that he’s seen Jack do during a tantrum sometimes. “And incidentally our performance as a team would be much improved if you could for even a second consider that we actually
“It’s entirely possible,” he agrees. “But it needed to be said and I’m not taking it back. I’m sure there’s some reason you haven’t already attempted this, and I won’t tell you which actions you should take. But changes need to be made, and soon.”
“No, that’s normal, they do that when I’m happy.”
“About a hundred if you’re counting all the tiny ones at the bottom.”
“I’m an assistant captain, and probably will be re-signed,” Castiel points out flatly, switching to Russian so their bickering won’t disrupt the rest of the team. “You are inconsistent and a problem, and it’s not important - should be mentioned, that your face is asking for a brick.”
“I’m not, I’m not. Are you okay?”
Castiel puzzles over their brief conversation for a moment, but ultimately decides it’s not important or concerning enough to warrant further examination and returns to considering the power upgrade that his brother has offered him. Admittedly, the idea isn’t an unwelcome one by any means, but he does harbor some reservations about it because he vividly remembers what happened when he swallowed the souls and the leviathan from Purgatory. Of course, he’s grown since then, and this time Dean will be informed from the beginning and can help him adjust. When he’d been engaged in his foolish war against Raphael it was at a point in time where, by comparison to humans, he still had the emotional maturity of a toddler. Castiel likes to believe that he’s much wiser and more tempered now.
“I got a crick in my neck,” he complains, which isn’t what he actually wants to say but it’s the safest thing he can think of instead of trying to do the
“Don’t take this the wrong way, but your wings are really beautiful.”
“I need to speak to Dean Winchester,” comes a deep, stern voice.
It takes Dean several moments to reply to that statement.
Dean glares fiercely. “Sam ain’t here.” His expression becomes even more suspicious and overtly hostile at the mention of the youngest Winchester. “What the fuck do you want?”
Gabriel sits on the edge of Dean’s bed and Castiel settles cross-legged on the floor. Ideally, he would be back in his own vessel and Dean would be performing this task, but Gabriel is far from his worst option and it doesn’t technically matter either way.
“WE’RE PREGNANT” Eileen signs at the webcam.
“That stands to reason,” Castiel decides, still making no attempts to pick himself up off the ground. His wings refuse to flex. “We should go to Bobby Singer’s house. Dean will be interested to know that I’ve found another solution finally.”
“Yes, that does seem to be a common grievance.”
fortunately, he’s skipping it to have a meeting with his sister.
“Shut up, Sammy. I don’t wanna hear it.”
“You’re fine,” Gabriel says dismissively.
Donning his skates and body armor, Castiel can only hope that John is feeling at least somewhat merciful today, because this isn’t the first practice Jack has attended and Castiel is sick of having to explain why his coach is so angry and mean in terms a five-year-old will understand. That chance is immediately destroyed when Crowley gets into it with John exactly four seconds into their first drill. Because of
“Why?”
So he works on stuff. Baby, obviously, he does care routines on his car. But he also works on picking up some more sign language like Sam’s been doing, so that their conversations during dinner can be easier or whatever. He teaches his new dog a couple tricks. But most of all Dean does his best not to drink so much. And he thinks Cas would probably be proud of him for that, maybe.
Gabriel doesn’t feel bad about smiling when Sam’s fingertips first skim through at the base of his right wing, attentively straightening coverts and down. He folds his own hands in his lap and closes his eyes for a moment… it’s been several thousand years since one of his older brothers helped him preen his wings, and the sensation is much more satisfying and comfortable than doing it on his own. He can already feel the shift in Sammy’s mood too, becoming less tense and more receptive to what Gabriel is about to say.
scrambles to retrieve the tumbling rubber disc and flings it somewhat imprecisely to Crowley, who finally is able to actually score the goal they’ve been trying to put in. They pile him to slap his helmet and arms, and head for the bench as the home crowd boos them.
He fills another page, tapping the fingers of his left hand to beat the pattern of his anxiety into the surface of the desk. All that needs to happen is for him to not receive that phone call, and tomorrow Dean will be here.
“Who’s ‘us?’”
was. Yet another person on the list who likely knew without being told and was
pale.”
A Star swipes the puck, but only possesses it for two and a half seconds before Dean is shoving him off it and stealing it back to send to
“Yeah, I know,” Dean says quietly. He sits, reaches a hand without touching, pulls it back again - eventually his palm gently settles on Cas’ upper arm. “Gabe’s got a pretty bad head injury, they have him in ICU right now and he might need surgery.”
“Okay. She got a name, or did the guy get a chance to tell you first before he bit it?”
“In Heaven, when angels have grievances against each other there are a number of approved methods for conflict resolution. Most minor disagreements are resolved by complaining to someone higher on the chain of command so that an angel of superior rank can mediate the discussion, but there are other ways to do it as well. Occasionally the offending party is demoted or imprisoned. There’s also a practice that… is officially discouraged, but still takes place and is often purposely overlooked by commanders and supervisors. If the problem is serious enough, then the angel who’s been wronged will pull some of the primary feathers out of the wing of the angel who did the wronging. It’s not serious enough to fully inhibit flight but it does make it uncomfortable and difficult to do so.”
“Wonderful. Now, I’ve had more than my fill of you and the fact that you have the subtlety of a hammer dropped on an egg for the evening, so get out.”
Is he fucking serious with that question right now?
And eventually it does start to ebb away. Cas sinks himself deeper into the bedding like it’s a protective cocoon. He’d still rather have Dean. He needs a hug. Bundled in warmth and exhausted now, Cas falls asleep through no fault of his own and naps until a nurse comes to wake him up - he returns to full consciousness with fingers poking him repeatedly in the shoulder. Cas groans and stretches his back before shifting the pillow away from his head.
The 2nd is a bit more active than the 1st, with the Stars and the Isles both gaining a goal. When the buzzer goes at the end and both teams return to their locker rooms, Castiel is pulled aside briefly and informed that he’s going to be fined for breaking his opponent’s nose. He doesn’t care. He makes more than enough money as it is, he already has over a hundred thousand dollars set aside to put Jack through college later on and given that his son’s future is his largest concern he has very little to worry about at the moment in terms of money.
Before Dean can say something awful he doesn’t really mean like the dumbfuck he is, Jack thankfully pops up out of nowhere to interrupt. “Dean, Cas, Uncle Gabe says we can go home now.” He notices Bobby and waves. “Hello.”
“We’re going to talk about it with him, we’ll ask him not to. Do you need your ativan?”
“I thought there’s a penalty for that now?”
“Just under thirty two hours.”
So love_u_always_mom helped so much with this chapter, I figured OG Death would have a library like Billie's but it would look and feel completely different, and she came up with the idea for the oil lamps and ancient books and everything instead of the clean and almost sterile esthetic we see in 13x05.
“Okay. Thanks, Cas. Dean, I don’t get it, why are you so pissed? This is a good thing.”
“No,” Jack says in a very small voice. Then he grabs Castiel and Gabriel by their shoulders and flies all of them back to the bunker.
“I’m confused,” he admits.
“…but?”
“Yes.” He gasps. “Raphael has agency. He might make me transfer to a different hospital. I don’t want to go.”
Castiel rolls his eyes. “I need your assistance,” he growls in Russian.
“She is? Why?”
“BOBBY!” Dean yells, ignoring the angel. “We got problems!”
They may be about to die.
He’s disinterested in his lunch today. They’ve changed which therapy groups he goes to for the morning and afternoon, in order to teach him coping skills for when he’s discharged. He doesn’t like these groups as much, and he wonders if it works differently for him because he’s neurodivergent. Some therapy methods don’t work on autistic people. Maybe that’s the problem.
“What the hell was that all about, Cas?”
Death glances over his shoulder to give Castiel a look that’s almost amused. It’s frightening. “Angels weren’t intended to love humans.”
“There was an important discussion on the phone.”
And he realizes that it reminds him of Raphael.
“It’s unfortunate we can’t pray back to humans,” Castiel wheezes. “Dean could come pick us up…”
“Dean.” This can’t be real. Is he already in Heaven? But why is Sammy here, too, then? “It’s alright. You’re going to be fine.”
“Why do you wanna be a hockey player, Jack?” Dean asks during another water break.
“Why can’t humans see wings?” Jack wonders.
“Are you asking me to do that? Because I’m not powerful enough to-”
“Um. Cas, can I talk to you for a second?” They go into the hall and walk a long way from the locker room for privacy. “The hell were you tryna pull in there, man?”
“No. You shouldn’t interrupt.”
“There’s so much at my job that’s cruel and unusual already, what’s one more thing?” she says sarcastically.
Cas can’t hear his own voice through the ringing, but he feels the vibrations in his throat around the words “oh, no” immediately prior to his crying getting worse. What happened to Gabriel? He needs to know but there are no answers for him. Time ceases to mean anything after that. He knows three things: agony, fear, and the feeling of Dean supporting his weight.
“You seem distressed. Are you distressed?”
Crowley, somehow, is still talking right up to the moment where they leave the locker room and pour onto the ice for warm-ups. Castiel does a couple laps around their defensive zone, then gets as far from his liney as possible and goes through his routine to stretch in this order: hips, legs, abdomen, shoulders. He gets back to his feet and takes some pot-shots at… goalie wearing the number
Castiel sits and accepts a mug of coffee, largely out of solidarity and not because it makes any genuine difference to him. He frowns to himself but doesn’t outwardly voice his disapproval when he watches Dean opening a beer while digging up the correct size of frying pan. Sam, apparently, has no such issue.
Cas smiles. “I’m well-versed in the compulsion to watch a single piece of media repetitively. It’s why I’ve seen so few movies and shows, incidentally. There are five or six of either that I enjoy and so I stick with them without feeling the need to seek out new material.”
“A cat. They’re low maintenance.”
the one who protected me. I don’t believe you couldn’t have stood in the way on behalf of Anna and me both, perhaps you assumed she’d be weaker because she’s a girl.”
“Well, he’s actually right about that. So, think you can get behind us on this one now?”
“Okay, kiddo, you can sit in the chair for three minutes…” Dean takes Mary from Castiel and sets her down a second time. “Alright, me and Sammy never got to do this when we were kids… okay maybe I did a couple times, but I don’t remember it. Either way. Literally every other family on earth does it, so we’re doing it with her every single year.”
“He’s not. There were no other empty beds and he was assigned to the same room as me.”
This is what follows Dean around all the time in the back of his head, and right now it’s rearing up, because there’s an adorable five-year-old sat in his living room right now, watching cartoons and being all normal and shit. But this is like a free trial before Dean would have to pay some outrageous price for the actual software. He’ll never get to have it for real. That’s his teammate’s kid who he’s babysitting. And by the time Dean retires from hockey he’ll be in his mid-forties probably, way too late to be starting a god damn family.
“Why?”
Castiel’s final thought before the puck drops, glowering at a man he doesn’t know particularly well but very intensely hates, is the same thought he always has in this situation.
“Thank you, Dean.”
Dean snorts. “Yeah, no, there’s like five,” he laughs. “But everybody’s got a favorite spot.”
“Yes, sir.”
The fourth line and first D-pair are called to change on, which sees the three of them flinging themselves over the bench wall in unison with Kevin and
“For breakfast.”
“Okay, uh.” He clears his throat. “Listen up, God, if you’re there. Uh. My name’s Dean Winchester. And I ain’t calling on behalf’a me, I promised someone I’d come talk to you. Her name’s Layla Rourke and she didn’t do nothing to deserve what’s happening to her. So if you’re up there or whatever, and you’re listening to me, you gotta help her out, okay? And like…” He stops. This is so fucking stupid and he knows it. “Y’know, she’s a nice girl, okay? If she’s gotta die, don’t let her turn into a ghost, she doesn’t deserve that. I know she ain’t going to Hell, so I guess… if there’s a Heaven, make sure you let her in, got it? Otherwise you’re gonna hafta answer to me, and I’mma be pissed.”
It takes a second, but Bobby does turn to look at him. The image of nine-year-old Dean dissolves.
“No, not really. They’re… it’s weird and I don’t always get it, they pretty much just assume the gender of whatever vessel they’re in. About half the time demons are the same way, but demons used to be human, so it’s different for them.”
“It was reported abandoned, Anna’s working on getting it back for you. I don’t… know if you’re still allowed to drive, though, since you have psychotic episodes. But we can worry about that more down the road.”
Food is… complicated in this household, to say the least. Castiel doesn’t know how to cook most things and he has a number of sensory issues to contend with, and Meg’s not much better than him. Add to this the fact that both of them are constantly exhausted thanks to their professions that when they first became roommates/friends they got very good very quickly at reading the directions on the back of a box of penne. Pasta is good, not only because they were both broke back then when Castiel was a brand-new Ranger and didn’t have multi-million dollar a year contracts - it’s also packed with the carbs that he needs to gorge on in order to not waste away into nothing from the demanding strain of playing such a rigorous contact sport. An entire bowl of chicken caesar salad barely qualifies as a snack for him.
He can’t. He can’t. Dean hyperventilates, his nose is running, he can’t even keep his eyes open. It’s wrong.
And what has Dean even done to earn that? How does he deserve Cas trying to fix him?
“It ain’t that simple.”
“Gabriel, please save your pettiness for someone other than a defenseless child,” Castiel snaps, not in the mood for these antics.
“Hey, Cas.”
“I killed him,” Jack says, not looking up.
comes the voice of his conscience, which as always sounds exactly like Charlie Bradbury.
Dean can’t actually cry right now, he doesn’t have the energy for it, but his eyes leak and his nose runs regardless. He stops trying to wake up and look at anything and just feels, at all the points where Cas is touching him. This obviously isn’t real but he wants to absorb it anyway, because who knows if he’ll ever get the chance to hallucinate this again and right now… it’s just. It’s so nice. Dean will cling to any scraps he can still get. He didn’t even wash his jacket. Actually he wrapped it up in plastic and hid it in a box in his closet, so that nothing could happen to the handprint that soaked in on the shoulder.
Cas thinks to himself. He’s not adept at distinguishing social cues on the fly and when he considers any of Dean’s actions after the fact his conclusions always draw confusing signals from his friend’s behavior. He knows for a fact that Dean does care about him, but not in what capacity. It’s frustrating.
“Alright. He’s not a demon, I can be fine with this,” Cas informs her.
On the other end of the spectrum, THE MOST MAJOR PROPS TO MISHA COLLINS FOR VERY LITERALLY CALLING CAS AUTISTIC DURING HIS PANEL WITH ALEX CALVERT. Love him. The goodest bean. I can die happy 🥰🥰🥰
Gabriel actually feels hurt by that, but he refuses to show it. He’s even letting the guy
“Yes. You aren’t going to make me stay in the hall to speak to you?”
Castiel considers the implications of this. His wings are extremely vulnerable if brought onto the material plane, and they must remain intact in order for him to flee from Naomi. On the other hand, Dean is only a child and hasn’t even heard of an angel blade yet, and all things considered it’s not an unreasonable or unexpected request from a human. They’re naturally curious creatures, after all.
“Hello.”
He obliges briefly and then returns his attention to Mary because he’s concerned she’ll choke - by one year of age, it’s readily apparent that her wings and her eye color are the only things she’s inherited from him, and the rest of her is all Dean. This means she stuffs her face relentlessly the same way Dean does, requiring a close eye during meals to avoid accidental asphyxiation. So far, it hasn’t happened. And it thankfully doesn’t happen today either. She giggles up at him from her chair with chocolate frosting painted across almost her entire face, and when Castiel smiles back, it’s genuine this time.
“No, she’s dead,” Castiel says flatly. “I didn’t know her well. Michael and Gabriel were much more upset than I was when she passed, and I didn’t meet Anna until after I was traded to the Rangers. She’s a journalist and she saw my name in the paper.”
“So I take it we won?” Dean guesses.
Dean disappears into the kitchen, likely to have three beers with his snack. Castiel sighs quietly through his nose and rubs his temples - he’s had a headache all morning, a word he never thought to apply until describing the problem to Dean over breakfast. His boyfriend had informed him that yes, he has a headache. It’s unusual and incredibly unpleasant despite being very far from the worst pain he’s experienced in his long life. Sam had suggested an entire bottle of extra-strength Tylenol to cure him, but Castiel had felt inexplicably hesitant to accept that solution. Which leaves him standing in the library rubbing his face.
He realizes, too late to stop it from happening, that it’s not just his grace. While he consciously isn’t aware of the methods to intentionally tap the Angel Tablet and its deep well of power, his grace has somehow managed to do it for him, and raw energy abruptly blasts unchecked from his vessel in every direction.
“Gabriel! Get these!
Dean seems much more awake now, probably because he’s annoyed.
“Because he knows what he’s… what he

“I saw it happen so many times. But I don’t understand the mechanics involved.” His eyes open a little. “How do humans choose their mates?”
“Yeah, of course. I’m not going anywhere.”
Dean shakes his head. “You dumbass.”
Castiel indulges a quiet gasp. She looks so much like Dean, although her hair is a much lighter blonde than his. But she has his freckles and his ears, his chin. Castiel immediately loves her, it’s impossible not to. And he managed to make it through the process. He can deliver her to Dean himself.

And Castiel suddenly understands.
For so very many things, but Castiel doesn’t say that. He reaches inwards to reorder Dean’s short-term memory, so that John was not injured and the hunt was successful. As much as he loathes doing so he heals Dean’s father’s arm, only performing the action on Dean’s behalf, and leaves behind the effects of alcohol consumption as an explanation for drowsiness.
“Eventually. Once she was old enough to protect herself from Heaven’s wrath.”
“Okay, I guess. He said it’d work better if I don’t jump right to the conclusion of ‘this guy is a quack’ so I’m tryna not do that.”
“I concur with Dean,” Cas says flatly, not trying to move.
now? I just woke up like ten minutes ago!”
“Shut up, Sammy!” Dean looks back at Jack again. “Yeah, get it over with.”
“Are you going to keep visiting me here?” he asks, trying desperately to change the subject.
Dean doesn’t grab Cas by the shoulder this time - instead, he holds his hand. Cas looks really surprised about that, but in a good way. He gives up the peanut butter sandwich and then starts talking.
“Then there you go.” Dean stands up and Jack mimics him without being told. “So here’s what you’re gonna do to cope: you’re gonna go to the kitchen and make a bunch’a popcorn, and then you’re gonna go sit in front of the tv and watch about a billion Disney movies in your pajamas. I gotta shower but after that I’ll come watch with you.”
“Feathers.”
“I was only-”
“It’ll be fine. You said no cursed objects, this is way better.”
“I should never have been able to feel these kinds of emotions at all. I think I learned it by watching you. Try not to dwell on your grief for too long, Dean. I’m choosing to do this.”
“Cas needed a different one,” Dean shrugs, trying not to get too defensive. It’s fine. It’s just a fucking necktie. It’s
“People have told me in the past that eye contact facilitates better communication. Personally I don’t like looking at people most of the time, it’s distracting and at times frightening.”
“Yes. That’s what finally got me sent here. But it wasn’t true. I didn’t want to die, I was trying to fly. Apparently the fire department will arrive to retrieve you when you attempt to leap off of things.”
“Do they have one to find me a new boyfriend?”
But if he did, he’d remember it. He knows he would.
Cas gives him the

“Huh?”

Castiel is starting to feel worried that Gabriel will make good on his Twitter threat from earlier - he’s unpredictable and hyper, and with him being a right wing and Castiel being a left wing they’re standing directly across from each other at the faceoff dot, staring through their helmet visors. Gabriel wiggles his eyebrows and Castiel glares at him slightly in return. Jack is sitting in the third row with Anna, they shouldn’t be fighting in front of him.
“A Nephilim has recently been conceived. We’ll need to be alert.”
“No. Uh, no, Cas, I wouldn’a stabbed you in the chest after,” Dean agrees. “And that really sucks, man. Obviously I mean I already
“You’re missing the Moms Trip right now?”
I do not think I will ever get used to living in a world where I get a hundred hits per week and have twenty three subscribers to a fic, seriously both of those things have probably put years on my life. You, reader checking this note before diving into the chapter, are the best and I love you ^_^ <3
It’s stupid, it’s so fucking stupid, that he didn’t know how much he needs to hear that. It’s one thing for Sam and Cas to say it, or even Bobby when Dean visited him in Heaven. But it’s a whole other thing coming from her.
Hiding from another pack of crossroads demons that bicker about who cheated who while betting souls during a poker game last week, Castiel realizes that it begs the question of how, exactly, he plans to free Gabriel. Any warding strong enough to hold an archangel will certainly be enough to stop him, a mere seraph. And he’ll have a Prince of Hell to contend with. Did Death set him up to fail on purpose?
But it’s a great prank. Unexpected? Check. Obnoxious and/or humiliating? Check. Not able to affect innocent bystanders? Check. Technically harmless? Check. Personalized to the victim? Check. Enormous pain in the ass to undo? Major check. Samsquatch struck all the right notes and Gabriel can’t even be mad.
“Alright.”
“Dean!
Aside from Castiel’s older brother, the Sens deflate like leaking balloons from this point onwards, and despite Crowley and Victor both getting penalties (interference and hooking, respectively) can’t keep possession of the puck for more than ten seconds. Discounting said penalties, the 3rd is generally uneventful, and the final score stays 6-2 as the clock runs dry. The Isles all pour out from their bench to hug and tap helmets with their goalie.
“Sam. You need to come back to the bunker,
“It’s Sam, would you like to speak with him?”
“I could’ve just poured it out into the sand,” he says, very matter-of-factly.
But maybe. Maybe, that’s the problem, actually.
“Here.”
She sighs. “Okay, I’ll be over sometime after five, I have a meeting with my editor tomorrow.”
Castiel tunes out John’s predictable angry tangent like always, simply going through the motions with no energy left to put behind them. He abruptly realizes that he’s packing his gearbag when he’s already halfway through doing it, which isn’t unusual in any case. The routine is so ingrained at this point that he can do it while horribly concussed and get the exact same result.
Most lesser demons, fortunately, aren’t particularly bright or observant. Castiel slips by them, their gazes roll over him with his protective markings. Castiel stumbles along into the Pit unobstructed. It’s much different from his other recent foray into Hell, where he’d been at the head of his garrison and slaughtering demons wholesale in the search for the soul of the Righteous Man. He clings to that memory because it’s actually a joyous one for him, his friendship with Dean came out of it and even with the turmoil it’s been very rewarding.
“I don’t honestly know what to say right now. That was a really good answer, thank you.” Gabriel can’t help his feathers fluffing up a little with pride, which startles Sam. “Did I do something wrong?”
Castiel smiles widely. This is his favorite human. Dean is younger, vaguely less traumatized, but still very much himself and recognizable. He’s attempting to meddle with things he doesn’t understand or even believe in yet on behalf of another human, for no other reason besides the fact that he’s so staggeringly
“Good, he’s gonna help you unfuck your life.”
“Huh?” Dean gasps, wiping under his helmet with a towel.
Cas! About
“But I like to be helpful.”
Dean glances behind himself briefly at the body, uncaring. “Yeah well… that Dean’s always been kind of a dick.”
“Has it ever occurred to you that there’s a reason you still haven’t made it beyond the third line on any team despite it being your thirteenth season of professional hockey?” Castiel demands. “It’s precisely because of behavior like this. You’re notoriously uncooperative with your teammates and you’ve made no efforts to improve your disposition, to say nothing of the fact that you repeatedly and deliberately get on the nerves of whichever head coach is saddled with you at the moment. When your contract expires five and a half seasons from now and they don’t re-sign you, I can almost guarantee that your reputation is such by this point that you’ll be forced into free agency because no team will want you.”
At least he has Dean and lemon pudding.
“I won’t hear any more from you,” Raphael decides, pointing a hand at him and Prior-Castiel to inhibit them from speaking. “You’re not interested in aiding Heaven, you only care because of your pet human.” He looks at Gabriel again.
is Cas’ reply. That shuts him right up.
be angry about Castiel lying, but it’s also extremely likely that the longer Castiel waits the more upset he’ll be. He grudgingly admits to himself that Sam is right.
“Sorry.” Cas turns to the ceiling again. “Hello, Dean.”
The sleep doesn’t come. However, he does indulge in a peaceful sensation caressing him, folding him into the nothingness. Perhaps it lasts for several years, he has no means to be sure, but time is meaningless in any case, especially here. Castiel refuses to dwell on it.
(See the end of the chapter for
argues. “C’mon, brother, we all know them little plastic thangs’re worthless.”
Castiel doesn’t get up. He’s not stupid enough to try and follow this time.
There’s no way Sam heard that right. “You. It’s. Inside you?”
“By my - what does that mean?”
The whiskey burns in his stomach and tears leak out of his eyes. Dean wants Cas back, he wants the dumb trench coat and the literal interpretation of
His boyfriend’s expression graduates to
“Injured.”
“Oh! So Dean should groom Cas’ wings?” Jack guesses.
“It’s getting handed over to you once we divvy up the spoils, man. You ain’t getting left out, promise.”
Cas carefully sits on the edge of the bed and puts his hand on Dean’s shoulder. He drinks his orange juice and wishes Dean can be okay. He likes Dean, even though he doesn’t believe Dean likes him very much.
The third power play unit is sent, this being Castiel, Kevin,
“Well, to quote my wise and well-spoken boyfriend, life’s a bitch and then you die.”
“I see.” Castiel feels disturbed. He can guess what the drawing was probably of. “So it’s been resolved?”
“No, not very often,” he admits. He folds his hands on the table. “You find the idea discomforting. I don’t blame you.”
“Please understand that there’s an important difference. I saved your life because I wanted you to live, but you’re refusing to do so. I know my decision has wounded you and I’m sorry for that, but you need to understand-”
“Yeah, that should be fine,” Dean decides. “Anything I should know going in?”
“Hey, you wanna see her?” Sam offers.
“Dean.” Cas’ voice is suddenly urgent. “You need to put out the fire. There are angels approaching that I don’t recognize, they could be with Raphael.”
They get in Dean’s car, which has no seatbelts - logically Cas is aware that this isn’t technically a good thing, but it’s one less sensory issue he’ll have to put up with and that makes him happy. He settles comfortably against the seat and prepares to watch Dean drive for forty minutes.
rebels. I presume you’re all here because his deal with the King of Hell isn’t panning out.”
“Uh. Nothing’s even really wrong right now, why are you drinking?”
That’s a lie.
he warns.
Cas is staring at Dean from across the locker room. Like, more than usual. Just before they head back to the ice for the 2nd Cas starts signing.
“No, I can’t, because I’m your friend.”
and the name is
“Should I do yours instead?” Jack asks, very seriously.
“Alright…” They hug her, briefly. “Good luck, Mom.”
“We’re not talking about demons.” Castiel guesses that Mary is becoming fed up and that this conversation has been running in circles for a very long time. They’re both clearly exhausted from being on the road as well. “Couldn’t both of them get different vessels?”
“Castiel… when’s the last time I even saw you?” Lucifer murmurs beside his ear. “Hmm… I think you were still in elementary school…”
the third-biggest fuckup in the entire family,” Gabriel grins, lightly slapping his shoulder. “Here, I brought you some contraband.”
Cas nods, even knowing Michael won’t see it. “Call Gabriel. He’s very angry with you. If you want to have any kind of relationship to me, you can start by fixing the one you have with him. Because
“I’m not sure. At first I thought they were agents of Raphael, but there was something off about them.” Cas’ eyes finally open to stare up at him. “Have you seen them before?”
“Did he just elbow that guy in the face?” Charlie wonders.
“For what?”
“I ain’t asking you to explain yourself to me, you stupid sunuva bitch, I’m tryna get you to see that you were wrong,” he interrupts. “And the sooner you realize that, the sooner you can finish mopping up the giant mess you made. Now I don’t know what you said exactly to get Dean so down like he is, but you better fix it quick ’fore I lose my sense’a humor about this and kick your ass.”
The ambiance of this location has the gravity of all things ancient. The only light sources are candles in black wrought-iron holders and oil lamps, which leave streaks of dark soot on whichever surfaces are closest to them. Row upon row upon row of shelves are lined up to either side, filled almost to bursting with books. Upon closer inspection the tomes are bound in cracked leather and Castiel can tell by the smell how old and brittle the pages are, although this is apparently incongruous to reality because when he picks one up and attempts to open it he finds it impossible to move the cover even a millimeter. He replaces it and begins walking deeper into the library.
“It’s kinda unavoidable right now, Cas.”
“And it took me until this afternoon to figure out that.” Dean rubs his hand over his hair, there’s no reason this should be so hard. “Y’know, your uh. Your deathbed confession. Dammit, I know what I’m tryna say here!” Words suck. They’re too hard, and Dean’s getting all frustrated and pissed off now. Cas just looks confused as hell. “Look, it recently occurred to me that I want your feathery ass around until the day I die and there’s gonna be snuggling and other cute shit that Sammy’s gonna tease us both for in your immediate future,” he finally gets out, sounding way more demanding than he means to.
Two nurses appear in the door of the room - one begins interrogating Dean and the other nicely asks Cas to come with her to morning group. The routine dictates that yes, he should do his therapy group this morning, so he does even though he’s worried about what’s going to happen with Dean.
Eighty seven of you have now decided to receive emails every week telling you I've updated this lunacy *basks in the warmth of reader attention like a crocodile on a sunny beach* 🐊☀️🏖️
” he complains.
Just what the hell you mean by that, Cas?” Dean asks eventually, slowly sitting down as he speaks.
(See the end of the chapter for
Gabriel seems somewhere between confused and fed up. “Fine! Let’s make this as needlessly complicated as possible.”
Castiel waits for the growl of the Impala to fade, then shakes his wings to give the impression that he’s only now arriving and makes himself perceptible to humans. “Hello, Dean.”
like a cursed object.”
“Well, Doctor Giggles over there says post-trauma stress or what-fucking-ever. It’s a nice fancy word for the screaming in my head’s too loud and it fucks me up so bad the only way out is to die. They’re not gonna fix me here and you shouldn’t bother being sad. There’s nothing in me worth being sad over.”
Castiel rolls his eyes at her and returns his attention to the stickers on his helmet. He’s waiting on a replacement for his home-game one just like with the gloves, but his away-game helmet is white and won’t need to be changed, so all he’ll have to do is get the stickers changed out on that one. Ultimately he ends up seated on the couch with both helmets, peeling off numbers and team crests while Meg goes back and forth between flipping channels and talking into the void about whatever she’s looking at on her phone.
They start walking again. Castiel is quickly starting to loathe the floor here, it makes him feel so obvious and out of place.
“Essentially. The souls of living creatures can be formally claimed, either by Heaven or Hell or occasionally an individual such as a god. When that happens there’s a mark left behind. Usually the mark isn’t tangible without accessing the soul, but… sometimes it manifests physically instead,” he explains, trying not to be hesitant.
“You okay, buddy?”
Nothing. Not even a fucking echo.
The rest of warm-ups goes pretty okay; it’s all the standard stuff, taking pot-shots at Garth to get him in the zone and doing their stretching routines and flipping pucks up over the glass so that the mob of kids gathered there can catch them as souvenirs. They eventually get off the ice and go back to the locker room, and Dean has to stand up in front of them and
“Yeah but… last time I checked, you still have a dick.”
“Okay. Well, you’re going to have a roommate again.”
Dean’s drinking his first cup of coffee for the morning when his mother sits across from him with no warning. Not that he’s not glad to see her - he almost always is - but it’s weird. Meals together with Mom practically have to get scheduled two days in advance because she’s just that independent.
“Fantastic job there, Cassie,” Crowley mutters, dropping beside him onto the bench so close their shoulders and the sides of their legs are pressed together. Castiel scoots away but his liney butts right up against him immediately. “You took a bad situation and made it worse for yourself.”
“Yeah, what?” Dean yells from somewhere outside his field of vision.
“Yeah. I mean, I can see angel wings right now anyway, but you can’t, right? And if Gabe showed you his on purpose it’s because he was being all serious and shit.”
“What? No! But he can explain how things are supposed to go for some of the others. His army trusts him and your army trusts you, Heaven can be peaceful and stable again with
except that it also has a demon in it named Crowley and he's apparently the boyfriend of an angel.
wanted Dean to die, he’s such a pain in my ass…”
“Right.”
“Mom-”
he thinks sarcastically to himself.
“Which it is.”
Dean yells for the medical trainers, still crouched on the ice and gently using his hands to hold Castiel still just in case. Distantly, Castiel registers the sound of Gabriel aggressively reprimanding whichever one of his teammates was responsible for this. No doubt there will be a penalty, either for boarding or interference.
“No.” Prior-Castiel stands, now, posture gradually becoming more defiant as his wings start to spread again. “No, that’s not-”
So I'm about to lose my access to most of the things I can do online for awhile - this isn't by choice and I can't really talk about why. Since this fic has gotten very little attention, I'm just putting up the rest of the chapters now.
“Hey, Gabe… it’s been awhile and you never come see me. I just want you to know how much that
“Yes, that’s perfectly fine. Thank you, Dean. He really only needs to stay busy until he can come watch us scrimmage.”
“So Uncle Gabe could smite Lucifer?” Jack asks, wide-eyed.
“Okay! Uh. Backing up a little, what’s the brainwashing about?”
The door opens exactly two seconds after Castiel finishes knocking.
Sam is in the kitchen drinking a beer.
Given the chance to do so, Castiel would smite that bastard into oblivion, but unfortunately it isn’t an option. John will never be punished for how he so tormented Dean. So Castiel will settle for the next-best thing, which is to convince Mary to support her son. Dean’s heard the “it’s okay” speech from Castiel and from Bobby, and he’ll inevitably get it from Sam sometime in the near future. But he needs it from his mother as well.
“Yep! And I probably need another one actually.”
Playing the whole shift is torture, and looking at the clock to realize there’s fifty four fucking minutes left in this game makes Dean want to cry. He’s been hurt before, he’s played hurt before, but during the two times that he’s actually managed to break a bone (a finger in his third season and his collarbone last year) he always drew a line and at least stopped for the rest of the match. But now he’s the captain. It doesn’t matter that something in his hand snapped, he has to be on the ice to lead the team.
“Hello, Sam.”
“Oh, good, you actually told him. I wasn’t sure if you would.”
Dean nods slightly and answers with a weak chuckle preceding his words. “I know, I’ll be careful.”
As Castiel is crawling away pitifully, Gabriel’s focus has already redirected back to Lucifer, who’s technically flight-capable but clearly growing exhausted - especially with the stab wound through his hip hobbling him.
“I - what?”
“I’m sorry, Dean. My head hurts.”
“Dean.”
“Alright, if you’re sure.” They leave briefly to retrieve their lunch trays and then sit on their beds facing each other. “Dean, correct me if I’m wrong, but there are other food groups besides pie.”
“Yeah, well… I was tryna die.” His voice cracks on the last syllable. “Sam came over at exactly the wrong moment and stopped me from blowing my own head off. But I was also on my second bottle of whiskey by then too. So he dragged my worthless ass to the ER and I got detoxed, and then they sent me here. I can’t sleep without it… not very well, anyway.”
“Does this fall under the umbrella of alcohol addiction?” Castiel asks, addressing Sam.
“Mary.” He manages to open his eyes slightly. “Her name is Mary.”
“Yeah I guess,” he shrugs. Then he groans and rubs his face, leaning back in the chair. “Oh my
A shrug, although he does speak several seconds later. “Yeah, Cas. I’m sad.”
“Yeah, we do that a lot,” Gabriel grins. He pulls some type of candy bar out of his pocket even though Jack isn’t supposed to have sugar after 4pm. “Here you go, champ.”
Dean laughs. “Yeah, the booster seat’d be pretty pointless without the seatbelt.”
The first line changes on, which has Lee Webb and Cole cycling the puck back and forth between each other while they try to get out of the neutral zone. It ends up being Daniel who carries it over the blue line, passes to Victor, who spanks the puck off the Lightning goalie’s leg pad. It springs away and nobody can grab it in time, which gets a breakaway for a lucky Bolt - the fucker jets away towards the Isles’ defensive zone and rips off a shot that Frank snatches out of the air and hangs onto. The whistle goes.
Several nurses are now present, likely to call a code green and subdue Dean. Cas doesn’t want a code green, he doesn’t want Dean to get tackled and possibly injected with tranquilizers. Nobody stands up to Raphael.
Dean’s ears notably turn red. “Cas-”
“Am I suitably temperature-appropriate for you now, Dean?” Castiel snarks.
“How’d your afford a Tacoma if you’re on disability?”
“Fine,” he agrees, mostly because they’re already here so they may as well finish the task at hand even if he doesn’t particularly care about having more than one necktie.
“Cas, nobody’s born bad. Well, maybe Crowley was. But most people aren’t. And if anybody’s equipped to handle something like this it’s us. We’ll go find these people, and when the Nephilim’s born help them teach it to control it’s powers.”
redeeming qualities as a leader to be chosen as captain besides just being the offspring of the head coach, and if he ever decides he has autonomy and the ability to make his own choices about how to guide the team, it’s that much more likely that we won’t embarrass ourselves again.” Crowley leans forward to look around Castiel. “You should stand up for yourself sometimes, darling. Upper management likes you enough that you won’t be fired or demoted for it, believe me.”
“What’s your favorite flavor of pie, Dean?”
“Jack, we had pizza yesterday. You can have pizza tomorrow when Aunt Anna is here.”
“Well… nothing. Uh. Sammy and Eileen are having babies.”
The next few minutes are Dean and Jack mimicking each other’s stretching routines, trying to see if what he’s doing is better than what Dean does. Of course, Dean’s pregame stuff is all autonomous on his part.
“Does that busted-ass thing still run at all?” Gabriel asks, making a face.
It’s a really good hallucination on Cas’ part, actually. Because when Cas steps forward, puts a hand on his shoulder, he even feels it like Cas is actually standing there and touching him.
“Yeah, yeah he’s alive. Uh. Jack had to make him ditch his grace to get him out, I guess he’s gonna give him a soul now instead so he can be fully human.”
“No.”
“They’re too dangerous,” he comments in a weak voice, finally turning his eyes to the object in Gabriel’s hands. “Hell will ultimately attempt to find and exploit them. They might need to be removed entirely from the cosmic equation.”
“I mean it exactly as it sounds.”
“It feels plausible,” Dean argues. He starts ticking off on his fingers: “Angels can time travel, Cas is usually the worst fucking liar I’ve ever seen when he gets put on the spot like that, and he’s never looked sorry like that. Ever. Not
“Good luck, Gabriel.” They won’t meet on the ice again until close to the end of December.
Cue the Stars scoring eighteen seconds into their power play, tying them at 2-2. Castiel rolls his eyes at that as much as Crowley coming back to the bench and, of course, squeezing in directly beside him.
“You’re planning to… turn me into an archangel?” he realizes. “I wouldn’t have thought that’s possible…”
Castiel guesses hesitantly.
“I know. It isn’t.”
“Yeah.”
“Cas?” Dean yells. “Cas, can you hear me?”
He glances up briefly to see Meg looking at her phone, which provides context for what she says next: “Oh, he’s cute.”
“Today makes number five,” Dean grumbles, dropping heavily onto his couch and settling beside Charlie. “Only upside is I don’t gotta drag my mom along with me through Canada.”
“But I thought they all have to come off.”
“Everyone likes Cas better.”
“Don’t you fucking
“Good.”
It’s Dean.
“Be quiet,” Castiel snaps, in no mood to put up with whatever barbs are prepared for him. “I don’t care what you think. Or what you say about anything. We would be moving like across butter if you never spoke to me again.”
“Like hell.”
My internet router stopped working and I have to post this chapter from my phone, so if I'm slow responding to comments, that's why.
It was
“He’s my father, Dean.”
“Yes. There should be a pen. Don’t touch the colored pencils, they’re in the correct order.”
He gets the disappointed-but-not-surprised look from John, which he was kinda expecting. From the next stall over, Benny reaches a hand to slap his shoulder pad supportively. He’s such a good friend, Dean would probably lose his mind without Benny…
she tells him, very slowly.
“Yeah, I know.”
The team are “hanging out” as they wait to board their flight, and Castiel is observing, trying to learn these teammates who he still isn’t familiar with. Dean is talking to likely his brother and his brother’s wife, and all three are using ASL, presumably because Dean doesn’t wish for the team (or more likely his father) to eavesdrop on what he’s saying.
Sam’s phone rings, derailing the conversation. He snorts at the screen before answering. “Good timing, man. Here, lemme put you on speaker.”
God, he can fucking hear those damn air quotes.
“Alright. Suppose I did. What could you possibly have done?”
“It looks like a twisty version of an angel blade.”
Power plays have generally two forms while inside the attacking zone, which is either almost complete stasis where they hold their positioning and ping-pong the puck around between the five of them, or to be like a washing machine on spin cycle as they rapidly switch locations to confuse the defending players and try to wrong-foot the goalie. At the moment, the Isles have opted for the second version. Castiel finds himself in the back corner again on the side the Stars goalie wears the catching glove, his eyes following the puck but keeping track of the movements in his peripherals. If he had to hazard a guess, the Stars are already beginning to feel frustrated and lose some amount of control.
“Okay, bitch.”
“I think it’ll go away for you after a few weeks,” Dean murmurs into the back of Cas’ head. “The nightmares won’t stick around for you like they did for me.”
Sam sighs quietly and watches his own hands where they’re folded on the table. “He’s been palming his meds instead of actually taking them. So twelve doses of sertraline and twelve doses of prazosin all at once made his blood pressure tank, he’s in intensive care right now.”
“I’m not sure, I still don’t know them very well yet. How many goals should I get this game?”
“I was busy protecting Anna from them, but I’m sure you don’t remember that.” The words seem stiff from the other end of the line. “It doesn’t mean I didn’t care.”
“Cas-”
“Awesome.” Dean rolls his eyes. “Cas, uh, part of the whole ‘therapy’ shtick is me tryna avoid violent… anything, so I don’t know if I’m really the best guy to be playing bodyguard for you. I’m not saying I won’t still do it, but y’know.”
“Am I?” Castiel demands. He
“Okay, well, thank you for participating, Dean. Cas?”
“Yeah, it’s not your fault babe.” Dean lands a palm on his shoulder and briefly kisses his cheek. “I’m getting a snack, we can hit the books again in a few minutes. God, where’s Sammy when you need him?”
“How many do I have?”
She won’t be happy with him but he doesn’t care, because now he has no food and he needs a nap. Cas lies down on the couch under his weight blanket, phone strategically on the coffee table nearby. He turns the tv on to some channel of paid programming that can be easily tuned out for background noise and in five minutes is dozing off to the pitch for some type of special new food processor.
“Yeah, whatever…”
It backfires spectacularly. Dean had been about to leave but now turns back around, stomping towards Castiel with murderous intent written blatantly throughout his stance. Another fist to the face. Castiel manages to spin Dean, grab hold, and his reward is the back of Dean’s skull bashing into his nose and mouth. Dean takes hold of Castiel by the shoulders and knees him in the stomach again. He’s shoved away and collapses forward onto a table.
and now he has no idea what it was. Instead he leans back into the warmth of his friend. He can’t use his weight blanket with his ribs hurt like this, so he’s been settling for getting snuggled by his friend a lot while they watch tv. The logistics of such cuddles are complicated given Cas’ numerous fractures and joint injuries, not to mention the fact that if he lies down in certain positions it makes his head pound.
“Awesome.”
“What, you forget your keys or something?”
Dean leads him to their bedroom and dims the lights by a considerable margin, then gently coaxes him to lie back on the bed before removing his shoes, belt and necktie. The lower light does seem to help.
Three minutes into his first game as an Islander, Castiel has put them on the scoreboard. The four of them all crash into him, slapping his shoulders and helmet and anywhere they can reach. Dean doesn’t get why, but he grimaces a little bit every time they touch him - it’s something to ask about after the game, maybe, because Dean is a leader and that’s something leaders do.
“Yes.” Cas remembers. “We’re in the process of transferring agency to Anna, and I won’t need to be moved again once that happens.”
Finally, at last, he gets up and goes away. Dean is rubbing his face like he has a headache… maybe he does. Crowley’s certainly annoying enough to cause one.
“Well, they aren’t supposed to look like that, no. But I did something very stupid and all the angels got hurt. For future reference, Jack, if anyone ever asks you for help with trials or a spell of any kind, and it’s
“Son of a bitch.” It’s the only thing he can think of to say that isn’t hysterical.
Sam laughs. “Uh, probably not.”
“Like a cursed object?”
“And?”
Seventy seven subscribers, watching this number and the number of comments increase week by week puts years back on my life, you're all lovely and I'm mentally hugging you in gratitude <3
None of the angels are paying much attention to him because they’re way too busy trying to kill each other, so he’s got plenty of space to slash open his palm and start drawing the sigil. One of them finally notices right as he’s putting the last lines in place and moves to stop him, which Cas is clearly not cool with - the dumbass more or less dives between Dean and the other angel.
scores, putting them on the board first on a dumb luck shot that managed to skip up over the goalie’s leg pad and trickle into the net. The Islanders getting the first goal stops him from becoming confrontational with his head coach sheerly through distraction.
“Of course.”
“How?” Castiel doesn’t understand. She’s a journalist and has nothing to do with the NHL outside of having three half-brothers who play in it.
Castiel has no understanding of this ritual, and watches Dean and Sam sing the song at her without participating while Sam films on his cell phone. Dean helps her blow out the candle and she gorges on a piece of cake. Half the cake is simply handed over to Gabriel in the first place once Mary has been served. Sam points the phone camera at Castiel.
Ultimately he’s late for his first therapy session due to traffic lights apparently conspiring against him, and once he does arrive it’s sadly predictable with him answering the same two hundred questions every therapist has always had for him during initial visits ever since he was a child. And his day does not improve from there, because shortly after he returns home his phone rings again.
Cas closes his mouth and says nothing else. He doesn’t understand why Dean is so angry. One of the psychiatrists appears and Cas immediately forgets Dean’s anger because he’s too busy scrambling into the corner, because that psychiatrist is a demon and so he needs to hide. Dean stares at him but follows the psychiatrist-demon out of the room.
Cas wanders through other sections of the unreasonably massive store as well, vaguely feeling the need to buy some new movies to watch. He wonders if he should text Dean and ask for suggestions. Dean’s seen every movie in existence after all, considering the constant references he makes that Cas never gets.
“DO YOU WANT TO TELL HIM” Eileen asks.
“What? No! Don’t insult my genius like that ever again,” Gabriel snaps, seeming genuinely offended. “With some spellwork to boost your vessel and then another tiny ritual once you’re out of Dean and back to being yourself, we can get you a promotion, bro.”
Benny laughs - the guy’s his D-partner and his on-ice best friend, and so listens to Dean bitching and moaning about John every other word out of his mouth some days.
don’t believe you deserve to be saved.”
He hasn’t thought of that memory in some time, or at least not at such length as he is now, seated upright on the bed while Dean sleeps. He’s never spoken about the rescue to Dean, because for Dean it wouldn’t be pleasant, it’s an off-limits topic of discussion like everything else pertaining to his friend’s stint in Hell. But for Castiel, it’s a good memory. He never dwells on the “what ifs” of it all, of the possibilities had another leader of another garrison performed the extraction.
Castiel sighs a second time. “None of this was your fault, Dean. I’m directly responsible for almost all of it and Sam facilitated your suicide attempt without making any moves to stop you. I’m not going to be angry with you for suffering. It’s counterintuitive at best.”
“Yes, I understand,” he says. “Have a good night, Dean.”
“I’m in a fucking mental hospital, what do you think?”
Dean looks over in time to see Bobby roll his eyes and snort. “That’s it? You came all the way here to disturb my eternal rest for
for help because you were my friend. I wouldn’a gone to ask fucking Crowley.”
have a reasonably healthy relationship. But love is not a magic cure-all. They're both still sick and very little has been solved. Am I saying that there will be a sequel? No, I don't have one planned. If I change my mind about that, though, there's a lot of directions it could go with this material.
Castiel grabs Dean by the shoulder as he tries to walk away a second time, moving around to face him. “No, you’re not! Maybe you could fight the Mark for years. Maybe centuries, like Cain did. But you cannot fight it forever. And when you finally turn - and you
“Humanity is so fragile,” Cas comments, somehow not bitter about it. “And I now have approximately forty years of it ahead of me.”
sleeping. And having very pleasant dreams, in fact. Why aren’t you asleep?”
Further waiting commences. Everything still hurts, but the lull of the hospital around him is still familiar enough that he almost takes a nap until a nurse informs him that he has a visitor. Yes, he wants visitors. It’s better than suffering alone.
“Yes. It was very difficult. I kept wanting to hug you, seeing you in that state was very distressing for me. It was my fault Alastair hurt you again.”
Sam radiates sadness and distress. “This could kill you and you won’t even tell Dean.”
“Yeah, he said… since my disability ain’t like yours, since it’s temporary, I’m gonna need a job at some point, right? Well, I already know how to fix cars, so if I went and did actual classes on it I’m pretty much guaranteed to ace the course and then I can just work as a mechanic. It’s something I’m already good at anyway. Seems like it could work.”
“Yes, I know that, you’re also attracted to women. In fact it seems split approximately sixty-forty in favor of women.” At least Cas looks a little bit uncomfortable - well, he should be, dammit. “Nobody will punish you, Dean. At least not anymore. I know you have an endless list of regrets, but this should never have been one of them.”
Cas isn’t wrong, but Dean still rolls his eyes.
As the lady stops singing the final note, Castiel glances to his left at Dean. Dean winks at him, which is confusing for an entire three seconds until he regains his focus and completely forgets about it. Team captains are often much more sought after by the media and are generally allowed to have bigger personalities than run-of-the-mill players and Dean seems somewhat rambunctious in his own way regardless, so Castiel sees no need to analyze his behavior at the moment.
“Understatement.”
Cas scrabbles at the floor, trying to escape. The hand lets go of his neck to tangle in his hair - his head lifts just enough to be smashed back down again, hard enough for white to flash through his vision. He whines and drools blood.
“I just wanna see if they’re the same as they were when I was a kid,” he admits, very slowly.
“My presence in this time will be erased. The future will proceed on hopefully a better course than the one it otherwise would’ve taken. I’ll cease to be, as will the angels chasing me. I believe you’ll remember because I’ve left an imprint on your memories, so it isn’t the same as a death. More of a sudden halt.”
Up to forty eight subscribers! :)
On the move again, Castiel dives headfirst back into the blasphemous topic of having Dean Winchester for a mate. Regardless of whether or not a nephil could actually be produced by their union, angels are strictly forbidden from taking humans as mates. Nephilim aren’t the only risk factor, though. Humans are mortal and most angels are, practically speaking, incapable of taking more than one mate in their existence. So the human inevitably dies and the angel becomes unable to leave Heaven for more than a few decades at a time, because that’s where their mate is. Hence garrison warriors being even more strongly cautioned than any other angels against looking for mates at all, but especially about avoiding prolonged contact with humans.
“Somewhere between six and seven hundred,” Castiel answers. “Gabriel and Jack have close to a thousand.”
Cas can’t help a smile. “Thank you, Dean.”
Three stars of the game - third is their goaltender for only allowing two shots out of however many dozen to actually hit the back of the net, second is Victor for the Isles’ initial goal which was sniped all the way from the blue line, and first is Castiel for his hat-trick. He’s beginning to have a headache now that the adrenalin is ebbing and he just wants to return to the locker room and then go home with Jack, but he dutifully accepts the honorific stick before tossing it over the glass for some lucky fan to keep as a souvenir.
“Then you
Dean thinks extra hard at Cas to make it so that he won’t start crying because he’s not a fucking baby, but even with that particular function shut off it doesn’t stop him from feeling like he really, really needs to. He also doesn’t know if he can talk right now, either. His wings reflexively wrap around him, which would probably work a lot better if they had all their feathers. Dean fixes on that, on the wings. He just needs to think about something else. Focus on the wings.
“Why not?”
Seventy six subscriptions now! I know eventually the number will probably plateau but for now I'm going to keep enjoying seeing it go up :)
“Yeah, I know, he scored our first goal for the season tonight, I hope we get to keep him.”
Castiel scoops her up into his arms, breathing erratically even though he can sense that she’s unhurt. It’s absolutely pointless, however, because when Dean comes into the kitchen she transfers right to him instead. Castiel isn’t sure how he feels about the fact that she learned to fly first but still can’t quite walk without holding onto something.
“Lucifer still hasn’t been put back in prison,” Michael points out.
“I wanna get tickets again, Daddy!”
” Gabriel admits. “And it’ll probably hurt. Like. A lot. But c’mon, look at all the crazy stuff that’s happened in the last ten years. There’s no way for us to know what could be coming in the future, so I’d rather have it be you getting all juiced up to have my back than anyone else.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Enough with the air quotes, mate,” Crowley snorts, briefly using English for that phrase before switching back again for absolutely no reason at all that Castiel can ascertain. “You’re not subtle, by the way. The talk is frequently going around about how much you stare at him.”
“Okay, ecstasy boy,” Dean scoffs, because no fucking way is he gonna let on to Sammy that he’s thinking all this weird shit, “maybe we’ll get you some glow sticks and a nice Dr. Seuss hat, huh?”
“So a nest could just be a bed?”
“You’re welcome,” Cas says with a flat voice and an oddly twitchy face.
“Well, he said angels wear meatsuits the same as demons, right? Maybe your angel stole someone you rescued from a monster or somethin’.”
“You know what I mean.”
“Crowley,” he grunts when his liney is standing beside him.
“Our brother is a convicted serial killer who recently escaped from prison,” Gabriel explains.
“No, Cas. Shut up. Mom, let’s just skip a step and pretend you already said you’re disappointed in me or whatever and then never bring it up again. You don’t have to talk to me or even think about it, and actually, I
“Oh yeah? And whaddaya think my baby brother has been doing with Dean this whole time? Between the two of us, we’ve broken every rule Heaven has at least twice over at this point anyway. And it’s only pain of death for the human, not the angel, which in this case I’m not even remotely interested in. So, you in?”
“Yeah, well, it wouldn’t be me if I wasn’t letting somebody down,” he jokes weakly.
“No, but I ain’t taking chances. Aha.” He pulls out a tie that will actually probably look
On the fourth afternoon post-murder attempt, Cas startles himself awake on the couch and is immediately relieved to be opening his eyes despite accidentally jarring his broken ribs. His breaths come much more jaggedly, not only from pain but the lingering effects of the nightmare, and he immediately wonders if it’s bad practice to take an ativan immediately on regaining full consciousness.
“Yeah.”
“You look kinda pale.”
“More electrical storms. These ones are in the next town over from us,” Sam mumbles, eyes intent on the screen of his laptop. Without looking up: “Cas, how much longer do we have now?”
“Dude.
“No, I don’t eat pork.”
It’s only been one week, which means that of the two visitors who are allowed to see a patient at a time, neither will be Dean. In another seven days, Dean will be allowed to call and visit. Until then, Cas doesn’t get to see him. But, approaching the nurses’ station where people check in if they’re not patients or staff, he is relieved to find that it’s the two people besides Dean who he most wants to see… which is odd, considering they don’t know each other.
You got this.”
“Um. I’m. Sorry?” He tilts his head to the side, perplexed. “There isn’t much I can do to rectify that, I’m afraid.” Gabriel explains the situation. By the end, Castiel has rolled his eyes at least a dozen times. “Unfortunately, it appears that Sam doesn’t appreciate your chosen love language. You should try something else. Most humans don’t enjoy being humiliated and inconvenienced on a regular basis.”
Gabriel gets a laugh out of the fact that not a single former pope qualifies for the job.
resolved itself already. You’re here.”
“Regardless of medical assistance, there’s an extremely high death rate for the person who gives birth. It’s likely we would be disposing of a body.”
“I’m going to die in the immediate future. May I leave?”
“But… they said I have a call from my brother.”
“Dude, come on. I’m fucking starving and - everything’s been way too much today between seeing all the dead people and getting locked in a room by Gabriel, okay? I’m way over my limit for mundane-crazy. Gimme regular-crazy like a hunt gone wrong or something, at least that I can actually put up with.”
“There’s a couple of abandoned farms out that way, I’m pretty sure the nest is in one of them,” Sam is saying when Gabriel pops into the car for the second time in fourteen hours.
He reaches back and pulls out a covert. His eyes aren’t
“Y’know what, I think you should go for it,” Dean says, much more enthusiastically than before. “Because then some pissant demon with an angel blade can’t just gank you with a lucky hit or whatever.”
Gabriel explains in further detail what it would mean specifically for him to become an archangel so that he can inform Dean as well, then he sits in the library and ruminates on the possibilities spread before him. His wings are fully healed and he’ll be returning to his own vessel tomorrow, so today will apparently be spent determining in what form he’ll be when he makes that return.
“So uh. I was thinking about some stuff earlier. And - Cas, I’m a fucking dumbass, okay?”
It ends up as a standard penalty kill. No goals are scored against them, but they’re trapped in their own end the entire time as the Stars pinball the puck around and take shots at their goalie.
“If I wanted to be all traditional it would’ve just been the feather, but you’re not an angel and I figured you’d get a lot more use outta the computer.”
is very gratifying.
“You damn fool idjit.”
“I think the Mark is changing you.”
“Please,” he begs, because he can’t do anything else.
“Cas, you wanna tell me just what the hell’s going on here?” Dean demands while marching back to his own bedroom.
“-ve to leave… Sam?”
“I don’t think it matters very much,” Jack answers. “Don’t worry, it’ll only hurt for five or six seconds.”
Dean can’t get the “dream” outta his head. Not just for the obvious reasons, but also because he can’t believe he said any of the shit he said last night. Especially to Future-Cas. He sure as fuck won’t be able to say any of that Now-Cas. But it also got him thinking, gave him some ideas.
Yes, Nick is Lucifer. Nobody anywhere
Dean wouldn’t ever be able to tell any of this to Sam. But he trusted Cas to hide the First Blade, he can trust Cas with this. He loves Cas.
“I’m glad you’re not a demon. I don’t do well with roommates.”
“Well ain’t that a bitch.” Dean comes into the room and rolls his eyes. “Oh, it’s you.”
“Alright, alright, I get it, I’m a dumbass,” Dean snarks, rolling his eyes. “Where are we?”
So Dean needs him. But his presence is painful.
1. Depictions of separation anxiety.
Dean gets it now.
It just makes him miss her all over again.
Regardless, Raphael has proven with irrefutable clarity that he’s at the very least disinterested in doing what’s best for Earth. He needs to be stopped, and he needs to be stopped by other angels. Crowley and desperate bargains have no place in determining the fate of Heaven’s leadership. And once Raphael has been taken care of they’ll also have to contend with the King of Hell.
“Mouthguard,”
“No thank you,” says a voice belonging to someone he one) doesn’t know very well yet and B) didn’t know was in here.
“I used to be in the army. What part of ‘I don’t wanna talk about it’ is throwing you, here?”
mean, I’m a mean drunk sometimes too but I got nothing on how he was. And.” Dean can’t look at her anymore so he watches his hands on the table instead. “He actually got
Which - great. Fucking
I'm basically at the end of the fic right now, I only have to do another chapter or two and it will be fully written. We're looking at twenty six or twenty seven chapters total.
“Touching people? No, I don’t usually mind. It’s other people touching me that I can’t stand. Well, aside from Jack. Naturally I don’t have issues with him.”
Since it’s a dream, Cas doesn’t have to touch him to put the images into his head. At least it seems like his friend is trying to pour them in slowly instead of all at once. It’s still a fuckload of information all the same. So many things that technically haven’t happened yet, but Dean feels like he’s seeing them in the past tense somehow. Opening the door to Purgatory and obliterating Raphael, the mass slaughter of loyalist angels in Heaven, sinking into the river as the leviathans finally tore free, relieving Sam’s trauma, becoming trapped with Dean in Purgatory, endlessly fleeing, pushing Dean back through the portal alone, inexplicably being back on Earth, unwittingly obeying another angel, and finally narrowly managing not to murder Dean in a dark room over a chunk of rock.
“Why do we always end up with the gay players on this team? It’s so fucking weird, there’s too many of you guys and you should spread out more.”
“Hey, hey, it’s okay.”
And then it comes to him.
“I didn’t, but you gave up way too easily.” Sam twists around to look and Gabriel makes himself visible again. “I’m gonna ask you something, and I want you to really think about it and tell me the answer when I get back to the bunker after this hunt. Cas probably has a long pre-prepared list of things about Dean that he’s in love with. Dean doesn’t have that list, but if I asked him what he loves about Cas and he was feeling uncharacteristically honest he could just come up with that stuff on the fly without having to think about it. Why are you interested in me, Gabe?” Sam deliberately refuses an immediate response. “Like I said, think about it. Tell me later when I’m home again.”
Lucifer is standing upright again, grinning and spitting blood. “Well, isn’t that just clever of them. Too bad, I
Gabe is zipping around putting up the industrial-grade archangel warding, which is so strong that Dean gets stopped in his tracks a couple times and once bounces off nothing but air even though he’s fifteen feet away from the damn symbol. In all, it takes them a couple of hours to get everything together.
Gabriel retracts his senses back to his immediate surroundings and sucks on a Tootsie pop while walking to the kitchen. There’s communal food for the refugees and then a stash of other stuff for the Winchesters - Gabriel inspects it and then empties the insides of all Sam’s vegetables in order to fill them with ketchup and pork gravy. Of course, upon discovery he has every intention of fixing the vegetables, because it’s not like he actually wants the guy to starve or whatever.
(See the end of the chapter for
At the top of the stairs, Cas stops when he hears someone pounding extremely hard on the door of the house. There’s no thoughts attached to the noise of the door opening until other noises follow it, noises that he knows from tv are sounds of pain.
“Yes, I see.” Cas opens one of his cookies and takes a small bite of it. “I would like to have a pet. Raphael always told me I would never be able to take care of it even if my apartment building allowed animals.”
It's important to note that for the purposes of this fic we're picturing Cas and Dean from about season 4, so much younger and scrawnier than recent canon. (Well, Dean's not really scrawny, but still lol)
“Yeah. Not my type, but definitely yours. Too bad they’ll toss you if you try to get in his pants, right?”
“Oh. Uh. Great, that’s…” He stares at Castiel. “…really convenient.”
“Your last coach was cool with that?”
are sent to the red line for the faceoff to open the period. Castiel is seated between Crowley and Kevin.
“I feel like a walking pile-driver,” Dean comments as they stalk through the factory, making one final pass to check warding and the positions taken up by the apocalypse-world soldiers.
On the seventy sixth morning, Cas wakes up in Dean’s bed like he has for the past several days. The difference being that this time Dean is also present, spooned from behind and holding him. This immediately gives Cas a dopamine boost when he opens his eyes because it reminds him that Dean is alive and, physically speaking, approaching wellness again.
For those of you who don't follow my
“I thought you’re all about not meddling in shit,” Dean comments as he turns his head to look.
“Uh…”
Dean frowns deeply. “What? Why?”
“You’re missing the point. I think you may be missing the point on purpose.”
“Why do I feel like there’s a ‘but’ coming?” Dean grumbles.
“Of course.” He’d like for Dean to trust him and extends an open hand. “I can heal you-” And Dean charges. Human children are very small and quick, though Castiel could stop this and simply chooses not to. A knife is produced from some hidden area and speared through the upper torso of his vessel. He can’t help being amused by this development. “I shouldn’t be surprised by this. You did the same thing when we met the first time.”
They’re silent for some time after that. Castiel recalls with a great well of sadness what happened in Lucifer’s crypt, how Dean had reached him at the last second and loosened Naomi’s hold just enough to interrupt her using him as a weapon to commit murder with.
“It’s just a spirit, Sam, okay, and it’s not the first one to be able to read people’s minds. Okay lemme guess. You were
Because he doesn’t think he could forgive anybody but Cas for this magnitude of dumbassery and such enormous mistakes. But this is Cas. Cas has always been a special case, the exception to his rules.
Shit.
“I don’t give a damn how ‘appropriate’ you think it is, you could’a just gave him one’a them blankets in the first place,” Dean snaps. He sounds like the tranquilizer has worn off.
Ooh, so we're doing this again - if any of you also read
The thing is, Castiel doesn’t blame Dean for this. But that doesn’t mean there’s no blame to be had at all.
“I need to talk to you about something.”
It wasn’t a god damn date, okay? More like… emergency damage control or some shit. He’s a weird guy and I didn’t know if he’d get all blabby about it.”
“No.”
It takes way too long to walk up this damn hallway - there are a couple doors that Dean thinks for a second might be the one he’s looking for, but the first one has the wrong death year and the other has the wrong date of birth.
“Well, you should, bro. Because I actually do kinda need your help with something as it turns out.”
Sam shakes his head. “An archangel wants to date me. Can my life
“Yeah, usually, I just figured… y’know what, it’s not important.” Dean’s not interested in unpacking all his trauma right now. “Hey, you want another sandwich? I gotta tell you something but if you’re hungry that can happen first.”
Cas stares at him. “Why?”
There’s a whiteboard and the nurse running the group - a different nurse from the one who took him here - draws a line with a marker. On one end, the number -10, in the middle the number 0, and on the other end the number 10.
“You’re welcome.”
“It doesn’t have to be. You deserve to be loved and cared for, Dean. And you deserve to forgive yourself.”
“I’m not hungry.” It comes out of his mouth even though he didn’t think to say it, but he doesn’t care and walks quickly back to his room. Dean is right where Cas left him. “I’m back now.”
“Yeah, I bet.” Dean scoots his chair right up to the side of the cot and slips one side of his flannel off, then pushes up the sleeve of his undershirt. “Can’t really see it anymore, but… already says ‘property of Cas’ on there, right?”
It seems fortunate that the other one isn’t nearby at the moment. She’s not in any mood to deal with the antics of two emotionally spastic mortals at the same time. At the sound of her wings, Dean is instantly roused from slumber and leaps from his bed with a gun in his hand. Naomi is vaguely amused by this. He can’t do anything to her and they both know it.
“Then can you read something else?” Jack requests.
The bitchface dissolves into mild surprise, and Sam accepts the food after tossing his duffel into the corner. He sits in his desk chair and starts taking bites. “So I’m guessing you do actually have an explanation for me, because you probably wouldn’t be lurking eagerly in my bedroom if you didn’t.”
106 subscribers - the first time I kept track of this on a fic, I stopped visibly counting after a hundred, but by the end of that one my number of watchers was 155. So, I wonder if I can also be interesting enough with this fic too to pass 150? 👀
“Yeah well maybe a world that doesn’t have you in it isn’t one I wanna live in, Cas,” Dean whispers, obviously working not to let his face crumple. “And you didn’t even gimme the chance to say it back.”
Castiel reads into the minute expressions and gestures of his favorite human, seeing the underlying truth that Sam seems to miss. Dean is conflicted on something, trying to put the pieces together without a reference picture.
Miraculously, Dean is also writing something down, which Cas didn’t expect. He’d thought his friend would sit and refuse to participate.
“Yeah, okay. Cas, you’re
Dean comes over and grins down at Jack. “Hey, kiddo, what’re you doing here?”
In total, practice doesn’t go badly at all in Dean’s opinion; they’re a little bit stiff, sure, but that’s pretty standard for their last practice between the end of preseason and the beginning of the actual season when they’ve got new faces and last-minute trades. Dean’s opinion doesn’t matter, though, and before they go back to the locker room John makes damn sure they all know that they better work harder during tomorrow night’s game than they did this afternoon.
The quiet footsteps of a nurse in the hallway alert them and they both lie down and pretend to sleep while she checks on them. Cas sits up again once he’s sure she left.
A brief pause. “But you’re okay now, right?”
“You should feel loved, dammit.”
Is the ambulance for him or for Gabriel?
Castiel can feel Naomi and her subordinates searching frantically for him, giving chase. But he chooses where he lands. It should take them some time to discover his whereabouts, as well as a great deal of effort, which means he has space to recuperate and plan.
“Yeah, well, Future-Cas was also bouncing around all over the place fixing shit before he came here. I didn’t figure it out right away or anything, but still.”
Castiel rolls his eyes. “I still don’t understand why this is such a big deal.”
Cas’ meddling it would’ve just ended up with them having a long-ass and awkward as hell conversation about him being Something Other Than Heterosexual.
“I can if you want, yeah. What kinda pie do you like?”
He gets up briefly to find a carton of orange juice in the patient fridge, and apparently five feet is enough distance for people to believe he can no longer hear them somehow.
Not that it matters now, of course.
They hesitantly separate themselves from each other and stand up from the couch. Cas knows that he should finish the burrito but he’s lost his appetite, so instead he gets Dean to open a Capri Sun for him. Capri Suns are one of about five things he can still mostly manage on his own, because he can pinch the pouch between his thumb and the splint with no ill effects. At this moment Cas appreciates one of his own habits regarding shoes for a similar reason - when bought, tie them once tightly enough to keep them on but loosely enough to put on or remove them without needing his hands. For one thing it’s more expedient, which was the initial logic back when he learned to tie his shoes in the first place, but now it’s invaluable.
Crowley gives Castiel an absolutely venomous glare (one of the few expressions he can recognize more or less reliably) and spends the rest of the bus ride arguing with her. Since he’s no longer able to harass Castiel about stupid things, Castiel is counting this as a victory.
“Fifteen, approximately.”
But Cas catalogs other things about Dean - his sharp green eyes, his hair which depending on the light can be either light brown or dark blonde and is a grown-out version of a typical military cut. And how much bigger he is than Cas, how much stronger. There isn’t a significant height difference between them but Dean probably has fifteen pounds on him.
“And you think I wouldn’t also have done that?” Cas challenges desperately. “I wish I could’ve done more and I wish I could’ve done better, and I still maintain things would’ve turned out much worse if I’d stayed put and done nothing. And putting all of that aside, Sam has also taken actions that upset you on a large scale, but you get over it eventually. Why am I held to a different standard?”
Cas naps for about an hour and fifteen minutes, and once he starts grumbling and stretching Dean sits up a little straighter.
be okay. Awesome. How often has ‘should’ ever worked out for us, Sammy?”
“So setting aside that idiot for a second,” he says, loosely gesturing at Prior-Castiel, “do you
He trembles and his eyes sting, so he closes them and turns his head so that he’s facing into Dean’s neck instead. Dean strokes a palm down his back a few times, like with a cat. And Cas never wants to let go of him.
if he’d just stopped and thought about a couple things for five damn minutes.
“Oh yeah? What?”
“Hey, there’s the birthday girl!” Dean dramatically kisses her neck and she squeals with laughter. His eyes catch her hands. “What’s this?”
“Whatever.” It pops in his head randomly. “Cas, you gotta promise you won’t interrupt me for like the next… two minutes. I gotta say some things and if you stop me I won’t be able to.”
“What was it like?” Sam asks.
“So does jerking off, that don’t mean you should be doing it in the middle of a game,” Dean snorts.
will never go up there and he knows it.
Dean gives him one of those dumbass expressions that refuses to be anything other than confused and annoyed instead of getting the fucking point. “What?”
He just barely manages to finish his sketch before it’s time for them to all share their work with the therapist. There’s something of a vague human form stenciled out underneath the more detailed, scrubby lines of a nightmare incarnate. And in fact Cas feels a little bit proud of how it turned out, because it’s fairly close to how they really look and now maybe, with a means to show people, they’ll believe him finally.
Castiel frowns slightly. “Alright,” he agrees.
Dean shakes his head, and - interestingly - snickers. “You got some balls, Cas. I don’t think anybody else would say that shit to him.”
“Gabe, you don’t like to be helpful,” Sam points out. “You do help sometimes but mostly you just fuck with people.”
“I already have dress shirts,” Castiel informs her. “Dean is being unreasonable and picky about my appearance for no reason.”
“The nephilim that Cas baby-trapped you with?”
Cas immediately becomes conflicted. Dean sleeps terribly and most likely won’t appreciate being disturbed, but Cas is hungry and needs to use the bathroom. Ultimately it’s beyond his control because a nurse appears.
2. Non-graphic depiction of a minor character death - Dean shoots Lucifer multiple times, but it's not seen because Castiel is too disoriented.
Castiel is apprehensive about their impending combat situation for a number of reasons. The apocalypse-world refugees will inevitably do perfectly fine, they’ve faced this exact scenario for over fifteen years before now and are well-versed in the art of killing angels and even fending off an archangel. But Gabriel, who was never intended as a general, and Jack, who’s technically an infant and not fully trained yet, will be effectively squaring off against Lucifer alone. Additionally ten angels at once, even assuming none of them are seraphim, is a very large number and there will be injuries and the odd death.
Dean hangs onto his shoulder to keep him steady - he’s pretty sure the irony isn’t lost on either of them about that. Cas is shaky and weak, but thank Jack he doesn’t actually trip or fall. Dean gets his friend settled in, all wrapped in blankets like those things butterflies grow in. And he stays until Cas falls asleep.
“We show on television to entertain people for money. All of us here are whores.”
“So Sammy had a real good idea the other day.”
“Hey, Gabe.”
he could get hit by a car or something and then Cas will never see him again and there won’t be any more phone calls that break the rules-
“What about your wrist?”
Castiel processes this. He mentally spools through any similar situation he’s ever been in or seen on tv, and arrives at the conclusion that Crowley is attempting to manipulate him and undermine Dean’s new and fragile leadership.
(See the end of the chapter for
can’t trust. Bobby and Sam who’d rather fucking murder his idiot friend instead of figuring out an actual solution to this bullshit. He scrunches his eyes shut and prays.
“He’s sleeping,” Cas whispers.
“Uh… second I think?”
“Dean,” she snaps, and he shuts his mouth again. “Sam talked to me about it already, and so did Cas.”
Castiel barrels after his liney and is ultimately the closest player when Kevin shoots the puck, which is kicked away by the goalie. He grabs the skittering puck and takes a shot himself but it gets trapped in the glove, and by now everyone else has caught up so the goalie doesn’t let it go and the whistle sounds. The D-pair stays but Castiel’s line heads back to their bench so another forward unit can change on.
“With that in mind statistically speaking flying is safer than driving in a car,” Castiel continues.
“Dean, I think it may be unnecessary for me to say this, but I meant everything I told you.”
“Yes, it matters! There’s plenty of reasons to believe that their treatment of me is at least partially to blame for my current psychiatric problems!”
“Okay, but if you’re going to be here you can’t be a distraction and you should try to participate.”
“I want you to live, Dean.”
“It won’t help anyway.”
“Okay. Alright. Y’know what, I get it. You’ve got ‘faith.’ That’s - hey, good for you.” Dean settles restlessly in the pew. “I’m sure it makes things easier. I’ll tell you who else had faith like that: Mom. She used to tell me when she tucked me in that angels were watching over us. In fact, it’s the last thing she ever said to me.”
“I like it,” Jack announces. “I don’t gotta sit on the booster in your car, like a big kid!”
Cas does the squinty-eyes again, then abruptly grabs Dean by the wrist,
but his stick breaks, sending him rushing for his bench to grab a fresh one. This gives the Stars the chance to push their way into the Isles’ defensive zone, and
Incidentally, for those of you on Tumblr, I have
“Dean.”
Gabriel is first going to offer that Raphael concede, even though the reality is it’s most likely a pointless formality. But destroying an archangel will be a monumentally difficult task, so they should exhaust all other avenues of resolution first. Gabriel’s wings are fluffed near their bases, betraying his agitation. He’s only going along with this because he sees it’s absolutely necessary, unlike his brothers he does see the wisdom of their Father’s instructions - love and care for all of creation, including and especially humanity.
“I understand that it’s considerably different for humans. There’s no threat of divine wrath involved with child-rearing in the vast majority of cases. I regret that it can’t be this way between Dean and I, and I also find the distinct possibility of my absence from our child’s life profoundly distressing.”
“Is that… all?”
“Then what was different this time?”
“There’s different kinds of angels,” Sam says impatiently. “If you were going to turn me into an angel, what kind would I end up being?”
“Yes, and I’m sorry about that. Would you still like to hear my idea?”
“Nice to know some things never change. I should’a figured you two idjits still wouldn’t get your shit together by now.”
“Yes.”
“Why is John so angry with Dean?”
Lucifer slowly begins to advance towards Gabriel again, chrome wings fanned out aggressively with every feather spread. He limps of course, his injured arm is tucked protectively against his chest, but Gabriel in no way underestimates how powerful he still is despite his wounds. Any errors in calculation at this stage will probably be fatal, especially now that he’s been grounded.
“Yes, we should go,” Cas nods, standing up and almost collapsing again before steadying himself. Dean follows him upstairs, catching him a couple times. His heart sinks into his guts as Future-Cas joins Now-Cas and Gabe in the kitchen, because this is it. Future-Cas’ eyes stay on him for the last few seconds. “Be well, Dean.” And the three of them fly away.
Subscription count is at thirty eight. I'm having feelings of Joy about this ^_^
“And how did you lose the contract with an Original Six team, to be here with us?” Crowley sneers. “That isn’t considered a downgrade?”
And you have no idea you made this attachment until it's way too late, and when they go you'd be less crippled if a bunch of your fingers got chopped off. It's not reserved for "romantic" attachments, either. It can be entirely platonic or familial, too, with the exact same impact. So I'm leaving it in, because I have these moments. And they never get any less hard or humiliating.
Cas frowns. “Incidentally, I told both of them several times not to. But it was essentially Gabriel who was responsible. Dean only sat back and laughed while watching him do it.”
A note on the Moms Trip mentioned at the beginning of the chapter - this is something the Bruins do, and I have no idea if the Isles also do it because I don't pay very close attention to their behind-the-scenes stuff. However, small things like this seem like a good idea to include in the fic whether or not the irl Islanders do them because believe it or not but hockey teams do more than just play hockey.
Dean opens his eyes. “How’s Cas?”
Dean is severely injured, so much so that he should absolutely not be out of the hospital and approaching a dirty motel with Sam. But more importantly Dean is also critically demoralized and depressed. Even from a distance, the psychological pain radiates so strongly that Castiel’s wings droop and his legs almost buckle. Tracks of moisture leak down his face before he regains his faculties and halts his vessel’s physical reactions to the situation.
It’s him and Benny and Harry and Ed who go out first, which is… not great. Normally for a four-on-four Dean and Benny are with Cole and Crowley, but with Cole boxed that can’t actually happen. Plus, with the intermission to calm him down, Dean’s pain isn’t being dulled by the adrenalin of play anymore and it feels like his entire lower arm is screaming at him. The only reason he can keep his hand on his stick at all right now is because his gloves naturally keep his fingers in a loose grip just by the way they’re designed.
“No, not like-” Castiel rolls his eyes yet again. “Gabriel, I advise you reexamine your knowledge of Sam as a person. Find something he enjoys and gift it to him, I’ve seen it be very successful on television. Humans like inanimate objects, especially shiny trinkets.”
to do than the first one. Turns out my hockey playlist is great to listen to when writing epic battles between pissy archangels. As a sidenote, Dean in Dad Mode TM is possibly my favorite version of him ^_^
So Dean’s pretty much demoted to a witness. He sits, he watches. Nurses and less often doctors come through the room. They check monitors, write shit down, move Cas so he won’t get bed sores (whatever the hell that is), change the IV bags. Sometimes they do scans or whatever on him and have the same random-ass and nonsensical conclusion. Cas’ brain seems like it’s behaving the same as a sleeping person, which means there’s no reason for him to be completely unresponsive the way he is. None of the medical staff can figure out why.
“Alright,” he agrees, whispering. Illness comes so unnaturally to him and it’s not worth the effort to argue, or to tell his boyfriend the truth.
“Ah, that would be true,
“Dean-”
Castiel flexes his wings and flies into time. He knows his next step: he must warn Dean.
“Then for the love of Dad, get into a corner or something where you’re safer!”
“How long you been locked up by now?”
” Dean groans, clearly in agreement with Castiel’s feelings on the matter. “Did it have to be you?”
“It’s already less itchy,” Jack agrees. “Who grooms your wings?”
On the note of Charlie's complaints during her conversation with Dean - I am a gay trans guy, TERFs please kindly fuck off and die :) If you are a TERF reading this, you may take your misunderstanding of biology/psychology and your oppressive politics and your thinly-veiled white supremacy and your lack of empathy for other human beings to somebody else's fic, because I won't have you here.
There’s wing oil soaking through his shirt again and he doesn’t even have time to fucking change it first, which… great. Having something super uncomfortable to distract him during a fight is
“Well, it’s not gonna be
“Yeah, I know.”
“Really? That’s it? You don’t have
“Because you’re my friend, Dean.” Castiel debates briefly and decides not to share what, exactly, Dean had said that stopped him. He’s going to keep it to himself, treasuring and mourning the words equally. “You never begged for your life. I think you thought that I would succeed, but you also essentially refused to fight back because you could see that I wasn’t myself and that I had no say in my actions. And you… forgave me. I don’t think I’ll ever stop being amazed at the human capacity for forgiveness, especially considering that I still didn’t deserve it regardless of extenuating circumstances. I haven’t forgiven myself for it and I never will, but you still did.”
“Now I
Dean has about two seconds to make this choice, probably. His instincts say Cas is telling the truth but his broken trust says Cas is lying. Dean’s been a hunter for most of his life, though, so instinct always wins. He shucks his jacket and drops it on the circle so that Cas has just enough space to step through, and right as Cas mojos the rest of the flames to nothing the door is ripped off the panic room. Shit, Bobby’s gonna be pissed about that.
“Would you still think that if you were around when I was nineteen?”
to. Maybe Cas will stay if he does.
“Would you like my opinion, Dean?”
“I’m not sure that I want to,” Cas confesses. “I know what to expect here, it’s predictable and stable most of the time.”
While they’re busy arguing with each other, a patient-demon passes by. Cas hides behind the fridge.
He doesn’t have an answer for that, either. It’s already weird just being able to
“Because it looks fun! Plus I wanna be like my daddy.”
It’s not coherent, at first. Dreams aren’t really coherent most of the time anyway. It’s just pictures, little clips of things.
For an uncomfortable moment Dean stares at him while slowly taking a bite of the eggs in question and chewing in what seems to be a deliberate manner. Cas feels fixed by those green eyes and doesn’t dare move. Ordinarily, Dean makes him feel secure. But now, Cas is suddenly very afraid of him. It’s discomforting and unexpected and he doesn’t appreciate it.
“I ain’t saying it was the right thing to do, Dean. I didn’t know better. If I thought it would’a helped, then yeah, you betcher ass I would’a brought it up. It ain’t like we can go back and try again.”
“Why do you have so many bad dreams?”
“Okay. So, we’ll try and figure that out for you, too. Bobby, you remember anything in your books that matches up with what he just said?”
“Thank you.” Castiel pulls the padding out of his shin guards with the awful noise of Velcro ripping away from itself and drops them in the pile with his compression layer, his skate socks and the royal blue shell of his pants so that they can all go in the washing machine. “I don’t know if I like this team,” he admits, peeling the sweat-absorbing pad out of his helmet and throwing it away. “The coach is overly-critical and the center on my line is insufferable.”
“Why?” Cas wonders.
The frown becomes a scowl. “Cas, if you’re gonna say that you changed your mind and you’re gonna give her up to the angels-”
Dean buries his hands in Castiel’s feathers. His grace instantly reacts to the contact, flushing into his wings and seeking out the familiar cozy warmth of Dean’s beautiful soul. In the immaterial realm, hidden from earthbound creatures and further buffered by the veil, electrical currents crackle and leap throughout Castiel’s trueform. This miniature version of the human that his grace has so deeply bonded with is in tactile communion with a fragile part of his being, yet there’s nothing dangerous about it at all. The only dynamic at work here is one of innocence and wonder, of indulging curiosity and a sense of growing amazement. Castiel has never allowed a human to touch or even fully witness his wings before. How fitting that it should be Dean, any incarnation of Dean, to be the first - and likely only.
“In four weeks the splint comes off, once I have my hand free a long list of things will be considerably less difficult.”
“Alright.”
“Have you tried your breathing exercises?”
“I know that,” Cas huffs. “But it can definitely be a starting point. For the sake of offering you some perspective, consider for a second how much I love Jack.”
“It’s not that simple,” is all he can come up with.
“Dean are you gay?” Cas blurts out, unable to stop his mouth from making the words.
“Oh, aren’t we all.” He grins at Jack’s blank look. “About what? You gotta be more specific, kid.”
He finds his voice again. “What, Cas.”
“Actually we didn’t know that,” Sam mumbles, and at least the bastard looks guilty about it.
And very suddenly, he has the answer. He can’t correct all of it, of course, because events will need to proceed to a certain point. But he may be able to undo arguably the greatest wrong he’s ever perpetrated against his friend. He just has to find a way to do it.
“You got a problem, man.”
“Are you okay with that?”
“Good. Um, don’t tell him about this conversation either, it won’t help him.”
Cas rolls his eyes. “Not very closely, no. It’s too depressing.”
around back then, I do know that I wouldn’t have let him hurt you for it.”
get used to actually hearing that. “Yeah, I know.”
“Gabe what the hell!”
But it’s the most unexpected fucking thing that rears up to bite him in the ass - Sam and Eileen don’t know he’s eavesdropping, because they don’t know how good he’s getting. Which is on purpose. He wanted to give his little brother and his little brother’s girlfriend a nice surprise for once. Which means they’re talking right next to him assuming all he can say is “yes,” “no,” “thank you,” and “fuck off Sammy.”
“Well, Dean would probably starve to death or chew off his own arm first and Cas would just stand there and watch him do it without saying a damn thing.” Gabriel shakes his head. “Alright, this might be the only time you hear me say this, but we gotta be serious for a few minutes - you’re learning to fight.”
“I doubt it,” Castiel cedes, setting the cloth aside and reflexively tucking his wings to his back while pulling on a clean t-shirt and flannel of Dean’s choice. “What can I possibly do that you can’t, Gabriel? You’re several hundred times more powerful than I am.”
Anna laughs.
“I suppose you’ve already seen the rumors circulating about you on Twitter.”
“Sure does!” Gabriel says before cheerfully cramming another pastry into his mouth. “Ah, don’t worry. Doesn’t affect us.”
He can’t fucking believe he just said that. This is stupid. This is so fucking stupid. Except that something’s nagging him, in the back of his mind. It’s the same feeling as when food gets stuck between his teeth and he has no toothpick to get it out, that there’s something
“So angels don’t date or have pet-names and shit? Or - wait, you’re all siblings, right? I guess that’d be weird.”
Dean closes his eyes.
Crowley moves sideways with it, looking for an open passing lane, and ultimately bumps it back over to Castiel, who circles around the back of the net because he has no other good choices as far as movement. Benny is open so Castiel sends it to him and the puck pinballs for a few seconds between Islanders after that, landing with Kevin, who shoots. It bounces hard off the goalie’s blocker but mostly by sheer dumb luck Castiel is there, scooping it up and messily slapping into the net under the goalie’s elbow; 3-0 Islanders, now. He fist-bumps his teammates while skating back to the bench.
“Well that’s… that’s great, Cas. Can you get Dean up front for a second so I can kick his ass?” Sam grumps.
“Hypothetically!”
“Nope, his got put in the rafters back in ’09 during my rookie season.”
“I fuckin’ hate this,” Dean complains.
The dynamic of their routine doesn’t chance in any drastic way after that; they get out of bed and go into the kitchen, and Cas sits at the table while watching Dean cook. It’s something Dean is fantastic at, too, and Cas enjoys observing him at it. The additions of shredded cheese and small pieces of mushrooms and onion powder (because it’s the texture, not the taste, that’s an issue) into the egg seem almost artistic when performed by Dean’s clever fingers.
“I understand. I don’t either.”
“They’re not…
“So cherubim have pink wings. No, I’m not kidding.”
Dean chuckles. “Yeah. He’s a great kid.”
“Okay.”
Dean stares at the pages without actually reading them, thinking hard. He
crying, apparently, which gets both their faces wet. But Cas is going, the feather will dissolve. This, Dean can keep. It’s one’a those things that’s just impossible to ever forget about.
“Are you guys gonna let me in on this or should I just go?” he asks, able to make most of the words with his hands while he says them.
“You can’t,” he insists. “There’s no ‘helping,’ I promise you. I’ll be pulled into the veil. It’s impossible to know how events will proceed after that, but ultimately an infant will appear in the realm of the material world. I… may or may not return as well.”
Cas never noticed just how many potholes and bumps are present in the roads until now, feeling every single one of them jolting his broken bones as the ambulance carries him to the hospital. Arriving at the emergency department, he’s somehow forced to wait even though he’s in so much pain that he’s not ambulatory and almost can’t breathe as a direct result of his chest injury. So he sits for almost an hour until the nurses shuffle him into a wheelchair and put him in a patient cubicle. With him not breathing correctly, they see fit to administer him oxygen from the wall hookup - which is a challenge considering his broken nose.
This culminates in Gabriel telekinetically pinning him to the spot on his back. Prior-Castiel watches in silence from a distance while layers are pushed aside to bare Castiel’s abdomen, up until the point where Dean’s undershirt is visible and he turns away with a despondently jealous expression. Castiel makes his best effort to hold still, but the molecular bonds of his vessel’s flesh are severed indelicately and he can’t stop a scream as the Tablet is wrested free. It tears small pieces of his grace out with it when it goes, not enough for him to miss but sufficient to cause even further pain.
“Oh my god,” Sam half-laughs, immediately switching to his
“No way, I’m flattered,” Gabriel insists. “I always put in all that time and effort just for you, why should I be mad when you’re finally returning the favor?”
“How so? If it’s not him, then who?”
Trigger warnings:
Dean is looking at him funny.
“You’re such a fucking sap,” Dean teases.
You said you’re an angel.”
To destroy a soul is not to obliterate it entirely, but rather to torment and claw at it until it’s something unrecognizable as human. Sam’s soul had been destroyed before Castiel had lifted the scarring onto his own mind. Dean’s soul was destroyed twice, when Castiel first rescued him from the Pit and when he’d been on the cusp of fully morphing into a greater demon under Crowley’s attentions. And Castiel can see it happening again, it’s almost reached the last stage before full-blown corruption. He’s not sure Dean can survive being returned a third time so it’s critical to stop the progression before that point.
“I don’t know.” At least she’s honest. “But if I
“He’s not my boyfriend,” they both manage to shout at the phone in unison. Cas rolls his eyes. “Are you sure you’ll be alright by yourself, Gabriel? You have a much more severe concussion than I do,” he points out.
Today is the fifty seventh day in this hospital.
“Thanks, Cas.”
“I was talking to Michael earlier, we both have a bad feeling about it. It could be a good idea for you and Gabe to stay somewhere else for a few days.”
Castiel prays that Sam will hold his tongue.
“I don’t care.”
“Yes?”
Sam mentally assembles those pieces and fills in the parts that Cas left out. “You got tortured and lobotomized.”
“I don’t know. Likely several dozen, including my family and everyone at the previous hospital where I was interred.”
when he won the puck, because
“What?”
“I need to tell you something. You’re going to get very upset with me very quickly.”
“Dean, I couldn’t. And I only have a limited reserve of strength to work with so please don’t waste time on being upset. I’m sorry. Dean.” He places his hands on Dean’s wrists, very gently. “I want you to live.”
This is their child. They should get to name it. There’s only one which comes to him that Dean can possibly find acceptable.
“One thing you should really understand going in, it’s probably not going to happen that you’ll be allowed to have agency over yourself. You’ve been experiencing recurring episodes of psychosis which so far isn’t controlled by medication or therapy, and that combined with your autism means you’ll have a really difficult time proving to anybody that you can take care of yourself without some kind of help. Are there any other family members besides Raphael who you’d be more comfortable having agency over you?”
“I didn’t think he actually spoke Enochian.” He sounds thoughtful. “Is he fluent?”
Dean. So I just think you should stop trying to make it into one.”
“Damn,
“Dean. Dean, I’m trying to fix all of that. I’ve spoken to my prior self already but he refused to see reason. I recall you telling me, on learning of my treachery, that I should’ve come to you for help instead. That’s what I’m doing now. You must help me find another way and prevent all of this from happening. And if I can stop the leviathans from being released, if I can stop myself from making this mistake, the world will be better for it. Your life and Sam’s life will be better for it. Heaven’s power struggle will cease and Crowley won’t discover the Tablets and attempt to exploit them.” Castiel at no point breaks eye contact with his friend. “Dean, please help me fix this. Naomi tried to make me kill you and she almost succeeded. I need to stop that, too, because being in the past now I can’t bear the idea of you going through that again. All of it is my fault and I don’t know what to do.”
Except for that one time. That one time that Dean really doesn’t want to think about.
“No.”
I figured you wanted the stress release,” he shrugs. “Both our brothers have been driving you up the wall, right? I’ll step in if it goes too far sideways for you, but I think you got this and chopping up some fang will give you all the happy brain chemicals.”
post-match speech, and then goes to meet his family.
Dean’s cautious about it. After twenty two years of chasing the supernatural, he knows he shouldn’t just run over and grab it, it could be cursed or hexed or whatever. He pulls out his knife and pokes it with the tip of the blade. Nothing happens. Something about this damn feather feels weirdly familiar, too, like he’s seen others like it before even though he knows he hasn’t because he’d fucking remember that if he did.
Dean’s arms come up around his neck, small face burying in the feathers of his wing. “My mom’s in Heaven, right?”
” Sam drags him from the floor to sit clumsily upright. “Hey, you okay?”
“He does very often, I wouldn’t necessarily say ‘always,’” Castiel says. “The team is extremely demoralized, especially the rookies. I’m frequently stepping in and fighting him on a variety of issues and I won’t be surprised if I’m traded again when my contract with this team expires.”
“Exactly.” Gabriel pulls a second candy bar out of his jacket and slips it into the shirt pocket of Cas’ pajamas. “Here, for later.”
“Dean-”
Castiel recalls that word from when he brought Dean back to 1973 and struggles not to roll his eyes. “I still don’t understand that reference, but no. Angels can bend time when the situation demands. I’m not here to hurt you, Dean, I promise. Please let me heal you. You almost hit your head hard enough to get a concussion, and I feel concerned about it.”
“Well in that case, you had better go find Gabriel.”
“Fortunately, we aren’t playing the Rangers until next month, so I’ll have plenty of time to adjust,” he comments, meticulously pulling up the bright red
“Nah,” Gabriel grins. “C’mon, we can get to work on the next batch of angels upstairs. I suddenly realized this afternoon during my third chocolate cake that we should really do this crap at night when the humans don’t need us anyway.”
over something. Castiel feels completely unsympathetic because he’s almost positive that
“What, Cas? Whaddya want me to say, huh? I can lie if that’s what you really need.”
“Are you stupid?” his teammate snaps.
He’s why one of your
following shortly after. Castiel sprints into position to take away a passing lane while Benny goes after the forward currently possessing the puck, which naturally doesn’t end well for that particular Oiler because Benny won’t be moved in any direction he doesn’t choose to go. Benny is a D-man’s D-man, always solidly in the way of the opposing players and readily backing up offensive teammates wherever he’s needed. He’s even better when he’s got Dean to work in tandem with, yet another in a list of a thousand reasons why they all can’t wait for their captain to come back to them in just over a week.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Yeah, I’m here.”
Why, exactly, has it not occurred to him until now that he should really bring his medication with him when he leaves the house? His arms begin to tingle and his lungs stop working, and Cas abandons his groceries in order to flee back to his Tacoma in the parking lot. If he’s in his truck, he can lock the doors and know he’s safe, because even though it sometimes seems like there’s a camera hidden in the passenger seat spying on him he can at least be sure there are no demons there. That should be enough for him to make it home again.
Dean has no fucking idea how he should do this actually… thank god (heh) Sammy’s not here to see it and make fun of him. He puts his hands together and closes his eyes like in the movies.
“I bet you already gave him hugging privileges, didn’tcha?”
“Of course it is, Feathers, when else can I have him trapped and at my mercy?”
“Great! That’s great, that buys us more time. Cas, I don’t think you’ll actually be here that much longer, maybe a couple more weeks… a month, tops. I was having a conversation about it with your psychiatrist over the phone yesterday and he said that you’ve improved a little bit about separating what’s delusion from what’s real, which is really good. So once you’ve got a handle on that, you can be discharged.”
“And you’ll be there the whole time, right?” Dean asks.
“Aren’t you going to eat your breakfast?”
It’s an overused expression in books, to cut tension with a knife. Cas assumes this is how such tension feels, but if forced to hazard a guess, he’d say that something along the lines of a chainsaw would actually be needed for any cutting action to be successful at the moment. But it isn’t a bad tension. Can Dean also feel it?
