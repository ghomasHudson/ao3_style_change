And then he heard the gently click of the front door unlocking, his breath catching in his chest as he reached up to push it open-
So Steve had stayed there, as one hour melted into two, and the sky behind him faded from azure blue to candy orange, waiting for the moments when he could catch a glimpse of Tony at the window…

As unlikely as that outcome was… he knew what it would look like. He could imagine himself, stopping by to see Tony a few times a week… building a genuine sort of trust,
Steve and Tony looked at one another suddenly, their brows creased in the same confusion – the same anxiety.
Until he found Tony, sitting fully clothed in a chair by the window – already turning to look at him.
“No questions. No analysing the environment. You can debrief the situation later,” and he waited until after Steve had nodded, happily, before he casually added, “but you’re not going to break it, unless you’re really trying to.”
He grabbed Tony with a speed and strength that Tony had never seen from him, one arm pulling tight across his back, the other hand roughly guiding Tony’s head into a possessive kiss – and suddenly Tony was so desperate for this that he didn’t know what to do with himself. He threw his arms around Steve, clawing frantically at his shirt, grinding his whole body into Steve as Steve tried to hold him closer. Kissing Steve back every bit as hungrily, pushing against him even as Steve forced him back against the counter-
, I can’t even… explain really. I’m just – sorry.” He sighed. “And, I was wondering if I could play the alien-sex-planet-drug-fucked card and maybe we can just pretend that never happened?”
“Okay,” Steve exhaled. “Well, the shortest version of the story is that SHIELD found me at the end of 2011. Today, as a matter of fact. And then, after that, I lived for over ten years in the 21st Century, until 2023, when you made time travel possible-”
Steve couldn’t say that even this had pulled him out of his good mood completely... He wouldn’t go as far as to call himself
measure your IQ, right?” Tony observed, in that friendly, intrigued tone he used sometimes. It took Steve a second to even hear the question over the haze of his own happiness, and when he did, he just answered it.
He thought back to his first mission with Natasha… To the fact that he wasn’t entirely sure if he liked her
That eerie feeling that something had already changed beyond recognition, and possibly in scary, unpredictable, hugely consequential ways - and he was going to carry on existing here…
An entirely different kind of smile warmed through Steve, at that. Something deeper and more meaningful. He was
“Oh…” he exhaled softly, hiding his face against Tony’s shoulder. He felt Tony’s hand card roughly though his hair, his breathing still shallow when he asked,
But every time he thought about it, he got a horrible, queasy feeling in the pit of his stomach, like when he had to hand his mother an angry letter from one of his elementary school teachers. A fear that Pepper would be disappointed in him. A fear that it would ruin something.
. But…” And Tony looked back through some of the files, his frown deepening the whole time. “…I don’t know, this whole thing reads like it was put together by someone who is mentally ill. And I don’t mean ‘this is madness’. I mean, like… The research itself is all perfectly sound, dry, research files… But the notes on these files, and the way they’ve been grouped together – and there are these, like, little monologues filed in here, as though they
to make sense of everything else. Something so strong that it had to be the point of any story it was a part of, that it had to be the ultimate priority...
A swell of affection rose up in Steve’s chest. He loved the way Tony’s mind worked, the constant search to know and learn and understand. Steve loved the way he found the interesting stories and the unique ideas and the potential of a challenge in everything he did...
Unthinkingly, Tony committed himself to those final few steps, and let himself fall into the couch as a deadweight. His legs throbbed in muted protest, and his eyes stung under the change in the light - but Tony couldn’t quite understand it as ‘tired’.
They wouldn’t pay any attention to the security pleb they were barking at. They wouldn’t even notice if one of them was on an unscheduled break, or having a nap. Steve knew, as soon as their jet landed at a secure SHIELD facility, they would let their guard down. They’d allow a minimum wage, barely reference-checked employee to wait, all alone, with such important cargo, because they felt like they were home-
He put the page back on top of the untidy pile in the middle of his desk, giving it a dirty look as he leant back in his chair and sighed-
“JARVIS, got some more files to add to your sorting pile buddy,” Tony announced, as he clicked each USB pen into place.
“Spray it in his face, it’ll make him scared of you” She summarised “Works for maybe ten minutes at a time.”
Those feelings were the reason he looked forward to nights like tonight, and felt connected to the modern world, and no longer felt like
That, fundamentally, something about his very identity was at odds with ever being as honest and as needy and as reactionary as
Belatedly, Tony realised that his chest hurt. That his breaths had been coming shallower and shallower, until there just wasn’t enough air-
It was giving into that wonderful, welcoming quality in Tony’s voice, the same warmth that he’d spent the first timeline chasing, the magical ability that Tony had to make things seem possible again…
By then Steve had reached the breakroom, which, thankfully, was empty. Therefore he didn’t have to bother rearranging his features, or trying to remember what he did for a living, or any of that tedious stuff – he could just float over to the couch, and flop out into it, and fall back into his happy little dreamworld. God, everything still felt so much better. His limbs still felt looser, and mind felt freer, and that tension still hadn’t returned to his shoulders. This was a sort of comfort he hadn’t felt in years.
Steve, cradling the back of Tony’s head as he fucked into him, kissing Tony’s neck as though he was scared that one of them would die if he stopped.
So, they made their way past many drunk-and-semi-naked people, and sat down. The fact that two men were fucking – really rather aggressively – on a couch just two feet behind theirs barely occurred to either of them. They were both far too focused on spotting Maribelle, and the prospect of ending this mission, and going home…Together.
But then, Steve didn’t really know where the hell he was. By now, he was too physically, thoroughly miserable to care about things like his surroundings and his appearance and his job. It didn’t
“…Probably pretty central to this, for them to bother adapting this much…” Tony said, still scrolling through files. “…You don’t adapt your entire system UI for someone you’ve bullied into helping you, or some toady who’s trying to get in with you. You do that when you’re working
“Please Tony, don’t.” He whispered… His hands finding their way to Tony’s ribs entirely of their own accord… “You don’t have to be sorry – you were right. You had every right to be hurt by what I did, you had every right to say it – I’m
Even though everything would probably be easier and smoother and calmer if he was high right now. Even though he knew that he’d be more confident and in control if he drank again, that he was guaranteed to feel good if he did that…

Now, as that soft, warm breeze rolled over his skin, Steve found himself thinking of the rest of the sentence.
of his before they ever met him. For the most part, Tony had avoided kissing those people… and they’d been amongst his most regretted one night stands, if not.
“Well, maybe we get talking, and we make each other laugh, and we enjoy each other’s company…” Tony began, his voice heavy and resigned. And then he fixed Rhodey with a serious look, and asked, “What then? What, he comes to visit me here, like a companion for me, or something? How long before he gets bored of that, do you think? This one room, and me with no stories to tell him, because I haven’t been anywhere, and the things I’ve been doing here are gross and disturbing? Do you think I should pretend I’m not a vampire, or tell him all about the blood drinking and watch him try not to flinch. Or worse –
He broke the kiss by accident, throwing his head back and gulping for air. And Tony just smiled at him for a second… and then glanced above Steve’s head, to where his hands were pinned… and then met Steve’s eye again, one eyebrow raised.
I don’t think it ever even occurred to me that I could just say no... I mean, maybe I wouldn’t have, in 1943. If I
you go back to doing this,” Rhodey gestured to the chaos of the workshop. “Except, this time – it’s after an interesting, funny conversation.”
to tell Tony the truth. An ominous sadness that had grown heavier with every detail Steve read, and every worst case scenario he dreamed up, until it had crushed every optimistic or pleasant thought out of his head-
And, firstly – it worked. Tony immediately felt safer… better. Calmer. Enough to think where the portal device was and hand it over, which probably would’ve been beyond him, a second ago…
He’d spent so much of the last two days worrying about never seeing Tony again, he’d rather forgotten to worry about what would happen when he
certainly resented it. They throbbed in pointed protest at having their break cut short - a protest his spine soon joined in with. It took a phenomenal effort to wipe the frustrated wince from his face before he opened the door-
into the intensity of that gaze, losing himself completely in the look of honest wonder on Steve’s face.
Oh, God, he couldn’t say it now, could he? There just weren’t words for this, there was no way to explain, no way to make Tony see-
He sat up suddenly, his hand still curled around Tony’s cock, and – mainly out of habit – he whispered,
Tony woke up with a start, feeling as though he was right in the middle of something. It took him a second to work out that he’d been dreaming…
to get it all mixed up with, with us and… But I really thought that Bucky was about to be arrested by a corrupt system and… It just seemed to matter, at the time…”
him, almost immediately on top of that spike of concern. A thick wall of intoxication that almost threw Tony backwards before it engulfed him completely. His head swam as though he’d been struck… but without the pain. Just the feeling of the floor shifting under his feet, and his vision exploding into stars, his thoughts literally knocked out of his head.
Even now, in this state of eerie enlightenment, Tony couldn’t quite make sense of that impulse… He might not have been up to feeling guilty over it, but that didn’t mean he could
Like it was written in the stars, or written in his very DNA - and, honestly, Steve didn’t know which of those was more frightening-
than three days… But there had been something nice about the feeling of hiding away with Steve like that, something that felt safe, and novel, and intimate somehow…
, a different set of associations… a different perspective entirely. And, now, Tony struggled to remember what he’d been looking at for all these months. Now, he could so clearly remember Steve hovering at the edge of the group, back when they all first moved into The Tower. That same heart-breaking nervousness, the same humbling bravery, about to have a go at engaging this confusing, alien thing –
So, before Tony could say anything else, Steve took his hand again and started walking them both down the nearest hallway. He didn’t want to do this in a lobby. Even if The Facility
Tony couldn’t picture that one, how it could end up as anything other than monstrous, how it could possibly be good for Steve in the long run.
“I’m sorry,” Tony exhaled, slumping his shoulders. “I’m being defensive. I just… this is all very new on me.”
He remembered a version of Nat that had so obviously been worth that effort. A version of her that Tony had left out of his rants, ignored in his retelling of events, and then forgotten in his rage…
A different collection of memories briefly crowded to the front of Tony’s head. The hysteria that had driven him to demolish his workshop that first morning after. The deep sense of dread he’d felt when he realised that he could just
Steve was tempted to leave it there. To be perfectly honest, mostly because he was tired, and he wanted to get home to Tony, and put this whole SHIELD thing behind him… And because he knew this wouldn’t be his last chance to reach out to Clint.
Cos, I got found out first, or I got found out quicker, or just cos there are different rules for you – I honestly don’t know, but I’m sorry.”
“Come on,” he huffed, rising to his feet. “It’s alright for you two, but I kind of want to get out of this
Instantly, he felt terrible for every word of that - and especially bad that it should be these two people who bore the brunt of it, given that they were probably the only two people on earth that had never lied to him...
Steve smiled at him, still blushing. It was pretty. Tony made the impulsive decision that ‘the moment’ didn’t actually have to end until they got back to their suite and reached down to take Steve’s hand –
And then he heard the softest little crack in Steve’s breathing… and glanced up to see a single tear slide down his face. There was a shock of panic in Tony’s chest – but the moment Steve caught his eye he shook his head,
to hurt me, because I’m not owed any more consideration than that. Really think about that as an answer.
of just having said that. Of finally getting to the fucking end of it, before someone could leap in and tell him what an ass he was…
want to do this. There was no resistance in him, no nervousness, no real belief that anything could go wrong.
“We both have nightmares about the cold,” Steve answered, carefully. “Dreams we don’t remember, but we always wake up shivering, and it takes forever to get warm… And with me, it’s because of the ice, and people kind of expect it. But no one ever thinks that the caves in Afghanistan were cold. If they ever think about you having nightmares, people would expect them to be hot and dry and dusty. They don’t know that you were freezing that whole time, that your nightmares are dark and damp and always cold. I’m guessing you’ve never told anyone that. You know you’d have to
- it was cruel, and unnecessary, and stupid.” He paused, and fixed Clint with a determined look, fully prepared to drop any attempt at diplomacy if Clint said another word-
He’d flopped out on the couch because he had to. It had been nearly twenty-four hours since he’d last sat down, and even an undead body has its limits. Limits he might have tried to push through, even now, if he could’ve thought of anything to push ahead with…
And, okay, yes, occasionally Steve’s mind drifted into excited musings about what it would really be like to have
So confident that was all he could have, accepting so completely that these were the rules and priorities of life…
It occurred to him that he should probably ask… Although, with no real sense of anxiety. He knew that there was no great secret about it. It was simply one of many details that he should probably catch up on...
All the months they’d spent building this relationship, all the work they’d done to listen and communicate and grow - months of wishing they could just enjoy what they’d built, just
“Me overreacting and being an idiot, probably,” he conceded, finally slowing his step. He glanced up at a worn, wooden bench a few feet away from them, and Steve decided to take the initiative on that one. He held Tony’s hand and led him to take a seat, trying not to sound too pushy when he asked again,
to say something?” Tony clarified, ever more confused. And then he followed that mundane human instinct to share his incredulity, glancing behind him to throw an unimpressed smirk at Rhodey.
“You know, it means so much that you actually want to make that happen - that it matters to you,” he whispered, meeting Tony’s eye.
He still didn’t have an answer to any of the questions that had occurred to him at random, all morning.
, it is this human-designed - but apparently also Varian-used - system that is delivering the drugs.” Tony clarified. “But, looking at this… all the places they’ve used a ‘hybrid drug’ they’ve labelled it – and you can tell, from the chemical formulas, where some of them are
He wished he could remember the exact wording. He still couldn’t believe that he’d forgotten the exact wording – he’d spent long enough agonising over those few short lines.
Steve and Bucky were sitting in the breakroom, sharing a few moments of comfortable silence as they cooled down from the morning workout. Bucky was lounging in the easy chair – the one he and Sam were engaged in permanent warfare over – indolently flicking through his phone. Steve was lying flat out on one of the couches, staring up at the ceiling…
know that my letter was really fucking annoying, even before this,” he spoke quickly now, like he knew he might’ve already put his foot in it. “I, uh, I mean, I knew even when I was writing it that it was coming out all wrong, and it wasn’t saying what I wanted it to say… And I thought maybe there just was no good way to say it, but I couldn’t not say anything, and I wanted to make sure you had some way to contact me, and…” he cut himself off with a sigh. There was another brave little breath, the shivering more audible now. “And yeah, I knew it was bad… But, yeah, maybe I didn’t think about… About how you’d feel, reading it. Not really. And I don’t know if that was the point you were making, but… Well, you made it, anyway.”
And then there was the briefest flash of something like panic – like he might literally be consumed by this feeling, overwhelmed by it, carried away on it so far and so fast that he’d never find his way back-
A grudging determination to turn this event into a celebration, and pretend those in attendance were a team.
than that, I have ruined my entire life, and so many other peoples, and I swear I never meant for any of that to happen and I tried so hard for it not to happen and everything I did just made it worse – and I can’t think
The way he so expertly masked his true reactions, while making no effort whatsoever to sugarcoat his responses.
Tony felt his spine straighten up from under him. His whole body froze. But it wasn’t a panicked reaction, or a shocked reaction – even though there was still quite a bit of both, going on the background of this situation. Tony’s instinct to stay still right then was more like the reaction he would’ve had if a baby deer had wandered into his workshop. An instinct not to startle Steve, not to shatter the moment… an immediate understanding that this didn’t usually happen, that this was special and important and not to be disturbed. He was suddenly so aware of himself, like he could feel every inch of his skin… that heavy warmth of Steve there at his side… And there was an elated, irrational terror in him, something that didn’t feel like alcohol and didn’t
he wanted to say, that he was completely confident he could say… That there was no reason not to say. No reason that occurred to him right now, anyway.
“Oh, wait,” Steve realised. “I was at a bar with Pepper and Nat, and Rhodey came running up to us… I don’t think he said anything about Bruce Hulking out, though…”
He just… couldn’t motivate himself through the immediate boredom of it. The topic didn’t catch his attention, so… Well, so what?
He threw his head into the pillows petulantly, fighting an urge to fling the phone to the side. Entirely hypothetically, he asked himself when this had happened to him, where the tipping point was between the normal human being he used to be and the emotional wreck that was lying here right now. Did he come out of the ice a completely different person? Had the weeks of confusion and exhaustion chipped away at the man he once was? Had he
“Literally anything that isn’t the exact thing I’m meant to be distracting them from,” Bucky suggested. Beside him, Tony hummed a sleepy laugh.
So, he followed, feeling heavy and weightless all at once… He floated along a corridor, and down a grand, ornate staircase, and through a lobby that he couldn’t remember seeing before… He and Rhodey must’ve been the last ones to arrive, because as soon as they joined the group it started to move, following Galileo out of the hotel and into the fresh air… A warm breeze rolled over Tony’s skin, tickling the hair on the back of his neck.
starting to feel more clear headed, at least compared to when he first woke up… That was… something...
“Well, thank you,” Tony smiled, eventually - sounding like he’d decided against saying something else. “But it’s okay - I mean, I get it… I know he just panicked and messed up, and I’m not even mad about it… I know it’s not the end of the world, and it’s not worse than half the shit I’ve done and… I don’t know. I should never have yelled at him like that. I guess that was me just trying to get his attention, too.”
“It’s just that I’ve spent so long imagining...” Steve sighed, glancing down at his hands. “If… If I hadn’t stopped you from hurting Bucky, if Bucky had hurt you… If
was why he was so consumed by Tony Stark. It would be nice to be able to explain that much, at least. Why Steve should find himself picturing Tony’s face all the time, without warning, and for no reason. Why he should be so confused by his own reaction – after all, if Steve weren’t poised to leap on every attractive stranger, he probably would’ve been happy to file Tony under ‘annoying but okay’ and moved on with his life. It was just that basic,
But he could still hear the words in his head, a stream of forbidden thoughts shaken free by the force of this, bursting through the pressure he’d always felt to keep them in-
He remembered arriving at the hospital. He remembered hovering at Tony’s side in the lobby, as he and Happy gleefully handed Wesley over to a nurse – Steve remembered being aware of the nervous glances he was getting from her, and Happy, and the staff pretending not to pay attention to them from behind the reception desk… He remembered not caring. Not thinking anything of it.
He must’ve been so furious as Zemo, so scared about what was going to happen, so desperate to think of something to say…
in the same way as last time. This seemed more like a perfectly human reaction to seeing someone he was scared of…
He thought of Tony’s hand on the side of his face, his thumb tracing his jaw so tenderly as he teased his lips apart-
Now, formal events were no more alien to him than any party he could have gone to - in fact, if anything, they were the events least changed by the march of time.
“Oh, right,” Scott croaked, nodding too vigorously, “right, right, cos I was only an Avenger in 2016, when I was risking everything to help you -
“It was just… all so much, then. And I know it sounds pathetic, and I’m supposed to be Captain America and I know all of us have, I mean, what you’ve been through too, and I know I can’t really say… but, I just…
“Yeah, Steve, because if there’s one thing Tony Stark is bad at, it’s telling people he doesn’t want them at his house,” Bucky cut in, sarcastically. Steve dropped his shoulders and gave an abashed little nod,
At last, his brain remembered the concept of words - providing him with one delighted voice that whispered,
But five minutes passed, and then ten. After a while, Steve’s shoulders began to ache with the effort of keeping them tense. And then, just as his eyes were beginning to burn, he heard Tony whisper, dryly,
Because Tony was arrogant - said the man who had no problem letting himself into Tony’s living room, against his express wishes, whilst being generally impatient that Tony had dared to have a life in his absence.
The specific details that Howard wanted the world to know, and the ones he couldn’t bring himself to talk about.
And he could never bring himself to hope for someone that was prepared to throw their life away for him.
“Tony, I love you, I-” He heard himself sob, not sure what he was trying to say when his voice broke again.
And then his eyes met Freddie’s, a warmth focusing his features, like he’d found something genuinely interesting-
security staff,” Sam offered, in a placating tone. “What if I distract them, while the two of you break in?”
He liked that idea so very much – on every conceivable level. Logically, it made perfect sense, and instinctively it felt so right, and emotionally it made so much feel better…
Tony’s eyes widened in surprise, and then softened in relief. He swallowed hard, clearly gathering his thoughts, and Steve was possessed of such a powerful urge to kiss him that he was already reaching out - he only stalled because Tony spoke again.
He thought of the strange sense of discomfort that he’d started to feel the last time he was with Bucky, that feeling that it was crossing a line to spend the night there, that realisation that he’d spent the whole time thinking about Tony… And maybe it was because of the night he and Tony had spent together, or maybe it was just the way the process had unfolded, but somewhere between then and now, Steve had finally reached
Tony could hope for then was that he got through to the inevitable end of this, and had his heart shattered. Far more likely was that he slipped up again before then. And then he’d have to watch Steve recoil in horror, which would hurt so much more. Or, he’d watch Steve get confused, or angry… or, the outside chance that he’d leer, and say it sounded
All these weeks into this relationship, and Tony was still overwhelmed every time Steve kissed him. There was still that delighted amazement at the strength in Steve’s arms, and how soft his lips were, and how
And then he felt Steve suck against his skin, the low growl rolling through Tony’s body along with everything else-
“So, what, that’s the end of the conversation, is it?” Tony challenged, tersely. Steve’s stomach turned to slime.
“Of course yours,” Tony promised. And then seemed to drift into talking to himself as he added “…I’d never drink anyone’s blood but yours… I couldn’t…”
been planning to use that cover; he’d already plotted out his best chance of ducking that shot if it did come, mentally watched how he could throw all four of them off balance-
...There was nothing for Steve in this moment beyond appreciating it. There was only the bittersweet privilege of getting to see it again. That was all.
He thought about talking to Tony in the same way as he might to Sam or Bucky or Nat - and before he even worked out how that was, Steve knew it was ridiculous to think of being the same with Tony.
there was a part of him that was intrigued by that. Part of him that wanted to think that it was true, that wanted to ask Bucky why he thought it – a part of him that would have enjoyed hearing this particular argument.
He felt Steve’s grip tighten, hard, his whole body tensing  as though that was the hottest thing Tony could possibly have said.
“Steve?” Pepper called casually, breaking Steve out of his thoughts… He glanced up to see that he’d drifted a few feet ahead of the group, lost somewhere amongst this sea of flower stands.
tell anyone I was a vampire. Why biting someone was just an evil monstrous thing to do, and Obie should be ashamed of himself – and now, suddenly, everything just looks so different.”
In a few moments of speed reading, he’d learned that the serum he took was entirely manufactured by SHIELD scientists, based on a few trace samples of what they believed was vampire blood, and a lot of theorising. The final product was also infused with Steve’s own blood, along with various other organic components, and quite a bit of iron-
“Yeah, see you Tuesday,” Tony answered on autopilot, watching quietly as the doors slid shut behind him.
And just as he came to this conclusion, Tony recognised the blanket that he’d thrown onto the floor when he woke up – or, rather, he remembered that it hadn’t been there, when he fell asleep. He… resented that, mainly. Probably. He couldn’t risk thinking about it.
Not thinking anything of this sudden rush of excitement, the thrilled racing of his heart, this uncontrollable grin. Just being
like this, Steve,” Tony whispered, his hands stroking firmly down over Steve’s ribs as he ran his eyes over every inch of him. “So pretty, and strong, and
managed to get a warning through to their superiors, Steve didn’t see any way their superiors could’ve acted on it-
If it had been up to Steve how to respond, he would probably have had an anxiety attack. Stuttered and babbled and said all the wrong things – probably far too many of them.
Which didn’t matter, of course. He had to finish reading it - preferably, before Tony got home this evening. How he felt about it, rational or otherwise, was irrelevant.
So, for a while, he just sat there, feeling the ground spin beneath him and the world continuing around him, and not really being aware of anything…
put aside the personal, emotional stuff between he and Tony – with the complete intention of talking about it when they got home, of course – and decide to behave professionally. He could decide not to even think about the more difficult issues until he could be sure he was in his right mind – until he could be sure they wouldn’t be ambushed because he was busy crushing on Tony Stark.
And then a shadow fell over him, and he already knew when he looked up, Steve would be there. He already had his hand held up, because he knew Steve would take it.
Clearly, whatever ‘folk dancing’ was in this part of the galaxy, it was bombastic and vocal - and extremely competitive.
Ever since that night with Steve, Tony had been so confused and conflicted and constricted. It had always seemed like there was so much context, so much worrying and repenting to do…
And Tony pulled into him hard, letting that burst of pleasure reach its peak, waiting until Steve was on that knife edge, before he whispered,
Thank you all so, SO much for reading, and for your lovely feedback - I can't tell you how much I've enjoyed writing this, or how moved I've been by the response.
Having someone to love in the way he’d always wanted; knowing that there was an alternative to the lost and lonely life he’d resigned himself to.
He took Steve’s hand… deliberately squeezing just a bit too hard. He saw that exact thrill flash up in Steve’s eyes – exactly as he knew it would. And then he tugged at Steve’s arm.
“…Okay, probably not a white supremacist,” Tony accepted with a self-aware little smile. “But you get my point. I don’t know him. In fact, the only thing I can really tell you is that he’s bad at small talk. And sort of uncomfortable to be around – and, if you think about it, kinda pushy. So, you know, he’s probably not even that likeable…” But he was increasingly aware of a dirty feeling crawling over his skin while he said this.
He wasn’t sure if it was gradually wearing off or if it was… settling in. It wasn’t like any intoxication he’d ever felt before; the side-effects weren’t easily grouped into any ‘type’ of high, and didn’t seem to be following any sort of pattern.
Steve looked up, to see Rhodey, Nat, Clint, Bruce and Nebula staring at them, through a gap in time and space. He could hear Rocket, somewhere off to the left of the portal, demanding to know what was going on, and Quill telling him to shut up.
And then his eyes caught on Tony, looking down on him, one eyebrow raised in an expression of warm amusement.
The phone was a few feet away from both of them now. Just waiting for whoever would be quick enough to grab it first.

it fairer to say that the air was actually sobering him up? Freeing him from irrational emotional impulses that he’d never had any control of, before now?
“I, uh, I haven’t had a chance to say this since, but… Thank you, for saying something to Nick, last week…”
The night he’d drunkenly called Tony beautiful, and then fallen asleep in his lap, and then felt horribly guilty about… it was pleasantly amusing, to think of it now-
“Yes,” Steve gasped, writing up against Tony’s hand. Tony fumbled at his unfastened Steve’s jeans, his entire body starting to tremble as he slip his hand into Steve’s underwear and curled his fingers around his cock. “

“Shut up Steve, I have the talking stick right now,” Bucky warned him, playfully, and waited for Steve to pinch his lips together before he carried on. “I
soft little laugh that Steve had missed so much- “Are you hiding out down here or something?” He blurted, in an poorly planned attempt to put some conversational distance between them.
“I am feeling great,” Bucky announced proudly, holding his arm out and looking at it reverently. “You know, this week was probably the first time ever that I haven’t thought about how this fucking thing works?”
As far as Tony could tell from just this part of the story, Dimitri had begun his correspondence with Demi just after he and Ottilie were bonded… a word that Tony had to admit was getting less cringeworthy each time he read it. A word that seemed so much less ominous or creepy or ridiculous, when it was being used by someone so clearly overwhelmed by love… Someone who was so damn
to the motion of it in the most basic, primal way, his hips working up against Tony’s lips, pulling Tony’s hair.
“Well, not… this…” Steve corrected, gesturing vaguely to the windows. “Sorry. I just meant… Times Square was like this, the first time out of the ice. All… Bright and big… and impossible, like this…”
Oh, there was just so much. Tony suddenly realised just how much he had to say to Steve – how much of it he still had to work out.
He let it roll up through his ribs... letting it mix with the tingling sensation that had spread all the way down his throat, by now…
he hated this so much – because it brought that day so much closer. Because it had reminded him that the whole thing was just play pretend, and had always been play pretend, even when he’d slipped into thinking of it as real.
like alcohol... “These are actually entirely natural, blended from elements found here and on earth. Compounds that don’t exist outside of The Facility, on earth or New Eden – and therefore, substances there can be no value judgement of.”
…Whether he hated himself for throwing cold water on this moment, or for falling for it in the first place.
Was yet another point, yelling for attention in the general chaos of Tony’s head. Along with a feeling of guilt, that
“No, you were doing it to put him in his place,” Steve shot back. “You were doing it because you wanted to prove that Tony doesn’t know everything, that he’s not as smart as he thinks he is, that he doesn’t see the bigger picture - not like you do. You did it because you thought he was reckless and arrogant, and because it never occurred to you that you didn’t have the right to punish him for that. You did it because you thought you could teach him a lesson, for committing the
“I’m full of surprises,” Steve blurted a response entirely at random… and then, when he realised how cringey it sounded, hastily added. “The trick is to appear very, very boring.”
Because, on the one hand, being brave enough to face what SHIELD had done to him made it impossible to hide from how badly they’d treated Tony - and the fact that he
their interactions, picking out all the little things he hadn’t spotted before, all the times he should’ve known Steve was hurting or should’ve seen how sweet Steve was being or should’ve appreciated more what Steve had done… And Tony would think what he’d do about it
Steve stepped aside to let Tony stride past him, taking the opportunity to run his eyes over Tony’s back… He was wearing one of those beautiful, expensive suits that had been tailored to hug every sweep and curve of his body. The excitement in Steve’s stomach began to simmer down into something slower and hotter, as he followed Tony through to the living room, watching the roll of his shoulders, the rhythm of his step… There was a particular spark as he noticed the black silk shirt - not only because he’d always loved Tony dressed all in black, but because he knew that Tony
The real world suddenly reoccurred to him in a horrible rush. Tony realised that he had literally no memory of the walk to this room. He’d just floated here in a haze of shock, like his brain had taken one look at the utter shitshow he’d enacted and decided,
Time seemed to slow down, and stretch… The whole world faded further out of focus, as Steve was brought closer into himself… and Tony… the two of them together, still connected in this other, separate thing…
to be with anyone but him, not just someone who would resist that temptation for fear of the consequences. Someone who’d make Steve feel like he’d
, it seemed, that less than a week ago this had been ‘his personal vision of Hell’. Whereas now, of course, just walking around the place with Steve’s hand in his made him feel slightly giddy…
That Steve didn’t know if he would be forced to watch everyone he ever cared for wither and die in front of him-
“Ah, well, allow me to introduce you to the exciting world of box stuffing,” he joked, gesturing to the papers in front of him.
Or pointing out that, seeing as standing there like the cardboard standee from a customs checkpoint apparently hadn’t worked, it might be time to try something else-
tell everyone to put safety first and to be aware of, you know, everything I could think of – but, honestly, I didn’t think of if suddenly there was a really enormous guy walking around. And then when Peter suggested the whole
good Steve,” Tony breathed, his voice low and jagged. “You’ve been so good for me, I’m so proud of you…” And he looped one arm under Steve’s chest, lifting him back onto his knees as though he were weightless. Steve collapsed into him, trusting Tony to keep him upright, already tilting his chin up, baring his throat.
“So, you want to make sure SHIELD stays operational?” He clarified, after a moment. “That’s why you want to separate the two things?”
With that, Steve let go of a breath that he didn’t know he was holding - feeling the tension melt away from his legs along with it. For a split second he literally felt unsteady on his feet-
He even liked the fact that he was having to give himself a little pep talk right now. Sitting in the car, trying to keep his hands steady and telling himself not to come across as a total stalker… it all seemed very un-Captain America like.
Because Tony had always thought that, accepting you may one day have to bend the rules didn’t mean you couldn’t want the rules to exist. Just because he’d wanted it stated, in advance, what the punishments would be, didn’t mean he’d never be prepared to risk them. And he still thought The Accords were the best of the available options, flawed though they may be. He still though the best way was to work on them, and start creating a fair set of rules for everyone. And, yes, he still thought – on this occasion – the safest hands were still their own. None of
And Steve wondered, briefly, if this ever could have happened without The Facility – if, in with all the evil and the complacency and the skewed ideology, there maybe hadn’t been a little bit of something good… If things
everyone thinks that’s so paranoid and… It’s just, sometimes you hear people say, ‘this is how Nazi Germany happened’, about some policy decision in a modern company or a Western Democracy… and everyone always rolls their eyes, because it always sounds so dramatic, and people always think they’re so far away from that… but I was there, and
“Well, did you ever think that maybe he just thought about how he was when you two met, and then he did better next time?” Bucky suggested, knowing that he wanted to help Steve out of this but still not capable of figuring out how. “...
“Oh-more-please-Steve-fuck-there-please” Tony blurted out, writhing against him, clawing at the couch. And then Steve pushed a third finger into him, working him open, deliberately seeking out that same spot again. “Fuck me, please fuck me,
He saw Tony’s features fall, a look of baffled shock welling up in his eyes – and Steve very nearly asked him what was wrong. For one whole second, Steve really had no comprehension of what he’d just said.
, Tony forced himself up. He snatched Steve’s hand out of the way, barely giving him a second to process what was going on before Tony had shifted-
He just carried on fucking into Tony, hard and fast, pulling Tony into every thrust, his face still creased in desperation. Tony choked out a sob, his grip slipping on Steve’s shoulder – not that it mattered. Steve’s grip was brutal, his body solid and immovable against Tony’s, his movements as powerful and irrefutable as a force of nature. Tony didn’t so much surrender to it as simply exist within it. There was no alternative, not even hypothetically, to letting these shocks crash into the waves of his orgasm, dragging it out, pulling increasingly sensitive sensations out of every weak and trembling inch of him.
Mindlessly, he looked down to the stack of manila files on his coffee table. The cold, heartless details designed to summarise the lives and deaths of his closest friends.
That sent a sudden thrill through Tony that he didn’t think to question. A sharp, deep instinct – something not too far from ‘
Steve still didn’t know whether Tony had been joking when he referred to the villa as a ‘nice little place by the beach’. For a start, it certainly wasn’t little. Each of the four bedrooms was bigger than Steve’s old apartment, and it was set in at least an acre of perfectly manicured gardens. Open plan and clean and minimally decorated, to Steve it seemed like an absolute abundance of
“Steve – I’m sorry.” Tony breathed, lying under Steve now, looking up at him through those impossible lashes-
An accomplished smile tugged at his lips. He started running through the individual tasks that he’d completed in the last few days - more for the sense of satisfaction than to actually check his work, but hey, it couldn’t hurt.
The nervousness in him, because he’d spent his whole life being doubted and criticised and told he wasn’t good enough, betrayed and belittled by the people closest to him…
that Tony had something important to tell him. That Tony was anxious about telling him, or excited about telling him… That wasn’t just Steve looking for excuses. That was real.
Tony pinched back an excited little smile as he broke the seal, thinking back to the last time he’d been to Anni-Vara. Making polite conversation with one of the Varian governors, smiling obligingly when she’d said that he and Steve should come to their Summer Gala. At the time, it had never occurred to Tony that they would actually
His whole body tensed as he watched Tony shift to face him, leaning closer to him as Tony raised his free hand… the nervousness melting away as he placed it against Steve’s chest, and then let it settle there…
“I… don’t even know him” Tony managed, with difficulty. “I couldn’t tell you anything about him. He just – stood there.”
that his value, and his power, weren’t directly linked to his physical strength. He could tell himself that he was more than that, and mean it.
Steve drew in a scalding breath, and used his other hand to get hold of Tony by the hip, dragging him into position, so that Tony was straddling him.
“-As guests of honour, you’ll have full access to everything, and it will be entirely your choice what you want to take part in-”
And Steve genuinely did feel like, if he started to think about it… he might end up thinking all sorts of things…
“So, what do you think, is this a back up situation?” He sighed, still talking to the back of Steve’s head.
“Okay, so, the good news is, turns out I don’t have to do as many tests as I thought,” Tony began, brightly. “I managed to get a lot of the details I need from your previous scans. There are just a few things that no one tested for yet… and a few places where I don’t trust their tests.”
new” She beamed, glancing back at her ‘staff’ with an impatient sort of affect. The blonde guy stepped forward, holding the tray up for her. “Please, allow me to recommend…” Maribelle carefully selected two shot glasses full of bright blue liquid from the rainbow of options lined up on the tray. “
In fact, it should probably be a comfort, to think that Tony had only chosen Clint because he preferred Clint’s company. That would be better than thinking that Tony just didn’t trust Steve to act as cover for him, in a dangerous situation…
But still, his feet pulled him slowly forward, his whole body leaning towards the sound of Tony’s voice.
By now it was a concerted effort to control the excited hope that was welling up in him. Steve had been hurt and betrayed and disappointed too many times to be entirely comfortable with this feeling – there was still a little voice warning against letting his guard down, reminding him to be critical, trying to emotionally prepare for the world to be pulled out from under his feet-
And, perhaps most important of all, there wasn’t the remotest question this overwhelming Tony’s self-control. However much he wanted Steve’s blood, the idea of forcing himself onto Steve was as repugnant as it had ever been.
“No,” Tony answered, with a shake of his head. “No, now I think maybe it’s okay to not feel everything you think, 100% of the time. Maybe it’s okay to feel unsure of the things you’re sure of… Maybe it takes time to break a habit that the entire world has worn into you - but that doesn’t mean you aren’t doing it. That doesn’t mean the moment you

He works out that he must take a step, or two, to end up sitting on this examination bench every day… And
“Okay.” Tony whispered back, not even bothering to visualise the corridor in question – just trusting him. “I’ll spray her, you scare her.”
Wakanda… But even then, it would be such a huge risk to have these deadly, dangerous people out there just waiting to be triggered into doing something terrible. And I have no idea what awful things might have happened if Zemo hadn’t killed them the first time around…”
“… So, sometime this evening, we do our best to break into the basement, and go from there?” Steve concluded. And Tony nodded.
comment he could possibly have pulled from the whole fucking debacle. And he’d had so many other points! Polished, practiced points that he’d carefully perfected over the last two years. Points about accountability and fairness and trust – grown up points, about professional behaviour and personal ethics. Instead of which, he’d chosen to whine about not being invited to Steve’s little team of Super Friends.
The guy strummed the lute-lele again, in a random note that seemed to have nothing to do with his tuneless intonation.
“Well… At least I feel better about the rest of the plan” Tony suggested, scanning his screen one last time before he put the file reader back into his pocket. And he glanced up at Steve, and Steve smiled at him.
– every minute of every day since then…” He lost his footing a bit when he saw Tony’s mouth fall open, his eyes widening in a mix of amazement and confusion… he was so perfectly pretty then that Steve could’ve given in and just kissed him again.
A little ripple of relief ran through his body, as that initial jolt of awareness settled into a more developed understanding of Steve’s mood.
“And because we didn’t want to delete anything if we weren’t sure what it really was… or if there were other copies of… We said we were going to back it up” Tony gave up, mid-sentence.
He observed, calmly, that this was a very good example of the sort of thing that made him anxious. He remembered, belatedly, to ask himself,
complicated. In that moment, Steve felt completely confident he knew what was going on, it seemed perfectly obvious what he should do.
And with that, in the middle of all his aimless musings, Steve recognised that he could never really go

It wasn’t just an unexpected outcome to this equation – it was one that should’ve been impossible. Something that would require a comprehensive overhaul of his whole understanding of physics…

him anything. It was enough to hope that Tony wouldn’t be offended by the betrayal, or put off by the ominous strangeness of the whole thing - Steve most certainly wouldn’t be asking him to get involved with it.
… I think the Varians have given the humans a truth serum, and they’re trying to turn it into some sort of… relaxation… drug, or something…” Tony trailed off momentarily, wondering if
He stroked a hand over the inside of Tony’s thigh, parting his legs, delighting in how easily Tony responded to him. He felt Tony’s breath catch… heard it echo in the air around them, as a hush fell over the garden like a heavy blanket. Steve could feel that anticipation everywhere.
action had all been down to this piece of technology… that he designed all alone in his workshop, and built with his own two hands… Thinking it would one day be used by the sort of person who stepped in a saved lives, for no other reason than they needed saving…
“Nat has a team sweeping the building for the human staff – they’re going to be detained for further questioning” Rhodey explained in a slow, clear voice, and Tony could tell he was simplifying this for him, “Turns out that The Guardians have some experience in this part of the Galaxy – and Zan’s found a kindred spirit in Nebula…” He paused, briefly, a little flicker of thought behind his eyes… there was clearly more to
just sat there stoically and listened, Tony would’ve ended it there. Maybe Tony wouldn’t have fallen quite so far into this fantasy, if Steve hadn’t played his part so very well…
“I love you,” Steve breathed, pressing a soft kiss to Tony’s forehead. Tony snuggled closer and brought his hand to rest on Steve’s chest.
Just kept fucking into him, keeping up the same brutal pace, the same pounding rhythm. That all-encompassing pleasure flaring up at him with every thrust, rolling though his hips and up his back and then sharpening into need again –
“Oh, Fuck, yes-” Steve barked, his hips snapping upwards, his hand clawing at the back of Tony’s head.

. And when he eventually had to break for air, Steve cupped the side of his face, and just asked, “Is this what it’s going to be like? After this? When we get home?”
The indescribable, incandescent intensity of it, the way it broke through all the numbness and confusion and made everything vivid and

happened between them – it was the story of Steve’s life. And it had led him here. Right now, Steve felt better about himself and the world than he ever had, and however he got here…
That there was still the Steve Rogers part of him, the boy who felt everyone’s suffering as his own, who couldn’t bare
That thought was enough to temper his happy demeanour, as they started the descent down to the basement.
He had finally become everything he’d always hated. Or, maybe he’d always been like this, and he’d simply been in denial… whatever. The point was, there was no running from it anymore. He was every bit as warped as all the vampire fetishists he loathed; he was every bit the bloodthirsty monster than the fairy tales made him out to be. He had literally come all over his own hand, at the very thought of Steve wanting Tony to bite him. There was no going lower than that, no coming back from it, nothing more to say.
And it meant them taking responsibility for that choice, and all the other choices that came with it.
effort to temper his hopes; to at least leave himself some room for denial, if he got anything other than the response he was hoping for…
“Not yet. We could only get a very brief look at things, while we were on the third floor.” Steve assured her –
Suddenly, he felt an overwhelming burden of responsibility… and a fierce protective instinct. He knew immediately that he wanted to get this exactly right – not because Steve thought there was anything delicate about it, but because he knew Tony did.
And even more reassuring was the realisation that… it would have been very different, if he’d killed Jesse.
The strange trance that he fell into afterwards - the hypnotic effect it had on the people around him.
And then, his phone rang – or rather, vibrated harshly against the coffee table, where he’d apparently thrown it. It was immediately jarring, and Tony snatched it up more to silence it than to answer it. In fact, it wasn’t until he heard Rhodey’s voice in his ear that he recognised that he’d just taken a phone call.
When he’d first remembered that the cult in Florence existed, and realised all the uncomfortable parallels.
He’d tried telling his brain to be quiet – which proved as effective and as frustrating as yelling at the weather.
After all this time overthinking it and trying not to think about it and worrying about it and pretending he wasn’t worried about it – and it had just happened.

Tony’s gut twisted, his face flushed with an urge to cry that he simply wasn’t strong enough to see through-
Okay. He’d gotten a little distracted there. But he managed to drag his thoughts back into focus, even over the top of this sudden surge of affection – maybe because of it. Because loving Steve as much as he did was the whole reason he wanted to do this…
to hear what Steve really thought about last night for him to know what he really thought about Steve. That he already
“Er… Oh, if I think very hard about it, I do…” Tony groaned petulantly, squinting back at the computer panel.
“No, that’s exactly it,” Tony smiled. A different smile… deeper, somehow. “And I know, actually, that’s about me spending the last twenty years in this house, not… anything else. Well, except for that being a vampire is
“The Avengers initiative was scrapped,” Tony commented bitterly… and then just carried on talking . “And I didn’t qualify. Apparently I’m volatile, self obsessed, don’t play well with others…”
He took the pillow away, and looked up at the door, expecting the room to spin when he did it – but no. It seemed at least one of The Facility’s promises could be taken at face value; he was entirely hangover free. Well, physically at least. His vision was fine, and his body didn’t ache, and his head was unnervingly clear, actually… He had no problem thinking
“Of course you didn’t…” Tony exhaled, sadly. But before Steve could put his foot in it again, Tony continued, “well, does that mean you have a plan yet?”
Tony got most of his donations under the pretence of scientific research rather than medical transfusions, so he was used to seeing it racked up in vials. He wasn’t used to it yielding under his hands like this, being able to watch it surge and swell as he held it tighter…
“Because I think, if you set a challenge to see who could find more original sources - and who could better use those original sources - I’d beat anyone in SHIELD…”

That it was probably produced or stored in a facility that makes incredibly dangerous, illegal compounds. That it was produced by people

“Do you think it’s wrong that… I really wish I knew which side she was on, before I made that choice?” Steve asked, eventually. Quietly.
When he gasped for air then it tasted sweet. A dizzy sort of elation thrummed through him along with the rush of oxygen, an immediate desire to keep chasing this, to feel more of this…

have happened next. He’d start imagining what would have happened if he’d reached up and kissed Tony again, if Tony had melted into it just as readily, if nothing had stopped him before he had a chance to get his hands under Tony’s clothes, to kiss his neck-
So, Tony had sent Pepper a half-assed lie about having bumped into a hot blonde in the lobby, simply because it seemed like an excuse she wouldn’t risk checking on. And then he’d poured himself a scotch, and resigned himself to toasting the New Year alone in the dark-
He let his head fall back, arcing up against Tony’s hand as he ran it slowly up along the centre of Steve’s chest, sliding beneath the robe to caress the warm skin beneath-
funeral, I’m sorry I’ve hurt you, one day maybe you’ll understand – if only he’d signed the fucking Accords.”
he was. How sure he’d been that Steve didn’t care about him, that there was simply no way they could ever move past what had happened in Siberia, that they would never even be friends again…
But now here they were. Sitting right there in front of him, where he couldn’t ignore them or deny them - reminding him of all the issues he was trying to draw a line under, and all the questions that he should have been asking himself
Even this panicked, physical urgency felt good. The increasing need for oxygen, the pain of desperation, the wonderful abandon of it.

There was an aimless, philosophical musing about where the morality was in that… where the moral debates were, even… Whether that compliance made him a nice guy, or just kind of a doormat, actually...
It was such an overwhelming experience. Tony was gripped by a bottomless, physical horror. A level of terror that he’d never conceived of,
And, even over the top of his razor sharp focus, some tiny little part of Steve’s mind noted, for later consideration-
by what Steve had done, because of their personal history. It would’ve been perfectly reasonable for Tony to say he’d never love Steve again, after what happened. It actually
But Steve wasn’t scared of any of that, the way he used to be. He didn’t feel so alone with all of it anymore. He didn’t feel so entirely pressured by all of it, so overwhelmed by any of it – so completely defined by those parts of it.
And then, as he was beginning to revel in the pleasant surprise of not feeling bad… he watched it heal.
He blinked his eyes open in time to watch Tony free his other hand, Tony’s fingers working in that same clever, fluid way even now that they were trembling slightly. Steve surrendered his arm to gravity, letting it fall into the same happy stupor as the rest of him, his eyes still lazily fixed on Tony…
“Hm? Oh… Janine? Last night, she called them Varians…” Tony remembered, turning his attention back to the file reader, just wanting to check-

. He just couldn’t stop this now. There were too many words, too many feelings, that had been packed in behind this wall he’d built, and now he’d broken through it-
maybe it’s more awful, losing him now… But maybe that’s just the price, and maybe that was worth it – until that’s not the whole price, and I’m actually just going to keep paying for this-”
Steve was so perfectly contented, so deeply and completely comfortable. His mind was calm, and mostly quiet – except for the occasional happy observation that he allowed to just drift through.
That hot, irritable realisation that he was questioning whether they should follow the rules, or if, actually, the safest hands were still their own…
something more, for vampires. An additional level of closeness and commitment and trust. Another layer of attraction and desire, on top of all the others… something that affected his mind and his body, his thoughts and his emotions, just like every other part of it.
paper trail. The best forensic accountants can’t figure out how these people pay their water bill – even the Stark tracing programmes found nothing,” and he paused to watch that catch Tony’s attention. Which, of course, it did.
“Well, it’s been a challenge,” he sighed, deliberately keeping his tone somewhere between neutral and upbeat - the ‘small talk’ voice, designed to maintain a conversational distance. “But I think I’m finding my feet with it. And, I have to admit, some things are better now. Food's a lot better, we used to boil everything. No polio is good.”
“Well…It’s not quite so simple as using her own drug against her. I’m going to have to engineer this, using the other drugs we have access to. And she’s a completely different species, and I’m not familiar with the biology… So, yeah, this isn’t quite what Scott did. This is me suggesting I can maybe
“I’m going to be gone for like a minute, okay?” Tony told him warmly, leaning in a little closer. “I’m going to go get water. Okay?”
Steve grinned, and stood up – suddenly imbued with too much energy to stay still. He was barely aware that he’d started pacing, as let himself get completely carried away with this idea.
“Yeah, there’s a whole section about the charity work she did in the eighties,” Steve explained, talking a little too quickly - like he was nervous. “There’s an interview with her. Well, a bit with her talking to camera, anyway…”
“Oh, absolutely,” Tony nodded enthusiastically. “If you’d like to google any cliché, rich-brat teen drama from the eighties, you’ll have a pretty accurate representation.”
“Yes,” Tony answered immediately, like he’d been completely baffled by the question. “Of course, I do – I kissed
And, given that he was so immediately overwhelmed by the place that he’d forgotten how to blink, it seemed only
, and kind, and good. And I have never wanted anyone like this, I have never felt this way before… That was incredible. You are incredible…” And he put one hand to the side of Steve’s face, very gently stroking away a tear that Steve hadn’t even noticed.
He hadn’t realised it at the time, and he was only just working it out now… But every time Steve thought of himself in that timeline, worrying about Bucky’s recovery in Wakanda but never going to visit him, he could so clearly feel that fear. He recognised it now.
Tony ran the washcloth over Steve’s back without really thinking about it… simply enjoying the way Steve sighed. Liking the idea of Steve being comfortable, and happy – just that. Tony gently caressed the cloth over Steve’s shoulders, down along his spine, washing away the flecks of congealed blood that were the only evidence of how desperately Tony had clawed at him, thanks to the healing potential of the serum. He worked his way down to Steve’s hips, over another collection of scratches, over his ass and between his legs… It felt intimate, and caring, and romantic even. But entirely without agenda. The kisses they shared were soft, and unhurried, and tasted of fresh water. The way Steve held him was permanent and solid and
Every time he reached the end of a corridor, he had to physically stop himself from just walking to Steve’s room.
His heart clenched in the same treacherous way it had at the time. He could recall so clearly the exact sense of shame that had overwhelmed him, reading Romanoff’s damning judgements…
And then his eye caught on a serial number, and a date, printed in tiny, typewritten font on the bottom of the top page - both of which he recognised.
“Hm? Oh, no. No... I’d never thought of that, actually…” Tony’s brow creased in concentration, his lips pursed just slightly, his ruminative expression exaggerated for comic effect…
“And then Vienna happened and it just… all collapsed, I don’t – I didn’t – you say it’s nothing to do with The Accords, but they scared me to death anyway, and I
In the end, as usual, he’d resorted to an uneasy compromise; wandering aimlessly around the corridors of the Tower, and feeling bad about it.
relax, just a little, even in the middle of combat. That not every moment can be a priority, when your whole life is made up of priority moments. That, actually, you need to leave somewhere for yourself to go, when the big moment really came.
Steve had no idea whether he was really hoping to discover more details about that or really hoping not to.
Of course, he would much rather have been sharing that champagne, and this beautiful suite, and his birthday, with Steve. But, these days, Tony could choose happiness. He had a bright side to look on.
“Eh, the solution wasn’t nearly as complicated as the problem,” he replied, dismissively – and she shook her head.
There would be consequences every time Steve shared some detail from the future - and there would be consequences when he didn’t.
Steve sighed and reached into his pocket, and retrieved the phone that Tony had left for him the week before. He frowned at it sadly before confirming,
“These people are here because they’ve experienced some negative reactions to being at The Facility. Not physical reactions, mind you. We’re quite sure that there are no
“S’okay,” Bucky murmured, his voice warm and slow, letting his head fall onto the back of Steve’s neck.
Tony felt as though his heart had stopped in his ribs, as Steve’s gaze hesitated on one of the prototype gauntlets that he’d left on the worktop. Even though he knew his heart wasn’t even beating in the first place… he didn’t know what else to call that sudden pressure in his chest.
the exaggerated confusion on his face - but of course, he wasn’t going to look up at him. Instead, he gave his head a violent shake and shuffled back towards Rhodey.
And then Tony leant back just enough to look up at Steve, the solid strength of him still pressed up against Tony’s chest, his hands still curled protectively around Tony’s shoulders… The blue of his eyes was flecked with gold, tiny little sparkles clinging to those impossibly long eyelashes, his lips full and soft and
“Oh, it’s fine,” she replied with a bored smile, “the rest is just information sharing, I’m sure the team can fill you in later.”
especially unusual. It certainly wasn’t alarming. In fact, as the words began to fall out of his mouth, Tony actually felt much calmer. Like he wasn’t directly connected to this fight anymore – just listening to it happen.
And, even without the question of anyone’s literal capacity, there was so much else to complicate this… Tony couldn’t be sure whether he was
He didn’t even think about it. He didn’t even open his eyes. He just lifted his head as far as his heavy shoulders would let him – because Tony had told him to.
That second kiss came with a rush of overwhelming emotion, a pure, shiny elation that Tony didn’t have a word for yet - something completely out of kilter with his new, neatly ordered understanding of this thing.
“Hang on a minute Steve,” Nat panted, still grinning. And only then did Steve bother to think about why everyone was laughing… and what he’d just done…
Steve looked away immediately – he literally looked at the floor, the way he would have if he’d walked in on something obscene. And as soon as he did it, he knew it was wrong. That it was obvious, and awkward, and probably seemed rude… But it was just an instinct. His only thought was
No inhuman knowledge for SHIELD to abuse. No super soldier for them to decide was now a spare; conveniently frozen for easy experimentation. No additional weapons to put into the hands of Hydra, if they somehow
That humiliated emptiness in Steve’s chest began to harden, until he could feel it like a cold weight against his ribs. It dampened some of the fire in his anger - leaving a more resolved, more resolute rage in its place.
But Tony told himself not to think about that – smiling all the while. He told himself that it was nice enough that Steve was on his way over.
“I’m sorry that I spent more time thinking about what you did than what Zemo did. I’m sorry that I held you responsible for the fact that
And then Tony buried his head in the crook of Steve’s neck, his breath hot against Steve’s skin as he whispered,
When Steve kissed him then, it was like… oxygen to a drowning man. It was a warm blanket around the shoulders of someone who’d been lost in the snow. It was like that first mouthful of cool water after days of wandering in the desert.
There were all these hot, sharp words in his head, a lifetime of unspoken argument and unarticulated emotion, all right there...
And Tony made the most beautiful little whimpering sound; wanton and vulnerable and easily the hottest thing Steve had ever heard in his life. His cock throbbed, that sharp, frustrated need clenching painfully in his hips with every movement Tony made - but it still felt as though that wasn’t the point somehow. Like everything else was just background noise to this thing Steve really wanted…
to reach a point where he could just laugh at Steve’s jokes and ask how he was feeling, and never even think about what happened…. But he just
“It’s okay.” Steve told her again. And she nodded, heavily, and stood up. Steve stood up too, of course, to walk her to the door. And then, at the last minute, a final thought occurred to her.
of this, or if you just want to stop and think about it, it’s okay,” Tony reassured him. His tone suggested that he was already pretty sure that Steve
So, Tony slid both of his hands under Steve’s shirt, running the flats of his palms along Steve’s sides – letting himself feel every inch of Steve’s skin, not flinching away from any of the things it made him think. That was… dizzyingly liberating. To just be allowed to feel, to not have to worry about hiding it, not thinking about denying himself or having to repair anything afterwards or having to hate himself for this.
Also, if anyone has any suggestions for how to accurately tag for any issues that are discussed in this fic, please just let me know. I'm trying to include everything without being misleading, and all opinions are welcomed.
Tony hadn’t given that project – or anything, really – a single thought since that first night with Steve…
“Would you be making this offer, if we’d never had sex?” Tony asked, somewhat abruptly. And Steve’s only reaction to that was,
He stopped his thoughts dead, squeezing the ball so hard that his hand ached. If he couldn’t deny that he was insecure, he could at least stop himself from indulging it. Because it
And he saw Pierce flinch. He saw all the tell-tale signs of panic that Pierce had no way to hide - the way his pupils dilated, the way his chest seized, the way the hair on the back of his hands stood on end…
“Janine” She provided, politely… and, nope, that was ringing literally no bells. Steve obviously hadn’t registered it
It was a human impulse, as mindless and reckless and against the rules as anything he’d done in the last twenty four hours… But…
Every little shiver, at the root of every blade of hair, running across every nerve in his body. Spreading out in all directions, melding and shifting and sparking as they ran into other sensations. Everything just floating in the collection of vaguely connected thoughts and limbs that comprised Steve Rogers, right now…
The discomfort of it wore off gradually, minute by minute, until Steve found himself asking why he’d ever felt obliged to make conversation in the middle of his personal trauma. Until he’d started to feel bitter over the years he’d wasted trying to be better than human, when it had never been necessary, and never been possible-
That made it sound like Pepper was uncomfortable to be around, like she’d been doing something wrong… Tony thought back to the way his mother used to look forward to his father’s business trips, the way she longed for a reprieve from Howard’s pettiness and temper and the atmosphere he created, and immediately Tony felt horrible for ever using the same
“Well, I don’t know…” And Bucky made like he was seriously considering it. And then he answered, as though it was a perfectly reasonable suggestion, “you like giving head, right?”
An uneasy chill crept over him, as he remembered Steve Rogers face staring down from the wall of his father’s office, the sound of his name in his fathers voice
“But, uh, last year, Agent Woo brought in this criminal gang that Scott Lang and his friends had apprehended – all of whom were under the influence of their own truth serum. Turns out, this guy, Sonny, I think? Had developed what is probably
“Ah, well that’s probably my fault, in that case,” Tony replied, breezily. “They probably mentioned, but I took them trekking across the desert this afternoon, so then no one really had any choice but to drink the water. A lot of water.”

close to what Steve needed, holding him in this state of impossible desperation. Tony pushed another finger into him, curling his knuckles against Steve’s rim as he began to lick the blood away.
Finally, I'm sorry that this chapter once again focuses very much on Steve's relationship with Tony and not much on Bucky - the chapter breaks were altered in the editing process, so now you have a very Bucky heavy chapter to look forward to in two weeks time 😀
“And you’ll get a chance to, you know... establish yourself, or whatever. And meet with Nat and Clint at least, and all that stuff you did at the Battle of New York… So, it won’t even matter if they
shady underground types this place caters to, you know. Their real clientele is just ‘rich assholes’ – including some of the people you used to socialise with, as a matter of fact…” He raised an eyebrow at Tony, who visibly resisted the urge to wilt under it.
“Okay, well, I’ll make up some fresh drug coffee for when you’re out” Tony offered, and Steve laughed softly.
Thank you so much to everyone who has read this fic, and to all the people who too the time to comment and engage with it - I can't tell you how much that has meant! For those who wish to indulge me further... there are a few questions in the end notes that I'd love some feedback on... 😘
“I know that Agent Nowak wouldn’t’ve have walked away from the love of his life, just because he couldn’t keep her, or because it was going to be painful later – and you know how I know that?” And he leant forward even further. “Because he

So, yeah, it was like Coulson had just said you had a kajillion dollars, or something, it just wasn’t a…” And he gestured vaguely to his head,
And maybe it wasn’t that he was going mad - maybe he’d simply been affected by the life he’d led, aware of different anxieties because of it… that wasn’t the same as going mad…
, maybe. That excess of energy had finally burned itself out in a natural, satisfying sort of a way… And Tony had started to feel his mind relax… and…
“Wow – did you get burgled or something?” Bucky asked light-heartedly as he picked his way through the chaos.
That he really had spent the whole day in bed with Tony Stark, running his hands over that beautiful body, and listening to Tony say how happy he was to be there…
They way his gaze fell on the curve of Steve’s waist, like it was drawn to something. The careful, searching pressure of his palm, slowly stroking its way down the side of Steve’s body. The awareness of Tony’s movements and the calm intensity on his face and the physical control that radiated from him… There was something almost spiritual about it. Ancient, and powerful, and
Steve was briefly amused to discover that even the great Tony Stark was incapable of inserting a USB without turning it upside down at least twice.
He and Tony shared a moment of genuinely comfortable quiet, both still smiling. And then Tony’s face lit up with a sudden thought,

Tony didn’t even know if he’d thought it or said it out loud. But then Steve opened his eyes, those impossibly long eyelashes fluttering for a second before he was able to focus on Tony’s face-

Tony’s entire body was flooded with heat. His head swam. His jaw ached in desperation to suck harder, to take Steve’s fingers to the back of his throat, to bite down-
But the guy was already looking down at his phone, distracted by the more important details of Captain America’s return. He didn’t bother to look back at Steve as the rest of his team emerged from the refrigerator and closed the door behind them. Then, without another word to him, they all headed towards the secure doors at the left-hand wall of the room-
His head felt so thick and sluggish, his whole body still weighted down with the remains of sleep. It seemed to take forever for his vision to clear. When he eventually forced himself out of bed, everything felt restricted and heavy and so much more effort…
“And yeah you can trace that horror back to all those little things at the start, but at the start they were just little things, and
Eventually, he heard the faint shuffle of footsteps, slowly approaching the door. He tensed every muscle, his fingertips pressing hard against the papers he had held in one hand - but he made sure to keep his expression blank, and relaxed.
Tony looked up at the monitor that was mounted on the back wall of the room - even though he knew he’d have been alerted about even the smallest inconsistency. He looked simply because he wanted to
But, for a good few minutes, Tony was lost in a sea of bare skin and ostentatious jewellery - moving further and further into the shapeless mass of this impossible crowd. His heart started pounding. His head started to swim.

And it made everything that much harder to take in, and it made the air around them feel thicker, and it might’ve been the reason that Tony felt slightly light-headed…
“And they don’t know anything about… They just think you woke up today?” Tony clarified, raising an eyebrow.
Actually, not only is Steve on drugs, but he is somewhat forced into ranting in the first place and in a (not unreasonable) temper... so, please remember that this is not intended to be a rational precis of his point of view, any more than previous outbursts have been entirely accurate interpretations of Tony's frame of mind. I think he has some good points here - but, yeah, the more balanced assessment of those will come in the next update.
“You can sleep here, you know,” Bucky commented lightly. Which was probably an odd thing for him to say, because Steve was always falling asleep in Bucky’s room – especially on nights like this.
And Steve could just tell that Dr Stape wasn’t afraid of either of them. This wasn’t the cowed reaction they often got from henchmen – people who were scared to be on the opposite side to the Avengers, frightened to provoke them or desperate to avoid being punished by them-
He was aware that it put an additional, unspoken pressure on the both of them, that there was a chance it would make Tony feel uncomfortable - in an ideal world, he would have avoided all that.
She crossed her arms, and let go of a patient breath, obviously assuming that Tony was ringing Steve again.
“Hey,” Rhodey replied, casually.  For a few seconds they just looked at one another. Eventually, Tony cocked an eyebrow, and Rhodey frowned, “oh, yeah, I was supposed to tell you something…”
, the plan is to get us all here, and then wait for us to voluntarily starve ourselves to death,” Bucky suggested, sarcastically.
Then he put the Nano-Casing of the Quantum Suit down onto Other Steve’s chest, and hit the controls. Immediately it moulded to fit Others Steve’s body, the helmet obscuring his face. Something about that struck Steve as kind of a shame, silly though it was-
“It’s fine,” Tony smiled – but, from the way everything in his lab had been neatened into perfect parallel lines, Steve had to guess he’d been
his skin was… and then curled his fingers around the length of Steve’s cock, and felt him, thick and full against his palm.
He hadn’t wanted to wear it, the first time around. He felt ridiculous and old fashioned and self-conscious in it… And burdened by it. Defined by it from the very beginning, required to live up to it with everyone he met.
“Okay, this is simply pettiness now,” Thor sighed, and then fixed Steve with what was probably intended as a compassionate look. “If this is an enduring disagreement between the two of you, then perhaps it’s simply the case that you will drift apart - but that’s no reason to sow disagreement among us all, or assume the same things of all of us,” and then he leant forward slightly, a sad smile tugging at his lips very briefly before he refocused, and added, “you are not the only one who cared about him.”
He kind of wanted to be angry with Rogers for telling him. For burdening him with this horrible knowledge, when there was absolutely nothing he could do with it…
almost fell over his lips. He made a point of talking about the evening’s treatment, filling the silence with technical details and neutral observations, right up until Bucky was sitting on the examination table.
And then Tony looked back to Steve, and saw that Steve was okay, that he was safe – that he was right
I shall spare you the details of all the tedious dramas of the last few weeks, and simply apologise for the delay in this chapter- And I am very, very sorry.
“What?” She demanded, before she turned to Tony with a questioning look in her eyes. He simply shrugged at her,
“No, it’s just that… The company bought this building, after the fall of SHIELD, and… a few other resources,” Stape explained, awkwardly. “Some of the medical research. And, look, I know Hydra was an evil organisation. I’ve not spoken to anyone here who doesn’t know that. But….
Then he felt Tony’s palms sweep over the curve of his waist – gripping his hips just that bit more firmly. Steve let go of a startled breath, his fingers clawing helplessly at the pillows. And then Tony lifted his head to look at Steve, his eyes blown wide and his lips soft.
So, that was a horrible thought that he felt horrible for even feeling horrible about, under the circumstances – and he couldn’t even make himself feel better by focusing on the circumstances, because the circumstances were horrible.
And then the door at the back of the room burst open, and all three of them flinched up to see Sam, storming across the office floor.
Steve followed the movement of it through the space around him, eventually turning to see a short, very pink-skinned man in a sequined robe. In his hands was an instrument, like a lute, but much smaller…
emotions attached to these objective facts, that the very idea of this would usually inspire specific and terrible fears. He was even beginning to remember what some of those fears were. But he simply didn’t feel anything other than comfortable. He just…
Tony heard it in Steve’s voice, his hips rocking up into his hand involuntarily, as the scene unfolded in his head.
a nervous wreck in general, and angry all the time, and I didn’t know what I thought, and I never knew if I’d still think the things I’d said, in the morning, or if it would just be the mood I was in… And I know, it sounds really simple,
And it probably would’ve have occurred to him to note that – Steve hadn’t argued with anything, yet. He was just trying to get his head around it first, asking some of the questions that would
He wondered if there was an alternate timeline where he simply collapsed at that point. The world where he’d finally declared his love for Tony and then just
And Tony really didn’t mean to sound so angry. He was just so overwhelmed, so at a loss for how to express it-
,” Bucky explained brightly, as strolled over to the easy chair. “Thought I might as well finish setting the mood.”
And then that general contentment began to form into something more like conscious thought… He became aware that this feeling of security and happiness had a form, a reason, a face, a name.
sulking. He wasn’t quite sure how it’d crept up on him, but by the time he’d taken his seat Steve recognised a definite petulance bubbling under his skin. He hated himself for it, obviously, but he couldn’t deny it anymore.
be completely honest, and trust that Tony would be listening to the real meaning in it. That he didn’t have to worry that one wrong phrase or inappropriate reaction would bring this whole thing crashing down around him. That nothing he said could stop Tony from loving him.
...What if this meant uncontrollable and horrible changes to both of them? What if it turned them into something they couldn’t even conceive of yet?
Tony found himself grinning, in spite of his bad mood. He thought back to his life before The Facility… How lost and lonely and
It took too long, and too much care, to lower it onto the table. And, as Steve was recognising that, it occurred to him that he wasn’t sure how his legs worked, either… That, if he had to follow Tony, he wasn’t sure…
But then it occurred to him just how glad he was of the excuse to get out of this situation for a moment…
“I’m sorry I yelled at you, when I got back from space. I was just… delirious, and dehydrated, and hurt, and, its no excuse. I’m sorry I tried to make you feel bad, for not being on the team when Thanos turned up. Like it was your job to be there, or something, like I had any right to assume… and you turned up anyway, and I never said – and I’m just, sorry…”
“Well… Maybe this is the drugs talking… But maybe we just have to go with it, and wait until the drugs stop talking,” Bucky shrugged.
Perhaps the two nights spent hiding in their suite had acted as a sort of buffer. Perhaps it was just that he’d been too concerned with his own fucked up sex life (or lack thereof) to think about what anyone else was doing. But somehow, Steve still managed to be shocked when they walked into Maribelle’s party and there was a woman casually sucking her boyfriend off at the bar. As you do.
Everything he’d planned to say began playing in his head, all the lines on top of one another - along with all the worst possible consequences, however unlikely.
now. Like every synapse had been rearranged. Like every single process in his head, from the most complex thoughts to the very basic life-functions, had shifted to focus on Steve. Like Tony had evolved to a higher functionality, for that purpose alone.
He tried counting backwards from ten, and forcing himself to breathe more deeply, deliberately untensing his muscles - nothing worked.
Thank you again to Betheflame for bidding on me, and for this awesome prompt - I just hope you like the end result!
And then he felt Tony shift, and move so that he was kneeling beside him on the bed now. Steve could feel Tony looking down at him, before he’d managed to tear his eyes away from the chain.
“Wouldn’t matter if I did. It’s a serum thing. I can’t drink enough to get drunk, usually.” Steve explained, fluidly – which brought Tony’s attention back to the conversation. He made a quick tally of how much of their backstory was public knowledge, and how much he’d have to step in to stop Steve blabbing about.
, after all these months of anxiety and doubt, after all the endless nights of impossible questions and deals with himself – it was finally going to happen.

Tony held his breath as Sam slipped out from between the bins and ran to the left. He had his jaw clenched in anticipation for what seemed like the longest time, naturally assuming that Sam would be spotted immediately… But one second slipped into two, and then three.
Tony knew that Steve was capable of literally punching a Chitauri Soldier in half - and he didn’t think that Steve had been anywhere near as angry or as focused as this, in the battle of New York.
He heard Tony hum a smile against his lips, shifting his weight so that he could mould his body against Steve.
“...Tony does, sometimes,” Rhodey replied, clearly surprised by Steve’s random outburst, but too stoned to think that deeply about it.

“...And I know that sounds ridiculous, and I really want to write it off as a trauma response or a superstition. I keep telling myself that it’s just a place, like anywhere else, that nothing about it’s really the same as last time…” He explained, his eyes drifting further into the middle distance “...But I’ve seen so many things that you’d think were ridiculous. Aliens and Gods and Magic and… And then being able to see
Of course, the time they had wasn’t theirs to keep. It was destined to slip away from them at the same merciless pace, no matter what they did – all Tony could do was try to make the best of it.
“You want to fuck me?” Bucky whispered efficiently, almost perfunctorily – because that was how it usually went. Whoever got wound up would be the person to go on top, just because it was simpler that way.
But still, Tony carried on staring at it, amazed. Mesmerised. He felt as though he’d just watched a physical impossibility, a
A cold feeling crawled up Bucky’s spine, cutting through what was left of his spacey intoxication. He knew that, on paper, it was good that Tony had said all that. He knew it should seem positive, that he should
“Oh no you don’t,” she told him straight. “You’re not getting rid of me unless you tell me what’s going on.”
…It felt like it should probably be really bad. In terms of his mental habits, and his hardwired responses…Well, he could immediately think what his panic
He knew immediately that Tony was right. At least about it making far more sense for him to come to Siberia… Probably about everything.
He saw, and understood, and even appreciated, that Pepper would always have his back. That she was only ever thinking of what was best for him…
Tony felt that pressure building in his chest again. The struggle to find the right words, the resistance to saying any of them out loud. That same nameless conflict he’d been wrestling with all week… that strange feeling that he didn’t want the things he wanted.
Instinctively, Tony recognised that there was something about this that wasn’t how it usually was… Something he liked.
“Okay, before I hear you out on this - do you promise that this isn’t just you trying to keep me safe?”
or Steve. He didn’t try to hide the way he ran his eyes over Steve’s chest, the way he lingered over the dip of his waist or the shape of his shoulders, he didn’t
