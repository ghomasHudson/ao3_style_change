“Ready for bed?”
“I already told you I was assisting on a case.”
Sherlock looked at Emma on his lap, “He is a consulting criminal mastermind who likes to play very dangerous games.”
“Sherlock. . .” John started to say but was stopped by Sherlock.
“Mrs. Hudson, I have something to ask of you but this must stay between us.” He pulled the envelope from his jacket and fumbled with it in his hands.
“Sorry? What? No. This is not brilliant.” John stated while pointing to the card in his hand.
Sherlock smirked at her response.
“Thank you, Greg.” replied John. Sherlock nodded. They discuss a little more in depth on how to proceed with everything. Once it was squared away, they bid Lestrade a good day.
Sherlock scoffed at Mrs. Hudson. In response, she turned around to look at John in the kitchen. He responded with a shrug. Not knowing what else to do she headed back down to her flat.
Sherlock returned to the flat while John headed to hospital for clinic duty. As Sherlock entered 221B, Mrs. Hudson approached him with another envelope. He opened it in front of her, the card said, ‘Ready, Set, Go.’ He assumed that meant the game was starting. He headed up to his flat to work out the next anticipated move based on the last two envelopes he received. On the wall above the sofa, he taped the blank card and the current card next to each other. From there, he took a few steps back looking back and forth between the two of them. The blank card is where his eyes came to rest. There was something quite perplexing about it. He stared at the blank card with such spitefulness, one would think the card offended him with its blankness.
Lestrade stood from behind his desk and motioned for them to sit down, “Sherlock. John.”
“Ours!”
In that moment, John stood there sobbing at the words. Sherlock walked over to him to be close and wipe the tears from his husbands face. He kissed John to distract him as he walked him backwards towards the exit. Sherlock reached behind John grabbed the door knob, turned it, and pushed it open to reveal the mundane world outside. They parted and John spun around fast to avoid seeing the look on Sherlock's face. He took a breath as he stepped outside but quickly turned back around to see Sherlock give him a wink and sad smile before the doors were closed by a nurse.  John turned once more back to the world in front of him, walked down the stairs and hailed a cab. He made it all the way back to Baker street before breaking down once more.
“Will you sit down. You’re driving me nuts.”
John looked towards Sherlock and Mrs. Hudson, “He’s upset because I made him hand over the envelope to Lestrade.”
They had quite a lovely chat once they arrived in the garden and got comfy on a bench. As much as John didn't want to he still had to say goodbye forever but he took a slight comfort in knowing that Sherlock won't even remember it.
“That seems dull.” replied Sherlock in a matter of fact sort of way.
“Sherlock?”
John nodded his head in agreement.
Sherlock sighed in sadness, “I know my mental state has been hard for you, John. ”
John was brought from his thoughts when he heard a car honk nearby. As he stood up from the bench to climb the stairs and enter the building, he briefly reminded himself to stay brave and true to himself about his decision.
“Sometimes, I wonder Sherlock.” Awkwardness set in over Sherlock and John after his statement.
“How’s he doing today, Katherine?”
John scoffed in exasperation, “Of course, you are.”
“Did Lestrade happen to mention anything else regarding Moriarty?”
The rest of their evening was uneventful until they went to bed. Something was still nagging at John about their conversation earlier. He could sense something was up.
They both looked at her in awe. John walked over to join them on the couch, “Why are you apologizing, Em? You did nothing wrong.”
He glared at Lestrade, “It helps me think.”
John nodded in acknowledgment, “That’s exactly what we were thinking but we don’t want to take any chances.”
John scoffed and sarcastically said, “You’re serious?” He then sighed and simply stated the obvious, “I know the moment we left you started making deductions about that envelope.”  He took another breath and irately said, “Sherlock, you are not going to pursue this. In the morning, we are taking everything down to Lestrade.”
He placed the envelope on the table, “I must ask that you deliver these envelopes to me when they come. John must never know that I am receiving them.”
“I’m sorry, Sherlock. I want to visit everyday but your right. It is becoming increasingly harder for me to come here.”
John entered the office and stood next to Sherlock, “We need your help, Greg.”
Sherlock came to a standstill as he watched the expression on Lestrade’s face
John looked at Sherlock flabbergasted.
“I love you too, John.”
John nodded his headed. But he sensed something more was going on, “Is that all?”
“I did. But I know you and you won't let this go. Not until you’ve solved it.” John emphasized by pointing at Sherlock which in return received an appalled look from him. He was going to add more but Sherlock was done with the conversation. Sherlock lifted Emma off his lap, steepled his hands under his chin, closed his eyes and “pretended” to go to his mind palace. Emma giggled at her daddy being so dramatic.
Sherlock listened with his eyes closed to the story John was telling him. Upon finishing, John stood up from the chair and moved it back to its original place. His husband still sitting there eyes closed, he appeared statuesque. John walked over to his husband, leaned down to place a kiss to his temple as a single tear fell from his eye. Holding this position, he sighed at the sudden sadness that fell over him and swallowed the lump in his throat before whispering, “Happy Anniversary, Sherlock.”
I don't own Sherlock or the characters of the show.
John and Sherlock both answered, “No.”
Sherlock and John exchanged a look in agreement that they need to let go of the past and decided it was time to tell Emma about Moriarty.
It was then that Sherlock, surprisingly enough, stopped Emma from continuing. “I think that is enough deducing for now.”
“You okay?”
John and Sherlock looked at each other and agreed to call Lestrade if they needed anything. The three of them bid a good day.
Sherlock pouted at the statement.
John was standing in the kitchen brewing tea and making breakfast when he glanced into the sitting room to find a scene straight out of a Norman Rockwell painting. Their nine-year-old daughter, Emma, was on the floor surrounded by books while Sherlock was in his chair plucking his violin lost in thought. He wouldn’t change their life for anything.  In observation of the scene before him, he recalled the story Sherlock told him how Emma came to be in their life.
“Come on, dear.” Mrs. Hudson lead Emma downstairs. Once John knew Emma and Mrs. Hudson were out of earshot he inquired, “How is this possible?” Sherlock sat there not saying a word and John continued, “There’s no way he is back. He’s dead.” while waving the card with emphasis. Sherlock still sat there with his hands under his chin. John took a seat in his own chair and sighed while staring at the card in his hand, “This can’t be happening.” John was interrupted from his contemplation by a chuckle from Sherlock, “Brilliant!” he exclaimed.
John was not convinced but he knew throughout the years sometimes it was best to just let Sherlock have a little alone time. He pecked Sherlock on the cheek and headed to bed.
John just raised his eyebrows in response as he took a sip of tea.
Sherlock smirked a little.
“Deduced? I am not sure I understand.” He ignorantly took a sip of tea.
No response came from Sherlock. In an attempt to reach him one more time, John decided to do what he always does. He would tell him the story of how they met, “Mr. Holmes, do you mind if I tell you another story?”
“Sherlock.” John warned cautiously.
John and Sherlock dropped Emma off at school on their way to Scotland Yard to see Lestrade.
John pulled his cell out, “I think we should call Lestrade.”
“Rude of him to not show upon your arrival.” replied Sherlock.
John weakly smiled, “Yes, my husband.”
Sherlock responded, “No, that’s all right. Mycroft’s always watching.”
“So, how did you spend your day?” John asked Sherlock.
But before John could answer, Emma walked into the flat and cleared her throat to make her presence known. John and Sherlock both turned their heads to look at her. Sherlock patted his lap, she walked over and sat down. John wondered how Sherlock would introduce the situation to Emma. Sherlock could be very blunt at times. So, John waited until he saw that light bulb go off in Sherlock’s head and just as he was about to inform Emma, John stepped in.
“No need to explain yourself. I know that my lucid days are few and far between. One day I wont be able to remember anything and your stories will not pull me from the depths of my mind.”
“Oh?” John glanced over at Sherlock who was still standing in the doorway. He could see a little smirk planted on Sherlock’s face.
He looked to John, “Do what?”
Upon hanging up with Mycroft, he ripped the envelopes off the wall when he realized John and Emma would be home any minute. He sat down in his chair and opened a paper just in time for John to walk in.
He came back downstairs and stopped on the landing before walking halfway into their flat. He stared at the floor as he said with a quivering voice, “I’ll see you in a couple of days.” He turned to walk away but Sherlock reached out and grabbed his arm. John stopped but did not face Sherlock. He felt Sherlock close the distance between them before he felt a soft peck on his neck. “I have to go.”
John rested a finger to his temple with his thumb resting on his jaw. He squinted at Sherlock, “Why do you do that?”
*******John's Flashback***********
John interjected, “She’s not wrong, Sherlock.” He sighed and wiped his hands down his face before continuing, “I do have to restrain myself from not yelling at you and telling you how childish you’ve been acting. There has to come a time when our family becomes first priority and the cases become more of an occasional hobby.”
He looked at both of them with a surprised look on his face, “Really? With what?”
Sherlock stammered flabbergasted, “What? Why?”
They sat there staring into each others eyes longingly but John knew it couldn't last ans despised himself for what he was going to have to do next. He was surprised when Sherlock beat him to the punch.
“No. I enjoy the life I have with you both.  I never imagined myself to be the man I have become. I need more stimulating cases. Ones that test me to my limits of malnutrition and sleep deprivation.” He said a little too excitedly.
Sherlock did not respond he simply turned and left Lestrade’s office. All the way back to Baker Street, his mind was all a buzz with this new information. Once he entered the flat, he pulled out the cards and put them up on the wall again. He paced back and forth in front of the sofa while going over everything again in his mind. A thought occurred, if anyone had an answer it would be Mycroft. He grabbed his cell to call his brother. Sherlock informed Mycroft on everything that has happened. Mycroft had no answers for him but he did assure him that he would look into. He could sense that Mycroft was withholding information.
Sherlock threw his head back and exhaled in annoyance before looking to John again, “I’m just being me.”
John nudged Sherlock to hand over the evidence. He walked over to his desk and placed on it the envelope, the card that was inside, and the fingerprint square he cut off the envelope. He also placed a little notebook explaining the evidence he had already gathered on the desk. Lestrade looked up at them with a confused expression on his face waiting for them to explain.
John gave her a hug, “Honey, even though your daddy and I love each other very much, we will disagree on things. Don’t you ever think for one second that it is your fault.”
Upon entering, he was welcomed by the nurse at the front desk, “Hello, Dr. Watson. How are you today?”
“Ta for lunch.”  John called out to her as she left. When he heard her door close, he turned around towards Sherlock, “You could have said thank you.”
At that point, they broke eye contact and took big sighs.
Sherlock could not sleep last night, so he got up and went for a walk around London. Mycroft called him to make sure everything was okay. He gave him a simple answer and hung up the phone. He had too much on his mind and just wanted to be alone. He found himself at a crossroad, so to speak, in his mind. He found himself wanting to be honest with John and tell him about the envelopes but at the same time he wanted to keep working the case himself. He knew that he would be the only one clever enough to stop Moriarty, if he did in fact turn out to be alive. After a couple of strolls around central London, he looked at his watch. John and Emma were gone by now so he decided it was best to return to the flat to continue his thoughts in silence.
They returned to the sitting room and sat down in their respectable chairs. John was watching Sherlock look adoringly at Emma.
“If any of these letters become a threat or endanger any of you, you tell John the truth.”
“Revert back to your old self.”
“Thank you, Lestrade. John and I will come by tomorrow.” He ended the call and placed his cell back in his pocket.
“Did you get another envelope?” he propped himself up to look at Sherlock in suspicion.
“If you agree to turn the envelope and the card over to Lestrade then I will allow you to be on the consulting end. But the moment that it proves to be false, the case is done. No more working it from your angle because you think Lestrade is an idiot.”
Once it got to the end of the day, they put Emma to bed then spent a couple of minutes just talking about nothing in particular. At some point during their conversation, Sherlock had placed his hand in his coat and realized he had forgot about the letter he confiscated from Mrs. Hudson earlier. When John ended their conversation with an invitation to bed, he decided to stay up a little longer.
John looked aghast as he approached Sherlock, “What? How?”
Lestrade looked up to see them enter his office, “Good morning, Sherlock. John. What can I do for you boys?”
Lestrade picked up the card to look at it. When he flipped it over, he saw the “M” on the back and his face went pale. Sherlock squinted his eyes watching him intently as he sarcastically commented, “very good, Lestrade. I see you recognize the signature.”
“My family is my first priority. Why do you think I agreed all those years ago to only take the most least dangerous cases?”
Sherlock sat back down on the sofa, “I guess now is a good time as any to tell Emma about Moriarty.”
He responded annoyed as he entered the flat, “Yes.”
“On my way.”
The next morning, John woke up to find Sherlock gone. He made a mental note to talk to him later. This new Moriarty case is bringing out the worst in Sherlock; almost as bad as he was when they first meet. John took Emma to school then continued to the clinic.
“Holmes? Are we related?” Sherlock got a glimmer in his eye, the same one, he usually got while trying to make a deduction.
Sherlock went back to staring at the fireplace. They sat there for a good hour occupying themselves with other things. All the while their daughter secretly observing them in curiosity.
John sternly warned, “Sherlock.”
John looked to his daughter, “We aren’t going to do anything.”
They kissed and hugged. They spent the next few hours in the garden conversing about old cases and laughing about silly things Lestrade had done over the years. They talked about what they would have done if Sherlock's mind had not been waning. There moment came to a halt at the announcing of dinner. They walked to the dining hall together and had their last dinner. When dinner was over they walked hand in hand to the lobby of the institution. This was the moment they had both been dreading for the last few hours. John released Sherlock's hand and walked towards the exit but stopped and turned around when Sherlock said something to John that he would cherish forever.
“John?” He mocked.
He nodded his head in response to the question.
Sherlock sat there for a second, comprehending what John was asking of him, “Lestrade is an idiot and I will accept those terms.”
She looked at him sadly, “Oh, Sherlock.”
It was Friday afternoon and he found himself, probably for the last time, standing at the bottom of the stairs looking up towards the old red brick institutionalized building. Within the last year and a half, he came to loathe this building and the sadness it harbored for him inside. Before entering he decided to take some time and mentally prepare himself for what he was about to face. There John Watson sat on a bench recalling all the years they had spent together as well as what brought him and Sherlock here a year and half ago.
“Oh, you know the usual, solving cases.”
“Boring.”
“For what?” inquired Sherlock.
“Thank you.” He hung up the phone, “The hair shows growth within the last couple of weeks. How is this possible?”
“Come on John, where is your sense of adventure?”
John embraced his hand and gave it a shake as he said, “John Watson-Holmes.” He couldn’t stop himself. It sort of came out, he mentally slapped his forehead.
“We have a family now, Sherlock.”
Taking a hint, John reached out for her hand as he stood up from his chair.  “Come on Em, let’s go see if Mrs. Hudson wants to go get some air and then get lunch.” She took his hand as she said, “Okay, but this conversation is not over.” John chuckled at her statement and they walked out of the flat down to Mrs. Hudson.
“Why? In need of a fix? Are Emma and I too boring for you?” John said a little hurt.
They both stood up, walked over to a table and sat down next to each other. John pulled up their last case to read to him. He changed the names as he read it out loud to his detective, just to be on the safe side. Sherlock became enthralled in the story as John told it. Upon closing his laptop, Sherlock asked John a question, “Are you here to visit someone?”
John chuckled sadly at Sherlock’s last sentence knowing he meant that with all his heart, “I love you, Sherlock.”
John sternly retorted, “She’s just a child.”
“Being your daughter, I have seen my fair share of your disagreements. However, within the last two days there has been a shift between you two. I’ve deduced that Moriarty is more dangerous than you are letting on.  You’re both on edge. You’ve unknowingly put distance between yourselves. There is anger behind your words which I have rarely seen in your disagreements before.”
“Not hungry, dear?”
They both jumped a little when the phone rang. Lestrade answered the phone, “Anderson?”
“If he was healthy enough, we definitely would be spending it differently.”
She was silent for a little while, “On one condition.”
Sherlock sighed in annoyance. He hated it when John played the family card, which he rarely did. Don’t get him wrong he loved Emma and would do anything to keep her and John safe. But as of lately he felt stuck in a rut and he was making no attempt to hide his excitement with this new mystery.
“You’ll find him in the library.” She stated as she handed him a visitor’s pass.
Sherlock looked at John with an annoyed look on his face.
“Okay. Sorry.” he scooted closer to Sherlock to cuddle just a little.  But to his surprise, Sherlock grabbed his pillow and the sheet off John and walked out of the bedroom. Sherlock had never done that ever. John was upset, he couldn’t understand why Sherlock was acting so strange.
“Sherlock, remember our deal.” John emphasis by pointing with his eyes to Emma on Sherlock’s lap.
“Lestrade.” said Sherlock as he and John entered his office.
“Oh, hell. Are you still on that?” Sherlock retorted while pulling back the covers to get into bed.
John inquired, “What if I make a deal with you?”
. John watched Sherlock’s face go through a multitude of emotions starting with fascination and ending with realization. Sherlock looked over at Emma. He gave her a reassuring smile to let her know everything was okay. “Sherlock?” inquired John. Sherlock looked his way as John approached him and took the card. He watched John’s face pale as he examined the card, “No, its not possible.”
She nodded her head.
Arriving back at the flat, they found Mrs. Hudson and Emma making stew for lunch. Sherlock noticed an envelope sticking out of Mrs. Hudson’s apron pocket. As they all gathered in the kitchen, Sherlock grabbed the envelope out of her pocket and put it in his jacket. Emma and John grabbed a bowl of stew. Sherlock walked over to his chair, sat down and steepled his hands together. Mrs. Hudson brought Sherlock a bowl, he took it from her only to placed it down on the end table next to him.
John straightened himself back up but kept a close proximity to the man sitting before him. He was trying to find the courage needed to say the next few words. He wasn't quite sure if the words were more for him as validation he was making the right call or an explanation for his husband. Regardless, he knew it needed to be said, "I love you, Sherlock. I want you to know that. My life spent with you has been an adventure I wouldn't trade for the world. But for my own sanity, I need to let you go. I wont be coming back to see you. This is our final goodbye." With another kiss to the temple, John turned to walk away when he felt a hand on his arm. He turned to see Sherlock staring at him tears fall down his face, his voice shaking with sadness he inquired, “John?”
He returned the stare equally upset at Sherlock.
Emma entered the flat first, “Daddy!” She ran to embrace him in a hug.
“Why would you come visit someone and not tell them you’re coming?” Sherlock inquired.
He opened his eyes to look at John who was now steaming with anger and sadness “Oh, you meant it otherwise you wouldn’t have said it.”
Sherlock looked down at their joined hands, “John, I understand if you can no longer come to visit. You need to live your life. I need you to live your life.”
John looked at Emma than back to Sherlock, “Sherlock?”
“I did tell you. I was helping Lestrade with a case.” which in all actuality was true just not specific.
He didn’t answer John’s question instead he changed the subject as he turned a page, “I saw Lestrade today.”
“Good.”
He commented under his breath, “Oh, dear god.” He made a waving motioning with his hand for her to continue.
Still annoyed, “What, John? I told you I apologized.”
“Ta.” He turned to walk down the hall as he did so many times before. The fact that Sherlock was in the library was a very good sign. Most days he did not leave his room but when he was feeling up to it and having a good day, he could be found either in the library or the garden.
a child but she is ours. She needs to know!” Sherlock stared at him angrily.
Emma was quite a surprise. The night before Sherlock jumped off St. Bart’s Hospital to save John, Mrs. Hudson, and Lestrade; Sherlock confessed his love for John they had a night of passion.  While Sherlock was staying with Molly after the fall he became quite ill. Sherlock being the scientist he is, started testing himself and discovered he was pregnant. He racked his brain for days trying to figure out how it was even possible. He knew Mycroft required his assistance with bring down Moriarty’s network but he was unsure how to do it in his current condition. Once he met up with Mycroft, he told him of his condition which was no surprise to his brother. He told Sherlock that when he was younger he performed an experiment on him where he injected Sherlock with male seahorse genes. Once that was discussed, they made a deal. Sherlock would continue with his mission until he was no longer able to.  He would then return to the mission once the baby was born. Once the mission was complete he and the baby would go home to John. Now here they are years later safe, content, parents and still consulting on cases.  Both Sherlock and John have changed as well as their relationship. Their relationship had strengthened over the years and more trust was built up.
The man nods dazedly, his eyes moving between the two, his fingers anxiously twisting one of his rings lining his hand. “Uh, yeah. That’s my dad. I’m, uh, I’m Ethan.”
The cause for their moment—his
They’ve been driving for close to ten minutes when John clears his throat. “I’m sorry.”
“Too boring.”
John laughs softly, turning to watch the flower fields peeking out through the treeline. “I didn’t even know you could drive,” John mentions off-handedly, his mind already pulling him back to the days of his childhood when he and Harry would race through similar fields—back when they were still on decent terms, back when they were okay.
Curiosity prickles at Sherlock’s insides, the words coaxing his attention from the slides he’s studying. He moves away from the eyepiece lens of the microscope to avoid any distractions. “Something came up then?”
“Ah,” Sherlock grins at him. “But where’s the fun in that, Dr. Watson?”
“I’ve never been able to live down the guilt of not being able to stand up to William, of knowing that my babies grew up separately, and oh God, I’m the reason she’s dead, aren’t I?” The tears fall down her cheeks, dropping to the table and seeping into the linen tablecloth.
“I…” Her breath is coming rapidly now, her chest heaving as years of lies and guilt threaten to crash down around her, with William’s eyes watching her like a hawk from the windowsill. John reaches for her hand in an attempt to calm her down, his notebook forgotten on the table.
. But I guess I have you to thank for this feeling in my chest,” she says, her hand curled inward. “This lightness. One time, I wrote about it all in a diary, but I guess the wounds were still too fresh for it to have any effect.”
He cuts himself off, his stare at his father filling with despair. Sherlock glances over at Thomas, spies the tiredness around his eyes, the truth seeping through.
Harry’s expression is unreadable, even for Sherlock. “You can apologise all you want, but that doesn’t change the fact that you haven’t visited Dad
John swivels in his seat, eyes scouring every inch of Sherlock’s face, unsure of what he’s looking for but that he’ll know it when he sees it. “Okay?”
“Now that we know
“How are you feeling now?” he asks gently.
Gravel and dust propel through the air as the vehicle vacates the premises, but John can’t think, can’t move, can’t process any of what just occurred. He’s frozen.
“Uh, no, my aunt’s taken him to the shops,” Ethan stammers out, the sight of the detectives on his doorstep so soon shocking him. “He’ll be back soon, though.”
The bustle of strangers—of lovers celebrating anniversaries or having their first dates, of friends catching up, of families celebrating birthdays—fills the pub they’ve found, yet the moment between them feels oddly intimate. The soft lighting washes over them, their little booth providing a sense of comfort.
“Sure,” Ethan shrugs. “S’only going to be tossed, anyway.”
Sherlock’s gaze trails the knife’s edge pressed against John’s throat, his own constricting in fear. He remains where he is, his hands held up to prevent a tragedy. He forces the words out, “Are you alright, John?”, taking in the wide movement of his eyes, the harsh, panicked breathing escaping through the cracks of Ethan’s hand pressed to his mouth.
Lestrade exhales loudly, fingers tensing beside him in agitation. Just one punch. One swing at him is all Lestrade needs, and then he’d happily listen to Sherlock correct every single sentence he’s ever spoken. He rolls his shoulders to relieve the built-up tension, then crouches for a closer look, placing his cup beside him as he perches over the body.
“You rambled quite a bit about how ‘insane’ the whole situation was before your father recounted the supposed last time he saw Edythe, and there’s also the fact that neither John nor myself mentioned how her body had been found, yet you somehow knew she’d been put into a suitcase. Quite interesting.”
“Officers, huh?” Thomas says, trudging his way closer. “How can I help you boys?”
“That would make sense, if the police had disclosed the details of her discovery to the public. But there’s also the fact that we found Edythe in a wedding dress that’s identical to the dress your mother, Dorothy, wore on her wedding day,” Sherlock says, holding up one of the photographs he’d spied yesterday alongside his phone displaying the pictures of Edythe’s body in the suitcase.
, and John sighs. “Because you wouldn’t have been able to sleep if you didn’t figure out
“Yes?” John’s confused and Sherlock is a perfect parallel to it.
But how can John even think about the pull of exhilaration that gunfire still holds over him? He’s supposed to be completely and utterly focused on helping his father recover. And of course the thought of gunfire draws his thoughts elsewhere, longing for home, for Sherlock overtaking him.
But Sherlock had never given much regard to his feelings. Rather, he liked to pretend he didn't have any. Emotions only got in the way of his work, of his mind's ability to function optimally. He wouldn't,
“Mrs. Carter,” John begins gently, before he clears his throat and corrects himself. “Sorry, Helen. Are you sure you’re comfortable speaking more about Edythe? We completely understand if it’s too much for you.”
Ethan bristles, his eyes narrowing. “You’re lying.”
Sherlock meets his gaze, the subtle intensity hiding behind his eyes striking him. “Game plan?”
Thomas nods, the distant memory taking hold. “Remember thinking about how they’d never be able to get the blood out of it.”
“Did she have any siblings or cousins?” Sherlock interjects.
“Against an 83 year old man? Wow, I’m gone for eleven days and you lose your edge,” John laughs.
“Yes,” Sherlock answers, pulling out one of the many police badges he’s taken from Lestrade over the years, flashing it briefly in front of his face. “I’m Consulting Detective Sherlock Holmes and this is my colleague John Watson. We’re looking for a Thomas Richards. Does he live here?”
John lifts the cover and scans over the information regarding Edythe’s death in 1960, brushing over it and coming to a stop at the people who identified her. “A Mr. Thomas Richards, aged 83, lives at– Wait, previously engaged to Edythe Carter? We’re visiting her fiancé from 52 years ago?”
A door clicks shut and Ethan’s figure appears in the doorway, leaning against the doorframe. “The pills tend to make ’im drowsy. Sorry if that messes with your questioning.”
John holds up his own notebook in response, pointedly ignoring both his sister standing on the doorstep with an unreadable expression on her face and Sherlock’s glance towards the bag resting at his feet. “What’s our plan?”
“No, don’t you worry. We’re just going to talk to him, see what he knows. He’s one of the only leads we have, aside from the mother, but my money’s on Thomas.”
“He’s not–”
Helen nods, her throat tight. Her clutch on her handkerchief tightens, her knuckles pale against the vibrant material of her blouse. “It’s all just so confusing…”
“No, I... I told you earlier. My father’s still not well. I can’t leave, not yet anyway.”
That idea sets his nerves on fire more than any treacherous case could.
There’s a sincerity there, in Sherlock’s words. A quietness, too, that John hadn’t expected. He lets out a sigh, exhausted; his body drooping further into the seat. “I… I don’t know.”
“I noticed the photo frames along the windowsill,” he says in way of an answer. “Just being sure to cover all bases. You never know what could prove useful or give us a new lead.”
know how to drive and I’ve never been in a collision. I’m a safe driver. Not even once did you appear uneasy during this drive, up until a minute ago, that is.”
He starts the car without a further thought, attempting (and failing) to keep his mind trained on the road, to leave his thoughts behind—and if Sherlock happens to add a little more pressure to the accelerator when he feels those thoughts creeping up… well, that’s between him and his mind.
Sherlock finds himself agreeing, the eyepiece hiding the hint of sadness he suspects she’d find in his eyes. “Yes, the silence has been awfully dreadful, hasn’t it?”
“Oh, right.” Sherlock stares at the victim for a brief moment before looking back at the Detective Inspector. “Well in that case, come stand here,” Sherlock gestures to beside him. “I need an ordinary pair of eyes to provide insight.”
Five days in his parent’s house, and his insides feel hollow, as though the silence is draining his emotions, dampening them down, leaving him in a horrible mix of being restrained yet floating away with zero control. He never pictured there coming a day where he missed the sound of gunfire. God knows he’d endured plenty during his time in Afghanistan.
“I– It was in the 30’s when the girls were born, during the Great Depression, and William just couldn’t find any work. Some days, we were so hungry. I don’t know how we managed…” Her eyes are downcast at the table, a crease in her brow. “It got so bad that William forced us to give up Agatha. I… He came home from another endless day of searching for work, and he announced he had a solution to all our money problems. I can still picture that horrible smile on his face as he told me he’d found someone to adopt Agatha. I–” She chokes out a sob. “I tried so hard to forget about it, to pretend Agatha never existed, but every day,
“As are you,” Sherlock points out.
Helen follows his gaze, her eyes lingering on the one of Edythe as a baby in the arms of William, her late husband. Under his curious and watchful eyes, she hesitantly starts. “Uh, well, she was rather quiet as a child. Obedient, grades close to perfect. She always aimed to please her father, to live up to his expectations, high as they were.”
Maybe that’s why, despite stealing the file from Lestrade’s desk that night and studying it extensively to no avail, he makes the five hour drive to John’s parents’ house a couple days later, certain that John’s absence is the reason for his inability to piece together this case. Once John’s around, he’ll be able to focus.
Four days have passed at an inconceivably slow pace since Sherlock became aware of John’s absence, and it has arguably been the worst four days of his life. How is he expected to focus on a case as interesting, as
Before he could think better of it, or even think at all, Sherlock retrieves his mobile from his inner suit pocket and quickly types out a message to John.
over their own family, John?”
Edythe had been alive after all these years. Right?”
“Oh, no no no,” John says, waving his hands in the air. “Don’t you try to flip this situation around, to make yourself be in the right.”
John nods distractedly. He swipes across to view the other photos, zooming in on the wound on her head. “How’d she die? Judging from the picture, I’d say it looks like blunt force to the head.”
Ethan shrugs with shoulders filled with tension, turning to the sink and filling one of the glasses with water to sip at. The slight shake in his hand jostles the water, and he sets the glass on the basin, crossing his arms instead. “Must’ve read it in the paper or something.”
“No, Sherlock,” John laughs, an easy one that fills the air with warmth, “he’s quoting Scooby Doo.”
“In here, Lestrade!” Sherlock calls.
She shakes her head pitifully. “I tried asking William a couple of times over the years, but he always said it wouldn’t do anyone any good, especially me. So eventually, I just tried to move on and forget about it all.”
Sherlock had flicked the indicator on and was pulling off to the side of the road before the memory of doing so catches up to him. The words
It’s odd, John finds, to be back in his childhood bedroom. Everything was still the way it had been throughout his teenage years, jarring him upon his arrival. He’d stood in the doorway, unable to enter as his childhood flashed through his mind. It was as though he’d been forcibly thrown back into adolescence: into the awkward body of a teen struggling with his sexuality. He hadn’t expected his parents to leave his room untouched after all these years, with the bedspread the same dark blue he remembers curling into after petty arguments with his father. Even his clothes were still hidden away where he’d left them all those years ago.
Even a simple
Guilt grips him, twisting and wrenching his insides into tight coils until he can barely draw breath—which he finds sickly ironic given that’s how it tends to feel when he thinks of Sherlock for too long.
She fixes John with one last glare before her eyes flitter to Sherlock, an almost curious look to them, before she’s swiftly moving towards the door.
“Meaning, what? Thomas had something to do with the body back then?”
“You’ve never stopped me from doing that before,” Sherlock points out.
“Waiting for me? Why?”
He’d initially found it reminiscent of those movies where the child dies and the room is left as a memorial for grieving parents. And now, five days later, he supposes his mother was right to leave it in commemoration of the person he used to be. He’s pretty sure a piece of him, his connection to his family, died when he left for war. Symbolic, perhaps.
“You said she was found at the airport, right? That’s horrible. I can’t even imagine what kind of person would do that to an old lady, shoving her in a suitcase like that.”
Even for him, this case is causing some confusion, some uncertainty he hadn’t expected. He provides silence, ready for as much as John might require, in order to allow John to process. (It only takes twenty seconds.)
“Are any of them still alive?”
John retrieves it, reading aloud the words printed on the front. “‘Property of Scotland Yard’?”
“Yes,” he says, his tone now stern and appealing; determined to be the voice of reason. “We do that to help people, the police. We do that to catch criminals.”
“You said she left in a red coat.”
“What about your mother?”
“Ignoring the fact that you’re a
“Sherlock, you’ll like this one.”
you we should’ve burned, and then he started talking shit about how you used to hit Edythe and how you killed Mum when it clearly was a suicide and–”
“Dad had this insane idea that he would finally get to marry her.” Disgust is heavy with every word. “Said how that’d show her she’d never’ve been able to hide from ’im forever.”
“Uh, her father passed away in ‘95 but her mother is still alive, and so’s her fiancé.”
Lestrade’s referring to the fact that without Sherlock’s assistance, Scotland Yard wouldn’t be as exceptional as they appear to his superiors and the public eye, but Sherlock takes the response at face value. “I’m always right.”
In came someone who listened to his deductions with a sense of astonishment and wonder, even after all this time. Someone who moves in with him and puts up with his (admittedly) insane experiments and body parts in the fridge and guns firing at all hours of the morning and to top it off, hours upon hours, sometimes days of silence, and John takes this in his stride as though it’s the most normal of situations to find himself in. And maybe it’s this…
“I don’t…” Several emotions flicker across Thomas’ face, confusion highlighting through it all. “I don’t understand. Recent…?”
“Right down to the freckle above her right eyebrow.”
“Blunt instrument to the side of the head.”

“Damn you, Lestrade.” Sherlock hurls the words out into the apartment, illogically praying they’d reach the Detective Inspector in Scotland Yard. He had been

sending inklings of joy through his bloodstream. He pulls into traffic, maybe breaking a couple of speed limits as he drives to John’s parents’. (He makes a mental note to send Mycroft a text should any speeding fines occur.)
John starts for the door, but Sherlock reaches into the box of photographs, holding up the golden frame featuring Edythe and Thomas in an embrace. “Do you mind if we take this? It’d be good to have a nice photo for the report.”
“No no, it wasn’t Lydia. It was your ex-fiancé: Edythe Carter.”
“I’ll be sure to do more of that, then.” There’s a tender smile on John’s face, his gaze steady as he stares at Sherlock. “I don’t think I could stand to be away from the city that much, anyway.”
Sherlock hangs up the phone, drowning out Lestrade’s protests that he can’t. His mind’s moving a million miles a minute as he processes this new revelation. He might require his mind palace for this.
It’s only when he’s parked the car in the drive that he starts to second guess his endeavour, his reasoning—his
“No,” Lestrade coughed as he rose, “but we’ve got the lab running DNA so we should know something soon.”
“You do realise that that’s the second time you’ve asked me how I am in the past 40 hours?” John turns his gaze out the window, keeping his eyes trained on the gravel. He doesn’t have the emotional strength to keep his guard up and the idea of having Sherlock verbally scrutinise every emotion he’s currently experiencing isn’t appealing in the slightest.
Bleeding, and the only kind of doctor that could fix it had just walked out the door.
Complete, hollow silence.
"I'm coming in."
And yet —
"You always have an opinion. On everything."
John loved Mary. Mary loved John. The real way, the way a wife was meant to love her husband. Not whatever strange, twisted thing had wormed its way into Sherlock's ruined heart.
But a fall into what? Love? He didn't think . . . he didn't know if he even believed in such a thing. The idea that two people out of seven billion could find each other, accept each other as two sides of the same coin —
"Fine." John's amused smile slipped slightly. He rubbed his temples. Slid a little farther down the doorway. Now that Sherlock looked at him, really
"Sherlock, you know just as well as I do that you can't be alone all the time —"

"What does it matter what color the bridesmaid's dresses are? Nobody's going to be looking at them."

Lord Astair reluctantly stepped back as the Royal Physician quickly knelt near the Princess but didn’t draw back his sword, throwing wild accusing glances to anyone who’d meet his eyes and not ceasing in his vituperations.
As Sherlock stiffly nodded and stalked out of the room, Mycroft gave a slow smile. Even in the brief span of their conversation, Sherlock had shown feelings, muted as they were, that he hadn’t seen in his younger brother since their parents’ demise – and as unexpected as this development was, he knew exactly whom he had to thank for it.
“A-ah, around eight this morning I believe. He’s quite often crossing the kitchens, actually – every morning and evening, from what I can tell. He’s not coming on any errand either, even though he always comes right before we send the guests’ meals up.”
Janet had started fidgeting a little in the lasting silence and he concentrated again on the matters at hand.
A long blink was the only visible indication of what Mycroft was already aware of; Princess Adler hadn’t known of every tradition surrounding a royal marriage in Baker Kingdom.
Both Lord Astair and the Princess’s confident immediately started advancing on the handsome young man.
He found that he didn’t mind that much.
“I’m sorry, what? Sire?”
“Can you remember which ones of the new servants were here this afternoon, then? Around two hours after the sun reached its peek?”
“In what? Saving my life? Stop saying such idiocies. Now if you were to apologize for your fool-hardiness I might accept, but I somehow believe it wouldn’t be sincere.”
“Certainly not. Let’s not make too much of a trifle.”
Sherlock’s by now familiar coat was wet. But it hasn’t rained in days, his mind murmured faintly.
“I- hello. I’m staying with Lady Hudson during my stay at the castle, before hopefully joining the knights’ quarter, and I was looking for the kitchens to ask for directions. But what about you?” John blurted out, before rethinking the question. “I mean, do you…are you a knight yourself?”
“John.” Suddenly the grey eyes were back; except in the ways that they weren’t. Because they didn’t belong to a strange man appearing from around a bush anymore, or even to a knight defending him against a guard. They belonged to a Prince. The Prince. Prince Sherlock.
“But your boots, I thought…and you didn’t correct me.”
Sherlock frowned a little at the mention of Lady Sarah before dismissing the notion as paranoia. He had seen nothing in her interactions with John that would indicate that she wished his knight any harm, after all. Still, he couldn’t help being a little displeased at the thought that she was currently taking care of John, no matter that the reason for his unhappiness was unknown even to him.
“Your Highness.”
And as Sherlock left the apothecary, his long coat floating a little after him in his haste, he tucked this name very close to his brain, murmuring it once to himself just to be able to taste it on his tongue.
John blinked a few times as he tried to register this flow of information; finally, he found his voice again.
It was then, and only then, that John went off in search of his Prince.
And the lad did; not perfectly, but with surprising strength considering his lanky form. He had left his left side open to attack once again but John didn’t end the fight; he did, however, make an aborted gesture to make it seem like he was going to. Careful. Only attack when you can also protect yourself. Once more, the lad understood, and his next attack was much more careful. John nodded his approval. The joust continued in such a way for about fifteen passages of arms, becoming more and more fluid and graceful, before John finally let himself score a solid hit, and although he involuntarily made the lad stumble and fall back, the eyes that were looking at him were definitively grateful.
“This is most curious. Why would Moriarty issue such a warning? You’ve never encountered him before, and certainly he would have been better off with you ignoring him.”
“I’m terribly sorry, Guard – I never meant to intrude. I wanted to find the kitchens and was given directions to them, but I must have gotten lost.”
“A challenge. A mere provocation. He’s bored.”
Heart sinking, he turned to see another guard, puffed up with obvious annoyance.
Abruptly coming back to his senses, he dropped to one knee.
John wasn’t much impressed.
“Si on me presse de dire pourquoi je l’aimais, je sens que cela ne se peut exprimer qu’en répondant: «Parce que c’était lui, parce que c’était moi.»”
Then the next morning he had taken four of the beautifully-carved white pawns and made them suffer a tragic demise in a truly horrific chemical experiment, and John had understood why the page he had asked for the board had been so hesitant about entrusting it to him.
“I think the Princess isn’t as far as you think, Lord Astair. You, Guard, please come closer.”
John had made it clear that night that things had to change, and they did; he found himself joining the Prince when he left to get documents, meet with mysterious individuals (or not-so-mysterious ones, since one of his main sources of information appeared to be the children working in the castle or living on the streets in the city) or fight some ruffians, now understanding and following the man’s strange schedule.
“Yes, we’ve heard you were his latest whim. Fat luck, that, but then I guess you should have known that it was better to run. Hopefully for you he’ll tire soon enough of having you around.”
“Did the Princess know it was tradition for another taster to be appointed to each member of the royal families in such a wedding?”
His uncertainties were played up in a most unexpected and unpleasant way on the following day as he went on his daily visit to Alte.
And yet, it was on such an unexciting case that John saw confirmed in the most unlikely way that he had indeed found his purpose as the Prince’s knight and companion.
The imposing man was very careful not to struggle in the guards’ grip, but his eyes skipped rapidly from side to side.
“Indeed. A most dangerous man, from what I understand. Yet he’s not the one we should truly concern ourselves with. There’s been talk of another, more sinister individual…”
His thankful smile immediately disappeared. Surely he had misunderstood her.
“The Lady!”
It was the right place in the conversation for a ‘why?’, and this was precisely the reason why Sherlock knew Mycroft wouldn’t ask.
The Prince’s voice rang with sincerity and bitterness; this wasn’t the answer John had been expecting.
John’s eyes widened as the regent closed his with a slightly pained expression and the young woman who wasn’t the princess paused mid-curtsey, cringing a little. Finally the former came forward once more, obviously choosing his words with care.
As a knight, even a temporary one, John was supposed to be allowed to sit down and enjoy his meal. As Sherlock’s recently-poisoned knight, however, he had to stand very near his Master, basically once more assuring the duties of a manservant and sending wry little glances to Sarah, who had actually been allowed to seat for the main feasts – someone else was apparently in charge of serving and testing the food of Princess Adler. He couldn’t feel too resentful, however, mainly because he knew the Prince had tried to make King Mycroft let him join the royal table and because he had feared for a moment the King would accommodate his brother’s latest fancy; having to stand for a few hours was much less unpleasant than actually sitting at the aforementioned table and having everyone staring at you.
“No matter how remarkable Princess Adler is, as a woman she can’t truly have power over Bohemia before she marries. Hence our rushed engagement.”
Understanding the question wasn’t truly meant for her, Lady Sarah remained silent even as the room, which had become almost quiet, erupted once more in indistinct chattering. Lord Astair seemed ready to start protesting once more, but fell silent as Sherlock asked the guards to escort Colonel Moran to the royal table.
“Everyone, I’m happy to say that we’ve found our missing knight!”
It was a totally novel experience, and yet a ridiculously recognizable one. It also seemed to him to have been what he had been searching for his whole life, he whispered between kisses as they tumbled into bed, guessing rather than seeing Sherlock’s raised eyebrow at this absurd notion in the darkened room, feeling against his neck the smile the Prince couldn’t contain.
“What do you mean? You’ve already got lost once in this castle, and I have to go back to my chambers anyway. You coming with me is the most practical arrangement.”
John followed reflexively before actually registering what the man had said. His eyes widened as his step faltered. Our rooms?
“If you get tired of being around him all the time, just drop by the kitchen and ask for my name – I’m always around anyway.”
Having shared a room with an elder sibling for thirteen years he was well accustomed to the necessity of compromises when living with someone and he could certainly have dealt with the Prince’s eccentricities if it hadn’t been for the one habit John couldn’t accept or get used to.
“John, for Mercy’s sake. It’s barely more than a scratch.”
Sherlock absently let his fingers run on the yellowed page before him, obviously searching for an exact-enough translation.
It could have been a rejection. Sherlock’s voice was unreadable but his hands gave him away, instinctively flexing as if desiring to reach out for John.
In the end, it was a good fight; the duel lasted close to fifteen minutes, and it certainly didn’t lack in animation for the knights standing around. John’s adversary was lithe and fast, making up in agility what he didn’t have in strength; he was as imaginative and tricky as the Blond had been conventional, and his fighting style was actually a lot like John’s. In the end, John reflected ruefully from his position on the ground, it had come down to experience. He couldn’t help but feel disappointed, however, and he must have looked forlorn indeed because his adversary held out a hand for him to take.
“Of a sort.”
“Oh, what a wonderful fight this was! And what dashing figures you struck! I can’t thank you enough, Sire, and you, sir?”
King Mycroft threw him a quick glance, as searching and thorough as his brother’s had been. He had the feeling he had just been neatly categorised as uninteresting and that he would have been forgotten soon thereafter if he hadn’t been in the Prince’s company.
Sherlock only nodded, finding to his surprise when he got to his feet that the limbs he had painstakingly trained into submission for the past twenty years were disobeying him as they hadn’t since sudden growth had left him a thin, gangly lad. Ella’s lips thinned a little as he uncharacteristically stumbled to John’s feet but it seemed to be in concern rather than in disapprobation or even in surprise as she said nothing. Soon enough the knight was lying on the Prince’s large bed, his head almost swallowed by the too soft pillows Sherlock always threw on the floor before he attempted to sleep. Ella efficiently took John’s pulse, tested his pupils’ dilatation and felt his forehead.
It was ungracefully that he had finally admitted to himself that the answer to this particular mystery eluded him, but admit it he had – and that’s why he was now very carefully following the traces of Colonel Moran in the forest outside the south side of the castle, aware even as he cautiously made his way on the well-trodden path the man had created in the last two weeks that he might well be – oh, the indignity – walking into a trap.
The reigning silence was soon broken by footsteps, however; and as he raised his head, he found that he was looking into inquiring grey eyes once again.
Sherlock gave what John had a long time ago named his shock-induced blink and for the first time he admitted to himself that one of the reasons he liked surprising Sherlock was because seeing the shadows those long lashes struck on the man’s high cheekbones was terribly enticing. And then he didn’t have any time to reflect on hands or eyelashes anymore because they were kissing, and though a small part of him couldn’t help reflecting on the most surprising parts of this (he had never kissed anyone so tall before, nor so thin, and Sherlock’s lips were somehow warmer than any his had ever touched) most of his attention was caught by the ways Sherlock was incomparably Sherlock and inevitably familiar. Because the Prince had freed his right hand, which was now possessively gripping John’s neck and pressing him closer to Sherlock, but his left wrist stayed in John’s firm grip, a gesture of trust rather than submission. And though there was certainly passion in their embrace, Sherlock’s tongue inquisitively seeking his out and exploring the roof of his mouth was clearly him studying John, trying to understand and comprehend his friend in yet another way.
“You’ll learn my name soon enough, John – allow me to benefit from my glorious anonymity for a few more days. And now, I really must depart, before those thieves awake, and you need to find Alte. Good day, John; I have no doubt we’ll meet again soon.”
“The choice of Sir Bolmir as a knight had nothing to do with money, Sherlock.”
“What does it mean, then? What you just read?”
“When then?”
Eventually, though, every guest was let into the castle and assigned to a room – John spared a compassionate thought for the poor castle’s help, which had been working relentlessly for the past two weeks to make sure everything would be ready in time – while the Princess, her regent and their trusted advisors were ceremonially brought into the throne room for an official welcome. Sherlock went along, of course, and thus John did too, marvelling as always at the richness of the décor.
Sherlock’s eyes widened for a split second, reflecting his surprise; in spite of everything, John felt the relief he usually associated with the Prince’s bewilderment, having obscurely understood that those too-brief moments were one of the main reasons Sherlock kept him around as his knight.
“Atropa Belladonna, without a doubt. Rapid pulse but his eyes are slow to respond, and his skin is flushed but dry. Still, I wonder…”
No, nothing could have made him hesitate – except for what the Prince actually did, of course.
“I’m sure, Sire.”
Before the Prince could find his voice again, John disappeared in his room to look for the right materials to create a poultice. Unseen from his knight, Sherlock’s lips stretched in a rare smile.
“Oh, the royal guard did a marvellous job of rounding them up and carting them off to gaol” the man answered, and John fancied that his voice was sufficiently sharpened by irony to be considered a weapon in itself. “They are to be judged before the moon is full again.”
Meeting those eyes was suddenly difficult.
Now that he had reassured himself of John’s continued existence he should have gone to the kitchens, to ascertain whether the servants had seen anything or anyone suspicious there, or to Mycroft, to discuss the situation and the measures that would have to be taken. The thought that John could reawaken at any moment to find him gone, however, made his inwards twist in a definitively unpleasant way, and he finally sent Billy on his way with a gold coin the kitchen boy gasped over before settling on the chair the boy had just left. There would be time to observe and deduce later – right now, ridiculously enough, nothing seemed quite as important as to make sure that John was safe and breathing.
“Oh, we know enough. Or at least, I do.”
But why such an attack? Poison slipped in a mug of ale, this certainly felt personal. John had only been in the capital for less than two lunar cycles – who could have desired revenge? A slighted lover wasn’t likely – Sherlock would have noticed if John had found someone deserving of his attention. He also doubted John had actual enemies, considering how ridiculously good-natured the man was. No, this was certainly an attempt to make Sherlock react – here he had to pause in his reflexions to unclench his fist, quite surprised to feel his nails had made themselves at home in the skin of his palm. To scare him, perhaps. To warn him? It didn’t make much sense, considering Sherlock wasn’t working on any case for the King right now, having refused the four last ones offered to him as being too boring before carefully avoiding his brother’s smirk as the larger man implied without a word that his ennui had more to do with his knight’s hurt shoulder than the Prince would like to admit.
This time, the surprise was clearly registered on the man’s face.
“Indeed I saw him, Sire.”
“My Lords, it’s indeed a pleasure to see you again! Sherlock, I hope you have kept the painting of me I’d left you with.”
Although the other man didn’t dress anything like he’d expected the knights to, it’d at least explain the quality of both the man’s fencing and clothing, as well as the fact that the royal guard seemed to regard him with such reverence. The grey eyes seemed to dance a moment, as if they were amused by the query, before the man answered.
Before John could determine if he’d just been insulted or complimented or even thank the man for his help, he was alone once more. Shaking his head slightly to clear it, as any time spent with the mysterious man seemed to fill it with both unanswered queries, he knocked on Lady Hudson’s door.
“Hello, John. I’m Sherlock.”
The ‘cases’, as Sherlock referred to them, seemed to slowly take over all parts of his life now that he accompanied Sherlock on them, and John fairly suspected the Prince to accept more of them on purpose or even to look by himself for mysteries that had little to do with things a King would ask a Prince to take an interest in. Indeed, some of the cases certainly had “interesting features”, to borrow the Prince’s turn of phrase: John thus found himself looking for a small blue gem in a poultry market, trying to decipher an ingenious code made of small drawn dancing men that was revealed to be nothing more than a means of communication between two secret lovers or even listening to the bewildering tale of a red-headed man who had come all the way from the city of Coburg to complain of his sudden unemployment. Many of the cases, however, weren’t noteworthy, mostly involving ridding the royal grounds of thieves and ruffians.
“Sherlock, honestly, when will you stop this infantile behaviour? I assure you, your belief that I don’t have better things to do with my time than to run after you is quite unwarranted – and you were supposed to be in the throne room an hour ago.”
Three weeks ago John would have misunderstood those sentences. Now, however, he thought he knew Sherlock enough now to understand that the man didn’t desire the Princess, no matter how lovely she was. Yet, he understood in a sudden moment of clarity, it was still a matter of jealousy. Not knowing where this insight came from, he knew he had to check whether he was right all the same.
“I- Alte wouldn’t have gone very far, I’ll find her easily. How did you know about my wish to become a physician?”
“I suppose you could say that. No need to trouble yourself with going all the way to the kitchens, in any case – I’ll lead you Lady Hudson’s quarters myself.”
The world seemed to tilt a bit to the side; John dimly thought he should get used to this sensation, considering it seemed to happen often enough when near the Prince.
“I meant I refuse your job offer. Your Highness.”
“It had occurred to me to wonder why you would suddenly be so concerned about Princess Adler’s reproaches concerning our security. What has happened?”
“Your sarcasms don’t reach me, Sherlock. I know of your feelings towards what is left of our parents’ lifework, and you know I don’t share them. I’ll do whatever is necessary to keep our heritage intact.”
After living in the castle for one month and a half, John really shouldn’t have been surprised by the time it took the approaching cortège to enter the fortress, but he was anyway. The welcoming party he belonged to had had to stand for what seemed like hours as Bohemian guards and guests slowly made their way into the building and John had wished more than once that he’d be allowed to get back inside and rest his feet a little. To distract himself, he started observing the rather magnificent show the colour of the noblewomen’ dresses created and even tried to apply what little he had learnt of Sherlock’s method to know more about the people whose eyes he met, with little success however.
The two men knew by now just what they were capable of together: the row should have been over promptly, and for a while it seemed this way; but then everything went wrong very quickly. John stumbled on a tree’s large root. Sherlock whirled around in concern, blocking the attack coming from his right while doing so. A man they had both thought incapacitated painfully got himself up on his elbow and tried to stab at the Prince’s shin. His aim was off but it was enough to distract Sherlock, and John’s throat closed off as he saw that their fifth opponent, who had stayed a bit outside the fight until then, was about to take advantage of the Prince’s momentary lapse of attention. Rather than scream a warning the knight literally threw himself at the attacking man, heedless of the danger involved in such a daring move. Brutally shoving the Prince aside, he tried and failed to repel the blow, biting his lower lip hard enough to taste blood as the sword left a trail of fire-like pain in his left shoulder. Immediately pressing his hand to the deep gash there, he stumbled against the large tree they had been fighting under as the Prince defeated their two remaining adversaries faster than even his trained eyes would follow.
“Please, Sire, let me take a look at it. You’ve already deduced I had some training in the healing arts and-”
“Was it? Then I must definitively congratulate you on the successful arrest of this suspicious individual, Gregson. I’ll take care of the rest – return to your post.”
“What the devil-” interjected John, almost too startled to make sure Alte didn’t trample the strange creature that had seemingly appeared from nowhere. His surprise soon made way to anger, though, when he realised the other man was still firmly grasping Alte’s reins near her mouth, effectively preventing him from moving forwards. “What do you think you are doing, sir? Someone has called for help; surely time is of the essence here!”
Alte, although a robust and placid mare, was no war mount and was clearly getting nervous. Running quickly through his options, John decided to dismount. While this meant that harm had more chances to come his way, it also made sure that he wouldn’t get thrown off in the middle of the battle and that Alte wasn’t going to be killed – what’s more, he had never really trained as a cavalry man, and knew he’d be more at his ease on the ground. Slapping Alte on the crop and distractedly checking she had gone through the rather loose circle of men surrounding them, he found himself in a position that was both very familiar and total unknown to him. He had already battled several opponents at once, but never some that seemed so keen to see his blood; and he had often fought along comrades, but they were people he knew better than he knew himself, rather than a black-haired stranger. This was discomforting to say the least; he knew nothing of the other man’s habits and abilities, had no way to know if he could be trusted to watch his back.
This meant that Mycroft had missed the hidden depths of this man, even after a second glance. A delighted smile curled the Prince’s thin lips. He now had the proof that he’d been right; learning to read and understand John Watson was going to be the most interesting challenge he had had in a while – and once he was done, surely John could become part of the royal knights or something, so that he didn’t have to bother with the other man anymore.
Much later – for once, the Prince hadn’t jumped from his bed at dawn, and not so much as a page had come to knock at their door – John awoke to find his nose engulfed in a warm and tickling nest of raven-black hair and a stupid smile already stuck on his lips.
His companion, who had casually started to sift through the ruffians’ belongings after tying them securely together, straightened to look at him, and he was struck anew by the particularity of the other man’s appearance. Although John was by no means a tall man, he had rarely met anyone who towered over him this way, and certainly he had never met so thin a man among expert fencers, as his interlocutor has proven to be. Very pale skin was made paler still by the contrast it presented to the man’s long black coat (again, of a quality he had seldom seen before), its lack of colour highlighting the light grey eyes that were steadily gazing at him.
