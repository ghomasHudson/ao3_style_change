Dean fished in his glove compartment for a pen and paper and scribbled down the address. As he was writing, he wondered if this was the sheriff’s home or the address of the local jail.
“Oh, Dean! Is this what the bond is meant to feel like?” Cas whispered. “It’s, wow. I had no idea. Thank you, Dean. Thank you for letting me truly mate you. I love you. I really, truly love you.”
By the time it was early evening, the lack of food and sleep finally took its toll on Dean. They were being escorted to yet another interview, when Dean’s eyes felt heavy and his legs turned into jelly. He just collapsed onto the ground as unconsciousness took him.
The alpha unchained Dean and lifted him over his shoulder and carried him into an adjoining bathroom, placing him gingerly next to the shower. Dean felt light headed and weak. He wanted to continue to fight, but right now he couldn’t. Instead he decided to bide his time until an opportunity arose to escape.
Getting the tattoo hurt more than he’d expected, but it was a small enough design that it was completed quickly. Soon Dean and Castiel were driving back to the estate with enough time to take another shower before the family dinner they were expected to attend.
Unable to keep his knees under him, Dean collapsed, barely nodding in response to the question. He keened while Castiel began to fuck him roughly. It was all too much, and he couldn’t help the sounds he made as his ass was pounded into the mattress, his oversensitive cock being rubbed against the wet, sticky towel beneath him.
Snuggling deeper into Castiel’s embrace, Dean nodded. “Hmm, I like the sound of that. When did you get so wise about this intimacy stuff?”
Dean felt another pulse of semen spill into him and the alpha moaned softly as he continued to lick at the mark he had made. “You’re everything I ever wanted in a mate, Dean. I’ll spoil you rotten if you let me,” the alpha whispered into his hear.
before him. If there had been, did they choose to leave or did Castiel grow bored and send them packing? The man didn’t seem like he’d treat anyone cruelly, but maybe that came later. With all the sadistic equipment in the basement, it was certainly possible.
“Yeah and I’ll never stop being defiant. You can count on that. You gotta learn to treat omegas as equals.”
“Indeed I am,” Castiel said. “He’s been very good so I want him to pick out the design and choose where it goes.”
Castiel was about to speak in protest when Dean grabbed his shoulder. “I got this. The Pythagorean Theorem is a fundamental relation in Euclidean geometry among the three sides of a right triangle. It states that the square of the hypotenuse, which is the side opposite the right angle, is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides. The equation for this is
“I…I didn’t know omegas could fight it. That explains why I’ve been feeling off about us all this time. I thought it was because of all your defiance…I suppose in a way it was because of it though, wasn’t it?”
When Dean came back to himself, the sheriff was upright again, pounding into his ass earnestly. Now oversensitive, Dean whimpered as the continued fucking prolonged his orgasm, his dick valiantly trying to pump out more semen.
It wasn’t until dessert was served that the conversation caught his attention again. One of Castiel’s brothers asked a question. “How is the omega legislation bill going? Do you have enough senators to get it passed yet?”
A flush of heat raced across Dean’s face as he remembered the last time Castiel knotted him. It had hurt and felt so good all at the same time.
Castiel whispered a quick “thank you,” before Dean could hear the alpha furiously stroking himself. Mere moments later, Dean felt the hot splash of semen hit his ass. At least Castiel kept his promise and hadn’t touched or tried to molest him once while he was jerking off.
Dean and Castiel headed to the courthouse, along with an extra security detail. Castiel wasn’t taking any chances, either with the pups, Dean or himself. It was unlikely that his father had anything planned, but he wasn’t taking any chances.
Forcefully, Dean fucked up into Castiel’s unwilling body, burying his cock deep inside the angel’s vessel. There had been times when Castiel had craved more intimacy from Dean. He would have even been willing to bring Dean pleasure in this way, but not like this.
“I know, and I’m sorry I almost lost my mind and forced myself on you. I...ugh…there’s no excuse for it. I knew I didn’t have your consent. I’m glad you pushed me away and brought me to my senses. I’m just so sorry my father brutalized you like that.”
“I’m bringing my security detail with me then,” Dean said as he slowly stood and turned to make sure they heard and understood.
Dean merely nodded at that, noting the second time the alpha had said please in the span of a day. He wasn’t sure what the hell was going on, but he figured he could hold out until they got to wherever it was they were going.
They made it home and tried to relax until the evening’s election results. Gabriel decided to order pizza, and once everyone was fed and the pups were put back to bed for the night, they all gathered around the living room TV.
Nodding, Dean gripped the towel he knelt on tightly while his ass was filled with that glorious dick. Once fully sheathed, Castiel held himself flush against Dean’s reddened ass. “I want you to focus and squeeze me.”
Handing them over to Sheriff Novak, Dean couldn’t help but notice the enticing bulge in the sheriff’s slacks. Dean’s dick twitched again, and he knew he was soaking through the front of his jeans by now.
Dean bared down and all the fog in his brain dissipated instantly as the pain of the first pup starting to crest through his birth canal shot incredible amounts of pain through his body. If it was this painful with an epidural, he didn’t even want to know how it felt without one.
“Wow, sneaky,” Dean said with a chuckle. “I missed you. I had your scent in the room for awhile but even that eventually faded. I worried about what might have happened to you. I tried not to worry too much because I didn’t want to stress the pups, but I couldn’t help it.”
“Come, I think we’ve left the pups alone with the nanny long enough,” Castiel said as he led Dean back to the waiting limousine.
Cas fed Dean a piece of bacon before responding. “No. He’s been perfect lately. He was just a bit jittery this morning because I’m taking in to get some piercings done today. I hadn’t quite decided on which ones I wanted the last time we were at the shop. I thought a more vigorous spank might calm him.”
“You are just earning yourself more punishment, pretty one,” the alpha said as he sidestepped the kick and swiftly secured Dean’s left arm. Dean continued to kick, but he was quickly  put off balance as the alpha pressed a button, which began to raise the chains, pulling Dean up to his toes. It was all he could do to balance on them without putting too much strain on his arms and shoulders.
Dean was surprised when the alpha led him toward a door that led downstairs, into the basement of the house, instead of up to his bedroom. “Where are we going, Alpha?” Dean asked, his heart rate picking up as they descended.
when they arrived back at the estate. Dean came out of the bathroom and scowled at Castiel who was sitting on the couch waiting for him. “Are you absolutely sure this is necessary?”
Dean’s heart raced. He’d been fighting against getting closer to this man, but ever since Castiel had taken him to that cabin, he’d slowly wormed his way into Dean’s heart. Dean actually felt sorry for Cas when he saw him crying.
“I had no idea you were so sentimental,” Castiel said as he turned. “Alright, you may hug me, but then you’re washing my back.”
Sam had been right about Dean. He was always a mess after losing Castiel, and this time was no different. He was no longer a young man, and his broken heart couldn’t take the strain. A few months later he followed Castiel. He was sorry to leave Sam behind, but he knew that his nephew would take good care of his brother until it was his time.
“Kinda, yeah,” Dean admitted. “But if he sees how happy I am with my alpha, I’m sure he’ll change his mind!”
Leaning his head against Castiel’s shoulder, Dean chuckled. “I don’t know why I’m so damn nervous. You’d think I was a blushing virgin or something.”
“Nah, they’re fine,” Dean reassured him. “I’m sure they can feel how happy I am right now, to be back and safe in your arms, filled up with your knot.”
Castiel continuing being nice to him when his body was practically begging to be fucked. Dean almost gave in right then and there. Cas was clearly also aroused and he smelled
Castiel slipped out and lay down next to Dean. He was still clearly hard and aching himself, but he was putting Dean’s needs before his own. “Dude, do you know how much this means to me, this right here? I asked you to stop and you did. That can’t be easy for an alpha to do.”
“It was a couple of months before your birthday. Some goons that said they worked for the Novak Corporation came by the shop and asked to speak with me. They seemed to know all about your mom and our activities in the Omega Freedom movement. They knew you were about to turn eighteen and they insisted that you be on the registry. Or else.”
While Cas was kissing him senseless once again, he reached over to his nightstand and pulled something out of the drawer. Looking over, Dean laughed when he saw it was a bottle of lube.
“He had this rule,” Dean explained. “All omegas in his household had to be spanked, twice daily. If their bottoms weren’t red enough for his liking, he’d give them some extra or order their mates to do it.”
Once Castiel was done changing, he put Dean on his leash and led him out to the car. Dean decided instead of looking excited, to look slightly miserable, to keep up the pretense of not wanting the
Suddenly, the bowl on the table sparked and smoked. “Ah, your collar is ready. Say goodbye to the last coherent thoughts you’ll ever have.”
Dean watched the alpha make his way back towards the bedrooms before getting up and clearing away the dishes from their small meal. After having been confined to a bed for nearly a week, he was keyed up and feeling the need to occupy himself with something.
Moments later, Dean and Castiel were snuggled into each other’s arms, catching their breath. Dean had to look up when he heard a small whine escape Castiel’s throat, and he saw that the former angel was crying.
Dean was just drifting off to sleep when he felt Castiel slide into the bed next to him and curl up around him protectively. Dean fell asleep feeling warm, safe and loved.
“As for the house rules,” Castiel continued. “You are expected to remain naked inside the house at all times. Even if I am entertaining guests. If you are cold, come tell me or my housekeeper Mildred and we’ll make adjustments until you’re comfortable.”
The alpha approached one and unlocked it with a set of keys he fished out of his pocket, before placing Dean in the passenger seat and buckling him in. “Stay put.
“I dunno what you mean by snitch, but…” Dean looked at Castiel for a long moment. “Yeah, you can trust him.”
After paying for the pie and being handed a large box with all the slices, Dean happily walked over to the bench where Sam and Cas were sitting. Plunking himself down between them, he offered them a big cheesy grin.
“No, they haven’t,” Castiel confirmed. “It’s meant to be used only in the most extreme circumstances, although I will have to agree that in my father’s case it was warranted.”
“Rule number one, omegas should be seen, not heard. You are not to speak or make other sounds unless asked a direct question or given a direct order,” the alpha repeated.
“Yeah, we can do that, just not right away. My father is going to be furious that I defied him. I need to lay low until he calms down. In the meantime, I was hoping you’d be open to a different approach in your training?”
“Oh, we are eons away from love. I don’t know if I can ever love you, so I will not make that promise.”
“I want you to come for me, Dean,” Castiel said. “Come for me and cry out my name, like you do in the shower every night.”
Leaning back, Dean’s eyes went wide hearing that from Castiel, his seemingly innocent former angel. “Please don’t tell me you learned
Trying not to enjoy what was happening, Dean relaxed enough to let Castiel finger him, feeling around for his prostate. Dean bit back a moan of pleasure when the angel’s finger found it.
“I’ll probably be in the training rooms with my new mate for at least a week, maybe more,” Castiel told his father. “It’s clear he was never given proper training by his family.”
The first thing he needed was a shower, so Dean went looking for the bathroom. He found it, stocked with towels and everything else he needed, so he stripped and made his way under the hot spray of water. For a few moments he just let the hot water cascade over him. Everything was so fucked up, but at least Castiel had started
Castiel shoved into him deep and hard, gripping his hair tightly for a moment. “I intend to enjoy your ass for as long as possible,” he growled before the hand in his hair softened its grip. “But you have been doing your best to be good. This is your first night as my kept boy, so I’ll be lenient. You may come, but you cannot whine about being oversensitive when I keep fucking you afterward. Deal?”
Dean’s pleasure kept building and his own hips began to meet the alpha’s thrusts, his back arching as the heat and tension inside of him built to a crescendo, before he finally came, squirting his thin omega cum hot and wet between them. That was one of the best orgasms Dean could ever remember having.
The moment the…instrument…whatever it was…landed on Dean’s bare ass, he screamed. John was smacking him full force. Dean tried to count them.
“I don’t want you to get hurt either,” Dean said, a knot of worry rising in his chest. “You’re mortal now, remember?”
They got Dean settled in Gabriel went to put on his scrubs and to scrub his hands and arms. He came back looking far more like the doctor he was. “Dean I need you to put your feet into the stirrups for me, so I can see how far your birth canal has dilated.”
“Yeah, I think he’d be thrilled about that,” Dean replied. “He always said I deserved a mate, not to just be owned like some sex slave.”
“At least stay until the pups are born,” Castiel insisted. “I think Dean could still use all of your attentive care. I have the guest house out back all set up for you, and I made sure to get all the equipment you need. If there’s an emergency, there’s also a hospital near the house.”
“Precisely,” Castiel said. “While we were apart, I did a lot of research in regards to omegas. I was surprised to find that omegas were once revered and practically worshipped in ancient Greece. That’s not something that we learn in school today. I know it’s something my father never wanted me to know.”
Finally, Dean could feel Castiel’s knot forming. This time it just felt amazing as it caught on his rim even while it slowly grew. “Are you ready for my knot, my love?”
Castiel turned and Dean just fell into his embrace, sobbing. The release of emotion overwhelmed him. Castiel just held him while he just let it all pour out of him, until he hung limply in the alpha’s arms.
Dean screamed in ecstasy when his orgasm slammed into him. His cock spurt untouched, rope after rope spilling onto the towel beneath him. His hands clenched, his toes curled, and his entire body shuddered as his orgasm was prolonged by the cock still fervently fucking him.
“Yes, father,” Castiel lied. Well, Dean hoped he was lying. A tiny part of his brain still worried that he was going to be betrayed yet again.
Sorry if you guys were hoping to find out the fate of the evil father-in-law, but trials do take months before they begin and Dean was too close to his due date. It just made sense for him to have the pups first. So, yay! Pups! :)
“I almost forgot,” Gabriel said as he pulled out something from his pocket. It looked like a life-alert bracelet. “Wear this and if you’re in any distress, push this button. It will alert me. It also monitors your blood pressure and heart rate so it will let me know if there are any other issues, even if you fall unconscious.”
Castiel nodded. “This is a personal preference of each alpha, whether or not to share their omega. Since I know you wouldn’t want to be used like that, I’d recommend you wear a cage while we’re at the estate. I know my father wouldn’t hesitate to use you once he’s seen how
Castiel yawned and got out. He pumped the gas first this time, before heading to pay the attendant who also seemed half-asleep. Hopefully the kid hadn’t been paying that much attention to the news. At least with a full tank, they should make it the rest of the way without needing gas again.
The judge looked up at him and seemed shocked at the state he was in. “Why are you trembling? Are you that frightened of me?”
Dean smirked at him as he grabbed a knife and cut away the rest of Castiel’s clothes. “Those sad eyes won’t work on me, you know. Another perk of being a demon. I don’t have a single shred of empathy left. Now, I can just do and take whatever I please. It’s awesome!”
Castiel had been driving for nearly an hour before he finally felt safe enough to pull over onto a dirt road long enough so they could stop and empty their aching bladders. “I’m going to take that stupid cage off of you,” Castiel said, taking the key out of his pocket. “You really don’t need it anymore. Feel free to take the plug out too if you want.”
“Good boy,” Castiel praised, easing his hold on Dean’s hair as he fastened the collar around Dean’s neck. The distinctive scent of leather hit Dean’s nose as he buckled it into place, followed by the unmistakable snick of a small lock.
By the way, I used Google Maps to help plot their escape route from Lawrence, Kansas, to Winnipeg, Canada (and then all the little detours they took). So, yeah there's this tiny town in Minnesota right on the border with an airstrip that actually runs from the US to Canada.
Again, Dean began to wonder what was really going on in this household. Clearly his father-in-law led the family, but to have a say in each of his adult children’s day-to-day lives seemed a bit excessive.
“Well, my father had a penchant for unusual Biblical names. When Dean suggested these names for the boys, I immediately agreed,” Castiel explained. “They are good, sensible names.”
Castiel looked at him with so much affection, Dean’s heart skipped a beat. “I don’t care. I love you, Dean. I mean that. I never want to hurt you again like I did. I…want you to love me too. I hope maybe, someday…”
Looking at the rock-hard cock Castiel was stroking, Dean could tell how much Cas wanted him. Castiel reached out and wrapped a hand around Dean’s own raging erection, as he guided himself toward Dean’s well lubed and stretched hole. “You’re very hard for me, aren’t you? Will you be good for me and take my cock?”
Dean stood and walked over to where a large blue curtain hung along one wall. He stood and posed for the photo.
Now Dean’s cock was getting fully on board and it made his face flush hot. “Okay, joke’s over. I don’t have time for this.”
When Dean tried to buck back and meet the man’s thrusts, he was given a sharp spank on his thigh. “Stay still and take your fucking like a good boy.”
“Wow, he must have been desperate to get that bill passed,” Dean remarked. “Was there a wiretap going on or something?”
“Your lips look so good wrapped around my dick, I’m almost tempted to just blow my load down your throat,” the sheriff said as he pulled his cock out. “But I can’t deprive myself of enjoying that delicious ass of yours again.”
The next time Dean woke up, he was still naked and gagged, but this time he was restrained on a medical table with his legs spread wide in stirrups. Dean immediately began to thrash in his restraints when the alpha in the lab coat came over and glared at him.
“Exactly,” Castiel replied. “An alpha will claim an omega by biting the back of the neck. This helps the omega remain pliant during his first claim and it releases hormones that trigger an early heat to help the first claim be a successful breeding if the omega is a carrier.”
Castiel’s vessel slowly grew accustomed to the rough fucking, his anus relaxing against the repeated intrusion from Dean’s cock. If his own dick hadn’t been caged tightly, Castiel was certain he’d have become aroused, as being fucked began to feel pleasurable.
The gag was loosened enough so he could speak. “Before, please,” Dean said politely. He was ready to have this over with so he could finally find out who his new alpha was.
Dean reached between his legs to stroke his now fully erect cock while Castiel kept fucking him with the dildo. “How do you want it, omega? Hard and fast or slow and gentle?”
Dean had a brief thought about making a run for it, but he was still too weak to make it very far and he had no idea where they were, so he thought better of it. He was slowly climbing out of the car when the alpha came around and helped him to his feet. “Come on, let’s get you some food.”
“C’mon, we have a plane waiting for you,” one of the border agents said. “They’ll fly you to Ottawa. The Prime Minister is waiting to meet you both.”
“I was hoping you would ask about that,” Castiel said. “You will be disciplined regularly to remind you of your place. We’ll start off with once every day and based on your behavior, I may increase or decrease it. It will never be less than once every week.”
Dean and Cas made their farewells and headed back on the road. They had a lot of ground to cover. They had another half-hour before the money would transfer and Dean hoped that Castiel’s dad didn’t find out and block it before it happened.
. Dean couldn’t believe it. He was now the omega of Dr. Castiel Novak. Ever since he’d fucked and knotted Dean at his clinic, Dean had been dreaming of him. He’d made Dean feel so full and gave Dean the best orgasm he’d ever experienced in his young life.
Once that was finished, they had to wait for the buyer’s acceptance to finalize the purchase. While they were waiting, they gave Dean some water to drink. Thankfully, it didn’t take long. Another man joined them when the money had been successfully transferred, wheeling in a cart with equipment for the final processing.
The alpha seemed to finally take pity on him them and he lowered the chains. Dean’s legs could no longer hold his weight and collapsed under him, so the alpha lowered him all the way down before coming over and removing the gag. Dean then proceeded to empty the meager contents of his stomach all over the floor.
“Day-to-day operations are run by the company president,” Castiel explained. “And Novak, Inc. has a Canadian headquarters in Vancouver. We could move there, or I could have a branch opened here as well. We don’t need to decide right now. The company won’t transfer into my name until after the pups are born healthy and my father has been sentenced.”
The alpha glared at him for a moment, before he leaned back in his chair with a look of defeat. “My father. We were having a disagreement. About you, actually.”
Castiel took some of the money he did have and they went shopping for the heat supplies for Dean, and they also bought themselves some clothes of their own, along with a few other personal items, before they returned to the hotel.
“Uh, yeah, buddy, you did! I – you can’t expect me to do that!” Dean bit out, anger showing. Cas frowned.
Dean swallowed roughly, looking at his best friend. Cas was tan, arms strong (from lifting books) and his legs strong (from hiking), he had began running in the mornings too. Dean liked to wake up and drink his coffee while Cas was on his run. Their bedrooms were right next to each other, and they shared a common bathroom, so they tended to wake to each other’s alarms. Sam would usually bumble into the kitchen by the time Cas got back, and the three of them would eat breakfast. It was the closest Dean felt to having a normal family.
“Well it will be doing nothing when I’m not around to spend time with,” he elbowed the other boy and grinned, only to be met with a  solemn face and eyes that were always too blue, both in color and in their emotional state.
“Okay, uh, Dean, I need to talk to you in the hall,” Cas said, with an urgent look on his face. He grabbed Dean’s hand – and sweet Jesus did Dean never want him to let go – and dragged him through a few doors to a space where no one would overhear them.
“Of course. God, Cas, of course. You don’t even have to ask. Which building are you in right now? I’ll be there in an hour.” It was a two-hour drive, but Cas knew better than to question Dean’s driving.
“Hey! Uh, Garth! How are you? Last time I saw you this guy was in bed. The hospital bed, I mean. Um. Yeah. What’s up?” he plastered a fake smile on his face as he talked to Garth. Cas stayed silent the entire time. Dean said a literal prayer in his head that Garth hadn’t mentioned the whole dating thing. Maybe Cas was just being his socially awkward self. But when Garth left them, Cas stayed silent. They went to the check out in quiet, but inside Dean was a mess of noise. His heart was beating loud and quick, he felt all his nerves as if they were on fire, and his thoughts were racing. They got to the Impala and loaded the groceries into the trunk. It wasn’t until they were both in the front seat that Dean looked at Cas. His face was blank.
“You’re off to college soon, buddy. I’ll be here, at Bobby’s, watching Sam. Taking care of Dad.” He said this more softly. He knew Cas wasn’t happy Dean never even applied to college with him.
“Will you come to the library fundraiser with me?” Cas asked, popping his head out of the office and looking at Dean with wide eyes. There was a question in his voice and in the way he stood. Dean knew Cas’s mannerisms way too well. He internally groaned at his own pathetic-ness.
Besides Sam, Eileen, and Bobby, Cas was the only person who knew who John Winchester really was. Cas was the only one who knew how John yelled and emotionally tore at Dean well into his adulthood.
Dean was in love with Castiel. His heart had latched onto the messy-haired nerd with a gummy smile and a terrible caffeine addiction. Cas was the best thing in his life. Every time Dean had a doubt, Cas was there. Whenever he wanted to just hang out or relax, Cas was there. Dean could never want anything or anyone when Cas was around. He’d never want anything but
Dean let out a small laugh, more of a sigh than anything. “Cas, buddy, everyone knows. I make you dinner every night. All the movie nights. I call you
The sound of a flutter of wings, one that Dean had heard dozens of times hit his ears. His heart practically flew. Sam and Eileen continued to put their groceries away, leaving Cas and Dean to be.
“What did I do to get you in my life, Dean?” Cas smiled down toward their hands again. He placed his other hand on Dean’s. “Hand sandwich.”
“I don’t know, probably. I haven’t told him. I will. I…Bobby, Dad hated this about me,” Dean said, voice rushed. “He hated Cas, hated that I lived with him, hated me for…for being a queer. I told him I wasn’t, but he knew and the night before…well the night before he died -”
“Boyfriend,” Dean cut in. He saw Cas’s eyes widen and Megs eyebrows rise slightly. “We’ve been together for seven years, it’s nice to finally meet you, Meg, I’ve heard a lot,” he grimaced.
“I…I’m sorry, Dean,” Cas cut in, frowning and refusing to meet Dean’s harsh glare. “I didn’t realize you felt so strongly about the topic,” he said. Dean looked at his face critically. Cas’s gaze was lowered, and his brow was furrowed, but his lips were trembling slightly, and his jaw was set. Sad? Why was Cas sad? If anyone should be, it was Dean.
Dean’s mind came to a screeching halt. Garth. Who thinks that Dean and Cas are dating. Who thought that they have been into each other since high school. Garth, who was talking to Castiel, and Castiel, who looked as if he had just been slapped across the face.
“Garth? Oh, god, how are you doing? I see you got through nursing school; I knew how much you used to bitch about that.”
, Cas had said. It was lasting poor self-image, and that led to more. Flashbacks, where Dean would zone out and he was suddenly a teen again and being shoved around by his drunk father. His nervous ticks and twitches. His jerky movements when anyone got too close to him or raised their voice. The amount of alcohol he consumed. By far, the flashbacks and anxiety were the worst.
Dean never said anything, but it was fairly obvious he was infatuated with Cas. He got some shit for it at the garage he worked at and their group of friends would even poke fun at him, but since Cas was never uncomfortable, he never bothered to move out.
Dean knew. He wasn’t as full of hot air as everyone seemed to think he was. Thirty-two-year-old Dean knew he had issues. Deny it outwardly he might, but he knew himself. He spent most of his day underneath cars working with only his thoughts and classic rock hits - that he kept on the radio for the specific purpose of fighting off annoying thoughts - for company. They were annoying thoughts about himself for the most part, though they often featured others. He had an annoying voice in his head constantly telling him how shit he was, and the irritating reminders of his young life were a barrier to moving forward.
Castiel woke to mumbling on either side of him. He tried to open his eyes, but they felt glued shut. His ears were ringing, a high-pitched squeal drowning out the deep murmurs from above. But above anything, he was cold. Castiel was freezing. He wanted to yell out to whoever was talking above him to warm him up, but his mouth had the same tight lock on it as his eyes.
“I happen to think they’re sweet,” Cas answered, coming up from behind Dean and selecting play on the menu.
“Cas, sweetheart. I love you. But first time with you I want you to be in your prime,” he grinned cheekily, still sitting on Castiel’s lap. Cas slid his hands up Dean’s thighs slowly, landing them on his hips.
“Hey, wait, maybe Eileen and I could come visit you and Cas this weekend? It would be nice to see you two.”
thing I have any faith in. You’re the closest to family I have, I just…I panicked, I – I. Maybe it was wishful thinking.”
“You’re everything, Cas. You’ve been my everything for so damn long. I need you to know. I’ve spent the last eight years trying to get rid of the guilt in my chest so I could tell you,” he cut off, stopping to take a shaky breath.
Castiel hummed in agreement, grabbing a dishcloth and waiting for Dean to finish scrubbing. “I would have liked to see her have a more significant role as the film played out.”
He wasn’t sure when he fell asleep, only swimming back into wakefulness and feeling a strange sense of emptiness and cold. He was also fully horizontal, stretched out on the couch, a pillow tucked under his head and a soft blanket draped across his legs. The vague, disoriented memory of last night floated up from his tired brain, resurfacing and pulling everything else with it.
Castiel capped his pen. “Change of scenery?” He shrugged. “I guess I wanted to teach an older age group, and when this position opened up, I jumped at the chance. Plus, middle school was enough the first time around,” he added.
He unplugged his laptop and stuffed it into his backpack, swinging it over his shoulder and giving his newly spruced-up classroom one last lookover. He still had to get the bean bags from his house and the textbooks from the front office, but that could be taken care of the next day.
If Dean hadn’t been on the verge of vomiting, he would’ve jerked bolt upright. Instead, he twisted his head around, got slammed with vertigo and flopped back onto the bed, panic now zinging through him. “I’ll be down in a minute,” he mumbled.
“Oh, of course,” Castiel sighed, biting the carrot off his fork. “They get saved at the last minute.”
Dean folded the corner of the page he was on and set the book on the coffee table, feeling drowsiness down to his bones. He yawned, stretching his arms above his head, feeling his muscles loosen and relax. Maybe it was time for bed; he didn’t remember a single thing in the most-recently-read chapter of his book and they
The holiday itself went about as Dean predicted: everyone gorged themselves on Ellen and Dean’s cooking (nobody else was allowed in the kitchen during Thanksgiving prep; Sam tried once and nearly got his hair shorn off by Ellen wielding a pair of scissors), Jo and Dean goaded each other into death-threat territory, and everyone was tipsy halfway through dinner.
And of course, he dreamed of blue and green and gold, spinning until they collided into something achingly beautiful.
“Yes, I could tell you were inebriated,” Castiel commented, and Dean let out a small laugh. “But—Dean, I want—I
His students did damn well, too: shy-face freshman turning boisterous and enthusiastic by the time the semester ended; harried juniors with too much on their plate learning to take steps back one by one and finally relax; tired seniors only there for the credit starting to participate when Dean provided
Dean thought, spooning more soup into his mouth, warily watching the three dots disappear and reappear seconds later multiple times.
Dean groaned, feeling Cas’s legs tighten around him and pull him close. “Cas, sweetheart—” he said, breathless, hands under Cas’s shirt and running up and down his sides.
Dean took  it. “Thanks, man,” he said, surprised, and twisted the lid off.  “You didn’t have to—” A wonderful aroma of cloves, cinnamon, and orange wafted out into the chilled air. “—never mind, you
“Hey, lookit you,” he murmured, tentatively stroking the scales around her midsection and feeling his body relax as the rational thoughts finally came back. He was stronger than this thing, snakes didn’t attack without provocation, and Castiel was here, Castiel was right beside him; Castiel was—
Jess reached towards the end of the table and slid his phone towards him. “You left it on the couch before you went to bed. I think.” She frowned. “I don’t remember too well. I was pretty drunk.”
They braved the frosty outdoors afterwards, bundled up in a good few layers to trod through the knee-high snow, to check on the chickens.. Castiel had done a good job of winter-ifying their hutch; he’d insulated the walls and set down a thick, hefty layer of bedding for the birds to nestle down in. Unfortunately, that meant searching for the chickens in the aspen was a little bit less
in all honesty. Cas’s words were never half-truths or white lies, they were always honest, down-to-earth, and—most of the time—kind. And he looked so open and genuine and
“Of course.” Dean replies softly. “I don’t think I’d ever forget. You looked like a kid with free reign in a candy store.”
Dean made a sympathetic noise, passing Castiel a piece of pie. He’d been trying out new recipes for a pumpkin one to bring to Bobby’s, bringing them to school that week to get Castiel’s opinion.
Dean squeezed his eyes shut, attempting to will away the headache at the back of his eyeballs. “Shit,” he mumbled, pinching the bridge of his nose. His neck ached from the awkward angle he’d slept in, and he could feel every vertebrae crack like bubble wrap when he stretched his back.
The third time (or fourth, or fifth, who knew anymore) this happened was four days before Christmas. He and Castiel had exchanged Christmas gifts the weekend before while bickering over holiday classics and sipping hot cider. Dean was right about the crocheted bees—Castiel’s whole face had lit up in childlike delight when he lifted them from the gift bag, and he’d kept one of them in his lap for the rest of the evening.
Cas plowed ahead, nudging his lips open to kiss him open-mouthed and burning hot, fiery paths through all Dean’s hesitations and inhibitions. He ran fingers through Dean’s hair, tracing his jawline, the hand moving to his waist rubbing his side through the fabric.
Castiel was clinking around in the kitchen, something sweet-smelling drifting down the hallway. He looked over his shoulder when Dean padded in, pausing in whisking whatever was on the stove. “Feel better?”
on his bedside table. “I still don’t understand why this is so important,” he grumbled, reluctantly standing and reaching for his coat. Dean grabbed his hand (Castiel tried not to think about it too hard) and tugged him out of his room.
—Dean managed to prevent their heads knocking together, jerking his head to the side just in time and getting a faceful of snow instead, but his entire body had slammed into Castiel, and Cas hit the ground on his back.
He’d said it before and he’d say it again: seven-thirty was much too early to get to school in the mornings. Who was even naturally awake by then, anyways?
Dean chuckled, walking alongside Castiel to his car. "Surprised you didn't know. Their adopted daughter, Alex, is a year under Claire."
he thought, feeling the weird undulations of muscle under scales as Marcy rearranged her large body on his lap. There was still a tight ball of nerves fizzling in his gut, but every stupid irrational thought seemed to just… melt out of his body.
were allowed, which Dean had taken advantage of many a time the past few years. The walls were even painted a lovely sky blue, whereas Dean’s classroom had one wall painted an odd shade of orange and the rest a light yellow.
“BCI,” Castiel corrected, clicking the lock on his door closed and standing up. “But you were close,” he added with a grin, turning towards the cottage.
The last dredges of tension between them had dissolved in front of the fire, melted away and replaced with something else. He had been comfortable with how they were—close, happy,
pies instead of just one. What else were they gonna do, anyways? “Nah. I’m all for pastry—where’s the cling wrap?”
be here: a warm, slightly drunk body next to Dean, using his shoulder as a pillow and probably reciting old Christmas folklore.
Dean thought, amused. “You said you’re shit at pie crust, right?” he mentioned casually, grinning cheekily when Cas shot him a glare. It was hard to take him seriously, though, when his hair was still a wreck from being tackled into the snow and his cheeks were red.
“Oh, ‘cause of Arya?” Dean laughed, sliding his hands into oven mitts and retrieving the blind-baked crusts out of the oven. “Yeah, can’t blame you for that one.
Castiel gave him a sleepy smile and nodded towards the French press, where a mug sat waiting for Dean.
Cas’s lips twitched upwards, a coy spark in his eyes. “So?” he said, looking Dean in the eyes. “Are you going to ask me for my number?”
It’s pouring buckets and Dean can tell he’ll have to rake the yard tomorrow (and probably get some candles out, just in case the power goes out again), but for now he joins Castiel, sinking down beside him and setting a hot mug of tea on the table.
Nodding, Dean reached out and patted Castiel’s shoulder. “Yeah, I’m good. Thanks for the save there.”
Dean ran up the stairs to Sam’s room, knocking on the door before he entered. He found Sam curled up on his bed.
Gabriel’s mouth tightened into a thin line as he nodded. “Yes. Dad wants to see you broken, and then he wants to make you the ‘
he was. Following all the idiotic rules Castiel taught him would be one thing. The one problem he knew was going to be able to keep his mouth shut. As Castiel came around to release him from the back, Dean took a deep breath
Stumbling to his feet, Dean went to fetch the hairbrush. The earlier conversation flashed through his mind and he realized exactly what the hairbrush was going to be used for. It was a solid wooden brush with black bristles, with a few strands of Castiel’s hair entwined. He took note of the heft of the brush as he carried it over to where Castiel sat on the edge of the bed.
NaNoWriMo went well. I now have an almost complete 2nd novel in my science fiction series that I'm writing. Afterwards, I needed a few days to recover from writer burn-out before I could dive back into this story. Thanks everyone for your patience! :)
Dean had no words, and just let it happen. Once Dean’s ass was filled with lube, Castiel slid the speculum out of him. Then he stood up and began undoing his belt. Dean’s eyes went wide when he realized what Castiel was planning to do.
“…and the protests have continued into their fourth straight day. People all over the America have joined in to voice their opposition of the newly proposed Alpha Rights Bill, which would effectively dismantle all current Omega Rights laws across the coun—"
“I… haven’t told Sam yet. I wanted to go on one last hunt with him, for old time’s sake, before hanging it up for good,” Dean said. “So, please don’t tell him yet, okay?”
“Maybe we should get dressed and have something to eat?” Castiel suggested and Dean heartily agreed.
This was wrong on so many levels, and Dean couldn’t understand how his family was suddenly complying with it all. After hearing John and Mary rail against the abuse of omegas, seeing them march in omega freedom rallies, and assuring him for years that they would never let that happen to him.
Dean knew his home state of Kansas would likely vote against, but as they began to watch the votes come in, they were once again shocked. Sixty-four percent in favor. “Woah, really? I never expected Kansas to vote in favor!”
“Now breath slowly through your nose,” the doctor instructed, and Dean had no choice but obey as he breathed in the purified oxygen and slowly calmed his breathing.
Castiel crawled over Dean in a dominant move. “I already know I can never make you do something you don’t want. My father’s not around, so you just keep telling me what you need from me.”
Castiel broke off the kiss. “Dean, stop thinking so much,” he said with a smirk. “I don’t have to read your mind to know you’re wondering why I’m the one controlling things right now. Yes, I know your proclivities, but also remember I used to lead a battalion in Heaven. I like being in control. Is that okay?”
That evening, Castiel sat down with Dean and talked through everything regarding his coming heat and made sure Dean was still consenting and would allow his mate to help him through it the way only an alpha could. Which would mean having sex. A whole lot of sex.
A moment later and Dean just wanted to crawl under a rock and hide. He was spread open like a Thanksgiving turkey about to get stuffed, each foot in a stirrup and his ass pulled down so it hung over the side of the table.
Castiel and the other alphas pushed their chairs away from the table. Dean caught out of the corner of his eye as the other omegas immediately took their places and Dean followed suit, draping himself over Castiel’s legs. Thankfully Castiel had spread his legs a bit, so Dean’s cock and cage could dangle freely. This was going to be uncomfortable enough.
Smiling to himself, Dean went back to the library and selected a book before making his way back to the bed. Making himself comfortable, he started to read. He knew all the while that he was being observed with all the hidden cameras and microphones everywhere.  Eventually, they’d have to send someone to check on him and feed him. Until then he could just bide his time.
Castiel had been trying to have dinner in private as often as possible. Dean hated the family dinners and spankings. Hopefully they’d be out of this place within the next week.
Dean relaxed and decided not to fight it when he was gently pushed over the padded surface. Then he felt as the alpha began to carefully apply the promised salve over all the marks. He hissed in pain every time one was touched, but the salve slowly soothed away the worst of the ache.
own jeans,” Dean said with a grin. Castiel rolled his eyes, smiling, and slung his backpack over his shoulder.
Dean flopped out of Cas's bed for the second time that morning, stretching his arms above his head and yawning. He pressed one more kiss to Cas’s lips, cherishing Cas’s happy sigh, and went to shower.
. Yes, it was old and small, but didn’t feel constricting. Plenty of natural light fell through the glass side doors, giving the small spaces a wider, sunnier feel. Small hanging plants soaked up light by the windows or sat in pots on the sills, the squishy sofa usually had a cat napping in the center, and Castiel
“Sort of,” Castiel had answered, sliding the card back in the box. “Although the animal in question would have been convicted by people, rather than those of its own species.”
it was more of a large, unoccupied plot of grass with an old, concrete basketball court off to one side. The farmers market—and today, a makeshift pumpkin patch—got set up there on weekends, and it was a lovely spot to relax outside in late spring and early summer. The swings-and-slides playground was farther down the block, and Dean could hear the laughter and shouts of young children echoing around the corner.
of them—would manage to get through the next few days, Dean had no idea. Last night, Dean thought he had nearly toppled the weird, wobbly balance they were in, being so close to Castiel as it was.
It felt weird: too large and open, no cats winding around his ankles or a fire crackling merrily in the grate. No Cas perched on the sofa, deep into a book with blankets strewn around his hips. No smell of cinnamon and woodsmoke and something herbal drifting from the kitchen.
“The vampire lore is incredibly off in this,” Castiel mumbled forty-five minutes in, frowning at Michael’s phantom-like appearance in the mirror. “Vampires would still show up fully in most modern reflective surfaces.”
Castiel chuckled, shuffling the syllabi into order in his arms and heading to his own desk to stuff them in his bag.
“Snakes can’t hear that well since their ears are internal, and they’re really not very smart,” Castiel explained, opening the door and reaching for the snake hook to lift up Marcy’s hide. “But they can be trained to recognize the difference between feeding time and interaction time. The light tapping on the glass alerts her into knowing I’m here to take her out, rather than give her food.”
The new guy was still working away in his classroom when Dean stepped out of his own to lock up, the faint sounds of cabinets opening and binders snapping shut and soft music playing—The Beatles, Dean thought—drifting through the partially open door.
The flickering, buzzing overhead LEDs thrummed into life when Dean flipped the familiar switch and stepped into his classroom.
warmth and electricity and space, since Dean had only one of the three. Dean stared at the message and swallowed, trying to will his cold-addled brain into something other than
Luckily, being at work with Cas wasn’t as weird as Dean though it would be; for the most part everything stayed relatively the same between them. Except now, Dean had started taking Cas to school in the mornings a few days a week, and he had to check his neck for love bites before leaving.
“Well, breadmaking takes practice.” Castiel said, gingerly squishing the flour and butter together. “Even
Dean snorted, fishing his keys from his pocket and holding them up. Dangling from the key ring, right next to the ones for his house and car, was a small round pendant colored blue, purple, and pink. He wasn’t one for a blinged-up key ring, but this was the only exception.
Cas smiled gently. “I asked what you’d like for dinner tonight. I was thinking about doing a sheet-pan roast with some veggies and bratwurst, but if you have a preference for something else…”
Castiel looked up, a small smile tugging at his mouth. He shifted in his seat, turning to face Dean more fully. “Vampires are from Balkan mythology, and the term actually used to refer to
Dean commandeered the United States end of the History department at his high school: Advanced Placement, Honors, Standard, and everything his high school had to offer in between. He mainly dealt with Civics and Economics, Government, and the occasional study hall-slash-hangout room during lunch and free periods, but once he’d gotten his Advanced Placement teaching certification he’d picked up AP United States History as well.
“Nah, that sounds good,” Dean said, sitting up to shuffle his own papers back into order. “You decided on what you wanna watch yet?”
“Hello, Dean,” Castiel said with a soft smile. He was dressed in a soft, worn gray long-sleeve with a hole at the hem and pajama pants patterned with owls. He looked warm and cozy, the oversized clothes falling in folds around his wrists and pooling around his ankles, his hair an absolute mess. Of course, he was holding a steaming mug of tea.
Castiel glanced down at their joined hands, before looking back at Dean and squeezing very gently. He nodded at the door.
A collective groan echoed through the room. “Where’s Mr. Novak?” piped up one of the girls at the back.
“Well, that helps, at least,” Jess said, beelining for the pastries Dean had so deliberately bypassed and handing ten bucks to the lady running the stand. “How often do you guys hang out?” she mumbled around a scone, once they’d set off again in search of her husband and Castiel.
The first thing Dean did was pull out a framed photograph of him and Castiel, bright smiles on their faces and arms around each other, and position it right by the monitor.
Dean laughed, slowly stroking the cat’s fur and watching Castiel ladle steaming hot chocolate into two mugs. “I’ll be in the living room,” he said. Castiel hummed a response.
Dean blinked. “Dude, you don’t have to apologize,” he said, frowning. “Ain’t your fault you conked out pretty hard.”
“It’s…beautiful, Dean.” Castiel had managed at last, his voice hoarse. He could feel tears in his eyes, washed away by the rain. “Thank you.”
Dean shifted his body, sitting up and leaning against the back of the sofa. He rubbed his eyes, yawning a second time. “What time is it?”
“I think I’m alright for now.” Castiel frowned. “I may need help with the computer and SmartBoard, though.”
He shuddered slightly, setting his bag down on his desk. “Heya pal,” he said, patting the blemished surface. “How’d summer treat you?”
He knew what Cas was saying: the words made sense in his head. He wanted to know if it was real, if what he felt was real, if
Dean gave a noncommittal shrug, ignoring the cinnamon sugar smell wafting from the local bakery’s stand. “I guess, yeah.”
“Cas,” Dean said firmly, leaning his forearms on his knees and staring at Castiel until he met his eyes. “You need to chill, bud. Big time.”
Partway through the movie, Dean’s front door banged open as Charlie let herself into the house, carrying—praise be to whoever was above—pie.
Dean slowly rubbed the ceramic between his fingers, terrified and yet yearning so, so much to look into Castiel’s face.
“Absolutely,” Dean said, looking down as something warm and fluffy brushed his pants. “Heya, Cleo,” he mumbled, scooping the cat into his arms.
Dean moved slowly down Castiel’s body, lavishing every ridge and bump and valley his skin made—the curve of his waist, the dips between his ribs and the soft hair on his chest.
He took a break around three in the afternoon to eat something and turn on music before diving back in to finish revising the last PowerPoint and a half.
“You ain’t gonna tell him, right?” he mumbled. “‘Cause he’s right across the hall”—he cast a furtive look at the door and lowered his voice even more, just in case— “and I’d appreciate it if this was just between us.”
Dean scooched himself backwards until he was out of the circle of Cas’s arms and stood up, grimacing as his cold, wet jeans stuck to his legs. Castiel sat up, cradling Albert to his chest and speaking sternly to the fidgeting chicken. Dean huffed a laugh and made his way over to the chicken coop, feeling his heart rate finally start to slow down and the tidal wave of burning
Instead of handing over his bag, he strode the short distance between them and pulled Cas into a hug. “Cas,” he said, his voice muffled in the man’s sweatshirt, layering as much gratitude as he could into his words, “you’re awesome.”
this strange, wobbling, wearing-thin line between them would snap, and, one way or another, everything would break with it.
He did brighten, however, at the email from Donna, the receptionist, containing a list of possible lunch options. Ever since his first year, he and Donna had spent at least one lunch a week together, generally accompanied by a baked goodie and plenty of gossip (as a receptionist, Donna had the inside scoop on
Dean paused on the landing, one hand on the door and the other still entwined with Cas’. He looked hesitant, and Castiel saw his Adam’s apple bob as he swallowed.
Dean hung up the phone with a groan, wrapping his blanket more tightly around himself and returning to the soup bubbling on the stove. He’d wait it out.
Charlie nudged the plate of cookies at him and patted his elbow sympathetically. “You’ll live, little Padawan.”
Cas stepped forward. “You can call me Cas,” he said, smiling warmly and taking Sam’s outstretched hand.
Castiel laughed softly, gently setting his pumpkin down by its fellows. “Are you getting that one?” he asked, straightening up.
“I won’t be stupid,” she spat, giving Cas one last glower before she left, pushing past Dean and out the door in a whirl of black leather.
Dean shrugged, scooping more eggs on his fork. “Didn’t want to. You were practically comatose anyways, man. Wasn’t possible.”
Dean took a rather large swallow of cider and set the mug down, grumbling at the cold settling in the opening of his blanket wrap and opening his brother’s contact information.
The guest room was small, but incredibly cozy. Castiel had turned on the room heater for him—Jesus, he really was an angel—as well as leaving a hot water bottle and extra blankets at the end of the bed.
,” Charlie said in answer to Dean’s raised eyebrows, releasing Sam from a death-grip embrace. “I was just as surprised as you!”
Castiel set the plate in the drying rack. “I don’t think so.” he said, spending a tad too long rearranging the dish cloth on its hook.
Castiel groaned, tossing his playing cards down and flopping back on the cushions. “How are you this good at card games?”
Dean slid his hands into his pockets, looking around at the piles of folders and binders and boxes creating a semi-circle around Castiel. “You want help?” he asked.
“My brother and his family are actually coming this year, too,” he sighed to Dean the Friday before break, during their thirty-minute lunch period. “Meaning I get to play mediator between them and everyone else.”
Dean raised both eyebrows, leaning against the counter with his arms crossed. “Ellen know you brought an extra one?”
Castiel nodded. “Turnips are more difficult to carve, though. And they look horrifying compared to pumpkins.”
He sighed and drained his beer, shoving a dozing Jo off the couch with his foot and earning a squawk and a whack with the pillow in return. Jess high-fived Jo, Ellen scolded the three of them, and Bobby, snoring in the armchair, cracked an eye open to glare at them before going back to sleep.
history, not the stuff in the textbooks written to brainwash teenagers into blind nationalism disguised as patriotism.
Castiel returned the wave before sliding into the driver’s seat, watching Dean’s old Chevy swing out of the parking lot.
“I was excited for this semester,” Castiel said, leaning back into the squishy cushions, brow furrowed. “My year-round students were doing well at the end of second term. I hope they still have the drive after break, especially after an extra week of vacation.” He sipped his hot chocolate. “What about you?”
To be honest, her retirement probably had had something to do with the senior pranks (a few of the seniors had filled multiple classrooms with either sticky notes, rubber ducks, or large googly eyes), or the spitball contest after lunch in the boy’s bathroom, or nearly fracturing her hip at the annual Faculty DodgeBall Tournament on the faculty's last required school day—why Mildred had even wanted to participate in that, Dean didn't know. School spirit, maybe?
Sam and Jess were already in front of the coffee shop, holding steaming to-go cups of hot chocolate and absorbed in whatever conversation they were having.
He gasped softly when Dean pressed their lips together before sighing into it, his hand leaving Dean’s to cup his cheek.
Dean tried to push himself onto his elbows to get some of the weight off his friend. That in and of itself was probably a mistake, and not just because of the snow now melting into his jacket sleeves—this position put Dean’s face mere inches from Castiel’s.
He wasn’t a fan of crowds—as a kid he nearly had a panic attack at a state fair, and it was only his brother, Gabriel, pulling him away from everyone that got him to calm down. Working in public education had helped a bit, although more out of necessity and survival than choice. But still: loud, constantly moving crowds of people set off his high alert,
of the light switch flicking off. He joined Dean in the hall and they set off together towards the stairs, the hallways feeling more empty than usual after the constant motion. Some of the other teachers waved goodbye while getting ready to head home, bidding ‘good nights’ and ‘good lucks.’
Dean grinned, propping himself up on his elbows to kiss Castiel’s cheek, nestling his face into the curve between neck and shoulder. “You’re awesome, you know that?”
Castiel lifted the hide out of the tank and set it on the ground. “Hello, Marcy,” he murmured, reaching into the tank to pat her scales. “How are you? I need to clean your tank today; I know, I’m terribly sorry you have to move,” he said, speaking as though Marcy was a person rather than an animal. “But I have a friend here to help. If that’s alright with you?”
“I don’t think Kaia can imagine that Claire likes her in the first place,” Dean said. “Or she can, but they’re both too scared to make the first move.”
Dean waved aside the apology. “It’s this little festival thing the downtown area does every October. The food’s pretty great, most of the shops and stuff set up tents outdoors, and it’s pretty fun to just walk around. Someone had a pet pig on a leash last year.”
Naturally, in a very Hollywood-style last-minute-hero fashion,The Knights of the Vale galloped onto the screen, weapons raised and banners streaming behind them to rescue Jon Snow’s dying men.
“Oh, I forgot to tell you,” Charlie said, dipping the stuffed grape leaves in sauce and transferring the whole thing into her mouth at once. “There’s a new teacher in Mildred’s old post.”
He spent more time watching Castiel than the show. Cas was entranced, excitedly commenting on openings or moves or the positions of the pieces. He’d use his fork—usually with food on it—to point out things Dean wouldn't've noticed otherwise.
Castiel thanked him again at the door, pressing a carton of fresh eggs into his hands before he left. “I owe you, Dean,” he said, “and I have chickens, I won’t run low.”
So instead, Dean ended up flopping on his couch rewatching old westerns with a beer and his Debby Downer-esque thoughts for company.
“Oh—yes,” Castiel blinked a few times and jerked his head towards the hall. “It’s right—well—you know where the bathroom is,” he mumbled, running a hand through his bird’s-nest hair.
,” Castiel replied dryly, turning to the side to finish peeling off his own layers. He was still trying to maintain a stony facade, but pale pink flushed the back of his neck.
“Cas got slammed with grading shit he has to do this Friday,” Dean explained, setting his sandwich down, wiping his hands, and reaching for his drink. “So I offered to help him out.”
Castiel’s eyes went wide and he sucked in a breath, a million emotions flashing and crashing behind his pupils. His lips parted like he was in awe, or shock, or relief.
Charlie and Gilda bounded through the front door at exactly seven o’clock, bearing metal tins filled to the brim with cookies and a large bottle of champagne. Ellen and Jo followed shortly afterwards, a crockpot of chili and a grumpy Bobby in tow.
Cas’s free arm wrapped loosely around Dean’s shoulders, keeping him close and steady by his side. Their soft laughter, unrestrained and free, faded into quiet again and for a moment they just breathed together—Dean tucked into Castiel’s side, Castiel’s head resting on top of Dean’s, listening to the slow rhythm of their exhales.
The rest of that morning’s lesson passed without issue. After handing out the project grades and going over that day’s lecture and classwork, Dean sat himself behind his desk and immediately checked his phone for something from Castiel.
The dam broke; it shattered, debris caught in whirlpools as heat exploded low in Dean’s belly, bursting like fireworks in showers of blue and green and gold.
Dean swept most of the cards into a pile, shuffling them into order. “Practice, Chuckles,” he answered, not even
Castiel reappeared, holding two mugs of hot chocolate, the steam barely escaping around dollops of whipped cream on top. “Here,” he said, gently handing Dean his before walking around the couch to join him.
Dean tackled Castiel into the snow again, kissing him deep and earning two freezing hands up his shirt. Dean yelped, Castiel cackled and yanked him in for another kiss.
Dean sighed. “Sam got me a little bisexual flag thing after I came out. Well, tumbled gracelessly from the closet. Anyway, yeah.” He jangled the keys for emphasis.
Castiel didn’t answer right away, but let out a deep sigh of relief and slumped against the back of the sofa, his shoulder pressing into Dean’s. “Yes, she’s at a friend’s house,” he answered, texting back a reply and tossing his phone on the couch cushion beside him. “She said we ‘need not worry,’” he said, closing his eyes and making half-hearted air quotes.
“Almost loses her shit, or spends the whole time mournfully watching Kaia?” Dean finished knowingly.
Dean could kiss him right now. He wanted to, desperately. Castiel’s arms were still around him, gripping tight to the cap of his shoulder and splayed across his back.
Charlie didn’t answer, gladly accepting the card box Dean passed her with a truly maniacal grin.“You’ll see.”
Most of the time now, they’d spend a good few hours grading and planning or whatever needed to be done, and then order takeout or finish off the leftovers in the fridge while bickering over television shows.
a morning person (the monster). Every day, without fail, he was already seated at his desk with a soft smile and a mug of tea when Dean poked his head in to say “hey” before unlocking his classroom.
Castiel started spooning wet food into the cats’ food bowls, speaking to the meowing felines in a low voice. Dean watched him from the sink, still reeling from ten seconds ago, when he—for the second time that day—had very nearly kissed the man now kneeling on the floor, sternly telling his cats to “watch your personal space; crowding each other isn’t nice.”
Dean grinned, jogging the rest of the way to the curb. “Hey!” he huffed, pulling her into a hug and slapping Sam on the back.
Castiel shrugged. “I wasn’t exactly in with the popular crowd. Being publicly outed by a teacher at a private Christian school didn’t do anything for my image either.” He glanced up again with a stiff smile, but his expression was guarded and a little hesitant.
A few minutes later, they were cradling mugs of hot chocolate, shoulder to shoulder with blankets draped over their laps, watching the embers in the fireplace glow and shift into shades of orange and red and white—no longer a crackling, lively dance of flames.
Castiel nodded slowly. “There’s some hot chocolate left if you’d like one more cup before bed,” he offered, his voice gravelly from sleepiness.
Before John died, it was a stiff, strange holiday that ended up fading into a day of “Merry Christmas—here’s a gift. See you in a week or three.” Now, though, it was Dean, Sam, Jess, and Mary spending a few days together, drinking eggnog and feeling like a real family should during the “Happiest Time Of The Year!”
The photo was dated in mid-October, from the Saturday Dean had dragged Castiel to FallFest. He and Cas were in the pumpkin patch, standing only a few inches apart, and Dean was smiling at something that must’ve been hilarious, eyes on the pumpkin in his hands. Castiel was standing close beside him, clutching his own wonky pumpkin, grinning and laughing along just as hard, but his eyes were on Dean’s face. He was watching Dean, angled towards him and looking almost… hopeful.
Dean huffed around his apple turnover, attempting to brush away the flakes of pastry clinging to his coat. “Weekends, mainly—Jesus, this feels like an interrogation for a murder mystery or somethin’—you trying to get me to confess?”
“—rather not have a repeat of last year,” Castiel’s hardened tone drifted through the door, followed by a scoff that was pretty much Claire Novak’s signature.
Dean loved his family—the weird, thrown-together, half-blood-half-not one he had. Sure, he had Charlie and Garth, Jody and Donna and Benny, all of whom he held very close to his heart. But the people right here, right now? They were his family.
Dean grinned and pushed his chair in, slinging his bag over his own shoulder and feeling a faint flush warming his cheeks. “Well, if you insist,” he said, pulling his phone out and handing it over with an exaggerated flourish.
Dean made a sympathetic noise. “You survived the worst of it, at least” he said, “meeting the parents.”
Dean let out a long breath of air, feeling the anxiety balloon in his ribcage deflate and a million different scenarios start to run through his head. So it
Castiel, after far too long a pause, gently wrapped his arms around Dean’s back. Dean felt him relax into the embrace, “Thank you, Dean,” he mumbled.
hides—little caves the animal could hide away inside: one on each side and one in the center that made a plateau-like ledge, large enough that Marcy could curl into a scaly donut and warm up under the heat lamp. And last but not least, there was a massive water bowl in the corner, like a miniature pond, large enough the snake could fit should she want to take a bath.
Dean could hear every deep, steady breath Castiel took, could feel the heavy, solid body leaning into him and his own yearning rising through his body.
“Sorry. I know this is one of your favorite films.” Castiel said quietly, rubbing the label on the bottle with his thumb. There was a light flush creeping up the back of his collar and he was ducking his head, curling his shoulders forward and looking a bit too hard at the damp paper dissolving in condensation.
Castiel sighed again, running a hand through his hair and mussing it up even more. “She had a really bad shed. I completely forgot to boost the humidity in her tank—I don’t know why—and I didn’t notice the regular shedding signs, and I guess—”
A few hours before the party found Dean stretched out on his mother’s couch, flipping through one of the books Castiel had given him for Christmas. He’d taken Dean’s passing mention of his liking of sci-fi to heart, gifting him a good few by his favorite authors—Robert Heinlein and Neal Stephenson—and the first in a series by Orson Scott Card, which Dean was working his way through.
If Dean were brave and brash, he’d say he knew what it was. And if he were even braver and brasher than that, he’d lean in and press his lips to Castiel’s.
He looked incredibly cuddly right then. Dean blinked, pushing away the thought. “I didn’t, actually.”
“Alright, then,” he mumbled to himself, stepping cautiously into his room and taking it all in. “Not too damn shabby.”
His only complaint was that Dean had an empty fourth period—or, the last block of school free, meaning he could get a good amount of his own schoolwork done
By a quarter to eight, everyone who had arrived gathered in the living room, making small talk or eating. Jody and Donna were chatting with Mary, with Alex (their daughter) playing darts with Jo nearby. Garth was trading work stories with Sam, their wives doing the same nearby. From Jess’s hand-miming, she was retelling one of the “I slipped and fell on my shampoo bottle in the shower” ones.
“Cas?” he murmured after a minute, maneuvering his arm from being squished between their sides and around Castiel’s shoulders. “Cas,” he repeated, lightly tapping his arm.
The rain blurred the world. It softened harsh edges, it made everything seem brighter. The green of the surrounding trees was deepened, the browns darkened, the contrast more stark than ever.
It still sucked, but getting it done with Castiel made the work feel more bearable. That's what friends did, right?
"Yeah, I got one too,” Dean sighed, remembering the two-inch binder he'd been gifted. “Though most of the stuff in there's outdated.” He still had it, though: there were some damn good recipes slipped between some of the pages.
The last dozen-plus-two went faster with the incentive of food. The cats had also decided to watch from the arms of the couch, too, rather than chew on the essays.
The fireplace was lit again, Cleo and Petunia curled in their cat beds in front of it. After  frying up grilled cheeses and bickering over what to watch that evening (Cas was thinking about starting
Thirty minutes later found them seated on top of one of his desks, gyros from the Greek deli down the street in hand, the conversation turned to a friendly debate over the questions from the local bar’s Trivia Night, which Charlie managed to drag a grudging Dean into participating in (and he’d
“Dean?” Castiel’s voice said from the doorway. Dean looked up, and Cleo took the opportunity to jump onto his lap.
The other end of the couch dipped as Jo flopped down by his ankles, rosy-cheeked and tipsy. “You’re not gonna shove me off again, are you?” she mumbled, attempting to push his legs out of the way.
“Mff,” Dean mumbled around a mouthful of chewy, buttery bread. Castiel really was an excellent cook.
So when he got to school at eight a.m. one Thursday, the sight of Krissy Chambers waiting outside Castiel’s empty and locked room gave him a twinge of confusion and unease.
“You’re here? And you didn’t even text me?” she complained, punching him in the shoulder before tackling him in a hug. “I haven’t seen you in
Surprisingly, Alex won the most amount of rounds, earning an exasperated look from Jody and a cackle from Donna. Usually—depending on who was there—Dean, Jess, and Charlie played nearly to the death for the winning cards, competitive enough that the other participants stopped trying to win altogether.
slightly buzzed, but the water he'd switched to an hour ago had cleared his head a little. “I didn’t drink enough to make driving unsafe."
Castiel stood, setting his plate down in the sink to deal with the next day. He bent down to pet Cleo, who was busy winding around his ankles. “Dean likes you, did you know that?” he said to her, scratching behind her ears. Cleo purred, leaning into his palm.
Cas jerked his head up, blinking his eyes open. Dean was standing in the doorway, leaning against the frame, hands lax in his pockets and an understanding smile on his face. He’d dressed “business casual” for the evening in tan slacks and a pale green button-up that brought out his eyes; quite the opposite from the t-shirt and jeans Castiel was used to seeing him in. There was a pen sticking out from his breast pocket and his black backpack hung from one shoulder.
Dean cracked a grin, taking a sip of coffee. “So, uh,” he cleared his throat, “any plans for today?”
emails, he thought about replying with the list of their child’s missing assignments. He didn’t—but it was a tempting thought).
Dean seated himself at the table with his soup, watching the little ellipsis blink as Castiel typed back.
“Snitch,” Dean mumbled, glaring at the ceiling from between his fingers. He knew Sam was right; he’d gone over the thought of his lips touching Cas’s a million times in his head, all in differing states of regret, shame, giddiness, pleasure…
Dean had nearly forgotten the wonder of a hot shower. He stood under the steaming spray, relishing the heat and water pressure, until he felt guilty about the amount of water he’d used.
Donna looked like she might say something, but she just shrugged. “Apple turnover?” she asked, pushing the pastry box across the desk.
“Alright. I just hope you don’t double cross me once we get back to the estate. You ain’t seen defiant yet if you do.”
Crawling onto the bed and centering himself on the towel, he presented his hot, throbbing ass to Castiel. “Fuck, your pretty ass looks so good like that,” Castiel said with admiration. “Scoot back, I want to be standing when I take you.”
Dean smiled into the kiss as he flipped his brother the bird. Out of the corner of his eye, Dean could swear for a moment he saw Chuck and John giving each other a high-five.
“Well, we’ll see,” Dean’s father-in-law said as he walked around them. “I see you gave him a proper spanking before coming home. Very good. However, you know what I’ll do if he steps out of line.”
A week after Dean’s TV had fritzed the first time, it kept doing it, and he caught snippets of news. He was surprised that his father-in-law hadn’t nipped the entire thing in the bud and taken away his TV. Surely the old man must know, with all the surveillance in his room.
Dean’s father-in-law was suddenly hovering over him with an angry scowl. “It had to be you. Out of all the omegas in this house and out of all my sons. My rebellious son and his defiant omega had to be the ones to produce my coveted triplets!” he growled.
The jangle of keys in the lock startled Dean out of his reverie. His new alpha was home. Dean broke out into a cold sweat, and his heart hammered in his chest. As much as he wanted to know who this alpha was, he was equally terrified to find out.
“There’s a new amendment? What for?” Dean asked and Gabriel shushed him as he pointed at the television.
After having dusted and removed all the dust covers from everything, Dean rooted around in the pantry and found enough fixings to make some dinner, so he started to cook. Castiel finished his nap by the time Dean was almost done.
Ever since that night, Dean’s been chasing that high. He’d tried fucking himself with dildos, vibrators, even prostate massagers. They all felt great, but he couldn’t achieve the same level of orgasmic transcendence.
With fresh tears brimming in his eyes, Castiel smiled at him and nodded. “Yes, Dean, and it’s beautiful. You’re beautiful.”
When Dean woke up, he immediately realized he was naked, on his knees, with his hands chained above his head and his mouth gagged with a bit. His eyes flew open as he remembered his last moments of consciousness, only to stare into his father-in-law’s scowling face.
Castiel looked utterly confused and was for once speechless. He stared a Dean for a moment before turning around and leaving. Dean was cuffed to the bed he was in—of course—so he couldn’t follow him.
It’s mid-afternoon the next day when they make it back to the bunker. After they’ve made it down the stairs, Cas pulled Dean aside. “Now, Dean.”
“After the press conference, we were escorted to the back entrance of the building,” Dean recalled. “What we thought was our limo was waiting for us, but as soon as I got in, they grabbed me and knocked me out with chloroform or something.”
It was gentle and chaste at first, just a press of warm lips against his, but Dean couldn’t help parting his lips when he felt the alpha’s tongue slide against his, seeking entrance. Dean turned his body, so he could deepen the kiss until his belly got in the way, which caused them both to fall into a fit of laughter. “The boys are coming between us already,” Dean joked.
“You’re having three boys,” Gabriel said. “It looks like they may even be identical, but we can’t be sure until we test them after they are born.”
The boys squealed with delight when they saw the park, which was one of their favorite places. They plopped all three into the special infant swings and the three men pushed the babies as they got to enjoy some fresh air.
“Place your hands behind your back, pretty boy,” Castiel directed as he began to open his belt and unzip his jeans. “Now I promised to keep you well-fed. I’m going to give you a little appetizer to tide you over until dinner. Open that pretty mouth.”
Dean dearly wished he could speak up and give his father-in-law a taste of his own medicine, but he wasn’t going to jeopardize today for anything.
“C’mon Dean, give up peacefully. No need to give them an excuse to hurt you any more than we already have,” Castiel said with a sigh of deep disappointment.
Pulling away from Castiel for a moment, Dean looked up, placed a hand on his heart and said, “Thanks, Jack. I owe you one.”
,” Gabriel said as he pointed to the blobs. “Dean’s pregnant with triplets. Congratulations! You’re having a whole litter!”
“Unfortunately, no. You may have noticed I didn’t pack anything. I keep this place stocked with non-perishable food and a few changes of clothes. But I don’t have my passport or a lot of cash. We’ll need that if we want to head to Canada. You’ll need a passport as well.”
Grateful for the distraction, Dean did his best to comply. Castiel slid out and back in slowly, and Dean focused on squeezing his muscles when he felt Castiel’s balls against his perineum. Castiel began to thrust into Dean again and again, speeding up only slightly. He let out a filthy groan every time Dean squeezed around him.
Dean smiled as he stuffed another piece of pancake into his mouth and washed it down with some coffee. “How long are they going to let us stay here?”
Giving a shrug, he nodded. “I mean, we finally have free will, right? It’s made me think about what I really want to do with the rest of my life. I never wanted to be a hunter, neither did Sam. Mom didn’t want this life for us. There are plenty of other hunters out there. So, yeah.”
“Dean’s in his second trimester and while he is getting adequate nutrition and exercise, I must insist that he also gets some fresh air on occasion,” Gabriel said. “The pups are currently healthy, but we want them to stay that way. I’d like to prescribe that Dean gets a solid hour of walking the grounds three times per week. I’ll escort him myself.”
Caressing the side of Dean’s face, Castiel smiled at him again. “Of course, I would mate the omega parent of my children.” Leaning over, Castiel gave Dean a tender kiss that made his head spin and his heart do backflips. “Do you think your brother would approve of me when he finds out I made you my mate?”
“Yeah, he’ll finally get to see what life is like for an omega,” Dean said. “Actually, being a castrated omega has got to be even worse. I mean he’s literally just going to be a hole to use for them, isn’t he?”
Castiel began to pepper Dean’s ass with gentle spanks, making Dean’s skin sting and tingle. As the blood in Dean’s body rushed to his lower extremities, Dean realized that his hole also ached and leak slick. He didn’t want to like this, but his body had other ideas.
“Hey, no! I want to know too. Dean’s my brother. I heard all the speeches about omega rights from you just as Dean did. Whatever it is, I have the right to know too,” Sam insisted.
Dean’s heart lept. If Chuck had been able to pull Lucifer out of the Empty, surely Jack should be able to do the same thing for Cas, right?
“It was a bit rough in the beginning. He was taking a lot of pointers from his dad. When that wouldn’t work…well he literally ran away. Took me with him. We spent two weeks finally getting to know each other without all of the damned surveillance he has going on at the estate. It’s everywhere Sammy. Even the damned bedrooms!”
“Good,” Dean said as he leaned against Castiel. “Just having you near me calms my nerves. You’re just lucky you managed to get me to fall in love with you before you knocked me up.”
The alpha growled when he scented Dean’s arousal and landed harder smacks. “I knew you would be the perfect omega for me,” Castiel said. “You’re such a good boy for getting turned on and ready for me to fuck, just from being spanked.”
“Are you ready for tomorrow, Dean?” Castiel asked as he held Bobby while Dean nursed the twins. They had given the nanny a night off, as she’d likely be taking care of the boys a lot more during the next few days while Dean and Castiel were called to testify.
Soon Dean was pulling on those jeans along with a pair of boots he’d also found, before slipping the t-shirt on. Castiel whistled as Dean stood up. “Your ass fills those jeans out in all the right ways. Whoever decided omegas should always be naked has absolutely no imagination.”
Dean’s face flushed hot, embarrassed to have been found out, yet unable to stop himself from dragging his cock against Castiel’s still-clothed leg. The mix of pain and pleasure melted together into a transcended experience, and Dean hadn’t even been fucked by that glorious dick yet.
That weekend they made the drive with Dean in a particularly good mood. As they pulled up and parked, Dean was beside himself. Between the excitement of all the pie he was planning to eat, and finally sharing the news with Sam, Dean was a fidgety mess.
Dean remained dumbfounded as the alpha drove them away from the estate. The alpha seemed to be keeping to the back roads and avoiding major thoroughfares. After over two hours of driving, Dean felt the lack of whatever he was being fed through the IV as his stomach grumbled.
“Yes, the congressman alerted authorities to the meeting and agreed to be wired,” Castiel said. “We caught a very lucky break there.”
His hips twitched while Castiel kept sucking him. Dean was close, but not close enough. Letting out a whine of desperation, Castiel slid two fingers into Dean’s well-used hole, rubbing his prostate again. That did it. Dean saw stars as his dick pulsed a load of seed into Castiel’s mouth, the man swallowing every drop.
“Thanks, Bro,” Gabriel said. “I managed to squirrel away quite a bit without Dad suspecting so I should be able to find a place of my own soon.”
Dean wrapped his arms around Castiel’s neck while tears of joy and relief streamed down his face. Without even thinking he kissed Castiel soundly and the alpha kissed him back for a quick moment before breaking the kiss.
Castiel knelt between Dean’s legs, while the omega spread them willingly, exposing his already leaking hole. Dean felt as the alpha teased a finger into him, making him moan as it slid in easily, his body willingly taking even that little bit of penetration.
Dean relaxed at the news. “Why is the old man being so nice to me? Besides keeping me chained up and naked. I was expecting to wake up and get my ass beat from here to kingdom come.”
Castiel was nude and crawled over to Dean. “Are you ready, omega? I’ll make you feel really good, I promise. If you need me to stop, just tell me. I promise I’ll stop.”
They kissed, and fucked, and made love all night long and loved each other through the rest of eternity.
Castiel sped up his thrusts then, plunging the knot in and out of Dean’s hole until it was fully formed and caught inside. Dean felt himself clamping down onto the knot as Castiel grunted his own release as he flooded Dean with his seed.
The sheriff pulled up to the border patrol and rolled down his window. “Howdy, I believe I have a couple of people you folks are looking for. They are here seeking asylum.”
The alpha’s hands ran over Dean’s belly. “I got your test results back before you went up for auction. They showed that you are a carrier. In fact, it’s possible I already knocked you up, but you’re less likely to be impregnated outside of your heats.”
“Here’s what we both know is true,” Castiel said, running his hand through Dean’s hair. “We know we love each other. We know we’ll always be there for each other. I think it’s fair to say we’re each other’s best friend.”
An orderly appeared in Dean’s line of sight and strapped on an oxygen mask over Dean’s nose and gagged mouth. The mask looked like it was specially designed to fit over the gag Dean had.
“That sounds like a great idea, son. Just be home in time for dinner. I have an announcement to make tonight.”
“Of course not. It’s your car and will remain your property,” Castiel clarified, holding out his hand. “I am merely restricting your use of it. If we ever come to a point where this arrangement needs to end, I will permanently relinquish the keys to you.”
Dean was so distracted with his armful of items; he nearly didn’t see the man standing by the war table until Miracle barked happily at the figure. As he reached the bottom of the stairs, Dean looked up, saw that familiar head of dark, tousled hair, and that damned trench coat, and dropped everything he was carrying.
“I was an angel,” Castiel explained. “As much as I loved you, as far as I had fallen, I could still not be with you. Not the way I’d wanted to be.”
“Hang on there, boys, I’m taking them in personally,” someone was shouting and running towards them.
Castiel’s voice sounded rough from sleep and worry and it pulled Dean further into consciousness. The omega cracked open an eye and looked around until it settled on Castiel who was lying next to him.
“Yet, now you’re begging not to be separated from him?” the judge asked. “Why would you want to be with someone who abused you?”
Then the auctioneer banged his gavel and shouted the first intelligible thing Dean had heard since stepping on the auction block. “Sold! For four million to private bidder number thirty-two!”
Dean crawled back on the bed and Castiel grabbed a bottle of water from his nightstand. “Here, drink some water first.”
Gabriel helped Dean to bare his chest and place the two pups he was holding onto each breast. They quickly latched on and began suckling. The sensation was very soothing and Dean immediately began to feel the bond form between him and the pups.
“What the hell!?” Dean shouted, almost sitting up before Castiel pushed him back down and lifting his hips back up.
All Dean could do was lie there and take it, letting Castiel take his pleasure. It was too much and not enough all at once. Their eyes locked as Castiel kept pounding his ass, claiming it, making it his. No one and nothing could ever compare to this.
heyo again, little chapter thingy here: At the beginning of this chapter, there are mentions of recreational marijuana usage. That's it, though! Have fun!
He ended up telling Charlie the entire story of Albert’s attempt at freedom, and that turned into telling her about Marcy, and how Petunia batted things off tables and stands—which is why Cas kept his little trinkets on the mantle instead—and Cleo was a cuddlebug at night, and how Cas either snored in his sleep or mumbled bits of what he’d read earlier that day—
The look Castiel was giving him was one of near-reverence. Dean felt heat rising along his collar. “What?” he mumbled, shuffling through the papers.
Castiel had one hand busy scratching Petunia behind the ears, the other laying loose on the papers in his lap. He was looking expectantly at Dean, waiting for the reply to a question Dean hadn’t heard.
Dean chuckled. “Yeah, she did the same thing to me at the beginning of my first year. Sat me right down and rattled off  'round fifty different things about teaching."
They ended up watching the last episode of season six before heading to bed. It wasn’t that late by any means, but Dean was still catching up on lost sleep and, at Castiel’s insistence, shuffled off to the guest room just after ten thirty with a “night, Cas,” and a fresh hot water bottle.
Charlie and Gilda met them at one of the food trucks around one in the afternoon, wearing matching Hogwarts sweaters (Charlie’s had “Seeker” on it, Gilda’s a rather large Golden Snitch) and sharing a funnel cake.
“Great,” Castiel sighed. “Well, our grading session might be interrupted by my niece being caught committing a crime, then.”
Dean grinned. “So? Wanna get drinks with the crew after? Jo’s a good deal nicer after a few rounds.”
“C’mon, c’mon—yes!” The engine rumbled to life. “Atta girl,” Dean said proudly, patting the dashboard and cranking the heat, the Legos rattling nostalgically in the heat vents. “That’s it. Okay, let’s go.”
, of storms when he was one of Heaven’s soldiers; he found the weather more irritating than lovely. There was nothing to do on rainy days except sit and wallow in your emotions.
She squeezed him tight once round the middle before releasing him and saying excitedly to everyone, “Wanna go to the park? They’ve got
Dean didn’t remember much after shuffling sleepily to Cas’s bedroom and peeling off his t-shirt and pajama pants, gravitating towards Cas under the covers until their arms wound loosely around each other.
“What, you ain’t impressed?” Dean asked, feeling the small, flickering curl of anticipation in his gut. The small mudroom was already cramped as it was, and the foot-and-a-half of space between him and Castiel made it feel like a shrunken sardine can.
For example, the golden-colored feathers streaked with a rich maroon that one of the chickens, named Meg, had on her neck.
The air was biting when he stepped outside, his eyes watering almost immediately. His hands shook getting the keys in the ignition, a panicked thought going through his head at the freeze affecting his Baby.
“Yeah, you’re a damn heavy sleeper,” Dean said, and Castiel gave a small, tired smile. “Would you rather she call or not?” he asked.
ago that, at some point, he would have a seven foot snake in his lap while sitting beside the man he was in love with—who happened to be a nerdy, awkward science teacher with a penchant for inappropriate science jokes and coffee mugs—he would’ve broken a rib laughing. Before drowning himself in cheap whiskey.
It wasn’t until the next insistent rumble of his stomach that Dean final righted himself. “Sorry man, I just…the fact we could just be here together and knowing your dad’s not watching us anymore. It just hit me. I didn’t realize how much I had been holding in.”
“You can clearly see that Dean is an intelligent, articulate human being,” Castiel praised. “I am very proud to be his mate, and I am so very sorry for how I initially treated him. Thank you all for listening. We will now take a few questions.”
“Hey Castiel, I was thinking of maybe joining you guys today? I’ve been thinking of getting my mate some piercing as well,” Michael greeted.
“These programmable chain links are a little more reusable,” Gabriel said with a wink. “This way I can easily re-chain you later.”
“Yeah, I miss you too. I dunno when I’ll be able to see you again, but I just needed to hear from mom and dad about what really happened. Man, that explains a lot.”
Dean waddled as best as he could back up the stairs. Castiel insisted they both brush their teeth and prepare for bed first, so Dean wouldn’t have to get up again later. Then Castiel guided Dean back to the bed where he’d woken up in earlier.
Nodding his head, Dean acknowledged that. “Yeah, after I presented, dad really freaked out when I went out one time. Nothing happened, but I get it. I see it all the time on the news when an omega gets caught by one of those alpha gangs.”
As Dean finally came back to himself, he realized that Castiel hadn’t knotted him yet and he just kept thrusting, even when Dean was well past the point of sensitivity. “Cas, Cas, stop a moment, please.”
Dean pulled Castiel into another kiss, plundering the alpha’s mouth, he pushed Castiel down and dominated the alpha. Castiel laid back easily, letting Dean have his way with him.
Castiel’s father seemed to crumble at the pronouncement and his sons grabbed him and helped to hold him up before the judge continued.
“That’s why I had you suck me off earlier,” Castiel said with a smirk. “I also took something to help.”
Dean snuggled himself into Castiel’s arms as best as he could, enjoying the feeling of being held again. “So how exactly did you and Gabriel stay in touch?” Dean wondered.
“I missed you too, so much,” Castiel replied as he angled his head down and pulled Dean in for a kiss.
“Yes, I was,” Dean replied. “A few times he even ordered Castiel to take the belt to my ass right in front of him.”
Due to the protests, the new Alpha Rights Bill had stalled much like its predecessor, the Anti-Omega Rights Bill. Also, there seemed to be a movement of omegas publicly accusing alphas of abuse. It seemed that there was a groundswell of support for more omega rights and freedom now than ever before. Dean hoped that perhaps in some small way, he and Cas had something to do with that.
The demon disappeared from view again, before grabbing Castiel’s ass cheek. He pushed the hard plastic of the syringe into Castiel’s ass, making the angel flinch. The cool lubricant filling him was a strange sensation, but not unpleasant. Dean reemerged into his field of view a moment later, leering at his naked form. “If I had known you were hiding all that under that frumpy trench coat all these years, I might have jumped you a lot sooner.”
Dean sat back and studied Castiel for a moment. “Why exactly are you so gung-ho on helping me now? I mean, I know you said we were under constant surveillance back at the estate, but why didn’t you just bring me out here sooner? Why spend all that time trying to torture me into submission?”
Dean’s mind started swirling with the possibilities of what he’d like in a house, especially when money wouldn’t be an object. Castiel had already met with a realtor and they suggested the Novak estate could easily sell for at least five million, perhaps more. The acreage alone was worth at least a million, based on the location of the property. Castiel had plenty of money, but the income from selling the estate would be used to build their new home.
“I just got off the phone with Gabriel. He said to stay put until my black eye is completely healed. How bad is it, do you think?” Castiel asked.
“You took that very well, pretty boy,” Castiel praised, releasing him from his grip. “Are you going to be good and take your fucking like a good boy?”
“You’re really good at this, Dean. If I had known before, that coercion was the wrong tactic to use…I cannot apologize enough,” Castiel said after Dean went through all the various forms again. They’d been at this for a week now and Dean felt confident he could easily fool his father-in-law now.
After that, words failed them as Castiel slowly and gently slid his cock in and out of Dean’s channel. Dean lost himself in the ecstasy of pleasure that Castiel was giving him as his arousal grew and built. The feel of Castiel along his back, his hands caressing him, his mouth kissing and licking wherever he could reach, the wonderful feeling of being filled with his rock-hard cock over and over, slowly drove Dean to the edge. After so many months of denying his body it’s baser desires, Dean reached that edge and fell over it fast, screaming Castiel’s name as his orgasm washed over him in wave after wave of pleasure.
“How soon can you begin the process of breaking him?” Dean heard his father-in-law ask. “I’m sure you’ve seen the news, so you know he’ll be a difficult omega to bring into line, but if you can tame him, it will prove that all omegas are tamable.”
Then Castiel began their speech. “Welcome. My name is Castiel Novak. I am the youngest son of the Founder and CEO of Novak Industries. I am here with my mate, Dean Novak, to address why we fled to Canada from the United States, and why we needed to seek asylum here. Please, hold all of your questions until we have said our piece.”
Castiel nodded. “You saw what life was like in those omega foster homes when we went to visit them. We can give them all a better life.”
Castiel explains why it had taken so long to rescue Dean, and then the pair have a much needed romantic reunion.
Clearly Dean wasn’t the first omega to protest their claiming. Dean noted the thick leather restraints on the ceremonial claiming altar he was being dragged towards. Dean snarled, kicked and screamed as best he could under the circumstances. They may be able to force this on him, but he wasn’t going to go easily or willingly.
Turning to face Dean, Castiel reached out to stroke his now age-worn face. “You’ll always be my pretty boy, Dean.”
“This will probably be the last choice you’ll ever be given,” the new man said. “Do you want to be sedated before or after you’re chipped and tattooed?”
“She’s been dropping hints, about leaving the hunter life,” Sam said with a shrug, picking up a slice of pie.
Once Dean was dressed, the alpha took him by the hand and led him out of the room. Dean’s legs were still weakened from lying in bed so long, so he stumbled, barely able to keep up. That’s when the alpha grabbed him and just threw him over his shoulder.
Castiel began spanking Dean’s ass with efficient precision, smacking hard and fast. What began as a mildly painful sting quickly built up as the heat rose in his cheeks…both sets of cheeks because for some reason Dean’s cock had decided it was enjoying this form of torture and was valiantly trying to harden inside it’s cage.
This was new. Somehow, he’d never imagined that they’d kiss. This was all some sadistic sex game, right? Kissing was more intimate. Yet, Dean soon lost himself in the moment as Castiel’s lips pressed against his, while his tongue plundered his mouth. The added level of intimacy stirred something deep inside of him he struggled to comprehend. All Dean knew was that suddenly his arms ached to wrap around Castiel and pull him closer, making him struggle against the grip the man had on his wrists.
Dean rubbed his hands over his face and through his hair while he thought about everything they’d just talked about and learned from each other. He looked over at the alpha and really studied him. Besides the nasty black eye, the man wasn’t bad looking. To be honest, before all this mating business happened, Dean would have thought he was kind of hot. He also had a look of abject misery and desperation on his face and for a second Dean almost felt sorry for him. Almost.
“Yes, it’s my understanding that a castrated omega experiences almost no pleasure after castration,” Castiel said. “Although, castrating him first, while he’s still an alpha is even worse. Our cocks are almost like a status symbol and to have it removed is almost as bad as being turned.”
When Dean reached out and stroked Castiel’s cock, the demon whistled. “Nice package you got there, angel. Too bad you’ll ever get to use it.” Before Castiel could even whine in protest, Dean grabbed something from the table. “I’m going to keep this bad boy caged up, nice and tight.”
Castiel started slowly but soon increased the speed of his thrusts, snapping his hips hard, driving his cock deep. Dean let his eyes close as he gripped the blanket beneath him tight, holding on for the ride. Castiel’s hand slid deliciously over his cock, in perfect sync with his hips. It drove Dean to the edge, fast. The heat of pleasure coiling low in his belly as his balls began to draw up.
“Yeah, they kept me chained up in Castiel’s old room,” Dean explained. “At least I was treated well, despite being a prisoner. I’m just lucky Castiel was able to get me out of there before the pups were born.” Dean went on to explain what his fate would have been if his father-in-law had his way.
, hear me out. I couldn’t suggest this before because my father has the entire estate under surveillance. He can literally hear and see anything that goes on there.”
John thought about it for several long minutes. It was a lot to take in. Meeting God. Being told that Dean is bisexual and in love with a
That meant whoever had just bought Dean wasn’t even here. They’d bid on him remotely, and who knows where they lived. Dean had hoped to stay close to his family so he could maybe visit Sammy, but now those hopes were dashed.
Dean found himself held down and passionately kissed, again. Then Castiel sat back and smiled at him. “Yes. You are my beloved. Forever and always.”
The defense attorney raised his hands in a defensive gesture. “I’m sorry your honor,” he replied. “I’m just trying to determine why Castiel is the only Novak alpha not currently facing prosecution. If everything my clients have done was so terrible, shouldn’t Castiel also be on trial? How is it that he has been so easily forgiven?”
“Do you still want to stop by your parent’s house?” Castiel asked. “We shouldn’t spend too much time before we start heading north.”
Castiel looked disappointed but he nodded, soaping and rinsing his genitalia by himself. Castiel then leaned closer for a moment. “Dean, please. I won’t touch you, but I really need to cum. Can you please turn around and let me cum on your ass? I won’t touch. I won’t penetrate. I’ll even wash it all off afterwards. Please?”
“You’re already so wet for me,” Castiel purred as he scooped up some of the slick with his fingers and coated his length with it. “Are you ready for me?”
Dean looked directly at Castiel as he fitted the collar around his neck. “I love you, Castiel. Now, we can be together forever.”
“It’s a long story,” Castiel said with a sigh. “I have been trying to get you back since the moment they took you from me. I swear I never once stopped trying. Dad’s political connections just made it…complicated.”
Then the voltage was increased even further and Dean’s mind and body couldn’t take it anymore and he slipped into unconsciousness.
“Go back up to the bedroom and kneel by the foot of the bed for me,” Castiel instructed as he slid the keys into his pocket and began to clear the dishes. “I’ll clean the kitchen and join you shortly.”
“They were going to have you sent to an omega training facility, Sam would be rehomed and raised by an alpha parent, and they would burn our house down while we slept, possibly killing us both. They knew everything about us. Where we lived, where Sam went to school, everything.”
The first omega schools opened a year after the amendment was ratified and Dean encouraged each of his brothers-in-law to enroll. “Trust me, knowing how to read is really going to open up your world. This will give you a chance to be independent.”
The bond formed, but only partially. Dean could feel that it wasn’t complete and a part of him rejoiced. Yes, the alpha may have claimed Dean’s body, but he had not claimed his heart. Nor would he ever, if Dean had anything to say about it.
Then Dean heard the man flipping through some papers. “Oh, I see. You’re an untrained omega. That explains it. Well, in that case, let me explain what’s about to happen. Because your new alpha bid on you remotely, we need to process you for him. This includes doing a full inspection that he will view on a live video stream. If he’s satisfied with his purchase, you will be micro-chipped and tattooed with a barcode to indicate ownership. Finally, you will be sedated and shipped to your new alpha.”
“You’re… going to make me your mate?” Dean asked in awe, looking up at the handsome alpha. Dean knew he’d be claimed and fucked but didn’t expect Castiel to mate him.
Before getting dressed, Dean decided he needed a shower first after getting a whiff of himself. Neither of them had showered since that last morning at the estate, which must have been almost thirty-six hours ago now.
“Through the Internet Cloud, believe it or not,” Castiel said. “Gabriel would take extensive notes regarding your condition. It all looked like standard medical jargon, but he and I had developed a code with each other years ago, so he was able to hide specific details within his notes. I had his login and password, so I could make edits to the notes, which is how I conveyed my information back to him. If Dad ever bothered to check on any of it, which he probably did, it would just look like Gabriel was posting and editing the medical notes he kept.”
Taking Castiel’s hand into his again, Dean looked into the man’s still impossibly blue eyes. “I think I’m going to enjoy getting to know you all over again,” Dean said, waggling his eyebrows at Cas. “You know, I think Sam is going to probably spend the night at Eileen’s, so…”
“Hush.” A ball gag was shoved into his mouth. “Omegas only speak when they’re spoken to. Didn’t your previous alpha teach you anything?”
Dean handed Bobby to Castiel and pulled Gabriel in for a big bear hug. “Thanks man. Thank you so much!”
Leading him to the other door, there was a well-appointed master bath with a tub and shower, two sinks, and a toilet. “You’re welcome to use this shower to freshen up after I show you the rest of the house.”
As Dean slowly slipped back into consciousness, he groaned as the memories of what happened flooded to the surface. He was afraid to even open his eyes until he realized he was smelling a very familiar scent. He smelled Cas. The smell permeated the room he was in, and his eyes flew open, thinking that it all had been a horrible nightmare.
Dean paced angrily in the small room he found himself confined in. He still couldn’t believe his parents were selling him out like this. He thought they were more progressive and would have pushed back on putting Dean on the omega registry when he turned eighteen, regardless of the law.
Being praised like that made Dean feel all warm and gooey inside. It made him want to keep being a good boy for his alpha. “I think your father’s fears regarding your behavior were unfounded. You have been nothing but well-behaved for me so far,” Castiel said, running his fingers through Dean’s hair. “Right now, I want you to speak freely, so we can discuss some things. You need to understand the rules of my home, and I will answer as many questions as I can.”
As Dean took a deep breath, he smelled Castiel’s scent even more strongly, and that stabbed at Dean’s heart. He had finally fallen in love with his mate, only to be cruelly torn from his side. Then he remembered the last thing the doctor had said…he was pregnant.
day-after-day, there was no way he could easily forgive him. But Dean decided to trust him. Having Castiel’s help to get across the border would make the entire process easier. Omegas caught without their alpha or beta guardian were immediately arrested and there was no way to disguise himself. His scent always gave him away.
The pups were just shy of their second birthdays when they finally were able to move into their new house. They threw the boys a lavish party, attended by all their cousins. John, Mary and Sam also were invited, and the party served as both a housewarming party, in addition to a birthday party.
Dean’s stomach grumbled and the smell of the food made his mouth water, but he was determined. So, he stood there watching the alpha eat his meal. When he was done he stood with a glass of water. “I can’t let you dehydrate yourself, so at least drink some water for me.”
He looked up, confused, at the soft tapping on his door, before his eyes alighted on Dean. He closed the binder in his lap, setting it to the side and quickly standing up.
Thursday passed almost too slowly, the excited buzz of Halloween simmering in the air. Friday felt twice as long as it should have, the anticipation almost tangible. Decorations had been up all week—fake cobwebs stretched across the tops of doorways paper skeletons taped to the walls and purple and orange streamers dangling from the cafeteria ceiling. Charlie wore her Gryffindor robes, complete with a replica of Hermione’s wand tucked behind her ear. Donna had donned a shimmering witch’s hat and convinced a reluctant Jody into wearing one, too.
Needless to say, he and Cas had mutually agreed to keep their personal relationship away from their work relationship.
It was one of the most difficult things Dean had done to date, and he’d had to explain institutionalized racism to Kansas rednecks.
The chicken flocked to the door when Castiel knelt down to unlatch it, gently pushing the chickens back to reach the feed dish. He spoke softly to them, gently reprimanding their attempts to peck at his fingers while sprinkling seeds on the ground around them.
That’s how Dean felt in that moment—the wall he’d built up torn down and a bridge built instead, where he’d crossed to find Castiel waiting patiently on the other side.
“So,” Dean said, after setting Krissy Chamber’s file on the growing stack beside him. “Tell me about yourself, Cas.”
“Oh, um.” Castiel looked around at the mess on the floor. “Fine, I think. Although I may have brought too many books,” he frowned at the cardboard boxes off to the side.
“You fuckin’ fibber,” Dean mumbled around a mouthful of warm chocolate pecan pie. “This is a good ass pie crust!”
“Hey, Cleo,” Dean rasped, leaning over to scratch behind the cat’s ears. Cleo purred, turning so Dean could scratch under her chin.
They fall asleep there, together, watching the rain fall and listening to thunder fade slowly into the distance. Castiel’s content; Dean’s body is warm and familiar beneath his hand, his stomach slowing rising and falling as Castiel melts into him.
The rest of the afternoon, Dean shuffled around his slowly-but-surely turning-into-an-icebox house, determinately ignoring his cell and reheating soup and cider. There was a sinking, guilt-made depression in his ribcage no amount of French lentil and toast were filling. His hands felt permanently chilled around whatever heated beverage he was holding, to the point where he had nearly burned himself to gain a bit of feeling in them.
He stared at his phone, biting his lip, before shutting it off and tossing it onto the couch cushion.
Dean took a deep inhale, wrapping his fingers around the handle—his mug was patterned with Shakespearean insults. He sipped tentatively at the edge.
Standing in his doorway and keeping an eye on both classes, he fired off three more texts before ringing the front office.
Dean nodded. “Answer questions, hand out the syllabus, that sorta thing,” he answered. resisting the urge to brush aside the stray cowlick curving away from Cas’s forehead.
“So, what is your consensus on snakes, now that you’ve got first-hand experience?” Castiel asked while they rummaged through the wood shavings.
Dean turned his pie crust with his palms, shaping the edges into a more uniform circle. They’d decided to double the recipe and make
like him—the latest he’d ever gotten to school was seven fifty, and even then he’d texted Dean and said he was running late.
The power had gone out before during snowstorms, but never when it was this bone-chilling. The day after school had restarted for the second semester, a mini-blizzard had struck down on Lebanon, cancelling the rest of the week and trapping the town’s residents indoors until the roads defrosted. Usually when things like this happened, Dean would drive to Sam and Jess’s to wait it out, but their block, too, had gone out and they were off at Jess’s parents. Everyone else Dean knew was stuck at home, too, trapped in the same situation.
“How many are left?” he mumbled, half-asleep on the couch. They had switched to coffee by seven-thirty, barely awake. The hour hand had just creeped past eight o’clock, but it felt like much later.
He waited anxiously, glancing at the dark screen, unsure if he wanted the next notification to be from Sam or Cas.
Castiel’s coffee table, chair, and half the couch were drowning in paper. Dean whistled when he stepped through the door at five-thirty, taking in the rather ridiculous picture of what looked like the entire faculty stash of printer paper taking over Castiel’s
Charlie laughed, tipping back her own beer. “Don’t worry, I still love you. Did you cry at the end?”
Castiel sipped his coffee. “I won’t be able to keep an eye on her, due to her usual temporary-housing tub being unavailable at the moment.”
Everyone laughed, and Castiel felt himself grinning alongside them. “You also taught middle school?” he asked, trying the craft brew handed to him.
Cas pulled a strip of cling wrap from the roll and laid it over the dough disc. “Yes. Mistakes are inevitable with anything, and one failed attempt should not lead to complete capitulation if the failure is due to an issue that can be resolved in future endeavors.”
Dean stabbed his pasta noodles. He and Sam were having their usual Friday-night dinners, generally followed by a quarter of an hour of bickering over a movie before selecting one they’d either both hate or enjoy way too much. Jess worked at the hospital and Sam couldn’t cook to save his life, so he spent the evening at Dean’s place to mooch off his brother’s much better food.
