Still, though. Tony had been pretty much silent ever since, his gaze unfocused, mind somewhere else. Steve was worried.
“Are you with Tony?” Someone- a girl, it seemed like- asked him. Her voice sounded annoyed and somewhat familiar, and Steve frowned in confusion.
“It’s boring,” he declared, “try something else, Steve, anything. If you order that carbonara again you’re going to break my heart.”
- fucking hell, he was stuck in a loop and not getting anywhere, so much for keeping Tony out of his head for more than five fucking minutes.
“SHIELD has a virus, and it’s spread throughout every limb of the organisation,” Tony sounded truly angry now, his face pulled together so tight that he’d reopened the cut on his forehead; fresh beads of blood forming along the gash. “I started out just trying to get back my weapons, but it’s so much more than that now. It’s about global safety; about stepping up and fighting a system that’s become infested with fucking evil, because
It was the wrong thing to say. Tony knew that as soon as it came out of his mouth, and he blinked, tried to mentally take them back out of the room, but it was no use. Steve was staring at him like he’d just punched him in the face. The room was oppressively silent for a moment as they looked at one another, Tony with horror, Steve with betrayal.
For a second, he watched Tony look a little like a rabbit caught in the headlights- and it was only because he was searching after it that he saw the short looks he and Bruce exchanged, which held an entire conversation Steve wasn’t privy to.
Tony nodded, and ripped open the envelope. Inside, there were three strips of paper, with hand-written sentences in the middle of them. He furrowed his brow curiously as he removed them, reading them quickly.
Tony didn’t even bother looking at them- just grinned cheekily and then nodded. “It would be my pleasure,” he muttered, before lunging forward, grabbing the back of Steve’s legs and lifting smoothly. Steve went with a yelp, hooking his legs around Tony’s waist as the other boy leaned up and slotted their mouths together messily. There was a sharp thud as his back hit the door, and he tried to hold back a manic grin as he wound his hands around Tony’s neck and kissed back with enthusiasm.
“What did I tell you, you’re a terrible liar. You don’t have a plan at all do you? You’re just walking me out in this SHIELD corridor in broad daylight, hoping no one is going to question you, aren’t you?”
Tony pouted, but only for a moment, before he too got caught up in the film and turned to watch just as avidly as Pepper (He might have been a dick, but Clooney was still eye candy, alright?)
Steve drove his knee upward, catching Ty in the balls. He dropped like a fly and yelled in pain, and Steve already knew he’d won. His sharp elbow drove down into Ty’s back hard, and the boy tumbled to the floor. After that, it was just free-for-all. Steve wound his leg back and rammed it into Stone’s stomach, then decided that wasn’t satisfying enough and dropped to his knees, catching Ty’s arm before it could hit him and sending another jab into Ty’s nose. He was going to ruin that boy’s face forever, he was going to fucking kill him dead. Someone like that didn’t deserve to live, not when they could so easily do that to another human, one they were supposed to fucking care about—
It was a very particular sort of pain when you watched your best friend fall apart at the seams. It wasn’t like the pain of your own experiences: that sat high on your chest, a sharp and poignant cut that burned and stung. The pain shared between friends was a debilitating ache, however; right down in your soul, crushing your guts, your stomach. You wanted to help. You couldn’t. You couldn’t do a fucking thing.
“I know bud,” Bruce was patting his hair softly, “I know, and he’s looking for you as we speak, I promise. He can’t have gotten far. Him and Thor and Clint are on their way, and then we’ll get you to a hospital and it’ll all be fine.”
at me?” Steve uttered, eyes averting to the other side of the room as he wiped hastily over his face. He was exhausted. So, so exhausted, and so many people had died and it was his fault, he’d let himself get used by HYDRA and they’d taken over him
fault. I didn’t know how to cope with it, how to make you better, so I did the only thing I was good at and ran away. You pushed me, but I let myself get pushed. I wasn’t there for you. Then when I found out about Obadiah and Stark Industries, and I just… I focused more on work than I did on
angry, but he couldn’t remember what the reason for it was. He had just been furious. Moreso than he’d ever been before, which was saying something. It hurt to think too hard, but he was sure it was-
He stepped back. “Come on. I think the team’s watching a movie, but we can threaten diaper-duty on anyone who argues with us putting Peppa Pig on.”
Steve paused, choking on a laugh at the thought of Tony trying to surreptitiously slide a dozen cookies into his expensive leather jacket without being detected by the staff. “God, I love you, you big idiot,” he responded simply, which was a little off-topic, but what could he say, the feeling just struck him and he wanted Tony to know it, “I’ll be home soon.”
Tony’s lip curled. “Wow. No wonder Peter’s rejecting it,” he said, before adding, “but if you keep watch over my hot pocket so it doesn’t burn or get eaten by stray Avengers, I’ll take over dinner-time for you.”
Steve gasps, hands sinking lower and grabbing at the fabric of Tony’s shirt, pulling him in until he was pressed up against Steve’s chest- and Tony thinks for a moment that he might just be enough.
“Great, thank you!” Steve said cheerfully, waving as he bounced down the corridor. The smile was still sticking to his face- months and months of practice keeping it fixed there through sheer muscle memory alone. Always smiling, that was Steve. Always happy, positive. All his friends knew that.
“And then satisfaction brings it back,” Steve snapped quickly, sitting up when his friends just seemed to grow more and more amused with every word, “Ugh, you are both the worst, I should have just left you behind, honestly-”
Tony turned around, walking backwards and grinning at Steve. “Where’s the fun in riding safely?” He pouted, but when Steve shot him an unimpressed glare, he just sighed dramatically. “Ugh, fine. Two helmets it is, then. Wait-“ he turned once more, looking Steve up and down, “do you have a jacket?”
But that was just their lives, he supposed. Certain Death to them meant very little. They were used to it.
“Then I’ll teach you,” Tony nodded to himself, hopping back over the desk and then walking up to Steve, “I just finished my routine anyway. I’ll teach you how to dance better than most pros will know with years worth of lessons.”
He still can’t say it. Romantic words are where he falls down- that’s what hurt Pepper before, and it will probably hurt Steve too, at some point.
need to hear that.” Clint jumped down from the fridge and then took Peter out of Tony’s arms, hoisting him up high and eliciting a cackle of delight from the small boy. Tony simply rolled his eyes and got started on making himself a coffee, watching Peter out of the corner of his vision with a smile on his face.
“Do you really think that anyone’s gonna be able to get into that thing? It’s encrypted to high heaven, Steve, chill the fuck out for a second and quit talking to me like I’m a fucking baby-”
Thor opened his mouth as if to argue, but something stopped him, and then he just nodded once. With a delicacy Steve hadn’t even known Thor to possess, the boy slipped out of Tony’s space and then helped him lie back down on the couch. Then he turned to Steve. “Thank you,” he breathed, and they felt like so much more than just two words when Thor looked at him like that.
Tony looked up at Steve, who was staring softly at him, brows drawn a little closer together than they had been before. “You’re never gonna have to be alone again, Tony. Not any more.”
Okay, and that was definitely confrontational talk; Steve reacted almost subconsciously to it, his back straightening and his eyes going quickly to the door. “What
Tony’s hand drifted into Steve’s hair and pushed it from his face, before curling around his jaw and resting there gently. Steve tilted his head and pressed a sleepy kiss into his palm, and then heard the way Tony sighed above him.
at least a little bit more fucking tasteful, but honestly, he was too far deep in shock to do anything but stare blankly and watch as Steve became more and more embarrassed.
Steve couldn’t stop smiling. He thought it was going to split his face in half. "Tony, I am so fucking proud of you, you know that right?" He asked, brushing absently through Tony's hair and then tucking the stray strands behind his ear. "Whether you get in or not, I just..."
It couldn’t have been more than a few hours later when Steve heard his bedroom door slamming open, and he scrambled upright in bed just in time to watch almost every single one of his friends march determinedly into his tiny room, most of them immediately getting comfortable on his single bed and turning a deaf ear on his yells of surprise.
He took a shallow breath and then winced as it sent fire through his chest. The wall he was currently sat against offered no comfort, either, and he couldn’t even call anyone to ask for help, because the bastards had his phone.
“That’s true,” Steve said as he passed by Tony to get to the toaster, squeezing the man’s butt as he went. Tony jumped and then laughed, much to the chagrin of the present team-members.
Steve is looking at him, and his face is so sad, Tony’s drunken thought-process immediately goes into help-mode, because it reminds him all too well of the other times Steve has looked like that. “Hey. ‘M sorry. Don’… I’m good. Don’t be sad.”
Pull on the tie, wrap it around, Windsor knot… wait, that was probably the wrong colour. Blue, not red- he was repping Stark Industries as opposed to Iron Man today, he needed the right colours. Which cufflinks? Was Steve breathing, or was he dead? The longer Tony left him, the worse his brain damage would be.
Steve shook his head and then pushed past Tony, his shoulder knocking heavily against his own as he did so. Tony stumbled, steadying himself against the counter and looking at the other man with wide eyes. “Steve?” He called out behind him in concern, but got no reply. Steve slammed his way out of the common room a second later, leaving Tony staring bewilderedly at the space he’d left. It had been a stupid argument, but Steve’s words had cut deep. Why had he... God, it was just a fucking
“Outside?” Bucky gestured to the door, and Tony looked even more suspicious at that, but Bucky just huffed in amusement, “thin walls, dude- how do you think I managed to pick my moment so gracefully? I’d rather people didn’t eavesdrop in on this, though.”
It wasn’t angry, as such- more confusion and mild annoyance, but Tony’s head sunk lower and Steve heard the cursing increase. “I should- I should go, wow, I’m so sorry Steve, I didn’t mean to, to cause a scene, I was just… oh God, I’m so fucking sorry-“
“I don’t fucking love him,” Tony growled, getting to his feet and turning to the Iron Man armour that was half-assembled at his side so he didn’t have to look at Steve’s expression. “I’m just—”
Tony just blinked at him, the weary smile slipping off his face. “What,” he asked, “Steve, what do you… what are you saying?”
“Sir keeps a duffle bag full of essentials in all his cars, and he had already prepacked a suitcase before he left. I assume it would contain at least enough to last him a week.”
He just needed to sleep on it. He’d decide on what to do in the morning. For now, he just. He was just tired. That was all. Tired and sore, and too fuzzy to make a decision.
Tony just nodded once, and Steve watched curiously as he swallowed and began tapping his fingers against the wheel nervously. He didn’t say anything, though.
“Anyway, like I was saying- I was at the stupid building and they were talking about this competition thing, for young artists? I was thinking you should-“
“I can’t,” Tony told him quickly, “I’m working. Anyway, it’s fine Steve. I know what I’m doing. I’ll probably be out by the time Howard gets back from work anyway.”
Tony broke off, looking behind him at Bruce, Thor and Natasha, all of whom were now glaring daggers at the pair of them from the other side of the room. “I saw your heart-rate spiking on my tablet and thought you were in trouble. We all came running to your aid,” Bruce told him, unimpressed, “turns out you just can’t keep it in your pants for more than five consecutive minutes.”
Steve shot him a scathing look, grabbing one of Sam’s napkins and chucking it in Tony’s direction. “Don’t remind me.”
“Put me down,” Steve told him, and with a small sigh of defeat, Tony did. He looked down at his expensive shoes and stepped back, readying to accept defeat.
Steve’s mouth opened, then shut again, lost. He was pale and his eyes haunted as he looked at Tony. “No,” he whispered with a shake of his head, and Tony fucking lost it. With a scream of frustration, he turned around and grabbed the mug, throwing it viciously into the wall, just wanting to hear something that wasn’t Steve’s subdued voice. This wasn’t how they argued, this wasn’t how they did
? About me being in a real, full-blown relationship with another guy, as opposed to just some drunken making out in the corner of a dark club?” Tony shrugged helplessly, eyes nervous. “I don’t know what he’d do.”
Steve nodded and squeezed his thigh again, and for the rest of the trip he made sure not to go over the limit. He was good at the little things like that.
Tony was hurt. Not just by the arm and the bruised face, but by Steve, and what he’d done. In fact, he figured that what he’d done had probably hurt more.
“No,” Steve said, palming a hand over his face before raising it, a sign of peace, “no, fuck, I’m sorry. I’m just… it’s been a long night. Stay.”
Tony paused, feeling the gazes of his team fall on him. Only then did he remember that he was now without the armour. But… he could still be an asset without it, surely. “I’m coming with you,” he said defensively, turning to the rest of the team.
There weren’t many skyscrapers along this skyline; the centre of Manhattan was tucked away to the corner like an unimportant detail. Instead, he was looking amongst smaller rooftops. There were trees and green things here, which he had never been able to see when he’d been up the empire state building. The sea was closer than he’d thought- a deep blue saphire spanning a thick line between horizon and land. And the
John was staring at him blankly, the pen moving in his hand and writing down perfectly straight lines despite the fact he was no longer looking at the sheet. Michael was still smiling. Tony resisted the urge to call the suit straight to him, just in case. He didn’t want to have to deal with a court case, not right now. These guys were weird, but that didn’t make them dangerous. Just… well, weird. Hardly a reason to repulsor blast them straight out of the building.
Steve, I shoved you under my bed and ordered to you stay there for three hours. I didn’t even… and I came back and there was blood all over my fucking room and you were gone and I was just-“
“Sometimes he’d come and stay at mine for a bit to avoid his dad after an argument—and sometime he stayed over after it got physical. But it’s never… it’s never been this bad before, no.” Thor’s hands tightened around the wheel. “He was never officially kicked out. And this is the worst I’ve seen him looking after a fight.”
Steve hurried to regain his footing, pushing off away from Tony’s arm as the other boy just looked at him, that goddamn half-smile still curling around his mouth, “I think I’m just accident prone,” he bit out irritably. Tony had probably been laughing at him inwardly the entire damn night- not that Steve could even blame him, he’d acted like a fucking idiot.
Instead of carrying on, he just grabbed the blanket on the side of the couch and placed it around the both of them, tucking his knees into his chest and leaning a little further on Steve. He was tired too- the whole day had been spent fighting, and more than anything, Tony just wanted to rest.
Something soft and loose curled around his shoulders, and Tony felt a hand press through the fabric and into his neck. It was careful and considerate; nothing like what he was used to in the caves. “Hey,” Steve said fondly, his voice even and normal, “just me.”
“It’s not your fault, Steve,” Tony murmured, fingers brushing over the indents of Steve’s chest, “I would’ve done the same. If it was Rhodey, I mean. He would have stood a way better chance at kicking their asses than you would’ve done against me with full intention of trying to hurt you. Because you would’ve trusted me. You would never have expected it. Rhodey is ready to throw down 24/7. And so is Bucky. You know that.” He leaned up, kissing Steve slowly, “Bucky’s just glad you’re safe. Promise.”
After a second, unfortunately Tony seemed to snap out of it, shaking his head and looking down. “Uh-“ he muttered, reaching for an antiseptic wipe, “just gonna- and then- yeah-“
He moved forward again, but as he did so, several other people rounded the corner behind Tony and set their eyes on him. They were laughing together, loud and abrasive, and Steve recognized them as the people Tony tended to hang out with. It was confirmed when Tony shot Steve one last look and then turned, big fake smile spreading out on his face as he greeted them all.
Steve had won. He looked inside, pulling out the hat and placing it delicately on his golden-blond hair before pulling out the piece of paper from within. With a fond grin, he read the question out loud. “Thoughts on dating Tony Stark?”
And then Howard Stark would have put the phone down, and he would have gotten in the car to go home and have it out with him. Maybe the bastard had been on his way back while Steve had been on the phone with Tony. Maybe he’d driven past Steve’s street on his way to beat his own son bloody.
“Sorry,” Steve muttered again, feeling his cheeks go red, “I’ll go fetch some new sheets in the morning-“
But whoever it was didn’t really matter. What mattered was that they’d done enough digging into his past to find someone who’d apparently kept some rather incriminating footage without Tony realising, and by 1 in the afternoon it was all over the fucking internet.
“You’re making this sound way worse than it is,” Steve argued weakly, knowing full well that he was blushing like an idiot now.
If someone had done to him what that asshole had done to Tony… Jesus, he wasn’t sure how he would have reacted. Something that would probably result in a visit to the police station, maybe.
He ignored the offended response Clint gave him in favor of swiping sideways and pulling the phone up to his ear. “Hey, Tony,” he said lightly, jumping to his feet. Around him, there were various quiet ‘oooh’ noises, and he shot the room an unimpressed look before slipping out of the door and hurrying down the corridor.
He wondered if Tony had been serious, last night. About them being… a thing. A couple. He definitely
Tony opened his mouth to reply, but at that moment it seemed Thor lost patience and tackled them both to the floor, hugging them tight enough to bruise. Not that Tony gave a damn, mind.
Steve shut the door with his foot, reminding himself to get Tony’s key and lock the car seeing as JARVIS couldn’t do it any more. “Tony will get you somewhere better soon,” Steve assured him.
In response, Thor whirled around and then leaned down, kissing Tony on the forehead as well. “Now it is even,” he declared, and then turned away again, wandering off to the kitchen, presumably for more snacks. Tony just sighed and smiled at Steve
“So it’s your word against his, then?” Fury asked, “and you’re the one who walked up to him unprovoked and attacked him.”
He liked to think she was out there, somewhere. Maybe not in the city- she’d never liked it, not really- but with the stars. With nature. With the sun and the threads of gold it weaved through the buildings. She’d always been a ray of sunshine to him, after all.
and I still fucking said no, you can’t have it, this is mine- so yes, Steve, maybe I did feel sorry for you, because I fucking
“It’s fine,” Steve said a little warily, “I’m pretty sure you’re entitled to some yelling after I dragged you across the city to come fetch me.”
Steve just gaped, horror stricken as Howard began to back off, seemingly appeased. “They’re arriving in five minutes,” he called out as he left, “you be ready by then, or I’m draggin’ you down and makin’ you talk with your ass out.”
By the time he arrived back home that evening, he had done a grand total of three files altogether and had thought pretty much exclusively about the situation back at the tower. He was almost certain that Pepper had considered driving the heel of her shoe into his eye at least once, but he'd make it up to her once all this was over.
There were so many things that needed to be done. Families who needed to be reunited. Streets that had to be cleaned and announcements that had to be made. But people were too busy celebrating, and honestly, none of the Avengers were inclined to stop them. Humanity deserved their happiness. They deserved to sing and dance on the streets, hugging the friends and family that they’d thought were gone for good.
goddamn naïve about how you think the world works. This won’t just get magicked away. That boy could have brain damage.”
turn out to be a super mega genius,” Tony began quietly as Peter’s eyes fixed onto him intently, listening in to the best of his ability, “just remember that whatever you do, never try and be smart for other people. People knew I was a smart kid too. It… well, it sucked, actually. Everyone was always pushing and pushing and pushing, and I just wanted to play with my toys, but then someone would come in and tell me I had to do work instead, and I wanted to show them how smart and clever I was, so I’d do it. But I missed out on the playing. I missed out on a lot of things that most kids should have had.” Tony frowned, readjusting Peter in his arms and then listening to the sound of that inane fucking cartoon about the talking lemon and dead-eyed yellow dog play on the TV in front of him.
But time had passed, afternoon turning to evening and then night, and nothing had come. Now it was just Steve, alone on the snow-thick mountain, only able to see anything at all thanks to his enhanced senses. The blackness of night was almost stifling. It made everything so much more lonely, and Steve couldn’t help but think of the ice, of the plane and the arctic and the all-encompassing isolation that had followed. Of course, it did nothing to actually stop him in his tracks. He wasn’t leaving this God-forsaken mountain unless Tony was with him. He could take a bit of chill in the meantime.
not moved from the spot he’d been in thirty seconds ago, “-you just broke Tony Stark. I’m not sure I’ve ever seen his brain take that long to reboot before.”
Bouncing off the side of the wall, he arced up and got a hand around the branch, quickly taking firm hold and then pulling himself up to join Tony. When he saw the other boy staring a little incredulously, he just laughed and looked back over to the other, more illegal side of the wall. “Shall we?” He asked.
Steve’s fingers choked at his collar and his body moved in preparation to reel back for the final blow, and there was lots of yelling coming from different places and Tony didn’t think they were all from Steve, and suddenly there weren’t hands on his shirt any more but instead the sound of outraged yelling and static electricity, and he was falling, falling, his head hitting the-
“I know,” Steve told him, because he understood his best friend well enough to be able to finish that sentence for him in his head. “I know, Bucky.”
Tony looked at him, and his lip twitched in amusement. “My reputation exceeds me, I think,” he admitted wryly, “and I hate to break it to you, Rogers, but I’m not actually a good person.”
Tony looked down at him, managing to hold his resolution for all of four seconds before huffing and then slumping back down onto the bed with a dramatic sigh. “You are the worst,” he declared as he shut his eyes- but when Steve laughed happily and then swooped in for another kiss, he still reciprocated anyway. Unfortunately, his will was very, very weak.
The room erupted in yells and cheers, and Steve’s eyes widened in shock as Tony jumped off the table and slid down until he was able to throw himself at Steve, burying his face in the other mans shoulder and gripping the fabric of his shirt so tight his knuckles were white. “Yes, yes, yes, holy shit, I love you Steve, yes-”
Sam shrugged, making a gesture with his hand. “I mean, I’m naming these groups very generally, but… yeah. Mostly they’re just popular ‘cause they cause trouble, you know how it is- a lot of ‘em smoke and get expelled a lot and shit, it’s weird, man, I don’t get it-”
Steve’s heart sank at a steady pace as he listened to Fury reel off the facts: how Tony had become reclusive at the same time Iron Man had shown up, how there was intel which told them that he’d made purchases on the black market for parts that would only be needed for weapons designs that matched up with Iron Man’s armoury. Tony had stopped production of weapons nearly a year ago now, so there would be very little reason for those purchases. With every example Fury reeled off, another black mark was struck against Tony’s name. Steve could hardly believe it, but… but it was right there.
Steve grinned, and then pushed the door open with his shoulder before slicking back his windswept hair into something more manageable. Some of the residents shot him funny looks as he walked through the pristine marble floors with his ratty coat and beat-up sneakers, but he just smiled at them. Figured they needed a bit of joy in their otherwise uptight and miserable lives.
When they got back to his door, Tony looked up apprehensively. “You sure the Wilsons are gonna be okay with me jus’ marching in an’ getting comfy in their home?”
Steve watched him, still frozen a few feet from him as Tony shuffled around and searched for something in each pocket, before grinning in triumph a second later as he pulled his hand out from the pocket of his jeans and held up-
, Steve wasn’t one of them, “you’re gonna leave? Where to? Who are you going to go to, Tony? This is our home. You and me, we’re the foundations of this place, the glue that holds this team together. You know that. And you really say you’re going to just... leave?”
It was probably in his head though. Most of the time, everything was fine. Steve still kissed him, still held him during movie nights. He told Tony he loved him every night before he went to bed and ran his fingers through Tony’s hair while they both sat at the breakfast table. Most times, things were just as easy as ever.
“Whassgonon?” His body shuddered and he jerked forward, expecting darkness and cold and an impending sense of dread. HYDRA were coming. That much, he knew. He had to prepare. He had to analyse the situation, take in what he…
Steve frowned. “The usual crowd? Sam and Clint and Natasha, obviously. Buck and Peggy. Thor. Jane and Bruce, too, because I was feeling generous. Why do you ask?”
“Uh, Tony?” He called out, stepping onto the pristine white tiles and looking up the spiral staircase to his left. That’s where Tony’s room was last time he’d been right?
“You need to have words with your fucking friends, Rogers,” Rhodey gritted, looking across at him, “or I will.”
and then turned over the sheet of paper quickly, fingers working fast across the paper with a bold marker.
They both laughed, and then turned to greet Sam’s mom as she walked through the doors, looking harried as always as she fitted on her earrings and popped a piece of toast into her mouth. Always in a rush, was Mrs Wilson. Steve couldn’t help but feel bad- he just wished he could do more to help them out. They’d done so much for him, after all, it felt like he was just sat there taking and taking and taking.
Bruce leveled him with a glare, before pushing his glasses a little further up his nose and rolling his eyes. “I’ll give you five minutes.”
But it happened. Steve didn’t leave, even when the worry and the doubt that he just didn’t belong here in this futuristic place with Tony set in, he still stayed. He pushed through. Because he wanted to try and find Bucky, and he wanted to at least goddamn attempt to integrate into the new world he’d been thrust into.
Bruce got back up a few minutes later to double-check whatever traps they’d set up around the cabin, and then slipped out of the door to go swap shifts with Rhodey. As soon as the other man walked in the door, he went immediately to Tony’s side and knelt down next to him, getting comfortable on the floor with Natasha. They shared a smile and discussed battle strategies quietly as Tony dozed, but there was a lingering thought that he kept at the forefront of his mind, right up until he was strong enough to voice it: “You guys need to get back down the mountain. It’s too dangerous up here.”
Darcy just shrugged her admittance. “I know everything and I like to share,” she told him, nudging shoulders, “why do you care anyway Steve? You jealous? You hiding someth-
Halloween, and he’d been totally looking forward to spending it with Steve. What better way to bring the spookiness alive than by spending the whole night cuddling up to your very own vampire boyfriend, after all?
“Mmm, I’m surprised too,” Tony mumbled, shooting him a weak smile as Rhodey hurried forward and got to his knees in front of Tony. His hand settled over Tony’s. “How’d I look, Platypus?”
“What were you saying?” Rumlow jeered, the dual action of intense pressure on Steve’s windpipe and truly unbelievable pain in his midsection being enough for Steve to nearly black out completely, “talk all you want, Rogers, but that’s all you are. Big words and a pretty face. I’m gonna snap your neck and no one will even fucking care. Your friends are dead or estranged, your life is meaningless. You should’ve joined us at HYDRA. We could have given you purpose. Now you’re just gonna die as nothing but a stupid whore—”
“Nah, man, you know what-“ Sam began with a nod, “-I think I, y’know- think I I’ve actually sprained my arm from yesterday at the gym. It wouldn’t really be fair. Maybe some time later.”
“Steve,” someone said, somewhere in the part of his brain that wasn’t currently processing what he’d done, “Steve, can you hear me?” Natasha. It was Natasha’s voice, quiet and calm as if talking to a frightened child.
He sunk to the floor right alongside her, crossing his legs neatly and quietly. If she’d have seen him just then, she would’ve killed him-
He cried as he shoved all of his shit into the single suitcase that he kept under his bed for business abroad. Didn’t stop for the whole hour he packed, and with each item put in, he felt a different piece of him break. Everywhere he looked in his room, bits of Steve begged him, pleaded him to stay. Pictures of them hung on the walls. Steve’s shirt that Tony wore more than him. The sticky notes Steve left on his desk sometimes.
“This isn’t-“ he began, trying to find the words, “-I don’t usually do this, you know, it’s not… I’ll be better, I swear, it’s just… this week, you know, it’s hard, but it won’t happen again, I just need-“
Tony really did trust him. Despite… everything that had happened in his life, Tony had still chosen to let him in.
And, of course- perfect timing as always- right as he was about to stick his tongue in Tony’s mouth and try to persuade him to discard the idea of going anywhere, his stomach decided to give a very loud and very insistent rumble.
Tony raised his eyebrows at Thanos and clenched his jaw, mouth opening, because he would never in his life let someone else had the last word. “And we’re the fucking Avengers,” he growled, before Steve’s mind was filled with a string of
“I know,” Steve said, and he could feel the burn behind his eyes as he stood up jerkily, knew that if he stayed any longer Tony was going to see him fall apart, and he couldn’t put that on him, not now, “I know, it’s okay. I just need a moment. I’m sorry. I love you. This isn’t your fault. I’m sorry.”
Steve smiled, and it turned into a laugh, and then into something wetter, until suddenly he realised that there were tears falling down his face and his eyes were burning, chest heaving with each hitching breath. Natasha pulled him in easily, and Steve wondered whether she was crying too, or whether there just wasn’t enough left in her for it.
Steve fought him and he wished he’d done everything fucking differently, wished he hadn’t been such a fucking coward, wished that he hadn’t let down the one person who meant more to him than anything—but he had done all of that, he’d blown everything that mattered to him and now he was facing the consequences.
Steve eyed him, remembering what it was SHIELD had told him to say. “There’s a huge weapons stash that they’ve been collecting into one place, and I think they’re planning on selling them off to the same countries we’re supposedly at war with. Some sort of scheme to keep the conflict going, I dunno what exactly their reasons were—guess the longer the US remain in wherever it is they’re trading with, the easier it is to extract what they want from the country without consequence. But there’s enough weaponry in there to level a city. God knows who it’s going to.”
Steve just laughed harder, unable to hold himself back at the way Tony was hissing in annoyance at some corner of the room like JARVIS was stood there himself. His head dropped into Tony’s shoulder comfortingly, and he felt Tony’s hand curl protectively against the back of his neck almost subconsciously as he continued to argue with his own AI.
“Tony-“ Thor started, but Tony turned to him and shot a warning look over Steve’s head; shaking his head sharply. Thor shut his mouth, but didn’t look happy about it as he watched Tony shove his hands nonchalantly and then spring next to Ty.
Tony paused, and Steve got the feeling he was holding back a sigh of exasperation. “Hmm- yes, I gathered that much. I was just wondering, y’know,
Tony looked up at him. “Steve, have you just been out there climbing trees in your spare time today?”
Tony just laughed next to him, and Steve turned with a look of betrayal, wiping the droplets of his chin and then flicking them at Tony’s face. In retaliation, Tony dove forward and licked a strip up Steve’s neck and across his jaw, cleaning off any remaining coke, which… you know, was hardly a punishment, so Steve wasn’t going to try and fight back against that one. He just laughed, and then whoopsie, they were making out again.
“Thought she was dating Justin?” Sam asked over a mouthful of pasta, whilst Steve tried to invest all his interest in a spot of peeling paint in the corner of the room and not the fact that some girl had the hots for Tony.
“You had fun?” Steve called out, beginning to walk forward as Tony started his clamber back to the deck.
Steve stared down at the file beneath him, mouth open and eyes blank. As soon as he’d gotten into the building, someone had been waiting to escort him over to the top floor where Fury’s office was, and no one had said a word to him, not even once the door had locked behind him and he’d come face to face with the Director himself. There had been no greeting, no words traded as Steve had walked over to the desk—it had just been a short nod, a clench of the jaw, and then a file slapped down on the desk. The file which Steve was now looking at in bewilderment.
“Avengers,” he yelled, looking at Thanos from across the battlefield and showing his teeth in a smug grin of triumph.
“Quick, quick, put this around your sketchbook,” was all he got in response, and then a soft towel was placed into his hands, “try and get it dry. And whilst you’re at it-”
be good-- you have to look deep down inside you, and find the real answer to that. Is it a problem that you can talk about, and one that can be fixed? Or is it... more. You can forgive and forget, but there has to be a breaking point. A limit where you say ‘no, that’s wrong’.”
“I’m a trained soldier, Missus, emotional blackmail won’t work on me.” He set her down on her seat at the kitchen table when they reached it and then wandered over to the stove where Tony was frantically stirring at the pot in front of him. He peered over Tony’s shoulder to observe it, giving his husband a delicate kiss in greeting as he did so. When he saw the contents of the pot, however, he quickly turned back to his daughter. “Okay, you win. Pizza looks like the only option.”
Everyone was staring in disbelief, but at that, most of them laughed. It was so inherently Tony to still be cracking jokes right now, that the familiarity of his actions was an overwhelming comfort to the situation.
spill his guts. What exactly did he have to lose? “I was such an asshole to you,” Steve mumbled quietly, shutting his eyes as he took himself back to last year, back when everything had been so dark and the pain had been never-ending. “Toward the end, when Peggy…when she died. You tried to help and I just pushed and pushed—”
“I couldn’t give less of a shit how far Stark managed to get his dick up your ass, Rogers, that’s not what this is about,” Fury snapped at him, and Steve’s shoulders tensed automatically, because he wasn’t going to let anyone talk to him like that, Director or not. However, the other man’s next sentence managed to floor him completely and turn all his thoughts away from cussing Fury out in his own office. “New intel’s just come in, Rogers. We think Tony Stark might be the person behind Iron Man.”
Well. That was one way to get noticed. He felt himself blushing, looking down and hurrying out of the way before the guy deliberately drove over him. When his eyes turned back upward, they were pulled automatically into the gaze of the boy he’d been staring at seconds previously. Who had obviously heard the noise and looked up. At him.
"I have no family either," Natasha said, her face carefully blank, "so this has nothing to do with me."
“Maybe in a world where I’d never gone to goddamn war, yeah,” Steve snapped angrily, “I would love to get through one fucking birthday without screaming, y’know, would be
Steve should have found him. He should have gone and just talked it through, not been afraid of the consequences or the yelling, he should have just gone—
Steve blinked, thinking over the question as Thor just looked at him with a set of raised eyebrows. His hoodie was getting soaked through- he had to be freezing just stood there like that. “Well,” Steve began, “it’s not exactly going to be- uh- much fun.”
The call cut, and Steve giggled like a kid into the empty room before turning on his heel and scrambling for the bathroom. Once inside, he briefly despaired over the state of his hair in the dusty mirror, before grabbing his comb and trying to flatten it into place. A quick wash of his face and rigorous teeth-brushing later, and he was about as good as he was going to get.
His hands moved slowly and then curled around the belt loops of Tony’s jeans, only to be stopped by Tony’s hands- again. When he looked up questioningly, Tony just shook his head and frowned once more.
“No, Steve,” Bucky shook his head firmly, and Steve felt the shame start to bubble to the surface as he slammed his hands against the dash.
“Stop trying to give me money, Rogers,” Tony raised his hand and left the ten bucks that Steve had slid into the leather jacket on the table, “this is a fight you will not win.”
The gentlest of hands, too small to be an adult’s, settled on his leg. The singing stopped, replaced with: “Am I allowed to draw unicorns on his cast?”
It seemed like no time had passed at all before Tony was suddenly there, right in his face, gently pulling him off the floor. He moaned softly, too tired to fully enunciate the pain. The world was spinning. “Gotta go,” Steve told him, “you gotta…. They’re gonna come for you. I’ll be okay. Jus’…. G’outta here. Quick.”
“Just you is fine, sweetheart,” he whispered, before taking Tony’s mouth in a kiss, “all I need is you.”
Tony spluttered, pulling a face as he tried to think of a way to brush that off, except he couldn’t quite make anything roll off his tongue. He’d never thought of it that way.
He’d come close to death many times in his life. Sometimes it happened too fast to scare him, but other times, when there was waiting involved, he would always feel fear. He would always wonder what he was heading into— another life, another chance, or just the dark void of nothingness. Now, though, it didn’t cross his mind. He had minutes left to live. It didn’t matter. He was only alive in body. Every other part of him had died on that sidewalk with Tony 16 hours ago.
Steve couldn’t quite believe what he was hearing. If he was able to do that, he was pretty sure he’d never stop talking about it. But Tony- Tony was actively making sure it was kept hidden, and it didn’t make sense-
The man lunged, managing to close the distance between them in an inhuman amount of time. Tony wheezed as Steve tackled him, sending both of them crashing to the freezing concrete floor. The recognition was gone from Steve’s face now, whatever lucidity he’d had when he first saw Tony disappearing into the ruthless rage that had been present when he’d been killing all those HYDRA agents.
Steve was slightly taken aback by the seriousness of Tony’s words. They were standing close to one another- again, they always ended up like this, Steve didn’t know what it was, maybe he just got pulled in by Tony’s gravity, by Tony’s own force of attraction that was so hard to ignore no matter how hard he tried- and Tony was looking at him, begging with his eyes.
Paul nodded understandingly. “School takes it outta you, buddy, don’t worry- I’ll keep it down for you. Got some nice lasagna cooking for tonight, though, so you’ll want to be awake for that.”
“Peggy apologised though, at least,” Steve said softly, taking a small breath. “More than can be said for Bucky. Asshole.”
The trip down was fun; filled with loud rock music and junk food and their most valiant attempts at dancing while held down by seatbelts. Tony had thrown on some baggy jeans and one of Steve’s tshirts that was two sizes too big for him, and he looked comfortable in a way that Steve hadn’t seen in days and days. The man had been living in suits recently, and as beautiful as they were on him, they can’t have been comfortable. And Steve loved his casual looks just as much as his fancy ones, so there was really no one losing out.
He found Thor, crouched on his haunches in front of the couch with a deeply concerned expression etched like stone onto his face. The couch wasn’t facing Steve, so he couldn’t see what Thor was looking at, but he could guess.
Steve huffed and began to walk forward, hearing Tony fall into step beside him as he did so. The owners had said they’d leave the keys in the plant pot on the windowsill, and after a bit of rummaging he managed to locate them with a flourish, jimmying it into the lock and getting the thick oak door open a second later. “Temporary home sweet temporary home.”
Steve shrugged off his coat, damp from the heavy rain outside, and then rounded to face the couch. His breath caught in his throat, and any response he’d been about to attempt shrivelled and died. Suddenly, every bone and muscle and nerve was locked in place. All the cool he’d managed to hold onto on the journey here evaporated, and he sunk to his knees in front of Tony’s face, feeling tears spring up behind his eyes. “Oh,” he said numbly.
Looking behind him, he grinned fondly at the sight of Natasha and Clint bickering whilst Sam leaned back and watched with Carol at his shoulder, who’d walked up to them all just after Steve had gone. He’d got lucky with them and he knew it- he just had to remember it. Focus on it. It was easy to become lost in the tidal wave of grief, some days; but they were there for him and he had to hold that close.
A droplet of water fell from his nose to the floor, and he wasn’t sure whether it was from the water bomb or from his own eyes, but he flinched anyway. Just the sound. The sound of a fucking
“You don’t cry enough for me to be comfortable with, anyway,” Tony said gruffly, “you owe me tears, Rogers- I’m doing all the crying in this relationship right now and that is something I am not comfortable with at all.”
“I am still playing the frequency, and it appears that Thor and Barton are close to—” JARVIS cut off for a moment, before announcing firmly, “the second LMD has now been taken care of.”
(In his sleep, Steve sighs and rolls on to his back, pulling Tony along with him so his head is resting against Steve’s chest like it’s a pillow.)
Tony clenched his jaw. “Didn’t think to look after you when you were walking around in Lower Manhattan on your fucking own though, did he?” He muttered sulkily, before sighing. He shot a look over to Steve; eyes catching on the bloody lip and cut forehead.
Tony spent another two days after that awake, building and building and building anything that the team could possibly find useful.
“Someone was looking for the kid,” Steve said seriously, and once more, the room fell into silence as everyone processed it. Tony looked over to Steve, paling a little. The words Steve had said earlier resonated back into his head:
Before Thor could respond, however, there was another thud and then accompanying sounds of laughter as more people piled into the room. Tony turned to them, spotting all of his friends as they made their way into the medbay, carrying a variety of things. At the front was Steve, and to Tony’s utter bewilderment, he realised the man was carrying a whole table through the room, hands gripping the legs and holding the brunt of it up against his chest as he made his way slowly across the room. He just grinned when Tony stared. “Watch yourself,” he said, and then before Tony could speak a word, he’d swung the whole table right over Tony’s legs.
Steve, however, didn’t even seem to care about how tragic it sounded, because his whole face turned soft and he cocked his head at Tony before pulling him into an all-consuming embrace, mouth pressing into his temple. “There is no possible way you could be
Scrambling up to his feet, he lurched forward hurtling rabidly on deadened legs over to where Tony had just been thrown by Thanos, now holding the gauntlet in his hand with triumph. Tony clocked him and his eyes widened, sad and scared and horrified. He hadn’t wanted Steve to see.
“Uh,” Steve pushed away jerkily, and he stumbled to the side before the chest grew arms and caught him. Realising now that this was probably not just a hovering chest, he looked at a relative giant of a boy, long hair tied into a bun and smile bright enough to match the LED lights lining the room.
And sure, Steve was probably going to break up with him imminently, which Tony was very pointedly not thinking about via distracting himself with this, but even if he did, Tony wasn’t going to just discard this idea. Whether Steve loved him or hated him, he didn’t deserve the treatment he got. No one fucking did.
Tony’s eyes widened a little, and he rolled the words over his lips faintly a few times before asking, “really?”
Steve, who had tumbled flat-out on the couch as Tony had yanked himself away, fluttered his eyes open, looking at Tony in confusion. “Tony, what’s wrong, are you ok-”
“Oh, and who’s the one gossiping now?” Darcy pointed out, taking an innocent sip of her drink as Sam laughed across from them.
But that hadn’t happened. Instead, Tony had been there when Howard had gotten back, the news about his son still fresh on his mind.
“You think I don’t see the way you tense up when I walk up behind you?” Steve whispered, something so completely broken in his eyes that Tony thought he was going to cut himself on the edges, “you think I don’t notice how you’re constantly apologizing to me? You don’t even realise you’re doing it, Tony. I…
long year, Steve. I wish I’d had—well, fuck, I wish a lot of things.” He sighed, and then smiled at Steve somewhat tiredly. Steve noticed there was a new scar on his face; a little zigzag one running up from neck to jaw. He wondered how it had happened.
Tony stood up and moved over to him swiftly, checking him over just in case. But the boy was fine, and as soon as he clocked Tony, he lifted his head and raised his hands out in askance. Tony didn’t hesitate; wrapping his arms gently around Peter’s body and then taking him from Bruce’s arms. “Hey there, big guy,” he murmured as he gently rocked the baby on his hip, “you’re causing quite a lot of trouble in this place, aren’t you?”
“Yeah, I wouldn’t place your bets on that, Tony,” he said through a smile, watching Tony speed around the corner and into the streets of New York.
He could feel his heart hammering under his weak ribs, and resisted the urge to step backward. How long had Tony been packing for? He’d thought he’d be able to get away before Steve came back. Maybe he’d just come home earlier than Tony had anticipated, cutting his talk short in order to get back to the tower. Maybe one of the others had told him he’d been acting weird, and Steve had come back to investigate.
Tony looked back up at him and beamed. “Absolutely,” he said, before leaping off in the last few feet and landing like a cat. Perfectly. He turned around and then looked up to Steve’s window, before blowing a kiss. “Love you!” He said, and then scampered off down the road, leaving Steve laughing incredulously in the window up above him. He kept laughing, in fact, right up until Tony was long gone, and the sound of his motorbike had drifted off into the night.
He swallowed. Goddamn it, Steve. “Well tell him to come to bed- real bed. I… uh, I probably need some help, with the leg and all, you know.” He looked down at the dumb chair and the dumb leg with a clenched jaw, wishing it could just fucking go away. But it wouldn’t, and he needed to get into his pajamas and brush his teeth and he couldn’t do that without someone to help him. He wanted it to be Steve… it was selfish of him, but he just wanted the other man to hold him again. It’d been so long since Steve- real Steve, not… not the other version of him, had held Tony.
Bruce sighed. “Same as you. He set his sights on me as I passed down the corridor and then decided to take me for a ride. Which I actually don’t
“Pepper might disembowel me, but sure.” He shook his head and then laughed once more, dipping forward and kissing Steve again, his face freezing against Steve’s. They’d been walking through the city for nearly an hour, window shopping for gifts they were going to buy for Christmas, but now Tony was due for a business trip and Steve had to go back to the tower alone. Excursions abroad for StarkIndustries business weren’t that uncommon, although it had lessened over the last year or so as Tony stepped back further and further from the CEO elements and become more invested in R&D. Steve definitely preferred that. Not only did it make Tony happier, but it meant that he didn’t have to be on the other side of the world for extended periods of time.
And without another word, Tony took hold of the rafter and hauled himself up. After that, he got a foot up to the windowsill just above that- and then he was shuffling onto the lightly slanted roof as if all he’d done was take a gentle stroll.
Tony frowned, and he pushed his hair from out of his eyes in order to look down at Steve. “You really don’t look like someone who would get into as many fights as you do,” he said, eyes flicking upward a little, “it’s definitely the hair.”
in fact been an ulterior motive behind Tony’s actions, then it meant Tony wasn’t going to have taken that statement very well.
Three days, 9 hours and 3 minutes ago, Tony had been in the kitchen making lunch while on-call with Rhodey, and Steve had come in to make himself some toast, and Tony had kissed him absently in his form of greeting and then gotten on with arguing with Rhodey over the best Star Wars film, and Steve had watched him until he’d gotten bored and stood up to wrap his arms around Tony’s waist and kiss his neck, and Tony had grinned at him and called him antisocial and then stuffed the wooden cooking spoon in his mouth and asked him to tell him if it was too spicy.
He rolled his eyes, making three obvious banging noises on the floorboards before beginning to wander back the way he’d come through. Tony was off somewhere down another hall, maybe heading to the living room or God-knows-where in that huge ass house, but Steve could still hear him shuffling about, so obviously he was still nearby.
Darcy stared at him, before pulling a small and rather unimpressed face. “It should,” she muttered with a wince, “Ty’s… slippery. Be careful of him, Steve.”
He looked down at the man he loved and simply shook his head, his hand stroking up and down Tony’s back. “Things,” he responded cryptically, and when Tony frowned, Steve just smiled harder, “things possibly pertaining to you.”
to say,” Bucky interjected before Steve could go any further, “is that he won’t care. I promise. Just… give him something that
So the rest of these chapters are going to start off with the prompt I was given and then the response I wrote. Hopefully they'll make sense.
“Pr’b’y n’t,” Sam attempted to say, shrugging indifferently. When he swallowed, though, he went back to looking at Steve with slight concern. “You feel better now, though, right? I know you were having a tough week.”
Steve blinked, before turning around and looking toward the back of his room. He promptly choked on his own tongue and yelled in surprise when he saw-
Clint sighed, stepping forward and then taking Peter from Tony’s arms. He rolled his eyes and made an exaggerated face at the boy, who responded with what sounded almost like an affirmative noise. “Look, you adults go argue this out with one another, but I’m gonna get this little guy some breakfast and continue with Peppa Pig. Come on, chuckles, let’s go eat.”
Yanking off the bedsheets clumsily, he stumbled out of bed and then pushed his door open, padding down the stairs in complete darkness. He was still half-asleep, second-guessing whether or not the entire thing had just been a dream and he was going to open the door to the living room and find that no one was even there, and never had been.
pretty tired. But I wanna… touch your ass. S’nice.” He looked up at Tony again with his deep blue eyes, so genuine and honest as he asked “please can I touch your ass? Just a little bit.”
“—Be fine,” Bruce finished, giving him a small smile. His hand settled, firm and reassuring, against Tony’s shoulder. Tony tried to argue, but the words were too fuzzy to grasp and make real on his mouth. They hung instead in the air between them. Bruce, however, was not moved. “I’ll keep moving, stay warm that way.”
He could feel his arms start to shake, but he didn’t want to jostle Tony too much. He didn’t know what was happening. This wasn’t real. This wasn’t… a minute had passed since Tony had been telling him he loved him. A minute. He couldn’t be alive and then dead like that. That’s not what happened.
“SOMEONE’S HERE TO SEE YOU!” Sam answered, and then over the sound of popping corn Steve found himself listening to the muffled, smooth voice that rang familiarly in his ears.
As it turned out, it hadn’t been terrorists responsible. No robots or evil monsters crawled out of the alleys immediately afterward, signalling the beginning of a fight. It had just been a man, driven mad by his grief. He had seen Tony walking down the street and he had taken a shot. For Rachael, he’d said. That had been his wife. She’d died of cancer.
“Sleep, darling,” he said quietly, carding his fingertips through Tony’s hair whilst the other one gently worked his tie loose, setting it down over the armrest, “you’re safe here. I promise.”
him. He didn’t think anyone had ever said that to him before. It felt so strange, but in a good way. In the best way.
,” he said with a sigh, then another unimpressed look in Thor’s direction as he added “and his idiot brother.”
“Sure,” Steve said easily, voice calm and gentle- a mix between the Cap Voice and the voice he used when they were both still only just waking up in the morning; soft and pleasant and full of warmth. It helped. It felt familiar. “I’m going to put the towel around your neck now, okay? Is that alright?”
He saw in his periphery as Steve arrived in the kitchen and forced himself to look up. Being on the floor, he realized, was a stupid way to be broken up with, so he hurriedly stood up again. Then he actually took Steve in, and his mouth dropped open with shock.
“—we end up not being able to move past everything that happened— but I promise, okay, I’m better now. I’m not the man I was when I left, and every moment since the day you walked out I just wished I could have taken it back, tried harder, done—”
Eventually- what could have been five minutes or an hour later, Steve wasn’t too sure- Tony pulled up at the foot of Sam’s house and cut the engine. His foot stepped out, kicking the brake into place, and slid off gracefully. Steve attempted to follow, but the helmet obstructed his view and the seat was actually surprisingly high up, which meant he lost his footing about half way down. Yelping, he fell sideways, just grateful for the fact that he still had the helmet on for when he inevitably hit the tarmac-
excited for Halloween. He’d figured that they would go absolutely crazy for that season. It was pretty much catered specifically for them, after all.
“No,” Tony said, a little too fast. “Well- I mean, yes. But in all fairness, I did have an aircraft land on my head, so-
Tony’s voice was filled with laughter as he pushed weakly against Steve’s chest, “I really have to go.”
It wasn’t that Steve didn’t already know Tony was Iron Man—but he felt like if Tony said it, some of his earlier convictions might be solidified. He might not feel so… confused, about the whole situation. Tony had sounded so sincere when he’d said that he was going to be destroying the weapons.
He missed- hands hitting the dressing table next to him instead, and the glass of water he kept there tumbled loudly, smacking into his face and sending water all over him and his pillow.
Peggy sighed again. She folded up her legs on the bed and then shuffled around a bit until she was facing him. He kept his eyes fixed on the wall in front; hand tucked under the pillow and not even caring that much about how wet and uncomfortable it was. He hadn’t been bothered enough to swap it out after the glass had spilled all over it, and it had ended up sort of molded to him anyway.
“Yes, I know, everyone’s fucking told me that, don’t worry,” Steve cut her off, irritated by the same old warning, “I’m just wondering why the fuck that happened, and what Tony Goddamn Stark has to do with it.”
“Right,” Steve declared, bending down and taking Tony’s shoulder softly, “come on, love, I think it’s time to stop, for now.”
“24 hours? Don’t make me laugh- that shit was at least a month’s worth of emotional blackmail, come on-“
to be a protective friend, it just ended up being… slightly misplaced,” Bucky snapped irritably, walking into the front room with Steve at his heels. He stopped halfway through the door though, and Steve almost brained himself on the guy’s shoulder. “Although, now you’ve actually fucked, that
He looked up, checking the street name as he turned the corner, and frowned. That didn’t look familiar- Natasha had said Williams Street, not Turner.
Sparing one last look at the fancy patterns that had worked their way up to the surface of his skin, he padded out of the bathroom and then pulled on his pyjamas before falling into bed, one arm thrown out over Tony’s empty side as he drifted almost immediately into a light doze. By the time Tony eventually came up, Steve wasn’t entirely sure how long it had been, but he was sure he’d been asleep for a while.
Tony stopped, shocked, as Steve just grabbed his clothes like nothing was wrong. “Um, I’m sorry- did you just Han-Solo me? You did. You fucking Han-Solo’d me. God, i take it back. I hate you, you’re the wors-”
He looked down toward his chest as he felt Tony stir, and gently ran his fingers through the dark head of hair beneath him. So soft- longer, now, than it had been before. He tilted his chin and pressed a kiss into the curls, and with a soft hum, Tony settled back into him. Complete trust.
Tony was too worried to be annoyed, at that point- but Clint was going for it. It was really not a good morning for either of them to be speaking to one another, it seemed. “Ohh, shit, you must be real annoyed today- snapping at loverboy for trying to help? That’s a first. Usually all you do is laugh at all the shit he says and pine after him like a sick fucking puppy- old Pegs would be
Thor sighed, and even his breath just seemed heavy. “I love him,” he said quietly, “he is my brother and I love him, and I know with every day that he’s fading further and further away and
Some things could kill him. It was more difficult, but he wasn’t undefeatable. If Tony had wanted to, he probably could have killed Steve easily. Should’ve done, as soon as Steve put a fucking hand on him.
Day 21, and Steve finally decided to shave. It was boredom, mostly. Plus, the beard itched, and the shaggy hair had been okay when he was hiding and trying to cover his face as much as possible, but now it was just annoying. He’d not gotten around to it earlier because… well. Safe to say there had been some slightly more pressing matters on his mind.
“You said you wouldn’t have sex with me ever again if I didn’t protect you from his wrath when he found out, and I told you that you couldn’t go more than four days without me. You agreed, and said I had to protect you anyway. I did, because I’m a pushover for you in the mornings. Well, who am I kidding- I’m a pushover for you all the time.”
The team were now all looking thoroughly confused. “We didn’t think you were saying that, Tony,” Steve told him, frowning a little. “Are you-“
“Be safe, alright?” Was all Steve said in the end, sighing a little, “you… just look after yourself.”
And then, in the time it had taken for the bowl to crash and split into shards, it all started coming together.
That’s when Steve heard the first smack. He gasped, flinching away from the noise coming from the computer.
They walked through the corridors confidently and quietly, until Natasha veered off in the direction of the CCTV rooms. Steve had gone through his rushed plan with her already—she had a little pill that she would pop into a drink that she knew Joseph, the tecchie who worked the security room during nightshift, would like. In that pill was a concoction that would knock him out for an hour or two, and then wake him up later with no recollection of what had happened for the previous few hours he was awake. Steve didn’t want to ask why she happened to have a variety of sleeping pills and other drugs to hand in her apartment. It was easier to just let her keep her secrets. Either way, once she’d completed that part, she’d do her thing with the computers that would loop the feeds for long enough to get Steve where he needed to be without detection. He didn’t bother asking about that part either. Computer stuff had never been his forte.
“I have a plan,” Steve said slightly petulantly, before he sighed and put on his most earnest voice. “Natasha, please. Just trust me. Wipe any of evidence of us coming here from the CCTV footage, wait for my signal, then cut the feed and get the hell out.”
“We haven’t,” Steve blurted before either of them could continue, “we haven’t done… that, yet. Just- uh- making out. And dates and stuff.”
He thought about talking to Steve about it. About how he had to stop taking his anger out on Tony, that it wasn’t something they could keep doing, Tony could risk getting properly hurt by Steve and then it’d just be a mess- but he didn’t quite know how to broach it without Steve freaking out. He hadn’t mentioned anything about it, and so Tony didn’t want to be the one to do it. He didn’t want to know what the repercussions might be if he did. Anyway, it was... it was hardly even bad, really. Like he’d said earlier- superheroes. It was a different ballgame entirely, and Tony could take a knock or two. Hell, he’d had worse injuries from Steve when they’d been doing friendly sparring in the ring, and here Tony was acting like it was the end of the world.
It was easy to drift in and out of sleep- the night was late and Steve was tired, and by the looks of it, Tony was too. He lay out on top of Steve, snoring gently with his cheek pushed into Steve’s chest. He remembered what Fury had told him—never any guests, and a house like Fort Knox. Tony kept everyone at a distance, these days. Constant vigilance.
Steve tried to reply something witty, but his brain chose that moment to freeze up and leave him stood there like an idiot, staring blankly at the ink on his forearm. Tony just looked down at him and laughed again, taking a step backward. “Oh, you really are adorable,” he said, shoving his hands in his pockets.
He’s collapsed outside my fucking… Jesus Christ, is he okay? Is he injured? How long has he been out there, Clint, what the fuck, bring him in right now-”
He looked sideways, smiling wryly as Iron Man arced through the air and twisted through the trees, taking down gunner after gunner with practised ease. He’d updated his armour again since the last time Steve had seen him: Tony had been on a long-haul business trip on the West coast, so Steve hadn’t been with him in a good few months, except for week after the Mandarin attack when Steve had gotten the plane over to Malibu in order to help try and find Tony’s body in the wreckage of his home there, and then (Thank God, thank
That’s when Tony’s face seemed to drop a little. “Well… it’s not easy is it? I- I don’t want to unless it’s a last option. And I’m not… right now, I don’t have a lot of prospects, so getting a job would be hard, and, well, y’know-“ Tony shrugged, before looking down and tugging at his ear. “I’m scared,” he mumbled.
Thor nodded, and all of them sat back down on the couch, Steve sitting close to Tony and taking his hand, tracing lines over the back of his palm. He knew Tony liked it when he did that, and about five minutes later, Tony pulled a pen out of his pocket with a tired smile. “Can I get a doodle?” He asked.
“How about you tell my brother that I expect him home tonight, seeing as he hasn’t ben there for nearly six days now and I’m getting tired of eating alone, huh?” He asked, eyes flicking over to the back of the crowd one last time before he turned to face Tony and Steve, hand reaching to pat Steve on the shoulder.
Tony just rolled his eyes and dropped his head into Steve’s chest. He felt a long kiss pressed into his skin, just over his heart. “Mmm- if it’ll help you sleep easier. Want me to wear a hazmat suit at all times too? Just in case, y’know?”
Thor came back at that point, his footsteps loud on the wooden floorboards. “I’m making food,” he said, “and the rest of the guys are coming over in an hour or two. Tony, do you know when Rhodey and Pepper are supposed to be coming in?”
For a single second, he thought it might be cool if he got to rename it. Maybe he’d call it Anthony. Seemed like a good name for it.
Someone—maybe Bruce, maybe Clint—called his name, but Steve didn’t hear it. He was already running down the corridor, throwing his bag down on the floor carelessly somewhere to his left as he surged forward, shoving his way past people. They cursed at him as he passed, but he didn’t even notice it.
Clint paled, glancing over to the small baby. "Nope," he said, "no, that is not mine. No way. I always use protection. Always."
Steve wondered briefly if Tony always carried cigarettes with him on missions, just in case. But he didn’t ask. Instead, he just said “oh
“Steve?” Came the confused voice from the door, and Steve jerked, turning around quickly and looking up, spotting Tony leaning against the wall with his arms folded, looking at him in confusion.
He couldn’t quite hold in his laughter as Bucky shut the door moodily and turned to him, finger raised. He looked at the jacket for a second, grinding his teeth, but then just sighed. “I probably deserved that one,” he muttered in the end, before pushing Steve’s forehead away with two fingers and marching off, “but he’s still an asshole.”
With a small grin to himself, he pressed the button at the front of the big door, and waited to be buzzed in. Thor’s house was grand as well- although admittedly, not quite as extravagant as Tony. He lived in an apartment complex, but not the sort that Steve had used to inhabit. These obviously reeked of money. Steve had seen a fucking pool when he’d been walking up- the thought of having one of those just lounging around his home was just absurd to him, but whatever. Just how the other half lived, he figured.
“And Captain Asshole,” Tony continued with forced vigour, “if you’re the one who’s seeing this, then. Well. Fuck you, I guess. This? This is exactly what I was talking about when I said that somethin’ bigger was coming. Hell, maybe you’re not even… maybe—” he coughed and then huffed, shaking his own head to himself. “God, who am I kidding. Course you’re still alive. Not even God could put you down, could they Steve? Fuck.”
“All fine,” she assured him, raising a hand and stopping him before he could try and move, “safe and well. A few injuries amongst them, but nothing that time won’t fix. It was quite the fight, so I’m told.”
He should never have taken on this mission. He’d known, deep down, that this would happen. Tony was his kryptonite, and there had never been a hope in hell that Steve could do this and come out whole.
And Tony would have still been in the house, obviously. Finishing up whatever it was that he’d been so adamant on working through. Maybe if there’d been traffic, Tony would have gotten out. Maybe if Steve had argued with him a little harder, Tony would have agreed to just go over to Thor’s straight away.
Meanwhile, Tony had locked himself in his lab and gotten piss-drunk. Because that was the sort of hero
“Steve, do not do that to yourself,” Bucky said immediately, shooting a glance over to him, “you needed to get out as much as he did. You were hurt and whether it was purposeful or not, he still put you in a situation that you couldn’t cope with and then left you.”
Steve’s mind flashed back to every time he’d touched Tony freely and without consequence, before. Linked fingers and brushed shoulders and faces so close they were touching noses. Back-to-back as the read books under the sunlight. Teeth on skin and muttered curses and when Steve had been so consumed by Tony that it was the only important thing in his entire universe, and they’d whispered their promises of eternity on one another’s lips-
Peggy waved a hand vaguely, “you have to get out there! Hang out with people when they invite you places. Engage in conversation. Throw yourself into new situations! You are a free spirit, Steve, you are a child in the midst of the best years of your life! Go to… parties and stuff. Do kids still do that?”
It wasn’t perfect, but Steve’s brain wasn’t working well enough to try and make it better, so he just pocketed his phone once it was done and tried desperately not to let his mind go into overdrive with the theories and thoughts about what Tony might be thinking in that moment. Did he already know that Steve was gone? Or was he going to go upstairs once the meeting was done, searching for Steve and coming up blank? Would he panic? What if he didn’t even check his phone?
When Tony smiled back at him, though, it made Steve feel nothing short of perfect. “Good,” he said, before leaning back and digging a hand back into his jacket pocket, “then I can get started on the cigarette I so woefully had to postpone earlier.”
Tony tried not to think about the implications of that too hard as he sat down at the table and placed Peter in his high-chair next to Thor. The rest of the team were sharing glances at him, noticing his tension and wondering whether or not to ask, but Tony saw Steve shake his head minutely in their direction and they hastily began to talk about something different and entirely mundane. Tony appreciated that. The noise was nice. He looked down at Peter as Thor meticulously began to cut up his pieces of soft chicken, brow furrowed with concentration, and the scene made him smile. They’d learned that Peter needed his food squares to be just so, otherwise he’d refuse to eat them, and now Thor had taken to that challenge like the fate of the nine realms depended on it.
“Looking for you,” Ty answered equally airily, but Steve could tell the tension in the air immediately, “you’ve been disappearing a lot lately. You still owe Sunset a pack of cigarettes, you know. You said you’d get them for her next time you went out back.”
Steve blinked, swallowing down the lump in his throat as Clint rested a hand gently against his shoulder. “I’m glad you are,” he said, making sure his voice was firm, “there’s—I was told by the doctors, straight after getting the serum, that, uh, I have higher blood pressure than normal people, so if you hit an artery, it’ll kill me faster. Don’t bother engaging in hand-to-hand. You just gotta find a way to get me while my back’s turned and—” he licked his lips and gestured to the side of his neck where his jugular lay, looking at Clint’s horrified expression and wincing. “Just in case,” he whispered with a small nod.
He’d even lost the silver ring he’d kept on his thumb. That one hurt the most, that was what he’d fought hardest for- but it had been three against one and all he’d gotten from it was another punch which seemed to have cracked his rib.
"Fuck off, Steve, I'm moping," she replied, her voice muffled by the couch cushions. Steve tried to dislodge her, but she was unfairly strong and it was mostly a failed endeavor. The most he managed to escape was one foot, but the other remained firmly perched.
Steve found that a little hard to believe- but then again, how many of Tony’s friends did he actually like? Thor- and Rhodey, but he went to college, not highschool. And then…
“I’ve got agents saying that one of them is impervious to bullets,” Widow added, “another is pyrokinetic, two are mild speedsters, and they’re saying there’s even a guy that’s part-robot.”
But Thor, because he was Thor, didn’t let go. And after a few seconds, Steve just went completely limp in his arms- to the point where he wasn’t even using his own two legs to stand on, and he fell to his knees, head held in his hands.
“I think we are just going to accept defeat on this one and go the fuck to sleep,” Sam said, and when Steve looked over, he saw that his friend had wrapped himself up in a blanket so tightly it looked like a genuine cocoon. “I have work in the morning, you bitches.”
“One day you’re going to get caught doing that,” Steve told her with a raised eyebrow, folding his arms in front of him.
He rolled out of bed with a dull groan and then lay sprawled on the floor for a few seconds, tangled up in blankets. He fucking hated mornings. There was honestly not one good thing about them.
“They have yet to find a name,” JARVIS told them all, “but since the first night in which Peter was left on the door of the tower, I have been monitoring the internet in an attempt to find a match with the partial facial scan I managed to get on her. This… appears to be an 89% match. She checked into a hotel five minutes away from the tower on the same night that the child was dropped here.”
besotted,Tony leant up and returned it, his hands snaking around Steve’s neck to close any possible space between them as his teeth nipped gently at Steve’s bottom lip, eliciting a delightful little sound from the back of Steve’s throat in reply.
She nodded, mirroring his body language like she always did and leaning back, relaxing a little. “Good, good. Want to tell me something that happened in particular? It’s always nice to think of some positives, rather than just the bad stuff.”
Steve didn’t argue. He knew it was true, and this was beyond their own personal issues with it. This was about Peter’s safety—and that was fast becoming one of the most important priorities they had, period. “I’ll be there with you,” he offered instead, “you won’t have to look at it all alone.”
“S’okay,” he muttered, moving his hand to cradle the back of Peter’s head, run through the little boy’s downy curls, “I’ve got you. You’re okay now. You're okay, squirt, I swear, I... fuck.
He refused to watch Steve as he left the room. But as the sounds of the doors whispered through the room, Tony let himself look up with watery eyes. His hands were shaking like crazy, and he’d never felt more off-kilter in his whole life. He couldn’t stop the tears that sprang behind his eyes. It felt like everything was falling apart- this wasn’t the Steve he’d fallen in love with, it felt like it had happened so fast- or maybe it had been coming for a while, but Tony had just been too blind to notice.
Steve watched the events unfold from the relative safety of Tony’s quinjet—saw the tanks turn their weapons on the Robot’s back and begin to fire, and then watched as the thing turned to face them, taking a threatening step forward and lock & loading the next round of explosives that were being fired from its wrist. Steve locked on the target and fired a concentrated blast right up on the Robot’s chest. At the same time, a dozen other machine guns followed suit, and missiles pummelled the Thing’s front. Steve watched as Iron Man swooped down from the sky, arms outstretched, and this time when he reached the barrier surrounding the robot, it seemed to be less of a brick wall and more of an elastic surface- and one that was close to tearing.
Eventually, Tony saw another hatch a few meters ahead, and now it was just a desperate race as to who would get there first- Clint to them, or them to the vent.
“Come onnnnn, Steve,” Clint prodded him in the side with his feet and grinned, “we’re friends, it’s what friends do-“
Tony nodded his agreement, and then spun on his heel. “ I’m sure the staff keep some spare clothes here somewhere, if I can just remember where they keep them-”
Steve just hummed, dropping his mouth down Tony’s chin, over the skin of his throat. “Forgive you,” he slurred, before burying his nose into Tony’s skin and taking a sharp breath in, and
But whatever. He dismissed it fairly quickly- too early to be worrying about those things after all.
“No,” Tony cut in, slicing a hand through the air, “I am an adult. I do not need to be shown how to play some dumb kids game. I’ve gone this long without it, I don’t-”
“Go put on some pants while I make us all some food,” he whispered in the other man’s ear, “and then maybe in a few hours I’ll take ‘em off again.”
Steve chuckled and got to his feet, hand locking with Tony’s as they both wandered to the entrance on the other side. Getting to his knees, Steve crawled into the entrance, framed by what appeared to be a stack of books, and then his mouth dropped open.
“Thank you,” he murmured suddenly, frown springing to his face, “did I say that already? I really hope I did- I mean it. Thank you so much. You’ve been… amazing. Really. I feel kinda terrible; I mean I’ve been asking you to do all this shit for me and then-“
“Oh, as if you can even say a word about baby rules,” Bruce snapped as he turned on his heel and then ran back over to the living room. Steve frowned at Bruce’s words and looked at Tony, but he didn’t get much support.
“Not when the children are enhanced, they’re not,” Bruce told her sharply, “they have a bad track record and you know it.”
Tony pulled away before he could even voice any of that, eyes still shut and breathing heavy as he knocked his forehead against Steve’s temple. “Gonna drive me mad,” he muttered with a fond shake of his head.
Fury watched her go, before he turned back to Steve. For a moment, it looked like there was something in the man’s eye—compassion, maybe. He folded his hands on the table and looked at the two of them. “If you don’t tell me what happened, then I can’t punish Stone for whatever it was,” he said, voice going a fraction less severe. “Rogers, I know you. I know you come in here regularly, but not for the reasons that most boys your age do. You come in because you’re fighting for other people and not yourself. That’s the only damn reason I’ve not already suspended you. But this? I can’t accept.” He paused, waiting for some sort of response from Steve or Bruce. When neither of them gave one, he just sighed. “If I can’t get some evidence for what happened to Tony that caused you to react in that way, then I’m sorry, but I can’t help you.”
“No, sorry, I didn’t mean it… It was fine, honestly,” Tony waved him off, “honestly, genuine excuses to leave parties are great. You did me a favour.”
“—and I was hurting, but that wasn’t enough for me, and so in the process of grieving I put you through hell too and I didn’t even fucking
Thor didn’t waste another second. He stumbled backward and then sprinted after the LMD that was making its way up the stairs, his hand extended and summoning Mjolnir into his grasp. Tony turned back around, watching Steve flip back onto his feet and then leap into the air, his foot snapping out into a front kick. But Michael moved with unnerving speed, slapping Steve’s leg out of the way as he stumbled out of the danger zone. Natasha was hot on his heels, however; an arm snaking around the LMD’s neck and attempting to hurl him over her hip. Tony grabbed Bruce’s arm and looked at the other man, his eyes clenched shut and his breathing coming in steady. Tony needed to help the other two- but first of all, he needed to stop an oncoming Hulk Incident. They couldn’t afford that- not unless they’d expended all other options.
Steve made his peace with the floor, and was unconscious before his cheek had even touched the ground.
have too many zips, you’re right, but I also really like you and have done for six years, I’ve always just been too scared to tell you?” Tony shrugged sheepishly. “But there. Offer’s on the table. Hey! Kill two birds with one stone- the hospital trip can count as our date, and then if you decide that actually I’m not evil whilst we’re there, we could maybe go for a second one sometime?”
Tony didn’t respond, and Steve left the room with Rumlow’s smug stare pinned to his back, and Fury’s angry one waiting in front of him. His mind was racing, and more than ever, and those seeds of doubt Tony had sewn were rapidly growing in his mind. Tony had said it all with such
-And then, without warning, he bent low and shot an uppercut to Tony’s stomach, hard and brutal and enough to knock the air right out of his fragile lungs.
Steve just hoped that this would go down well. Of course, he wasn’t going to push. If Tony insisted on staying, there wasn’t exactly much Steve could do- but he had the feeling that wouldn’t be too much of a problem. Tony wasn’t a dense man, not really. He knew when he’d taken on too much, and what his limits were. Steve knew them too.
“Yeah, ‘cause that’s clearly all you care about him for, isn’t it,” he said, “but yeah, you’re gonna have to act like big boys and girls and pay for your own drinks tonight, because he’s not meeting you. Now fuck off.”
Tony shook his head and just walked quietly with Steve, holding the baby as carefully as he could until they eventually both slipped into their room a minute later. Steve got to work with setting up the couch, while Tony softly commanded JARVIS to order foods that were suitable for babies to the tower for the morning. He'd probably need formula too, right? He put it on the order.
it was just who Tony was. Yeah, maybe sometimes it made him a little jealous and he’d pout and then kiss Tony a little bit harder, but it had never mattered. Or at least, Tony had never thought that it mattered.
Unfortunately, however, Tony didn’t end up managing to make it up before Steve had finished his bath, despite spending a quarter of an hour longer in there than he ever usually did. By the time the water was lukewarm, Steve had accepted defeat and slipped out to grab the towel. He figured Tony probably did have a lot of work to catch up on, considering he’d cut half his day short to go and fret over Steve at Medical.
Tony chuckled. “It was a bad day for the both of us. I’d been trying to make a statement, she’d been trying to relieve stress, it worked out. Everything just… went from there, really.”
Steve could still hear the silence that had rung out in their room after that outburst. He hadn’t known quite what to say; frozen like ice to the spot as he’d stared numbly over to Tony, who’d gone still as well. His eyes were wide, shocked at his own words. They’d both agreed not to talk about…
Tony steeled himself and then stepped over the first body, making his way down the stairwell. “I can’t wait,” he gritted, “Steve needs me. I’m not going to just sit around.”
He nodded, licking his lips as he looked down at Tony and raised his hand. He paused just before it settled against Tony’s reactor though, nervous. He wasn’t sure whether Tony would want him to do that now. Put his hand right on the most vulnerable part of him.
Steve had no idea why Tony would even want that. How he could stand to have Steve near him after everything was a complete mystery- Steve neither belonged nor deserved to be close to him right now. But Tony didn’t seem to think that. Tony, for whatever goddamn reason, was still trying to forgive him.
They were both dressed sharply; the girl in a sleek ponytail and red lips, darker than the sort Peggy wore. Rhodey had his arms folded, and his eyes were solemn as he looked at Steve unwaveringly.
“Steve, just tell me if Tony is with you so we can decide whether we need to order our own drinks or not,” Tiberius said with an irritated sigh, and all at once Steve’s hackles went up and he scowled mutinously.
“And we’re very proud Steven,” Peggy patted him on the shin and then flicked him, “but how did it happen? Where did you two sneak off to last night?”
Steve had been out celebrating his promotion with Bucky and Peggy, the two of them egging him on to drink more than he probably should, and Tony had just been forced into going somewhere that wasn’t his workshop by an exasperated and mildly worried Pepper. Tony would later say that it was him who started the ball rolling; catching Steve’s eye across the crowded bar, romcom style, and smiling at him, but Steve disagreed. He was almost certain he’d been the first one to smile. Not that it really mattered. But it had been fun to bicker about in the mornings.
“Steve,” Clint managed to finally catch him half way through the week, and Steve loved him, but not right then. Not right then. “Please, buddy, just tell us what’s wrong.
“You hiding from someone again?” He asked after a second, but Tony just shook his head a little and leaned forward, bracing his elbows against the table as he turned and grinned at Steve.
to never try and use your reactor for anything other than its designated use in your chest. You didn’t listen to me either.” His gaze flicked down with a small frown, hovering over the light in Tony’s chest. He swallowed. “It looked horrible,” he admitted, “so empty. Where your heart was supposed to be, where the light… it was just black.”
Later that night, Steve lay on his unmade bed, stared at his peeling ceiling, felt the moonlight as it slowly rose up into his window and blanketed itself over his face. His room was dark and silent. It was sometime in the early hours of the morning. Sleep was not even a thought that crossed his mind.
, the bad guy that I had to bring you in to keep people safe—but I was still just as in love with you as I had been the day I asked you to marry me. And if I had had any fucking sense, I would have never gone through with it. And I’m not—it’s not an excuse. It doesn’t change what I did. But I’m just… so, so sorry, Tony. So sorry.”
He couldn’t breathe. His chest was concaving in on itself, there was a jagged gap where his heart should be, someone had their hands in his chest on a dirty bench in a cave and he
Tony paused, huffing out a breath of laughter. He turned a little; a hand reaching under his collar and pulling out a small chain. There was what looked to be one half of a crescent moon attached to the end of it- simple, but obviously expensive. Valuable. When his fingers curled around the thing on the end of the chain, they stroked across the surface with such delicacy- love. Steve watched it with curious eyes.
“Of course it counts. Everywhere is different and that is a fact. So you gotta keep an open mind and not let any bad impressions get you down, okay? It’s all gonna work out fine.”
After dinner, Steve and Tony both ended up going to bed pretty early, just because the road trip over had managed to tire them out, and Steve was supposed to call in at SHIELD early the next morning anyway. They sank into the familiar mattress with a joint sigh, Steve’s hands automatically going to their usual position around the back of Tony’s waist and pulling him in in order to bury his nose into the other man’s soft curls. It was only a few seconds in which they were silent, however, before Tony was sat back up in bed again, his fingers clicking in a show of remembrance. Steve sighed. “Whatever it is, can’t it wait ‘till morning?”
Thor sighed deeply and then joined Tony in leaning on the table despairingly. “Because when those two go off, they undoubtedly end up dragging everyone else along with them. More so in my case, because he’s my fucking brother,” Thor muttered, “but not this time. I refuse to get evil-eyed by Bain for the next three weeks. I’m staying out of it.”
With every development Peter made when he was in their care, all of them were going to become more and more entrenched in his life. And then he was going to leave them, and it would all collapse.
Steve sniffed, leaning in against Tony’s uninjured shoulder and letting his fingers grip softly against the other man’s neck. He made sure to keep his touch impossibly light- the images of what he’d done before were burned into the back of his mind, and he couldn’t rid himself of them.
“Digging yourself into a hole here, man,” Sam patted him on the shoulder and shut him up as Steve’s eyes went narrower and narrower, “but Steve, he’s just surprised, that’s all. It’s not a secret that Tony’s more relaxed about that sorta stuff. Why do you think he’s not made a move yet?”
Steve waited for a response, but Richards remained voiceless. And Steve could only wait so long. “I need access to it,” he repeated, harder this time, “now.”
sorry. There were a billion words on his tongue, but none of them were enough. None of them ever could be.
That, for some reason, took Tony back a little, and he blushed adorably as he looked away. “Well, I mean, it’s just-“
He stood there and watched them turn and walk away, a few of them looking to snigger at him as they did so. Tony didn’t turn around once. Just blanked him.
“I told you not to get electrocuted again,” Tony said weakly in an attempt at lightheartedness, but it came out a little more strained than he intended, “you goddamn asshole, why don’t you ever listen to me?”
Steve was going to dump him. Oh God, that hurt. In fact, Steve was probably out somewhere moving on already. Because he was hot, and he was already involved in a close community of equally hot people, and hell, he and Tony had only been dating for a month and a half anyway, so maybe Steve didn’t even think it’d ever been serious in the first place.
Clint pulled a face, shifting Peter on his lap. “I didn’t call them,” he said, and everyone stilled in their seats.
“Since when did Jane start sticking her tongue in the mouths of guys she doesn’t know on her first meeting with them?” Tony said smoothly, mirroring her smile before leaning over Steve to grab some popcorn. Steve made sure to stay very still, just… just in case. Of something. Steve wasn’t sure what.
He tugged Tony’s hand and pulled him forward, kissing him gently. It hurt, because his nose was still throbbing at any light contact, but it was worth it anyway. Tony kissed him back just as soft and tentative, like he was still nervous Steve was going to turn around and push him off any moment.
Tony shook his head stiffly. “I’m not- I’m not staying long,” he said, and then held out his hands, showing off the bunch of stuff to Steve. “Here,” he jigged them a bit, “uh- your stuff. I found it.”
“Look, I’m not sorry I did it,” Steve interrupted before Tony could try and say anything else, “nothing anyone says is going to make me sorry, either. He deserves everything he got and then some.”
“Oops,” Bucky made a face and then turned back to Steve solemnly. “Dude, I know you’re in love with him an’ all, but if ya want I’ll still punch him for ya.”
Steve frowned, hands flexing against Tony as he looked up and around the room, as if expecting food to magically appear for them. When it didn’t, he growled again quietly and then, surprisingly, shifted his weight and lowered, placing Tony very very gently onto the floor. Tony looked up at him, and Steve nodded once, his hand pressing firmly into Tony’s chest. “Stay,” he murmured, nuzzling Tony’s head gently once more before straightening up and turning on his heel.
They avoided each other in the day and screamed at each other in the night when they thought he was asleep. Pops had been sleeping in the spare room for at least six of the seven nights it had been going on for. Dinner time had become a nightmare; Uncle Clint having to swap seats so he was sat in between them and prevent another fight from springing up while they ate.
Tony paused, and then nodded once, looking back down intently at the folder under his hands. 52 was a normal rate for Steve, seeing as his heart was naturally slower than most baseline humans. He was fine. Just like he’d been fine 2 hours ago, and 4 hours ago, and this morning, and the day before that. He really knew by this point, that he should just cut it out. It was weird. Steve was okay.
“None of us celebrate Halloween,” he said bluntly, “and none of us want to, okay? It’s a shitty, shallow celebration that doesn’t mean anything. We’ll come over if it’s just a normal gathering, but we’re not… we don’t do that.”
Tony pulled a face. "Oh, I wonder why?" He picked Peter up and slotted him against his hip, walking over to the two of them, "perhaps because your potential son was screaming the entire night and now I can't close my eyes without getting flashbacks? Maybe that's why."
Thor looked back at him. “We do what we can here,” he said with a nod, “the concussion is the most dangerous injury, so we have to monitor it accordingly. Falling asleep will be okay, but we’re gonna need to wake him up periodically to check on him. I don’t think it’s his wrist that’s hurt, now I’ve looked a little better—but it’s a dislocated shoulder, so we’re gonna have to set it back in place for him.”
Bucky looked slightly horrified. “I didn’t… God, Steve, I didn’t know, I’m really… fuck. This is all my fault, isn’t it?”
Steve pauses again, eyes horribly sad as he looks at Tony. He wants to know what’s going on in that soldier brain of his- but he’s pretty wasted right now and the thoughts won’t process properly.
He wasn’t sure how long it had been. Once more, he couldn’t remember much. Falling, he does recall. There were…. The team, they’d all been there. He’d said-
Tony pondered that for a moment, before shaking his head. “Not worth it,” he decided, hearing Steve whistle above his head.
“Hey, I mean, at the end of the day, he’s probably warmer than all of us,” Peggy said with a shrug as she jumped up and down and then rubbed her hands together. “Why are we all loitering outside the mall in the freezing cold anyway?”
Bits of the armour were littered on the counter. Little drawings, newspaper clippings and photos were hung on the walls, reminding him but doing nothing to actually help him
Steve watched him anxiously for half a second before twirling around and hitting an attacker in the face when they got too close. “Bucky, watch the ship,” Steve gritted, sprinting a few paces away in order to try and open the hatch on the other side of the deck, where their backup was undoubtedly waiting behind.
Obviously, though, Steve wasn’t going to make him do anything. If Tony wasn’t ready, that was fine. He could wait as long as Tony wanted him to- even if he was never ready for the rest of their relationship, that would be okay. He would just have to… spend a little more time with his right hand or something, but he could do it. It wasn’t a problem.
Tony grinned up at him in response and then pulled out his gift from the expanses of his pocket. He tossed it into Steve’s chest, and the boy’s free hand caught it easily. “Saw it in the store while I was buying brunch bars. Thought it would help satiate your chocolate addiction.”
me. How did you manage to take a good thing he did and make it looked awful? Why did you have to hurt him because of your own stupid fucking hangups about not being able to look after me? “
Steve couldn’t help but laugh at the pure Thor-ness of that; patting him on the shoulder as he made his way out of the door, Jane under his arm. “Until next time, Steve! May these last few hours of your birthday be as merry as can be. I had a wonderful time tonight.” At that, he looked down at Jane with a softness Steve hadn’t ever seen in the boy before, and then saw the bashful little smile Jane returned him. It was… adorable, that’s what it was.
Distantly, he heard Clint ask ‘what’d I do?’ behind him, but the man was no longer Tony’s centre of focus. He leaned both hands on the kitchen table and looked solemnly at Peter, who was now sucking the crayon idly as he scrunched up the corner of paper with his fist. When the boy noticed Tony,  he broke out into a gummy smile and held up his arms expectantly.
That couldn’t happen again. Tony… Tony needed to remain useful. He’d learned how to speak fluently in Japanese by the next week after that debacle, so he could do this.
“You are so, so stupid,” he said, voice cracked and wet, and Tony didn’t want to look up. He was terrified, because he knew what was coming. He’d failed. And in the process of his failure, he’d managed to wreck a dozen floors of the tower and send the team into a panic. If that hadn’t secured his dismissal from the team, he wasn’t sure what would.
When Tony walked Steve to his door half an hour later, he was wearing the most adorably bashful smile Steve had ever seen in his life. “This is very stupid, but I don’t really want to let go of your hand right now,” he admitted, a little pink flush creeping across his cheeks as he watched his own feet shuffle nervously along the floor.
“Yeah, okay, so how the fuck do you think you’re gonna find him then, bright spark?” Bucky asked dryly, leaning against the frame of the door and shooting Steve an unimpressed look.
Tony paused. “What, you think he’s some sort of… experiment?” He asked. “If that were the case, why the hell would they bring him to us? That doesn’t make sense.”
Everyone went quiet at that, as the realisation sunk in. Natasha was right; they were getting too far ahead of themselves. Tony watched as Steve’s jaw tightened fractionally and turned back to his dinner plate, and Thor’s smile slipped quickly off his face. Natasha just sighed and then attempted to pull the topic back onto lighter ground. “But honestly, I agree with Clint. Peter seems to be working beyond the capabilities of an average kid his age, so who knows. Maybe we do have a prodigy on our hands.”
?” Tony snapped irritably as he dived out of the way of another missile, looping around the giant robot so that it hit its barrier instead. Steve said nothing; too busy watching the SHIELD vans roll in from his vantage point up in the sky. He knew that they had specially developed weaponry to fight Iron Man. He knew they would probably not hesitate to use them, although they may be a little smarter and see that for the time being, Iron Man was fighting for their cause.
“You really shouldn’t make a habit of getting your head stuck in things,” Tony laughed, and Steve knew he was thinking back to the terrible helmet-incident too, “what happens when you put on hats? Or have you just decided to never risk that?”
Of course, though, Steve came to the rescue not even half an hour later. Apparently calmed down from his earlier outburst, he found Tony still scrubbing at the floor of their bathroom and then sighed loudly, the “oh, Tony,” permeating the air like a heavy bass note in a silent auditorium. He crouched down on his haunches and then gently pulled Tony into his chest, stroking his hair until he stopped shaking so hard, and then gently pressed an ice-pack to the swelling on his cheek.
Blinking blearily, he watched the sunlight filter in through the windows and lifted his head a little, following the sound of a running faucet and the buzzing of a razor. The door to the bathroom was open wide, and Steve spotted Tony leaning over the sink, delicately trimming his goatee into perfection.
Above him, Tony sighed. “Okay. So that was a lie. I’ll let you down right now if you want me to, I’m not an asshole, and I’m not going to force you to go the hospital, but I really think you should. And. Also. The date thing. You should do that too. Because I’m an asshole and my jacket probably
Tony felt his expression stick on his face awkwardly as the thoughts occurred inside his brain, but it went unnoticed by the rest of the team, all too busy pampering Peter and lavishing him with their attention. They were living off borrowed time, and everyone in the tower knew it, but no one was trying to distance themselves from the inevitable downfall that Tony could see was coming. He had a bedtime routine and a favourite toy and, and God, Tony scheduled his meetings around Peter now, he hadn’t even really thought about it, he was just doing it because it was the obvious thing to do. Why wouldn’t he do that? Peter needed him. Tony, whether he liked it or not, had essentially become a stand-in fucking father to this child. So had Steve. And they’d not really spoken about it, they’d not made a point of it, but it was true.
Tony blinked, before just nodding, still rather dazed as he looked at Steve. “Uh huh. Yeah.” He jumped a little, and then raised a quick finger and turned away, stumbling back over to where they’d been a second ago. Steve watched in amusement as he hastily yanked on a pair of oven mitts and then pulled out their cookies, throwing the tray uncaringly on the side and then turning back to Steve immediately. “Okay, so now the house won’t burn down too.”
“And I thought Tony Stark wasn’t Iron Man,” Steve gritted out, which was a little pathetic as far as comebacks went, but he could admit that his mind was focused on other things. “Guess we’re all in for some surprises today. Now tell me what you want me to do.”
“Ah, it appears the receptionist has already given them entry to the elevator,” JARVIS told them apologetically, “I could stop it if you wish?”
Steve laughed, shutting his eyes as he took another drag. It had been what- ninety years, now, since his last smoke? He didn’t even have the craving any more, but it was so familiar, it had almost the same effect as if he had.
Tony felt like there was lead in his chest. He felt like an idiot, a jerk. He hadn’t… it had been so badly worded, the whole thing had been stupid, he should have just listened to what Steve had to say. “Steve, please just let me—"
As Steve continued to sing to him, Peter relaxed a little in Tony's arms, head drooping onto Tony's chest as he swayed them both gently and remained as quiet as he could. He listened almost as intently to Steve as Peter was, hypnotized by the strange language. He supposed that was the point of a lullaby, after all.
He leaned back again, looking up at Steve reverently before pulling up for a soft kiss. It was short and gentle, but it was everything Tony knew he wanted. It was a grounding force. And tonight, he would probably wake up gasping for breath, clutching desperately at his heart and begging people who were long-dead to
He and JARVIS didn’t talk until Steve got into Thor’s apartment, when the AI quietly thanked Steve as he was placed down on the coffee table. Tony was awake when Steve came back, sitting up on the couch next to Thor and gingerly holding a mug of what seemed to be tea in his hands. He looked awful. There was no other way to put it. His face had surpassed pale and moved to almost translucent, and one side of him was covered in dark purple marks. He looked… defeated, more than anything.
He shook his head and hurled the last motorsled-engine onto the pile. It wasn’t worth worrying over now. He would do it when they got back home. And that was fucking promise.
Tony clenched his jaw and sighed, turning to Steve and poking his cheek. “Fancy letting me down for a bit, big guy?” He asked, “it’s been about ten hours since I consumed any liquids and my kidneys are starting to complain about it.”
He cut himself off with a shake of his head, and then tried to hold back his grin when he caught Steve still stifling his own laughter behind a hand. “You’re an idiot and I hate you,” Tony told him, folding his arms.
“Yes, do that,” Tony snapped, before Natasha said “no, that’s going to be too suspicious. We don’t want them calling the cops or getting any more involved than they already are. We’re gonna have to spin a story- tell them the mother came back or something. How much information did they get on the phonecall?”
Later- once Tony had finished messing around with the makeup and his hair in the bathroom (Steve hadn't realized the Messy Yet Effortless look took quite so much... effort) and they were finally walking out of the door, Steve suddenly found himself face to face with a Tony Stark that wore the kind of smile on his face that undoubtedly spelled trouble. He leaned back against his bike and looked at Steve over his sunglasses, and Steve just sighed and stared at him in what was supposed to be exasperation, but probably ended up looking more like excited curiosity.
Steve watched him a little curiously as Tony looked down at his shoes and then huffed out what sounded like a self-deprecating laugh. When he looked up and turned to face Steve again, Steve caught a flash of dark around his opposite cheekbone. “Did you get in a fight?” He asked before he could stop himself.
“Actually, Mr. Rhodes, you will not need to worry about that,” JARVIS spoke up from the coffee table, and Rhodey turned in surprise, a smile breaking out on his otherwise strained face. “Sir took the time to download my program onto this hard-drive before leaving the premises. Although I appreciate the concern.” There was a small pause. “I truly would have hated to remain there without Sir.”
