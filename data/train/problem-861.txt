Wanting to whirl about in glee, Sherlock settled for darting down to bestow a kiss, right onto John’s cheek.  The soldier looked startled but not disgusted and his hand rose to cup the skin as though it were a wound to coddle.
“…Sherlock?” John ventured, gaze settled determinedly on the burn scars marring the man’s pale neck instead of—well, elsewhere.
“I can’t protect you from this,” Mycroft said, the clipped words echoing off the tile in 221b’s small kitchen.  “I’ve tried too many times already and they are suspicious of my motives.  They want you bound to the Summer Court.”
Days later, Sherlock finds a little velvet box in the trash.  There are two rings inside, one of burnished gold and one of cold iron.  Sherlock puts the iron ring on his finger until it burns a scar onto the pale flesh.  He wants the reminder.
It was difficult to stand there across from John Watson, watching the straight back and set shoulders of the man broadcast his anxiety and anguish.  John Watson was a practical man.  He wouldn’t throw a fit just because the British government saw fit to cart away his best friend.  He would meet the enemy like a soldier, even if the enemy happened to be a rather luxurious private plane to Eastern Europe.  He couldn’t quite look at it though, nor could he quite look at Sherlock.  Instead, he shifted nervously, as though searching for something just out of grasp.
A gout of flame suddenly roasted the slop to John’s right and what he’d thought was a mound of garbage shifted and growled.
The dragon slapped its tail into the mud, sending a splash of it into the air where it promptly got flamed into ashes.  John got the distinct impressive that the dragon would’ve been rolling its eyes at him if it could.
And so he watched the trap unfold, dreading the moment it would snap shut.  Yet he had not counted on John Watson.  The very effect of John Watson on Sherlock was astounding.  Sherlock, who had been interested by mortals but never cared for them.  Sherlock, who had been enticed at first by Moriarty’s cruelty but then repelled by it, simply because it focused for an instant on John Watson.  Sherlock, who had flown to Mycroft’s door with Moriarty’s blood on his face, pleading for a way to save John Watson from notice as Mycroft’s minions quietly cleaned up the mess on St. Bart’s roof.
*No.* It reluctantly agreed.  *Not your kind.  You’ve strong moral principles, I can see.  Very well, John Watson.  If you’ve not come here to taunt me, they could you perhaps do me a favour?*
Ah, and now John was looking adorably confused.  He should have that expression put on a t-shirt, splashed across his chest like a protective talisman.
So he let it go and resolved to teach Rosie how to say “Shezza” as soon as those pesky front teeth came in.  Would serve him right.
“It mightn’t be so bad.  Irene is a match for your intelligence at least and of all the Seelie queens she is said to be the most beautiful.”
John wanted to mutter into the folds of Sherlock’s dressing gown.  He laughed instead, pulling back once Rosie began to fuss about not being the center of both men’s attention for a record thirty seconds.
“I don’t.  But Clara does, and I could use the brownie points.  She’s still a bit miffed at me for the whole night’s watch incident last week.”
If he fled, right now, into the plane he could leave without seeing this.  Without breaking his own heart with the sound of John’s voice.  But he couldn’t make himself let go.
When he limped back to 221b Baker Street, Sherlock was already there, violin in hand playing the most enchantingly joyful melody that John had ever heard.
There was simply nothing better than watching Sherlock’s cheeks warm and flush after John’s managed to fluster him with something.  He waited patiently for the other man to process this bit of suggestiveness, busying himself with making tea one-handed with Rosie on his hip.  She tried to help out by knocking the sugar bowl over with her foot and then attempting to stuff a dry teabag in her mouth.
Besides.  If he was to be useless now, at least he could do one last good thing with his life and protect a creature who was wondrous and brilliant and who deserved to be free.
*There are certain compounds available at the market that can dull the senses.  Powders and tinctures made by the same kinds of wizards that chained me.  It would be ironic indeed to seek comfort from their potions, but they are effective.  Those who keep me here have used them before to subdue me while conducting repairs on the aqueduct.  If you could get some for me I will repay you.*
John rubbed at the sudden twinge in his shoulder and leaned against the stall, convinced now that the entire outing had been a terrible idea.  He was on edge, self-conscious and taking it out on his sister.  Harry might be foolish and short-sighted but it didn’t give him the right to snap at her, especially on a subject as sensitive as Clara.  At least Harry had attempted to have a relationship.  She’d built a life for herself in Pandathaway.  What did John have, besides a dodgy leg and a useless sword arm?
*Yes, I am a dragon.  And you are John Watson.  And this the ground.  Are all humans this stupid or are you more dimwitted than most?”
“Oh for God’s sake, find me some pants then, if they’re so important.  But be quick about it.  They’re going to notice that the sewage is building up eventually.”
The last time John brought up the fact that Rosie wouldn’t be able to pronounce silent consonants until her front teeth came in a little more Sherlock had glared at him witheringly and told Rosie that she was to ignore
"Coming!"  John said, moving hastily to catch up.  It was only when he reached the other man that he realized that he wasn't limping at all, and hadn't been since he made the decision to step into the dragon's prison.
“Vanished in the ether for many years.”  Sherlock placed a cautious hand on John’s shoulder.  “Likely you never knew her at all.  She was an imposter for as long as she knew you.”
“How can I pass up the chance to take tea with my two favourite people?” he said as he hefted Rosie out of her chair and into his arms, bouncing her up and down in time with her giggling.  “Although I will be taking my nap later.  As will this one.”
The dragon tilted its head back to show the golden circlet around its neck and the chained links leading down into the basin, clamped firmly to the ground.  It didn’t look nearly strong enough to hold a dragon.
There was a pause and then the nausea vanished, leaving John to gasp and wipe his sleeve across his mouth, the smell suddenly muted to something bearable instead of the overwhelming stink it had been.  The dragon’s eyes pinned him in place, shifting in colour before seeming to settle into pale blue.
Sherlock roared, tossing its head and flapping its wings twice before rising into the air, sludge dripping off of the scales to reveal a long, sleekly scaled form.  John thought for an instant that the dragon would immediately fly off, eager to be away from the site of its captivity for so many years, but Sherlock hovered in the air for a few minutes before sending a stream of flame directly at John.
In the kitchen he could hear the glass slides clink under Sherlock’s microscope and the intermittent banging of his daughter’s crayons against the table of her high chair once she got bored of colouring with them.  The noises were familiar but hushed as much as a two-year old and Sherlock Holmes could manage for John’s ‘unwinding time’.  A few months prior, John used to invite Mrs. Hudson up to babysit or bundle Rosie off to Molly’s for a while so he could have an hour or so to himself without chasing a toddler around but Sherlock had gone over all stroppy one afternoon when he’d watched John try to wrestle a fussy Rosie into her coat and declared that he could certainly manage to watch her long enough for John to go have a pint or read the paper or whatever other dull thing he needed to do.  And so John’s ‘unwinding time’ somehow also became Sherlock-and-Rosie’s bonding time.
*Idiot.  Your leg.  It’s psychosomatic.  If your tiny mind would just stop obsessing over how useless you feel then you would be able to walk freely.  I can easily solve that problem.  You aren’t useless, you’ve simply need to find something to do that utilizes your many skills.  You’re clearly acclimatized to danger, you’re meeting a dragon and your hands aren’t shaking at all.  This entire time you’ve been calm when other men would’ve been running away, gibbering in terror.  You’re brave, John.  That’s a very useful skill if you know how to channel it.  You might not be able to take your previous place as Captain of the Guard with that shoulder wound but you’ve not forgotten how to swing a sword or throw a dagger.  Obviously you should concentrate your attentions on finding another position where you can serve and protect.  Perhaps as a personal bodyguard.  I daresay, you’d do pretty well.*
John felt a searing pain around his neck and almost screamed aloud, but the agony was smothered before he could lift his hands to his throat.
John Watson had been a practical child.  When his grandmother told him that the pixies would stop leaving twigs and bits of grass in his shoes if he gave them a gift he didn’t stop to wonder if pixies were real, nor did he dream of capturing one or taking photos with his camera to show Harry.  He simply put a bowl of milk and some bread and honey (he had read that they liked honey especially) on his windowsill and went to sleep confident that tomorrow morning he could slip his feet into his shoes without a nasty surprise.  When he found a coin in his shoe instead he didn’t accuse his grandmother of planting it there, nor did he decide to repeat the experiment to try and catch the culprit in the act.  Instead he bought himself two licorice whips and felt quite pleased at having solved the problem.
A laugh burst from John’s mouth at the dry sarcasm in the dragon’s delivery and he had to tamp down on a fit of giggles, shoulders shaking with the effort.  The dragon flicked its tail, seeming pleased and somewhat bewildered by John’s amusement.
“To the very best of times,” Sherlock said, sticking out his hand.  John seemed to stare down at the extended fingers for a very long time.  When he finally took hold of them, Sherlock could feel the smoothness of burnished gold against his palm.  A thumb stroked soothingly along the raised ridge of the scar around his finger.
The problem was that Sherlock refused to hide himself, even a little.  His features were too sharp, his eyes too strange, his fingers just a little too long.  He was far too clever, far too rude, and he coaxed sounds out of his violin that weren’t meant to be heard by human ears.  Not human ears that wished to stay attached to their heads, that is.
A shrill whistling cuts through the quiet and John can hear Sherlock’s muttered curse before the noise cuts off sharply.  Luckily, Rosie’s more into the questioning phase than repeating what everyone says [“And a good thing too, with the rate you swear around her,” Sherlock had snapped when John teasingly brought up the idea of a swear jar for him.  “I’m hardly the one to worry about in that regard.”] and John waits for the little voice to pipe up, right on cue.
*Your wizards captured me when I was but an egg and when I was old enough to make flame they brought me here and chained me.*
Mary Morstan was a changeling.  Sherlock knew it from the start but he did not know why she was a changeling until she had put an iron bullet in his abdomen.  Iron in the gut would have killed him, did kill him, except that there was John not knowing that Mary was a changeling and if Sherlock died then no one would be there to tell him.  And Sherlock could not let John be devoured by a changeling.
“Yes, nap.  You’ll be cranky by supper if you don’t and I can only handle one sleep-deprived toddler in this house at a time.”  John turned to glance at Sherlock, looking the man up and down with a smirk twitching the corners of his lips.  “Come to think of it, you should have a lie in too.  You didn’t come to bed at all last night and we’ve nothing on.”
The information rained down on him like hailstones, pummeling him with the pain of the arrow thumping into bone and muscle, the sound of Harry’s slurred accusations as he bailed her out of the squalid little cell she’d been sent to sober up in, the scent of Clara’s perfume when she hugged him goodbye.  Dizzy, John stumbled forward and leaned on the fencing that separated the dragon and the sewage basin surrounding it from the rest of the space.
“Stubborn as your father,” Sherlock said, and he sounded so fond that John couldn’t stand to fake sleep any longer.
Shoulders relaxing as the crowd thinned a little, John watched Harry heft a jeweled necklace in her hand and hold it up to the light, as if to inspect the quality of the gems.  He wasn’t sure what good that would do, as neither of them would be able to tell a real emerald from a magicked piece of cut glass.
“That’s settled then.  We’ll have our tea and you can finish up with the lichens, seeing as Rosie’s interested in the result.”  Or at least her scribbles were of the green variety and could very well look like a poisonous lichen if you squinted.  “And then it’s a lie-down for all of us.”
John shouted internally, but it was too late.  He was hit in an instant with the memory of sitting in filth, the stench and the sensation causing him to immediately double over and deposit the contents of his stomach into the dirt at his feet.
John Watson was a practical soldier.  When reports came in about the witch woman with the crippled hand he consoled the Afghan soldier who had outright refused to go into her hovel, even on strict orders to oust all civilians from the buildings.  He went in himself and when the old woman raised her twisted fingers to curse him, he offered her medicine for her arthritis.
Despite the rudimentary skill with language, John’s writing was earnest and his focus pure.  His blog was ridiculous and full of enough romanticism to give Keats a run for his money and every post ended in what might as well have been talisman:
“Ah,” Sherlock said, though the wrinkle of his brow suggested that this perhaps was one of those sentiment things he couldn’t be expected to put up with.  Which was when John decided that he needed, absolutely needed to hug the man before he could say some other ridiculous thing.  It was worth the awkward poke of a test-tube against his chest to see Sherlock’s face go slack in shock and then feel his arms awkwardly slide around John’s back in a loose hold, as if he’s not quite sure what to do with them.
John hesitated upon touching the chain, remembering the pain that had echoed in his head and through his nerve endings as the dragon transmitted its memories to him of trying to break the chain.  But John was human and the wizards that captured the dragon weren’t expecting a human to care enough to mess with the city’s sewage system.
They ran, why, well, Jack was sure it had something to do wih JJ's protective nature. He had seen it in action with Maxy Fallen. He was positive they had something going but hey, he wasn't going to say anything. Angry JJ could make a dinosaur piss himself.
"You're like a middle school girl, oh my gosh!" He was laughing, unable to stop himself. "Tony and Loki sitting in a tre-"
From the center of the group, Sherlock and Tony heard a small voice say, "I told you not to do anything to him. I'm okay. Really." They kept walking but Tony reached out and caught the boy's wrist after his state of shock had worn off, pulling him face to face.
Things were incredibly awkward in Government class, not only because he usually ditched, but because he could feel Sherlock's eyes boring into his head ever since he had been told. He hadn't figured it out on his own, alarmingly, and Greg couldn't help but worried that he'd blown this whole thing by acting too soon.
Speaking of which, Thor spotted that one boy that roomed with Loki, JJ Harrison, running toward them.
"It's not an insult Dean, you came here because ever since your mom died in that fire he's been beating you guys up, that's why you came here, to get Sam away from that, and you know if you go back, he'll come with you and that sick cycle will begin all over again. I can't see you go back to him and I can't see you become him. You're too good for that."
She swerved around at the familiar voice to see Loki standing in the doorway to their room. And then she realized she was shirtless. In front of her roommate. Shit.
"I missed the sign up date. JJ is more punctual than I," she explained,  waving away Loki's explanation. Dean was drawn to her unnaturally blue eyes, heightened by her make-up.
"Are you going to introduce me to your friend?" Now that Tony was close enough, he could see the girl's startlingly blue eyes, similar to someone's, but Tony couldn't place whose.
Loki all but scampered over to the counter, pulled out two glasses and poured the drinks, and Tony found himself staring at the tight skinny-jeans and the place where the boy’s shirt rose and left some near-white exposed skin. He shot his eyes away as Loki returned to the table with the beverages. The last thing he needed was to embarrass this newfound friend with unwelcome advances.
/Don't be stupid, John. That's too mundane for Sherlock./ Oh great, now he even knew what Sherlock considered mundane. That wasn't weird, right? They were sort of friends. Right?
The chorus struck Tony hard, weaving the words /And I want to remember this night, and how my words never came out right, it's just my patience that keeps me alive, just like all those pretty lights, all those pretty lights in the sky/. He felt there was a meaning, something that was striking him hard. Maybe the words to the song meant something to his dance partner that he should know.
Just so y'all know, like JJ and Maxy, Cry and the other characters from his 'verse that will be appearing later in the story are original characters. They were created by me (littleblackneko, though JJ is a creation of TwoMoonsLite). He and his related characters are from the novel I am writing and hope to publish in the future so it would be GREATLY, GREATLY appreciated if you do not steal them or take credit for them. Like seriously. Mine. Dibs, Sorry for seeming overprotective, but the novel is a majorly huge deal to me. These are my babies so please respect that, and if anyone sees the thievery of these characters, please let me know because they mean a whole heck of a lot to me and I do intend to publish them, so until, hopefully, that dream comes true, do not write with Cry, Max, and Kat. I'm sure none of you lovelies would but I'm really worried about it, so I figured I'd mention it here. Ta darlings, and I hope you all enjoy this chapter of Fandom High/
"I didn't have support, John. I know you might think I'm a badass of badassery but I used to be...... teased. No one stood up for me. Not even my family, John. Now do you see?"
When she got close to her dorm, River noticed that music was playing. Exactly her type of music. Someone was also singing, quite well in her opinion. She cautiously pushed open the door and closed it behind her. Her roommate, Maxine, came dancing out of the bedroom. She was the source of the melody.
JJ was silent when the director, Peter Bishop, called the class to attention. Silent when he asked if anyone knew where their first trumpet, Tony Stark was. Silent despite all the begging looks Dean gave him over their equipment.
"Oi, Smith!" Matt turned to face Gean. "When you get a chance, let your brothers know I need Harkness."
"WHAT KIND OF FRESH HELL IS THIS!" Loki shouted as he dived to the side to avoid being impaled by the purple foam ball that almost made contact with his face. The teachers had set up this weird, twisted baseball/kickball/dodgeball game, all of which Loki had always been inadequate at. The rules had all swirled around in his head along with his utter hatred for gym class, and so he was merely doing his best to not fall victim to impalement or concussion or unconsciousness.
"No, John Watson is one of the..... more.... moral people here, albeit ordinary and therefore, dull."
It seemed only plausible, given the fact that all the impossibilities were happening. For example, he was still attending school, which must be a forthcoming sign of the apocalypse. He assumed they were keeping him around to fight off the end-of-days monsters.
Maxy Fallen took no crap (a side effect of being best friends with a badass like Gean). She was one of the two girls in Outdoor Ed, and as smart as the likes of Tony Stark or Sherlock Holmes. She was meek, sure, but she could defend herself. Which was why she was flipping out to herself. She knew Gean would do something stupid, possibly confront Sherlock. But that would put her in danger of someone less trustworthy knowing. So Maxy had no choice. She diverted Gean away from following  Sherlock to Geometry and took her to the next class, which they also shared.
"Lokes," she pulled him against her shoulder, rubbing the small of his back with her hand, "That sucks. You shouldn't have to deal with any of that, don't let it get to you, you're great."
"No!" He didn't know to whom Gabe was referring, his ex or his unattainable crush, but he really wasn't in the mood to discuss either.
Step two...... what was step two? Flirt? Seduce her? Something of that nature. He would worry about that when he got to it. He was only decent at plans anyway.
"Castiel Novak. Would you please tell your brother and his boyfriend to leave me alone?" Spock had somehow migrated over to the group, followed by his asshole buddy Kirk. Dean knew his fair share of douches, but that guy took the pie.
Thor thought he heard his mother's voice, and then she was at his side, pulling him towards Loki and his friend. "Thor Odinson, if you ever say anything like that to Loki, I will kill you myself."
"Professor Holmes tested my fluency and said I should sit with you two," Loki came up and sat next to Sherlock. "Today has just been the worst day, but at least I have a solo this coming concert."
Loki and JJ followed his sight to two boys talking in hushed tones. One, the one John was staring at, was obscenely tall with curly black hair. Not bad looking, Loki noted.
Cas shoots out an arm and grabs onto Gabe, preventing him from leaving. "No," his voice is little more than a hoarse breath.
He understood that JJ would have prejudiced her against him, but he thought she'd at least act interested! No, instead he'd gotten shoved off with little more than an insult thrown his way. It was unprecedented.
"Contrary to your belief, not everyone enjoys your really creepy advances," the boy JJ grumbled from where he slumped against the couch.
"Oh come off it, grumpy pants. I need you to take this," he motioned his head towards Loki, "to class with you. Mythology, right?"
Tony hadn't had much interaction with JJ mono-y-mono, but he had seen the boy punch the shit out of Jim Kirk for hitting on a friend. The bloody nose alone was enough to scare the shit out of him. Needless to say, while he respected JJ to a fault, Tony couldn't help but draw a parallel. Where he used sarcasm and wit to protect the things he loved, JJ used brute force and threats. Which begged the question, why did he latch on to Loki so soon?
Tony shrugged. "I have no idea how. Mostly he just sits around thinking. I think he's bullshitting me."
"I have a question...Has something happened to Dean? He's being very brooding at he isn't usually like that towards me."
After an hour of wallowing in despair, she was starved, so she figured she might as well go fix up something. Of course, when she got to the kitchen there was, of course another participant in the forever alone club. Stark was perched on a stool with tomato soup. After the events of the night, that really wasn't the kind of person she'd been wanting for company. There were no reassurances tonight, it was only a week in to the school year, and already there was so much trouble.
"JJ, right?" The boy was dressed in some of the flashiest clothes she had ever seen, bright neon pink skinny jeans and a purple sequined hoodie, and behind him, there was bleary-eyed kid with hair in his eyes who was leaning against him.
"He found out this summer that, in accordance to his moving away, he was adopted to this family because no one else would take him, likely there was a love affair overseas, and that he should feel lucky he wasn't dead, his fathers words, no love lost there.   Feeling powerless and useless, he tries to sever all ties but upon seeing someone who is not truly family yet acts as if they are makes him feel even more rejected and useless, so in conclusion, you said secrets deserve to be hidden and it sounded like you were brushing away his pain as pointless because of your bloody daddy issues. Not to mention he fancies you."
He drew his fingers up to his neck, noting that yes, indeed, his pulse was racing furiously. Cas knelt on the ground, curling up on his bed, breathing heavily. It wasn't going away, and it was starting to hurt. This wasn't rational, and so many thoughts bombarded him, mainly the thought that it was wrongwrongwrong to feel like this, even though it wasn't rational truth, he couldn't help but feel all the horrible memories that came with it. Dean was staying, and that was /so good/, but it still meant that every day would be spent feeling like this and it was getting much harder. He managed to gain his composure a bit, being able to control his breathing even though his heart was hammering and he was sweltering hot, there was no fixing this. There was nothing but this overwhelming desire and self-hate for being so terribly stupid.
He offered his hand out, and Loki slowly reached up and took it, "Thank you very much," he said softly, trying to find his voice, "I'm Loki Odinson."
She nearly bowled over the mid-sized Smith, John, in her hurry. She shouted some sort of apology but kept running. Those brightly colored pants came into view.
How could it have gotten so bad as this? Not only did he have to deal with him in gym, but now Tony Stark was in his Government class as well?
As the period was ending, JJ whispered in his ear, ”I don’t know what you did Stark, but he didn't even bring a book with him this morning. "
Tony watched as Loki and some dark-haired girl danced around to the horrible-quality music her phone was playing. Tony had earlier admitted that she was pretty enough, but Loki never looked better.
"Which thing? The number of people on campus with one eye or the fact that our friend is holding hands with that gunk-ball Moriarty."
"Um just... Dean, is fine. So why haven't I seen you around here before? I would have to guess the genius would run in the family." He took her hand and pressed a kiss to the top. Cas gave him a quizzical eyebrow arch. Whatever, girls thought that kind of thing was charming.
"You're buckets of fun," Loki said sarcastically. "I should go before JJ freaks out again. Honestly, its like he's my mother."
/Yeah, he has this thing where he latches on to people. It's hard to get out after that. Not that I'd want to, but still, JJ is a protector by nature./
"Damn it Dean, you can't get into anymore fights, it's a death wish! Do you know how close you are to getting kicked out?" JJ was whisper-yelling at him intently, each word punctuated by the strike of her mallet. "You can't do this to me, you can't do this to Sam. I know it's what you saw, but being either drunk or violent or both is not what you should do. This sick idolatry of that bastard needs to stop-"
"It's his aura was just... Ugh, I'm sorry I'm being such a dick, Stark, it's just been a bad night."
"Yeah, I'm fine, I'm me, besides not making a thing will get me in JJ's good graces and that can't hurt." It was odd for Bruce, in a way, to see Tony so relaxed, at ease, and naturally happy in this setting. Usually, unless he was behind a work bench or in a lab, Tony was constantly on edge with the world. It could only lead Bruce to conclude that something or someone was capturing Tony's attention and drawing out good vibes.
"Oh yeah," Cry yanked him forward, "This is my boyfriend Maxie!" Cry was beaming, while Max just looked  disgruntled, "He's just being a tired crab right now, don't worry about it."
"Nothing important," he responded gruffly, "He thinks that his brother Castiel and I are involved in some secret love affair. That's just how Gabriel's mind works."
JJ gave Loki a sideways look. "Breakfast is at 6. I was going to head down early so I can get some decent grub," he waved a hand lazily towards the bathroom, "He'll be at least another half-hour. Coming?"
"I can assure that I am nothing worth worrying about. I just simply cannot handle situations appropriately, as I have been told countless times. You may all go now. It was nice to meet you, but I must leave. Don't blame the boy, he doesn't know what he did. I just can't handle this all. I came here to get away and yet he still follows like I'm worth his time and I can't deal with it, okay. Let go of me, JJ."
Dean broke out into a smile and closed the distance between them. Castiel definitely did NOT panic. His friend threw his arms around him in a hug, squeezing the life out of Cas and causing more than a few trench coat buttons to dig into his skin. No words were said, but none had to be.
"No, forget I said that, there's not enough evidence, probably wrong, I usually get one thing or another wrong." He saw a group pass by, all glaring at Stark. Likely those that had chased after the runaway.
"I think I'm JJ fucking Harrison and I think you're a fucking asshole. Come on now Lokes, I need your help and I'm done with his shit." Thor watched as JJ grabbed his brother's hand and started pulling him towards the dorms. His mother was glaring at his father who was sporting a look of disgust.
Halfway through class, she presented her findings and conclusions. At the same time, Sherlock Holmes reached the same conclusion, his evidence smacking against Maxy's on the top of the desk.
John did. He really did. It was the reason he had tried out for the school's military training program. He had a sister at home, older, but she and their father needed a strong force to stop their drinking.
Of course in a mythology class, having a name in direct relation to Norse Myth doesn't quite dictate blending in, especially since he was more like the legend than he cared to reveal at the moment. But he did let everyone have a good-natured laugh about it. He was used to it. His pseudo-family were all mythologically named, so it was in his nature to play along and subconsciously plot revenge. Thankfully, he was saved by the looming presence, Castiel. He was easily identified by Dean's description as he had spent the first half of class looking like he wasn't sure he was in the right place. Castiel was an anglo-Christian angel name. Maybe not quite as bad as "Loki" but at least there was shield that was much more blunt in his awkwardness. Mr. Bishop seemed quite into his lesson, not even noticing or at least not caring, when seats were changed around so that Dean was by Cas and the boy he'd introduced as his brother, Sam. Though he did take casual notes, Loki was left mainly to observe the trio. There was something there that they weren't realizing and he couldn't quite put his finger on it
"I won't say anything. It's not a big deal to me really, it's just who you are. And since you're the first person I told, I would appreciate if..."
Tony was alarmed at the kid's red-stained eyes. "I'm sorry," he said to Loki, "Really, I didn't mean to hurt you, okay?"
"I just don't understand," the swollen-eyed boy told her, "Why do you even want me around? I shouldn't even exist."
"God, why do we even trust him with our food. Honestly! That man'll hump anything with a heart beat within fifty miles!" JJ was still complaining from the bathroom.
It was free period, so Sherlock and Tony were using it, like they had last year when Sherlock was merely a prospective student, to get their things and get to class before anyone, so they were on their way to the dorm room where the instruments were currently.
She walked back to the dorms with head bowed and hands clasped behind her back. If she could somehow separate Jim and Gabe, then they could.....
He thought he heard footsteps in the hall, shouting and laughing. Class must have just ended. That's right, he and JJ skipped Calculus to figure this out. That means it was lunch, or free period. And here Castiel was, having a panic attack on his bedroom floor. He wasn't crying. Yet.
Now Thor had reached his limit, "And you wonder why he doesn't feel a part of this family anymore, father, it's because of you." He then, surprising himself, stormed off.
"So, um," Gabriel whispered next to him as they walked toward the band room, "Are you going to tell me what happened or what? Are you being harassed again? Is it-"
"Oh, trust me, I've heard all about you, Kirk. I was quite fond of the tale of when JJ punched you in the face for being an ass."
"PROBLEMS?" JJ raged out, an unmistakably Jack hair-gel bottle in hand, "Dean's /problem/ is that the little shit doesn't appreciate that I'm trying not to get him expelled! I've dealt with Fury before, that man eats a shitload of nails for breakfast."
Jack, a handsome boy even by extreme standards, looked up from his suitcase on one side of the room.
“I get it. I’ve got younger siblings myself, but my brother lives in Australia and I think my youngest sister is in a jungle somewhere, studying tree moss or bacteria or some such thing.” Douglas states. “I’m curious, though, either of the others fly?”
“I was watching your performance before everything went belly up, and when you were standing out there with your eyes closed and your arms out, all I could think was ‘that’s someone I’d really like to get to know,’ and I can tell you it’s never quite happened for me like that before, either.” Douglas’ voice softens a bit at the end.
John smiles and waits patiently for his daughter to run out of steam. She’s so much like her father and therefore there is absolutely
and it was all…too much. The second sting of misery as he fought to close his Shield down as tightly as possible; the desire to
“She’s told me nothing,” he grudgingly mutters instead. The complete absence of any telling data at all is difficult enough to explain without adding her smug pronouncement from earlier to the mix. He flat out refuses to tell her she’s right.
The satiated sigh he receives as gratitude almost completely undoes him, almost makes him crawl right back over Sherlock’s body and forgo the cleaning routine. Instead, he opens a drawer on his way out of the bedroom and tosses an old pair of pajama bottoms in Sherlock’s direction, knowing he’s just going to drop them over the side of the bed.
“The good doctor seems a bit, ah, uninterested in your conclusions tonight, dear brother.” Mycroft gracefully takes Sherlock’s chair, picking at invisible lint on his camel trousers.
It is exactly the forty-eighth hour, almost to the second, when Sherlock Holmes goes to his knees next to the hospital bed containing his life, his sun, his north star and begins to weep silently, for the first time in his life absolutely regretting a decision he made in the heat of the moment that has brought about the devastation before him.
After dinner, the four of them go back to their room in order to allow Sophie some downtime with her dads before she goes to bed. John and Mrs. Hudson are playing cribbage at the coffee table, John in the floor and Mrs. Hudson on the sofa while Sherlock and Sophie are opposite them with a huge book about aircraft open between them.
“I’m not sure if I could be a full-time pilot, but I appreciate the offer,” Martin states as the question derails his thoughts for a moment. It was always his dream to fly, and if he loses his position with Triple W, he may be in serious need.
John decides pretending to read an upside-down book is pointless and drops it to the floor. He grins down at Sherlock who is quickly unzipping his fly now that the doctor’s full attention is on the detective. Long fingers deftly wind their way through two layers of fabric and denim-clad hips buck gently upwards into those dexterous digits.
John stares at his phone wondering what has gotten into him. The dark screen seems to be making a mockery of the confusion swirling through his mind. He hasn’t seen Sherlock or had a case of his own in over a week, which has left entirely too much time to think. Shifting his weight on the hard park bench where he’s been the past half hour, John has to admit that those few hours he’s been at Sherlock’s side over the past weeks have felt so…well…something. That’s hard enough to admit, there’s no way he’s supplying any more descriptions for it.
John could easily be offended, but there’s no point in it really, especially when he agrees with Sherlock’s assessment. “Well, then…” he starts just as Sherlock clears his throat.
Sherlock curves his arms beneath John’s back and pulls him slightly, causing John to groan and tighten his legs until they are so caught up in the feeling of Sherlock inside John’s body that they are no longer kissing. John’s hands are buried in Sherlock’s hair, holding Sherlock’s face tightly against his neck. One or both of them is crooning soft words of endearment up until Sherlock’s hips stutter and the feeling of him spilling over is enough to push John towards his own climax.
“Hurry up daddy, I wanna’ go watch some more planes!” Sophie announces as she lets go Sherlock’s arm and drops to the bed on her back before she slides forward so that she is draped over the foot of it, holding her hands out towards her uncle.
“Sherlock!” John calls as he rushes down the steps in the detective’s wake. He’s hurriedly thrown on some clothes, only stopping long enough to make sure he was reasonably decent with the majority of any offending skin covered—one part of his body in particular. He barges through the outside door, leaving it swinging on its hinges, but his mind is too preoccupied at the moment to spare it a second thought as he is forced to stop and blink against the brightness.
In the buttery light from John’s lamp, a smile with a hint of warmth around the edges dances on Sherlock’s lips as the doorbell goes off downstairs as if on cue. “I’ve already thought of that.”
“So, what none of yous going even try? Doesn’t matter, I’ll take you down,” the Were drops his gaze onto John then to the Cat, “…then I’m gonna crush
Molly stares at him in his disheveled state then casts a look back at the bodies waiting for her. She’s already ascertained one is a natural death by cardiac arrest and the other is a ninety-four year old man who was found dead in his bed last night. Neither are pressing cases when a man she’s known for years to be one of the most dapper, put-together people on the face of the planet shows up at eight o’clock in the morning looking like he’s been run through a grinder.
John takes a sip of his coffee, winces and sets the cup out of the way. He rests his elbows on the table then laces his fingers together and offers what he hopes is a relatively benign expression in Sherlock’s direction.
“Shut up, House.” Wilson steps closer to the door, completely ignoring the older man sticking his tongue out at his back. He holds out a hand in the direction of both gentlemen. The shorter of the two takes it and gives it a firm, sturdy shake.
Sherlock feels the tug of what must be pride swell in his chest and grins back at her, pleased at the unsaid compliment. And to think, that after all this time, he thought only John could make him feel that way.
Calm as ever, Sherlock answers, “He knows nothing about the case other than the general gossip around this place. He’s been busy working on the aircraft you were just groping to be paying more than scant attention to much else.”
Captain steps towards the box, hands outstretched as if afraid to touch it, bushy mustache bristling. He jerks back in surprise when the box mutters and mumbles and shakes. Lestrade looks over at John, horrified that there is someone in the box. John glances around the lab, trying to decide the best tool to use to crack open the box without harming the person (who, like all of them, he really thinks is our missing Monk) inside it.
John finishes his mental face palm and offers his hand for Douglas to shake, “London. You sure you don’t recognize me?”
; besides his anger should be enough to tell the detective that he does not want to talk about this.
He’s almost through the kitchen doorway when Sherlock’s voice makes him stop. “You didn’t ask me about Mister Norton, John.”
John frowns now, replaying the last thing he said and counting the words. “Honey?” he asks, incredulous.
In the comfortable silences that fall into the natural rhythm of their conversation about the case, John picks out the soft susurrus of Sherlock’s coat swishing gently against the backs of his legs, the easy tap of their shoes on the pavement, and even more importantly, the contented, vibrant hum of their Link. It’s all made easy because there aren’t many other people around tonight, most choosing to stay in where it’s warm.
Mycroft pauses, patiently waiting for an answer; when nothing is forthcoming, he adds, “Sherlock, I wonder if you know that cats are considered to be the one animal to domesticate itself. What is so very interesting about this is that the progenitor of the moggie, the wild cats of Africa and the Middle East
House has had enough. He takes a deep breath and braces his arms on the sides of his desk. There’s not a single person in this office right now that cannot see that some scathing retort is coming out of his mouth. They all brace themselves (except Sally, she’s been filleted by Sherlock so many times over the years that she’s pretty numb to dumb shit like this.) So, like the great grey dragon that he is, he opens said mouth…
“Don’t care.” Sherlock intones, now miraculously folding and draping all six feet of himself over the chair so that his feet hang off one arm, his shoulders against the other, and one hand over the back off the chair, the fingers on the other resting against the carpet.
him say it. House smirks but says nothing, choosing to stay behind his desk at the moment (or until something
“The matter has been dealt with,” Mycroft informs them, his eyes never leaving John’s. He doesn’t even need to hear the words he’s sure John has spoken because they are written clearly in every line on his face, the tension in is spine and the new scuff on the toe of his right shoe. “Your help is appreciated more than you are aware.”
To John, it’s just a muggy night in an airport, he is getting nothing from the shadows of the various buildings spread out around them. His nose feels a bit clogged so he sniffs and tries to ignore it as Sherlock pivots on the ball of his foot and goes still.
“What the hell?” Mr. Thompson asks from the bed. He’s thinking that the next time he breaks a toe, he’s going to splint the damned thing himself and be done with it. Weird enough that one doctor is looking at him like he’s a bug under glass, but to have this tall, skinny man with the crazy hair doing it, too?
John continues to stand there and stare as if the sitting room of the flat is some great work of art that he’s never before laid eyes on. Maybe it is, though, maybe he really believed that this time he wouldn’t ever be coming back to it. Maybe this is some alternate universe where he truly gets a happy ending.
John wants to help. Instead of touching him, however, he holds out both hands. “Go on. Change. I’ll take you home.” He opens his channels wide, allowing Sherlock to See.
Anya shakes her head, her eyes, like her brother’s, blazing with intelligence. John is comforted by this more than a little. Though he is no psychiatrist, he can clearly see the inner strength Sherlock mentioned earlier. She parts her lips, swipes at them with her tongue and seems to make up her mind about something.
“Molly, you need to have Simon fired. I cannot work with him,” Sherlock drawls as if his word is law as he takes a step backwards, pulling off the latex gloves.
. The thought of her being frightened of him because of that fills him with more emotion than he can name, though rage is at the top of the list.
He hesitates for a moment, considering the odd blankness that seemed to exist around the Osprey and the Eagle Owl that appeared out of nowhere, apparently a shifter dues et machina.
There’s another collective head nod and the scrape of a chair being moved as House joins the rest at the table. He intentionally stands on John’s other side so as not to get between him and the detective.
“Sherlock.” Martha states evenly, keeping herself rooted where she stands. Part of her wants to rail at him while the other part wants to hold him close like the son he’s come to be. He continues to stare at her; she knows he is sizing her up, deducing everything she’s done in the past three days. Then his eyes narrow when he takes in the bakery bag and he frowns, curious.
A loud crack of sound forces its way through the heavy shadows that wander listlessly down the lane from the bed and breakfast a few hours before the sun decides to peep over the horizon. It is not a gunshot; close enough though that John’s body reacts and he flies upward from his former prone position, heart thumping, head and hands at the ready to protect his mate from any danger.
“John, go to the security headquarters or whatever these Americans call it and find Lestrade.” Sherlock orders when they catch up with him.
John carefully adjusts her until she is holding on to his neck and lying with her belly against his back. The puffy arm bands she’s wearing will help keep her buoyant, but he still plans on being very careful. He slowly stretches out and kicks a little. She giggles.
His brother’s svelte Mindvoice interrupts Sherlock more surely than if someone would have shouted and he rocks backwards on the coffee table, almost falling off of it. He scrambles for a hand hold and opens his eyes, blinking in shock at his brother.
The Owl does not reply, only blinks once more at them and, dramatically spreading his wings, pulls himself skyward. John watches him and thinks that there’s something familiar about the bird.
She paused in her pacing and leaned down, "JJ Harrison, friend. Pleased to meet you, Felipe-who-likes-to-be-called-Cry."
Then again, most people rubbed her the wrong way, due to her secret. So far, the people who knew stood at a whopping 2.5: Maxy, her mom, and maybe possibly Sherlock Holmes. She /really/ hoped Sherlock didn't know. The kid was a total gossip.
"Of course, silly, I could tell from the moment I saw you that you were a girl. Like, crossdressing, been there, done that."
"Hey! At least this way you have a free soil sample for forensics!" Gean yelled, smiling just as they caught up to the next slowest person.
"Then figure it out on your own, Novak!" He growled lowly, so that Mr. Francis wouldn't hear them. He only had to make it to lunch and then her could see that cute little freshman he was rooming with. Oh. And JJ. Yeah, his best friend was important too.
"Well, jeeze, when ya say it that way, I sound like a dude who likes long walks on the beach and coffee in bed." Tony laughed off his discomfort at having his core exposed in front of Loki. Said hot-definitely-a-man raised an eyebrow at him, but did not question it.
"OH FOR GOD'S SAKE!" Gean shoved Cas out of the way, "would you at least act like your best friend is about to be expelled?" She turned back to Cry. "We have to prove that John Winchester is a bad dad."
The three returned to where JJ, Jack, Maxy and John were sitting, and settled down. Tony was vivified with how animated the table was, what with Jack’s overwhelming perviness, JJ’s tough but fun exterior, and John’s warm pleasantness. Loki, of course, was his primary focus, as the boy engaged him in every single possible topic. Despite the fact that Tony knew he had only gotten a few hours’ sleep due to the fact that he had been woken up by a certain roommate playing his violin at three AM, he was certainly not feeling tired as they conversed. Loki’s friends looked a bit surprised for some reason, and one glance at Sherlock made it obvious he was uncomfortable. But of course. He had ended up sitting right next to his boy-wonder crush John Watson. And as for Tony, he was next to his crush, too. The difference is that he hadn’t spent a year pining over the boy like Sherlock denied tooth and nail he had while he was a prospective eighth grade student.  Instead, he was somehow letting things progress naturally. Right now they were entering friendship, and maybe someday they could have it be something else. Maybe. He wasn't going to get his hopes up that the stunning specimen of Loki would be going that way, let alone interested. As Loki continued talking with great enthusiasm, Tony repeated in his head /It’s just a stupid little crush, that’s all it is, a silly crush./ It was a lie and Tony knew that, but it was keeping Tony from admitting that he would end up hurting him, that he had a whole ton of baggage that no one needed to deal with, let alone someone with their own problems. Plus, the kid was under protection of some of the mightiest people in the school.
He glares at it, snorts and offers his hand to the person in the trunk. Captain steps forward to offer his assistance then freezes as the man unfolds from the depths of the box that could have easily been his coffin.
Sherlock watches his brother leave, inwardly acknowledging how much he’d love to learn to move so silently the way Mycroft does. He studies this for ten seconds or so, coming to the conclusion that Mycroft must have some sort of device in his shoes before tuning back into Mummy’s litany of what a good boy he is.
Sherlock turns to the side a little, offering a larger target, thinking John wants to rest his head on Sherlock’s shoulder, however, the movement is awkward and they end up stopping each other when their foreheads tap. Sherlock stares into John’s eyes and John gazes right back; neither man speaks or makes any sounds until Sherlock hears the sirens. The weight of something new, something naked, something so old unfolding right there in the minute bit of distance that still exists between them; like dandelion fluff, it gracefully glides away when the detective is forced to speak.
As soon as he’s gone, Mike regards John quietly. “Aye, that Holmes, he is really something. How is it you’ve not heard of him?”
completely inebriated with his third? Or maybe it’s his fourth? Glass of wine. Every time he’s looked around tonight at his
John studies her expression for a moment, taking in the way her bright hair contrasts markedly with her olive and sun-kissed skin, the faint line of freckles that runs over her nose and across both cheeks. He wants to tell her she’s beautiful again, but somehow that seems to be not enough this time. Instead of being insulted that she didn’t let him in when they first began…whatever this thing is between them…he is proud that she trusts him enough to share her secret with him now.
“No, it is ash, you are correct. There was a terrible fire here seven years ago. As horrible as it was, it could have been worse.”
Sherlock looks at Victor’s hand, then back at his muscular chest and swallows, his throat suddenly gone dry. He tilts his head to the side, considering and finally holds out his own hand. Victor grabs it and pumps it vigorously, an action that causes the flaccid member between his legs to bounce in time.
Right now, though, he’s got his eyes set on an enormous plate of steaming spaghetti with sauce and oh God, are those meatballs? How the hell…? In all honesty, it’s probably better not to know, since he’s fully aware of how many ‘trades’ have been going on around and off camp for weeks to set this night up. Totally worth ignoring the occasional disappearance of odd things like tongue depressors or a case of extra-large latex gloves for this. He’s fairly certain that the garlicky, tomato-y, buttery aroma of the dish will be etched in his memory in times to come, especially the next time he’s standing in line in the mess tent.
Martin tries to move only to find that his hands are tied behind his back and he is lying on his side on a very hard, very cold floor. His right leg is painfully numb, but it hurts too badly for it to just be from having it bent beneath him. Something is not right. Martin shuts his eyes again as a fresh jolt of pain screeches up into his thigh and he makes an aborted attempted to grab at his knee. The result is that he simply pulls at his back and cries out in agony.
“Just call me Mable, Mr. Holmes,” she gets out between gasping sobs, choosing to ignore the fact that she’s already told him the same thing twice.
Sherlock steps out of the darkness to raise his phone above where John is trying to check for injuries. John thanks him and is able to make out a single small laceration. There’s quite a bit of bruising, but the wound is clean and already scabbed over. Probably wasn’t even enough to knock the tall man out, but there is no doubt it hurts like the dickens.
Sighing wearily, John tugs the EVP machine he usually has with him out of his front pocket. He’s starting to think it’s broken because it hasn’t worked properly for him since that morning at Edwina Norton’s house. The idea of the Norton residence only causes further irritation in his mind.
“Yes, you must be Miss Sophie,” Sherrinford says as he offers her his hand. Her tiny one virtually disappears.
John stares at Sherlock; somewhere in the back of his mind dances the idea that they are always destined to end up in situations like this one. Martin stares at the little open door as he slowly backs away from the aircraft.
Now, I’ve forgotten how to use language, any of them. I know Thomas is talking to me but I cannot answer back. It’s almost like I don’t understand any of his words, like they are coming through to me from a very long way away. The only thing more incomprehensible is the way he stretches out beside me in this smelly bed; he must not be a very tall man because his body is only a bit larger than my own. I worry when he puts his arms around me and pulls me in close to him. He never takes off his clothes. I hope they aren’t hurting him, too.
Is that little smirk actually a grin? John shakes his head. “Well, maybe ten years ago, but no thanks.” He brushes his knees off, giving his brain time to catch up. Best to ask the most important questin first. “What the hell was that thing, anyway?”
Sherlock has moved into the corner, where he stands observing them all. From the bed, Christopher greets the couple while John offers his chair so that they might sit together.
In the mix of heavy shadows, a beam of bright light from outside falls across the floor like an arrow, leading them to a lumpy object they both make to be a body. John crosses to it quickly and drops to his knees. The person is lying on their face, but the too-big and rumpled flight suit is unmistakable. Like the first body, this one is also female, John notes as he turns her smoothly to her back.
Sherlock shakes his head carefully so as not to dislodge John’s hands. He narrows his eyes. “Are we ready to talk about this?”
plans in the first place...Mycroft opens his eyes, ice blue now to match the dying light outside his window. It is fruitless to worry about plans already burned to ash. He pinches the bridge of his nose with his right hand and presses a button on a telephone on his desk with the left.
In the lift, House congratulates himself for the well-placed jibe. If anything is going to get under Sherlock’s vampire-like skin, that will. He grins evilly and turns to face the wall, hoping John doesn’t see the nasty expression that is warping his features.
The engine makes a strange stuttering sound and Martin looks to see Roderick slumped against the side of his seat. They are already only about four hundred feet off the ground and that number is shrinking fast. Without thinking, Martin moves across the wing and drops into the empty passenger seat where he grabs the stick and tries to even the plane out enough to land safely. He can hear the faltering sounds of the ground crew attempting to contact Roderick, but Martin doesn’t dare let go the stick to grab the headset from Roderick’s helmet. Right now it is more important to get this plane landed without taking out himself or anyone else.
By the time he gets to tell John his story, Sherlock Holmes is well known for the powers of his mind. Sherlock at age fifteen was not much different, though he’d just discovered his ability to shapeshift and the idea completely obsessed him. Unlike other families Sherlock knew of, the Holmes were unembarrassed by their many Were and Shifter relatives and actively encouraged the practice in their sons. Of their parents, only Daddy Holmes is a shifter, a rather docile-appearing white Bengal Tiger with thick fur and a heavy belly, though his brother is a stately Buzzard and their grandmother a sleek black leopard.
Both of them pull up short in order to stare at the rather huge, bulging man standing in the middle of a pile of glass from the back door window. He raises an axe one more time, massive biceps straining against the weight of what is obviously an antique tool and smashes through what was left of the window frame. With this hit, the old door cracks down the middle, staying together enough to remain on its hinges.
“Why are we in the morgue?” he requests gently from the other genius present, doing his level best not to think about the scritchy sound of the mattress beneath his thighs.
“No, Janey, I don’t think it is such a good idea…” Ophelia starts to back out of the doorway, but Jimmy bobs up right behind her, his mouth close to her ear.
“I don’t know, John,” Sherlock grits out prissily between his teeth. “I made a mistake, aren’t I entitled to do just that on occasion, or do you really think of me as a machine?” He frowns into the almost-darkness, brows touching over his nose.
When Sherlock pulls back with a tiny swipe of his tongue to the end of John’s nose, his expression is open.
Greg jogs over to the group, taking in the worried expressions on the faces of the four staff members and the murderous one on Sherlock's face. Greg wordlessly points at the door of John’s room.
Instantly, Sherlock’s expression falls, only where Greg can see it as he brushes by the DI, not in such a rush now, but sure that the other man can hear the blood racing through his arteries. His heart could explode, he could stroke out, he could care less because
God, to be twenty five again. “Night, Dale.” John tells him, rolling his eyes at the ceiling. He rolls his shoulders, wincing at the stiffness from being idle settling in. Locking the front door and slipping the key back under the mat, he decides to walk for a little while in hopes that the exercise will work some of the kinks out of his back. It’s a decent night, anyway, a little cool and damp but not enough to deter him.
There’s a loud thud in the dusty silence of the empty office building, a screech, then a high-pitched yapping. A low snarl and the big Were howls in pain. John quickly recovers his momentum, dropping to his knees on the brute’s back and yanking his arms above his head.
As John’s sliding their plates onto the table, Sherlock effortlessly drops into his chair and John can’t help but enjoy the sight of disheveled curls begging to be petted and the dressing gown slightly open, showcasing the smooth skin on display. John pulls his own chair out, and, after letting his fingers brush over the nape of Sherlock’s neck, sets to replacing all the calories he’s lost traipsing all over London the past few days. Sherlock eats the majority of his breakfast, then disappears into the sitting room.
John shakes his head to the negative. “No, not sure why she thought kidnapping Adrian Monk was going to get to me.”
John is beginning to think he’s losing his mind. Never before has he experienced so much spirit activity and it’s starting to take its toll on him. He's mentally exhausted; maybe this is why Sherlock can be so churlish on occasion. What must it be like, to see this stuff all the time?
The Link between them has grown stronger and today John is shocked to find that for the first time comparing Toby to Sherlock doesn’t feel as if there are knives being shoved into his chest. It’s not as if she would want him to be miserable, surely quite the opposite would be true. Granted, the two shifters couldn’t be much different physically, but their temperaments and even the pull of their animalistic natures are very similar.
Nothing but silence answers. Greg digs around and yanks his phone out of his pocket and composes a text as quickly as his stiff fingers will allow him then takes a deep breath, leans back and shoves his shoulder into the door hard enough to rock it in its hinges. Angry now, and feeling like he's running out of time, he steps backwards two steps and kicks the knob, finally gaining access to the flat when the thing falls off and bounces down the steps.
Martin is by no means unfamiliar with shock. Doing what he does for a living, it’s not the first time he’s experienced it. Of course, considering the things that happened in his younger years…but he doesn’t want to think about those things anymore. What he wants to focus his mind on right now is the fact that his older brother is alive and well. He wonders what the means about the eldest? He’s never been the luckiest person on the planet, and as much as his plane falling out of the sky and Roderick dying hurts...there’s still a little bit around the edges of the situation that feels
Sherlock chuckles, tries to hide it and actually only succeeds in amusing his half-conscious partner. “Yes, John, and it’s on its way here. Come on.”
Sherlock doesn’t say anything else about it and goes about collecting their shoes and socks. He slips into his and waits while John does the same. “Shall we?”
know how the man swallowed that much bloody rope or whatever the hell this is...” Lestrade is as exasperated as the rest of them. He throws his hands up and yanks out a chair.
“We became friends, sort of. More than acquaintances, but not…not like this,” he pauses, gesturing between them with his index finger.
Isn’t she just wonderful? Thinks John as he hightails it after the galloping detective, nodding his head and saying thanks at the same time. Sherlock stays several strides ahead of him, but since it is effectively parting the crowd for him, John holds his speed steady and keeps Sherlock in his sights as he leads them towards the backside of the flight line.
Without warning, everything is bright, colors leeching into one another while the unbiased, disloyal sun drives his sins out of the shadows and drags them, now fully hued, into the harsh light of day.
“I think she will be, yeah.” John agrees, holds open his arms and thinks about being almost metaphorically torn in half between the doctor who wants to remain at vigil for his young patient and the undercover man whose heart is so full that he wants nothing more than to hold his lover close and never let go; hide his head in Sherlock’s shoulder and blank out the cruel injustices of the world.
They don’t speak again until the car pulls to a stop in front of Speedy’s. John gathers the Cat in his arms, cradling paws with extended claws on his palms so that the nice leather of Mycroft’s car doesn’t fall victim to any more territory-marking behavior.
John opens his eyes, startled to see the white Dog with the blue eyes at his feet, pink tongue lolling out of his mouth, broadcasting loud and clear.
He nods to himself, comparing his and John’s lives with Sophie in the mix; the end result is a fair balance, he decides. Sherlock’s eyes narrow at the white plastic cup of some cold beverage in his older brother’s hand. He considers it a welcome distraction as he calculates how long it’s going to take the bead of cold water on the rim to slide down to the bottom of the cup when Mycroft sets it on the table. He stretches his arm across the table in order to catch the water on his fingertip.
“Alright then, after you.” Still unable to take his eyes from Sherlock’s, John stands and pushes his chair in, using one hand to make a sweeping gesture towards the exit. Sherlock shoots him half a grin and follows suit.
“Thank you,” Mycroft tries for politeness, though he does frown and turn his head slightly to the left when Ophelia settles next to him. “I have a case for you.”
Then what, Douglas? He asks himself. What then? He certainly isn’t getting any younger and he is man enough to admit that in his past romances there has never been one that affected him in the instantly visceral way that seeing that waif thin agile little ginger up on the wing of that plane did. The confusing tangle of emotions seems to swing between a great desire to throw himself between Martin and the rest of the world or throw him down and have his way with him in front of the rest of the world.
John shrugs inwardly as Sherlock strides evenly into the sitting room from the loo. He reaches down and gently rolls Sophie into his arms. The little girl sighs and scrunches up her face but does not wake fully. John thinks she’s absolutely beautiful and whispers as much to her as he brushes a soft kiss on her forehead. As he adjusts her in his arms, Sherlock’s expression is calm, open and John can’t help but smile.
They cruise about town for a couple of hours, hands brushing here and there as they walk. Sometimes they are stopped by one of the Homeless Network or even some fan of John’s blog seeking autographs and the annoyingly-named ‘selfies,’ but for the most part the people of London leave them alone. There’s a bit of smiling from acquaintances and a wave here and there; as always, though, they remain in their own little bubble of John-and-Sherlock. It’s relaxing to John, and Sherlock likes a relaxed John, so the whole thing works.
“No, let’s try it this way first. Don’t get up,” John says as Victor makes to stand. After a minute of silence, he continues, “Alright, I’ve got my Shields up. I…Honestly, I’ve not done this with someone I wasn’t at least Linked with in a very long time. It’s going to seem a bit…oh, I don’t know…pushy and intimate, but, please don’t fight it. I’m only going to try this once.”
I apologize for keeping you waiting on this. The fight scene was giving me hell! It is way easier to watch one than to write one, without a doubt!
John stays where he is on the sofa and an overwhelming need to be near him forces Sherlock from his seat and to the cushion next to John. Slowly, he scoots closer until their thighs rest together.
“You’re always saying I should get out more…” Sherlock’s voice abruptly stops, the jocular mood between them instantly drying up into something serious. He curls long fingers around John’s bicep to still him, then points at the steps. “Someone’s up there.”
Sherlock shrugs, accepting that he didn’t understand it then and doesn’t really understand it now. That leads him to the thought that he doesn’t really understand how John can put up with him…but before his mind rushes into a loop, John rests a hand on the top of Sherlock’s thigh, causing his thoughts to come to a complete halt. He looks down at John’s hand and watches as he covers it with his own, then looks back up at John.
“I’ll understand if you want me to leave,” he croaks, staring down at his fingers. His back is bowed and he is so tense that he’s almost hovering above the cushions rather than actually sitting on them.
Sherlock clears his throat. “You don’t have to tell me the next part.” He offers his words like a sacrifice.
Sherlock returns to his former position, thinking that if he can keep this fellow away from the Norton case, perhaps they can find common ground elsewhere. First point: obviously John does not like his job and is probably only putting up with it because he and Stamford are old friends. Second point: when Sherlock is astrally projecting, he cannot move and therefore is stuck only working on a single case a time. Ophelia can only go so far…
John kisses her once more, a gentle press of lips as reassurance as he holds her in his lap. She’s smaller than him, for sure, but almost as muscular, he thinks as she tightens her thighs around his hips. She smells clean and of a rare desert breeze. “Yes?”
Chiding herself at her worries she corrects her thinking and reminds her silly brain that John is not exactly a ‘boy’ when dancing about on this side of forty.
Barkley is standing toe-to-toe with Sherlock now, each man trying to out-intimidate the other. Sherlock is having none of it.
John moves fast, stepping close enough that he’s between the autopsy tables. If he wanted to, Sherlock could reach out and pull John to him in an embrace he would surely fight his way out of.
As he walks, Grant considers the money a little more. Could there be a positive side to this? Well, actually, yes, there could be. Quite possibly Victor decided to do something for Grant’s birthday, but that isn’t for months, really, an age away. Maybe he put down some sort of deposit on a chalet or some other such thing? Granted, their closest neighbor is a small B and B, but Grant can see the allure of leaving home for a little while.
His meandering thoughts grind to a halt instantly as the sound of a slamming door echoes down the hall. He’s immediately on alert, quickly going over his own movements since he’s been in the house. John remembers locking that door, so that leaves two choices: there’s been a break in or Mrs. Norton’s claims that her deceased husband still resides in the house may have some truth to them beyond the ramblings of a lonely eighty year old woman.
Sherlock Answers, as he leaps from the couch and trots to the front door, tail flicking back and forth.
I open my eyes without realizing that I’ve actually closed them at the sound of Mrs. Hudson and John’s voices drifting closer. Mrs. Hudson sits down on the end of her sofa, John takes the chair across from me. Nova gives my chin a tongue bath then turns her attention towards the doctor. She barks lightly and he leans forward in order to scratch behind her ears.
Sherlock regards John for a few heartbeats, then slowly takes the instrument from his shoulder and replaces it in its case. After that, he sort of runs out of steam.
“Yes. There is a bit of weight to it.” Mycroft says carefully, his eyes wider than usual. “Ophelia, hello.”
Stretches, he’s glad to find that he didn’t tip over and fall out of the chair this time. Frowning at the window then the front door of the small house his parents lived in prior to their deaths, it suddenly occurs to him that he’s alone. One day they’re going to have to do an experiment and find out just how far Ophelia can travel without him.
so badly to simply take all that is on offer. For a moment he reflects on the ridiculous notion of sex being stupid that he had when he was younger; there's more important things to discuss at the moment, however, no matter the opinion of the lower half of his body.
(Good lord, my life is utterly insane. Not quite Sherlock-insane, but some days are pretty darn close. One day ask me about the customer who came in and made himself at home in my office and
Somehow he manages to keep himself upright and not blurt out how much he detests being called ‘mister.’ Clearing his throat, he tries for a bit of levity, “Mr. Holmes, I presume?”
“My boys, you both try so hard to fit in. I know. We can’t control what others do, though, remember that.”
John pads towards the huge pool, his feet making a hollow echo against the shiny tiles. Sophie stops her splashing in the shallow end to wave at him. Sherlock is standing up from the water opposite her, his fringe plastered to his forehead from where he’s just popped his head back up. Water streams down his face onto which is currently plastered his ‘deduction mask.’ John shakes his head, cutting his eyes towards Sophie. He really doesn’t want to have to tell Sherlock that he doesn’t want to talk about this.
John can hardly take his eyes off his daughter, as she is looking more and more a perfectly feminine version of her father every day; he wholeheartedly agrees with Greg’s chosen adjective to describe her. “Yeah, go on you lot. Papa and I will be down shortly.”
Sherlock nods, gets to his feet and before John can count to three, is at once naked then gone. The black cat with the green eyes sits down on his haunches and regards John coolly. John laughs and reaches out in order to trace the outside of a velvety ear.
I think about this while his arms are around me. The old blanket with the holes in it separates us. My nightgown is the same and not very warm; I long to tell him how thankful I am for his body heat though he never gets under the blanket with me.
John clears his throat. “Sherlock, look here,” he says as he holds an x-ray of one of her feet up to the light box on the wall. He points at several odd, ridged areas. “See the metatarsals here?” The detective nods.
John thinks it probably physically hurt Sherlock to admit that, but one look at his face tells him he’s wrong.
“Like Papa’s, but not,” Sophie deduces. She looks over her shoulder at Sherlock. He sees what she wants and leans down without being asked. Sophie gently springs one of the ebony curls with one hand and does the same to Martin’s. She laughs and pulls a bit too hard on both of their heads.
Sherlock sits up against the headboard then reaches out a drags the plastic satchel towards him. He deftly tucks down the mouse tails poking out of it and grins his lopsided grin at Victor as he snaps the bag closed. “Come on, you said ‘anything for you,’ remember?”
Finally, having at least said the words and gotten them off his chest, Sherlock’s mind grows calm and he sleeps. Just as he drops off into a blissful unconsciousness, John’s eyes snap open, bright blue in the new gold of the morning light, and he smiles and thinks,
If nothing else, he knows he’s good at adapting to changing situations. He squares his shoulders and does his best to shrug the past off. He is on holiday, and Moriarty is dead, …no reason he shouldn’t enjoy some time in the pool with his partner and their daughter. He takes another breath and repeats it: Moriarty is dead.
Sherlock inhales, preparing to wait all day if that’s what it takes to get John to tell him what’s wrong. He wants to go home and put this behind them. The idea of home seems to get through to John, who relaxes a little more into the sofa. Sherlock copies him, leaning back in the chair but does not take his hands off the desk.
“No, John,” Sherlock moves fast when he so desires and he is perched on the arm of John’s chair, his mouth pressed against John’s, before John can even take a breath to complete his sentence.
For an instant, John pulls back, shaking his head, golden eyelashes frosted with moisture. Sherlock only goes away as far as he can still touch John, his eyes widening as John reaches down and pulls at the hem of his jumper, somehow succeeding in pulling it off his body while never losing contact with the other man. Then they are kissing again, tugging at one another, John on the edge of the sofa, Sherlock on his knees between John’s thighs.
Another bird, this time an equally enormous Eagle Owl barrels into the Osprey, causing it to drop like a bomb towards the hard ground. The two birds scream and hiss at one another as they roll, sharp beaks tearing at throats and feathers flying everywhere. John takes refuge in the tree, climbing as close as he dares to the tiny limbs where Sherlock is now stretched out, green eyes taking in the entire scene below them.
As always, John doesn’t bother even asking what they’re doing there, instead trusting that his personal mad genius has some plan relating to the meeting from this morning.
“I’m happy,” he tells her. Sophie plops herself down in his lap as there’s a quick knock at the door.
Sherlock frowns, taken aback. Behind Mummy, Mycroft mirrors the sentiment. He can’t help but be quite disturbed how apparently Mummy has missed the fact that Sherlock was the one doing the ‘advancing.’
He lurches sideways as the paramedic grabs his hand and pulls. Sherlock snarls just as the wingwalker’s eyes open and he can see the beginning of recognition in them.
John doesn’t even know he’s not breathing until Sherlock is less than a foot away from him, eyes locked with John’s. A new voice intrudes into his thoughts, diverting his attention from the viciously lovely vision in front of him. It is almost physically painful to turn away.
As the day turns brighter, a darting blur of movement draws his attention to the pavement. Sitting neatly between the toes of his slippers is a tawny dormouse, its shiny, oval-shaped eyes regarding him steadily. Watching the little animal causes some of the grief-ridden fog in John’s mind to dissipate. Now he can feel the bite of the cold metal against his bum, the ache in his feet and his shoulder. As if a switch has been flicked on, the sounds of the slowly waking city around him filter through the night’s lassitude. Something in the back of his mind rustles quietly, oddly he thinks of it the way a butterfly wing would sound as it slowly unravels if he were capable of hearing it.
Douglas laughs. “No, Carolyn, I’ll be on my best behavior. Hopefully it will wrap up soon and I get home.”
“Well, I’m sure Sherrinford wouldn’t ask you unless he felt you’re up to it.” John answers, feeling rather paternal at the moment.
John can easily picture smoke rings in his mind but he’s sort of stuck on ‘my dear.’ Once again, he decides to leave it for the time being. “Right,” he agrees. “A Demonic Entity isn’t a corporeal spirit.”
