Still, he'd made so much progress. He'd been so shy at first, so hesitant to let go with Mark, and now, here he was, in the middle of the work day, moments away from having Mark over his desk.
They'd agreed to each write their own. Mark cleared his throat, and grinned cheekily. "John." He squeezed John's hands, and gazed into his eyes. John felt it: that Mark believed he owned him now. "We both know that I'm the best thing that could possibly have happened to you."
John stumbled, legs collapsing. He sat down hard on the kitchen floor, where he slumped, and covered his mouth with his hands. He let himself fall apart, let his total frustration and grief and anger carry him away, burn him up until there was nothing left.
As he pulled on a fresh pair of jeans and buttoned his shirt, he found his eyes drifting to the cover of the book Mark was reading: Donna Tartt's
"It's all right," John told him, when it was anything but. He took a deep breath.
The woman had been quoted in the paper: "Mr. Holmes told me that family is trouble, and I should avoid adding to their number, if I could at all help it."
John was blind, in the harsh glare of the fluorescent lights. He wanted, desperately, to go back, to take it all back. To crawl back into the tunnel and never emerge again.
only wanted one thing.
Sherlock studied him. "You have a life now. A future. With Mark. You should go. Be safe." Carefully, he put the poker down on the desk. He folded his hands behind his back, and watched John, his gaze steady, his head held high.
He followed Mark out onto the street, where the thick noise of Saturday afternoon traffic engulfed them.
Without a second look, he collected his clothes for the evening, and left the coat room, turning the light off behind him.
gun, the one he'd left at Baker Street. Proof that Sherlock was here, somewhere nearby. It was heavy and firm, a reassuring presence. He had a chance, if it came down to a standoff.
He could end this tonight, if he was smart. All he needed, all he'd been holding out for, was to understand the shape of the threat against him and Sherlock. Mark had already eliminated much of it. If John could get some sense of who was left in the network, and how invested they were in the plan to destroy Sherlock, they might finally be free.
"Sherlock texted me. Let me know what was going on, terrorist threat, and all that. He told me to get in touch with Greg. Once it was clear that it was all managed, and it was safe, they let me come wait for you. Got to knock off work a bit early, too."
"He followed her? But he came back first," John said.
John didn't recognise the pale, scruffy man who had shuffled up behind him in a tattered knit jumper and jogging pants. "Sorry?"
"I think we both left purity behind a long time ago." The difference between them was, that John had found his again. It was there, in the way that he felt about Sherlock, a flame that burned brightly inside him, even now.
John closed his eyes. It would be easy, to follow the drift of Mark's conversation, to think about anything besides what had happened earlier today. "You're saying I should be some kind of fixer?" He laughed at the idea. "A vigilante? Not really my style."
"I'm going through with the wedding today, because I think I have to, because we're both in a lot of danger, but I don't want this. It's only for our protection, because—" he took a deep breath, and lowered his voice— "Mark is one of them. He's part of the group who's been after you since you got back."
John supposed, as he finished fluffing the pillows, and putting them in their places, that there was always a first time for everything. Mark said he'd gotten in late. Maybe he'd only pulled the blanket over himself. Maybe he had been careful about the way he'd slid under the sheets, not wanting to disturb John.
"Listen to me. Sherlock, please, just listen." He squeezed Sherlock's hand again, and took a step closer.
"John!"
"Next time," Mark said, "I will."
Mark held up his glass. "Cheers. Only one for me, though," he said, taking a sip. "Driving us home tonight. After." He fixed John with a steady, even look.
Oh God. Sherlock.
"Use your Mind Palace."
"Whoa there, Doctor Watson. Let's sit you down again."
Jacob Sowersby:
Sherlock looked like a man who'd been stricken, some unnameable horror stopping his speech. His mouth was open, a little, his brow, knitted. Then, slowly, he nodded.
"Yup. But you're going to have to keep it quiet. It's a bit sensitive. Involves the wedding. No one can know but you three, Harry here, and Sherlock. Okay?" George and Vince had crowded around, listening, curious about what John had to say.
John watched as Sherlock opened his trousers, and slid them down over his hips, his cock half hard in his silky boxers, which he pushed down as well. He pulled his socks off last, then stood, unclothed, and watched John, head down, eyes coy under his lashes, as if this were his first time. It might well be: John hadn't asked. He hadn't wanted to make things strange between them, and it didn't matter, because it was their first, the most important night of John's life, and the best thing he'd ever done, besides taking a bullet for Sherlock.
John had to wonder what was in it for Mark, standing by John's side all these months, while John mourned for Sherlock, while he failed to sort himself out. It couldn't have been fun. John had never managed to be a good partner. He couldn't imagine what would motivate Mark to stick with him, especially now that Sherlock was back.
The thought tore him open from the inside, and he slid all the way to the floor, onto his knees, as he felt, powerfully, the consequences of everything that had happened to him, and all of his decisions. He buried his face against Sherlock's knees, and Sherlock said his name, and a sob wracked him.
"You. Adrenaline. The war you never left. You know, you're lucky I found you. This is your chance to change to a better supplier. You're not going to believe what I can do for you." Mark's hand traveled up John's shoulder, and caressed the side of his neck, rubbing on the sensitive spot he knew John liked.
And that was Mark all over: steady, secure, always willing to give John as much space as he needed, but there, when John wanted him.
His mind spun through a thousand possibilities, a thousand cruel and thoughtless reasons why Sherlock would ask this particular question, but hope settled him on one explanation, that could, perhaps, mean everything. Maybe Sherlock hadn't responded to John's advances because he'd been just as paralysed as John had been, before. Maybe he hadn't accepted John, because he couldn't. Not then. Not yet.
"Course." Mark smiled, his expression soft, his voice quiet. "I asked them to hold our order at the front. I'll go collect it and get the car, yeah?"
Sherlock, it seemed, could still completely surprise him. Not by sweeping in and taking him by storm, but through letting him go, giving him over to what he seemed to imagine would make John happy. John smiled fondly, as he rubbed his fingers through his hair, and thought about Sherlock's arms around him, Sherlock's cheek coming to rest on the top of his head, as they'd held each other on Baker Street. As if anything except Sherlock could ever make John happy.
He managed to say goodbye, get down onto the street, and hail a cab, without making too much of a fool of himself. Once the cab had pulled away from the kerb, he took out his phone. He didn't know what he was doing. Making a mistake, probably.
From ten minutes ago:
"I'm glad. Never was much for parties."
"Since we met. I think I read your whole blog after we went out for drinks, that first time. You're amazing, you know?"
The ellipsis indicated that Sherlock was typing something more.
A sinking feeling rolled through him, like he was in an elevator, the cables of which had been suddenly cut. He took a deep breath, and let it out slowly.
After the Landmark.
, he thought. They could enjoy the show, or not. He kissed Mark's lips, and pressed their bodies together, his skin tingling, his heart light.
"So that's him," Mark said. Not to John, it seemed, but to the room in general.
"I'm not the one—" John closed his eyes. He was losing control of his temper, practically yelling. He lowered his voice, and leaned in. "Look, you know this bothers me. You and him, thick as thieves, going behind my back."
After a few moments, he heard voices in the distance.
John stared at him. There was something terrible brewing in his soul, some deep sense that he'd been treated unfairly.
He tried not to stare at her, knowing that she was another one of Sherlock's homeless network. Hope, and love, and a whole host of feelings he'd begun to doubt he would feel again, ran through him.
. John held very still, trying not to react. He'd wanted this, wanted badly to talk about himself, just like this, so many times, he couldn't quite believe it was happening. His chest clenched, and then everything expanded, his spirit rallying after weeks of thinking he would never feel anything again. He was ready for this, he realised. Beyond ready.
John's heart was warm in his chest, his love for Sherlock spilling out into the space between them. "It's all right, Sherlock. I know you turned off the bomb. I know you solved it. You always do." He reached for Sherlock's hand.
He drank water, then made himself a strong cup of tea, and downed it. He was still loose-limbed, a bit fuzzy around the edges of his thought, but he was no longer wavering on his feet. Definitely in the beginning stages of sobering up. Just in time.
John held up the present he'd brought, the book, in its covering of bright paper. "For you." He moved to the desk, and put it down on the corner.
"The next phase of what?" Sherlock watched her.
"I'm not stupid, John. I know that this is all a bit new for you. You're bound to feel two ways about it. Leaving these people."
He'd thought, after Sherlock died, that the answer was to build something completely different, a safe haven of quiet domesticity. Something he could rely on. He'd tried to sink into this life with Mark. He'd leaned on it, harder than he should have. He'd wanted it to be enough.
"I don't suppose there's any arguing you out of this, so I won't try," Sherlock said.
They giggled at each other, as Mark wiped his mouth with the back of his hand, and John's heart twinged with a small, painful sliver of familiar regret, that he hadn't figured himself out sooner.
People at other tables were staring now, the
"So you decided to be proactive."
Mark made a throaty sound. His eyes fluttered shut for a moment. "Funny little guy, dressed up as you," he breathed. He reached down to cup John.
He thought he was ready, but as he ran a damp mop over the floors in the kitchen and sitting room, he battled with the idea that it was entirely possible that he would not last through two minutes of scrutiny. He wondered if he should have done more research on Mark, while he had the flat to himself. He wondered if it would be wise, or entirely stupid, to go check the security tablet one last time.
An answer, appended on another post-it:
John longed to go to Baker Street, and talk, and make plans. Discuss what had happened. Discuss everything.
"Mm." Mark was watching him carefully, in the dark. His face twitched into a smile, one of his trademark grins. "Not distracted enough." His fingertips slipped along the skin of John's belly.
"It's just a question, John. I don't mean anything by it."
John grinned, his nerves jangling, his whole body needing, wanting. It was a game. It had to be. "Well, think of something." He managed to moderate his voice. He was already in too deep. Desperation rang through him.
He explained, and, when she understood, finally, that he'd met someone, she clapped her hands. "What's his name?"
Sherlock went down on his knees in front of John, and put his hands on John's thighs, holding tightly. John leaned forward, his limbs loose, and touched Sherlock's face.
She deflated a little, and shook her head. "If you were anyone else, I'd have you detained for interfering in my investigation." Her accent was suddenly, shockingly American. "But since I just figured out that this one—" she paused to point her thumb at John— "isn't actually planning to jump careers to a life of crime, I figure you can help me out a bit. We have a few minutes to talk, probably." She took another step into the office, shut the door behind her, and addressed her next comment to John. "When I left, your sister had pulled your new husband aside for what looked like a good long chat."
Sherlock walked beside him, his steps slow and deliberate. "You couldn't tell? If he wanted more?"
When he was almost back home, he deviated from his usual route. He had no reason to be anywhere in particular. He kept riding, as the afternoon gave way to a beautiful evening, the dusky sky crowded with thick clouds that scudded through the deep blue, like so many flat-bottomed boats. Might as well stay out a little while longer.
some deep, secret impulse whispered.
Just like every time John met some friend or other of Sherlock's, he was gently surprised by the amount of love and respect Sherlock managed to inspire. He could be all sharp angles, completely hostile, but when he liked someone, when he genuinely respected them, he seemed to form deep ties that lasted decades.
When he'd requested the song for his wedding, John had thought of this line, this line specifically, because he'd cried to it, standing in his kitchen, Mark upstairs in his bed, as he'd choked down bitterness and thought about Sherlock, about saving Sherlock, on that very first night, with their very first case. Saving himself. He'd imagined, when he'd wanted the song to play at his reception, that he could ask Sherlock to dance with him, just once, just one time.
"That's right! Looks good."
"When I met you, I didn't know who I was, or what I wanted. All that's changed now, and I suppose you could say I've found a purpose I never imagined I would. You've made me more determined than I've ever been, to be true to myself, and who I am." He was speaking, he realised, with some of the intensity he'd used in the kitchen two nights before.
"You're a hero, Sir," the ginger officer told him. "You and Mr. Holmes."
Later, John lingered in the shower before joining Mark in bed. By the time John pulled the covers back, Mark had already fallen asleep. All night, he twitched and dreamed, while John drifted, and woke frequently, ready for a fight, ready to face the day that would see the end of his separation from Sherlock.
John brushed his lips against Mark's, and slipped effortlessly into a deeper kiss, his whole body singing, the loose cotton of Mark's white shirt easy to lift. He slipped a hand up under it and ran his fingertips over the skin just above Mark's waistband, as Mark made a soft, throaty sound, and bit John's lower lip.
"I couldn't let you get married without having at least two different ways to track you. Just in case you got yourself into trouble."
When he spoke, John heard his sense of wonder coming through in his voice. He spoke quietly, a little bit breathless. "Sherlock, where are we?"
Mark parked the van, and hopped out, all high energy and smiles in his red wool coat. "John," he said, as he approached him. "Up so early!" He came over, and took John's arm. "You've gone and soaked your feet, haven't you? You'll get cold, out here with no shoes on."
It was easy, and a mercy, John decided, to let them both off the hook. He leaned back in his chair, and tried on a smile. "Couldn't risk me coming over there, then?"
"How will that help?"
"This world," Sherlock began, his words softening as he spoke, touching the fingers of his free hand to his own lips, his eyes closed. "This world is not much good without you in it, John. I always thought you improved it greatly."
Suddenly Mark was kneeling down in front of him. "You all right, John?"
Sherlock might forgive him, but he wasn't sure he would ever forgive himself.
William laughed a little, and flushed even more, his cheeks glowing bright red. "I just meant—most people who buy that system want to use it to keep tabs on someone. Usually someone close to them."
If he were going to do this, if he were really going to woo Sherlock Holmes, he needed to tread carefully. He couldn't talk to Sherlock about anything, until he'd sorted things out with Mark, until he was free to follow through without guilt, without compromise.
Harry replied:
when it was his turn, and felt his stomach churn as he prepared himself to listen to Mark's vows.
"Well, Doctor Watson," Arthur Davies told him, redirecting the conversation with all the skill of a man who'd spent a long career working with customers, "let's have you start with the trousers and shirt, and we'll go from there."
John sat opposite him, and let him talk, and ate a bit. For the first time since Tuesday, he felt as though he could breathe. The small domestic details of his life were still worth honouring, even if he never got over Sherlock, and everything Sherlock meant to him.
He wanted this, wanted days and days of him and Sherlock, and takeaway dinners, and wine and quiet nights together, after which he would take Sherlock to bed, or Sherlock would take him. He wanted hours spent kissing and making love, and more hours to tell Sherlock how he'd loved him all along, and hadn't known it. He hoped, he hoped, that Sherlock would tell him the same.
John slept.
He looked up and down the street, watching a group of twenty-somethings as they passed him, on their way out for Thursday night drinks, or dinner. The shop nearest to where he was standing was an upscale beauty supply store, the front window featuring an advert for free makeovers. John really hoped that wasn't the intention behind the evening. Then again, he thought, as he pictured Sherlock in eyeliner, a smear of lipstick across his mouth—he could probably be persuaded to try anything.
Still, he'd done so much work in that time. He knew he would deal with the anger, and find a way to let go of it, eventually. Being angry because Sherlock was alive was not nearly so powerful a thing, as being angry because he was dead.
sounds like you still have a commander."
For the next few minutes, John drifted as he listened to the sound of Mark walking back and forth, heavy boots thumping hard on a bare floor. It was best, John decided, if he held still. He certainly couldn't do anything vigorous, couldn't fight, in this moment. He waited, until there was the sound of a door opening a few feet away, and a cold gust of fresh air, and the sound of the door shutting again.
After that, the tablet returned to recording foot traffic in front of the flat. John flipped through the pictures, methodically, still following instinct, still wondering what, exactly, he was looking for. As the record advanced into the early morning hours of November 14, the timestamps between photos grew further apart.
Mark sat up, and nodded. He looked pale, his eyes rimmed with red. "Well, I think I knew that. I mean, I did. I've read the blog."
A couple of hours later, John leaned back in his chair at the kitchen table, the remains of a rudimentary dinner on a plate to his left, laptop screen glowing in the darkened room as he read the case write-up one last time before posting. He wondered what Sherlock would make of it.
Mark tilted his head, his eyes sharp. "And why is that, John?"
There were, however, a few things to sort out, that required his attention, as soon as he was able to give it. The marriage annulment came through immediately, with relatively little fuss. More troublesome was his testimony for the CIA and MI6, as to the precise nature of his relationship with the man who had called himself Mark Morstan.
John ran his fingers through Sherlock's curls, and gazed into his eyes.
John's voice came back to him, and he managed a real shout. "Help!"
Mark's tone hadn't shifted in the slightest. He still sounded as if he were talking about the weather. "From your first case. That cabbie."
The vicar's ancient chair gave a loud squeak of protest as Sherlock turned to face Agent Violet Smith. "So the answer is simple. Since the CIA and MI6 are finally catching up, you should just do your job. Detain Mark now. Interrogate him. Protect us. Isn't that what you people are supposed to do?"
Instead, he felt a minor note of annoyance at the jokey tone, the pet name banter that Mark seemed to think was hilarious, but which John had never quite taken to. Slowly, gingerly, he put the note back down on the table, stood up, and went upstairs.
All at once, he felt as though he were falling down very fast. He leaned against the counter, grateful that he was alone, that there was no one to witness his panic attack, as he waited for the wave of nausea and dizziness to pass.
John stood by the desk, and watched as Sherlock shut the door and leaned on it heavily, as if his parents might decide to come bursting back in. Sherlock watched him, blinking hard, as they listened to the squeaks and groans of the stairs, like a pair of teenagers, waiting for parents to leave, before they really got up to no good. They stood like that, frozen, suspended, until they heard the slam of the street door.
All the poison John had held in his body since stag night passed through him, as Sherlock dissolved into a giggle that shook his whole body. It was the best thing John had ever seen, the best thing he'd ever done, making Sherlock laugh.
"Fascinating fact, John. People rarely do a thorough clean out of their own coat pockets. I slipped a tracking device into his the first night we met. The bonfire."
"Oh, Sherlock brought that for you yesterday. Sort of a gift, he said. He said you would understand." He shuffled around to John's front, and did up the waistcoat buttons, while John stared at his own reflection, and rubbed the watch with his thumb.
John watched Mark's expression carefully. He seemed okay with the situation, moreso than John could have anticipated. And Sherlock, from the sound of things, had worked with Mark, taken Mark along.
John grinned at him. He was proud of himself, proud that Sherlock was letting him take the lead. "It's simple, really. He's got a flash drive, on him, with him, that has the information we need about the people he's working with. There's only a few of them left, or so he tells me. We get the drive, get the information, and we have what we need to resolve this. Turn him and his associates over to the authorities."
"Just on my way out. I wondered if you wanted to do anything special tonight? Go out for dinner? We can stick your bike in the back of the car, drive into town."
John let his head rest against the pillow. He remembered the sense of disappointment he'd felt, seeing Mark at the bonfire.
And then, from Sherlock:
Through the window, he saw that the beekeeper was fussing over the hives near the cottage now. John watched, wanting to bang on the window, draw attention, even as he studied the figure, and recognised that it was almost certainly not Sherlock. The proportions were all off, the shoulders very broad, if stooped, the torso bulky. A man, and probably an old one, given how slowly and methodically he went about his business. Not John's man.
Sherlock stared at him. "I told you. I really don't know how to turn it off."
"It's for us," John told him. "If we manage this, we'll be safe." He could feel Sherlock's breath on his face. He pushed his hand into the curls at Sherlock's temple. Sherlock closed his eyes, and leaned into the touch.
, as he stroked John with a spit-slick palm, which had made John laugh, even as he gasped, and came into Mark's hand.
"Thank us when it's over," John said.
He climbed into bed, and settled against the pillows, limbs heavy, suddenly more tired than he'd ever been.
"Precisely."
He'd had a terrible time trying to decide whether to continue it. He'd only managed to write up some of the old cases after some difficult work with Ella, and time spent letting go of the worst of his grief. He was proud of those entries. Proud of himself, he supposed.
Arthur Davies smiled. "No, Doctor Watson. Sherlock picked these out for you himself. They won't show, except a bit at the shoulders, if you take the coat off. They'll make a lovely accent." He held up a camel-coloured waistcoat, and helped John into it.
Sherlock stood, for a long time, in the middle of his room, watching John, his breath coming heavily, as if he'd just run up the stairs. His fingers fluttered over the top buttons of his shirt, his eyes never leaving John's face, his whole body asking a silent question.
"It's fine, John." Mark's voice was soft. He leaned in, pressing his shoulder against John's, resting his head on John's shoulder. "Take your time."
Mark smirked. "When did you become the practical one? I don't remember signing off on that."
he thought, silently, keeping his words to himself
"John," Sherlock told him. "I want you to know that whatever happens, from now on, I'll always be there for you. Always. I won't leave you again."
"Sherlock," he said, uncertain of what would follow. "Let's not talk about the case. Please? Not tonight."
He took a deep breath, and let it out again slowly, more nervous for what he was about to ask than he had been when he proposed to Mark. "Look, Mark's away for a few days, some sort of bachelor party trip thing."
He took a deep breath and let it out again, remembering the way he'd slept the night after the train carriage, the night the third hit had taken place. He had gone down like a stone, despite everything that had happened with Sherlock, despite the bomb and the fear and the disappointment, despite Mark's promise to make love to him.
"And the wedding doubles as proof of where I stand, and the final step in ruining Sherlock."
"John, who would do this? Try to kill you? Put you in a bonfire?" His voice was soft, a bit shaky.
button. He settled on going through the images manually, one by one.
He had. He did.
John had seen calluses just like Mark's, when he was in the army. The men who had them loved to boast about the extended time they'd spent on target practice. Mark had told John they were from racquet ball. All this time, he'd believed him. All this time, he'd been blind.
"No. I just want to talk to him. It's none of your bother. Don't bother me."
"I know you can hold your liquor, but good Christ John, you might want to slow down," Mark told him, grinning broadly as the two of them danced to
"Sounds good to me," he said, as he stood up again, and wiped his mouth with the back of his hand. "You're off soon, yeah? Stay safe. Never know what Sherlock has planned for you."
Sherlock sat down at the desk. "The drive, John." He held out his hand, and John took the drive out of his pocket, and gave it to him.
They stood that way, while Mark's breath caught, and John's hands wandered. John lost himself in the moment, in the subtle grind of Mark's hips, in the softness of the skin across his lower back, in the taste of the milky tea he'd just drunk, that still lingered on his tongue.
John expected a joke to follow, some terrible comment, to steer the conversation, to take it out of the dangerous emotional territory he'd put it in, but Sherlock remained silent. After a moment, he raised his head, and looked at John, watching him. Waiting for him to talk.
Mark chewed his lower lip, and leaned in, whispering conspiratorially. "I agree I'm the best thing that could have happened to you."
Maybe they'd both been confused. Like John, maybe Sherlock thought he didn't deserve to be loved, to have whatever they could have, between them. The very idea made John long to pull Sherlock into his arms, to offer all the assurances he held in the space of his compact body. A great many. Too many to number.
"Sorry, again. Sorry."
, and point to the table, nodding, saying things. Practical things, no doubt.
The fresh air, and the quiet, enveloped him instantly, making him realise how sweaty he was, how the noise and company had kept him teetering on the edge of panic for the past forty minutes. He closed his eyes as he took the first few steps along the paved walkway that appeared to lead around to the back of the church. The wind kicked up, blowing rain into his face, and tossing the tops of the cedar trees that lined the edge of path.
He hated the tone in his voice, the way he tried to sound affectionate, when he was really suppressing his own desperation to get away. He felt as though it was probably obvious that he was always on the verge of yelling.
"No. I suppose this is the way it's going to be now." John could hear the bitter disappointment in his own voice. He could hardly ask for sympathy from the man he'd nearly cheated on.
He did feel better than he had, though, physically. He got his feet on the floor, and stood, and stretched, enjoying the fact that there was no trace of the dizziness that had dogged him since the early part of November. He wondered if he'd been dealing with some sort of neck strain, from the bonfire, that had perhaps impinged on a nerve. Maybe he'd been fighting some kind of low level virus.
Sometimes John was stuck in the memory of Sherlock's breath, his lips, the sound he'd made in the back of his throat, the way his muscles had loosened as John held him, as if he trusted John, as if he'd wanted what John was doing. When that happened, John's body was wracked with its old, familiar needs, and he had to stop himself from picking up the phone, and he was restless, and he wanted to scream.
"Most likely. Seems he stepped out into the alley behind the pub to shoot up, and wound up a corpse. Do you see? Someone thought they were getting to you. A hit." He frowned.
John stood, his nerves blazing, and picked up his phone, fumbling to check the date on the article again. The body in the park had been found on November 14, in the late morning. He looked back to the image of the man on the tablet, all dressed in black.
John giggled. This was good, just talking. Just being here, in the same room, and joking together. They should just do this, all afternoon. Spend time. Get used to each other again.
Harry was watching him closely. She'd gone pale.
"This is John. You remember, I told you he'd be staying here."
He sat down on the kitchen floor, opened the cupboard under the sink, and began cleaning it out. A simple thing, to focus his mind. By the time he was finished, he'd decluttered the entire kitchen, and it was the middle of the afternoon.
, his heart sick and sore. He put down his phone, put his face in his hands, and cried for the pity of it all.
"It's helping," he told Sherlock. "It is. I'm glad we're doing this. It's nice."
Sherlock had said that, in the train carriage. And yet, everything he'd done made it look like he wanted distance. Everything he'd said. What he hadn't said.
"Arthur Davies is a bespoke tailor and retired spymaster for MI6," Sherlock said, deadpan.
"Murder?"
He looped through neighbourhoods just like his, fingers gripping the handlebars of his bike with more tension than was necessary, the wind blowing cold in his face. Just a short time ago, he'd felt like he was dissolving into normality, becoming one with the bland domesticity of the suburbs. Each house he passed, with its Christmas lights and warm interior glow, represented lives built, families nurtured and cared for.
He said it with such specific emphasis, John couldn't help wondering if he meant something particular by it.
Poetry. A lot more than John needed from a waiter. "Great. I’ll have that one, please."
John leaned in. "I have to tell you something. Come here. Come here!" He waited until Mark leaned close. "You're a liar!" he shouted into Mark's face.
John had to admit he was proud of his people. He'd spoken to them about staggering their timing, making sure they didn't go directly from Sherlock to John, or vice versa.
"You. You've thought of everything, haven't you?" He moved his hand along Mark's length.
"It's good to see you eating."
The intimacy of the moment, coupled with John's understanding of how much it was costing Sherlock emotionally, threatened to undo him. He sniffed, holding back tears.
"It was. About as much fun as I can manage, these days, with two little ones at home."
"He's going to wait until you make your exit," John told Sherlock. "You know, leave the wedding early? And I'm going to seem like I've had too much to drink, and he's going to put me in the car and take me wherever we're supposed to be going. That's right, isn't it?"
"Thank you for the tailor."
"Absolutely. It's been a surprise up until now, and it's going to stay that way, until tomorrow night."
. And not a broken
John felt, as powerfully as if Mark had punched him in the gut, how profoundly he'd underestimated him. "How long have you known?"
"Tell me anyway."
"All right." John fought against the impression that everything that had passed between them had somehow been nullified, even as he still felt the phantom of Sherlock's arms around him, his fingers rubbing the back of his neck. He went to the door of the greenhouse, and touched the handle. "Goodnight, then," he said.
"He was running, um, oh God, what do you call it? A cartel. Got in with a really bad crowd."
"John, George is a veteran too. I was telling him all about you, about the trouble you've had. He understands that you'll be needing some peace and quiet, to recover."
John's heart clenched in his chest. He was suddenly, violently nervous. "He has?" He took a step closer to her, and lowered his voice. "Has he said anything to you?"
The two parts of his life were crashing into each other, in a way he couldn't have anticipated. Well. It was inevitable, he supposed, if he were going to carry on with life with Mark, as he'd planned it, and return to Sherlock's world. Somehow, all the pieces would have to fit together.
The silence stretched itself out, and John remembered the first awkward, tentative conversation the two of them had had, three weeks previous, a few feet away from where he now sat. He'd had so much hope then. He'd been blinded by it, and he'd gone too far. This was his chance to make it better, to allow Sherlock an out, offer him a place in his life that he could, perhaps, be comfortable with.
He looked so alone, and was trying so hard to make everything okay, that John couldn't stand it. He tilted forward, reaching out, looking for any comforting thing he could do. He slipped, losing balance, and his hand landed on Sherlock's knee.
"Isn't there?" Sherlock lifted up a cushion, revealing packets of explosive, wires running in and out of them. "This is the bomb."
"We’re here 'til Saturday, remember," she told him, as he pushed her onto the landing.
Now, he was home, in English woods, and his blood was pouring out on English soil. The weight of all the things he'd had to do lifted from him, along with the subtle haze of words unspoken, of desires partially expressed. What he'd needed to do, he'd done. It would have to be enough.
"I wanted to see a return on my investment. Can't blame me for that." Mark's voice had taken on an edge of upset that John had never heard before. "Months," he said. "Months of patience, of working on him, getting close to him. The worst of it was, yours was still the name he called out, in the night, when he was having one of his dreams. You were still the one he couldn't stop talking about. The change in him, when you came back, like he was a schoolboy with a crush all over again. Pathetic."
"Oh, you assume?"
He took out his phone. No signal.
"How? How is it any different from when Moriarty threatened to blow me up, at the pool? How is it any different from watching you—watching you die?" His voice caught in his throat. He'd lost control of himself, lost control of the conversation.
He still dreamed about Sherlock. The dreams were dank blends of things they'd done and said, mixed up with impressions of their hands moving over each others' bodies, in the dark, in the London streets. They ended, more times than not, with images of Sherlock, his blind, open eyes staring up at the heavens, while his blood leaked out onto the pavement.
Well, it was true. Why shouldn't he have been desperate? His heart had been broken. Sherlock had broken him.
"I know this is important. Your time with him, I mean," Mark said, as if reading John's mind. "I can go, if you want to be alone."
John watched Mark closely, working his way through what he knew about the murky nature of criminal associations. Since he'd come to understand Mark better, to know him as a sort of shark in human form, he'd realised that Mark didn't do anything if it didn't serve him personally. Loyalty to a long dead figurehead seemed to be a wild anomaly in an otherwise completely selfish career.
Everything in the interior compartment seemed to be as it should: seats, corners, ceiling, floor.
Sherlock's eyebrows lifted. "Hm?" The hand that gripped the poker was shaking.
John was shaky with the need to feel something other than the wretched ache in his chest. They both knew exactly what was going to happen. "Doesn't mean I'm not still basically pissed off with you."
of surprise. John pressed in, and kissed them, finally tasting the sweetness of Sherlock's mouth, allowing himself what he'd wanted for so long. Sherlock's lips were soft, exactly like he'd imagined them, and Sherlock's body softened in John's arms. He took another kiss, and another, then pulled away to look at Sherlock.
"Are you sure? Now?" Sherlock's gaze drifted toward the wall.
doctor. Former." He pointed at Sherlock.
John read the text again. A bit strange, that Mark would take the time to look at the blog during his boys' trip out of town, especially first thing in the morning.
He took a step back. He could feel that he was flushed, feel his face growing red. He was very nearly on the verge of embarrassing himself. They hadn't even said hello yet.
"Me? Oh no." Mark laughed. "Tom was the one who shot Olivia."
Mark ran his hand over John's waist, and pressed in to kiss John's neck, his collarbone. "Look, I'm sorry I couldn't get back sooner. It was a travesty. If it helps, I couldn't think about anything except what you wrote to me, the whole way here. You've never said, before." He kissed John's cheek, and took hold of John's hand, and raised his wrist to his lips, and kissed that too.
"Given the fact that you're a target, I thought it best to create the illusion that you were having a normal stag night, while ensuring that you yourself are out of the way. Mike Stamford and Graham Lestrade are currently out at the pub with your sister, along with a member of my homeless network who bears a strong resemblance to you, at least in stature and capacity to consume alcohol."
John went to the table, and sat, feeling as though he needed to be very cautious, very still, for fear of upsetting some balance, or ruining whatever Sherlock had planned. For his part, Sherlock was moving like he was trying not to spill something. John watched as he lifted the folded blanket he'd used as insulation. He poured wine for them, then took a candle from the desk, produced a lighter from his suit jacket pocket, and lit it, placing it on the table between them.
The larger window yielded a much more interesting view of an open field, the sides and far end enclosed by trees. The day was overcast, but the low quality of the light suggested that it was nearly sunset. He'd been out for a long time, then, the better part of a day. No telling how far they'd driven.
He smiled at her a little, remembering how she'd been both keen and accusatory when she'd participated in the case two nights ago.
John tried to imagine Mark being upset enough to shout, the smooth exterior peeling away, to reveal the monster beneath. Tom had gotten to him somehow. Perhaps Mark had tried to persuade Tom to come over to his way of thinking. Perhaps they'd argued about why Mark wouldn't simply kill John, be done with it, and go back to whatever it was he and Tom had been to each other.
John didn't care. He was beyond caring. He had to get this out. He grasped the back of Sherlock's neck, and pulled his head down, pressing their foreheads together. Sherlock's hands hung down by his sides, and he seemed lost.
"The Landmark. Tonight." John said. "We'll have dinner, talk then."
John trailed after Mark, who approached the beekeeper as if he were greeting an old friend. The man slipped his mask off,  revealing an ancient, deeply wrinkled face, framed by thinning white hair and a full, equally white beard. Definitely not Sherlock. He removed his glove, and shook Mark's hand.
John leaned back in the chair, and watched the top buttons of Sherlock's shirt pull and strain, as he took a large mouthful of scotch, watched the line of Sherlock's throat as he swallowed. They talked nonsense—Mrs. Hudson's bridge friends, who Sherlock had taken to joining for games from time to time; John's attempts at bicycle maintenance. The oil heater ticked and popped beside them. At some point, they both took off their shoes.
Something for him to figure out, maybe. A puzzle. John's chest squeezed, full of sudden emotion.
John felt the waistcoat slip down on the left side, weighted by something. In the mirror, his eye caught a flash of gold. A watch and chain, pinned to the pocket. "What's this?"
"Right, right." John pointed at the squash bag in Mark's cubby. "Did you get a game in this morning?"
John stood, no hesitation now, and aimed, and time slowed, and he saw his mistake. His attention drawn by the noise John made, Mark turned toward him, his gun arm swinging around. Then came the high-pitched pop of Mark's gun, the silencer doing its work, and John's leg went out from under him, before he could shoot. He landed in the nettles at the edge of the clearing, barely managing to keep his face clear of them as he fell.
Moriarty was dead, but he'd been the king of a vast criminal empire. John had no proof that the same people were at work in London now, but the nature of the assault on him seemed a bit too specific.
"Hey," John said, grateful for her.
"What's all this?" Mark asked. "Been busy this morning?"
So many reasons. Too many to list. "I don't know." John rubbed his face with his hands.
His promise to Sherlock, his offer to talk, after tomorrow, after Mark returned, haunted him, as he pedaled through the empty holiday streets. He would have to wait, have to put it off, somehow. Let Sherlock assume he'd changed his mind, or pretend he hadn't meant it to sound as important as it was.
He'd contacted Mark then, too. He'd set up this whole thing: the press, here to report on the aversion of the terrorist threat, and Mark, here to pose for pictures with John. To make it clear that the two of them were a couple. That he and Sherlock weren't. To put distance between them, so John would be safe.
In the meantime, he could offer a goodnight, a goodbye. "I'll—" He stopped, unsure of what he wanted to say, wary of making any promises.
Mark swung John around with ease. John felt his feet tangle, but the moment he imagined he might fall, he found himself sitting again, deposited back in the chair. The lights strobed on the dance floor, making him feel heavy with sleep.
John went around the corner to the hallway that led to the loos, but moved past the door to the gents, and out into the cold January night.
Thomas.
Sherlock smiled. "When I was twenty, still in uni, I helped the head gardener with a blackmail case. One of the under gardeners—another man—had set him up, seduced him, and was threatening to mail incriminating photos to his very conservative parents, and the board of directors of the Gardens. He was terrified, you see."
"He's just had a bit too much, nothing wrong at all," Mark was telling someone, talking over John's head.
When he was ready to go, John accepted the suit, zipped into a heavy garment bag, and shook Arthur Davies's crooked hand.
Sherlock sent another picture, a post-mortem photo, also of a bearded man. He'd been shot in the side of the head. His face was distorted by the injury, but he looked very much like the man from the bonfire picture.
A blog update.
He rolled over to find the covers peeled back, and the bed empty. He sat up, listening, for a long while, in the dark, for footsteps, for the sound of the telly turned down low, for some sign that Mark was in the flat.
Before Sherlock was done talking, John was shaking his head. His whole body rebelled against what Sherlock was saying. "No. No. I don't accept that. I've spent the last two years wishing you weren't dead. And now you're here, and I—no."
John didn't answer. He turned away, and started walking for Baker Street.
The watch was broken. Curious. He tried turning the fob the other way. It wouldn't go.
Sherlock's face was white, his body shaking. He kneeled on one of the carriage seats, and squinted out through the window, looking cold, and shrunken, as the first of the police arrived, a bomb disposal team, suited in heavy armour.
"Even if it means pretending we're not friends."
Mark raised John's hand to his lips, and kissed his knuckles.
Sherlock still hadn't looked at him. He raised his eyebrows, contemplating the tea. "Surprisingly okay."
Mark had really banked on keeping him close, keeping him pliant, like he was a patient.
"I need to keep that," John protested, as Mark tugged a t-shirt down over his head, and helped him put his arms through the sleeves. "Arthur Davies made it."
He'd had such vague ideas then.
"Ready."
John reached for the nearest handrail. He gripped it hard, his knuckles white.
Sherlock made a face like he was disgusted by the biscuit options presented to him for his tea. "Less of a romantic gesture."
Mark pulled John in closer, putting his hand on John's waist, then sliding it up, so it rested on John's shoulder blade. John suppressed a shiver.
John watched Sherlock carefully, looking for any sign that he understood what was really going on, that he was covering up any discoveries he'd made, but Sherlock, for his part, seemed a bit lost, watching John with a pleading look.
John sniffed, and laughed. He was furious, he realised. The anger had an edge to it, much sharper than it had in the restaurant, or in the days since. "When could you ever?"
The edge of the counter pressed into John's back. Mark's arms wrapped around John's shoulders, dropping him into a sense that everything was right with the world.
John stared at the phone, his love for Sherlock blazing in his chest, tearing holes in his resolve.
There was something mad, and madly romantic, John thought, about looking for a long lost, never completed, tube station, especially one containing a missing train carriage, primed to explode.
Mark spoke to him, his voice lazy, quiet. "You ever want to give all this up, just get away from it all?"
"Christ," he said. "Stop it. Stop this. Get Sherlock." He reached his hand out toward the bar, blinking in the direction where he'd last seen Sherlock standing.
Sherlock moved into the space Violet had left, and kneeled in front of John, touching the patch, concern moving over his features. John's heart swelled with love, for Sherlock's careful fingers, the softness of him.
He dug around in the shed, and pulled out a small plastic table to use as a work surface. The table was a castoff from some previous tenant, who had perhaps had ideas about breakfasting outside, on the flagstone patio, not realising that the yard was, for the most part, cold and damp.
John nodded, feeling his world realign. Ella was right. Mark was his anchor, part of the new reality he'd built for himself, in Sherlock's absence.
He took his time, waiting for the shock to settle down, for the right words to come. "I suppose I did. I didn't recognise what those feelings were, though. I always—" he hesitated. The conversation was suddenly touching on everything he'd blurted out in the train carriage. He took a deep breath. "For as long as I can remember, I always liked spending time with men more than with women. I thought of those relationships as friendships. Very close friendships. I didn't think they could be anything more."
He'd understood, from Anika's email, that Sherlock was involved with the planning, but he'd never imagined he would go this far. His world tilted as he read a series of post it notes with single questions on them:
"I'll mention that, next time someone's drugging me and stuffing me into a bonfire."
It was time, John decided, to shift the terms of the conversation. To show Sherlock what could happen, when they were alone together. "Stand up."
"Careful now. Wouldn't be appropriate, you seducing me in a hospital." He made the joke out of habit, but it felt flat, a bland repetition of their usual banter. He was tired. He needed sleep, although he didn't want it. He rubbed his thumb over Mark's knuckles. "Why don't you go home? You should get some rest. You have work in the morning."
"He implied he would kill you, if I don't agree to do what he wants me to."
Tonight was a point of highest risk. If John passed through this particular crucible, if he could sell Mark on the idea that he was on Mark's side, he would be that much closer to knowing the truth, that much closer to being with Sherlock.
The notification bar showed that Mark had at least one more unread message: something from Tom.
The ellipsis appeared, and hovered, as Sherlock typed a response. The pause before it arrived seemed endless. John wondered if Sherlock were erasing his own words, retyping, rethinking. When the response came through, it was disappointingly brief.
John looked at the surveillance photograph Sherlock had focused on earlier, which showed a handsome, clean-shaven man dressed in a suit. "I know him, don't I?"
A face from the past; the quality of surprise.
John held his phone in his hand for a minute or two longer, and decided that Sherlock would probably not reply again. He put it down, and studied his laptop. First, he would tackle the blog post.
In the back of the car on the way into town, John sat still for a long while, watching the city lights pass as Gabriel eased them through traffic. He was steeped in the memory of everything that had happened with Sherlock: the warm glow of the candles, and Sherlock leaning in to kiss his cheek; Sherlock's face, serious and soft, as he took the breath that was supposed to carry his confession of love.
It would be better not to try to explain. There was nothing to say, really. Nothing to justify. John's thoughts were his own.
John spared a glance at Sherlock, who had allowed a bit of a smile to move across his lips at Mrs. Hudson's story.
Mark had lied to him. The possible reasons why spun through his mind, too many threads to follow.
Sherlock squeezed John's hand. The edges of the room seemed to go fuzzy, as John fought a wave of nausea. He remembered all the long text exchanges Mark had had with Tom, the occasional fraught phone call. "Tom's fragile," Mark had told John, one night, as the two of them sat on the sofa together, watching a movie. "Sometimes he just needs the support."
John lost his footing as he rounded the corner, and leaned his hand against the damp brick wall of the church, and paused to get his breath.
"Sure." John suspected that the
When Sherlock was all of the way down the hallway, and well out of earshot, she leaned in and grabbed John by the elbow. "What the hell do you think you're doing?"
"Yeah, very bad, more like," John said. "He's the one who's been killing the people who came after me."
He hadn't texted ahead, to let Sherlock know he was coming. Somehow, that would have put too much pressure on the evening. Too official, like he needed an appointment.
The return of his energy was well timed, at least, since he and Mark were busier than ever with all the small details of the wedding—choosing flowers, deciding on a seating plan for the reception, the menu. They sent out formal invitations. Mark made his arrangements with a tailor; John dragged his heels on making his.
John allowed himself a small smile at the vicar's words. More than a bit of blasphemy going on today, too.
He plugged his phone into its charger, and made his way upstairs. He brushed his teeth and flossed, watching himself in the mirror.
Mark pulled back, gripping John's shoulder. "It's just, there are a lot of careless people out there. Crazy ones, too."
Sherlock had been trying, John realised, with everything he had, to solve the puzzle of their relationship. He'd set all of this up, planned a romantic evening, just the two of them, and then said all those things—oblique, tender things—about how John was his first concern. Considering the volume of wine he'd poured into John's glass, John supposed that was part of it, too. Hoping, perhaps, that John would renew everything he'd said on the train carriage. Perhaps he'd imagined John would throw himself at him again, and somehow, this time, it would work out. Somehow, this time, they would both be ready.
"You're a bad liar, John."
"After the wedding," John told him, stepping in close, "you and I, we're going to read that, and have a real talk." He concealed nothing of the rage he felt, nothing of his disdain. It was Mark's native language, after all.
John's chest squeezed painfully. "He might, still. I don't know. But I feel as though there's probably a reason why he didn't get back to me, since I told him about—everything that's happened."
Outside, George took out one of his paper sacks, but instead of pulling out the white cakes and distributing them, like he had with the other bee boxes, he placed it down on the open frame, without opening it. He replaced the lid, and laid his hand on it, looking away, across the distant field, bunched his hand into a fist, and knocked on it three times.
The days had worn on, and the miracle did not manifest, and the tattered, brittle string that tied John to the blinding dazzle of his time with Sherlock grew thinner and thinner. He feared it would snap, one day soon, and he knew that if he didn't find some sort of other life before that happened, there wouldn't be anything left of him. Nothing worth salvaging.
It was difficult for him, John decided. They'd never faced anything like this before.
Everything they'd said yesterday afternoon, on their way to Baker Street, was tender, personal, and private. And now, here was this public travesty. He'd made an utter shambles of everything.
He felt himself break open, felt it all spill out onto the floor, and he couldn't stop himself. "You don't need humanising, Sherlock. You're good. You're a good man."
John smiled at him, and wrestled with the urge to pull Bill into a hug.
"Not a problem," Sherlock said, replying to nothing at all. He stared into the middle distance.
It only took a few seconds. Sherlock blinked down at the floor, and John looked at the clock again. 1:29.
John was all too aware of the knife point he was standing on, knew that Mark's trust could only go so far, but he had to ask, had to know that Sherlock wasn't in any immediate danger. "And that's it. I marry you, and you leave Sherlock alone." He rubbed his thumb over the tip of Mark's cock.
He looked back at Sherlock, who was watching him with sharp attention. Expecting him to comment.
John swiped at his eyes again. "I'm a mess. Sorry."
Another message followed immediately, a police report detailing the discovery of a body at five o'clock in morning, a block and a half away from John's flat, in an alley John had ridden his bike down many times. The victim, unidentified at the time of the report, was a thirty-five year old woman, blonde, dressed in black trousers and jacket. The black cap that she'd been wearing was found several feet away from the body: she'd been shot in the back of the head. An early morning dog walker had discovered her. Estimated time of death was midnight.
The fact was, John was still alive, and Sherlock was, too.
Some movement across the street caught John's eye, as he grappled with himself, trying to find some way to answer Sherlock, because he had to. He must. He tried to speak, unsure of what he would say. "Well, I—"
Sherlock studied John from under the curls that tumbled down over his forehead. "A place I could come where I wouldn't be bothered by anyone. Sometimes I needed to study, run experiments. Sometimes, I needed—" he stopped himself, and waited for John to come to his own conclusion.
"Jesus Christ," Harry said. "See what I mean? She's been gone as long as he has. What do you think that's all about?" She passed John another shot glass full of water.
"A stroke of luck, then?" The idea sat uneasily with John, that things would work out so readily, and with no effort on his part, or Sherlock's.
"That's right. That's right," Mark was saying. "In the old place. We'll use it as home base, like last time. I'll bring him to the main house tonight, when he's awake. Hang on—"
Vulnerable. Frightened.
A hand slipped into his, and squeezed. He sighed heavily. The body beside him radiated warmth, comfort. Basic human companionship. Whatever good John could still receive from the world was here, standing beside him.
, John thought, as he shut the door behind him, and hurried along the path, his feet crunching on the frostbitten ground, his breath sounding ragged in his ears, the naked trees bearing close, silent witness to his pain, to the small triumph of this moment.
John felt cold. All this time, and he hadn't seen it. There'd been a gun in his house. A killer in his bed. He rubbed his face with his hands, as his mind filled with self-accusation and doubt.
"Start your day, yeah." Mark leaned against the doorframe, blocking John's exit. He smiled, head tilted. "Stag night tonight." He said it like it didn't mean anything at all, but he watched John carefully, as if looking for a particular response.
John tried to focus on the music, but it sounded too slow to him, distorted through the sound of blood rushing in his ears. It shifted, even as he listened, changing from something current and upbeat, to an old pop song, a drumbeat, a piano.
A wave of exhaustion crashed over John. His chest grew tight. He wasn't sure who he belonged to any more.
"Excuse me?"
"I'll just go out front, wait where I'm supposed to be," Sherlock said. He squeezed Harry's arm. "Do hurry him along. We can't have him ruining everything."
His heart squeezed painfully at the idea of letting go altogether. He couldn't cut Sherlock out of his life. It would be worth a sacrifice, to keep him in it.
"What?"
"Oi! Shut it. I never said anything like that." He'd only told Bill that Mark would be pissed if he found out John and Sherlock were working tonight.
"Not a chance," Mark said. "We found all of your trackers. That watch. Your suit. Nice work, by the way. Shame to see it gone. And we've left traces of you simply everywhere. We've planted so many red herrings, there's no possible way he could find you. You're all alone here, John. All alone with me."
John managed a garbled thanks at the mention of the blog.
Mark's smile was subtle. "Well, I'm driving later tonight." John watched the floor as Mark put his arm around John's shoulder. The honeymoon plans.
The rest of the afternoon was taken up with sorting things out with the police. The assailant, whose name was Jonathan Small, was all too happy to reveal his plan. He'd intended to stab Bainbridge with the skewer, through his uniform belt, an injury that would cause him to bleed out, after Bainbridge took the belt off.
He'd been a pawn, then, a token of exchange. Collateral damage.
was the one Sherlock had put a name to, the bearded man who'd been at the bonfire: Thomas Baccarin, found dead in a churchyard close to John and Mark's flat.
"I'm shot."
He smiled at her. Had to keep her safe, assure her that it would be okay, even if he wasn't sure it would be. "Be back in a tick," he told her.
Mark had drugged him, had made him sleep so he could go out at night and do whatever it was he did. Probably put something in John's food. He'd been busy in the kitchen, lately, offering to cook much more often than usual.
Sherlock let John go, and took a step back, his hands fluttering in front of him, as if he couldn't decide what to do with them.
On the other side of Mark, Mrs. Hudson was talking, thank Christ. John lifted his gaze to watch her, as Mark's hand slid across his knee, and squeezed. John pressed his palm to it, and held it still.
He was looking at plans for his own wedding. He took a closer look, holding his breath as he read.
Defensive. Stroppy. God, John had missed this, missed him.
He knew he could draw on those same resources now, especially now that he was certain that he was right about Mark, now that he'd seen the tangible proof. The gun was real. It was all real.
"Not really. I read it, and I suppose I wondered about the code. But you know how it is. I thought I was making it up, somehow. So the thing to do, I figured, was to get in touch with you. Thought you'd probably tell me to shove off, interrupting your big reunion with Sherlock."
He poured cereal, stirred yoghurt into the bowl, added a bit of milk, and leaned up against the kitchen counter while he ate. Mark sat at the table, sipping coffee and thumbing through his phone.
"Of course it fits. I'm not a complete idiot."
It would have to be okay, John decided, as he slipped into sleep. Even if it wasn't what he wanted.
The rest of the morning and the first part of the afternoon seemed to go both too quickly and achingly slowly. John couldn't stop thinking about Mark's racquet bag, about the dangerous weapon he had, in all probability, brought to work. On the other hand, he was full of anticipation for tonight's party, knowing that if he could just see Sherlock one more time, everything might somehow be okay. He would, at the very least, be able to remember what he was fighting for.
He watched as Sherlock examined the device, running his hand over it, underneath it. John longed to be under those hands, under those fingers. He thought he would go mad, if he couldn't be.
John swallowed hard against the raw emotion threatening to rise up and choke him. His heart burst into flames in his chest, and he was back, again, in fierce, painful love. It would tear him open, burn him to the ground. He looked up the stairs, and wondered how in the hell he could make himself climb them.
He thought often about his security setup, and the tablet buried under the ground, and wondered what it had recorded, but there was never a time that he was alone in the flat, never a moment when he could unearth it, not without having to explain it all to Mark.
"Go on."
He held back the things he would usually say:
Mark looked up from the clipboard he was holding, with the list of John's afternoon patient appointments. Framed by the doorway of John's office, he looked like the portrait of something fresh and new, his dimples showing, the tilt of his head sharp, precise. "Posh!" He narrowed his eyes, without losing so much as a fraction of an inch of his smile. "What's the occasion?"
"No, honey," John said, finally finding what he was looking for, with a small cry of triumph. He wheeled his bike out from behind the collection of rakes and shovels he'd inherited from previous tenants, when he moved into the flat. The helmet was where he'd left it, slung over the handles. His backpack was upstairs, hanging in the back of the bedroom closet.
John stared at the message, and his heart filled, and he wanted Sherlock, wanted him to use all his skills to know that the thing he really should do was to walk in through the front door of the flat, and take John away from all of this.
John was on his feet, and tearing off across the road, Sherlock following close on his heels. The man was holding up his camera, and sliding his arm around behind Bainbridge. Too close. Much too close.
A few minutes later, he let himself in through the front door at 221B. The sound of Sherlock's violin filtered down the stairs, a high, sweet tune in three quarter time, something John didn't recognise. He eased the door shut, hoping that Sherlock wouldn't stop playing, that he hadn't heard John come in.
"Mm. I've been here all along."
John wondered if he should offer assurances. There were, he knew, no guarantees. This was war, the secret war that Sherlock had always fought. "I'll try to be safer."
Standing in the kitchen, in the warm morning light, John had been flooded with knowing, that what he'd just had with Mark was what he'd always wanted with Sherlock. He'd spoken aloud then, his only witness the gurgling coffee maker and the old song on the radio.
John laughed for love and pity, and put his hand on Sherlock's face. Sherlock closed his eyes, and leaned into the touch. He sighed, then covered John's hand with his own, and took it down. "John, please. I cannot come between you and what you want."
"He went off over by the loos at the back of the hall after dinner, and I saw her follow him in there."
Time slowed, and John watched Harry as she talked, her liquid eyes dancing, her hands gesturing wildly, and he was filled with love for her, his little sister, who he'd looked after, and who was looking after him today. He studied each of his friends, these men he'd served with, these men who he'd saved, and who had saved him, in a host of ways, large and small. Maybe they didn't talk much. Maybe they weren't in constant contact, but they'd been through things together, and that meant a lot.
Arthur Davies gestured at a collection of clothes artfully laid out on a table by the windows. "And this is your suit. Most unusual, being told how to fit it without meeting you first, but Sherlock assures me that his measurements are completely accurate, and you know, I could hardly dare contradict him." He laughed warmly, and looked into John's eyes, as if expecting that John knew exactly what he meant.
"Sorry. Sorry." John shifted on the sofa, and studied the wood grain of the coffee table. Oak, maybe.
A trace of a smile graced Ella's lips. "The facts of your life are simple, John. You're in a relationship with a new partner. You've planned to take that relationship further, into marriage. These are normal, everyday things. They don't require much explanation."
What seemed like hours later, Mark crept up after him. When he climbed in, he worked his way over to John's side of the bed, and pressed himself up against John's back.
"What?"
When he spoke, it was almost at a whisper. "We need bomb disposal."
Mark closed the gap between them, pushing John up against the wall by the closet, leaning into him, hand going directly to John's crotch. He kissed him hard, his tongue pushing into John's mouth. John groaned, hands wandering, ready to sob with relief. This was exactly what he needed: touch, and the fact of being wanted. It felt like rain on dry desert sand.
He'd thought about Sherlock's tentative question, about how John had known he deserved to have something good in his life, and the implication that Sherlock didn't feel that way himself. In his mind, in his heart, all the way home, John had compiled a list, ridiculously long, of all the reasons why Sherlock deserved to be loved, all the reasons why John loved him. He aimed to leave no ambiguity between them, about any of it, once he'd ended things with Mark.
Meanwhile, John wore his life with Mark like a borrowed jumper. It was protection enough against the cold, he supposed. It would have to be. That had always been the point of it, from the very beginning. Just shelter. He faked enthusiasm for every decision they made. Mark seemed not to notice.
Sherlock took out his phone, and showed John a series of photographs of Moran. He appeared to be leaving Westminster Station. "Disappeared several days ago, along with an entire train carriage. He's just come up for air."
When he and Mark had come home from work Wednesday evening, Mark had mentioned seeing the article, and John had spat words at him, petty, and bitter:
Sherlock stepped forward, saw what John was pointing to, and took a deep breath. "I've already written it."
John wanted him to understand, wanted to be perfectly clear. "Close, but not—no."
John watched the face of the man he'd intended to marry, the monster who had worked so effectively to keep him away from Sherlock. He waited, until he had the right answer, until the thing that Mark would most want to hear filtered its way to the surface.
