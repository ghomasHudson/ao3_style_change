"And you were frightened? Of me?" scoffed Sherlock. "Even if I was a vampire, that seems a bit ridiculous.”
He intercepted some angry looks sent his way by Cousin Avaril. He added her to the list of Beings Who Wanted to Shag John. If she wasn't careful, Miss Avaril might even get on to the detective's Need To Kill List.
"No, but there are werewolves," said John. "I crossed paths with several in London. In fact, there's at least two working at the Met."
"Jeeze. God. Jeeze," sputtered the doctor, gathering his robe together, much to the consulting detectives disappointment. "Sherlock, you can't make jokes about things like that."
('Of course, strong, silent, repressed John would be vocal, once he's pleasured by someone who understands him, like me. And of course, John is a natural bottom. I knew he was a bottom...and a tiny bit submissive too,) deduced the domineering detective. (Just look how well he takes orders. Look how well suited he was to the army. Look how beautifully he pushes back against my finger. My beautiful, gorgeous John would fuck himself against my finger until he ejaculates without any manipulation of his phallus... if I let him. But will I let him? Should I let him?)
"No...please let me finish," said John. "You...you asked me why I left Mary. I think that you must know that while I cared for her in the beginning...cared for her a lot...I never loved her...because," his mouth twisted as if it was wringing out the reluctant words. " Because I was always in love with someone else."
"So we'll just stand around making small talk while our home is invaded by vampires, and John receives supernatural death threats from bloodsuckers and flying horsemen?" demanded Sherlock.
“Actually, your head isn’t very sweaty anymore, unlike your torso. Your head was fairly damp earlier. Perhaps the fever is breaking.”
"...you must settle down, mon ami," said her pallid twin, who also kissed John on the mouth. Sherlock was certain that the little Frenchman had used his tongue.
"John," sighed the detective, enfolding his leprechaun in his arms again. This time, John leaned into Sherlock; this time John brought his arms around his lover's waist. John was John again, pliant and affectionate…
"I really think I should stay and keep an eye on Richard," John said. "Not only is he a bloodsucker, but he's a confidence man—you just can't trust him."
"You have an abscessed tooth? Second molar on the left?" Sherlock rarely indulged in repetition, but in this case he felt it was needed for clarity.
"Well, now just a moment, son. I don't see how your young man could just sneak out the back door," said Father. "I mean we were all right here. Even with Leonora playing with the lights, we would have noticed if your John stepped out. He must still be in the house."
The detective stubbed out his cigarette and then scrunched himself down, so that he could embrace his dazed, adorable doctor. (MY DOCTOR). After three orgasms, John was more than pliant, so he flopped and snuggled into Sherlock's shoulder with a contented hum and threw his arm around the taller man's waist.
"You went into your bloody mind palace again, didn't you?" accused John, his Shar-Pei forehead wrinkling in righteous indignation. "I know you think sentiments are stupid."
Sherlock growled; Mycroft was not supposed to smile at John. He turned away from the food in John's hand, but then John pushed out his lower lip in a fetching pout, licking it for good measure. The detective sighed and took the offered bit of sandwich; it was ham and cheese with mustard. John smiled at Sherlock. The room seemed so much brighter when John smiled.
"But you wewn't," said John. Screwing his face up as if in pain or, more likely, in deep thought. "How ‘bout a compwomise.”
'God, this…this is heaven,' thought the doctor closing his eyes and sighing in a sort of wistful contentment, and pulling the borrowed dressing gown shut. The robe kept slipping open without warning; silk was such tricky, slippery stuff. But it was soft and smelled of his best friend, so John secretly reveled in it, while making sure that it stayed tied shut.
He gave Sherlock a slightly watery smile, then looked at the downy-headed, rosy-cheeked baby in his arms. "See, she's already fallen back to sleep," said John, apropos of nothing.
"John, we've already covered that, but yes. I wish you to move back in to your home here with me. And by the way, you should say, 'me and Elizabeth' not' Lizzy and me'. I realize that society has all but forsaken the finer points of proper language and grammar..."
"Oh. That. Well, Fionn is a lusty man and wants to have his way with practically everyone. It's common knowledge."
'Coward,' thought Sherlock, as Mycroft abandoned his brother to face the repugnant fussing alone—as usual. He didn't count John, because John seemed to like the fussing.
"Oh really?" asked Sherlock, immediately suspicious. When he had first appeared John was bemused, one might say bewitched. Then John defends this supernatural but
The younger man helped lift his blogger by one elbow, earning himself the patented I-can-do-it-myself John Watson glare. Nothing daunted, Sherlock released John's arm, only to gently extract the sleeping infant from her father's arms.
"Sherlock, it's all been quite fantastic...the um...sex, I mean. But, if you must know, I'm a bit sore, so…um, maybe you could hold that thought for awhile?"
Wait...had something happened this morning? Perhaps Sherlock had accidentally deleted an argument, but that was unlikely. Sherlock had been at pains not to delete any interactions with John, since that only resulted in more arguments. No...Sherlock was pretty sure that there hadn't been any disagreements. Perhaps Sherlock, through no fault of his own, had offended his partner?
"Second to the last one...ever," murmured John, tilting his head so that he could receive more kisses, while threading his fingers through Sherlock's disastrously tousled curls. The curls felt like silk, wet and sexy.
"John, I know when you are feigning sleep, and you of all people should know by now, that ignoring me won't make me go away, at least not when I'm investigating…
than Sherlock, who, knew that he was very attractive to both men, women and leprechauns—despite what he personally felt were oddly-shaped eyes and an over-long jaw.) The interloper also wore a cape that swished dramatically every time the man moved. Sherlock resolved to procure a cape as soon as he returned to London.
“Don’t use words that require the use of the letter’s R and L,” said the genius of Baker Street, enunciating slowly to enable his non-genius companion to comprehend every word.
John took a couple cleansing breaths, apparently trying to move past his angry resentment over his soon-to-be ex-wife. Then he relaxed.
"You're going to over-think it," said the taller man. "just like with the sex, which you'll want, but then you'll worry about being in a homosexual relationship, and get all frigid and repressed."
Sherlock's eyes narrowed, he wanted much more than an affectionate peck. He could get an affectionate peck from Molly any day. From John, he wanted more. He wanted everything.
He glanced casually at the clock, noting that his doctor was now one hour and thirty-seven minutes late, not that it mattered much. Sherlock enjoyed having John around but would never admit this, besides it wasn’t as if Sherlock couldn’t fend for himself.
," he sneered. He whirled around, and his cape followed like a dark cloud of outrage, before he stalked off to lurk in a corner of the sitting room like a large bat.
Of course, the first two questions were the product of wishful thinking (meaning delusional thinking) on John's part. The final two questions were unnecessary. The doctor assumed that his dearest friend had already deduced all the salient points and was waiting to spring it all on John, whenever it would be the most dramatic. And this made John very happy indeed.
"Just a minor official, I assure you. Well, brother mine, while you were staking your claim, everything thing else has been taken care of," said Mycroft standing in the doorway, completely unaffected by the sight of the debauched, naked men in front of him. "I took the liberty of stopping by in person because neither of you is answering your phones."
The World's Only Consulting Detective eyed his best friend (who should be more than his best friend), who for once seemed happy, albeit exhausted. Which was…unexpected, because lately John was always miserable and exhausted, not happy and exhausted.
"Very well. You rest here, and I will return with paracetamol and copious amounts of water," said Sherlock.
Naturally, as Sherlock's personal physician, Doctor Watson had seen this skin before and it had featured in a few of his fantasies too. But now he could touch the alabaster skin with his lips and tasted it with his tongue. He could run his hands over the firm flesh, making himself ache with want, making him moan.
John smiled gently, "No, not at all." He yawned hugely. "She just had a very messy nappy, and then she decided that she needed a bottle. Then, she had a bit of gas..."
"Oh? So there'll be sex then?" asked John, thinking about sex again, but much more optimistically. Little John was feeling optimistic too. As soon as he thought about his nicknamed body part, John began to blush.
And Sherlock had let his beloved wander off into their dark and probably cold bedroom (That stupid room was always too cold. Sherlock would be sure to complain to the landlady first thing in the morning.) What if John was suffering from chills? What if he was having a serious complication from his abscess right now?
Sherlock coughed, a dry little cough. He was very, very thirsty. He reached for his mug and took a sip, nearly spitting it out again. Gah!!!! Cold and bitter.
"Even an instantaneous response does not preclude you from mentioning such a summons to someone like…oh, say...like your
"I am providing you moral support in your time of need. I will also provide you with warmth via shared body heat."
"Get off me! You thrice-cursed, blood-sucking leech!" cried John, violently shoving Richard aside. His coffee mug fell to the floor and shattered, accompanied by another roll of thunder. The blond practically trembled with rage as his fists clenched and unclenched repeatedly.
As was often the case, Sherlock couldn't decipher social signals, and he was uncertain what Mummy's dancing brows were meant to convey. Taking a shot in the dark, Sherlock decided to distract his always-hungry partner with food. The detective grabbed a scone, broke off a piece and shoved it into John's mouth.
Not even a, 'Why are you in my flat, unannounced, at 0830 in the morning, wearing my dressing gown, while Mrs. Hudson apparently has had to wash your clothes. Oh, and by the way, did you know your mobile is broken, John?'
This left Sherlock still enduring boredom. He was still irritated that John had gotten sick—again. This was the second time this year. It was inconvenient. It was disturbing. He was frankly disgusted by the all the sweating and the vomiting, even if the vomiting had only happened that one time.
The former army doctor reached one hand around the talkative genius's neck. Sherlock was still going on about John's inhibitions, 'probably projecting,' thought the doctor with a fond smile. 'I'll give him a safe little kiss, to let him know how I feel.'
"John!" he shouted, although the rain and thunder swallowed his shout. The din was so loud, that the detective couldn't hear his own voice. Nevertheless, he called again and again, "John! John, where are you? John!"
Then the ever-observant detective noticed John's helpless goldfish-out-of-water face. It was endearing, of course, but a subtle sign, that perhaps John had not been aware of his wife's second, rather more lucrative, job. Perhaps this was upsetting for his blogger.
"What? What? " repeated the detective. "What did you say? I believe that I may have missed something."
"Not so fast!" said Mycroft. "We are not bringing a fairy of unknown provenance to roost in our family's abode."
"She's Elizabeth's godmother. Mrs. Hudson wants to babysit. She's looking forward to it...and when she's not available, I suppose I could always call on my parents," said Sherlock with a moue of distaste. "They'd be over the moon to babysit Elizabeth, you know."
The brilliant scientist examined seven slides and was adjusting the eyepiece on his microscope, when he was forced to clear his dry throat. He really was very thirsty, and hoped John would return soon with the sugar for his currently unpalatable tea. Since speech was evidently painful, the doctor certainly wouldn't want to chat with Mrs. Hudson for very long, which should speed things along nicely.
"Stay!" Mummy commanded John. The blond froze, and stood to attention. "Your two friends, John—they're twins, obviously—I mean to say, that they're lovely, just delightful. But...I'm not quite so sure about that Richard...I just wondered, if you two don't get on, then why invite him?"
It was clearly hard for his doctor to think when confronted with the evidence of Sherlock's arousal. And John didn't really want to go slow anyway, not with that painful looking erection. Clearly, John was not 'not gay'.
'Was it three times? Really. Damn, I wouldn't have thought Little John had it in him,' thought the doctor proudly.
To begin with, he'd use simple words and short sentences, suitable to someone with traumatic brain damage. "Did you go to the pub? Did you get into a fight? Do you have a concussion?" (Wait that's not a short word) "Do you have a head injury?" (Mm, still too long.) "Show me your head!"
"His hair is still always messy," said Mummy fondly. Then she turned her attention to John. "Not like your hair, John. Your hair is so nice and neat. Not just now, of course. Just now it's sticking up like a hedgehog."
'At least,' thought the frustrated detective, 'this will give me all night to plan my revenge. To begin with, I will need to acquire a convincing vampire costume and realistic fangs..."
"Oh God, Sherlock!" cried John who'd gone deathly pale. "I...I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I didn't mean it...well I meant it, of course. But never mind it. Can't you just delete what I said about loving you? Then we'll just go on as before, yeah?"
Elizabeth had been fed immediately prior to the last round of sex, in which John demonstrated that even a natural bottom could top, and do it really well...but that was not important, well, it wasn't important now. It would obviously be useful during their upcoming sex holiday.
(Perhaps, he is quiet, because he is actually deleting what I said?) thought the detective hopefully.
...Sherlock was murmuring deductions into John's hair. They were not the usual sweet nothings, which lovers told each other. Of course they weren't. Sherlock murmured that John was his and if anyone came within six feet of John, Sherlock would make him or her disappear.
Sherlock felt a twinge of jealously at his own mother as she played with his John's hair. He was also annoyed with himself for not thinking to dry John off before, because it left John flushed pink with his hair sticking up all over the place as if he'd been well shagged. Sherlock decided that this was a most fetching look for John, one which would be replicated—later.
John started and looked around the room, his eyes wide with alarm, before staring questioningly at the tall, handsome but rather anemic gentleman.
John nodded respectfully at the representative of Her Majesty's government. Sherlock frowned harder; John was not supposed to gaze at his brother with respect. He also accepted half of another finger sandwich from John.
"My Goodness, Sherlock!" said Mrs. Hudson, drawing out the words to indicate her disappointment in his behavior. (And people still accused HIM of missing social cues?) "Why on earth are you pounding on my door at this hour? You'll wake the neighbors!"
Whatever his brother had been about to say was lost as the storm unleashed its full fury on the two siblings. Bolts of lightning burst around them; the wind and thunder roared, sounding like a cavalcade of riders pounding towards them.
Sherlock fell back into his chair, deeply disappointed. He didn't want to give up further sexual relations with John. He liked having sexual relations with John. He really, liked having his blogger stretched out underneath him writhing with pleasure and passion. He particularly liked burying himself deep inside the man he loved.
"Yes," said John hesitantly. "Yes, of course, you can handle it. Of course you can..." His voice trailed off and he dry scrubbed his face with both hands. "I'm just...I guess I'm just tired. Really tired and..."
Relief flooded the detective, his John, his loving, smiling Leprechaun had was back and safe—and as loyal as ever.
"Why? Why did you leave? Did she hurt you?" Sherlock demanded angrily. "Did she threaten Elizabeth? Did she cut you with that knife? I swear ..."
"Never mind the knife; it was mostly just for show. Besides I disarmed her," said John, proud of disarming a dangerous, highly paid, international assassin without spilling a drop of baby formula. The blond smiled and nodded at dark chocolate curls and razor-sharp cheek bones and the sound of a deeply rumbling voice- in other words, at the man, who John secretly loved more than the rest of the world...aside from Lizzy. John loved Lizzy and Sherlock more than anything else, and to hell with the rest of the world. He loved Lizzy like his own daughter, because she was his daughter. And he loved Sherlock like a brother because…because that's the way it had to be, although the former soldier wanted so much more. But it was fine; it was all fine. John leaned back and basked under the detective's intense scrutiny and did not pine for more.
He looked for clothes. He would talk with Mary, in no uncertain terms, but not in a sheet...well, why not in a sheet? What did clothing matter, in comparison to John and Elizabeth's safety.
Sherlock suspected that one shouldn’t initiate sexual congress with one’s ailing lover, so it was lucky that the detective couldn’t really see John’s hair in the dark.
"...of course, Jean," agreed the pale lovely woman, rising up on her toes to plant a slow, luxurious kiss on John's pink lips. Sherlock wanted to kill her too.
"...the first time you gave a blow job…well done, by the way. I nearly passed out," the arrogant git grinned happily. "The first time you had sex on a table...oh, wait. No..."
The detective looked down at the blissed-out blond, who sprawled half onto his lap, with a vague half-smile adorning his face. The doctor was so dazed that he hadn't even noticed that Sherlock was smoking, not only smoking, but smoking in bed. Normally this would have had the doctor frothing at the mouth, but then John's mouth was probably a bit tired and sore.
Then the doctor's words echoed through the John Watson annex of the mind palace, "I think she just wants to be held," John had said, 'thus satisfying a typical human's need for comfort through touch, warmth and close proximity,' finished Sherlock. 'Elizabeth is fine as long as she is held. And no doubt, John will respond positively to being held too.'
Yet, in spite his hedgehog hair, scruff and wrinkles, John Watson was easily the most beautiful person Sherlock had ever seen; he wanted to take John now. Right now. Especially since it was Sherlock's turn to top again, and he had an idea for an experiment, which John would initially refuse and then reluctantly agree to before gratefully acknowledging how wonderful it had been.
The Holmes matriarch held out her hand, and Leonora slapped another towel into it. John's hair was roughly tousled by Mummy's efficient toweling off. Like his older brother, Sherlock was not above throwing John under the bus—when said bus was Mummy.
"Besides, John, I don't think we have time for our first round of shower sex..." said Sherlock, before the bathroom door slammed shut, muffling the whining voice of Mycroft's little brother.
'God, he'll see that I'm lusting after him. Now I really will have to go to New Jersey,' thought the doctor.
Because John and his daughter had been kidnapped! And the kidnappers had left the radio to alert Sherlock to their heinous crime.
Then the sheet-clad detective frowned, 'This is a bit not good. If we have sex again, then I will have to count it as part of a scheduled sex holiday,' worried Sherlock. 'Which is absurd, because we just had sex, all over the flat. But if I make one exception, it will negate the entire program. Clearly, I should wait, at least until I make a calendar.'
," said John, jerking a thumb towards Richard while still rubbing his cheek with his other hand. At least the cut had finally stopped bleeding. "If he so much as touches me again…"
"And yet I'm sure she'd disapprove of New Jersey or Cleveland," said Sherlock. "Which brings us back to the question, why?'
Secondly,the silk robe had slipped off his shoulder; he was all but naked in front of Sherlock Holmes and, as noted previously, hard as a rock and wanton as a whore. And while this made him blush, he decided that he liked it, A lot. It was daring, dangerous and it led to the next realization...
Within minutes, the two Watsons were asleep, snuggled safely into the Man who Loved Them Most in the World. Which is far better title than the World's Only Consulting Detective, thought Sherlock…not that he'd ever admit that to anyone.
The guests began to mutter amonst themselves. "Did you hear a horn?" "I didn't hear any horns." "I hope this doesn't delay tea time." "We never should have come here. Something strange always happens whenever that Sherlock is around."
"Do stop bragging, Sherlock," said the British Government, "I wouldn't want to see the poor man go into apoplexy before the wedding. Now do try to get your doctor out of bed, if he can walk, and clean him up. And don't forget to scour that table. Scour it twice…in fact."
"I still think you should let me threaten him a little," said the sullen consulting detective. "I know where he lives."
Her voice was temporarily lost in the racket of everyone trying to talk above everyone else. Concerned and nosy relatives blocked the door, leaving Sherlock no choice but to push his way in, jostling everyone and earning his usual complement of disapproving comments and thinly veiled insults. Somewhere along the line, Cousin Avaril attached herself to John, leaving the consulting detective to trail behind his leprechaun. The warm kitchen smelled of scones, ham and too many damp Holmeses. Not surprisingly, Sherlock vented his irritation and frazzled nerves by slamming the door shut with a loud bang followed by pouting.
…Sherlock had boldly grabbed his arse, and was squeezing it. And John rather liked this too. He liked this very much, which was why...
Sherlock vastly prefered grumpy over that eerie monotone voice that John had approached them with. He drew John close to shelter him from the cold rain and from Mycroft.
dazed," said John. "And if I was, dazed that is, it's because I was concentrating on  his lusty advances, and because I had to spread luck to you and your family. Plus, he keeps blowing that bloody horn of his, and it's distracting." John looked off toward an impressive display of cloud-to-cloud lightning and got that far-away look in his eyes again.
"Too bad. It was…well…it was fwightening. said John defensively. Then after a pause he added, "And sexy. Weawy, weawy sexy.”
(No, I mean doctor. I had plans for Lestrade, as you well know. And now that fool of a doctor is going to abscond to New Jersey with my goldfish,) spat mind palace Mycroft.
Neither of the boys could get a word in edgewise, nor could they enter the house with Mummy planted squarely in the doorway.
"Oh, She'wock," said John. Clearly, Sherlock had managed to say something right because the doctor was thawing rapidly. He started to roll over to hug the younger man, then pulled back. "Oh, sowwy. I forgot the ‘no touching when I'm sick’ wule."
As it happened, John wasn't about to be violently ill; however, the short blond did look as if he might behave violently.
"Mortimer doesn't come from hell, gorgeous," purred Richard, who suddenly loomed over Sherlock. "But who are you? John, introduce me to your delicious friend."
Sherlock sneered back, unimpressed with the man's ludicrous melodramatics and no longer envious of the cape.
see the light welling up from John's fingers, confirming that Richard either had fairy sight too, or else he was another supernatural. Sherlock was prepared to wager on the latter.
"…you are not going to clinic tomorrow," continued Sherlock. "I myself will call to let them know you are too sick to see patients. I will not mention that you might make some patients uncomfortable with your untoward symptoms, especially the emesis, not to mention, they’d have difficulty understanding your speech since you can’t properly produce liquid consonants. Furthermore, I intend to make you tea and toast, before setting to work on some cold cases that I shall obtain from Lestrade. You needn’t worry about being left to fend for yourself, I shall also ensure that Mrs. Hudson provides you with additional tea, sustenance and tedious conversation.”
"Awwight! Yes, I was dweaming about you!" huffed the exhausted doctor, who took his revenge by settling a bit closer to the excellent heat source sharing his bed. Since John was no longer very feverish or sweaty, Sherlock did not mind a great deal.
"Why me? Why do I have to get cleaned up and he doesn't?" said the doctor, clutching the twisted sheets in front of himself and missing all the significant data-as usual.
Made of sterner stuff than consulting detectives and bureaucrats, the former army officer stoically stood to attention under her ministrations. He didn’t even spill his tea.
God, 'I've missed this' thought John feeling irrationally pleased. 'Sherlock will deduce everything.' (Well, hopefully, not THAT. Everything except THAT. Except THAT is what I came here to tell him. Still, I'm sure he won't deduce THAT, and when I do tell him THAT, he'll be shocked. Then he'll say he's flattered (but not really mean it), and he'll say he's married to his work, which is fine. I don't mind, really. Then we'll get back to normal-almost. But he'll know the truth. I won't have to live in fear that he's going to deduce my stupid feelings for him at the absolute worst possible time. And there's always the possibility that he'll want me too...or not. Which is fine...just fine...)
"Never fear, John," said Sherlock bracingly, "The problem can be solved by studying your uncharted territory..."
to see you." He bent fluidly at the waist, to kiss first the palm of John's free hand, followed by kissing each of the leprechaun's cheeks, lingering over his injured left cheek, as if licking the blood off John's cut.
"John broke his phone with his head. I turned my phone off because I do not want to be disturbed when I'm having sex with John," said Sherlock.
He'd wanted to say that body parts aside, he trusted Sherlock a hell of lot more than her. John had found himself wanting to punch the woman, who pretended to be his wife. He'd never punched a woman before, but she tempted him. Sometimes it was just very hard not to clock her just once, but so far, John had managed to restrain himself. He was a bit proud of that restraint actually, especially since she herself exercised no restraint at all.
"I can't answer it," said John. "Portents and omens are nearly impossible to understand unless you're a seer. I am a leprechaun, not a seer. All I know is that Death is coming to tea."
The Watsons were nothing if not resolute, that is to say, stubborn. Clearly, John was now overwhelmed by sentiment and required attention, which he would no doubt stubbornly refuse.
"Sherlock, please don't go into your mind palace just yet," asked John sadly. "Look, just hear me out, and if you hate what I'm saying, you can delete it, yeah?"
"I take it that you are too sick to make tea?" Sherlock asked, just to be sure. "And fetch the sugar?" Well. Not only was John disgustingly sick, he was also rude and selfishly hogging the bed, because Sherlock did not sleep with sick people.
"Bah, you've spent too long playing spy games, Mycroft," sneered the younger brother. "Through no fault of his own, he is wanted by someone…"
John blinked; he'd never seen his best friend blush. Not even when that dreadful Woman tried to seduce him. Of course, Sherlock's dreadful Woman wasn't as dreadful as John's dreadful wife...but, soon to be ex-wife, thank God.
"Sherlock! You're getting crumbs all over the carpet," complained Mummy. "You always were the messy one."
After knowing John for several years, Sherlock had begun to learn the meaning of discretion, although he only applied it to John. So Sherlock took the unusual step of remaining silent, twice in as many minutes.
"Oh for God's sake. She broke it when she lobbed it at me," said John, smiling as the familiar flow of deductions began.
"Really?" said the physician, with narrowed eyes. His lips pinched together as his slower, yet not stupid brain began to turn over all the data. "This was all planned? And what was this operation called?"
Sherlock retook his seat, plucking his violin discordantly, as he watched his occasionally idiotic conductor of light (who should be MY husband) smile stupidly, for no good reason, especially considering that he was married to an international assassin, who had attacked him with a mobile phone and who could be plotting against John even now...
'Perhaps...perhaps we could schedule sex on a predictable basis, planning around cases. The very predictability of it would lead to less mental degredation. And if we avoid sex during cases, then a tiny, temporary loss of perfect mental functioning during sex would be tolerable.'
John shook his head no and accepted another piece of scone from the hand of his proudly smirking companion.
Then the doctor couldn't babble because he was sucking on one of the delectable little buds on Sherlock's chest. And he, John Hamish Watson, was making William Sherlock Scott Holmes groan and arch his back into John's mouth.
Sherlock strode past the empty bathroom, into the dark vacant kitchen and peered into the John-less sitting room.
"You said all that out loud too, John," said the smugly smirking detective, who kissed John's head, then his forehead, then his temple, then his cheeks..."and it's the second to the last cigarette that I'll smoke in this flat."
Sherlock had gotten almost as wet as John, but John seemed to tolerate the cold poorly. He was always wearing multiple layers of clothing—favoring heavy, shapeless jumpers. The sprite had once mentioned that the weather in Faerie was always warm and temperate, except for the two obligatory months of winter when the snow fell in perfect drifts like one might see on a Christmas card.
Perhaps, if he knew more about the infection, he'd feel better about the whole thing. He decided to Google tooth abscesses. At the very least, it would pass time, and he might learn some helpful tips to pass on to John later.
Sherlock resurfaced slowly, gently, taking a deep breath of cool evening air, noting that he'd left the window cracked open. Then he snuggled deeper under the warm covers. He buried his face into the soft pillow that smelled of John.
But what if John was in trouble? Sherlock was determined to carry on, but there was no reason to put Mycroft at risk too. Anyway, Sherlock didn't want his brother to learn of John's abilities. So he yelled over the storm, "Mycroft! Go back, back to the house."
Sherlock frowned. That sounded like mental confusion or else typical middle of the night John hostility—difficult to be sure. He'd try another question before sending for an ambulance.
Sherlock nibbled and sucked on the shorter man's lips, as if they were gourmet delicacies. Which they were, decided the detective. They were his gourmet delicacies.
. Then she commanded silence, which Mycroft ignored saying, "It was John's fault! We were only looking for him after he got lost in the woods like a witless cretin, leaving us to get caught in the downburst. The winds were dreadful: I think it may have been a derecho. It was a miracle that we weren’t hurt.” He scowled at John, ready to throw the leprechaun under the bus, like any good politician would.
"John, we are discussing Elizabeth's new bedroom, obviously. I took the liberty of painting it blue, like her eyes, which are just like your eyes, you know… ...but we could paint it pink, if you insist." This last was said with contempt, because Sherlock hated pink, as did Elizabeth.
Sherlock grabbed the shorter man's arm and whispered into his ear, "John, stop it; you're glowing." However, John ignored Sherlock, his attention still fixed on the retreating storm. Sherlock's concern mounted, because this was entirely out of character for the leprechaun who doted on Sherlock and usually followed his orders...make that his advice.
Heavy breathing could be a sign of pneumonia. Mental confusion could be a sign of a brain abscess. Add in John's fever and this did not bode well.
"Not soon, John. Now. Today," snapped the detective. "Today, as in, some of Mycroft's minions are bringing over Elizabeth's cot and some clothes, nappies and bottles..."
"You're right about one thing," said Sherlock with a smirk. "John is hiding. He's hiding from someone who wishes him ill."
Well, Sherlock would not allow that abuse to continue, and he stormed back into the bedroom...the sheet trailing behind him.
"What! What the hell!" said John, stumbling out of their bedroom with his gun drawn, no less. At least John was still of a mind to provide protection. That was reassuring.
Really, the whole Mary debacle, on top of caring for a new baby, on top of extra hours at the clinic had been too much for John Watson. The Magnussen and Moriarty cases which barely predated Elizabeth's exciting arrival on the world stage probably hadn't helped John's peace of mind. Definitely didn't help.
'Which is probably a bit not good,' thought John, as he blew gently and skillfully on the pebbled bud, before he nuzzled it, rubbing his face against Sherlock's sculpted chest and gaining Sherlock's stuttering approval.
'And that.' ruminated John, 'that probably explains why the spotty boy at the newsstand is always so impertinent. Why be polite to the cuckold. It's probably why the cabbies never stop for me. Why stop for the wimp whose wife is sleeping with one of his oldest friends. That's probably why Mycroft is such a dick to me...no, wait, Mycroft was a dick long before I met Mary, but still…"
Richard's smirk faded into a frown of concern. Most of the guests were already stepping back to give the belligerent blond room to fight the cool brunet. Sherlock just hoped his relatives didn't see that John's hands were filling with light instead of preparing for fisticuffs.
Which returned Sherlock back to the original problem. How to have sex, while not interfering with the genius of the World's Only Consulting Detective?
"...do I know them?" said Mycroft, annoyingly completing John's question. "I make it my business to keep track of all registered vampires, especially ones belonging to the diplomatic corps."
The Homes brothers agreed on few things, but they were of one mind when it came to anyone fussing over them—they despised fussing. Of course the entire extended Holmes family spilled outside in order to fuss over the two brothers who had been thought lost in the storm.
"Really?" said Sherlock, raising one eyebrow—the better to send Aunt Penelope a death glare. "That may be because I had just gotten out of hospital after OD'ing on…"
"I know what I see," said the elder brother. "I see a man besotted, who is being played for a fool by a common con man."
Sherlock's mind palace went dark and utterly silent, as his neurons ceased to function, because he didn't
"I don't need any more warnings or portents," said John ungraciously, "unless you plan to give me something specific to go on."
"No, I trust the tests," said the doctor, putting the icy bag of vegetables back onto to his sore head. "At least I trust the tests that you ran...Did I tell you that she was shocked when I told her that I had paternity tests run."
One hour and fifty-seven minutes: Sherlock was still thirsty. The flat was cold because John hadn't lit the fire yet. The sitting room was depressingly dark, because John should have been home one hour and fifty-seven minutes ago to turn on the lights.
This was ridiculous, how long did John intend to chat with their landlady—and John with a painful jaw too? Was this payback for something? True, Sherlock's experiment had overflowed the table, spreading onto the counters. (One sample had sloshed onto the floor as well, but that was not unusual, and John could clean that up in the morning—no rush.) This was intolerable! Regardless of the inciting event, petty revenge was beneath a man who called himself a physician, and Sherlock was going to tell him so.
John was one hour and fifty-six minutes late, and Sherlock fingers drummed on the table almost as if they were nervous.
He stopped at the sight of the rumpled bed. "This was supposed to have been our bedroom,' he thought wistfully.
"Mycroft travels with a full wardrobe of suits," said the younger Holmes, putting an arm around his shivering leprechaun.
"So it's the name of the operation that concerns you. Good, really good , John. If it makes you feel any better, Lestrade wanted to call it Operation: It's-About-Fucking-Time," said Sherlock, thoughtfully blowing smoke away from his non-smoking boyfriend (soon to be husband. It's a relief that John is taking all this so very well. Much better than I expected. Molly was right, I should have made John move in with me, the day Elizabeth left the hospital.) "Molly suggested, Operation: Push-John-Off-The-Fence."
"Oh God" muttered the blond aloud. 'Tell him, don't tell him, tell him...' John stewed in an agony of indecision-. 'No, I can't go on like this. It's better to be open and honest. Anyway, he's got a hard on, and that's got to be a good sign and maybe he'll let me touch him. No, stop thinking sexy thoughts about Sherlock. Just stop it!' John ordered himself. 'Right! This is stupid. I planned to tell him. I will tell him-now.'
"Wait, where're we going?" asked John, inevitably following Sherlock Holmes, even as he stubbornly questioned everything. "Shouldn't we get that empty bottle and wash it? And what d'you mean like father, like daughter?" John was forced to talk to the silent detective's back. "No, really, what does that even mean..."
"Well, sometimes that's true," said John. "but it's this crazy spinning thing you're doing that's making me dizzy right now. "
Without further commentary, John filled the kettle with water and switched it on. He silently washed out two mugs because the sink was filled with dirty dishes. Why hadn't John done the washing up this morning? It would have saved him time later.
He searched found the radio device under John's pants, which had been carelessly discarded during their last coupling.
John shuddered at the memory of that grizzly episode, all that foul, nasty, smelly stuff melting and then leaking into his hair, and over his wound and finally staining his trousers too.
John's mouth twisted in a strange facsimile of a smile, and then held his finger up again. Sherlock assumed that the finger meant 'got it in one' again.
"I don't care. I don't..." muttered John in between kissing biting, sucking. 'I don't care if I ever breathe again. I don't care if I DIE from kissing. biting. sucking..."
The tall detective left his bemused friend in the sitting room as he strode into the kitchen to retrieve the bag of frozen peas, which was used as an ice bag. He carefully checked to ensure that it was the frozen peas and not the bag of frozen bile stones. He did not want a repeat of last month's debacle, when a similar bag containing frozen, sectioned toes defrosted and leaked all over John's trousers. John had been quite displeased at the mess, (Sherlock had expected that John would try to punch him again.) And Mary…Mary had looked so smug and superior, taunting Sherlock with her smirk, as if to say 'You don't deserve him; you could never take care of John properly, you FREAK.'
John dropped his red face into his hands with a groan. He was so embarrassed that he didn't even wonder how Sherlock read his mind-again.
Sherlock stalked downstairs, and rapped firmly but politely on the door to 221A. As usual, it took the older landlady four and a half minutes to answer his repeated summonses.
Sherlock was vaguely aware that his jaw had dropped unattractively, and he had accidentally pulverized the scone into tiny crumbs, as he stared at the…vampire?
Sitting in the dark with John's head on his chest was comforting, because now he could monitor his lover for any life-threatening complications.
The detective slid his tongue inside John's unresisting mouth, claiming it too, and finally tasting the doctor (HIS DOCTOR) (Ohhh! Yes. Yes. YES! Now this is kissing,) thought the smug consulting detective. (If I keep him busy enough, John won't be able to have a sexual identity crisis. If he's full of endorphins, he'll be too happy to worry about being gay. I'll make him so happy that he'll want to be gay.)
It was not that Sherlock was actually concerned. It wasn't as though they had a case on, so there was no reason for John to be kidnapped by unknown assailants. And Mycroft was out of town. Besides, John had promised not to get into anymore mysterious, black sedans, no matter how much he craved excitement.
"You need to see a dentist," offered Sherlock, experiencing that sinking feeling that he always got when John was sick.
Richard, Jacinthe and Adrien, looking deeply offended, stared at Sherlock. Sherlock narrowed his eyes and tilted his head. Perhaps the word bloodsucker might be a pejorative term amongst their kind.
John nodded helplessly, or maybe his head was jerked up and down as she scrubbed his short blond hair dry.
John would go out in the rain, even if he did hear a car horn. And just as the scones were done, too. He said
"I thought you probably already knew—after all, you have the Faerie-sight, as does your brother,” said John. "Nevertheless, the next time I see one, I'll point him out to you—or her."
'No. No, no, no, cases under five-unlimited sex. Fives and sixes-limited sex on an as need basis. Cases seven and above-no sex, except in a dire emergency or during one of those long drawn out cases, when John forces me to slow down my brain by eating anyway. After the mind-numbing effects following the consumption of a sandwich, sex will hardly have any additional adverse effect on my genius.'
"Do you take me for a fool?" Mycroft almost snarled. "If you were a leprechaun you'd be guarding fairy treasure."
"Excuse us, Mummy," said Sherlock, dragging John into the corner opposite Richard, the vampire. In the dark, candlelit room, they would be all but invisible to the relatives, who in any case, were busy eating everything in sight now that the promise of fisticuffs had vanished.
The doctor's capable fingers circled a nipple, then rubbed gently, then rubbed harder, eliciting a deep, dark groan from his lover, followed by sub-sonic words of encouragement.
John raised a finger, probably intending to convery 'got it in one’. But in the dark, it was hard to make out John’s primitive attempts at sign language, and it seemed as though John had used his middle finger and not his index finger, which would obviously change the entire meaning of the sign, Sherlock was well aware that John had picked up several unsavory Americanisms while serving along side U. S. soldiers in Afghanistan, including the single digit version of the two-fingered salute.
"Don't be ridiculous, John, that man is not one of your deities," drawled Sherlock, while smoke poured from his mouth as if he were a dragon, "This is only the British Government."
"Oh dear, oh dear! You'll be sure to come down with a cold after this, John! Going out in the rain without a hat, not even a coat. What would your mother say?"
"How about,” said John, interrupting Sherlock’s train of thought. “How about we shawe pwobwems and work on them as a team, one day at a time? Yeah?”
"Well, I don't know…" began Mummy but her attention was dragged over to Father, as he whispered something to her while pointing at Mycroft's retreating back.
'Embarrassing!' thought John Watson, who hoped that Sherlock wouldn't notice his arousal; even though it was obvious that Sherlock had instantly noticed. John turned a nice deep red, like a good cabernet, but he still didn't realize how little the gaping robe hid.
"How can he look at it? It's on his face," Sherlock said disagreeably. It was the best he could come up with. He had to tread lightly, because
'The man might look like six-feet of unbridled sex but what if The World's Only Consulting Detective is inexperienced or actually a virgin or asexual or afraid of sex or just afraid to be touched,' thought John. 'It's fine. I'll go slow. I'll be patient, go only as far as Sherlock wants. I don't mind.'
In case you haven't noticed:this story is not series compliant nor are the characters 'in character". But since John is a leprechaun, you should have deduced that already.
He looked into the blue room, which was illuminated by a glowing rabbit light fixture. John held the small infant close over his heart, as he rocked in the large wooden rocker. He looked tired, but not overly concerned. Unlike the time when Elizabeth was throwing up all her formula, and Doctor Watson had terrorized the other doctors in the A and E, until Sherlock arrived to terrorize the other doctors for John. Luckily, the problem had been solved by a switch to another formula...
"I find it repugnant that my younger sibling should be partnering with a man who has no past, no records, no papers of any kind," snapped Mycroft, who had spent countless hours trying to discover John Watson's true identity, all in vain.
"Well, I can't understand how a ten-stone man could just vanish from our cupboard," said Father, examining the pantry with his handy pocket torch.
"Well maybe you should expect my help," whispered Sherlock sharply. "Maybe it's about time that you realized that I would do literally anything for you."
"It was a summonsing enchantment," replied John sharply, "which one cannot refuse. But the call to arms and the invitation to warm his bed is still a matter of choice. Choice is important to the Fianna. Although admittedly Fionn does stack the deck by using his glamour to look irresistibly masculine.”
"And how do you know Richard, Mycroft?" asked John, as he fed Sherlock yet another piece of sandwich—chicken salad this time.
"No, it's not," said John, his mouth twisting for emphasis. "What's important is that Fionn was carrying a message for me, which he delivered right before whipping me."
The resident genius smiled faintly, neglecting the slide made from liver sample #3, as he mentally reviewed his doctor's evening schedule. After work, John would enter the front door, wipe his feet—twice for each foot, then hang up his coat and messenger bag. Then he'd come up the stairs and immediately find Sherlock to give him a kiss. Next, John would make a detour into the lavatory. At last, the little blond would be ready to get to work. He’d prepare the kettle while providing one to two minutes of pointless, one-sided commentary on either the weather, the crowded tube or a particularly dull incident at the clinic. (Sherlock naturally pretended that he wasn’t listening, even though John’s monologue gave Sherlock important clues about his blogger’s welfare). After switching the kettle on, John would discover that the biscuits had already been opened and pretend to be surprised that some (most) of the biscuits were missing (This is when Sherlock would finally deign to speak, claiming that the jammy dodgers had been used in an experiment, when in fact he'd eaten them instead of the nutritious sandwich, which his doctor had left for him in the plastic box labeled Sherlock's Lunch). John always shook his head over the missing biscuits and attempted to look stern (but instead he tended to smile affectionately, crinkling the corners of his eyes) as he assembled mugs, tea, milk and sugar (the sugar was for Sherlock).
"Bah, yourself, dear brother," sneered Mycroft. "They all claim that it's no fault of theirs. He is, no doubt, a common criminal…"
The leprechaun stared at Mycroft as if only now recognizing him. The blond blinked rapidly, his eyes glittering as the sky lit up again.
...Then the genius started deducing into John's over-sensitized ear again. He deduced John's appendectomy scar.
The original posting for this chapter (on FF) was edited by my wonderful beta, Old Ping Hai. All remaining errors are strictly my own.
It was worth the bruise on his head to be out from under her talons once and for all. Now he and Lizzy could start their new lives together, without her.
Perhaps...perhaps the violin was not conducive to sleep when John was ill? No, that couldn’t be correct. Sherlock had played for hours when John had the flu specifically because it seemed to sooth the doctor.
Even sick, John wasn't that disgusting and he didn't seem to be on the verge of death just yet, so perhaps Sherlock could stop worrying a tiny bit.
At least John would hate the coffee as much as Sherlock did; that was some consolation, thought the detective, as the hot piss burned his mouth.
"...so even though Lizzy is sleeping for longer periods, perhaps it would be better if we Watsons moved into our own flat."
The taller man sagged with relief. John didn't want to leave. The doctor was just confused, which was not unusual for John, especially in the middle of the night.
(Was popular. Ladies, note the use of the past tense. John 'Three Continents' Watson will no longer be available to any of you…Ever Again,) thought the detective.
"In the name of Hecate, that wasn't Faerie light, that was the spectral light of the incorporeal Fianna," said John, "Anyway, Fionn is not one of the Fae."
The human infant in question sucked on her dummy, resolutely not sleeping yet not opening her eyes. Dwarfed by her godfather's long limbs and large hands, she nuzzled her head against his chest.
Even if illnesses made Sherlock uncomfortable, he'd have to help John a little. Maybe he could ensure that Mrs. Hudson brought the cranky doctor some tea. Sherlock smirked; this was an excellent idea. Mrs. Hudson could bring John tea and tedious conversation, while Sherlock worked on a cold case down at the Yard with a clear conscience.
The detective frowned momentarily, but decided overlook John’s possibly unintentional rudeness to discover more about this interesting dream. After all, the dream was about Sherlock.
Normally, it was their bedroom. But John was sick, and should be in hospital or at least in his own bed upstairs. Sadly, it was too late to say anything about whose bedroom it was, because John was already in the room and no doubt spreading his germs all over.
"Ah, that explains your headache and the contusion. I suppose I should be grateful she didn't leave you with a concussion," said Sherlock. "But there was a knife, which means she broke our agreement and now I can..."
The man and woman were a bit shorter than John. Both were quite pale, fashionably thin and dressed in a fitted black suit and tight black halter dress respectively. Their dark blue-black-violet eyes skirted around the room, looking at Richard before fixing on John. They moved in unison. It didn't take a genius to deduce that they were twins. And yet that was all he could deduce. There was definitely something odd about these tea party crashers.
John blinked and slowly turned toward Sherlock, seeming to look past the consulting detective. Sherlock hated this. He was used to being the center of John's world. Why wasn't he the focus of John's attention now?
"Nope," said John, shaking his head. "We're just going to have to wait for more portents or the arrival of Death himself."
John's answer to the last question was doubly correct. It made up for not correctly naming the day, or night, of the week, which was a comfort. Perhaps the ambulance was unnecessary for now.
Having bestowed a kiss on the smaller man’s forehead, Sherlock subsided. He felt justifiably smug over his progress in overcoming his irrational aversion to John’s indispostion. He was confident that John would be properly impressed and grateful when he was a little less cranky.
John's blue eyes seemed to grow cold, which was physically impossible, and yet the younger man felt distinctly chilled.
"Well, I never agreed to bed him. Not once. I prefer not to be a one-night diversion. And tonight, as usual, I politely declined both the offer of joining the hunt and the offer of
"She'wock! Ah don't mind," said John, "Ah weawy don't. You put up with my ova-sensitivities, so Ah think that can handle yo' so-called pathawogica’ ova-sensitivity.”
vampires, Sherlock," said Mycroft as if explaining something to a child. "They would never bite a human without written consent."
"Aunt Penelope!" interrupted Mycroft, gliding over to Sherlock and his aunt like a vampire from a cheap horror flick. "Have you met Sherlock's young man? He's in the kitchen, I believe, demonstrating his uncanny ability to make tea." Mycroft tugged at his Aunt's large, flabby arm and sent her off toward the kitchen, where most of the party had gathered, apparently to watch John Watson make cup after cup of perfect tea.
"John, you and Mrs. Hudson have given me numerous lessons on the care and feeding of human infants. I believe I can handle it."
But if Elizabeth was awake and crying in the middle of the night, then something was wrong; she must be ill.
"Actually, no. They do think you have been a bit too reserved and repressed. Molly says you're insecure. But no, they don't really blame you" said Sherlock with a pout, because everyone actually blamed him. "If you must know, they give me the lions share of the blame, because of...well, because of the time when I went away," admitted Sherlock. Both men frowned. "Sorry again."
"Yes, of course, that would be James," said the consulting detective offhandedly, because he was still trying to deduce the 'Why?'
And Sherlock was definitely blushing for some unfathomable reason. It was sort of cute. And kind of sexy...
John tugged the genius, who was still talking a mile-a-minute, pulled him down into heartfelt yet very chaste kiss.
The consulting detective drew the shorter man to his chest, while murmuring his name over and over, but his momentary relief fizzled as John stood stiff and motionless. The leprechaun didn't exactly resist Sherlock's embrace, but neither did he melt into the younger man's arms the way he usually did. In fact, John didn't even try to reciprocate the hug, which was very unlike the normally affectionate sprite.
His heart twisted uncomfortably in his chest. He wanted to believe that John had been driven into the storm due to the hellish inanity of the tea party; after all, Sherlock could fully sympathize with that. But there was that bit about a horn. And John had obviously risked using his ability to 'go unseen', despite the presence of all those party guests.
While Sherlock agreed in principal with John's intent, he didn't want to explain John's partial non-humanity to his relatives; therefore, it seemed best to distract John from the reprehensible Richard.
"You shouldn't go out there, Sherlock; that storm is getting worse," protested Mummy. "And the scones…"
Finding it difficult to face down his foe with a mouthful of hot, buttery scone, John was forced to back down, although he continued to send dark scowls at everyone—including Sherlock.
"Three. They're all three vampires," said John. "And I just told you; I didn't invite them; they invited themselves. The twins are Death's acolytes, so I suppose that explains why they're here. But I have no idea why Richard's here." John pursed his lips as he thought about it. "Nope. Nothing. I really have no idea why he showed up tonight, except to make my life miserable and upset the balance, which he did somehow. Twice, which is really bad. Bloody bloodsucking bastard."
'This stranger is even more cool than I,' the consulting detective thought with dismay. Then, wearing an obnoxious, Mycroft-ian smirk, the uber-cool stranger began dabbing at the coffee on John's already-sodden jumper with a small, embroidered tea towel.
"Yes," said Sherlock, "I thought a joke might break the tension. She's only made two hits, plus the one she did while she was carrying Elizabeth. You know, no one suspects that a pregnant woman could be dangerous. I think she may use that as a cover rather more frequently now."
"Papers which I forged for him as a favor to you," said Mycroft. "And his false identity could be destroyed as easily as it was created."
"Oh God!" choked John. Even if Sherlock didn't care who saw the mess in his hair, John did care. "Oh dear, God."
(Ah yes, New Jersey. No wonder Lestrade's computer was littered with Google searches for Atlantic City,) thought Sherlock with remarkable self-control. (The detective inspector plans to steal my best friend, my (almost) lover and my godchild (almost child). I could kill Lestrade...but that would make John unhappy, so no. I will not make John unhappy. Besides, I can hardly blame Gavin for falling in love with someone as wonderful as John Watson.)
John twisted his head, afraid for a moment to admit it, then he gave a little nod, "Yes. Yes, I do," affirmed the doctor with another nod for emphasis. "I love you, Sherlock."
"Ah can wiv with that,” said John, throwing a leg and arm around his detective in order to capture more body heat. He might also have wanted a hug, which Sherlock provided.
Sherlock didn't know why, and he didn't like not knowing. He blinked and ignored his mother's question.
Sherlock's lips pressed into a thin line as he considered the situation. (That Morstan woman has struck my John (yes, MY John) for the last time. I WILL intervene. I could initiate Operation: Goodnight Mary. Or, I could frame her for murder and let the police handle her of her, which would inevitably lead to the involvement of MI5, the FBI, the CIA, Interpol, MI6…But wait, I know! I will simply expose her recent hit on Boris 'the Barracuda'. No doubt Boris deserved to die, but still, her actions were illegal- manslaughter, if not murder, in the eyes of the law. Certainly, John Watson cannot complain if I am merely following the law and...'
John moaned loudly as his tongue battled with Sherlock's; there was no question that the moans had all come from John. But this time his moan drew a low, nearly subsonic rumble of need from his partner.
On top of everything else, Sherlock felt a tiny stab of guilt since he was actively avoiding his partner over a tiny blob of endodontic pustulence, which his partner couldn't have prevented. Or could John have prevented the infection? Sherlock was unsure.
First, he was moaning a lot. He'd never been this vocal before. He'd never been this hard before either.
"Horns…" murmured Mummy thoughtfully. "Maybe it's my sister Beatrice. She should have been here by now, and she
Of course it was impossible to see in the dark, but Sherlock assumed that his doctor must have begun scowling, because Sherlock easily detected a drop in room temperature.
"Mmmm," agreed Sherlock ambiguously. Then, just to make sure that John didn't trick him into any promises about quitting smoking altogether, Sherlock changed the subject. "What color do you want Elizabeth's room to be?"
"JESUS!" shrieked John, trying to drag the soiled bedclothes over his bits, and then over Sherlock's bits and then over his bits again, because the bedclothes were very tangled and uncooperative. Sherlock was unmoved, and he enjoyed one of the last cigarettes that he would smoke at 221b. He did not offer a cigarette to Mycroft.
After convincing Mrs. Hudson to make him fresh tea with sugar and a couple of bacon and cheese sandwiches (and after he promised not to pound on her door any more for the rest of the night), Sherlock returned to 221B. He was bored. Normally, he'd be watching one of those tedious reality shows, which were still consistently better than whatever ridiculous shows John wanted to watch—especially football. Occasionally, Sherlock found the reality shows mildly distracting when he could share his observations with an appreciative audience (as long as it was John). Perhaps, Sherlock would go so far as to say it was pleasant to watch the crap telly with a pliant, warm body snuggled up against him (as long as the warm body belonged to John). The detective felt odd, almost sad and practically lonely, but of course he had no reason to be sad or lonely. In all honesty, television was the new opiate for the masses and Sherlock didn't miss cuddling in the slightest. He was relieved, because now didn't have to watch the telly at all. He could do what ever he wanted. He could...finish his experiment...or play the violin!
The tempest seemed to last forever, but he knew it was only several minutes before the inchoate shrieks died down. The fierce wind began to slow and the thunder and lightning began to head eastward. The worst was past; the rain still came down but in decent, more normal, properly
That explains it, thought the detective, John got intoxicated (reason yet to be determined) and got into a brawl. Sherlock automatically looked down to examine John's other hand for bruised or bleeding knuckles. But both hands were fine. That was odd. John always gave as good as he got, unless he was jumped from behind and received a head injury or...
"Mycroft, keep an eye on the bloodsucker in the corner," said Sherlock loudly. "I have to go change John's clothes."
Sherlock Holmes was also content, possibly for the first time in his adult life. He smiled benignly at John's dirty blond head and Elizabeth's white-blond fuzz, each one nestled on one of his shoulders.
He studied his blogger and love of his life. Truth be told, his blogger looked downright frumpy. John's hair stuck up, as if he were a greying, blond hedgehog. He was un-shaven, unkempt, wearing a pair of Sherlock's too big pajama bottoms and Sherlock's oldest, well-worn dressing gown. The circles under the drowsing doctor's eyes were much too dark and his worry lines much too deep.
"The hell he is!" snapped Sherlock. No one was going to take John. Besides, the detective had enough of this talking duo that said nothing important and yet uttered it in such a ridiculous fashion.
However, Sherlock did not consider himself a gentleman. So he did peek, which suddenly made it imperative that he find a way to take advantage of John, even if he 'wasn't gay'. There had to be a way. Sherlock Holmes was a genius, so obviously he should be able to conceive of a way to not only seduce John Watson, but also to secure the affections of the former army doctor, before the hapless man fell into the clutches of yet another ruthless female predator.
Elizabeth snuffled, and worked her dummy; John drew closer, rubbing his face into his lover's shoulder with a little snort. 'Like father, like daughter indeed.'
The point being, John did not have that crazed, rabid my-daughter-is-sick and somebody-better-fix-it-now look on his face. So probably not sick then.
"Don't be daft!" snapped the blond. "Of course, I noticed she was working! And I didn't leave her because of her part-time nursing job. But now that she's back on her feet working and stuff, well, I just felt it was finally the right time, to leave her; you know?"
"For God's sake, Sherlock, it's obvious! He was struck by debris, just as we were." Mycroft gathered his soggy dignity and his outrage and lashed out at his brother's boyfriend. "As for you, Mr. Watson, you're a fool. You could have gotten yourself killed. You could have gotten Sherlock killed!"
"Well, she's a rogue, former CIA hit-woman, of course she's dangerous!" said Sherlock in a loud, annoying, half-whine.
"Sherlock, I have to tell you something. Something important," began John, placing his hands firmly on his knees to brace himself for any and all possible outcomes, which also augmented his display nicely. "Now, I'm not very good at this...at talking about my...about emotions, which," here his mouth pursed, "you know from...well from that time in the subway and at the airstrip and..."
with Cousin Avaril. It was grossly unfair. After years of her unwanted devotion towards Sherlock, why did Avaril choose tonight to stop mooning over Sherlock? And why did she have to choose Sherlock's boyfriend to crush on? And why did John have to flirt back, or at least be so damned polite to an admittedly lovely young woman? And why did she have to give them these too hot, overly strong mugs of caffeinated piss, which clearly had too much milk and probably no sugar added to them?
"No. No more sex for a few years, or at least not for a few hours. What was this operation called," asked the stubborn doctor.
"Sorry," mumbled John, looking sad. John always looked mournful at the least hint of any separation between him and Sherlock.
"I see. And who is after him? Did he steal from a criminal organization? Or is it worse; is he a deserter? Has he betrayed a governmental agency—perhaps the CIA?"
John leaned forward just a tiny bit, as he lowered the gun and put on the safety. "What awe you fussing about now?" The good doctor's brows were raised aggressively and his usually loving blue eyes had become downright glacial. He then leaned forward just that little bit more. Since he was clearly not about to kiss Sherlock, this was a bad sign. The genius backed up out of punching range.
Sherlock puffed on the second to last cigarette that he would ever smoke in the flat, now that little Elizabeth Shirley was moving in.
Where was John? What could he have been thinking? Another bolt of lightning struck nearby and the thunder crashed again. Sherlock bit his lip, looking in vain for clues. He despaired of finding anything in the gathering dark and heavy downpour.
"Ha, everyone knows Phillip can't perform magic," piped in young Leonora, turning against her cousin with true Holmesian disdain. Anything to gain attention, it was a familial fault. "It's not as though everyone didn't know that I was making the lights blink."
Then John smiled, unaware of how terribly Avaril brewed coffee. The blond sprite, whose gorgeous blue eyes were glued to Avaril's ugly green eyes, was just lifting the mug to his lips when a deep, velvety voice interrupted.
John frowned, clenching his injured hands; a tiny bit of light leaked out from his fists. "Yes, I did meet Fionn. I've met him many times, and obviously I lived to tell about it." The 'so there' remained in subtext.
"Yes, I was thinking about that, while watching the videos on tooth extractions and root canal procedures. Anyway, I think my discomfort is caused by my resentment that you are sick and unable to provide me with your usual supports such as tea and biscuits."
And then guilt, in the shape of a tiny, John-shaped angel, reared its affectionately smiling, self-righteous little head. No, a good partner did not abandon his partner post operatively said the little blond angel and Sherlock’s conscience in unison.
"What is your con man/boyfriend up to now?" snapped the bureaucratic brother. "Surely his tea isn't so spectacular that it merits applause."
"I know all about Mortimer coming, and if you're here to warn me, don't bother," said John, apparently dashing their hopes of stunning John with this news, as the leprechaun’s face creased into even more furrows of displeasure.
John was the doctor. John was supposed to take care of Sherlock; he wasn’t supposed to get sick himself. Frankly, the consulting detective found it difficult to deal with an under-the-weather John.
