After a pleasant, uneventful day, I went to the garden again before vespers to check on the bees. There was not much left in the garden at this time of the year, but I still wanted to make sure that the bees were fine. What would happen to them if Sherlock did not return to the monastery? On my way back, I came across Jonah in the cloister. He paced restlessly back and forth, his hands clasped behind his back. He looked up for a moment when he noticed me, but did not stop pacing. His nervousness was obvious.
Tears flowing freely, Mary spoke to John as she was escorted out with both elbows grasped firmly in two officers’ hands. “How could you? How could
I sighed. What was I doing here? Anyway, I could not escape the realization that I wanted this man - now that I knew that same-sex relationships were not alien to him, perhaps even more than ever before. Again and again I tried to persuade myself how wrong those images were that my mind developed at the mere thought of him, but somewhere in my heart a soft voice had come to life, which, like the a little devil, sat on my shoulder, telling me to try my luck.
John’s mouth fell open as he realized what Sherlock was telling him. John had lived in an agony of despair for the first year he thought Sherlock was dead but even in those time, he’d often gone out to clubs just to take his mind off his own suffering, picking up random women and shagging them desperately for a few minutes of relief from the nightmare of his life. He never stayed the night - always, he went back to the woman’s flat - and he never even bothered to get a number. Afterward he’d spend a week or two in misery then repeat the cycle. He was a sexual being; he could never have imagined abstaining even in his worst grief. By the time he met Mary, he’d forgotten how many different women he’d fucked since Sherlock. And now Sherlock, gorgeous man who could have his pick of men, was telling him that he’d remained celibate for
"Take this, it helps the nausea. I can give you something for the headache, too, then you will sleep better. "
"I don’t only believe that, but I am firmly convinced. And I should know it best, right? The monastic life is the best thing that could happen to him in this regard, because it relieves him of a burden he was never willing to bear. "
“Doctor Watson. To what do I owe the pleasure?” Mycroft said coolly. He obviously found no pleasure in hearing from John.
After dinner, the friars retreated for compline - the last prayer of the day - and for recreation, the time reserved for common leisure activities. I stood in the aisle, feeling a little helpless and tried not to call attention to myself.
"How do you know that I'm a doctor?" I asked back in a hoarse voice, before I cleared my throat again. Why did this man so upset me?
"Maybe we should let the subject go," I suggested, not having to think about the consequences of what I had just learned. "You said you needed my help - so how can I help you?"
Sherlock gave John’s neck a last soothing caress then rose quickly and picked up the box. He turned toward the door without another word.
Mycroft’s tone actually softened a bit. “I am sorry, but you see, John, based on your past behavior, I did indeed believe you’d grown tired of waiting. The string of girlfriends, the ease at which you’d
"I had a mission," I blurted out and then, when I realized what I had just said, I added what had never been so clear to me before: "My presence was important. My fellow soldiers trusted me, we were like a family, could rely on each other - everyone had their task, their place, their raison d'etre. It’s not that easy to replace. "
So much for that. I had been so confident that everything would turn out fine but now it was clear I’d have to pay for my carelessness in appropriating the name. I cleared my throat and tried to suppress the slight tremor in my voice, straightened up, and looked challengingly at him.
Sherlock grinned and nodded toward my left. My gaze wandered in disbelief to the skull, which had now found its place on the mantelpiece. It seemed to give me a mischievous grin.
, their sex life had been very fulfilling without the fuss and mess and preparation that anal sex entailed. And John would have been content to leave it that way. But if Sherlock wanted more - if Sherlock wanted
I glanced at my alarm clock and realized that I had to hurry; I did not want to arrive late for morning praise and thereby draw unwanted attention to myself. Actually, I was coming here to get away from my everyday stress for a while - and now the exact opposite came to pass. I felt completely stressed out, both on a physical, as well as on the spiritual level since my thoughts only seemed to revolve around William. I knew it had to stop right away - but since the nocturnal encounter I was even more confused than ever. How could this go on when we regularly ran into each other during the day? Assuming that he was not avoiding me after I had affronted him in such overbearing manner. Now that I was alone and my mind seemed to function normally again, I was ashamed to the depths of my soul for my foolish infatuation. The fact that I had meant no harm and just wanted to tease him did not make things better. Even as I walked down the hallway to the church, I made a decision: I would apologize to Brother William at the next available opportunity. It was up to him whether he was willing to forgive me or not …
Sherlock licked his lips and stared at the floor in front of him. “I can’t. They hate me there. My parents will send me back to school to finish my A levels and I can’t. I can’t go back there.” Tears sprang into his eyes. “They do terrible things, things I don’t want to … please. I don’t want to go back. Give me a job, I can wash your equipment or clean your buildings. Anything.”
He no longer knew what to think about any of it. About Sherlock, about Mary, and most of all about himself.
That explained a lot. But given Jonah's piety, could I assume that he'd told this man about his previous relationship with Brother William? If he was really serious about his beliefs, he should have mentioned that part of his past in his confession. However, he would have put William in dire straits if William had not done the same. I realized that I was on very thin ice and so I decided to change the subject.
I noticed that the young man’s right hand - unconsciously, it seemed to me - slipped over the white cord that was wrapped around his waist.
They were both laughing now, John leaning against the table and nearly collapsing in mirth and Sherlock rocking back and forth on his lab stool, giggling helplessly.
"If he actually had any feelings for me, then he would have behaved differently. You yourself have said that he is not a real monk, so he is not bound by vows - and even if that were the case, he has made it clear more than once made it clear what he thinks of vows of any kind. "
Sherlock sniffed. He wanted to fall at John’s feet and beg for his forgiveness but was honestly afraid of another assault if he tried. “What are you doing here then?” His voice sounded wet and raw even to his own ears. “Can we at least talk about this?”
I was well received, soon forming friendships - my superiors praised my work and my ability to keep a cool head even in difficult situations. Everything should have been perfect, but after a few months I was overcome by a strange sadness that I could find no explanation for. I would never have expected that it would get so far that my tangled emotions affected my work. I decided to call Ella, my therapist, who had helped me after the unexpected end of my combat operations. She had diagnosed me with post-traumatic stress disorder and advised me to write a blog in which I entered on everything that happened in my life - but unfortunately at that time it was not much, so I soon gave up the attempt.
“I do have things to do today,” John continued. “Get some clothes from Mary’s, talk to her, arrange to get the rest of my stuff.”
"Be dressed ready for service and keep your lamps burning, like servants waiting for their master to return from a wedding banquet, so that when he comes and knocks they can immediately open the door for him", quoted the well-known baritone voice. I watched intently as Brother William sat the candle which he held in his hands on the dresser, leaning against it and looking at me with arms crossed over his chest.
Well, fuck you very much, Sherlock Holmes, but John was sticking with the sure bet. Easy, steady, trustworthy Mary. Mary, who Sherlock had dragged into drama last night at the bonfire, risking her life on the back of a commandeered motorcycle, driving down staircases and along sidewalks.
?” Sherlock hated the warble of emotion that crept into his voice and hated it doubly that his brother was the one to hear it.
Sherlock turned back to the sink. “Yeah,” he muttered over his shoulder. At last the irritating woman moved on, probably to terrorize other minimum wage workers who had the bad luck to work in this wretched kitchen.
When he spoke that fact so clearly, for the first time in a long time, I realized again that I was staying here for a short time as a guest - and that my time was slowly but surely coming to an end. Would I still be able to keep contact with Jonah and all the other people I’d come to love after that? Assuming Jonah was what he pretended to be ... but I could not seriously doubt that at the moment. All these thoughts crossed my mind as I answered the Prior's question with a sad nod.
Jerkily, I turned to him and would have liked to scream all my fury straight into his face had it not been covered by the veil of a beekeeper's hat. The man wore the usual beekeeping clothing, matching the decorative beehive made of woven straw which stood next to him on the stall’s table. It was only when I went closer that I saw that he was leaning on a walking stick and suddenly felt compassion for him. Maybe he was dependent on the proceeds from selling his honey, otherwise he could not do any regular work due to his injury. And it wasn’t his fault his wares aroused painful memories in me. With a soft sigh, I approached the table.
"I want to look after Brother Jonah again," I explained my abrupt disappearance and received some glances. Greetings and blessings were given to me on my way out, then I headed in the direction of the sick-room.
For so long, Sherlock had avoided even the most casual touch. He’d avoided John’s whiskey-foul kisses. He’d avoided their big bed, coming in late and either staying up through the night making notes for his latest choreography or falling asleep on the sofa with his mobile on his chest. And sex, when they bothered at all, was just a hurried
I had no thought for food after this conversation; my stomach still clenched at the thought of what Prior Lambert had heard of my conversation with Brother William. It could not be much different than it had looked. A little distance would probably not hurt both of us, so I vowed inwardly to hold back in the future and to stop making contact with him. Ultimately, reason prevailed - and it was clear that it was not appropriate to woo a man of God.
"Jonah, please - I do not want to disappoint you, especially not after what you've done for me. It is really not your fault, but ... "
John rubbed a hand down his face. He stood and followed Lestrade toward the front door, followed by Sherlock. John could hear the reassuring sound of Sherlock’s footfalls behind him. He paused to pull the door shut then continued down the steps after Lestrade. When he reached the bottom of the short staircase, John realized that Sherlock was no longer at his back. He turned to find Sherlock slumped on the top step, head hung low, elbows propped on his knees with both hands buried in his hair. John climbed the few steps to him.
The answer to my unspoken question came in the form of Mycroft Holmes, who eventually appeared behind Sherlock and announced that it was time to leave.
Sherlock carefully got to his knees and climbed over John’s leg to settle behind his back. John rolled to his side facing away from Sherlock. He let his top knee fall forward, opening his arse for Sherlock, nervous but excited at the same time. But Sherlock gently lifted John’s leg and stacked it on top of his bottom leg. Sherlock made a quiet shushing sound. John bit his lip, confused and a little alarmed at what his unpredictable flatmate might have planned. He craned his neck as far as possible and saw that Sherlock’s hand was around his cock, lining it up with John’s opening. Alarmed, John nearly whined, “Sherl…”
And he’d thought that falling into a ‘relationship’ with Mary had helped. Now he realized that he and Mary really didn’t have a relationship. It was more that Mary led and he followed. He just went along with what she wanted so that he wouldn’t have to be alone.
The chill he felt turned to fury at her presumptuousness. What kind of person would do such a thing?
From his expression, I gathered that I was threatened with expulsion even before I had unpacked my stuff, so I tried to regain control over myself.
He stood, slipped his mobile into his jacket pocket and calmly pushed in his chair. Someone was waiting who wouldn’t snipe, rave, and sneer and Sherlock couldn’t get out fast enough.
Sherlock straightens, with his patented ‘I’m-highly-offended’ look. Before he can bluster out a response, John continues. “I have good memories of peppermint schnapps. It’s the first alcohol I ever had - Harry too, but that didn’t turn out so well, did it? At Christmas my mum would make hot cocoa with peppermint schnapps. She’d put whipped cream on top and crush up peppermint candies, sprinkle it on top. My grandparents and aunts and uncles loved it. And for the kids - Harry, the cousins, me - she’d make some up in special Christmas mugs with just a teaspoon of schnapps, and extra candy on top.”
Both intended to just rest silently for a while and enjoy the other’s heat. Minutes stretched in silence became regular breathing and before either realized, they slipped into a peaceful sleep in the afternoon sunlight streaming through the window.
After Brother Jonah did not appear for vespers or dinner, I seriously began to worry about him. Presumably, it would not hurt anyone if I unobtrusively inquired of Father Christopher for the whereabouts of the novice, since he himself had previously contacted me, because he was worried about the young man. I looked at the clock; it was just before seven so I would probably find the Father in the lounge. Carefully, I opened the door, pushed as inconspicuously as possible into the room, which was populated by the majority of the friars, and looked around. By now most of the faces were familiar to me, even though I could not immediately assign the right name to everyone. There was Brother Elijah, the cook, who was in conversation with one of the novices, who had helped him more often in the kitchen and probably also had some interest in this regard. Father Andrew stood by the fireplace with two other priests, saying something that made his interlocutors smile ... and there was Father Christopher. He sat in one of the armchairs and studied the daily newspaper. Just when I looked over at him, he looked up so that our eyes met. As soon as I started to walk towards him, he put aside his paper and stood up.
"Dr. Watson, I do not want to tempt you to violate your secrecy, but ... If there is something I - something we can all do to help him, then I would be very grateful if you would tell me. "
I could not resist a derisive grin; it all seemed to me like the confirmation of an old stereotype. The friar did not respond to it, instead he put down his beekeeper's hat and gloves and stowed everything in a closet. When I was no longer expecting an answer and wondering why he had brought me here at all, if he still could not speak to me, he surprised me at last.
- happier than he’d felt since weeks before Sherlock had jumped off Bart’s. The absence of his now-released resentment and anger left him feeling light, like me might just float right off the bed. But that would mean leaving Sherlock - which just wasn’t tolerable. He turned his head into Sherlock’s and nuzzled the side of Sherlock’s stubbly jaw with the tip of his nose. Then he drew back and met Sherlock’s laughing-bright eyes.
Sherlock felt the shift in John. He released his grip on John’s still-weeping erection and instead gripped John's hip as he began to move, slowly and carefully thrusting his cock between John’s muscular thighs.
“You’re not going anywhere. And I’m not going to share you with Sherlock. You had your fun, now let it go.
"Jonah, you've got a concussion, it's not a good idea to read now - you're overburdening your brain with it. It would be better if you were sleeping a lot. And if you would eat something. You hardly touched the soup. "
“It’s either this, or invite her to your folks’ house for Christmas.” John’s tone was no more merry than Sherlock’s.
"His condition is unchanged ... bad. I did not speak to a doctor, but ... the way it seems to be now ... "
Week after week passed and I tried to delete the man who had been the center of my life not so long ago. In the meantime, I persuaded myself to contact Jonah, who, angered he learned that Mycroft had not contacted me, had provided me with Mycroft's telephone number. When I hung up with Jonah, I hesitated only for a moment before I dialed Mycroft’s number. After the second ring the connection went dead. Incredulous, I stared at my mobile’s display, which quite innocently read "call ended." I tried it two more times that day and then several times in the following days, each at different times - the result remained the same.
We entered a small room next to the kitchen, which had formerly been a storage room, but which was now home to two things: dried herbs, hanging from the ceiling in small bunches, and a barrel-like wooden utensil in a corner of the room that stood on the floor. Brother William walked over towards the strange-looking item and opened the lid.
"I put the words in his mouth, so to speak," Sherlock joked from his chair, evidently looking forward to this joke most of all.
I must have looked terribly appalled, for Sherlock raised his hands in a placating gesture. He continued to sign, "The nerves in my arms and legs are not responding as they should. My arms are only sometimes a bit stiff, but my legs... "
I swallowed unconsciously, because the whole situation suddenly seemed so personal and familiar, not only because he had renounced the formal salutation.
He glanced at the file folder in his other hand. Sherlock had said it was his explanation and apology. Right now John wasn’t in the mood for either. It was still early. He’d pop round to his old pub, have a pint before opening the file.
“You said you kept an eye on him! You must have known about the woman! Why didn’t you tell me that he was
Mycroft notices, of course. First he notices that his brother often displays a sucking-a-lemon expression, the middle of his lips turning upward while the corners of his mouth turn down. After observing for a few weeks, Mycroft deduces that Sherlock is actually trying to stiffle smiles. He takes his brother aside and advises him to let it out, that he’s waited long enough to be happy so go ahead and indulge. After all, if Sherlock chooses to get involved, he might as well jump in with both feet.
. Every cab ride was exciting when Sherlock sat beside him. Every restaurant dinner was a special occasion when he shared it with Sherlock. Walking the streets of London beside Sherlock made every step special. He’d never felt that way with Mary and knew he never would. He sighed and scrolled down.
John spent a very long time suffering. He had no idea that over 400 messages were waiting for him at a secure website that only he and his ‘dead’ flatmate knew about (and dead flatmate’s older brother, who had promised the dead flatmate he would not meddle). But really, only his dead flatmate knew about it, since the bump to John’s head had wiped the memory of two-thirds of their last conversation from his memory.
John pulled out Sherlock’s chair, quickly cutting off Sherlock’s speech. “Dinner’s all ready. Pour the wine while I get it.”
While everyone else joked and laughed with each other, I kept my eyes on Sherlock, to see if he needed anything else, to offer him tea and scones, and to keep close to him. At some point I felt him inconspicuously grab my hand under the table and I squeezed back vigorously. How was I supposed to live with heartbreak of ever letting go?
"That ... that is the letter, Brother Jonah's letter! I saw him in the living room only yesterday! What do you want with it and why did you ... "
John shook his head. “I need to get home. I didn’t even tell Mary where I’d be. She’s got to be worried.”
The blond took a quick look at it, then put the letter aside. "I have no relatives, my friends would not address their mail to 'Brother Jonah' and my birthday is  only next week. I’ll take a look at it later, now I have to beat the great champion here in chess. "
"You can do as little as I can right now. He's in good hands and I'm sure you'll get information from the Prior tonight that William is well and he'll be back soon. Don’t worry."
"No," I held him back as he was about to lay his head on the pillow, "On your side, I have to clean the wound. Careful, don’t move too fast. "
"I don’t like to waste too much time with useless talk, so I want to get to the point. I don’t know what's going on between you and Brother William, and I'm not really concerned. But the matter is different when the interests of the Order are involved, and that is precisely what I worry about at the moment. "
"I told him that, but he refuses to take anything else. I was glad he ate some rice and vegetables yesterday. I'm really worried about him. It's time for him to eat with us again. "
It had only been a short sentence, almost casual, but spoken with a seriousness that left no doubt that it was not a mere proposal but a statement that I had to follow. I could not risk losing my job sooner or later.
to love her that way. Maybe an effortless affection was what he needed. That’s what he told himself from the moment he woke until he fell asleep. He was done with grand love. - it just lead to grand drama.
"That's quite simple: If I suddenly disappear, that will be noticeable. But if you skip the morning praise after a hard day ... well ... "
He shrugged his shoulders indecisively . "Of course it’s difficult to be obedient if you notice that the superiors are obviously making stupid decisions..."
Now I sat in Ella’s office for the first time in five months and felt as exposed as a lab rat on a dissecting table.
Suddenly tired of the mountain of never-said things built up between them, John spoke without forethought. “Do you want a divorce?”
I got up and tried to pull him up but he fought me, if only weakly. When Father Andrew entered the room at that moment, he seemed to be able to grasp the situation at once.
Actually, I did not want to meet him today, I was much too upset to be able to cope with this situation.
"I refuse to believe that Jonah could have done such a thing," he growled, slipping a silver tablespoon into a napkin and placing it next to the bowl.
"You're so beautiful," I breathed. It did not bother me in the least that that slipped out, "If you knew how long I've been waiting for this moment."
Anger burned in the pit of John’s stomach - anger at Mycroft for never telling him that Sherlock had faked his death. How could the man have thought it appropriate to let John think that Sherlock was dead? How could Mycroft have let him wallow in misery for months and months without giving him at least a hint that it had all been staged? John’s hands clenched. What had Mycroft been playing at? Why had he pulled away almost as soon as Sherlock’s ‘funeral’ was over? Why had Mycroft let him mourn, when it was evident to everyone who even slightly knew John that he was drowning in grief?
Just at that moment, the bell struck to call all in the monastery to midday prayer, interrupting me in the middle of the sentence. But instead of waiting at least for a moment, he left his book and disappeared towards the chapel.
Shaking his head roughly, Sherlock finally spoke. “It’s not. Okay. She… the gun. She could have shot you.” He released his grip on his hair and lifted his face to meet John’s eyes. “And I just stood there. All I could do was make a call. And you had a gun pointed at your heart.”
so ... But how could I find out if I was not mistaken? Could I dare to simply approach him and start a conversation? He had told me his baptismal name so maybe I should address him thus? After all, he had left it up to me to choose …
It seemed to me an eternity had passed since he’d smiled widely and had spoken decently - now the façade was slowly but unstoppably crumbling.
She smiled happily and instead of grabbing my outstretched hand, she pulled me straight into her arms.
Sherlock left his glass in its place on the table. “Sorry, can’t raise my arm that high. Gunshot wound, broken ribs mending, all of that. You know.”
, and they’d spent the night entwined together, sleeping peacefully after blazing-hot sex. He felt an answering smile stretch across his face and couldn’t have stifled it if he’d wanted. “It is a good morning,” he murmured and kissed Sherlock again and again.
Sherlock held John’s gaze for a long moment before answering, “Later. I’ll tell you, later. Just. Not now,” and dipping his head once again to kiss John and press his knee between John’s legs again. Sherlock’s hands deftly dealt with John’s belt and flies. “Bed,” he murmured between kisses and John wholeheartedly agreed, pressing Sherlock away gently and preceding him down the hallway to the bedroom, kicking off his jeans and shucking his shirt along the way.
"I'm not sure ..." I added timidly, I’ve got a job I enjoy, nice colleagues with whom I go and have a drink now and then ..." A smile crossed my face as I thought of Sarah, an extremely likeable young doctor I worked with in the emergency room who always wore an expression of serenity even if chaos erupted around her.
"Then you should let me bandage the wound properly. Okay?" I asked, pointing to his injured leg. This time he raised no objections.
Two years of a half-life. Then a new nurse started working at the clinic. Mary was witty, bright, pretty and from her first day she’d pursued John with a singular focus. While he admired her, at first he wasn’t interested – wasn’t alive enough to want to date anyone. Eventually she’d worn down his resistance.
He shook his head and turned to go ahead of me; he seemed to have aged years in the last few days, as I noticed only now. Even if he made the impression yesterday evening that he had everything under control, his exhaustion was clearly visible.
His own experiences with unexplained healing gave John hope that his body had somehow healed itself. But he wasn’t a fool. The first thing he did when he returned to work after the honeymoon was order fertility tests on his own semen.
Even before I could think about it, Jonah surprisingly signed with his hands and  formed silent words with his lips, changing his expression from time to time, never taking his eyes off Sherlock. Fascinated, I looked first to him and then to his dark-haired interlocutor, who then broke out into a strange-sounding, raucous laugh and then answered the same way.
The sight of him made me freeze in my tracks. Distributed around his bed, I did not see just the usual monitoring equipment showing his vital signs; no, far from it - I was fully aware of how serious his condition was when I saw the respirator, the stomach tube and the dialysis machine. I stood in the door for a few minutes staring at the dark-haired man who suddenly seemed so small and fragile among all these machines. I approached his bed, pushed past the heart monitor and stopped beside his upper body. So far, I'd never seen him in any clothing other than his habit, and I had to admit that seeing him wearing only a hospital gown was extremely disconcerting, his bare arms pierced with cannulas.
Sherlock shook his head. He laid his hand over John’s and squeezed. “Hard to believe, but I really wasn’t thinking of anything.”
My voice was scarcely more than a whisper when I looked away, ashamed. I could not look into his eyes for another second. Brother William, however, did not leave me alone; now he was the one who sighed.
"Francis was amazingly talkative when my brother and his people interrogated him. And when Mycroft knew who to look for, it was only a matter of time before he closed the net. "
He gave a derogatory snort and twisted the corners of his mouth, as if I had told a particularly bad joke.
Overjoyed, the Jonah breathed a soft 'thank you', grabbed the offered hand, and bowed briefly. The older man patted him on the back of his hand as if the happy news had been only a formality for him. In his swinging step, however, it was quite easy to see that he was very happy about the decision.
God, the excitement of it all. Each time could lead to so many different feelings: dominance, submission, tenderness, roughness, making love, or fucking. John missed it.
I focused on the prayers of the Book of Hours and did my best to join in the right places; yet I could do nothing to keep my eyes from constantly wandering, looking for a face that seemed so familiar already, as if it was an old friend's face. I thought I found the dark curly head in one of the back rows, but I could not say with certainty whether they were the curls I searched for due to the dim light.
It was almost an automatism that made me dip two fingers into the holy water, then made the sign of the cross over my forehead and upper body.
"How can you know it all?" I looked at Sherlock. He could not have learned such a complex language in addition to his theological training, right?
Groaning in response, John wondered how ever he thought he could have lived without this. This excitement, this wild flame, this live circuit between them. How could he ever have thought he could have been with anyone but Sherlock, after he found out that Sherlock had never died? Groaning again, John reached up and buried his hands in Sherlock’s hair. He scratched Sherlock’s scalp none-too-lightly with his nails, eliciting an answering groan from deep in Sherlock’s throat. Moving his hands to Sherlock’s chest, John opened Sherlock’s buttons as quickly as his fingers could move. Soon the shirt hung loosely at Sherlock’s sides and John’s hands moved to the warm skin at Sherlock’s waist. “Sherlock,” he murmured, “I am sorry.”
When I entered the seminar room two hours later, the novices were already present. Jonah, too, who I had almost forgotten during the day, was sitting in his place, drawing on the edge of his writing pad with a ballpoint pen, I could see geometrical shapes, squiggles, and wavy lines that merged into one another in a confused pattern, but without making a recognizable picture.
I had to admit that I was immensely delighted at the prospect of eating in silence - how long had that been my wish? In the army, in the hospital ...I’d always been exposed to loud noises while eating and I’d found it extremely disturbing as long as I could remember.
Father Andrew nodded as I said good-bye, while a blush crept up my cheeks - he had to have noticed that I wasn’t holding a book ...
And now, fresh from the barber, his shorn and pomaded hair slicked straight back from his forehead, Sherlock felt like a new man. Fresh, unbound, unfettered from his past indiscretions. He’d been clean for years - it was finally time to look like it.
Sherlock looked away, sorrow and hurt transparent in his frown. “I don’t know. I can’t see the pattern. It’s too nebulous.” Sherlock folded his hands behind his back and dropped his chin. He didn’t want John to see the tears gathering in his eyes. This was not what he’d imagined their first private conversation would go. He closed his eyes tight against the images he’d held over the past two years, of he and John’s reunion at Baker Street. He turned his back to John and cleared his throat. “So, then. What we had … it’s over?” he asked without turning, trying to keep his voice from shaking.
"I am well aware that pride is a mortal sin, but you have to admit that I drew you quite well," he added with a wink, "maybe I'll give it to Brother William when I'm done with it."
"Then Francis never had anything to do with the drugs and did it all voluntarily because he's so homophobic?"
He looked extremely nervous, which was quite understandable in view of the previously allegations against him. But would the brothers actually be guided in their decision by the events of the last days and take this as an opportunity to refuse him full admission to the Order? I could only hope with him that this would not be the case.
“Serbia,” Sherlock murmured, cutting off John’s thought before he could finish it. “A few did reopen from hitting the ground on my back, but it wasn’t much.”
My last week behind the monastery walls was extremely quiet. I had intended to continue to visit Sherlock at least every other afternoon, but the day after our conversation, Mycroft Holmes left a message for me that I did not need to make my way back to the hospital; Sherlock was moved to a rehab facility in Sussex and would contact me when he felt better. The tone of his message was as cold and emotionless as he was, but I was grateful that he had informed me. I was now able to spend the remaining time with the brothers, without any guilty conscience, and to rest a little, which had actually been my primary goal from the very beginning.
Sherlock paused on his way out of the kitchen. He spun to face John. His mouth dropped open, caught off guard by John’s question. He held both hands in front of his chest as if he were fending off a blow and stepped back, away from the ugly question.
Wow, I can't believe how long it's been since I posted anything to AO3. Life kicked me around a bit but I'm still kicking back. If anyone is still interested in this fic, I will be posting the rest of the translated chapters over the next few days. For anyone who stuck around - THANK YOU!
of the situation overwhelmed John.  Waves of agony broke over him and he cried silently, mourning what he and Sherlock had lost.
"I funded my studies by a temporary job at the Microsoft service hotline - you have no idea of how much sensitivity you learn at that job every day. The phrase 'I'm sorry, but I cannot do anything more for your PC, you can only format the hard drive and reinstall the operating system now' has a similar effect on some people as dead pet. "
"Anyway, that's what made him leave me alone. He left without saying goodbye to me and I hadn’t heard from him in months. Just before I left, I contacted Mycroft because I wanted to say goodbye to Sherlock and apologize to him, but he just told me that his brother was unavailable and I should not continue to contact him. And that's what I stuck to. "
, crossed my mind in a moment of cynicism. His eyes were closed, but his chest rose and fell on its own in a steady rhythm, accompanied by the steady beep of the heart monitor. I pulled up a chair and sat down beside his bed.
. As soon as I’d entered the room for the first time, I’d had the feeling that a very special person lived here - what Jonah had told me about him just confirmed that guess. As before, my eyes fell on the skull, watching the room from its shelf and making fun of me with its fixed grin. I could not understand how anyone would put something like that on a shelf. Memento mori - remember that you have to die - was a phrase that was associated with medieval monasticism, but why someone who’s monastic life wasn’t more than a role he played kept a -undoubtedly authentic - human skull in his room in such a prominent place, I could not fathom.
However, there was still something that I needed to ask: "What reason would a friar have to take a vow of silence? Or does he decide himself? "
Mycroft had complained the loudest when Violet proposed doing Christmas dinner at home. “We never do Christmas,” he’d said, words dripping with sarcasm.
"If I have to ... but first I will go over to the church and pray for him - I will not let anyone stop me doing that."
When I returned to my room at half past eight, I noticed for the first time just how tired I was. I would simply have to rest a little, until I would be awakened by the bells, whose sound was pretty hard to ignore. Only a little doze, a tiny nap ...
"Someone," I replied, and, to avoid misunderstandings, quickly added, "Brother William lent me a book, and I want to give it back to him."
“John,” she said in her ‘we have something a bit not good to discuss’ voice. “There’s something I’ve been meaning to bring up.” She wrung her hands, obviously waiting for a sign from John before she continued.
“Stop giving me that look,” Sherlock growled. He took control again, fitting his mouth against John’s and tracing the inside of John’s lower lip with the tip of his tongue.
Sherlock answered without hesitation. “I know. And I, you.” He laughed again, a sound of pure joy from deep in his chest and scooted his body down the bed until he could rest his cheek against John’s shoulder.
The little celebration ended with a communal meal. I didn’t want to give up my place next to Sherlock. As seldom as I would see him in the future, I wanted to savor every minute we shared, even though, of course, given the presence of his former confreres, we were unable to show our newly discovered affection. The brothers were also more than pleased to see him again, and used the opportunity for encouraging words and wishes for recovery, which he politely acknowledged with a smile.
Immediately the curly headed man turned from me and stormed over to the blond, stopped in front of him, sucked in air once and made a disgusted face. It seemed as if he was going to pull Jonah up and take him with him, so I felt compelled to intervene again.
I had not bothered to report, at least to Jonah, that we had expressed our love to each other. I didn’t expect him to tease me about the 'domestic happiness' that would await me as soon as 'my future' finished rehab and I moved in with him.
"The poison was completely removed from his skin. In the event that it had already done damage, he was given an antidote for safety. Presumably it is thanks to your immediate intervention that my brother is still alive. "
A tear slipped from John’s eye and splashed onto his jumper. He was too weary, too ashamed to even lift a hand to wipe away its track. “Yeah, I sound like rubbish. I guess I am. My only defense is that I really did believe Sherlock had killed himself. I didn’t know why, I didn’t understand any of it.”
"Sherlock. But he belongs to a monastic order, so it could be that he registered under his religious name. William. "
He picked up a file folder from the table beside his chair; he’d prepared it when he couldn’t sleep the night before. In it was a flash drive with the recorded telephone conversation from Bart’s roof. Also included was a transcript of it. And he’d typed a page with all the information for the secure website that John didn’t remember:  the URL, John’s username and password. He’d been tempted to print out all the messages it contained and include them in the file, but he couldn’t bear the thought of their contents. Best to let John decide when and how he’d read them –
"The evidence was right in front of your nose, John. Most people see but they do not observe. I wrote down everything I knew until Francis' attack on me and hid it in front of everyone - I was so sure that at least
Hesitantly, he rose and helped me up, then bent down, picked up the candle and held it between us, looking deeply into my eyes. This time I held his gaze consciously. His lip twitched as if he wanted to say something but instead he sighed softly, shaking his head gently.
"The bandage pulled on the hair," he mumbled, gently fingering the edges of the wound, as if he had completely forgotten about my presence.
This time, when he finished, I went over to him, wrapped my arms around his waist, and laid my head on his shoulder, enjoying the warmth of his body, lost in the peculiar smell of sleep, sandalwood, and fabric softener.
Sherlock swallowed, raised his chin a notch then answered. “I found a weakness in your perimeter security. I wasn’t trying to steal anything, just looking for a place to sleep.” Sherlock played up his posh British accent, putting it on rather thicker than he usually did in America.
The haircut had been hateful and the uniform itched but in the end the joke was on Mycroft. The other delinquents also sent to military school by desperate families had taught Sherlock tricks he would have never thought up on his own. And 250 boys between the ages of 13 and 18, locked away at a school in western Connecticut, all of whom would have had criminal records if their families had not had the money and connections to get their indiscretions discharged, together had quite a bag of tricks to trade. Alcohol, drugs, cigarettes, sex, pornography - everything was available for a price.
The large leather desk chair squeaked under his weight as he sat down. He picked up the salmon from the dinner plate with his fingers since he’d neglected to nick a fork. As he chewed, he pulled open drawers in the desk. He found a pistol in the first drawer, a Sig Sauer 9mm semi. He popped the magazine and ejected the chamber, then inserted the ejected cartridge back into the magazine while he chewed another bite. He slid the magazine back into place and set the safety before he wedged it into the small of his back between the waistband of his jeans and his pants. The next drawer yielded a fat cellophane baggie of cocaine. Sherlock licked his pinky, stuck it into the white powder then took a quick taste. Smiling,he stuck the baggie into his sock. The other drawers held nothing of interest so Sherlock shut them quickly, finished off his dinner and slipped out of the office.
The prior led me to the room that would be my accommodation for the next few weeks. It was bright and friendly but at the same time, as I’d expected, very spartan with a narrow bed and a small dresser. A wooden crucifix hung above the head of the bed. Otherwise the walls were bare.
“Watson, you simply must try these most excellent chocolate biscuits Mrs. Hudson brought up while you were out.” Holmes held out the plate of sphere-shaped sweets toward Watson, who eagerly took one.
Sherlock slowly slid his way into John’s lap, his long legs wrapped over the arm of the chair. He fitted his forehead into the space where John’s neck met his shoulder. “Care to tell me about it?”
Quickly I scanned the page that indicated the date in the left column and the names of the visitors in the right column. If this Mycroft Holmes had already been here, it would be an advantage if my signature would look as similar to his own. However, today only four visitors were registered and none of them bore the name Holmes. I tried to write as neatly as possible, because only an elegant font seemed to fit the picture of the rich brother in my mind . I would have to work on overcoming my prejudices later.
“Sherlock,” John said, his voice a little sharp. “I owe it to her to explain. I don’t know what Mycroft’s been telling her these past few days but I’m sure she’s worried sick with wondering where I am. We’ve been living together, I was going to ask her to… well, you know. I have to go see her. Today.”
I stood in front of a high wooden gate that was set pleasantly harmoniously into a wall of light-colored sandstone - and yet I hesitated to put my finger on the brightly polished brass doorbell and push it in the designated recess. Had I really considered well enough
"I hope I didn’t scare you that much?" He asked and patted me on the shoulder, smiling. This man had an incredibly sympathetic way and even if I had imagined that my break from work would be a little more relaxed, I was still firmly convinced that I’d be able to gain valuable experience here.
, when I had spoken to him in the library and he had pierced me with his eyes, as if to penetrate the depths of my soul. He must have seen something in me, perhaps even something I could not see myself. During our second meeting, he had, within a moment, deduced my entire past from the few facts available to him. Had he realized that I felt drawn to him? My heartbeat accelerated, however, and my skin began to blaze, I breathed heavily, sweat broke out on my forehead and I ran almost panicky to the window, tore it open, bent out of the frame and breathed deeply several times.
"I would like to have a computer tomography performed to rule out cerebral haemorrhage," he said after completing the examination.
"That's normal," Brother Jonah said eventually, "brothers and sisters argue, that's all that." He cast a knowing glance to Brother William that twisted his lips into a knowing grin. He seemed to laugh to himself. I was almost a little jealous that the two seemed to share a secret that I was not allowed to participate in.
“Sherlock, I’m not sure there is anything you can do. After this amount of time, I’m not sure there would be any physical evidence to show on a CT scan. John believes you tricked him. It’s unlikely he’ll take your word that you told him your plan.”
John loves it when Sherlock neglects to shave for a few days. He loves feeling the drag of Sherlock’s scruffy beard against his face, his neck, his belly. It makes him feel manly - unmistakable that he’s loved by the cleverest man in Britain.
"Okay..." Finally he started moving. All I could hear was the swishing sound of his shoes on the wooden floor.
“You tit.” John affectionately tugged at the dried paint in Sherlock’s hair. “You’re just afraid someone will find out you’re human after all.”
Propping on his hands, Sherlock leaned over John to kiss him deeply, filing John’s mouth with his tongue, his taste, filling all of John’s senses with
John wasn’t able to stop his mouth from twisting. “I didn’t used to have to tell you. You used to know. You used to make the
Sherlock looked up cooly. “Perhaps if you’d given me advance notice, I could have rearranged my schedule.”
” John knew the public rooms of the safehouse had to be under surveillance. He didn’t spot the cameras so he spun in the living room, shouting Mycroft’s name over and over.
I shook my head, unwilling to accept what Jonah was trying to tell me. If that was actually the case, it would change everything - not only would Sherlock have to rethink his future plans, but of course I would, too. As much as I longed for his closeness, I was still bothered by the question of whether I was ready for a relationship. And what would become of Jonah and his friendship with Sherlock? Even if a friar's life was what he yearned for, it would surely take him a lot of strength to accept that his ex-boyfriend, who had always stood by his side and protected him, would be far away from him. They would probably see each other only very rarely and ...
I snorted. Actually, I wasn’t willing to talk about a man who was still struggling with death and over whose bed I had just shed bitter tears, but the realization that he had been fooling me from the beginning hurt.
Finally he turned his face toward me. I started a moment when I registered the dark circles under his eyes.
Sherlock was stunned when Saul lead him to a black Mercedes. He’d expected to ride in a pickup truck or even one of the smaller flatbed trucks parked in rows. Saul hit the door unlock button and waited  for Sherlock to fold himself into the passenger seat. “Buckle your seatbelt. There’s a new state law, you can get a ticket if you don’t buckle up.”
When Mary suggested he move into her townhouse in the suburbs, he’d just gone along. It was the path of least resistance and maybe a little
"Thank God!" Jonah exclaimed. He rushed over to his mentor and fell around his neck, which seemed to confuse the other man very much.
"Right, I have no idea what is upsetting you but I know where this binge can lead. One damages oneself to an extent which one can not estimate at all. And in the worst case, you harm others. "
I swallowed. Apparently Brother William was not the only one in trouble today. I followed the Prior to his office and sat down in the chair in front of his desk. He sighed, laid his folded hands on the table and looked at me.
Grabbing Sherlock’s arms, John shouted up into his face. “It’s not just my income, you cock. It’s our income. It’s our job now, not just yours.”
He was monosyllabic, but by now I had learned that he was always like that when his thoughts had not quite reached the here and now; a peculiarity that I did not take personally. Still, I hesitated, unsure if I would ask too much from him with the request I wanted to make of him. I cleared my throat.
Stroking alongside the outermost bandage with the tip of his index finger, John made a sympathetic sound. “Christ, Sherlock. That night, at the restaurant...”
"Excuse me for the disturbance, I’m looking for Mr. Sherlock Holmes, he is said to have lived in this street, but unfortunately I don’t know the ..."
The answer was different, however, than I expected. Brother Francis, whom I had asked because he was familiar with me from novice lessons, seemed almost embarrassed when I asked him whether there was any reason why Brother William had neither appeared for dinner nor was present. He avoided me, muttered that he did not know exactly what had happened, then retreated quickly behind the his daily newspaper.
John released his softening cock from their grip and threaded his fingers between Sherlock’s. Holding tightly, John brought their sticky hands to his chest and pressed them against his hammering heart. Happiness bubbled in his chest and erupted as a giggle. He felt Sherlock sift away slightly, just enough for John to turn onto his back. John rolled his shoulder as he lay on his back with Sherlock still pressed against his side and their hands still grasped together on John’s chest.
John’s never felt anything like it in his life. He’s wanted before, he’s lusted, he’s walked so close to the edge he thought he’d combust. But those times were all with soft, yielding, plump-in-all-the-right-places women. All of them.
“My treat. I used to spoil you, remember? Even if it meant skipping lunch for a week, I’d buy you little treats.” John smiled fondly at the memory of how thrilled Sherlock had been at the smallest treat when they were just starting out - a jar of really good raspberry jam, a single daisy, a few sheets of fine writing paper. It used to take so little to make Sherlock happy.
I kept the promise I had given to Brother Jonah and visited him again the next morning. As I entered the room, I saw him kneel in his white tunic before his bed, the opened book of hours lying on the bed, and, gazing at the crucifix hanging on the wall above his bed, quietly muttering prayers. I just wanted to turn away and quietly leave the room and not disturb him as he loosened his intertwined fingers, crossed himself and slowly rose, with the headache obviously still causing him great difficulties.
"This is John Watson," I said breathlessly. "Could I speak to Prior Lambert, please? Or Father Andrew? It is important!"
Mary was warm, comfortable, easy in bed. As far as John was concerned there was no bad sex. It was effortless with Mary, just falling into a routine of kiss-fondle-intercourse-cuddle without much effort on either of their parts. He’d just sort of gone along. It was like they’d been together for years instead of months.
“Yes, Mrs. Hudson. I certainly do. I’ll just … Sherlock and I, we’ll. Um. The room upstairs …” John trailed off weakly, not really sure how to tell his eighty year old landlady that he and his lover would be sure to fuck somewhere else than over her head while she tried to sleep. He took another step up, holding up the takeout bags and nodding toward them. “This is hot and you know how Chinese is best eaten fresh. Goodnight, Mrs. Hudson!” Cheeks aflame, John ducked his head and nearly sprinted up the stairs.
The unknown brother dragged me into the room and to the farthest corner, where usually only a few chairs were arranged around a glass table - now the glass plate of the table was broken and in the midst of the bloody shards lay Brother Francis - he did not move, while Father Andrew and two other brothers tried to free him without causing further injury. I made my way through the surrounding monks, helped the novice to straighten up first and then, as carefully as possible, free him from the layers of his habit and scanned his skin for splinters of glass. The black cloth showed some damp spots - but the undergarment was soaked to the waist with blood.
Sherlock’s expression softened as he took John’s hand between both of his and squeezed. “What can I do to show you, I do want this?” He gestured between them again.
"In most cases it happens quite voluntarily in order to keep his mind from external disturbances and thereby to open up completely to the voice of God and acting according to His will. However, there are also cases in which the silence is imposed as a usually temporary form of penance, in case a friar showed some kind of behaviour that doesn’t match with the Rule of the Order. "
As Jonah set off, I went to my room to stow the drawing safely - after all, it was the only memory of Brother William that would stay with me when I returned home. Home to my boring, monotonous life and my superficial friends who did not deserve that title. Everything was different here. People who barely knew me had taken me in, integrated me without hesitation into their daily lives and opened their hearts to me. However, when I thought back to my last conversation with Jonah, I became painfully aware of the price this cooperation could sometimes have - the needs of the individual were secondary, what mattered was only the good of the community. In the long run that would probably have been no alternative for me.
John was stood at the kitchen counter. He turned at the sound of Sherlock’s arrival. Sherlock couldn’t contain the grin that spread over his features. “What do you think?”
Those days in hospital were not something John liked to think back on. He only disclosed the information to his personal physician and no one else. John had never considered having children anyway, so he viewed the fact that he was left sterile from the rare complication as a plus, not a minus. He still insisted on condoms, even when the women he slept with wanted to skip protection. He’d seen enough complications of various STIs during medical school that he wasn’t willing to take risks. And if the women thought the condoms were for birth control, John didn’t correct them. His wife had told him plainly on an early date ‘kids aren’t my thing.’ Being a private sort, John hadn’t shared with her that kids with him were an impossibility. It didn’t seem a big issue since the charming blonde didn’t want children.
The next moment, I mentally slapped myself for my stupid question; my opponent looked amused by my obvious embarrassment.
Panting, John’s hips finally sitlled. Hands on Sherlock’s hips, he relished the sight of Sherlock, eyes closed in his flushed profile, back heaving to regain his breath, lower back painted with white stripes of John’s release. When he could breathe again, John found Sherlock’s pants where he’d kicked them under the bed and used them to wipe Sherlock’s back. Sherlock crawled forward to the pillows and collapsed onto his side with a sigh.
But if it had not been an outsider who had attacked Jonah - then who? Apart from myself, there were no guests at the monastery. It was only through this circumstance that I had been much more involved in the life of the monks than was normally the case, Prior Lambert had informed me shortly after my arrival in a tone which made it clear that I was honored and should be grateful. Which I was, of course, because otherwise I wouldn’t have been permitted to join the friars in their recreation room and so I would never have experienced the joy of listening to Brother William playing the violin. I wouldn’t have seen Brother Jonah's response to the letter and all the dramatic developments that followed. This honor had not only brought positive things with it, for now Brother Jonah lay unconscious in front of me, and I was already wondering whether I might even be suspected by my presence in this cellar vault. But all these were things I could deal with later - now I had to get the young man revived, no matter how I should do it.
"You do not have to apologize to me," I replied, glancing up at the tall man, "Things are the way they are - and I'm grateful if I can at least be of some use after being welcomed here so warmly. But I can not understand why Jonah was put under arrest. "
Sherlock finally figured it out at the deli they retired to after being thrown out of the diner. “Didn’t you get my messages?” he asked John.
The sun was starting to set when he cut down an alley behind a nightclub, figuring a quick blowjob in the club’s men’s room would get him drugs enough to see him through the night.  He glanced to either side then jimmied the lock on the back door. It gave under his skillful tampering and he slipped inside to find himself in a dishroom. Through a propped-open swinging door, he saw a kitchen full of scuttling workers. A coat rack beside the door held aprons - he dropped his bag under it and slipped one on. The shelf above a countertop full of dirty dishes held a stack of paper hats; he donned one of those, too. When he heard footsteps approaching, he leaned over the closest sink and turned both taps on full blast. He slouched, pretending to be engrossed in wiping the plates stacked in the sink.
"I admit, there is a certain risk that we should not take as long as you can make it. You can take the nausea tablets without concern, they have a different mode of action. "
what a mess. What an awful, horrible mess. He’d spent two years in abject despair – all because of one variable Sherlock could not have controlled.  Sherlock had spent two years writing to him while believing John would be waiting for him at Baker Street when he returned. The sheer
Something awakened me, but I couldn't tell what. Even though my neck ached, I did not want to lift my head because that meant I wouldn’t have direct physical contact with Sherlock. Was it a sound I had heard? Something I had seen that my brain could not handle yet? It took me half a second to realize what had changed. It was not a sound and it was not the changing light due to approaching darkness. It was a hand resting on my hair. Sherlock's hand.
"I heard your conversation with Brother William. I'm sorry, Jonah, I didn’t want to hurt either your or his privacy ... "
Somehow during the night I had fallen asleep and awoke all the more frightened as the ringing of the bells ripped me from deep sleep. I got up and went straight to the church. My feelings of the last night had given way to a strange void; my mind seemed to have accepted that it was wrong to interfere in the private affairs of strangers, however much I felt the need to help whenever help was needed. But I had to accept it if this was not desired. And forget what I had involuntarily listened to, even if it was so worrying.
Lost in thought, I wandered along the cloister looking at the mosaic pattern of the floor slabs, the columns and arches of sandstone, and the garden behind with its colorful flowers which slowly and surely had to give way to autumn. At the other end of this idyllic spot I saw the beehives under the apple trees and I thought again of the time when I had tended these fascinating beings with Sherlock - brother William, I scolded myself again and again. It was only two days ago, but this episode seemed like a dream or the echo of another life.
John was out of his chair and on his knees by Sherlock’s side in a flash. He laid a hand on Sherlock’s hip and spoke softly. “I misunderstood, Sherlock. I’m sorry.” He kissed the back of Sherlock’s neck. “I’d marry you any day. In a heartbeat.” He stood and pulled at Sherlock’s elbow. “In fact, lets do it. Now. Today. Go get dressed, let’s go get married.”
"Sorry," I mumbled, and felt that I blushed again. "I don’t want to fail completely right from the start."
“Is it someone trying to get to you through me? Is it something to do with this terrorist thing you talked about?” John’s tone of voice pierced Sherlock’s heart. It sounded as if John blamed Sherlock for being kidnapped –
John swiped at the mess on the edge of the mattress then dropped the pants to the floor. He walked around the bed and got in beside Sherlock, who scooted close and threw his arm across John’s chest. He tucked his fingers under John’s ribs and rested his cheekbone against John’s shoulder.
I sighed. I had always imagined speaking these words by candlelight, over a glass of fine wine - not at the bedside of a man who couldn’t respond. Still, as long as there was a hint of a chance I could get through to him, I would try. Still stroking his cheek, I leaned down until my lips almost touched his nose.
What was John doing two weeks ago, instead? He thought back. It had been another innocuous night at Mary’s house. She’d made pasta for dinner. She washed the dishes; he dried and put them away. Afterward they’d finished off the bottle of pino grigio they’d opened with dinner. They’d turned in early had had rather forgettable sex. Had it been good? If asked, John would have answered yes at the time. But now?
Lowering himself between John’s spread knees, Sherlock took John’s erection into his hand and looked up at John with such a worshipful expression in his eyes that John gasped, then sighed and nodded his consent. That was all it took for Sherlock to eagerly engulf John in the heat of his mouth. Swearing loudly, John squirmed and tried to keep enough control to keep his hips on the bed while Sherlock sucked, licked and laved with every trick he knew that John liked.
“I arranged a moving van, two men will meet you Friday morning at 9 to get your possessions. I figured a van would be sufficient, that you’d want to give Mary the furniture.”
Mycroft laughed briefly. “Love, John? I’d watched you treat girlfriends as no more than a disposable commodity. Why would I have believed you would treat my brother any differently?”
"I wanted it. I wanted to start a new life. Could not have guessed that my old life would catch me here ... "
John rounded the table and caught the front of Sherlock’s shirt to haul him in for a giggling, open mouthed kiss. “Does that bed of yours come apart?” he finally murmured against Sherlock’s lips.
He winced at how unfairly he’d treated Mary. He’d used her as a distraction to crawl out of the pit of his mourning for Sherlock. It wasn’t fair to her. He genuinely
“No thanks to you. I want to talk to you. Face to face. I have some questions for you about the past two years.” John struggled to modulate his voice. He wanted to shout, but instead bit out each word with vicious precision.
No sooner than the Prior stood up, and thus declared the breakfast finished, Jonah also jumped up and strode towards the exit. He jerked back as I laid a hand on his shoulder and asked him if he was feeling alright.
"Tell me everything!" He urged, his eyes shining, listening intently to my account of yesterday's events . When I told him about Brother Francis's attack on Sherlock, his hand flew to his heart in horror.
Bursting through the front door at Baker Street, Sherlock bounded up the stairs like a teenager in his eagerness  to show John his new ‘do. The door to the flat stood open, as always, so he entered with a swirl of coat and ripped off his scarf in a ‘big reveal’ motion.
Frank gave him an appraising stare, narrowing his eyes and pursing his lips. “I’m supposed to believe you without any proof. Right, kid, what kind of fool do you take me for?”
Without waiting for an answer, I pulled his arms aside and continued my work as he buried his face in the pillow. Brother Elijah appeared next to me with a bedside lamp and directed the light beam to the wound so I could check if there were any chippings in it - which was fortunately not the case. Still, the danger was not averted - the impact on the edge of the wine barrel had left a deep gash in the man’s scalp that had to be sewed. Unfortunately, I lacked the necessary supplies.
Breaking the kiss, John pulled Sherlock to his feet and spun him to face the bed. His arms circled Sherlock’s torso, and he pressed his pelvis into Sherlock’s hip but holding his chest far enough away save Sherlock’s torture wounds any further injury. He leaned his forehead between Sherlock’s shoulder blades and felt Sherlock’s ribs expand and contract with each breath. Starting at Sherlock’s hips, John ran his hands over the smooth expanse of Sherlock’s skin - firm stomach, the ripples of his ribs, hard pectorals, pebbled nipples, wiry chest hair, and finally the supple column of his endless neck. John
A hand on his elbow stopped his progress. He spun toward the owner of the hand to find himself looking up into dark eyes set in a swarthy, handsome face. “Hello, doll. I haven’t seen you around here before,” the too-handsome man lisped in a Cuban accent. It was clear this man had seen Scarface and strove to emulate the lead actor of that movie in his dress and actions.
John opened the door and held it for Sherlock. He’d chosen the restaurant because it was small, well lit, sure to be uncrowded even on a Sunday in December, and most importantly - it did not serve alcohol.
"The Queen!" I whispered with excitement, looked at her for a moment as she crawled over the honeycombs, then put the frame back into its place at the behest of the friar. After I had checked all five beehives, the dark-haired man got proactive himself and took one of the frames, the honeycombs of which were almost all closed. He hung it in a stainless steel container and gestured for me to follow him back inside the monastery.
"What? Upset? I ... no, Jonah, do not get it wrong, please, it has absolutely nothing to do with you. It is solely up to me. I have become aware of something that makes it impossible for me to stay any longer with you. I want to save you any ... unpleasantness. "
It took hours for me to break away from him so he could spare his strength. At first I found it hard to leave him alone, but knowing that he was well on the way to recovery made it much easier for me to return to my car and drive back to the monastery. By now it was after 10 pm and the Prior would not be very happy about my delay. On the other hand, I delivered such good news, I would be forgiven for my late return.
At first, the prior did not say a word and looked at the young man in front of him pensively, until a smile spread slowly across his lips and he stretched out his right hand.
I guessed Brother William was in the library but I only found Father Andrew there, obviously preparing his next lesson. He looked up from his notes and gave me a questioning look.
"It all sounds as if it were only a charade to him - as if he were a little boy playing the pirate."
“I don’t see anything to talk about. I’m with Mary now. We’re getting married. I would like to still be friends, if that’s possible.” John sounded like being friends was the last thing he wanted. “I thought at least I’d come by and thank you for saving my life.”
John’s expression changed as fast as a late summer thunderstorm. A glower darkened his features and dulled his eyes. “What do I think? What do
The surgery had been short staffed that day. John’s scheduled four hour shift stretched into eight, then he’d offered to stay for the second shift - they could certainly use the money. He’d been so rushed all day, he hadn’t even had time to check in via text to see what Sherlock had gotten up to. Later, when John came home to a dark flat and missing flatmate, he wasn’t too concerned.  Sherlock had survived without him for two years in much more dangerous circumstances than London at eleven p.m. on a Tuesday. After a bite to eat, he settled into bed with his laptop and a cold beer.
Sherlock ducked his head and made a noncommittal noise in the back of his throat. John continued to pick at the offending substance, pulling at a dark ringlet on the side of Sherlock’s head.
Sherlock dropped a newspaper into John’s lap. “Good. There’s a glass blowing class that meets on Sundays. They’re looking for an assistant. I knew you’d be interested so I circled the advert. Thought you could use the extra income.”
To think that if he hadn’t been hit by the biker, he would have known about the specimens the next day. He would have chuckled about Sherlock’s performance, not reeled in shocked grief. He would have stayed at Baker Street (
John glanced sideways at Mycroft, too angry to face him directly. He feared he’d punch Mycroft’s snide mouth if he looked at him too long. “Yeah, so. This website Sherlock set up. It seems I had a concussion. From when the biker took me down. I didn’t know, not until tonight. I just … ummm … thought it was grief. You know I thought he was dead, right?” John realized he was rambling but couldn’t seem to organize his thoughts.
Breathless, I stared at Brother William. If there had been a mirror in the room, I would probably have seen a man with reddened skin, dilated pupils, and trembling lips. I was dizzy and I had to lean against the cabinet behind me to pick up courage again - as inconspicuously as possible. The friar, however, did not seem to be finished with me. He had also leaned against a dresser, his arms crossed in front of his chest, and looked at me defiantly, his lips pulled up slightly in a mischievous smile. He raised his eyebrows and fixed me with his gaze, tilting his head slightly, as if he were expecting me to say something. I broke out in sweat and wiped one hand across my forehead and back through my hair restlessly. I cleared my throat, turned my eyes away and tapped non-existing lints from my sweater. The monk still stared at me, kept me in suspense a while longer - it seemed like hours - and then finally turned away. I could not see what he was doing, but I realised it as he turned back to me. He held the clay pot into which we had previously filled the honey and presented it to me like a precious treasure.
As the day drew to a close, however, I was nervous. I had noted at lunch that Brother Jonah and I were on the chart tonight for kitchen service - along with Brother William. When we came into the kitchen, the curly-headed man was already bent over one of the countertops, slicing the bread for dinner while large kettles of water heated on the stove. He greeted us with a curt nod and gave the novice a sign that we were to get the dishes out of the cupboards and set the tables. I was more than happy because that meant that we could leave the room in which he was engaged in preparing food - so I no longer had to waste all my energy in trying not to stare incessantly.
This was the decision that sounded good to me. It would, after all, not hurt to learn a little more about the community. That I would also escape even the chance of an encounter with Brother William, of course, was only secondary in my thoughts. In the seminar room I again met brother Jonah, who beckoned me over happily; already I was convinced that I’d found a valuable companion in the young man, to help me on the way to self-knowledge. At the beginning I felt a little out of place, being the only one in civilian clothes among all the friars in their habits, but my unease did not last long, the teacher, Father Andrew, couldn’t be much older than I was, and was a true jokester. He knew how to infuse a rather dry topic with refreshing lightness, always made his students laugh, and made sure that the hours flew by.
"It doesn’t seem unusual to you, either. If I wouldn’t know exactly that you really are a computer scientist, I would have rated you as a student of the socio-psychological direction by now... "
John hung up the phone carefully. He squared his shoulders then nearly marched back to the bedroom. The file still lay on the bed. He opened it and carefully took out the page with the website information. He opened a tab and typed in the information.
So far, in my story, I had concealed much of the conversation I had with Jonah in the meditation room in the attic, but I did not want to hide any more of my thoughts about it from Sherlock.
The breathless quality of Sherlock’s voice stoked John’s animal instincts. “On the bed. Kneel,” John growled
Sherlock pouted, sticking his lower lip out in a way he knew people found attractive. “I’m thirsty.” He dropped the stirrer into his drink and took a sip.
from Frank Hudson!” Her hands fluttered outward in a helpless gesture. “Get those off. Right now! Hurry, Frank might come home.” She sprang to her feet and pulled at Sherlock’s shoulder. “Come on, there’s clothes upstairs. You can change.” Without waiting for a reply, Mrs. Hudson hurried out of the room and toward the foyer.
How could he have heard me? I was always amazed at the talents he displayed. Slowly, I put my hand on the doorknob, turned it and carefully opened the door, unsure what to expect behind it.
"Let him have some time to himself, I think he needs it now. Brother William will take care of him. "
He put a finger to his lips and motioned for me to follow him. When I saw the candle in his hand, I was painfully reminded of Brother William, but I decided to put the thoughts of him aside as much as possible and see where the novice was leading me and what he wanted to tell me.
"Jonah came to me one evening and told me that he had quarreled with Francis during the novice class. They had discussed whether homosexuality was considered a sin by today's standards. By nature, Jonah has argued that committing sin is intentional, but that no one can freely choose one's sexual orientation, so at least the doctrine must be reconsidered and Francis rebuked him and gives him all the passages that speak against his liberal views. When Jonah then referred to the covenant between Ruth and Naomi, which comes very close to our present understanding of a marriage, and also indicated that they were almost certainly in a relationship, Francis had responded, "Revolting."
“An explanation. And apology. Please, just read it.” Sherlock hated the pleading tone in his voice but he had reached the end of his self control. He was desperate for John to understand, to remember. “Just … it’s all in there. You’ll understand after you read it.”
John’s mouth actually dropped open in shock. “You called your brother? Surely you could have thought of someone else.”
"That's okay. I think you’re a little confused - and we still need our dishes." He patted me on the shoulder encouragingly then pushed me forcefully out of the kitchen. "I'll pick you up in time for lessons."
For a moment we both fell silent; it was an unpleasant silence and I did not know how to act towards him. He was not just any patient, he was ... what
I pretended not to notice how Jonah gasped, and continued, unmoved, "Why do you think he can help you? What qualifies him above all the others? What can he do better than the police could? "
"That sounds good. After doing so much for me, I would just like to return a bit of support to him. But that applies to so many people here - even to you, Father. "
After a few blocks John glanced up into Sherlock’s face. He now saw everything he hadn’t allowed himself to see two years ago - Sherlock’s devotion, affection and love for him. John smiled in return and spoke softly. “Mycroft, you might want to look out of the window for a moment.”
Well ... besides the fact that, after realizing that William had fallen into a coma because of the poison, Jonah had gone to his confessor. Has this been a suspected act of revenge gone awry and gone horribly wrong? The scenario that took shape in my mind was not completely far-fetched - yet I had always been able to rely on my gut when it came to who I could trust and who not. And with Jonah I was very sure that my gut did not let me down. Could I dare to seek the conversation with him and address him as subtle as possible about my suspicions? His reaction would certainly clarify the outcome.
"I did not think anyone should be rashly condemned - and yet he is locked up as if his guilt were already established. I'm sorry if I get involved again in things that have nothing to do with me but that sounds to me as if the interrogation had already ended with a clear result. "
Two years he’d grieved Sherlock, believed that his lover/partner/boyfriend had committed suicide right in front of him. Two years he’d cried himself to sleep. Two years he’d lived a ghost of an existence, merely going through the motions of being alive. He and Sherlock had been involved for almost a year before his jump. They’d never actually “come out” – hadn't had to, since everyone who knew them assumed they’d been romantically involved from the start.
With unprecedented severity, William threw aside the magnifying glass and gave the envelope a push, which conveyed it to the other end of the desk, although its contents scattered onto the whole table.
"I warned him. Had he not been so careful, Francis might have managed to attack him in an unobserved moment. But at the time, I was not fully aware of what he was up to. And I needed proof to put him and, above all, his associates, behind bars. "
Sherlock had hoped to slip out of the flat before John arrived home from his new job. He wasn’t in the mood for an argument and lately, any time he tried to initiate conversation with his husband, John took it as an invitation to nag and pick and start a row. He’d been distracted by a new
I glimpsed into the garden with the apple trees and for the first time I looked down consciously. I had been here for more than a week, and yet I had not even looked at what was on the other side of the window as I had only glanced at the part of the building on the opposite side: Facade of light stone that looked quite monotonous. I recalled the floorplan of the convent; only now did I notice that the rooms opposite my room had to be the cells of the friars. I tried to think back to the corridor which I had walked along with Brother Jonah when the migraine attack had struck him and which I, as a guest, wasn’t allowed to enter. We had come down from the novices’ seminar room in the attic, walked down a stone spiral staircase and then entered the corridor, which, from my window, was on the left; from there we had turned to the right and had entered the corridor reserved for the brothers as a private retreat. Brother Jonah's room was - I counted again in my mind - the fifth rooms on the left, on the side that was turned away from the courtyard. Brother William’s room had been diagonally opposite, a few meters away. It had to be the seventh room on the right side.
I swallowed hard. The words were on my tongue, but I could not bring myself to utter them, was almost a little afraid to seal his fate when I expressed my greatest concern. My grip on his hand tightened so much that I dug my fingernails into his skin. When I realized what I was doing, I let it go as though I had burned myself but he did not respond to the pain or the interrupted touch. Apart from the regular beeping of the controls, there was no indication that he was alive at all.
They remained silent while waiting for the kettle to boil. Mary kept her eyes on the kettle and John kept his on her. At last, she filled the teapot and carried it and their mugs to the table. “There,” she said brightly. “There’s nothing that a nice cuppa can’t fix. Right, John?” She smiled at him, crinkling her nose in the way that John used to find charming. Now, it made him swallow nervously.
"Sherlock, it's me, John! I'm with you. Come back, I'll keep you safe. Nobody can hurt you now. Come on, wake up! "
"Brother William is Jonah's mentor. They are very similar in a certain way, even if they differ strongly in character. Brother William is very self-centered, he is able to lose himself in his work for hours, completely forgetting the world around him. It’s his asset, that he can devote himself to a task with all his heart. Brother Jonah, on the other hand, is incredibly versatile and can adapt to new situations on very short notice. He has a wide range of talents but is very volatile - which is basically nothing bad, but Prior Lambert and I thought that if he was supported by Brother William, he might develop an even deeper faith and Brother William's peacefulness would be a good influence. And I am convinced that peace and silence are exactly what Brother Jonah needs now. He is agitated and cannot deal with things. Any conversation would be wrong now. It does you credit that you worry about him, but give him time until tomorrow, maybe the dark clouds will have dispersed, and if not, you can still offer him your support. "
I had expected many things, but not that the entire room would be illuminated by the glow of several dozen candles - and Sherlock in the middle, just like our very first meeting: the black habit, reading glasses on his nose, and a leather-bound book in his hands. The only difference was that he now stood upright in front of me - and blissfully smiled.
