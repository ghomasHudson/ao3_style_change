“Thank you for shopping at Regular Chemist.  Have a good day.”
John started, and stepped back.  The spell was broken, and both men flushed.  “Um.  Feeling a bit better?”  John sputtered.  “Let’s get you into the shower then.”
“Shhh… you’re alright now.  You’re here, and you’re healing up.  Let me help you.”  John ran his hands over Sherlock’s shoulders gently.  “Don’t worry.  We’ll get you cleaned up, then into bed and we can talk about this later.  One thing at a time.  Concentrate on what we’re doing now.”  His hands brushed down Sherlock’s arms and he stepped closer into Sherlock’s back, his lips close to Sherlock’s neck.  His dressing gown brushed up against the curve of Sherlock’s arse and John leaned in, his eyes closed.  “Shhh… relax…mmm.”  Everything was quiet and comfortable.  The rhythm of Sherlock’s breathing had stilled and he lolled his head back, resting it on the top of John’s.
Mycroft raised an eyebrow at John and headed down the hall.  “Oh John” he said, “you’ll find your rooms are in the east wing,  last on the left.”
“You, buying me a pint?  What?  You’ve got a sister with ‘a lovely personality’ who needs a date?”
While John waited for the long lump on the couch to respond, he opened his letter.
She paused.
John got up, walked to the computer, and pressed PLAY.
Mycroft smiled coldly.
The heart monitor beeped steadily.
Operation Bad Cop.  John knew it didn’t have anything to do with what he was trying to achieve, but he always wanted to be the Bad Cop.
"We were born sick"
Twisted fortune shone on him though, and Lestrade called Friday afternoon.  Double murder.  The bodies were found in the Thames, headless, naked.  When John got Sherlock’s text he grinned and thanked… well.  He grinned.  He and Sarah were on their way.
“Where are we going, Mike?  I thought we were gonna meet this artist friend of yours?”
“What?  Your mum?  You mean I…”  John didn’t finish his sentence either.  In a rare moment of deduction, he understood by the murderous look in Sherlock’s eyes that saying “I had a chance with her?” would have been more than a bit not good.  He kept it to himself, and instead said “You’re over exaggerating, Sherlock.  She’s not interested in me, why would she be?  I’m ordinary.”  He rubbed his hands and turned to the food.  “Now- tell me what all this stuff is.  Is that blackberry jam?”
John was thunderstruck.  Sherlock initiating contact, and accepting it in return.   The chin over the shoulder was so Sherlock, though.  John experienced it many times while he was blogging.  It just surprised him to see it repeated.
Molly smiled at Greg and said “That’s what it looked like, but that’s not what it WAS.”
fit us for perfect rest above;
“mmm.  That’s nice, Sherlock, thank you.”
“Let’s start again, new topic.  Where do you feel most safe?”
I should've worshipped her sooner
As much as he enjoyed having his fingers in her pussy and her hands around his cock, John realized he’d much rather have his cock in her pussy and her pussy around his cock.  He pulled his fingers out and began to move, starting to slide over her to get between her legs.  She released him, her hands running up his sides.  He reached for the condom he’d put on the bedside table and put it on, then slicked it just a bit.  He raised up and felt his cock brush against her as he got into position.  She reached down to take a hold of him and guide him into position.  Almost there…his tip touching her lips.  She pushed back a little, and he stopped- allowing her to guide their actions.  She moved him up and down a bit, rubbing the head of his cock along her slit.  She was so wet, and John couldn’t remember when he’d been as hard.
Sherlock sputtered.  “What if there’s a case?  What if…”
“I don’t think Sarah would be all that chuffed to see me, but thanks anyway.  I’m staying right here.”
My lover's the sunlight
John agreed and they discussed some care tips and things to watch out for.
They both stood, wide eyed and staring at the signs of damage smeared across the pale skin.
Sherlock snorted and turned away.
“Right.  Well, I wanted to drop these off.  John left them in the cab last night.  Not bad shots actually.  You two clean up nicely.  And if your mum ever needs the Yard’s assistance with ANYTHING…”  He winked and smiled, then turned serious.  “Look, Sherlock, I know it’s not really my business,”
If I'm a pagan of the good times
John struggled upright, blinking and stretching. “What’s wrong with my brown suit? Even Mycroft said… Oh. I get it. Because you don’t like your brother, I have to buy a new suit. Well it’s not going to happen. I cannot afford, no- I WILL NOT waste the money.”
He surveyed his handiwork, and frowned.  Too bright.  He needed this to be perfect.
“How do you feel?”
Her hand was slowly moving, stroking him, pausing every now and then to feel and play a little.  He responded in kind, cupping her pussy, then slowly sliding a finger inside.  She gave a bit of a start, and he could feel her tongue jolt against his.  She was hot and wet and his finger moved easily.  He slipped another in, to increase her pleasure.  Their kisses grew more intense, and her grip on his cock grew firmer.
“I’m going.  Get Mycroft to fix it if you have to, but I’m Sherlock’s doctor, I’m his friend, I’m his…  I’m going.”
When John finally put his hands in Sherlock’s hair and whispered “please…” Sherlock relented.  He ran his tongue up slowly from balls to tip, before pausing with his mouth wrapped around the head of John's cock, holding loosely, not tight.
All too soon John felt the familiar tingling in his abdomen.  “Sherlock, I’m gonna…”
Surprisingly not boring, at least for one of them…
“Can’t take clouds.  John gave.  Candy floss and rabbit fur.”
“You’ve contracted someone to write a song?  In the millions of songs ever written, you couldn’t find one to say what it should say?  Now we’re going to have to wait even longer.  My muscles are going to atrophy.”
“Because it’s insipid.  If I am to understand this project correctly, you want a performance that will complement your architectural installment, which is an unfinished, open-air cathedral of sorts.  Using a two hundred-year old hymn will not convey what you want it to convey, no matter how talented the dancer is.  And trust me- I am the most talented there is.”
When she tightened her grip and began to stroke and press into him even deeper, he bore down and reached as far as he could.  As a doctor, he knew what he was trying for, but just…couldn’t…reach.  So he began to pump his hips in earnest as he fucked his hand harder and faster.
There is no sweeter innocence than our gentle sin
“I’m not hungry.  I had my fill of the delectable hospital cuisine thank you very much.”   Sherlock sniffed and flung himself over, by habit.
“Good.  Because if you don’t get your clothes off right now so I can feel your skin against mine I will… I will”  Sherlock’s voice faltered, because John was licking at his neck.
will furnish all we need to ask,
Take me to church
Her legs began to shake again, and John reached up with his free hand to press on her back.  She bent forward just a touch, and as he stroked her pussy and clit, he pushed his tongue into her.
“That’s not very fair, now is it?” she grinned.
He executed a swift turn and walked out, ready to face his destiny.  He just never figured his destiny would be in the form of a tall, mad, detective.
“Wot? You getting laid?  You and Sherlock finally…”  Greg couldn’t finish the thought, but merely waved his hand and waggled his eyebrows.
The taxidermy shop is real too- "Get Stuffed."  I do not imply they do anything nefarious there, I just needed an address.
He hung up and turned to leave.
“I’m glad to attend, Mycroft. I was just trying to figure out how to reply when you arrived.”
Sherlock was scheduled to be the final act, sponsored by “Meridian Imports.”  When John had asked what company that was, Sherlock had merely glared at him and put a finger aside his nose.  Ah.  MI6 then.  Good to know.
The show progressed slowly.  Each act was “sponsored” by a company or organization, and the amount donated was based on the volume of applause the act received.  Harrod’s ended up donating £2,500 for
Sherlock kept his left hand on John's thigh, and moved his right to gently encircle John's cock.  A moan from John at the touch drew one from Sherlock as well, and for a moment neither man moved.  Sherlock had had John in his mouth before, but this... this was more.  More intimate, more exciting, closer and deeper.  The thought made his breath catch and his eyelids flutter.
Sherlock tried to hide it, and refused to acknowledge it, but John knew.
His hands moved to her neck, and he began to slowly lick and kiss.  She tilted her head back to give him as much of herself as possible and she sighed.  His hand was on her side again, while hers curled behind his neck, holding him against her.  He ran his hand all the way down her leg, ignoring his thoughts of maybe a quick pass to the front and the delights under the fabric there.  Not yet…  but as he passed his hand back up, he found himself moving under her nightgown, encountering bare skin.  Fingers ran up as he continued to work on her neck, now following her jaw line to her ear, allowing his breath to fill it as he nibbled.
Mycroft.
“John is physically fine, as I said.  But Sherlock.  He left his romantic mini-break with Dr. Sawyer early, and nearly beat a man to death to find you.  He came close to blows with the medics who were trying to deny him access to your ambulance.  He refused to leave your side all last night, and I had to have him drugged to keep him from returning here before he rested.  Do you understand what I’m saying?”
If the heavens ever did speak
“What’d Sherlock do this time?”
Molly had nothing to say.
“Yeah, don’t worry.”
“TXT: Of course, I’ll be there Molly.  Even if your ridiculous use of text-speak turns my stomach. -SH”
The scene in front of him was eerily familiar, but at the same time all wrong.  Sherlock was in his chair with his laptop, dressing gown and pajamas on.  Rhys was in John’s chair, reading, also in pajamas.
It was all so slow, so languid.  John felt as though he was sinking into Sherlock, melting.  It wasn’t the frantic, lust driven meeting of a one night stand, this felt… life changing.  He looked down and watched his cock slide in and out of Sherlock’s plush lips and gasped.  The heat that had been simmering flamed up and John began to roll his hips.
John tried to catch up.  “But this whole time- you ignored me.  You didn’t call me for a case, you TOUCHED him, you SLEPT with him, you let him touch YOU.”
The next morning, John checked his messages on  his newly-revived mobile.  Two missed calls from Lestrade, one from Mycroft.  He looked at Sarah’s phone- also a missed call from Mycroft’s number.  John had never given anyone Sarah’s number.
John knew when Sherlock was frantic for a case.  When he barely restrained his energy and begged for work, for cigarettes, for distraction.  John imagined that’s what Sherlock would look like on the edge of losing control, and wondered if he’d ever shown that look to another person.
Sherlock stood, his eyes clearer now.
“I’m out, lads.  John, are you ready?”
As Sherlock bit his lip, John’s orgasm overtook him.  He moaned and froze, unable to do anything but stand as the stars exploded behind his eyelids.
Every Sunday's getting more bleak
“I’ve been asked to write a song.”
John put the third mug away, and when the tea was ready, he placed Sherlock’s mug on the coffee table, where he’d be sure to ignore it.
When he got downstairs, the parlor was empty, the cello case gone.  He relaxed, not even realizing he’d tensed up in the first place.
It was all fine, and it was all hateful.
“Molly, this is John.  John- Molly.”
“I’m not going to even attempt to keep you out, but you go in with permission under ONE condition- you stay with me, preferably behind me, at ALL times.”
John coughed, as always, uncomfortable discussing his time in the military.  “Yes, shot in the shoulder I’m afraid.  Not enough to kill me, just enough to keep me out of the lineup.”  He found that making light of what was actually a life-threatening injury was the best way to handle it.
“Well, you should have danced what I suggested in the first place then.”
John used the zip ties to cuff the man to a supporting post in the center of the room.  As he did, the man spoke.
“I’d have tea.  And I’d have John.”  Sherlock smiled.  He looked at Rhys and felt a twinge.  He wasn’t such a bad man, he just wasn’t John.  “You have to go, Rhys.  I can have Mycroft send a car to take you to Holmes Manor.  Mummy will continue to sponsor you, and I do hope to be invited to future concerts.  But this… relationship we’ve been having is over.”
He flipped to the second photo.  “Nothing here.  John’s back is turned, how am I supposed to work with that?  He’s thoroughly engrossed in the buffet.  Fish-berry jam.”  Sherlock smiled a little at that.  “That woman behind me is looking at John with interest, the man next to her is looking at his watch with impatience.  I am looking…”  He stopped.  “I am looking at John.  Why am I looking like that?”  He thought back to their conversation.
They began to walk again, closer together, Mummy having slipped her arm from his and put it instead around his waist, as if tired.  When he wrapped his arm around her shoulder, she smiled.
He pried one eye open, and wished he hadn’t.  London seemed to have been transported to the surface of the sun, judging by the brightness.  He vaguely wondered if he could just stay in bed and roast to death.
He pulled his head up and looked at Sherlock.  Not trusting his voice, he inched up the lanky body until their faces were even, then dipped down and kissed.  Tongues extended, then retracted. Passionate, but teasing a bit.  Building, growing, learning.
“Jesus Sherlock.  How did I not know?  I’m so sorry.”
Mycroft opened a compartment in the car and pulled out some cash.  He handed it to John with a sniff.  “I don’t suppose you will be able to supply a receipt?”
“That was definitely NOT boring.”
“John?”
There was a flash of lighting and bang of thunder, then darkness.  The power had gone out.  They paused, evaluating the situation, looking at one another.  They could only see each other in the light of the continuing flashes, but it didn’t matter.  There wasn’t anything they could do about the lack of power, and even if there was. This room, this bed, this moment had become the most important thing in the universe.  They started kissing and stroking again.
Sherlock started to think.  John could see him cataloguing his body.
Once the heat started, he began to let his mind wander.  Mummy in her stripper heels, Mummy in her bare feet…  what would have happened if Mycroft hadn’t shown up?  Would John have taken her up on her unspoken offer?  They would have gone into her room, where she would have turned away so he could slowly unzip that green gown.  Inch by inch, he would have exposed her skin, and inch by inch, he would have put his lips on her.
She's the last true mouthpiece
***********************************************************
“Maybe.  Let’s head back.”
“Who said anything about you buying it?” Sherlock waved a credit card in John’s direction, as he continued to dig through John’s clothes. “I nicked Mycroft’s credit card the last time he made me get in his car.”
As the last Amen faded, Sherlock grasped John’s wrists and spun him around.  They faced each other as the tempo changed.
He was bored.  He was still a little hung over.  He was still a little out of sorts.  He wanted to go home.
********************************************
Molly hung up her phone and turned to Sherlock and John.
The DI waved to the rest of the team and they went through the side door of the building.
The third was immediately after that, when he’d turned to face Sherlock.  Damn.  They looked good.  Their suits complimented each other, their coloring their height difference- everything opposite but matched.  John was smiling, Sherlock wasn’t, but neither was he frowning, so John took it as a win.
“Sherlock, are you awake?”
Agreement.  Touching.  Sherlock gave a light squeeze, and moved his hands back down to John’s inner thighs, nails lightly scratching the delicate skin.
John waited for Sherlock to get out of surgery.  He dozed in the uncomfortable hospital waiting room chair, watched TV with no sound, drank innumerable cups of watery hospital coffee.  By midnight he was exhausted and wired, starving and queasy.  Had it only been that morning when he’d woken up with Sarah?
“…um.  What?”
“A higher power that loves unconditionally?  Let me tell you a story.  I have a sister, Harriett.  Everybody calls her Harry, and she was always encouraged to be a tomboy.  Played footie with the boys, went fishing with our dad, always in jeans, always a bit rough around the edges.  So, one day she shows up at the house with a girl on her arm.  Says she has a girlfriend now.  Never saw her smile so hard in my life.  Well, my parents grabbed her and marched her right upstairs.  Threw her in the shower, cleaned her up, put her in a dress and drove immediately to the church.  D’you know what happened there?  The priest listened to her ‘confession’ and made her kneel for two hours with her arms outstretched, praying and begging God’s forgiveness for her unholy and unnatural ways.  Then, on Sunday, he called her out during Mass, and told the whole congregation that my sister, my darling Harry, was a sinner, and no amount of our prayers would save her from Hell.  That God had already judged her for her depravity, and there was nothing more that any of us could do.  Harry ran right out of church and right into a bottle.  She believed that son of a bitch and there’s not a damn thing I can do to help her.  So no.  I don’t really believe in a higher power that loves unconditionally.  I just like to pretend sometimes that there is.  Because what else is the point?  Why do we live, if there’s no all-powerful love?”
She tells me "worship in the bedroom"
Command me to be well
On his return to Sherlock’s room, he sat, read his magazine, and waited.
Shitty.
New mercies, each returning day,
Both musicians turned in shock.  They hadn’t even realized he was there.
************************************************
“And now you are with my son.”  Again- a question without a question.
John carefully opened one eye and did his best to glare at his flatmate. “I went shopping yesterday. Don’t tell me you’ve used everything for experiments again. Sherlock- we cannot afford to keep buying milk every day. If you don’t stop wasting it, I’ll have to resort to that ghastly powdered creamer.”
The song progressed and Sherlock’s dancing became more provocative, he planted his feet wide apart and held the umbrella between his thighs, leaving little doubt what he was miming.  His full body rolls matched those of the backup dancers, making John shake his head in amazement.
John sniffed, more irritated than angry.  “Fine.  But don’t forget to lock up when you leave, I’m taking Mrs. Hudson with me.”  Silent Minion #4 had delivered two tickets the day before, with express written instructions from Mycroft that Mrs. Hudson was to be John’s “plus one.”
“Tell me about it.”
John laughed.  “Sherlock?  Delicate and romantic?  Are we talking about the same man?  He’s reduced schoolmarms to tears and driven police officers to distraction.  He doesn’t have a delicate bone in his body!”
To keep their balance, John stood with legs wide apart, and grabbed Sherlock’s ass.
Saturday morning dawned grey and damp, much to John’s glee.  He rolled over and stretched, then nuzzled Sarah’s neck.  He loved morning sex, when everyone was muzzy and soft and bleary.  No rush, no urgency, just heat and the slow burn.  Fortunately Sarah did too, and they passed the time in the soft bed.
“You have two broken ribs, a sprained ankle, a concussion, and a broken nose.  You have serious internal injuries, consistent with damage inflicted by fists and blunt objects- most likely a cricket bat.  You required surgery to stop internal bleeding.  You’re, unfortunately, drugged to the core right now or I assume you’d be in excruciating agony.”
John snorted.
John nodded, and drank his pint.
“He fell.  Might want to call an ambulance, I think he broke a rib.  Come on- he’ll be fine here, we have to get to the river, there’s a boathouse we need to surround.”
“New every morning is the love
John flushed, and darted his eyes to Sherlock.  Surprisingly, the detective didn’t even seem to notice his mother‘s request, having already sat back down to continue his discussion.
The pressing stopped and Sherlock nodded, deep in thought.  “Alright then.  Let me take care of you for a moment.”  He slid back, putting his face in John’s crotch.  He looked up and winked again and John could have sworn that every drop of blood in his body rushed to his cock.
He grinned.
Sherlock caught the hint and closed his eyes, the urge overtaking him as well.  He hollowed his cheeks and let John thrust upwards into his mouth, creating suction where before there had just been warmth.
The next day Sherlock received a text.  “£22,750. You may keep the umbrella.”  He laughed and showed John.
Sherlock knew what John was avoiding, and the thought made him grin.  He bit it back and nodded, reaching for the shampoo as best he could.  He tilted his head back and let the water rush down his face.
John was stunned.  Sherlock’s neck was stretched impossibly long, and the water slicked his hair back.  His mouth dropped open and his eyes closed.  Is this what he looked like during… well… DURING?
Why was John sorry?  It was Sherlock’s fault he was in this mess, John was actually making it better.  His touch was so…  Sherlock’s brain was still not right.  He couldn’t figure out what it was about John’s touch and voice that made things better.  He’d figure it out later.  After the soup.
room to deny ourselves, a road
“Then the feeding, the prodding to sleep?  Is it because you think I’m not capable?”  It could have been a barbed question, full of scorn, but Sherlock was genuinely curious.
“Wot? No! Why doesn’t anybody believe me?  I’M NOT GAY.  Besides- Sherlock’s got a new fffriend.”  John sounded just like Sherlock had at Baskerville, in front of the fire.  “They’re probably shagging now.  Sherlock and Rhys.  Rhys.  Reeeeees.  What the bloody hell kind of name is Rhys anyway?  Should be pronounced Errr-hiss.   Errr-hiss the musician.  Err-hiss the detective.  Err-hiss the boyfriend.”
“Oh shit.  Let me help you.”  He rushed to the sofa, and gently helped Sherlock recline.  “You’ve got to breathe, evenly.  No gasping.”  He ran his hands gently under Sherlock’s shirt, over his ribcage, testing the bandages and the breaks.  That seemed fine.  Then the bandage over his incision… it was loose.  He pulled up the shirt and was not surprised to see fresh blood seeping out.
John tried to interrupt “But, what about…”
Sherlock strode from Mycroft’s town car as though it were on fire, leaving John to help Anthea alight.  She swept another appraising gaze over him, smiled briefly, and then she too melted away into the dusk.
Good God, let me give you my life
God will provide for sacrifice.
I was born sick, but I love it
The fourth photo though, was during the recital itself.  Taken from the side, it showed Sherlock’s profile in the fore, open-mouthed, eyes heavy lidded, he was somewhat out of focus.  John was next to him, but instead of looking forward, he had been caught looking at Sherlock with wonder, his own eyes wide, his tongue tip showing between his lips.
Again and again, Sherlock spun and leaped.  Somewhere along the way, he’d ripped a hole in his tights, and his slippers turned grey with the dust from the floor.  Sweat poured down the ripples of his back and whipped off his curls.
“You like the architecture?  That’s good- a creative pull, we can work with that.”
Sherlock still hadn’t opened his eyes.
“No thank you, John” Rhys responded. “I don’t like to eat or drink while I’m practicing.  It slows me down.”
Within weeks of moving into 221B, John developed a personal campaign.  Just as he did when he prepared his men for sorties in Afghanistan, he set objectives, made a plan, made contingency plans, laid in supplies, and came up with a clever name.
“I think Sherlock is right up Rhys’ alley.”  “Fair fucks to him.”  John shook his head hard.  He wasn’t sure what was going on in there OR in the parlor, but whatever was happening could be made better by a nice cuppa.  Yes.  Tea.
Once her panties were down, he ran his tongue up and down the same path his fingers had just made.  Gently, barely touching her, but raising goosebumps and making her shiver nonetheless.
John smiled and put his hands tentatively on Sherlock’s thighs as they pressed against his own.
“Thank you for shopping at Regular Chemist.  Have a lovely evening.”
Sherlock smiled and put down the water glass.  Very carefully, still mindful of his ribs and his other injuries, he knelt up on the sofa, then stretched out, front to front, on John.  He nuzzled his face into John’s jumper and spoke.  “Idiot.  You keep on doing what you’ve always done.  Take care of me.  But now I believe there will be additional duties.”
“We share the flat, I do the dishes, he catches criminals, I blog about it.  We’re friends.”  John’s brain raced, trying to figure out where this was going.
Sherlock’s suit was dark gunmetal grey, with a windowpane check in silver. No tie or waistcoat, of course, with a deep aubergine shirt and matching square. If John thought HE looked like a movie star, he couldn’t imagine what galaxy Sherlock belonged to. He swallowed and looked away while Sherlock harangued the tailor and made arrangements to have everything delivered to Baker Street.
He couldn’t push all the way in with her hand there, but that was fine.  He’d been so close, and this position let him pull back from the edge.  He watched in amazement as she pleasured herself, not at all bothered that she was doing it.  He knew that most women don’t climax from intercourse alone, and just wanted her to feel good.  He knew he’d get there, she felt amazing wrapped around him, hot and slick and deep inside- he could feel her gripping and releasing him as she stroked.
He stopped outside Sherlock’s door to calm down.  It would do no good to be angry in there, it wouldn’t help at all.  He took a deep breath and stepped in.
Sherlock put the glass and cloth down where John could reach them, and went back to the parlor.
The sharp cry and subsequent groan of pain brought John running from the kitchen.
“But most of all, I need YOU.  I need you to ground me and to buoy me.  I know you’re not technically gay, I know you want women.  But I think, I hope, that there’s a little part of you that wants ME, and if there is, I’d be very happy.”
“Oh.”
He looked around and noticed that Mummy had risen, yawning delicately and rolling her shoulders.  Her perfume wafted toward John, driven by the warmth of the fire.  “On that note, gentleman, I’m off to bed. “  The three men stood.  She placed a kiss on Sherlock’s cheek, then Rhys’.  Turning to John she said “Dr. Watson?  Would you please show me to my room?  I daresay this conversation isn’t interesting to you, and these two will be at it all night.”
Infinite thanks to DC for help on this chapter.
There is no sweeter innocence than our gentle sin
*****************************************
Ella had nothing to say.
He turned to the others.  “Right.  Take me there.”
As their breath slowed, Sherlock dropped his leg from John’s waist.  Once again, he put his sweaty forehead to John’s.
His stomach flipped and tightened, and he suddenly forgot how to breathe.  The look on John’s face.  He’d never seen it before, but Sherlock knew he’d give anything to see it again.
The pictures fell to the floor as memories of the morning after washed over him.  The strong hand on his cock… NOT Mummy’s.  The voice urging him on… too deep, too masculine, too Sherlock.
They flung themselves on the bed and stopped, looking at each other, paralyzed between fear and desire.  “Are you sure you’re ok with…?” “Yes.”
“Oh…  You didn’t call me.”
In addition to the umbrella that was delivered by one of Mycroft’s silent minions (#3, John noted), another dozen arrived, then a pair of shiny black “combat” boots, and a small box from
“John, there’s no need to sleep in your chair.  I’m perfectly fine.  I don’t need watching.”
“I’m not even a cop.” He hissed.  “I’m a doctor, and when I have a bad day, people die.  You just better hope that Sherlock Holmes is not that person today, or you’ll be following him.  I guarantee.  Now- where is he?”
He turned to take the soup out to Sherlock, but jumped when he saw the detective standing in the kitchen.
“That’s a tall order, sounds like this song will have a lot of emotion, and I can’t say that expressing emotion is something that comes easily to you. Sounds like a challenge.”
John turned.  “Close.  Close.  But no.  I’ve not set up a date for Friday night, I’ve set up a mini-break with Sarah over the bank holiday.  We’re going to the Isle of Wight, leaving Friday after work and getting back Monday afternoon.”
And now John’s worried.  Sherlock could tell by the look on the doctor’s face when he realized what Sherlock had done.  His surgical incision had opened.  The barrier keeping the outside out, and Sherlock’s insides IN had been breached.  It needed repair.
Bright morning sunlight streamed through the curtains much too early for John.  It was Saturday, he was off from the clinic, he was in a luxurious bed (he had to get better sheets at home, that much was certain) and he did not want to wake up.  He rolled over on his stomach and was immediately aware of the fact that part of him most definitely did want to be up.
with the chestnut handle and Nepalese horn button, that’s your best, isn’t it?”
The stab of the needle was usually nothing more than an annoyance, but this time… ohhhh this time it hurt.  It was fire, it was ice, it was painful.  Sherlock bit his lip and nearly hyperventilated.  He was an idiot.  Why did he DO that?
“Why?  Why do I have to be the one to change?  It’s not my fault she dances like an ostrich.  Did you see her frame?  That alone should have gotten her dismissed, but then she danced…”
“I think I love John.”  Well THAT’S not what he thought he’d say.
Sherlock spun and threw himself on the floor, clawing his way across like his life depended on it.  He rolled to his back and arched, then pushed himself up again.
“Why didn’t you tell me what you did?”
Only then I am clean
What on EARTH could MUMMY be apologizing to John for?  Mummy never apologized for anything.  No one in the Holmes family apologizes.
“Hmmm.”  It was more a purr than an answer.
“Naked.  Now.  Your bed.  Now.”  John abandoned his thoughts of teasing fully clothed.  He needed to feel Sherlock’s skin, all of it, and the sooner the better, and the faster they got to bed the better.
***************************************************
*******************************************
.  John laughed and clapped loudly for that one.
Just over 2 hours from London via train and ferry, the Isle of Wight was far enough and DIFFERENT enough from London to feel like an exotic vacation.  John had booked a room in a B&B in Shanklin, overlooking the Channel.  If the weather was clear, they could go to Queen Victoria’s summer palace and private bathing beach.  Once again, John was hoping for the worst- a rainstorm, perhaps a hurricane.  Anything to keep Sarah inside their comfy looking room instead of tramping all around the island.
But now wasn’t the time to wonder.  They’d finished dinner, and walked slowly along the shore and through the quaint streets to their B&B.  Their room was on the top floor, 1 of only three rooms in the place.  It was quiet, and dark, and most importantly- no Sherlock.
“I don’t know what I can add.  But I have to go.  I can’t stay, Sarah.  Please understand.”  John turned and started packing.
He turned from the room and texted Mycroft.
new thoughts of God, new hopes of heaven.
should teach him to not underestimate me.”
“Let me show you.”
She's the giggle at a funeral
When the song ended he couldn’t look up.  What was Ella going to say?  He’d laid himself bare like he never had before.  His sister’s pain, his own longing, his anger, his disgust, it was all there.  How was he supposed to act now?  He’d held everything so close to his chest since the attack, and here it was, in the sunlight, waiting to be critiqued.  He didn’t know if he could bear rejection.
John put the magazine down and stood by the side of Sherlock’s bed.  “I’m here, how do you feel?”
John turned slowly.  “Um.  I did.  You must have forgotten with the anesthesia and all.  I told you that Mycroft figured out the taxidermy connection and we talked to a homeless person and went into the taxidermy shop.  Then we went to the boathouse.  I told you.”  He set the glass and the pills on the table, but remained standing.
They stood facing each other, arms still wrapped loosely around.
*************************************************
John thought back to Mummy’s comments about Rhys from the night before.  “Well, fair fucks to him then.”  And he rang for Jensen.
“Obviously, John.  Now sit down.  You’re swaying where you’re standing.”
Sherlock looked up now, an intent expression as he studied John's face as he continued to move, gauging the effects of every motion, every part of the touch.  Finally John reached and put his hands over Sherlock’s, stilling them, and closed his eyes.
While John relaxed, Sherlock went into the bedroom to prepare.  He turned off the overhead light and turned on the bedside lamp.  He turned down the bedding and fluffed up the pillows.  He tucked a bottle of lube within arm's reach.  Perhaps some music?  He dug around in the sitting room until he found John’s iPod and set it to play something quiet, instrumental.
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
(See the end of the chapter for
At his shout, John perked up a bit.  “Oi indeed!  Don’t go drooling on my chair.”  He giggled.  “And stop pointing.”
He opened his eyes at Sherlock’s movement, surprised to see he’d moved even closer.
John nodded.  He knew that he’d just been gifted something very precious.  Even though they’d just met, he knew that Sherlock had never said anything like that to anyone else before.
“Hair stuck up in the back, like a hedgehog- laid down on your bed for a bit.  Skin not flushed, so not a wank.  Left ear red, right not, you were on the phone.  Insufferable grin- you were on the phone with a woman.  Not wearing your date shoes, so nothing on tonight.  I already know you are seeing Harry tomorrow night, so nothing then.  Deduction- you’ve set up a date for Friday night.”
“John?”
There was no doubt that anyone passing by would have known what was going on.  Sarah’s breath broke out of her with a short cry, and she bucked back onto John’s tongue as she came.  He continued working her clit until she begged him to stop, and he pulled his tongue back and began nuzzling her ass.  Her legs still shook, so he stood up, gathered her into his arms and tumbled them both back into the room and back onto the bed.
Surprisingly not boring, at least for one of them…
He concentrated.  Couldn’t let Mycroft take the drugs away again.  He opened his eyes.
Doctor Watson understood.  John Watson had a harder time with it, but finally acquiesced.  He let Mycroft’s towncar take him back to 221B.
“If we add an eighth note rest to measure 34, then the triplet in measure 35 will flow more smoothly,” he said.  “Don’t you agree?”
John was glad his head was down so Sherlock couldn’t see and deduce him.  He had to gather his thoughts before he could handle that.  Oh GOD he wished he wasn’t so wrecked this morning.
Sherlock still didn’t move, and John resigned himself to a quiet evening.  He stood to go.
“No.  It isn’t the building.  I mean, it isn’t the BUILDING.  It’s what it feels like.  Safe.  A place to go for, I don’t know, succor?  That’s an old-fashioned word, but yeah.  It’s a place I can pretend that someone gives a shit about me.”
Quite simply, A. Rhys Jones was stunning.  Tall, pale but not sallow, with auburn curls and green eyes that belied Irish ancestry instead of Welsh as his name suggested.  He wore a black tuxedo, but instead of the traditional white shirt, his was midnight blue with sparkling studs.  His smile was easy, and his dimples…  well, John always appreciated dimples on a woman, and was surprised to learn he felt the same way about them on a man.
Sherlock began to protest, but John held up a hand.
John nodded quickly- once, set his mouth and swallowed.  Captain Watson, hardened combat veteran, had arrived.
The DI shook his head.  “The closest we come is teddy bears used for drug smuggling, but that case is years old.  Solved, but the perpetrator was never caught, which is why I gave it to Sherlock.”
Sherlock laughed.  “I wish I’d recorded it then.  Shall I re-enact it?  ‘Oh pointy bird, oh pointy, pointy…’  Come here, you sot.”
“You told me to.”  John smiled, knowing Sherlock had no recollection.  “I was just sitting by the side of the bed, and you told me to get in and sleep.”
Drain the whole sea
“I seem to have found a new addiction.”
“That’s got to be where he went.  From the looks of it, the storefront is attached to the warehouses behind, but there are three stories in the front, and who knows how much behind.  We’re going to need help.”  John sat and assessed the building in front of him.  All his combat training was screaming that this was a bad idea, even with backup, but he didn’t know what else he could do besides go in.
The ferry and train that took such a short time on the journey from London felt glacial as John made his way back to the city.  He tried to figure out what had happened.  Greg had given him some information, but he’d have to get the whole picture when he got to the Yard.
“I don’t understand.  Can you explain that to me?”
Down underneath, where the river lapped at the pilings, he found him.  Sherlock was strung up by his arms, toes dangling in the water, passed out.  John yelled for help then ran to cut Sherlock down.
John knew that part of addiction was boredom.  He’d never accuse an addict of “just” being bored, but he knew that boredom let the mind wander, and a wandering mind can go down some dark alleys.  So step one in Operation Bad Cop was to keep Sherlock from being bored.
“Uh… ok then.  We’ll be back at this tomorrow, yeah?  G’night.”
Mummy laughed her throaty laugh, and kissed John delicately on the cheek, whispering “Children.  Always underfoot when they shouldn’t be.”  She turned to Mycroft and said “I’m just retiring now, dear.  Dr. Watson was kind enough to escort me home.”  She gave Mycroft a brief hug and went into her room.
Uh oh.
“Then come with me.”
Sherlock looked at him quizzically.  “Um… you were saying?”
“I’m not.”
“Please feel free to wear your brown suit, John. Don’t put yourself out getting something new. Afternoon, Sherlock. Thank you for the tea, Doctor.”
“I um… I brought a recording of it.  Nothing polished, but if you’d like to listen…”
Cotton wool.  Clouds.  Rabbits’ fur.  Pillows.  Water.  Candy floss.  Drugs.
He moved down her stomach now, his tongue running in long lines back and forth.  She kept her hands in his hair, just touching softly.  He was enjoying the feel of her skin and her body, relishing taking his time and appreciating the fact that she was letting him do so.  But each pass of his tongue drew closer and closer to the waistband of her panties.  It was time to see what delights they were concealing.
Looking up to make and hold eye contact for a few delicious moments.  Letting his eyes and his gaze become the dominant sensation.  That feeling of longing and sharing of pleasure, that was getting as much pleasure from the giving as the other.   John was amazed at the realization that Sherlock, Sherlock Holmes- “Relationships aren’t my area” wanted him.  Wanted to please him, to BE with him.  He shuddered, then a sudden smooth drop down his shaft made him gasp.  Not all the way to the bottom, but enough that Sherlock’s mouth was enveloping him.
Sherlock carefully undid the button, then the zipper, on John’s jeans and pushed them down.  John raised his hips as much as he was able, and Sherlock made quick work of the pants too.
Before John could protest, he was dragged away.  Mummy tossed back her head and laughed.
John’s jaw dropped.  Sherlock was strutting across the stage in his big black boots, fishnet stockings, hot pants, and a shiny black corset.  His eyes were lined with kohl and his hair was styled long and silky.  He stabbed the tip of Mycroft’s umbrella onto the stage and snapped his hips in time with the music.
*********************************
When John was fully relaxed, Sherlock stopped.  “Take a few minutes more to soak, and then come into the bedroom.  Don’t let the water get cold, you’ll tense up again.”
“That’s the anesthesia, and some other things.  It should be wearing off soon, you’ve been out of surgery for several hours.  You had us all worried, Sherlock.  You took quite a beating, and required quite a bit of fixing up.”
When the song faded, and Sherlock slumped onto the floor, they looked at each other in amazement.  In the darkness, it was difficult to tell whose eyes had more tears glistening.
John stepped forward and around, so he could get to Sherlock’s back, and began unwinding the dressing.  He hadn’t seen Sherlock’s torso in the hospital, and gasped at the horrific bruising.  Sherlock heard it, and glanced in the mirror.
At the end of her introduction, to quiet applause, the cellist walked from the back of the room and took his seat in the curve of the piano, instrument between his knees.  He looked up and beamed at Mummy and John heard the quiet intake of breath from all corners of the room.
“I’m going to touch your cock, I want to feel you in my hands, I want to stroke you while you’re in my arms, is that ok?”  Sherlock’s already deep voice was barely more than a vibration against John’s back at that point.  John nodded again, breathing heavily.
John picked up his letter and went upstairs.
Amen, Amen, Amen
Sherlock didn’t answer and John turned back.  He was struck by the look on Sherlock’s face, something akin to wonder, puzzlement, a struggle to understand.  It was gone in a blink, and Sherlock stammered “No…no.  That’s caviar.  A sort of ‘fish berry’ jam.  You’ll like it.  It’s salty.”
John knew that RSVP meant that he should let someone know that he would be attending the recital. But there was no number to call, no email, and not enough time to send a response via post. He didn’t attend many posh parties, ok- ANY posh parties to be truthful, and didn’t want to mess this one up right out of the gate.
The day of the competition arrived, and Sherlock all but pushed John out of the flat.
choice for a man of his generous nature.” the announcer said, with a wink.  The audience chuckled.
John’s hands tightened in Sherlock’s hair as they moved against each other, Sherlock moaned at the sensation and John shuddered.  “Sherlock, I’m close…”
John’s head jerked up.  “Of course I do.”
Heart monitor?
*************************************
********************************************
Sherlock reached to the nightstand and pulled back with some lube.  He raised up just a bit, enough to lube their cocks just a touch.  He laid back down and began to thrust his hips.
Oh.  This was better.  He didn’t have to see Sherlock’s face then, or be distracted by his skin.
“Pretty good actually.”
“And here I was excited about near-decapitation in lorry accident.”
Sherlock‘s eyes were hard.  “John.  I need you to tell me what you know about what happened to me, then I need you to get the police reports from Lestrade.  I don’t want anything held back.  I’m missing time.  I need it back.  It’s MINE.”
The curtains opened to a stylized street scene, with a painted backdrop of shops and a lamppost off to the side.  Sherlock, dressed in a plain black suit, white shirt, and black tie stood center stage, leaning casually on Mycroft’s umbrella.  Uncharacteristically, he had a fedora smashed low on his curls, and wore the shiny black boots that John had signed for.  Before John could puzzle any further, however, the music started, Gene Kelly’s voice came over the speaker system and Sherlock began to dance.
The first shot was of him kissing Mummy’s hand.  He smiled, remembering her laugh, her soft skin, that moment full of possibilities.
John stopped when he saw Sherlock’s face, pale with pain and surprise, his mouth open and panting with the exertion of not crying out more.  His eyes were full of agony as he looked up.
“You.  Us.  Everything we have, and everything it could be.”
“Oi.  Sherlock.  A little help here?”
“So, John.  It seems we have to talk.”
Several hours later, both John and Sherlock were kitted out with new suits- everything from pocket squares to pants to socks and shoes. John’s ensemble was dark blue, almost black, and shot through with widely-spaced, white pinstripes. A waistcoat helped define his trim waist, and the blue tie and square brought out the color of his eyes. He gaped as he stood in front of the tailor’s mirrors. “Sherlock! I look like a movie star!” Sherlock smiled warmly. “I wouldn’t go that far, John, but it is nice to see you out of those horrid jumpers.”
Despite his assurances, John was worried about Sherlock and what would happen if there was no case before he left.  He’d spent so much energy keeping Sherlock’s mind occupied over the past few months, he wasn’t sure what would happen if Sherlock had to go, for lack of a better term, cold turkey.  Not for the first time, John found himself wishing for a nice juicy murder.  Oh God.  What had he become?
They sat in silence again, until they’d finished their beers.  Then Sherlock got two more and John began to talk.  All about Harry, all about churches, all about his anger, his feeling of betrayal.
Once John was again comfortable, Sherlock increased the pressure of his caresses.  A little lower, a little closer to John’s nipples… enough to hint, but not enough to distress.  He needed to know what John would accept.  But he was patient, surprisingly so.  He took his time, knowing that this was too important to rush, knowing that he was forming their future with his hands.
“So bloody hot.  Those tights should be illegal, let me taste your ink, dear God you…”
******************************************
After a minute, Sherlock began to move.  He ran his nose up and down the crease where John’s leg met his hip.  He nuzzled John’s balls, he nipped gently at his thighs, all the while avoiding the place John most wanted him to touch.
“You don’t touch me.  I mean, you touch me, but you don’t… we haven’t…  I want…”  Sherlock broke off, frustrated by his stammering, hoping that John understood anyway.  They hadn’t done anything sexually intimate since that memorable blowjob on the couch.
Once fully exposed to each other, he pushed Sherlock toward the wall of the church. The pair drew close again, but this time Sherlock wrapped one long leg around John’s waist.
John, on the other hand, was practically giddy. With his new suit and freshly cut hair, he felt like a teenager going to a formal dance. He glanced at Sherlock and revised his thoughts. A teenager going to a formal dance with the best looking date in school. He tapped his fingers on his knees and grinned widely.
He rolled over on his back, and propped himself up with a few of the seemingly dozens of pillows on the bed.  He kicked off his pajama bottoms and his pants, and then pulled his tshirt off as well.  Naked on the silky sheets (what WAS the thread count on these anyway?) he began to run his fingers lightly over his torso.
Right.  He was never drinking again.  He’d said it before, but this time he meant it.
“Spot on.  Evidently he’s ‘quite helpful’ and pointy.”  John’s air quotes nearly overturned the empty mugs in front of the duo.
“I bloody well know how that feels.”  John waved for another pint.  Did he ever know how that felt.
“You’ll what?” John growled, as he thrust his hips harder.  “You have no idea what I can do with my clothes still on.”  John was definitely feeling better, and was practically giddy at the thought of driving Sherlock to distraction.  “I can make you feel so good, I want to make you feel good.”
Sherlock flopped over on the sofa in a huff. “Because Mummy means to torture me.”
John fumed in the cab all the way from Baker Street to the hospital.  How could he have let himself get drugged like that?  Bloody MYCROFT.  Oh he’d bloody Mycroft alright.  BLOODY HIS NOSE.
Mummy offered her arm, and John took it.  With her free hand, she reached down and removed the treacherous heels, bringing her down to just below eye level with the doctor.  With the practiced air of someone used to getting her way, she handed him her shoes, and they walked from the room, arm in arm.
“Dinner?”
“Yes, I remember you telling me that.  What I don’t remember is you telling me that you left Sarah alone on the Isle of Wight, that you went down into Vauxhall alone, that you beat someone nearly to death to gather information on where to find me, that you were the one who found me at the boathouse, that you were the one who cut me down and carried me out, that you nearly came to blows when told you couldn’t ride in the ambulance with me and lastly- that you slept in my hospital bed with me, after my surgery.”  His voice had risen steadily, and he was nearly shouting.
Mummy had gone all out for the concert.  The drive of Holmes Manor was strung with fairy lights, and dark-uniformed valets waited at the massive front doors to whisk away vehicles and stow bags for the guests who would be spending the night.  In the twilight it appeared as though thousands of fireflies magically made the autos and luggage disappear.
As the last note of the short piece rang out, John was broken from his reverie by a noise from Sherlock.  Something between a gasp and a moan, it was shocking.  Sherlock was open-mouthed, eyes flashing.  If John didn’t know better, he’d have said he was aroused.
“So, tell me.  You don’t like church, but you like churches.  You say you go to churches to feel like someone cares about you.  You do know that’s why most people go, right?  Because they believe in a higher power that loves unconditionally?”
***************************************
She stopped and turned in his embrace.  “This is my room, John.”
“You can’t go in the ambulance, John, it isn’t allowed.”  Greg hated to say that, but it was the truth.
John filled his plate and flagged down a waiter for a flute of champagne.  He left Sherlock’s side and went to stand at a tall table along the edge of the room.  Exhaling slowly, he clenched and unclenched his fist.  It wasn’t as though he was a total peasant, and he knew he looked good in his new suit, but he felt completely out of his element here.  The limo, the scotch, the fairy lights, the butler, the mother, the food, the drink…  Food and drink.  At least he could relate to that.  He wolfed down the hors d’oeuvres and scanned the gathering, absently wishing for a beer and some crap telly.
“He pointed things out that OTHER people would have missed.  Tall pointy bastard.  And he drooled on the sofa.  Didn’t want any tea.”  John slumped a little, grumbling.
??  Not John.  John never demands.  John says please.  Lovely John.
They kissed again, slower, longer.
Mummy has a protégé, a dashing, talented, posh young cellist. She holds a salon concert for him, which Sherlock and John attend.
They settled themselves on the sofa, one at each end, feet tangled in the middle.  Sherlock took his meds and drank his water, and then they looked at each other awkwardly.
“Stop.  Let me continue.  I need you, John.  I need you to make me tea, and clean up my messes, and make sure I eat.”
John was left with the same uneasy feeling that he had when listening to Sherlock and Mycroft deduce him- like they could read his mind.  He just nodded.
“The John Watson who played with The Doctors?  Blimey.  I haven’t seen you in ages.  Mike Stamford, used to lug around your kit when you were just startin’ out.  You guys were IT, man!  Cuttin’ edge stuff.  Razor’s edge.  KNIFE edge.  What happened?”
The dreadful sounds from the bathroom stopped, so Sherlock ventured in with a glass of water and a clean flannel.  John was sitting on the floor, head in his hands, elbows on his knees.
**********************************************************************
Wait.  Texts.
************************************
Then he looked at the photo.  OH.
He’d discarded his t-shirt the second time he played the song.  Sweat rolled down his pale skin, making the black tattoos glisten.  His dark curls clung damply to his forehead, framing his icy eyes.  His chest heaved.
John’s voice caught in his throat.  He knew that Mycroft had been here, and talked with Sherlock yesterday.  It was on his chart.  Obviously this is what the doctor had mentioned, that the anesthesia jumbled Sherlock’s memories.
“Poor lump.  Sherlock’s enough to drive anyone to drink.”
me into performing in a ‘Celebrity Lip Sync’ contest for charity.”
“Right then.  Off it goes.”  It was a good thing it wasn’t one of Sherlock’s favorite shirts.
The case of the dead bears is real:  http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/curious--unusual-deaths-834476
The kitchen suddenly seemed too bright, to harsh, all sharp edges and tile.  John was desperate to move somewhere softer, darker, but didn’t want to break the spell he and Sherlock were weaving.
It took ages, and one potentially embarrassing wrong door (Thank goodness Auntie Vera IS deaf) before John found his room.  It was nice, he thought.  A bit larger than his room in 221B, a bit smaller than the parlor.  A queen bed filled much of the space, with a comfortable chair and wardrobe as well.  He was pleased to see his suitcase had been unpacked, his pajamas laid out on the coverlet, his shaving kit visible on the bathroom counter.
John nodded.  “Ok.  Can you tell which one he was working on most recently?  Has he written on anything?”
A fresh poison each week
“Am I interrupting anything?”
“Then why church?”
John had never been so glad or so frustrated to see the elder Holmes.  He blushed from tip to tails, and rapidly released his grasp.
"What do people usually say?"
******************************
******************************
Sherlock was asleep, as he was when John left earlier, but he looked better.  Not so pale, not so clammy.  He’d regained some color and his breaths were even.  John released the breath he’d been holding, and sat down.  He reached for Sherlock’s hand and brought it to his forehead, holding it there for a moment before resting it back on the bed in both of hands.  He leaned over and put his head on the rail at the side of the bed.
That was all it took to send Sherlock over the edge.  He struggled to keep his eyes open, John was gorgeous and sexy and so very NOT ordinary.  He must remember to tell…  and then his mind was blank.  He gasped and screwed his eyes shut as his own orgasm raced through him, and he collapsed.
John left his therapist’s office in a foul mood.  Why did she ask such stupid questions?  And why did he come up with such stupid answers?  Succor.  Who even talks like that?  But deep down he knew why he said what he did.  He did feel safe in a church, like someone cared.
When their breath stilled, John reached for his tshirt and cleaned them off somewhat.  He laid back and Sherlock snuggled up against him, their arms wrapped around each other.
“Don’t get your knickers in a twist, Mate.  That’s where we’re goin’, right over there.”
She shook her head and glared at him, the effect ruined by her smile.
He put one hand on John’s right shoulder, the other hand grasped the back of John’s neck.  Pulling, pushing in tempo with the music, his eyes never leaving John’s face.
At the doctor’s assurance that Sherlock wouldn’t be waking anytime within the next half hour or so, John went and redeemed his gift card, thanking Mycroft silently for the reprieve from the dreadful hospital coffee.
By the time he returned to Baker Street Monday night, with a bag full of Chinese take away, he was done in.  Flu season was starting, and, as every doctor knows, when flu season starts, hypochondria season is fast on its heels.  John spent two days straight reassuring people that they had the sniffles, not the plague, not ebola and, in response to  one spectacular case of “I read it on the Internet, it must be true” he convinced a Mr. Doyle that he most definitely did NOT have anoplocephala perfoliata, as that was a tapeworm only found in HORSES.
Something prickled at the back of his mind.  Something about his chair.  Something about reading in his chair.  He didn’t think too hard, he didn’t want to injure any more brain cells.
John hugged her, and kissed her cheek.  He’d tried for her lips but she turned.
“Oh God yes.”
He held his breath, and stilled his hands low on John’s belly.  Waiting.
“Not really, John.  My entry into this contest was supposed to be a joke.  He assumed I would fail spectacularly, so he offered to provide the entirety of Meridian Imports’ donation.  He’s out £22,750 and his second-best umbrella.
Neither the detective nor the cellist acknowledged his presence, so he shook his head and left.
Where had this song come from?
105 Essex Road, Islington
“The case was a total bust.  We actually figured out most of it before Sherlock even arrived.”  Lestrade looked abashed.  “The corpses were BEARS.  Himalayan Blue bears to be exact, never seen in Britain before.  Turns out a collector with more money than conscience had them shipped here, beheaded and skinned them for their heads and pelts, and dumped the corpses in the river.  Some poor git saw them floating near Hackney and called us.  By the time I got there and saw what they were, it was too late to call off Sherlock.”  Greg ran his hands over his face.  “What a bloody scene that was.  He was furious, lit the whole team up like bonfire night, and spared no feelings.  He really is a right prat when you’re not around, John.  Anyway- right in the midst of his tirade he got this look, like someone poleaxed him.  He yelled “TAXIDERMY” and took off like a shot.  Grabbed the first cab and that’s the last I saw of him.  Must have been around 6pm Friday.”
If Lestrade had a thing against cigarettes, it was NOTHING compared to his annoyance at Sherlock’s tattoos.  He had a few even before he left the troupe, and it was always a pain to cover them up.  Costumes didn’t always cover them, and most times he sweat through any makeup.  His partners complained that he smeared their leotards with it, adding to the expanding list of reasons they wouldn’t dance with him.
Sherlock moved, gasped, and shook his head in a near panic.  He didn’t speak.
“Been a slow week for you, eh Sherlock?  No cases.”
“Case?”
John's on the case... can he solve it without Sherlock?
There were many things that John envied about Sherlock, but at this moment, the Mind Palace was at the top of the list.  To be able to compartmentalize, to put something away and think about it later.  John’s mind wasn’t nearly as dull as Sherlock thought, he was a doctor after all.  He was a crack shot and a good officer and a smart man.  But he could not turn his thoughts on and off without distractions.
Sherlock was sprawled on the couch, one arm flung up covering his eyes.  His knees were drawn up, and John could see his pale toes scrunched into the cushions.  He looked comfortable, but cold to John’s eye.
I should've worshipped her sooner
John reached around and grabbed Sherlock’s arse and thrust up as best he could.  “Yes.  God yes.”  He grunted and grabbed and gasped as Sherlock drove against him.  “Sherlo…” the name was cut short as John was swept into his orgasm.  His eyes slammed shut and he bit down hard.  His breath hissed between his teeth as he inhaled quickly, then released with a groan as he coated his stomach.  His head threw back and his mouth opened.  His hips stuttered against Sherlock’s.
**************
“John! Get up John! We’re going shopping!” Sherlock bound into John’s room and began rummaging through the wardrobe.
“Yeh, I decided to try my hand at promotin’.  The money’s better, I work twice as hard, but lift half as much as I did when I was luggin’ your lot around.  And I don’t have to stay up half the night waitin’ for a gig to finish.  I mostly do independent stuff, some small bands in small venues, some music videos, hell, I’ve even branched out- got a performance art gig for a ballet dancer last week.”
Only then I am clean
He put his mug down and opened the envelope.  Inside were photographs, professionally taken during Rhys’ recital.  John vaguely remembered the photographer lurking about.
“Oh no need, John. I’ve already taken the liberty to mark both of you down as attending. Your invite was just a courtesy. I assumed you would be Sherlock‘s plus one, and he is, after all, a required guest.”
John snorted with sad laughter.
All John's rocking was pushing him back and forth against Sherlock's erection.  He began to move his own hips in time with John's, and began to stroke his lover's cock harder.  "You are the most amazing man.  I've wanted this.  I knew you'd feel so good against me.  I'm close and it's all you, John.  Your cock is so hard in my hand, and I can feel your arse against me.  You drive me crazy, I just want to feel you everywhere. God look at yourself.  Do you know how hot you are and how hot you're making me?"
John shivered as Sherlock laid his head down, his cheek on John’s rapidly hardening cock.  Neither man moved.  Sherlock lay there quietly, breathing in John’s scent, and John tilted his head back, relishing the closeness.
John drew the blanket over Sherlock,  then settled down to eat his dinner.
“Sixteen annnd seventeen.  Here we go.”
He thought about it before he spoke.
John emerged from the bathroom in a swirl of steam.  Pink and still damp, wet hair spiking.  He was wearing only a towel around his waist and a grin.
**************************************
.  Second best.”  And left.
“I’m John, I’m his… I’m his friend.”
“If you go, John, we’ll never know what we could have been.”  Sarah looked sad.
You heard them say it
“He refused to dance to the song I picked.  He said it won’t convey what I want it to.  Who does he think he is?  I’m the artist, I’m the one who made the whole thing up- how does he know what I want it to convey?”
John’s mind was reeling.  He’d been in similar situations dozens of times.  He knew how it could end up and it terrified him.  There was no doubt in his mind that he wanted this woman, there were just a few doubts that she wanted him in return.  But could he?  With Sherlock’s mother?
Sherlock regarded him warily.  “Why would I do that?  What else was going on?  You know I’ll find out, so just tell me.”
“John’s at home.  He’s fine.  Asleep.  I had Anthea… assist in that matter.  I needed to talk to you before he did. “  He sat on the uncomfortable chair.  “I know you’re still recovering, but I need you to think about two things.  First- what were you doing at that taxidermy shop alone?”  His tone was sharp, and Sherlock closed his eyes to escape. “Second…” Mycroft’s tone softened.  “You need to think about John. “
“But what if I need you here?”
His blood ran cold, as he dialed the Yard.
To keep the goddess on my side
As they kissed, they were illuminated by a bright flash.  They turned, and could see that a storm was brewing outside.  A faint rumble of thunder followed a few moments later.  John closed his eyes and offered a silent thanks.
None of the Holmes family was in attendance, so John made small talk with a few straggling guests and the housekeeper.  He walked around the gardens, he perused the books in the library.
“It’s ok John.  Mike told me about why you don’t play with The Doctors anymore.  That was a right brave thing you did, and having a therapist to help you through recovery isn’t anything to be embarrassed about.  You sound a lot like Sherlock, you know?  Always searching for passion.  Don’t let him put you off tonight, by the way.  He’s a handful, but deep down he’s a good person, and he wants this to work just as much as any of us.”
“Yes.  Something is terribly wrong, and if I don’t fix it…”  Sherlock couldn’t finish the sentence.  How could he say “If I don’t fix it I’ll die” to Rhys?
Lestrade looked at his once-again unassuming friend, back at the delinquent bleeding on the floor, and shook his head.  “Remind me never to piss you off, Mate.”
“Don’t be coy, Doctor.  I’m well aware that the military does not invalid anyone unless they’re seriously injured.  Don’t sell yourself short.  You’ve made a remarkable recovery.”
John thought.  Thought about Sherlock and Mrs. Hudson, the tenderness there.  He thought about Sherlock and The Woman- the sad songs after her supposed death.  He thought about the ashtray from Buckingham Palace, the dinners out when John was the only one eating, the violin on the nights he woke up panting from nightmares…
She demands a sacrifice
As the applause died down, the next piece started, again- John was mesmerized and Sherlock entranced.  By the end of the concert (6 pieces in all) Sherlock looked positively undone, flushed and breathing hard, his pupils dilated to a point John had never seen before.  He grinned at the thought.  His stoic flat mate, aloof and above, wrecked.
The three men ran up the steps to 221B.  John paused momentarily before trying the knob, hoping that it would be unlocked.  Hoping that Sherlock would be inside.
An irritated noise came from behind them.  “John, if you’re quite through with your juvenile advances toward my mother,” Sherlock spat out, “we should see about getting you something to eat.  The scotch in the limousine obviously went right to your head.”
"Good.  This is wonderful, John.  We could do this every night for the rest of our lives and I'd be happy.  God.  The feel of you in my arms, pressing against me... the sounds you're making...  I'm hard, John, I'm hard for you,"  Sherlock pushed his hips against John's back gently, proving his words.  "But you never have to do any more than this.  I've never wanted anyone before, in any way, and I'll take whatever you give me, just let me keep touching you."
He stopped, bright red.  Would he ever learn to keep his mouth shut?
John‘s eyes widened even further.  “Oh yes,” Mummy said with a wicked smile.  “I believe Sherlock is right up Rhys’ alley, don’t you?”
“Wait.  You’re asking me to choose between you and my best friend, who’s gone missing? Sarah!  You know… you should know, that I will always go when he needs me.”
Sherlock was thin and pale in the harsh fluorescent light of the bathroom.  He balanced on one foot, with one hand on the sink.  The other held a towel around his hips.  “I assume we’ll have to remove the bandages from around my ribs?”
“Yes, me too, kiss me, your mouth, let me…”
Sherlock wiped his face with a towel.  His practice studio was warm and humid, he’d been dancing for hours, just by himself, to music he alone heard.  He threw a t-shirt on, and a pair of trainers.  He looked down at his tights, they were ancient, ratty, and from a distance you couldn’t even tell he was wearing them.  He shrugged and left, grabbing his car keys and slippers as he ran out the door, too excited to change, hoping that finally something would be interesting.
John didn’t open his eyes.  “Hmmm?”  He snuggled his face onto Sherlock’s thighs as he lay across the couch, dozing while Sherlock wandered his Mind Palace.
The bell rang and Sherlock heard Mrs. Hudson open the door.  One set of footsteps up- must be someone familiar.  Must be Lestrade.  Greg knocked gently and stuck his head in.
He went into the flat through the kitchen door, that was the closest to the bins.  No sense in dragging junk mail into the house any further than he had to.  Bills went on the sideboard, and he turned the large envelope over in his hands.
John grinned and walked away.
John closed the front door with his foot, his hands full of Tesco bags. All in all, it had been a decent trip to the store, even with the texts from Sherlock asking for lemonade, 4 glue sticks, and “as many Brussels sprouts as would fit in a miniature horse’s mouth.”  (John guessed eight)
“You were right, about my… thing.  I was a musician, and had to stop.  Tried to help someone out and got stabbed for my troubles.  My band dumped me, my therapist thinks I’m in denial, my job’s shite, I’m not playing, and I’m beyond bored.”
“I can do a shitty Highland jig, and I can grind out a slow dance, but nah.  Nothin’ like you can do.  That’s amazing.  That’s art.  The way you move, Christ Sherlock.  Have you seen yourself?  It’s like…”
The curtains closed after LAMDA’s team wowed the audience with a near-professional production of
“I’m telling you, Mike.  The song is perfect, oh and the way Sherlock DANCED!  I’ve never seen anything like that either, it was raw, it was passionate, it was perfect!  Call me back when you get this.”
“Alright then?  Out you go.  Here’s your towel and your robe- are you ok to finish up?  I’ll go get your medicine and meet you in your room.”  John practically fled the bathroom.
“Sherlock, what the hell?  You have to talk to me.  Tell me what’s going on.  My brain is still trying to rebuild from last night, I don’t know what’s going on.  I’m confused.”
Lestrade sighed, and wondered if he wanted to have this discussion right now.  He tugged at his hair again.
He was bored with the tiny ballerinas and their severe hair and their painted faces.  They were strong, yes, but they lacked the passion he felt.  Maybe one or two prima ballerinas in the world could match his spirit, but for whatever reason, history or spite, they refused to dance with him.  So he was left with boring painted dancing dolls and he hated it.
He smiled to himself as he realized what he’d just thought.  “Mummy’s perfume…”  He didn’t even know her name.  He supposed it didn’t matter in the long run.
He kneeled, exhausted and panting, in the middle of the floor.  Red scratches stood out like brands on his skin from where he’d dragged his nails across his torso.  He was drained.  He was exhilarated.
I'll tell you my sins and you can sharpen your knife
John blanched and made to step away, but Sherlock reached out and grabbed his wrist.  “You saved me, John.”  Sherlock’s voice was quiet, and he looked intently into his flat mate’s face.  “Why didn’t you tell me?”
“I know where we are, I know how many steps there are to my own FLAT.  Stop treating me like an invalid.”  Sherlock was fuming.  His chest was wrapped tightly to ease the pain in his ribs,  he was using crutches to keep off his ankle, the incision in his left side itched and his head was pounding.   All he wanted was to stop feeling terrible.
******************************************
John held up his phone.  “MP3, should be good to at least hear it.”
They looked through the papers again, and Mycroft called from the kitchen.
It wasn’t.  He wasn’t.
“So.  How’s the song coming?”
The rest of the morning passed uneventfully, John found his way to the dining room and indulged in a full and proper English breakfast, minus the mushrooms.  After living with Sherlock for as long as he had, there was just something about fungus that didn’t sit right.
"That.  Was.  Amazing" Sherlock whispered.
Oh.  Not drugs.  Not John.  Wait.  Where is John?
Sherlock’s days blurred.  It didn’t even bother him anymore, that he wasn’t onstage.  At least, that’s what he told himself every time he stepped into 221B.
With those lyrics Sherlock perched on the edge of the stage directly in front of John, writhing and mouthing the words while looking directly into John’s wide eyes.  A quick wink and he strode backstage, dragging the umbrella behind him and swinging his hips.
He made his way upstairs and opened the sitting room door onto a familiar scene. The Holmes brothers locked in a silent argument.  He turned toward the kitchen and set down the bags.
“John… angry?”  Why couldn’t he form the words?  What had happened to him?  He shook his head again.  “I’m hurt?”
“That’s the other part of what I do.  I’m a doctor.  I keep people healthy.”
John looked around.  “What?”
He wanted to get up and dance too.  Or drink.  Or fuck.  Or all three.
He’d studied ballet his whole life.  From the first time he saw Rudolph Nureyev dance he was hooked.  Even on his parents’ tiny, grainy, black and white TV he could see the power in the leaps, the passion flashing in the Russian’s eyes.  During Sherlock’s first visit to Paris as a professional dancer, he laid two dozen white roses on Nureyev’s grave and wept.
****************************************
Molly stood, dumfounded.  Had Sherlock actually complimented her work?  And the way he spoke- she had never heard anyone talk about anything like that before.  He was fiery, he was enthralling.  She couldn’t wait to see him dance.
“That's not what people normally say.”
“Stand there, I’ll be right back.”
“If you are set on using this song, I am afraid you will have to find another dancer.  I cannot in good conscience dance to something in which I no longer believe.”
“Uh, Sherlock? What’s ‘semi-formal or black lounge’ mean?”
They approached the first door.  John stood to one side and the DI slipped in, then followed hot on his heels.  The room was big, square, and full of drug-making equipment.  It looked like they got there just as it was being packed up, it was partially dismantled, some was in boxes.  There were two men inside, with their backs to the door.
********************************************
His eyes shot open with the realization that it was Sherlock cuddled up to him, they were in his hospital bed and OH MY GOD.
There was a sleek black town car waiting to pick John up at the station, surprisingly, Mycroft and Lestrade were both inside, next to each other on the broad back seat.  John sat facing them.
Sherlock guided them both around, leading John with hands on his hips.
Since leaving the ballet, he’d invested in this tattoo parlour, 221B.  221 separate ballet productions, all B-hind him.  The name was ridiculous, but it helped that it was also the address of the shop.  He could pretend it had no meaning.
When the clock struck, a set of tall doors off the side of the ballroom opened, and Jensen entered the room, coughing politely.  “If you would all please follow me…”  John swigged the last of his champagne and joined the dozens of others slowly making their way into the conservatory.  Still not seeing Sherlock, he wondered again why he bothered to show up.
Every Sunday's getting more bleak
He pulled back and waited for John to respond.
Sherlock sighed and flopped onto the sofa. “Not us this time, John. Just me. This is yet another instance in the long line of Mycroft’s attempts to humiliate me.  He has
She's the last true mouthpiece
Molly frowned, but went to her car to get the water.
hover around us while we pray;
John physically felt much, much better.  His head still pounded, but he wasn’t as queasy.  Now though, it was his heart that hurt.  He’d have to leave 221B.  Oh Sherlock might say it was ok for him to stay, but if Rhys was going to be there, John couldn’t bear it.  So he’d leave.  Maybe he could stay with Greg for a while, until he found his own place.  He could be out today, if he had to be.  He choked back a small sob.  What had he done?  What did he say last night?  He remembered Greg helping him up the stairs, he remembered yelling.  Who was he yelling at?  What did he say?
“Isn’t that enough?  Besides, I’m perfectly ready to inform all of London that you go back on your bets.”
John rolled his shoulders and stretched.  “I wasn’t asleep, I was dozing.  I nodded off after dinner- food coma.  Do you want yours?  I got egg drop soup for you.”  Without waiting for an answer he went to the kitchen to heat up the soup.  “I thought we’d wait a few days before trying anything spicy.  I know you’re tired of plain broth, and want actual food, but you’re still really weak internally.  This will be a good compromise.”
They sat for a moment, breathing and acclimating.  John could feel Sherlock’s heart beating against his back, and became aware that his slowed to match.  He felt heavier with each exhale and finally sighed in contentment.
Right.  Shower.  Pub.  Distractions.
In the madness and soil of that sad earthly scene
John swallowed and nodded.  The week’s traumas had robbed Sherlock of what little extra body fat he’d had stored up.  He looked… fragile.
John stopped and turned.
Surprisingly, John managed a week of full shifts at the clinic in a row, no cases on, London’s criminal underworld seemingly on holiday.  Even so, Sherlock spent much of his time out of the flat, John assumed he was rehearsing.
When he awoke 9 hours later, it occurred to him that he should have been more curious.
******************************
Sherlock breathed again, against John’s ear, and smiled to see the reaction in John’s cock.  He moved his hands down John’s thighs as far as he could, palm to skin, pressing as far as he could reach.  Then back up to John’s shoulders, crossing so that he ended up wrapping him tightly in an embrace.  As his arms tightened, so did his legs, engulfing his blogger, feeling as much as he could.
What was it that Harry told him about Clara before everything went to shit?  “She’s so funny, Johnny.  She could make a widow laugh at a funeral.  And she’s so strong- like- she knows people don’t approve of her being gay, but she doesn’t care.  I wish I’d met her sooner.”  He wondered if he’d ever find someone that made him feel that way.
“No need.  Rhys was here already, so he went with me.  Quite helpful too, pointed out some bits that other people would have missed.”
Amen, Amen, Amen
John was stunned at his revelation.  He knew he was fond of Sherlock, that he loved Sherlock more than anyone else in his life, but did he really see Sherlock THAT WAY?
Neither Sherlock nor Rhys even noticed.
John tensed, and sucked in his breath.  Sherlock twisted his right hand on the upstroke, and pinched John's nipple with his left.  That's all it took and John swept into his orgasm, bucking and moaning Sherlock's name.  His motion brought Sherlock to the edge, and hearing his name on John's lips, at this moment, was enough to send him over as well.
*************************************************
“You were badly injured, Sherlock.  You have broken ribs, your ankle is damaged, you had to have surgery to stop internal bleeding.  Today is Wednesday.  You can go home today, if you think you’re up for it.”
By the time Lestrade returned, panting and bruised, John was standing calmly by the trussed thug, rubbing his knuckles and thinking.  The criminal was out cold, bleeding from his nose, his lip, and a cut on the right side of his face.  Lestrade raised his eyebrows.
Sherlock desperately hoped he wouldn’t be disappointed.  He needed to dance like other people needed drugs.  And he needed the purest hit, nothing less than unbridled passion would do anymore.  He wondered if he’d ever find it.
“Thank you for shopping at Regular Chemist.  Piss right the hell off.”
Holmes Manor was sprawling, with seemingly endless staircases and hallways.  John’s usual sense of direction and place was already diminished from champagne and brandy, but Mummy’s perfume and her touch on his arm intoxicated him completely.  He was lost on several levels within minutes of leaving the library.
Sherlock shushed him and smiled.  “Let’s go to the sofa.”
“Dr. John Watson” it read, in smooth navy script on the thick cream paper. “The honour of your presence is requested. A debut recital featuring cellist Mr. A. Rhys Jones. Friday, 27 September 7:00 P.M. Holmes Manor, Sussex. Semi-Formal or Black Lounge. RSVP”
John didn’t reply, just made sure the man had enough circulation in his hands.
“Well then.  Mike says you’ve written a song?  Can I see it?”
“You need to buy some sticking plasters?  Maybe some paracetamol?”
Knows everybody's disapproval
“I’ll drive him home, Molly.”
John raised an eyebrow, but complied.  He sank into the heat and the foam and sighed.  As he did, Sherlock removed his own shirt and slacks, but kept his pants on.  He got a clean flannel from the cupboard and wet it.  Slowly, he began to run the cloth over John’s shoulders and the back of his neck.
“What am I going to do, Sherlock?  I’m a mess.  I thought I knew.  I thought I could be happy with Sarah and with the way things were between you and me.  And then you disappeared.  I’m still so tired.  Bloody Mycroft drugging me.  I’m so confused and so tired.  What am I going to do?”
Interesting.
John sighed.  Shit.  So much for nobody seeing.  On the plus side, though, at least Mycroft seemed OK with it.
They searched, but nothing leapt out.  John went to look at the cold case files with Lestrade.  “OK.  Taxidermy.  Animals.  Dead animals.  Do any of these cases have anything to do with animals?”
“Because it was YOU.  Because I was trying to save YOU.  I would break every law, every bone in someone’s body, go through hell to make sure you were ok.  There.  Are you happy?  I thought I’d be happy with Sarah, and trust me- she’s great.  She’s smart and sexy and fantastic in bed.  I could spend days learning her skin, and even longer learning her taste.  The sex was amazing, the time we spent together was amazing.  But the moment, the SECOND I heard your name from Lestrade’s mouth I couldn’t leave her fast enough.  Shit.  I left her in bed.  Naked.  Begging me to stay.  I was out the door before I’d even puckered up for a proper goodbye kiss.  And then that man.  He was so sure you’d die before I got to you.  So sure I was soft and kind and wasn’t a threat.  A good cop, unable to step over the line.  I showed him I was able, yeah.  I beat it out of him.  I told him if you died, so would he and I pistol whipped him, broke his ribs and beat him to the point of unconsciousness to drive my point home.  Because he, or someone in his organization, threatened YOU.  And I climbed in your bed happily.  Eager to feel your breathing, to reassure myself that you were alive.  So tell me, Mr. Consulting Detective.  What does that all mean?”  John was pacing, red faced.  He stopped and turned to Sherlock.  “Tell me what it means.”
He shoved the photos into Sherlock’s hands.  “Look at these and deduce.  I have to go.”
John turned to Mycroft.  “What do you know?”
“Have you ever tried dancing?”
John was amazed.  Sherlock was light and graceful and smiling like he was having the time of his life.  He twirled the umbrella, then leapt up onto the base of the lamppost and spun around it like he was a born dancer.
Sherlock pulled at the flies of John’s jeans.  “Too many layers, need to see, need to feel…”
John’s days blurred.  It didn’t even bother him anymore, that he wasn’t onstage.  At least, that’s what he told himself every time he clocked in for another shift at “Regular Chemist.”  Christ.  Even the name of the place was boring.
our wakening and uprising prove;
John clenched his jaw, looked at the ceiling, and swallowed.  For a moment, Sherlock wasn’t sure he’d respond, but then he let out a great sigh and sat down at the table.
John pulled out his mobile and looked.  He hadn’t received a single text from Sherlock since Saturday morning.  No “We have a case” no “I need patches” no “It was the third sister, not the next door neighbor.”  It was disconcerting.  And to be honest, a little depressing…
Of course, that’s when it all broke apart.
“Shhh… you don’t want to draw attention to yourself, do you?“  John was well aware that while Sarah was visible to any passers-by, he was not, and took great delight in the knowledge.
“For the time being, you ARE an invalid, Sherlock.  Please don’t be angry when I’m just helping.  We’ll get you inside, settle you in bed and”
“Sherlock, I can move…”  He didn’t get to finish.
“King’s Head. Trying to get on w/new waitress.”
“John, that was amazing.  You’ve made a beautiful thing, I can’t even imagine how you must be feeling right now.”
John laughed and looked wary.
“Sherlock?  Are you alright?”
Sherlock's mouth continued to move up and down slowly.  Deliberate motions, lips dragging against the skin of John's cock in agonizingly drawn out fashion.  His hands, relatively idle up until now, twitched of their own accord.  There were more ways to touch, obviously.  One of his hands moved, and as it drew close to John, the motions of his mouth slowed and grew shallower.  His fingertips met the skin of John's cock and he lightly touched him, beginning to move in tandem with his mouth.  Now the backs of his fingers, nails softly along in arcs that met up with the downward motion of his mouth.
Greg shook his head.  “None that I recall, but who knows what connections he made.”
Sherlock released his mouth, allowing John's slick and softening cock to fall back onto his abdomen.  He paused, looking at it as it rested there, as if studying or memorizing its details.  His hand reached to it. His fingers touched it, not so much appraisingly as inquisitively. Then softer, strokes that just barely touched the skin.  Up, then back down, every inch falling subject to his touch.  Hand turning over now, backs of his fingers taking the place of his fingertips to repeat the same explorations.  John squirmed a bit, still sensitive.
At the question, the lump groaned. “It means Mummy’s throwing a party. Open the other invite.”
Sherlock pushed his strong thigh insistently in between John’s legs, bringing their rapidly-swelling cocks into contact with each other.  Both men groaned at the sensation.
“Drink your tea.  I made yours fairly weak.”  Sherlock pressed John’s mug into his hands.  It felt warm, familiar.  John closed his eyes as he raised it to his lips.  He relaxed as he sipped.
“TXT: SHERLOCK- CAN U COME BY CHURCH ASAP? SONG’S HERE, WANT U 2 LIS’N.  MOLLY”
John chuckled and put his mouth back on her.  He ran his tongue gently over her entrance and she gasped.  He smiled and did it again, and again… each time brushing her clit with his thumb.
“Great.  See you in 45- gotta shower. Had sick-up @ clinic.”
He drew himself up and looked in the mirror.  He was Captain John Watson, M.D. dammit.  And he could do this.
“He left Detective Inspector Lestrade at about 6, as was mentioned.  He traveled straight home, but stayed for only a few minutes before leaving again in the same cab and heading toward the Vauxhall Arches.  My… capabilities in that area are limited, but we questioned the cabbie who confirmed the location.  This was about 7:30 Friday evening.  That was the last we saw Sherlock.”
He went to sit in the last chair of the last row, but felt a hand at his elbow.  “You are NOT leaving me to sit up there alone,”  Sherlock whispered, as he steered John to the front of the room.  “Mummy insists I sit up there, since I’m the musician in the family.”  John found himself in the front row, sitting between Sherlock and an ancient relative introduced as “Auntie Vera.”  “LOVELY TO MEET YOU!” she boomed, obviously deaf as a post.  “IT’S BEEN TOO LONG SINCE SHERLOCK BROUGHT ANYONE SPECIAL HOME.”  John tried to explain that they were just friends, but was cut short by Mummy’s arrival.
And then there was the hurt of being left out of a case, the praise for Rhys, the complete shut out.
He turned off the overhead light and turned on the bedside lamp as he began to loosen his tie.  Opening the wardrobe, he caught a glimpse of himself in the mirror within.  Damn.  He did look good.  He grinned and silently thanked Mycroft.
John just smiled and walked into the kitchen.  “I was thinking Thai tonight?”
“Thank you for shopping at Regular Chemist, did you find everything you needed?”
Molly pursed her lips, just a micro-expression, but Sherlock read it anyway.  “Well, it doesn’t matter if I do or not, it’s the song that I want to use.”
*********************************
With a glance at the cellist drooling on the furniture, and a glance in his teacup, John shook his head and shuffled back to the bathroom to get ready for work.  Seems he wasn’t the only one Sherlock talked to in absentia.  He didn’t know if that was funny or not.
Bloody great idiot.  Now look what you’ve done.  You’ve gone and had a snit and injured yourself more.  God the pain.  Why does this HURT so much more than it has in the past?  Why does everything hurt.
Knows everybody's disapproval
John took Sherlock’s hand and they walked into the bathroom.  Sherlock turned on the taps and started a bath, added bubbles.
“Under normal circumstances, I’d wholeheartedly agree.  But right now you can’t stand unaided, and you can’t sit in a tub for fear of submerging your incision.  Your choices are have me help you, or wallow in your own stench.  I cannot believe I’m saying this, but my vote is for less stench.”
John thought for a moment.  He couldn’t remember the last time he’d spoken face to face with another person besides his therapist or a customer.  He shrugged.
John grabbed two bottles of beer and popped the tops.
Mycroft slipped out of the room and Sherlock slipped back into unconsciousness.
He moved his eyeball gently, and saw a glass of water and some paracetamol on the bedside table.  He should really thank Greg for that.  He sat up very carefully, and reached for the glass.  It was cold.  The water in the glass was nearly ice cold.
Stunned disbelief, that’s what was showing on Sherlock’s face.  Did John really think he was ordinary?  Of all the people Sherlock knew, John was nearly the least ordinary.  There was Mycroft, of course, but Sherlock would never let him know that.  There was Moriarty, there was John.  Interesting.
“Mike, I don’t know what song says all that.  At first, I thought ‘I Will Always Love You’ but Sherlock just rolled his eyes.  Then I suggested ‘Love of My Life’ by Queen.  He thought for a moment, then said ‘Nope.’  I started to say, ‘Hey Jude’ and he cut me off!  Said if I couldn’t come up with anything intelligent to say I should just keep my mouth shut and learn sign language.  I don’t think a song’s been written that says what Sherlock wants it to say.”
John walked to the door, but was stopped by an elderly gentleman in a butler’s uniform.  “And you are….?”  John blinked.  “John Watson, why?”  “My apologies sir, but no one is permitted entry without an invitation.”  John looked around quickly, mentally cursing himself for leaving his invite at home, stabbed to the mantle with Sherlock’s.
John nodded again, having already slipped his pistol out of the back of his jeans.  He still hadn’t spoken a word, his mouth tight and his eyes hard.
“No, I’m none of those things, but mostly, I’m not HIM.”  Sarah shook her head.  “Go on.  Keep in touch and let me know you’re ok.  This discussion isn’t finished, but we can’t continue it now.”
By lunchtime, not only were they starving, but the weather had cleared.  John acknowledged that they couldn’t REALLY spend the ENTIRE time in bed, and they went out to explore the island.  Lunch at a pub, then playing along the shoreline.  Sarah found some shells and John watched the boats.
He picked up his breakfast and walked into the parlor, and there was Sherlock.  Holding the pictures, the envelope and the note.
Before the thug could react, John flipped his pistol around, gripped it by the barrel and backhanded him across the face, then leaned in close and grabbed the man’s shirtfront.
“Water.”
John sighed and shook his head.  This entire family was overwhelming and he was suddenly very, very tired.  He hung his new suit up, put on his nightclothes and crawled into the soft nest of the bed.
“Mr. Sherlock Holmes. The honour of your presence is required…” John blinked again. “Why am I requested, and you’re required?”
*****************************************
Offer me that deathless death
So Sherlock looked, and deduced.
“You’re hardly the leg breaker type, Mycroft. What’s in this for you besides my abject and public humiliation?”
John sat quietly as the ambulance raced through London’s streets.  He held Sherlock’s hand and listened to the medical team list what was wrong.  His blood roared in his ears and he wished he hadn’t taken it so easy on the thug at the taxidermy shop.
John giggled.  "That's not what people usually say."
Sherlock spoke.  “John, I am, to borrow a phrase, pants at this sort of thing.  I had proto-relationships in the past, not even really worthy of being called relationships, and they all ended quickly.  I hate to say it, but it took my brother’s meddling to make me understand what I have here, with you.  It’s all the things my past… encounters were missing.  Caring, comfort, friendship, acceptance.  I don’t know if I can change how I am to make it easier, but I’m willing to try.”
