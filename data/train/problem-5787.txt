“Ugh, you’re no fun!  Fine, you wanna know why I sprayed you?”
“That’s fine.  I’ll just get out of your hair… maybe we can talk about all of this again, when you’re rested…” Steve countered.  “I’ll come back later, okay, Tony?”
As he moved about her work space, Tony tried to gage her reaction, but the mature-looking woman was swiftly scribbling in a notepad on her desk without glancing up, eyeglasses perched on the top of her head.
He could hear it coming from somewhere in the distance.
He calmly sniffed the fragrance coming from the whiskey and instantly knew which one was in the glass without even taking a sip.
A/N:  So, my dear readers...
Both men’s mouths watered at the sight before them.
“Nope… not all… I’m good…” The billionaire replied quickly.  “Great, honestly… you should be a masseur…”

Of course, he wasn’t oblivious; he was a pretty astute guy.  No signs of senility at all.
“It’s only for Peter,” Steve replied back, before looking at his husband.  “It’s your choice to do this, Tony; he’s ‘your’ son…”
“Because, knothead, you can’t take what you want out here in public. I won’t allow you to.  We need to go back to my place or yours for the fun & games.”
“He’s going to live! The both of you need to stop making him a dead body!”
His heart!  It stopped!  He was dying… he was dead!
The omega chuckled, “Oh, you are a sass master, Steven Rogers. Where did that come from?”
“‘My compromised state’?!  What is this:  1900s?!” The engineering genius stated shocked by that statement.  “Hap, we don’t even know if it’s a heat yet! So, chill out, or I am taking away your security clearance and letting the Capsicle & Katniss use you as a plaything!”
Did Steve know, or was he just as oblivious about it?
He was not in the mood.
“I know, Brucey Bear! I heard you the first time!  But, how… how can I be mates with Steve?  I’m an Alpha!  I can’t be mated to another Alpha; I just can’t!”
He had this strange tingly feeling running up and down his arm.
“Wow, that’s a connection to Steve as well…” Natasha quipped.  “I’m pretty sure that Peggy was one of the loves of his life…”
“Tony?” He wondered once more, as he stepped closer to where the other man was laying down.
Soon after, he set it down on the island, “This would taste so much better with some Tito’s™ in it or maybe even some Jose with a shot of grenadine and a cherry…”
“Wait, you’ve never had a scent-mate before?”
“Well, I think your father & I are gonna have to put the kibosh on one of those…”
… Steve did everything and Tony just watched in amazement.
“Ugh, I knew there was a ‘
“Fine.  All I want is just an extra hour or two of sleep.  I think I’ve earned it. I’m ahead in my schoolwork. My chores are almost always done to your standards.”
He immediately saw the name on the caller ID and answered the call, “Hey, Nat.”
“Awww, come on, Dad… I love being Spiderman, and you know it!”
“Wow! That’s all?”
Happy reading and enjoy!
“Because he’s right over there…”
Neither man wanted to start a conversation that would start an argument.
“How responsible of him more like, Tony…” Natasha quipped.
The three other adults turned to him and stated in unison, “No…”
Had me a case of the yee ol' writer's block, and nothing seemed to fix it... until now!
“Only jokin’, Tones… you know I love ya, but Peter is just like you, when it comes to sleeping and getting up early.”
He sighed with an angry huff, needing to get the tension out of his body.
“Exactly, and this would technically be our first real ‘date’, if you will…”
“I’m flattered, Mr. Stark,” Rogers responded with a soft chuckle and a grin.  “Truly…”
"I don't have a cookie," Peter argued.
Tony shrugged, looking down at their sleeping son.
"Daddy's being silly, Pete. Like always," Steve shook his head. "We're all excited!"
Peter pulled his hand up to his face, cupping his cheek and wincing at the immediate pain he felt. He had avoided contact with it for the past hour, and in less than a second he brought all of the ache back once again.
Steve gasped, observing how Doom lurched toward Tony and quickly waved his hands at him as a distraction whilst Tony got himself sorted. “Hey, big guy! Over here!”
“It’s… Huge.”
“You going to make Tony pay you back somehow?”
“I’ll be your eyes, don’t worry.” Steve reassured him, bending his knees slightly into a crouch so he could move when the shadow finally revealed itself.
Steve laughed a little. “How much longer is this going to take?” He asked, opening his eyes from time to time to stare at the surface of the machine he was enclosed in, the black screen with the red light moving up and down with a loud hum.
Tony ducked out of the way, his boots lit up on cue as he flew to one side to dodge the attack, JARVIS wheeled himself toward the desk and Steve decided to help Tony out by distracting the thing in the floating chair that went by the name MODOK.
Tony smiled back, wanting to tug Steve into a small hug. He did feel emotional after that, he may have been half robot because of his limbs but his heart and brain were still human. He was just an augmented human, one of the world’s first cyborgs. He resisted the embrace though, instead flashing a gentle smile and gesturing to the new and improved car. “Come on Rogers, let’s take you back.”
Steve could feel a drop of rain from his wet hair slide down his temple as he crouched down by the entrance, continuing to maintain some sort of stealth whilst he carried on searching for Tony. He was sure that the man was at least headed to the factory, so he had hoped that the conflict hadn’t taken him too far away.
“I’m fine! We need to get to that—“ The drone plane was launching, smoke was brimming from the thrusters and it began to shake much more violently, the roar of the propulsion systems being a deafening sound, particularly if you were strapped to the it.
It was now or never.
“I wouldn’t.” Norman cut him off, pressing down on a miniscule remote, whilst his hand rested in his ornately lined pockets.
Steve sighed with relief, feeling the stress and worry of getting a strict telling off melt off his shoulders. “Okay, let’s go to this lab then, I’ll push the car.”
This is what society had become during the time he was out cold, and already, it broke his heart.
“We apologise, ma’am, rest assured—“
Steve grit his teeth and tried to turn to his side, grabbing Tony’s boot only for a repulsor to be directed right at him.
The one person that tried to help me and I pushed him away because I was so damn afraid that I would do the same thing that I must have done to drive the others away. I didn’t want to love anyone like I’d loved in the past so I would argue; I would taunt and tease until he yelled. I would get some masochistic bliss out of him shouting at me, even though I know he hated to shout. I would get emotions out of him, confessions that no one else would ever achieve. He saw my demons and he ensured that they remained in the darkest corners where they belonged, even when I would fall for their lures over and over, he, as the knight he was, would protect me and save me from them. The hero of my childhood dreams had become part of the world that I lived in and he was risking it all to protect me. Needless to say I was so very scared of hurting him, so much so that I coated my heart in barbed wire around him, but somehow his words had a way of weaving past all the wires and making me feel so much better. All up until that day…
Tony’s eyes widened with a snap, his mouth opening in pure shock, “Why are you saying this?” He asked in a slightly more aggressive tone. He hated when his father was brought up in any conversation, and it did indeed take him off guard.
Tony could feel the life draining from his body, the slow seep. He struggled to breathe, every small movement of his chest ached. His reactor still fizzled, after all, the reactor was just a few fractions away from his heart. If it were a straight hit, he knew he would be dead by now, bled straight to death. But he was kept alive, the reactor however was in terrible condition. Being shattered meant that it was running on limited power, and with that, Tony could barely move at all.
“I have the food!” He shouted.
“Tony, you
He shook his head. It couldn’t be. Tony had a range of headquarters located everywhere; California, Jersey, even Coney Island.
Tony wanted to touch everything, he needed to touch everything. He couldn’t help but swallow down a huge gulp of pure anticipation, pushing up his chest to show his eagerness, his leg resuming a steady rub up the inseam of Steve’s black trousers. Another shudder is felt from the Captain before his large hands run their way along Tony’s sides, and Tony relaxes in their beautifully secure grip.
Steve snapped out of his daze, still seeing speckles of white light before his attention turned to the plane, latching onto it alongside Bucky who followed Steve’s movements.
“Apparently not.”
The embrace was tender and heartfelt, and for once in a long time Tony had genuinely felt safe.
Peter’s large white eyes narrowed and he aimed the next shot for Tony’s mouth, but the man tilted his head to one side and felt the sticky webbing spread over his cheek. A disgusting feeling that made him cringe.
“Steve?” Tony made a cautious tread closer to the glass, realising that Reed must’ve left the two way function activated. “Steve, how are you?” That was a stupid question and Tony cursed himself for asking it.
He tugged down the report that had managed to get itself stuck on his face and instantly his eyes darted to the man that had
Eventually he reached Tony’s room, taking a gander at the bottom of the door and noticing the lights were out. So Tony was probably down in his lab, which meant Steve would be able to investigate and check the systems to see if the mechanic had chosen to change the rota for whatever reason.
“Too much?” Tony asked.
Steve’s hand carried on, fondling the bulge that was slowly unveiled as Tony’s undersuit slipped lower and lower, letting the Captain touch his raw skin.
The dark laugh echoed throughout the halls, getting louder and louder the closer they walked toward the throne, where the dark figure sat. At first the both of them had thought it was another statue that the cat had jumped off, but upon closer inspection the statue moved, it was the source of the laughter.
“Shit…” He cursed. “That son of a bitch, it was him, it was him all along! He did this to me!” He glared at his augmented hand then glanced at Steve. “He did that to you… He… He did that to you!” Rage began to fill his tone, his hand quivered and teeth began to grind against one another.
With a swift blow, he thrust his arm through Tony’s chest, hitting the centre of the reactor as it lit up as bright as it could. Tony’s mouth opened and he gasped.
Don’t save me now, I beg you. Let me do this; let me suffer for my sins. I should’ve died, not you, it was never worth it… It wasn’t worth it.
Tony’s eyes widened suddenly, just a second ago he was mocking Steve and his ideas, well, not mocking, more disagreeing and now he was being held in a close embrace. After his nightmares he needed it, but he was curious as to what the circumstances were for the sudden display of affection, not that he was complaining; Steve’s chest was so warm, his breathing was soft as was the material of his shirt.
Tony grit his teeth and shook his head, he could feel his eyes tearing up, he could feel the blood surge through his veins as the last sound of Captain America’s voice echoed through his memories. His body trembled and made his armour clatter, he couldn’t handle it. He couldn’t bear to think that he was gone. Countless times he’d run the scenario over in his mind and every time had the same conclusion. He kept trying to reassure himself that he’d be okay, but to think that his rudder was gone made his heart stop. He kicked the dirt with frustration and then placed his dirty hand over his face, leaning on a tree for support.
This was the one chance he had, and Tony Stark seized that chance like the opportunist he was. His arm rose, then and he slammed his armour coated hands through the mirror, circling around the surprised super-soldier and yanking him through. Shards scratched at his flesh, but Tony didn’t rest until he had successfully pulled him through.
Tony laughed lightly, lifted his faceplate and inhaled deeply after the dust had settled and lay down on the bed, hearing a crunch. His eyebrows furrowed and he slowly turned his head to see a skull beside him, his eyes shooting wide open and pushing himself off the bed and stumbling to the ground.
“And you need to believe me, you know even super soldiers need to sleep, maybe not as often as normal people do but-”
Tony was easy to open up to, and Steve was a relatively guarded person so that was extremely difficult for him in the first place, but with him everything came naturally. Steve couldn’t help but laugh whenever he made a terrible joke, or whenever something exciting happened. While other cops would get annoyed with Tony, Steve would just laugh it off and help him out, after all that, in his head, was what partners were for – to help and support one another.
Tony combed his fingertips through his long grown hair as he watched everyone gawk at the screens. He shook his head and continued onward trying to comprehend what exactly he’d seen. Technology wasn’t meant to be cosmetic, and he’d spent a long part of his life trying to distinguish himself from machines. Uploading his consciousness was the first mistake, when his armour had turned sentient and the last resort was Extremis. After that he could communicate with technology, he had become one with his machine, he was Iron Man – even after the countless times that he said he wasn’t.
Who said heroes couldn’t fall in love and live in perfect harmony?
Steve nodded understandingly, wanting to explore this new lab but he had to hold himself back from tinkering with anything, especially since almost everything in that lab looked so delicate. His leg shifted, but just as he was about to move he felt something brush against it, so he peered down to see a metallic dog staring back up at him.
“Well we’ve assigned some in the past, just a few, he’s not been here for long and we’ve gone through about six guys, you’re lucky number seven.”
“How does it feel..?”
Purple Man loomed over Tony, grabbing his hair that poked out of what was left of his helmet and using that as means to raise him, staring deep into his eyes.
“We can’t risk pulling over, Steve, what if she arrests us? We’ve got to go and get Reed! Y’know the guy has a family, he’s got kids—His wife is going to kill me when she finds out…”
“Carol and Jessica…? Where are they, what happened?” Steve asked, shutting his eyes when a flash of a memory coursed through his brain, a strange overwhelming feeling befell him, as though he saw them as targets. Especially Carol, with her eyes gleaming with red. He pulled away from Tony and let out a yell of frustration; the man before him backed off quickly and looked up, wondering if he’d touched something he shouldn’t have.
“Well, this isn’t the 1940s, soldier. And, we can’t just ‘use our words’ to defeat a problem anymore.”
“Whoa, wait a minute here! Don’t I have a say in this?” Tony cut in.
“Damn Manhattan traffic! Wish we lived in Brooklyn instead…”
“Sure…”
… staring at one another with admiration over a well-poured scotch.
’, before letting his son speak again.
“Thank you, Dr. Cho,” Steve stated, stepping up and shaking the surgeon’s hand lightly.  “For everything... sincerely...”
“Ugh, why did you just say that?  Now, I feel even worse for this, Steve!”
“Saved by the A.I.,” Tony muttered lightly, before responding, “Hold that thought, J. Steve, Alpha… do I need to hose you down, so we can leave the hospital?”
“See, she’s get it,” the teen remarked.  “And, she’s four.  Thanks, LilyPad.”
“Seriously?  ‘Now’ you’re suddenly not nervous around people?!  Who-the-hell-are-you right now?”
“But…?” Tony inquired, waiting for something negative to come from the Captain.
“Who?”
“Hallelujah! I don’t want you sleeping anywhere else but in my tower in my penthouse in my bed.”
“Wait, what?  Say that again…”
-- C.E.C.
Pots & pans, food and odds & ends…
“Like how slow are we talking about, Cap? Like torpid? Lethargic? Tortoiselike?”
“We got some good kids over there, Rogers.” The billionaire spoke first.
“I will try my best, Captain.”
He had this strange tingly feeling running up and down his arm.
And, like that, he was gone.
“You’re telling me that.”
“Funny, Scrooge McDuck… very funny…”
“Just check with my office, like always…”
“The day, I know, but he still has strong feelings for him. Never got over him…”
As they continued on, the tell-tale signs of heat crept back in.A slow trickle of warm slick made its way out of Tony, scenting the space as it absorbed into his boxer-briefs and skin.  As soon as the gentle musk permeated Steve’s olfactory system, he rumbled in excitement. His inner Alpha wolf’s hackles were up and ready to pounce.
“So sweet smelling, my omega…”
But, it was Steve.
“I’m going to stay here and watched over Sam,” Nat stated to the group.  “Anyone who wants to stay with me, we can take shifts.”
He couldn’t think of those things; he had to think of the here-and-now, and he had to keep hope alive that Tony would wake up soon.
A phony look of shock came over Tony’s visage suddenly.
Tony made his way out of bed and walked towards the sofa.  His fingers lightly danced through Steve’s soft golden hair.  Those simple touches made the Captain’s whole body tingle, causing him to slowly come out of his slumber.
“No idea, sir…” The A.I. responded truthfully.  “Are you feeling alright, sir?  I’m not detecting any illnesses…”
He held the glass out towards Tony and smiled, “Thought you could use a drink…”
“If you wanna call me, sure, I guess…”
“Fine, but if I die, I’ve left you nothing in my will.”
“I – I can’t, Red…” He answered back.  “I can’t go back out there…”
“Good, because it’s almost done…”
“The Duke, eh?” Tony asked lightly.
Tony pulled his son into a tight embrace, kissing the side of his forehead, before ruffling his deep brown curls.  He pushed him towards the kitchen, where a stack of buttery flapjacks lay on a plate, still steaming.  They had just been freshly made by Bucky.
The brunette cleared his throat loudly, before replying, “You wanna go swimming? I’m feeling a bit warm, and I don’t quite want to shower right now. I need to be outside.  Yeah, I’m gonna go outside.  I’m gonna go outside to the pool right now.”
When they found themselves around one another several months later, things were still awkward for Tony.  At least there were people around to distract him from his thoughts and intentions.
His Omega!
“Well, apparently, his ‘up early tomorrow’ has a double meaning…”
Tony heard the words that came out of her mouth, but somehow he couldn’t comprehend the idea of another person confirming his role in true mating.
Well, hello there!
Go often awry,
“Hey, Nat…” he replied quietly.  “Pepper, how are things?”
“In fact no… I woke up myself…”
“I’m a connoisseur of variety, Captain,” Tony responded back.  “Have to try them all to figure out which one I like best…”
“Hey, kid,” Bucky spoke up, placing a fresh glass from the cupboard in front of his nephew.  “Your dad just spoke to ya.  You gonna answer him?”
Okay, two things:
His dark brown hair was still slightly flattened from sleep…
Wait!
A sudden warmth…
It was NOT Steve’s fault…
Anthony Edward Stark…
Each of the Avengers had their own space to live there on their own, as they did in the Tower.  Steve, Tony and the kids stayed on the base with Natasha, Bucky, Sam, Bruce, Stephen, Rhodey, Wanda and Vision.  Clint stayed on his farm with his wife & kids in Georgia, not far from Happy & Pepper, who were isolating their cabin. T’Challa stayed in Wakanda with his family & kingdom. Thor stayed on New Asgard with Sef, among others, and the Guardians gang traveled off Earth until the pandemic ended.
“Genius, billionaire, playboy philanthropist…”
by Walt Whitman.
“I’m happy that you realize that now, Mr. Stark…” a new voice piped up, causing the billionaire to turn around in that person’s direction.  “One step closer to finding a solution to your underlining issues…”
His inner wolf trembled.  His whole body tingled.  And, a loud growl emitted from his mouth.
“And, all of those options will be fine…”
“Ms. Potts…”
I'm on a roll (and I don't want to jinx it!)
“A wee bit stalkerish, wouldn’t you say, sir?”
“Tony…?” Steve questioned again.  “Tony, can you hear me?”
(See the end of the chapter for
The First Avenger strode over to him and shook his hand firmly, allowing Tony to feel how strong his grip was.  Their eyes were locked on one another.
“Always!” the Captain yelled in return.
The lyrics at the end of the chapter are from "Goin' Out of My Head", a song initially recorded by Little Anthony & the Imperials in 1964, written by Teddy Randazzo and Bobby Weinstein.
Tony had just walked into the space wearing a deep charcoal gray three-piece suit, when F.R.I.D.A.Y. promptly announced, “Boss, Peter has decided not to wake up when prompted.”
“Nat, let’s head back to the party… we need to be better hosts…”
“I will remember that…”
A/N:  Hi, all!
The memories rattled around in Tony’s brain like they had happened only minutes before.
The heat scents that Tony was giving off were so enticing and entrancing that Steve couldn’t handle himself, even though he told the billionaire previously that he would behave.
“Ugh, what-the-hell…” The billionaire groaned tiredly.  “J, why-the-hell am I awake?”
He had to be dead! This was the end!
“I hope for the same.”
“You’re welcome, Tony. Always…”
“Steve, they can’t do anything else,” Pepper stated gently.  “It all depends on Tony now…”
Did he hate Steve?  No, he couldn’t.
Tony rolled the rolodex of memories in his brain back to their earlier conversation and discovered that Steve was exactly right.
The team decided to wait as much time as it took for the hospital staff to get Sam comfortable in his room.  They needed to make sure their friend and new teammate was safe.
And, just like that, Tony darted into the kitchen, where Natasha was still milling about.  She quickly notices her friend’s anxious & nervous demeanor.
“Speaking of Stark, is there something going on between you and him?”
-- C.E.C.
“I know that, Honey Bear, but right now is not the time.  F.R.I., commence ‘Woke-Up Protocol’…”
Contemplating everything that went on earlier, he didn’t notice that someone was standing in his doorway watching him.  The person’s scent, however, swiftly traveled through the space.
“That I do remember, but what happened after that to get me wet, is where I’m confused.”
“Tony, don’t be an ass! What did you do to Steve?”
“I’m not hurting you, am I?” Steve wondered lightly.
Upon hearing the spoken word, the Captain began to laugh.
“Likewise, Tony…”
“I’m in my forties, Steve.  It’s not true.  It can’t be--”
Finally, Steve found his way over to Tony, who looked uneasy (even as he sipped from his highball of single malt scotch).
“That’s all you heard outta that whole spiel, Captain?”
Steve had left him.
“I think you can call him ‘Steve’ now that you’re calling me ‘Tony’…”
Tony quickly scurried towards the sliding glass door leading to the pool, removing clothes as he went.  He was standing at the edge of the pool naked as the day he was born, looking over his shoulder to see if Steve had come after him.
After that, it was a debrief, a cool down and a ‘debrief’ of a different sort.
“He looks so peaceful…” Natasha said quietly, moving to take her friend’s hand in hers.  “I should’ve been there with them.  I could’ve done something.”
It was weird.
“I do will.  So, after all that has happened, you still wanna, you know, try this ‘you-and-me’ jazz out?”
“Hell, if I know.  I’m the messed-up one here; you’re the therapist. Shouldn’t you know and tell me how to fix it?”
“Wow, you really did anticipate me going running, didn’t you, J my boy?”
He knew this would not end well.
Or so, he hoped…
The two of them turned to the dining table, where three other children were sitting and eating their breakfast.
’?” Steve inquired seriously.
“Slowly…”
“And, I respect that; I love Peggers to bits too…”
Happy reading & enjoy!
“Well, she is friends with Captain Rogers, and good friends do things together, sir.”
He had heard of this phenomenon before; however, he never knew of anyone actually experiencing this sensation.  It was called, ‘A/O Impression’…
“Are you gonna start a fight again, Steve?”
He needed to wake up to find where it was coming from, but he was too tired to do so.  He again fell back into a deep slumber, deaf to the world around him.
“Tony, come on…” Steve piped up, worried about where this conversation was going to go.  “Don’t do this…”
“Nope.” Peter replied emphasizing the ending sound as he filled the tumbler with the citrusy liquid.
“Hey, yourself…” the Captain responded back.  “Dr. Banner…”
Bruce stormed out of the room and to his own floor.
“Uhh, no thanks…” Steve responded, taking a seat on one of the kitchen island stools.
Hi, all!
(See the end of the chapter for
“Same about you…”
-- C.E.C.
But, there it was, out in the open:
“You’re not even human! Leave me alone!” He grumbled rolling over in bed, pulling the covers over his head.
Every time Pepper asked him to go down to the cafeteria to eat, he would say he’s not hungry or not ready to eat yet.
’ are not old, just aged really well.”
“He’s running, sir… with Sam Wilson and Ms. Romanov.”
As they continued to eat breakfast and chat, the Avengers team wasn’t expecting the tornado of terror to come.
“He’s waking up…” Tony whispered. “He’s waking up! Doctors, get here right now, he’s waking up!” He had never felt so excited in his entire life. The last time he had been this elated was when he had built his ballistic missile.
.  As much as Tony wanted to question him and ask him how he did that he could feel the rumble in his stomach intensify. Bypassing the interrogation Tony stepped up beside Steve, and tilted his head, trying to speak but only a mishmash of groans escaping his oesophagus. Steve seemed to understand him though, dipping his already hunched posture down and grabbing something from under the broken ribs of the corpse. With a powerful tug he yanked it out – arteries that were attached to it spilling crimson splatters all over the floor. Carefully Steve cupped what he held in his hands and held it out to Tony, tilting his head in response. The living-dead-engineers eyes fell to what Steve held; a heart, he was offering him the heart of his kill. He didn’t know why he found that sweet, endearing and even romantic. The quick corruption of the virus (fuelled by Steve’s super solider serum and Tony’s which acted as a catalyst, hence the quick infection) had warped Tony’s brain during his brief time being ‘dead’. Tony reached for it, grabbing the still warm organ in his own hands and then sinking his teeth into it. It was juicy, like biting into a fresh strawberry, strewn with flavours that he had never tasted before, possibly the best meal he had ever had. Tony ate the heart with considerable care, with Steve staring at him the entire time. He was said to have had minimal brain function, to give in to hunger, but Tony now knew first hand that there was more of a thought pattern and one other remaining emotion asides from the need to eat and constant hunger and emptiness – love. Tony made a chuffing noise when he had finished, with Steve stepping up to him and growling face to face, but it was a strange growl, a happy growl if that were even possible.
Tony laughed.
"They're mood socks," Peter explained. "See, that one we're grumpy. That one we're happy. That one we're sleepy. And that one we're goofy."
"Touche,"
"I'm walking away now," Steve groaned.
Tony turned to get a closer look at the woman, grinning at the fact that it was his own son who made her wear a costume after years and years of simply putting cat ears on while wearing her usual office attire. This year Pepper Potts was a witch. The hat, the dress, the nails - the full Witch.
"Ears! Ears!" Peter squealed, turning to his family. "C'mon we gotta get our ears!"
"Pete, you're gonna be away for four days," Steve sighed. "You don't want to forget anything,"
"Merry Christmas Peter,"
Peter turned slightly, pursing his lips together. His jaw was throbbing.
as their kid? I don't think so. Our kid just won't stop,"
It was a question that any parent would dread to answer. They couldn't guarantee to Peter that they would survive everything the world threw at them. As much as they told the little boy they would always come home, that they would always fight to get back to him, they knew it wasn't realistic. But if they put all of their focus into that, life would be unbearable.
And there was no feeling like watching their son fall asleep with a smile on his face.
"But they don't
"They're driving, remember?" Pepper sighed, her heart breaking at the sight of the boy filled with concern. "Dad's suit got pretty banged up,"
Steve reached for a kiss, his lips trailing along Tony’s lips, dancing over his patches of facial hair and crinkling his nose at the tickle of it.
“It’s nothing, don’t worry, come on. Let me show you mine and Cap’s floor.”
Fury looked just about ready to smack the man in the face. “You’re lucky Stark, you say anythin’ else funny and I’ll smack that goatee right off your face. Capiche?”
“Steve!” He called, but there was no response.
The Persian cat that followed Doom around jumped onto Reed’s lap and hissed, using his arm as a scratching post.
Every Avenger had their own floor built for them, their own living space for them to come back to after a long, exhausting mission.
“Hey now pal, I think you’ve had enough but how does your stomach feel?” Tony asked.
“It still pisses me off that Stark refuses to work with SHIELD, well, sooner or later… Once he gets a grip on his own company, that’s pretty much sinking right now. I heard Obadiah Stane is the one that’s taking charge now…” Fury chuckled with vindication, through and through. “…It’s only a matter of time.”
Steve was trying to catch his breath after realising that running with his new pair of legs wasn’t as easy as it had looked, despite the ‘training’ he’d had with Tony whilst getting to the mansion. He turned around to see Tony holding something that appeared crumpled in his hand, and decided to take a gander. As he looked closer he saw the words ‘Captain America’ written all over it. He smiled softly and tugged Tony into his arms, hugging him tightly.
Lifting Steve into his arms he ducked further into the darkness of the alley, trying to avoid the main streets, but immediately reached a dead end. Knowing that he didn’t have enough power for his thrusters, he was left with no other choice but to go into the main streets that he once wandered.
“I’ll come with you,” Steve added readily.
Once more, Tony set his jets off and hovered up toward Cap, staying behind him and trying to direct.
Then it was Tony’s time to shine as he jumped over Steve’s shoulders, aiming his repulsor to the centre of the machine, and then firing with a forceful beam.
“Yeah… That’s my old man.” Tony drawled and nodded, his hand rubbing at the tip of his goatee, though hating that he would forever be in his father’s shadow, even in the eyes of his hero. “He spent a long time looking for you.”
“Thank you, director…”
“Good as new!” Tony tilted his hat, just so that the little fringe he had could poke out from underneath. “Sometimes you just need a little elbow grease huh?”
“Yeah? Tony? Is everything okay?” he asked with concern.
It was obvious to Tony that Steve was going to keep poking at this until he was given answers. Instead of telling him right away, Tony sighed deeply and shrugged, trying to play innocent. “I have no idea what you’re talking about.”
Tony gave Steve a look of worry, before receiving that nod that had such an unspoken confidence to it.
Suddenly the sigh of relief didn’t seem very relieving. His dark cobalt eyes darted up to Nick, his face set into a harsh frown.
“Day one. You wouldn’t believe what I found today… Get ready for it. Captain America. The actual, Captain America…!”
“Go go Stark jetpack!” This was something he wasn’t too keen on using, because the instant he said it he felt the armor from his legs spread up to his back, panels locking into place which took their time. Each fold in his armor locked into a 1 centimetre thick panel, but panel upon panel added more depth to the metal sheath over his body. Each clipped into place, two trapezoid shaped panels pushing their way further out and lighting up with blue as they’d form jets. When these jets lit they tore through the cloth of his neat trench coat that he valued ever so much, but it was the quickest way to get from point A to point B. With the back-jets formed they lit along with his feet, using his hand repulsors to balance himself as he flew quickly toward the fallen bot to absorb its power pack and regain the energy that he’d lost.
“Begin power up,” he ordered his armour as he held up his palms, the attachable repulsor raising itself and locking in place on his new appendage smugly. The lights began to glow and gather energy. The main problem was that even with this armour Tony couldn’t go rushing into battle, despite how much he wanted to, especially with his leg giving him so much of problem.
Steve’s other hand slipped around the man’s thin waist, pulling him closer as he lightly gripped on the lower, toned back muscle. Tony found his head tilting back, and Steve sat up, kissing Tony’s Adams apple and nuzzling it with the tip of his nose.
It looked as though a bomb had gone off; there were boxes everywhere and members of the team were scattered around the room. Tony’s eyes instantly darted toward Luke who was carrying a giant tree. And by giant, he meant huge in that the peak of the tree was scraping against his ornate ceiling and scratching some of the detailing that Tony remembered doing himself.
Tony’s brow arched, “Umbrella?”
“So you work with the police now?”  Steve clarified.
“So why the hell are we still here?”
“Team? Avengers? Anyone?!”
“C-cap…”
“So just continue what we’ve been doing all this time?” Tony confirmed.
“I wouldn’t lie, especially when you know what this is. If I die, the memories go, just… Like… that.” He snapped his fingers, each pause making Tony’s heart skip a beat as the man neared the switch he held in his palm.
There was fire in his eyes; a deep passion to protect that gave him the strength to push harder. It was as though he could see every small movement and twitch of Doom’s eyes, he could hear him snarling under the mask, all whilst Tony dismantled the bot for its power source and began to drain it, as quickly as he could, unravelling wires from the inside of his jacket and plugging them into the battery.
Beams of sunshine broke past the tall canopy of buildings; light broke through the shadow as though it were a sign of what was to come. In the distance Tony could clearly see the tall structure that he was heading toward, looming over the city, casting its shadow.
“Yeah, you heard Cap, let’s do this team. Assemble!”
“Oh, it’s a formula one of my interns helped me with, his name is Peter Parker, certainly a bright tool!”
“We’re going to have to take this thing down by force,” Jessica groaned, climbing up the ladder with such practiced ease, reaching the top in a matter of seconds. Luckily the fire escape closest to her provided a better vantage point.
Then it was Tony and Steve’s turn, with Tony using his makeshift repulsor and blasting any few drones that were missed. Steve decided to take a leaf out of all of the kickboxing training he’d done in the past, and use the strength and force of his newly acquired metal legs while he chose to throw a number of kicks at the bots, whipping out his shield that they’d retrieved from the mansion ruins, and spinning it out to decapitate the bots that flew his way angrily.
The storm above was relentless, pounding drops on the ground like large needles, panging and dispersing with each strike. Even as Captain America knelt down, the rain bombarded him, it’s droplets think and frequent. It obscured his vision, but nothing was preventing him from pummelling his opponent. Taskmaster wasn’t the easiest of opponents, by far, especially with his ability to mimic Cap’s every move.
“You’re not wrong. At first I was on the fence about taking you under my wing, Tony.” Steve admitted. “But each time you’ve proven me wrong, and I appreciate that. You’ve shown me how capable you are and how much this job means to you. We’ve shared experiences and to me that’s the best part of it all, sharing this with you.”
Steve would open the door, smile at the book and take it to his desk to sit down and read, and he would read when he couldn’t sleep, then he’d go down to Tony’s lab and discuss it with him. After all, Tony was as much of an insomniac as he was. The post-traumatic stress had resulted in the inability to sleep, but Steve was lucky that was all it was.
A while later Steve was sat down staring at his knuckles, grazing his thumb over each one that had made impact with the wall until he was distracted by a steady creek. Toward the door one of Tony’s many bots reeled in, this one with a conveyer-belt under its wheels, making a tiny squeaking noise as it wheeled itself to the centre of the room. Steve kept his eyes fixed on it until it reached up, chaining up a punching bag and then beeping over at Steve. The Captain took that as a cue to scramble to his feet and hastily stepped to the bot that dispensed a sketchbook from its small orange compartment, along with a pen before scooting out of the room again. Steve’s eyes turned to the window as he mouthed a ‘thank you’ to Tony, grabbing the pen and paper from the floor and quickly sitting down. If he had nothing better to do the only cure for his restlessness would be to draw the pain away. He held no grudge against Tony but the conditions were making him more and more anxious, the sterile surroundings providing as a reminder that he was indeed encased in a medical facility, but the small touches of the outside being brought to him were enough to calm him temporarily.
Whoa, wait!
The sweet smell of cinnamon & brown sugar with a touch of metal slowly began to permeate his apartment as soon as he got his floor.
The philanthropist looked deeply at the other man and sighed, “I’ll wait, but not forever.”
“You didn’t?”
Sorry its been so long without an update, but between work, pandemic panic and writers block, I didn't know where to go with this story.
“I do my best, sir…”
“So, if some random alpha were to attack you…”
“Oh, honey, I can do that 24-7-365. No need to ask. Can I still talk?”
(And, who doesn't love the Rev's soul? I mean, honestly...)
“Tony…” Steve moaned, before allowing himself a breather and moving onto the omega’s ear.  He growled possessively as he sucked on the lobe.
“Come here often?”
“No, it’s actually true, котенок… I woke up to a tingly sensation…”
“Oh, this? I don’t want this anymore… I need a new drink. I’m gonna go get a drink.  Excuse me. I’ll be right back…”
It was faint, but he could hear it:  “Tony…”
“See what I mean?  You don’t get it!”
It was weird.
“Do as you wish.”
The billionaire sighed, as he took the steaming hot mug of coffee handed to him by Steve.  After he took a short sip, he sighed again.
Steve stood in stunned silence.
“You may have found, and don’t kill me for saying this, but I think you may have found your True Mate…”
A sweet scent entered Steve’s nose as he & Tony exited Sam’s room.
“Wiff ‘asta?” Tony questioned mouth full of food.  He finished his bite and answered, “Always go with pinot grigio.”
Thank you again for reading!
“Four minutes, I think…”
He knew it had to be from someone nearby…
She thought it was a fluke, like her eyes were playing tricks with her. But, as she concentrated more on his hand, she saw it again.
’… I saw what I saw!”
Tony’s voice suddenly pulled him from his Omega-induced trance.  The philanthropist was standing outside of the elevator now.
“What?”
“Oh, no, big boy. I am so ‘not’ in heat.  More like I’m in menopause, in heat-cessation…”
I am so so so so so so so so so so so so... sorry that I haven't update this story in more than a year!  (Because as we all know that this past year has been craziness with the pandemic and my motivation level for writing {which I love} was extremely low).
“What I mean is that I should be protecting you!”
I have so many restarts on this chapter, but I have this version is up to snuff!  The story is going where I want it to go, but nothing  is ever too easy to create.
A few seconds later, a familiar face peered around the edge of the doorframe.  He saw Steve, still sketching in his notebook, while reclining on top of a premade queen-sized bed. The naughty ideas of what he could do with a bed like that dancing around in his mind.  He knew that he shouldn’t go back to diving into a close relationship with Steve, while said relationship caused his near death from drowning mere months beforehand.
“Tony…”
But, here I am -- back at it and getting my writing motivation slowly back in gear! This is going to be a short chapter, but its a precursor to some smutty goodness in the chapter after this
“I was beginning to wonder the latter…” A familiar voice spoke up from behind them.
“Hello, Tony…” He spoke softly, shaking the billionaire’s hand.  “Nice to see you again...”
As she left, she gripped Tony’s hand one last time, trying to reassure him that he’d be alright.
“I have no idea. Why do you ask?”
“Alpha…” The visionary stated breathlessly, before clearing his throat.  “I mean, Captain…”
Steve let go of Tony’s hands and got up from his place on the bed, walking towards the door.
“Do as you wish…”
“Coming where?” Steve asked, slightly confused by the question.
Unexpectedly, he felt a wave of sadness hit him, changing his scent from a newly-washed tee-shirt freshly dried from the clothesline on a warm, spring day to a sweaty days-old pair of gym socks, sitting in a gym bag in the trunk of a car on a hot, summer afternoon. Tony took a deep breath needing to know his Alpha’s scent during this time, just in case something like this happened again.
“He’s one of the best.” Steve responded in return, finding a seat next to him.
Would Tony really pull that on him?
All of them ending with their own versions of success.
And, while he was doing this, he began to take Steve’s scent.
“That’s not a lie…” Tony muttered under his breath.
But, still, there was no spoken reply.
“Steve, have you seen Tony?” She replied, trying to hold back her emotions.
Steve had told everyone that he wouldn’t be leaving Tony’s side.
“Tony, you’re not an Alpha…” Natasha quipped lightly.  “As long as I’ve known you, you’ve never been an Alpha.”
“So, I came over at the wrong time, didn’t I?” the philanthropist quipped with a coy wink & smile.
Steve and Tony weren’t sure what to expect, when they arrived at the hospital that evening, but from the looks on their companions’ faces, things were not as they seemed.
“And, how exactly are we going to do that?”
“Why? You’re not going to eat?”
Eyes flickering open, he turned slowly towards the source of the pleasurable perfume, seeing that he was napping on the bedroom’s dark brown, hand-tufted leather sofa.
But, Steve was the reason, the catalyst, to all of this
“Why would you think Tony would hurt Steve?”
Soon after, it was to debrief and cool down with a highball of scotch or a cup of coffee for him and a soda or bottled water for Steve.
Natasha, Clint, Bruce, Pepper and Thor were sitting around with him chatting, when Steve arrived.  Wearing his trademark brown leather bomber jacket; a fitted long-sleeved navy & olive green-plaid sport shirt that was cut for his body; olive-colored trousers that shaped the roundness of his ass; and, toughened-up & laced-up brown boots (which he wore often while riding his motorcycle), he was pure Alpha and proud of it. He strode over to the group with a soft smile and a wave to all.
Could he stand losing the billionaire for the rest of his life?
And the beat's so loud, deep inside
“You’re not funny… stop now.”
“Well, we were eating our sandwiches and you kinda moaned when you took a bite…”
’ is an understatement!”
“I hope you don’t think this is creepy, but I was watching you sleep… and, I wanted to make sure no one came near you.”
“Tony, thank you, but I think it would be better if I just leave now… no offenses taken.”
A handsome man was complementing him…
“Clint… how’s your golf game?”
“Jarvis knows…” Tony mentioned.  “He knows where everyone in our group is; it’s safer that way.”
“I think the idea of you swinging around at all is dangerous,” Steve spoke.  “But, if you are under adult supervision, and said adult limits your swing time to only one hour…”
Before he could say anymore, Tony felt a slow flow of slick rush out of his nether regions.  This made Steve growl and move into the billionaire’s space.  He nuzzled the side of the older man’s neck, causing a bristly shudder to go through his body and release more of his natural lubricant.
He turned his head towards Tony and moved his free hand to the billionaire’s cheek stroking it tenderly, before capturing his lips in light pecks. Soft moans emanated from their bodies as their interaction deepened.  Steve drew the brunette’s top lip into his mouth, before entering his mouth, tasting him and savoring him with his tongue.  Tony let go of the arm he was holding, allowing Steve to move it around to pull him even closer.
A faint beeping sound…
“Tony tried to drown himself…” the Captain responded, continuing to do CPR.  “I thought it would come back up from underneath the water, but he didn’t…”
“Or, you wish you did…”
“Nick maybe. I know that Bruce and Thor do for sure.”
“Right away, sir…”
A recognizable voice…
Hope you like where this story is going!
“Come on, Steve… don’t razz me about this. I’m trying. Okay?  You gotta give me something for that…”
He was reading to Tony, when Natasha and Pepper arrived for their morning visit.
The oldest Stark-Rogers boy griped under his breath and moved to the refrigerator, grabbing out the carafe of fresh orange juice that was sitting just inside.
?  Why are you thinking like that? You should be thinking ‘
“Just the way Steve described you two, I naturally assumed you were an item.”
-- C.E.C.
“But nothing. I trust you.”
He never thought he would ever have to say or think those words.
“Ummm… Steve?” Tony muttered nervously.  “What’s wrong with you?  Something going on?”
“Now, why should I do that, Omega?  You’re not enjoying this?”
It was a familiar scent that prickled his nose first, awaking him from his slumber.
“That is correct, sir…” Tony answered, pacing the med room.  “Am I dying?”
“Everything! You’re too old!”
“Fine. Okay. I’m an Omega. There you go… that’s all.”
Tony sprayed the cold water at Steve, but it didn’t detour him from his pursuit.
“God, Doc!  What do you want me to say?  That I’m unhappy? No, I’m not. That there are problems between Cap and I?  At the moment, there aren’t, if you don’t count the mundane.  Come on, you know me somewhat… you know my M.O. with significant others…”
“I think you’re seeing things, Natasha…” Pepper retorted, shaking her head in disbelief. “It hasn’t moved at all.”
“I dunno, Tony… should we be doing this? You & me, right now?  Especially when there’s someone out there trying to kill our whole team?”
Everyone on the base had a routine planned out, which included frequent handwashing, sanitizing of any & all equipment being used, temperature checks (as needed), and schedules for any off-base work.
“Tony? Are you okay?” She questioned slowly and calmly.
“Tony…”
“Ugh, I don’t wanna!” He whined loudly.  “I was perfectly fine & dandy sleeping in my comfy, warm, snugly soft, king-sized bed!  J, why are you being so evil?”
“You mean, Peggy?”
“Just keep making us feel lazy!” Sam hollered back.
As he stepped closer to the billionaire, he got a nose full of the omega’s essence and growled in his ear, “Omega…”
“Seriously, so you’re an alpha virgin?”
“You don’t know that, Tony…” Nat interjected softly.  “They could be friends…”
He just smiled at him, and that was it: Tony Stark was intrigued by the American hero, Captain Steve Rogers.
"Policy of Truth" is a song by English electronic band Depeche Mode, released in May 1990 off of their album. 'Violator'.
-- C.E.C.
“That I needed to get a new drink…”
“Neither did Nick.”  Tony added.
“No, keep on it. What’s he up to now?”
“Jarvis!” the Captain shouted.  “Tony isn’t breathing!  Call 911!  I need an ambulance!”
“Thank you, sir.”
Pillow under his head and blanket over his body, the Captain looked so peaceful and content.
The billionaire playboy looked at the war hero and took the drink in his hand without saying a word, letting the moment sink into his psyche.
“Shocking!”
(See the end of the chapter for
He knew the tone, the cadence, the matter-of-factness; he just couldn’t put a finger on which it belonged to exactly.  He needed to open his eyes to see the person’s face; to open his mouth to say something… anything; to release his body from its current confines to move and touch said person; to open his heart to –-

“I’ll hold you to that, man…”
“Mind if I have one?”
And, as he did, the billionaire dove into the deep end of the pool, surfacing soon after.
“You can talk dirty all you want to, Steve, but the results gonna be the same:  no.”
Stay tuned! -- C.E.C. :)
“Tony’s finger… it moved…”
“Oh, Steve, don’t look at me like that,” the billionaire piped up calmly, putting his hands on either side of the Captain’s face.  “I wouldn’t use it on you. I promise.”
“Ouch!” Peter moaned, rubbing his body all over.  “F.R.I.! I was getting up! Did they have to initiate the ‘Woke-Up Protocol’?!”
“I’m sorry I can’t stay longer…” Steve stated with a soft tone.
Tony found his way to his master bedroom and made his way over to his king-size bed. Slipping his hoodie, sneakers and socks off, he crawled back under the covers, snuggling deeply into the 1000-count Pima cotton sheets.  He rolled onto his side, back facing the door, and front facing the big windows that were currently covered by huge blackout curtains.
They’d be together, bonded for life.
“Very nice of you to do so.  You know, I don’t always drink whiskey.”
“Yeah, and I liked that…”
The billionaire pulled a small plastic bottle of orange juice out of fridge.  He unscrewed the cap and took a drink of it.
“Sam introduce you to him?”
It was the twitch of his pinky that was caught in the Black Widow’s periphery initially.
“You heard Dr. Banner, just as plainly as I did!  He said that we are mates. Mates, Tony! I am your Alpha!”
“Come on, Tony!”  Steve shouted, doing chest compressions, being safe not to mess with the arc reactor.  “Come on!”
“Smooth… very smooth…” was all the hero muttered, before turning back to the bottles and choosing one.
“Alright, fine,” Tony professed, annoyed by his alleged friends.  “You wanna throw out trade secrets so flippantly, Dr. Banner? You wanna throw out my personal business?!  Well, I got a good one for you…”
“So, he’s available?”
Happy reading & enjoy!
… for Barnes…
“How bland of him…”
“Tony?” Steve questioned with cautious concern.  “Are you alright?”
He needed to go back to the land of the living; he needed to get back fast.
All he could think about was that night.
“How can you be a memory, when you aren’t a part of my past? Plus, I have you here right now.”
Gratefully, Sam would bring him his meals, or the hospital dietary services staff would take pity on their favorite Avenger, Captain America, and make him either a plate of food every meal or a large tray of finger foods (i.e. celery sticks with peanut butter; boxes of raisins; small bowls of grape tomatoes and snow pea pods; butter crackers with hummus, among other healthy things).
“You weren’t faster enough to awaken, young sir, so yes they did!  Now, get up! Get dressed and make your way down to breakfast, before they have to initiate another protocol!”
The voice that spoke came from a little girl, eating pieces of a syrupy buttermilk pancake.  With light brown curls, big blue eyes and a bright smile, she was a perfect amalgamation of both Tony & Steve.
Steve gazed over the billionaire on the other side of the elevator, who was looking down at his feet the entire time.
That’s when he heard a voice say his name.
The feeling of euphoria raced through Tony’s body.
He still couldn’t believe Steve’s attitude toward this entire situation.
“Dr. Cho, good to see you,” The billionaire spoke up softly.  “How’s our boy?”
“I’ll join you, Nat,” Clint commented.  “Just say when and where…”
The thrill of knowing that Steve didn’t leave him made him smile.  He stretched his body out with a soft groan, bones popping and creaking in the process.  All he wanted to do was continue to lay I bed, but he knew that he needed to get up and make things happen.  First of all, go to Bruce’s floor and apologize to him for outing his ‘crush’ on Natasha.  Second, apologize to Natasha. Third, apologize to Steve and hear him out about the whole mating thing.
“He’s just mad, Auntie Nat,” a small voice garbled.
As Steve took a bite of their creation, a soft growl came out of him.  The sound sent a shiver down Tony’s spine and a bit of slick wet his derriere.  Tony knew Steve could smell his spillage, but he continued to eat near him.  The faint scent of Omega slick wafted towards Steve’s nose, as he chewed on his latest bit of sandwich.  He swiftly finished the piece in his mouth, before sniffing the air again deeply.
As soon as they arrived at the Compound, the entire space was put on lockdown.
Every time Clint asked him to take some time and go home to shower, he politely declined.
Before Tony could answer, a familiar British voice broke his train of thought:  “Sir, I detect an elevation of your heart rate and of your temperature. Do I need to initiate the ‘Heat is On’ protocol?”
“You ‘had a feeling’?!  Why didn’t anyone tell me about this?!”
Before the usually quick-to-quip Stark could speak, Nat spoke for him, “Naw, he’s more of a scotch man.  I’m gonna go see what Bruce is up to.  You two have fun…”
This made him relax enough to finally admit what happened:  “I slicked, when you moaned earlier, and you ah, smelt me, so it made you come after me. I had to spray you down with water and myself with whiskey to ah, keep you at-bay…”
The other three Stark-Rogers children had made their appearances, dressed and ready for their day and were busily eating at the dining table, when their older brother finally arrived.
“He’s drinking in a bar in Brooklyn with a gentleman by the name of Sam Wilson, sir.  Air Force officer, currently employed by the local V.A. as a grief counselor and therapy support liaison.”
Steve smiled at him again, as he worked the cork out of the bottle with a corkscrew without fail.  He made his way back to the table, bottle and two empty wineglasses in hand, setting one down in front of Tony.  He poured the billionaire some, before pouring some for himself and sitting down to eat.
“You slicked for me?”
“Did you honestly have to scent the elevator earlier?”  Steve questioned back.
“Don’t act like what, Steve?!” the philanthropist reacted sharply.  “You weren’t the one who just got outted down there! So, I’m fucking allowed to act as ridiculous as I wanna be! I think I’m entitled to it, and if you don’t like it, you can leave now!”
30 minutes later, Jarvis announced that Bruce and Natasha were on their way up to Tony’s floor.  Soon after, the elevator doors popped open and two familiar faces emerged from the cab.
“I know, Pop, but I just need to get out for a little bit and swing around.  It helps calm me down.”
“Ugh, you are so annoying!”
’.  So, there he was:
With an eye-roll from Steve at the bad ‘Gremlins’ joke from Tony, the two made their way to the elevator, headed down to the ground floor below them.
“Maybe I’ll make it be 30 minutes instead for the whining and complaining…”
When the first reports of coronavirus in New York came out, the Stark-Rogers family wasn’t sure what was to come next.
“Obviously you did… I’m irresistible.”
So, I have heard such good things about chapter one, so why not post chapter two?
“Interesting.  Hey, Natasha?”
...what could be going on with our dear playboy genius billionaire philanthropist omega?
“No problem, sir.”
“I wasn’t implying anything, Tony… honestly.”
And with that, Steve checked the pasta. When it finished, he poured in heavy cream and cracked open two eggs, beating them in a small bowl, before adding them in as well.  He grabbed a pair of tongs and tossed everything together, before letting it cook again for three minutes more.  When that time was up, he added in grated parmesan and pecorino Romano cheese, along with the cooked bacon from earlier, tossing it yet again and letting it cook for another minute.  After that was done, he piled a bunch of the finished carbonara on a plate and seasoned it with some fresh parsley from his spice garden and a quick grind of black pepper, before setting it and the Caprese salad in front of his dinner guest.
Tony smiled at the younger older man and quipped, “Sit there and look pretty…”
“Bruce please, Captain…” the scientist responded back.  “Nice to see you again…”
“That looks beautiful…” Tony stated lightly, practically drooling over the food before.  “May I?”
“Good idea…” the blonde rumbled against his love’s breeding spot.  “Lead the way, but not too fast…”
“I know! I am freaking out right now, Romanov! What-the-hell do I do?!”
“I can’t. It’s the only thing keeping me alive right now…”
It wasn’t everyday that genuine attraction came up to Tony and smacked him in the face, setting his ‘heart’ a-flutter and sending his wits out the window.
“Don’t make me use it…” the billionaire stated promptly, aiming at the other man.
“No clue…” the archer answered.  “Stark?”
“See… no need to worry, Tony… he’s not there to score with Sharon or Sam…”
“‘We’?  We already moving in together, babe?”
“Whoa, Doc, don’t alliterate yourself… it’s bad for your health...”
He could hear it coming from somewhere in the distance.
“Steve & I will go to the VA first and talk to Sam’s coworkers, then to S.H.I.E.L.D. to see what baddies they have their radars.” Tony announced, just a sharp tingle raced down his back.  He shook out his upper body, as if an ice cube was put down his shirt.
All he needed now was a kiss… a first kiss… to set everything over the top.
“I second that…” Natasha muttered to Steve under her breath, but loud enough for Tony to hear, before leaving the room herself and heading elsewhere.
Tony blushed, as Steve turned back to making other things while the pasta cooked. The two continued to talk as the Army officer pulled tomatoes and a ball of fresh mozzarella out of his fridge.  He made his way over the window sill and pulled fresh basil leaves from the spice garden box Natasha got him a year & a half ago as a housewarming present. He cut the tomatoes and mozzarella into slices, alternating them on two plates. He made sure to put freshly-washed basil leaves between each layer, before drizzling extra-virgin olive oil over all of it.  He left the seasoning to personal taste.
“My oldest son… hope you’re not upset by that…”
“And so, it’s me, Nat! Me, the person he wants he wants to make small talk with!  I don’t small talk well!  I am Mr. Anti-Small Talk, and you know this.”
“Ha ha ha, Dad… You’re so funny.” Peter’s sarcastic response wasn’t lost on anyone.  “But, I can’t clean my bedroom now…”
“Gotcha…” Steve replied, grabbing the bottle and shutting the door behind him.  “Figured I would give you the option.”
“Tony, don’t ‘
“Fine…” the woman retorted.  “But, he’s going to find out. He’s very nosey…”
“He is such a cockblock…” Tony stated, kissing around Steve’s mouth.
“Sir, it appears that Sam Wilson also has a female with him, and they are quite attached at the hip, as they say…”  Jarvis informed them.  “Her name is Sharon Carter… she is the niece of one Peggy Carter, a colleague of your father’s, I do believe…”
“Oh, come on, Tony…”  Natasha piped up, frustrated by her friend’s actions.  “Don’t be a stalker. Did J wake you up to let us know we were here?”
“Cap?”
“He’s gone, Steve…” The assassin replied solemnly, as the super-soldier embraced her.  “Fury’s dead.”
“No thanks,” the teen answered back flippantly.  “I’ll just drink my juice.”
“Tony, don’t do this…” Bruce responded nervously.  “Please don’t do this…”
“Yes, sir, at 5:07 in the morning.  I have also taken the liberty of pulling several bottles of water and Gatorade™, as well as some bananas and protein bars.”
he thought.
So, I am sitting here at my computer, before I head to bed, editing, formatting, posting, etc., to give you a new chapter, which you totes deserve from my mischievous brain!
“Natasha! Tell me what’s going on!”
“That’s just… weird…”
“You’re a good boy, Jarvis, my son… you’re making Daddy very proud.”
Tony sniffs in air loudly and replies (quoting ‘Top Gun’), “‘I don't know. I'll tell you tomorrow, but it’s looking pretty good so far…’”
“What don’t we get, Bug?” Steve questioned honestly.
And, that’s when he saw it:
“Sure…”
“You got it, my Alpha.  Uh, J, have Happy bring the car around and have him be ready to initiate the ‘Sleeper Hold’ protocol, if & when needed.”
When it was stated a week before St. Patrick’s Day that schools were closing, Tony and Steve made the executive decision to pull the kids out of school and move everyone up to the Avengers Compound, instead of staying in the Tower.  Both men knew that one way or another the virus would find its way into their children’s schools, which were known places where diseases and sicknesses have made appearances and always travel around the population until they have ran their course.
That soft bouquet of clean, fresh cotton and warm cherry pie enticed his senses all over again, sending a jolt of arousal down his body.
Steve thought to himself.
But the only person in close proximity was Tony.
“Hey, Steve…” Natasha spoke up first.
Lips, oh how he had wished he had touched them with his own, so pink and plump.
“Oh, sweet Steve, you’ll see if you get too frisky in the car.”
“Too true, Cap… too true.  Think we should go, before we have a full-blown heat incident up in herre?”
“And, I am… just trust me on this…”
“I’m fine…” He grumbled, moving her hand away from his face.
She hung up on them abruptly, causing both men to look seriously at one another.
“But, you just said that…”
“I thought you didn’t want one here right here, right now in public?” The Captain countered with an undertone of wit.
Did he resent Steve?  A better question:  why would or should he?
At noon, the good Dr. Banner and the sassy assassin escaped back down to their respective floors, leaving Steve and Tony alone yet again.  The two men moved swiftly around the kitchen, making lunch for one another.
“Mr. Stark, does this affirmation have anything to do with the change of status between you and Mr. Rogers?” She questioned nonchalantly, looking up at him.  “Do you think that may be helping in your progress?”
“Whoa, Doc, we’re in the first stages of whatever-the-heck this is…” He emphasized with his hands.  “I’m just playing it by ear… I’m hard to get as well, so I got that for me…”
He would work in his lab, while Steve did public appearances as Captain America; both had their own individual missions and those together for S.H.I.E.L.D.
“There’s always someone else.”
“You make me tired, Rogers…” Tony stated, yawning loudly.  “Honestly, I’m at the point where I just want to take a nap...”
“Young Sir, I don’t think I am able to do that. Your fathers have given me special instructions to wake you and your siblings promptly at 8:10am to allow you time to get yourselves ready to come to the kitchen.”
“Shakespeare Garden and moving briskly, sir…”
“I decided to come see what all the hype was about with running the Park, like any other warm-blooded, normal human being would…”
“I’m trying… I may hyperventilate before this night is over…”
Steve had left him injured in Siberia.
I don't know what to say about this chapter, because I had the 2nd half written one way, but then I reread it and hated it!  So, this is my 2nd try. (Don't hate me plz!)
Hello, all!
“Who else would have known that about him?”  The assassin questioned.  “I mean, other than us?”
“He’s at a bar in Brooklyn, sir…”
“Shut it, Platypus!”
Happy reading & enjoy! -- C.E.C. :)
“Yeah, whatever.  J, keep an eye on him. If he gets into trouble, I want to know about it ASAP…”
“He’ll consider the polite gesture, Tony. He’s old school. I’m surprised he didn’t get you a drink first or hasn’t come in here to wonder where you went…”
The trip up to Tony’s floor in the Tower was done in utter silence.
He managed to talk after he’d recovered from the hard pat and caught the breath back that was knocked out of him. “Transferred from Brooklyn ma’am. But this feels like I’m straight out of the academy, if I’m honest.”  Steve had worked in the NYPD back in Brooklyn but that was nothing compared to working in the main city, in the heart of the USA.  There was far more pressure, which he was ready to carry on his shoulders.
He had remembered a small exhort from Reeds research, a possible theory; super soldier serum could have been the catalyst, and Tony remembered that Extremis’ basis was… The super soldier serum.
His arm raised again, this time smacking Steve right across the jaw. It was within that moment that Steve could’ve sworn when he glanced up that he had managed to see the entirety of colour in Tony’s face suddenly drain.
The only way to assert his authority over someone as powerful was to stand his ground.
And then he snapped out of it and pushed back, raising his shield and hitting one of the armours hands back, skittering back a little before jumping to his feet and leaping up as high as he could, throwing all of his weight into a powerful dropkick to the helmet of the suit that fell to the ground with a heavy thud.
“You gotta have connections. But the time for submitting was over, it was like an amnesty when this thing with the bombs and the chips first started.”
“It can’t have been him…” Jessica said to herself. “Call it a sixth sense; I may not love him but he’s a klutz.”
Steve jumped off a rooftop, grabbing onto a suspended flag pole and swinging his body around it a few times before using the momentum to throw himself onto the steel bridge that was just past the tall rusted iron black gates surrounding the factory. Steve almost slipped when his foot finally hit the bridge after the leap of faith, the metal covered in slick raindrops made him skid, forcing his body to tilt back and grab the handle of the bridge – which again, was slippery. It took a couple more movements before he managed to stop slipping around, being far more tentative with each proceeding step. He was grateful that Tony insisted that his boots have something much more effective than snow grips, even in this weather, and Jan, of course, added a very fashionable twist to Steve’s traditional red boots, giving them a retro-feel flare.
Steve’s head was hazy, with flashes of memory gradually returning to him, but he returned the tight grip, keeping Tony as secure as he could, but his body continued to involuntarily spasm from the bad circuitry.
“I told you, I’ve touched your wings, I witnessed it…” Steve replied sadly, rubbing his hand down Tony’s well-built arm slowly. Steve’s wings fanned out again before wrapping around Tony too, and it was then that the billionaire felt a strange warmth surge through his body. These strange rays of light were wrapping around him, which wasn’t physically possible for a start, and they were making him feel at ease, relaxed, they were soothing him.
Tony nodded in agreement. “That’s what I saw, but that’s impossible.”
Just as Doom stood to his feet he quickly noticed Tony powering up a blast from his armoured red and gold gauntlet, the ray of cyan bouncing off the holographic shield and straight at Doom, who was once again sent back. This time he wasn’t happy about it and as he stood he roared, sending multiple blasts out from each fingertip.
He couldn’t take this.
going through these check-up procedures after every mission. “—He seemed completely fine, and has been for the last couple days.”
Tony’s phone was finally returned to his pocket after a good while of fiddling around with it. The sound of Steve’s feet scraping against the ground was starting to grate at him already, and he could only imagine how annoying it must have been for Steve. Still guilt ridden, Tony was keen to suggest alternatives to help Steve. “Hey, Steve, you know we can’t walk around in these tatters.”
He knew the one person he could count on—
“You’re not like this Tony, this isn’t part of you!” Steve yelled over his shoulder.
“I’m not, I’m just trying to tell you the truth-” Steve pleaded, watching Tony get to his feet. His eyes once more drifted to the damaged wings that seemed to trail on the floor as he walked.
Tony’s head began to throb with the information. “Okay so let me get this straight. So this is exactly the same as the superhero problem. You know, I was told that all of these superheroes were getting killed in gang killings, getting mobbed and brutally murdered. It wasn’t until recently that I saw it for myself, I saw a friend… Get killed by some over powered, brain dead people. I thought that was because we went out in the open, but what you’re saying about being tracked makes sense. That’s what these chips all have, a tracker. So you’re saying that the government arranges these mobs to kill not only heroes, but villains?”
“Tests, Iron Man…”
What hurt even more was that he was doing this to his friend, that his friend had suffered that much to have to endure this pain. Carol meant a lot to him; after all, they had suffered from the same demon in the past haunting them over and over- alcohol. He hacked at the wire and then changed where it was connected to, but that didn’t stop Carol from flinching in agony.
“Seems like a patch up job, you’re right. It’s too random, there has to be someone behind all of this…” That’s when Tony spotted something that made his expression fall even further, but he didn’t look mad, he had a look of disgust creeping over his lips. His eyebrow twitched in fury.
“It doesn’t make sense, Steve.” He said softly, staring up at him as Steve stepped closer and returned to wrapping his arms around him, now with his wings too covering the both of them.  “I… Always thought you were something else, I mean, heh, no one can be
“Far away?”
He could feel the sudden twitch under his fingertips, and Steve’s hand shifted to hold Tony’s instead, in a tight hold with the smallest of smiles on his face. He could see the pain under that stare, but Steve trying to be positive was a good start – better than he had anticipated.
the Golden Avenger.”
At this rate no one was ever going to move in.
Reed took a deep breath, scared and worried. He hoped with all of his being that Tony would be back soon and that the robots would come to life and help him, but for now they were all down. A floating, squished looking head moved around the room trying to dig through the papers, and keeping the EMP at work, which kept all of the robots down. Hesitantly he met the blues staring back at him, his voice strained and hoarse. “How will this help you?! Victor, we could have been a great team together, we could have helped you if you had the right ethics behind your work. But you want nothing but power, and that’s the reason that you’re struggling now.”
“I’ll love you too, Tony, I’ll always... Always love you.” The golden haired angel replied, holding Tony tightly as he felt the boy drift to a gentle sleep as he held him throughout the night, whispering words of comfort along with butterfly kisses to his jaw and neck.
“Do you promise?”
“The very one. That’s why they were going there... Come on, let’s take this to the chief and prove their innocence!”
“You have a big breakfast there, tough guy?”
“They sure did, frankly, I’m honoured.” He gave him a light hearted laugh to coat how anxious he was feeling again. As he stood his stomach made a loud growl which instantly made Tony pull an expression of sheer astonishment.
“It became more of a memorial ground after there was an explosion there.”
“We all will.” Valkyrie added, punching her palm with her fist.
Two hours into the museum visit and there was an announcement that it was going to close. All Tony had to do was flash a couple of green dollar bills and he managed to get it to stay open for the two to finish their visit, walking around every section, every segment and every story Steve had to tell. Tony could’ve sworn he was enjoying this more than Steve, and he wasn’t usually one to dwell on remnants and reminders of the past, but this was like he was living through Steve’s narrative.
“Killgrave! Get these guys will, ya?”
But was trying really
Their first objective was to get to the main computers. If he went to the control panel he could shut down the security, that’d allow him to get into the main room which was just next to the control room. When looking on the blueprints back in the reception, the main room didn’t reveal much asides from its name, which meant that it was the heart of the entire operation, and secrecy always piqued the attention, given the curious cat that Tony was.
“You have our word, Tony.” Hank murmured with a respectful nod.
Steve was still trying to get over the bruises, yet alone another serum being developed from his own. Probably a more advanced one by assumption, but so long as it was in the right hands, being used for good, he couldn’t lecture Tony… For now.
“So how do you submit to the government?”
“God, you’re beautiful…” Steve blurted out.
“Over…ride systems, OVERIDE!” He yelped, focusing all of his efforts to disable the suit and get into its systems.
They held one another for a long moment, letting every single argument that they had against one another melt away.
Steve looked back at him, a little surprised to be hearing such a positive attitude, but it was taken on board and appreciated too. Perhaps Steve was a little too caught up in playing cops and robbers that maybe he’d lost sight of what mattered, and was happy to be reminded.
Tony almost fell to the ground; instead he dropped to his knees with his hand pressed on his face. Victor was alive, and he’d stolen the schematics that he’d wanted all along – and Reed was gone, clearly kidnapped by the signs of it. Tony had, moments earlier, pieced together that liquid nitrogen would give Doom the chance to freeze Reed and take him, rendering him helpless.
“Upper shelf.” Steve said calmly, placing his mug of coffee down.
Tony’s heart was racing. He knew for well once they entered the streets they would be out in the open, but that was better than being cornered in the alleyway. They knew what they were doing, they knew how to survive in this world and he was just a newcomer, so he had no choice but to follow their lead. Carol dropped him, but allowed him to get to his feet before continuing with the others. He staggered at first, trying to put one foot in front of the other then pick up speed, which was proving difficult with that new leg of his that he had to keep adjusting to.
“Merry Christmas, Tony.”
“Probably in his room polishing his boots.” Tony mumbled. “Why? You’re not going to bring him down here, are you?” Protective didn’t quite cover it, he didn’t want Steve to be made a test subject for no reason, unless the two were completely sure that something was wrong.
Tony snarled under his breath, constantly and forever holding a vendetta against the man who had stolen one of his suits and gave it a paint job – naming it the Iron Patriot. He glanced at his arm only to see an Oscorp brand sticker hidden by the bend of the arm. Instantly Tony tried to scratch it off, only to spot a larger logo on his left heel.
His attention went toward Steve’s hand, reaching his own over it cautiously to feel that twitch, wondering if he was dreaming or not – but Steve’s hand moved. Steve’s fingers gently skimmed over Tony’s, small motions that slowly and carefully laced their fingers together. Quickly, he turned around to see Steve, laying there with his eyes open, blinking to avoid the raindrops that came from above – finally though, the rain was starting to stop – the drops had become lighter and were reduced to a spit.
Tony stopped in his tracks, just in front of the car. “Wait, wait, just a second there, blondie!”
“So what are you going to do now? Roam around free?”
to do more tests. T’challa is right in that we need McCoy here to help us.”
One day Steve walked into Howards workshop, looking around and awaiting the genius that would provide him with a brand new shield, but the man had gone to a meeting and wouldn’t return for a long time. He was told by the butler to sit and wait in the lab, but as always, curiosity got the better of him and he ended up wondering around.
“You know, there was something I’ve always wanted to tell you. Since I’ve worked with the police you’re the only guy that’s been nice to me, you’re the only one that’s listened to me. I know I’m not the best detective in the world. After all, I’m the prototype, but you’ve seen past that. Other cops, well, they’ve been put off by not only me but the reaction that I’ve gotten too. As you can tell, cyborgs like me aren’t taken kindly to. People are afraid of what they don’t know and it takes a long time for people to accept change and evolution. Now I’m not saying that all detectives should be replaced by me but I’m a step forward. You strike me as a traditional guy…”
The dog tilted its head, its large ears flopping either side as it did. “Ah yes, Officer Rogers, Sir’s new partner. I’ve heard ever so much about you.” It spoke, returning to tending to the other bots, nudging them with the tip of his nose to attend to what they were supposed to be doing, tilting its head to Tony as a bot scooted over and began to work on his arms.
It was clear even from Steve’s point of view that JARVIS was having difficulty, so he did what he did best. Steve was famed for his strength, something he hadn’t really displayed since he had started working with the police in New York City, so he ran up to MODOK – since it wasn’t a projectile it wasn’t stopped by the barrier, so he ran through and grabbed MODOK’s chair as best he good; giving JARVIS the perfect opportunity to plug his wire right in.
“Stop!” Tony called from the back, trying to tug at the bot, but it just began to stride forward and grabbed Steve, carrying him over to something that Tony had locked away a long time ago, smashing through the doors and tearing through the locks as though they were sheets of paper.  Tony ran after him, knowing that the bot was going for something that he had long since stopped working on, one of the biggest and deadliest missiles he’d ever made back during the time that Stark Industries was actually a weapons manufacturer. Steve wouldn’t go without a fight, he was kicking and pulling away, but even with his extreme strength he couldn’t quite outmatch the huge suit of armour. Tony had to think quickly, and the only way he could stop the suit was to put on a prototype that he had stored away for emergencies, so he ran as fast as he could to unlock it. In the meantime the huge suit of armour pulled Steve to his feet, only for the super solider to give it a massive kick in the chest, throwing all of his weight into it. The soldier immediately tasted the rancid hint of copper that pooled in his mouth when more blood spilled. The sentient armour staggered back, just for a moment, and Steve took the chance to throw another punch at him. It was hard to fight something that was just a hollow suit of armour, but as he threw the punch his fist was grabbed and yanked back. Steve could feel his shoulder pop and let out a loud grunt while the armour grabbed the chains that had once held the huge doors shut, and wrapped them around Steve. Without even having to type commands in the huge suit managed to activate the countdown. The virus that was inside it was spreading, as it did when he had touched that helper-bot.
Steve felt Tony’s movement to his inseam become far more rigorous than before, noticing the hunger in his half lidded eyes, he craned forward and slipped Tony’s trousers lower and lower. He had to wriggle to get out of them, but he was already doing so, particularly since he was pushing his hips up to meet Steve’s instinctively with a stare that oozed confidence.
His eyes filled with panic as he felt the force of gravity weigh on his suit, descending from the sky as though he were Icarus. Steve was his sun, clearly, and just having made contact with him sent a warmth through his body that couldn’t be expressed through words.
“Yours….” Tony replied, though practically incoherently, biting onto Steve’s skin for some sort of relief. He wanted to leave the same marks that he was sure the man left on him. Though Steve tactically countered by dragging his fingers down Tony’s back, moving to the front to get a grip on his hipbones, his thumbs caressing the distinct V.
“Amazing… No,
“He’s fragile!”
“Guy looks like he’s been roughed up real bad…”
Doom collapsed in a smoking heap of metal. Tony meanwhile, as exhausted as he was from using all of his energy on that last attack, ran up to Steve as quickly as he could, scooping him up gently in his arms, his hands slowly using their cloaking tool and forming back into regular looking hands. His fingers gently traced Steve’s beautifully strong jaw as tears welled up.
“Let me go through.”
“Pretty sure those two finally sorted things out, all the tension seems… Well, it’s dissipated and they look happier.”
Tony had to slide off the bed, regretting the decision almost instantly, the cold hitting him right away. His undersuit crept up his skin and he reached for some of the parts of his suit, sitting back on the bed with the acrylic shard and a couple of tools that he’d found from the first aid box; a scalpel and spoon, even the smallest tools were the most helpful in those sorts of situations. It was time to fix that power regulation problem.
“Guy with a sock for a mask got to the place. We’ve been living in a revamped hydro-plant since, and now I’ve managed to rebuild it all. Now it’s just up to the others to move in once they’ve managed to detach themselves from their current living situation. To be honest I didn’t want to open it all or let anyone stay here just yet, I’ve got a few more finishing touches to add but it’s mostly finished.”
He slowly turned his head to face Steve again, “Steve, remember me. Remember who you are!”
“We’re going toward the robot rampaging the city, we’ll take care of it, you two go and prove your innocence to Fury!”
The question arose out of the blue and was certainly not what Tony expected to hear.
Terms of endearment in that satin voice made Steve eager to continue, grazing his lips at first against Tony, but the billionaire wouldn’t have just that. His arms slithered around Steve’s neck and he pulled him forward, eager to be satisfied. His legs spread and he could feel the way that Steve’s entire body pulsed against his own, particularly down by his hips. The soldier was stiff, and feeling him rut up against him even with that thin barrier of clothing between them sent surges of pleasure up his spine, searching for more.
“I KNEW we were right!” she exclaimed.
The black, fluffy-coated feline nuzzled into the warmth of Steve’s arms, purring loudly with satisfaction when it nestled against his chest. Steve stared, wide-eyed, at the fluff-ball while it vibrated whilst purring, the older woman stepping up to Steve with her lace gloved hands covering her cherry red lipstick coated lips.
Oh, how it’s a glorious sight.
“I like Tony, not you!” He spat.
“You’re not supposed to be in here, sir, the area is off limits.” That ‘sir’ came out with a hint of venom. Maria knew she could do a better job as director, she knew it with every fibre of her being. She wasn’t jealous, no, she was seething that Tony Stark of all people would gain that position over her, not when her loyalty to Fury was clearly without boundaries, so much so that she was there looking over a super soldier that was supposed to remain hidden from the public eye. This was one of Fury’s secrets, and Maria held it close to hear heart that Fury would entrust her with such responsibilities. Tony had never been in her good books, but they had a very weak bond of mutual respect for one another, emphasis on the weak.
The difficult part was working on his hand – since it was his dominant hand, so he didn’t make it the complete gauntlet of his suit – a much more streamlined version with an attachable repulsor. It was amazing what a man could do with a box of scraps.
“Save it, spangles.”
“Wait! What’re you?--?”
“That… Goblin it was to distract us… You… Want Extremis…”
Tony’s world stops. Did he just hear him right? The absolute devotion and conviction of Steve’s words were enough to drown out the sounds of Janet, Billy and Teddy and Sam (did he really hear that last person right?) gasping in the background and flailing amongst themselves as Hank and Reed were eagerly trying to shush them.
“Gone Christmas shopping for the dinner tonight – will be back around 2.”
Steve persisted with his maneuvers, trying his hardest to keep close to reach into the car eventually and stop the driver by force, but all he could do was push it.
His footsteps became more careful, the shift of water beneath his feet making it significantly more difficult to be quiet as he stepped further and further into the factory. The large doors seemed to be the only way in, asides from a few broken windows that were far too small for his large, muscular frame. The main doors it was.
“So what, you’re saying that these supervillains that don’t know each other are just banding together and fighting? This is hardly the Cabal, these are just random villains,” Carol stated, her gloved hand just over her chin, eyes narrowed with a deep perplexed look that seemed to be the resonating theme throughout the rest of the Avengers in the room.
Horror surged through his body. A gut wrenching agony echoed throughout his frame, his teeth chattering, golden brown eyes narrowed only to prevent tears from spilling but that alone was a fruitless effort; the tears began to spill, warm drops trickling down his cheeks. His throat closed and he found his breathing hitched.
“Just a few more Steve, they won’t be long.” Words tumbled from Tony’s lips filled with reluctance.
“You are not going anywhere,” he replied mechanically.
The first mission was the Boomerang. It happened around lunch, when Steve followed the sound of crashing near one of New York’s biggest banks, which was a hotspot for criminals. He was suited, ready for action in his repaired costume that Tony and Janet Van Dyne had a personal hand in remaking and remodelling, though still bared a strong resemblance to his old costume. Now he had Kevlar scales along the blue of his uniform, it was light weight, streamlined materials that made every action that much easier. His repaired shield sat on his back and people stared as the flash of red white and blue streaked past them, leaping over cars to get to his destination far quicker.
“Why didn’t they just kill you?” Tony asked, “When they captured you?”
“You certainly don’t fit in amongst those two,” Tony said with a roll of his eyes, moving closer toward Steve until he was standing right in front of him, arms still held out defensively.
Tony darted toward the computers with Steve covering him, performing a visual sweep of the room as he stood close behind the other man, keeping a hand reassuringly on his armoured shoulder to let him know he was still there.
Tony began to talk as they walked through time, walking from the prehistoric to current day, spending a particularly long amount of time on the moon landing section where Steve just seemed absolutely wonderstruck. Tony had to explain that his own trips to space were rather frequent, but his explanation turned into bragging.
“Why is he getting blamed? This isn’t his fault! Just because he builds robots…” Steve frowned with disgust, hurt by such accusations on behalf of Tony.
Spiderman wasn’t about to leave Tony there, he swung in with the soles of his feet facing Carol and booted her off the fallen knight with a ‘Huzzah.’ All of the commotion didn’t go unnoticed, in the distance of the buildings Tony could see people peering through their windows at the brawl even through the hazy double vision he was experiencing.
The sharp tip of the syringe needle caught the light and just as Steve heard a small buzzing sound and turned around, the needle was planted through the tattered fabric of his blue shirt, into his skin at the base of his spine.  Steve let out a shriek like no other, a high pitched yell fused with a scream as the syringe pushed more liquid into his system. Quickly with cat-like reflexes he spun around on his ball of his heel, swinging his foot around and kicking the bot into the wall until it smashed. But he didn’t leave it there, he walked over to it and kicked it again and again with fury, yelling incoherently at the bot; there were no words, just grunts and growls. Tony while stood on the other side of the glass uncontrollably flinched just by reflex each time his bots were thrown and beaten like that.
“My race? I’m a human, Steve, as are you; as are Peter and Carol and Jessica.”
Steve’s grip tightened on the white straps and he pulled him closer, but not aggressively. “It’s hurting you, isn’t it? Those bruises… All the suit, all those malfunctions… Tony you need to get rid of it. You need to destroy it.”
, Pete. We wouldn't want anyone else. Asthma isn't something that makes you wrong or different," Steve explained. "All it means is you get special medication and sometimes you'll run out of breath a little quicker than normal,"
Peter giggled, shovelling more mysterious buds into his mouth as he ran. This was a fun game. Daddy and papa always starting running when Peter put things in his mouth. Sometimes he had nothing, he just liked to play. But today he had something, Tony was sure of it. And Peter was
"No, he likes my apple juice. So we gotta get both,"
"They're okay, Pete," Happy consoled, giving an assuring nod. "They're on their way home now,"
On their own, Steve and Tony had trouble staying beneath the radar of the ever-hungry media. With the team, it was completely impossible. Even with the restraining orders and lawsuits keeping cameras out of Peter's face, it didn't stop the hassling of the boy's parents and his uncles and aunt.
"We have to be nice to the people who clean this place, buddy. Do you want to leave a mess for them?"
than uncle Bruce. And cuter than any other thing on the entire planet,"
But the fact was that when Tony thought about kids, he thought about trauma. He thought about screwing up, scaring them, being the mirror-image of his own father. He imagined his son would hate him. He imagined coming home smelling like scotch and barely seeing his son, making him feel in the way and unloved. Letting him be raised by a nanny.
Tony smiled, holding the boy out from his chest for Steve to take and strap into his car seat.
Tony took a deep breath, holding his son tight and feeling his warmth. He didn't know how he had survived most of his life without Peter. The little boy was his reason for everything these days.
’.  JARVIS had made him a list of books that came out after he crashed the plane and was frozen in the ice.  All of them classics that he never got to experience before now…
“Why?” Tony questioned aloud.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwHwKvotF24 }.
“Woo…” He spoke up shakily with a laugh.  “That was crazy, huh? You okay, Cap?”
Tony and Steve have heeded that warning once before.
“That’s not what we did back then, Tony, and you know it!  We protected the ones we loved without weapons, who could kill or maim someone!”
“Yeah, I’ll see ya, Sam…” the Captain replied, shaking his friend’s hand.
’, he thought again, letting out a deep breath.  ‘
“Damn it, Steve! Why are you making this so hard for me?”
“That’s what the tingle means, Tony. I did a little research with Nat’s help.  We don’t have the tingle.”
Both Natasha & Tony turned to see Steve standing in the doorway, smirking at them.
Tony kissed the tip of Steve’s nose softly and sweetly, before resting his forehead on the other man’s. He could smell the Army officer’s scent returning slowly to its original heavenly aroma.  “You gonna be okay now? Are we gonna be okay now?”
“I have seen the film, you know…”
“Uh, no reason. Just the way he had heart eyes when he talked about Stark last night, it made me think that there was something else going on…”
“Was it tingling, before I got here?”
The usually suave genius, billionaire, playboy, philanthropist had gone silent; he may have even slicked a little bit.
“Oh, ha ha, Doc.  I see what you did there, and its Captain Rogers. Don’t make the nonagenarian feel older than he already is…”
“Doc, you can call me ‘Tony’; I’m not gonna tattle on you…” the philanthropist responded with a wink.  “And, I think the Captain has helped with my recovery in so many ways…”
So now, I am back!  (And, I'm fudging with the MCU a wee bit. Bear with me!)
Happy reading & enjoy!
I am going to move the story along, so some canon moments will be skipped over.
“Jarvis cares about you, Tony.”
Tony knew immediately what Jarvis was trying to do.
Tony vaguely remembered something Bruce had told him about Omegas: ‘
It was like someone was nudging him awake.  But, when he opened his eyes, no one was there.
“Are you sure, Tony?” The captain wondered aloud.
Steve & Tony even made schedules for each one of their kids, which included during schoolwork, chores, lab time and fun time.

Please let me know what you think of this chapter as per the always!
“Well, enlighten me, Doc, why did I have my pool incident?”
“Fabulous. Now, I am here to enjoy some one-on-one time with you in your domicile that surprisingly doesn’t reek of Alpha.  Why does it not reek of Alpha, Steve?”
Hey, all!
Steve’s other hand slowly made its way around the back of Tony’s neck, feeling the throbbing scent gland located there.
“What-the hell just happened?!” He emitted aloud after a prolonged wait.  “I never have people leave my events early!  His ‘I-Have-To-Be-Up-Early-Tomorrow’ excuse better be pretty damned important!”
“I thought Sam was at the VA tonight.  He has meetings four days a week, all starting at 6:00pm.”
“True… man, should I call him to see if he’s okay?”

“No, that’s people talking.  I want to hear it from you.”
“Captain…” the physicist replied softly.  “Tony, hey… I’m –”
“Whoa, whoa, whoa! What relationship?! We just met the other night!”
“Damnit, Tony!  I had a feeling he would try something like this!”
So, he developed a daily routine to keep himself somewhat sane:
“Sir, I’ve taken the liberty of scanning your attire for athletic wear and found multiple items. Would you like me to pull them for you?” Jarvis piped up.
“And, does that make you an expert?”
“Boss, do I need to initiate one of your protocols?” the bodyguard questioned seriously.
’, Tony thought to himself.  ‘
As soon as Steve had emptied the bronzy liquor into the rock glass and handed it over to Tony, he was enchanted.
“The fact that you found your ‘true mate’, and I haven’t even found mine yet…”
Steve waited for a verbal response from the billionaire, but he got none.
Peter grabbed the warmed dish and took it over to the table, where his youngest sister Lily was still eating.  He giggled with her, helping her cut up the rest of her pancake and feeding him some of his own.
“Or, in our case, ‘date-by-date’ maybe…”
Thank you for reading this and sticking with me! (Or, if you are reading my work for the first time, thank you for joining me on this journey).
“Focus on the finger…”
“Okay, and what would you like me to do?”
“Say what?!”
“Steve, you can call me ‘Pepper’” the Stark Industries CEO stated lightly.  “It’s a pleasure to see you again…”
So sorry this chapter has taken so long to post. I have my reasons.
“Then, who-the-hell are you, Tony… who you are?!”
Tony looked deeply into the blonde’s eyes; they were such a perfect shade of blue that intoxicated his senses.  It distracted him so much that he didn’t notice that Steve’s right hand was moving up his arm and was pulling him closer.
“Yes, finally.  Natasha got me to watch it.”
From the moment Tony first saw Steve Rogers in the flesh, he knew there was something special about him.
Bucky.
With that, Steve softly kissed his engineering genius before him, taking in more of that delicious pre-heat scent.  An elicit moan emanated from inside Tony’s body, causing him to deepen their connection.
