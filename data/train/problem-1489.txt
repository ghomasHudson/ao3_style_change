Bloody hell, this was a stupid idea, he was doubtful it'd work, but was out of ideas. After this, he'd go back into the lobby and try the telephone again. He stood in line with the lens, as far as he could tell and started to jump up and down and wave his arms.  He doubted there was any sound capabilities in the camera, so he didn't bother to shout.   Thirty minutes later, he sat down dejected on the closest bench. He was freezing, having left the flat in a rush, he could not have anticipated this kind of change in the weather.
"Pub down the street, meeting Irene. I'll make it worth your while. Promise." Jim sort of mumbled under his breath. He continued on, Sherlock followed. He had just enough alcohol that his craving for drugs was intensified, that's how it worked. Jim probably knew that. Get him a little drunk and he'd be more suggestible than he was when sober. Sherlock briefly considered backing out, but pressed onward, despite warnings from his guilty conscience.
Lestrade gave me an odd look when I arrived, like he was surprised to see me. I frowned at him. "What?"
John turns over and places his right hand on Sherlock's bare chest and leans his head on his left fist. He looks into Sherlock's eyes and places a gentle kiss on his chest.
Again Sherlock looked in John’s eyes, searching, looking for ? John was not sure what. John looked at Sherlock trying and failing to guess what was going on in his head, when there was a crash in the sitting room, followed by some whooping an hollering, John's flatmates had arrived.
He gently got out of bed and walked to the bath. He turned on the hottest water he could stand to warm away the fatigue in his body.
“Really Mary, I like to have fun just as much as anyone but I’m knackered. I need to get up and get the train for home early tomorrow.” John didn't want to sound like an old man, but he didn't want to miss his train, either.
John was desperate to talk to Sherlock. He thought back to the library-- it felt so long ago--but was just earlier today. Jim Moriarty was at the library today--wasn't he? John
John sat while Sherlock and Lestrade stood, facing each other and had a heated discussion of why Sherlock had kept the piece of shrapnel for an extra 12 hours. Lestrade backed off and quieted down when Sherlock gave compelling information of how a subtle bend in the metal indicated it was from a common kitchen appliance turned into a makeshift incendiary device strong enough to take a building down. Lestrade took the item from Sherlock and sent it along to the bomb squad.
No, I didn't give it back, but I wasn't going to use it, nonetheless. I've taken up smoking again. Lesser of the evils I could choose.
The bus rumbles though the wet London streets, setting him off a few blocks away from his flat. He gets off the bus, stepping in a cold puddle, his sock full of water. Seems about right.
“Yeah, that’s the John Watson I know---so serious about his studies!!” said Ian, the football captain, smiling.
"This is a victory, John. I have the ankle tag off my leg, I can go anywhere!" The owner appeared with the wine bottle.
True to form, I saw her look at my lips as I was speaking, then her eyes were drawn down my neck to the very spot I would have been smart to hide. Too late, the mark on my neck  wasn't large, but it was a stark blue and red against my notably sun starved skin. I should have kept my scarf on, but I never expected to see anyone in the far end of the university library, tucked into a corner against the back wall. I was hiding, after all.
John still felt the need to look again over his shoulder. He was sweating profusely. He looked around quickly--nothing was amiss.
Sherlock is well aware that he scares John. John is scared--Sherlock can see it in his eyes and hear it in his voice. Sherlock alone scares John and Sherlock's drug use scares him more. Sherlock thinks this problem likely originates in John’s past and has something to do with his home life.  His ?sister or maybe his father—someone in the family is likely to have some kind of substance abuse problem, but Sherlock is uncertain who and what kind. Sherlock wonders if John's father is violent. Is that the fear that Sherlock can see behind John’s eyes?
“Testing the waters,” was the response from his flatmate. ”I like to put in a toe before I jump in.”
"Admit it. You should be thankful that I was here to rescue you!"  She walked behind the desk to where Sherlock stood and whispered. "What about that fit lad that follows you around? What would he say if this pretty body of yours was marred? Bet he thinks you're the bees knees." Irene pouted and drew her red fingernail along Sherlock's bicep.
It's very difficult for me to look at John without smiling, Over the years I have practiced looking down at his shoes or mine. I'm very talented at looking off into the horizon, too.
John likes to kiss, I've gathered. He has me on my back now, He's working hard on my clothes. I could help him--sit up, take them off, but he's enjoying himself, what's the rush? His hands are everywhere, strong, firm hands, John has me pinned, I'm underneath him and my shirts off now. I'm  aching to get the rest of my clothes off. He's moving too much, I grab him and pull him close and press our lips together, he slows and breathes into the kiss, tongue searching for mine, his soft lips are open for me. I hold him still and kiss him and play with his mouth, holding his bottom lip between mine. I suck on his bottom lip a little, then let go. He lets out a little groan and whispers my name.
John wasn't afraid to fight, not at all. He'd been in a fair share of fights at home. In his neighborhood in Chelmsford, he had a reputation as someone who would be keen to fight under the right circumstances. He'd given and received a number of black eyes in his day. When he left for Uni, his secondary school had a few good stories about him.
The party had quickly taken a down note and broke up. The flat was empty. The three of them walked carefully down the steps, Mike supported by Sherlock and John on either side.
`````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````
"At the very least," John said brusquely. Unasked, the older lady came to the table, set down a cup of tea in front of Sherlock and scurried away again.
I squinted at my photo  plastered on the front page. Several front pages, actually. There was really no way to tell it was me. It was dark. I was wearing dark clothes, my face turned away from the camera.
Thinking back to last summer, in Amsterdam with Victor, trying my first hashish. We'll see how this compares.
"Leave John out of it." Sherlock tried not to show how nervous he was. He downed his pint, setting the glass down firmly on the bar and reaching into his pocket for his gloves. He turned away from Jim, ready to leave. He needed to just walk away and get back to the flat. New fixative had never sounded so promising.
She took John up the stairs and was surprised to find Sherlock laying on the sofa in a large, adequately furnished flat.  He was shirtless, covered in bright red blood that had spilled down in rivulets from his head to his neck and shoulders. He held a balled up article of clothing to his head and groaned loudly when he saw John in the doorway.
Both boys jumped. Sherlock stepped out into the hallway. “Fine,” he called over his shoulder, walking away.
John initially went for another beer, but forgot why he was there, when he felt Sherlock standing behind him, very close.
“Your face is funny Harriet.” John stared at his dinner plate, trying to feign some interest, but he wasn’t hungry anymore.
I stood at one end of said corridor strategizing just how to navigate my way to the other. The game stopped when they saw me. I heard someone whisper,
John was thankful for the tea and biscuits, remembering he had no supper. He poured a cup for Sherlock but he didn't touch it, seeming to be asleep.  John followed Mrs. Hudson to the door.
… Look at how he jumped to your defense last time we saw each other, right?”  Jim said, rubbing at his jaw, as if to make a point.
John was silent, jaw clenched, while trying to process Mycroft's wise words. John knew Sherlock's brother was right. Mycroft was the one who dealt with Sherlock all these years. John was the interloper here. He looked down at his shoes, unable to think of any words to add.
There was only one reason to be here.  Mike Stamford had something that Sherlock Holmes wanted. Wanted very badly.  The key to the lab at Bart’s Hospital was in Mike Stamford’s pocket. Mike was working there a few hours each week as a lab assistant. Sherlock wanted into that lab to use a special microscope for just
All of  sudden, the older of the two boys is shouting behind him, “Uncle John! Uncle John! There you are! I’ve been looking  all over for you!!” And turning, John sees himself, laughing and smiling, scooping the little boy up in a great big hug.
'In the future', John thought. Just how long does this detective from Scotland Yard anticipate working with this teenager? John had not ever met a more extraordinary person. There must not be anyone else at university like Sherlock.
John placed about 10 careful stitches with out Sherlock as much as blinking. Even though Sherlock's breathing was slow and regular, this worried John.
But I had to go, I was going to be late for supper. My brief trip to the uni library had become much more than the intellectual respite I craved. I had already missed house and roll call, but I can make something
‘I didn’t think, really.” John said, realizing his socks were soaked with water, his feet wet inside his trainers.
He could imagine his brother standing, in his impeccable Armani suit, holding a sign that read ‘Puddings Not People’ and walking up and down #10 Downing Street or Buckingham Palace.
"John, can't you introduce me to your friend?" Molly was sweating too, like the rest of us. Covered in foam. Soaked from head to toe.
I was afraid. Afraid of what I'd find when I reached him. Right past the dead, frozen fountain, I could see a figure laying on the park bench. It was Sherlock for sure. Reclining on the bench lengthwise, one foot up on the arm rest of the bench, the other leg out to the side, bent at the knee. If it was any other day, one would think maybe he was resting his eyes. But it wasn't day, it was a frozen cold night, early winter in London.
"Well I..." John started, getting into the car and looking around. It was a little MG convertible. Mycroft was driving, there was no one else in the car.
They all ceremoniously walked me back to school and John signed me back in.  I got quite a few looks when I arrived at school with my small
I wasn't asked to speak at the meeting, neither was Sherlock. We sat and listened, while the adults around us decided the plan. I tried to listen as carefully as I could, while Sherlock slumped in his chair, arms crossed in front of him and his eyes shooting daggers at his brother.
"It's fine John," she placed her hand affectionately on his arm and gave her son a small smile. "John, we almost lost Harry." Her voice cracked slightly. "It's fine, really. We just want you safe and if you're happy we're happy."
``````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````
A week later, John was still in a foul mood. Harry was improving and safely tucked into a rehab in Finchely.
Ian leans in and whispers in John's ear. "Walk over with me to talk to her and I'll chat up the friend."
Making love is a different prospect, though, and can be full of promises, tenderness, care and comfort. I wasn't ready when it arrived.
“Sherlock wait.” John said as he caught the keys midair. John walked over to his best friend and caught Sherlock by the left wrist.
He barreled toward Jim. When he got there, he tapped Jim on the shoulder and when he turned towards him-- he belted him right in the jaw.
I moped 'round his flat all weekend.  Sunday morning he sat me down and told me to get my act together. I had to go back to school, eventually. He insisted I take a shower and change into fresh clothes.
The front of the pub seemed so far away. He had to go up there and make sure-- John slowed his pace---- he wasn’t sure what he was making sure about. He tried to take some deep breaths and slowed his pace even more.
Irresponsible Harry--in her last year in secondary school, making the most of it and spending her time at parties and pubs and not at the library. Who are her friends now? John has not been home since Christmas holiday. Had things changed? He knew there were some shaky acquaintances in her past—but last time he saw Harry she had been well---had she reconnected with a bad sort?
Sherlock, on the other hand, was not quite so sure. "I wouldn't underestimate him John, you don't know what he is capable of."
Back out in the snow, John now hears a sudden roaring in his ears.  He puts his hands over his ears to try to block out the sound. The wind kicks up and he can't keep his eyes open. He moves his arms to shield his eyes.
His voice was barely audible. "Nothing," he answered, sitting back down, small quiet smile on his lips. This time he was less agitated. I kept watching him, sipping his whisky, staring into the fire. He shook his glass, ice cubes tinkling and tossed his head back, draining his drink.
“When John got to the house, his football mates were happy to see him, “John, John! So good to see you, mate! Been scarce yeah?” He heard some one in the group ask.
As John tugged at the sleeve, Sherlock unloosened his arms, bringing them down from the front of his chest.
I sat down on the bed again. "Sherlock it's ok...you know...if you don't want to... I don't expect anything....I just want you to know. "
Can't remember when he slid into the group, can't remember how many pubs we visited. I had to admit that my powers of observation were dulled.
That fact that John thought of himself as some kind of caretaker or rescuer—well, that was his problem, not Sherlock’s. He didn’t need cared for or rescued.
John broke away, not wanting to. He was flushed and shaking his head above Sherlock. John looked at Sherlock pleadingly, eyes wide and then squeezed shut, then wide again,  “Oh, Sherlock, I'm sorry…I…”
Usually, dreams of Kandahar are nightmares, of roadside bombs and screaming, rarely are they of routine daily life, as this one seems to be. His small guide leads him inside the mess hall.
He sighed and reached into the pocket of his coat for the pack of cigarettes and lighter that he had also purchased at Tescos. Sherlock laughed at himself--what else could he get up to tonight, he wondered? Back to his old tricks of addiction and breaking and entering, even thought it was for a good cause. Well, he had to do something to get his mind off of John…..or the lack of John….who may not be back at uni for a few days….
Jim didn't get as angry as Irene thought he would at her dig. He smiled. "Irene, Irene, you forget that Sherlock and I were as thick as thieves last year at school. Perhaps there's a Sherlock Holmes that I know---that you don't." He dragged his sharp little tongue along his bottom lip.
No one has seen you since the night of the riot. Did you talk to the police?" Molly spoke to him like they were friends, but I could see her blushing.
He didn't get a chance to finish rambling because Sherlock leaned down and kissed him. it was brief it was soft and it was quick.
C drugs with intent to sell, deal or share such drugs, my being at the pub and away from my room has violated the terms of my bail.
Pockets…John dug through her jeans…money-a few bills--still there—cards---not robbed then-- the usual driver's---few white receipts from places she must’ve visited that day… what day? Today? Yesterday?
Mary wanted to get Sherlock out of the way so she could go out with me. She knocked on my door one night, sat on my bed and told me the whole thing. At first silent, cheeks pink, head down, she hesitantly began her story. "I fancied you, John, from the first time I saw you." She shifted uncomfortably on my bed. "Of course, I'm embarrassed about it now. But you never did fancy me-it was always him,
Sherlock's not as hairy as some blokes I've seen. Plenty of them in changing rooms at school. He doesn't smell bad either. As I sat across from him I noticed that the muscles of his arms as just as defined as his legs.
"Are you sure, Mary?" I took a step closer to Jim. I wasn't afraid of him. A few drinks in, I wasn't afraid of anyone.
John signed and sat quietly at the table thinking about football practice until he heard Sherlock’s door open. If Sherlock was awake and ok, maybe John could still make it to the pitch.
It was at first a very slow, gentle kiss, meant to be reassuringly tender, but didn't take long for John's hands to start to wander. He placed his right hand along Sherlock's cheek, noticing how very soft his newly shaved face was. As their tentative kisses deepened, John could smell Sherlock's aftershave, but could not place the sweet scent.  John worried briefly that he had shaved and bathed  many hours before. After walking for many blocks and getting caught in the rain,  he wondered if Sherlock'd mind.
“Really-- Scotland Yard will muck it up?” How was this possible? John thought. Professional investigators and police. The best and the brightest.
Sherlock looked own his nose at Jim Moriarty. Jim was obviously having too much fun at his expense. Sherlock failed to see the joke.
"Can you help or not? If not, please leave." Sherlock turned over on the sofa groaning and turned his back to the room.
Mrs. Hudson closed the door. John grabbed a kitchen chair and dragged it over to the sofa. "Are you going to tell me what happened? Not that it's any of my business, really."
“So, I want to make it very clear that am uncomfortable with him in my class. I...I find that I’m unable to speak in front of him anymore, I’m sorry sir, I’m just not up to the task.”
I looked at her, not sure what she meant, really. I looked down into the pint glass. "He's been a great help, yeah. I have chemistry sorted. This term's not a loss."
Mr. Watson had always been a drinker, but after the death of his wife, he was frequently at the local pub and often stayed out until very late.
"Hi John, I wanted to know if you wanted to go get curry." I can hear her voice, but I can't see her from where I sit.
Sherlock leaned down to kiss him and they stood there for a few minutes, against the door of John's room, with no sounds in the flat except two rapidly beating hearts, both forgetting that Stamford could come out for a glass of water or to use the loo.
Sherlock stepped in even closer and reached his hand around John's waist, leaning in. "It's been a very long night." he whispered quietly in John's ear.
Sherlock looked up to John's face, looked at his eyes, then his lips and down to John's hand, now pulling at the sleeve of his dressing gown.
What's he going on about John for? How annoying. He's sitting much too close to me. I have a theory that you can tell someone is psychotic if the lower part of the sclera is visible under the iris. Just a theory. Haven't met enough psychotics to test it out, but time's on my side. He slides me the mirror again and I look down at the diminished powder. How long have we been here? My jaw clenches but I do another blessed line.  A benevolent line. A beatific line.
All I have to do is walk past the floor guard, down the back steps and out the door. I did this every weekend last term. Works like a charm.
Sherlock nuzzled the back of John's neck as they stood there in the dim light. The fridge was still open, John standing in the cold of the open door. Sherlock reached under John's jersey and pressed his hand against John's flat stomach.
did Jim Moriarty give you this?" He wasn't looking at me. He was staring down at the small parcel in his hand.
He stared unseeingly at the glossy pages of a fashion magazine and he looked up to see someone standing in the doorway.
It looks like a great party, the kind he’d be sure to enjoy. John finds himself smiling as he hopes that he and Sherlock are here somewhere…
“I could ask you the same.” Sherlock said calmly, but his eyes were wide, looking down at Jim on the pub floor.
John sighed again, looking at Sherlock and realizing that he was just going to have to take it as it was. It was progress--kind of, he thought.
“Are you hungry?” Sherlock tried again, but John had sat himself down on the kerb, head in his hands, still processing the events of the evening.
“Well, that is quite a trek, no wonder you are tired.” Sherlock responds, absentmindedly.  “Are you ready to go to Devon today? Mycroft has someone he wants everyone to meet. A dried up old colleague, no doubt.”
A little over done then, right? He chided himself. Stupid git. Why couldn’t he be more restrained? The costume, the following him, the keys he nicked form the rental office this morning. He just could not leave well enough alone. Not to mention the not sleeping--at all--last night just thinking about John coming back to uni. It always has to be some sort of theatrics with him. His brother was right.
````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````
"Oh, many things, but especially this." he pulls out a small zippered package, half the size of a toiletry bag.
Over the next two weeks, John stopped over to the flat every few days to check on Sherlock-and sometimes bring food.
We went to another of the uni pubs, there are plenty. Sherlock was quiet, looking over his shoulder at times. He wouldn't tell me why when I asked.
“I was uncertain, so I asked him to my office after class to explain. He had done his own research sir. Of course, I was doubtful, and I couldn’t imagine where he had gotten the reagents or the equipment—or the time, even-- in order to undertake such an endeavor. He explained himself quite thoroughly, sir. And the complete statistics as well. So of course, I asked to see his notes….” he trailed off again.
As it happened, the boys had never been quite as alone as this. Sherlock had a nice big bedroom with a nice big bed.
Sherlock felt bad, but only a little. He backed off. Still smiling despite his disappointment, he whispered, “Good night, John Watson.”
Sherlock gives a quiet chuckle. “Well, where did you go?” he asks, swinging his long legs over the side of the bed as he gets up to go to the loo.
John was about three beers in when Mary showed up, looking for him. As soon as she got there, she made a bee line for John, grabbing him by the upper arm.
Sherlock sat up and kissed John. "I have an idea." He got up, locked the door to the flat and walked back to the sofa. He reached out to take John's hand. "I do have a bedroom-- in the back."
"Sherlock, I cant, I can't stay." John's voice only a small whisper. Sherlock was now sitting in his lap, rocking slightly, his hands up John's football shirt wandering to his waistband. Sherlock gave a small moan into John's mouth. John arched his back and his head started to swim. In one minute he'd be spending the night. He wanted nothing more than to flip Sherlock over and slam him into the mattress.
"Bye, Molly."  I said. This was inevitable, one way or another. I waited about 5 minutes, stood up, put on my coat and scarf and left the library.
I grabbed his arm. He looked at me, surprised and glanced down at where my hand was around his bicep. I had never touched him before.
When John got back to the table, his father had already gone, his mother was doing the dishes and Harriet was expectantly glaring at him over her glass of milk.
He'd imagined that the elderly lady at the counter owned the place. She brought the hot cup of tea over to his table and smiled kindly. John placed his bookbag under the table near his feet.
There was nothing for it, Sherlock could not take him to his residence hall at school and Mycroft's flat was really out of the question.  Baker Street it was.
The last thing John wanted was to spend anther minute with Jim Moriarty, no matter how Mary felt abut him. He wasn’t funny, he wasn’t nice and as a matter of fact, John felt there was something a bit ‘off’ about him. John did not trust him.
"I remember very little about that night. I have a concussion and memory loss."  I said, my voice sounding much smaller than I wanted it to.
John’s face was on fire, his cheeks were tingly, and he was slightly nauseous.  “Thanks, Mike,” was all he could manage.
Then Jim turned a bit and reached up to touch Sherlock on the shoulder. John’s heart was hammering in his ears, he couldn't hear anything but a dull roar.
Looking around, John sees that he is in a kitchen of a big house, 'Mary' again at his side. They both might have looked strange here, in dressing gowns in a stranger's kitchen, except for all the other people in the kitchen are wearing night clothes, too.
```````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````
I had already made sure the window was open. Hashish can be pungently sweet.  I don't need any more trouble.
“He’s upstairs dear. Go right on up, then." She then gave John a small smile and a conspiratorial whisper. "Doors unlocked.”
John.  John does his best thinking in the bath and he will be in there a while sorting himself out, Sherlock thought. As enthusiastic as John is about this new endeavor, Sherlock realizes he is also just as ambivalent, no – that’s not right, that’s not the right word, --‘frightened half to death’ would be a better description.
"Not if your doing as badly as I am." Ok, now I was feeling sorry for myself. So far a running theme of my first term at uni.
"Oi, Watson," Ian pressed a new football jersey into John's hands. "Put it on!! We'll wait---Pub's full of freshers tonight!! Let's go chat up some fit birds!! There's safety in numbers, mate!!"
I don't think I had ever been so angry in my life. I'm glad Sherlock stopped me. Took a while, though.
Can I make it better? Vouch for him at all? I tried to tell Lestrade how helpful Sherlock had been helping me with chemistry.  And that actually it was Sherlock that broke up the fight with me and Jim.
John's dated about 6 women this year, but I'm not keeping track. None of them lasted more than a month or two. Not sure why they don't last, but he's never really torn up about it. As for me, I rebuff anyone who tries to get close, men or women. Just not interested.
“A 'professor' at school called you? That’s funny. And funny how you jumped up there-how’s your leg? Looked like you bashed it good. You’ll have a bruise there tomorrow, I warrant.”
“Sure.” Sherlock smiled and they walked into Sherlock room, John falling in a heap into bed.  Sherlock helped him off with his shoes and John looked to be out cold, laying on his stomach. “…the rooms spinning.” He mumbled into the pillow.
I have a pretty good tolerance for alcohol, but even I was starting to feel a bit lightheaded. How long have we been here? I saw Mike and Molly dancing for a bit. I told them I was going to find water.
But once he got out onto the street, he wasn't yet clear about what he was doing, ot where he was going for that matter.
```````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````
John took the offered water bottle. It was just an average sized water bottle, disposable, the kind you get at Tesco's, but it struck John as hilarious. He snorted loudly, "When did you bring this with you and
There second floor of the club had a balcony, where you could actually get away from a foam for a bit. This is where I found Mary with Jim. They were talking in a dark corner, near the railing.
On this side of London, it was very quiet. Mostly residential, with buildings of flats, churches, few shops and our school.
Sherlock was laying on his stomach just waking from sleep. His eyes were still closed, and he realized that the other side of the bed was empty due to the lack of radiated warmth.
The train ride back to London was uneventful. When John emerged from the station, the day was bright and crisp. John doggedly trudged to the flat he shared with Mike and Sherlock and got there about noon. He dutifully unpacked, placing clean clothes in drawers.
He looks over the place, the details are incredible. The color of the tents and semi permanant buildings is as vivid as he remembers. The bustle of army life in front of him, the chatter of the soildiers, brings a kind of almost nostalgia.
As soon as I came back, Mary quickly released John's arm and sat up straight, looking directly at me. Not certain I can read the look on her face--like it's a challenge. But I had a few pints. Each Imperial pint is equal to 19.2152 fluid ounces. Surprised I haven't had more trips to the loo.
“Excuse me folks, this just became my lucky day.” Jim said as he looked toward the door. He gave them a greasy smile and scooped up the tiny envelope. He slid out of the booth and made a quick beeline for Sherlock at the front of the pub.
I didn't have many lights on in the room. "I probably have something for you to sleep in." I offered.
I asked him if there was a better time or place for him. I didn't want to put him out, but my marks were improving. I dreaded a time when he would not show up at all, just disappear. Eventually we were studying in my room. He seemed slightly more relaxed there, but only slightly.
He rolled his eyes, "No one listens to me. They think I'm ridiculous. They'll just tell me to piss off."
John's feet felt rooted to the pavement. He was having a right properly weird afternoon. He stood looking after Molly until he felt a chill on his face and started walking towards home.
My hand was on the doorknob. I had to get out of there. I needed to think. "You pushed John off a balcony. He could have died."
I had found a small table tucked in the back of the library against the wall. I settled myself in for a few hours of quiet reading order to distract myself until I could make sense of the recent events.
John began to feel a little tipsy but it was not at all uncomfortable. He looked over at Mary, who seemed delighted but not surprised at the change of atmosphere.
John closed his book and sat up straight in his chair. He wasn’t sure if he should get up and leave. Then Jim turned slowly and walked out the door,disappearing into the hallway. John heaved a sigh of relief. He waited a few moments and packed up his books to go home, it was almost dinner time anyway.
The back door of my building was locked, of course, I presented myself at the front door, planning on throwing myself on the mercy of the floor warden at the front desk. It was cold. They let me in without comment, not asking for an explanation. I'm sure I was reported as missing last night.
Transfixed, John stared into the distance. Mycroft immediately turned to see what John was staring at.
On their way back to the sitting room from the kitchen, John took a moment to appreciate the enormity of the house. "Very nice place, very nice. Who lives here, Mary?" He asked. As Mary sipped from a clear glass of white wine, he noticed she had on shiny blue lipstick. Not one to pay attention to shades of lipstick, he couldn't recall her wearing a shade like that before.
This time John laughed. “Sherlock, I’ve got about 2 stone on you. Believe me, you don’t want to fight me.”
John tried  2 more times  during the afternoon to reach Mary (unsuccessfully) before he got dressed in his football jersey and headed out to the party.
Sherlock picked it up. Luckily, John had scribbled the building name and office number in the margins. The sun was setting and Sherlock had an idea. Rolling up the paper, he tucked it into the pocket of his coat.
Often enough, it's a boring job. Same thing day after day. One doesn't want to get too complacent though, just in case  a seemingly meaningless communication turns out to be meaningful. That's why so many eyes are on so many screens.
"When?" he asks as he looks up from his book.  He can't see that I have trainers on from his position behind the desk.
John was nodding, “I am, I am sorry, very sorry, but I had to go help Sherlock… so--I’m sorry.” He shrugged and put both of his hands up.  He was swaying just a little.
“There you are dear, I thought I heard you come in!” She glanced at Sherlock who was laying on his stomach on the sofa—he did not look up when she opened the door. He could not see the look of concern on her face.
John slowly walked out of the bedroom. He stood in the doorway and looked up at Sherlock, who was holding two red cups. John smiled shyly, still confused a bit about what just happened with Mary.
Reflexively, John jumped up and gave a sharp turn, his right thigh getting caught on the table leg, practically taking the table with him.
The coke sits on the mirror in all it's  glory. I lean back in my seat and take a sip of my beer. News of my recreational cocaine use has gotten outside of school and the coke is seeking me out. How convenient. I watch Jim use the edge of a razor blade to cut the cocaine into a  finer powder. I can feel desire swell up in my groin in an ache.  The way I want this coke is visceral, my body aches for it. The small of my back is wet with sweat. It's not warm in here.
He looked down the stairwell, a good 8 flights below and heard the door to the outside world slam shut.
“….that I am breaking up with her. Unless she wants to break up with me, which would be fair. Completely fair.”
The trip to John's residence hall was longer than it needed to be, due to John not remembering his address.
There was nothing for it, Sherlock was not going to get any look at John's pupils but now he didn't need to. Sherlock went through what little cabinetry there was in the guest WC, more convinced than ever that he'd be unable to get John out of the party in this condition.
Sherlock's conversation with Jim had left him unsettled. He did not feel that he could call John his boyfriend because he wasn’t sure he was, really. As far as Sherlock was concerned, John had not yet  officially broken up with Mary. There had not been any kind of conversation where they discussed the definition of their relationship…yet. And if it was going to continue. Deep down, Sherlock still expected John to break it off at any minute, even when he is standing right beside him, or lying in his bed next to him.
He gave a cursory glance inside. Harry’s coat--thick wool, blue jeans, t shirt, her boots, leather, sturdy sole with a tread even though there was no snow on the ground in Chelmsford…he started to dig inside the bag, thinking.
I'm on my way back from the pub. It's getting colder, the sun sets early now. Its been a few weeks, with no word from John. No calls, no letters, no contact. I reckon this is it. Couldn't last. Too good to be true, really. My lot in life.
Sherlock was right about the headache. John took the pills and sat down, laying his head against the cool surface of the table.
Outside, in the cold night air, I wasn't able to keep up with his long strides. "Sherlock, slow down! Where are you going?" I asked, breathless, as I trotted beside him.
He continued, it's like he couldn't stop. "You won't find Mary looking over her shoulder. Mary's not afraid of anyone."
Everything I knew, which thankfully, was very little. I made Mycroft promise, promise that Victor would not go down. He said he'd do what he could. It was out of my hands. Caught in a sting--as it were. Too late.
that's how I knew your name, of course." Sherlock said, sipping his tea, trying to sound adult and composed. Sherlock always seemed to find himself in situations where he did not belong.   Out of his league, out of his depth and way over his head. Like now, giving explanations to the older, angry, accusatory brother of a fellow addict.
He could do it dammit, he could have a life with Sherlock and separate from him, too. He was sure of it.
My love of what was happening took me right over the edge. Victor didn't see the danger, either.  During Christmas hols at Victors, there was a siege,
I did it mostly to entertain John and to keep his knowledge about me to a minimum--overall the observations being completely useless.
John asked, noting the white shirt, dark jacket and striped tie that his companion wore, so different from the stained hoodie and trainers.
Jon ducked his head under the water, trying to soothe his sore mind. He started to recall more from last night and remembered that sometime in the middle of the night he awoke from a terrible night mare….
Pausing a moment to catch his breath, he moved his lips down Sherlock's smooth strong neck.  John was almost sitting in Sherlock's lap. He was feeling desperate and didn't want to leave a mark with his mouth or teeth, so he stopped and rested his head against Sherlock's shoulder, panting.  He could feel Sherlock hands playing with the waist band of his trousers.
As soon as he recognized it was me, he was screaming at me and threw a punch, but I caught his fist. I had him pinned to the floor, hands above his head. By that time the police arrived.
I sighed. "Well, actually I do remember you. That's about all I remember, though." I managed to pick up both crutches, but not the bag.
`````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````
been drugged, I really need a good look at your pupils." Sherlock sighed, standing there with his arms crossed in front of him, sounding much too composed for the situation.
Once outside, I stood waiting in the shadows until the security truck pulled round the front, out of sight. Then I ran for it.
Two years ago he came up to me in the school dining room. I was immediately suspicious. There could be no good reason for him to want to talk to me. Turns out, he wanted to know if I could get him drugs. He tried to promise me that he'd make sure the footballers left me alone. I told him that I had no usual supplier, but that I got everything in Camden, just to throw him off. I wasn't telling Seb anything he didn't already know.
"Yeah," he said. "Thought he'd be upset, you know?--about the break up." he laughed, "But he wasn't, he said he felt good about it. Settled."
He had lost weight that he could little afford to lose. He was wearing his own pajamas, I imagined, they didn't look like hospital issue. Dressing gown over those. Fading purple bruises on the backs of his hands. He had a big dry gauze dressing on his lower neck. Mycroft told me they had taken out a large port of some kind, the kind to give IV fluids and medicines. The location of it especially stung--this was exactly where the 'love bite' was that I had given him. Seems like so long ago.
One of the many things Sherlock is good at, is making me forget what I was going to say. "Sherlock, I'm still worried about you." my voice strained, I wanted him so badly.   My groin was aching, but so was my heart.
After searching each room, Sherlock found him the kitchen of the flat, talking and laughing with a group of people and he was totally arsed. Unsteady on his feet and boisterous, he greeted Sherlock loudly, like his long lost brother.  “And there he is! Sherlock, Mate!”
"See you tomorrow, John Watson." Sherlock whispers and walks away to his bedroom and closes the door.
“Sherlock! Sherlock!” he turned to the sound of his name and saw Molly Hooper, Mike Stamford and Liz--Mike’s girlfriend waving at him from down the street.
“Sorry, I shouldn’t have brought it up, but I wanted you to know...” John started, touching Sherlock’s outer thigh with his sock clad big toe.
He saw the surprised look on my face, "I can drive John, no need to trouble my driver when..." his voice faltered, he cleared his throat,  "when...I'd rather...as you can imagine, I'd rather this not get out."
The party was crowded, these parties always are. The house was big, but it didn’t matter. Wall to wall people--all the footballers, loads of girls. No John, as far as Sherlock could tell, glancing around. He ran into Molly and Janine. Mary must be here, then. He didn’t want to ask, too obvious. He made a pretense of getting a beer. He held one of those American party cups stiffly, as if it was holding a noxious chemical.
They sat in silence for a moment, then John tentatively said, “Actually, Happy Birthday of course, and I was hoping this could be maybe a belated birthday, um…dinner and my treat, but…um..., it looks like the food will be on the house.”
The Head of the Department wanted to be kind. "I think it quite understandable to have a student look at the professor. In fact, we insist up on it."
His back and legs were aching. He briefly thought about going to get 2 paracetamol, but he didn’t want again to look at the broken furniture in the sitting room and come face to face with the material evidence of his wild behavior.
John's brain started to reel. He turned around to face Sherlock. Sherlock's face was illuminated in the light of the refrigerator. His skin was glowing, but the bruise was getting bigger along his cheek. Sherlock's eyes glinted in the light, he looked so young. He backed John up against the edge of kitchen counter and leaned into him.
"Heaven forbid I get in your way." Sherlock said with another smile as he tossed on a new vest. "Don't worry about me John, I've a job to do." He tossed John his phone as he walked out of the bedroom abruptly, leaving John staring after him.
But those thoughts disappeared as his right hand dipped to Sherlock's neck, then to open the top button of his shirt. His left hand wandered upwards and buried itself in Sherlock's hair, puling him closer. His fingers eagerly found the next button, and a small moan escaped his lips when his hand wandered inside Sherlock's button down and found a firm chest and he rubbed his warm palm over an erect nipple.
"Communication incoming from the metropolitan police." Reports the newest employee, on duty as the first line response.
I am alone to ponder. Laughing at myself, I spend a few awkward moments considering that it might be a dream as I walk to the loo. I take the hottest shower I can stand, washing my sticky body. I spy a noticeable black and blue mark on my left hipbone.  No dream then.
With little money in his pocket, John reasoned that walking was his best bet to get to the university. He had no umbrella, but was hopeful that the rain would let up.
at him, obviously flirting.  I walked straight over there, but John gave me a task, so I went in search of the server.
I smiled but the joke fell flat. John looked at me, face blank. Any small hope John had of actually going back to sleep was thoroughly dashed  at this point.
I took a few swigs of the drink. It was fruity and didn't taste at all like alcohol, but I knew better.
"The way they look at you. They both glance at you--often. They search your face, probably looking for non-verbal clues that you're interested. They look at your lips as your talking-people don't just do that unless there's some sexual interest or physical attraction. That's what people do, but it's unconscious.
John suddenly finds himself on the front stoop of the Holmes family estate in Devon. John has been here many times before.  Although, after 10 years of being made to feel just as much a part of this family as his own, there are times, right in the middle of it all, when he still has to pinch himself to make certain he is awake.
I'm rarely nervous. I'm obnoxious, I'm dismissive, I'm sarcastic, I'm reckless, I'm a drug user, a delinquent--but I'm rarely nervous.
he said, hopping up again. I started to protest, but he was back quickly, handing me a refreshed glass of toffee-colored liquid. I laughed, "What's gotten into you, John?"
“Sherlock, come in, come in!” The boisterous, friendly man escorted them to a table. “Sit, sit please!-- so nice to see you! Whatever you want, anything, anything on the menu for you and your date!” Angelo dropped off menus and walked away.
I turned it over in my hand. It was a small white package, tiny. It was firm, but slender, folded over like a small envelope. "When?"
The body was found with a gunshot wound to the right side of the head and the gun in the right hand. Lestrade dreaded calling Sherlock, due to having already asked him to help the week before. He knew Sherlock was likely still recovering from a fight with a suspected forger. John and Lestrade's team did intervene, but not in time for Sherlock to avoid a beating.
As bad as this was for John, it was actually much more of a disaster for me. As soon as the police showed up, my game was over.
Sherlock smiled, “And a bloody good left hook too, Mr. Watson! And there goes Jim Moriarty down like a stone!” Sherlock now sat down on his coat, crossing his legs, as well as his arms.
Despite pleading, then angry silence-- from the tube station to the destination, Sherlock would not give John any information.
Mary, Sherlock--of course there is no competition. Mary petite blonde, flirty, charming. Fun loving. And Sherlock--who defies all description. Imperious and vulnerable. Granite and fragile. As cold as ice and a hot as…well. God, the night they just spent together was the most fun he had ever had in bed…and that was saying something. He could imagine himself staying with Sherlock forever…if…well.
When I turned, I was surprised to find Molly at my elbow. She had come to help me walk back to the residence hall. She does that sometimes.
John Watson dragged his suitcase out of the Tube car. He negotiates several passageways, dogging commuters on his way to the stairway and out to the rainy slick street. Traffic looked terrible when John emerged from Russel Square Station. Taking a deep breath, mostly of car exhaust, he felt a flutter of hope in his chest. He was so glad to be back in London.
But this bloke was a fast runner. Despite dodging medicine carts and skirting by nurses, he bolted down the stairwell at the end of the corridor and John lost him.
The red pen the only one he could find in this messy flat, apparently not indicative of anything but expedience.
As Mycroft opened the door, in walked Mike and Liz, back from the pub. They both wore surprised expressions when they saw that the flat was not empty.
Luckily, Mary continued, Jim was there to escort her home.  Well, she had him there. Except for the lucky part.
Outside in the back alley, Sherlock grabbed a long piece of wood and wedged it into the door handle and stood in front of Irene. They should have been running. They could hear Jim just inside, screaming in rage at finding them both gone.  With a perplexed expression, Sherlock leaned over and lightly kissed Irene on the cheek and ran down the alleyway.
This had gone spectacularly badly. I walked back to school, indeed wearing John's track pants, slightly short on me.
"Yeah, more," I said, voice tight as I stared at him. My eyes drifted down to his lips, lips that were now just a few inches from mine.
-I had entertained that he may have been trying to get me drunk in order to seduce me. Then again, maybe that was just my fervent wish superimposed upon reality.
“Yes, I am and you are correct as always." Sherlock said sarcastically, then, "Of course not!” This time, almost shouting. "I'm older now, I don't just go 'round blowing things up!" Sherlock gestured wildly at the ruined building to the left.
“I’m sure you have a headache. There's  paracetamol here on the table. And the kettles’ on.” Sherlock said.
I have a dressing gown over my all black clothes. I'm sneaking out. I have a life beyond these walls, despite what my brother wants.
"Yes John, it would be the thing to do, when you get the chance. When I called, I identified myself as a 'university administrator' and informed them that you were perfectly fine. but I'm sure they'd love to hear your voice."
He squeezed my bicep a little too hard. I looked down at his hand on my arm. "Please," he said. "Just one moment, hear me out,
John ran outside. The snow was falling harder, which was a surprise so late in April. He ran up and down the pavement like a madman staring at the sky. He turned back to the hospital to see if he could be spotted from the front of the building. Luckily, no one was there to witness his frantic display.
John came in at about 10 am on Saturday morning. He was wearing the same clothes that he had on the night before. John had been feeling so much better after his concussion and was hoping to start to practice again with the football team that morning. With a spring in his step, he walked into the flat and found Mike at the kitchen table drinking tea.
I opened one eye to a dim room. I looked at the ceiling, wondering in a lifting haze of sleep where I was. Then a heard a creak and looked over to see Sherlock standing on my desk.
There were classes, parties and football games. John tried to get Sherlock to come to one game, any game, but he adamantly refused.
Sherlock ran back to the flat afraid that John would be steady on his heels. He ran at a fast clip, shoes slipping a bit in the light snow that had just fallen. His heart was beating wildly. His chest burned from all the exertion. He had gone into the pub for a pint, which was not his usual habit, but he knew it would not be as crowded. He knew the bar tender and getting a pint would not be a problem.
“I’d like you to give me the cocaine.” John walked over, stood in front of Sherlock and put out his hand, palm up.
Mary put her fork down and watched John at first push himself away from the table, then stand up. His voice was low and he sounded concerned.
`````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````
that he is.... I heard he gets around quite a bit…heard he’s made his way through a least 3 of the residence halls…breaking hearts as he goes,” Jim snickered, and made a movement as if wiping a tear away from his eye.
Sherlock thought about Irene Adler as they crossed another street. Irene--again another one. Pretty straight forward to Sherlock. Mercenary, that's all. Only out for herself. Survivalist. Liar.
Nonetheless, I kept a low profile from then on. No more nighttime excursions--for the time being. Stayed at school, mostly. I did frequent a cafe at the university and I did still like to haunt the library.
John wasted no time getting to Baker Street. At just short of a run, it took about 5 minutes. John's goal was to have some degree of separation between him and Sherlock but still felt uneasy when Sherlock was alone for too long.
"I've been thinking about this all night--since we got the call from Lestrade." I put a hand on my forehead, I'm getting a headache.
John just stands there, listening. He suspects it to be Lestrade, although Sherlock hasn't said. "We're making the
John was getting around well on the new brace. Half way through the pint, I decided beer wasn't so bad.
So, I'll scold him so he won't see how much I have been admiring him. I don't like when he looks into my eyes, I'm afraid of what he can see there.
"Sherlock,"  I whispered. There was a fine dusting of silver snow in his dark hair. He was breathing, his skin was whiter than usual, cold, pale, ethereal. His nose had been bleeding, I could see some dried blood there.  Terrified, I knew he'd die if I didn't get him someplace warm. "Sherlock, please."
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
John sat up to scrub his arms. With Harry for a sister and all her problems starting so young, out all night, his parents so angry at the crowds she hung with. Harry so determined to do her own thing…John often wondered if she was rebellious just to get their goat, but no, that was not it…she was who she was and he was, well ….who he was too…the apple doesn’t fall too far from the tree, now does it?
“Sherlock you know why. Let’s not get into this again. We spend all together too much time with each other and people…talk.”
"You should tell that to John." I glanced around. I doubted that there was another way out of the loo.
This morning when he woke up his only worry was the paper he had to get in by the end of the day. Now after seeing Jim all but stalking him at the library and after that, enduring Molly’s scolding, John had other things on his mind. Lots of other things.
I expected to get reprimanded by my brother, who has been my guardian since our parents died. He and I now  have
Eventually, John asked Mary out on a date. After a few successful dates to the pub and cinema, John and Mary started officially dating. Mary often popped over to the flat a few times each week and they often went out on Fridays.
It was a very pretty row house. Large rooms, high ceilings, expensive looking furniture. Music blaring from--
I was spending lots of time in the library, studying. I was staring at books for hours and getting nowhere.
“I’m sorry John, I guess I presumed a liberty here, but I thought you would want to know. I apologize for overstepping my bounds.” Now, Mycroft Holmes looks at his feet.
John did not say anything. He looked up into Sherlock's eyes and then down at his lips. He didn’t say no. He didn’t move away.
Leaving Sherlock on the sofa resting he went to the loo to look for supplies. He located soap and flannels for washing and drying.
I know I took too long to answer her.  I just stood there, on the pavement, half way to our building, staring at her, or rather, through her.
John chuckled, and looked down at his shoes, cheeks pink but not from drinking. "Ian, I..." John looks over at the girls who indeed are looking directly at John and Ian, giggling.
But the voice on the other end wasn't giving any details. "Yes sir--she's here--we've admitted her to hospital."
Jim Moriarty drops the charges against John and Lestrade told me that since the school term is almost over, the magistrate is going to consider my sentence (mostly) served. I still have to meet monthly with my 'offender manager', which has now been changed to
But Sherlock knew that tonight Mycroft was right, sod him. This is something John needed to do alone. John and his family were having a crisis and there was no room for Sherlock there. Not tonight.
`````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````
--A small warning in my brain reminds me that I can't let John see what's in my pocket. I grab both of his shoulders to disengage. "--Wait." I said, breathless.
I thought about what he said, he was right. I stood up, letting my trouser leg fall over the uncomfortable dressing. "Thank you." I said quietly.
Sherlock and I went to the pub. Not the pub where we were arrested, to avoid running into Jim again.
It's close to time for me to take him back to his school. We'll walk back slowly and we'll talk about all manner of things and then I'll sign him back in until about 48 hours later. I'll think about him until I see him again.
`````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````
"Please don't go." I tried to reach for him, he pulled away. "Wait, is your building even open at this hour?"
He had to side step a few small groups as he walked. He could still see Jim having an animated conversation with Sherlock and Sherlock listening intently. From his vantage point, he saw Jim’s right hand actually reach into the pocket of Sherlock’s coat. Sherlock did not react, but was listening seriously.
He opened his eyes to look towards Sherlock's side of the bed, near the door. Sherlock was asleep, John knew. 10 years of sleeping with someone will cue you in to just those patterns. John could not see his face, but he could hear him breathing evenly, quietly, peacefully. John let his eyes linger over Sherlock's broad, well toned shoulders, his hard muscled back tapering to a slim waist. Not an ounce of fat on him, although he never exercised, well, not formally. John smiled.
The boys chatted amiably, and owing to the quality of some of John’s observations, Sherlock was less afraid that John’d had too much to drink.
As John sank into the hot water, he felt exhilarated and discouraged. He couldn’t get last night out of his mind. He wanted to stay up all night with Sherlock and never sleep. The more time he spends with Sherlock, the harder he finds it to tear himself from Sherlock’s side. He gets lost in their conversations, lost in Sherlock’s schemes, observations, and his brilliance. And now, as their relationship takes a new turn, he gets so lost in Sherlock, it frightens him.
revenge-the sabotage of mine and Sherlock's friendship. He planned to get in between us by making me suspicious about Sherlock's drug use. His plan was to get us to argue, and break up, which, in truth, worked very well,
I called his room but there was no answer. Over the next few days, I ran around town looking everywhere--the pub, the library (in the back), the uni coffee shop. Nothing.
Sherlock was surprised when John turned over and edged his way to Sherlock’s side. John wrapped his right arm over Sherlock’s stomach, and wriggled his way under Sherlock’s right arm, with his head resting on Sherlock’s right shoulder.
John approached the hospital door. A heavy anchor of dread weighed down his heart. Once inside, he was guided to intensive care by helpful staff. The floor had a hushed quiet that seemed to insulate it from outside noise.
I was told it was the finest hashish on the streets in the last few months. I don't always believe what they say. I have my own methods. I like to do plenty of research.
He's a smooth driver, alert and competent, never hard on the gas or the breaks. He navigates the London streets like a professional driver, rather than the shadowy government figure he really is.
“Sherlock, you look terrible.” John mentioned as he tossed his suitcase on the first available bed in a down stairs bedroom.
John looks at Sherlock, his usually silver green eyes are now a cloudy grey. John nods at him, thankful for the offer. Standing up, he reaches into his bag and hands the paper to Sherlock. Shoulders squared, composing himself, he clears his throat and asks, “Which hospital?”
“Think so,” Sherlock sighed. "No matter." he said as he turned to look at John, who again had a lost and devastated look in his eyes.
Mary was smiling and shouting something in my ear. I nodded at her but didn't know what she said. I think she went to get drinks. They were free now that we were in the place.
-Confront them now. Get the beating over with. John was sure he could hold his own. Well, he hoped. Three to one, though.
Sherlock touched the back of John’s  neck, gently pulling him closer. Sherlock turned his head to the side a bit, opening his mouth a bit more, eagerly wanting to make it as easy as possible for John to kiss him, to touch as much of John's soft wet lips as he could reach with his own.
The last thing Sherlock wanted to do was to go to any party, and most of all a football party, with all the noise and commotion. John would likely have a confrontation with Mary, it was probably in Sherlock's best interest not to be there. Why should he go? What's the worst that could happen? John sees Mary, changes his mind and leaves with her?
We were a mess. John's hands were scraped and bleeding. We both had blood down the front of our clothes. John's lip was split open, the bloke must've landed a punch at some point. The next day I would sport a black eye--John must've punched me, but I hadn't noticed it yet.
Sherlock stood and turned quickly to grab the coat at the same time, dodging John’s arms as he made to reach for it.
He looked up from the desk and sighed, and placed something into his front shirt pocket. He glanced at Irene with a blank expression.  "Fine, I own you one, then."
Sherlock found lots of people easily readable, but not Jim Moriarty. He was loathe to admit that he and Jim might be similar, despite Jim's insistence. The only thing Sherlock had to concede was that he and Jim could both travel down dark roads. Some of those roads they had traveled together.
John got back to the flat he shared with the football team and was met by a group of lads in the sitting room who all stood up when he entered. He noticed that they were all wearing new football jerseys.
a sight for sore eyes!" A warm arm was thrown around his shoulders and a kiss was planted on his cheek.
Halfway through John's tea the door blew open and in walked the person he'd been waiting for. Dressed much differently that John had ever seen him before, but still the same person. He nodded at the older woman, walked directly to John's table in three long strides and slid into the chair.
John yelled out and stood up. “Don’t you dare run again, Sherlock, I will come after you and I’m not afraid to tear into you, either.”
Not that I liked that term at all, but damn it I still needed him and I was willing to do almost anything to save him from getting tossed out of school. Or tossed in jail. Or whatever they were threatening him with.
“No, it’s OK, I can do it at mine.” Sherlock said lightheartedly, flopping onto Johns’ unmade bed, then his face became serious. “Of course, it could have been
John followed Mycroft down the steps and out into the cold. The street was quiet, dusted with a light snow. Snow that was sure to be gone by morning.
The music was blasting so loud that only the base of the song could be heard. The chatting and laughing students raised their voices to be heard above the music. The walls were shaking at times.
I thought maybe he was just not interested in people, but there he was, walking towards me, maybe I did have a chance. I just didn't want to be stupid about this. I wondered if he knew how I felt.  How much I felt for him, so early, it scared me. I hoped it wasn't written all over my face, or if others can see. I'm going to try to be cooler maybe. Calmer.
I made my way to the park. It was snowing harder. The benches were covered with snow. I lay down on a bench and look up at the falling snowflakes. The street lamps were as bright as the sun. Had to close my eyes. Started to dream of John. I could see him in my dream. He was talking to me and he wasn't at all angry this time. I kept repeating, "How did you get here? How did you get into my dream, John?"
We talked about a lot of things. I wanted to fill him in on all the things that happened while he was in hospital.
I was going to have to tell John everything. He didn't know all the details of Victor and me, nor the drugs. John knew some of that story but we had never had any full disclosure. I never had the chance to just tell him everything. I was afraid I'd make me look bad--no--worse in his eyes. And where was it going to get me?
Sherlock could not shake the guilt. As he trudged along by Jim's side, scarf tightly around his neck, he could only think of John. John who was worrying by his afflicted sister's side, at hospital, where Sherlock should really be. By John's side. He didn't let on to Mike and the girls that John really went to see Harry. And yet, he felt better here somehow than at the pub, where the music was loud, and the atmosphere was jovial. He wasn't in a jovial mood. He was angry and he didn't know why.
“Please continue.” He glanced at his watch. Maybe he could cancel the 1pm appointment and have a later lunch.
"Is that how you got the bruise?" John touches it gently. Ugly, blue, purple and red. Sherlock does not pull away this time. He lets John touch his face.
“That's amazing! Absolutely amazing. But why are you holding on to that? It should be with Scotland Yard.” John was very worried that trouble would come from holding onto a piece of evidence, from a bombing, no less.
“Sherlock, Sherlock! That’s all I hear from you, John!! You know, we shouldn’t even be having this conversation--because you’re
John thinks he can see a slight movement in the angle of Sherlock’s shoulders. He must be anticipating more of John’s anger. What else do they know?
"So, it was a gift?" Johns voice was quiet, sat up and reached for his track pants lying on the floor.
Sherlock imagined that this was a one-time thing, heat of the moment-maybe and as nice as Sherlock thought it was, he imagined that John would not let it continue. John's romantic reputation had preceded him. Sherlock was quite aware of John’s reputation with the girls at uni; he heard what other students said.  John Watson, football player and a bit of a lady’s man,  had dated girls from all of the 3 residence halls on campus, as well as girls who lived off campus, too.
I felt badly for him, of course. I'm not heartless, like everyone assumes. I walked over and offered to help, but he just scolded me.
The house that he was sharing with the rest of the football team was not far from campus. This year John was vice president of the recreation football club. It was just a side activity, no scholarships here, and he knew he wasn’t going to be a professional footballer, but John loved football.
John smiled shyly at Sherlock, his bright white teeth in contrast to the slight tan he got over the summer. Even his blond hair was sunkissed. He looked like he could be been a lifeguard on a UK beach.
I did get a hold of myself--briefly--head clear enough to remove my own shirt. I carefully folded it and lay it over my coat, front pocket facing up.  Gravity is a friend to me and the little white envelope. John took my hand and led me over to his bed.
We walk back to my residence hall, just chatting. Not about school, not about trials or police, or bodily injuries.
Three pints in, I asked him to play billiards. He said he was not much of a player, but beat me soundly,
John could not tear his eyes away. His throat was dry. What could Jim want with Sherlock? Jim walked right up to him and started a conversation. They were talking. Did they know each other? John could only see the back of Jim’s head. He could see Sherlock’s face, but he wasn’t speaking now, and his face was impassive.
"I would like to report that the planning meeting for the Christmas Campaign has  been a success, sir and all supplies have been, um... acquired and secured."
John leaves with Mycroft, not getting a chance to mention Jim, Molly, or plans for the summer. He had to get to Chelmsford.
He can see two dark figures walking against a white  background.  Walking along the edge of  lake on a large estate. It was massive. Massive estate and massive lake. John had never seen anything so beautiful in his life. The air was cold, the trees surrounding the lake also massive, branches full of the new snow that had fallen that day.
Mary appeared out of the foam momentarily, pressed a drink into my hand, said something in my ear and disappeared.
The CCTV camera was mounted on a light pole, pointed at the parking lot. The snow was coming steadily down, starting to cover the cars. John tried to gauge just where the camera was pointing, trying to scope out where he needed to stand.
I just looked at him for a long time. I never see him like this. He's often frowning in thought or worry.
Harry did not look good. Flat on her back in hospital bed looking pale and haggard.  Three IV poles at least, he counted, being mauouvered by two nurses, who both paused and looked up when he stood in the doorway. He turned to see someone behind him. It was the doctor, looking grave.
It has to be Lestrade, John can't imagine who else it could be that Sherlock is explaining their holiday plans to.
"Hello, Mr. Watson, this call is from St. Stephen's Hospital. You have been identified as the next of kin to Harriet Watson?"
"I've decided to come out alone. No one else is aware of the details of this situation but you and I." Mycroft pulled away from the kerb and they started off towards London. "Of course, you will need to explain why you felt you had to go these extreme lengths in order to get my attention."
I assured Molly that I did talk to the police, when in fact I didn't. To hide being uncomfortable, I picked up John's bag of books, so I could avert my eyes.
"See you at the party, John." Again, James gives John a conspiratory wink, turns on his heel and walks away.
"I guess Sherlock's not here, then." she said looking around, taking a tentative sip from her glass.
This is a continuation of the previous chapter. I usually alternate between the boys, but this is Sherlock's perspective, ch 15 and 16.
As they both passed through the doorway into the raucous party, Sherlock tuned back to John with a smirk,
He leaned forward to kiss me and there was nothing fragile about it. Hospital doors don't lock, but I didn't care. I missed him.
He finally looked up at me, but it wasn't the kind of look I wanted. It was cold and vacant. "What do you care?" he said quietly and walked out of my room.
In a daze, he asked Mary to wait outside his sister's room, and she did. She sat on one of the metal chairs in the hallway.
We were all interviewed by the police for the investigation.  The newspapers and morning shows wanted to talk to us too, but we weren't allowed.  Everyone wanted to find the bloke who was with Molly and rescued all the students and helped people find the door, but no one knew who he was.
John cleared his throat and spoke quietly, “It would be best if you could just back away just a bit, please for me, I… I can’t, this is just way too much for me to process right now.”
I changed my mind. I wanted to go over there and ask to go home with him on the spot. I wanted to go over there and grab him by the atrocious beige jumper and kiss him in the middle of the pub, in front of everyone. I wanted to take his clothes off right then and there.  I was ready to beg him, on my knees if I had to, to beg for forgiveness--of anything. Of anything I did real or imagined that made him unhappy.
Sherlock glanced at the window of my room. The moon outside must've been full and bright, the curtains parted just enough to let in a beam of moonlight shining on Sherlock. We had fallen asleep. Not sure what time it was--but middle of the night I guess. I couldn't take my eyes off him.  "I wish you'd tell me what is going on."
Mike appears over Liz's shoulder, "Liz, come to bed." he reaches for her hand and pulls her gently back to his room as she protests.
Sherlock found that John was distracted all afternoon and not very talkative, he was brooding. He watched John tidy up the kitchen and try to read the newspaper.  If Sherlock asked him a question, he got a one word answer. Sherlock lounged on the sofa in his track pants, t-shirt and dressing gown, watching John pace around the flat and worry, while Sherlock was pretending to read.
I dumped my books on a seat and John handed me a pint. This place was packed with uni kids. It was loud, sweaty and John and his mates appeared to be in their element.
John sat up. The lights in the parking lot shone brightly and the snow on the cars was sparkling. Looking down at his now wet trainers, he kicked the snow in disgust. The toe of his trainers left a divot and he could see the black parking lot under the snow. /p>
I'm sure I blush when I look at him. I'm afraid I stand too close to him. I know I hang on his every word. How can I pretend I'm just his friend?
John had a pain in his chest, as though he just got punched, but Molly didn’t cause it. “Right, it's ok.” he said, giving a sigh of relief. “Molly, how are you?”
Immediately, they were outside standing on the street below the flat. John was now in a dressing gown, and trainers. He gave himself a mental pat on the back for remembering those, it was winter after all. A coat would have been a better idea, but he wasn't cold.
