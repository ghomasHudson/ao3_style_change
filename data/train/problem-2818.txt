"He snuck into my room while we were talking. He told me how much he's loved me. We made love and when I woke up after napping post-coital, he was humming "Blackbird" by the Beatles to me." Cas said. "He explained that Mary used to sing Beatles songs to him when he got sick." He smiled.
"I don't like being shamed like this." Cas said.
When Dean had come back, his room was different. It still had the Craig and Sam had dropped off the peanut butter stuff. Miracle was waiting on the bed where he found him and he licked at Dean's face, Dean smiling lightly. Realizing the bunker was unusually quiet, he and Miracle walked around the bunker to see if his ground lamb was in the kitchen. Dean suddenly heard a crash in the kitchen and Dean ran in to see what was wrong when the lights instantly came on and Eileen and Sam jumped out with a cake.
"The last wish made from the first tree was from Eustace. He wished Muriel would have a bigger head to see sense that the tree was not good for them. It was really out of jealousy." Courage said.
"OOH, I didn't know it was gonna rain today." Muriel said. Dean frowned and looked at Courage, who was shaking.
"So Balthazar sent you to this dimension years ago, but this is still Sam's first time?" Misha asked when they were back at his rental.
"Great, come on up. My Skene's gland fluid is running like a river. Fill me up like a cup of wine, baby." Gen hollered. Sam, defeated, sighed and walked back in the house.
"Hello, Dean." Cas said as Dean tackled him to the ground in a tight hug, but did something he never thought he'd get to do ever: He kissed Cas. Hard and deep.
"Dean, I-" Dean interrupted Cas by locking lips with the new God, surprising Bobby.
"She's helping Misha's wife with their son, he was just born." Dean said. Misha shot back.
"We're fine. You? Where's Ruby?" Dean asked back.
"Not yet, we're still riding the high of getting engaged." Dean said. "But I'm probably thinking the day we met, in that barn. That's actually where our house is. We bought the place for a steal, then we quickly built the house from the ground up." Dean smiled as he thought about how he and Cas built their house.
..............................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Sam found it hard to sleep, as did Jack. The two men found it hard to cope.
"He deserves it. Now shush and sit at your space." Anna said as they took their places. Once Lucifer walked over with Dean's bags packed, Cas permeated his scent and touched the back of Dean's neck, covering the Omega in his comforting aroma of honey and firewood, with just a hint of applewood.
"How do you think I feel, pal? I'll stop carving sigils into you if you tell me where you hid Cas's grace. He gave up an army of Angels led by a sycophantic bitch who agreed I was Cas's weakness and needed to be eliminated for him to be proven as a wise leader, I owe him everything. I won't ask again, Metatron. This is akin to no one getting what they want." Dean leaned in close. "Where. Did. You. Put. Castiel's. GRACE!?" Dean roared that last one, causing Metatron's eardrum to shatter.
"Maybe I should go to a nearby Whole Foods and make some brains to recreate that night." Misha said and Jensen giggled nervously at that. Just then, West started standing up and Jensen alerted Misha. Misha went right over to West and helped the little guy walk. Jensen took a video to send to Misha so he could show Vicki and Misha smiled, biting his lip as Jensen watched the father and son. After finishing filming the video, Misha picked West up and walked back over to Jensen, who then pulled the older man in for a kiss.
"No, I got everything I need and want." Dean said as he nuzzled Cas's clavicle.
..............................................................................................................................................................................................................................
"You're beautiful like this." Dean said. "Looking wrecked, kiss-swollen with mussed hair. I also love how blown out your eyes look. Darker due to lust but still so ocean blue." Dean proceeded then to enter Cas and slowly thrust into the older man until. They made out as Dean rode him, they clung to each other until they finally climaxed. When all was said and done, Dean and Cas were redressed and soon, drove off to the motel to cuddle together, once again leaving Sam to get a taxi and Gabriel to fly off, making things further awkward between the two forgotten brothers. But not for the sword of Michael and the Angel of the lord who saved him. For them, it was bliss as they were reunited not only in soul and grace, but also in physical and emotional unity. Life was gonna be good again now.
“I got some help from the one son who was right to never listen to you.” Jack said as he finished sucking all of Chuck’s powers and absorbing it into his system.
"Jens gone?" Gen called out.
"At least we don't have any Muskims in our family on either side. Anyway, says here that Eustace owns a farmhouse and subsequent farmland in the middle of Nowhere." Dean said. "Has a wife named Muriel. Wanna look for Nowhere?"
"The one and only. I'm surprised you remember my name. You seem to forget how your mother sacrificed her spirit to cancel out the poltergeist. Don't act so surprised. It's the stuff of legends in the Monster community." Jacob said. "The ghost of Mary Campbell Winchester, murdered by Hell Prince Azazel on November 2nd, 1983. 22 Years later, a family of three moves into the Winchester family home at the same time a poltergeist does, while the oldest daughter of the family that moves in sees the fiery ghost of Mary Winchester in her closet, as her mother had her take what was once Sam Winchester's nursery. With help from you, Sam and medium Missouri Moseley, you first tried to cleanse the house of the poltergeist but it didn't work. So you and Sam stayed behind just in case something went wrong, and wrong did something go until the ghost in the oldest daughter's bedroom revealed herself to be Mary Winchester, who said one last goodbye to her two boys before chasing after the poltergeist, saving her sons and the family living in that house. My mom and I heard that story echoing through our heads when Eve was revived and my mom repeated that story when I got sick, as a justification as to why she was sacrificing her morals to save me." Jacob said. Dean started to develop a lump in his throat. "My mom may be alive, but I missed a lot of milestones with her, Dean. And I want you to pay." He said as he was about to take a swing. Suddenly though, his hand was pulled back by a cord.
"Oh, that's rich, dearie. She's more than just an Amazon. She's a Golden Amazon, and the child of a favorite acquaintance of mine. Besides her uncle, who killed her the first time. You done buggered up and caught yourself a Winchester." Rowena said as she freed Emma from her binds.
"Dean!" Sam and Cas said in surprise and awe."
"Gabriel?" Castiel asked just before Gabriel duct taped him at the snap of his fingers.
"I come with one too, pal. This man is protected and is NOT Castiel." Dean said as he slammed his hand on the sigil, making the Angel disappear. Misha looked at Dean and back at where the Angel stood and was bewildered.
"Wonderful. At first, drab. But Dean made the trip worth it." Cas said. "Ellen, you're looking at a cook who may threaten to take your job in the kitchen." Cas warned playfully.
"Emma?" Dean asked. Emma then pulled away from Jacob.
"Emma?" Sam asked. "But I killed you."
"Oh, a fellow Scotsperson. I'm Muriel." Muriel said.
"Where are you?" Sam asked.
"I'm good." Adam said. "Michael and I were drinking a few glasses back at the bunker. Sam offered it to us."
..............................................................................................................................................................................................................................
"Great. Mom and Dad want us over for dinner some night." Dean said. "They'd also like us to host them."
"Sure, Mish." Dean said as he kissed Misha soft and chaste. They left Misha's trailer together and Dean got a call from Sam.
"I made a kidney pie with the kidneys of the lamb, and then I took the brain of the lamb and added it to the pie." Dean said. "I am a believer of using every edible part of the body." Dean walked away. Castiel dug in and he thoroughly enjoyed it. Lucifer, though hesitant, was pleased with his pie and so was Samandriel and Anna. Queen Naomi and King Charles, though disgusted that Dean had used lamb brain, didn't bring it up.
..............................................................................................................................................................................................................................
"Courage, this tree is even bigger and grander than the first tree you grew." Muriel said as she patted Courage on the head.
"You're like my Janet McKay, you know that?" Dean asked. "How you do it, I'll never know." Dean kissed Cas deeply before finishing his piece of maple bacon.
"It seems Father has the same idea, Brother." Michael confided.
"You mean you killed your dad?" Mary asked.
"I still need to watch that episode you referenced. What was it again?" Cas asked.
"Fine, let's just drive over there now." Ezekiel said, feeling defeated. He got in on the passenger side and Dean drove until he'd reached the address. Just as they stormed in though, they walked in on April about to seemingly stab Cas in the chest.
"Mmm, that beef roast smells better than the discovery of maple syrup." Dean said as he kissed Cas's neck and took a small tear of beef from the roast. "You taste like maple syrup too. working on a new bacon recipe?" Dean asked as he ate his small piece of roast.
Everyone accounted for?" Cas asked.
"Always the Animal husband." Dean said as he got up and kissed his fiancee on the lips.
"Yes, I'm Jack. I'm kinda God now, long story." Jack said. Meanwhile, Dean ran to his best friend to make sure he wasn't seeing things.
"Hi, we brought a flambeed plum dish." Sam said. "I thought we could use a healthy dessert as well as a cake and stuff that you two would be making." Sam explained to Mary and Dean.
"Dean, hi. We heard you'd moved to South Dakota." Karen said. "Is that Castiel? I heard you were getting married. Bobby, turn around to see Dean." Karen pulled Bobby to look behind him as he thought Dean was inside. Dean got out of the car and walked over.
"Well, cat's out of the bag." Gabriel said as he took down the simulation. "Nice to finally, formally meet you two. I'm Gabriel, the Archangel." Gabriel announced.
"I love you, Father." Dean called back and away he went to start a new life.
"So you sent one of your Nephilim to fetch BLTs for you and my best Knight of Hell to break it to him?" Crowley asked.
"Sure." Cas said.
"You don't need to do that, Mish. We can handle it." Dean said.
"Come on, man. We'll get you back home and into cleaner clothes. And Cas? Don't almost die on me again." Dean said as Cas nodded in agreement.
"Except she does hers a lot differently." Dean said.
"They always throw fears like that at new servants. I think it's barbaric myself, but you can't tell Father. Oh brother, you MUST try the rice porridge Dean makes." Samandriel said and Cas looked over into the kitchen.
"I don't have lube, but there's an apartment above the store I usually sleep the night in when I have big orders to fill most days." Dean said as Cas nodded. They gathered their clothes and Dean led him to the set of stairs, then he put up an "On break, come back at 5PM" sign. Then he quickly followed the older man to the apartment.
"Hey! Off the premises, pooch. Go on." The owner called out. But then he stopped when he realized it was a temporary Edsel from Miracle that she couldn't move and knelt down to her. "Oh I see, long morning? Alright, come on in, pal. Too much sun will overheat a dog faster than you can say Fricassee." The owner walked Miracle into the shop and got her some water, which she was grateful for. "You seem like a dog of discriminating taste. My nephew's been thinking we should start catering to dogs. Ah, you talked me into it, buddy." The owner then cooked a wagyu strip, laid it on a blueberry and rice pilaf and topped it with a peanut butter and beef broth bordelaise. Miracle ate it up like the vacuum on Teletubbies sucking up all the Tubby toast crumbs and Tubby custard when the Teletubbies make a mess. Even more grateful, she licked the owner's face once he had finished eating and was off again. "Take care, pupper." The owner said as he went in the back and called his nephew to let him know that the shop was now gonna be pet friendly.
"You're free to stay the night if you like, I think Emma took Claire and Jack to our house." Dean said.
"Not now, Mother." Crowley said. "How do we close this thing?" Suddenly though, the rift sucked Dean in, then immediately closed.
"They frustrate me so much though. Between Kelly's death after Jack was born and Father presumably-" Lucifer huffed out a breath as Castiel touched his arm.
"I hear you rule the underworld now." Shirley said.
"Hey, it's Miracle." One patron said. "Hey, buddy. Waiting for Cas? Funny, he went to see Dean for lunch at Gabriel's diner about an hour ago. Man, the paneer dish that his fiancee makes? Just sublime." The patron said.
"Sorry I'm late, just finished reading about women in white. Hey, Dad. Cas, did you make a beef roast?" Emma asked.
"Your own taste, dear? Or is it what your child thinks will make this taste good?" Ellen asked playfully.
"Oh, you know Meg. Great, nice to meet you, Dean. I'm gonna wash up and get some lunch." Michael said as Dean smiled.
"Thanks. It's actually my recipe for the filling. Dad makes the puff pastry for it and I fill it after also including a mushroom pate to make it earthier. Like a beef wellington with chicken and spinach as the replacement. And mushroom is rather fleshy in and of itself, so yeah." Emma said.
"I didn't go after that poltergeist so you could destroy your brother's trust in you. And I certainly didn't go after it so you could kill your niece or nephew, Samuel." Mary said. Now Sam was looking down. Just then, another surprise came for Mary.
"Great. I'll assume then that you'll be coming to the wedding then as a couple?" Dean asked.
"Thank you for the compliment. You know your eyes are really blue?" Dean asked as he suddenly grew closer to Castiel.
"MIRACLE!" Emma called and started to chase after her when Dale tightened his grip on Emma. "Let go of me, I'm responsible for her until we get home." She said, and was about to grip his wrist when suddenly, he chanted something in her ear and she was weaker than even before she killed Dean. "You're a witch." She wheezed.
..............................................................................................................................................................................................................................
"Yessir." Dean said with a grin. Meanwhile, Jo made floor measurements and Ash and Pamela got started on the sign on the building.
Glad you like so far, comments do help.
"Then Billie happened, and we confessed our feelings for each other. That was about two months ago." Cas said. But after that, Chuck's powers were absorbed into Jack. But then he gave some of that power to Amara so she could control all of Earth. And then we adopted Miracle." Cas said.
"Bobby and I are gonna be building a new house near yours. So we can be neighbors." Karen said.
"To my Blackbird with broken wings and sunken eyes. I promise I love you. You'll fly and see again. Forever yours, Dean." Cas read aloud and smiled as he put the blackbird in his pocket.
"I wouldn't if I were you, Kitsune." Emma said.
They all ate in silence once Emma had come back down. With the exception of Jack and Emma of course, who were whispering to each other in hushed tones.
"So I'm eyeing a gorgeous cherry red Chevy Bel-Air, and after I passed my classes for the year and got my license recently, it's definitely a beauty. What do you think, Miracle?" Emma showed Miracle. However, Miracle thought it was boring, the talk of cars and human problems concerning passing things. The second she saw the spacious grassy knoll in the dog park, she fought to pull away. "Jesus, girl. Wait for me to take off your leash so you can run to meet all your fellow canines." Emma said as she unhooked Miracle. Finally, she was free and ran to sniff the area. There, she met a group of dogs that also turned into Humans. A concept she'd never heard of before.
"Crowley gave me some time off. Thought I'd serenade you like I did after our first time." Dean smiled as he struggled a little. "Nervous, never serenaded anyone before. Not even my first love, Cassie. She was a reporter." Dean said. But enough about her, this is for you." He then began to play again and sang the first verse of "Change the world", Cas sitting down to listen as he contently sighed.
"I had antagonized Raphael through his vessel on my search for Father. I asked Dean for his help because there had been an angel sighting the night before. So he took me in his car to the town where Raphael's vessel at the time had been living in a hospital." Cas explained. "While we were waiting for Raphael to join us in a house where I was to trap him in holy oil, Dean asked what I was gonna do on what was possibly my last night on Earth. I told him I just wanted to sit quietly in my perch."
“I love you.” Castiel struggled as Dean began to cry angrily.
"Really? I'd love to try your food sometime, deary." Dean nodded at Ellen's words.
"I think I found where he may be." Ezekiel said as he soon felt Cas's presence having been at the diner. "The owner says his best waitress took pity on him and took him home to a nice homecooked meal and to clean him up. He's been to her house, so he gave me the address."
"Stupid Ref." Emma shouted as she pounded her hand on the coffee table, doing her best to remember she was super strong now.
“After years of the ‘No dogs in the Impala’ rule?” Dean asked. “I’m honored to own her.” Dean said. Cas smiled and kissed the dog before kissing Dean softly in turn.
Cas scent claims Dean and has Lucifer pack Dean's items to immediately leave.
"Thank you for the spoiler, dearie. Now get up. I assume if I'm dead in this future, so's Cassie? You were always kind of bitchy whenever you hadn't seen him." Balthazar said. Dean was going to give a quip, when he caught himself and looked directly at Balthazar.
"If we met sooner, I'd have instantly proposed the second we ate these PB&Js." Dean said. Misha blushed.
“I don’t know, he latched onto Cas when it happened.” Sam said.
"Do you have peanut butter?" Cas asked.
"Like father, like daughter." Cas said.
"Sam worries you're lying." Cas said.
"He's a really nice gift, Amara. Thank you." Cas said as he petted Airfry.
"No kiss for your big brother, Meg?" Thomas asked.
"I missed you too." Cas said. "I have a surprise for you." Cas then pulled out a box and Dean opened it to reveal it was the necklace, then Dean felt in his jacket pocket to feel nothing inside. Then he took a second look at the necklace to see there were gems inside it now.
..............................................................................................................................................................................................................................
"Chuck fried him, Amara gave Jack a new body untouched by Demons and let Belphegor keep the old body." Cas explained.
"Dad, thank God." Emma said.
Once again, Michael's sword had worked its' way into Castiel's hands. Even if Castiel didn't want it to be in his hands, it still found it's way to him. Before Michael could discover what had happened though, the sword began merging itself with Castiel's Grace, spinning it into its' powerful glint like a cotton candy machine. Gabriel walked in to check on Castiel as he hadn't heard from him in some time when he watched the merge. Once it had finished and Castiel collapsed to the floor, he gasped. Gabriel ran over.
"He healed me with a single touch." Cas said as Dean nodded. "And after?" Dean gulped when Cas asked.
"Wow, I didn't know you were interested." Jensen said. "What about Vicki and the baby and Dee?"
..............................................................................................................................................................................................................................

"Same. Ash and I have a LOT in common and also, my eyesight's back. So all in all? Life's good again." Pamela said.
"Hiya, Castiel." Gabriel said as Castiel frowned.
"He's gonna save him." Samandriel whispered to Anna.
"Courage says that's Shirley the Medium. She's helped Eustace and Muriel in the past." Jack said.
"Wait, did you say Amy Pond?" Dean asked.
"The Stupid one's wife and her dog. I must warn them." She said as she ran to the farmhouse.
"I promise to put in all of my effort into my work, sire." Dean said as King Charles squinted.
"Hey, I got you. What happened to your version of Cas is not gonna happen to me." Misha said. And then Dean flashed back to when Misha was killed the first time he was here and he suddenly pulled Misha into his arms before kissing the older man deeply. Misha thought about pulling back, but then decided against it. Meanwhile, the Angel Raphael sent to kill Sam and Dean had found where Balthazar had sent them, and he was ready for blood.
"We're doing this on the couch, huh? We haven't even eaten yet. Honey baked ribeye roast for dinner tonight." Cas said.
"Dean!" Sam called out.
“Goodbye, Dean.” Cas started as the Empty began to pour in.
"How's your potion coming, Mother?" Crowley asked as Rowena was making a spell for mass torture of unruly demons.
"I've brought you the blood of a Demon's vessel. He was breaking contracts before they were due with "loopholes". Was even gonna do a poor Wincestie named Becky dirty by selling her a potion that brainwashed Sam into falling love with her. I took care of that guy and don't worry, I've asked Crowley for his blood. I'll owe him a favor when I get back to my timepoint." Dean explained.
"I'm glad you're here, it gets boring around here when you and Lucifer aren't here. But the new servant is my favorite so far. He cleans efficiently. Sometimes I offer to help, but I forget myself and he asks me to leave to my chambers so he could reclean what I dirtied up again." Samandriel sighed. "He did a great job his first day too. But according to Duma, Father threatened that if Dean didn't, he'd send him to Prince Azazel."
"Wow." Cas said with a giggle when he came down from the adrenaline. Dean chuckled too and kissed his fiancee deeply.
"Emma. That French Poodle yours?" Emma responded.
Dean and Cas were then working at the Gas n' Sip. And they were living in a nice efficiency with a kitchenette and Dean used it to cook wholeheartedly.
..............................................................................................................................................................................................................................
"I've always wanted to lead an army. But only as long as it's under my terms." Dean said.
"Jen, you're adlibbing again." Misha said.
"Not at all. As long as you didn't get a vasectomy." Karen said and Bobby decided first thing he was gonna make sure he had swimmers.
"WHAT?!" Michael yelped. "How DARE you?!" Michael roared as he smashed Castiel into a wall and then called Raphael. Once he had taken Castiel to get ripped a new one literally, Michael punched a wall and went to hide his sword.
"Bollucks" Crowley and Rowena said in unison as they looked at each other.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Right, I forgot. Hello, Lucifer. You got any ideas for beating Chuck?” Sam asked.
"OOH! Look, Daddy. Scones. Looks like they're chocolate chip too. Can I get one, Daddy?" A little boy, looking about 3 years old, asked excitedly.
"So who are they again?" Jess asked. Sam was still catching her up on what she had missed over the last 15 years since Brady killed her.
"Thanks for the double date." Cas said. "And Michael, I'm sorry I molotoved you with holy fire and called you an assbutt." Cas said.
"Not so fast, my dog just got mounted." Dale said.
“Pranks and teasing.” Dean confirmed. “Hot dogs are up.” Dean said as he put them on a plate after cooking them on a grill. Miracle whined as she smelled the hot dogs and Dean threw one to the dog. “There you go, Miracle.” He said.
Dean accidentally gets sucked back into mid 2011 and begins to right the wrongs made the night Cas became God for 48 hours.
"Cassie, he's not worth it. Come on, we're leaving early. Dean, I got everything you have left, I can't save the stuffing remains of your horse, though. I'm sorry." Lucifer comforted Dean and he nodded. Castiel walked Dean out and took Dean's things from Lucifer. Just as they were walking out though, Lucifer smacked Naomi hard. "That's for being a cold heartless bitch to my future brother-in-law and this!" He punched her chin. "Is for his stuffed animal. Now wear your damage along with mine." He then threw the remains of Impi into Naomi's face. "You have a GREAT taste in women, Chuck." Lucifer quipped one last time before walking Cas and Dean to the horses before heading home.
"Thanks." Emma said as she walked upstairs with Dean to her new room.
"Stubborn, irrational, selfish, swindles." Shirley said.
"You're gorgeous, Castiel. The first time you came to me in that barn? There was something powerfully beautiful as you entered, intimidating and badass. And the way you introduced yourself to me, your words to describe how you pulled me out of Hell. I felt in awe. But then I had to ruin it by stabbing you." Dean said as he stretched Cas out. "I regret always being angry when you do stuff you shouldn't. The reason I do though is because I view you as this perfect being that can do no wrong. Sure you've lied to me in the past, but it doesn't stop me from feeling all of that." He put his unused hand on Cas's right cheek and started stroking it. "I love you. I love you so much, Cas." Dean then began to kiss Cas again and held him close to his chest.
"Crashing in Jensen's trailer with Misha." Dean said. Sam fumed, but suddenly dropped his phone when Gen came into their bedroom in a gorgeous negligee.
“Oh, yeah. Sorry, Amara didn’t have time to let us dress before the deal to take Lucifer in our stead was taken by the Empty.” Cas said as he zipped himself up, Dean following suit.
"I'll explain it when you're older." Bobby said as he handed Sam his flask to sip some rutgut. Sam just sipped the rutgut and watched as his brother locked lips with the new God.
"Mmm, tastes stringy." Cas said.
When Sam and Jess had left, Cas was cleaning up and putting food away. Dean had decided to help after cleaning the grill. However, his help was beyond drying while Cas washed.
"Mmph, good morning, Miracle. How'd you sleep?" Dean asked as he and Miracle shared a hug before Dean too smelled bacon. "Mmm, smells like Daddy's making bacon. Either him or Emma. C'mon, let's find out." Dean said as he got out of bed, Miracle following suit. Together, they went downstairs and walked through the living room into the kitchen to see Emma cooking bacon, sausage and making French toast.
"You mean...it chooses life partners for your family?" Claire asked.
"Mornin', Dad, Miracle." Emma addressed. "Cas is collecting some honey from the garden and he asked me to start making breakfast." Emma said as she gave a cooled down piece to Miracle. She munched on the bacon and licked hier teeth once she'd finished her piece.
"Lay off it, Dean. I know you spent some time with Castiel. I'm not gonna risk getting killed by you by killing your sodding boyfriend. But next time, if you want to get away for a while? Just say so instead of trying to wreck my reputation as the King of Hell, will you?" Crowley sighed.
"I am." Cas nodded. "But Future you reassured me that the Leviathans are completely gone from my body. They affected me the first time I went overboard with my powers." Cas promised.
"She's a tough girl, my Joanna. Prince Castiel promises to make her a Knight when he becomes King." Ellen said as she gave Dean some porridge. "Here, love. Have some porridge. It'll give you back some energy." Ellen offered. Dean took the bowl and started eating it slowly, but then started happy crying at how good it tastes. Kali started comforting Dean.
"Mmm, I can taste the seasonings you use. And I also detect a hint of vinegar?" Jack asked.
"I see. But you get to play catch-up with your daddy while I'll never get to see my mother's face as I graduate high school, or play my first game of soccer in school, win my first spelling bee. You get to learn how to change oil and maintain a car in general. I don't get ANY of that with my mom. Is that fair, Amazon?" Jacob knelt down in a fuming rage, then pounded his fists to the floor. Dean went to comfort him, but Emma gave him the universal gesture for "Back off!", and Dean did just that.
"Actually, it's just me now." Jack said.
"Thank you for your offer, Samandriel. But I must do this alone." Dean said to the young Prince.
"Hey, babe?" Dean called out to Cas as he was cleaning the attic. "Ash Harvelle just reached out to me. I'm gonna go help rebuild his and his family's roadhouse." Dean finished.
“Yes.” Cas said as Dean took the ring out of the box and put it on Cas’s hand, then they kissed deeply. They then spent the rest of the night celebrating in a lot of ways. Not only their engagement, but the start of what’s to come in their future.
"We should be done by the end of August, I thought we would try September 18th, since that's the day we met." Dean said.
"I was so excited for her to see it, I just wanted to drive all the way here in her. Ain't she pretty?" Garth asked. Dean just shook his head and laughed to himself. Same old Garth, even if he was a werewolf now. Just then though, Emma came out.
"There was no rational thought when my fiancee's toy was shredded by your wife, Father." Castiel scolded.
"I wouldn't really say he looks like Michael Buble, but yeah. That's him. Big dopey smile and beautiful green eyes. 6'1"." Cas said.
"In a barn. It was a misunderstanding. He thought I was a Demon who sent him back to Earth just to screw with him." Cas started. "In actuality, I had raised him from Hell, gripping him tight and making sure I had grabbed all of him. But in doing so, I had repaired him and in that, I guess my doubts that I was doing the right thing started when I first touched him." Cas blissed out with the memory.
Dean pushed Cas onto his bed once the door was locked. Then he went to cut a couple pats of butter and covered Cas's dick with it, making the older man gasp. "Butter?" Cas asked.
"Hey, l'il lady." One Skinwalker, as they called themselves, said to her. "Name's Shadow. You're definitely not a Skinwalker, so we're gonna call you Slick due to you being new. Wanna play with us?" Shadow asked. Miracle obliged until she met a Familiar. Meanwhile, said Familiar's owner sat down next to Emma to monitor her, keeping an even closer eye on Miracle. But not before striking an introduction to Emma.
He was aching, stiff and sore.
“It is entirely too early in our courtship to be mentioning the ‘M word’,” Dean almost snorted when Cas brought out the air quotes. Almost, if the mention of mates hadnt been brought up. That was a heavy topic, one he was glad Cas knew the importance of. “However, I feel it prudent to mention that I would like to have that conversation in the not too distant future.”
much stuff, didn’t Sam say he had stuff for us too?” Dean frowned at the sheer amount of kids' stuff in their cart. Cas rolled his eyes with a huff.
“I miss you so much, you son of a bitch. I hope you know that.”
No matter what people said about heats, it didn’t make omegas go out of their mind with lust. That was just alpha perpetuated bull shit. No, omegas were in complete control during the three times a year they were super fertile, it was the
It didn’t work.
“Kiss me,” Whatever he was going to say next was swept away in the full force of Cas’ lips on his, fast, tender kisses that left him feeling strung out, raw and so, so loved.
“Is he – was he ok?” Dean hoped he was, no one deserved that, especially someone who clearly wanted to open their mind to others views and thoughts. There should be more of it in the school. Chuck answered around a mouthful, spiting burger everywhere.
They had their routine, Cas always asked if Dean was ok to start, but knew the omega would let him know if he wanted them to stop. Deans gasps and groans were his way of saying slow down or speed up.
Or to hold him through his chest heaving, convulsive gasps.
“Are you guys done yet?” Chuck appeared from the ‘bathroom’ or where ever he’d been, smiling evilly. He had never known Chuck to be so devious, and he was actually quite worried. “Good, I’m gonna invite him over again, that all good?” Dean just nodded, because whatever happened, it was better to go
“Uh, yeah, we’ve been talking for like, a week?” Dean's date imposter had to be lying because no.
“Oh, Dean, we’re just getting started.”
Dean, and there he was, frightening him. That wouldn’t do at all. He gathered what strength he had left, leaning against the guard rail of the bridge in the hopes of some support, and gave it one last go.
“We just wanted you to know, little one, just how much both your fathers love you.” The alpha sounded devastated, the hollow resonance of his voice betraying what Dean knew he felt inside. “We love you, so so much.” Fuck anyone that said a baby wasn’t a baby until a certain time. Dean loved his little bean as soon as he realised he was pregnant. It was a little bit of him, and a little bit of his mate. It was meant to be nestled inside him until he could deliver it safely into the world, but those fucking
“Thank you. I'd very much like to see yours as well, if you'll allow it.”
Dean wiped the sweat off his brow, tensing as another surge of nausea threatened to overwhelm him. He thought the fish the night before had looked suspicious. He closed his eyes and leaned heavily against the tree that was holding him up.
“It’s perfect.”
“I didn’t mean to start bawling today. It’s the – the damn hormones. I’m up one minute, down the next. It’s crazy.” Dean laughed along with Benny, who stood and clasped Dean’s shoulder.
When he met Dean, he hadn’t thought he could ever love someone so fiercely as he did the omega. Dean Winchester was sharp, independent, and beautiful. He was everything Castiel could have ever dreamed of in a mate. When Dean had told him, crying and bleeding on the beach, that he was losing their pup… it was as if something broke lose inside him, ricocheting around his throbbing heart, piercing it indiscriminately. Some feral alpha instinct filled him, screaming at him to find those that had hurt his mate, and erase their very existence from the earth.
Thank you so much for the comments and kudos, please continue, because i love them!

Dean didn’t bother replying, he just set his phone to silent and put it back in his pocket. Enjoying what was left of their date was more important than having a go at his brother. He’d only been trying to help after all.

“Holy shit, what the hell dude.” Dean laughed giddily as Cas mouthed wetly at his neck, which quickly morphed into a moan when he felt Cas hard and insistent against his thigh.

made him shiver for so many other reasons, despite the stench around him.
“Dude, it’s gonna be fine. We’ll talk to him and that’s it.” Dean didn’t even know why they were hanging around; they could have just made a run for it as soon as he’d left.
“Go to hell, Winchester.” Gabriel’s threat was weak, considering he had slumped over a log while bringing up the entire contents of his stomach. Apparently, Gabriel was sick of fish too. Dean was going to fix that, with Sam’s help. They had rigged up some snares around their camp and further into the bush. Hopefully they would be able to catch some small wild game like rabbits or something. He’d scope the island for bigger game after his heat hit. Since it was so close, his hormones were screaming at him to stay close to his home, which turned out to be the cave.
but it was certainly on Dean’s mind. What else was there to think about, really? They had food, fire and didn’t have any way to reach the outside world. So… there wasn’t much else to think about.
Cas kissed the soft flesh under and around Deans belly button. The omega blushed, and tried to push Cas’ exploratory lips away. He wasn’t in his prime anymore, his body had soft edges, bits and pieces he wasn’t especially proud of. Cas though, seemed to like them
The omega tipped his head back and opened his mouth, a mournful howl escaping his lips in a shuddering resonance. Cas joined him, matching his pain and loss. Every part of their suffering was echoing around them, a promise to those who had wronged them that they would pay, that there would be
Dean just hoped Sam knew what he was doing.
Staring at the picture on the opposite bedside table, he couldn’t help the tightening of his chest, nor the burning behind his eyes. All the disappointment from meeting Cas and being ultimately rejected was bringing everything to the surface, and when the first wet gasp of sadness escaped he just let it happen.
Dean splashed some cold water on his face, and on the back of his neck. It made him feel infinitely better, which was great because he had class in –

a teenager, and he didn’t care what the others thought.
The last time Cas had seemed to die, that moment when the angels fell.
The weeks flew by, and Dean couldn’t wipe the smile off his face. His teachers even noticed an improvement in his attitude, they even sent a letter home to his parents congratulating them on good parenting.

The insecurities lasted all the way through Cas slowly stripping them both of their clothes, and steering Dean towards the bed. He had no idea what he was doing, and he still didn’t understand why Cas was so nervous before, but so confident in his movements
“You know, if this was one of those steamy romance stories you’re always reading, your magical alpha cock would have healed my broken body by now.”
Cas growling his name had to be the hottest thing he’d ever heard. He was quickly slicking up, despite the gnawing hunger in his belly.
Dean sat up, as far as he could with his seat belt pinning him to the slashed leather that used to be a seat. He fumbled for the clicker, and gasped when it released him. His head hurt like a mother

“What’s wrong with wanting something more than a casual fling?” Despite himself, Dean was a bit hurt. Yeah he was hot, he was self aware enough to know that, but that didn’t mean he was a simple minded vessel for other people to get their jollies off with and then leave.
When he finally stopped ejaculating, spent cock laying heavy and unsatisfied between his legs, he didn’t bother holding back his tears any longer.
“A feisty one, I like that.” He bared his teeth, snapping them at the omega. Dean’s breath was harsh and fast, but he kept his eyes on the tall, ugly alpha, because he was the boss. Everything about him was awful. From his scent, the acidic, dank smell of fuck knows what, to the way his eyes flickered between red and was that fucking

“It’s a really nice song, I have to agree.” Cas smiled and looked so damn sincere that Dean found himself trusting his new friend even more than he thought possible. It was like he’d known him forever, but he got to get to know him all over again.
“Oh I’ll make you work for it, alright.” Cas growled deeply behind him,
"And how'd Lucifer get there?" Dean asked.
"So if Lucifer's your biodad, why do you call Castiel your real father?"
Just before Jane came with lunch, Dean and Cas were maintaining Baby's health together-Dean asking for what was needed, Cas handing him stuff and occasionally learning about car maintenance-when Crowley swooped in. "Castiel, have you not told him yet?" Crowley asked.
"Good thing Cas and I haven't eaten yet." Dean said when he remembered seeing Michael possess his father last. Though that was the year Mary had found out Dean was coming, but still. "Does Dad know you copied him from when he was young in '78?" Dean asked.
"I could never say no to you, Dean." Garth said as they went inside. All the while, Miracle slept on her bed on the corner of Dean's side of the bed, dreaming of her exciting day of the butcher, Claire chasing her and Gabriel's dog Sparky falling for her. She was just glad to be home regardless of the good parts of the day. She was most especially glad Emma was safe.
..............................................................................................................................................................................................................................
“Why?” Jack asked.
"Winchester Auto Restoration, Dean speaking. Oh hi, Garth. You got a lead on a '57 Bel-Air for Emma? That's great, dude. Come on by next week and we'll get started on working on her." Dean said as he was working on a Thunderbird for a client. Meanwhile, Kaia and Claire, who had just decided to work for Dean, shooed Miracle away thinking he was a stray.
"I found a compromise the Entity liked." Jack said as he came in. "Remember Naomi?"
"Darn you and your stage hearing, brother." Samandriel huffed at Cas.
"Hi, are you the man who designed the honey bee engagement ring my fiancee made for me? His name's Dean Winchester." Cas asked.
"Officially, you mean?" Cas asked.
"I didn't do anything." Dean said.
..............................................................................................................................................................................................................................
"I've been stubborn and pigheaded." Dean said as he nuzzled his fiancee's neck.
..............................................................................................................................................................................................................................
"Dean?" Sam called out. "DEAN!"
"John, calm down." Mary said. "It's nice to meet you, Adam. Come join us."
"He knew?" Sam asked.
They were in for a long talk. A very long, very disappointed talk.
“Dean, why so sappy today?” Cas asked when they took a break.
Dean nodded understandably. Just then, Shirley walked into the kitchen and sat down.
"The name is in it's action. Wish for something, Samuel." Rowena said and Sam did exactly that.
"Job or not, it hinders the Chiefs winning." Dean said. Cas shook his head. This was gonna be his new normal, but he'd take it no other way. Even if his future stepdaughter was a bit of a psycho when angry.
"Eh eh eh, pal. You are gonna scry for my dad's dog, so I can find Miracle and make sure my dad and Cas don't know I left her to her devices. Or I'm gonna send my boyfriend to eat you." Emma said as she pressed a knife to his neck.
The End
The End
"Yes, sir." Dean said.
"How are you able to tell?" Dean asked.
"The black-haired dude, bowlegged and kinda looks like Michael Buble?" The jeweler asked. Cas nodded.
"I do, and I couldn't be happier or mellower." Rowena said.
"Mom and Pop are starting the rebuilding process as we speak. You don't need to help though." Ash said.
"A couple hours ago, Miracle sniffed out this adorable, delicate furball while I was walking him. Miracle licked her and lied down, as if he was keeping her warm. I told him to leave her alone because I was allergic. But I want to adopt her because you said once you always wanted a cat. Castiel, meet Celestial." Dean said as he handed the little kitten to his now fiancee. Cas happy cried as he held the beautiful little kitten in his arms and looked up at Dean.
"Steve. And this..." He began as Dean came in to pay for gas. "...is my friend Dean. We're looking for a place for a while." Cas said.
Once everyone was settled and Celestial and Miracle were in their separate beds, Dean began to kiss and nibble on Cas while Sam called Mary about the engagement.
"I don't mind at all." Dean said as he took a bite and he felt an orgasm. "Oh my god, this is delicious." Dean groaned.
"Okay, so how do we get back?" Sam asked.
"Cas? You're here? I mean you're alive." Dean rubbed his eyes and pinched himself, making sure he wasn't dreaming. "I-no. A Djinn has to have snuck in-" Cas cut Dean off by holding his face.

"Let's not get too hasty, Dean." Ezekiel said.
"Yes, I'm from the past and I just found out I died. I think if you go back, you can convince Sam to do something for you." Balthazar said as suddenly, he performed the spell that sent Dean into that world where he was Jensen Ackles, but right back to the very beginning when he first entered with Sam all those years ago.
Back at Dale's lair, he was conjuring a spell. Giselle was watching over Emma, checking her blood.
"If you don't mind, I don't want to impose." Cas said.
They made it to the entrance to Thunderlief's stables by morning and Cas was greeted by Garth.
"I certainly can do that." The jeweler said exasperatedly. "I guess I won't need to worry about paying for the materials."
"Ooh, even the baby's starting to feel the tension in the room, I'm gonna go into another room." Jess said as she took a couple plums and some healthy helpings of meatloaf and beef roast.
"Oh hey, Miracle. Where's your collar and leash? Bah, I won't rat Emma out if you don't. Meantime, I want you to be my guinea pig for my new promotion: Dog day Afternoons. Dogs eat free daily from Noon-3PM. Kali and I made a coconut lamb and shrimp stew with rice and zested Bhuda's hand." Gabriel said as he gave Miracle a bowl of the meal in question. While scarfing it, Gabriel's dog that he conjured the first time he'd met Sam and Dean came over and proceeded to talk to Miracle. All while Dean and Cas were sitting in the window booth a couple tables over from the door.
"Come by tomorrow and we can start writing the recipes together and trade." Cas said.
..............................................................................................................................................................................................................................
"This is Courage." Muriel said. "Any new friend of Courage's is a friend of mine. Come, I'll serve you a slice of pie." Muriel offered and Jack followed into the kitchen, then was intrigued by the dog food.
"I'm not allowed to eat what I cook despite my being the chef. Can't even test taste it or I'm a thief, and I'm gonna be sent off to marry Prince Azazel." Dean sighed. "Otherwise, I'm given lobsters."
"Hey, buddy. I thought you'd like to do a road trip. Just like the one we went on to interrogate Raphael." Dean said.
Dude, what the hell?" Sam asked.
"Left, then right. Stay true after." Sam said. Dean drove those directions and just about stopped when they got to the farmhouse.
"Have you forgotten I'm here?" Metatron asked. Dean took the blunt end of the first blade and smacked Metatron.
"Pretty much, yeah. That's what Castiel figures." Jimmy said as he drank some gravy. "Mmm, damn good gravy."
"Is she fixed?" Dale asked.
"He did. What of it?" Emma asked.
"You can say that." Cas said as he helped Dean off of Blade. "Garth, I'd like you to meet my betrothed, Dean of Winchester."
“He thinks everything I do is amazing. He makes his own jelly though.” Dean said. “I’m telling you, ever since Cas has been able to taste? His pallet makes me purr.” Dean said as he kissed Cas deep, but chaste.
"Michael and I had become attached to each other over the thousand years we were in Hell." Adam said. "Lucifer was torturing Sam's soul quite a lot. Though Michael had partaken in it." Adam bowed his head down slowly.
"You stole my best li-hyena." Dean shouted when Cas breached further into him with his fingers, now using three. Dean threw his head back as Cas began to pepper kisses onto the baker's neck, nipping into his clavicle before reaching to put his chin on Dean's shoulder.
“You make me blush.” Cas said as he touched Dean’s forehead with his own.
"CAS!" Dean cried out as Castiel turned to face Dean with a small smile.
"Oh good, you're back. How was Tombstone?" Crowley asked. "And you seem to forget, Dean that I then double-crossed him in favor of Raphael."
"Oh, I see. Well I'll fight to keep you from getting dead again." Emma promised. "But first, I MUST finish that Nomad. I hope the owner of the Nomad likes Home Improvement."
"As did Lilith's personal chef. Believe me, I didn't want to drain her meatsuit. She was pregnant. But I had to follow orders. Get you to drain all the demons associated with Lilith and get your powers to full battery life so you could kill Lilith." Ruby said.
"I thought it would go better with the pizza today." Dean said and Misha smiled. "So, how's Vicki? She tired?"
When Cas woke up the next morning, Dean was gone. Cas thought he had an early morning with Crowley and decided to get out of bed and get dressed when Dean came in.
"Hello." Misha started, in his Cas voice. Dean sighed heavily as he heard Misha use his Cas voice. But he held it together. They went at the scene until they got to Cas telling Dean the moment of truth.
"It's the best shot we have though, Jack." Dean said. "Ruby, lead the way. Sam? Go with her. She's obviously remorseful for what happened." Sam begrudgingly went with Ruby as they, Dean, Cas, Jack and Courage went to see the second witness rising.
"OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOH! I don't like this. That sounded too much like a plain old rainstorm or my name is Jensen. And it's NOT!" Courage said. Miracle licked his cheek and Courage smiled sadly at him. Just then, a knock came at the front door and Dean got it, revealing Jack.
"Is it inevitable? Can she be saved if we stop this?" Dean asked.
"The blond's our half-brother, Adam. We found out about him after he and his mother were murdered by a brother and sister pair of Ghouls. Our dad ganked their father the year Adam was conceived and Sam and I bonded with the Ghoul who pretended to be Adam as part of a ruse." Dean said.
..............................................................................................................................................................................................................................
"Hi, I'm Emma. Thank you so much for the car. How'd you know I was in the market for a Bel-Air?" Emma asked.
"I see that." Dean said. Cas watched confused.
Dean was sat on a horse, his bags carried on it. "Dean, so you never forget who your mother was, your mother wanted you to wear her pendant. Keep it hidden under your shirt." Lord John said as he put the chain around his son's neck. "If we weren't in this situation, I would never have sold you." The older man said.
"Thank God in deed, I was afraid you weren't gonna survive." Cas said as they kissed, then they looked at Emma.
"You didn't do a lot of research about me." Misha said as Dean blushed. "I was in a movie called Karla with Laura Prepon in 2005. Three years before I worked on the show. I played Paul Bernardo, the Scarsbourough Rapist and later the hands-on half of the Ken and Barbie killers. Together they killed three women. The only vic to escape actually called me thinking she'd have some sort of cathartic epiphany if we talked on the phone. Pretty humbling experience. Also, it was Adrenaline-pumping just to play a serial rapist and murderer who would film his escapades with his wife by his side. They've since divorced and she got out some time later." Misha explained.
..............................................................................................................................................................................................................................
"So if Dean's your dad, why do you call Mary Aunt Mary instead of Grandma?" Jack asked.
"I apologize for Lucifer's frivolity. He's rather eligible these days." Castiel said as he politely pushed Lucifer away from the younger man. Dean offered them a cracker with fois gras on it that he had made.
..............................................................................................................................................................................................................................
"She went to find the spell to undo the witness rising. Cas went to help her." Sam said.
"Yes, I felt that disturbance. Which was why I sent the phantom of Widow MacPherson to punish him for his crimes. But she was so confused. The poor dear was never the same after Grazelda killed her husband. Even after I killed Grazelda. We don't just go throwing women's husbands into Loch Ness to feed Nessie just because they're not interested in them. So I cast a wee spell on her that turned her into a log of mushrooms. Fergus then ate her and that was the end of that." Rowena said.
..............................................................................................................................................................................................................................
"We'll find her, we'll find where they took her, boy." Jack assured the dog.
"Mr. Winchester?" A young adult voice called as he walked in.
"What the hell?" Sam said as he looked over to Dean, who pretended to blend in as Jens.
"Mmm, no bacon?" Cas asked.
"I see. Come, Dean. You look starved. Come have some porridge for breakfast. Ellen is the best cook in the estate. Second only to Kali, but only because I'm crazy about her." Gabriel said as he walked Dean into the estate.
"I do too, Dean. I think the Entity feels that." Jack said as he nodded along.
"Oh. My. God." Claire said as she blocked Jack's sight from seeing his daddy wrestling with Emma's.
"Careful, dude. That money's not just yours." Dean said. "Does Gen know?"
A few weeks would go by when Dean would be used to being treated like an untouchable in the East Indies. He was cleaning, doing laundry, not fed very well though. However, they trusted him enough to allow him one thing he loved to do for his family: He was allowed to cook.
"My dear, Shirley. Last time I saw you, you were a wee pup learning from your Gypsy ancestors. How strong be your powers now?" Rowena asked.
"DEAN!" Sam screamed. "Damn it. What did he mean by that?" He asked Cas.
Dean's sold to King Charles after he presents Omega and he's taken to the Palace to be a servant.
..............................................................................................................................................................................................................................
"I see, and that's where you think you can get it?" Crowley asked. "And you plan to get it back for your loverboy?" Crowley provoked. He couldn't help but do so, it was ridiculous. Dean damn near pulled out the first blade and pointed it at Crowley's chin.
..............................................................................................................................................................................................................................
"My mom taught me how to by using pie crust once upon a time." Dean said. Castiel smiled. Suddenly though, King Charles started walking over to them.
"You really are Dean Winchester." Misha said. "And all that you've told me is real." All Dean could do was nod.
"I see. And Amara is?" John asked.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Dean still cares about you, even if he's a Demon?" Sam sat down.
Last chapter might be next chapter.
"Yeah, but I don't know. Something's off." Dean said. Dean went to use the restroom when he saw a dog that looked just like Miracle talking to Gabriel's dog.
"Cas and I, our profound bond strengthened when I became a Knight of Hell. Don't say you're gonna find a way to cure me. I'm still me. Crowley, tell them my rules and conditions to being a Knight of Hell and Demon in general." Dean said.
"Still smarmy, Meg." Dean said.
Dinner was killer. Cas found that Dean was skilled with his cooking. Though he felt that knowledge already when he tasted Dean's orderves. "So where does Dean eat?" Cas asked.
"Sam told me about the house. I'm expecting you to invite us to dinner some night. Or at least we are officially inviting you." John said.
"Looking for this?" Giselle asked. Emma scowled at her.
Shirley makes it to the house just as something sinister occurs.
When they returned, 2011 Dean hugged Cas tightly.
Once they were home after that dinner experience, Dean looked out through the windshield and saw Bobby and Karen were alive.
"Easy there, Tiger. If you were that easily affected by my pie, you should probably have a pasty like your niece. Also complimentary." Dean offered once the pasties were done. Cas took a bite and he was in awe.
"We found Miracle shortly after the incident." Dean admitted. "She needed a new home after everyone left. But then Chuck disappeared her and then Jack and Amara absorbed his powers and she and Jack merged into each other to become the new God.
"Hannah's bringing in Metatron. She said he's finally willing to let us know where my grace is." Cas said.
"Then why are you talking to us?" Sam asked.
"Hold on, I'm not decent." Dean said as he remade his uniform and walked over to let Cas in.
..............................................................................................................................................................................................................................
"It takes time for potions like these, Fergus. I told you that when you were a wee lad, curious about my work. And is Dean back from his date yet?" Rowena asked.
chest, beating in sync in each other's palms as Dean felt Cas's heartbeat.
"I like to try and stay humble in those matters though, Lucifer. But thank you." Cas said. Dean felt a lot better as they reached Thunderlief estate.
"Real good nonetheless, Mrs. Bagge." Jack said.
"If he stabbed Cas in the stomach where the Leviathans were, I think he knew exactly what we didn't yet." Crowley said. "That Demon looked a lot like you though, Dean. Like you three years from now." Dean contemplated that for a while.
..............................................................................................................................................................................................................................
..............................................................................................................................................................................................................................
"Rowena MacLeod, a pleasure. Are you the one who grew the wish tree outside?" Rowena asked.
"Because I like you." Gabriel said. "And I especially like Dean. But even more, I love my baby brother. I didn't just leave because I didn't want to watch Michael and Lucifer tear themselves, and in turn Earth, apart. I left because I couldn't watch as Raphael and Michael kept ripping Castiel apart. He needs you, Dean. Just as Lucifer needs his sword. Hell, just as he'll need Sam. I've seen moments where swords make great partners for their wielders. In this case, you and Castiel, Dean." Gabriel said in a genuinely sincere tone.
"Sure." Dean said as he pushed Cas down on the couch and Cas undid Dean's shirt and pants before Dean undid Cas's pants. Dean sucked his own fingers and used them to finger Cas as Cas rolled his eyes. Dean nibbled Cas's neck as Cas slowly stroked Dean's dick. As soon as Dean felt Cas was well stretched out, he entered his lover and they clung to each other. The rocking motion that Dean controlled as he thrust into the love of his life got Cas's eyes to glow. Dean kissed up Cas's jaw and brushed his lips against Cas's ear.
..............................................................................................................................................................................................................................
"I don't think so, Castiel." Raphael said. "I'm working with Crowley now."
"Shut up." Dean said as they went back into the trailer.
“Are you willing to trade?” Amara asked.
"Let it go, Fergus. So Castiel's the new lead of Heaven. No skin off our noses. Besides, he's promised not to nuke Hell." Rowena reasoned. Suddenly, Cas came in.
"My Queen." Dale got down on one knee. "You know this Amazon?" Rowena began to maniacally laugh.
"Have you got your powers now?" Jacob asked.
"I don't like the idea of this." Courage said.
"No, no. I understand. I gotta move on. Dean needs to too, even if he is a Knight of Hell now. We both know that." Sam nodded and went to working on research.
"I'm gonna make you come so hard, the eastern seaboard will hear you." Cas husked into Dean's ear, making Dean swallow harder than when Lydia had told him Emma was "his problem now", her words. Cas then and there, turned the tables and started slamming into Dean after pulling out his fingers. Dean gasped and started making small grunting sounds, while Cas explored his body with his hands. Dean did the same, roaming them in Cas's hair, his back, he dipped a still-butter-coated finger into Cas's asshole and it made Cas roar with pleasure. He then began thrusting even harder, making Dean make even more noise. It wasn't long before they both climaxed, Cas buried so deep into Dean, he screamed louder than the time he got scared after a cat popped up out of nowhere. Cas pulled out once he had come and they lay together after.
"Crowley will come looking for me. Or he'll send a goon. I must protect you." Dean said as he got up slowly to get dressed.
"Dean, what would you consider to be the best meal to serve the Crown prince and one of our brothers?" Anna asked one morning when she was serving herself some rice porridge that Dean had cooked up fresh.
"You know me so well when it comes to detecting spice." Cas said as he kissed him. He always felt a little bit worn out after sex, even in the Empty. It was meat that always replenished his grace faster. Speaking of, Cas looked up at Dean's necklace and he gasped, eyes widening. "Dean, your necklace. Look down, it's glowing." Cas pointed and Dean looked down to see that his necklace was indeed glowing.
They make it to Thunderlief and Cas introduces Dean to the Betas and Alphas.
"He put the blade in my hand after I died. He told me that Cain had to die to become the first Demon. The mark, when combined with the blade, will turn a dying or dead man into a Demon from scratch." Dean explained.
"What'd I do?" Dean asked.
"Let's cross that bridge when we get there." Misha said as he walked Jensen to his trailer to cuddle and talk.
“Dad, I see you’re in Cas’s form.” Jack noted.
"So Dean, I hear you accepted a version of me from a universe where you and Sam were never born." Michael said.
"Ow, ow." Cas said as Dean flashed his eyes back to green, then ran back over towards Cas, who was now on the floor.
"I'm gonna give him a sweet dream, a lucid dream, make him think the two of you were mating." The Djinn, Barbara said as she pumped Cas with a good fantasy of April all over him.
"You're right. So let's start with Red Velvet." Dean said as he kissed Cas's hand. Just then, Jack came down.
"Why?" Castiel asked.
"I'll get something." Dean whispered to himself. Suddenly, he heard a knock on the door. "Dean?" Castiel called out.
"I think...I need to use the restroom." Castiel said as Dean directed him. Meanwhile, Emma gave a knowing smirk.
"Why yes. I use vinegar in all of my recipes. My great-aunt Gertrude recommended the idea to me when we were contacting Eustace's dead brother Horst from beyond the grave. I wanted Eustace to resolve his issues with Horst." Muriel said. "Oh well, just no fixing that man's stubborn behavior."
"So let's run through the scene where Dean finds out Cas has been working with Crowley. That's the next ep we're shooting. It's best to get ready just in case." Misha said. Dean nodded as he remembered when Cas told him.
"Oh yeah. Come on, I'll take you to the frame the roadhouse is supposed to be." Jo said. Mary and John were meanwhile doing further measurements and calling about further permits when Dean rushed to hug them.
..............................................................................................................................................................................................................................
"Sit in the room and I shall explain." Castiel said. Charles and Naomi did as their son ordered and sat on their thrones. Once Samandriel and Anna appeared, Samandriel smiled.
"Not even a hello. Even if this were friendly terms." Meg hissed.
"Hello, Sam." Dean huffed out.
“Funny, Sammy. You forget you beat me the last time we met when I was possessing your brother’s Angel of the morning?” Lucifer reminded.
"Things change, Sam. Besides, there's some unfinished business I have." Dean said as he went over to Misha's trailer when lunch time hit.
..............................................................................................................................................................................................................................
"Hi, Dad. I heard you were back." Adam said as he went to hug John.
Dean made the first move to pick Cas up in his arms as they fell in the bed on the crescendoed refrain of the first verse of "Unchained Melody" and slowly entered Cas as the older man wrapped his legs around the Winchester's hips. Dean kissed Cas's neck and whispered sweet nothings to him as they got further. "Dean, I'm close." Cas gasped out as Dean pushed deeper into him on the falsettoed need in "I need your love". Right then, they climaxed and Dean kissed Cas deeply as he rolled over so Cas could straddle him while they made out. As the song played out, they locked hands, touched foreheads and Eskimo kissed.
"Watch where you're goin', you fool!" The Asian man said before Dean decked him so hard, his head popped off.
"That's it, you're gonna go see Raphael." Michael growled and took the sword away from Castiel and sent the Angel to get beat up by Raphael.
"Sam?" Cas asked as he watched him get up. Suddenly, though, Bartholomew found where they were.
"YOU LET HIM ESCAPE?!" Prince Azazel screamed as he threw a glass at King Charles.
"Dean, that is strike one. Now come collect the dishes." Charles scolded.
"Yeah, and you nearly starved yourself to feed me even though Father did the same to feed you." Sammy pointed out.
"Oh, I'm sorry. Did I hurt you?" Courage asked as he dusted Miracle off with his tongue. "I'm Courage, what's your name?" Courage's eyes then bulged a bit as Sam and Dean approached the house.
"That and the hot dogs. I'll be sure to get the ingredients. Onions, poppy seed bun, Dill pickle spears, sweet relish and tomato wedges. Just grew some tomatoes too." Cas said as Dean swooned.
"I don't know." Cas said. "I just came back as Zachariah told you you're Michael's vessel. I have heard this, but I didn't realize." Castiel looked into Dean's eyes again, his grace tingled a little as he fought not to kiss Dean.
Thomas walked out of the hut with a bruising glare. "Of course, Princess Meg." He bowed his head softly to her and quietly left. Meg then went into a separate room of her home and went to a shrine.
Tired and hungry from all that running, Miracle took a rest and went to sit on a shady piece of sidewalk. Unbeknownst to her, she'd done so in front of a restaurant and butcher shop. The owner looked outside the window and was looking quite pissed at first, but Miracle just whined as she needed a break. She was pooped afterall.
"You're making holy oil?" Gen asked.
"No meat?" Sam asked.
"My mother was struck by lightning the day I was born." Castiel explained. Lucifer's the oldest of the family, he tells me everything about her. Thunderlief was where she was struck by lightning. I was gifted powers once I was born. That day it happened was a Thursday. Thus why they gifted Thunderlief to me. Thursday is the day named after the Norse God of Thunder, Thor. The point is the lightning strike made me able to understand animals. Father was intrigued by my abilities, but my mother succumbed to her injuries. Father stopped taking interest then." Castiel sighed. "I'm glad Lucifer, Michael and Gabriel were there to take care of me." Lucifer walked up to them.
"Please don't stop." Cas said.
Muriel had sold Eustace's truck after his death. Despite his death, she still had a heart of gold and kept her sweet, positive demeanor. And she still had Courage. They were cleaning together and Courage had been given new seeds to grow a new magic tree.
"SURPRISE!" Sam and Eileen said as Dean stood bewildered.
"NOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!" Courage cried out.
"Well hello to you too, Michael. How was your trip?" Gabriel responded sarcastically.
dead. But then, Crowley came to me and showed me what happens when the mark of Cain and the first blade make contact on a dead man." Dean said as he flashed his eyes black suddenly. Cas gulped, and then suddenly threw himself out of his bed, falling in the process.
"Apparently, you met in season 4, which was the year I came back from Hell. You fell in love with her on set and married February 2010, 2 years after you met. Jensen married Danneel three months later in May. Right after you went to Hell with Lucifer."
"I'm Dean. But you don't have to help me. I must finish by myself or the King will send me off to marry Prince Azazel." Dean said as he re-scrubbed where the mud had been tracked. Anna took her shoes off and went into her bedchambers. The rest of the scrubbing of all the floors took a total of 12 hours and by then, Dean was tired and hungry. With that, he was about to fall asleep with his favorite stuffed animal from home when he saw a woman snooping in his bed and shredding his last scent of home.
..............................................................................................................................................................................................................................
"It's a long story. I was hunting a ghoul, I got severely injured during the hunt. So I drove myself to a hospital where Adam's mom, Kate was working. We kinda hit it off and then one thing led to another and for fourteen years, I took him to baseball games, we even went out for his first sip. Then I got a lead on Azazel and we didn't have enough time to see each other. Then I died and then I don't know what happened after that." John said.
"Ah, the royal Servant. I wish to thank you for clearing me for the thefts. Two hundred millennia and I feel free to be rectified of crimes I did not commit. I award you my extensive baking recipes." The baker offered as he went off into the world.
“Castiel, I come to you as a man, no more or less, with the hope that I can take your hand in marriage and we can make each other honest men until death parts us.” Dean said as he handed Cas the ring box.
"They're the only midwest team I can follow. Plus Kansas City, MO neighbors Kansas City, KS." Dean explained.
"Can I ask a question, Cas?" Adam asked.
“Why are you helping us?” Sam asked.
"Into Magilla Gorilla?" Dean asked.
..............................................................................................................................................................................................................................
"Scones are done, Dad." Emma said as she took out the first batch of the day to set in the display kloche. Dean smiled.
"Sam? You okay?" Dean asked. Sam shook his head as he began to collapse onto the floor. Cas walked over to him and touched his head, then Sam was back to how he was before his time in Hell.
Team Free Will 3.0, Courage and Ruby all witness the rise of past witnesses of the supernatural as well as the return of some of Courage's past spectres that have haunted the Bagge farm.
"Me too." Michael said. The waitress obliged the four of them and went to give the orders. The four then proceeded to talk amongst themselves.
"He finished watching his favorite cowboy movie with Cas nearly ten minutes ago, he probably wanted to help clean up." Crowley said. "His fondness for that Angel, I'll never understand."
"Dude, a little help?" Sam asked.
"Castiel plans to absorb all the souls in Purgatory to become the new God. But he's gonna absorb the Leviathans alongside those souls. Becoming the new God is gonna be to save the world and protect people as well as Sam and me. But I don't want him to be gone once he realizes being God isn't all it's cracked up to be. Thus I'm putting together the blade used to kill Leviathans." Dean explained.
"Dude, seriously. What the Hell? I'm married to RUBY in real life?" Sam texted. Dean texted back.
When Cas woke, he and Dean were in the same position as before, but Dean was humming "Blackbird" to him, not off-key like he had described before. Cas smiled and kissed Dean's chest.
"All I was focusing on was what was said about Azazel." John said.
"Great. I'm gonna go for a quick run, then I'll get dinner started. All you need to bring is your appetite." Dean smiled, but then remembered the last time he was here. He suddenly felt a cold essence and a twisted stomach as he recalled Gen's shrill, hysterical screams of "MISHA WAS KILLED LAST NIGHT!", and Dean started running to find Misha. Sam chased after him.
"Okay so in late 2011, Cas went missing after Leviathan had been sucked up into his stomach." Dean began. "In that time, I was grieving." Just as he was getting into further details into what he'd done before Cas came back and ultimately, Mary and John coming back as well, Sam and Jess were knocking at the door.
"Hey, I decided to make PB&Js for lunch. Hope that's okay." Misha said when Dean came in.
"So where've you been this whole time?" Cas asked.
“Are you here to take the sexfiends?” The Entity asked, eyes bloodshot.
"That must be Dean." Bill said as Dean pulled up in the Impala. Bill walked up and shook hands with Dean when Dean got out. "Great to meet you, Boy. I'm Bill. John and Mary told me a lot about you."
Dean softly sang to Cas as he twirled the love of his life around the living room floor. Cas giggled giddily.
"So Jack." John started. "How were you born?"
"I hope you don't mind, you said you were doing a potluck so I brought a couple things for entree and dessert." Cas said as Mary took the beef roast from him and Dean took the cake in.
"I accept those conditions." Crowley said. Cas nodded and Dean was in. He couldn't wait to get started.
“Where will you go now?” Sam asked.
"That was worse for me too." Ruby said. "For what it's worth, I still am. But if you don't want me, that's fine too." Ruby walked a little bit ahead and Sam sighed. Soon, they were at the patch of brush where everything was supposed to happen. Already, witnesses from Nowhere were already rising. From Dr. Vindaloo, the family practitioner in Nowhere, Eustace and Horst were also in the group. A maniacally laughing Asian man was standing there in all the chaos when Dean bumped into him.
"I'll have a burger and fries." Michael said.
..............................................................................................................................................................................................................................
"Understood. Cas's out for a while, he's busy chilling a couple bottles of mead for him and I to try in Antarctica at the moment. When you finish unpacking your duffel, we can maybe go for a walk with Miracle, catch up." Dean said.
Trigger warning: Just thought of this so don't shoot me; discussions of past suicidal thoughts.
"So you
"Sam did say you have weird tastes of sorts." Adam said. Just then, Dean came down.
"So I'll have black coffee with 4 sugars, a cinnamon stick and a shake of Nutmeg and I'll try your cherry pie." Castiel ordered and Dean was more than happy to give that to him.
"Always, baby." Cas answered back by leaning back into bed to stroke Dean's cheek and kiss him. "So lucky to have you." Cas said.
"I can enjoy that while I wait. Apple reminds me of my dad. He used to bake too. He and my mom died last year in a home invasion. Uncle Castiel took me in right after." Claire said.
"Dean my dude." Ash said in his laid back tone of voice. "Long time, my man."
"That would make a lot of sense. Lucifer only wants to get his sword back not so he can hurt Earth, but so he can just reunite with it. They were a great team back in the day. Castiel's heard the stories from Gabriel." Jimmy answered.
The End
..............................................................................................................................................................................................................................
"Do you think your friends will like me there?" Emma asked.
“Shut up, I didn’t complain when you used to kiss Eileen.” Dean said as he went back to kissing Cas.
"This whole time, we were meant for each other." Dean said as he kissed Cas deeply. "This whole time, I not only-" Cas cut him off as they kissed deeper.
"I'm friends with your dad, he heard you were thinking of getting one and so I pulled some strings." Garth said. "She's a real beaut, ain't she?"
"A portal, huh?" Michael asked.
"Lay it on me, Dean." Cas said.
"That is for me to judge, Dean." King Charles said.
"Leave them to be together. Let's just see what happens. Castiel will probably not recognize Dean at first as your sword." Gabriel said. "But my money's on his grace being able to recognize."
"I love you, my son." John called out as the horse began to walk away with the King's party.
" The spectre said as Courage carried Jack and Dean back into the house. When they got in, the spirit of the virgin deputy, Nancy, was tormenting Sam.
"It's true. She knew what she was doing." Cas said. "Then afterwards, we stayed on the couch for the night and we ate peanut butter curry soup when you called about Emma." Cas remembered.
"Morning, Blackbird. I found a lizard, come have some." Dean said as he handed some to Cas. He took some and tucked in with gusto.
"Wait, did you say piecake?" Dean asked as he sat down.
"That's a cute ring on your finger, Castiel." Adam said when he noticed Cas's ring.
When Cas had returned from his mission with Hannah, he found an Obsidian blackbird and a note attached.
"Yeah?" Dean asked.
"That's my special secret recipe blue ribbon dog food." Muriel said. Jack wasn't all that preturbed, oddly enough.
“It’s a long story.” Sam said as he hugged her tightly.
"Yeah. And she now has her powers." Dean said. "Do you know if Jack saw her stab me?"
"What's that?" Cas asked.
"Ah, love." Muriel said. "I'll make a pie to celebrate." Muriel then began to make another pie.
"If you didn't, I wouldn't have met Michael. Speaking of, we should probably bring you back to your place." Adam said as he and Michael took Dean and Cas back to the house, then parted ways for the night.
"Thanks, Dean had it made for me to propose with." Cas said.
..............................................................................................................................................................................................................................
"Without breakfast with my favorite God? Never." Dean said as he pecked Cas on the lips before they got back in bed together and ate.
"He's right, Cas. We need you just as much as you need us." Dean worried. Cas nodded.
"Night, guys." Adam said as he and Michael flew off. Dean and Cas then retired to their home, petted Miracle, who welcomed them home with a big, slobbery kiss and brushed their teeth before dressing for bed. Then Cas, as part of his nightly routine, took off his engagement ring so nothing happened to it while he slept and tucked into bed beside Dean for the night. They hoped to see Adam and Michael at the wedding, whenever they decided the date would be. In the meantime, they were content to just be together, enjoying the engagement itself. They would figure out the rest later.
"We bonded over John, Paul, George and Ringo. Plus Cas lights up my life." Dean said.
"But Mom. Jack and Lucifer." Dean said.
"Yeah, Castiel." Dean said. "Say, you need help rebuilding the roadhouse?" Dean asked.
"Crowley, I'm not alone, he can hear you from under the car." Cas said. Crowley huffed and leaned on Baby a little.
"Dad? Who is i-OH MY GOD!" Emma squeed.
"Now, Dean. Until you are 18, you are to earn your keep and live with the scullery maids until the day you are of age and old enough to breed. From there, you are to be married off to whomever I choose. Be it my son Lucifer or my ward Uriel." King Charles explained halfway through the ride. "Should you fail your tasks in any way, I may break your father's contract with you and marry you off to the man who murdered your mother. Is that agreed?" King Charles asked. Dean gulped hard.
..............................................................................................................................................................................................................................
“Oh sure.” Dean said as he pulled away from Cas and they all headed out to Chuck.
"We will set the bone down in this bowl." Dean said as he set down the bowl Crowley gave him for the making of the blade. Harry then set down the blade and Dean opened all three blood vials and poured them all over the bone at the same time. Once the bone became a blade, Dean went back to the warehouse.
"Nice to meet you, Lord Dean of Winchester. How did Castiel find you?" Gabriel asked.
Sam tells Dean the Angel found them and Dean finds a way to get the Angel banishing sigil to work.
After a brief dinner of peanut butter soup that Cas had learned to make and lobster rolls Sam insisted on making for them, Cas laid Dean on his old bed and they began making out.
"Why are you telling me this?" Misha asked.
"Emma?" Dean asked, shocked to see his daughter was alive.
"Yes. It's a long story." Emma said as she then took her knife out, and Dean was dead. Emma then tested her strength by first picking Cas up, then putting him down just as easily as she had picked him up. "Okay, you can revive him now." Emma said as Cas knelt down and brought Dean back to life.
"Uncle Castiel?" Claire called to Castiel.
"Oh right, I've meant to bring that up. Would you like to do that, Cas?" Dean asked.
"Is it too much, baby? I can stop if you want me to, let me know if I need to, sweetheart." Dean promised with a peck on the nose, making Cas's heart flutter.
"Hello? Oh. Visitors, how lovely. I'm Muriel Bagge. Come, come in. Have some tea." Muriel said as Dean and Sam walked in with Miracle and Courage. "Oh Courage, you found a friend. I'll whip up my special blue ribbon dog food." Courage and Miracle were excited.
"Beyond exhausted. But she's great." Misha said. Wanna see West's latest pic she sent me?" Misha asked. Dean nodded and he showed him on his phone. Dean gushed at how cute baby West was. Shortly after, they ate in silence before they crashed on Jensen's couch. Dean held Misha close as he slept, Dean feeling close to him. But then Sam texted him, breaking the calm.
"So what did Sam want with you?" Cas asked. "The day we left the bunker."
“Apple pie life really suits you, Dean.” Jess said.
"Interesting." Dean said.
"Sure. Let me finish my Sars-a-parilla." Cas said.
..............................................................................................................................................................................................................................
"Take a shower with me then." Misha said. "For all I know, you could be wearing some sort of really strong make-up that stays on even when you get sweaty." Misha said. Dean once again obliged. After a strong scrubbing down with soap (and a little round of felatio on Misha's part because Dean was THAT addictive), Dean was clean inside and out. Still no tats that Jensen's gotten. Not even a round of "Answer me with Jensen's favorite things without googling" could shake Misha's belief this was just yet another hazing from JSquared. But then, when they had sex, it did feel like Dean was trying to reach out to Cas. He shook it off though. "I'm gonna go home. It's getting late. See you tomorrow?" Misha asked.
"Oh Dean, so good." Cas groaned as Dean thrust sharper, picking his pace up a bit faster now. No sooner after they started though, were they close to orgasm. Dean pushed into Cas deeply before coming inside him hard. Hitting Cas's prostate, Cas screamed out, resulting in his grace illuminating the house. No glass broken, Cas and Dean made sure there were no broken bulbs. Afterwards, Cas was worn out completely.
"And what? So I have Lucifer's sword and that's gonna make me HIS vessel?" Sam chimed in.
"When did they-?" Sam couldn't finish, he was left speechless.
"I didn't know my son would consider him compatible." Charles explained. "Not to mention, we fear our oldest son's fury because of what we did to his last connection to his mate, his son."
"Shhh, the secret ingredient is vinegar." Courage whispered to Miracle, who made a shrugging face and tucked in.
"Seems like yesterday your mother left you in my care after she decided she couldn't take care of you anymore." Dean said. Emma smiled back, eyes teary.
"It must've absorbed some of your grace into the necklace." Dean said. "Now I have some of you with me." Dean said as he kissed Cas. "I'll be right back, gotta call that pizza order in." Dean said. Cas just lay there, content that he had not just had the best sex in his relationship with Dean, but had put more than just thought into his present to Dean. He had given him a piece of his soul, something Dean'd already had emotionally, but never physically. And Dean felt even more honored to be Castiel's in that moment.
"I wish I had a body sized bar of nougat." Jack said and the tree supplied Jack the giant bar.
"I still feel like I owe you something." Dean said as he pulled away. Then he remembered something. He ran outside the bunker as he remembered a little white kitten Miracle had found a few hours before he'd been sent back to when he was "Jensen". Sure enough, that kitten was there and she was sleeping sound in the grass and leaves. He picked her up and cradled her in his arms, sneezing along the way.
As quietly as they could, Dean and Sam left the Impala behind a dumpster, taking only what they needed. Those fluttering fuckers were surprisingly easy to kill, hell; they’d fought ghosts that were harder to take out.
“We knew pretty much from the get go. If you wanted to keep it to yourself, that was your business. You do the work, pretty damn well, and that’s all that really matters.” Dean was stunned. Of all the reactions he’d thought about, calm and dismissive weren’t on the list.
His barely there boxers were water slicked to his skin, covering absolutely nothing. Dean couldn’t help the damn
Everyone took the news surprisingly well, given the fact they were stuck on a deserted tropical island and Dean could very well die giving birth. He wasn’t worried though, because there wasn’t anything they could do about it. Worrying about it would just stress him out and probably hurt the baby anyway.
Dean felt his heart flutter uncomfortably in his chest at the mention of a girl. There was a good chance
The tablets were
“There’s something just so
Closing his eyes and fighting back a lump in his throat, Dean rinsed his mouth out and turned out the light.
That was, until Cas went out to relieve himself, and came back with some kind of monstrous root.
No, he didn’t have anyone, not even close. Regardless, so many rumors had been spread about him, getting off with all sorts of girls at every party he’d never even been to. Most of the girls he’d supposedly hooked up with, he was pretty sure he’d never even spoken to. In every ones minds at school, he was some kind of man whore who hooked up with random floozies and slipped off into the night, like a slutty batman.
“What troubles you?” Dean looked away, suddenly embarrassed. It was a stupid thing to be getting upset about, but it was mainly his heat talking. The logical part of his brain said
Dean shaded his eyes and began his search. From what he could see, the island was actually huge. He didn’t know why on earth an island that size wasn’t populated. He didn’t care though, they wouldn’t be on the island long enough to find out anyway.
“My diner burnt down because my dumb fuck of a cook thought it’d be a good idea to drink and fry.” Dean winced as Benny explained why he really had had no choice but to join the armed forces. “Stupid me, forgot to renew my insurance, and here I am, trying to pay back the bank and everyone else.” Benny chuckled darkly and shook his head.
It had taken him a while, but he had finally found a decent video on how to prep himself for Cas. Filtering through all the grainy, cheesy, amateur videos until he found one he felt semi comfortable with had taken the better part of a night, but he knew he had hit the jack pot when he finally stumbled upon it.
“Sugar! I’m addicted to
, his teachers must think he’s all kinds of nuts.
Cas surprised him by laughing, the sound watering over Dean like the parched desert earth.
“Shut up, bitch.” Dean tried to tickle Sam before the light turned green, but his brother just whacked his hand away.
I can be myself.” Sam looked doubtful, but smiled anyway.
“You must drink this, Dean.” Cas didn’t sound so flash. Was he… was he crying? “You can’t – you can’t
though, and had a mean craving for peanut butter and pickles. He knew he wouldn’t be able to explain his way out of that one, though, so he just made himself a peanut butter sandwich and made do.
It wasn’t like he hadn’t slicked up before, but it was generally during his heats, or he’d wake up drenched in sweat and slick after a particularly vivid dream. He was panicking; he could feel it in his heart rate and more than sweaty palms. He tried to calm himself down, but a noise drew his attention to Cas, who was out of the water and –
"Good idea, I don't wanna break her so soon after getting her." Emma said. "I'm gonna call you Aretha. You are soulful in appearance. Oh, but I MUST hear if you can sing. Tomorrow though. In the meantime, I'm gonna sleep in you. If you'll have me tonight?" Emma talked to the car and Dean chuckled.
Dean and Bobby quickly bought breaded pickle chips and summoned Death and asked him what had happened. Crowley was just as confused.
"Do you have anything to wish for, Dean?" Rowena asked.
"You must be the lucky girl. I'm Garth." Garth said as he got out of the car and shook Emma's hand, giving her the keys to the Bel-Air.
"Miracle seems to like it." Dean said.
..............................................................................................................................................................................................................................
The End
..............................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dean was putting a new engine into Baby when Cas came out. "Hey, babe. Gabriel here already with the samples?" Dean asked as he walked over to kiss his fiancee.
"We should wait, but I will come to bed again with you. Come on, we'll turn your room into an us cave. I even got the TV for it and we can catch up together on decades of pop culture." Cas said. Dean liked the idea of that already. The night was young and he was up for anything. Especially with his profound bondmate.
"Servants don't deserve comforts like us." Queen Naomi guffawed, Charles lightly smiling. This didn't sit well with the crowned Prince. Nor did it Lucifer for that matter.
After a delicious breakfast, Emma got Miracle's leash and walked her to the park.
..............................................................................................................................................................................................................................
"You did what you thought was right, Dean. Even if it ended up wrong, you did what you thought was right and that's all that matters. C'mon, let's not do Chicago dogs tonight for dinner. We'll go out for dinner instead at the Roadhouse." Cas said as he and Dean walked out to the Impala. Once outside, they were shocked to see Jacob's Studebaker with Jacob and Emma making out.
"I'm coming, Sam." Dean said. "You should go home." Dean said.
"You're after Cas's grace?" Sam asked. "You're not gonna-" Sam started but Dean cut him off.
"Mmm, that looks like Dean's corn beef hash that he sometimes makes in the bunker." Jack said as he took a soup spoonful of the dog food.
"Hiya, guys. Heard you're gettin' hitched. You have an empty storespace I can start a bakery and diner?" Gabriel asked. All Dean could do was hug him tight. Cas and Michael joined in, as did Jack. Things were really getting more interesting indeed.
"You must be the crowned prince and you must be his brother Lucifer." Dean curtsied to them.
"Oh you know what? Cas and I were just about to head to the Roadhouse to have dinner. Emma, why don't you come with us? Getting out of the house will do you some good." Dean said as he pulled Emma out of the car gently.
“Now now, baby. Don’t tease.” Jess said.
"Someone wanting a slab." Dean said. Suddenly, Horst broke into the house carrying the slab of King Ramses. Jack took it from Horst, grabbed Big Bob from under Eustace and Muriel's bed and told Dean to shoot him with it. Dean did so and Jack took the slab back to Ramses's tomb, which was then taken to the institute.
"Hello, Dean. Have you eaten at all today?" Cas asked.
Dean fell into the warehouse Cas had been hiding in, just before Cas had absorbed all the souls. Cas frowned as he turned at the thump sound of a body falling, and then saw Dean rise up from the ground and approach him.
"Grandpa and Aunt Mary urged me to move in with you. May I come in?" She asked.
"Please stop, you're burning me out." Metatron groaned.
"Sam got a note from when he was in that alternate universe. He told Balthazar what the note said and he relayed everything to me." Cas said.
"I bumped into him a few hours ago. Not gonna tell you where he is, Thomas. I made a vow when I came to live here. I will not betray the trust of Castiel." Meg watched her brother. Thomas just rolled his eyes as he got up.
"Sam's necklace that he gifted me when I was little. Sam has it in his pocket after I found out he doesn't think about our bond. It'll protect you." Dean said as he put it around Misha's neck. "And this?" He started as he gave Misha Cas's Angel blade. "Was Cas's Angel blade. Remember what little training we had together. If and when Jensen returns, start something with him. Don't let time pass you by without letting him know how you feel. Don't make the same mistakes Cas and I made." Dean said as he kissed Misha before running deep inside the set.
"True, I do." Emma said. "I bought some barbecue chicken, put that in the cheese sauce and I make my own corn tortilla chips with mesa dough. Go ahead, try them." Emma said. "Whatever's left tomorrow I turn into empanadas and Huevos rancheros for breakfast." Cas took a bite and he was honest to god having a foodgasm that was both better than sex with April and Dean combined and better than sacrificing to the Mayan God of corn and others. Dean had a similar reaction, but didn't shock him as much as it shocked Cas.
"Kinda in the mood for some Beatles, let's play "Penny Lane"." Dean said as he put on a Beatles tape he had made after Mary and John visited for a coffee date. Dean sang along to it a little bit and Cas started singing with his fiancee. Dean stopped for a second to realize he and Cas weren't just compatible in bed, but also musically compatible. When the song was over, "Lovely Rita" started playing and Dean felt like he fell for Cas all over again. But all too soon, they were at John and Mary's. Mary waved out to them from the front door when they pulled up and they each grabbed the components.
"Relax, that's just to shut him up. The only thing he's gonna tell me is where your grace is." Dean said.
"Well after the Angels fell and I kept Sam from giving his life to cleanse Crowley's soul, I first prayed to you to come back to me, because I didn't know you had lost your grace at that point. Then I put an APB out for all Angels who could hear me asking for help. The only one willing was an Angel who called himself Ezekiel." Dean said.
Thank you for reading, please give me your input.
"Been there, but I've gotten used to it since I got those feelings back. Tasting is the best part." Cas said. "Peanut butter's my favorite."
"Hello, how may I help you?" The guy asked.
..............................................................................................................................................................................................................................
"Yeah, her son Jacob's the owner of the Studebaker. Real beaut, too. You can come look at it. Why?" Emma asked.
"I'm well aware of your kind, Amazon. Dean bred with one to create you?" Cas asked.
"I did." Sam said. They all cut into a slice and Jack and Belphegor soon came in, shocked that Belphegor kinda looked like if Jack was charred to death.
"I was running a quick errand. How was helping rebuild the roadhouse?" Cas asked.
"Been teaching myself a new song too." Dean said. "Did you know that Eric Clapton learned how to play guitar from George Harrison?" Dean asked. Cas shook his head.
"Interesting." Dean said. Meanwhile, the Angel sent by Raphael found the Supernatural set. Dean and Misha heard Sam run up.
"I see you've acquainted yourself with Kali and Ellen." Cas said.
"Why do I have trouble believing that?" Cas asked.
"What?"
"In deed, also you're right." Cas said as he circled his index finger around the younger man's nipple. "Butter does work well." Dean giggled and kissed Cas deeply before they got up to shower and Dean redressed to get started with the 5 PM shift.
"Raphael sends a message, Castiel." The Angel said.
"That's because Aunt Mary uses chicken and pork and grinds the skin into the mix. Creates a texture like no other. I've had it since last week, it's just to kill for. Not like I'd do so for just that reason or without cause. Like if I was hunting. I already have my powers." Emma said.
"I know you're not Cas, but hear me out. I'm not Jensen. I'm a version of Dean Winchester from the future where Castiel is sucked into the Empty. I'm telling you that this may be a show in your world, but in my world, monsters? Ghosts? Demons and Angels? All real." Dean said. "And at the start of the next year, Cas will absorb the souls and beat Raphael, but he also absorbs Leviathan. He sunk into a water reservoir, taking Cas with them. Eventually, we do find him. But just before he tried to become a new God, he broke the wall Death put in Sam's brain to keep him from feeling Sam's memories of Hell." Jensen said.
"On our engagement?" Cas asked.
"I was serving as a triple agent the whole time. I worked with Lilith and and you guys, but I reported to Crowley. Didn't know though that he was sleeping with Lilith on the side though until I had to pretend to be loyal to her." Ruby explained.
"These are good." Castiel said.
"So I looked up Nowhere and turns out Nowhere is here in Kansas. Not too far from Lawrence either." Sam said.
"I'm a Nephilim. I was born to a woman named Kelly and the fallen archangel Lucifer, who ended up being right about God." Jack started. "But when Dean, Sam and Castiel told my mom that my father infiltrated a congressman hoping to become President of the United States, she had to hide with Castiel. He then fought at all costs to protect me. But Mom died while giving birth to me and at that same time, Lucifer killed Castiel and Sam found me hiding beside my crib. We locked eyes, then Dean began to shoot at me. I don't blame him, he was in pain after Castiel was murdered by my birthfather. Meanwhile, Mary tackled my birthfather into a version of Earth from which a portal opened just as I was born, where Sam and Dean were never born and the apocalypse decimated half the planet."
"Hi, name's Dale." The Familiar's owner greeted.
"Dean, you're alive now." Cas said.
..............................................................................................................................................................................................................................
"You're back." Sam said. "Dean, I know you said you don't want to become Human again, but-" Dean cut Sam off.
"Stupid Halfa" Eustace grumbled as the wind carried Eustace off. Jack picked the hat up and flew off. When he got back, the hat was gone.
The End
"You may not remember me, but I promised I'd kill you." The voice grew darker as he then began to elongate his fingers into claws. "I told you I'd grow strong enough to one day kill you. I missed a lot with my mom, Dean Winchester. Now I get to exact my revenge for what you did to me."
"I'm full, but thank you." Dean said as he kissed Cas. The two men then began to cuddle before Dean got up to brush his teeth. "Another thought just came to me, what will Mom and Dad think when they eventually meet Emma?"
"I hear it's a great substitute for lube." Dean said as he smeared a bit of it onto Cas's hand, guiding said hand over Dean's entrance. Cas began stretching him out and Dean soon was arching his back once Cas found his prostate. "Oh God." Dean groaned.
"He might as well enjoy himself before we begin. This next part's gonna be painful for him. Boss wants to know everything." April said as Barbara nodded in agreement.
"Dean? What are you trying to say?" Cas asked when the Angel pushed Dean's lips off his. "That you love me too?"
"And I know who YOU are, Amazon." Dale said as he called Giselle, who shifted and helped Dale carry Emma into his car to hold for a spell. Meanwhile, Miracle ran to get help. She followed her nose for Cas and Dean, knowing they would help. Searching first at Dean's work at the restoration place. Sometimes she'd walk there with Dean on days he had paperwork.
“The only thing I’m hungry for is you, Dean.” Cas said as he nipped Dean’s ear.
Eventually, Dean's thrusts became sporadic and too much for Misha and Misha came with a shout, leaving Dean to climax inside the older man, then collapsed on Misha's chest. Once they took the time to recover and Misha had taken care of both of them, they redressed and Misha took a second to drink in all of what Dean had said to him.
"You're definitely teaching her well yourself though." Castiel said. "I might come here more often." He suddenly remembered what happened earlier and Dean gave him a knowing smirk. "To eat, not to come in my pants." He corrected. Dean then noticed how blue Castiel's eyes were and he began to gulp.
"Trying to track Metatron. He's been off the grid since the Angels ostracized him following his stabbing me to death." Dean said.
"He made a deal with the Empty, the place where Angels and Demons go. Him in Jack's place. He's a Nephilim Cas kinda adopted." Dean said. "If he experienced his truest happiness, he'd go willingly into the Empty. His greatest happiness was telling me he loved me. Watching him die like that made me realize I love him too. But I'll never get to tell him how I feel now." Dean sighed. "Then Balthazar took me back to this time period and when I saw you, I fell in love with you." Dean gulped as he took Misha's hand. "Just because you look like Castiel doesn't mean I'm placing my feelings for Cas onto you. What we shared this afternoon, I felt a current of emotions with you I could never feel with Castiel. I don't know how to explain it.
"Of course, sweetie." The professor said as he approached the counter. "Hi, my son would like a chocolate chip scone with strawberry cream cheese and my niece would like to know if you have any leftover chicken, spinach and mushroom pasties." The professor ordered.
The End
"Dean, Dean! DEAN!" Sam screamed.
"It's fine, Jack. I'm fine. I mean, I'm not, but it's not your fault." Dean assured him. "It has been hard since everything happened. I miss him deeply."
"Nice? Dean, after everything they did?" Sam asked.
"There you are, Castiel." Bartholomew said.
"What happened was not your fault, I promise you. I thought he'd understand a bond formed between a blade and an Angel." Gabriel said.
"Can you believe it? It's signed Magnus." Dean said as he shook his head.
"Lord Dean, I am Garth, the second Fitzgerald of Orthodont. Do not worry, I am Beta and have a Beta wife. We fight well." Garth bowed.
"How?" Dean asked.
"I thought it'd work for the sandwiches I'm making. I also made brioche rolls to put the sausage on and I'm making over easy eggs to go on top of the cheese." Emma said. Dean and Miracle's mouths both cartoonishly watered. Suddenly, Cas came in.
"We're going method." Dean tried to pass it off.
“Is that Dad? I wanna talk to him, knowing how to smite Grandpa. Maybe he has an idea.” Jack offered.
"Sam, they might be able to help explain the situation and Rowena's Queen now. Which means she has a handle on this." Dean said. Courage began to shiver.
..............................................................................................................................................................................................................................
"Hey, I'm thinking of making dinner at my rental tonight. Wanna come over and we can talk more about the you really being Dean Winchester and not the Jensen Ackles I've known for the last two years?" Dean smiled and texted back.
"And it looks like he had a family of his own. Horst and Eustace. God how old-timey." Sam retorted.
"Emma? What are you doing here?" Rowena asked.
"Cherry fields forever." Emma mused. Claire looked at her.
“Cas?” Sam asked confused.
"It's a Campbell family recipe, this pie. My grandma Deanna passed it onto my mom and it was passed down from my Great-grandmother, Grandpa Samuel's mother." Dean explained as he served it and the coffee to Castiel. Castiel took one bite of the pie slice he was given and suddenly, he envisioned himself frollicking around a giant field of giant cherries, "I can see clearly now" playing in the background. Once he was on a swing flying into the sky with the sun in his face, he suddenly fell back to Earth, a wet patch in his pants.
"That's what happens in Fear, Cas. Don't worry about it." Emma said to Cas as she turned to say goodnight to Jacob. "Would you like to help me go vintage car shopping next week?" Emma asked Jacob once she turned back to him.
"The idea here was to teach you to play your roles, but I don't really care about that. I can't go back to Sunday dinner." Gabriel said.
"You always had wide hips, I'm not surprised. I'm a Beta. I'm glad too, I didn't want Father to marry me off to some knothead." Meg said. Just then, Michael came out.
"Wow." Dean said, once his breath had caught up.
"I love that idea, baby." Dean said as he kissed Cas. "Speaking of, I better see if Baby needs maintenance." Dean said. "Finish breakfast and maybe you can help me?" He smiled.
Thomas of the Azazel Principality ambushes his sister, Meg, at the same time Dean is introduced to Michael and Thunderlief's visited by the relative Novak Kingdom.
"Mmm, did you make your own crackers?" Castiel asked.
"The one and the same." Gabriel said. "And I also arranged that you and Castiel reunite, Dean."
Cas insisted Dean ride with him on Blade while Lucifer trailed on Frostbite. Dean stroked the Camarillo's mane. "Blade definitely likes you, I can tell." Cas said.
"Mmm, something smells weird." Cas said.
"And Cut!" The director said and Dean knew exactly what to do then. "Excellent work, boys. That's lunch. Go over.
"Here, my mother helped me make this special for you. A special wand on days that Uncle Castiel will be away. It helps ease heat pain. Mother's family worked as blacksmiths during the rule of Queen Rowena's father." Princess Claire explained. Dean loved the gift.
"So what's this about Sam killing my first grandchild?" John asked.
Not gonna be shy about it, sometimes it's hard to spell hors d'oeuvres, so I have no choice to spell it phonetically by spelling hors d'oeuvres as orderves. If it drives people crazy, I'm sorry. Please continue reading though?
"You don't know what-" Gabriel cut Michael off this time.
"Wow, this house could use some readjustments. Could use a fresh coat, a little carpeting on the steps, I love the windmill aesthetic." Dean said as he let Miracle out. Right then, she bumped into Courage.
..............................................................................................................................................................................................................................
"I thought we could finish the tasting with that, because I know if you do taste it, you're gonna be all "YES! This. Is the one I want for our wedding." and whatnot." Cas said. Dean blushed a bit.
"Of course. Now, if you excuse me, I've earworms and...Jefferson Starships..." She dramatized at Dean, who blushed at the name he gave that last batch of monsters she made before he ganked her. "Have a good rest of your day." She said as she walked away.
"Dean!" Cas said.
"I'm good friends with Ezekiel." Cas said.
"And we love him already." Kali said. "Welcome home, Castiel. How was your trip?"
"When do you think construction will be complete?" Cas asked.
"Hold your tongue, filth." Naomi scolded. Dean collected the dishes quietly and went into the kitchen to finish cleaning up. Once he had finished, he walked in to his room and his stomach started growling.
"Think nothing of it, Dean. We're family. Virtual strangers or not, we're family no matter what. Especially since you're gonna marry my twin." James said. "And I expect you to come to Castle Novak to wed there. I'll even have the heat room set up and everything."
..............................................................................................................................................................................................................................
"You've changed it so Castiel stayed God." Crowley said.
"How about yours?" Misha asked back and headed back. "I'LL BRING PIZZA!"
Back at home and very full, Emma was finishing all her work and calling John and Mary while Dean made her some soup and gave her a root beer.
"Thanks, sweetie. Could you check on the turnovers? See if they've overcooked?" Dean asked. She nodded and checked them out.
“Jack wants to talk.” Sam said.
"I heard about you in the papers, the Amazon daughter of a Winchester." Jacob said as his claws elongated further, his fangs coming in. "So Jack resurrected you too?"
"Yeah, officially." Dean said. "OOH, Mom made meatloaf. I love me a good meatloaf." Dean said as he piled on three pieces of meatloaf on his plate and took a heaping helping of beef roast. "Mom always made her meatloaf with pork and chicken instead of beef. Makes it moister and she even grinds the skin into the mixture. The skin's always the best part of the bird and the bestest part of the mixture. Try it, baby." Dean said as he put a forkful to Cas's lips. Cas smiled and took a bite. Cas's eyes fluttered and moaned. "Good, huh?" Dean asked.
"That would be my Courage." Muriel said.
"Lies." He said. Annoyed by this guy already since Emma said it was time to go home, Miracle managed to get out of her collar and ran to get help.
"If the half-Angel translates for the Stupid one's Widow's dog, I conjured a creature so destructive it would have destroyed Nowhere if Muriel did not sound." Shirley said.
“Alright, lovebirds.” Amara said lovingly. “Can we go find my brother?”
"We kinda look like twinsies." Belphegor said.
..............................................................................................................................................................................................................................
"Cas, thank God." Dean said as he threw his arms around his fiancee.
"It's okay, I got it. Take a break, drink a frappe." Dean said as Emma got ready to serve herself one. Suddenly, the bell dinged and Dean turned to see the handsomest man in a 3 piece with two youths in tow.
"How bad is he?" Michael asked.
"Father and Naomi have been abusing this one emotionally and psychologically for weeks." Lucifer whispers. Gabriel nodded.
"Are you crying?" Sam asked. "Hi, Jack." He greeted Jack.
"I love you, Blackbird." Dean whispered as he kissed Cas before they both came together. This was perfect indeed as they fell asleep shortly after.
"Of course, Gen." Dean said with a smile. Gen threw a smile back and nibbled on Sam's neck in what's supposedly Jared's favorite spot.
"You did?" Cas asked.
Emma saw that as a red flag. "Is yours? And does it matter? They're both girls." Emma talked back. Meanwhile, Miracle ran back to Emma with a ball Shadow had gifted her, asking her to throw it.
..............................................................................................................................................................................................................................
"My hair!" She yelled as Jack managed to knock off her wig. "I'm Ugly! UGLYYYYYYYYYHYYYYHYYYYYYYYYYYY!" Eustace's mother ran off ashamed of her baldness.
"So whose bone do you want?" Ed Zeddmore asked as he and Harry Spengler were searching the convent where Sam and Dean first retrieved the bone to begin with.
"He was a sweet man when we first met. But sometimes he could be quite nasty and mean. But over time, I learned to live with it. Just par for his charm." Muriel said. "Horst was all charm but much worse bite. He got that from Eustace's mother. A horrible woman. Her great-great aunt once fed a poor widow's husband into Loch Ness. Then the widow's ghost thought MY great-great aunt did it. Tried to rip Eustace's and my marriage apart. Through everything, Courage has always been with me." Dean sighed at that.
"So you could kill me?" Cas asked.
"Emma was supposed to call me, let me know when she and Miracle were coming home from their walk." Dean said.
"Your mate has a mouth full of cavities and cauterized gums by that stablehand out there. He'll eat a whole jar of honey." Ellen laughed and Kali nodded with an admitting smile. Suddenly, Gabriel came in with Dean.
"HahahaHAH! Alright, buddy. Hi, I missed you too. Where's your collar? Where's Emma, Miracle?" Dean asked.
"So you pretty much ensured that I lose the love of my life that night?" John asked, beginning to seethe.
“Dean’s in the Empty?” Amara was stunned. “No Human should ever BE in the Empty. How’s he surviving?” She asked.
"I'm sure they'll understand." Cas said as suddenly, a call was made. Cas picked up the phone.
"You want my blood?" The Alpha asked. "You know something I don't?"
"Please, it's not like your tribe of Amazon is a hive mind." Dale said.
..............................................................................................................................................................................................................................
"I think so." She said.
"You're not gonna try and nuke us, are you?" Sam asked.
"Whoa, easy Cowboy. C'mon. I'll get you in bed to sleep faster than you can say bedbugs." Dean said as he picked Cas up and carried him into Dean's old bedroom. Together, Dean laid down with his Angel and decided they both needed some rest.
"Oh, can I get that recipe? I'll trade you for the meatloaf." Mary said and Cas shook her hand as a deal.
"I'll be exposed faster if he doesn't leave." Ezekiel stressed. Dean clenched his teeth.
"You left me with a succubus." Sam whispered in case Gen was still hearing. Dean just slightly giggled and he got a text from Misha.
"I'm Dean, Lord of Winchester. Son of Lord John." Dean said.
..............................................................................................................................................................................................................................
..............................................................................................................................................................................................................................
"HAVE A NICE NIGHT!" Emma called as he drove away and Jacob gave her the "Okay" sign as he drove off. "So, Cas has never seen Fear? You should get on that." Emma said as she got in the back seat. "The poor thing's as pop culture starved as Jack's occasionally nougat starved."
"What?" Lucifer asked confused before he realized he thought Dean was his new betrothed. "Oh, no. I'm still forever in love with Kelly. This is our new future brother-in-law, Dean of Winchester." Lucifer cleared.
"What do you mean?" Dean asked.
"Dean and Sam need Cas, I'm Cas. What are the ingredients?" Dean sighed and Sam told him what was needed. Misha had an account outside his marriage to Vicki to make sure their assets got separated equally outside their own accounts in addition to their joint account, and he paid for the ingredients, explaining it away to Robert that it was practice props to see if they really worked because as Dean/Jensen stated, they were going method. Sam told him how the ingredients are supposed to go in the bowls and Dean trained him how to fight.
..............................................................................................................................................................................................................................
"Coming, Sammy. Jack's here." Dean said. Sam followed Dean's voice to the older brother's bedroom.
"Fresh strawberries and kumquats mixed in cream cheese and apple butter for the filling of a gorgeous crepe courtesy of Sam, my famous flapjacks on the side with a shot of bourbon-aged maple syrup made in Iowa of all places." Dean said as he ripped off a strip of pancake, dunked it into the syrup and fed it to Cas.
"Stay. Please." Dean said with a sincere look on his face and Cas responded by kissing Dean.
"I understand why you would, I'm a Demon now, Demons lie. But you know what Betty Everett said, if you wanna know if I love you so?" Dean didn't finish as he kissed Cas passionately and as if he would kiss Lisa, or even Cassie before that. Dean felt Cas's heart soar from under his chest as they pressed into each other. Suddenly, Dean's blood went south and Cas could feel it. The kiss broke as Dean fumbled in the drawers for something slick and a condom, which luckily, he was able to find. He looked into Cas's blue eyes and touched his forehead as he prepared himself and Cas for their first time.
"You need no creature comforts. I am Queen Naomi, this is considered contraband. Now I will see you do our laundry in the morning. In the meantime, have a lobster." The Queen barked as she chucked the dead crustacean at the Omega's head. Dean began to have a panic attack and tried to open the lobster with the drawer, but when he opened the drawer, the dresser next to his bed just fell apart. Miserable, in pain and tired, he just chucked the lobster and gathered up what was left of his mini-horse.
"Ruby?" Sam started. "They revived you?"
"Time to shoot already? I better shower. Thanks for last night, Jen." Misha said as he hugged Jensen tightly. Dean hugged him back and Misha ran quick to his trailer to become Cas.
"I told you, the pie does it's magic everytime." Emma said.
"Amazing." Cas said. "Mary, we must trade recipes sometime." Mary smiled at the idea. Then Emma came down from her room.
"So you killed them?" Cas asked. "By stabbing me in the stomach?"
"I see that you've found a way to diminish my Reaper patsy. Let's get down to the chase, alright? What spell did Metatron use to lock us out?" He asked before he began to choke Cas out with his powers. Dean broke the trance by decking him. While Dean was confronting Bartholomew, that gave Cas ample time to cut his hand open, put up the sigil and in doing so, sent Bartholomew out of the apartment.
"You're out of practice trying to get the upper hand, Samhain." Cas playfully chided his younger brother with the nickname he gave him when Samandriel couldn't pronounce his own name at a young age, learning it. The pair quickly laughed and hugged tightly.
"I'll stay." Cas said, and so did Dean at the end of the night, when Dean's shift had finished and he was too tired to get home. When Dean came back to Cas, he got in bed with him and they cuddled. There was no place either wanted to be right then and there.
"I do know what I'm talking about. Lucifer, even now in his prison? Still bound with his sword and his sword is in Father's room, Father's slowly stroking at it as he misses the son he forced into the pit. I'm running away once the Apocalypse starts. No more Sunday dinners for me." Gabriel sighed.
"Maybe she just forgot." Cas said. "She's been doing great with her school and stuff."
"Jacob?" Dean asked.
“Sure. Hey, I was able to save a dog for Deano, heard ol’ Cassie went into the Empty. Or if Dean went in with him, Jack needs a pet.” Lucifer said. “Really is a miracle. Just found her outside a gas station. It's a girl, I checked. Keeping her safe from Dad, but I’ll be sure to ask Aunt Amara when I see her IF he finds us and snuffs the pupper out, to let me take away his grace.”
"Maybe, but they're adorable. Kinda reminds me of Miracle. You think we can get a dog like this one?" Kaia asked. Miracle got bored with their conversation and went into Dean's office. Claire stopped talking and went after her.
"When I was Human for a while I liked the taste of peanut butter. All I ate back in the bunker was peanut butter and jelly sandwiches." Cas explained. "But when I got my Grace back, I got sad because I couldn't eat peanut butter and jelly anymore because all I could taste was every molecule. It made me sad. And then when the Apocalypse happened, Famine had visited this one town. We thought originally, that Cherubs were overworking their spells for Valentine's Day. My vessel's love of burgers really came out and that's how I became fond of burgers." Cas said and Dean chuckled, remembering that.
"I'm kinda in the mood for something." Cas said.
"Another part of the deal. Amara and the Entity both share a connection through darkness. She wanted to explore that connection, so she gave me her powers and joined the rogue Angels who I bargained for Cas with." Jack explained.
"Would Sam mind?" Cas asked.
"Coming, darlin'."
A few hours later, Meg had gotten back to her station hut when someone was sitting in her furnishing. "Been a long time, sister." A deep voice said.
“Dean, that tickles.” Cas giggled.
..............................................................................................................................................................................................................................
"I promise, brother. I didn't steal it. I've never stolen it. It just-" Cas got cut off.
"I'm a little nervous, it's my first time." Cas said.
"He wanted me to kick you out. He said you'd eventually bring trouble in and though he was sorta right, I didn't care because you're my family. Not just in the sense that we're like brothers. Though we became more than that in Purgatory. It became that way for me, at least. And when you let go of me?" Dean began to shudder and Cas held him close.
Michael's Archangel blade had a beautiful shape. It was regal, had a green hue to it. And though Castiel was interested, he wasn't an Archangel. He wasn't even a seraph. But still, somehow.
"I don't care if you're the new God as long as you don't abuse it. I'm just glad you're okay." Dean said as he petted Cas's cheek.
"Thank you." Dean said as he called for one of Crowley's guards.
"You're not a bad singer." Cas mumbled.
"Karen? Is it too late to start having kids?" Bobby asked.
"It's okay, I'll be gentle." Dean promised as he nuzzled Cas as they continued their coupling.
"What are you gonna do now?" Gabriel asked as Michael got ready to leave.
"Who was in charge of that?" Sam asked.
"I love you, Dmitri Tippens Krushnic." Dean said as he kissed Misha's mouth softer than he did last, Misha pulled him in. "And I did have to google that, by the way." Misha giggled and they kissed again, but then Misha remembered dinner.
"Yeah?" Sam said.
"Ohwhoa oh." Courage groaned when he woke up from his freak-out. "What did I miss?"
"They'll love you. Ellen is no-nonsense, but she's got a heart of gold. And Ash and Pamela, they'll try to get you to party. Just focus on work and nothing but. However, I'm also sure Jo will love the extra girl power and you'll have a lot of fun with her." Dean explained. "And on the days you don't work at the roadhouse, you can work with me at my restoration place. Grandpa John taught me how to work on cars from a young age, you can learn too. Especially if you want a car of your own someday."
"If you want, I can help. We're both technically monsters since I'm an Amazon and we gain our powers by killing our dads. Come on, we'll take care of that Studebaker together." Emma offered as Jacob took her hand. Dean decided to go home early. When he got home, he just held Cas close to him.
"You don't think I know that?" Gabriel asked.
"It was Jack. He's been bringing all kinds of people back to Earth lately. Charlie Bradbury, the Harvelles, all four of them, John and Mary, Bobby, I guess he heard that the Earthly Marital union of the Angel Castiel and the Former Michael Sword, Dean Winchester is to be held and he wanted everyone you ever befriended to be in attendance. I'm Michael by the way." Michael said as he shook hands with Jess. "I feel your baby is going to do great things. He is a Winchester, afterall." Michael said.
"Almost got it. Just need Demon blood. Dean, I highly doubt Fergus will be a willing participant. Do be a lamb and donate?" Rowena asked and Dean offered willingly. However, the addition of his blood resulted in a rift opening.
"You lost him, didn't you? I don't get to see the finale." Misha said with sad eyes. Dean nodded.
"Will you have to go soon?" Cas asked.
"CASTIEL! What is the meaning of this? And why did you have Lucifer summon us to the throne room?"
"For you." Cas said as he tapped Dean on the shoulder and handed him a box.
"I see." Shirley said. "No matter, I need your help." She said as she addressed Rowena. "Great Witch, It's been too long since I've seen your face."
"So it was on his mind a lot when he had first taken over my body." Jimmy said while eating a steak. "Mmm, good ribeye. He doesn't need to eat a lot so to eat more is just bliss. Better than the last time Amelia and I made love. Anyway, when he was younger, Michael's Archangel sword forced a soulbond with him. Spun his grace into itself. Gabriel witnessed it. Then when he explained everything to him, Michael showed up and beat the crap out of him. That's not entirely true. All he really did was shove him into the door of his bedchamber and THEN called Raphael to beat the crap out of him. Can I get some gravy? I haven't drunk gravy in a while." Jimmy finished.
"What're you doing back so-oh. I see." Michael said as he took one look at Dean. "I thought you didn't want another partner after Kelly."
"You're gonna love living in Thunderlief, Dean. We're all equals. Four Betas are at a station at a time, one Alpha per four Betas per station. Cassie runs an Apiary and we all take turns caring for horses, cows and other farm animals. Cas has a real knack for Animal husbandry. Don't you, Cas?" Lucifer asked excitedly. Cas blushed.
"NEVER LEAVE ME LIKE THAT AGAIN! You can't just tell me you love me and then leave me like that, you child!" Dean screamed out when he broke the kiss, only to go back in.
"I understand, hon." Dean said as he looked at Cas. "We'll look for it on Hulu or Prime Video." Dean said and Cas frowned.
"What happened to Colonel?" Mary asked.
Dean gets back to the present and is greeted to more than just Miracle lapping at his face.
..............................................................................................................................................................................................................................
"Alright." Cas said when he flew in. "Have fun, and don't forget to take a honey peanut butter roll." Cas got out a small candy-like roll covered with parchment paper. "Peanut butter has plenty protein and honey gives plenty energy thanks to the sugars. Have fun, love." Cas said as he pecked Dean on the cheek, then used his Angel magic to secretly sneak Dean's necklace out of his right breast pocket. While he was cleaning upstairs, he found the receipt for the jewelry store Dean had found that makes custom jewelry. He had flown all over the area for Garnet and Bloodstone. Sam had told him when he and Dean were "Jared Padalecki" and "Jensen Ackles" that "Jensen" was born on March 1st, something Cas would like to include in a reconstruction of the amulet. He showered, fed Miracle and then flew down to the jeweler who built the ring. Once he found the place, he walked into the store.
"Castiel, my son. Lucifer, so glad you could make it. You may go back to the kitchen, Dean." Charles said as Dean left the orderves out in the foyer as Charles walked the two men further into the castle before retreating to the castle. "I would hope your trip was fruitful coming over." Charles asked.
"Djinn poison, it's slowly killing him." Dean realized. Ezekiel touched Cas's forehead and fell down, his energy zapped, he collapsed just as Cas instantly sprung back to life, healthy and happy to see Dean and Sam.
"Wish tree?" Sam asked.
"So am I gonna be a Demon in the future?" Dean asked. Dean was happy to answer that.
"Hello, Dean. Castiel. Did you like that I turned Mary's spirit's destruction story into a legend for Monsters about a mother's love?" Eve asked. "Because word down in Purgatory says you forgot about the poltergeist." Dean lowered his head. "But that's not why I'm here. I wanna congratulate you."
"I love every inch of you, my celestial being. God, on our wedding night, I want to recreate when you appeared to me covered in bees. Imagine the residual honey-making pollen everywhere. I want to lick up every square inch of that nectar-like sticky sweet slick." Dean husked, inflecting with sharper thrusts into Cas's tight, warm cavity. Slowly, Cas's grace leaked out through his eyes, being led into the amulet's eyes in turn.
"Castiel, are you okay? Speak to me, little brother." Gabriel pet his brother's hair.
"I'll do everything for you, Dean." Cas said as they began to kiss softly. Dean suddenly felt the urge to nuzzle Cas's neck just behind his ear. Cas began to giggle.
"Yep, you're Polish. Balthazar sent us into this mess because an Angel in Raphael's regime has been sent to kill us. Speaking of, we better find Cas's actor. Last time I was here, the Angel thought he was really Cas and he was gutted for some stupid ritual." Dean said. As soon as he left the trailer, he smacked right into Misha.
Miracle woke up to the smell of bacon. Excitedly, she leaped onto the bed to lick Dean's face.
"You were on our side the whole time then?"
Once Jane had brought the BLTs, she had brought three for Dean, Cas and Crowley. Then she went back to the training gym.
"Dean, you need to get to the Bunker. You'll never believe who's here." Sam said. Dean did as Sam said and he and Cas dressed quickly and drove at high speed in the impala to the Bunker.
wasn’t in our camp, they fled.” Dean frowned, because that didn’t sound like a bunch of riled up alphas. “Their leader took off after you, so they had no reason to stay, I assume.” Ah, that was it then. Lucky the guy had given up when he had.
“Keep going, it’s the only way.” Dean didn’t want to ask what he meant, but he could make a good guess. Get the thing off, or Cas died. Yup, awesome.
But for now, he had a shitty essay about Shakespearean literature to start. God
and Dean had no idea
He needed fresh water, food and Sam, if he was going to survive.
He had a job to do though. Checking around its neck for the cord, Dean made sure its lifeline to him was intact and secure. With no cord hampering the way, Dean prepared for the next push to expel his pup. He placed his hands on either side of his entrance, and waited for his body’s signal.
“That’s alright honey, I understand. We love you, Dean. Me and your father, we love you so much.” Dean sobbed, because how could he ever think of his mom, who sung to him when he was scared, and made him special soup when he was sick, being anything to him but kind and forgiving?
He wrote some notes on the book, pretty much whatever Crowley put up on the board. All he wanted to do was go home and sleep. He was tired and achy, but at least he didn’t feel nauseous, like he had that morning. He’d have to hide that from his family; maybe he should buy some Tums.
kind of talk. That involved
“Only if you help me in the shower first.” Dean grinned when the alpha stopped and growled lowly, tongue darting out to wet his lips. He had a great idea, one he hoped Cas would be ok with. “Gotta catch me first.” The omega yelped as the alpha launched himself over the bed, but Dean was quicker.
True to his word, Cas’ annoying shit of a brother hadn’t said anything to anyone about where he had seen Chuck and Dean that night. School was back to its boring, non-threatening self, at least in Dean’s mind. He had never really been worried about going to school, yeah; he hated it as much as any other self-respecting teenager, but it gave him a distraction. It allowed his mind to wander away from the quagmire of sorrow that was his non-existent love life and focus on important things, like his art, Chucks ridiculous plot devises and whatever the hell was attempting to disguise itself as food on the cafeteria tray in front of him.
