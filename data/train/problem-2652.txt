"I'm so sorry... Mr. Holmes", the young man was looking at some point near his shoe, his once secure voice now reduced to a whisper. Sherlock didn't know what to do, it was the first time he had to deal with something like that. His face was expressionless.
“Your hand gave a volitional tremor for a couple of seconds.”
"I'm solving a problem. I need to find a way to lure the daughter to tell her mother and the case would be solved."
"Sherlock, stop it now, would you?" He said with a firm tone, making pressure on the back of the detective's skull with his fingertips.
than that. He remembered the times he had seen him fight. He wasn't strong and rude but his style was closer to martial arts. He recalled the punch he had given him when they were about to go to Irene Adler's. It was quite the punch. He smiled at the thought of the little wrestle they pulled. He remembered then again Irene Adler's words
"Because... she was flirting with me just to piss off her boyfriend with whom she'd had a fight minutes ago. And besides, she was cheating on him."
"Of course not!"
“First, he passed his hand on mine, but so gently that I could hardly feel it…” Sherlock whispered as if reciting prose, he was aware of his own throaty voice barely resonating in the room. He couldn’t open his eyes. “Then, slowly, his fingers began to lock themselves within mine, just like this; for he seemed to delight in taking possession of me…
As Lestrade turned every sheet of paper inside the folder, Sherlock faced John and took a hold of the girl looking at him. John also noticed, so he lifted an eyebrow to Sherlock and tilted his head to her. The girl didn't see John's gesture, she was absorbed staring at Sherlock.
"Gregory." He heard.
"Sadly, I can."
"Everything good? You seem down." A woman's voice asked from deep down the layers of fabric. He recognized the voice.
"And are you touching yourself, Sherlock Holmes?"
Sherlock did.
The components that were listed in the label were usually the one with the highest percentage in the product. Except for the ginger and honey that had a higher amount of lemongrass. The almond one also had gum from Ficus Elastica, big quantities, around 35%. More data needed. The mint and green tea had 20% of oil from leaves of a lemon tree. No need for more data, it’s only there for consistency. Many use citrus oils.
He saw a figure coming through the door of the shop; Mycroft wore his usual attire, a folder in one hand. When he spotted John, he slowly made his way to the table. John knew he was being
, actually sounding like
“Sherlock, look. I didn’t do anything I didn’t want to do. Hey.” Sherlock was frowning now, John couldn’t help but smile a bit wider, trying to channel some peace into Sherlock, who still had the same expression which was a bit self-conscious now. Ella’s voice resonated inside his head,
"I saw you coming upstairs with that tray..."
had left on his back, others at the back of his thighs and a longish one at the side of his right buttock. Not counting the bullet scar below his chest.
Without
The car that had picked him up had stopped in an underground parking lot. A chuckle that sounded quite sad to Armand's ears resonated in the place. It was dark and he could only see a silhouette in the shadows. And he was standing there, at lost; he wanted to get closer to the man in the dark, but he was a bit terrified. The male voice had told him to talk to Sherlock, to make him withdraw from the case and to convince his friend Xavier to
"It's the most effective way! Punch me!"
"Because, I simply don't. I went to Armand’s just to check what he knew about his father and his aunt."
Armand entered the kitchen and turned on the kettle. "So, what brings you here?"
"Jesus! Greg... I'll call you later." John hurried to the couch. He saw the effect of the drug, he had seen it before. But still it was shocking for him to see the effect in Sherlock. A faint layer of sweat was forming on Sherlock's forehead and it went all the way down to his exposed chest. John took a blanket and covered his torso. Sherlock was still shivering, John saw his pale eyes full of desperation. His dry lips moved in a very erratic way making some soundless variations of the letter 'O'. His eyes were trying to focus on the doctor's.
Ha. Yeah. Madness and sensuality pretty much defined the afternoon.
Before Sherlock could get a hold of the little book, a very old man in a suit appeared. He had white beard, long white hair that rested on a pony tail over the back of his neck. It gave him a very distinguish look. He stretched John's hand in silence and Sherlock's before claiming the empty chair next the detective.
John observed intently at him; it was the most erotic and beautiful scene of an orgasm he had ever seen. Sherlock's neck was exposed, his head was buried deep down on the pillow, eyes closed shut, his mouth was open and that incredible voice was managing the most exquisite sound somewhere deep in his throat.
"Sherl-" John attempted to turn, but Sherlock's grip was firm.
Shaking his head and giving a light chuckle at the thought, he tried to finally, put some order in his mind.
With a loud sigh, he walked downstairs and turned on the kettle, grabbed two mugs, checked the insides, put one tea bag each, added sugar only to one of them... routine. He saw the tray Mrs. Hudson had left; cookies, two sandwiches and two pieces of what seemed to be a chocolate cake. He smiled gently -
John squeezed some of the content in his palm and continued, “Did you know that there are over 500 different species in the family of aloaceae? It’s one of the genus with the largest list of benefits.”
John didn't notice he was looking at Sherlock all the time, and Sherlock was eyeing him back, a frown, his eyes narrowing, the dreamy face John had was confusing him a bit.
Sherlock turned to look at John and he managed a weak smile, remembering immediately Molly's words. '
Sent at 4:47
At eight o’clock John was not opening the front door of 221B. He was in his office at the surgery where he still did part-time work every morning. He had gone there under the excuse of paperwork but he found himself googling instead.
"Mr. Holmes, I'm sure your brother can bring the truth about this ca-"
His phone rang, the sound loud in the silence of the room. In his mind, instead of the ringtone, there was Sherlock's voice in a high pitched tone
"It takes more than a bloody gland-talk to seduce John Hamish Watson, you know."
"You're clueless when dealing with emotions, aren't you, Sherlock... emotions are for you like the solar system; you know the basic chemistry, the basic body functions, we talked about the pituitary gland..." He squeezed the fingers between his and Sherlock turned around slowly to look at him, "you were fine with the teasing but now, Sherlock..." John made a pause and turned to the window.
Sherlock smiled and turned his torso to look at John whom in turn lifted his face in his direction. “I guess we can both agree I didn’t need any more stimuli this morning.”
"And... how did you know he had an affair with the girl?"
When he was 14, he had said something to a girl and he could still remember it clearly. And sometimes, when he recalled the whole scene, even now with 42, he would still groan in agony and shut his eyes tightly in embarrassment.
"I don't snore that loud...!"
"You heard, John. Don't be loud." Sherlock said trying to sound serious.
"So, the case." John took another gulp of his beer.
“We did but the cameras had nothing at all, there is no change in the background or-” The sound of an engine could be heard in the distance and Sherlock shut his mouth as the light filtered through the curtains next room. A car was being parked in the drive.
"Here, please don't go immediately; take a few laps around the town first."
"Sir! I don't know what you're talking about!"
"Stop staring at me." He took his hand off his face and in one fluid movement he was back typing on the computer in his lap.
Sherlock froze. He never remotely imagined that hearing someone calling for his friend
John was entranced. He was trapped once more by Sherlock's observing process. He felt naked and exposed – literally – with the intense stare. But he was far more curious about Sherlock's behaviour.
"I knew that, John." John snorted at that and shook his head lightly.
"What is this card..." he moved it around his fingers, "blank, no face, no address..." he took a little envelope's opener and ripped it. Inside he found circuits and a chip. It was a mobile phone's chip. He sighed at the realisation. They were being monitored, so that's what had Sherlock suspicious. He let out a chuckle, gulped the remaining of his cold coffee, opened a drawer and took a little golden bulge.
must be in!”
Sherlock smiled and John couldn’t help but smile back. Their eyes locked for a couple of seconds again. Sherlock’s eyes roamed John’s face at the same time John’s eyes went to his mouth. It was something that John used to do ages ago. Sherlock’s eyes went to their hands.
"I was about to go for a coffee..." John answered, his face the clear resemblance of blank. "Sherlock?"
"Battery charge?" Sherlock did the last check on his coat.
"That you've become far too fond of that John Watson fellow." Sherlock felt his words like a knife in his chest. There was something in the way his brother spoke, it even gave him a physical reaction.
The first time we met
Sherlock swallowed and sighed, then in a small voice added, “Fine! God’s sake.”
“That’s… awful and impressive.”
"Well..." Sherlock got closer to John's ear again, "...I just told her that a woman so beautiful like her; with beautiful face, healthy skin, nice body, legs, and all... shouldn't be flirting around with a man like me."
“All of the information is confidential, you realise. Not even Sidney has access to it,” Abby said, her voice strong. At Sherlock’s lifted brows she added, “Sidney Eldridge, my secretary”.
"I am. You?"
Sherlock's expression was neutral, his closed lips moved upwards lightly, it was a silent '
John lifted his head from his hands and entwined his fingers in front, eyeing the ceiling with a resigned smile.
Sherlock supported his forehead on John's left shoulder.
“Yes.”
going to Ridling Thorpe?”
Armand exhaled, and then inhaled again deeply, stunned. Then took his phone from his pocket, pressed a couple of buttons and handed it to Sherlock. "Here."
John's voice was interrupted again by Mrs. Hudson's. Once again, he only heard a murmur soon followed by firm steps coming upstairs. The door opened precipitously and a furious John appeared.
“If tendinitis gets too bad then three to four times a week!” He flashed a grin, “May I?” He placed his hand on the mouse as he continued speaking. “I’m not going to lie to you, I’m always looking for a bit of freelancing… do you think I can apply to fix this?”
"My cheek hurts." The detective words were muffled by the pillow, but they still understood them.
. The detective lifted his legs from the floor and positioning them over the couch, next to John's.
"Hidden at plain sight. I remembered everything last night."
“Okay,
"I'll make sure you enjoy it, Sherlock..." Armand kissed his neck again and ran his lips to the detective's collarbone, slowly. When he got there, Sherlock took Armand's hand from his neck and planted it over his trouser, right above his cock, making pressure, with a firm grip on the man's wrist.
"Sherlock, whatever it is, I'm sure we can put up with this when Lestrade finds the pickup. Then maybe we can ask more questions. I'm off to bed and you, Mr. Holmes, should do the same. You haven't slept in two days!"
John was about to turn around to face Sherlock who was in the living room supposedly, but one hand on each upper arms stopped him.
“We’re missing something, John. We need to find Miss Patrick’s association with Abby Slaney and the case should be solved in a blink.”
But there was another side of his mind telling him this was right, his body was sensitive and this was the most logical way out, he needed the release and the experimentation as his hand slowly travelled from his erection to his scrotum, he moved his fingers down there teasingly. His eyes were closed, he didn't dare to open them, he didn't dare to watch himself going there.
"Hm?" he lifted his brows and blinked slowly, lazily.
“I’m going to need you to turn around.”
by criminals, before. John grimaced. That was an awful thing to think about. Hadn’t anyone made Sherlock feel cherished? Wanted? Or maybe Sherlock misinterpreted The Wink as a joke? Did
"Sorry..." John heard a snort, "I had this bloody nightmare and I called you before I realised it..."John let out a reassured sigh. It was just that, then.
"Hm?" Sherlock lifted his eyes to Armand, just to find the younger man closer to him, he frowned and moved his neck back. Armand let out a sad snort, a bittersweet smile crossing his lips.
He was recalling over and over about yesterday's events, almost getting himself into a depressed state. He had finished his shift at the hospital earlier than expected, had talked to Sarah, since they stayed friends – not that they have much of an option, either – and they'd had a little fight. John had been distracted doing his job, and Sarah told him he had to
“It’s fine,” John repeated, calmer now. He was clearly trying to reassure Sherlock and himself. “There must be something in the products, I’ve learned that there are non-conventional aphrodisiacs. Means that whatever affected you does not usually affect people. These things happen.”
"And why does that amuse you so much, Dr. Watson?" Sherlock's voice was calmed and under control, but John was keeping himself under control as well, there wasn't a trace of insecurity in his voice.
' That time, Mycroft knew Sherlock had been disappointed, once again, because of the answer. Sherlock had changed the subject that time and referenced to the cigarette's bad quality and the older brother threw his last dart '
"What is it?"
"I do!" Armand ran his fingers through the long locks falling over his eyes. "It was the way I got to your blog in the first place! Really nice move there, by the way... the pictures for the criminals to tell you apart from Mr. Holmes..." Armand chuckled.
"Loud?" Lestrade asked, still with a huge grin.
But Sherlock’s open mouth was against his jaw and the side of his neck and he was panting hard and his hips were following John’s tempo with ease so John’s warning died for the time being. Sherlock’s teeth graced his stubble a few times, a tongue made a few appearances against his skin. But John knew they had to stop - or move - when he heard humming downstairs.
John snapped his eyes open. He stopped walking and let out a puff of air.
. They came here so often now, it was almost a common thing, predictable, even. The restaurant was good. Besides, they could eat there for free if they wanted. But Sherlock always left money on the table as they left. Sometimes, even covering more of what they've eaten, except for a couple of times when they had to go in a hurry.
With renewed energy, Sherlock kissed John fervently, his tongue immediately entering the wet tunnel of John's mouth, he was rewarded with a heated kiss as he moved almost frantically over John, this time, trapping their erections between them with enough pressure to make them both come. He massaged the bulge of John's prostate until he felt the muscles there contracting, John pressing his buttocks as close to him as possible and a loud cry echoed inside Sherlock's mouth.
"I'm really sorry for tonight," he said, Sherlock lifted his gaze from the phone to him, "for any... inconvenience. I'll take the uh... sofa’s offer..." and then, like remembering something, he took a big gulp of air and added, "I won't say anything, I mean about my feelings for you. I do have them, I can't do anything about it. But I won't... tell Dr. Watson."
When he got there, he greeted Lestrade, who was about to enter the flat as well. As they walked upstairs, they heard a very bright violin melody, sounding much like gipsy music. John opened the door and Sherlock stopped the melody abruptly.
"Hmm..." Sherlock groaned as John remained on his knees, trying to breathe normally, then untangling his legs from John's waist, they fell heavily on the mattress.
. The laugh was short but loud and instantaneous. John had to place his fist over his mouth to dissimulate, but Sarah already had a very surprised expression.
"Armand
John looked at Sherlock the whole time, his mouth a bit open and an obviously amused smile on his lips. His eyes were completely open, as if he saw the man in front of him for the first time. At seeing this expression, Sherlock gave a long exhale and suddenly he had no idea of what to say, he began to blink, and he opened his mouth to say something but he could never remember what it was.
"Take off your sheet."
"Please don't take it the wrong way. I was just wondering, just... okay." She started to clean up the implements Sherlock had used, her hands shaking nervously.
"Should I wake him up?" Armand asked waving to the sleeping Sherlock.
"Yeah."
"Nnno." Sherlock's eyes went down again and continued his scrutiny to one of the books on his lap. A frown formed quickly on his features as he was absorbed by it once more.
"I could kiss you right now." Sherlock said leaning over John's ear.
And John had claimed it to be a nightmare. Sherlock smirked widely.
There was John's voice at the background of every image, the dates of the laptop, one of them being today
“Nothing. Nothing unjustified, at least.”
"He was never real to begin with."
"Damn..." he muttered. Sherlock's face got closer to catch it, never moving his gaze from his own glass "...it's extremely warm now. Bloody awful."
received at 04:27.
. Furthermore, what would have happened if John had had a date with him in bed that time, for example?
"Oh the lotion!" John laughed, trying to sound indifferent. "Mrs. Hudson gave it to Sherlock when he needed uh... something for his experiment."
After a few minutes shifting and tossing between his sheets, he came to the conclusion that it was pointless. He lifted himself from bed, quietly put on his slippers and opened his door, not making any sound. In case Sherlock had fallen asleep on the sofa he didn't want to bother him. There was nothing but silence and a faint light leaking from downstairs.
John was pulled from his thoughts when Martin started to stand up.
"I told you before, John."
"A dull case, yes." Sherlock moved the book in his hand to another pile of books next to him, before turning his attention completely at the tired man who still sat at the edge of the bed. "An infidelity case, John. A woman, Christine, came in today and asked for help. She is under the suspicion of her husband cheating on her."
"Business?" Phillip lifted one brow, cigarette lightening due his long inhaling, Mycroft tensed his toes in an attempt to calm himself as he saved the phone in his pocket. The man in front made him uneasy to the utmost.
"No- Yes. I don't know. John... John, I am afraid of my boredom, I am terrified of my mind. I can't consider another way of living, I
**..**
"I beg your-"
"John, you need to sleep. I'm going to think this through and we can continue tomorrow."
John laughed, incredulous. He walked slowly to place the first aid kit on the table.
. Hard. Completely red from whatever was visible above the neck up to his forehead.
With a swift move and a groan, John managed to roll them. He kissed Sherlock's neck as he moved his fingers as gently as he could. Sherlock was relaxed, he trusted John and John knew it. Soon the taller man was reaching for the little bottle of lotion, placing it in John's hand and John understood what Sherlock wanted now. Immediately and with unusual nervous movements, John coated his shaft with the lotion and placed the tip right outside Sherlock.
When Phillip finally hung up the phone he snorted and hissed at the ashes of the forgotten cigarette between his fingers.
"Oh, and may I know, what is a seven to you?" John crossed his arms over his chest, giving him a side glance look.
In the dream he was suddenly in the middle of the living room, Rosie on the carpet screaming “Lemon!” and Sherlock looking down at nothing and breathing hard. Mary was there, too – or probably not Mary, since she looked more like an older version of Rosie – and she had made a gesture with her head as if nodding to Sherlock but looking at him; her eyes huge and scornful, her mouth firmly closed as if he was doing something horribly wrong. In the dream, he had walked over to Sherlock and had raised his arms a little, Mary – older Rosie – had smiled and, as he was about to hold the man, little Rosie on the carpet had screamed
"He's talking to my brother." Sherlock said as soon as they got out from the car Lestrade had sent to pick them up in the morning. John just eyed him, still surprised on how the DI followed every little desire of the consulting detective, to the extent to send Sally driving his own car and not the police's.
The lead he had was already clear, and John’s eyes were really blue when close, he hadn’t seen them that close in long. The names of the cameras were finally solved and they could even get a huge lead tonight, Lestrade was already on alert about it. The touch of John’s hands was surprisingly soft for someone with so many years handling a gun. He had already called Miss Hilton and everything was ready. Tonight he would be completely alone with John, with whom he had shamelessly flirted not fifteen minutes ago. He sighed. John was already coming up the stairs.
He had to. It was easier this time because only his face and part of his torso would be visible on the photos. He could ask John to turn around. He had headphones in his pocket just in c–
But as he talked to John on the phone, he lost it. He lost it at the overwhelming feelings of the doctor and this time, he couldn't help it. A single phrase that almost made him change his plans, that almost made him tell John all about the fake suicide, about the fake fall.
“So, to sum this up,” he said with his pencil and notebook in hand. “Your partner is in prison for three days and maybe more after? I thought she was going to walk free.”
Louis sighed too, his eyes darted to Sherlock for a second, the detective's profile was hidden. He was reminded once again about that time in the alley. Despite everything, Sherlock was quiet, calmed to plain view, his facade impeccable, except for his throaty voice. "Where are you going now?"
Sherlock lifted his stare from the cup and cleared his throat. "Look, John uh... if it's about the other day, I can completely understand if-"
[Trousers]
"Shut. Up."
“What about them?” John sat down in his chair. He did a small victory dance in his head when he noticed that Sherlock had left his armchair to him and made Martin sit on the client’s chair.
"Are you bringing your gun?" Sherlock asked, suddenly changing the topic and turning around to get his scarf.
As soon as John heard gunshots he lowered his head whilst making a gesture to Sherlock to lower his as well. He complied John's orders, but fell to the side by doing so, making him occupy the rest of the backseat. Luckily for them, it was a double cab.
Sherlock laughed sincerely at this.
"Hello..." Sherlock approached the situation from another perspective. If he wanted the results of the experiment to vary, he had to change the variables as well. "Oh, I'm sure you can do a lot of things for me." He purred again.
Sherlock looked down at the table, at his untouched beer.
"So be it." '
He stood up and placed his hands firmly over John’s shoulder. “You said...” Sherlock-no. William put his face right next to John’s, his lips a caress over the other’s ear, “…a little tension between two grown men…” Sherlock’s arms went around John’s neck, hugging him, “…who meet a couple of times a week to…” Sherlock felt how John’s hand went to his hips keeping them firmly in place. He dug his fingers into the bone and Sherlock gave an involuntary moan.
"Oh."
His body felt heavy and his eyelids fought to stay open. The sheet over him was wet with sweat and his ankles were strained by it. Maybe he tossed and managed to get himself into this. The hand that wasn't around his erection was behind his back, painfully trapped between his weight and the mattress.
Sherlock was thinking deeply about that fact; it combined with the dream made perfect sense; John was part of him, his heart. Even thought it was terrifying, he noticed how nothing changed inside him, and it made perfect sense because that only meant that, somehow, nothing
"And?" Sherlock opened big eyes at the man, who just answered handing a paper to him.
Mycroft knew what Sherlock expected, he expected a change in the answer, he expected that something in his older brother's life would have impacted him enough to change his mind about that life's philosophy.
Sherlock wanted to massage John’s hands back. Odd. He wanted to move his thumbs over John’s wrists. He wanted to massage John’s arms too, he wanted to squeeze his oily skin.
Sherlock frowned. "How can you possibly know, or imagine, for that matter, that I am a handsome man?" Sherlock asked, experiment already going.
As soon as Sherlock had arrived at the spa, Miss Eldridge had smiled brightly, telling him Abby Slaney had wanted to contact him because of the software development application. She had been interested in updating it for a while but hadn’t had the time to find a software developer in London. So he had been given her phone and the task to contact her in the evening. He was meant to call at seven, so he still had two hours to get the massage and grab a cab to Craig’s place.
', [Eyes] '
"You don't fool me, Sherlock..." the soft masculine voice cut the silence like a blade, Sherlock just looked up to the man in front "I know it was you."
“John, you already know Detective Martin.” Martin stood and offered a handshake and a confident grin.
.” Lestrade was completely out of breath, walking, about to cross the street. On foot. He was wearing trainers. “
Sherlock became aware of his own reaction when half a moan was already out. There was no way back. He would stop the whole business, then. His mind quickly supplied excuses, white fonts floating like water over his closed eyelids:
She was obviously used to the attention; even Sherlock recognised she was an attractive woman, attractive as in Janine kind of attractive, about thirty-two – thirty-five. Not really his thing.
John supported his head on his arms folded over the lab's table. He closed his eyes, thinking about the conversation with Mycroft before. He felt useless, now he knew it was Mycroft's information leaking now but the facts were still floating around his head, not really connecting all of the points. Even though it was clear now, as Sherlock had stated as soon as he got to the lab, that they had to find the code Moriarty had left in their flat.
"He's been drugged."
Sherlock's deep chuckle resonated in the quiet room, there was almost no rain outside now. He walked to John's bed, but left door open, letting the faint light in. Even when John was sleepy, he translated the action as Sherlock wasn't staying for long.
“Could be. Still, there is no way to link them together. It doesn’t explain the necklace, either.”
The surprise and anger in Sidney’s eyes left plenty of milliseconds for Sherlock to release the man’s grip on one of his wrists, grab Sidney’s jar from her hand and spill the contents of the scented liquid over his captor and Sidney’s eyes in a whoosh. Both shouted in shock. With quick movements, Sherlock grabbed a blanket from the bed and threw it over them, successfully trapping Sidney and his mysterious attacker.
“I was just checking the database, John. Promise.” If there had been a time where Sherlock had dreamed of hearing John jealous… “I was able to check the eight cameras of the eight therapists that work here; yours included, obviously. They are named in a strange pattern whatsoever.”
The little wrinkles at Sherlock's sides deepened and, with a quick movement, he took the big bag with clothes and placed it against his chest, opening the door with a big fuss. John was there, his eyes didn't turn to look at him but they fixed inside the place he had just vacated. Sherlock recognised one of the men from Louis' gang holding John, dressed up as a guard. As soon as he saw Sherlock pass next to them he let John go, who just stood at the door of Molly's mortuary asking for Sherlock's body.
"Hm..."
"What?"
"If you continue talking, Sherlock, I'll forget to be gentle..." John said with his voice strangled, a little smirk playing on his lips. If someone had told him that Sherlock was ever going to talk dirty to him he would have laughed.
"Jesus..." John whispered, walking to his room "okay, good night, but you wake me up in case anything happens. Don't trust you going alone anywhere without any sleep."
. He smiled sadly at the memory.
When John was about to sit, a man behind Sherlock muttered
At this thought, he stilled under the shower, making the same gesture when finding the answer to a mystery: his palms were facing each other and he was smiling, his lips forming an
"I need data." Sherlock muttered to himself and, with fast moves, he was back on the couch. He needed to think, so he would benefit from the opportunity to go into his mind palace before John awoke.
– silly name – were only randomly photographed from the chest up. The small wheeled table with the products should be on the range of the photo, too. Sherlock mused for a couple of seconds why the products were being so securely held, even if he hadn’t found anything out of place with them, maybe except for the extra ingredients.
"Sherlock... please." He said trying to keep their balance.
John coughed and took a gulp of his soda. He switched the phone to silence mode again. As he did it, another text came in.
"Thanks man," he said to John, "I could never do that since I'm in charge of the place, but really. Thanks."
for Christ's sake! Oh you almighty detective."
**..**
As soon as Chloe closed the door to the room, she breathed at ease as the tension that had accompanied them the whole way seemed to fade. She supported herself on the door and gave a short, nervous laugh.
John nodded to the DI. Lestrade quickly changed his solemn expression for a humorous one.
"No. You don't observe, do you..." Sherlock let out a sigh. "I... had to move when I heard Mrs. Hudson."
He led the way this time, his phone still in hand. He heard simultaneously the answer in the phone as well downstairs.
stimulating."
"The computer's password."
“Well, yeah... it's the main idea." Abbey sounded really confused on the phone.
Sherlock wasn’t one to masturbate regularly. He often did quickly and efficiently but there were times when he really, really wanted to. This was
The minutes passed by and a knot was slowly developing at the base of his stomach. Again, he eyed the contents of the tray, appetite wasn't his friend today, definitely. Where the bloody hell was Sherlock, by the way? He had told John he shouldn't take long with the lab papers of the case.
family... in the justice I mean; my grandfather, my father... and I didn't follow. That's the only thing I always try to hide but... but you saw it right through me..."
"It's up to you." John retorted not lifting his gaze.
"What?"
“Oh no, it’s a blend of our own!” Abby said and Miss Eldridge added, further back, “It’s very good!”
had left him mortified. Just as mortified as John was when reading Moriarty's text. Sherlock quickly saw John's breathing, his reaction, but he knew it was because John was actually concerned about him. And he hated himself for that.
’ and then mentally scolded himself for forgetting Rosie was still picking up random words.
"Mm."
Yes, fascinated and nearly obsessed. It was insane.
A couple of minutes passed in which Mycroft just stared at his phone and the golden wrappings. He threw them to the trash can under his desk. His mind was in pause, in a strange state of blank. He startled when his phone vibrated in his hand before emitting the message tone.
Sherlock smiled, half his face was buried in the pillow, he answered with a soft
She placed the requested items in front of John. “Yes. You see now why I need to take better care of my hip.” She shook her head. “Take these up with you, will you, dear?”
"I wish I knew... it just... vanished in thin air. I searched with Xavier and there are no records of it."
When the loud click was heard, John pressed F5 again. He lifted an eyebrow at Sherlock and furrowed his lips to a side.
"I didn't come all the way here to talk about modals, John..." Mycroft sat on Sherlock's leather armchair, John sat in front. The older Holmes let out a long sigh and rubbed his temples. His position on the chair was casual and relaxed, usual composure seemed forgotten.
“Here’s the price list. It may have changed from the place he used to work, but you will feel the difference in the skincare products we use.”
Suddenly, Sherlock's strokes on John became urgent and stopped, his breathing was more rapid. He clenched his eyes tightly and let out a long, deep moan.
"Armand's father. One of the most powerful men in the country."
his lips moved without a sound, looking at Sherlock, the detective just shook his head and lifted his shoulders, his lips still parted seeking for extra air.
“That’s your way to say someone’s pretty?”
“Oh my God, oh my God… thank you, Sherlock Holmes.” The name was said with such reverence John frowned and then hurried to comfort Chloe. She started to cry, her hushed thank yous were repeated like a prayer.
"But you said girlfriends weren't your area, about a year ago."
” Lestrade was clearly smiling, why was he smiling? “
**..**
“You can still be there. You don’t look… forty,” John's eyes snapped up, looking at nothing in particular. Sherlock raised his eyebrows.
"Shut up, I imagine you can do better than that." Sherlock and Louis laughed shortly and the detective paused, a smirk on his lips now. "Thank you."
He felt John’s hands returning to his legs, up his knee, cautiously. Sherlock continued, his eyes never leaving John’s, “As he did so, our cheeks slightly grazed each other; and that touch – perhaps because it was so imperceptible – vibrated through all my body, giving all my nerves a not unpleasant twinge.”
“Okay, yes,” John’s hips thrust so hard the table moved a little. “We need to…”
apologise? Should Sherlock? Well, he did say there was an aphrodisiac.
John could feel - and hear - Sherlock’s hesitation and drew a breath as he fisted the fabric under his hand. In his head, he couldn’t stop reproaching his selfishness because, deep down, he knew he was trying to redeem himself from everything he had done in the past by helping Sherlock now. He had decided he wanted to help the moment he walked inside the corridor and heard him from the bathroom. But this would never work if he could even smell Sherlock stalling. “Sherlock…” he whispered, his hand moved slowly from Sherlock’s back to his right bicep applying the same pressure he used days ago on that first massage. “Go on.”
"Uhm... is there anything else I can do to help you, about the case, I mean?"
"Just hang up... or I can pass you over to another agent if you like." The woman said, clearly irritated for the lack of response.
John snorted and Sherlock couldn’t stop looking at him, even if the position of his neck was a bit odd. It was easy, talking about this with John, even if he was not asking what Sherlock wanted to be asked about. He thought about the years they knew each other and was secretly thankful for the deep understanding they already had of one another.
John lifted his eyebrows almost to his hairline and was about to complain, but the time on the screen indicated there were only twenty-six minutes left.
It was less than a minute later when he got his reply, he smiled as he read the answer.
"Oh, we didn't have sex, John."
So he grabbed Sherlock’s hand and walked them to the bathroom. Sherlock followed obediently and silently. As soon as the door was closed he pressed Sherlock against it and, with a hand on Sherlock’s nape, moved his face back against his neck. After a second or two of hesitation, Sherlock followed and attacked the spot like a starving man.
"Kiss me." John demanded, the words finally finding their way out of his lips. Even if the tone implied almost an

“Well, I didn’t think about anything that could cause arousal.”
, but enough to notice the movement of Sherlock’s hips. He moved his hands over Sherlock’s shoulders and neck, rubbing his fingers behind Sherlock’s ears and following the path back to his shoulders and then to his arms.
**..**
“Anytime now, I will go to our room to wait for her like I always do. We had dinner already, but sometimes she’s in the mood of a drink before bed, so you might have to wait for a bit longer.”
"I can't move..." John said suddenly, a light snort from Sherlock indicated that he was probably in the same state. "You okay?"
“About the aloe… I was thinking about massaging your scars.”
Sherlock made a little movement in his sleep.
Sherlock passed a paper to John with the transcription of the names of the cameras on it.
“And you’ll have them, inspector.” Sherlock made a pause as his eyes scanned Martin’s face and then glanced at the old man. He looked over his shoulder as the Yarders took Sidney, the mysterious attacker and the old man away and he looked at Martin again who was now busy handcuffing Elsie Patrick. “Is the ambulance for Chloe here as requested? Remember she’s my client.”
"Right. Okay." John gave a step back. The younger man felt cold without the caress, he  gulped as he saw John turning his back to him.
They opened the whole database; it was on display on the laptop, so Sherlock put the lid down a bit, making sure none of the cameras caught the screen.
sent at 14:31.
“Was he?” Sherlock lifted his head a bit. Then he frowned. “But I wasn’t, with him.”
Sherlock stood upright in the dim light, facing the sink, his back to John. He put his hands over his crotch but not really trying to cover himself and gave a very loud sigh. “John,” he said again, the N stretched a bit, making his exasperation obvious. “I’m sure that, whatever it is, it can wait five minutes, don’t you think?”
I must add, we all know some scripts and some memories are not mine, those belong to the geniuses - BBC Sherlock's writers - and the genius behind, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle.
He had fallen asleep on his back, arms by his sides, almost at the edge of the bed. He wanted tea. Badly. He changed to a sitting position and looked down at himself. He was shirtless, his stomach was sticky with a dry white substance now combined with his own sweat, his own semen... and probably John's as well. His trousers were still open at the front and there was a mess of fabric there. He had to support himself in his arms at the realization. It was really true, he and John had... touched each other last night, they had even... kissed. Sherlock's eyes couldn't be wider now, he was panting lightly, surprised.
“Well, she
“Yes. She’s also a very good boxer.”
Sherlock was so taken aback his lips started trembling, eighty percent of his confidence was gone. “Thank you.”
“It was attended by a Serbian surgeon on the flight back to London,” Sherlock said. “Very good, doctor.”
“The slides!” John managed between gasps and laughter. He supported his slippery hand on the floor, falling backwards again. Sherlock tried to follow, supporting his slippery elbow next to John’s neck, only to slip off over John’s chest.
Several minutes passed and John only heard the keyboard of Sherlock's laptop pressing rapidly, obviously he was looking for data of the painting. John's phone vibrated over the table, he looked at the screen.
"I know, but it was pretty close."
' and Sherlock's quick reply
Smiling for himself and exhaling slowly, Mycroft's voice resonated inside his head;
He loved the feeling of the soft fabric around his naked body; it felt like a caress that could very well replace human contact. Human contact.
“Stop.” John fisted the fabric of Sherlock’s open shirt. He closed his eyes when he noticed he was as attracted to that chest as he was a few minutes ago.
"You still believe I stole it, don't you?"
bit is usually right at the bottom in a very small font. Also, when I went over to get the products for this session, Abby, she…”
"Sherlock... please..."
“Well,” Sherlock sat straighter in his chair, his half-arousal somewhat tamed for now. “That’s kind of you, Martin, but” he placed his joined hands in front of his lips and said, “First, I don’t work for the Yard and second, we

"Why?" he asked, the high pitched tone showed the confusion.
"When you entered the container I asked you to pick up a number between one and two. You chose
And now, there were still things he could never risk, though. Even if his body was screaming for release, he knew John was upstairs with Rosie. Rosie was going to sleep for about three more hours, and John usually needed 20 to 30 minutes to be fully asleep. Plus one hour for him to reach REM, that left him with one hour and a half to kill. He thought about going to one of his boltholes, but walking at this hour of the night with his tenting jeans wasn’t a tempting option.

be if Xavier confesses. The case will be solved and you wouldn't have any more inconveniences... I'm convinced you don't want to endanger Sherlock, do you?"
, the entries on his blog... even though, until today, he thought he hated John's blog; it was too romantic, not completely focused on his deductions skills.
"Nature... has so many ways to tell us humans to stay away from the things that are not within our reach."
“Hurry!” Sherlock whispered back.
"I only know the address of mine..."
"We don't have time, John. We need to-" Lestrade stopped. They heard engines sounds, motorcycles sounds. Plenty of them.
“Hm?”
"No, no I don't mean that... Sherlock. You just
The pressure of Sherlock's head over his chest made him sit on the bed, a rush of fear passed quickly by his mind when he realized that he, out of instinct probably, had opened his legs and now Sherlock's knees were in between his tights, he looked up, panting heavily. Sherlock was in the same state of arousal he was. He pulled a bit Sherlock's shirt and the detective took it off.
He rolled to his side and found he still was a little hard from his previous train of thought.
"You were what."
John stayed quiet for longs minutes, just staring into Sherlock's eyes, returning Sherlock's hard gaze.
. This time, he knew it was different; there was something else on his expression. "...when I was drugged before, can you remember, the effect of the drug?"
"We're off." He said, his voice was throatier than usual.
“Look at me, John,” Sherlock interrupted, carefully not touching the man in front of him as he gestured to his own body. “You know what’s happening to me, and you know the reasons. So look at me and tell me: do you still want to know what I’m thinking? Because you know what’s going to happen to my body when I tell you.”
is fine..." Sherlock made a loud groan as he moved his neck to a side. When he did that, the card fell to the floor. The detective opened big eyes at it. "John!"
a great job, it's not that I don't trust our men, Sally... but I'm desperate by now."

"Not now, John!"
"Hang on... ignore it?" John asked incredulous, as if that were the stupidest thing he'd ever heard.
"That's why they went after me... they thought I went to talk to the police!"
Sherlock noticed how the only bit of the conversation he actually enjoyed, was talking about
John looked doubtful for a second, his eyes scanning Sherlock’s body but then he turned his gaze on the still sleeping Chloe. He rushed towards her and put his ear above her mouth to check her breathing, his doctor mode coming back right away.

. And no, there are no casualties.”
Greg blinked slowly and sighed. "Under a window in a room at the second floor." He smirked and shook his head, obviously amused.
“I’m sure you did.” The silence that followed was charged; their eyes trained on the face of the other. “The effect,” Sherlock said after some seconds, clearing his throat and turning to his laptop again, “might last a few more hours; we climaxed this morning therefore shouldn’t be an issue tomorrow. I sent the coat and the rest – your jumper included – to the drycleaners around the corner, even if the chemical must be completely diluted by now.”
And that day, Sherlock proved one of many points of John Watson. His limp was indeed psychosomatic and he was not going to spoil what Sherlock had ever proved or fixed in him. The pain was there, present, bothering, but he stepped hard on the floor again. Keeping the pain away was a way to keep Sherlock with him, at some point, so he choose to ignore it. He looked at himself on the mirror again. He was a bit thinner and he smiled as the word
John fingered Sherlock several seconds before moving another finger in. He growled as his index and middle were buried inside and he couldn’t help but stare the expression on Sherlock’s face; pure lust, pure wanting, Sherlock's hips were moving above him, searching for more pain, for more pleasure. John crocked his fingers up and Sherlock cried incredibly loud, his head tilted back and his grip on the sheets beneath him tightened, his jaw fell open and his eyes widened at the ceiling. John watched in pure awe as he mentally thanked his medical knowledge about prostate exam.
John kept on rubbing Sherlock's hand, feeling the strong heart pressed to his back. Both of their heartbeats were mixed in a weird drum solo. Sherlock moved his other hand from John's upper arm, roaming it to the doctor's chest, embracing him, pressing him even closer.
“I see,” John moved his face closer to Sherlock’s shoulder, still massaging. Sherlock desperately missed the
or something like that and he really wasn't in the mood for it. But the prospect of Sherlock being in danger was stronger so he grabbed the phone from his pocket and read the message.
"For...?"
John shook his head. It seemed as if there was a voice there, convinced not to leave him alone. It was the same nagging voice that Irene Adler had awaked. He hated it. He hated it because it made him feel... a really
Suddenly, he felt Sherlock's right hand over his left one. With a quick motion, he squeezed it lightly and let it go.
John became aware of how close they were. When Sherlock sat, he did it so very close, even with the plenty of room left at the table. Their shoulders were millimetres apart and their knees were brushing softly.
"At the Yard, I noticed they are password protected..." Lestrade informed them, "but in the state Sherlock is, I doubt he can do it today."
There was no trace of unjustified arousal in the morning. So Sherlock took a shower and got dressed like any other day. Rosie was coming back this evening so he self-imposed to double-check the flat for any possible trace of the aphrodisiac. John was at the clinic so his results were not going to be biased. He was pretty much self-conscious of John’s effect on him – he had stopped denying it long ago – so he took the aloe leaf without thinking about its implications, one of John’s jumper that was on the sofa, went upstairs and threw everything onto John’s bed.
John knew that, if he wanted to leave this behind them, he had to do everything just like last night, even the whispering in Sherlock's ear. If he was asking to this level of detail he had to be very cautious. Any little thing out of place would have Sherlock doubting the authenticity of the nightmare tale. Then he would ask and ask until he had a satisfactory answer... then maybe John would have to explain something going along the lines of '
That's all it was needed. John’s smile always made everything better and that was
"Who are
“Exactly. The camera 0=6=R was yours, it’s the letter D on your door. If you rotate the name, it looks like a stickman holding up a flag and with one knee bent,” Sherlock made the position still sitting, holding up his arms – nearly dropping his tea – and bending his left knee, “We had the names of four cameras, we were missing one.”
"Exactly."
"Bring him up!" cried Sherlock, not bothering in lifting himself from his leather chair.
The first thing he saw was Sherlock, laying shirtless over his stomach, right on the middle of the bed, arms and legs spread to the sides. He had taken his shoes off and socks. The position reminded John of DaVinci's Vitruvian man. Then he eyed the closet, it seemed Sherlock had ordered only half of it.
There was pause on the phone and then Phillip Smith sighed. "Okay then; locate them, talk to Sebastian, the show begins then, Jim. I have the four flats ready for them in Baker Street..."
“She’s good. You should visit her some time.”
...' '
Martin was the first to speak. “How did you know he’s waiting outside?”
"I'm not sure... I was planning France or maybe Italy..." he looked up at Sherlock who was with a lost expression again, "it was really... a pleasure to meet you. I'm going to keep in touch through your blog... or Dr. Watson's... if you don't mind."
John Watson came hard, hissing through his teeth, grabbing the sheets beneath him. His hips were thrusting into his hand and the cool air. His release was all over his stomach and chest... and he realised he didn't care anymore.
Sherlock let out a little snort. "John knows I'm a highly functional sociopath. You should know that too."

"Molly, I really appreciate it, but you know I don't eat while I'm working… it slows me down…"
"Remember when I told you I was having a nightmare?
"To the lab first, I need to check the dirt sample to relieve a suspicion I have... then depending on the hour, I have to go lunch with Molly."
Yet again, John was fascinated; Sherlock usually asked him – ordered him – to get out of the room if he was going in there, but there were sometimes when his thoughts were so strong that John's presence didn't disturb him. And again, John felt
And today, a day after all of that, they could finally sit in silence, at last a complete day of silence and quiet after those two last cases. John giggled when he saw Sherlock playing with the tie pin the banker's family gave him as a reward, a book in his other hand. The tie pin gave laps in the air as Sherlock continued his reading and John continued his scrutiny around newspapers. Sherlock had a satisfied expression as he read the book, but there was also something else, John couldn't decipher it.
And it was all Sherlock needed. He watched the scene from afar, his face with his normal frown. If John wanted him to stop his death that was exactly what he was going to do.
"You have to." John told him a firm tone, making Sherlock's head snap up and look at him, "now... here. Let's stand up..." he added taking Sherlock's hand. Slowly but laboriously, they stood up. Sherlock fell back quickly on the edge of the bed with a bump. John stood in front of him and looked down at the pale eyes. Sherlock looked up, his lips were closed and his face looked as if he was about to cry.
Sherlock smiled again and came back to his original position with his forehead over John's shoulder. "I was right about the drugs."
"Please Amanda, ask Donovan to prosecute this and to talk to the judge; tell her we’re making an appointment for tomorrow morning…"
"It's you and I, you said you and me."
are taking the piss." John shook his head and blinked slowly. Sherlock didn't say a word but just kept on staring at him. That stare always succeeded in making him a little nervous, he knew he was being scanned and read. So he betted for his best resource to make Sherlock think about other things, just because it would irritate him: food.
“Perhaps is not labelled, then.” Sherlock squirmed a bit, not really much point in hiding it if John already knew. “Give it a minute or two for it to go away and…”

he thought. Grabbing the remote he pushed the OFF button. The flat remained completely silent and dark then, only illuminated by the orange glow of the street light outside, right in front of the window.
he wrote again. He mostly found BDSM sites. John’s eyebrows shot up to his hairline on their own volition.
John was fascinated. Sherlock's skin was firm, but soft. There were little, well formed muscles all over his back. Every time he touched certain spots, Sherlock's muscles would tense and relax rapidly.
"All of them?"
… Mr Scott, is it?” She walked around the desk and placed her elbow next to Sherlock’s hand on the mouse. Her white blouse opened up a little at the gesture and Sherlock had to remind himself to look at her breasts’ area and to look distracted.
“Boring.”
Elsie jumped in fear as soon as she saw him, almost falling over the table full of jars with liquids behind her. With quick reflexes, Sherlock grabbed her by her arms just in time, his scarf falling from his face and the remaining liquid of the jar wetting Sherlock’s right sleeve. She started to struggle and Sherlock’s soft chant of, “
"Okay then... what are you wearing right now?" The question was vulgar, Sherlock though, but it wasn't misplaced in the context.
sent at 15:34.
"Are you sure everything's alright...?" he asked, frowning, suddenly worried there was more of the case. The movement of his brows just made his head hurt more.
“Hear that? Daddy!” Steps, swift and small.
The detective was still trying to grab something on his back. John put his hand below the collar of his shirt, he touched the shoulder blades, making Sherlock moan in a very embarrassing way. But thankfully Lestrade was too into the driving to notice. John kept on looking for something, anything, on his back, that could make him figure out what Sherlock was trying to grab. The car reeled like a ship in the sea. Lestrade was a very skilled and quick driver; he had lost already the chasers and they were now into the safety of more crowded roads.

"If you don't tell me where to find them John, I swear-"
intonation, the one of incredulity, of amazement, the one that Sherlock missed, the tone that said without words '
“Let me get this right,” Martin said, trying to put all the pieces together. “You found the names of the cameras because years ago Wilson’s nephew helped Abby to make a software for an illegal business which he, what, knew was going to be illegal?”
Moving out.
Minutes passed by and John couldn't look away. He kept on thinking, staring, observing, even deducing, by Sherlock's nails on his toes, the impeccable hygiene of the man. He could be very untidy, dishevelled sometimes, but he was always clean and worried about his persona. John smiled at that. He was also worried about his hair, he combed it sometimes, he always arranged his shirt before leaving the flat, even after some runs around London.
“Don’t make up excuses for my behaviour.”
His mind palace started to fill up with new data about this, especially when John told him exactly what he needed to hear.
"Urgh..." Sherlock tilted his head quickly and moaned again, clenching his eyes. As he was now completely awake, his mind began to work in a very rapid way, even with the headache that didn't want to leave him alone. John shook his head, he could almost hear Sherlock's mind working and mentally he pictured the scene of a rocket launch.
He saw Sherlock touching himself over his trousers, his open palm moving up and down unhurriedly, a sleepy movement.
“That’s good! Why don’t I give you a few moments so I can show Craig here what the cameras connections are and the models we use? He wanted to know for our new software. Meanwhile, William, you can ask those questions you needed from the staff to Hamish, he’s new, but already knows how we work around here.”
"Yeah, we bumped into each other’s downstairs, a couple of months ago. She asked me, and I said no. We were busy that time, John... and thankfully, Mrs. Hudson didn't insist."
"I'm as confused as you are, Greg." John answered with a groan, trying to stand up, but Sherlock's grip was firm.
“Amazing.”
better, thank you so much for your concern." He hung up and placed the phone back in Lestrade's hand, the fake smile fading completely in a matter of seconds.
He eased the grip on the detective's shirt, hoping to get a reaction from him, but Sherlock was lost in thoughts. John smiled up at the ceiling and shook his head. He lifted his hand to the back of Sherlock's neck and, for the first time ever, John dared to bring him back from his palace. There was a little hesitation at first, but the pained expression on the detective's face convinced him it was a necessary thing to do.
way…" she turned to look at Sherlock again, he seemed absorbed in a paper in his hands now. “Is he single?” John couldn't believe it. Another girl at Sherlock's feet and the detective seemed unaware of it!
John was quiet, he didn't move, he suppressed his desire to grab Sherlock's jacket and pull him closer. He just stayed quietly, watching Sherlock bending over, moving his face to his own. He held his breath as Sherlock's face got closer, so close that it made the whole lab disappear from John's sight. It felt almost like a first kiss. Sherlock's lips lingered above his for a couple of seconds; John could feel, taste Sherlock's hot breath fall over his lips and surely Sherlock could feel his too. Their eyes met and this time, Sherlock closed his eyes first, he moved his face up and down slowly, parting John's lips with his own.
But Sherlock was looking at him, clearly waiting for an answer. His eyes were intense but John couldn’t stop looking at them if he tried. He swallowed. Yeah, where was the seatbelt? Was Sherlock aware of what was going on? Completely?
Sherlock snorted, a bitter, sad smile crossed his lips for a second. His voice was throaty, "I wish I knew."
"If we were to repeat the experience," Sherlock said in a whispered tone, intimate tone, "I'm afraid you would be the one enjoying it the most."
"Mmh! yes...
“Antidote you mean, natural hormones released in climax.”
. And that's what John felt worried about. He was trying to keep his mind busy with work and helped Sherlock when he got home, mostly bringing him food and fixing them tea.
He was about to reply asking what he had been reading to her when the screen showed that Sherlock was typing. He stopped. Continued. John’s heart started to beat faster for no apparent reason. What was he going to write? Sherlock was typing non-stop, now. John’s eyes were glued on the phone; he was shaking. Several thoughts went through his head and he couldn’t explain one of them if he tried.
He thought of James Sholto, then. Of the first time feeling a real attraction for a man. He recalled how his charismatic personality, his determination and his straightforward commands were the ones that had made him feel like this for the first time. Sherlock was enchanting and a nutter but he was also thoughtful and courteous. He also recalled how confused he was to realise how enamoured he was with that man.
Sherlock felt his pulse rising at the proximity of the other man, he couldn't help a little surprised smirk. It was a quirk of the corner of his lips, but it didn't escape John's eye. The doctor seemed reluctant; his walking pace was secure and deliberately slow towards the other man, until he suddenly stopped and Sherlock let out a suppressed sigh. John's lips curled into a little knowing smile. He was almost touching Sherlock's knees with his own, taking him out of his comfort zone... and he was enjoying it far too much.
"Really, I think I should look into it. You're making me worry."
"How could we miss the dates?" Donovan asked softly, gesturing with her hand. Lestrade just sighed and shrugged.
“Four.”
If all of this was part of the aphrodisiacs from earlier, that was something to deal with later.
“Well, I

Sherlock frowned, thinned his lips, he couldn’t part his eyes from John’s face. John had seen that look before. It was a time ago after he had said '
"How can you be cool when you're lying? He was asking about his brother every three minutes! Each time John inquired about something his eyes moved to his right, not to his left; he wasn't looking for something to convince John about a lie but he was clearly remembering facts, facts!" Sherlock made a gesture pointing his index finger to his head, "when you try to deceive someone, usually you seek for something in your questioner or around the room... or wherever for something, anything, that could help you sustain a lie, but he was looking to his right. Obviously! He’s worried about his brother, probably because he thinks we may have found evidence incriminating his brother rather than himself.
“I was under the impression I’m not worthy of
John wanted to fight back, he wanted to regain control of the situation. He
"Sherlock?"
“Hm. Funny.”
With a groan he supported his head between his folded arms in the front and in a matter of minutes he started to doze off again.
"John?" Lestrade called, but John didn't hear him.
"It's an advice, Sherl-"
"I know. I will catch up with you as soon as I finish this." She said tilting her head to her food.
“Oh my God, what are they d-?” John couldn’t finish his sentence, Sherlock’s voice resonated around the flat again.
“Ah, no. Not my bed.” Now it was John’s turn to clarify when Sherlock’s brows rose up. “No, I mean, Rosie sleeps right next to me.”
"I do. I just wanted... to hear your voice for a bit."
The big man paused and then laughed hard. He patted John's shoulder friendly. His left shoulder. It hurt a little but he smiled at the gesture. "You're weird man, just like me." Jack said, "I can't believe him most of the time, but he's indeed quite brilliant."
“Hm?” John was still giggling softly and for once Sherlock didn’t join in.
Sherlock looked over at his face, lips tightly sealed. And Mycroft waited.
Last night he'd told Sherlock he had a date today; it was the only excuse so Sherlock won't be interested enough not to start asking. Not quite a lie either, since he felt this was a date with his mind. Something he should have often, according to himself. If Sherlock could go to his mind palace, he had all the right to go around dating his mind, didn't he? Sherlock had looked at him with a hurtful expression for a second, but then he acted as if that was no big deal. Of course, John had asked for the Chinese takeout and they chatted comfortably whilst eating. Well... comfortably
**..**
said a nagging voice inside his head). He remembered Martin. What had he said to Sherlock, though?
Sherlock scanned impatiently John's face. John held a very apathetic demeanour, seemingly he didn't want to talk, his lips were still placed at the border of the glass. The detective rushed himself to ask "Well?"
Sherlock smirked. That
"I don't want you to be. I’m not a fine china you have to take care of." Sherlock smiled despite his aroused state and John did too as he heard that same phrase he had said before. His lips were attacked once more by Sherlock’s, the detective’s tongue invading John's mouth immediately with a renewed urgency. John moved his finger in and out Sherlock's entrance intensely. The doctor was able to see the frown on Sherlock's face when he accelerated his pace. Sherlock growled as John's other hand moved a little to tease his erection. He pressed then his nose against John's cheek, panting hard, listening to John's gasps in his ear.
"No... Armand. Sherl- Mr. Holmes, breakfast is ready."
"What? Why!"
There, waiting for their food, Sherlock thought intensely about the new case. John was staring, not really wanting to disturb his thoughts. Sherlock didn't seem to mind the stare. When the food arrived, Sherlock just looked at the plate with a blank expression.
"Shower." John pulled his bathrobe off and walked to turn on the water.
“No, no. it’s… fine.” He took a deep breath. “Go on.”
Sherlock froze and turned his back to the mirror. He saw the hour in his phone; almost half past seven. John's alarm would be sounding in thirty minutes.
"I know."
Sherlock was going mad with this, his panting was now intense and his moans and growls filled John's ears constantly. The name of the doctor was on his lips all the time and it came out on sensual, breathy whispers that had John over the edge.
The room was filled now with heavy breathing and muffled moans, both of their sounds combined; perhaps the only way to tell the difference between them was the pitch; John's voice was fairly more high pitched than usual and Sherlock's, as usual, was a mixture.
"I've been given enough reason... retract your involvement with the homeless' gang."
"What did you want?" Sherlock asked softly.
Sherlock's texts, he read them over and over. They were a good distraction after all he had seen at the hospital today. He had to calm a mother whose daughter had died in the accident. They had lost a very old man in surgery, also caused by the accident, and he had been the one to inform the family. He had seen men die before, lots of them. But that didn't mean he was made of wood; a part of him still mourned, a part of him still wanted to cry with the families for their loss. A part of him wanted to shout at the injustice of the drunken imbecile who had survived and, just because he was careless and drank a few more glasses, had killed people.
“How loud are 60 decibels?” John asked in a whisper, walking next to Sherlock and behind Chloe.
"It was good to never see you again too, Mr. Groundsel."
" Jack got closer to John, he startled. He was so into Sherlock that he had forgot about him completely.
“I haven’t.” Sherlock’s voice had turned so light that it sounded a bit like John’s.
The car started and Angelo kept his stare outside until the vehicle disappeared.
"Is this going to be a test?" John smiled against his will. It was incredible how Sherlock inverted the situation. Sherlock was supposed to be the one feeling exposed, but now, with those little words, he was the teacher who wanted to test the student, so John would be the one feeling exposed instead of him.
"Okay..." John raised an eyebrow, "what if
Reluctantly, he walked to take the headphones again, plugging them back to the little wireless modem device.
A sleeping Sherlock was something rare to observe, and soon John found himself staring at him as well. It lasted just a couple of seconds though. He cleared his throat to get Armand's attention.
and his frantic grab of Sherlock’s hips, as if unable to move his hands away from Sherlock’s body.
Sherlock turned again and the mirth in his eyes made John grin.
At the same time, Armand walked to the kitchen, probably to pour tea in the cups, John saw this by the corner of his eye, "Oh, I should warn you, Armand, to check the contents of the-"
"I know all that."
“Speak up, John.” The words were harsh, but there was tenderness in his voice and he knew he was giving away too much. What else was there to hide? “We’re both shite at this, but please… do speak up.”
His trained ear heard muffled, ragged and shaky breathing, the wet sound of flesh against flesh and the unmistakable sound of rustling clothes in a steady rhythm coming from behind the half-closed door of the small bathroom in which he and Sherlock had been earlier. As soon as he came a few steps closer to the place, all of the sounds ceased, turning into a pregnant silence.
“I’m going to move to your legs, alright?” John repeated the process of the slide with a new product and with a grin he said, “I told Abby that you were really fat before, so you supposedly have stretch marks on your back and legs. She recommended castor oil.”
"How long have you been there?"
"Exactly."

. Besides, she was sure John wasn't gay, he tried to clear that up every chance he had. Of course, she noticed the flirty looks he shot some of the nurses, or the way his eyes roamed when she was with light clothes... or any other woman, for that matter. She had tried to see him red-handed checking on a man. But he seemed reluctant to all of them. In Sarah's mind, the relationship John had with Sherlock was unknown. The only thing she knew for certain: it was incompatible to any attempt of a relationship with John.
"Once I'm out you're going to kill me."
"Tell me what you want." John felt Sherlock's lips twitch into a little smile against his cheek at this demand. John's voice was breathy and raspy, almost inaudible but still firm.
, the tone was rude and loud, almost a scream, frustrated. The detective took a big gulp of air and blinked slowly, "I need to speak with the man who visited you this morning." He added, returning his voice to his dangerous lower tone and pointing his index finger to the floor.
Sherlock smirked. "You're not gay." He said simply.
Scenes from the night before replayed immediately in his mind. "Oh God..." His voice was hoarse and throaty and he couldn’t help a furious, quick blush at the memory and felt a tingle in his lower belly. He chuckled silently with a light headshake.
“It wouldn’t do any good to Hamish and William’s relationship.” Sherlock looked up and smiled briefly, John couldn’t help but smile, too. Was that all? No conversations, no apologies, nothing? Should
The photos were composed of a whole gamma of purple, red, blue and green. John got to one which clearly showed Sherlock, various images in which his hair was completely noticeable in an alarming green, his mouth open in mid-speech was black and red, his exposed neck was completely red, his nose a bit purple, and a few things green in the back. The photo was dated to today in the afternoon, almost six pm. John could feel his own blush creeping up his collar.
“We have options.” Sherlock’s thumbs moved over John’s knuckles with so much affection John wanted to scream and have the courage to kiss this bloody man forever. “Because… you know already, don’t you. We can blame it on the aphrodisiacs because we both know what triggered th-”
“That would be the first one in most of the cases.”
For some reason he remembered that time when Mrs. Hudson had been taken as hostage by those American blokes. He remembered the rage he felt and the fear of losing her. He recalled the moment and his heart started to hammer inside his chest, a bit frantic. He also remembered the gun held against her temple and also the relief of his mind, despite the rage and the fear, it was still in order and he had known exactly what to do that time.
“Distract him for me, would you?” she whispered, secretive. “I’m going to try to convince the other one to lower the price. It’s a good offer but it can always be better. Also, you can make sure the tall one gets into the paid VIP section.” Her smile was sure and full of mirth as she disappeared into the hall. Craig jogged to catch up with her.
his head as I lowered mine and we kissed, as it were, by accident. Then, for the first time
As he turned on the kettle, he grabbed two cups from the cabinet, examined the contents out of routine and made one with sugar for Sherlock and the other without for himself. He ate some toast and a salad and turned on his laptop, bringing the cup of tea with him.
"They were looking for it long ago... I just want to expose the truth." for some reason, Armand had started to pant lightly, his breathing was forced and his forehead had a layer of sweat. On the other hand Mycroft was calmed, he only had lost his usual self-control once and now he had this reassured expression again. Armand continued, "Try to understand, I'm doing this for my family. I still believe in justice, my family believed in justice before... but people like you just corrupted them, making them use justice for their own benefit..."
"You can call me..."
"Sherlock..." John said, trying to make himself look and sound serious.
"I never thought I would ever see you... or hear you, calling a hot line." John teased.
“I can’t just reach into your pocket and not be seen by the camera. Not from behind, either.”
That made John snort louder and Sherlock followed with one of his smiles. The noises got louder so now three cameras on Sherlock’s phone had a red dot over them. For each loud moan, they looked at each other and snickered like little kids.
**..**
"It's not stupid, John." Sherlock released John's arm and giggled satisfied, coming back to his sitting position. His legs never left John's lap. "I told you before. The mind stimulation is necessary for body reactions. Now, involuntary body reactions, like tickles, pain, itching... sexual arousal... they are all possible to be controlled by the mind. It's a very simple chemical reaction, like drugs."
to talk to him. There were so many things he wanted to check, to confirm. Why didn't he feel anything with Armand? Was it because he only felt things with John? Or was it just because his pituitary gland... got screwed up after releasing so many drugs with John? Can it
"Your lips look funny when talking upside down." Sherlock snickered at his own comment. He was rewarded with a soft pull of his ear and a chuckle from John.
"All right, okay."
"Wouldn’t you rather sleep in your room?" The doctor never opened his eyes.
"Ammunition?" Sherlock wrapped his scarf around his neck.
felt... and you are also very aware about my body reactions to your closeness, the endorphins I release when I'm with you..." Sherlock never took his eyes from John's, "...and the state we both could- oh!" Sherlock's attention went back to the little notepad in front. His lips still forming the 'oh', despite the sound of his voice had already faded.
He sighed and answered out loud, habit he had for years now. His brassy, throaty voice echoed in the flat.
"So, touch yourself. Now."
“Well,” he said, still blinking and waving a hand, “you never know and there it is.” He cleared his throat and added, “I’m going to see Abby tomorrow with Craig… As William.” He added as an afterthought, he took the phone from inside his pocket. “We’re going to see the databases and all we can get from the cameras.”
“Would you allow me to recite you… the first thing that came to mind when I met you?”
John couldn’t stop recalling how, years before, most of their clients rolled their eyes whenever they saw his partner. This was nice, for a change, even if Sherlock himself hadn’t changed much. Had he? He was quieter, maybe. Happier, definitely. More considerate with a few exceptions, of course, but all in all, same old Sherlock. What had happened, then, with the spurn he was treated with before? Maybe those were changes that only age brings? Maybe the thin lines around his eyes? His reputation? The overconfidence of his steps? His whole demeanour that seemed to say “
"No... no, Sherlock. I can't ask-"
"I was thinking about you..." There was a pause over the phone"... and Molly."
echoed in the place, "...an idea about what you're exploiting... about what you're getting Sherlock into?"
Sherlock cleared his throat but kept up the impersonal way John was talking. “I usually do that when I need stimulus.”
sociopath."He corrected, his voice not sounding convincing at all; he mentally cursed. John didn't show any sign of being perturbed.
“A lot of things.” John couldn’t help but feel the air tense like it had been in the spa. Maybe it was the manner in which he and Sherlock were talking, hushed but clear. “First of all, are you going tomorrow for a massage?”
Sherlock had asked a few questions about symptoms, sleep quality, smell and taste perception with John diligently writing notes next to them and asking a few things himself.
There was a silence over the phone. Sherlock frowned and turned his face to John, who replied with a shrug.
Only moments before two o'clock, Sherlock stepped inside, a few men glared at him but he didn't seem to mind, Sherlock always noticed everything. In his head, he could see white little fonts around every single person inside. He concentrated on Molly's.
"Hey, Sherlock! John!" Lestrade trotted to them, Sherlock observed the troubled man, under the sunlight his eye bags were evident. John also turned.
“You did, didn’t you?”
"Well you might."
John’s giggles were soft at first until they turned into a peal of high-pitched laughter. Sherlock’s chest felt heavy with the wonderful sound, he had never imagined he was going to hear John laugh so much this week.
John exhaled some air through his nose. “Brilliant?”
"No reason."
Sherlock withdrew his arm from John's chest and gave an audibly, annoyed sigh. John was still panting, a hand clung in his chest.
He turned to go back into the kitchen to get some water and aspirins - but a single word made him stop.
Quickly but carefully, he stood up straight, squaring his shoulders right away. He couldn't calm his heavy breathing. Had John been holding a knife in one of his hands, he would look like an assassin who had just killed his victim.
And then Sherlock was on the roof again, throwing his phone and then there was a man knocking him off against the hard, cold floor. And then Sherlock was there again, twiddling an ashtray in front of him, a huge grin on the detective's face.
"You think I care?"
Last thing John saw was the time on the news, around 00:20.
, as Sherlock called his two years disappearance in his mind. But after Mary, things were a bit tenser. This wasn’t simple chemistry anymore, and apparently, they both understood that. This wasn’t just a whim, and couldn’t be brushed off as some simple
John smiled and lifted his gaze. “All right. Sherlock, there are other cameras activated when asked for those services: each studio has two cameras: one with 360 degrees that shows everything, remember the clicks?” Sherlock nodded, John continued, “and one that shows only the patient – the customer – from the chest up with a blurred image. That camera is activated every time anyone signs for an… erotic service. Not the other one. Privacy, she said.”
John had stopped what he was doing, his hand mid-massage on Sherlock’s thighs. Sherlock squirmed a bit, but John was clearly not paying attention. That was the moment Sherlock realised he had an infamous erection pressing against the soft linen covering of the stretcher.
received at 04:45.
"Hang on... I thought those were suicides..."
"I've uh..." John couldn't hold the stare, so he eyed somewhere else and added in a small voice: "I've got a date."
“Seriously, though. We need to save the slides. I closed them all.”
“Well, she had a big smile today,” he said as a greeting with obvious humour, leaving the bags on his chair and smelling around. “Jesus, the flat is freezing- You got Thai?”
Then Sherlock turned to John and nodded.
"So you're going to stay here... resting, whilst I do the dirty work." John nodded with a resigned smirk.
And of course at the answer, John's triumphant smile faded, his expression quickly replace by one of surprise. "But... the noises I heard...?"
Sherlock rubbed his lower lip pensively with his index as he listened carefully at John. He was explaining every little detail, but he never named
And John was relieved; inside, he knew things were going to be the same. Was this what they called... perfection? A crazy partner, with whom he was able to do even the most minimal daily routines – like now – and at the same time, somebody who had cured him, somebody who had completed him in every sense, who had accepted him for what he was without changing anything about him. Somebody he would give everything for. It was overwhelming; to think about unconditional love like that, to feel at home... it made him feel a knot in his chest just to think about that, something moving in his stomach and his limbs going a bit numb.
John’s smile after that had been filled with gratitude and amazement. Had he really thought that Sherlock was going to wake Rosie up at 3am, playing the violin? (Maybe when she’s older to make her come down and play Cluedo when he’s bored. He had to teach her chess, too).
"Oh my God..." John passed his hand over his own face trying to fight a yawn, "... that's awful. I don't even know if I want to know more..."
Craig made a copy of the files. “Come on, come on, come on!” he whispered under his breath as the green bar loaded very fast. It got stuck at 97%. Sherlock held his breath.
"What happened to your date?" Sherlock inquired, there was no surprise in his voice, no expression evident whatsoever. John felt naked, as if his mind was an open book, right there on the table so Sherlock could read it at will.
"How was NOT?" John proceeded, trying his best to sound serious. "If you'd saved your stupid comment last night, we wouldn't be in this ridiculous situation!"
"But you don't want to ignore
Sherlock just walked into the office, took the wallet of the attacker from his pocket and tossed it to the desk, it slid until it reached Mycroft’s hand. The detective sat down heavily; the chair cracked a bit as he crossed his legs and placed his entwined fingers over his stomach.
"Two... patches?"
. He seemed so young with the reactions he was showing, and all because of some texting...
John tried to fight more tears that menaced to fall freely. He tried to concentrate on the people around him. There were a few men chatting across the place. They were around Sherlock's age, and even he could tell that they were handsome blokes,
Sherlock took a deep breath. Who would have thought that this part of his body was overly sensitive? In his mind there was a cold and damp touch, a nose over his nose, a sensation of helplessness as he couldn’t move the touch away, a voice telling him that he would get used to it. Then a glove over his nose. The smell of latex. Mint. Latex. A voice. Insistent. Soft.
"You sure you locked the door?"
Sherlock sat on the edge of the tub again and John took the notepad he usually had in his pocket and started to scribble what Elsie was doing and the time as he usually did when stalking a suspect. He knew the notes would help later.
"Government or justice department?"
The doctor tossed on the couch. The tranquillity of the flat still disturbed him, making him to fall into a slumber slowly, his mind battled between the comical situations today with Sherlock and Lestrade and all of the dreadful case involving the hot line. He had been wondering about Armand the whole day, since in the morning the young man had walked out the flat with firm steps, like he knew exactly where he was going and what he was doing next. He had turned to John before leaving and had shook his hand, with a firm pressure, not saying a word, but the mid frown on his features and the secure smirk on his lips had spoken by themselves.
received at 15:15.
"I don't have to." '
He couldn't help but stare at the scene in front; Sherlock's shirt was almost completely open and it dangled from his slender frame instead being tucked in his trousers as usual. His bare feet and dishevelled hair gave him a very contradictory look against the composed man in front. It was an awkward view for John; he had to admit it was always fascinating to observe Sherlock confronting his brother, he always was taken aback by the way Mycroft could lose his patience with him and vice versa, it was almost like a child dispute every time, even if there was such a serious topic at hand like now.
It was true that his back was hurting after all. The action John had done two nights ago had an incredible effect. He found himself comfortable each time he had to reach something far away from the microscope. Again, not that he would ever assume that out loud. He just made the mental note today in the lab.
Armand smiled too, his lips moved to ghost below his ear. "I read the comments, the communication between you two... oh I'm so jealous of Dr. Watson..."
The recording stopped. John muttered a curse and then, “I need to buy a new memory.”
At that, Armand 's lips got closer and, without being able to control himself any longer, he kissed Sherlock's jaw below his ear, then his neck, softly at first, but then intensely. He pressed his lips against the creamy, fair flesh and parted them slowly. "I will enjoy it, alright." He mumbled against his skin.
Once they were at Angelo's place Sherlock was careful as he got out from the vehicle. Angelo greeted him with a sad smile, he took all of Sherlock's clothes and washed them, washing the blood away. Sherlock took a shower and in that time, he recalled the events from earlier this morning.
“I thought you were going to be here
Now that explained a lot.
John rolled his eyes at his crazy gland-romantic companion, giving a loud sigh and again, looking for the patience he didn't find earlier at the ceiling.
something in him, leaving him depressed and extremely emotional.
“Of course,” Sherlock nodded. “This is all without compromise. If you don’t want to work with us after knowing what we have to offer, just feel free to say so.” Sherlock smiled as sweetly as he could. “We brought the standard ERP software model to show you, if you’d like to see it.”
"I'm still talking about feelings, Sherlock. I
It had been the last day of therapy with Ella. Also the first, but as soon as he was in he decided it was also going to be the last one.
Sherlock's hands gave up and one of them was replaced by his elbow. In the middle of all this frantic movement and mess, he saw John tilting his head back, panting intensely, he felt the fingers digging into his skin, one of John's hand moved between their bodies, taking both shafts, stroking, matching his thrust. Sherlock buried his face in John's neck, nuzzling harshly, kissing, nibbling, his own gasps and moans muffled by the other's skin.
What really caught Sherlock by surprise was the sight of Elsie’s hands being forcefully grabbed by an old man. He started to walk to help her but a younger man assaulted Sherlock from behind.
and that he shouldn't be discriminated against for being brilliant… although he was kind of a dick at times. He remembered Donovan and all of the things she said the second day after he had met Sherlock. That's the way they saw him, then? As a
"Louis!" the man said, taking John's hand and giving it a firm pressure and a single shake, "...this guy here saved my little daughter," he added, tilting his head to Sherlock.
**..**
"I don't know… he seemed fine until he fell off the window."
I picture Armand as Matt Smith, might help the mental image.
"You think he followed you home?"
He turned around slowly and Sherlock's hand roamed all the way to both sides of his face. Making him look up, John's gaze danced over the flushed face in front and lower, taking a hold of the t-shirt and jeans Sherlock was wearing, he looked extremely younger, his erection was evident and his breathing was heavy.
Click.
"I don't know yet, John... Lestrade mailed me today. At the Yard he said this was a
“Is that so,” Sherlock’s fingers brushed John’s nape by accident when John’s hands moved to Sherlock’s collarbones over his shirt.
Sherlock grabbed the remote and turned off the telly. He sighed again.
with this conversation, yes?" he felt it as an alien word. He knew it was the word usually used, but it felt strange coming out from his lips.
After that, both of them left the place and walked home.
"No. Sherlock..." John didn't know what to do. His state was precarious. And what was that sound? Was Sherlock touching himself, right now, on the phone, talking to him? Sure, the conversation had varied a little – a lot – from its original purpose, but to come this far. John was going crazy with the sound and the deep, throaty voice at the other side of the line.
"Found it!" Sherlock yelled, making them both face at him. He held a little bottle of lotion between his shaky fingers. Only half of the bottle remained. John recognized it as the bottle of lotion given to him by Mrs. Hudson when she had the confusion. "John! I won't be loud-"
John gave Sherlock his cup of tea and sat next to him with an expression that only meant
He was doing that when he heard a cough outside the bathroom.
"Sherlock?"
"Of course you didn't..." Mycroft said with a little malicious smile and a short head shake. John rolled his eyes
But his smile faded after a couple of seconds. He had to admit: he was frustrated. There were a lot of feelings going through his mind now but frustration was the most prominent of them all; he was mad at himself for his lack of control this morning, but strangely, he was mad because he liked it. His doubts about his sexuality were ever present, he still couldn't help but lust after some nurses at the clinic, but he also had to admit it was only his body reacting to them. He was certain if a woman would come to him, as it had happened already a couple of times last year, and would offer herself to him, most probable thing is his body would react normally to a female stimulation. But he was also pretty sure that the feelings he had for Sherlock would probably block him halfway... and that terrified him. He loved Sherlock. He knew for sure.
“We did.” Sherlock looked at her now,  “Why the Patricks?” he asked and John looked at him slightly in surprise.
Shaking his head with a wide smile, John walked to Sherlock and took his hand that supported him on the wall. Sherlock seemed glued to it.
The same treatment received chairs, sofa and sink, and soon he declared the zone free of aphrodisiacs. He opened every window in the flat just in case. He sat in his chair, texted Mycroft, checked his email and started to look for a new case. He didn’t realise it was already four in the afternoon until he heard the door downstairs being unlocked and John walking with a few bags from the drycleaners a few beats later.
"And why do you want
Several minutes passed until he finally took his phone and dialled a number.
“Consider it done. But I’ll need more explanations later,” Martin said, his face inches from Sherlock’s.
His right leg suddenly hurt but he was so convinced of what he had to do that he just stepped firmly his foot on the floor, kicking the pain away. A little scene made its way into his brain, the first day he had spent with Sherlock.
"John... God... I can't..." Sherlock spoke to the air now, his gasps were nearly indecent as John circled inside and carefully pushed a third finger. It wasn't easy. All of his focus was on Sherlock face and his expressions. Sherlock told him what he wanted, and John's insecurities about having sex with this man, with this incredible man, went flying out of the window.
"Sherlock, please..."
Greg inhaled deeply, he moved his jaw to a side and exhaled, his eyes glanced down for a bit, thinking. She waited patiently. "Just don't bother him..." he lifted his gaze to her eyes, "he is going to help us, he
' And an answer he had built for hours, for days, perhaps
"That soft makeup is an improvement, though." Sherlock said absently, checking the menu once more.
After a couple of minutes, they hid behind a bush to prevent being seen. Sherlock started eyeing the setting; there was a camera pointing to the entry. Sherlock mentally drew a map with a path to not be spotted by it and get to the back side safe and sound; apparently the facility was less guarded at the back than the front side. John made a gesture to Sherlock with his index finger pointing to the ground, there were vehicles’ tracks marks leading to the same spot Sherlock was thinking about before.
"I was just curious, Sherlock. You don't see a genius every day. Besides... if I was to live with you I thought I had the
At this movement, John threw his head back, moaning Sherlock's name. That sound alone made Sherlock growl deep in his throat.

He loved a man.
John nodded knowingly and pulled the laptop closer, "Mycroft." he added.
to think.
"He... was drunk."
"Sherlock..." John got up from his usual armchair and took the laptop to Sherlock's lap. There was a site with the prices for the supplies for cancer treatment, a big list of plants based chemicals. He sat down next to Sherlock and he moved himself closer to the screen.
"Listen."
the one Elsie Patrick improved - and very skillfully, I must say –” He put three papers on Martin’s hands at this, “– And all of the dangerous components were left off the new chemical formula but some of them were still in the dangerous spectrum when combined with some others, which is exactly what Abby Slaney did when flushing several at the same time, even if they were diluted with a higher percentage of water… hence the water wastes with chemicals in it. You’ve got now all the evidence in your hands. I hope you’ll make good use of it.” He eyed the papers in Martin’s hands and turned to John. “See? I told you we could use the new printer.”
“I get it… but how did you link the photos with the Spa?” John stood to go feed his daughter, but now his voice had
"Is that so?"
"They are leaving Xavier in for an interrogation... I convinced him to bring all of the proofs he had. You told me he wasn't guilty and now he wants to prove it. He is sure he is going to lose his job though."
The detective observed how the man settled on the couch, he closed his eyes and soon his head started to tilt to a side. He was fast asleep within minutes.
"Yeah you do. Now talk!" Sherlock growled out. John heard a loud shout coming from the man. He turned his face to look at Sherlock, he saw how he had the arm in an almost impossible position; the man’s fingers were almost touching his own nape.
“Relax, John. They know you’re a doctor, too. Tired of…” Sherlock couldn’t help a huff from his nose as he felt the vest riding up at the small of his back with John’s forearm. “Tired of sickness, you wanted to try massage therapy for a change, so nothing odd in a little check-up.” John snorted at this, the sound muffled by Sherlock’s vest.
(See the end of the chapter for
He turned his head to Sherlock, who inhaled sharply through his parted lips.
"Can I...?" John motioned to the bathroom behind her, his voice broken. She nodded slowly, her sympathetic smile widening. John entered the little bathroom and washed his face. He stood there some extra minutes, trying to regain his composure back. He looked at himself in the mirror, his attire completely black. John squared his shoulders and exhaled heavily through his nose, returning completely back to normal to the chair in front of Ella.
**..**
John.
He washed himself quickly and stepped out of the shower. He realised he had forgotten a change of clothes, so he put the wet towel around his waist and threw the blue robe over his shoulders. Now the flat seemed warmer. He organised everything in the bathroom and got dressed rapidly. He was ready to start a little experimenting: he had to know what John knew about last night, he had to discover what his mind was really up to and, most importantly, he had to stop the body-stimulating dreams.
John looked at him carefully. His neck was exposed and John saw, almost with horror, a faint, little red mark below Sherlock's left collarbone. He blushed at the memory. He had to look elsewhere and clear his throat to avoid his mind going back two nights ago. It felt like a distant memory, but if he evoked the sensations, they were all there, clear as water; Sherlock's voice, his skin's flavour, the grip on his back and arms, the steady rhythm that he – now knew – Sherlock liked, the amazing eyes darkened by his excitement... everything still there.
"Sherlock?"
"... and it's always sex... sex sex sex..."
"Ah... yes. I told you, I am okay. What time is it?" Sherlock blinked a couple of times, looking outside the window and paying attention to his surroundings. He heard the sounds in the street
To John’s surprise, Sherlock seemed relieved at hearing that.
"Sherlock... would you like to repeat the experience we had over the phone, but this time here?"
"Sherlock."
And at that moment, oddly enough, he laughed shortly when in fact that was the moment when the genuine tears appeared. He wanted to tell John that there was Louis, Jack, Angelo, and many homeless John had never met. He wanted to tell John the plan he had with Molly, that the blood he was about to witness was indeed his own – to pass through any kind of standard procedure about DNA – but taken previously by Molly from his arm, not rushing out of his head. He wanted to tell him to wait for him. That he'll be back shortly, hopefully.
Sherlock picked the lock, walked inside and turned the lights on to discover the same kind of decoration that was present inside Slaney’s Spa, with the exception of showcases full of jewellery.
"About this place, being something like... uh..."
"Well, I read there that even straight men might come if you properly stimulate the outer side of the an-"

"Truth!" Mycroft snorted, clearly irritated by now, "do you even have an idea..." he lowered his voice, it had been rising with each word and now the word
Sherlock's lips involuntarily curved up a bit. His mind was in a rare state of pause, not really thinking about anything but only concentrating on the hand tangled in his curls and the soft breathing of his companion under him. A couple of seconds later, he was sleeping peacefully.
"Mm... damn it." John muttered and sighed. He lifted his hand to the back of Sherlock's neck, he moved their heads closer, supporting their foreheads together. "Sherlock... I just don't want you to... be disappointed or scared... for, you know... whatever happens..."
"That's what you're wondering John. You're not gay."
"You wanted this, John..." he panted, "you said you wanted to
"I think you will find out quite soon, when she resigns... or when she asks for relocation in the Yard." Sherlock’s expression was of little help; it was as if he was talking about the weather.
Drunken people walked silently, a few homeless, he was silent and felt the chilly air hurting his nostrils a bit as he inhaled deeply. He lifted his gaze to the sky and admired the stars. He noticed that now, alone, the stars weren't beautiful as he had commented to John once, now the stars seemed lonely, just brilliant points, all separated from each other, light years away.
"Something is wrong about the painting."
"Please, be my guest." The other said with a fake smile.
, John snorted again at his own thoughts.
"How exact-"
Needless to say, Greg Lestrade enjoyed that little game infinitely.
Once inside the flat, Sherlock took off his coat, his jacket, scarf and disregarded everything over John's chair. He was hesitant; he wanted to go curl on his chair and think. Mycroft knew something else, he felt it in that brief hug, Mycroft never did that. Only possible solution he came up whilst in the cab, after eliminate fifteen others theories, was that Mycroft knew something he didn't. And it had to do with Moriarty plans. And probably someone else was involved. Perhaps himself, or someone close to Mycroft.

for an answer.
"Sorry?"
“Green slide is honey and ginger.” John nostrils flared as if smelling the scent. It was fragrant in the air. “Odd pattern. Did you write them down?”
"So he won't be so loud." Added the DI.
When John’s hands were clearly and surely moving up to massage Sherlock’s upper legs, Sherlock shuddered and sighed audibly. He had been silent, and he really was relaxed under John’s ministrations. So he decided to praise John’s efforts vocally.
Sherlock rearranged his clothes, cleaning himself patting roughly over his coat with his palms, settled the collar of his shirt, jacket and coat and saved the fake ID inside his jacket's pocket. Around them, the only sounds heard were a few cars and a shushed rustling of people moving.
John smiled kindly at Sherlock and, before he could really think about it, he had his hand over the detective's face. He cupped his jaw in his palm and touched the cheekbone, which had him fascinated since the first day. He brushed his thumb below Sherlock's left eye and it flinched a little at the contact.
(See the end of the chapter for
Sherlock frowned and turned to John. He definitely never ceased to amaze him.
John lifted his brows as he observed his daughter and Sherlock in one of their many weird interactions. He frowned as he remembered how Sherlock configured one of his old phones just for Rosie to use, it was full of images of animals, letters, and numbers. He also had configured it (
But he also wanted to run, to disappear. Sherlock's voice brought him back to reality.
"Sir? This just came in." She handed the folder to the DI and waited. John looked at her with evident interest. Sherlock just followed John's gaze and rolled his eyes, teasingly.
There were no words needed as John now massaged the front of his legs.
"Yes." John put his gloves on.
"You're brilliant, John!" Sherlock scribbled on the notepad frantically, John only saw numbers "Incredibly stimulating!"
“Yeah, hi. I’m sorry for not calling first, Mr Holmes. I was on my way home when DI Lestrade called saying you have the pictures of the cameras, so I thought about making some progress in my investigation tonight at home.” Martin gave Sherlock a look from head to toe and asked, “Is this a bad time?”
A loud ring echoed through the flat and John had a mental image of a knife cutting his eardrums. The harmonics of the sound against the wall resonated inside his head, and it hurt. He tried to shut it with a pillow, but the ring echoed again and it served him as a spring to get out of bed.
"I differ from almost everybody."
John smiled at it. Suddenly he felt a strange dash of power. He sighed audibly and moved his hands to Sherlock jean's button and zipper, his back falling back over the bed.
"Sorry but I have to ask. What do you think now... about... you know..."
“Ha-Hamish,” Sherlock said, William’s personality coming easily to him. He cleared his throat and added, “You look good, today.”
Mycroft knew he had to be careful with this man, the name Sebastian already rang a bell. He watched silently as he heard the other's conversation. Italian names rang a couple of bells as well, being
"You came here on your own?" John asked. Lestrade frowned.
"Brain massage," he said in a humorous tone.
Once the coffee was ready John walked and placed it in front of Sherlock who, as always, took it without looking. John prepared a coffee for himself and came back to his place in front of the detective. There was a thick silence between them and John didn't want to talk, he knew Sherlock and the current mood, even he had to admit the case was complicated; the yard had no clue and Sherlock had only a couple of ideas. And John was worried because, even if he chose not to think about it, Sherlock seemed very out of it when he heard the details at the Yard.
"I know you are uncomfortable," Sherlock said with a little smile, "but I promise... at least pizza is... edible." He added apologetically, placing his scarf on his lap.
"Sherlock." John cleared his throat, "if I... asked you to do something, would you?"
“I have five minutes left before Miss Hanson’s appointment,” John answered, turning to his booth.
"Erm… one?"
His eyes opened frantically and he scanned the room quickly before closing them again. There was the mess of clothes next to the closet, the blankets next to him were dishevelled and he noticed he had company last night. After all, he and John had spent the night talking in his room. They didn't touch after everything, they were satisfied and content by just talking, they lay next to each other, looking to the ceiling, shoulder to shoulder, covered by blankets. They fell asleep at sometime as they talked.
Sherlock had to stop at the thumb that slowly touched the back of his anklebone. John was strong. He managed to get both of Sherlock's legs glued to his stomach with one arm, as he tickled that little spot with the other. The detective fought back, desperate, trying to get a hold of John's wrist but couldn't do it. John was impressed; Sherlock trying to fight a laugh was really hilarious. The way his nose wrinkled and his eyes clenched, clearly trying to regain his control back. But after a couple of seconds, Sherlock was breathing peacefully, his nose came back to its normal state and he was inhaling and exhaling deeply. His chest was going up and down, making the buttons of his shirt to tighten and loosen up with each intake of breath. John frowned at him, but kept on moving his thumb there. Then he joined the other thumb at the other ankle. There was no more fighting, only Sherlock's controlled breathing and really concentrated expression.
Sherlock pressed his lips together.
One of the first times they talked, John took a hold quickly on how Sherlock's voice variations said a lot. Almost as much as actual words. Now Sherlock was talking in that purred, throaty voice, letting him know that he had something important to say, but didn't want to rush the issue. John didn't know how to explain it. But most of the time, he could figure a lot from the man in front only through his voice. If Sherlock did it on purpose or not, he never knew.
Sherlock's head faced the door, his bare torso sprawled over the cushions. John looked down, still hands on his hips, next to him.
John smiled. Sherlock giving him lessons on sleeping patterns. He wondered for a moment when had he fell into this dimension with Sherlock as the responsible adult. Besides, Rosie was not a sleeper. She could go to sleep at ten and wake at four and not fall asleep again until six.
“That… if I allowed it to do so, it would…” John supported his forehead on Sherlock’s shoulder again as he continued to read, inhaling a shaky breath and clearing his throat. “It would absorb my whole nature and… and...” He pressed on Sherlock’s arm with purpose as he moved his hand up and down imposing Sherlock’s rhythm on himself. He could feel Sherlock’s ragged breaths that seemed to increase the more he pressed his skin. Inspired, he moved that hand to Sherlock’s waist, finding the hem of his trousers - now loose - and dipped three fingers inside, touching Sherlock’s bare skin over his right hip, applying pressure on the bone he found there.
After the cemetery he took a cab to his old, cold flat. Harry called him again, Sarah called him again, even Jeanette called him once. He returned the call to his sister as he threw himself on the bed, kicking his shoes off. She insisted he should go to her place but no. Now he needed to be alone.
"You have a..." Sherlock brushed the knuckle of his index finger over John's cheek. He followed the pattern of a dry drop, all the way from his right eye to the corner of his mouth "...dry trail of a drop from here to here..." then with his thumb, he tried to make it disappear, even since from the beginning it was barely noticeable. Sherlock opened wide eyes. In his mind the drop remained there. He didn't want it to be there. With the same expression he had when doing an experiment, Sherlock wetted a little corner of the shirt he had in his hand with the water of the bowl. Then he rubbed it against John's face, with hard movements, but gently at the same time. He tried to erase the dry pattern of tear. The action seemed insane for anyone to see, but John knew what Sherlock meant.
"Good... morning...?" Sherlock greeted with a confused expression. They looked at each other and soon there was a burst of nervous giggles.
“That’s… that was…” John looked up at Sherlock’s surprisingly soft voice. “Your therapist would say that was very brave. The
“I’ve been thinking,” John moved to the other bicep again. “If Abby Slaney had something to do with Elsie Patrick, in the past…” John stopped and looked over at Sherlock. Their faces were close, but they didn’t move away. “… I mean, this spa has been opened only for two months. You didn’t find Abby’s records from before that time.”
"Philip Smith?" John asked, eyeing the card in Lestrade's hands. "Armand's father?" he asked.
. Sherlock couldn't place right there why that thought was glued in his mind now.
“Lift your arms for me.”
"Literally."
With a loud sigh, he dragged the bathrobe over his shoulders, making a loosed knot over his middle, grabbed a towel and proceeded to scrub his hair roughly.
“Hm.” Sherlock nodded. “What happened to the previous programmer? You think I can contact him?”

"Obviously."
” on Sherlock’s face.
"Sherlock!" John snapped out, getting closer to the bed. "Sleep! Please. You're making another huge misunderstanding here!"
"We are here, boys. This is as far as I can go." The cabbie said, raising a little his voice to be heard at the back of the car. A loud, dramatic sigh could be heard inside the vehicle; unexpectedly, it was John's. Sherlock withdrew reluctantly of the doctor.
"John…" Again, his name. John was at loss… what to do? His first impulse was to wake Sherlock up and lie to him, telling him he was having a nightmare. The second thing he could do was let him be; everyone has a wet dream once in a while,
“Or testing the products, yeah. We were told the oils are Eldridge’s family business. They own a farm and all of the products are handmade. Over thirty different ones.” John turned to pick a small bottle which featured a blue almond sticker.
"As we always do." She said with her hand firmly grabbing the door handle.
He didn't even sign the mail, so Sherlock took off, he would go there rather texting, he needed something to keep his mind distracted, John wasn't leaving him in peace.
John snorted, sighed and looked up at the ceiling. "I wanted a wife. I wanted kids. I wanted a nice little cottage in the field..."
John had his own theories about the patch. He knew it had been intended to be attached to Sherlock's skin for longer, it seemed as if it was placed far enough not to be seen. Now his biggest fear was; if the patch Sherlock had before had only
be the response she was going to get? Did Sherlock hate to be a father that much? Hell, he was amazing with Rosie, he was sensational! Why would he have that mediocre of a reaction?
"Sherlock..."
“There’s no way to explain my scars to Abby if the random photo goes off, but I’m going to text… Greg. If that medical lotion is so powerful I need to isolate the ingredients by centrifuge. Look at this,” Sherlock passed John his phone, “the grass in the ginger lotion is not from London, nor from anywhere in Europe. I isolated a herbicide that’s no longer used in here, just in some areas from the States. It’s completely harmless in little doses but it
John opened his eyes, realising he was acting much like Sherlock now. His mind was in overdrive and again he wondered if Sherlock always felt this way, the data was flowing from his every pore and he needed something, anything.
Part of this chapter is based in John's line from s02e01: "Oh I should warn you, I think Lestrade... filmed you on his phone"
"Well you see, it's only a rumour as I said, but they say the company is a cover-up for people's black market… especially young women. They are under the department of exotic fantasies... it's uh…"
His mind was vivid and tricky, because as it kept on replaying all that, it went deliberately farther and showed Sherlock the prospect of same hands, with the same touch, running over other parts of his body. His mind showed him how it would be if John's hands went lower, how would it feel to be touched like that in more intimate places, parts of his anatomy John actually didn’t touch.
Martin turned and disappeared from view. John didn’t move a muscle until he heard the front door closing and Martin’s steps on the pavement outside.
, would
“What about
John shook his head quickly coming back to reality.
John supported his back on the couch but Sherlock stayed in the same position, staring at some point in front of him again. After a couple of minutes, in which John struggled to keep his calm, his thumbs rubbing lovingly the other's hand, he dared to speak.
something the great Sherlock Holmes can't actually do correctly..." John sat himself in front of Sherlock, on the coffee table, their knees close. He continued in a very teasing tone, "...and it's to put on a band aid, no less." John had a devilish smirk, Sherlock's expression was very close to a pout.
"Last night on the phone." John exhaled at the comment. Sherlock continued, his changing voice adopted the purr undertone John knew so well. "You were aroused recalling how we were pressed in the alley..." Sherlock arched his back subtly; John's hands, unconsciously maybe, were pressing his shoulders a little rougher "...you wanted me to go on, last night."
"You can't shave this spot correctly, either." Sherlock said, now this time he touched John's Adam's apple with his fingertips, feeling the velcro-like texture of said part. John immediately lowered his head in a desperate attempt to stop the action. "Would you like me doing it for you next time? I'm an expert shav-"
John had also hugged Sherlock twice. The first time at the wedding, after he – according to Lestrade, in a private conversation later – had declared to love and protect John Watson to a whole audience. The second one was after all the ordeal was over, and Sherlock had asked John to “Move back with Rosie, the bedroom upstairs is only gathering dust,” but it was that second hug which Sherlock had committed to memory, since he was able – after a couple of seconds – to hold John back. He had hugged John for what seemed a small eternity, feeling the muscles of his back move under his hands, John’s hair tickling his nose, the forced breathing, the hand moving in slow motion from Sherlock’s elbow to his scapular; John’s hand a constant pressure the whole way. Sherlock’s hands had done the same from John’s shoulders to the small of his back (he had scolded himself for this after, not safe territory for male friends, but he couldn’t help it and John didn’t seem to mind.)
"I live with him." Both gazed locked. The coffee and the tea arrived but none of them seemed to mind.
When Rosie turned to look at him with a frown, offended, John howled, laughter from so deep his stomach Sherlock started to giggle softly, too.
“A second option would involve going to the States and find Miss Patrick’s earlier associations…” Sherlock added after a moment, eyes fixed on the photos.
"Yes. John? Meet Mr. Henry Fishguard." Sherlock said with a comical smile, his open hand pointing the dummy.
He grabbed some Thai before coming back to the flat and as soon as he was inside, he locked the door just in case and started sniffing.
"You like that." John stated as a matter of fact.
But Martin was unflappable.
"Mr. Smi-"
John smiled, pleased. There were such a few opportunities somebody doing something like that and besides, breakfast looked appealing.
"John." Sherlock realised his own voice sounded alienated; the John he was talking to wasn't
John looked up, his breathing still heavy, he allowed himself to observe Sherlock, placing an arm behind his neck.
"If you read them out loud like that, it's actually a bit embarrassing, John."
It was a sure thing Sherlock would bring up the topic any minute today. And John was nervous as hell.
John couldn't help but laugh at that. Sherlock had added a
John turned to fill up the kettle. “Tonight?”
“So you retired and came to protect her.” John shook his head in awe. “You should talk to Elsie.”

's beta-reading is? Thank you so much, dear!
He couldn't go to Mycroft with his hands empty, now could he?
John waited patiently. Sherlock was looking at him with a frown. "Are you...?"
"You had a different definition before."
"Sherlock!" John whispered, exasperated "on the mirror! The cab-"
"That man works for my brother. I don't really know who he is. Remember the man chasing after us?"
"A date." John couldn't help but an incredulous smile.
"What do I write?"
A big bartender walked to them and placed Sherlock's beer on front. Then he yelled, intending to be heard above the noise "On the house!" and pointed to John's beer and Sherlock's. Sherlock smirked quickly and then yelled back "Thanks, Jack. This is John." Jack nodded as a greeting to John and left.
Silence again.
"Yeah..." the DI giggled, "Molly, please... I would really appreciate if you could take all the time you need to test the drug. I will stay here a little longer recording this."
When he read this message, a smile formed slowly on his features. Lestrade took note of this and grinned.
The morning after
After a last glance at the curled up detective, John stood up and walked to him, standing right next to the chair. Sherlock looked up, blinking a couple of times and nearly dropping his cup at the doctor's closeness.
**..**
"Seriously. You're going to reply...?"
"How so?"
[Eyes]
But he wanted this to be finally dealt with. He couldn’t wait any longer. He was expecting a retort from Sherlock, but he didn’t want to look over at him just yet.
. The sound made John smile, it was an amazing sound. The detective was completely relaxed under his touch.
... Who else would call at this bloody hour? He should ask Sherlock to say that in a funny voice, so he could set it as his ringtone... ah.

Sherlock took one and smelled before pulling it to his lips.
"I don't know." Sherlock raised his head slowly, never leaving his position or changing the way his body was glued to John's. Once they calmed down, they became very aware of the way their bodies were lined up in the little space. John was surprised at how well their bodies seemed to synchronise and blend together. They were even panting at the same rate.

"Say it now."
**..**
His mind was so tired that those half-made thoughts couldn’t get to an end. He didn’t want to think much about his own implications. He was still curious, though. Mostly about Sherlock, who was now occupying much of his thoughts. But he nearly always was, anyway.
“We?” John had never mentioned another person.
This thing between them, this opening, this realisation, being just one more of that list.
And, as sometimes happened in these moments, words started to appear in front of his eyes. This time in the shape of an old book, probably forgotten in his father’s bookshelf.
The flat remained silent as she walked downstairs. Sherlock heard a click on her door and lifted himself quickly, walked to the door and locked it without a sound. John was still in the kitchen placing the contents of the tray inside the fridge.
"And you knew that all along…"
"Alright. I'm going to the Yard kids... I will come here tomorrow to check on the laptops... any news, let me know."
