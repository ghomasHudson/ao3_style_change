“Besides,” Continued Dean as they talked about it “We will be known as a business that cares, a family doesn’t end with blood… We’re all in the ‘book’ business, we’re just helping those out who our business affected. It’s all good, we get good staff, they get a job, and the store gets good publicity. Win, win.”
The next thing he noticed was the storybook lady who was sitting in the corner of the store, her flaming red hair making her stand out straight away. She had a book on her lap and was reading aloud to several kids sitting around her. John and Ellen ran over and sat down on some of the large colourful cushions to listen, leaving Dean standing alone awkwardly at the shop door. He looked about him taking in the rest of the store, the other adults, who were no doubt waiting on the children who were now fully focused on how Mr. and Ms. Twit's living room was all on their ceiling. They were either standing above their child or looking through the shelves at the books. He busied himself by pretending to be looking at the books, pretending to turned very quickly into not pretending when he saw a kids zombie pop up book staring out at him from the shelf. He picked it up with a sly smile, thinking it would be a funny idea to buy it for John to wind Sam and Jess up...
,” lied Castiel, of course, he was thinking about being with Dean, he thought about it every minute of every day. He missed Dean’s warm skin beneath his hands, he missed the feel of their cocks sliding together in slick heat, he missed hearing Dean call out his name, missed hearing him beg for him. He wanted that back and he was willing to wait to get it, “I just felt like I wanted to help in any way I could.”
"It was weird sleeping alone after all this time, but yeah. You know Dean, if you need any help with the store opening, you can still always call me."
“Alright, hunny it’s time to fabulize you…”
Castiel looked at him, thinking 'Balthazar has been screwing some guy behind my back, why shouldn't I let the cute doctor flirt with me'. He knew it was far too soon but
“Are you going to kill me?” he asked trying to bat off Castiel’s grabbing hands.
Reading his new message from ‘Shopboy’, he felt his stomach dropping. No wonder Castiel had been so sad today… He read and reread the message, his eyes catching the phrase ‘I was heartbroken’ several times.
His eyes flew open as he was brought crashing back to the present by the feel of Castiel against him. He thought he heard a small sigh from his friend but he couldn't be sure, what he was sure of, however, was that Castiel's hand had tightened on his stomach. Gripping him and holding him closer. Dean could feel his dick move against his ass as Cas shifted slightly...
Dean laughed.
Castiel went to bed relatively early, having to be at work the next morning and feeling tired. He bid Balthazar, who would not be up early as he had weekends off goodnight - he wanted to stay up a while longer and relax watching a film...
Wow Dean"
'Haha that made me laugh, If I wasn't into that I doubt I would be messaging with a guy. Only moved a few things out, still got to go back and get the rest of my stuff. That will be the awkward part, giving her back the key. But that's tomorrow's problem, right now I just want to chill and read the new book I got today. Win67'
“Oh no you don’t… You have me. You don’t need that! We’re going home…”
Castiel had fretted over him for several hours, before finally leaving the bedroom and letting Dean have his space and sleep alone. He’d crept back into the bedroom during the night and sat by the bed, just watching Dean sleep, watching the man’s bare chest lift and fall with each breath. He’d stoked himself slowly as he stared at Dean, he’d bitten down on his lips to stop himself calling out as he’d climaxed into his hand. Carefully, he’d ghosted a come coated finger over Dean’s lips, smiling as Dean made a tiny noise in his sleep.
"Well, Sam can be quite possessive, I'm sure he just took what you were saying the wrong way and then maybe I overreacted. Sorry, Dean. I just... sometimes I feel like Sam maybe holds you back? I want us to keep moving forward... In fact, there was something I wanted to ask you... although maybe now isn't the right time."
“I don’t trust him...”
OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOHhhhhhhhhhh I heard my phone. It’s him, it’s him… it’s… Sam. Great.
Dean sees red “You son of a bitch…” He shouts lunging forward, he pulls Balthazar away from Castiel and throws him toward the door, intending on just getting him out as quickly as he could to help Cas. But Balthazar catches himself before he falls and swings his body around to face Dean.
Castiel tilted his head at him sadly.
“You told him that I’d been sleeping with Dean?” Said Castiel looking unimpressed.
Castiel hears his own sharp intake of breath as his head tilts in question and his eyes find the answer in Dean’s heated gaze. A pause, a hesitation, no more than a second but a second that somehow stretches out longer than all of the eons he had been alive… Then, suddenly, Dean’s lips are on his. His eyes remain open for barely a moment as he desperately tries to process what is happening, to convince himself that this is real.
Castiel read Win67’s message wondering if they ever would meet and get to go fishing, he thinks he’d like to try it. Although he isn’t sure if he could kill and prepare the fish… Maybe he could get away with it he offered to do the washing up afterward… That sounded very domestic though. Almost like a date. Was that what Win67 was hinting at? Now that he’d been single for nearly a month? Interesting…
"Yes," Said Castiel feeling annoyed at Balthazar again "Yes it was, actually"
Opening his eyes again, Castiel picks up the laptop, the charging wire falls to the floor as Castiel strides to the door, his blood boiling with rage and protective instincts. He throws the door open and flys down the narrow staircase, crashing through the door into the pub below.
thinks Dean “Or maybe I should send it sooner? I’m not sure yet”
He turned to Castiel and took his shoulders in his hands, “Never, never change Cas.”
Dean grinned nodding, before looking down at his plate "Well I guess that will be enough for me, for now... Have a nice evening."
"Not bad yourself, James," says Dean with a smile in his voice.
"Yeah," Said Garth smiling weakly "She's really great. Charlie... I..."
“Christ…”
“Hey Lis,” He says stepping off the boat towards her “What are you doing here?”
Castiel had tried to turn into the kiss, but Balthazar was already pulling back, he sighed softly "Good Luck. See you on Friday" before closing the front door behind Balthazar. He walked back to the bedroom, feeling a strange sadness. He knew this book deal was important but he could have done with Balthazar’s support this week. He was too crestfallen to seek his usual self relief in the shower and just washed quickly before drying off on his big fluffy towel and getting dressed to go to work.
Song #50
“Ah, s-slow down.” Mumbles Dean, his face is red and his hands are gripping desperately into the bedsheets, “James? Slow down.”
He got into bed and realized. He hadn't messaged 'Win67' back. Weirdly he felt proud of himself. And hopeful that maybe he and Balthazar would be able to rekindle their romance after all...
“You see what you do to me, you feel that?” Castiel says as he presses down again, “You drive me crazy.”
“Castiel,” pants Dean trying to breathe out the pain.
Dean left Sam's house feeling optimistic and took a cab to the bar he was meeting Castiel and the others. As he got out the cab he shivered slightly, his outfit did little in terms of keeping warm. He put on his helmet, which covered most of his face and walked up the steps to the bar. He saw his reflection and smirked, he looked good.
'I've never been sailing, sounds nice though. I'm sure your car will be taken care of, though I know what you mean. I have something that I was given from my mother, so I understand. My partner left me coffeeless this morning. He should know better. Does that count in the same regards as being fed salad? I hope you manage to make it through your dinner this evening without being offered anything to leafy for you. Shopboy'
OMG OMG OMG fucking breath Dean. It's ok...  You did it. You actually had a conversation with hot guy! Or should I say Castiel?
Dean smiled "Yeah, you like it?"
Dean ignores Balthazar, placing his elbow against the glass, he closes his eyes and draws his arm back, just as a loud bang rattles the door, Balthazar is trying to kick the door in. Dean smashes his elbow through the glass, a shard cuts him shallowly near his shoulder but he doesn’t stop to think about it, barely registering the pain past the adrenaline pumping through him.
Sam looked at her, clearly thinking over her words "I know what you mean, you should know, our goals are to do well, but we don't enjoy putting others out of business it just comes with the job... I hope you know it wasn't personal"
“You told me you loved me!”
“Well, I’m ok… I have something to tell you though… Balthazar came into Winchester Books yesterday…” Castiel stared at Charlie as she explained what had happened the day before.
“TURN!!!” bellowed Castiel his face turning red with rage.
Castiel had got home from work, made a little note to remind him to get coffees for Charlie and Garth in the morning and grabbing his laptop from his desk, allowed himself to be almost swallowed by the squishy armchair in the living room. He rolled his head on his shoulders with his eyes closed, stretched his arms in front of him and sighed. Then he pulled the laptop up into a comfortable position and opened it, waiting for it to load. He had a message from 'Win67' He started reading it with a small smile on his face...
On the twelfth day of Christmas my true love sent to me:
At that moment Castiel realized that half the people who had been enjoying drinks in 'The Triangle' were either plastered against the window watching or coming out into the street, jeering and egging Dean and Balthazar on… He felt sick, how had his ‘fun night out’ turned into a street brawl.
“I know I don’t have, but Dean you’ve done so much for me, I’d like to be able to do something for you… Besides, I’d feel better having someone else there…” ‘
Castiel had meant to go on there to delete his old profile, now that Balthazar was practically moved in, but and he only admits this to himself but the question had intrigued him. It wasn't really a flirtation... not in the strictest sense and Castiel had decided to reply and that's how 'Shopboy' and 'Win67' had started talking.
"I'm gonna go," Said Charlie sensing the awkwardness in the air, she didn't want to leave Castiel with this asshole, but she knew if she stayed and an argument broke out she'd likely only make things worse "I need to get back and change... and shower"
Castiel’s hands move gently, rubbing over Dean’s chest, over his waist, his hips, his fingernails scratching lightly through the hairs on his thighs. He leans down, his nose barely a centimeter from Dean’s skin, he inhales through his nose and breaths Dean’s minty scent in.
“It’s like a damn cock hunters trophy room… Let’s get out of here quickly… Dean? Dean???”
Castiel looked at her, questioningly, "Our show?"
"Because he is dealing with a breakup, and wants a friend to talk to about it," Said Castiel feeling hurt by Garth's lack of faith in him.
Garth looked at Castiel, "Look, man, you know I'm bi - right. I gotta say, coming to work ain't so bad when the boss is you." he blushed, "I mean... you know."
"Huh? No… it’s nothing like that, nothing illegal or anything, I'm not in trouble"
FREEDOOOOOMMMMMM!!!!!!!!!!
"I don't know" Dean looked at her sheepishly "I don't know that I am going to now"
"Ugh, Cas..." Dean breathed out wantonly.
"If you think you're man enough," grinned Castiel up at Dean tauntingly.
"Are you going to let someone else pay for these, this time Dean?" Charlie asked him as they gave their order to the barman.
Not only has 'Win67' seemed to pick up on and not mind Castiel's own mild flirtation, but had responded with one of his own... Castiel's eyes kept wandering back to the words 'craving meat' and 'juicy', they weren't there by accident, they couldn't be.
Balthazar blinked, frowning slightly, "Oh, that. It must have been last night, some guy slipped into me in the takeaway place and I hit the door frame with my shoulder."
"The till?" Asked Dean, wondering what could be so special about a till.
“A little”
Hey Cas. Hope you’re doing alright? Was wondering if you wanted to meet up or go out again some time? x
Dean frowns at Castiel's words, "You think Sam's possessive of me?"
Castiel’s eyes met Dean’s from across the living room of the bunker and he stretched out his arms, “Well?” he questioned with a gummy smile.
That kiss was AMAZING.
Charlie laughed “Awesome. I’ll text you later, love ya”
He needs his legs up in the sky with the devil in his eyes, screaming he wants it all………….
She looked at the two men who were currently rolling around on the floor swiping at each other in a way that might have been comical if it wasn't for the fact that Charlie looked like she had a broken nose... Meg looked to Garth, Jo, and Castiel for answers... "Who's side are we on?"
Castiel smiled, “I understand.” He raised a finger to Dean’s forehead and closed his eyes for a moment. Sending his grace shooting through him to the boy, healing the bruises that littered his body.
"Yum!" smiled Charlie, as she finished her last bite, "Kinda makes you wish we had more bagels." She added picking out a piece of crispy bacon from the tub full Garth had packed in his bag.
The bar is fairly busy, but Castiel can make out Dean Winchester stood just beyond it in the shadowy corner of the room. Castiel would never admit the absolute feeling of satisfaction that had washed over him when he'd seen Deans reaction to spotting him and Luke dancing. The way Dean's eyes had narrowed and darkened, the tiny dimples that had appeared momentarily in his cheeks as he had clenched his jaw or the even more obvious move of folding his arms over his chest in a 'huff'.
"It could go either way - just make it clear you still have a boyfriend and see how it goes? We could come with you?" Said Charlie looking like she'd just turned on a light bulb in her head... "Ohhhhhh that's great actually, you could tell him you and some friends are going out, Friday night and see if he wants to join? That way its clearly not a date-type situation... right?"
Dean had given Charlie and Garth jobs... because Castiel had asked him too... He'd turned up, with broken ribs and dressed in pajamas when Balthazar wouldn't leave… just to make sure that he, Castiel was safe.. 'Holy shit' He thought to himself.
Dean nodded.
“You mean??”
"You've had my attention since the moment I first saw you."
Sam chuckles, “Sure, but if he says no…”
Dean took Castiel's hand from his cock and placed it on his hip, he took his own dick in his hand before whispering, "Cas... Harder... I'm so close. Want you to come."
As a breath rushes out of him, the whisper of the word flys through it and gets lost in the wind, "Dean?"
Sam rolled his eyes “You still haven’t told him?”
"So he isn't straight," said Charlie thoughtfully, "He must be bi."
“No,” said Dean finally able to give an actual answer, “No, it’s not better. It’s…”
“Does he know?” Asked Lisa smiling
"Alright... is it infidelity if you're involved with someone online?" said Castiel watching Charlie carefully for her response.
Lisa nodded before turning to the checkout operator, "Two chicken salads please, and two coffees"
By Song Artist - Counting Crows
Just as Balthazar was going to bring the vase down on Dean’s head… Castiel appeared and grabbed at it, quickly smashing it down on the top of Balthazar’s head with force.
Garth frowned “No way man. She’d know you did everything you could. She’d be proud of you”
Dean looked at him "He wouldn't"
Castiel cringes “I hope not, but it’s looking more likely… But then what the hell is he playing at? Flowers, no note… No, ‘I’m sorry I made a fool out of you for months shagging some guy behind your back, or Sorry I broke your friend's nose? I’m a pig’. No nothing… It’s just weird”
Castiel smiles to himself, not turning back to Dean as he says, "I'm glad you like it." He reaches his cabinet and takes out two glasses, gets some ice from the freezer and pours two drinks, whiskey with ice for Dean and wine for himself. Then he hands Dean his drink and leads him to his bedroom.
Castiel shifted in his seat, these hard plastic hospital chairs made his bum go numb, they were very uncomfortable. His eyes flick over to Dean on his soft bed, his face was so peaceful, the bruises and cuts had faded and healed and it looked as though he was just sleeping, well in a way he was. Castiel leans closer to Dean, taking hold of his hand in his own.
"OK, I admit, it's pretty cool. But it doesn't beat mine" Said Sam jokingly.
Charlies advice was kind of confusing… The ‘do nothing, just be his friend for now’ felt like two opposing ideas. Dean didn’t really know for certain what constituted as ‘doing something’... Was him asking Lisa to meet up with Cas ‘a move’ as Charlie had put it or was it just him being friendly… Either way, he’d asked his ex to meet up with Castiel to give him some help as he started his venture into writing children’s books. If it worked out and Castiel managed to get published, Dean already had it in his mind that he would be placing a big order on Castiel’s writings and stocking them at the Winchester Superstore to help get his name out there, if Castiel agreed of course.
“Good. You must only answer the questions, saying anything else… will be classed as a wrong answer and you will be punished.”
“So the zoo was fun… what’s next?”
Dean blinks, "Yeah..." he says slowly, he is a grown man. He can decide things for himself. Why had he rung his brother last night, if he was unsure of something to do with him and James... the person he should have been speaking to about it was James. Right? "What were you going to ask me?"
Castiel frowns, his hands twitching slightly. He takes a step away from Dean, fighting a war in his head. Dean misses his brother, that is a totally normal thing, isn't it? Castiel should be able to accept that, shouldn’t he?
"Yeah, I've got the kids for him today, did I tell you that?" He asked, looking round at her.
“Getting there,” says Sam, then he nods down to his crutches and says, “Just a bit slower than usual.”
Here, Here!
"Good morning to you too," he says out loud to the empty room, before chewing a fingernail as he waits for the message to load, impatiently.
Castiel stilled behind him, “Say it all, from the beginning.”
What really hit him, was… He liked the store. That was something that was hard to admit to himself. It was nice, there were people sitting and reading the backs of books they were looking at, kids darting in and out of shelving rows chasing each other and smiling… How bittersweet that in the same breath, he wanted to hate the place, he also was glad that there was still a place for books to be enjoyed. With an odd feeling of mixed loss and hope, he left and walked home.
Dean stares at Castiel in disbelief, he is speechless and confused, Castiel looks genuinely upset.
Castiel falls asleep that night with an arm wrapped around Dean, holding him close. Dean lies awake for a while, a feeling of unease refusing to let him drift off. He slips free from Castiel’s grip and treads quietly downstairs to call his brother.
"Dean," Said Castiel, Dean opened his eyes again and looked at him, Castiel moved forward and kissed Dean's cheek lightly, before whispering into his ear, "I find you very beautiful, I would very much like you to be mine... Turn around"
Castiel looked at the last line.. 'We speak everyday' That was true and yet he hadn't even noticed, it was just something that had built up. He closed his laptop without replying, a pang of burning guilt rising up through him.. 'What am I doing?' He thought 'I am with Balthazar and yet I talk to this stranger more than my own boyfriend. I can't get hooked on some guy - who is also not single, that I've never met'.
“Who owns you?”
"Bathroom," Said Charlie. Her head was thumping a little from the alcohol the night before.
Castiel reaches out a cool hand, and cups his cheek, "No. I enjoy you too much. You're like a perfect doll, so beautiful, so delectable... I mean, this is all really your doing, isn’t it? You cast a spell on me and I suddenly can’t be without you. I'm keeping you."
"Done what?"
Sam closed the cab door and Dean watched as the cab pulled away, a feeling of crushing disappointment enveloping him. He looked back at the doors to 'The Triangle' thinking, before shaking his head and walking away down the street.
"Castiel" Began Balthazar through gritted teeth.
Dean squeezed his eyes closed and tried to concentrate. The terror that was screaming its way around his body was putting him off, he's shaking, feeling freezing cold but at the same time sweating profusely.
“You’re so fucking beautiful, Dean. You deserve this, so let go and take it. You’ve been so good for me. I want to see you come apart.”
Charlie frowns at Balthazar, how the hell did he know about Dean liking Castiel? Thinking quickly, Charlie lies “You know what, not that it is any of your business but yeah, they are dating… face it, the only way Castiel is ever coming back to you is if a blast of semen catapults him out of his room and across the street. He and Dean are good together, so fuck off and leave it alone”
"Let him..." Said Michael, sounding bored.
Castiel wakes up in a good mood, he gets up out of bed and takes a long shower, then sits at his desk with only a towel wrapped around his waist and pulls his computer toward him. He opens up a fresh document and begins to list ideas for stories. After half an hour his stomach rumbles at him and he walks into his kitchen, he fills the kettle to make a coffee and looks in the fridge for something for breakfast.
“We actually did it,” says Dean quietly, as though not wanting to tempt fate, “We beat Chuck.”
"Did you see that?" Charlie asked Garth who was messing his hat, he looked up at her.
“Your name is Castiel, you own me and you just want me to be happy. My brother's name is Sam. Sam is not here, you are. It’s your cock inside me, I’m not thinking about Sam and I don’t wish he was here...”
Castiel looked at him, he was still annoyed but his face softened as he heard Balthazar explain himself "I'm sorry too. I didn't intend for it to turn into a drunken slumber party, we were just having fun. Can I make it up to you?"
"I don't think so," she said, "Hope the weather stays nice for you if you're going out on the.. on your boat.”
Garth smiled and helped Castiel dish up the bagels and bacon “I hope so, I really like her… I know it’s a bit quick but I just want to be with her”
Castiel’s expression softens, “I understand, Dean. Really I do, and it will get easier, I promise. I just hope that things of an intimate nature that happen between us from now on, will stay between us? I don’t like feeling like I’m in a three-person relationship, with you and your brother, ok sweetheart?”
Dean had fixed Dale with such a cold and withering glare that he’d been sure the other guy must have received the message. Apparently not though, as when Dean got behind the wheel of his beloved baby and glanced back in the side mirror, his eyes almost bugged out of his head completely at the sight that greeted him. There was Castiel handing over his phone to Dale who grinned before typing his number into it.
"All those in favor of making this a weekly thing?" said Charlie. Garth and Castiel nodded through mouthfuls of bacon.
The next few hours were torture. What if Dean had already remembered him and the police were on their way, right now?
“Couldn’t what?” snaps Castiel straightening up, “Dale is a good man, he is kind, funny and brave. He is a good hunter and my friend.” Castiel narrows his eyes in challenge.
Castiel had been tired. He hadn’t realized just how tired until he’d lay down on Dean’s soft bed and fallen swiftly asleep. He dreamt of the water fight with Dean and Sam. He dreamt of how see-through his friend's white shirt had gone when Castiel's water balloon had struck him directly in the chest... He dreamt about those toned muscles on Dean’s arms and chest. He dreamt of him and Dean being alone in Dean's room, stripping down to their underwear together. All of that had happened, of course, completely innocently. But then the dream went further, images of him touching Dean with his fingertips, gliding them over his chest. Pinching his nipple teasingly, touching him all over, kissing his plump lips...
Maybe, Charlie had sent them? The idea was weak but it was possible, wasn’t it? That his friend had sent them, to… to what? Cheer him up? Had he really seemed that miserable the last few weeks?
Thought Dean.
Castiel had waited for hours with him to get his x-ray and then the results and it had been Castiel who had insisted that they share a cab, Castiel who had text him as soon as the cab had pulled away from Heaven's library, Castiel… who when Dean had first met him had smiled at him in a way that had made Deans knees shake. Who’d thanked him for intervening last night and apologized for Dean getting hurt, even though in no way did Dean blame him.
Charlie frowned at him "Seriously? That's awesome" her doubting frown turning into a big grin as ideas started spreading across her mind as though she was scrolling through Pinterest "Thank you" She added looking at Sam
Castiel looked down at the packet in his hand and then put it back in the fridge, stared at it for another ten seconds before closing the fridge door and marching back over to the armchair where his laptop was calling to him... At that moment though, as if by some kind design by fate Balthazar walked in and Castiel stopped in his tracks thinking, 'Saved by the bell' and turned away from his laptop and headed towards the front door, to where
"If he is your friend and going through a break up.. and you're just going as a friend.. then sure.." Said Garth simply.
“There was nothing you could have done, James. If anything you’re lucky you got out of that house after he ‘let’ you stay there.”
Castiel’s stares into Dean’s lifeless face, his whole body is trembling, his brain hasn’t quite caught up, he can’t have lost Dean… he can’t have. This isn’t real, this isn’t fair...  “Dean…” He weeps, “Dean… you can’t… leave me… Please… Please don’t leave me. I love you…”
Sam was now standing a few steps behind his father, his eyes wide as he looked back and forth between the two men. John was squaring right up to Balthazar, pointing a finger at his chest but just when things looked as though they may get physical, Balthazar folds his arms across his chest and with the look of a man who knows he’s been out played, he asks bitterly, “So, what do you want?”
“There was a fire where I live last night,” Said Dean cutting across his brother, before he let spill that it was his boat “I just got a call… It’s all gone…”
Oh my love, you are beautiful… Fear not… I shall return to you soon.
As Castiel arrived in the hospital with Meg, Jo came to meet them "Garth's got a little cut on his check… it will bruise but it’s basically nothing, they gave him some painkillers and he's gone to the toilet now to wash his face. Charlie is a bit worse... She's getting her nose reset... I don't do well with blood so I didn't go in but maybe one of you could? She erm.. sounded like she was in pain. And Dean's waiting for an x-ray on his ribs"
Castiel decides to indulge the fantasy a little longer, that Dean is here now of his own free will. That he can leave at any moment, should he for whatever reason, change his mind. He shucks off his coat, hanging it on the coat stand near the door. Then, being a gentleman, he helps Dean out of his and hangs it next to his. The fantasy breaks and he turns back to his prey. His captive. Dean smiles at him. It's heartbreakingly beautiful and Castiel wonders... After tonight, would he ever see it again?
Castiel's face felt tight, he looked over to Charlie, he laughed. She looked over to him, a questioning smile on her face.
Leaving Dean to sleep it off on the bed, ties back in place on his wrists, Castiel walks from the room with a big smile on his face. As he reaches the end of the corridor, he hears his phone ringing… Frowning he follows the sound to his room and crosses it to the bedside table. Castiel narrows his eyes at the ringing phone, he shakes his head annoyed and then picks up the phone lifting it to his ear.
'Oh shit' He thought whilst saying "Oh hi"
"It's for your own good..." she said before clicking send...
Sam still has Eileen's phone, so it’s not like he could call her and when they had gone back to her house to look for her, to see if she was back… There was no one there. No sign that anyone had been there. Jack had brought back the whole world… but he hadn’t brought back Dean’s whole world, or Sam’s… and then they had lost him too and despite everything that had happened between them, Dean’s inability to forgive Jack for his mother’s death and consequential attempt to kill him, he’d always still cared, deep - deep down.
“Hey Cas”
“I’m really glad you’re awake,” says Castiel softly as he steps closer to the hospital bed. His eyes travel over Balthazar’s broken body, the casts on his legs, the wires and beeping machines, the oxygen mask over his face. He sees that Balthazar has a handcuff on each wrist holding his arms to either side of the bed, “I thought you were dead...”
Castiel's eyes darkened as he looked down at Dean who was still clinging on to the door handle, with great difficulty as his wrists were duct-taped together. Holding on as though for his life... Funny that the one time he doesn't plan on killing his 'hook-up' they should act like this.
Конфетти это парад! = Confetti it's a parade!
“So?” the barman questioned whilst drying a pint glass on a grubby looking cloth.
He’d spent the next two years working on Castiel, beating him into submission, fucking him senseless, starving him into compliance, locking him up when he felt like it would have been better to just kill him. Castiel had resisted him for a long, long time. Balthazar had explained over and over that they were both angels, that that meant they belonged together, that he and Castiel would always be connected. That no one would ever feel about Castiel as strongly as he does. After a time, Castiel seemed to give in and accept that this was his life and that Balthazar’s word was final.
“You son of a bitch!”
"Is everything alright?" He asked looking from Lisa to Castiel to Balthazar. He did a slight double take at the expression on Balthazar’s face, but it was Castiel who spoke.
"You look amazing Jo!" he said smiling at her.
"To the toilet," he called back, "If that's alright with you?"
Jack is, as he promised, mostly hands off when it comes to human affairs but like Chuck there are some humans he just can’t leave alone, so he’ll check on Sam, Dean and Castiel from time to time. He knows that right now there is a party going on in the bunker like it has never seen before and a part of him wishes he could be there to see Sam and Dean’s faces when they see all their friends and family… when they see Eileen and Cas, but he has work to do.
“I’m not even thinking about
"Good morning my love," says Castiel brightly, he’s just in a pair of grey boxers and holding a camera up to his eye. He takes a picture of Dean whilst walking around the bed, "Did you sleep well?"
Castiel sweeps across the room and cups Dean’s face in his hands, “Not at all. Dean, don’t think that. I’m not leaving to punish you, something has come up that requires my attention, that’s all.”
Castiel woke up, feeling tired and achy from sleeping on lumpy cushions on the floor. He tried not to think of the events of the previous night too much, making himself busy he tidied up by putting the cushions back into story corner and grabbed a black marker from behind the till, writing in big clear print on a piece of card 'Due to unforeseen circumstances the shop is closed today. We are sorry for the inconvenience.' He hung the sign in the window and went to his computer, logging in and chewing a nail as he thought about if 'Win67' had been waiting at the bar last night... what if he had seen the fight?
Castiel got up slowly and wiped his face on his sleeve "Well I feel like a fool, how could I not see what was going on? It seems so obvious now"
Dean looked down at his feet "Either way, I am sorry"
Castiel nodded “Anyway, it would give me great satisfaction to get any advice available from his rival and then get published.”
Castiel follows Dean down the steps out of his house, his eyes dart around wildly for any sigh of Balthazar, Dean seemed to notice and placed his hand on Cas’ arm, giving him a light reassuring squeeze.
There were empty spaces on the walls where Balthazar had hung his photographs and art, bare dusty shelves where Balthazar's books had been, a few house plants gone... All the small touches that made a house a home, Balthazar had claimed the space for... How had he never noticed this before?
Seven Swans a Swimming
“Well, he tried to offer me a job but I just… wasn’t ready… But Garth and Charlie…”
Stupid. Stupid. Stupid. Could have said hello, could have said ANYTHING! Nope, just smile like an idiot as you run past his house… For the fourth time this week by the way… At some point, this becomes stalking…
“Ok, well thank you,” Said Dean “and I don’t know what to say… about Castiel. We’re not...”
Dean looked at Castiel sadly, "James, I don't know what I would have done if you weren't here."
Castiel frowned down at the crumpled list in his hand, how did people find these things for each other and what was the point? This list was utterly ridiculous, he decided as he sighed heavily, rubbing his palms over his eyes. This was stupid, how on earth was giving someone these things considered to be a declaration of true love? Surely, just telling the person how you feel about them would be enough? Which would be fine, if only he could actually muster the braviary to walk up to Dean and tell him… Which apparently he could not.
Dean nodded “Yeah, I’m glad you had a nice day… despite how it began”
Dean's arm came up again to grab Castiel's hand. Castiel's heart was banging against his rib cage with nerves, excitement as Dean guided his hand into his own crotch, Castiel gripped Dean's cock. He heard the little gasp from his friend’s lips. He felt the heat, the thickness, the length of his cock, the moisture at the tip as he began to  stroke him. Dean began pushing his ass back against him again, more rhythmically. It felt un-fucking-real, like Castiel had fallen into one of his dreams, better even. This was real, the feeling, the warmth of flesh on flesh, the smell of Dean’s skin, the noises he made - each and every desperate little gasp.
He pulls his finger out of Dean and grabs his own cock, stroking it a few times hastily and ignoring Dean’s desperate pleas… He lines himself up against Dean’s entrance and locks eyes with the man as slides in, fully sheathed inside Dean, who shouts out in pain at the sudden stretch and intrusion.
A little over an hour later and Dean is loading a heavy package into the backseat of his car, then setting off again to Castiel's house.
Castiel blushed deep red 'now that I'm single' he thought. He looked at the doctor and noticed to his surprise that he had blushed too. He made an amused noise in his throat and shook his head.
"I mean cybersex? Sexting..." said Charlie wiggling her eyebrows.
Dean paled as Castiel shouted right into his face, still pinning him to the wall. His eyes felt like they had dried open, he simply couldn’t look away from Castiel. It was the loudest thing he’d heard in a month, normally Castiel was pretty calm, controlling most of his anger. ‘But, that was when he’d been fucking me' thought Dean… 'He’d had his release and never blown his top.’
"Charlie?" Castiel looked to his other friend.
"Hey man" Dean gave him a polite smile and nod before picking up his drink and taking a swig, he’d planned to just finish his drink and leave. Clearly, Castiel hadn’t quite forgiven him yet and Dean didn’t know how to be around him when he’d made it clear that he still harbored some ill feelings toward him about losing his shop.
His head pricks up at the sound of distant footsteps echoing closer, he feels each step as though someone is tapping them out on his heart. Tap. Tap. Tap. He swallows and shakes his head, trying to wake himself up, make himself more alert. His lips part as he tries to quieten his breathing and listen as Castiel draws near. It’s almost as though Dean can taste him in the air on his tongue.
"Is this okay?" Asked Castiel
"Hello?" came her voice as she answered.
“Holy fuck,” Dean whispers more to himself than to Castiel.
“James!”
Anyway….. I was fucking soaked, covered in dirt and soap… And of course, that’s when Mr.Sex on legs would run passed… He looked over at me, did this weird little head tilt that made the sunlight catch his eyes… Fuck. I knew they were blue… but holy christ They. Are. BLUE.. (No, don’t sigh Dean, Jesus, did you just fucking swoon?)
Fucking no, full steam ahead baby!
real, flesh and blood boyfriend was.
“I got some roses this morning, with no card… I thought, well it doesn’t matter. I asked Charlie if they were from her, but she hasn’t replied yet, so they will probably just be…”
Castiel couldn't believe what was happening, everything had gotten so out of hand so quickly, Balthazar had seemed to lose his mind and where the fuck had Dean Winchester come from? He was helped by Meg to pull Charlie to her feet as Dean and Balthazar continued to insult each other nearby.
"You don't seem to happy about it?" Castiel tilted his head at Garth, this was unlike him, usually, Garth was cheerful, even in the mornings. Castiel couldn’t remember seeing him like this before, it was like his mind was somewhere else completely "Are you sure you're alright?"
“I love you.” Castiel mouths back before shaking glitter from his hair.
“Firstly, so long as there's a fence between us, you can’t stop me from coming. Secondly, I happen to think it’s worth it. I
“And so the hunt begins…”
He pressed send and regretted it immediately, trying to remember if he had ever told 'shopboy' that he was in a relationship with a woman. Annoyed with himself he closed his laptop and went to take a shower. He wondered, whilst washing his hair with Lisa's fruit burst shampoo... if 'Shopboy' would stop replying upon learning this new information. He looked at the shampoo bottle in his hand, shook his head and picked up his Linx shampoo and began to wash his hair again. 'He wondered if 'Shopboy' had assumed that he was gay, but then they had never given any personal details away before 'so really' Dean thought 'It would be on him for just assuming' Then he shook his head again, why was he getting so worked up over the idea that this guy he'd been messaging, who he had never even met - wouldn't reply.
Dean grinned as he walked past his brother, lying his bag and laptop on the table in the hallway “Course, why’d you think I brought two?”
“Three girlfriends and five kids. This little dude's a stud”
Even though he wanted to go home, it was becoming almost normal to be here now and he couldn’t work out when he had started to feel relieved at seeing Castiel come through the bedroom door. He reasons that it must have been during the week after he’d called Castiel a monster. Castiel had returned that day, as promised, with his breakfast, he’d untied one of Dean’s ropes from the bed frame and allowed Dean to feed himself.
“Of course, if your son has gone missing as you claim. Then we will need to first establish that he is not at home and if Castiel Novak has been involved in his disappearance… There is sure to be some evidence of that left behind.”
Dean looks from Charlie to Sam, waiting for one of them to laugh… because this was a joke, right? No one laughed. “Wait, seriously?”
"Yeah, I remember” ‘How could I forget’ thought Dean “Castiel. Right?"
Castiel suddenly had a gut-churning moment where he thought about how to explain to Balthazar who ‘Win67’ actually was. Would Balthazar be ok with it? It wasn’t like they’d been flirting… well, maybe a little. But ‘Win67’ had had a girlfriend until very recently and he knew that Castiel wasn’t single. It wasn’t cheating, it was making friends… right?
"Thank you very much," Casitel said to the doctor as he closed the door behind him before turning to Dean, he took a deep breath before sitting down on the chair opposite him. Dean sinking back into his own chair slowly, watching him. The little waiting room suddenly thick with tension.

He closes his eyes, holding the angel blade to his chest. He thinks of Dean's face...
"What do you think?" Said Dean smiling happily at her.
Lisa shrugged "Lesson learned. It all worked out anyway, didn't it? You two are friends now, Charlie and Garth have jobs and you're on your way to becoming an author"
"Alright, see you guys tomorrow. I'll bring the coffee, you two bring bagels" he added with a nod and a smile.
“That’s very… thoughtful of him…” Mused Castiel getting lost in thought of what a sweet thing that was for Dean to have done for those families. He remembered how grateful he’d been knowing that Garth and Charlie were going to be ok… Now three more families had that too.
I was washing my car… I guess the sex fantasy of being bent over it had something to do that, she was a bit of a mess and I don’t fancy getting fucked into a muddy bonnet…
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-gSWc7TlRA&list=PL-zHYvFyosVv3HfX3tZlunOrOBW3MORXa&index=2
Charlie muttering something about "Not even like I had the usual walk of shame sex the night before"
Castiel looked at Dean, his expression softening "Thank you for saying that, Dean"
"Of course... It's Halloween and we have a lot to celebrate. The shop selling, you two getting new jobs, me being Balthazar free for three glorious weeks. Plus, I may have an idea what I'm going to do now..."
“It’s good, it’s very good, so good,” Dean rambled, urging Cas to continue with a small smile. Blue eyes lit up at the approval, lowering his head to continue. Castiel found his groove quickly, head moving up and down while one hand stroked. His other, free hand, explored under the hunters shirt to scrape greedily at his chest, smoothing his fingertips over Dean’s body anywhere he could reach. Dean was in heaven, he mentally chuckled at the wording, before losing himself in the sensation. His eyes closed tightly and his breaths came out in shudders as he felt himself edging closer.
"It'll just be a few hours Dean, don't be a jerk. If you had gotten them to finish my office sooner it would already be done!" Said Sam over the phone, "I'll drop them off in the morning, OK?"
Garth looked back to the table where Balthazar was now sitting back down, he saw him take the hand of the man who was sat there and hold it in plain sight on top of the table before he turned back to Jo and said, "He is just some arsehole... that's dating my boss." At seeing the confusion on Jo's face he added, "That man he is with... is not my boss."
Castiel resists the urge to be crude and moves the conversation on to books and music, he falls asleep that night feeling much better than he had in the morning and much more hopeful than he had for weeks.
Castiel looked at him again, seeming to be trying to figure him out "Why are you being so kind to me? I spoke to you like shit at that dinner the other evening. I was unforgivably rude"
“I just want you for my own, more than you could ever know… make my wish come true… Baby, all I want for Christmas is… YOU…” With the last word Dean throws up his hand and points out Castiel, who blushes as a dozen or so drag Queens all come running over to him and throwing glitter at him.
"Dude.. you like him? But you know he is with someone, this is so stupid Dean. What if you meet him and like him even more and then can't do anything about it?" Said Sam.
“Castiel?” Dean’s throat feels clogged with fear and he can barely get the word out. He knows instinctively that whoever is in the room with him, is not Castiel. Castiel’s presence doesn’t feel like this, maybe it had in the beginning, but not now. This felt like someone was playing the highest note of a violin and his nerves were the strings.
Sam rolls his eyes “Yes, I know”
But Castiel barely hears him as he is already bucking up wildly into Dean. He supports Dean’s weight with his arms and by leaning him back against the wall and fucks up into him sharply. Snapping his hips forward, over and over and drinking in each shout of pain, each plea to stop, each desperate word Dean says as he drives himself deeper and deeper.
“That’s true,” laughs Charlie, "Ok cool... I have loads of face masks, you want a mud pack one or a pealey dealy?"
Dean stills as Castiel pulls the gag from his mouth, he swallows against the dryness of his mouth and then he is shouting out, screaming out desperately for help… Castiel rolls his eyes, he has explained to Dean that no one will be able to hear him, that he is wasting his energy but Dean is so adorably stubborn that Castiel allows him to shout for a minute before telling him to stop.
Balthazar blinks, obviously unnerved by the fact that this intruder knew who he was. Sam, who had stayed in front of the door as his father had asked, could see Balthazar working it out, that this was not some random home invasion, this was personal. Balthazar's eyes drift between the two men and then widen in recognition, he opens his mouth as if about speak but John cuts him off.
"More drinks?" Asked Jo getting up quickly "Garth will you help me at the bar, please?" Garth gave a little nod and followed Jo toward the bar.
Victor nods, “I thought so and I am sure you wouldn’t mind giving me that explanation on the drive to your farm.”
Doctor Benny shook his head "I don't know, he sounded like the idiot to me. Most likely you were in shock, not feeling dizzy or anything are you?"
Balthazar sucks in a deep breath, trying to get his brain to work and his mouth to form words but all he can do is stand rooted to the spot, shocked into silence as he wonders what is about to happen.
(Inspired in part by a scene from Friends)
“And that is?” Castiel questioned, eyebrow raised, moving forward off the wall and causing Dean to take a step back of his own. “Enlighten me, Dean, on why your judgement is better than my own? On why you think I’m incapable of...” Castiel’s words died on his lips when he noticed the look in the other man’s eyes. At first it was just...sadness, replaced quickly with fire as Dean’s face hardened.
Castiel opens his mouth, ready to argue but Dean gives him a look that dissolves his objections in his throat and instead he settles on “Thank you, Dean… for everything”
Dean looked down at himself as if he needed to check "Yeah. You gonna let me in?"
Dean nodded and made a pained face as he lowered himself in the back of the taxi next to Garth and Jo. The taxi pulled away and Dean saw Cas sink to his knees in the street as Meg put an arm on his shoulder trying to comfort him.
Castiel sighed and shifted slightly so he was a little closer to Dean, “Is it not better?” he asked softly, finding Dean’s gaze and holding it with his own. Damn those green eyes, so deep and beautiful.
Castiel lets out a slight sob and Dean pulls back from him, his eyes searching his face with concern.
Come on, you can do better than that!
to let you come. Then, and only because I love you so much, I will oblige."
Castiel is fighting his way through hell. He kills demon after demon, though some get quickly out of his way too, knowing better than to try and come between him and the human soul he was charged to protect. He never understood why the angels wouldn't let him come back to help Dean until now. He never understood why the other angels allowed him to be sent to hell in the first place, all the unnecessary suffering Dean Winchester had had to endure...
The taxi driver chuckled before adding... "Well don't stop there blonde (He said addressing Jo now) you guys get in here and look like you've been in a bar brawl... asking to go to the hospital... Which is fine, but I need a story to tell the lads back at the office and you guys deffo win the most interesting pick up of the evening. My names Gabe by the way"
Castiel groans against Dean’s mouth and begins to hastily pull his jumper over his head, he tosses it across the floor and then peels his t shirt over his head too. Dean’s mouth finds his chest and mouths hot kisses against his flesh. He pushes against Cas’ shoulders to get him to lay down, his bare back finding the soft fleece of the blanket as he rests against the floor looking up at Dean.
“He never tried to bite me again,” said Balthazar calmly. Dean’s eyes travel from Balthazar’s hand back to the image of Castiel curled up on the floor, he is naked, his face and body is littered in bruising and he is clutching his mouth, from which a stream of blood is running and in that pool of red, lies a bloody molar.
Yeah, holy shit. Amazing… You fuckers have all been holding out on me!
Where before there had been a respectable distance between them, there was now none. Castiel's arm was hanging over Dean's chest and he could feel his warm steady breath tickling the hairs on the back of his neck. An involuntary shudder snaked its way down his spine. His every sense was suddenly on high alert and he realized with a jolt that he could feel the thick, hard cock of his best friend pressing against his ass.
The next step, he knew he’d have to make amends with Castiel’s friends, or at least try to… He was not looking forward to it. He knew that neither Charlie or Garth would forgive him willingly, but he knew that Castiel was the type to appreciate the thought behind something like that. So he’d had the flowers delivered to Castiel’s house that morning and was on his way to Meg’s to find out where Charlie would be. He had no idea what any of them were doing now that Castiel’s shop had closed. He’d figured some kind of expensive gift or shopping vouchers was a good way to go since they were likely unemployed. What he hadn’t expected to see as he’d walked up to Meg’s coffee shop, was Castiel… In the arms of Dean Winchester.
Dean’s hips stutter as he sprays his come over the floor in front of him, there are tears streaming down his face and then… his head sags forward. His whole body goes limp. He passes out from exhaustion and Castiel smiles at him proudly, he unhooks the restraints and lifts Dean into his arms, carrying him back to his room, he lies him on the bed gently and lowers his lips to Dean’s, kissing him.
“Only my pride,” He said with a half smile "I was walking away when he went for Garth and as I was helping Garth back to his feet, he went for Charlie and then Dean appeared from nowhere... I just stood there... like an idiot"
"Ohh? What?" Asked Charlie sounding excited.
"Do you want to take the day off?" Asked Castiel softly.
“You look good.”
"Yeah... Which I plan to drink, while I wait for my fishbowl" Castiel stumbled away towards the bar.
"Hello," said Castiel, walking over to Balthazar and taking a bag from him, "Oh, what did you get?"
Balthazar began bringing home more men, every few months there would be a new 'hook-up' for them to defile and disembowel together. Once he'd gotten over the morality of it, Castiel was good at it.
“Dean?”
Charlie shrugged "It's your call Cas. If you wanna meet him then meet him. But you need to be prepared for anything... like what you're going to say if he does start hitting on you?"
“Dean,”
Dean nods, swallowing his nerves down. He could do this, for James, “Alright.”
"I can wait with you if you like..?" Castiel asked sheepishly.
"How old are you Dean?" Asked Castiel as his eyes flew over Dean's body.
Hmmm, I'm hungry.
Castiel had turned pale "Oh God I hadn’t thought about that... What if he is?"
Garth nodded and began walking away. Charlie smiled at Castiel "Night Boss! Have fun with your mystery messenger."
“I don’t want a lot for Christmas… There is just one thing I need…”
She walked back into the living room and almost slopped the drinks down herself as there was a familiar 'Ping' from Castiel's laptop.
“Yeah, when are we ever gonna get the chance again? It’s purely scientific”
"The fantasy room,"
“You there?” he calls out, his voice hasty and a strange mix of a whisper and shout. Like he doesn’t want his voice to carry too far but hopefully it’s loud enough to reach the intended set of ears.
and a Partridge in a Pear Tree
He clears his throat as he crosses the threshold and into the house. The question he’d been practising over and over in his head all day dies on his lips as his eyes settle on the swollen suitcase at the bottom of the stairs.
Castiel raises an eyebrow, “I think you know. I told you, I’d be as honest with you as I can be… I didn’t want our first time, to be… shall we say, inauthentic.”
Dean’s face split into a wide smile and he suddenly threw his whole body back and laughed. He reached out an arm, grabbing wildly for Castiel so he didn’t lose his balance, he laughed and laughed, until his sides hurt.
“Dean, tell me that you understand?” repeated Castiel.
Dean moves forward and catches Castiel in his arms, hugging him tightly “It’s ok, it’s ok…”
Dean's cheeks burned, "So are you. I didn't really stand a chance, did I?"
"Well, I figured I couldn't be bothered to cook... and you probably wouldn't be either. So... I got us burgers from that takeaway place you like. That ok?" said Balthazar, looking at Castiel, who smiled.
my name. And you will be grateful. And you
Smack. Smack. Smack. Smack.
“Where the fuck is my brother?” counters Gabriel, clenching his jaw and standing his ground.
“I’ll eat,” he said quietly, not looking at Castiel.
'Doesn't discussing boyfriends/girlfriends break the no personal information rule? Maybe you are feeling rebellious after your undesired lunch. Shopboy'
There is another sharp click, as the thing is closed.
"I have to go visit the parentals.. family night," She said with a half smile “So, it’s Friday or no dice…”
Once outside, in the rain and darkness of one of the grimy back alleys by the club, Dean pushed Castiel's back up against wall. Castiel's heart was racing and he was loving every second of it, but acted shocked.
Dean felt a coldness spark inside him that spread throughout his entire body, settling in every vein, every nerve, from his fingertips to his toes, like a shiver of electricity it made the hairs on his skin stand up and prickle.
“You’re going to report it to the police this time, right?” Asked Dean
Castiel smirked before practically skipping away to grab a plate. He piled it high with coconut shrimp and tiny cheeseburgers, as he moved around the table sampling some lovely spicy green thing that he had absolutely no idea what it was, he got talking to someone about how amazing the food was and then noticed... "Dean?"
Fuck. Abort. Abort. Abort… Dean you tit. You finally speak to him… You finally make contact… and that’s how you do it? Basically shouting Hello at him to cover up the fact you were farting… Real. Fucking. Smooth.
He hadn’t bothered to pay for a card with the roses, because… Well, who else could possibly be sending Castiel flowers? No, he’d know they were from him. Just the first step in getting Castiel warm up to him.
Dean had packed up some of his clothes, his laptop and a few other bits he planned to take on the boat. He heard his phone ring and answered.
Castiel gasps out loud as his eyes fell on the beautifully polished and shining brass till. His till, his mothers till… He reached out a shaking hand and gently touched the cool golden buttons…
“Oh yeah, I love it when you talk dirty to me…”
“Well, hem… Goodnight Cas” He says trying to step out of the room again.
"What?" He said absently
Dean looked at him, his eyes burning with heat, his hands already dropping to Castiels pants, fumbling wildly at his zip, "You made your point, okay? I get it." He said as a cold hand reached into Castiel's boxers, gripping his already half hard dick and starting to jerk it.
There is a slightly strange moment that passes between them, Dean stood staring at Castiel hugging two fluffy pillows in his arms, Castiel staring back at Dean with his bag in his hand… and not too far from them… the kingsize bed. Dean’s eyes flick to Castiel’s lips and away again quickly, he clears his throat…
Dean shakes his head, breathing rapidly and trying to keep calm, he doubles over and makes an angry grunt at the floor that sounded something like ‘fucking-what-the-fucking-hell-Fuck!’ whilst punching out at the air wildly. Before straightening up and turning back to face his brother… Much calmer this time he says “I just got a call from the docks… My boat burnt out last night…”
“I brought him here. I spent years shaping Castiel into the man he is today. The man who set himself upon you time after time. I was the one who nurtured each and every dark desire within him that he had tried so desperately to deny.”
His words stabbed through the tension in the air like a sword as he gripped the angel's face and closed the space between them once more, “Well, I'm starting it. Right fucking now.”
John and Ellen ran to the living room and began arguing over who would be the banker in Monopoly. Dean turned to Sam.
Balthazar looked at her lazily "Come on Charlie, we both know you wouldn't drink anything I made for you anyway, right? You're more than welcome to go and help yourself" He said while pulling yesterdays paper off the table and opening it across his knees.
OhMyFuckingGod!!! This guy is too fucking cute… Pound him. Pound him good.
"I, know. Thanks, Charl’s, it’s just… I saw something, something I wasn't meant to see and I don't know what to do about it..." Said Garth quietly, he knew what he should do, he should tell Castiel and it wasn’t even Balthazars threat that was stopping him, well… not completely, it was that Castiel is his friend and he didn’t want to be the cause of any pain… there was also a tiny niggling worry that Castiel may not believe him and he would lose his friendship, maybe even his job.
A few minutes later, Dean pulled back looking wrecked as Castiel came moaning out loudly...
"Castiel..." Began Balthazar sounding resigned "Let's talk about this at home"
Castiel flinched as Dean's fist connected to the side of Luke's face, he honestly hadn't expected Dean to hit the guy...
He actually had an arm around Dean, holding him and his dick was poking Dean’s ass...
“Come on, I think… Well, I hope this will cheer you up” Said Dean leading Castiel to where the Impala was parked… “Before I show you, I just want you to know… Charlie mentioned I think it was at Halloween, how important this was to you… and I wanted you to have it…” Dean blushed “As a… well I guess as kind of an apology for what happened with your store and the role I played in that…”
They start out slow and steady, which is both a frustration and a wonder. Castiel gets to really know Dean, without him being scared or angry. Dean is funny and kind and even more perfect than Castiel had realized before. As his obsession for Dean grows, his patience for the lack of physical contact begins to wear thin. He needs to touch him, to kiss him… to taste him.
“Well, John and Ellen are in the garden at the moment. But that would be great if you kept them entertained whilst I sorted out the turkey?”
"Yeah, I guess so. But I meant what I said last night Dean. I think you are a really good guy... I've been trying to hold on because I'm sure in a few weeks I'll be kicking myself for letting you go..."
Missed him today... Couldn't come up with a reason to be outside other than stalking the local running man... Windows have never been cleaner, the car is gleaming, the grass is to short to mow it again without looking like a weirdo...
"Dude... I'm not gay" Says Dean holding his hands up.
"I'm not angry with you Dean. I overheard them talking about you and I just saw red. I am angry with that uptight snob."
"Yeah, more than I realized apparently." smiled Castiel putting the bag on the table and getting the plates from the cupboard.
Feeling nauseous, Castiel stumbled backward and collapsed onto the floor. His mind was racing, panic, fear, confusion, rage…
Dean folds the lid back down on the box “Well, it’s yours now… Shall we take it up now or?”
OhMyGod! OhMyGod! OhMyGod! It’s hot guys bedroom… We made it… We finally made it!!
is most likely going to put my partner out of business, and then he has the nerve to go into his shop," Said Balthazar coldly, eyeing Lisa with increasing venom.
Dean was stood in front of the mirror, looking at himself, wondering what to do. Staying could mean watching Castiel flirt with the doctor and whilst he wanted to be Castiel’s friend and for Castiel to have fun - hell, he definitely deserved some fun and attention after being with Balthazar, he couldn’t deny to himself that the more he’d gotten to know Castiel, the more he liked him, he knew he’d already had a thing for ‘Shopboy’ and now it was a full-blown crush…
“Ha, good point.” laughed Charlie.
"Cas..." Began Garth and Jo squeezed his hand under the table like he had done to comfort her earlier... "There is something I need to tell you... I should have told you sooner... But... well..."
Castiel smiled and rolled his hips again, allowing himself to enjoy it this time too, it felt fucking incredible, inside Dean, his tightness, his heat, snug and hot around his dick. He rolled again, steady slow thrusts. Enjoying Dean's little noises, joining him with his own before long. The twinge of pleasure in his gut growing and taking over.
“I have to try.” says Castiel, after a moment's hesitation, “I have to. I can’t just leave him there.”
Dean keeps the jacket with Castiel’s handprint in Baby’s trunk, if they ever need to ‘book it’ that last piece of Castiel he has left, is coming with them. Thinking of how close that jacket is, how close that reminder is of what Castiel did, for him, of what he said to him makes his eyes sting and his throat tighten. He swallows down yet another mix of whiskey and coke, eyes glancing sideways to Sam. He is sure that Sam saw him pouring the amber liquid into the slurpee cup but luckily, his brother chose not to comment. Which was good, really, because Dean didn’t feel like defending his actions, yes, they had won. They had defeated Chuck, but at what cost…
Dean moves toward him, the fires of lust burning in his eyes. He leans in slowly, lips parting as they capture Castiel's. Castiel parts his own lips and groans as Dean's soft and warm tongue slides into his mouth, Castiel bites down on it, not too hard but he makes sure Dean feels it as he presses himself against him, crotch to crotch, chest to chest.
Garth was getting ready for his date with Jo, he had changed three times before ending up back in the first outfit he had tried on. He brushed his teeth, made sure he had his wallet and gave himself a supportive thumbs up in the mirror before leaving his flat and making his way down the street outside towards the fancy little restaurant he had picked, he really hoped Jo would like it, and more importantly - him. This was his first date in months and Jo had seemed so nice in the store and she was very pretty.
"That's very tame for you?" said Castiel, looking at her with mounting suspicion.
He puts a load in the washing machine, puts fresh bedding on the bed, hoovers and then starts preparing some snacks for them. At six, there is a light knock on the door and Charlie smiles at him as he lets her in.
“Please, slow down?” Dean pleads with his eyes squeezed shut.
he walks over to the trolley, his hands hover over the items there, lingering for a moment over the hammer before finally, landing on the knife. He picks it up, turning back to the door, he starts towards it, whispering to himself…
Castiel stood rooted to the spot. He knew today was going to be hard, he knew to shut the shop was going to get to him, but he also knew that Dean was genuine with his apology and had gone out of his way to hire Garth and Charlie, not to mention punched Balthazar in the face for him... and even turned up to Castiel's house in pajamas to check he was alright.
Dean’s head feels fuzzy, light and heavy at the same time. He can feel James behind him, his lips pressing down into his skin, it feels nice, so Dean closes his eyes.
"Are you ok?" Asked Dean before he could stop himself "You look a bit stressed?"
And say what?
Dean's eyes had closed at the feel of the man's hands on him. He gasped as Castiel gripped him a little tighter.
Dean feels Castiel holding on to him and closes his eyes for a moment, feeling the warmth of happiness spread through him “You’re welcome, come on let’s get it inside”
Staring straight ahead as though nothing was happening, Castiel stroked and gripped at the meat of Dean's thigh, with each movement his hand inched closer and closer to the other mans crotch.
Come on. Come on. Come on… Pick Me.
"Hey Dean, this is Benny from the hospital..." Said Charlie noticing Dean's return.
Sleep in it, pig.
Who’s side are you on? It’s alright for you either way! You still get touched, played with, you still get yours!
Castiel was so deep in thought about what Balthazar would think of ‘Win67’ that he completely missed the nervous look Jo and Garth had exchanged.
Dean says something through his tight cloth gag and shoots Castiel an angry look, which Castiel ignores in favor of taking a good look at the bump on Dean’s forehead with real regret in his eyes. Dean inches back as Castiel leans in closer, taking his time to examine the purple bruise on Dean’s forehead. Dean grunts again behind his cloth gag and Castiel’s eyes flick down from his forehead to meet his eyes, then lower still to Dean’s mouth. As Castiel drinks in the view of Dean’s pretty pink lips, he slowly scraps his teeth over his lips before sitting back again.
Castiel nodded as they reached the Impala and gave Dean a small smile “I’m sure”
Castiel's stomach turns but he looks back on his screen without answering.
Dean smiled proudly, “And I’m lucky to have you, you are staying, aren’t you?”
Castiel ignores Dean and continues... “And you
look amazing."
Castiel breaks the silence after a while “What were you doing here? Not that I’m complaining… If you hadn’t turned up I don’t even want t-to… think about…” Castiel shakes his head, the echoing feeling of Balthazar’s hands on him, making him shudder.
The days of him leaving sweet little notes were it seemed - long gone. Castiel crossed the kitchen to the fridge - glancing at a picture of himself and Balthazar smiling stuck to the door as he opened it. He grabbed a bottle of water and an apple, before closing it again.
Balthazar sneered at him "Dean Winchester, what the fuck do you want?"
"You fucking bastard!" He heard Balthazar shout and turned to see Balthazar's fist connect with the side of Garth's face, Garth dropped to the ground as Jo squealed. Castiel moved towards Garth to help Jo pull him up, as Charlie, who was completely losing her shit, moved towards Balthazar, her eyes narrowed with hatred, she drew back her arm and slapped him hard, right across his cheek.
Castiel walked over to him and Dean noted how good the man looked in blue. He half rose from his seat to greet him but stopped when Castiel waved his hand slightly.
"I live here," Said Balthazar cockily, getting up from the armchair to face him "Where else was I going to be?"
"Castiel"
though... He was his best friend and he didn’t know if he should say anything to him about it. He didn't really know what to do about this attraction, saying anything to Castiel could spoil their friendship and Dean didn’t want that.
As he turned the corner he heard shouting from further up the street. He looked up to see a man... he recognized him from Lisa's party, that uptight snob who had called him a prick... Castiel’s partner, he realized and his dislike grew even more. He watched for a moment in complete shock as Balthazar punched a red-haired woman in the face, she fell to the ground with a cry and... by the sound of the crunch, Balthazar had possibly broken her nose. Dean's face burnt with fury, he began running towards him.
“Agreed, I’ll see if Cas wants to stay at mine tonight.” Said Charlie “I don’t think Balthazar knows where I live, just in case… You know?”
Garth chuckled and Charlie and Castiel took that as a good sign and relaxed. After he’d finished his muffin, Garth gave the coffee to Charlie saying he was going to try and sleep and that coffee wouldn't help, he left the store and went home.
"This?" Castiel rolled his hips up again to indicate what he meant, he felt Dean shudder against him and he just knew that Dean would say yes. He smirked with proud excitement - Dean was pressed against him, groaning for him and wanted… him.
Dean’s room is empty, there are blood splatters on his bed sheets. A red handprint on the banister. A shattered mirror in the hallway. A bloody knife tossed in the sink. Dean’s bloody clothes in the trash, buried beneath another set of bloody clothes that John kept claiming he had never seen (and that Gabriel wastes no time in identifying as Castiel’s) and then there was John’s bloody belt soaking in a bucket of tinged pink water by the back door.
He'd been surprised that Balthazar had even given him a warning with the way things were between them at the moment. When Castiel had managed to convince Balthazar to let him go, he hadn't actually expected him to keep up his end of the deal.
"Balthazar gets back on Friday though" Said Castiel sagging a little.
“I’ve no idea Dean, all I know is that he’s been sacked, probably the drinking? Lilith said he ‘lost the plot’. Honestly, I don’t think the guys playing with a full deck at this point.” Said Lisa
Dean checked through what he had written, debating for a while if he should delete his flirtation. Then he heard the shower turn off and clicked send quickly and closed the laptop, placing it back on his desk and beginning to look around for his shoes as Lisa came out of the bathroom a towel wrapped around her and another wrapping up her hair. He looked at her, she looked beautiful, anyone could see that. Droplets of water were rolling down her neck and down to the towel that covered her chest... but Dean realized, he felt nothing. He used to love getting in the shower with Lisa when their relationship had begun, but now they showered alone, behind a locked door... The door; he realized, clearly representing all of the unsaid things going on between them. He wondered when she had last been happy with him and who it was that had pulled back first...
It was a year since the ‘incident’, Dean had moved in with Castiel a few weeks after it had happened. After Castiel had insisted that it would help Dean’s nightmares if he wasn’t alone. He cooked Dean’s meals for him, he bought most of Dean’s clothes for him, he lay next to Dean at night with an arm wrapped around him, holding him tightly to his chest. Sometimes Dean would wake up to Castiel watching him and Castiel would always tell Dean that he’d been having a bad dream and that he was watching over him. That he was there for him and Dean would curl into him. Castiel would make slow savory love to Dean and tell him how perfect he was, how beautiful and strong he was.
Sam raised an eyebrow "I knew it, I'd never even heard of this place before... What's going on?"
"How?" frowned Castiel. He knows he should be reiterating the fact that he is with Balthazar, that he is in a relationship and ‘Win67’s’ sexuality shouldn’t matter as they are only friends, but he doesn’t. He is curious.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A9eo-Dgf1EA&list=PL-zHYvFyosVuA1CqxtDvgZq2AH8IGhius&index=8
"You answered your phone... I heard arguing... I didn't think just hearing a row would be enough to call the police... So I called Meg's shop on a payphone, still listening in case I did need to call the police, she gave me Charlie’s number and she gave me your address. So here I am..."
Dean can feel it as Castiel's cock pokes against his ass, slippery from the lube on the condom, he was nervous, well - scared. He knew it was probably going to hurt at least a little, this was his first time after all but he wanted it and even more than that, he wanted it to be with Castiel. He really didn't want this to be a one-time thing either. If they got together which Dean hoped they did, he'd stock up on lube and condoms...
"Why did she even invite him then?" Asked Sam frowning.
“Cas…” Dean’s voice is barely audible as he struggles to form words… “I’m sorry…”
Gabriel laughed, “Dean asked me what he should do for Cas for Christmas… I told him you like drag…”
“Can’t help you, not that I would if I could. But Dean’s not here and I would rather eat literal shit, than speak to you, so…” She turned away from him, but he stopped her with a hand on her arm.
"Really? You gonna let me read it?" she asked, jumping up from her chair in surprise.
The empty moves creepily toward him, it’s eyes boring down into his own with a venom that makes Castiel’s skin crawl. “Every thousand deaths or so, you seem to become a little more aware, you almost sense the Deja vu... you call out, we talk…” The Empty stepped forward again, the trenchcoat forming and flapping as he - it moves forwards “This is… the four-hundredth and fifty-sixth time we have talked.”
"Three more days and we'll be open to the public," Said Dean looking at all the last few empty shelves.
I haven’t had that many dicks up my ass have I?
Before he allowed himself to get lost in it, Castiel breathed into Dean's neck whispering, "Don't let me hurt you, tell me ok? If you need me to stop."
"Call the police. Does he have a key to your place?" Asked Dean feeling awful that Castiel was now fearful to even go home.
Anyways, Dean’s real issue with Dale wasn’t his apparent inexperience in the hunting game, hell everybody started somewhere. No, his issue was that the guy had not stopped gushing over how amazing it was to meet Castiel. He had even had the nerve to squeeze Castiel’s damn arm as though they were friends.
Lisa smiled and put a hand on Dean’s arm “Calm down, we’re friends, right? I’m not accusing you of anything. I just wanted to warn you that Balthazar was causing a stir.”
Dean looks back at the wall, he feels his insides twist horribly as his eyes land on a new image. Castiel is chained to the bed, the same bed that Dean’s been cuffed to for weeks but unlike Dean, Castiel isn’t on the bed, but suspended above it by the tight chains. His face is a picture of pure agony, he’s naked and his mouth is red with dried blood.
Castiel continues, “I understand pet. I do… But don’t worry, mistakes are made to be learned from and I won’t let you injure yourself again, I promise.”
He pondered on how to respond for a few minutes, starting to write out messages and then deleting them again. Before sighing heavily.
He feels a shudder journey down his spine and through his body. He taps the steering wheel of his car, thinking. Turning the key the car comes to life. Checking the car's clock again, Castiel wonders humorlessly what time visiting hours start at the hospital.
Eight Maids a Milking
Castiel sighs, “No, no… You’re right. It was my fault you got hurt last night. I’m sorry, I didn’t realize that you’d regain your strength so soon, I mean it’s wonderful really, how strong you are but I know you’re still struggling with all of this, it is a big change, moving in with someone.”
Those green eyes. Fuck. They were criminal. You could blow up an entire country and blame it on those eyes... He'd do anything to be able to swim in those sparkling green pools. He'd slaughter an entire family, he'd burn buildings to the ground, he'd bring world leaders to their knees... Just for one night with this man... But then no, one night would never be enough. Nowhere near enough. Castiel wanted this man, not to kill, not to butcher, he didn't want to bathe in his blood... He wanted to keep him... to love. To hold him and have him and touch him and fuck him... for the rest of his life. He smirks as he thinks, ‘for as long as we both shall live’.
He should really message him and say thank you for setting up the meeting with Lisa, he’d been so excited to tell ‘Win67’ about it the night before he’d forgotten, so he pulls up Dean’s number and writes him a text.
Fucking worth it to see hot guy run past all wet and breathless… Ok, yeah.. yeah... I need to have some alone time… Like Now.
Castiel unlocked a door and tugged him through it. He looks about him, if he thought he’d been afraid before… it was nothing to how he felt now.
But then he'd be arrested and Dean would slip through his fingers once more... No, he'd just have to wait, keep playing his part as though nothing was wrong...
"Yes," Said Castiel turning... somehow even paler "You know what, I think I'll stay at the shop tonight, he doesn't have a key to the shop. I just don’t even want to chance it, you know?”
She hesitated for only a moment before sagging and saying "It's my book dinner tonight. I just feel a... bit nervous about it"
Christ, I need to get laid...
‘Jeune Amour - Young Love’
Would there be anything left of the young innocent boy he'd met all those years ago?
"You'll live" Came a sing-song voice...
Right.
"True." muttered Castiel, as he bit into a piece himself. Savouring each bite of the salty tasting meat in his mouth.
"Don't worry about it, Dean." whispers Castiel as he lowers his mouth to the back of Dean's neck, distracting him from his confusion with kisses.
"Garth" Said Jo looking at him worriedly “I don’t like this, he is coming here…”
Castiel’s tears fall thick and fast on to Dean’s clothing as he prays for something, for anything to save the most beautiful man he’d ever know, his friend, his love... Dean. “Please, stay with me? I’m begging you, you can’t die.”
"Dude, it's me? You ready?" He heard Sam call
They had battled right up to Sam's bedtime. Sam had grumbled for a good ten minutes, why couldn't Dean let him stay up as their parents wouldn't be home until midnight but Dean had eventually persuaded him, by promising Sam ten bucks if he went quietly.
‘I’ve never caught a fish in my life. I’ve never tried bluefish either, they don’t stay fresh very long and I’ve never been inclined to get up at the crack of dawn to take a trip to the fishmongers, I like my bed too much but whilst I’m happy to get a coffee and bagel from my local cafe, I would like to try it someday. What do you use as bait? Shopboy’
Castiel looked up at Dean, his mouth opened as though he was going to say something, but closed again as his whole body seemed to sag with grief. He willed himself not to cry in front of Dean. Why did Dean have to be so… Why couldn’t he have just allowed Castiel to hate him, to blame him? Why did he have to look at him now with such genuine concern in his eyes, those gloriously green eyes.
“I don’t…” Castiel flounders, Dean is much too close and he has no room to back away… Castiel’s heart thuds, his eyes widen, Dean is still getting closer, impossibly closer. Until his breath whispers and tickles against his cheek, delivering the words he had waited so long to hear, that he had almost given up hope of Dean ever saying them...
"I'm here for your entertainment, you can do whatever you like to me," Said Dean his voice shaking
“I’m fine” Said Dean, but Castiel shook his head and grabbed Dean’s hand pulling him towards the bathroom.
"If this is what I have done to Castiel... Whom I love... What do you think I am about to do, to you?"
“Hi, James,”
His eyes scan over the faces of the crowd at the bottom of the stairs, Charlie and her girlfriend Stevie, Garth and his family, Donna and Jody, Alex and Claire, Bobby, the other worlder's, other hunters, Adam… Eileen. His eyes must have found her smiling face in the crowd at the same time Sam had spotted her, because his brother was suddenly rushing past him and charging, like the giant moose that he is, down the stairs three steps at a time. Dean sucked in a sharp breath that was relief, joy and jealousy all at once as he watched Sam lift Eileen and spin her around before kissing her and holding her to him tightly.
Two Turtle Doves
Charlie turned slightly pink and shook her head, “Can we…” She points to Sam’s office and Sam nods, moving out of the way so that Charlie and Dean could enter. Dean shut the door and turned expectantly to Charlie.
And it’s Balthazar that Sam Winchester is looking for now, after being unable to track down the mysterious ‘James’ the barman had mentioned, Sam had returned to The Lower Angel desperate for more information on the man who had left this very bar over a month ago with his older brother.
Dean looked over to his brother with wide eyes, “Shit, yeah. We should…”
"It's alright Jo, I will just be a minute." stammered Garth eyes not leaving Balthazar's face.
Balthazar had stood frozen in shock in the pouring rain after Michael had hung up on him. He had walked aimlessly through the streets until he had found a bar. That was almost a month ago now, he’d drank more in the past month than he had in his entire life… He’d even gotten into trouble at work for it. His boss had told him, in no uncertain terms that he was on his final warning and to ‘sort his life out’.
What the hell am I meant to do now?
I was just… I wanted to…
"Well, then I won't be leaving Castiel. If you want more than these stolen moments... you're going to have to prove it to me. Otherwise, what is the point?"
Dean sags but it isn’t with sadness, it’s with something altogether different. Gratitude.
Gabriel considers for a moment before saying, “John Winchester will skin you alive if he catches you, you know that right? This isn’t a game, this is serious. If he sees you, on his land, he’ll kill you.”
As Castiel feels himself on the very edge of coming inside Dean, his hands go from Dean's shoulders to his neck, gentle at first... Just feeling that steady pulse beat beneath his fingertips that tell him that his latest prey... is still very much alive. And then he begins to squeeze and Dean is fighting beneath him again, thrashing from side to side and sending him rocketing into release as the man blacks out beneath him... Unconscious, but alive and still so breathtakingly beautiful. This was it, Dean was his now. He belonged to him.
Charlie stared at the car, then the store, then Dean... "That's a 1967 Chevy Impala," She said mind buzzing at a hundred miles an hour.
“When you never turned up to the roadhouse, I got worried and you weren’t answering your phone and…”
“Cas, I know we don’t have to. We don’t ‘have to’ do anything anymore. Chuck is gone, this is just us. Just you and me, making choices for us, for once… Right?”
Castiel takes in a deep breath and meets Gabriel’s eyes with conviction, “Well…”
Pasta is rather a heavy dish… Isn’t it? ;-)
Dean nods “What the fuck am I going to do… all my clothes… everything. Every-fucking-thing…”
“Dale is no threat to me, Dean.” Castiel’s voice is raised in annoyance, Dale was a nice enough guy. Why couldn’t Dean trust his judgement? Anger began to boil, teeth clenching tight as Castiel levelled Dean with another heated gaze. “I don’t understand why you’re acting like this is such a big deal. I’d been in more wars before mankind took their first breath, than you have been in, in your entire lifetime. I’ve taken far greater risks than you can imagine. A simple human hunter is not something I’m new to."
“Think Dean. I told you already. I told you what I want.”
"What? You're just gonna leave?" Asked Dean
"Hey Charlie, are you busy this evening?" he asked. Hoping that his friend was free. It had been far too long since he'd spent time with Charlie outside of work.
“As if” Said Ellen smiling “Me and John are going to win”
His heart turns icy and drops right down into his gut, as his brain immediately supplies answers for the unspoken question,
“I don’t just bring bacon to anyone, ya know?” Smiles Garth glad to cheer his friend up, even if only temporarily.
Balthazar took a step forward, raising an eyebrow before saying quietly "Or else, what? You wouldn't hurt me last night... I highly doubt your friends will even be able to look you in the eye now. Not that it matters, they always were beneath you Castiel"
Ohhhhhhh yeah, that's better.
“You think because you’re not saying anything that I can’t see that you’re upset?” Castiel tilts his head to look into Dean’s eyes, “I can see that you are hurting my love, I just don’t understand why?”
Dean nodded and turned the key in the ignition “Well, he's a lucky guy”
Dean nods, before lying himself down next to Castiel on the blanket, both men turn on to their sides, facing each other, “I’m really ok. I promise.”
“Clearly, I made a mistake. I stopped showing you who you belong to and now… you seem to have forgotten.” Castiel grabs Dean by a tuft of hair and pulls his face up roughly to look at him, “So, this is me, swallowing my pride and admitting that I made a mistake… but I’m going to fix it. I’m going to fix it right now.” He suddenly turns and starts dragging Dean across the floor to the door by his hair.
Dean shakes his head, still looking a little upset but no longer panicking, his voice is barely above a whisper as he utters, “You never say it…”
The look in Balthazar’s frantic face will stay with Castiel forever. He holds his hands over the man’s face for a few moments after his hands drop limply to his sides and when he finally, lifts them Balthazar’s lips are parted in a gasp. His eyes remain open, his body absolutely still, the color in his skin fading already, right before Castiel’s eyes.
Ohhh, chocolate ice cream sounds good…
Balthazar’s nostrils flare, he steps closer to Dean, “What do you think Castiel is doing right now to your brother, Sam?”
Dean watched Castiel arrange the blankets and pillows on the couch “It’ll be fine, thanks Cas”
“Are you still thinking about your brother?” Asks Castiel darkly.
And what did I do? I pretended I was going to squirt him with my hose… Fuck Sake Dean, get a grip, what am I twelve? He’s probably going to change the route he runs now, to avoid the crazy dude who stares - almost fucking drools over him - any time he passes. Ah well, he can’t run out of my ‘spank bank’. ;-)
Dean laughs "Yeah, right Sam. Ok" He says the okay long and drawn and definitely sarcastic.
Castiel squeezed Dean’s hand in his own and turned to look forward, into a future with him and Dean… With only him and Dean.
I’m doing fan-fucking-tastic! This is AWESOME.
Castiel smiled "I'll wait for you Dean"
"Hey handsome," said Charlie carrying a bag of toasted bagels. Followed closely by Garth who also had a bag - but Castiel didn't know what was in it, Garth smiled at Castiel's confused face
“I don’t want to hurt you or ruin that wonderful smile, but if you try to bite me... I will remove a tooth. I will not let anyone or anything, come between us... not even your teeth. Do you understand?”
Dean's orgasm hit him hard, his whole body jerked forward as he squirted his come into the man's hands "Fuck, yes. Yes I want that" He gasped. Castiel smiled, still hard in his own pants, but he could wait... Dean would be worth it.
Fuck Off Rain. Waiting for hot guy to pass on the lawn is bad enough, but now I’m checking down the street every so often from the window… New creepiness level unlocked Dean, nice job.
’ - what would they do, if they didn’t have hunting? He had so much anger building up in him, anger at how much they had lost, how they had been Chuck’s puppets, anger… at himself. If he didn’t get to punch something soon, he’d likely explode, “I don’t know.”
Dean was stood on the curb of the street clutching his side as he watched Balthazar walk around the corner at the end of the street and out of sight. He glanced at the Castiel and his friends, suddenly feeling very out of place, he was after all putting most of them out of a job.
"Yeah?" said Dean cautiously, sensing trouble in that all too sweet and innocent face.
On-shon-tay my little inner tube of love...
“Lonely?” Supplied Castiel.
Stand by for total bowel evacuation... Five, four… three…
Meg's mouth hung open as Castiel pulled himself together enough to say...
Castiel’s driving into the city, Balthazar’s driving out of it, both have murder on their mind… It’s not looking good for the Winchesters.
“Sleep. Jack is going to create a heaven for the empty, it’s own personal, sealed, soundproof and dark place to sleep.”
My man! What a player! And just like that, we are back in the game. Nice move chief.
Charlie and Castiel talk late into the about Win67, Dean, and Balthazar, about Charlie and Meg’s relationship which had started as them just having fun but had now become exclusive. They talked about Garth and Jo and about how they hoped Jo said yes when Garth asked her to move in with him.
Castiel smiles half-heartedly at Dean “Thank you… I know you think I’m doing you a favor letting you stay here… But I really am glad for the company”
"Well if you came home at a decent hour..."
Dean pulled a face and blew a raspberry at his brother and both the kids laughed.
I broke my mower trying to clean it… Fuck.
"It's alright Dean," Said Castiel softly standing up from his leather chair and taking a step toward to Dean "You can tell me the truth"
“What? No… You should take the spare room… You’re their family” Said Castiel surprised. He already felt like he'd been imposing on a family occasion, he didn't want to inconvenience Dean further.
“Right. That and chefs are aggressive little fuckers… Although you shouting that his food tasted like a case of the squints after curry night probably didn’t help...”
Dean was really going for it on the stage now, dancing around and singing loudly, encouraged by the sight of Castiel smiling up at him. The crowd of drag Queens  next to the stage were screaming and cheering for him. Egging him on.
“Wouldn’t dream of it, Bitch.”
Dean picked up his beer and took a long swig from it, glancing over his shoulder back at the angel and the vampire. Who now seemed to be sharing a fishbowl cocktail.
Every nerve in his body was on fire, electrified with tense excitement, close to fear but not quite that. Castiel kissed Dean's shoulder, feeling bold. He knew Dean wanted his hand on his dick... But what was this, exactly? Two friends helping each other out - but... 'No homo'? Or something more...
"Huh? Oh.. yeah, Jo’s great, but that's not why I didn't sleep" Said Garth in a quiet voice.
Charlie looked at him wondering if he could feel her dislike "Balthazar" She said curtly before pulling the blanket back up and over herself.
"Hi," He said sleepily, sitting up and accepting the scalding cup, he placed it carefully down on the bedside table to wait for it to cool and looked back up at his partner.
The distance between them was slowly closing.
Sam picked up the kids after finishing setting his office up. He smiled as he thanked Dean lifting a shopping bag up and retrieving a large pie from its depths. It was a sweet cherry pie which Dean had nearly ripped from his hands when he saw it. Wanting to spend some quality alone time with his pie, Dean returned to his boat quickly. He devoured the pie greedily, letting out a low moan of pleasure as the first taste touched his tongue. The pie, he found, really hit the spot and his full stomach made him sleepy.
"You fancy him, don't you?"
He walked out of his front door closing it behind him, wondering again where the roses had come from, there were a few options, maybe Dean although, highly unlikely. Then there was Win67, which was slightly concerning, how would he know where Castiel lived for starters? Then there was Balthazar, which was even more concerning… Castiel shook his head at how messed up things were that it was preferable to have been sent roses by a stranger he talked to online than his ex… Then, there was Charlie.
Dean looked up to see Castiel walked back over to the group "Not really" He said solemnly.
“Ok, well. Thanks for letting me know, we hired a temporary security guard for the shop this morning, starts this afternoon and Sam’s gone and bought all the staff headsets, that way they can communicate with each other and let someone know if something dodgy is going on. I’d feel kind of smug about him getting sacked if it didn’t mean he suddenly had much more time on his hands, fuck knows what that guy is up to!”
"What, Dean?" He asked stunned. Benny thought there was something between him and Dean?
“And make sure that that guard knows, that Balthazar is barred from the shop”
Castiel grabs Dean’s arms and pushes them into the wall above his head, he slams his lips against Dean’s and Dean stares at him in shock as Castiel kisses him, forcing his tongue into Dean’s mouth, Castiel's eyes are closed. Remembering the threat of the pliers, Dean fights the urge to bite down, instead, he focuses all his energy into going completely lax, stilling against the assault on his mouth. His eyes watering with emotion when Castiel pulls away, looking if anything - more pissed off.
Castiel is reading over his notes for his writings, checking and editing. He looks up when he hears a gentle knock at the door and sighs as he places his laptop on the table closing it and standing up.
"Hello," said Jo, looking from him to Garth who was still speechless.
Was he really going to let this gorgeous doctor leave? He glanced at the table where Meg, Charlie, and Dean were stood... He looked at Dean, who seemed to be really focused on pulling the label of his bottle of beer, Benny thought that Dean had been checking him out? Castiel thought back to their conversation in the bathroom... It wasn't possible, was it? That Dean Winchester had a crush... on him?
Turning to lock his doors and drops his keys close to the front tire on Sam’s car. A quick side glance left and right confirms there is no one nearby and as he crouches down, his gloved hand dips into his pocket and pulls out his pocket knife. His other hand also gloved rests on the top of Sam's front tire. He leans over slightly and feels his way behind it for the brake line...
Castiel smiles to himself and they both go back to watching the old cartoons that are playing on the television in silence.
Castiel looked at him, it reminded him of how Charlie had turned up in her pajamas... He smiled.
“Well, anyway he helped us out of a tight spot that night and I don’t really know, from there we just became friends…” Castiel couldn’t work it out in his head now he was thinking about it… Why had Dean intervened in the first place? Why he’d stuck around afterward… Surely, a broken rib was punishment enough for his efforts? “He was really rather gallant”
Castiel sighed sadly, his guilt making him turn away from the child, “I’m afraid I can not. I must return to my duties. I wasn't supposed to come here tonight…”
“I’ll have a Cappuccino thank you”
“Are you sure this is where Dean wanted to meet?” asked Sam with wide eyes as a man wearing tight leather pants passed, giving him a flirty wink and an eyebrow wiggle.
"Because he is single now," Said Garth still looking unimpressed
“Maybe first time lucky?” Hummed the lady showing him around.
“Ok, we’ll stop… however,”
Castiel feels himself on the edge of rejection and pushes in quickly, “Ahh-”.
Dean shouts out and even against his gag, the word ‘No’ is clear.
“Yes?” say Victor, raising an eyebrow at John.
"I'm fucked either way, right?" snapped Dean, "Not going to make this any easier for you."
Dean’s face was red. Red with blood from the wound hidden in his hair. His chest was scraped from where his body hit the ground. His wrists were still cuffed together, the skin beneath them had been peeled raw where they had rubbed. The towel that had been wrapped around him was now being bagged up and a silver sheet had been laid over his body to keep him warm. His neck, like Sam’s, was fitted with a brace.
Dean smiled softly “Love you too, Lis and when you get a new fella I’ll be sure to call and give you some tips” Dean laughed to let her know he was joking.
"I know.. I like this guy, we've been talking online for a while, but it has been just friendly talk and he is meeting us here with some of his friends..." Said Dean
Castiel remembers feeling his heart break when he played the first tape, the day after Dean had left. A simple slow love song, that Castiel had listened to everyday for two weeks before moving on to the next tape. He wanted to make the tapes last, he wasn’t sure when Dean would be home, he wanted to spread them out.
“You’re welcome. I know Dean feels guilty about his role in your situation and wanted to help, I really hope this works out for you”
Sam hangs up, he tosses his phone across the room, it lands with a thump on the couch. He walks to the window and stares down at the city as it wakes up as if hoping to spot Dean.
John shook his head at his tipsy wife, still smiling, "Buying your mother the convertible she's always wanted tomorrow. You get the Impala, take care of her. You hear me?"
"Ah-ah. We already played that game... Now, you can let go... Or I will have to make you let go." he warned.
Dean heard himself say "That guy you were talking to?"
“Let me go.” says Dean finally opening his eyes to look at Castiel, “Just... Let me go.”
"Ugh," He says "I feel gross"
“I’ve been working up to it,” he says weakly, it was about the only thing he could muster at being caught off guard with the angel's statement. He doesn't know what he was expecting after the kiss, probably some chick flick moment where they kiss again and all that had happened before would be forgiven. He was just kind of winging it at this point. His heart had finally won control now instead of his brain. “I’ve-It’s more like-"
He drained his bottle of water urgently as his mouth seemed to have dried up completely as he finally accepted what Benny had said... Dean did like him, or at least he was 99% sure he did.
The snow outside is light and fluffy in the greying sky, the fireplace in front of him crackles and pops with flickering flames, warming his toes beneath his thick socks. He pulls the fleece tartan patterned blanket around him and lets his eyes slip closed as his husband’s voice washes over him. He remembers trying to convince Dean - repeatedly, that his voice was beautiful. He remembers how shy Dean had been about it at first, he smiles to himself as he remembers Dean presenting him with a box of tapes, because of course Dean wouldn’t use a Cd.
This turned out to be a mistake as the sky opened up above him halfway back. The rain beat down around him and he shuddered against the cold as he walked quickly back to his boat, he really needed to find an apartment soon, winter was well on its way and it would be getting very cold at night.
He reached the front door and picked up his silver case, he turned back and began to walk with furious determination towards the spare room. He had work to do.
He picks up a pen, a note pad and begins...
"Whiskey," says Dean following Castiel toward his kitchen, "Nice place by the way" he adds looking around at the artistic paintings on the walls.
Dean's eyes widened as Jo went on. "Balthazar has been "working" for a few days this week... but that's only if you believe a word the man says. Anyway... We were all out for a few drinks tonight, and Balthazar text Castiel saying he was going to join us... So we had to tell him about what we had seen before Balthazar turned up... Castiel wanted to leave but as we did we bumped into Balthazar and it all kicked off"
'I understand. I hope you are alright? Don't worry about me, I never made it into the bar, got caught up with some other stuff. I was actually just going to message you to apologize. I'll still be here if you ever need to vent. Sorry about your boyfriend treating you that way. You deserve better. Win67'
Eleven Pipers Piping
"Well, it's better than prick.." Said Dean shrugging.
"Castiel"
‘Not really. Dwelling on sad things only makes me sad, it happened and there is nothing anyone can do to fix it. I just needed to let myself feel it as I think I was putting it off. I do feel better now though. Been getting on with some other things and took a long bath. Shopboy… Maybe I should change my handle now… Shopboy isn’t exactly accurate anymore… Shopboy’
"A Winchester Super Store opening soon." read Castiel aloud, he sighed, "I'd heard rumors, to be honest. Aren't you late?"
Castiel puts the pad down on his desk, he downs the last of his third bottle and he places it beside the bed. He brings out his angel blade, a tear falls from his eye as he thinks about his deal with the empty... He knows where he is going, to a place with no Dean, with no family... With nothing.
‘Hello, Dean. I just wanted to thank you again for setting that up with Lisa yesterday, it was very helpful. Cas’
And Castiel knows, he can't just go out and kill him, it had to be done in a way that wouldn’t lead back to him, if the police suspected him, they’d find Dean. They'd take him away. If the media suspected him, he couldn’t ever let Dean find out that Sam was gone. For if Dean ever did find out, eventually, he would discover that Castiel had been involved, he’d never love him then. He’d never forgive him.
“Who the hell are you and what have you done with my brother?” Laughed Sam
After everyone had had breakfast, plates of pancakes stacked high and topped with blueberries and raspberries, Castiel had thanked Sam and Jess for their hospitality and gone to wait for Dean in the Impala. Sam had told Dean not to do anything stupid if he came across Balthazar and after Dean had promised he wouldn't, he and Castiel had left to drive to the police station.
Dean shakes his head, ready to object but then Castiel’s hand slips between them and grips their cocks together and Dean gasps out loud. Castiel is jacking them together, faster and faster and Dean’s eyes close again, against his will. His body betrays him as he moans.
“Dean… I’m fairly certain you broke her nose…”
Castiel puts the paddle down on a table nearby and pulls his shirt over his head and throws it away from him, “What’s my name?”
I have no reason to be outside… I guess I could mow the lawn, although I only did it last weekend… Maybe I could clean the mower? That’s a thing people do, right?  Makes um last longer or some shit?
“Pfft you love me,” Says Charlie “So, what you thinking… Balthazar?”
"When will your car be fixed, by the way, we have that dinner tonight?" she asked.
Dean’s jaw clenches when the sound of Castiel zipping up his bag signals to him that the angel was done packing. He was going to be walking out of the bunker any minute, he’d get into his hideous car and drive away. Away from Dean and toward Dale, into the opposing hunters arms more like it. Dean rolled his eyes so hard at the thought, gritting his teeth and willing his jealousy to go away.
The truth was, that he did like Dean, but something born from the rejected kiss attempt bothered him, his embarrassment at his own behavior and the fresh memories of Balthazar’s betrayal had sent him scurrying to protect himself…
The relief Castiel feels is immense, the monster, finally put down. Out of his life, forever.
"He isn't really my friend," Said Castiel quietly and without thinking, but he followed him out of the door anyway...
Holy shit. He gave me his number… I should text him, right?
“I don’t think so, from what I understand he was a great writer, a loyal brother, a doting uncle and a generous man. He was also massively intelligent. Did you know, he left behind the first draft of his book - you know the one I’m talking about, don’t you? The one that you stole?” John paused for a moment to watch Balthazar squirm, then he continued, “Unfortunately by the time that Martha found that first draft and his suicide letter - they’d been hidden away in her own house - you’d been published. You were already making a name for yourself, you had much more money than her family - she didn’t think she could take you on.”
Fury flickers across Balthazar's face "A good man? He stole your business right from under you?"
Whispering praise in Dean’s ear.
Charlie's smile widened "Yes... Got my Queen gown all puffy and ready to go. Meg is coming as a demon"
He frowned as he made his way over to the door, wondering who it could be.
Actually… erm.
“I won’t be scared out of my own house, no. Thank you though, really. But yes, Friday. You’re still coming here?”
Chill out, he’ll be back!
“See you shortly, my love.” Dean hears the footsteps move away. Before Castiel even reaches the end of the corridor, Dean feels the speed increase on the plug in his ass and he pushes forward against his chains, crying out. Then it clicked again and the speed went back down.
Dean's eyes closed and his mouth went dry. He licks his lips worriedly, had he been the one who had moved, was Castiel awake? Was Castiel aware of how close they were now…? Of where they were 'touching'? What should he do? Panic tore through as he contemplated his options quickly... Wake Castiel? Just move? Press back into that inviting warmth? Do nothing? What would Cas do? Would he be freaked out by this?

Even as he and Garth and Charlie finished packing away the last of the books from Heaven's library, he couldn't bring himself to feel anything negative towards Dean, thinking of the conversation they had had when Dean had shown up in his pajamas that day...
“Calm down, Mr Novak.” says Victor. He steps forward with his eyes on John’s shirt, “I’m sure that Mr. Winchester has a perfectly good explanation for the red stains on his shirt and his bruised knuckles. Don’t you Mr. Winchester?”
Thanks to the images on Dean’s phone, Castiel spots Sam’s Dodge Charger parked up outside the motel near The Lower Angel right away, carefully he parks his car in the space next to it. He waits for a few minutes to make sure that there is no one else about, before he gets out of his car, closing the door gently, quietly.
Castiel woke with his hand on Balthazar's waist, he looked at his shirtless back and began to trace circles with his finger into his boyfriend's warm skin, stopping when he saw a bruise on Balthazar's shoulder. He frowned at the mark, it didn’t look too painful, but he didn't even know Balthazar had hurt himself.
Oh. Bold move. I like… Get him back here, get the wine flowing… Seduce him with your cheesy pasta bake. ;-)
“Do you want to stay here, Dean? Really?” Castiel looked away from the child, it hurt to know what the boy would choose would lead him to a hard and painful life but Castiel had to at least offer him an escape anyway, he had to try.
"You have been making a fool out of me for months," Said Castiel, he wasn’t actually sure how long it had been, but when Balthazar didn’t deny that it had been months Castiel’s eyes started to water with renewed sadness and anger.
Balthazar leans closer to Dean, “He is a pretty thing, isn’t he? Sam? Such wonderfully youthful pliant skin…”
“Hey! No. You don’t get to do that, you don’t get to pull that shit with me, trying to make me feel guilty.” Snaps Dean finding his voice. He glares at Castiel, "You brought me here, kept me here, you've abused me and now you're trying to make me look like the bad guy for not kissing you and acting like everything is fine? I don't think so... You're the monster, not me!"
“No problem, gorgeous.”
Castiel eyes Dean for a moment, grins and plants a kiss on Dean’s cheek before climbing back off him. “Now, you have to eat… I’d rather not force-feed you, but I will do whatever it takes to keep you healthy Dean, so… What’s it going to be?”
Castiel laughed, “You know what… with Meg… I can see it!”
Castiel’s eyes scan the bar, they pick out the door that leads up to Balthazar’s flat above the pub.
Ohhhhhh fuck. Hot guy is topless. Hot guy is topless. Hot guy is topless. His t-shit is sticking out of the back of his shorts and I am dead… Restarts brain… Today he had earphones in, wonder what he was listening to? Wonder if I should put music on outside… Something… suggestive. Shut up brain.
Castiel’s Crotch gets all the attention, all the time, it isn’t fair. Yeah ok, I’m nervous,  I’ve never been touched in the way that Dean’s Asshole has… hell, I’ve never even been kissed…
Fuck his eyes are so damn blue and beautiful… I could just get lost in them for… Oh, right he is waiting and I’m just stood here with my finger on his lip like a weirdo… Ok…
Castiel turned on the radio, he’d been checking it every hour, for news of the accident, each time it was mentioned they seemed to have a bit more information, never the names of those involved but stories were forming and Castiel could fill in the gaps that other listeners could only speculate about.
"Is he... straight?" she asked, looking stunned.
“Ça sent bon”
Charlie shrugged "Guess I missed that class" She was looking at Dean, watching him watch Castiel before turning away and sitting in thoughtful silence, sipping her drink.
“No! Sam!?” he shouts out helplessly. But he already knows it's too late, the two vampires begin to drag Sam’s body away, leaving a thick bloody trail behind them.
Dean gritted his teeth. Thinking how stupid it was that he hadn't yet revealed to Castiel that he was 'Win67'. Thinking that maybe if he had, it would be him sharing a fishbowl with him instead of this sexy doctor. Of course, it could have gone the complete opposite way and he might not have been invited out tonight at all, the truth was he wasn't sure how Castiel would react, sometimes he debated telling him at all...
entre...
ho-ly shit.
Dean blinked at her, he hadn’t seen her this worried about an event in a long time, taking pity on her and truly wanting them to be able to be friends he said: "If you are sure you want me there?"
How long has it been since I saw my beautiful? How long will it be before we met again? What if I never see Dean’s Asshole again? How could I ever be happy with anyone else’s asshole, now I’ve already experienced perfection… How cruel it is to be able to taste that sweet bliss and then be dragged away from it…
Balthazar clicked a button on the projector and a new image flashed up. This time, it is a picture of Castiel bound and bloody in the trunk of a car. Dean turns from the image to Balthazar with parted lips, eyes wide, hands shaking.
Castiel laughs.
She blushed now and Garth knew (thanks to Charlie's knowledge of hitting on girls) that that was enough for now. (Charlie's voice rang out in his head - 'compliments are good, but overdoing it can be a real buzz kill, go in with one strong confident compliment and then leave it for at least an hour - so you don't overwhelm the girl.)
to die. This is good, Dean, really good... because I find much greater joy in taking the life of someone who wants to live.”
Charlie scoffed at him, pulling her arm away from his grasp “Does your ass ever get jealous of how much shit comes out of your mouth? You cheated on him and you attacked Garth. Why the hell would he want you back?”
Ah fuck.
“Because angels don’t just go around answering all the prayers they hear and helping people whenever they ask for it. There are rules, I broke them to come here but I had to, I had to make sure you were alright.”
‘Hey… I’m Castiel…’ Ugh… ‘Hi, I’m Cas…’ Fuck sake… ‘Nice car…?’  Great Castiel, that’s just great… He’ll probably think you’re casing the place to rob him… ‘Hey… You’re fucking gorgeous and I was wondering if you were into guys, cause I’d love to be in you’ Haha. Castiel you are a dick.
“I’m staying at his tomorrow night, I’ll tell him then, it’s going to be easier to explain it face to face”
Mariah Carey - All I Want For Christmas Is You
“Hey look, there is a bar here, let’s go and sit in here for a bit… Maybe I’ll get to see what’s so great about whiskey, Dean loves it… Me? Not so much on the way out”
Now that Dean and the man's hands were free the man stretched a hand out towards him with a smile, "No problem. I'm Castiel, I own this store."
He stopped right at the end of my drive, for a moment… I thought he was going to say something… But he just re-tied his trainers, smiled and ran off again… Nice view of his ass when he bent over tho =)
"I'll get you a bottle," Said Benny moving away towards the bar. Castiel caught Dean's eye and mouthed 'Sorry' to him, Dean gave him a small half smile in response. Castiel then followed Benny to the bar and Dean’s smile slid off his face.
This note is just in case you notice something doesn't quite seem to fit, you know that I have (hopefully) gone back and edited that small bit for future readers.
'Looks like I will be home an hour or so earlier than I thought, I could come and meet you? B'
(See the end of the chapter for
“We?”
Castiel stands up, glances around him to make sure there are no unwanted eyes on them. He places his hand on Jack's clammy forehead, he squeezes his eyes shut tight, willing his grace to heal his boy, to save his son…
Castiel found himself wanting to ask ‘Win67’ to meet up. For some reason he’d kept putting it off, was it fear? Had Balthazar ruined his trust in people? Or was it something else… Like how sometimes, when he went to message ‘Win67’ he’d think about Dean… And what Benny had said. He’d put off looking too closely at that too. He still wasn’t sure what he felt for Dean… Yes, Dean was good looking and kind… But he was still the reason Castiel was out of a job, but the store hadn’t just been ‘a job’ though… It had been his last connection to his mother and losing the store, felt like losing her again. It hurt on a deeper level. Coupled with the break down of his relationship with Balthazar, it had made him feel rather lonely…
Castiel pulls out and tugs at Dean’s side to get him to roll over, then he buries his face in Dean’s crotch, sucking his cock greedily until Dean comes with a shout, his hips jerk upwards and the head of his dick hits the back of Castiel’s throat. Castiel swallows and then pulls his mouth from Dean’s dick and leans over him, kissing his way up his chest, “You’re so fucking perfect, Dean. That was amazing.”
“When I get my hands on you… I’m going to cut my name into your skin, Dean Winchester. My name will be there with you as your body rots into the earth, my name will be there as the worms and the maggots and the beetles feast upon the flesh that Castiel desired so much.”
"Wish I could, Jess was pissed at me for letting him see that show... I mean I didn't do it on purpose, but that show can be pretty brutal so I do get it" He sighed “But it’s not like he was scared… He hasn’t had any nightmares or anything”
"You ok?" He asked her when he noticed she looked a little pale.
It was after lunch and Dean was checking his laptop again, was it the third or fourth time now? Eh, who was counting. Still no new messages, no word from ‘shopboy’, he huffed.
“Yes, but… It’s complicated… We just talk” Said Castiel quietly.
“No, Cas… It isn’t. It’s everything, it’s me, being too scared. It’s you - running off to heaven over, and over. It’s me, you or Sam, or anyone else who we all dare to care about, getting hurt or dying and the fact that I had always thought, always known… If I let us have this, if I truly got to have you - the way I’ve wanted for so long, and then lost you… It would be a fate worse than anything I’ve had thrown at me before, it would be worse than death… Living without you, it wouldn’t be a life worth living.”
“Fine, but that dick disappeared and I don’t know, Sam, I didn’t want to leave Cas there… I mean… Balthazar had lost the plot…”
One strike.
"Hmm," said Charlie clearly unconvinced, "Well, I just want you to be happy and for you to get some."
Dean felt a blush creeping up his neck, thank god the landing light wasn't on, "Yeah... Mum said he could stay over. That’s alright, isn’t it?"
If he doesn’t sort this out soon… I’ll give him constipation, I’ll see to it that he doesn’t poop for a week.
Lisa walked into the living room, fully dressed now and hair done, "That Sam?"
“There is something else…”
"You sure you'll be alright? Got enough cab fare?" He asked her.
“Say it all again Dean…”
“Hello Dean”
"Well, I'm not going in there. We're putting that guy out of a job Dean... He is gonna hate us" Said Sam flagging down a passing cab and turning back to Dean as he opened the door "You want dropping off?"
Castiel came back into the store with a coffee and a breakfast muffin for Garth "Here, you can go home.. after you've eaten this"
“We didn’t know each other all that well… I just can’t help but feel some responsibility for everything… I worked for Balthazar, but I never expected that he’d…”
After a few more messages back and forth, Dean fell asleep, with his book still open at the page he’d been reading on his chest.
“It’s Cas, I’m worried about him,” Said Dean looking from Charlie to Sam as he paced his office.
Castiel looked at Jo "So Garth's ok? That's great. Did they say anything else about Charlie?"
"Not by tonight," said Dean, "It's going into the garage tomorrow."
Dean sighed, “Could it be Balthazar?”
The first thing Dean noticed about the quaint little bookstore, as he stepped through the door and held it open for the kids to pace inside under his arm, was the lingering smell of delicious bacon. He inhaled deeply, scanning the store to see where the teasing scent was coming from, he had already taken the kids to dinner already and had tried to set a good example; they had all had sandwiches with salad and not sweets, but now he really craved bacon...
“I just want to talk,” He says
He gasped as Deans mouth met his with a pure, raw heat... Dean's tongue claiming his mouth as soon as Castiel parted his lips... Dean had one hand in Castiel's pants, working his cock and the other was pinning one of Castiel's arms against the wall, holding him there.
He closed his laptop feeling a little better for getting some of his thoughts out of his head and written down. He checked the time on his phone and realized he needed to leave to meet Dean. He wondered if he should mention that he’d visited his store.
Castiel smiled at them "Thank you. You are both still dressing up tonight?"
When Dean opens his eyes again, the feeling of lips at the back of his neck, the feeling of strong hands massaging his shoulders is gone. Instead, he feels ropes. His ankles, his wrists are bound. He looks at his wrist groggily, then tilts his head to look down at his feet, he notices with a jolt that he is naked. When did that happen?
He was wearing black leather pants, a black tank top and a leather jacket, on his back was a pair of black feathery wings. And Dean noticed.. as he let his eyes roam over him, that those black leather pants, hugged Cas in all the right place...
Charlie gave Garth a sneaky thumbs up when Jo wasn't looking and Jo and Garth headed out of the bar to go back to Jo's for the night.
“He’s gutted, but Castiel has offered to put him up for a few days until his new place is ready… Unsurprisingly, he cheered up a bit after that”
“I can’t explain,” says Dean, carefully picking his words so as not to make Castiel angry, “Sometimes, I just feel sad.”
Charlie tilted her head watching the doctor who was dressed as a vampire, she saw him looking over to the bar. He had noticed Castiel and was crossing the room towards him, Charlie smirked "I don't know, he looks like he has plans"
Castiel ties him tightly back to the bed and takes his tray away. As soon as he closes the door behind him, he places the tray on the ground and pulls the zip down on his pants, taking his semi-hard cock from his trousers and jerking himself roughly, one hand on his cock, one on the door behind which Dean Winchester is laid out naked on his bed, naked and sorry and grateful. Castiel bites his lip as he pictures himself fucking into Dean. He comes in his own hand panting into the crook of his arm to quieten his activities.
“Balthazar… rumor has it he hasn’t been doing too well. I have a friend who works in his building who told me last night that he’s been turning up to work drunk…” Lisa paused “Apparently he has been given a final warning, according to my friend… He seems slightly unstable at the moment. My advice is to be careful. I don’t know exactly what happened between you and him, but I don’t want you to get hurt.”
"Nothing" She started "You feeling better now?"
Castiel stood up with tears of fury and pain in his eyes "And he threatened you?"
"I’m a bit sore," confessed Dean quietly as he closed the door behind him but then he climbed into bed next to Castiel. He lifted Castiel's arm up, tucking himself under it and against his friend - lover... "We're better than 'good' Cas..." He kissed the back of Castiel's hand and closed his eyes, "I'm taking you for a drive tomorrow. Just me and you."
"Yes sir," said Dean, smiling dumbly, "I will... Thanks."
“Because he had always got his own way? Things started going wrong and he lashed out… I don’t know, I’m just going off what I’ve seen and heard, but it doesn’t matter… None of this is your fault, you know that right?”
“I’m sure Charlie is better at relationship advice than me, but just be sincere. Jo’s lovely and you are so good together, I think she’ll say yes.”
“Hey handsome, how are you?” She greets him with a quick hug.
"Well he asked if it would OK with me if he did and I told him of course, I'm happy that you two will be alright," Said Castiel, he'd never admitted to them that he had asked Dean on their behalf.
Saw this really cute guy jogging today, he had legs like tree trunks and this pair of little black shorts that fit really snug on his ass... He was panting and sweaty as he jogged by, our eyes met for like a split second... I swear my heart stopped in my chest...
“And that’s it? I’m too intimidating for you to talk to, to be real with?” Castiel asked, sounding sad.
Castiel laughs softly, the story he’d spun for Sam had been pretty genius given that he’d made it up on the spot. He’d walked into Sam’s room, all those weeks ago and introduced himself. Stating that he’d been looking for Balthazar, his boss who he’d heard had been in an accident… but once he’d got to the hospital, he’d heard whispers of awful things, of things Balthazar had done. He explained to Sam that he and Dean had met about a month ago, at Balthazar’s bar and had hit it off… arranging to meet for coffee the next day… Dean had never shown.
This is awesome!
Sam struggles into a second hospital chair, placing his crutches down on the ground beside him, “It’s alright, it’s good that Dean has another visitor, it’s good he hears your voice…”
Thought Castiel
He texts her back agreeing and then texts Garth to see how he is doing. Thinking how it’s going to be weird not seeing them every day. He sends the message to Garth and then thinks about Dean.
Dean howled at the pain, “STOP, stop… please? Alright, fuck. Yours. Yours okay?”
He looks around him, confused. How did he get here? He felt like he'd just been… somewhere else. He felt like something terrible had just happened. Something that had weighed heavily on his heart. He blinked again, he was really here, he sat up and looked at Jack’s face, his eyes were closed, his breathing was slow and steady.
"Good morning" He replied, "Where is Castiel?"
The Lords, were actually a hell of a lot easier than he’d thought. The elderly men were little trouble and once settled in the garage with a cup of tea and a comfortable chair, several of them fell asleep. There wasn’t going to be much ‘leaping’ but Castiel reasoned that having them should be enough. A couple of them got a little excited by some of the cars, marvelling in delight at the Men of Letters vintage automobiles, not leaping, but close enough as far as Castiel was concerned.
"Well, I had an old Match.com profile and I logged in to close the account as, you know, I'm with Balthazar," Charlie rolled her eyes but Castiel ignored her and continued, "Anyway, he had sent me a message and I don't really know why but I decided to reply and we just got talking about books and music and New York. I don't have a profile picture and neither does he, we don't talk about anything personal. So, no names, or what we do for work or anything like that..."
"Yes, this is very fancy," He said motioning around (Castiel gave him a subtle sidewards glare, as he realized he was mimicking his earlier words) "Congratulations on your new book"
“I’m going to go to Sam’s, see the kids for a bit… Eat all their food, you know?”
After Castiel closed the car door behind him, the taxi pulled away and he turned to face Dean with a grin. He pulled his keys from his pocket and moved past Dean to the front door, leaving it open behind him for Dean to follow him in. He stopped at the end of the hallway and turned to watch Dean closing the door behind and suddenly Dean looked a little less sure of himself, nervous in fact.
"No. So I really need this evening to go well" She said, somewhat desperately.
“He was?” Came a voice from behind them both and they turned to see Dean walking towards them “Why?”
You take me away from my love… and replace him with your sweaty hands… If I had teeth I would bite you. Take me to my love, you fiend!!!
Castiel’s eyes are blown wide with shock and fear, his stomach turns as he feels Balthazar's hands on him “Bal… Stop it. What are you…”
Garth looked down guiltily, then back up at Castiel as though he wanted to say something, but then changed his mind his head tilting to one side as he clearly was thinking about something, finally when he spoke it was without that hint of disappointment and sounded almost defiant "I think you should meet him then"
“You’re damn right. Isn’t it time you got some?”
Dean had frozen. Castiel had frozen. There was no denying it, they both knew they were both awake...
When Dean comes, it surprises him, no matter how fucked up the situation, he can’t deny that he’d enjoyed that.
It had been three… no, four weeks? Four weeks since Dean had ‘moved in’ as Castiel put it. Four weeks of ropes and handcuffs, four weeks of rewards and punishments. Four weeks of not seeing or speaking to Sam, of only having Castiel for company. Dean wanted to get out, to go home and see Sam. He missed his brother and spent a lot of time wondering how Sam was coping with him being gone. It made his heart physically ache to think that Sam might be out there right now looking for him, worrying about him.
“Sit,” Balthazar commands, pushing Dean into the chair forcefully.
Dean frowned.
“Who the fuck are you!?”
Instead of staring down upon the bloody, broken, and beautiful body of Mick Davis, Balthazar is confronted with an image of Castiel and Dean. It’s clearly a fake but Castiel must have made it, taken their pictures from this book and replaced them with Deans.
Balthazar pushes his hard cock deep down Dean’s throat, the man chokes on it, coughing and spluttering harshly. As Balthazar drags his dick back out, a string of saliva from Dean’s mouth connects it to the spider gag in his mouth. He wets himself with it and presses in again, pressing against the back of Dean’s throat over and over.
They were both getting warmer, sweaty and desperate... Dean's hand reached back, finding Castiel's waist, he gripped onto him digging his fingertips in, demanding more. Then after a few moments they slid down, dipping beneath Castiel's underwear, pushing them down impatiently...
Charlie's eyes grow wide and she turns to face Castiel.
YOU LISTEN HERE YOU SELFISH BASTARD, we have both ignored Asshole, long enough. He is lonely, he is down, he needs some attention, and love, he needs to feel the hot slide of Dean’s meat.
He picks up the pillow and brings it to his face, inhaling deeply, with his eyes closed in blissful completion. This building may be his house, but Castiel’s mind and body were his home. He sits on the edge of the bed, smoothing his hand over the warm indent in the middle.
Song #10
“Well, he kind of… saved us…” Said Castiel thinking how best to describe that night with Balthazar outside The Triangle “He put himself between, me and my friends and Balthazar… and got injured as a result…”
Send him a dick pic.
"Who?" Said Garth
It was almost an hour later when Castiel and Dean finally left Castiel’s house.
"Alright, alright I'll stop. When you tell me what's going on with you today?"
“Didn’t get the chance to say anything, I’d got the fuck out of there. Look I’m sorry I honestly thought it was a good idea, I don’t care about lying to Balthazar, that ass deserves it, but I didn’t think it would upset you?”
Dean’s furious shout made Ellen and John turn around in shock before giggling at how he’d said a naughty word.
"Excuse me, I just need a quick word with Garth for a moment," he said to Jo, who looked at Garth questioningly.
The man chuckled, "Well, it sounds like he has good taste."
Shhh. I’m thinking. Types out new message… Presses Send.
"Ok," said Lisa turning to look at the menu "What are we having? Salad?"
Waking up to sunrise on the boat in the morning was breathtaking, Dean felt relaxed. The air was cool and smelt like the sea. He rolled on to his side and pulled his laptop towards him, wanting to tell 'Shopboy' about his view right now. ‘Funny’, he thought to himself as that ‘shopboy’ had been the first thing he’d thought of when he woke up.
"Are you for fucking real?" Shouted Castiel suddenly pushing Balthazar away from him he stumbled to the ground looking shocked and angry, Castiel's cheeks were burning hot with fury "God only knows where you’ve been or who with"
,” scoffs Dean, rolling his eyes to look at the ceiling, whilst rubbing a hand over his chin, “Yeah, he looked like he wanted to get
“Last question. Whose name are you going to call out when I make you come. Sam’s or mine?”
“Thank you, Dean.”
Dean hears Balthazar through the door, he searches blindly for a switch on the wall. His fingers find a cord, he pulls it and the room bursts into view with the flicker of the light.
The door opened again and everyone looked up to see the doctor coming back into the room, he looked up and chuckled. "You certainly are popular aren't you?"
“Exactly, which is why it will be less awkward for me in the morning when the kids wake up and decide to jump on the guy on the couch… Or if Sam and Jess come down and I’m still asleep. You’re the guest, you get the guest room” Dean said kindly “It’s fine, trust me”
Then Castiel is walking away from him again, back towards where Dean knows the door is. Dean hears a ‘click’ and then he lurches forward again as the vibrations from the butt plug shoot through him.
"Ok. I wasn't totally honest with you about why I wanted to come out tonight" Said Dean sheepishly
“I think Dean feels guilty regardless of your feelings, I know that before he hadn’t met anyone he’d put out of business, there was just the name of the store, you know? Not the faces of those that worked there… I know meeting you affected him. He certainly never offered ex-competitors jobs before…”
Balthazar flicks through the rest of the pages, moving faster and faster as Dean’s smug smiling face greets him again and again, taunting him. He tosses the book angrily into the center of the bed. Closing his eyes he focuses on controlling his rage, this isn’t Castiel’s fault, it’s his own. Clearly he had made a grievous mistake. Granting Castiel this ‘freedom’ after promising him that he, Balthazar would always be there for him. Castiel had clearly been testing his devotion and foolishly, he had given in to his request. He’d let Castiel go when he should have held him tighter.
Dean narrowed his eyes at him, "Don't be a little shit, you already got me into trouble tonight."
He looked at his son, sadness filling him as he thinks about how Jack’s life has been so cruel, he is just a child. A child... should be full of life and energy, having friends, family and fun… not lying in a hospital bed fighting for his life. He should be at home, with his family, with him and Sam and Dean.
Cas is scared for a moment, hands clenching at his side at the admission, “You're seriously going to try and deny now that you are attracted to men?”
“No,” Says Garth quietly “I’m sorry Cas, I wish there was something I could do”
Dean had called Sam and with Castiel’s permission told him a very basic version of what had happened… Sam had agreed that Castiel shouldn’t be alone and was more than welcome to join them at his house and could stay the night if he would feel safer. Castiel had packed a small bag, fresh clothing for the next day, his toothbrush, his laptop and not wanting to turn up empty handed he found a bottle of wine in the kitchen to take with him for Sam and Jess.
"I thought girls had a weird bathroom code, that they all always go together" He smirked
“I’d take the worst kiss with you over than the best kiss with anybody else, any day.” smiled Dean as he closed the gap between them. Their lips slotted together and the crowd in the garage cheered, even the angry farmers ‘Aww’ed’.
"No idea.. professionalism? I don't know" Said Dean shrugging again “Doubt he’ll be invited to any of her events again… Or me for that matter” He laughed out the last sentence.
Garth stayed at Castiel’s for over an hour and when he left he text Charlie to let her know that Castiel seemed ok while he was there.
My minds telling me no….. But my body… My body is telling YESSSSSSSSS… I don’t see nothing wrong… With a little bump and grind…
“Yeah, but I walk into traps to save people, you’re putting yourself at risk for… what exactly? This is a
“I can’t save him,” mumbles Castiel to himself, grievously defeated. He falls to his knees. Sam is gone. His friend… is dead. He closes his eyes, some distant hope that when he opens them again, this will have all just been some kind of nightmare, some kind of horrible trick - horrible but not real. When his eyes open and he is still in the cave, tears overflow from his eyes and run down his cheeks. How was he going to explain this to Dean and to...
Dean looked around his boat and thought before typing…
Castiel rubs himself over Dean’s ass crack a few times, making the man groan, then he roughly pushes in his rock hard cock and frantically starts thrusting up into Dean, who moans out loudly.
Googling how to build a bench? Really? It was a joke… Ah fuck it, don’t forget the anti-rot paint…. Make the seat big enough for two dip-shit.
"Yeah, I do... I mean it's my fault…”
"Well... I'll see you on Friday then, I'll let you know when I get there" Said Balthazar leaning forward and pecking Castiel's cheek quickly.
Dean thought about claiming to have no idea what she was on about but he didn't want to lie to her. He sighed.
“HELP!!” bellows Dean, drowning Castiel’s request out.

Charlies eyebrows shoot up “Excuse me?”
bad times. Dean, whose longing for him, he could feel like a cool breeze blowing on his skin but who had crushed it into that unreachable place inside of him and willfully ignored it for years. Dean for whom he had defied heaven and given up an army. Dean who he had saved from hell and died in order to protect… Dean, who had said nothing when he told him he was going to leave to join Dale.
Internally he rolls his eyes, but outwardly Castiel smiles back at him, “I want to thank you again for allowing me permission to visit Dean.”
Jo looked stunningly beautiful Garth noted, now nervously questioning his own choice of attire. She was wearing a pretty black dress and had her hair tied up with loose curls falling down her neck. She smiled brightly as she spotted Garth.
After Sam had given her a card, she headed back out the door of the store. As she left she saw a slick black Impala pull up. She watched as Dean got out of the car.
I’m sorry my love… I have no choice…
"Maybe we should make a deal with her? For every so many books sold here they get a free coffee at Meg’s or a loyalty card with her where if they buy five coffees, we do a book token for a couple of quid or something." Charlie was clearly deep in thought and walked away without waiting for a reply.
"I know," he said, "We seem perfect for each other..."
“Physically, yeah I think so… But he was pretty shaken up before…” Says Dean in a hushed tone.
“We could give them their bodies back... tomorrow…”
“Stay tuned for the latest on traffic and weather after this…” Sam reaches for the dial of the radio, one hand on the steering wheel, ahead of him, two men come crashing through the trees and out into the middle of the road. In the split second, he has to react, his eyes pick out the fearsome expression of the man holding the knife up high… and then with gut-wrenching realization fall on the face of the other man, his foot slams onto the brake…
Mmm. Yes you do.
He read it quickly, his stomach dropping as he wrote back... 'I will call you in five' He set a timer on his phone and sat at the small breakfast table, tapping his fingers on the tables wooden surface in agitation as he watched the seconds tick away. He tried not to picture Balthazar and Castiel getting into a fight... or in some ways worse making up, however unlikely that seemed after last night, the thought wouldn't leave his mind. He looked at his phone, willing the seconds to count down faster.
“I brought you some bacon and bagels. We’ve been neglecting our short-lived tradition” Said Garth holding up a brown paper bag
Dean nodded “I think so, yeah. How soon could I move in?”
“Well, you like Castiel, don’t you?”
"No, I'm coming down now. We're heading straight out to the boat. See you in a sec." said Dean, grabbing his bags and heading for the door.
“I’ll always be here Dean, I’ll always be waiting for you.”
Jealousy flared inside him with each image that had Dean smiling at someone else. He missed that smile, he deserved it, hadn’t he proven to Dean by now that no one would do more for him than Castiel. He connected Dean’s phone to his computer and downloaded all of the images, he made a copy of each, editing it so that it was his face that was beaming back at Dean and not some drunken slut. The pictures looked good, so good in fact that he decided to print some off. He pulled out his photo album, wistfully looking through it at the images of his past victims.
You should ask him if he’d like to take off your underwear… with his teeth.
Trying to keep his voice steady he asked out loud but to no one in particular "Who is that?"
"So... Sam thinks I might be in love with you" Says Dean looking side-ways at Castiel
Dean frowned at him for a moment “Cas, you don’t have to…”
Horrifyingly the bed suddenly dips and creaks under someone else's added weight. Dean feels long, cold fingers trace through the prickly hairs on his legs. His feeling of helplessness magnifies as the weight shifts closer, he can’t shrink away and hide, he can’t defend himself or move, he can’t even see who is crawling their fingers over his flesh.
"Did you not hear me last night? I told you not to come here, not to come near me ever again!" Said Castiel suddenly his anger was bubbling, the sheer arrogance of this man.
Dean winced internally, ah… so he’d found out who he was then, "I am yeah"
Castiel looked at him, "Thank you, Garth. I don't know what's going on with Balthazar either, I wish I did... I thought maybe I was the problem..."
Sam busied himself with breakfast as Dean made coffee. He was still pissed about his boat, more so even at the thought that maybe Balthazar had thought he was in it at the time, but now somehow getting to spend a week with Castiel, things didn't seem quite so bad...
“Will I ever see you again?” asks Dean, looking up hopefully into Castiel’s eyes…
"Some guy Cas has been messaging online," Said Charlie “So wait - he wants to meet, what did he say?”
"No" Said Dean rolling his eyes "Still waiting..."
"I know, let's just have a look in the window, see what he looks like.. " Said Dean moving towards the window and peering in as Sam 'tutted' behind him
"Thanks" Smiled Castiel excepting his drink "Hey, look..." He pointed over Deans shoulder to a sign above the bar "They have fishbowl cocktails..."
Yeah, it is…
“I told you, I’d report him…” Began Castiel
His eyes flick to the corner of the screen, where a little red light indicates that this feed is live. He drops down onto the couch, his hand reaching for the laptop and moving the cursor to click on the other feeds that are coming from the house, the kitchen, empty, the hall, empty, his heart begins thudding in his chest, had Dean escaped? Had he left him?
"He knows I have a boyfriend" Said Castiel. He didn’t think that ‘Win67’ would do that.
You’re an asshole.
“I doubt that we’d be doing much talking,” Said Sam thinking about it “Yeah, ok… I’d like to beat the shit out of the guy… but Jess… the kids? I don’t know”
“Nope, sorry dude. You know if I was going to send you flowers, I would leave some embarrassing note on them, like ‘Glad you’re feeling better now, hope the rash goes away soon’.” Charlie laughed down the phone as Castiel shook his head.
"You do know who that is, don't you? That's Dean Winchester" Said Balthazar quietly as he reached Castiel’s side. Castiel stared at him, no… that couldn’t be right… that couldn’t be…
Dean thought about it and nodded his head slightly “Yeah, I see your point. But you gotta tell Cas. I’ll play along if that’s what he wants…”
Castiel grinned at him as he stood there "Dean... What are you doing here?"
Castiel wondered if Meg had seen the paper yet, she was a friend of Charlie's who owned a quaint coffee shop on the next street.
He logged into his Match.com profile and smiled to himself as he saw that he had a new message from 'Shopboy'... After reading it he clicked reply and began his message.
"Did you yak?" Asks Charlie looking at him sympathetically
I do love you, my beautiful, mon amour!! I wanted to be with you every second since we parted. You and none other"
“And you’re back to stay right?”
Balthazar looked at Castiel's face, his eyes closing as he stepped towards him dropping to his knees in front of him and his fingers fumbling at the front of Balthazar's pants.
John smiles mirthlessly, “It’s very simple, I want you gone. I want you out. I want you to pack up your shit and take a one way trip out of New York and I want it within the next fucking week. You can keep your dirty blood money, I don’t need or want a cent from you. I just want you to be aware that I can and will destroy you, if you don’t leave. And if you ever go near Castiel or my son again… well, it will be the last fucking thing you ever do.” John had stepped even closer into Balthazar’s face, “Am I making myself clear, Mr Roche?”
As the hand on his throat grips tighter, Castiel can see the moment he’d open the door, the moment that had led to him being trapped now, playing out in slow motion in his mind before him, his feet stepping that last step closer, his hand reaching out to the door unknowing of the danger that waited for him on the other side. The moment his eyes had met those glazed red eyes of Balthazar’s, their color tinged like fire from alcohol and lack of sleep… What was Balthazar going to do to him?
"Dean, are you sure?" Castiel whispered, as he rested his forehead against Dean's back, "Are you sure you want this...?"
"Make no mistake Garth, you will not like what happens to you if you ever tell Castiel I was here." He growled at him before roughly shaking his wrist away. Garth's face was pale as he walked through the other diners towards the bar, where Jo was waiting for him. His thoughts buzzing a million miles a minute and his heart pounding in his chest.
Alright, I’m ready. Let’s do this…
“Cas…” Dean tried to tell him not to bother, that he was likely in shock, but as Castiel looked down at him, eyes still shining, Dean found he didn’t have the heart to stop him from doing what was likely the only thing he could think of to distract himself from his violent ex’s actions… So instead he just lets Castiel clean his cut and gives him a half smile and whispers “Thanks”
Castiel stared at him "She is not 'some woman'. She's Charlie. You know she is gay. Don't be like that"
Mon amour, you know I love you. You know I want you and no other.
"Mmm… No, I think you are simply telling me what you think I want to hear, I don't think you really mean it." Castiel pushes himself deep in Dean's ass, drawing a groan of pain from Dean that makes his heart skip, he whispers, "How can I be sure that you are really here, with me… and not escaping to someplace in your mind with Sam?"
Castiel blinked at him, “I mean, it could be but… I don’t think…”
The angels eyes were full of panic at Dean’s expression. Dean blinked at him, he had been about to get angry, to start shouting at Castiel but then the angels desperate face had squashed his anger in one go. ‘How like Castiel to take that damn song so literally’ thought Dean and suddenly it all seemed so hysterical.
Are you… blushing?
Dale had been like a breath of fresh air, honestly Castiel had been rather dense to people’s interest in him in the past but Dale had left no room for interpretation when he’d whispered to Castiel that he would really like to get to know him better. Castiel had been feeling a mix of emotions since that moment.
Nervous?
Dean scratches his head, wincing as his finger touches the tender cut over his eyebrow “I, er… I brought you something but I’m not sure now is a good time to…”
Dean huffs out a humorless laugh “Yeah, well no… Not everything. Thankfully my car is safe.” ‘
Dean wakes up to the feeling of warmth between his legs. His body is moving back and forth and there is a heaviness over him. He opens his eyes as he realizes that his cock is half-hard. Hard and rubbing against a warm body that is rocking down onto him slowly. Castiel is groaning softly with each gentle motion.
Castiel's first thought was not what are you doing here, or how do you know where I live.. but instead he looked at Dean tilting his head. "Dean..." He called "Are you wearing pajamas?"
By the time he was done and coming back to the living room, he could hear voices coming from Sam and Jess’ room. John and Ellen were up and already asking their parents for breakfast, Dean figured that made sense though. As big and tasty as Thanksgiving dinner had been, it had been earlier than they would usually eat and the kids were hungry.
Sam looked down guiltily and Charlie’s eyebrows shot up “Wait, seriously?” She dug in her pockets “Damn, I forgot my phone… I’ll call him when I get home. What Balthazar thing?”
But suddenly that thought was cut off, Dean’s eyes widened dramatically as Castiel groaned against the back of Dean's neck. Dean froze, feeling his skin prickle under the warm breath that ghosts over his skin. With wild, desperate eyes he listens... Just to make matters worse he could feel his own cock twitching and swelling with interest at the noise his friend had made. The noise didn't come again, so Dean lay there, thinking. Imaging.
Four Calling Birds
At that moment he heard the front door opening and closing and then Lisa shout through the house to him.
