Sherlock folded his hands under his chin in what he considered to be a ‘thinking’ position as John pushed him to the bagelry, occasionally telling him to alter his course to get there.
That night Mrs. Hudson found a check for three months rent in advance. She tried calling John to ask about it, but his phone had been put out of service.
“I wouldn’t even really know what to do with something like that-“ John’s mind screamed to just stop talking before he made a greater fool of himself.
“Can too.” Sherlock left the warmth of John’s lap and made to leave when his tail was pulled causing him to fall onto the bed with a light ‘thud.’ John released the tail only to jump on his back and start a full out scratching war on the taller man’s neck and back. Sherlock didn’t want to admit how smitten he was with the sensation, fighting for freedom he only managed to flip himself onto his back, John now straddling his waist.
He had been red with embarrassment that not only was his ex really making a scene about a false relationship between him and the British Government, but right in front of the man at that, until of course that last word. "Hey, wait just a minute! What the hell is wrong with that?" He remembered Mary's cutting words the night before as she said what Sherlock and John were doing was a 'sin.'
The boys had been hyper focused on an intense scene, both leaning closer to the screen when, without warning, something had plucked the chords of the violin. John let out a rather high pitched yelp as Lestrade quickly grabbed hold of him. It was rather an awkward moment before they immediately detangled. John quickly stood to flick on every light switch he could as Greg counted threads on the couch. They were scared out of their minds and didn’t want to admit it to one another.
Sherlock’s grin slowly turned into a frown, “I know. You’re not coping very well, I’m not even sure if you’ll remember this when you wake up, and even if you do, you might write off anything I say as part of your dream.” He curiously forked a piece of sausage and put it in his mouth, surprised to find it was the juiciest piece of meat he had eaten in his entire life.
Greg smiled, though there was some sad element just behind his eyes and the way he forced the corners of his mouth up. But he was trying, after all. “I’ll stop by my place too and grab a few things. You can come with if you like, or-”
“I have to wait for it to be in full effect first.” He wiggled his way out of the suit, not sure if he was madder about the size change or his west-wood laying crumpled on the floor. A grin found its way across his features as he looked up at the impossibly tall sniper. “Probably enjoying this aren’t you, you’re so pathetic.”
The detective rolled his sleeves up allowing the tub to fill before continuing to massage his blogger’s muscles like he had tried earlier.
Sherlock stared at him blankly before idly placing his hands on the wheels at either side of him. “I suppose I should feel guilty, we left the pastries you brought inside, but it seems counter productive to ‘storming out’ if we went back in for them.”
“My sight isn’t completely gone, I can’t make out much more then the chair, but I can smell his after shave and chemicals on him. I don’t appreciate being lied to.”
Sherlock was bent on his ruse, but when he heard muffled moans both his eyes shot open to make sure nothing had happened while he wasn’t looking.
“I’m not sure, I suppose I can if I did it before. I’m not sure how much dexterity I can achieve though, if you want me to write things down using your hands, it would take a lot of practice.” Sherlock ran his long pale fingers over John’s arms where he had them outstretched and finally laced their hands together. “You don’t mind?”
“Tobby, dinner.” As soon as the deep baritone voice called out the cat leaped up and began dashing through the park and then down a thankfully empty street. Sherlock’s grip tightened around John.
“This is Harry, I’m away at the moment but I’ll be sure to call you back as soon as I can.” Followed by a loud beep.
There's currently 21 chapters, I'm planning on writing the bare minimum of 5 more. After that... I have no idea.
“Er,” John was dreading this. He really didn’t want to lie to Mr Rogers, but things just kept happening to imply that Sherlock was incidentally not dead. “The thing is-” Miraculously, John’s phone dinged with a text at that time.
Ella blinked in confusion; she wasn’t a very internet savvy person. “I’m sorry? Are you saying you met him online then?”
“Can’t say.” He glimpsed down the hall but John and Molly were already out of sight. “Promised it wouldn’t leave the flat.”
Sherlock read the worry on his face, “Theoretically you shouldn’t be able to be forced to do something entirely against your will. Again, testing that. But if there is anything that does really bother you, you can call the experiment off.”
“I did, but he’s still an idiot. He should have told me.” John would have done anything for Sherlock to have told him he was alright though. “His plan wouldn’t have worked anyway, I didn’t even go home that first day…” How could he face the flat that soon after Sherlock’s death after all.
“There was someone- the door had-” John groaned in frustration. This was utterly absurd and he couldn’t think of how to explain what happened.
“You’re awfully quiet.” Maria had an almost sing song voice. “There’s a reason why I didn’t gag you after all.”
Mycroft was about to yell an insult to her insolence until a thought flashed in his mind. As truly unlikely as it was, there was a slim possibility that this might somehow lead him to his answer.
“Look at me.” Sherlock’s eyes were clearing, but still dark. “I’m a monster. I’m going to hurt you if I stay here any longer.”
“John? I’ve been reading your blog, I am glad you have continued it, but we need to talk about it.” Ella attempted to have a soft yet firm tone as she talked to her patient.
John shot up from his bed in a cold sweat. His heart was pounding so loudly in his ears he could barely make out what his tent mate was saying to him.
John moaned softly into Sherlock’s mouth, “Fine… but he really has been a prat to me for months now.”
John remembered the command for that one well, “But you didn’t say… that again after the first day.”
“The term is homophobic, and the answer has been staring us in the face all along. John, I’m an idiot! This makes so much more sense, why would Moriarty go through such a round a bout way to get at me?”
“How would you know? You’ve never asked before.” They shared a moment of appreciative silence until John pulled the detective back into the kitchen, sat him down, and began his morning ritual of making food he would try to force Sherlock to eat. “Something’s been bothering me.”
This time John did fall backwards as Sherlock laid an unexpected kiss on the top of his head. “I like that.” John could feel the air from Sherlock’s words against his body.
“Very well. This man seems to have bled to death, obvious from the numerous incisions all over the body. Ah, he’s a chemist, and seems to dabble in botany.” The room felt too quiet without someone to question how he knew this or exclaim ‘brilliant!’ The detective moved on to the second body and flashed a look towards his doctor who only continued his mad glare. “Poisoned.”
John grabbed Sherlock’s waist to pull him upright again, but as soon as he touched him he let ago. Sherlock squirmed at the touch as well and re surfaced. Water poured from his face.
The tentacle curled away from his mate, “Its really sensitive right now.” He couldn’t meet Greg’s eyes again. Not about this.
As John went to unlock the door, it quickly swung open, nearly hitting him in the face as it revealed his old roommate.
“Oh, you should be hungry by now.” He realized his small doctor had gone a night and morning without food.
Sherlock gave in and nestled next to his flatmate on the bed facing him, “You’re just going to yell at me for this in the morning and claim you’ve forgotten tonight.”
A small trickle of blood mixed with rain run off came down the pipe. His eyes widened at the sight. "No…" A multitude of graphic possibilities flashed through Sherlock's mind, almost all of which ended poorly for John.
Molly nodded again. “He didn’t plan on dying though…” her voice was barely above a whisper. “He had it all planned out, there were… risks, but the chance of success was more then in his favor.”
Sherlock furrowed his brow. That was a bit not good what he had just done. To be fair he was merely preserving what was his. That woman didn’t care about John nearly a fraction of the amount that he cared for him. She would simply take John away from him one day and then they would be miserable apart. No, this was perfectly acceptable and Sherlock knew that he had done the right thing.  But would John realize that? It wasn’t exactly important… and John had let him take him outside knowing he was still susceptible to the hypnotism… even if he had to use his trigger word to get him to accept that… No, John would definitely think this was decisively not good. (Even if by technicality it was for the best.)
“Alright, but I’m telling you now, most girls just aren’t impressed by that sort of thing, just me.” Molly sat at a computer in the student lounge and started showing John the basics, not sure if he would catch on or not.
“Was he… shopping?” He was still determined to find the connection between John shopping and sneaking out at night.
“You’ll always mean the world to me, Sherlock. Where ever you are, I just want you to know that.” He gave an awkward chuckle and dried wetness forming at the base of his right eye. “You stupid sap. Doubt he could possibly here ya now.” He reached for a cigarette. He had quit a year ago, but ended up buying a pack two days ago to deal with the stress.
“I don’t particularly want to get my clothes soaking wet.” John could feel his body awkwardly sliding forward more.
John wandered out of Sherlock’s bedroom, feeling like he had been caught doing something bad, though when he was in there he couldn’t help but feel strangely welcomed.
If it wasn’t for the sound vibrations he would have tried to comfort Sherlock, instead he just had to soldier on and try to make it before the timer went off.
John paused for a moment, his hand feeling strange as he reached for the knob and turned. He reminded himself that he had to go to work and stop waiting for a man that would never come home. John walked outside, inhaling deeply. It wasn’t as bad as he thought it might be.
The politician cocked his head to the side in a calculating manner when voice came from everywhere and no where at once.
Sunday morning Macy’s had a shoe sell and Molly decided it was about time she bought new clothes and make an attempt at looking prettier. She eyed the shoes thoughtfully, they were far more glittery and feminine then even she was use to, though she was glad they came in larger sizes. She bit her lower lip and began looking around to see what other women were buying for comparison.
Sherlock felt every movement of the fragile yet still strong John in his hand as he caressed his thumb. “Lestrade, we’re going to go inspect Harry’s flat just to make sure no one was keeping tabs on her.” Greg nodded in agreement of the plan. He refocused his gaze on the man in his palm “Mhm, the things I would do to right now if you were big enough little soldier mine.”
John clutched the pillow closer, staring at the wall. “Yesterday when I got that phone call… for minute I thought I heard you on the other line whisper my name… but it wasn’t you.” his eyes welled up with tears.
He dared a peek, he was on a bed, a soft comfortable bed that he actually fit on. "It was a dream… it was all a dream!" he smiled, "Well of course it was a dream, it's impossible to shrink someone." He felt the weight shift on the mattress next to him. "It was all a dream…" his smile quickly faded as his face filled with a longing sadness. He didn't want to look to see who was in bed next to him. Maybe none of what he thought had happened was real, but the feelings were. The way he felt about Sherlock was, but if it was just a dream… then he surely wasn't the one next to him now.
“Fine. These are all abbreviated… mostly just one word. What’s this one then? Height?” he looked at the detective quizzically.
Lestrade thought of their previous theory that this was all somehow connected to Harry. The thought was nerve-racking.
“To prove that I can, can you show me?” John gave her his brightest smile, he didn’t mean to be manipulative, but she really could help him out.
“Please?” He looked up at John with pleading eyes. “I wont ask you for anything else, no matter how bad I want it.” He subtly rubbed his inner arm.
Sebastian ran a hand through his hair as he took in a deep breath, “I’m done. That’s it, I’m done.” He kept his voice calm and proceeded to take his rifle apart to hide it in the contents of a large duffle bag along with a handful of knives laying around.
“This is one of the numerous reasons why I appreciate your height John. You are very conveniently light.” The detective grinned.
Mycrfot sprinted back through the doorway that separated the two rooms just as the shelf unit on the north wall slanted too far over. Mycroft dashed to hold it up before it fell on a hunched over Sherlock still mad with panic. The detective heard Mycroft moving behind him and turned in time to see a suspicious empty jam jar slide off the tilted shelf. He instinctively reached out just before the glass connected with the hard wooden floor. Just behind the label he could make out a clearly dazed John.
John watched his screen waiting for the following text to come. It seemed to take longer then the rate at which all the other messages came. Just as he thought Sherlock might have nodded off before texting back his phone buzzed.
John had just sat down to a nice hot cuppa when Sherlock ran past him in a flash, grabbing his coat and scarf. John had to hold onto his cup with both hands to prevent it from spilling.
Feet entered her view, she tried to look up at her captor, face this monster down, but her neck was screaming in pain. She had been hit there when she was knocked out the moment the two officers looked away.
The water was hotter then he was use to but he found himself relaxing into it. It had been fun taking a swim in the sink the other day, but the warmth from the cup surrounded him now. Taking in a deep breath he submerged his head and curled into a ball at the bottom and rustled his hair in the water. He shot his head back out with a sigh leaning it on the lip of the cup and briefly closed his eyes.
“It’s alright! Don’t panic, just a bad bulb.” John quickly flicked a new light switch on. “Didn’t mean to spook you with all this talk.” He frowned.
“That’s genius, how do you know all that?” Lestrade was truly amazed, he had only allowed John to come by to cheer him up, he hadn’t expected him to solve the crime.
“O-of course.” He looked down into the dagger piercing eyes staring at him. Moran was one the world’s deadliest men and yet this single man could bring him to his knees. He wasn’t sure he quite understood it himself. A monitor behind Moriarty caught his eye, “Uh boss, the fire started already.”
“Oh?” John turned and spied the bag, getting up and sitting at the couch to see what was there. “I need a break from my computer.”
“SHIT.” John’s eyes had gone huge as he gripped the tub to get closer. “Does is it hurt?! Fuck, what happened??” He was getting his own shirt wet now as he carefully pressed his fingers to Sherlock’s skin, trying to gage how bad the damage was.
Shit. Shit. Shit. Sherlock instantly started rolling his chair back into the confines of his room, but it was too late, before he could get in all the way and lock the door Mycroft was there with his hand on the door holding it open.
“That was hardly a bit not good, they’ve been separated for over a year now but neither had the money to move.” He stated matter of factly.
Sherlock sighed and took a settling breath. “I tried telling you, I really did. It didn’t seem important at first, by the time it did I thought it seemed a bit late to be telling you, or I would convince myself I would tell you soon.”
Before John could say either way Angelo himself came out to sit them at their regular table in the window seat. “Ah you two! Here again! Let me just get a candle for the table.”
John’s captor licked his lips greedily. It was obvious he was trying to determine the highest possible amount he could get for John. The twelve-centimeter man was truly priceless, how could he possibly come up with a worthy amount? “Twelve million?”
“I’m going to find out why you did it Sherlock, I swear to god, I will find out what really happened.” John wiped his tears away.
John wanted to protest being placed on Sherlock's scarf, he wore it every day and never washed it, the sanitation level was not up to par for him. But as soon as the detective placed him on top and his weight was easily supported by the posh material, he decided against complaining.
At 2am John quietly jumped on Sherlock bed and found his way under the covers. Sherlock woke up the next morning with the tabby sleeping on his chest.
This story is currently being edited a bit, though mainly for typos. You may be confused when you look at what year this was first posted. The original story was written up to chapter 8 but never ended. I am currently writing it again and it will have regular updates. There is a reason for this, which you will find in the chapter description for chapter 9.
Sherlock nodded, seeing that Mycroft was grinning and obviously the source of where ever the hell that voice was coming from. Clearly John wasn’t meant to hear them. But he remembered. He was 7 at the time and a much older boy had hit and kicked him, sending Sherlock to the ground. Mycroft came to his aid, but it had been to late. Something otherworldly had come over him as he grabbed the boy with a strength he had never known and pounded into him. The other boys and girls and sworn on their lives that Sherlock’s eyes had gone solid black. The teachers dismissed it as hysterical children telling stories. But Mycroft had seen it. Made it a point of researching their heritage a bit more after that, but Sherlock never cared enough to hear him out. But there was something inside him that day at the playground. He had felt it squirming somewhere deep inside himself.
“Why on earth would we go with you? Lestrade, if you would, could you kindly take us back to our flat?”
“John?” Sherlock cocked his head as he looked at him, phone still in hand. “We really need to get there before any evidence is washed away.”
“Uh- right- uh- get back to me on if you find anything in the flat then.” He had awkwardly turned away to pretend he was looking for something important in a filing cabinet.
"Very funny." Sherlock noticed John's voice in this state was much smaller then before. He could only hear him well when he was close to him.
John had a very bad feeling as to where this was going. “Ask away.” He wanted very badly to sound casual, but they both knew it was more of a nervous reply.
Sherlock shot him a look of pure rage. “I haven’t ‘lied’ to him.” Omitting things wasn’t really the same, especially when the subject never came up.
"But that makes no sense. He's obviously emotionally compromised because of John, why did he not at least check on him before he left?"
“It’s really better to test it at night actually, besides, I haven’t done an experiment yesterday or today, I’m falling behind on my plans.”
“Possibly… I need to-” He paused. Something had caught his attention. There was consistent pattern of raining hitting against their windows. Even if the blinds were pulled shut, he could still hear it. He reached forward to catch a drop of water from John’s hair. “You’re wet.”
“You left a pair of heels at home.” The detective mused, now realizing John hadn’t brought a single woman back to the apartment since he left it last.
Loud voices came from the living room. John nearly dropped his mug. He was certainly not expecting that. Lestrade quickly stood, looking a bit alarmed as well.
“Jawn-“ Sherlock dipped his face seductively and got to close for comfort to his flatmate “Please get me that plant?”
“Last ni-“ before he could finish, John  captured his lips in a long drawn out kiss that was sweeter then any he had ever had.
John and Molly sat on the floor at either end of the table, placing their fingertips on the planchette.
No Sherlock, I know you sounded afraid last night when you were telling me this was a bad idea, but you also looked so relieved, so happy, when you did tell me where you live and knew I was coming. –JW
Sherlock looked down at his miniature friend and scooped him up, "Hide." Sherlock placed him on the mantle. John scurried inside of the skull.
“You can pick one of mine. You’ll be in total control. Please? It will be fun.” Sherlock beamed, he really wanted his guinea pig back.
After hearing the location from Molly, Mycroft found the surrounding security cams. Unfortunately there were none inside the building it’s self. If it were up to him there would be government accessible cameras in every corner of every building.
Mycroft huffed at his watch barely waiting for the response he wouldn’t be getting before grabbing his broom despite the sunny day and stepping out of his car. He thought he heard a clicking sound in the distance but brushed it off. He eyes narrowed at the inch wide crack that Sherlock left the front door open. Mycroft scoffed “Idiot, if the owner comes home while you’re in there he’ll know something is wrong.” He scowled at a sudden realization. “Sherlock
“You really couldn’t have known, I mean, there are cameras all over this city…” Lestrade felt uncomfortable at the though of everyone’s movements being followed all the time by cameras, “I’m sure if anyone would have been able to see it coming you would of.” He coughed awkwardly. “Besides, John had just updated his blog, and what a post phew, but still, one wouldn’t think something could have happened so quickly afterwards.”
John swallowed deeply, a bit flush from what he discovered, but then he recalled how Sherlock had so coldly read off the name of the porn he caught him watching when his computer was the one being hacked. “Adam and Steve dot com?” he cocked an eyebrow for effect.
But Greg knew that Sherlock wasn’t someone who put a lot of importance in frivolous things and was certainly not the sort to want flowers at his grave. He wanted to honor his friend, but there seemed to be few ways how. Perhaps continuing his work, but as a DI, he was already obligated to solve crimes. Sherlock didn’t much care for the media or if his name had been smeared either, so that seemed like a wasted effort. But there was something, or rather, some one, he cared very deeply for indeed. And John cared just as much for him as well.
“Alright, any suspects?” Greg grabbed a chair and pulled it up beside John’s. “People he’s evicted? Had disagreements with? And ex even?”
“Fine, fine. Lets go salt the bloody closet then. Its not like we have one of those Ouija board things for the latter.”
No, John, you don’t understand. I wasn’t thinking right, please do this for me, and do not open it. –SH
John would later attribute his poor choice of words and misunderstanding to Sherlock pressuring him about his questionable sexuality. “Are you asking me out?”
"Ah, Sherlock, good. I think we found three more murders that could be linked to the ones at the club yesterday." Lestrade held up a manila folder.
“He sent me…” John couldn’t wrap his mind around it. He knew he had promised not to open it, but it was far too late for that now, John had already seen it and there was no way of unseeing it.
Was it just in John’s mind or was the corner of Sherlock’s mouth twisting upwards a bit? Just barely, but he could still see it. Like he was bad at covered a smile, something he knew for a fact that Sherlock was actually exceptionally great at.
John tried to mask a frown, how long had Sherlock been storing himself away in that house? He could see Sherlock was squinting from the sun that he never went in. “Sounds great, just lead the-“ John froze and stopped mid sentence, oh god what had he just said?
"You're a lesbian and I have no interest in women. I recommend a new tactic." His expression remained the same.
The two thick coils around Greg’s waist pulled him closer to Mycroft as he wrapped his arms around him to pick him up. Two smaller tentacles fastened themselves back around Greg’s wrists just in case as the taller man carried him inside the room at the end of the hall. It was a posh bedroom with overly elaborate furnishings and a decadent bed. Even gagged, Greg rolled his as at the over kill of it, of course this was where Mycroft slept.
Sherlock startles with a yip, as fresh pain sears the back of his thighs. John's fine-tuning his technique, knowing full well how to play Sherlock's body. The Captain swats his legs until a thick stripe of red paints the taut muscle. The sting feels maliciously delicious, a devastatingly pleasurable flash fire.
The captain tilts his head back and forth to fully examine his work. Sherlock can't see it, but he senses it all the same. John's special quirky smile, shown only the privacy of their flat, just for Sherlock. It's his alone, and is therefore his favourite. John takes his sweet time in perusing his artwork, admiring the purplish-red sunset of the bruise. The nail marks frame his toothy brand rather well. The captain sighs, and wipes the smile off his face. The private tenses up.
John groans. "No, thank you very much. How did that shite get in the Guardian?" He flops down, rampage over. "Harry had a grand laugh at my expense, as did
"Pleased to hear it. Now do as I ordered. Describe how you must look at this moment. Your willingness to serve will please me very much indeed," The captain licks his lips, "and more than you can possibly understand."
Wait. Hang on. Sherlock's nostrils flare. He smells Oust Odour Eliminator, by SC Johnson, those bastards. Why the little...John had planned this! He'd taken deviously clever measures! Damn the doctor's foresight. Chess is difficult enough, but now John's upped the ante. He's set the board for single-player Kriegspiel, which is ridiculous. Single-player Kreigspiel is impossible, he should save himself the trouble and resign right now. Sherlock Holmes is not playing against John, but rather himself; on one board, and sans umpire. Whilst the mystery's cleared up, the knowledge is distracting. Time to put it aside. He's no choice. His opening move must be a gambit.
John has got Sherlock, and Sherlock finds he fancies being gotten. Herding Sherlock with his weapons feels like a game of ping ping using cooking utensils.
exciting, and a truly useful exercise in discipline. I believe that I've learned a valuable lesson today, thanks to your guidance and expertise in the field of command." He coughs. "There's no need for us to stop, honestly."
"A Safeword is a specific word that we both agree upon, say, and easily recognize, yeah? Ah, see, for when and if one of us gets overwhelmed."
because you smashed them dead-center. Well done, you." Sherlock's voice is two octaves higher than normal.
John's high-pitched giggle mixes with his lover's. "Poodle? How the bloody hell did you come up with 'poodle'?"
Sherlock swears and wraps his legs monkey-like around his lover. John's right. Christ, the man's a genius! Sherlock thrusts forward and begins mindlessly grinding against his captain.  Gibberish dribbles off his tongue just as John goes deadly still. It's his tell. Suddenly, he's jacking Sherlock off, hard and fast and dirty. It's all too much for the poor genius. He screams and screams, ejaculate spurting once, twice, three, four times; so much spunk his abdomen looks white-washed.
Hello, dear readers. My life has become...crazy hectic, to put in bluntly. There have been so many times that I've been struck with lovely and pornographic inspiration whilst simultaneously trapped at work. By the time I arrive home I'm a zombie. Disadvantaged preschoolers will do that to a person *author's left eye twitching uncontrollably*.
"As such, those personnel charged with dereliction of duty are forthwith given the bullet. In civvie speak, 'administrative discharge', Private, a natural consequence for soldiers demonstrating 'temperamental unsuitability'. Trust me. Being turned out in front of your unit is utterly demeaning and disgraceful. Most soldiers would rather leave the army in a box than be dismissed due to blatant incompetence."
After self-reflection, I believe that from now on I will use the phrase "I digress" in every single work that I post. It's a very "Sherlock Holmes" thing to say. In addition, as an ADHD individual, it's my brain's personal motto - whether I like it or not. Ooh look, candy!
Whilst not the consultant's preferred sample collection method, Sherlock once solved a case by licking clues off the pavement in a car park. John had refused to kiss him for a week; wielding Sherlock's toothbrush to fend him off, agile as a fencing master. Will John want to snog if his lips are carpeted in sock lint? He thinks not. Sherlock places his tongue resolutely behind his teeth and thinks.
Private Holmes melts, sinking low into the woodwork. It's an odd look for a man vain about his stature. John finds that he likes it. He likes it very much so. "Humour me. Surely you've developed
The thought of utter helplessness, being lost to John's most deviant whims, is not as disturbing as it ought to be.
"Bloody hell, are you serious?" Sherlock squawks, sounding unhinged. "What in Christ's name are you playing at?"
, mind, ruins his experiment. Second, his flatmate is being a high-minded twat about acknowledging said destruction. Third, and most disturbing, is that John is scaring him shitless. Sherlock's bollocks feel shriveled and tight, drawn up so far up in his body that they might as well be diagnosed undescended.
Observations bombard Sherlock's brain at breakneck speed, too quick for even his superior mind to parse. John's thrown a one-two punch of "What the fuck?", and the detective reels back hard, slamming into the backrest with a pop. Sherlock forgives himself for the flood of adulation he feels, in awe of John's formidable grace.
before the muscle re-establishes its normal sinus rhythm. John's super-heated, hard heaving body has the power to shut down his heart. It's only upon deducing this fact that Sherlock thinks to open his eyes.
"Hmmm," John drinks it up, each sexy syllable. "At long last, you speak the truth. Carry on, Holmes. I like where this is going."
"Oh, yes. Bravo!" The captain claps. "Now stick that fine arse up farther, high as it will go without you straining yourself - no, Holmes, keep your head down. Christ, man, you're a soldier!" John scolds. "Carry on, hoist that luscious arse higher! Up! Up! Holmes,you lazy git, you're the human equivalent of a rubber-band. Keep on!" Sherlock grunts with effort and does as John says. "That's it, wonderful. I said
He disappears. It's like a magic trick. Bloody hell. Sherlock's flesh numbs, freezing solid. He's been heartlessly abandoned by John. This was a trick, a malicious jest purposefully wounding his heart. He's been played. He's been cruelly cast away, discarded into a vat of liquid nitrogen. Sherlock heart flutters to a stop. What a remarkably disconcerting development. Panicked, the genius counts -
The captain shifts, aims, and fires - lock, stock, and barrel. He ploughs remorselessly through the lanky bastard's rim and doesn't stop until fully seated. Garbled words spit from his mouth, intermixed with curses. John shuts him right up with a fierce kiss.
John's proposal is, in the purest sense, a valid question. For what reason has the detective indulged in romance if he scorns it? And why with John Watson, of all people? These queries, never vocalized, have all led to the doctor's provocative proposition. What exactly, does Sherlock consider the doctor's purpose in his life? Has he achieved full partnership, or is he viewed as an entry-level assistant?
Private Holmes's held stock-still since John left off, which, come to think of it, is very odd. Bugger food, what truly whets Sherlock's appetite is the certainty that he'll get to show off. Nothing feeds his ego like a taste of    righteous indignation, stockpiling John's accolades for afters.
that he's feeling? Fear of John? His skin crawls at the thought. He'd flee the flat willy-nilly if he wasn't so woefully turned on.
'til the bottom of his lobe faces the ceiling. "Ow! John...what the hell! John?" Sherlock squeaks, squirming at the unfamiliar sting. "Exactly what do you think you are doing?" Inexplicably, his hands remain passive and still, resting on the bones of John' hips.
furious can you imagine about my absconding with the Hep A liver infected with Herpes Simplex 12 after the autopsy of the prostitute do you recall the sex worker, who was garroted and subsequently dumped in an abandoned kip directly outside Manches..."
"No, you sodding twat, I was not," the little man actually smirks. "So very sorry, my love. Especially since I've a use for those later."
Conflicting expressions cross the detective's face; pleasure, amusement, pique, and lastly chagrin. "John, forgive me. It was but a silly joke..."
Sherlock freezes, falling mute. His lips stretch in a silent scream, John languidly roaming up to suck and nip at his sac. His rim muscles pulse in invitation, and John takes it as such. He spits a solicitous gob of saliva atop the hole to ease the way and wades in, gently stretching. The genius cries thanks to the almighty with less-than-holy language. John matches Sherlock's tribute right back, "Lovely, so lovely, darling. Take it, take my fingers." He adds another and then another and then one more, rotating; easing the way, whilst ramping up the tension.
"Oh, dear, soldier. I'd advise you to in the strongest terms to never use foul language whilst addressing an officer, unless it's your goal to incite trouble." John's next words come in the form of a harshly delivered whisper. "Are you
The following few days pass equably enough, much to the genius's chagrin. John had woken up, flashed a wry smile, kissed the tip of Sherlock's nose, and wandered bare-arsed into the kitchen to fill the kettle. Nary a wink or lewd grin crossed his lips. It was if that night's events were but a dream, but Sherlock knew otherwise; how else explain the evidence of chafed skin and sore bum? Nay, John had taken him good, taken him hard. Sherlock wanted John to do it again.
"I'm in awe of your brilliance on the scene of a crime as you know, and quite frankly", John groans, "your skill in the bedroom." He caresses Sherlock's pinked cheek. "A multi-talented genius, you are." John grinds his hard cock against Sherlock's. Sherlock's cock is now hard as well.
It's a plan. He's done as John commanded, as John wished. He's deduced his blogger's up until now secret kink. Sherlock runs over the knowledge, trembling with excitement. Apparently, he'd been been keeping secrets, too; except in this case, he'd hidden the facts from himself.
"Well then, explain this slip into insanity!" Sherlock snarls, trying like hell to save face. He spits out a bitter string of insulting invective, not pausing for breath or proper punctuation. "John! This experiment was a crucial determinant to aid in the identification of the unique molecular structure of an until-now unrecognized lethal foot fungus with only one single inadequate skin sample which I was forced to collect during Molly's lunch break because she's
are going to keep your gorgeous lips shut and listen - or I'll seal them myself with glue." He eases off with a smirk.
Suddenly aware of his foolish perseverance, Sherlock snaps at his brain to piss off. He's blithely submitted his will to another human being. Isn't it right that he allow his transport carte-blanche? It's a struggle, cold hard reason being his touchstone, but bloody hell. The sensations he's experiencing trump his genius and stability.
"Sir?" Private Holmes cheeps. John's prowling, slipping up behind him; a fox stalking a wee baby rabbit. He must be hovering within a scant few inches going by the sudden sensation of warmth. The small man generates heat like a boiler. Christ, is it - is it
Sherlock considers his options, calculating the distance to the closest exit. He'd rather not brain himself on the wall. John knows his detective, he
"Overwhelmed?" Sherlock moves past mortification to intrigue. Quite intense intrigue. "Overwhelmed in what manner, pray tell?" His hands triangulate over his chin.
Anyway, I felt compelled to post what is obviously twaddle and I'm not sorry. I'm too tired. It's likely redundant. I've no clue of what I've already written. Please help me out and let me know if I am repeating myself? Honestly, it's been 15K of whinging drivel and raging hard-on's. If I was at all competent, John and Sherlock would have shagged like rabbits 13K words ago. I apologise to those who came for straight-up porn. One day, readers, one day.
He's physiologically evolved past the corporeal need for sleep, preferring to engage in mental exercise whilst cuddled aside his love, his John, his darling little silver-haired spoon.
A prelude to something new in the bedroom. Yay! This story was close to being dead in the water, and I didn't want that to happen.
The constraints on Sherlock's person are inconvenient, but hardly onerous. Taking on a Holmes is risky business. It hardly ever ends well for the contestant. Besides, his John is the tea to Sherlock's cake, a matched set. Yes, it's in the thrill of the chase, blood pumping through their veins, yes, just the two of them, up against the
Labeling Sherlock as a "Control Junkie" is fundamentally, a very bad idea; inappropriate, as well...
Sherlock's missing the gist of John's question. Point in fact, he's no fucking clue of life in general. He doesn't know. Sherlock doesn't know. He just wants to get laid! Up to snuff? What, precisely, is John
John lunges in, snogging Sherlock within an inch of his life. The men flounder about, each struggling for physical control. To John's secret delight, piteous whimpers escape Sherlock's lips. It would horrify the genius to recognize these utterances as his own. They're desperate, the mewling of a cat rampant with heat. Fortunately for them both, Sherlock's mind is lost in oblivion. His brain has switched off, floating in a chemical flood of lust.
There's John's stance is radiating danger. He's a devil in disguise. The man's a former soldier, primed for giving orders. He still, still has bad days, however infrequent they might be. Sherlock shakes his head, trying to clear the fog of desire clouding his thoughts. Whatever machinations his flatmate has on his docket, they begin with sensory deprivation and some rather serious bondage. Sherlock feels rather a fool. Why hadn't he seen this one coming?
Sherlock's body writhes so energetically he feels he's doomed to tumbling off the mattress. He's so sensitive he fears he'll not last two minutes; that is, if and when John ever decides to bugger him. He mewls, keens, cries out, a kitten drowning in a burlap sack.
He jumps to his feet, clutching the picture like a talisman. This. That? How atrocious! Despite the poor photo quality, the pictures are salacious; and appallingly, wickedly on point. Try as he might, an unmanly squeak leaves his lips.
Sherlock watches as John's expression switches from desirous, to chagrined, to embarrassed, all in one breath. "Stand back up, luv," he sniffs. "Huh. I became carried away, what with all of your cheekbones. Eh, there's something we need to agree upon before we. You know. Get on with it." John flaps the ribbon in the air. "Yeah?"
"You Sir, highly lauded officer of the illustrious RAMC, intend on either: one, fingering me senseless until I'm primed for bottoming without discomfort; or, two, are prepared to execute an annual regulation physical and prostate exam."
"Ayyy!" Sherlock yips in shock as small, capable hands squeeze his backside. John's well-groomed nails dig right in, leaving ten red half-moons scattered about his rear. Sherlock's arse is in flames. He finds he very much likes it that way.
Abandoning his dearest bound, blind and gasping; gagging to be fucked, and literally pickling in his juices? Giving a huff, Sherlock peels himself off the cushions. He ignores the viscous mucous dripping out his nose, mostly, the flavour of dead, unwashed bovine being the greater challenge.
The circles of lightly abused flesh ought be displayed, ruby-studded bracelets gifted to one's mate. Sherlock gasps, love crashing over him in a wave. John is...John is John. John is everything, and more. He, Sherlock Holmes, is an arse.
He's distracted from this thought by a riotous chattering of activity. Curious, Sherlock flicks his gaze up towards the racket. A slight error in judgement perhaps, face buffeted by a deluge of...something. It's a swarm, 4.2 by 3.4 inch photographs. How very apropos. The photos rain on him like painful pointy-cornered missiles. Polaroids. Why did they have to be Polaroids? He's in a one-man lethal ticker tape parade.
Sherlock thunked to his knees, hands clasped in front of his groin. He couldn't help it. He pressed them to his cock.
"No, Sir! Yes, Sir! Right away, Sir!" The detective's mind has gone bye-bye. He's not a genius, nor a detective. Sherlock's just a muppet in John's Army primed for dury. Sherlock's held, helpless under Captain Watson's thumb. Oddly, the condition is freeing, offering up his will to John. He believes in John. John champions him when others doubt. He loves John. He loves John. He loves John.
Well, he's here for a reason, might as well figure out why. Bowing his head - why risk a Mind Palace eyeball, Sherlock waits until the end of the commotion.
Smiling to himself, Sherlock does as ordered. "Ahem. 'Boffin detective Sherlock Holmes caught snogging sycophant John Watson whilst taking a lift at New Scotland Yard. The newly constructed Met is furnished with fully-glazed lifts, as the photo above demonstrates.' An anonymous source who works close to the world-famous sleuth reports that Watson is a...', John," Sherlock smirks, "need I go on?"
Impossibly high-pitched giggles peal from the captain, puerile as a tin pot dictator "My, my, such a dire possibility, Private. Poor sod," he commiserates, clicking his tongue, "shame, that. I'm terribly fond of your bollocks."
Well, then. Plainly, John isn't yielding, and his obscenely jutting penis is a obvious white flag, tangled as it may be in his boxers. One can't win an event if ignorant of the rules. Sherlock huffs and drops his head in defeat.
There's a deeply scored imprint of eight teeth, the first four top and bottom. This goes far past a bit a playful spanking. The skin is turning deep purple, a ring of damaged capillaries spilling their contents in the interstitial tissue around the bite.
Sherlock can't control the rocking of his pelvis. He's beyond merely being mentally exhausted, the interminable banter is killing him. "Yes, Sir."
King: The king is the most important chess piece. The object of the game is to direct all the pieces to positions so that your opponent's king becomes defenceless.
Lust redirects a full twelve pints of blood to surge towards his groin. Sherlock's left light-headed, and dizzy with desire.
"Sherlock," John says coolly, "Come sit down." His eyes flicker to Sherlock's chair, then back up at His (bloody gorgeous) Nibs. "Come on, Sherlock, come over here...I won't bite. I promise."
"I'm concerned, soldier," John snarls from the vague area of the fireplace, "with your inability to obey a basic order. Now
John slips past the pocket door to the narrow zone between stove and kitchen table. It's a miracle that Sherlock didn't hear him creep in. John sends a mental thanks to his mum for fat toes. He scans the room for ideas. The room's a shambles, like always, still he spies a green-fuzzed fish slice in the sink and a tomato-y wooden spoon glued to the hob. Sherlock's such a massive prat when it comes to cleaning up; for the first time in his life, John approves. "By whose standards, soldier? I am not 'most men', and I don't want to be."
"I assume the term "hindquarters" refers to your arse?" John says, deftly fondling both cheeks before giving them a rigorous squeeze.
"Are you doing it, Holmes?" The Captain snaps Sherlock out of his reverie. "I think you must be going by the fact that you're panting like a bitch in heat."
For a few interminable minutes, the room is void of any sound besides Sherlock's panting. The anticipation of more tickling is intolerable; nevertheless, horribly exciting. He's gotten off more than once just by John tickling him senseless. The pause gives him respite, yet it's not enough. He's having kittens, horrid over-sized kittens with needle teeth and razor-sharp claws.
"Yes, Sir," the detective groans. "I'm up for anything, Sir." Blanching, Sherlock thinks that perhaps he should have explored the ramifications of that particular sentiment before voicing it.
Penetration of the Center: having fast, elite forces smash at a specific point in the enemy line while reserves hold your opponent and drive quickly and immediately for the enemy's base
"Do not think that it has escaped my attention,  that it took precisely thirty-three seconds for you to complete the required mission. Did it not, Private?" John pauses, waiting for some paltry excuse. Sherlock never appreciates being called out when he's functioned in any way less that extraordinary.
"I'm doing exactly what I should've done the moment I moved in. I'm asserting control over my life." The little man grins in an unfriendly way, an odd gleam reflecting in his eyes. It's more than a little bit not good. "And now, darling man, I'm asserting control over you." Giving another vicious tweak to his lover's red hot earlobe, John surges in for a kiss.
"No, no. Don't be like that." John prods, "Come on, give it another go, what's significant about my phone? You'll get it yet." He laughs at Sherlock's sullen moue. "Jesus, that goes without saying, you boffin wanker. You're bloody brilliant!"
Sherlock pauses to hedge his bets. Deciding it absolutely worth the risk, he jauntily ploughs on. "Mmmm - no, unfortunately not, Sir. I deemed the information noteworthy, therefore added it to my report."
"My my, Holmes," Watson sniggers, "if only you could see what I see." The pink tip of John's tongue cleaves his lips. "You're no better than a rent boy wiggling his arse, trying to hustle a few quid." The CO sounds cruelly amused. "Expecting to garner my favour? Think again, tart. You'll not get a crumb off of me." The Captain leans in close, close enough that Sherlock can feel his blogger's blazing body heat. "Did you really think you could, Private," John murmurs, inching nearer, "you slag of a two-penny whore?" Watson tosses out one last insult, then spins away. "Pathetic. I'd expect more from a self-proclaimed
"Mmmm, so lovely, but not quite right. Spread your legs, Private, prepare for a surprise inspection." Sherlock's skin is milky white, sinewy muscles flexing underneath. So lovely is right, the man's a goddamn sight of physical perfection. John croons approvingly watching Sherlock's bottom half unfurls like a peace lily warmed by morning sun. "Now bend your knees. I want to see everything you have to give." The genius whines and complies, utterly embarrassed. He's exposed, pinned. Sherlock's imagination runs rampant. He rifles through his sex index for acts of coitus specific to this position. The majority are acceptable to his sense of decorum. A few of them cause his gorge to rise.
Sherlock deletes the data with a poof. He's nervous, feeling unaccountably bereft by John's distance; alone and lost in unending darkness. It's bad form to complain, though, the captain made that transparent. Private Holmes chews his lip and says nothing.
"Christ in heaven, man. Don't be obtuse! Have you done what I ordered, you know, imagine yourself? Mind Palace? Tell me, Holmes. Are you cooperating with the inquest, or are you for a second time taking the piss?" John sniffs. "Further acts of insubordination would be incredibly unwise, soldier, unless you
"Quite. A good soldier, a competent soldier, is prepped for action 24/7.  At any moment, any hour..." John ghosts out the warning into his ear. " Any minute," he breathes hot air and wiggles a finger into Sherlock's sensitive cleft, "the enemy might launch an offensive."
He cringes at the gaff but steadies his nerve, waiting for additional well-earned censure. Sherlock waits, chewing his cheeks to nip his desire to snivel in the bud. The new recruit waits, his luscious, sculpted upper lip befittingly stiff. The detective waits, tapping his bulldog tenacity. The genius waits, brain steeping in anxiety. He waits, seriously discomfited by John's inaction.
"Thank you," the private pants wetly, lapdog he. "Captain Watson, I...thank you." Sherlock's language skills are crumbling and the transport's clearly gone daft. He's shivering, quivering, quaking painfully, a sodding mess.
There's a split plank of oak in the hallway. Besides being a death trap for splinters, it squalls like a cat in the Thames. They've circumvented that board since the day John yanked what for all intents and purposes was a shiv from his toe. Yet, glued to the couch; bound, blind and gasping, aching and spent, his nerve endings overly-sensitized, Sherlock hears it squeal. He snaps out of his fog only to find soggy clots of...something...in his mouth. Ah, balled-up bits of grimy well-worn leather. Christ, at some point, he's gone and gnawed the upholstery.
"An absolutely stunning synopsis, Holmes. Well done, you," John jeers, pinching his lover's skinny hip. "Try again, genius. Tell me," he breaths, "What you see."
"Two?" John titters madly. "Two. Not what I expected. Fine, alrighty, then. Do carry on." Feeling playful, John reaches in to tweak both of Sherlock's nipples.
"Forgive my impertinence, Sir, but will you grant me a trial period for me to prove it? If given time and your guidance, if you please."
Cut the cackle, Sherlock does NOT have a foot fetish; how dare one  suggest such a thing. Sex kinks are deviant and unpalatable and repugnant. It's simply common knowledge, like that pengwings inhabit the Amazon. Besides, Sherlock only sucks, nibbles and laves on John's feet when physically forced into doing so, say, when John's toes his socks off in bed.
John's reply comes in the form of a two-toned, noncommittal hum, unconsciously mimicking their doorbell. This is closely followed by the
John presses in hungrily, consuming everything that Sherlock has on offer. Although no dummy, John doesn't have the skill-set to see. Sherlock Holmes, that self-absorbed, stubborn-arsed maniac of a man, has already offered himself up. He's arranged on a platter, a ripe, rosy apple held between full lips.
Sherlock arches, lost in ecstasy over John's adulation. He'll admit it, he's a praise whore. "Yours." The captain steps away and then back, whereon he feels cool air wafting over his feet. Odd, is John blowing on him?
He parses through recorded data whilst simultaneously putting his tangled hair to rights. Neither task is going well.
that? Were the blazes did he come from? Sherlock wobbles, rocking on his heels until his spine smacks against the hard steel door handles, no much better. Nose presently out of commission, the detective focuses on the kitchen's air currents. John uses Sherlock's distraction over the pain to snatch the slippery fish slice. Uck, last week's curry. It will have to do.
"I find this inquiry dull." Yes, John's definitely in the kitchen. It's obvious from the - "I'd do better drafting next month's duty roster."
The doctor leaps closer, like the well-trained medic that he is. Right enough, something type of liquid is dribbling down Sherlock's face from under his blindfold. It's vital John identify the source.
John bumps up and into Sherlock, gently navigating him back till his legs brace against the mattress. Sherlock cries out as he teeters, John borrowing his momentum to press his lover down to a sit. Sherlock's complicit vulnerability is sweet and strangely compelling. The man doesn't trust easily, if at all. Still, here he sits; blind, naked, and compliant at John's bidding.
He'd be defenceless, and well...blind to the captain's mercurial whims. He'd stand - or lay - or kneel -
the doctor snips, "mind me now, or there will be unpleasant consequences. Be. Still." John frowns irritably as his lover plows on, his words completely ignored. Reaching forward with a practiced surgeon's thumb and one forefinger, he ruthlessly locks onto Sherlock's left earlobe and pinches.
"Sir," Sherlock snivels, struggling to gain some composure. "Despite the risk of sounding like a spoilsport, at this juncture the single data worth broaching is the impending - and painful - rupture of my testicles."
I am working on wrapping this one up so that I can get working on a lengthy and very exciting crossover. Also, I'm going to tidy up The Holmes series and try to finish it before I start wearing dentures. If it seems like I'm leaving this with loose ends, be assured that I'll revive it when I get writer's block. The same goes with the Sally/Jim busting chops thingamajig. It is why these two stories were started in the first place.
Sherlock can't avoid it, being analytical due to an inherited maternal gene gone mad. He's been cursed by the compulsion to experiment, to postulate, to take control, to
Sherlock squawks, too petrified to muster a reply. The best he can manage is a wobbly nod, sweat seeping beneath the blindfold to burn his eyes. Beads of perspiration trickle down his face and pool in his philtrum. Sherlock licks the salt away and can't fathom why John likes the flavour. Frankly, he smells like a stink badger.
"That's rich, soldier," John chortles, "and how so? Explain to me, oh wise one, using small words in compensation for my idiocy, how insubordination is a plus? That argument's a bit thick for my taste." He begins pacing, feet punching holes in the floorboards.
Sherlock's left eyebrow rockets a full inch above the blindfold. Secretly, John's impressed. "Interesting. Care to share?"
Sherlock's lips press to form a straight line. John pockets his phone. He needs the use of both hands. There's a fumbling of skin against metal, followed by a horrid grating. The detective's brain shifts into top gear.
"Hmm, I'll assume that this is an affirmative, Private?" The captain chuckles, deep and dirty in his throat. "So. Let's begin."
Sherlock adjusts his knees, resuming his former position. He's irritated with himself, disrupting John's game like some virgin. What if John thinks that he's broken him, Sherlock a toy too fragile to bother playing with? "Sir?" he says, as steadily as he can muster. "I haven't safe-worded, Sir." John does not answer. "Am I done making amends, Captain, or shall we continue?" No.
John smartly snaps the newspaper, folding it in half, and then quarters. "Hand me a biro, will you? I've figured it out on my own. Surprising, really, considering that I'm a complete idiot. Yes, now I have it. It starts with a capital "s".
Apparently the Mus musculus so recently in residence have moved on to greener pastures. Hudders will be so pleased. He's wishing the little vermin had remained, nibbling on the newspapers and leaving their tiny dried pellets like a calling card. The hush, the hush is unnerving. Mrs. Turner upstairs has either been stabbed, strangled in her bed, or gone out. The people of Baker St. have gone to ground. Radio silence. Sherlock wants to scream, wants to throw himself to his stomach, kick his size 11 feet and pound his fists.
Kriegspiel: ('War game') an unorthodox game in which the players are blind to the other player's moves. (Just like "Battleship", sans lights and buzzers) Players must deduce their opponent's pieces position by asking an umpire pre-approved questions. The umpire then reports captures and/or checks with each move. The umpire also provides opponents with new clues.
John is well-pleased. He doesn't know that his face shows it. The doctor's too busy  feasting his eyes on the dithering detective, and it's marvelous. Holmes is deliciously defenceless and he knows it, hence the dithering. John's ears ring in the quiet, clear evidence of the genius's brain on full boil. It's too much, and John's gone desperate. He's practically gagging for a taste of his lover's milky, salt-laden skin. John's inner captain clears his throat and orders his libido to stand down. Captain Watson can wait, he's been trained. Besides, it's treat enough contemplating Sherlock's fat dripping cock, bobbing back and forth whilst slapping against his belly. Captain Watson's eyes crinkle, basking in his indomitable self-discipline. Little John Hamish, on the other hand, relishes the payback.
"No, I don't want 'tea'," John snarls, aping his partner's tone, "you twat. What I want is a bloody explanation for today's news!" He pursues his query by slapping that morning's paper over Sherlock's head. "Now!"
, and then the other. He's gratifyingly pleased that Sherlock's groans, one for each hit, have been of lust. "Now, Holmes. Shall we continue, now that the conditions for making amends have been made clear?"
"Private, you bloody dip stick, on your feet!" The captain bawls, moving off, blessedly taking his treacherous fingers with him. Sherlock heaves in one ragged breath after another of beautiful oxygen. He tastes iron. He'd chewed his tongue until it bled. Ouch. Sherlock wills himself not to beg for release. Yes he will - no, he won't. He won't. "Holmes," the harangue resumes, John again a distance away. "Your field performance is disgraceful."
“Lestrade! The killer just ran outside!” Sherlock grabbed the D.I.’s arm and turned him around and pointed to an unsuspecting victim of his scheme.
“You’ll have wet pants all day, unless of course you want to wear them in the cup and then go without them while they dry.”
Sherlock struggled fiercely against his restraints with every inch of his being. Before leaving Moriarty flashed a wicked smile and started a clock that had been set up near the dollhouse, causing the door keeping John in his small cube within the dollhouse to open.
“When will you grow up Sherlock?” Mycroft sighed and approached the table, lifting the scarf up to reveal a pouting detective and annoyed John.
“Lock? You still up?” he saw his still shorter flatmate sitting on the edge of the couch, elbows on his knees and hands supporting his head. He looked depressed with his violin next to him.
John looked up at that, still in a confused daze from his sudden consciousness, “Sorry… what was that?”
“I’m going to fucking burst.” He whined desperately. His hand went to his stomach, shocked by how much Mycroft had forced inside him.
John took in a sharp breath, “Shit, yea.” He had nearly forgotten about him. Sherlock had meant a great deal to his brother, no matter how much either of them tried to hide it. “Not doing well then?”
Sherlock could hear John in the other room as he treated the cut, he sat quietly staring at his laboratory equipment, his mind raced.
The edges of Mycroft’s eyes had a bit of white. Greg filled the gap between them as he kissed him softly, praying that may have some affect. He nearly sobbed as his cheek and neck were gently cupped and the kiss was returned.
“Funny, you were so desperate to leave when you were first confined, then after I let you, you refused to leave. Didn’t want to see anyone you use to know or let people think you’ve become an invalid.” Mycroft remarked dryly.
John groaned at the sound of his phone going off, it was still lying on the bed where he had left it. He could only hope that whoever it was would come looking for him and get him out.  A thought flashed across his mind. Could it be Lestrade?! He yelled out as loud as he could, hoping he was just outside trying to get in. He still fumbled desperately at the door in the dark but nothing seemed to work.
“It was huge!” Lestrade tried to regain his breathing while also backing the hell away from where the tarantula ran. In the poor lighting he bumped into something behind him, he turned to find an oddly placed chair, the majority of dead bees where around it. Stranger yet, the chair had loose ropes tied to it with a pile of clothes on it.
“Are you going on a date?” She gave a small joking gasp. “Oh John! I’m so excited for you! I knew there must be someone you’ve been flirting with. You always look so happy in class now, texting away with someone on your phone. Rushing out the door to get somewhere, I’ve been on to you.”
Lestrade sighed as the two men came back, “Again, I’m really sorry John, I-“ the DI trailed off as he noticed the two men were holding hands. “Erm, but anyway, Sherlock- the uh, bodies, any ideas?” he tried his best to pretend he hadn’t noticed.
“He always is,” John went for one of the cups, not wanting to waste his efforts. “But why this time? Its just a bit of rain. Besides, I know you too well, you’re obviously not staying in just because he told you too.”
John clenched his jaw at Sherlock’s rude remark. He wasn’t getting anywhere near the water if he could avoid it, but as he shuffled out of the cab, he noticed Sherlock’s odd expression.
“The Thames.” Sherlock’s face was illuminated by the glow of his phone as he typed something out on it.
Lestrade was stunned. Was it possible John really had just gone to the gym and simply left out the back door before coming home?
“Oh shush.” John pulled him in closer and raised himself on his toes to kiss the back of Sherlock’s neck. “Mine apparently do.”
“You make me look taller by comparison, people don’t notice you as much which is good when we’re under cover or on stake outs, just more convenient really. Besides, if you were any taller that bullet would have gone through your heart and not your shoulder. You’re just the right size.” Once he reached the bathroom he gently lowered John’s body into the bathtub, back resting against the edge so he could sit up.
John looked over at Mycroft, he stopped making his finger movement against Sherlock’s palms. The answer that would follow made him nervous.
“That’s why you have me.” Sherlock stood up and poured a cup of hot water placing it down in front of John.
“Fire downtown in an empty warehouse. Could be nothing but…” he paused to see the DI was hanging on his every word. “Earlier before we knew Sherlock was taken, I was scanning various cameras when I came across some interference in that same area. I assumed the cameras were just down at the time, now I’m not so sure. Well, I’m off then.”
Lestrade lost sight of the direction Sherlock had pointed in, for a brief moment as he looked back between the people in the crowded club he could have sworn he saw Sherlock kissing the person who had attacked Sally. Which was impossible of course.
John paused, looking back. Sherlock almost thought he had heard him for a moment. John ran his tongue nervously over his lip, “You- you wouldn’t mind would you?” his voice was a low whisper, not meant for anyone to hear. “I know this is horribly sentimental. You would have scoffed.” John stepped closer to the bed.
John swallowed thickly. The look Sherlock had on his face was eerily similar to yesterday when they were at the beach. The way he stared off at the Thames had been strange enough, almost forgetting he had done it at all immediately after.
The first night John seemed to have no idea he was ever human and insisted on sleeping in Sherlock’s bed with him. Sherlock would never admit to cuddling cat John or kissing his head.
“Then what’s he doin’ on the floor?” The teen leaned closer to get a better look but John was already feeling too drowsy to care.
It was a few months after the trial that Moran found himself walking to his apartment that he could barely keep on money he didn’t have, that three men attacked him. It was a pathetic effort by all accounts. The man that tried hitting behind the head with a baseball bat was loud as could be with his approach, Sebastian caught his arm as he swung, and promptly sent him flying over his shoulder and onto the asphalt below. The second one came at him from his left with a pipe, Moran dodged it easily, taking the pipe from his attacker on his second swing and knocking him out with it. The third man had enough brains to bring a gun, which was on the ground a second after Sebastian saw it and hit his hands with the pipe. He pushed the darkly clothed man against the ally wall, pipe firmly against his throat, slowly cutting off the air flow but with just enough space for shallow breaths.
Sherlock had sprinted off to the crime scene the moment he was out of the cab, John trailed behind pausing briefly to not the crowd just behind the crime scene tape holding up picket signs.
He wanted to say but pressed his mouth tightly closed knowing the Moriarty would take every chance he could- consent was never too important to him.
Something fluttered just beneath Sherlock’s shirt, rippling the fabric under the water. John had barely caught the movement from the edge of his vision. He let his hand dip below the surface and hovered just above the material.
A slow creaking came from behind him. Sherlock’s head immediately shot over to it. The closet door had come open again.
Once the salt was cleaned up, John still sitting in his chair and looking aimlessly down at the table while Sherlock tried desperately to touch anything, Mrs Hudson excused herself and left. John seemed unreachable to her now.
Besides, if you actually used a vibrator that I sent you, I figured you wouldn’t be opposed to me assisting. –
Mycroft put the phone on speaker and sat at Lestrade’s desk, “Apologies Gregory, but I must commandeer your computer.”
“I was hoping I could make it worth your while to buy him beforehand.” The voice outside the door sounded firm.
Sherlock tugged his arm with a quick jolt, John jerked back up and felt slightly more aware of himself. “You’re falling in and out of trance now. Hmm.” Sherlock pushed John’s shoulder’s lightly to put him back into an upright position as he still sat on his legs. “Now don’t fall asleep, just relax.”
“John… you have a purpose, you have to keep living.” Sherlock felt worse then dead, he felt broken. He realized for the first time that people don’t live for the sake of living, they live for those close to them. “You’re a doctor, you save lives. That’s a far better purpose then some people serve.”
The woman didn’t have enough breath in her to answer, she simply nodded ‘yes’ instead as she clutched hopelessly at the wire.
"Erm, right. Well, as much as I find him simply adorable, I would like my brother back to his original stunted size."
John really did try to move on after that. He showed up to work again. Made small talk. Even joined Lestrade for a pint twice, though their conversation on both occasions were short and meaningless.
“It… it was? Must be a draft…” John knew he didn’t shut it after his mad dash through the flat in false hope that Sherlock had come back.
“No… I’m sorry Lock but I have to stop this.” John disentangled himself from the bed and sheets, Sherlock looked up at him confused. “You aren’t in your right mind, it’s the only explanation.”
“He let me hypnotize him and to be fair that’s very tame compared to what people on the internet had suggested. Bit of a waist though, he makes tea for me when I ask anyway. It’s the most complex thing I got him to do, likely because the action is already ingrained in his memory.”
“Oh god…” He so easily could use it, that was why Sherlock had gotten it for him after all wasn’t it?
“Mycroft, I have had enough of your antics! You can’t keep me imprisoned here anymore! I know you think I’m your responsibility since the… accident, but I’m not!”
“Could you control any of that?” Greg drew back, doing what he could to try and read Mycroft’s features. His eyes had returned completely back to normal.
John rolled his eyes, of course he would know that, “Hang on now, why on earth would I stop talking to you?”
John grabbed the salt and marched his way back to the bedroom. “well, there are alternatives if you are actually interested.” He poured an exceptionally thick line blocking the closet doorway.
Been out for a few days with the flu, I’m still feeling very feverish and I’m not sure when I’ll be up for leaving the flat again. Sherlock’s still working on cases of course and has been surprisingly helpful at taking care of me while I’m ill.
John went quiet. He hadn’t meant to say that, not that he was hiding it really. He just didn’t know how to tell anyone yet and suddenly hoped terribly that Molly would be ok with this.
Sherlock blinked. He wasn’t really sure. He only knew that last night holding his blogger in his arms as he fell to sleep was strangely satisfying.
He grabbed his laptop and sat at the desk near by, snapping the top up as he went to his blog. There were a ton of comments about what had happened, he briefly scrolled through some before deciding he didn’t want to look at any of them. In the corner of the page he noticed he had a private message he hadn’t read yet, it pre dated Sherlock’s… John rubbed his eyes before opening it up.
Mycroft brought his hands to his temples and tried to massage them “I had to tell her that last year when you had the hair incident. I swear you plan horribly failed experiments to get out of things.”
“Didn’t even look to see who was at the door? Now that’s just rude.” Moriarty grinned. “Uh-ah, sit back down Sherlock, did you really think I wouldn’t bring a gun?”
Greg rolled his eyes. “Not… that.” FUCK, there it was. He let out a rather un-masculine yelp as the tip of Mycroft’s tentacle hit its mark. Sending waves of pleasure through him.
John crawled up onto the former detective’s bed and grabbed one of the pillows, holding it to his chest. “I thought… I thought that… oh god… Sherlock… I really thought I heard you calling me.”
“Only a genius could get out of this one, think you’ll disappoint me?” He casually strolled out with Moran behind him. He wasn’t sure if the detective really could think of a way out or not and that uncertainty excited him to no end. He wanted very much to win their game of cat and mouse, but winning was boring when it was too certain.
Mycroft began scattering light kissed from his cheeks to his neck. He began unbuttoning his shirt to trail them over his chest as well, the tentacle still pumping into him the whole time.
“Trust me, it’s not a date. God. I think I scared the life out of him when I asked if it was the other day. He assured me he’s not interested in me that way through text today. ‘Sides, he’s not even gay.”
“Oh John, you worry so much! There’s no one here right now and if anyone comes in I’m sure you can pretend to be a doll.”
“No Sherlock! I have things to do. You’ll be back to normal soon enough anyway.” John slammed the door and left, leaving Sherlock alone and feeling rejected.
“Was wondering when we call the scene closed, we collected everything we could. Er, are you looking for something?”
“I know he makes you mad” Molly paused to catch her breath. “He makes everyone mad. But he probably didn’t mean whatever he did or said. Please come back?”
Sherlock had taken this in, always the experimenter. “I’m sorry John. But the couch in that position was just too uncomfortable. We’ll just have to sleep in one of the beds.”
John had gotten use to sneaking into his dorm quietly just in case Sherlock had already hacked his skype account and was taking away at the empty room. The night before however he had taken the precaution of turning his computer off. He locked his door, taking a moment to check the thickness of the walls, which appeared to be adequate. John brought out the slim smooth toy in question and swallowed hoarsely. It was firm yet soft at the same time. He carefully set it on the desk and looked at it for a moment, admiring the subtle curve and smooth texture. The box still sat just beneath his desk, he eyed it for a moment, only then noticing a small container inside. Curious, he brought the box closer and pulled the item out, it was a small bottle of lube that had apparently come with the purchase.
“Blimey… I though the couch was just drunk talk. You didn’t…. I mean, no heh, what am I saying? Of course you didn’t…”
It would be simple to merely pretend that he never opened it, yet he couldn’t just get rid of the box. Even if he had tried to take it back, Sherlock had sent it initially, wanted John to have it. Or at least that’s what John had told himself as an excuse to keep it.
“This is one of the weirdest things I’ve ever done.” At first John thought it was weird to scratch and pet his flatmate but after a few minutes it became strangely fun and he could swear the low baritone rumble vibrating the couch was Sherlock purring.
It was half past five when John stepped out of his pool sized sink from a bath, drying himself with a small hand towel. Two days of completely relying on Sherlock for everything was simply too much.
The tape was sped up, a man- presumably the person who lived in the flat at the time, going in and out with several boxes, obviously just moving in. At 2:59, John pressed play, the lights were out, the street looked like it had been quiet for a while by then. The lights suddenly came on at exactly 3, a few moments later the man came running out of the flat, leaving the door wide open.
Sherlock hid nearly every emotion he had ever felt, convinced that they couldn’t be real. He acted out his pretend life as a sociopath when in reality he felt emotions very deeply, but was unsure what any of them meant, convincing himself that they weren’t real.
“I’m going to pretend I didn’t hear that. Scene’s inside freak.” Donovan gestured them towards a door to a large building and looked John up and down.
it usually meant something bad. He took the cup and drank it all in one gulp. To his surprise it even tasted like tea.
Sherlock marched back over and grabbed John by the arm “John, you aren’t even listening to me deduce what happened! I need you by me.”
“John… I’m here. I’m right here, I need you to imagine me as solid right now, can you do that for me?” John nodded and Sherlock could feel his form becoming more physical again as he knelt down and wrapped his arms around him. “That’s right. Keep thinking like that. You’re still asleep, but it’s really me. I’ll be right by your side again when you wake up, you just wont be able to see me and it’s unlikely you’ll hear me very often, but I’ll be there. If you ever need to make sure I am, just ask, and I’ll do everything I can to let you know I’m there.”
John stuffed the whole pack in his pocket before retuning to the bath, only planning on offering Sherlock one of them.
The end of this story and many plot points were known to me when I first started writing this. I just want you to know that nothing has changed and the original plot and ending will still be the same.
“I am really uncomfortable with you doing this right now.” John couldn’t muster his stern voice anymore with those milky white hands so close to his crotch. He nearly yelped when Sherlock yanked them off and threw them to where his shirt also lay unceremoniously.
“So, um, not to sound like an idiot… but what exactly do I do with it?” damn it to hell, Sherlock looked like a school boy caught with a dirty magazine, he had to press this another step further. John pulled the box out from under the desk, making sure it was in Sherlock’s view.
John swallowed a rather large gulp of earl grey. Doing all that weird research the day before really helped. Cold spots usually meant something was building. Was Sherlock about to try something?
The headlines had died down significantly but every now and then there could still be an article found discussing the fraudulent claims of the late consulting detective. John hadn’t read a newspaper since that first day though. There was no point; he knew what they all said.
John sighed, he wasn’t positive that it was the best idea, but perhaps the water could help bring his fever down. “Fine… just take your shirt and trousers off.” He turned the knob on and blocked the drain.
There was the feint sight of lightening from their window, likely still quite far off from them. Mycroft gripped the handle of his umbrella, twirling it once before standing. “Thank you Dr. Watson, but I’m afraid I really must go.” He shot Sherlock a look. “Unless of course you would consider coming with, brother?”
John caught the subtle concern that shot across his flatmat’s face. “Yup, I think that’s the one. I pick that one.”
“I really do… but it’s the only thing I have that can hide them…” Sherlock looked down in defeat. “Triple homicide John…”
"It's alright." His voice remained soft and he pushed Sherlock backwards against the miniature pillows. "I have you." He repositioned himself into their previous straddling position. "You don't need to know anything, not right away." He could see the desire in Sherlock's eyes, but also the fear. "It's just like kissing. You like kissing?" Sherlock nodded wordlessly.
The perfectly audible sound of shoe heels clack against the sitting room floor. "Now, Holmes, I've put forth a question, and have not as yet received a reply. You know how I hate to repeat myself," John sniffs, once again hovering just out of reach.
"Ah. Er, thank you, Sir. For myself, my story is strictly nonfiction. Captain Watson, as a young person, years before settling on a career, I found decency a rare trait among men. My opinion hasn't changed since achieving manhood," Sherlock breaks off. "A disappointment, obviously enough, but no tragedy. Homo Sapiens' corrupt nature is inbred. Look at me, I'm pants at self-control. I expect that I've inherited that from my father. He was wont to stray - "
Sherlock sucks in as much oxygen as he can muster, expelling it so quickly he risks hyperventilation. "John, Captain, Christ Almighty! That's...damn you, and double damn your horrid tool of torment. A Pavo cristatus tail feather, John? Really?"
"I see a foolish private acting out of bounds, Sir. He's incorrigible, not fit for duty. He needs to be taken in hand."
"Going to fuck you, 'Lock, bugger you so deep you'll taste my come in your mouth." Sherlock cries out, mewls shooting up an octave as John  to suck and worry the tips of both taut nipples. He thrashes, head rolling round to drop hard, driving directly into John's scar. Too involved in pleasing his lover, the pain doesn't even register. No, the repercussions arise much later as the endorphins ebb away.
"So. Interesting, as I said, as the motive remains unclear. Pictures, possibly, if unlikely. Now, the impetus for the lube extraction," and here is where Sherlock stops, stymied. For all his educated ways, John has absolutely no problem milking every last germ-infested molecule from its container. It's ridiculous, really; they've more than enough, enough lubricant for a lifetime. So, why nick it from the surgery at all? If procured for its sterile aspect, why break the seal? John planned his shenanigans ahead of time whilst he carried on oblivious. He'd not seen this coming, damn it. Why? Why?
to make trouble, Holmes?" The captain steps back, and then again. Two more steps in that direction should just about do it.
Normally, if Sherlock looks desperate enough, John gives in - whether he's in the mood or not. Sherlock can be very persuasive. The detective set those gorgeous green eyes on his lover and instantly deduced John's desires and dislikes. Sherlock can get John hard, no matter what.
"Yes, well," the private's feathers slightly ruffled by the slur, "nevertheless, I lay unawares of its presence until you un-pocketed it." Sherlock, keen on using body language, unwittingly folds his arms. "What is unclear here is if it was concealed intentionally to render me complacent. Very unclear. You were born prepared and willing to take on anything; ergo you keep your phone close."
Sherlock had managed to pique his interest beyond the normal appeal he held for young, good-looking men, he had presented an allure beyond the expected and that was most likely the reason why Magnussen chased him so determinedly now.
They silently eyed each other but Mycroft who had mastered this type of game since his early teens, had no problem remaining calm and waiting under the expectant stare of the other man. The only other true opponent in this force of wills who had occasionally managed to have him beat, was Sherlock of course, not normally a person who thrived in playing the waiting game but who could master it occasionally out of sheer stubbornness.
“Why the hell not? In fact I’m having a spectacular time! Watching your fiancé being all kinds of possessive for everyone to see, pressing kisses to your mouth as if he wanted to eat your bloody face!”
Mycroft noticed the door to the library silently fall open and expected to see his brother appear in the doorway. It was only Sherlock other than himself who were ever still awake at this late hour, and even Mycroft was usually in bed by now, but certain work-related events had kept him glued to the computer screen far longer than he had anticipated.
But just as he was bracing himself against the onslaught, the man in front of him suddenly stumbled and lost his balance, falling down on his knees in a staggering motion.
“You can’t seriously tell me that you have already admitted defeat at this early stage, Mycroft. But if you are not willing to assist in the rescue of your own brother, I will have to do it on my own.”
“....I miss you, John,” they finally came, the voice strangely small and pitiful for a man with a personality that usually was larger than life.
As Sherlock once again opened his mouth to protest John raised the riding crop while he tutted disapprovingly.
“Well now that you mention it.....your eating habits and the smoking is something I actually don’t approve of.”
“Forgive me, I should introduce myself. My name is Victor Trevor. Engaged to be married to your patient, Sherlock Holmes. I thought it was time we finally met. As I said, I have been hearing much of your work and as I missed your appointment with Sherlock earlier today I decided to stop by and meet the man who has been in charge of caring for the most important person in my life.”
His grip around the hair roots tightened for a second as he tilted the younger man’s head back so their eyes could meet.
Mycroft who had arrived shortly after John’s discovery of the room where Sherlock was kept, was pale as sheet when looking down on his little brother’s lifeless body, and at first unable to utter a single word, as if frozen from shock.
Ever since the hospital had called to inform him of his brother’s admittance he had experienced a whole string of emotions that only Sherlock was ever capable of bringing out in him – everything from shock, worry, anger, then anguish quickly turning into relief and actual happiness for a brief moment when he was informed that Sherlock was doing fine and would be released the next morning.
“How do you know that is the safe where my truly secrets possessions are being kept?” he had asked and with Mycroft it was difficult to tell if he was pulling his leg or actually indicating that Sherlock was clueless on the subject. It had been highly infuriating.
“I thought you said he had an important meeting in London today? That he wouldn’t be back for hours!”
The thing Sherlock was now about to do would definitely fall under the category of not acceptable in John’s book. But as he and Mycroft had so adamantly insisted that he take this case, they would be forced to realise that Sherlock had his own way of doing things. That was after all why he was so successful at what he did.
Not that he felt insecure exactly, this was far more his element that Magnussen’s flat and that owner’s doings, but nevertheless, Dr Roylott hade the advantage of being an unknown variable so far. What exactly was it that he wanted?
John wasn’t even remotely interested in spending another second in his presence and he wondered how Sherlock had ever been able to bare it.
Sherlock in general got up to all kinds of trouble, but as long as he came home unharmed and it didn’t affect Mycroft personally, he usually let it slide.
No time to remain lingering at home when there was work to be done and with determined steps he walked towards his bathroom to prepare himself for what the day had on offer.
Instead of focusing on John, wasn’t it better if Victor’s attention was turned towards the real culprit among them?
The car showing up now was therefor most likely Mycroft’s doing, and in the end, it didn’t matter, John wasn’t going to take the offered ride back to the house anyway.
“Why would a few hours alone, working on a case you yourself initially assigned to me, mean that I somehow have treated John unfavourably? I left the phone behind because I didn’t need it, not because you two should read it as a sign for you to interfere.”
Leaning over him, the unexpected sight of Mycroft in a taupe-coloured pyjama, a heavy dressing gown of the same colour and slippers on his feet, looming over his younger brother, his hands firmly holding one of Sherlock’s limp ones while he looked the very epitome of worry, caught John by surprise.
“Of course it was. Do you really think Mycroft voluntarily would stoop so low as to come in person and ask you to come back when he cold have easily replaced you with one of his own goons the minute you walked out of the door? Fortunately,
Even if something at the back of his head screamed that it was impossible, that Sherlock never would do something as stupid as that, the pupils as well as the other symptoms told a different story.
Despite his slight frame, Sherlock was considerably taller which made it more difficult for John to carry him. Added with the difficulty of a body gone limp, he wasn’t going to make it all the way to a waiting helicopter, but still he wasn’t prepared to let go.
“Calm down, Dr Watson. You’ll be filled in as soon as we reach the house. He was breathing when I left and even if the situation is looking severe, Mr Holmes preferred it if you, as his brother’s personal physician, was the one to come and tend to the situation. Calling for an ambulance would be more like a last resort. None of them are particularly fond of hospitals.”
Even more damning was the realisation that he had allowed it to happen by omitting to do the physical exams properly, by allowing himself to get distracted by a master manipulator who had played him like a fiddle by presenting the most alluring option available to keep his focus elsewhere.
Then the hand moved upwards once again, this time stopping by his mouth, fingers prying his lips apart before the middle finger was inserted into his mouth.
“No, I know you,” he said quietly before he turned his eyes back up to look at John. “You’re a proud man by nature and you hate being lied to, so naturally you resent the fact that you were so easily fooled by me. You shouldn’t be of course; anyone could have fallen for it.”
To him, this was more like a game than a matter of national importance. If playing too hazardously, who knew what  consequences there could be?
He had been instructed to make the particular demand of a personal signature on the delivery, pressing the point of its importance and urgency to force Magnussen to leave the room and give Sherlock enough time to free himself and get out. Accustomed as he was, since childhood, in the practice of getting out of seemingly tricky situations, he had no trouble at all with liberating himself from a bond of his own making, so as soon as the door had closed behind Magnussen’s back, he got to work and once released, he fell effortlessly to the floor, landing on his feet.
Sherlock was completely fixated, his finger tips starting to wander through John’s soggy hair a bit more.
“I thought I was over having to open these damned things…” he tried grabbing the handle but it wouldn’t budge. “I see. So I’m trapped haunting the flat.”
“John?” John didn’t realize Sherlock had walked up behind him. “We should go.” His voice was uncharacteristically quiet.
“Well someone should’a warned me he’s got no alcohol tolerance. He’s been talkin’ bout’ you all night by the way. And he never did explain why you got those.” He made a hand gesture referring to Sherlock’s cat ears.
Mycroft gave him a quizzical look, eyes still inhumanly black. “Its not the other tentacle creature in the room.” He deadpanned.
“I never know what on earth you’re going on about, so just eat up and we can talk about whatever new case you have.”
“It’s a triple homicide John! I can’t just pass that up. Besides, look, you can’t even see the tail!”
As Sherlock placed him on Lestrade's desk he felt eyes all over himself. "Greg? Not you too…." His head hung low. "You already saw me yesterday, there is really no need to stair."
Sherlock beamed and poured the majority of the contents of a beaker into a mug and handed it to John. “I’m really glad you asked actually. About a month ago I received a letter from the Baskerville testing facility asking me to help them with a compound they have been working on but couldn’t get quite right. I’ve near perfected it, but still need to test it.”
Lestrade opened the door, not sure if he should wander in or not. He certainly didn’t want to be on the politician’s bad side. “Myc?” He called out again from the door step. The house was rather dark, it seemed as though there wasn’t a single light on.
Sherlock's smile fell, "I'd take very good care of you and you could still help me on cases. Sure typing your blog might become a bit difficult but…"
John swallowed hard. The last thing he wanted was to start hyperventilating before he had even reached safety.
John blushed, but the detective noticed yet again he gave no protest to this new step past their regular comfort zone.
“Not when you use multiple nicotine patches at once.” John wanted to sound mad, he really did. But it was hard when he was relieved that Sherlock was actually talking to him now.
“Now then. This shouldn’t be too hard, we just need to wake Molly up and she’ll figure out what to do.” Sherlock looked around for what could indicate a bedroom door.
John looked up from his computer, his eyes wandering amongst the different lights as they returned to normal.
Sherlock brought a finger up to his mouth to make the ‘shushing’ silence gesture, then pointed to his breast pocket.
“Because I’m Sherlock Holmes and the best detective that has ever lived. Are you really going to question my authority on deductions?” Both men looked at each other stone faced until they both burst into laughter.
“I’m not going to leave John, I’m right here, I’m not going anywhere.” Sherlock tried pulling him close but John pushed him away. “You said this was a dream, so you’re not real, you’re just lying to me.” John’s tone was infuriated again.
Lestrade frowned and pointedly closed the donut box. “I am Not binge eating.” He cleared his throat a bit, “Besides, I would worry about anyone who turns into a hermit and disappears during storms.”
Lestrade’s eyed darted around, “Where’s Sherlock? They said he called it in?” He didn’t notice John’s hand seemingly grasped around nothing not the soft sound of footsteps climbing into the ambulance after the gurney. He tried calling Sherlock mobile to no avail.
Sherlock turned to face John, hadn’t they just gotten away from that dream? He took in his new surroundings, it made sense why the sky was so clear now, no buildings blocking their vision, they were on a roof.
“And what was I suppose to do? Climb up a building and wave in one of your cameras? Oh, also I will need you to find someone to take over my research and work on something to return us to our previous states if it’s not too much to ask, also I need you to dry-clean that.” He gestured towards his coat now sitting on an empty table.
John repeated the gist of what Sherlock had told him. Lestrade nodded, seeming to approve of what he was being told.
Greg was still not completely sure what exactly happened to John that he ended up like that, but he knew it was entirely Sherlock's doing from the beginning.
John couldn’t sleep, he raided for a few hours with Sherlock in game, then laid in bed staring at his ceiling for a couple hours more. It was useless; sleep just wasn’t coming to him. At 3am John couldn’t take it anymore and sat back down at his computer and started typing in porn sights.
He started sneaking out late at night. Lestrade had watched him on multiple occasions taking bags from Tescos and sporadically shopping. He never did see what exactly was in the bags, it hadn’t seemed important so long as it wasn’t drugs or something to kill himself with.
“Really John, do you have that low of an opinion of me? I am offended. Besides, you climbed into bed with me last night, not the other way around.” He continued stealing bites off John’s plate as the blogger tried his best not to blush.
“Well, I don’t exactly have anything I can wrap it with. I had sort of a cane last night, but that didn’t last too long. It’s not as if I’ve been doing a lot of walking lately anyway.” John sighed.
“Sorry, it’s just- it’s been five years since I was in school last, it’s been a bit hard to adjust.” John unconsciously rubbed his bad arm, he could still feel where the bullet ripped into his shoulder.
John stepped further in. “Could be a hidden panel in here, is that what it is?” He tried carefully tapping on every surface he could.
“No messages,” John flicked his phone screen on and gave it a quick check before plopping it into his pocket. “Good. Rather not talk to anyone just now.” No one living at least. He headed towards the door. Deciding a bit of fresh air would do him some good.
John felt an uneasiness about the situation, wanting to be out of there as soon as possible. Another boy rounded him from the side. “Got any cab fare to spare?”
And here, take this” Lestrade leaned back inside the car for a moment to grab Sherlock’s coat and handed it to Molly, “See if you can find anything interesting on this.”
He pushed John aside, not watching where he was going and nearly walking into Sherlock's chair. "Filled my place with a cripple? Serves you right for forcing me out."
John grabbed his jacket while shaking his head knowing Sherlock would never change. His mad flatmate was already in a cab waiting for him by the time he got downstairs.
‘You’re getting paranoid now. Time to head back home.’ John started clearing up some papers on his desk before deciding to leave early. He just needed a bit more time was all.
Not by myself, no. I might not be able to come online for a while, sorry.  I’m ordering a new one from my phone, not sure how long shipping will take. –SH
“John! Where the hell are you?” He could hear muffled yells coming from the bedroom and quickly made his way there.
Molly was visibly flustered by the strange way Sherlock was acting, he was always strange of course so she tried to brush it off. Then it hit her. Sherlock looked as if he was sitting at the table doing nothing. He didn't have his eyes closed with a strained expression, so he wasn't thinking deeply about anything, but whenever he wasn't thinking he was certainly always busy.
He shook his head no. It was strange, certainly not something he had felt before. Sherlock flexed his hands, they felt normal at least.
“The floors smelled like they had just been bleached, but this woman was wearing relatively nicer clothing at the time, and her hands neither seemed wrinkled from liquids nor covered in the powder from plastic gloves.”
“If that’s Lestrade asking you to come in for an emergency could you take us with you?” Sherlock tried but failed to get a better look at the phone.
1. How would you guys feel if I had a chapter that John and Sherlock were not in? Should there always be scenes with them or is ok for them to miss a chapter?
“I love you too.” He was almost knocked over by the enormous cupid’s bow lips that softly landed on the top of his head with a kiss.
“Sherlock, door.” John was still amusing himself with the literally hundreds of comments his blog now had from people he didn’t even know congratulating him and claiming they knew this would happen.
John bit his lower lip, it was the first time he had seen Sherlock showing any sort of strong emotion, he knew it was really only a matter of time before that mad genius found out anyway.
“I thought that was witches?” Lestrade was pretty sure there was a movie that mentioned that, which sounded just as absurd.
Lestrade looked like he had just found the killer in a case, “Mycroft was at your flat? Yesterday??”
"John…" Mycroft started but when he saw his little brother come up behind him, shirt undone and hair a mess he stopped, he was second best at deductions to only one, he could easily see every event that had transpired between them and for once, he really didn't want to spoil his brother's or John's moment.
Molly climbed up on top on the bins in the ally, it was just high enough that they only needed to climb a foot of pipe before reaching the roof, where sure enough there was a vent they could just squeeze into. Leaving Molly to contact Mycroft, she had a sneaking suspicion he wouldn’t be too thrilled about this.
Lestrade placed that damned plastic bag inside the boat and swam back to the dock with it. He placed it on the surface before pulling himself up, only then remembering how horrid a feeling it was to wear soaked through clothes.
“I mean, we’re you know.” Judging the expression on his flatmates face he really didn’t know. He cleared his throat
Molly ran to his side, trying to calm him as well. He couldn’t explain it, but John knew he could feel Sherlock around him, trying to calm him. Eventually John caught his breath, most of his tears dried now.
“Oh I’m sure there were other times.” Sherlock leaned his head against John’s chest as John swallowed two aspirins with a large gulp of water.
Sherlock abruptly cut him off finally finding his voice, “It’s not ok John! It’s not natural and you probably think I’m sort of freak now- which I probably am- and… stop looking at me like that!”
"Erm, yes." The scarf surrounded the doctor and smelled heavily of Sherlock's after-shave and smoke. He found it oddly relaxing. "Thank you."
On Thursday a medium sized package was delivered to 221B. It was the first package in a very long time. Lestrade knew John was up to something. That night he followed him as John left with a gym bag in a cab. He was surprised when the cab actually did stop at a gym, he didn’t want to risk going inside though, he knew logically John had likely just decided to start working out.
He’s more like Sherlock then I thought. “I meant more of the romantic assortment.” He chuckled nervously.
Sherlock still hadn’t answered John’s question about what in all he wanted from his blogger. “What time do you see her?”
Sherlock’s hands slowly went up towards his face but stopped. Everything was hazy. He just needed to focus, he told himself. He desperately wanted to tell John to stay where he was, but the words weren’t coming out. His body began sinking lower into the water of its own accord.
Sherlock can’t leave the flat, it was hard enough sneaking in without suspicion. If he just strolls out now he’ll be seen. He regrets dropping his phone and leaving it at Bart’s, one phone call and he knows John will come running. He had to though, if the cell phone had gone missing or turned up as still in use, Moriarty’s men would know.
John’s hand found the doorknob again and grasped it. An electric jolt seemed to go through it and shock him. He let out a little yelp. Sherlock looked down and released the handle as he realized what happened.
“Don’t worry.” Sherlock put a hand on John’s chest to steady him. “I wasn’t planning on leaving you in your clothes. That would be horribly irresponsible. I will make sure you get a proper bath.”
Sherlock lounged in an empty chair as John worked, often deducing what was wrong with patients before John figured it out. It was almost like old times. Perhaps he hadn’t been haunting the flat after all, he was haunting John.
“Well anyway, as I have previously informed you, it looks like John isn’t fit to go out with you at the moment.” The corner of his mouth curled up as the doctor stepped into his palm and sat.
Almost drowning and nearly losing your boyfriend in the process was apparently one of the very rare instances in which Sherlock will call it an early day and go home. He found he couldn’t take his hands off John on the way back. He ignored that his own hair was irritatingly curlier when wet due to the newly processed information that a soaked John Watson was in fact, mesmerizing.
“MMMPH!” Greg tried to bit down on the tentacle again, but the thicker end of it was now forcing his mouth too wide and he couldn’t manage it.
Lestrade attempted to rip his leg from whatever was grasping it, but the appendage only tightened its grip and yanked him back.
Sherlock stopped rubbing himself and looked at John with his wide eyes, “You’re still getting me a plant thought right? You said-“
“Ok, seriously, what the hell? You’ve been under water for five minutes and you’re not dead. Are you…” He felt like this was going to be the stupidest thing he ever said. “Are you a mermaid?”
John smiled. He wasn’t sure how much of his plan the detective had worked out yet, but knowing he was slightly more at ease lightened his step a bit. He was a soldier damn it, and he sure as hell wasn’t going to die without a fight.
“Glaringly obvious they’ve been in love since the met maybe…” Harry muttered under her breath, earning her a strong slap across the face.
“He’s tired himself out I’m afraid, I thought it best I stayed and made sure he was alright for a bit.” She gestured her teacup over to where Sherlock lay on a cluster of pillows piled on the floor with a mostly empty saucer of milk next to him. John noticed the tail and ears were still very much intact as well.
Woops, sorry about that! Just meant it in good fun, John will be back to his regular self right?- GL
“But now you’re stuck like this! Stuck like me. And no one is nearly as smart as you to come up with a way back.”
“Wind…” John attempted to explain. “I mean, it was just a stack of books, it was probably waiting to fall over at any second.”
At that moment the large metal door leading into the room had opened. Sherlock instinctively dropped the phone and cupped his hand over John to hide him.
I'm glad you guys are liking my story, I'm gonna feel so bad when I finally post it all and it takes longer to get chapters out :[
“It would be useful to both of us if Lestrade knew. I would like to still solve cases- I know you appreciate me ‘saving people’ and it would allow you to have someone else in the know.”
Lestrade thoroughly enjoyed the early morning Tuesday morning crime scene after John clearly had no sleep the night before and forgot he had been wearing false eyelashes. Sherlock pretended not to notice simply because he was finding ‘typical’ gender roles and fashion to be increasingly tedious and couldn’t for the life of him understand what the big deal was. If John wanted to wear it the night before then why wouldn’t he want to wear it the next day?
Maria let out an exasperated sigh. “John just- just tell me when you’re, erm, better. Or if you need anything.” She waited for a moment expecting him to answer her, but he didn’t.
“Should I hang up now?” Sherlock said with a blank expression. Frustrated yells came from the other end of the phone then the call ended. “Ah, never mind.”
Greg ran a hand through his hair, which seemed greyer then ever. “Maybe I’m just fooling myself. But sometimes… its as if he does feel the same? I don’t know what’s going on. After that first awkward time he turned me down, he kept asking me to ‘discuss’ things with him and taking me out to eat. He always paid. But after a while, his excuses seemed pretty flimsy.” He chuckled fondly. “He didn’t even give a reason for the last few times we went out. I even joked that it was a date once and he never corrected me.”
“You didn’t enjoy it?” Sherlock was perplexed. John always enjoyed his dates so long as nothing went wrong. “So something did go wrong.” He tried to think of what it could have been. “An ex showed up?”
“So either our attacker is good at covering their trails or we have a caller who needs some checking up on.” Weather crazy or lying to waste police time.
John would just have to do it himself. He pressed the lip of the glass to Sherlock’s lips and tilted it up for him. Sherlock drank it down as fast as possible, chugging every last drop of it. But it wasn’t nearly enough.
Lestrade thought. “You two are not playing some weird power trip BDSM games where I work now are you?”
“Right, of course…” John went to get his jumper and paused again. Maybe he could just tell him he wasn’t up to it. That something had come up at work or he was getting a bit sick and shouldn’t be out in this weather. No, that wouldn’t work at all. Sherlock would of course see right through any lie he came up with and he really didn’t want Sherlock prodding about as to why he didn’t want to go. That brilliant git had to make everything so difficult.
“What if…. Oh! John, you can do an experiment to me if you like.” He sat back up. “Would that make it fair again?”
“I’m already wearing them and the strap is bloody awful to undo.” Sherlock licked his lips as he did the final touches to John’s make up and attire. “There! Now, come out so I can see you better.” He grabbed John’s hand and led him back into the main room where he badly pretended he was not gushing over his own handiwork.
“Uhh, yea, I just um… I have a bit of a favor or rather question to ask.” John blushed a bit even though no one could see him. He was going to sound absolutely ridiculous.
“Of course not. Wouldn’t you and Mycroft be the first to know if I was?” the words had some venom behind them.
Harry was still suspicious the lanky man was helping her brother hide from her, but she couldn't help but smile at this. "He is my
John set the toy down and started by simply stroking himself, he knew it might take some encouragement to build up to the task at hand. He removed the cap to the lube and slicked up his fingers, slowly inserting one inside himself with a small wince. He sat on his knees, legs spread for a better angle as he slowly started fucking himself. One hand played with his balls lightly as he slowly stretched himself till he thought he could push the toy in without much pain.
"They have nothing in common other then both being female. This one here was a college student, the other one a real estate agent."
“John, you have been very disconnected from everyone other then Sherlock. Perhaps you should try harder at dating again?”
Sherlock had been avoiding fully looking at John until now, he knew his tiny flatmate would be enraged if he stared at him while he was in the buff. But now he crouched down with his face level to the bed.
Sherlock hadn’t expected John to take out the theraphosa blondi, he should have been outmatched in strength and speed by a hundred times. What he hadn’t counted on was that despite the impressive intelligence of the creature, John outsmarted it. He felt an odd sense of joy when he realized this, but he wasn’t so optimistic about the following spiders.
Now that wasn’t right. That wasn’t right at all. Lestrade shadowed that man everywhere he went since St. Barts. He knew there was no conceivable way John was dating someone. “You, uh, meet her yet?”
“Molly! I love it!” he lifted the posh Lois Vuitton Shawl out of its box. “This is really too much.”
John started snickering behind Sherlock’s back until the detective absent minded wondered out and down the hall. “Lock? Where are you going?” He followed him until they reached the green house where Sherlock became fixated on a small plant.
John had decided he really couldn’t sleep in Sherlock’s bed again. It was simply wrong on too many levels. In the back of his mind he knew he should have the room cleared out along with most of Sherlock’s things, but he wouldn’t let himself think of that. It had a finality that didn’t sit right with him. John kept stealing glances of Sherlock’s room as he watched tv, the hour getting later as he continued to remind himself not to sleep in there.
“Somebody get this damn cat out of here. Who the hell cleared this room anyway?” Lestrade grabbed the feline and shoved it in Donovan’s arms. “Go take that thing somewhere else.”
"Greater connection?" Harry was confused and shot John a glance. John knew enough to trust Sherlock's deduction though.
Sherlock shifted his weight were he stood. “I didn’t get my growth spurt until I was almost out of highschool.”
He hesitantly hovered one hand over Sherlock’s head before dropping it to pet his dark hair, the detective pushed into the pet, soft cat ears in John’s hand. “I hate how good this feels.”
“Ah, so this happened naturally then?” he plopped the end of his umbrella on top of Sherlock’s head, making the detective’s face go red.
She gave her best modest smile, “John, it’s so good to see you, I was worried that… I mean, thanks for dropping by. Is there anything I can do for you?”
He could feel his face reddening but couldn’t stop it. “You’re putting me on…” his hands felt frozen, unable to close the tab on the offending webpage.
"Oh hush, they both promised to help keep this a secret, and you know that people will be asking me where you've been." Sherlock lifted the tiny doctor out of his pocket.
"Greg already knows, so you might as well take me out so I can breath." A muffled voice from Sherlock's pocket called out.
There were other times. Not that he had ever told anyone, not even Mycroft. He had tried being intimate with a boy at Uni before. It didn’t end well. They had both been high at the time, which they later blamed for being the reason why it went wrong. They boy had pushed Sherlock onto the bed and kissed him deeply. It was clear what he wanted and Sherlock didn’t mind. But as his trousers were pulled off, something inexplicable had happened. An almost ripping sensation at Sherlock’s sides. Two massive black- Things- had grabbed the other boy. He screamed and begged to be released. The masses didn’t want to let him go but finally relented after a few moments of the boy screaming. When he was, he grabbed his shirt and ran out the dormitory door at full speed.
John was completely speechless as Sherlock walked off to report his findings on the case to Lestrade.
There was a moment of silence before Sherlock continued. “I was in a coma for a week. Mycroft was there when I woke up, he had fallen asleep waiting for me. I… I didn’t know what was wrong with me at first, why my legs didn’t work. The feeling in them came back a few months later, possibly because of Lestrade… or so he loves reminding me.”
Greg breathed heavily, “Its mhmmmm, ok. I do need it out though.” Why was flustered post sex Mycroft so damn cute? “Just, really slowly, ok?” He carefully got onto his back in hoped it would make this easier. But instead all it did was display Mycroft’s hard work of filling him to the absolute brim.
They circled the flat again, but to no avail. Oddly, they didn’t locate the rope either. Lestrade had a bad feeling starting to sink in.
Sherlock’s head felt clouded again as he went to his room. He pulled on a shirt left over a chair and grabbed a pair of trousers.
Sherlock sighed and crouched down by the cage, biscuit in hand. “Do you feel any different at all? Eyesight? Hearing? Smell? Anything?” he had a look of disappointment.
“All the more reason. It’s not like anyone would know anyway. Besides, you could solve the case by yourself- what do you say to that?”
John pried at the floor with his hands; it wasn’t thin enough there. He would have to find a room on the corner of the house were it would be more likely to be flawed and easier to rip apart.
Molly furrowed her brow while watching John in an apparent daze wander about the kitchen with a strange sort of consistency. “What did people online suggest?”
Sherlock looked down at himself. He certainly didn’t see any additional limbs. Perhaps it wouldn’t happen to him? Though, he hadn’t checked everywhere just yet. He went to remove his pajama bottoms when John flushed and turned away.
“And you always get mad? Oh well, let’s see. You enjoyed the food, nothing went horribly wrong, but…”
“Get the bloody hell out of my way!” His voice was louder then he had realized, even Lestrade turned to see what had happened. “He- We, show up and solve your damn crimes for you and all you can think of doing with that miniscule brain of yours is insult him and make assumptions about me. So how about instead of that and screwing Anderson you go do your damn job. Now kindly get out of my way!” The vein on John’s forehead was very prominate. He wasn’t sure what had come over him but he was done with playing games with people he never gave a second thought about.
Sherlock really didn’t want to over step his bounds, but John was essentially asking for it. After all, if he could move John’s hands while inside them, why not something else? He clenched his fists and stepped forward, into John.
John flushed a bright red, he knew he would have to think of a way of explaining all of this. “Been looking for those…”
John was pretty nervous, he didn’t want to scare Greg off or make him think he was a loony. “Its not me… its-”
“Wha-” Greg wrapped his arms firmly around him. “I wouldn’t- I couldn’t-” Well, he was pretty sure he literally couldn’t have succeeded at least.
“Prefer it? What are you talking about? You can’t even go out without a hat and coat on, why would you want that?”
John’s eyes widened and felt as though his heart had plummeted. No wonder Sherlock didn’t want to tell him about this he thought. He took Sherlock’s hand in his own and held it for a moment, “He’s nothing but a bastard who never deserved to be in your life.”
“Listen, what on earth you could see in Mycroft of all people, is beyond me. But you both deserve to be happy. Maybe its not,” he tried to think of a good way to word it, “Like other relationships. But maybe he just needs a push? He’s the one that’s been asking you to go places after all. He must see something in you.”
“Goodbye then. John?” She turned before walking out the door. She huffed, clearly agitated by the lack of response and left.
He had a point. “Fine, come on, lets go. I’m sorry, but there was no word on who the body was or what even happened. I don’t know if your friend is ok or not.” The two quickly went out side to hail cab.
John shook his head, “No, he came by today to ask us to watch his security tape and stop by the flat when we could. Strange case…”
“He doesn’t mean it like that!” it was too late, she left. “Damn it Sherlock! I don’t even want to know what she thinks now!”
A second knock came from the door. John froze, not sure if he had missed his only chance of escape. No one answered the door and the far away muffled voice of Moriarty stopped, likely listening to the knock and debating what to do.
Soon Greg was coming as well, spilling onto the bed. He wasn’t sure if he had strength left anywhere in his body. Mycroft held him close, still spilling into him after Greg had finished. His tentacles tightened all around his mate as he pumped him full.
“I’m not haunting the flat, I think I’m… don’t be afraid, but I think I’m haunting you.” Sherlock was a bit nervous by how John would react to that.
“Of course not.” Sherlock smiled and leaned down, placing one arm under John’s legs and the other on his back.
“And he’s my friend.” He spat back putting his other hand around the flattened one protectively. “I can’t possibly trust you with him. What if you dropped him?” his words were filled with venom.
All Harry could think of was how her idiotic brother better be right about the supposed genius of his flatmate.
The moment before John was thinking how silly this was but he soon found himself falling forward, if Sherlock hadn’t quickly dropped and held him up by the shoulder’s he knew he would have fallen face first into the ground.
He sucked in a deep breath, his eyes downcast towards the floor as he faced the chair. John’s head slowly raised, not sure what he had expected to see. It was a simple plastic chair; everyone’s office had at least one. He opened his mouth for a moment as if to speak before shaking his head.
A quiet murmuring came from the corning of the room at that, making Sherlock sit up fully. But it was only John, still fully dressed despite the hour and sleeping in a chair. Sherlock let out a breath of air. John must have fallen asleep watching him.
Lestrade quickly looked away, face feeling hot from Sherlock’s accusation. “John- you look… really good actually. Very good.” ‘is this what he’s been up to this whole time?’ Lestrade started feeling extremely apologetic for invading John’s privacy now.
But now that he was closer to the closet, he could feel it. There was something coming off the rope. It had looked ordinary enough at first, but it was different. He reached out to touch it and immediately pulled back. It was as though he had just been scolded by something exceptionally hot. He looked down at his hand, but there was no marking. Sherlock reminded himself that his form was really some sort of illusion he simply controlled, of course there would be no physical mark.
Sherlock’s eyes went wide “What!? Why are you not out looking for him? God… one of Moriarty’s men? He could be dead… he could have been tortured… This is my fault…”
The enormous cat face came down to sniff the squirming detective and sniffed him. Sherlock let out a not too manly scream before the rough tongue licked his hair.
Maria smiled and walked out of John and Sherlock’s view as the other woman sat back in a simple chair, admiring the room and paying little attention to the woman that had brought here there.
“Holy Shit!” An older teen had started down the aisle and now came over quickly, “He break his arm?”
Mycroft held him close, never wanting to let go again. It was strange being mostly clothed still as he held a very naked Greg. Who had packed on quite a lot in the midsection at that. Mycroft subtly ran his hand over the little mound.
“Not that I know of.” Sherlock had no idea this was going to happen, his brother had certainly never warned him about it. “Maybe.”
There was no response as John started eating from Sherlock’s hand again as if it were perfectly normal. “Spine feel funny.” This time when the pastry was gone John began licking Sherlock’s hand.
“John?” There was of course no answer. “JOHN?!” Sherlock tried yelling at the top of his lungs to no avail.
“Don’t be so dramatic. I told you, it will wear off.” Sherlock wrapped his slender fingers around John’s calf and began massaging the muscle.
Sherlock tried backing his chair up away from Mycroft again, but the older brother grabbed it quickly.
John shut his eyes, desperately wanting to believe Sherlock that everything would be fine, but something in the back of his mind told him things would be worse if this was just a dream. That somehow this was better then waking up. He closed his eyes, thinking hard of being away from Moriarty. A flash of light momentarily blocked Sherlock’s field of vision. The first thing he noticed after he could see again was that it was morning with the sun just coming out over an open sky. That was a good sign at least.
"Damn, what does that woman want?" He reluctantly opened the door again. "I have already told you, John is-"
Not much really. But five feet and an inch, well, I always thought he was on the short side, but he seems a tad bit shorter now.- MH
Sherlock smirked, “That’s what you said two months ago when you woke up with some strange woman in your bed.” He tossed a bottle of aspirin on the bed and returned a moment later with a glass of water, slipping back under the sheets.
Come to Parker Street 542 as soon as possible, homicide, possibly another of those serial killings. SD
John stared at the screen in disbelief, his character dazed and unable to move, not that he was paying any attention to that.
“John, you are a doctor. You work in a hospital. It’s your flat mate that works for Scotland Yard. “
“I know you might not be all there,” He took a deep breath to steady himself. It was just Sherlock, but with those dreams he had been having, it seemed anything with water made him jumpy.
Moriarty sat dumbstruck in the pool of clothing looking up at the giant phone screen. Sebastian always answered, it made no difference if he was having one of his ridiculous ‘moments’ or not.
Sherlock blinked, “I see…” He put the images into a folder and brought out a second folder. “Let’s try something different then.” He pulled out the first image and showed it to John.
“Oh god no, please don’t tell me I called you that last night.” John tore himself away from his flatmate and sat up to one of the worst migraines in his life. “Ah great, hangover.”
John nervously licked his lips. “I’ll be right back.” Maybe he could do it quickly enough that Greg wouldn’t notice.
Mycroft strolled down the Scotland Yard hallway to Lestrade’s office, umbrella hanging from his arm as he carried a coffee meant for the DI. He knew it was just an excuse to see him now, but he had little choice. It wasn’t as if their social circles crossed very often. His eyes narrowed as he saw the sleek figure of a woman he had hoped to never see again. At first he thought he might be able to pass by her without a word, but Grace stepped in front of him forcing him to confront her.
Sherlock rested his palm on the table, John stepped off and stood towards the edge. “Not seeing her again then?” he leaned down trying to make his eyes parallel with John’s body.
Greg’s grip loosened, his hands falling back against the bed in an overly relaxed fashion as his whole body felt numbingly weak. Mycroft cupped his face in his hands, watching him drink the fluid down with great satisfaction. Greg was faintly aware that the pounding in his head from where he hit it earlier had died down to nothing.
Sherlock didn’t have time for this. John was panicking and- no? John had stopped? The detective tried the handle, but it barely moved. “Shit.”
Sherlock grinned, it was a very complicated murder and he would be able to show off to John. “Oh how dull, really Lestrade, Anderson should be able to solve this one for you!”
“Ah, he was a florist. The taller man here recently bought some flowers, the flouriest killed them.”
The bar where new text showed up blinked for a while, indicating Sherlock was typing, then disappeared. John blinked,
“Bloody hell, he has to come over here first thing in the morning dressed to the nine’s of course.” Lestrade had only brought a few things to the flat, not sure how long he would be staying there. He dressed quickly and unplugged his phone from it’s charger noting he had a text.
‘And what do you have in mind? I thought you believed yourself and I to be ‘dangerous’ to be around. Are we to battle to the death? Could be amusing.’ –SH
Sherlock breathed out nervously. “I like having you all to myself John.” He still didn’t make eye contact. “Always knowing where you are… you depending on me for so much. I know that’s selfish.
John left to make breakfast for them both, whether Sherlock refused to eat it or not. Sherlock watched him from his thinking position on the couch, cataloging his every movement.
John was rather red himself. He seriously hoped he was mistaken, but that moan was down right sexual and he found himself shifting awkwardly from their close approximation. “I didn’t realize- I wasn’t trying to-”
Sherlock looked back at the dollhouse, it was obviously a custom job. Rooms alternated between being a girlish pink painted wood filled with doll size furniture viewable through glassed windows and completely see-through rooms made of plexiglass. John stood in one of the clear rooms contained inside a small plexiglass box that had a door mechanism that’s hadn’t been released yet.
“I mean it John. Even if you want me to stay over, here or at the flat, anywhere really, it’s all fine.”
“How am I suppose to prove it? There’s nothing useful in this place.” Sherlock grumbled, wishing he could just shoot a smiley face in the wall. For a moment he considered tapping out in morse code, but after the third tap he realized he had lost too much energy and could no longer be heard.
“Freak in his signature hat eh? Must be hiding something, havin’ a bad hair day?” Sally teased as the pair passed her.
It was these moments that he really hated being forced to go to therapy for psychological evaluation.
"That was hardly my fault, those chemicals really shouldn't have reacted that way, I think Ms. Hudson might have switched the labels-"
“We should really try to find our way back before it gets later.” His voice was uncharacteristically nervous.
There was a pause and John found he was uncharacteristically smiling at the type on the computer screen.
“I don’t pretend!” he said a bit too loud but Sherlock and his usual social awkwardness didn’t catch it. “I do get
This chapter has inches in it, the original story was written in inches instead of the metric system, I'm trying to think of a way to edit the wording of this chapter so it still makes sense. Sorry.
“Yes, now don’t push it. If they weren’t trying to scare her then maybe they are trying to scare someone that knows her and would be affected by her potential death or that someone is threatening to kill her.”
Sherlock had been pacing the room, searching for anything. But there wasn’t even as much as a loose strand of hair on the carpet. Which actually seemed a bit odd. The ground wasn’t exactly clean, but there wasn’t so much as an eyelash lying around? Someone cleaned this room up thoroughly and then locked it off. “This was staged. Someone was meant to see this. But why?” He looked at John. He really needed him right now. He had no idea how much his praise helped Sherlock think. Sherlock needed a look inside the closet. But when he tried, it wouldn’t budge. He couldn’t even step through it like he could with the door at home. Perhaps his haunting parameter was just out of reach of it. Maybe if he got John a bit closer to the door, even better, if he could get John to open it somehow.
“I’m sorry, sorry. That didn’t really come out right.” He couldn’t help but notice that Sherlock seemed nearly as surprised as he did. So he didn’t know this was going to happen then? “Do you have any idea why you might have… er-“
That was simple enough, John could just nod in agreement and pretend it was something he had actually considered and would do. “Alright.”
“I doubt that. He’ll show up again if he’s able to, but only on his own accord. It would take a rather clever individual to get the upper hand on him, so there wont be much to anything to go on.”
“You’re not going out are you?” John hurried to step ahead, blocking Sherlock from the door of the flat. “There’s a storm out, if you don’t remember! Besides, you’re in no state to-”
“John- it’s really not important.” His voice sounded off even to him. Now John had to know what those signs said.
Sherlock lay horizontally across the foot of John’s bed in his blue bathrobe with his tail sticking out. “ ‘M comfy.”
It was odd, in fact. It seemed that even back at 221b he had more effect on the world around him. After all, he had turned that tv on and broken a mug just that morning. It had taken a great deal of effort to build up to that. But now he couldn’t even open a closet door or properly wrinkle up a bed sheet. Something had changed.
He recalled the way Sherlock had clamed up when John mentioned his therapist, the small muttering of ‘sounds like mine’ when he told him how Ella said he need to get out more.
John sat in a confused stupor in his wingback, staring across at the empty leather chair that was Sherlock’s. It was hard to push the vague momentary image from the morgue out of his mind. He was just stressed, it was still so soon after Sherlock had… after his accident. John had to remind himself that Sherlock didn’t mean for this to happen.
“What’s wrong? ARGH! Do you even know what people ask me about on my blog? The whole city seems to think we’re a couple you know.”
Sherlock closed his eyes as tight as he possibly could to keep from spinning. He let out another dry cough, alerting John to what was wrong.
“You haven’t been taking your pills have you? They really do help with the nightmares John, I think you should really consider it.”
Daniel Rogers was rather shaken up that the police had come by. He had been out at the time of the initial report and came back to the place surrounded by police cars. It didn’t exactly help him settle his nerves which had already been on edge.
John could feel his face heating up but he refused to look away, “Very funny.” He tried to use the most sarcastic tone he could muster.
“Ah, you’re here. It’s uh, not exactly the case on my mind right now.” He didn’t make eye contact with John at that and bent down to rifle through a few case files before pulling out three. “Here you are.”
Sherlock's voice booming voice easily penetrated through the wood but John's returned calls seemed to go unnoticed. He cursed his now miniature vocal chords knowing his only way out would be finding one himself.
John pushed the envelope out, landing close to Sherlock who started opening it, and he climbed down out of the pocket to join him. Sherlock was already half dressed when he got there.
Sherlock brought his head up for a moment to see what John had brought, showing him a flash of those aquatic eyes, John thought his heart could melt from the sight of them.
The moment he was able to leave, John pulled out his cell phone, it blinked with the new message awaiting him.
Greg attempted to hide the violin case as much as he could as he lifted the other bags at the same time.
“I was.” he lied and grabbed a small dish towel so John could dry off. “Or I could just leave you in there and you can figure out how to get out on your own. Choice is yours.”
"That git." John untangled himself from the taller man's scarf and stood directly in front of his ear. "SHERLOCK!" It wasn't the best of plans.
“Sounds like whatever this is, its connected to your case.” They got to the room the attack was reported in. Nothing seemed out of place. Just a simple room, nothing but a bed with a night stand and a dresser in it. “Well, I don’t see a body.”
Even stranger, Lestrade let him, looking very nervous and anxious that the pipe be torn to shreds. The two only paused in their bizarre efforts to look at a dead rat of all things.
The tremor's in Sherlock's legs increased, "John I- I'm-… " his words turned into an unintelligible whimper and John knew he was the only one that could do this to that mad genius. John loved how inexperienced Sherlock was, loved those beautiful sounds meant for him, his uncontrolled vigor. He came quicker then most, John loved that too, not letting go until he was sure his love was sated. John cleaned up the last remains with his tongue, ending in another kiss on Sherlock's tip, then pulled himself up to meet his face.
“I’m here now John.” Sherlock reached his hand out to John’s shoulder and went straight through him.
Sherlock didn’t respond but merely looked away, clearly sulking. What was he even suppose to say to John?
He was asleep before he could catch himself again, dreaming things that would make him blush if he were aware of it.
“I can assure you that’s not the problem,” John poured two cups, feeling sorry for the man before guiding him back to the front room.
John turned to see his savior. A tall man clad in black stood behind him, glock still raised out in defense.
He stretched his left arm forward, palm up to adjust the pegs of his violin. His right hand pantomimed holding a bow. Sherlock’s eyes closed for a moment as he imaged that first note and then another.
Molly beamed, “I noticed you looking at that corpse last week, the one with Vuitton boots. You’ve really been a great help.”
"Except for John that is." A small smirk found it's way to his lips before his eyes began darting about again. "That means he must have made it at least this far and he wasn't in the rest of the pipe. He should have known where he was once he exited the pipe so it shouldn't have been too hard to make it back to the front of the flat."
“Probably not… help set this up?” John cleared off the coffee table and opened the ouija board box up. “Glows in the dark? That’s incredibly corny… although we’ll still be able to see it if the lights go out again.” The lamp from earlier had luckily started working again before it got too dark outside.
John clicked on a video keeping his comp on silent and watched as he switched from it to the skype window.
“I heard you talking before you answered the door, so unless you are crazy and talking to yourself- which I wouldn’t put past you- I demand to see John now.”
John’s voice was small and slightly cracked, “So someone else cleaned the floor? What would be the point of that if the killer left the body there?”
“He’s… concerned about me.” Sherlock was looking out the window, gauging how much rain they were getting.
CW inflation kink, and obviously some good old fashioned tentacle fucking but I dont need to tell you guys that.
Greg huffed and closed his donut box. “I’m just gonna go see him. It will be fine.” He ran a hand over his midsection. “And stop binge eating junk…” Mycroft was always so hard on himself and trying to diet, and here he was keeping a whole donut shop in business.
Sherlock sighed. Then there was no helping it. He tossed the soaked shirt to the side, it already felt easier to breath in the water.
"I feel as if I'm forgetting about something." The small man thought to himself as he was carried to the kitchen where Sherlock already had a kettle on the stove for tea.
Looking up again, Sherlock seemed like his very life was on the line, “I can’t… tomorrow. It has to be tomorrow at 12. Mycroft will be gone by then and…” his voice trailed off a bit.
"I see." John had picked up a small beaker with a clear blue liquid in it, it seemed harmless enough but if Sherlock was involved it likely wasn't.
Lestrade looked down at his phone, he had a new message from the Yard. Another murder had been committed in a nightclub.
Sherlock can’t contain his smile, John is finally home, he can finally tell him he’s fine. He’s not sure what’s gotten in him, perhaps the lack of human interaction of the past two days, but it somehow seems like the most important thing in the world to tell John as soon as possible that he’s here.
When they arrived, there were a few police cars about, but not nearly as many as a typical homicide would warrant. Lestrade jumped out, all business, John was quick to follow. Donovan was already there, luckily having the squad car with her.
“You’ll come tomorrow right? To the case?” John was no longer touching the planchette, but it slowly made it’s way to the ‘Yes.’
Hours passed and the doctor found himself back in Afghanistan, bullets ripping by him. He was in uniform and brandishing a large rifle. Someone screamed behind him in pain, not a high pitched movie scream, the deep throaty cry of a man injured beyond repair. Corporal Williams to his right fell wordlessly, never to stand again. To his left a dark figure came into vision, the enemy.
Sherlock was clearly uncomfortable with this arrangement and it wasn’t solely because he was forced to wear formal wear and a bow tie according to the dress code of the event. On account of his upbringing as well as the many years spent at respectable boarding schools, Sherlock was not a stranger to wearing the right attire, however reluctantly. But this was something else and Mycroft wasn’t completely sure where his brother’s nervousness stemmed from.
Even if they were alone he knew that staff members moved about the house, silently performing their duties like shadows in the background and getting caught like this, spent and naked on the dining room floor, would be preferable if it could be avoided.
His surveillance on Magnussen had told him nothing out of the ordinary, he had been at the flat at the same time as Sherlock but only for a very brief period of time, and afterward he had headed straight back to the office.  It was all very ambiguous and nothing easily justifying his sense of concern, and yet, he couldn’t shake the feeling of something going on just beyond his own ability to see it.
Sherlock had begun arranging the food on his plate in small heaps according to colour on his plate and didn’t look at his brother when he calmly replied.
He reached out and tore at the button as well as the zipper while yanking his own sweater over his head to get rid of it. He needed his own skin to make contact with what he had in front of him but things were going too slow, he needed to feel that body pressed against his own and he needed it now.
It was only a ruse after all, it wasn’t real, however much it did sting to see Sherlock return Magnussen’s look and the hint of a smile playing at the corners of his lips. Sherlock knew exactly what to do to generate sexual want in others and turn people in front of him weak at the knees, as John could readily attest to himself.
He peeked out into the hall and could see Dr Roylott come charging in his direction now. As he had passed the room where Mycroft was hiding with Sherlock, John saw the door silently open and the figure of the older Holmes brother carrying the younger in his arms, sneak out behind the doctor’s back and head for the stairs.
And, as if sensing Magnussen’s presence in the room, he suddenly opened his eyes, dark feverish hollows inside that gaunt, pale face, the skin glistening from sweat. He actually looked like he was dying.
Mycroft pinched the bridge of his nose and closed his eyes for a second to supress the rising annoyance before he uttered the next words through gritted teeth.
rights should be the reason for signing anything, not Mycroft’s position or the man who was going to marry his brother within four months. John couldn’t care less about their positions and the fact that Mycroft insisted on him signing this on their account rankled him.
Mycroft had at first not been very pleased with John’s insistence to participate in the operation, even in a non-active role,  but he had eventually agreed when Sherlock had proved to be too difficult to handle on his own.
John didn’t reply, not wanting to rise to whatever bait Magnussen was trying to use to get a reaction out of him. He was going to play this out as instructed as far as that was possible.
If there is a tone of begging in his voice he isn’t going to admit it, especially when the man looks at him like he can’t believe he is stuck babysitting the victim’s left-over flatmate. But then his professionalism kicks in nonetheless and he nods, opening up the door to let John in.
It was humiliating to consider how positively smitten he had been, how utterly blind, and whenever that realisation hit him, he wanted to squirm from embarrassment, pound his head against the wall and scream in frustration.
“You’re disappointed.....,” he muttered and scrunched his lips into what looked like a pout and John stared at him incredulously.
His voice sounded like a raspy croak, probably dry from being unused as well as a lack of fluids. His spirit wasn’t broken yet though, even in this state he managed to sound almost haughty, going against the terrible state of his appearance.
He had borrowed a bicycle from a co-worker to get there and discarded the vehicle next to a bush before walking the remaining overgrown path leading up to the cottage, wondering how Sherlock had managed to make his way here without getting noticed. For some reason, using Mycroft’s car did not seem like a good option if he wanted to be discreet and there had been no tire marks on the somewhat muddy ground surrounding the place,
There was a glass of water waiting for him on the nightstand, but he angrily refused the offered gift. It was probably meant as some sort of apology but he was not going to accept it.
