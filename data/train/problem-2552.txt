Dean was gaping in an instant. “Jesus, no! Just ‘cause I’m bi don’t mean I like every guy in a five mile radius.”
The voice - a woman’s voice - began to guide Dean out of the parking lot and onto the road. As he pulled out, he still couldn’t catch sight of Castiel.
So, care to explain why you're sprinting like a maniac, down the hall? At the alleged witching hour?
Dean felt a blush creep across his cheeks. “Oh, shit, sorry. Wouldn’t wanna take a sibling nickname.”
Gavin laughs. "Fuck, man," he gasps. "You do like that fucking freaky kid. Never knew you were so messed up."
After those two seconds passed, Alfred was bounding across the room. "Castiel," he said, features brightening instantly. "How are you? Have you taken care of Elizabeth yet?"
“Actually, he sorta is,” Sam said, handing a small toy to an exuberant Caden. “Hell, I’m probably the only one here who’s heard of him, and I still don’t know what he looks like. All I know is that you used to hate him.”
Turning to look at Dean, Castiel noticed that his eyes were blown wide. “What I’m saying, Dean, is that I love you. It’s not that difficult to comprehend.” The bitter sting in his tone had been unintentional, but was there, nonetheless.
Castiel had moved over a few feet, right into Dean’s personal bubble. Dean was beginning to wonder if he should bring up the concept of boundaries during their next downtime.
Clouds smoked out and puddled overhead, drifting by. Wait, but what the hell was— oh, a gunky mix of grass, clovers, and dirt. Very damp, and
Dean sighed. “No, neither. First of all, I should probably tell you. We don’t know if he’s tellin’ the truth or not.”
“Excuse me,” he mumbled under his breath, quickly pushing his seat back and hopping out. Castiel found himself fleeing in the direction of the foyer.
At this point, Dean had his head in his hands. He decided he had nothing better to do than await the explosion. Or, more realistically, a decade of uncomfortable silence.
They reached what he assumed was the den, and Dean peered inside. Two people occupied the space. The first was a bald, dark-skinned man. His features looked uncommonly sullen, so Dean decided it was fair to assume that the man was Alfred. Against a separate wall, a teenage girl was slouched in a chair. She shared Alfred's deep skin tone, as well as his nose - just not his hair. Bright pink dreadlocks reached to what must have been at least her mid-back. It was also noteworthy that the girl's expression was significantly calmer. Blissful, even.
Dean huffed. “To tell you the truth? I do more than I don’t. Bobby’s already told me: I’m losing it.” As he spoke, Dean could see Castiel’s features visibly brighten.
Dean shrugged to himself and made his way over to the bar, taking a seat. He surveyed his surroundings. To his left sat a woman who looked barely over twenty-one. Dirty blond hair framed her round face. Dean was able to make out dark brown eyes, and a smattering of freckles.
He threw on his jacket before stepping outside. It had started to snow again. He peered to his right, only to discover the Castiel was still there, shoveling snow from his driveway. He hadn’t made much progress.
The priest coughed, redirecting everyone’s attention. “Uh, so, am I still being compensated for this? I sort of need it, for… stuff.”
Castiel shook his head. “I… I couldn’t. That would be intruding. I’m fine, don’t worry about me,” he called back.
"Here, man, I got it," Dean huffs. All the same, Castiel waits to stand up as he watches Dean gather his belongings.
With a short huff, Dean turned back to shut the freezer door. “Whatever, guess it’s good we don’t keep much shit in there, anyway,” he said, crouching down to return to the fridge. “But I’m blaming you if I, like, sprout a third arm in my sleep, or somethin’.”
And, an uncontainable eye-roll from Castiel. “I still don’t know if this is a positive or a negative reaction. ‘Strong’ as in… unpleasant?”
“Anyway,” Dean inserts himself into the conversation. “Just wanted you two to meet. Sam, you go back to studying for Harvard or whatever you were doing.”
“Nothing,” Cas says through a chuckle. “It’s just… it’s just that you almost seem to believe that I still don’t understand how much you love me. Or that I could ever love you back to an equal degree.”
Dean and Castiel wound up in the family room. It looked lived in, cozy even. Dean felt a tug in his chest. He wasn’t going to be “cozy” for a long time, as far as he knew. Just because he was a tough as hell hunter now didn’t mean he couldn’t get sentimental.
“And, last night, I’m pretty sure my entire abdomen was glowing blue. Like, as if there was a fluorescent light bulb shoved up into my ribs. Then, I may or may not have fallen unconscious, until this morning.
“Hey!” Dean said, pointing a finger at the other boy. “There isn’t anything funny about this. Chocolate is superior, okay?”
screamed ‘something sneaky is underfoot.’ “Let’s head up to my quarters, then. I can’t wait for you to be properly acquainted, Gabe.”
Feeling as if the first layer of haze had finally cleared from Castiel’s awareness, he gave a stiff nod. But he ignored the request. He had several questions of his own, after all. “Who are you?”
The recipient shook his head. “I fucked up,” Dean said again. “Of course I love you. I thought that was a given, man.”
“Uh, yeah. Lucifer?” He can’t help but hold some bitterness in his voice. Castiel had talked once about his brother, and the sadness in Cas’s voice still rung in his ears. And anyway, who the hell names their kid Lucifer and expects him to be an obedient child?
“Um,” Dean started, letting out a nervous laugh. “This couch isn’t very comfortable. Mind if we move this to a bedroom? Mine, maybe?” He cocked an eyebrow.
To Dean’s surprise, Bobby’s gaze immediately returned to his book. “I have no idea what you’re talking about,” he muttered.
“I mean, if that’s okay with you,” Dean said, chuckling gently. His face was flushed. “Y’know, just… tryin’ it out. Here-”
Castiel shook his head. “Actually, I wouldn’t know, as I have never had a mother. But I still think that you should call her.”
COMPOSURE GONE at a moment's notice, Dean swipes the unopened beer. He STANDS, takes a swig, reaches for the whiskey bottle, and--
Dean climbs off of Castiel, allowing them to once more sit side by side. “Dude, honestly, I don’t care. If a month and a half is all we need, then it’s all we need. All that I know is a love you, Cas. Jesus, I fuckin’ love you,” Dean says, ending with a gentle laugh.
on the front door, rather than busting its hinges or smashing a nearby window. It was certainly an alpha’s knock, to be fair, but the subtle haughtiness was far less off-putting.
It didn’t dawn on him until dinner, the day before the holiday. This wasn’t as much a problem as it was an opportunity. The chance to let his feelings for Dean loose, to be openly affectionate without repercussion. No one would question him. Of course, he understood that he couldn’t take things too far; the last thing he wanted to do was make Dean uncomfortable. Castiel had to be subtle. All the same, he could be open for the first time in his life.
what was on his mind, which was quite typical. “The guy probably hoped he’d be able to take credit for the rescue, ‘til he got a look at that gnarly mating bite, ‘course. Seeing as it’s too late for
Dean closed his eyes for a moment, taking in a deep breath. “You do know them,” he amended. “I just freaked out when you asked about them. But you do know them.” Not exactly the truth, but he was getting warmer.
He blinked and blinked… and kept blinking. Eyes straining and failing to adjust, the nighttime seemed bleaker and more separate than ever before. Fuck, had he lost his footing and tumbled over to another plane of reality, along the way?
, or whatever the fuck,” Dean explained one evening, distracted, bumbling around his workshop. He was building another chair, apparently. Dean built chairs when he was stressed. “
A moment passed before Dean turned to face Cas once again. Whatever it was he had gotten from the drawer, he was hiding it under the covers. Cas hadn’t managed to sneak a glimpse at it.
“That may be true, but I need to do this, Dean. I need the closure. This is… very important to me. And, I’m not entirely sure another opportunity like this will simply present itself.”
“You’ve never even visited our kingdom before, Dean,” he pointed out, steeds at a standstill in the woods bordering Hereafter. “And god knows Hereafterians avoid the Infernal Realm, however they can. Plus, you don’t exactly… make many outside appearances.”
experience with fitting an overgrown grapefruit into his body. He continuously shuddered through it the first time around, Dean’s nose pressed into the curve of his neck, hands stroking up and down the omega’s arms. Castiel could feel the alpha’s purr against his skin.
Castiel frowned for a moment, falling into thought. “I suppose we could label it, yes,” he responded.
Dean could feel his heart skip a beat. He opened his mouth to speak, then shut it. Then opened it again. “You’re kidding.” Could this all have made any less sense? Probably not, at least based on everything Dean knew about Castiel. What he
Sam. He’d have to call Sam, explain to the kid what’s going on. Would he even believe Dean? Probably not. Plus, calling Sam would only add more stress to the boy’s plate, as if getting into law school wasn’t enough. Maybe Dean should hold off on that.
“I suppose so,” Castiel replied as he reached into the pocket of his trenchcoat, pulling out a small slip of paper. He handed it to Dean.
“Anything, man. I mean it. I owe you; you’ve been amazing for as long as I can remember. Hell, make me your personal servant if you want.” Dean paused to chuckle. “Okay, maybe I’m overwhelming you a bit. Let’s start simple. Anything you wanna watch.”
“Because… because I thought that once you got to know me, you’d lose any interest you ever had in me. ‘Cause in the end, I’m just some dumb jock who’s never even dated another guy before.”
With a final nuzzle of the alpha’s cheek, Castiel pulled away. “You’re probably right.” He hesitated. “Oh, and Dean?”
Castiel smiled, albeit tentatively. He took a few sluggish steps over toward Dean before stopping. “Are you sure you’re comfortable with this?”
Not to his surprise, Castiel had already arrived. That, and the hunter was standing just outside one of the yellow doors. Dean parked just a few spaces down from where Castiel stood.
Castiel could feel Dean laugh against him. He furrowed his brow, thoroughly confused. “What’s funny, Dean?” he muttered.
“We haven’t talked in over a year, Meg,” Cas states plainly as he turns back around to face the girl, nonetheless.
Upon entering Castiel’s small kitchen, he gestured for Dean to take a seat. It was now or never. If their relationship was going to progress any further, he knew that he had to be honest. Of course, being honest could just as easily be the end of their relationship. It was an incredibly delicate gamble.
“Okay,” Dean said as the other man slipped into the vehicle. “Think you’ll be able to give me directions?”
handle it. He was managing the situation far better than he would have ever imagined. He sat next to Dean at the table, smiling along as his friend’s family chattered loudly.
Unable to reach his mate’s hand for a discreet but firm squeeze, Castiel spoke gently, “Sit down, Dean. Try not to worry. We have no reason to believe that something is wrong.”
“Can’t. I’m pretty sure it’s family only once he’s out of surgery,” Gabriel says, finishing with a sigh. “Sucks, I know. Trust me, I thought of you right away when I heard the rules.”
Castiel had briefly seen Dean, sans hood, the previous night. Of course, he’d been so desperate for rest that he hadn’t exactly considered much outside of his own immediate needs. He
He pulled into a space just a few doors down from the number Castiel had given him. Dean checked his phone. It was 5:10. He was early. Should he knock? Castiel was probably awake. The guy seemed like an early riser.
Dean has been driving Cas home since the end of football season. Although, Dean doesn’t want to put Cas in a situation in which he would be trapped if he felt he needed to cool off. So the car ride home definitely isn’t going to work out. For Cas's sake, he wanted this conversation to be as comfortable and safe as possible.
To Cas’s dismay, Charlie slid into a frown, furrowing her brow. “Yes, I guess? Maybe? Is something wrong?”
Sam... even if you had kept him spellbound to the dungeon floor, then swallowed every known counter-curse, you couldn't have stopped him. Not with this. Seriously, you know Dean better than I do... you
Weaving through the crowd becomes significantly more difficult with an additional person. Had he ever even held hands with any of his ex-girlfriends? All the same, the slightly contorted trudge is worth it to Dean. He’s turning into a sap, he knows it. He loves the warmth that comes with feeling connected to Cas, physically or emotionally. Fuck it, Cas is his warmth.
Without a word, Castiel leans up and presses a kiss to Dean’s cheek. He pauses for a moment, most likely gauging Dean’s reaction. Dean cracks a smile.
“I get it,” Jimmy cut in. “I get it, okay? I fucked up. Could you just stop chastising me, please?” He then took a few steps back and away from Castiel, a scowl obvious on his face.
? That was just… so far outside the realm of reality. Right? “Are you messing with me? Am I really just that gullible?”
It wasn’t exactly easy to pretend to be a couple with the man you were madly, sickeningly in love with.
Castiel shook his head, and Alfred's features immediately fell. "We salted and burned her remains," the dark-haired hunter said. "But upon entering the house, we were confronted by her ghost. I believe that there is an object anchoring her here. Could you think of what that may be?"
“Okay. Okay, I’m just gonna come right out and tell you.” Dean fell silent, before taking a deep breath. “Actually, first I guess I should tell you that what I said last night slipped. So did the bisexual thing, but I at least put a few seconds of thought into saying that. This, on the other hand, I did not mean to say. As good as it felt.”
“Yeah.” And Sam nodded toward Castiel. “Plus, we were definitely interested in meeting your mate, Dean. A damn
, I was pretty much manipulated at all times, from all angles— told what to do, how to feel. After a while, you start to feel like… a doll. You forget you have a mind of your own, since you’re so rarely allowed to make use of it.”
“Setting my alarm,” Castiel replied. “I forgot to earlier, so I suppose I’m thankful I didn’t fall asleep. Also, I don’t have class until later, remember? So I can’t rely on you to wake me up.”
And that was just the first annoying side effect, it seemed— probably one of many. It wasn’t as if Castiel’s
The next day, Cas arrives at his locker with some amount of hope. He hadn’t realized until the day before how lacking his letter from Dean affects him.
He knows that he has to be blunt, but the words he truly wants to say are still stuck in the back of his throat.
Dean stepped further inside. He shrugged. “I dunno. I mean, it probably went a-ok from everyone else’s perspective. But for me… I ‘unno, man.”
, aside from his newfound distastes for eating and sleeping— which, sure, were probably two of his favorite pastimes. Until—
--and Kansas's "CARRY ON WAYWARD SON" begins to swell through the speakers. Settling in around the brothers, filling Baby. Lush, atmospheric.
“No,” Dean said. He wiped his eyes. “Don’t apologize. I’m the one who’s gotta be apologizing. I love you. Wait, I was right about us being exclusive, right? ‘Cause if we’re not--”
Castiel shook his head. “Well, I know for a fact that Mom didn’t say much. You realize how upset you made her, right? She can barely talk without crying. Did you even consider the consequences this would have on everyone around you? You should have--”
Dean stopped moving, and shook his head. Finally, he turned to look at Castiel. “Why are you worried, Cas?” Dean asked, suddenly speaking noticeably quieter. “Who is in town, and why are you worried that you’re in danger?”
Half-eaten pot roast forgotten in an instant, the alpha demon sprung from his seat, his own hiss covered by the shriek of the chair. “No, don’t— don’t refuse them. They’re… good friends of mine. I sure as hell wasn’t expecting them,
“Yeah, well, I was sorta wonderin’ the same thing,” Dean said, with the gentlest smile he could muster. The woman was already frightened enough. He didn’t want to contribute to it.
“Don’t you have more hunting gear? Shouldn’t we take advantage of that?” Dean asked, entirely thrown off by the other hunter’s decision.
“I… have a bit of an inkling, certainly,” Rowena said, nails digging deeper into the flesh of Cas’s arm. She gazed directly into his eyes. “Infernal magic of some sort or another seems likely. Demonic in nature, maybe? Of course, draconic spellwork is still very much a consideration.”
Dean attempts even another grim. “Hey, don’t worry, man. What he did was probably the best for the both of us.”
Sam didn’t respond immediately, as if he expected his older brother to continue. “Yes, I do. Obviously. He’s been drilling it into our heads since the day I was born.”
Before Sam's "freak out" spirals too far, Eileen nears, pulls into a HUG. She's calming, gentle, but firm--
“Now,” Meg sighs. “Gotta get out of this place. Giving me flashbacks. I’ll see you around later, okay?”
Dean swallowed and stood in place, bloodied machete at his side. He looked around. Thankfully, there was no one in sight. But he knew it wouldn’t stay like that forever. He had to get out of there. He had to-
Not that he would admit that, even to himself. He had no doubt that Dean was a malicious jerk, and he only had to know the rest of the varsity football team to work that one out.
"You never answered me," Meg mutters, her voice still void of any clear emotion. Which, frankly, makes Dean nervous as hell.
Thankfully, Cas still remembers the location of Dean’s locker. It is on the second floor, adjacent to his own. He is late to calculus (where Dean had once more opted to show up), but he manages to slip the brief letter into his ex-boyfriend’s locker.
Watching Dean march from the room, Castiel hesitated, worry over his mate’s safety soon spitting him square in the face. The racket had only swelled; a scuffle was clearly taking place on the ground floor. It wasn’t until the
Dean closed the bedroom door behind his friend. “Sure,” he said, watching Castiel reach for the computer tucked under his bed. “Whatcha need it for?”
Shifty eyed, Cas began to peer around the shop, only slightly disturbed by the disembodied words. Truly, it wasn’t as if he’d been expecting a day-to-day, streamlined retail experience. This was about in line with his expectations, so, whatever.
Fine. Sure. But just in case something goes wrong-- which it usually does for us-- I'm calling for some... preemptive backup.
“Well, that’s definitely… creative,” Castiel replied. Again, he smirked, although with a far less indignant overtone. “Maybe you could come inside and tell me more?”
Gently, Dean lifts Cas a few inches away, so that he can see the younger man’s face. Cas’s cheeks are already tear-streaked, his eyes red and pleading. Unsure of what to say, Dean simply stands there for a moment, holding Castiel against his chest. Cas continues to sob quietly.
“Why, Dean? Why wouldn’t I be able to scent you?” After weeks of turning a blind eye, Castiel couldn’t continue to smother his own concerns. If this was stressing Dean out as much as it very clearly was, then the omega
“My first question. Listen, you don’t have to answer. I was just wondering why you’re having trouble sleeping.”
; the king apologizing with glazed eyes and a smirk, as Castiel felt his extremities begin to grow numb, the room liquifying and whirling inward.
This time, it was Dean and Claire who unleashed giggles of their own, practically leaning on each other for support. Castiel shot them a look, before continuing, “Actually, not quite. I didn’t just befriend Dean… I mated him.”
A neatly groomed, inky black mare, currently stationed within a narrow pool of moonlight; that was the first visual Castiel could make sense of.
hi! i'm actually quite pleased with the second half of this chapter. the first half is a bit sketchy, so i may go back and revise it later. oh, and i actually have the next two chapters planned out! so it shouldn't be long before i put them up. anyway enjoy!!
“I know what you said. But I didn’t hear a lick of worry in your voice. Concern. Don’t you feel a thing, Dean? Has what’s going on still not sunk in?”
“I know, but… I’d feel more comfortable if you knew. I was surprised Charlie hadn’t told you preemptively, honestly,” Castiel mumbled.
Letting out a strangled chuckle, Castiel nodded. “Okay. I’m going to be blunt. Please, though. Don’t interrupt. I need a bit of time to explain.”
Dean freezes. Was it finally starting to spread? Not that Dean didn't know that it would happen eventually. He just didn't expect to be approached so directly. He predicted something more high school-esque; quiet whispers and shocked chatter behind his back. Which, he was totally apt to handle.
Dean turned to the other man. “You ready?” he said. “Dinner’s scheduled for 6 o’clock, so we’ve got about an hour to socialize. Think you can manage, or do you wanna wait in the car for a few minutes?”
Dean is about to ask Cas how his days had went, but Cas is clearly in the mood to get straight to the point.
Dean chuckled. “Just the address should work. Should be able to program it into my phone’s GPS. I’m not really used to usin’ the thing for much more than contacting my family, but I guess my technologically stunted mind is gonna have to figure it out, huh?” He smiled.
Just as Dean was about to speak, the bartender glided in his direction. “Anything I can get for you, Dean?” he asked.
However, Cas’s predictions end up sinking between the floorboards. Dean takes hold of Cas’s left hand, intertwining their fingers. “C’mon,” Dean says again, although his voice has softened significantly.
“I met another hunter. Name’s Castiel. We’re… we’re headin’ out to Iowa tomorrow. To take care of a haunting.”
A hint of surprise lingers on Castiel’s face. “Your mother is deceased.” A statement, not a question. “I am sorry.”
“You really don’t need to know,” Dean said. Castiel could feel hurt seeping in. Aside from last night’s discussion, Dean didn’t typically hide things from him. Right?
The bus ride seems to be quicker than usual. Cas notices immediately that he had drifted into his thoughts again - of course, primarily pertaining to Dean Winchester.
“I ran into a guy. Actually, I ran into a vampire first. Managed to gank the thing, and the guy - um, Castiel - offered to take me along.”
The younger alpha huffed, leaning forward, forearms braced on the tabletop. “All right, so here’s the deal. You guys know of Princess Kaia of Dreamwälk? Well, we’re in love. Her family’s not exactly a big fan of that, though. So, I thought that I could prove my strength as an alpha and potential mate through “rescuing” Prince Castiel. I could then back out of the whole deal, asserting my interest in mating Kaia, instead.”
Dean moves to the porch at some point during the night. He doesn't remember doing it, but that's where Sam finds him in the morning, slouched into a rocking chair that's barely a skeleton, more termite rot than wood.
Dean screwed up in the beginning, with Jack. It wasn't Jack's fault that Cas died, but Dean had been so angry, and so empty, just goddamn hollow inside, like something had reached its hand up into his chest and ripped everything out. And Lucifer—Lucifer had tumbled through the rift, had left Dean standing there with Cas' corpse and a fucking nephilim that kept asking for his dad.
They haven't found a baby monitor that will work inside the bunker. Sam understands why, something about radio waves and the antique machinery in the war room, but Dean had zoned out the one time he'd tried to explain, more interested in watching Cas fight with a flat-packed crib, complete with incomprehensible IKEA instructions. They'd compensated by putting the nursery right across the hall from their bedroom, but Dean isn't -- he doesn't know.
"Look. I just had a fantastic porterhouse, and I'm driving down a road without a monster at the end of it. I don't need you doing—" Dean waves a hand in the air. "Whatever
Dean shouldn't touch; he knows he shouldn't touch. But Cas is close, so close. Dean runs his fingers down the line of his jaw, then skims them over his lower lip. Cas opens up a little, enough to wet the tips of Dean's fingers. Dean shuts his eyes. Something warm and bright uncurls under his ribs.
It doesn't matter how they start out; they almost always end up with Dean as the little spoon. Which he still pretends to find embarrassing -- he's the taller one! An entire inch taller! -- but Cas just hums into his hair and kisses the back of his neck, soft and wet and slow. If Dean is still wearing a shirt, Cas slides his hand underneath it, flattens his palm over Dean's heartbeat, and eventually Dean shifts around until he can turn his head and bite at Cas' jaw, and sometimes one of them sleeps, and sometimes they both sleep, and sometimes neither of them sleep, because they're too busy kissing and kissing and kissing. Those Sundays they stay in bed well after dinnertime, and Sam finally gives in and knocks on the door, because Dean promised to cook dinner, and if that's not going to happen Sam is going to get take-out from that Mexican place in Smith City, and he's not bringing back any for them.
He can smell the sulfur shrouding Dean's blood, taste it on the back of his tongue, thin and sharp, a taint in the air, and he can (almost) see what's left of Dean's soul, the righteous light that had guided him through the gates of hell, into the deepest and darkest corners of perdition. His chest aches as he looks at Dean's new face, Dean's
Cas shows up after dinner -- after Dean has practically paced a hole in the carpet, and after he had crept halfway down the garage stairs seventeen times because he thought he heard something. Cas looks tired and rumpled and kind of like he drove through the night, and Dean wants to kiss him right there in the doorway, but Sam always makes gagging noises when he does that, and it's impolite to throw things at his brother's head.
When Cas finally, finally moves into the bunker, he brings a duffle bag and a small cardboard box. He looks rumpled and tired, frayed in the way that comes from spending a day and a half on a Greyhound bus, shadows under his eyes and stubble creeping over his jaw, and he doesn't say anything for what feels like a really long time, peering around his new bedroom with the box balanced on his hip and the duffle bag slouched beside his feet.
"Yeah, I heard you." Dean doesn't know where this conversation is going, but he doesn't want to take that trip in the dark. He sits up, switches on his bedside lamp. A yawn catches his voice as he says, "I, um—I didn't know I had been."
"No, I -- no," Dean starts, but fear creeps underneath Cas' ribs -- fear that Dean will finally break down and
Carefully, Dean carries the pocket watch into the bunker. Even though it's all wrapped up, he moves like he's holding a bomb. Once he's down in the archive room, he pokes around the shelves until he finds an empty curse box. The only one left is pretty small, had probably been designed for jewelry. Stuffing the whole bundle in there is a tight fit, but after that bitch of a drive, Dean isn't going to risk touching it.
Cas comes back to the bunker on a Sunday, early in the morning, just as the sky is starting to brighten and bruise; Dean is outside, watching the sun nudge the horizon because it’s easier than not sleeping, last night’s whiskey heavy in his arms and legs, the mark a dull ache on the inside of his arm. Cas studies him for a moment, tilts his head but doesn’t quite squint, says hello in a voice like gravel crunching under the Impala’s wheels. He curves his hand over Dean’s cheek, his palm sunrise-cold against Dean’s skin, and Dean kisses him before he disappears for another month, his eyes closed and his heart hammering in his throat.
Dean's thighs start to shake. His toes curl into the sheets, and Cas takes him in as far as he can, heat coiling in his belly at the sounds Dean makes when he comes.
"Yeah, I know." The bed dips and creaks as Dean stands. "Just—you ever gonna let someone take care of
"This case made me think of it," Cas continues. He rattles his ice again, then leans back against the seat, resting the cup on his thigh. "He was stoned first. When that didn't kill him, Emperor Claudius demanded his head."
A shadow slouches past the window—Sam, maybe. Sighing, Cas touches Dean's arm again. He leans in and kisses Dean's jaw, the corner of his mouth.
He goes for Dean's collar this time, curling his fingers in it, digging his knuckles into the dip of Dean's throat. The kiss comes hard, all teeth. Dean leans into it and bites at Cas'  lower lip. He fists his hand in Cas' coat and pushes his tongue into Cas' mouth.
"You can't know that," Dean insists. Cas is standing too close, too close. "What if Chuck just wanted a soap opera?"
"I miss you, too." Cas sighs into the phone, the sound rattling in Dean’s ear like the wind. "Of all the things I have done on earth, I much prefer hunting with you to anything else."
The bed creaks softly as Cas stretches back against the pillows, his knees bent and his legs spread, his hands already twisting in the sheets. Dean presses in as close as he can, leaning in for a kiss, long and slow and dirty, then slides down Cas’ body, running his hands over Cas’ thighs, tracing his fingers over every line and curve of muscle. He noses at the crease of Cas’ hip, first one side and then the other, all stubble and heat and slow, sucking kisses, smiling at the noises Cas makes, the way his back arches off the bed, how his heel digs into Dean’s side.
The meatloaf comes out perfect, as do the potatoes; Cas gets about a third of the way through one before deciding the molecules are too much.
. "Cas, I -- I, um. I wasn't -- um." Jesus Christ, he doesn't even know what he's trying to say. "Cas --"
He closes his eyes and tries to make himself breathe. All he sees is Cas in the moments before he died—Cas taking one last look at him before the Empty wrapped around him, Cas giving him one last trembling, watery smile. Dean has never understood the faith Cas had in him, and he doubts he ever will despite everything Cas said to him. But that smile—that smile destroyed something inside him, something he's not sure will ever heal.
He'd meant it when he said he didn't sign up to babysit the Satan Spawn, that he just wants to get back to work. He's a grunt, a monster-killer. He protects people from the stuff that goes bump in the night. But all this cosmic bullshit—Princes of Hell, archangel nephilims, portals to other dimensions—it's above his paygrade, always has been.
"Okay," Dean says again. The restroom's floor and counters are all dark-polished marble, so his voice hums around the stillness, just enough to set his teeth on edge.
A bedroom across the hall from Dean’s, rarely used. The air inside is cold and stale, and a thin layer of dust is covering the dresser and desk.
Dean stares at him for a second, then mumbles, "Uh," and leans up on his elbows. Jack hasn't been back to Earth much since taking over for Chuck. "Everything alright?"
Light flares behind Sam's shoulder as the sun starts cresting the lake. He pauses before asking, "Where do you think angels go? I mean—you know. After?"
"Metatron betrayed me. He used me to expel the angels, and fighting him was the only way to right that wrong, to reopen heaven so my brothers and sisters could return, but I wanted -- I
"When Jack died," Cas starts, his hands clenched at his sides, "he went to Heaven. But the Empty wanted him, and I'd promised Kelly I'd look out for him. So I…"
After a couple false starts, Sam asks, "What if you're right? About Mom?" He sighs again and looks away. "What if she is dead, and I'm just in denial?"
the cafe's windows are busted. its front door squeaks and swings with the wind. all the food in the walk-in has rotted, but dean finds half a loaf of bread on the counter - stale but not moldy.
—something about Frank faking his own death. He lost track of it about fifteen minutes in and never bothered turning it off.
"Yeah," Sam cuts in. "The book treated it like an official entry. But you're not Caerus, so you only got it halfway off the ground."
"Yeah, you told me that he had some crazy deal with the Empty, and that he cashed it in to keep Billie from icing you."
Sam hesitates for a moment. Then: "Look. Losing Mom, and Cas—that's a lot to process, Dean, especially on no sleep. And the kid—"
Cas gives Dean a long, narrow look before saying, "Initially, that was the plan. But you—" he huffs out a soft, irritable noise. "I'm going to ask you a question, and for once in your life I want you to tell the truth."
Dean knows it doesn't; he's been there too many times. So he kisses Cas' temple again and says, "You know, if Sam's right and Chuck's gone, we're making our own choices from now on."
"Chuck really did a number on us, huh? Got Jack to kill my Mom, almost got me to kill Jack. Sam's shoulder ain't healing right, and you—fuck."
"No thanks," Dean says, shaking his head. The scotch has nearly worn off, but Dean's finally settled enough that he can sit here and watch Jack sleep without trying to climb the walls. "I'm good."
His brain buzzes for a second, skids around like old tires on a rough patch of road. When he gets his bearings again, he sees Cas crouched in front of the portal, using his angel blade to scratch a complicated sigil into the dirt.
"Well, you have it now." Dean tries to picture Cas collecting things -- seashells or ashtrays or model airplanes -- but his mind blanks out completely before he gets anywhere. "If you want."
Dumah hesitates for a second. She shoots Dean a look that's sharper than a knife, then lets Sam herd her outside.
"What—?" Dean jerks back a little. He thinks of Lucifer puppeting Cas' body around the bunker, of him twisting Cas' face into a smirk and saying Dean's name with Cas' voice. "No. No way. You—I wouldn't—"
"It is," Cas says, moving closer to the table. The library's yellowish light is leeching the color from his face. "But the speck that remains—I think it's rotting instead of regenerating."
She makes a soft, scoffing noise and turns her attention to Jack. "The Devil's spawn, isn't he. You'd think he would've come out with horns and a tail. Hooves, maybe. Something to give us a wee bit of warning."
Mary Grace shifts again, stretching her little legs and flexing her tiny feet. Dean loves her so much he thinks it might kill him.
"I'm sorry," Cas says, eyes flashing. He's gorgeous when he's angry, always has been, but right now—fuck. "I didn't realize I needed your permission to go home."
He opens his mouth, but nothing comes out. He can't decide if it's because he's a coward or because too much was left unsaid. Either way, he just stands there needing a drink and feeling like he's going to puke.
"The next time I see any of you," Death says blandly, his gaze lingering too long on Cas as he bleeds into a copper bowl, "I expect to take you to your end."
"Yeah." Sam pulls one out of his suit pocket and hands it to Dean. "I found them under the bathroom sink."
Dean asks, "What're you thinking?" as he unlaces Jack's shoes. He's got red stains at the corners of his mouth, like he's been coughing up blood. "Pneumonia? TB?"
"I know that," Cas continues. He sounds one part devastated and two parts furious. "But he needs you."
He breathes again, rubs his burning eyes with the heels of his hands. All he can think about is the look on Cas' face as they fought, the set of Cas' shoulders as he walked out the door.
And for weeks, he told himself it was better that way. He told himself that Cas had been screwing up their plans, that it was Cas' fault Mary died, that it didn't matter because he'd never needed anyone but Sam anyway.
The app takes his cell number and email address, then asks him a good thirty questions about his likes and dislikes. He tells it he's looking for women only, because picking up dudes would just make him think of Cas, and he says that he prefers dark hair and light eyes, wants someone fairly close to his own age, no younger than twenty-five. No smokers, because it's nearly impossible to get that smell out of the Impala's leather. Nothing serious, because he travels a lot for his job.
"I guess you'd know," Dean says. It's the closest he's ever come to admitting it, except to himself. "I just—right now, I don't believe that either."
"And, it's severely depleted," Cas says, leaning back in his chair. "Beyond that, I can't tell much. Perhaps once it begins to regenerate—" He sighs and rubs his face again. "Jack is an anomaly. If his illness has an angelic cause, I wouldn't even know where to start."
The room is standard: balding carpet, faded wallpaper, and ugly bedspread hiding a lumpy bed. The plumbing rattles behind the walls as Dean puts a six-pack in the fridge—Jack taking another shower.
It's been a while since Dean's done this—since he's even really wanted to. He fumbles a little as he gets Cas on the bed, as he unzips Cas' slacks and pulls out his dick. But there's a rhythm to it, a kind of ebb and flow, and once Cas is in his mouth, Dean remembers it. He hollows his cheeks and draws his tongue up Cas' length, and when Cas bumps the back of his throat he swallows and breathes through his nose. Cas touches Dean's throat and jaw, then sifts a hand through Dean's hair. Dean tips his head until Cas' palm is a warm weight at the back of his neck.
He stops dead as something shifts in the air—something that buzzes in his ears, slithers up the back of his neck. Everything is heavy, humming with reverse pressure. Cas' eyes widen. Dean turns and reaches for the angel blade at his hip.
"Well, goodbye, Cas," he says woodenly. "Goodbye, Kelly. Goodbye, Crowley." He takes a breath that smells like split wood and gasoline. "Goodbye, Mom."
"I didn't at first," Cas admits. "I've loved you for years, but I didn't recognize it for what it was until I lost my grace. When I was human, it was unmistakable. I ached with it constantly."
"Cas?" Sam asks slowly. He looks around again, like he thinks Cas is waiting on the side of the road. A beat later he figures it out; he adds, "Oh, okay," and nods his head. "Out there?"
"Hey," Sam barks, turning in his chair. The dinette wobbles under the sudden weight of his elbow. "I know you're busy being all—" wisely, he waves a hand around instead of finishing that sentence "—but we're never going to solve this if you don't clock in."
Cas says, "Well, I was," and walks toward them. The blue-bright light from the payphone casts his face in shadows and angles. "But then I annoyed an ancient cosmic being so much that it sent me back."
Whatever they are, it has mostly happened on the road, in cheap motels and in the back of the Impala, and -- on one memorable occasion -- in a campsite in the Ozarks, inside a tent Cas manifested with the last shreds of his grace. They've only spent the whole night together a handful of times, because one of them always had to go do
Sam nudges Dean's side again. "I get it. Believe me, I get it." He pauses for a moment, scratches his jaw. "After this Chuck stuff is settled, we'll work on getting him back."
The real Amara drowns all that out. Whenever she draws him into her orbit, everything else disappears. The world behind her blurs. An empty pressure rings in his ears. When she brought him to that field, everything had been quiet, so fucking quiet. No birds. No wind. No heartbeats. No
Dean ends up shoved against the dresser, a knob digging into his hip. He tugs Cas' shirt out of his slacks and hooks his leg around Cas' thigh. Cas palms Dean's throat. He pulls on Dean's belt and pops the button on Dean's jeans. He presses his hot, wet mouth to the spot below Dean's ear.
Dean thinks about Cas being swallowed by the Empty. Smiling through tears as black goo surrounded him. Sacrificing himself so Dean would keep breathing another few days.
Hearing it out loud makes Dean tighten his grip on the wheel. He'd spent so long burying it that he figured no one else had noticed. But Sam is Sam. He's always been too smart for his own good.
The guilt sharpens and writhes, stabbing at something underneath Dean's ribs. "Damn it, Cas. I would've come. I would've -- "
-- so he gathers Dean close, holding one hand at the back of Dean's neck, letting his thumb brush the dip behind Dean's ear. It's a true measure of Dean's condition that he doesn't bristle, that he doesn't pretend he's not in need of comfort.
He's tired. So fucking tired. Tired of having to swing at things that are so much bigger than him and losing people when he misses.
US 281 is a two-laner between Red Cloud and Lebanon, cuts a nearly-straight and narrow line through cornfields and flint hills. Sam is dozing with his head tipped against the window; Jack is futzing with a plastic hand-puzzle they picked up at a fuel stop in Des Moines. Dean has Iron Maiden in the tape deck—"Hallowed be Thy Name." He squints against the afternoon sun slicing through the Impala's windshield.
After Sam goes to sleep, Dean pulls out the photo of Cas he keeps in the front pocket of his journal. He runs his finger along the worn right edge, the crease at the bottom-left corner. He touches the faint dent in Cas' shoulder, an impression made by the anti-possession charm pinned to the journal's first page.
"I want to," Dean insists. "I just—I don't really ever say this kind of thing." He looks at Cas' face, at the light shining behind it like a halo. "I love you. I have for a long time. Since the leviathan, at least. Maybe before that. I probably shoulda told you."
This is different, bone-deep and constant; it clamors inside him like a living thing, gnawing at the edges of his grace. He's often suspected he left a piece of himself behind when he pulled Dean from perdition -- only a sliver, but enough. The shadow on Dean's soul lengthens every day, and Cas feels it like a hand around his own throat.
"Not your fault," Dean says. He gathers up the books on the bed and adds them to the pile on the nightstand. "What do you remember?"
He can't think about the alternative—that Cas is hurt somewhere, dying. He puts his back to a tree and stretches his arm a few times to ease the ache in his elbow. He breathes in, out. In, out. His heart is beating in his throat.
"Cas," Dean says, his voice echoing around the motel's tiny bathroom. He's sitting on the floor, his back against the bathtub and a bottle of Maker's Mark in his lap. "I know you're gone, and probably gonna stay gone, but I, I wanna tell you I'm sorry."
Unsurprisingly, it ends up being a bad night. A sullen, restless ache burrows into the space behind Dean's ribs, and by ten-thirty, it's clear that nothing's going to put him to sleep but a two-by-four to the back of the head. By midnight, he's sitting on his bed with his back against the headboard and a bottle of Maker's Mark in his lap, waiting for his heartburn to settle so he can have another shot. At his knee, his laptop is open to an episode of
Dean leans back against the car, one knee slightly bent. He rolls his shoulders and tugs on one of his sleeves, then rests his hands where the front quarter-panel curves up into the hood. He feels ridiculous. He probably looks ridiculous.
"Lemme tell you something, sister." Dean's heart is beating in his throat. "I don't give a rat's ass about Heaven. I never have. You guys have been a pain in my ass for ten fucking years."
Dean reaches for him without thinking, cradles the uninjured side of his face with one hand and touches the angry skin below the cut with the other. His thumb bumps the corner of Cas' mouth, and Cas makes a noise that Dean feels underneath his ribs. He closes his eyes for a second, breathes. When he opens them again, they're nose to nose. He almost dips into it, almost. Cas' lips part, soft and slow. Then he hustles Dean back by a handful of his shirt.
Dean mumbles, "Fuck," and fists his hand in Cas' coat. He tucks his face into Cas' neck and breathes Cas in.
past what might've been a cafe, cas hops out and hurries down a dirt road. the corpse of a train is sitting on the tracks.
Cas heads out at the end of the week, murmuring about a "loose end" he needs to tie up; he comes back three days later looking windswept and smelling like the Kansas rain, carrying a canvas grocery bag full of vegetables.
"It's not like that," Sam says. "You don't even need to leave your throne. We're looking for a spell and figured you'd be the best person to ask."
They need to regroup, so they help themselves to a couple of rooms at a mauve, art deco dump called the Chateau Charmont. Dean takes a single for himself, and he gives Sam the Impala's keys so he can hit up the hoodoo shop on College Avenue.
." Cas palms Dean's hip, digging his thumb in right above the waistband of his jeans. "Admit that I want you? That I've wanted you? That I'm tired of waiting for you to decide how you feel?"
Sam apparently wants to hover over the kid, so Dean just leaves him to it. He shrugs off his jacket and sits on the edge of the bed. His back aches from driving all day and cutting enough wood for a pyre the night before, and his hangover is still hanging around, a dull throb behind his eyes and pressure at the base of his skull.
Cas doesn't eat anything, and Sam spends ten minutes on the phone, talking Rudy through the different ways to kill a lamia, but other than that it's almost normal -- the four of them sitting around the table together, just shooting the shit and sharing a meal.
He finds the Impala parked at the third motel he checks. Dean is standing at the open trunk, and Cas feels — he feels - he —
Sam walks into the library with his phone to his ear. He says, "Yeah. Sounds good," before hanging up and parking himself beside the mini-fridge.
A fucking chocolate martini, because molecules or not he's developed a sweet-tooth over the last few months. He chews watermelon gum when he drives, and he leaves Starburst wrappers on the couch when he watches tv, and he likes to hang out in the bunker's kitchen when Dean is baking, just so he can sample the pie filling while it's hot and sneak raw cookie dough behind Dean's back. When Dean tells him not to, he just shrugs and says,
"He was running a fortune-for-hire racket. You paid him a fee, and he floated you a few hours of good luck."
Cas shifts a little, a flicker of light and shadow at the corner of Dean's eye. He says, "I assume the ugly part is that I'm only here temporarily."
"Jesus Christ." Dean slops beer all over the map table as he jolts out of his chair. "'Unwell' mighta been an understatement."
As they're crossing into Wyoming, Sam says, "Hey. We still got probably twelve hours until we're home. You want me to drive?"
He turns back to his stuff, digging two more sweaters from the bag -- the first a red, orange, and brown nightmare that he puts in the chest of drawers, the second a gray and purple mess that he pulls over his head with a quiet sigh. It's too big for him, the collar yawning to one side and the cuffs stretching well past his wrists. He looks ridiculous; Dean wants to touch the long cord of his neck, the careful hollow of his throat.
At midnight, Dean gives up and pours himself two fingers of bourbon. When Sam huffs about it, he grabs the glass and the bottle and heads back his room.
Cas kisses Dean's forehead again, his mouth lingering. "You told me you love me. Right before you fell unconscious."
"I do," Dean admits, because he does. He really fucking does. "I just—I don't understand why it's always gotta be us. Why it's gotta be my family, my friends. My—" Dean chokes out a noise and looks away.
"She gave Lindsay a ride after practice that night," Sam continues. "But Lindsay's parents said she never came home."
"Got it." Sam fishes their laptop out of his bag and tosses it on Dean's bed. "Check and see if there are any photos of the cemetery online."
"It wasn't this bad when I called," Cas says. He shifts his hold on Jack so Dean can grab his legs. "He only lost consciousness about an hour ago."
The Empty purrs, "We did," and tips its oil-puddle head to the side. "I said I wanted you to suffer. That I'd collect you once you'd given yourself permission to be happy. The thing is, you have a real knack for making yourself miserable, Castiel. For wanting things that are—" it cuts an eyeless look at Dean "—out of your reach. Besides, I know what you're planning to do about God."
ask, and Cas will be forced to see the anger and betrayal on Dean's face when he refuses, when he admits that he isn't strong enough to do what Dean wants. He already killed Dean once. He already killed Dean a thousand times. Naomi's copies had been perfect: some had smiled at Cas and some had cursed at him; some had begged Cas not to do it, and some had promised things Cas had still then been pretending he didn't want.
"I was fine," Cas insists, frustration tugging at the corners of his mouth. He folds the sweater and tucks it into the chest of drawers, then takes another one out of his bag, this one three shades of blue divided by green stripes. "I was budgeting. Warm clothing seemed like a better investment than running the heater every time I felt cold."
A moment later, Sam gets up and heads for the coffee pot. As he's refilling his cup, he says, "You should call Cas."
"I didn't use much," Cas says, shaking his head. His sleeves are rolled up to his elbows, and blood is streaked up and down his arm. "Dean, Hannah never should've asked that of me."
"He, uh—he wasn't—" Dean bites the inside of his cheek so he doesn't grab the bottle again. He hasn't eaten much in the last forty-eight hours; another shot will just put his gut on a slow boil. "I ain't talking about this."
Dean turns around; Cas is yawning in the doorway, his hair everywhere and his bare toes curling in the carpet. He walks over, rubbing at his eyes, then wraps his arms around Dean and noses at Dean's jaw.
"Earlier, you asked if I was okay." After a pause, Cas heaves out a sigh. "I'm… not. Letting a demon inhabit Jack's body is—"
Sam walks into the kitchen as Dean is spreading peanut butter on a slice of bread. He's supposed to be downstairs with Jack, so Dean points the knife at him and says, "You're supposed to be downstairs with Jack."
"I didn't end bad," Sam repeats. "When I was the freak." He stands as he continues, "When I was drinking demon blood."
. But he knows what an angel blade through the chest means, had watched the light burst from Cas' eyes and nose and mouth. He'd knelt by Cas' body until sunrise, held his hand until it went cold and stiff.
He says, "Dean, I meant everything I said to you in those last moments. You're a good man. Knowing you has changed me in ways I scarcely comprehend. And I do love you." He skims two fingers down the line of Dean's jaw. "But I said it because it was the only thing that would trigger my deal. I hate that I had to burden you with it to save you."
It's just after five; through the open door behind them, the sky is purple with the last hints of sunset. "I don't know. Nine?"
At some point, he gets up so he can hobble into the bathroom and take a piss. He slaps some water on his face without looking at himself in the mirror. He stands there for a few minutes, hunched over the sink, breathing in the smell of stale water as his hands shake against the wet porcelain.
"Dean." Cas turns slightly, laying his hand on Dean's wrist. "You know I wouldn't leave if it wasn't necessary."
He grabs Cas by the front of his coat and smashes their mouths together. It's terrible—clumsy, tear-wet, more teeth at first than lips—but Dean can't get enough of it, doesn't care that his brother is watching, that the Empty's impatience is churning the air at his back. He pulls Cas closer, pushes a hand into Cas' hair, slides his tongue into Cas' mouth.
"Logan, Utah," Cas replies, and that’s over a thousand miles from Missouri, too far drive to out there on the pretense of a hunt, but he wants to — Jesus Christ, he wants to. He and Sam came to Springfield for a job that turned out to be bogus, and Sam figured they’d might as well stay the night and make a few dollars since they already charged the room, but Dean would hit the road in an instant if he thought Cas wanted him around.
"Yes," Cas snaps, anger burning in his cheeks. "There is a chance Michael might return before I'm useful again. But—"
Dean jerks awake to a loud noise—his book sliding out of his lap and thudding to the floor. He'd been nap dreaming about Michael chasing him, screaming around him like a blue-white hurricane. He grunts, "Fuck," and sits up straight, then takes a few breaths while he waits for his heart to stop pounding. He can't tell what time it is down here, but it feels late. The air tastes smoky. It still smells like angelica and palo santo.
"Yeah," Sam says, softening. "Hey, if it's here, there are probably notes on it somewhere. That'll give us a place to start."
The pantry is dusty. Dean's hands shake as he grabs two cans of beans and a big thing of diced tomatoes. Chili's easy to make, and it'll use up the leftover ground chuck in the freezer. The other half of the package got turned into hamburgers last week. Dean had showed Jack how to make them—how to season the meat, how to form the patties, how to lay them in the pan without getting burnt by spitting grease.
Dean's knees start to wobble. It's been a long couple of days, and he's mostly been drinking his meals for the last eighteen hours. He downs the Glenlivet he grabbed as Cas showed up and sits on the edge of the bed.
Dean's knees pop as he climbs out of the Impala. Every muscle in his body aches; he hobbles up the garage stairs like an old man.
Dean—he doesn't fucking know. "I couldn't save Mom. I couldn't save Cas. I can't even save a scared little kid." Billie's just staring at him, but now that he's started, he can't make himself stop. "Sam keeps trying to fix it, but I just keep dragging him down. So… I'm not gonna beg, okay? If it's my time, it's my time."
"Dean," Cas says again. He reaches up and rests his hand on Dean's shoulder. "Your mother… Jack was soulless when he killed her."
Sam and Eileen don't knock on his door until nearly ten. Judging by the hickey underneath Sam's ear, Dean doesn't need to ask why. Normally, he'd rib them a little, but he dozed off while he was waiting for them and woke up feeling like he didn't fit inside his skin. All he wants to do now is get the job done, have a couple of drinks, and go back to sleep.
"Dean," Cas says, soft. He slides his hand from Dean's shoulder to the curve of Dean's neck. His thumb brushes Dean's throat, and Dean closes his eyes. "It's us."
An ache spreads underneath Dean's ribs. He grunts, "We—it ain't like that," and reaches for the scotch.
Outside, the sun is high in the sky and blazing hot. He sheds his flannel and drops it on the Impala's hood, then crouches beside the pyre and starts moving the ashes into the can. By the third or fourth scoop, his eyes are stinging so badly he has to close them for a second.
Climbing up the hill is a struggle; there's no path, and it's steep enough that he spends most of the trip crawling on his hands and knees. It takes him ten minutes, maybe fifteen. He gets to the top with dirt in his mouth and bramble-scratches all over his hands.
Dean says, "Yeah," and grabs a towel to wipe the ashes off his hands. "Look, why don't you go take a load off. I'll stay with the kid."
Dean flushes a little. "Sam—he's been trying to get me to keep a journal. He thinks it'll help with—you know." He taps his temple. "All the messy stuff up here."
Cas smiles a little; he remembers the day Dean summoned him to that barn, how he'd given Dean an estimate of his true size and Dean had crudely accused him of boasting. Still wanting to touch, he slides his hand up to Dean's shoulder, lets it rest at the curve of Dean's neck. Dean's eyes burn black again; he makes a low, choked noise in the back of his throat, curling his hands into fists and Cas pulls him close.
. He realized that the constant ache in his chest wasn't about getting his hand down Cas' pants or shoving his dick in Cas' mouth. It was about love. It was about
What Cas is saying doesn't really register—Dean knows what he is, how little he's worth. It's that Cas is digging up these graves
Snarling, he shoves everything off the counter: the beans, the tomatoes, the wrinkly onion he found in the back of the fridge. Its papery skin sheds as it rolls across the floor.
"I'm not selfish enough to ask you to hitch your wagon to someone like me. I've had one foot in the grave since I was six years-old and I doubt I'm making it out of this Chuck shit alive. But that doesn't mean I don't want it—that I don't want you." Dean stands, shaking pins and needles out of his foot. "For what it's worth, you're pretty much the only thing I've wanted for myself since my dad put a gun I my hand."
His mouth opens around a lie, but he makes himself swallow it. It's not like he's ever going to see this chick again. "Yeah. He—he died right in front of me. I couldn't save him."
Dean knocks his shot back so fast that scotch slops down his chin. He wipes his mouth with his sleeve and barks, "Shut up, alright? Just—sit down." He kicks the closest chair away from the table and pours himself another drink. "Sit your ass down and—"
Cas just shrugs, human in a way that makes Dean ache a little. "It's not as bad as it was before." He takes a small bite, chewing and swallowing thoughtfully. "With my own grace... I still taste the parts, but I can also taste the whole if I really try. Besides, you seem to enjoy it."
of Dean's bed, the side Dean keeps to his back when he sleeps, the side that always feels cold when he wakes up in the morning. Cas catches Dean's hand and pulls him close, pulls until Dean is standing in front of him, and Dean kneels between Cas' legs because he wants to see Cas' face, because that side of the bed isn't going to be cold anymore, because Cas is going to be there in the morning, snoring into his shoulder and probably hogging all the blankets, and that's exactly what Dean wants, he knows it now, can feel it, a dull ache underneath his ribs.
As he reaches down to untie his boots, he hears Sam and Jack murmuring on the other side of the partition. A beat or two later, Sam walks over to the beds with his bag over his shoulder and a pissy twist to his mouth. Dean doesn't bother, just wrestles his left foot out of his boot and starts on his right. He's already irritated—the room is shitty, and having three "adults" bumped the price from $75 to $110. The last thing he needs is Sam giving him another song and dance about Antichrist Superstar being their only hope.
He rubs his wet eyes, looks at Cas' blood smeared on the door. He looks at where Cas was standing when the Empty came for him, where he was standing when he said…
—but Dean squeezes his hands into fists so he doesn't grab his phone. He's sure what Mia does helps some people, but he doesn't think it would help him. Having Cas back for a few minutes just to lose him again would probably send him straight off the deep end.
He grabs the can, closes the trunk, and wades through the knee-high prairie grass between the windmill and the road.
By dinnertime, Dean's jittery from drinking a pot and a half of coffee and Sam's steadily working his way through their collection of dusty grimoires. Unfortunately, the spells aren't much better than the books. Anything close requires a body and sounds like Frankenstein levels of necromancy.
Yeah. He was a stray I found when... when you were gone. Was the only thing left after Chuck temporarily eradicated every damn living being. Y'know, as you do.
Dean bit his lip. “I didn’t really think about it. I dunno, Sammy. Listen, it was hard enough calling you, can you imagine having to talk to
“Would you boys like to join the rest of the family in the living room? Ellen and I were just finishing up dinner. John decided to sit one out, considering the mashed potato incident of last year.”
“What do you mean?” Castiel asked. He followed this up with a gentle grin, which he could only hope didn’t look as nervous as he felt.
“Hello, Alfred,” Dean heard Castiel say. After a moment, the hunter continued. “Yes, we have successfully expelled Elizabeth’s ghost. You are safe to return home.”
Until, of course, it dawned on him.“Wait, the rest of the family isn’t still in the house, are they?” Dean asked.
kind of how he’d ended up in his current artificial dilemma, after all. For the foreseeable future, Castiel’s guard would remain safe on the highest perch possible, and it wasn’t touching ground anytime soon. No way.
Castiel’s cheeks were stained red as he retracted his step forward. “I’m sorry,” he said. “I’m not typically this forward. Clearly. But you are obviously a very kind person, considering you invited me over here. And I’ve known for months that you’re good-looking. I was just wondering if you could… give me a chance. Take that to mean what you want. Although I understand if you don’t even want to consider it. I’ve treated you terribly. I’m so sorry, Dean. I just wish I was better with people. I know that someone lacking any substantial people skills is probably not what someone as charismatic as you is looking for. I was just… wondering.”
Castiel was somehow relieved, yet also nearing an aneurysm. All in all, he was… conflicted. Still, the brute displays were entertaining, nonetheless.
“Follow me.” Castiel had regained his composure. Dean followed him as he made his way around to the back of the house.
Quirking a brow in his older brother’s direction, Sam clucked his tongue. “Oh, is that so? Very interesting.”
Dean freezes. Still staring into his locker - in part to seem more laid-back toward the situation - Dean speaks with a false sense of confidence. “Cas?”
So, they continued to sleep together, no strings attached. Except Castiel, deep in his gut, knew he wanted there be to strings. A lot of strings. He’d even have settled for tangles.
Dean sighs and slings his backpack over his shoulder. Brimming with anger, he decides that practice may not be the best option for the day. Coach Singer may kill him later, but at least he doesn't risk hurting any of his more innocent teammates.
Hey, kiddo. Guess it's that time of the day again, huh? Routine says I'm gonna have to bother you, now. Sorry about that.
Castiel froze up instantly, but Dean’s expression only brightened. “Yeah, it was,” Dean said. “We both had some trouble learnin’ what was okay. What sorta interactions were on the table now that we were together.”
As Claire detached herself, Kaia began to shuffle her feet. It was more obvious than ever how uncomfortable she was over the attention. “I spoke to Claire. Through her dreams.”
The omega sucked in air through his teeth. “Wow. That’s… wow. You were right, it’s certainly a lot to process.” He frowned. Wait a second— “Do you still have the Mark, then?”
Cas side-eyed his friend, chewing his lip before replying slowly, seemingly to no one in particular, “Hi, I’m Cas. Um. Nice to meet… you? Yeah, sorry, who am I speaking to?” He was a human, for heaven’s sake; he wasn’t used to this, as expected as it might have been. Witches were certainly avant-garde, Cas could give them that.
Charlie’d shot him a text thirty minutes prior, letting Cas know she’d be stopping by for a check-in, in between her array of moving-related errands. Cas would continue to babysit The Moss for another day or two; still, she’d felt that a wellness check would be smart. Cas had to agree with her, there. Because, hey, it wasn’t as if he had any experience caring for magically enhanced,
He didn’t even hear the hard patter of approaching footsteps, before his biceps were being grabbed and his limp form was yanked from the seat.
. Listen; I get the nerves, okay? And, like, I don’t even expect them to go away when you guys meet. She’s great, but she’s still an acquired taste… if it’s not totally insensitive to say that about another person. But this is important, Cas. I care about you too much to be lax, right now. Got it?”
“Gabriel is… invasive,” Cas responds. “He does not know that I am currently dating someone. If he were to know, I doubt that I ever hear the end of his ‘jokes’.”
As much as he lived for his and Dean’s more active conversations, Cas also reveled in the security of their quieter rituals. Apparently, Cas had developed a bit of a
Hey, Dean. Pretty sure I'm reading this right, so-- welcome to the gay hunters club. We've been waiting for you.
Dean’s teammate grins maniacally. “Y’see, if you actually break up with him, he’ll think it was an actual attempt at a relationship. That ruins the fun, right?” He pauses, while Dean continues to stare blankly in another direction. “And of course, the whole fucking school will think you’re gay or something. But that’s on you.”
Sure, it wasn’t an especially threatening setup, but he wasn’t exactly coming at the situation from the calmest headspace. Thus, there was an almost menacing ambiance filtering through the shop’s walls, clamoring in Cas’s direction. It wasn’t
Cas’s expression became immediately blank. “Dean, I don’t know what exactly there is for me to decide. Aside from your suggestion.”
In an instant, Dean’s brows flew upward. “You can?” he asked, trying to subdue the excitement in his voice.
Castiel had never been the most competent driver. He had neglected even trying for his license until he was twenty-one. It didn’t come as too much of a surprise that he’d gotten himself into a crash. Initially, Dean hadn’t thought much of the phonecall. He’d assumed it had just been a routine fender bender. Of course, that was until Gabriel hadn’t uttered those defining words: “Cas is cooped up in the hospital.”
Castiel squinted at the computer screen. “You said that it is ‘fucking hard being in love with someone so much kinder, more intelligent, and frankly more amazing’ than you,” Castiel read. He looked toward Dean, who avoided eye contact. “Dean, I doubt that’s even possible.”
Dean looked down for a moment, before reestablishing eye-contact with Castiel. “Near the end of training, um, I sorta said I’m still not sure I should have.”
Castiel broke the brief eye contact he had had with Dean. “Oh,” he muttered. “I don’t mind answering. I was having nightmares.”
Lucifer appears genuinely shocked, although Dean chalks it up as a facade. “Hey, you can calm down. I just wanted to tell you that Castiel is still madly in love with you.”
“Oh,” Dean said, turning his eyes back ahead as he started the Impala. “Guess that makes sense. We heading back to the motel?”
"Dude, dude," Gavin starts. "If you're even thinking about an actual relationship with this guy... you gotta stop. Snap out of it, man. You don't even like guys like that."
Somehow, even more than Castiel had anticipated. If not for Dean’s ever tightening grip, Castiel likely would have flinched away as soon as his skin was pierced by the other’s canines. What kind of masochistic psychopath of an omega would ever think this felt
again i wrote this pretty quickly but i looked over it more than a few times and i think i found most of the errors! kudos are super cool but comments mean a lot so if you have the time i'd love to hear your feedback
Picking up his backpack, Castiel turns to bolt away. However, he ends up with a strong hand on his shoulder, pulling him back.
The angel’s features relaxed, and he shook his head. “No,” he said. “This is an entirely separate matter.”
Castiel had furiously psyched himself up and was prepared to be jumped as soon as he entered the bedroom— if not before then. But, to his more than mild amazement, Dean restrained himself. The alpha was perched on the edge of their bed, knuckles turning white as his grip practically tore into the mattress. His gaze was plastered to the floor in the room’s far corner.
The young man spent a moment looking around. His gaze immediately drifted to the pool tables, but he remembered what Bobby had said. If he caught Dean gambling, the outcome wouldn’t be pretty. He peered over toward the bar. Maybe he could scope out a potential one night stand. Not that Bobby would be happy, but he had never explicitly said no.
“So you’ll be burning this? Just the hair, right? I didn’t get the locket until after Elizabeth’s death. Still, it reminds me of her,” Alfred said meekly.
Dean felt like everything he knew about his and Castiel’s flimsy relationship was beginning to crash around him. He opted to ignore that. “Dude, what are you even talking about? Nervous? That’s a lot of times to get nervous.”
“Okay, I’ll take that as a yes. Just warning you now, man, it’s not gonna work. My mom is probably going to want you gone ten times as much as Bobby does.”
He was quick to continue, “The Mark of Cain, it was called. That was the deal I made, to save Sammy. Soon as I had the Mark, I… well, I was still human, but the world sure as hell stopped looking at me that way. Damn thing kinda turned me into a monster, if I’m bein’ honest. And since I wasn’t exactly considered a human anymore, at least
, necessarily. At least, not painful. Just… very strange.” He sighed. Rowena leaned forward, tipping the weight of her body in Cas's direction. “I spilled hot coffee on myself and wasn’t burnt. No pain, either. I can’t sleep. I haven’t tasted food in a week. Oh, I haven’t slept in a week, either, so I definitely should mention that. Also, once, not too long after this all started, my entire abdomen glowed blue, before I was knocked unconscious for… a few hours, I believe?”
Castiel looked down. “The back entrance. Thankfully Elizabeth's spirit didn't think to lock it immediately,” he said. “But that is not of import.”
Oh, actually-- you're kind of my step-brother, though, aren't you? At least, there's gotta be some connection on the... jacked up hunter-angel family tree.
As it would turn out, a trip to the kitchen didn’t offer much insight, either. Groaning his frustration, Cas shuffled over to the sink, honing in on the windowsill-dwelling houseplants. There was a modest trio, all potted herbs.
Oh, don't act as if I don't already know just why you're here, you itty bitty gnat. Learning of the logistics is merely... a curiosity.
Dean sighed. “What I’m getting at, is just picture how much easier it would be if we were, y’know, family. We basically are already. And we’re probably gonna be bachelors for a while, so-”
But Cas recognizes that he is probably just over-analyzing. He brushes those thoughts aside and squeezes back into the crowd of students.
Seeming to sense the silence that followed wasn’t a comfortable one, Dean pulled away from Castiel’s neck. “Cas? Everything alright?”
What shocked him over all else was the thrill that came with dating Dean Winchester. And then there was the fact that Dean was actually not a shitty person; instead he was tolerable, if not kind. And charming, with an interesting sense of humor. He was extraordinarily beautiful as well - but again, Castiel was far from admitting that aloud or to himself.
Dean sighed. “I’m sorry, Sam, but this is real. I don’t know how I’m gonna prove it to you, but this is real as you and me.”
“Honey? Is everything alright?” On instinct, Dean smiled at the sound of his mother’s voice. Of course, his expression quickly fell when he remembered the task at hand.
“Alfred, is that where the lock of hair is located?” Castiel asked, not even attempting to peer over and into the locket.
Dean offered the woman another grin. “Ah, you might not even want to know. Still not buying it myself.”
Although he appeared slightly surprised, Dean lit up as well. “Truth or dare something you’ve been thinkin’ about lately? I get it, man. The whole lost teenage years feeling. Make total sense. You wanna start?”
The slight aprehension he had felt at first was gone now, and the new cleaner perfectly knew how to maneuver the platform and wasn't spooked by its creaking or swaying anymore.
"I don't know, some guy working there, i didn't get the name, look -" Luke slammed his callused hand on the metal door and brutally closed his employee's locker, almost getting Dean's fingers pinched in the process. "I don't give a rat's ass who called. You didn't do your damn job, so you're gonna go there and finish it !"
It took the cleaner a few seconds to register three faces had turned to him. The realization instantly made him snap out of his fleeting, lust filled daze. Absolutely mortified, he looked down at his cleaning equipment to avoid the inquisitive gazes and grabbed a his big spraying bottle to coat the glass in a thick layer of detergent he proceeded to wipe conscientiously, putting some unnatural effort into it. To complete his calculated careless attitude, he whistled while he worked. But his eyebrows, still furrowed in concern, betrayed his lingering embarassment. Lucky for him, his loose coveralls were dissimulating the half mast situation going on down south.
"The twist is, it's a trap and he really invited me to clean them all." Laughed Dean, always resorting to humor when he was nervous.
"Wait, how much do i owe you ?" Wondered the cleaner, already getting a hand in his pocket to reach for his wallet.
"The, uhm, the feeling's mutual. Very much so. B-but maybe can i interest you in another form of requital," the boss paused for a second. "A dinner, perhaps ? At my place ?"
"Really now ? You're breaking into employees' safes to steal their belongings ?" Porter retorted, faking a cocky smile and looking down on his soon-to-be-previous boss. "Good luck trying to use that against me in a court of law. Haven't you heard of the exclusionary rule ?"
Castiel got up his chair and, in a desperate attempt to look busy and absolutely not pressed, he grabbed a paper at random on his desk and left his office to go to the photocopier.
The businessman lifted a hand up, with the very obvious intent to smack it flat on the cleaner's butt. Dean lifted said butt up to present it fully, so eager to receive a punishment he absolutely deserved. And wanted badly.
The screen of the CEO's phone lit up, breaking their little moment. He didn't pick up the call instantly, though. He brought his fingers to his lips to kiss them before pressing them on the glass. He mouthed a "Thank you" and Dean saw the most sincere gratefulness in those pretty blue eyes. Then, he held the phone to his ear and, with one last look to the cleaner, he had to leave his office.
Windexer's left hand slid out of his pocket, holding onto something that he tapped on the window to attract his prey's attention, but to no avail. Castiel's mind was gone, invaded by visions of all the things he wanted to do to that man outside. The cleaner repeated his gesture, tapping the item louder on the glass until the CEO looked at it, squinting his eyes that widened again the instant he understood what it was. A remote. For a vibrator.
Dean had a sincere laugh and simply shrugged, making a face that clearly meant he didn't care much. The time he just spent on floor 16 had been too pleasant to let minor concerns get to him. He opened the memo app on his own cellular and typed a response.
"Glad i could help, sir." said Dean, absent mindedly running his fingers along his collarbone, feeling his skin tingle.
By the way, i just want to sincerely thank everybody who's reading this story, gave it kudos or bookmarked it. I'm very grateful, you know ? I wrote this just for my personal fun, and i know it's not the most amazing thing ever, so i'm very thankful to know some people found it interesting ! Thanks x 100 for the support, really !
"You said you had something important to show me ? Wait -" She asked before widening her eyes. She looked around the van's compartment. "You're not going to show me your junk, are you ? Where is the hidden camera ?"
He slapped his palm on the glass out of frustration. Silly him, feeling jealous of a hand he wanted to replace with his lips, just to be the one to cause that lovely reaction.
He was quick to abandon all hope when he parked, though : all the lights of the Clevedale Building were out. There was no one there anymore. He mumbled to himself all the way from his parking spot to the service elevator, and up to the roof where he got to his platform and went four stories down. When he arrived at the picture windows he knew by heart by now, a mixture of good memories and bitterness had a little fight in his head. Yeah, the guy was hot as hell but come on, what was his friggin' deal, making the cleaner come back that late on a friday ? Ah, maybe it wasn't him who called. Dean was unfair and was perhaps to quick with his assumptions... Whatever. He was just going to give those stupid panes a quick rub, since they had been cleaned yesterday, it should be enough. The quicker he'd start, the sooner he'd be done with it.
Dean got his phone out to check the time. He had to take his lunch break, then he'd get to head for the businessman's building, sweet...  He resisted yet again the temptation to google the guy to maybe find his name, and he shoved his mobile back into his pocket before heading out to grab something to eat.
Today was different, it was the whole fucking three piece set. It was a dark, greyish blue and superbly tailored : flawless pants, white shirt, peacock blue tie, fitting jacket, and oh hell yeah, a tight buttoned up waistcoat underneath.
His eyes went half lidded. With a nod of his chin directed to the black waistcoat and shirt, he softly bit on his lower lip to signify how appetizing he thought his crush was. The latter had a confident smirk and mouthed "I know." before bringing his whisky glass to his lips for a sip.
"With the way you fucked me last night ? Damn straight i want it to be a thing. Us. To be a thing." Dean blushed, realising he was being maybe a bit too cavalier. "If, huh, if you want that as well."
"All clear. Now how about you get over here and finish what i'm starting ?" teased Dean as he pulled on a bow on the side of his panties, which began to untie them.
The boss had something more appetizing on the fire. He took the stairs two steps at a time, almost tripping on his way up.
The secretary let out an exagerated gasp of pretend outrage and gave a playful push to the mechanic's arm.
He ran a finger on his cum dripping lazily on the glass and brought it up to slowly wrap his sensual lips around it, all the while looking down at the cleaner with a hazy gaze laced with remanent lust.
"I was calling to let you know, Linda accomplished the mission you gave her with flying colors. She entrusted me yesterday with the hard drive you so bravely retrieved, and, thanks to you, Wingman Advertisement is safe."
His mind was set, and his heart a bit more hopeful. He wrote a memo for Ed to let him know about his decision and sat back, arms folded behind his head and legs crossed on his desk.
Outside, Dean couldn't help himself. When he saw the man inside slowly pull the zipper of his pants down, he got closer to the window almost unconsciously, as if he was pupeteered by a higher being. As a definitive evidence he indeed had cleaned those damn windows last tuesday, Dean, in his foolish attempt to get closer to the boss, bumped his body against the glass so transparent he forgot it was there. The cold surface did absolutely nothing to cool his burning skin down, and he powerlessly watched the CEO get his dick out of his pants. Dean's greedy tongue slid along his upper lip, his hungry eyes fixated on a cock he only dreamt about so far. He had red hot fantasies about that walking GQ cover of a man for the past two or three months, so of course he imagined him well hung, why the fuck wouldn't he ? And although his estimation wasn't too far from the real deal, he was absolutely pleased to remark the businessman was even thicker that he had thought.
"Wha-" said Castiel as he turned back in an unfortunate reflex. On the side table surrounded by two chairs and a couch, he swiftly grabbed a large vase holding a few orchids and held it in front of his crotch to hide the incriminating tenting going on down there.
So, as dull as his second job was, there was still that particular silver lining to enjoy ! And since today was thursday, he left the garage at noon with a warmer heart than he would on every other day : he was going to see that handsome guy again in the afternoon. Sweet.
He was tapping his hand on the metal railing in rythm to an old classic playing loud out of his earphones, their wire dangling in the wind and connecting to his mobile set to a rock radio. As much as a banger this song was, Dean still stopped nodding his head when he noticed something was off.
"Nah, don't worry about it. I did it out of goodness of heart, that's just my style. Helping people, stealing evidence... You know. Window cleaning business."
The man ended his conversation, and Dean mentally insulted himself : he should have been more reactive and get his mobile out to record the convesation ! Stupid ! He got lucky nonetheless, and his hopes surged when he saw the grifter stand up and go to a nearby safe to type a four numbers code on a pad. From the corner of the window, Dean watched him like a hawk. 1-2-7-2. The digits played on a loop in his head.
Maybe Porter had lacked vigilance and he usually wasn't that careless. Maybe this fateful thursday, yesterday, he had no other choice but to bring the drive to work. Maybe he felt he was so close, he got overly confident.
He was tall and seemed well built, and although the grey coveralls weren't all that flattering at first glance, they couldn't hide the broadness of his shoulders. Since the sleeves were rolled up to the elbows, his strong forearms and the muscles rolling under them were visible. His features were nothing to scoff at either : enticing full lips, a delighfully square jaw, high cheekbones, a cute nose, all of those combined harmoniously in a handsome face crowned by a studied mess of short, dirty blond hair that gave the man a boyish charm.
"No. Shut up. I'm not done. The evidence will be admissible, so you better start to lawyer up. I am going to sue you for all you're worth. And do you know what else i am going to do, Ed ?"
He shook his head quick to snap out of his trance and got to work. The creaking of his squeege on the wet window made the three people in the office turn his head towards him. When they saw what caused the noise, only his crush took a little bit longer than the two others to look back at the laptop. This made Dean's lip curl up in a slight smile.
Outside, Dean felt his heart melt when the businessman gave him the most endearing smile he'd ever seen. There was no awkwardness, just a gratitude so genuine the cleaner couldn't help but grin just as much. Then, his crush got his phone out and quickly typed a note before showing it to him
He got up and grabbed his jeans to put them on while his belly let out a threatening rumble. Oh yeah, they forgot to eat yesterday !
"Oh ! Perfect ! Do you mind giving me names," said the accountant as he got a tablet out and was ready to type down. "I'm going to work on their severance pay asap."
"I covered my tracks, falsified the books i cooked, sent the money offshore... After Wingman's down, we'll just have to lay low and bam. Vacation in the sun for you and me, baby."
"No, no no, that loser trusts me way too much. Either that or he's just too stupid to see i'm bleeding him dry !" The guy had a sharp laugh, and Dean's jaws clenched.
Maybe he should give it all up. Just bail outta here, sell his house and escape to an island in the sun where he'd do nothing all day... And perhaps he'd ask Windexer to come with him... Wouldn't that boy look good with a tan...
He always had a thing for formal wear. He wasn't sure why exactly, maybe it was the luxury of it, or the allure it gave to men... Whatever the reason was, he always had been instantly turned on by handsome guys in suit. His crush already dressed rather well every thursday he'd seen him before, but it was only pants and shirt and sometimes a tie.
Another blink, a quicker one this time, to remind him that there was a world outside the pie-laden dream in his head, and Castiel opened his blue eyes a bit wider before darting his hand to press the button on the intercom.
The calm and professional facade had cracked and Dean got to see another aspect of that man, more passionate. He saw those gorgeous eyes lit up with lust, he noticed the need in his gaze and the tent in his pants. And he had loved every second of it.
And when the windowcleaner gave him a warm smile and a cheeky wink, Castiel's head snapped back so hard towards his paperwork he almost got whiplash. His eyes darted around the page in a panicked frenzy. His shaky hand pretended to write some gibberish on a post it note. In a traitorous giveaway, the tender rosy shade of desire across his cheeks and ears deepened, taking the more reddish hue of unadultered shame.
A bit dizzy from the fall, he clumsily waded his way trough garbage. He reached for the rim of the bin and groaned when he hoisted himself out of it. Considering himself safe - for now -, he looked up at his appartment as a satisfied smile stretched his lips.
Deciding it was time to reward his patient lover, Dean was the first one to set things in motion. Clenching his ass just a bit more to squeeze that poor cock in its velvet vice, he smoothly rolled his hips, keeping things slow and easy.
The man's hand came down and hit... The shoulder ? Limply, too, not stinging one bit. Puzzled, Dean counted "One... ?" nonetheless.
In an attempt to make herself useful, she eventually got out to make him a nice cup of coffee. When she came back, she found him with his elbows on his desk and his face burried in his hand.
Just watching that handsome devil stroking his tantalizing hard cock wasn't enough anymore. With a shaky hand, he pulled down on his coveralls and boxers to free his own erection. But, as soon as his fingers wrapped over it, the CEO slapped his big hand on the window. A startled Deans' heart fluttered when he took in the other man's features.
"Er- Winchester." Said Dean, keeping the playing field even and giving as much information as he just received.
Fortunately, it stayed unlocked, and Dean heard the sound of a door opening and closing. He carefully risked a glance inside to confirm the office was empty. He had a long sigh of relief that seemed to unlock his whole body from its tensed state. He still had to stay alert, though, no time for slacking !
Edward felt his legs tremble and almost give in under him. Still trying to preserve what little dignity he had left, he nervously cleared his throat and tried to stand straighter. He had no clever retort, no threats to utter, no apologies to murmur. His mind was blank and he only wanted to escape the stifling lead weight of the office's atmosphere. He opened the door and left.
Still smiling and proud of the joke he told to the graphic designer he was talking with, Porter stopped his conversation and passed through the door the CEO had kept open. Before closing it, Castiel saw Linda staring intensely at him from behind the various, cute potted plants she had on her desk. She seemed so tense yet so full of resolve, her teeth were nervously gnawing at her bottom lip. She nodded at him before mouthing a "Get him, boss !"
Dean stepped in and stood a foot away from Castiel. There was just a few seconds of silence neither of them found awkward, too busy grinning blissfully and looking in each other's eyes. The blonde was the first to break the soft quietness to compliment the boss' suit, the fully black one, which was well on its way to become Dean's favorite. The jacket was absent, the shirt's sleeves were rolled up, the collar had a button off and the tie had been losened, just like he liked it.
"Which one, i give so many good ones." Porter jested, letting out a nervous laugh that died out when he saw the cheerful display wasn't reciprocated in the least.
He amped up both the speed of his strokes along his cock, and the naughty sextoy inside Windexer, whose back arched in delight, his torso pressing against the glass in the process. His gaze blurried and got lost for a second as he was adjusting to the new speed. Castiel had a growl of frustration and got off his chair. From here, he could not see all the little nuances and quivers, nor could he hear the sounds if there was any. He got up and walked closer.
Lost in questions that slowly grew dirtier as he was vaguely rubbing his chamois on an already clean spot, Dean didn't notice the very discrete glances his crush took at him from time to time. Eventually, he stood up and bent down to point at some data on the screen. His jacket rode up just enough, his pants stretched out over his rear end.
Do you have any interesting prompts you'd like to share with me ? Let me know ! I like working on prompts sometimes (i mean, it seems obvious, seeing how the base idea for this fic was a tumblr prompt lol).
Castiel stayed caring and devoted to his lover's pleasure, worshipping his skin with caressing strokes and delicate kisses. Again, it was Dean who decided when he wanted things to amp up, and his hips picked up the pace as his breathing quickened. Much to the cleaner's delight, Cas followed, and his lazy thrusts started to gain in speed and force. He knelt up a tad, wanting to give Dean's chest some space, but also to have a better access to Dean's poor neglected cock. He took a hold of it and stroked it in rythm. Meanwhile, his other hand grabbed at his bed's headboard for proper support, also allowing him to have a better view of the handsome man sprawled under him.
With Steppenwolf's "Born to be Wild" blasting in his ears (and hopefully his crush's too, if he didn't get the wrong station), Dean popped up the collar of his coveralls in a cocky gesture and lipsynched flawlessly to the song. On the other side of the glass, his beloved businessman smiled so wide his white teeth showed, and he sat on the deep blue rug of his office to fully enjoy the performance. The worker spared no effort and gave it all, mouthing the words to a T, miming a wild ride on an invisible bike, playing some sick riffs on an air guitar and busting some dance moves. He went all the way, never stopping, never once giving a shit about the possibility of someone entering the office and seeing him silently rocking out to the song in their ears. The man inside showed no sign of annoyance or shame by proxy, quite the contrary : he was having a hella good time watching that awesome window cleaner giving his all, and he laughed heartily whenever Dean made a silly face.
Edward didn't try to defend himself anymore, seeing how his ruse was revealed. There was no backpedalling now, and he decided to play it more aggressively in the hopes of getting the CEO to back down.
With his blue eyes just a bit hazy and his mouth slightly agape, Castiel stared at the pretty boy oustide, lost in blissful contemplation. Suddenly, the object of his attention looked right back at him, and for a few fleeting seconds the boss looked like a rabbit caught in a car's headlights : frozen, tense, his pupils dilating a tad.
Outside, a dreamy smile never left Dean's lips as he took the service elevator all the way down and left to go to his van. He absolutely wasn't pissed anymore, how could he ? The little show up here had been a very nice conclusion to this day, and a peaceful weekend was ahead of him.
Should he have dressed more formally ? He was wearing a simple jean, a grey t shirt, and a slate blue flannel, all clean. Only his old, battered jacket was in a less pristine state, but he had that sturdy thing for so long, it was like he didn't notice its flaws anymore. Dammit, Mr Novak was probaly gonna wear a suit, maybe Dean should have made an effort... Whatever, it was too late to cry over spilt milk. He rubbed his moistening hand on his jeans and pressed the doorbell's button. A pleasant chime echoed inside, and his host opened the front door a few seconds after.
The swear word was uttered through gritted teeth in a hissy whisper. Dean jumped out of his battered couch and swiftly tip toed to the window of his kitchen to take a look at the alleyway two stories below. Ok. Perfect. The large bin was full. Meanwhile, the dreaded sound of heels on parquet floor was growing nearer and approaching his appartment. He was running out of time, he had to act now.
"Very well." She got out and turned to Dean. The gratitude in her eyes was undeniable. "Thank you so much, Mr Winchester."
Outside, Dean whispered a "Yeah Daddy, take it off..." to himself. He watched the man turn to hang his jacket and appreciated the satin sheen of the back of that tight waistcoat, like a raven's plumage. His crush was a vision in black, a dominating presence that Dean admired as much as he desired right now. When the boss loosened his tie, opened a button of his collar and undid  the cuff links on his sleeves to roll them up to his elbows, the cleaner felt a rush of warmth flowing through his body. If he was inside that room, he would absolutely bend over the desk and beg that man to ravish him. The CEO then sat on the chair with such poise, looking like a king on a throne.
Inside, Castiel didn't move either. He too was basking in bliss and didn't want that moment to end too abruptly. He just saw that gorgeous adonis outside reach his orgasm, the vision was still burning in his brain and he hoped that it would never leave, that it would be in his dreams every night. He eventually readjusted his cock in his pants and bent down to grab the remote to stop the vibrator's devilish jig.
He wasn't a man of privations and always prefered treating himself, because life was too short to save money and not spend it on stuff.
He grabbed his bag and put his shoes on, nearly losing his balance in the process. He still bumped his elbow in a coffee mug left on his counter but, quick as lightning, he managed to catch it before it had the chance to smash on the floor and make a noise.
Porter had never, ever seen Mr Novak like this. For as long as he knew that man, he always saw him so poised and kind to a fault, a fault that the accountant exploited to its fullest. But the person in front of him right now was almost someone completely different. His eyes seemed darker and lit up by flames of anger, his tone was growing more threatening by the second, and there was an aura of power and wrath to him... So much so that, even though Ed was taller in size than Mr Novak, the man had such an imposing and dangerous presence, the accountant felt smaller than he ever been. He stepped back. Castiel only stepped closer and left no room for Porter to breathe. He felt trapped.
"I've noticed you were particularly fond of those." Replied Castiel, his tongue poking out to wet his lips he felt were going dry. "Personally, i was starting to think your wardrobe consisted only of grey coveralls."
Welp, we're done here, friend. Hope you enjoyed this chapter ! I must leave you on a sadder note, though : the last chapter is very short, as it will be a nice little epilogue to tie that silly fic up with a cute little bow. But, maybe i'll add some contents in a tenth chapters ? Like sketches or drawing... I'll see ! Meanwhile, have a nice day or night, and don't forget to stay hydrated !
"The window cleaner ? M- uh- the one who comes on thursdays ?" Said Cas, glad he got able to swallow back the 'My' he had started to let slip.
The cleaner hesitantly got the usb drive out and held it to the secretary as he related the accountant's phone conversation, and his foolish stunt to get the evidence out of the safe.
Dean set his own palm over the spot where his crush's hand had been. With a pleased sigh, he bent to grab his gear and finally worked at those windows. They weren't going to clean themselves after all.
Castiel stretched wide in his king size bed and sat up, ignoring the obnoxious tent his erection was forming under the sheets. Bad news, he had a meeting with his accountant this afternoon. The latest report showed an increase in company losses, and it started to be serious. Good news, today was thursday, so even if his accountant ended up ripping him a new one, he would find comfort in a visit of his favorite window cleaner.
Castiel cleared his throat, regaining his usual composure. "Everything's fine, Linda. I was moving some furniture and i dropped something. Thank you for your concern, the cleaner was just pranking you, i'm sure."
The silence, so conductive to daydreams, came back in his office and Castiel's gaze laid down on what caused his mind to drift away. After a few paragraphs detailing the monthly income were four pie charts, mostly bearer of bad news, which was probably why Mr Novak's brain chose an easy way out and prefered to conjure sweet images of other, more delicious variants of pies.
The cleaner had a little gasp and ducked out of sight when the accountant turned to face the window. From where he was standing, the bastard could only see the blue sky and the bustling city skyline. The platform, its solid wires and its cleaner were out of the frame. Luckily, the man didn't move and simply whistled a happy tune, unaware of the amateur spy who was crouching under the window and who was hoping so hard the swindler wouldn't lean on the sill to enjoy the breeze.
When he was younger and barely started his company, he had struggled with self esteem. He eventually discovered some truth to the saying "clothes makes the man". Dressing sharp made others look at him differently and take him more seriously. It helped him to build enough confidence and not feel like an impostor that had no right or qualification to be a CEO. The years had passed, and he could now run that company in a clown costume if he really wanted it : the man didn't need the clothes to make him anymore. Most of the time, he'd roll with a basic suit and an old tie. But on some days, he would rock the three piece like it was nobody's business... Especially since he noticed it made a certain cleaner all hot and bothered.
His admiration was interupted when his skilful lover angled his hips just right and hit that spot again after a particularly good thrust. Dean inhaled sharply and his body jolted as he let out a cry of his man's name.
He mouthed a "You ok ?", to which the businessman responded with a nod and a strained grin that felt so forced it hurt.
Linda rolled her pretty eyes and got her mobile out. A few quick taps, and the chime of Castiel's text notification resounded in the office.
"Put it on ! Put that radio on !" Screamed Dean in pure excitement. His crush raised his eyebrows but still played along. The cleaner watched him get his phone out, plug headphones in, and give a few swipes and taps. As soon as the man showed his screen and raised his lovely eyes to give him an inquisitive look, Dean kept the show going. He kept it going hard.
Dean saw her as she got out of the service door. Her heels clicked on the concrete as she trotted to the van, and Dean leaned to open the passenger side door to her. The vehicle bounced and creaked as she sat on the battered seat and slammed the door shut.
Tomorrow. Cross his heart, tomorrow he was going to call his savior to thank him properly, and possibly offer him a reward.
So, yes, money was tight sometimes, but he managed. He always kept a positive outlook, or at least tried to. He was in good health, had a roof over his head (for now...), and lived his life how he pleased.
He got to his desk, seated a bit more uptight than usual, and tried to dive right back into those boring numbers and statistics. A quick side eye and the faint noise of a squeege rubbing on glass informed him that the man outside had stopped looking at him and was now at work, probably whistling, judging by the o shape of his lips.
The CEO repeated it, lower, almost like a growl. Dean held back a moan as he swooned, his body shuddering softly.
The man turned on his chair slightly. Dean saw the long neck and aquiline nose that gave him the looks of a vulture wearing a human costume. He was holding a usb drive, its black plastic shell reflecting the afternoon sun briefly.
Too bad the guy wasn't alone, though. Albeit with glass panes between them, there had been a sort of progress every time they'd seen each other. The man inside had seemed less and less self conscious and had welcomed Dean's winks or gestures by smiling fondly rather than looking away. He even responded accordingly sometimes, by waving or mouthing a "what's up ?"
Once he was done with the boss' office, he moved his platform along the wall to work on the long, lateral row of smaller windows connecting to other rooms of the floor. He washed those one after the other, his head empty, focusing on the music in his earplugs. He pulled them out of his ears a little while later when he noticed the seventh window was opened. He was about to politely ask the guy inside if he could close it to clean it, when he heard him converse on the phone.
Staying shirtless and barefoot, he got out of the bedroom and found himself a bit lost in that luminous house that felt even bigger now that he could see all the windows to the outside, letting out so much daylight. As he got down the stairs, he snorted when he saw his t shirt still here on one step, and his scattered socks and shoes near the entrance. With the intention to pick that up later - too lazy and too sore to bend, man ? Come on. -, he made his way through the living room, the sole of his feet brushing on the smooth parquet flooring, before noticing the kitchen not too far away. His belly growled more furiously, but Dean ignored it, wanting to be polite and ask before helping himself to some food. If he could just find his host...
It had been a month or so they first "met", yet they didn't talk once. Mainly because the imposing picture windows were soundproof and couldn't be opened, but also because Dean didn't feel the need to. Not yet at least. It simply was something nice, a delightful exchange that didn't really need words for now. They just shared shy glances that sometimes shifted to seductive, and endearing smiles that could get a hint of lust to them sometimes. It was a little game of seduction that made thursdays less boring.
Dean's brows furrowed and he listened to the sudden instinct telling him to hide. He silently stepped aside on the platform to disappear from the window frame as he kept eavesdropping.
Oh how Dean wished he could move through solid matter just to get in that office and give a warm hug to him... But, although he lacked that superpower, he still wasn't completely powerless. He was gonna give another type of show to his crush and kick his sadness' sorry ass.
He got home and settled in his couch before turning his tv on. "Awesome !" He exclaimed as he unwrapped what was in the bag. Guilty of a little prejudice, he had expected the food in there to maybe be a bit too fancy, not sure if Wingman's CEO had a taste for more refined things. When he bit down on one of the two copious burgers, Dean groaned in happiness as his eyes rolled up to the heavens. The fries happened to be just as good, the side of onion rings were a perfect addition, and the pie for dessert looked to die for.
Dean kicked off his shoes and ran up the stairs like a bat out of hell, abandoning his t shirt on a step. Castiel shoved a hand in his tight pants to adjust his painful erection as he awkwardly trotted to his kitchen to stop the oven. The baked potatoes inside were gonna have to wait, so did the top quality sirloin steaks sitting on a plate, lingering to be grilled.
As his platform made its way down from floor 17 to 16, Dean wondered if his crush had anything in store for him today. Could he even top the cleaner's obscene display from last week ? Dean doubted it, but he was sure eager to see him try...
"Umpf. It's fine, i suppose." She huffed, no doubt realising she was foolish to hold a grudge, and getting all up in the mechanic's face wasn't very civil. "There was no real harm done but you have to understand, my boss was going through a rough patch -he still is, mind you- and i took your warning call seriously !"
Without noticing, Dean had seated on the metal railing of his platform and was absentmindedly running his finger along his collarbone, the digit sometimes slipping under the hem of his coveralls in the process. He was fucking gawking at that handsome devil inside, who was currently showing some powerpoint presentation to two people, a man and a woman sitting on the chairs facing his desk. Nobody had noticed the slacking cleaner outside yet, and if Dean didn't want to look stupid, he'd better stop his ogling right now.
Come back tomorrow for another chapter, ok buddy ? Meanwhile, take care, dance to your favorite track, and have a nice day or night ! Buh-bye !
Dean laughed and smiled fondly, his tense grip around the paper bag finally relaxing. This was enough of a denouement for the delivery man, who walked back to his moped.
But today, Dean's crush couldn't really communicate with him since he was busy with whoever the two persons were. Bah. There would be other thursdays...
"Nah, you didn't. Someone else did, for you. I got the right adress, you match the description my boss gave me, that's all i need."
Cas kept his fiery stare on poor Dean, wanting to see every little changes in his expression. As much as he wanted to get down to brass tacks as soon as possible and get his dick burried deep down in here to make that handsome boy cry out his name, he also never underestimated the importance of preparation. How enjoyable would all this be, if he ended up hurting his lover by being to hasty ?  So, he took his sweet time, finding his own pleasure in Dean's, loving what sounds and shivers he was already coaxing out of him.
He was surely thankful to Windexer and his immense efforts to make him smile last week. The man had seen him vulnerable and defeated by the slow decline of his company, yet he didn't mock him. But on the other hand, Castiel didn't forget the cleaner's other lewd display either ! He wanted to cast his worries aside for just a moment and resume their little game where they'd left it. It was something that had brought him joy and fun, and he needed to keep it going a little further, for a little longer.
Castiel felt invicible. From the moment he had sacked Porter, this feeling of victory never left him, and it was still continuing now as he entered his house. He went to his living room, put on a swingy jazz record and went to his bar to treat himself with a glass of his best whisky. He sat comfortably on his couch and hummed to the music, savoring this lovely moment.
"Really ???" Castiel said, maybe a bit too enthusiastic. "... Really ? Good. Thank him for me, would you ?"
After a minute or two of being the only one to treat himself, soft hearted Castiel gave in to Windexer's avid stare. When the cleaner made another shy attempt to palm at his cock, he encouraged him with a nod.
"I've decided to follow your advice, Ed." Castiel said, seating on the side of his desk while his accountant chose one of the two seats that faced it.
Still distracted, Castiel uselessly nodded before adding a necessary "Yes, thank you" to his head gesture that couldn't be seen by his employee.
"More." Dean purred, insatiable, which caused Cas' eyes to open wider in a slight panick as he wasn't sure he had it in him to instantly go for round two.
Castiel, still unsure of all of this was about, squinted at the screen and started opening files to read them. It took him several minutes to go through the incriminating data. Linda stayed by his side, tweaking nervously at her hand as she watched her boss' expression change from puzzled to defeated to angry, sometimes hearing him whisper a "Unvelievable..."
The boss gave slow strokes on his length from tip to base and let his head lull back as his eyelids fluttered. Dean muffled a moan. He could have sworn he saw the guy mouth a "Fffuck" and he wasn't able to hear it, when he'd been dying to know how he sounds. That handsome bastard was killing him.
"Yes ! Yes, sir !" Mewled Dean, going insane with lust. In addition to everything else, his lover's voice was just what he needed to get over the edge.
In one swift and precise move, he spun the blond around, sat on the bed, and got him to lay belly down across his lap. Dean blinked in surprise, things happened so quick, one moment he had a hard crotch grinding over his, the next he was bent over firm thighs with his ass up, what-
As he left the warehouse, he noticed a moped had arrived in the parking lot, probably while he was changing his clothes from coveralls to casual. The two-wheeler's colors matched its driver jacket and helmet, making Dean think someone had ordered food, but this made no sense, he was the last one leaving the place.
"Now, if you would be so kind, get the fuck out of my sight before i slam your face into my desk in lieu of a severance pay."
The elevator door opened with a 'ding', interrupting Castiel's reverie. He stepped out and walked along the open space where most of the creative team worked. There was no one there. It was late, they were all done for the day, and Cas was too, he just had to come back to get his briefcase before heading home.
He should really find another nickname for the guy, "Windexer" wasn't the most flattering monicker, but neither was "Hotstuff McWindows". He could simply ask him for his name, too, but... He didn't want to.
If that wasn't the prettiest, firmest ass he'd ever seen, he didn't know what was. Those tailored pants were complimenting it perfectly and left the window cleaner hungry for more. Inside, the man shifted his weight from his left foot to the right, making that butt roll slightly. Dean swallowed a whimper as a flurry of obscene interrogations filled his poor, horny brain to the brim.
Like a godsend reward to his voluntary sacrifice, who came along at that moment ? Why, Windexer, of course.
Said crush finally decided to be generous. Dean, so focused on the action, didn't notice the man's thumb pressing a button on the remote. He sure felt it, though. Inside him, the vibrator hummed slowly and made him gasp, his erection pulsing in his boxers.
They stayed that way for long, sensual minutes, simply loving their languorous pace. At this perfect moment, the lusty playfulness that motivated their first encounters made way for something deeper, something sweeter, as they were softly falling in love without even realising it.
Dean's hands went on Castiel's stubbly cheeks. Castiel's hands grabbed Dean's hips. Their lips pressed in a sensual kiss, a grandiose reward for them both. It started chaste, as they were discovering each other in a new way. The scratch of the boss' stubble on Dean's hand, how firm Cas found the cleaner's hips, how soft their lips felt caressing one another. But soon enough, the kiss became more feverish, and a certain urgency took over them as they both needed more. Castiel turned on the side to pin the cleaner's back on the wall and press his body against his. Their crotch squeezed together, and Dean immediately rolled his hips, eliciting a groan from the other man. The latter broke the kiss to latch his mouth on a neck he'd been dying to taste. His teeth sunk harmlessly in the sensitive skin and Dean's arms wrapped around his crush's neck as he moaned "Castiel" in delight. No matter how Cas had fantasized about that word said in that tone, it wasn't even close to the real thing. It fueled his desire even further and he replied in the same fashion :
He grabbed a fluffly pillow to stick it under his lover's backside to prop it up and sat on his heels right behind it. His hand guided its length until the tip pressed against Dean's needy hole, feeling it flutter.
He was just slightly annoyed at himself for being not daring enough. He should have asked Mr Novak to talk dirty to him with that husky voice of his. He was pretty sure he would have happily complied. Hell, the man didn't hesitate to jerk off in front of him last time, their little game had them throw decency to the wind for a while now !
"Mine are in the second drawer." Said Cas, watching the other man lean to open said drawer to have a quick peek at the paper. At least that was settled, and the reward for that minor delay was absolutely worth it.
"I get that." Said Dean, patting her on the shoulder politely. "Look, don't worry too much. I don't know your boss that well but, the way you talk about him, he sure sounds like he's gonna fix it." He plastered a hopeful grin on his lips to try and raise the poor little miss' morale. There was something deeply heartwarming with Dean, his cheerfulness always was communicative. She brightened up and smiled gratefully, allowing adorable dimples to softly crease her cheeks.
He crouched to his bag to look for something that seemed well hidden, and finally held up a small tube of lubricant in one hand, and the incriminating object in the other. Castiel had expected the vibrator to be white, but it was the same shade of pink as the buttons on the matching remote. It was neither long nor big, which was probably the point : it looked like it had to be inserted entirely, and it had a loop of string attached to it for a more practical removal.
Since he felt so confident, wasn't it the perfect time to do something he postponed yesterday out of nervousness ?
Dean took in the scene at first. So far he only had known this office in the daytime. Seeing it lit up offered another perspective. Instead of cold neon tubes you'd see in most workplaces, the lights here had a warmer glow, giving a more intimate and welcoming feel to the room. They reflected on the furniture's palisander wood, giving it a rich caramel tone. The walls that appeared ecru white in the afternoon now had a more cosier, creamier tint.
"The one about laying people off." Answered the boss, his jaws still clenched as he resisted the urge to kick that scumbag in the chin.
Behind the glass, Windexer savored his victory, bathing in the CEO's priceless reactions, and whose desire was almost palpable from here. The vibrator's remote was shoved back in his pocket and he took out his phone instead. Still entranced, Castiel didn't understand the gesture. Why was he doint that ? Did he get his personal number ?? Was he going to call him for some steamy phonesex ??!? Jesus please-
Dean got up and let out a sharp cry of frustration and glared at the tire he was trying to change. If looks could kill, that rusty, stubborn nut on the rim that refused to unscrew would drop dead right now. In a petty gesture, Dean gave a last kick to the car and went to the coffee machine to take a 5 minutes break. On his way, he politely nodded to a client who was waiting for her car, and was surprised to see the rather hostile stink eye she gave him. It took him a few seconds to recognize the tiny brunette, bespectacled secretary he briefly saw once when she barged in his crush's office.
Charlie drew in a breath between her teeth, reaching out from beside Cas and laying a hand on his shoulder. “Woah… not good. Why do you think that?”
Except, you have no claim. I already know you've only been hanging onto me by a thread-- barely any grace...
Castiel turned his neck to watch the other boy step inside. “Do we? How did Ally Training go?” He closed his laptop, frowning slightly. Had something gone wrong?
would expected more just ‘well’. You were clinging to me the entire night. I know you do that when you’re feelin’ good.”
Resources that we've kind of just been hogging for ourselves. Maybe it's finally time for us to change that... to open our doors, a bit. Hell, we could even work on digitizing the archives, and...
