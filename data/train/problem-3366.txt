“I promise” That's all Cas had to say;
They all looked at him and raised their eyebrows, except Jack. Jack just smiled at him even wider.
“Blegh gross” Jack said scrunching up his face at the display of affection, Sam barked out a loud deep laugh as he started wheezing. Cas and Dean pulled away laughing, their hands still intertwined with each other.
They both just stood there for a few minutes both of them having tears streaming down their faces clinging onto each other as everything all the death, all the sacrifice slamming into them Castiel's death being the pushing point.
That's when they saw it, a news article and at first glance it was just any normal ghost hunt till they saw where it was.
There in perfect condition like nothing happened, Castiel and Jack stood in front of the Impala smiling at Dean and Sam and for a moment the world froze as the brothers processed what was happening. That moment didn’t last long as they were all walking to each other quickly going into a group hug, a bear hug, a family hug. They all stood there for a second than Dean and Cas broke off and Dean pulled Castiel to the side, Sam and Jack watching happily.
“I’m sorry to interrupt this moment but I believe we have unfinished business” That voice rang out clear and at first none of them pulled away too shocked at what they’re hearing cause certainly its not real, right?
Sam and Dean smiled as all 15 years worth of their work everything they’ve done seemed to come together. Worn out and beaten up they decided to go where it all started. Their first heart to heart if you will, and they went to the bridge.
“Yeah yeah kid, shut it” Dean said mockingly rolling his eyes,
Suddenly Sam was cut off by a sudden hug, Dean pulled him in tight and hugged as tears started to spill harder. Sam was startled at first and froze but eventually sighed sadly and hugged back as he understood what Dean needed.
“So did I, but Jack brought me back” Castiel reassured him, with a tone that makes it seem like Castiel himself was unsure whether this was real as well.
After days of researching, interviewing locals, and comedically reassuring the cops that “no officer I have never been here a day in my life”. They found out what exactly it is they were hunting, it was a ghost, specifically the ghost of a victim of the original woman in white case they worked here 15 years ago. He didn’t get to move on and killed any woman who looked remotely like Constance as a way of revenge for his death.
The brothers knew there was no body so they did what they thought would work, they lured him out and drove him right into the house that baby got rammed into. It was a long shot to begin with but the universe seemed to be on their side as the ghost of Constance appeared, happy with her children. She fixed her own doing and gave him peace by allowing him to ‘kill’ her. The boys watched as he did it, and when he didn’t feel better he just sobbed out in pain. That's when Constance came back and placed her hand on his shoulder and it was almost like he knew what she was thinking, he stood up and she pulled him into a hug both of them disappearing into a bright light a nostalgic puddle of water left where they were once standing.
“I miss him Sammy, I miss him so much” Dean croaked out realization hitting him like a bag of bricks,
But they both knew how the other one felt and the best thing they could do is be there for each other, and most importantly help them in any way they can whether it's an extra curly fry or two for Dean or the cups of water and towels by Sam's bed for those slow nights. They did what they always did and looked out for each other.
“Hey!” Dean said ready to throwdown with Jack.
Suddenly Sam called out Deans name, not even flinching Dean turned towards Sammy the one he always protected, all grown up his little baby brother the one he will probably protect to his last breath.
“Dean” Cas warned holding him back and Dean just sighed doing the ‘i’m watching you’ motion to Jack as Jack broke out in hysterics. Sam stifling his growing laughter at his immature brothers actions.
Dean was the first one to pull away, desperately searching for the owner of that voice and there he was. Dean stared at the two beings in front of him, both Sam and Dean cracked a smile as they all breathed out happily the family reuniting.
They parked Baby and leaned over the railing, watching the environment and feeling everything come crashing down. Dean sighed as tears started spilling out of his eyes his silent cry not going unheard as Sam looked over, sympathy and understanding in his eyes.
“Yes Dea-” Cas started but was quickly cut off when a pair of chapped lips hit his, he squawked in surprise but that only made Dean laugh into the sweet kiss. Castiel finally caught up and smiled as he sweetly kissed back.
“Nothing, lets go get some pie” Sam said with sibling endearment,
They always had a rule to never go to the same haunt twice but something drew them to it, maybe nostalgia or some sick twisted sense of being able to go back. Before all of this, when Sam was worrying about his interview and Dean was worrying about being lonely on the road, both of them were so painfully unaware about what was to come. When the only thing that they had to worry about was your run of the mill monsters and finding their dad. No god no devil no reviving mothers and profits and losing the love of your life. Just pure Hunt monsters. Find dad. Repeat cycle.
“And Cas one more thing” Dean said, a small smile playing on his lips as he tugged Castiel's hand, making him face him.
All that's left to do is go back to normal, god may have been killed with Jack taking his place. But Monsters are still here and active and people don’t save themselves, unless you're a Winchester of course. They did take a few days off to mourn their departed and come to terms with everything. Dean was just starting to understand and process his feelings then boom Castiel got taken away from him and that will leave a mark on him forever one that will haunt him forever. Sammy has to come to terms with Eileen being back and safe when he saw what has happened to her, how she looked and how he couldn’t be there to save her like Jess. Both the brothers needed a break and they did, they took their dog and impala and rode to the ocean where they stayed for a week or two and when they were ready they dropped the dog off at Jody’s and did what they always do, they got in their car and drove with one goal in mind saving lives.
Just as the light went back to black he thought,
“I'll do my best Sammy,” Dean offered, heart twisting at the mix of relief and pain in his brother’s expression, “If some big bad comes to my door though...”
“Yeah, yeah you already said.” Dean’s chest ached as he dragged Sam into the final hug of the day, wanting to pull him back into the car and drive away again, stop him from moving on without him. It was a ridiculous idea, one he knew wouldn’t be good for either of them if he acted on it- Sam had made it clear that he needed space away from Dean right now, because they would ‘fall into old habits’ and stay ‘stuck in a cycle of co-dependency’. Dean got it, he wouldn’t want to be held back by a clingy older brother if he had the chance for a new start either. They should have some distance.
Dean stretched his neck up and nuzzled into the junction of Cas's neck and jaw, kissing wetly and deliberately around that area until he found his pulse point against his lips.
“I’m so proud of you Sammy” Dean said gruffly, pulling his brother into a hug for the fifth time that day, having to stand a little on tiptoe because Sam was far too giant for regular people to be around.
thank you and I might put the next chapter up on wednesday bc I'm impatient.
- Dean finds it hard to accept Jack's potential non-binariness, resolved by the end of the chapter
“Of course, Dean.” He put his hand over Dean’s and gently removed it from his arm as Dean searched his face. He waited patiently until his brother blinked and nodded, expression moving from concern to amusement.
The angel looked up, finding Dean's eyes immediately in the darkness. Dean pushed his chair back from the table sideways so he was facing him with a loud, annoying squeal. He sat with his hands loose on his knees, his legs spread.
Dean scoffed, a cruel twist coming to his mouth. His eyes flicked over black for a second.
"Well, my apologies," Dean said, voice going warm like they're sharing a joke, "I'll have to try and be less distracting."
“Dude!” He hissed.
"We probably-" Dean's voice went hoarse halfway through the word so he cleared his throat, "we probably don't want that to go to waste. You know. Reduce, reuse, recycle and all that."
"It is stopping you." Cas pointed out, helpfully, and bit back a smile at Dean's growl. A few weeks ago he'd have been concerned about Dean in this state, but now he couldn't help but feel a thrill of excitement.
“Nice. Cool. Awesome.” Dean said nervously.
That didn’t stop them from holding tight in this last embrace though. They were both rather sniffley when they let go, patting each other hard on the back as they moved back from each other.
“What?” he said with a frown, eyebrows pulling together like magnets of confusion.
"Thank you Dean." He said, and that was all the warning he got before Cas leaned up and gave him a kiss swift on the cheek.
He must have manipulated his skin in some way, because it split easily under Dean's incisors and let out a gush of grace. It filled Dean's mouth immediately and he had to swallow several times in quick succession before breaking off to gasp a breath. Its taste seemed to change every time he was given it. This time it was warm and silky smooth, like sweet coffee on a Sunday morning. It warmed Dean throughout, and more than made up for the sliver of disappointment that this is what Cas meant by "getting some". That was washed away with the hazy giddy feeling that came with drinking from Cas.
Dean looked up at Cas through his lashes, expression soft. He linked his fingers with the hand on his shoulder, and brought it up to his mouth.
“You’re leaving?” Dean’s voice came out with a twist of longing that he really hoped only sounded obvious to his own ears. “Is that really what you want?”
They didn't get the chance to talk until late afternoon. Not talk properly, that is, mano-a-mano as it were. Jack was hanging off Cas's every word and Cas was indulging his endless curiosity. Dean spied on them while pretending to listen to music.
"Hey, Cas."
He breathed in. He was in the hotel. He was next to the love of his life. Dean's flannel was soft and warm against his bare chest. It was night. The call of Heaven is not for him.
“Right, yeah, obviously.” Dean stumbled over his words, finally finding the phone just as it stopped ringing. When Dean looked up from the small screen, Cas had gone. Dean snorted. “Fuckin’ angels.”
“I love you, Dean. I love you.”
The sounds of fighting made him look up, and Dean was there, machete in hand, kicking a vampire to the floor and slicing its head off, a wild joy in his face. The room had at least 4 other dead, headless bodies, the grey carpet staining with blood.
"I'm right here Dean. I will watch over you." Cas promised, and Dean nodded into his pillow, staring at Cas until his eyes slid shut.
"Uh, Cas? A little close there buddy." Dean said.
"Cas!"
(See the end of the chapter for
warnings: contains eating; (very brief) Hell mention; swearing
He wasmuch more lucid than he normally was at this stage. Perhaps that was a positive sign, that Dean was gaining resilience against the mark. These times together may draw to a close. Cas closed his eyes against the stab of dread that brought him, so was caught off guard when Dean's tongue licked into him. He doesn't
So why is he worrying enough to make himself sick?
” Leave it to Sammy to pick up on tiny details.
He’s not quite sure what he’s asking for at this point, but he knows Cas intends to ride that fine line between pain and pleasure. Damn if it wasn’t sexy and scary at the same time, but he’s Dean Fucking Winchester and he’ll take whatever Cas will give him, even if it’s too much.
“Dean.”
He knows that’s wrong, too.
“So desperate,” he rumbles. “And I’m just getting started.”
When did Dean start crying?
Castiel keeps going, increasing both the pace and the depth every few minutes until he’s fucking Dean’s mouth with abandon. Dean’s jaw aches, his lips are tender, tears prick at the corner of his eyes, and he loves every fucking minute of it.
Cas pulls out gently, turning Dean on his side and gathering him up in his arms in a warm, protective cocoon. Dean is on the edge of sleep when he feels Castiel bite the back of his neck and murmur, “You’re mine.”
“Wha - what?” Dean opened his eyes in confusion, his hands no longer on Cas' head, his cock no longer inside that gloriously hot mouth. Cas had disappeared.
And that will never go away, will it? Things can’t go back to the way they were now that Castiel knows, not really.
But Dean doesn’t give up, and Charlie doesn’t either.
“Dean, I think Sam was concerned that you’d panic if he asked you and you weren’t ready to talk about it,” Cas paused. “About us.”
But the other alternative? Leaving? Not seeing Dean every day. Never seeing him smile again. That...that hurts worse.
Dean went to the left, Sam to the right. When they found the girl, they’d regroup; same plan as always. Castiel had been called away for angel business, so they didn’t bother asking him to join since the two of them had handled way more in the past. Besides, it was only one witch.
“Please don’t leave,” Dean whispers. He turns to Castiel, eyes bloodshot and watery, vibrant in a way that’s equally beautiful and heartbreaking.
He’s sick of it.
Cas carried Dean up the stairs as if he was nothing more than a ragdoll. He kicked Dean’s bedroom door open, stepped inside, and then kicked it closed. He took three large strides then unceremoniously dropped Dean on the bed. Cas' mouth came down hard, working Dean’s lips until he moaned, opening his mouth for Cas' tongue. Dean grabbed at Cas' shirt, willing him to come closer. Cas' tongue pushed inside his mouth as the hand on Dean’s chest pushed him flat on his back.
════════════════════
They tied him up to a chair and he was sliced and diced right next to the girl. He doesn’t know how long he was out before Sam found them.
Castiel didn’t think it possible, but Dean looks even more wretched than before.
’ that falls from Dean’s lips when he joins them in the kitchen.
“Cas has got some moves, huh?” Sam asked as he pawed through the contents of the drawstring bag, sneaking curious glances at Dean.
Not easy, but easier.
He slumps down to the floor, one hand pressed to his chest, the other cradling his head as he lets the tears fall.
“You’re right you know, you do deserve better.”
Dean smirked.
Dean placed his weapons of choice on the bedside table before leaning over to give Cas a chaste kiss.
She tells him that they are ‘B-F-F’ now, whatever that means. He just nods because it’s easier that way.
“Go ahead and scream, Dean,” Cas goaded. “No one can hear you.”
Castiel’s eyes widened marginally as he lowered his burger and swallowed hard.
Cas' hands grabbed the back of Dean’s thighs and pushed his legs up and open, folding Dean up like an accordion. Cas sat up on his heels, adjusting the angle so that he hit Dean’s prostate repeatedly. He set a steady pace, bringing Dean closer to release with every thrust. Cas' cock sliding in and out of him felt like being jolted with electricity - first fire crackling in his veins then chills making his body shudder.
“Come for me, Dean.” Cas’s gravelly voice commanding in his ear sent him over the edge.
- insist -
Barbie, surprisingly, doesn’t jump to fill the silence.
Dean nodded. He didn’t like the sound of this.
Ken Doll finally notices Dean and turns toward him, his broad chest and shoulders just inches from Dean’s face, forcing him to look up at the man. He’s just as good looking as she is, now that Dean can unashamedly appreciate the male form.
Things are easier now.
It’s not a lie. He’s alone now, yeah, but he won’t be in another 45 minutes or so. He’s just passing the time, keeping an eye on the clock until his blue-eyed angel storms through the door.
Well, cat’s outta the bag now. He’ll deal with Sam later, but right now, he’s focused on Cas.
Reality is so much better. Cas pulled out the simple, black plug that he’d apparently been wearing all evening.
Under the table, Dean continued tormenting his lover. Cas was rock hard before Sammy even paused his monologue.
“Maybe I should just show you.”
“The bunker will always be your home, Cas,” Dean sighs. “The door is open if you — when you want to come back.”
Dean made sure Cas' car was stocked with supplies before sending Sammy on his way. He waited until the car was out of sight before taking off toward the garage. Baby was due for an oil change and damn if a sex bucket list was going to get in the way of his meticulous maintenance schedule.
Dean outright sobbed at Castiel’s proclamation, head hung between his forearms as his hands grasped fistfuls of sheets, knuckles turning white. His cock pulsed, producing a steady stream of precome on his swollen and sensitive head.
The Buckshot Inn is exactly what he expected, minus the empty room. Some tiny sliver of him had hoped that Dean would be waiting. But the only thing in the room is a musty double bed and misery.
When Dean locked them into his bedroom for the rest of the week, worshiping Castiel’s body, nipping and licking and kissing and — well, he wasn’t ready for that either.
He’s still not gotten used to it, being human.
Between the hot and cold sensation and the sensory deprivation, it was almost too much for Cas to handle.
They both pant with exertion, eyes locked on each other until Castiel reaches out to thumb across Dean’s cheekbone and down to his mouth, tugging his bottom lip from his teeth. The cum disappears from his face.
And he had to because Dean wouldn’t leave him alone for more than five minutes that first week.
“Purgatory,” Cas breathed, unsure of what to expect next. Dean kissed him again, loving the feeling of those full lips against his own.
Dean whined. He still wasn’t used to accepting Cas’ praise, especially not in a situation like this. It was too...intimate. Something Dean would probably never get used to, if he’s being honest.
Dean takes a deep breath as Castiel holds his.
. Being denied an orgasm when you’re
“Did you find anything out from the librarian?” Cas asked. Dean heard Sam’s muddled voice on the other end of the line.
Dean always knows.

His fingers clamp down on Dean’s jaw and chin, holding him in place while he strokes himself, grunting occasionally. He forces Dean to watch him masturbate literally right in front of him and it’s the hottest thing Dean’s ever seen.
“Oh, Dean! Please...I’m going to...
That’s definitely a new one.
Castiel deflates. There’s no other word for it. The fight leaves his body and it takes a considerable amount of energy for him to draw in a breath and tell Dean —
“Of course I do, Dean,” Cas murmured. “I just wasn’t sure how to bring it up and I wasn’t sure if you’d even want that.”
Sam understands anyway.
Cas whimpered when Dean’s fingers disappeared from his ass and his mouth pulled off his cock. But Dean wasn’t going to leave his angel hanging for long, he was just as ready.
He wears the jeans and button-down Dean bought him last month, runs a hand through his messy hair, wears boots instead of loafers, and pretends not to hear the soft ‘
Castiel didn’t even know those things until he’d voiced them, but it’s true nonetheless.
Anger and sadness he easily understood, the rest he couldn’t name.
Cas uses his silence and grabs him by the lapels to slam him into the nearest wall. A 1980’s era flower painting rattles somewhere near his head. Castiel crowds him, angled shoulders, hips and thighs pressing into every inch of Dean’s front.
“Yeah it’s good,” Dean replies. “But I think, uh, today will be our last session.”
“Just
Dean chuckled, then his expression turned serious as he gazed into Cas' eyes and whispered, “What do you want, Cas?”
With Cas’ shirt out of the way, Dean’s hands were free to skim up his sides, across his chest, over his shoulders. Dean loved the way that warm, powerful body felt under his calloused fingers. When the tips of his thumbs grazed over both nipples, Cas’ head fell back, a delicious sound escaping his mouth.
“Good, Dean.” Castiel tells him. “Now, grab my thumb with your left arm and pull down, keeping your elbows tucked in.”
“Cas, please, I wasn’t - ” Dean begins, ending on an exasperated note, “I was just talking to her Cas, I swear.”
Cas reached down and unbuttoned Dean’s jeans, stripping him in one quick movement. He tossed Dean’s clothes to the side and stood at the edge of the bed, staring down at him.
“Dean…”
But he can’t.
◷ ◷ ◷
He avoids Charlie for the first two days.
Dean licked the last crumbs away from his mouth and carried his plate over to the sink where Cas was washing dishes. The brothers told him, again and again, the purpose of having a dishwasher, but Cas said he enjoyed hand-washing everything, so they let him do it. Dean’s arms encircled Cas against the counter as he placed his plate in the sink. His lips hovered just above the angel’s neck.
“Cas, please!” Dean arched off the bed, causing Cas to hit his prostate with even more force on the next thrust.
Cas’s lips are dry, but full, and moving expertly in time with Dean's. Dean releases Castiel’s wrists so he can cup the angel’s cheek with one hand and run the other through that glorious sex hair Cas is always sporting. He tugs lightly and Cas moans. It makes Dean feel giddy.
Cas corkscrewed his finger in and out of Dean, sending waves of pleasure crashing through him. Dean had barely adjusted to one finger before Cas inserted another, stretching Dean open.
Castiel thinks he should be mad about that. It’s aggressive. Controlling. Demanding. Entitled.
But it’s hard to remain optimistic when Dean is sitting on his bed with his head hanging between his hands, not saying a word.
He shrugged, feigning nonchalance as he returned to his dinner preparation. Cas never opened his laptop. He watched Dean like a hawk while he ate, when he did the dishes, as he wiped down the counters. Dean could feel Cas' eyes following him around the kitchen. While he worked, Dean flexed his back and arm muscles for all he was worth, knowing Cas was a sucker for his shoulders.
Castiel was deep in thought, chewing unenthusiastically; a slight flush graced his cheeks. His gaze fixed on nothing in particular — a good sign that he was thinking pretty damn hard. That and the pinched lines of his forehead drawing into a thoughtful scowl.
They tell him that Charlie’s going to stay at the bunker with him.
Ignores the heat stirring in his veins every time they touch.
“I — is that — do other humans do that?”
body.
you.”
Sam glanced over his shoulder, face scrunched in confusion at the lack of heavenly wrath in the backseat.
Castiel knows she doesn’t believe him. “I’m fine” is one of the most used lies in the English language, he learned it from Dean after all, but he clearly needs work on the execution.
“I think that’s a great plan, Sammy,” Dean said, smiling. “Why don’t you go grab your bag and I’ll help you load up the car?”
. Tired is a new concept to him. He stays in bed for hours at a time, until Dean’s concerned knocking forces him to move around the bunker.
When his eyes finally refocus, Dean’s are cast downward as a frown tugs at his lips. Two seconds away from the heartbreak Castiel had experienced not two hours before.
“I — I’m fine.”
Leave it to Cas to hit the nail on the head, exposing Dean’s biggest fears in one fell swoop. Dean nodded once.
Dean began stroking himself eagerly, his right hand setting a decent pace that would get him to the finish line within a matter of minutes. His left hand curled underneath his ball sack, index finger circling his tight hole before making entry. He continued praying to Castiel as he jerked himself off, a mixture of unintelligible moaning, thoughts about Cas filling him up, ‘
They’ve never done this before, but Dean can guess what’s coming. He takes a deep breath through his nose and closes his eyes while he attempts to relax his throat. Castiel’s fingers weave into his hair and tug sharply before he slowly begins to work his hips back and forth, fucking Dean’s mouth slowly.
He’s only slightly surprised when Dean storms in, looking furious and frightened.
“I love you, Dean.”
“Oh my God,
She calls it “helpless.”
working
Eventually, waiting turns into pacing, which turns into nightmares.
“Oh my God,
What a sight they must make — Dean completely naked and flush to the wall with Cas still wearing most of his suit, his large, thick cock hanging out of the front of his pants, just waiting for Dean’s mouth. Perhaps it’s the sight of Cas looking so goddamn powerful (or the slight pressure on his shoulders) that makes Dean drop to his knees.
And Dean – stubborn, oblivious Dean – still didn’t move when Castiel wrapped his arms around Dean’s waist, pressed his lips to Dean’s ear and whispered: “Do you want to dance, Dean?”
For now.
“I love you, Dean, and I want to protect you,” Cas enunciated every word, willing Dean to understand how much the angel loved him. That's the second time he's said that and it's still not easy for Dean to hear or comprehend. “Why won’t you let me protect you?”
He sure wants to. Dean has watched Cas smite an entire army of demons, making heads roll and shredding bodies without so much as breaking a sweat. He’s thrown monsters across rooms and destroyed buildings. All of that angelic power on display...and not once has Cas rough-housed him in bed the way he truly wants.
“But I can’t let you walk out of here without telling you —”
════════════════════
“I think I, uh, misinterpreted your silence earlier...I thought….” Dean waved a hand and trailed off, not sure he even wanted to speak the rest of that sentence out loud.
“Cas?”
Simple things. Breathing, digesting, blinking, all the natural happenings he never allowed himself to feel when Jimmy’s body was just a vessel. Never had to.
But he’s trying.
Dean nods. He doesn’t trust his voice at the moment.
Dean blanches at that. Sam’s tone and choice of words…
Light grey like Sam’s jacket. Like that spaceship in the TV show he watches with Dean. The little pieces in the game that makes Sam laugh when Dean angrily throws paper money in his face.
. Once, just once, Dean wants to be manhandled with all of the strength his angel possesses. He’s dreamed about it Chuck knows how many times and it’s sexy as fuck.
Sammy stirred in the passenger seat. “Are we almost to the motel?”
Maybe it was the way the soft light from the window played on Cas' face or the residual fire in his eyes from the bathroom outburst. Maybe it was just because Dean couldn’t keep his hands to himself. He stepped up to Cas with a somewhat apologetic look and gave him a chaste kiss before nuzzling and kissing along his strong jaw. He heard a sharp intake of breath when his teeth nibbled on Cas' earlobe. He smiled, knowing Cas enjoyed it when Dean focused on his neck and ears. Dean’s tongue flicked out, wetting Cas' earlobe before his warm breath sent shivers down the angel’s spine as he whispered, “You’re so gorgeous, Cas.”
And he was wrong, it wasn’t two credit cards Dean left on the bar. It was a credit card and a motel room key. He’s not sure what to make of that.
He closed his eyes as his hands trailed up and down his chest, paying special attention to his tightening nipples. He wasn’t sure if it would work, but he focused on sending Cas a mental image of his steadily hardening erection.
She finally breaks him a little after 10.
“Dean?”
A work of art.
Almost.
Cas, fuck fuck
════════════════════
Cas’s hands, now free to roam, grabbed Dean’s biceps and pulled him down for a desperate kiss. Dean’s tongue worked into Castiel’s mouth, teeth nipping at the angel’s full lower lip until Cas was moaning into his mouth. Dean pumped in and out of Castiel slowly, taking his time building up their release.
“Yeah, he’s uh…” Dean was surprised at the huskiness of his own voice. He cleared his throat and tried again. “He’s, uh, really good.”
Dean is officially confused.
“Cas?” Dean asked tentatively.
“Cas,” Dean whispers, voice choked up in a way Castiel has never heard before and never wants to hear again. “I meant what I said. If you — if you want to leave, I’m not going to stop you.”
It still hurts.
, man.”
If Castiel pictured it, Sam’s space would be filled with books and knowledge, bravery and honor. Plaid.
Cas' arms framed Dean in the doorway as he crowded his space and growled, “We are not done here,” before flapping away to answer his cell. Dean’s efforts must be making Cas a little more hot and bothered than he realized. Perhaps he should tone it down or they won’t even make it past dinner.
When he broke apart from Cas and stood back panting, he was pleasantly surprised at the results. Cas' hair stuck up on ends, his lips were swollen and red, and his eyes were wide in a daze. The angel was equal parts confused, aroused and irritated, leaving him speechless. All of which elicited a chuckle from Dean.
Cas' mouth pulled off Dean’s cock with an obscene pop as his fingers withdrew from Dean’s stretched hole. Dean groaned, feeling empty without Cas' fingers and mouth teasing him.
He’s never felt more exhausted or more loved.
“Dean.”
...and Dean exasperated and running a hand through his hair with the other on his hip.
Dean doesn’t leave his room and Castiel doesn’t leave his either.
If Sam noticed Cas' attention wavering, he never said a word. He continued yammering about books and symbols and Chuck knows what else, giving Dean time to plant kisses down Cas' neck until reaching that ultra-sensitive patch of skin between his neck and collarbone. This wasn’t meant to be a continuation of Dean’s teasing, it was just a quick show of affection as a peace offering, but apparently, Cas didn’t see it that way. Before he could mark the angel’s neck, Dean was wrapped in a tight embrace and spun around, back slammed against the kitchen counter.
Dean chewed on his lower lip, gathering up the courage to actually voice his feelings for once in a goddamn while. That earlier fear and ache he felt in his chest spurred him to continue.
Her smile, her jokes, her willful optimism despite the darkness that polluted the bunker — it was easy to see why they wanted her there, why they called her to begin with. Sam was excited, ‘like an overgrown puppy’ Dean had said, and even the eldest Winchester seemed lighter somehow.
He knows the Winchester brothers have a solid plan and they’ll both be fine.
They all came zinging in at once, bowling him over like an invisible force. Everything snapped into existence and he wasn’t ready for it.
“Good job, Dean.”
Dean’s rumbling voice had filtered through the phone with an easy “Heya, Cas.”
“He, uh, flapped out of here like 5 minutes ago,” Dean answered, trying to hide his disappointment. “I think he went ahead to the motel.”
That night, he was patient and gentle. Well, as patient and gentle as he could be considering how, after that first kiss, him and Cas started going at it like the touch-starved men that they were.
“Cas, fuck, move already!”
Sans grace.
Just thinking about it has him a little hot under the collar.
His cellphone rang, a loud rock-and-roll song startling them both before he answered with his usual greeting, “Hello, Dean.”
That feeling magnified when Dean’s terrified expression came into view, only to blur again just before the world went black.
“I love you, Cas — and I want you to stay. Here. With me.”
Dean’s brain helpfully supplied an image of Cas from earlier at the diner. The way he shifted in his seat, the flush on his cheeks, averting Dean’s gaze. He wasn’t
Maybe it’s wishful thinking or just a fucking bad idea, but that never bothered him before. Ever since Dean’s bucket list of ‘Naughty Things To Do With Castiel’ became a thing, he’s been checking sexcapades off left and right...except this one.
“You are mine, Dean,” Cas growls as he pushes his cockhead against Dean’s puckered entrance. “I’m going to remind you of that.”
It’s love.
Dean tried pushing up on Cas’s forearms, pulling down on them, prying at his fingers. Nothing worked. He tried to recall the tips Castiel had shared with him over the last few days, coming up with something about using body weight and momentum instead of muscle and force. His eyes flicked to Castiel, who was watching him intently, as if following Dean’s thought process.
Finally,
Dean’s attention returned to the dance floor where Castiel was most definitely not crashing, nor burning. The two dancers moved with ease, getting used to each other and the tempo. Before long, they were weaving a sensual web of fancy footwork, dazzling twirls and caressing hands. If Dean didn’t know for a fact that dancer was
Cas has nice hands. Dean never really noticed before, but it’s hard not to when Cas’s long, thin fingers are around his neck…again. This time, he’s backed into a wall and Cas is standing in front of him, those brilliant blue eyes staring him down. He liked it better when he didn’t have to look at the angel’s face.
Dean let out a choked whine as he shifted his hips, silently begging Cas to fuck him but not sure what to expect next. He nearly collapsed from relief when he heard the cap flick open on a bottle of lube.
“Dean, please…” Cas whined now at the loss of contact, but that whine quickly turned into a loud moan when Dean pressed a vibrator to his perineum. Dean grasped Cas’s erection in one hand and stroked him lazily as his other hand ran the vibrator over his tight hole, his ballsack and occasionally his nipples.
Cas' breathing turned erratic as his lust-blown eyes trailed from Dean’s toes all the way up to his face, where Dean met him with a lopsided grin. Cas was pretty cute when he pouted.
He didn’t move when Castiel released his dancing partner to another.
Dean busied himself about the room gathering supplies, leaving Castiel to wonder what he’s up to. Dean grinned at the sight before him — Cas stripped down to his boxers, sitting up on the bed with his hands tied to the posts on either side of the headboard. He’s half hard already and Dean hasn’t even touched him.
Not easy, but easier.
“Okay, grab the necklace and light up some matches – got it,” Dean summarized. “And how exactly do you plan on getting the necklace? There’s a dance competition going on right now, you can’t just walk up and – ”
it, because it’s pushing in painfully against the bulge in his jeans. Dean understands the anger, but how in the hell could Cas believe he’d ever be anything less than perfect for Dean? This is not what he wanted, not at all.
Dean felt Cas shift on the bed before trailing kisses down his stomach. He opened his eyes just as Cas' tongue darted out to lick the underside of his shaft then swirl around his leaking head before swallowing him completely.
“Don’t you dare leave me like this, Dean Winchester,” Cas growled, half-angry, half-desperate.
Cas fisted his hands in the front of Dean’s shirt and pulled him in for a hard kiss.
At one point, Dean looked around the room, confused, silently bickering with himself over how
They all came zinging in at once, bowling him over like an invisible force. Everything snapped into existence and he wasn’t ready for it.
He runs with Sam, works out in the weight room, feels his human muscles strain and grow with every repetition.
════════════════════
on Dean’s part, but not to worry, he’s formulated a plan and it’ll start right here at the breakfast table.
Dean cried out, his orgasm ripping through him as he screamed out Cas’ name, spilling into Cas' hand and on his own stomach. Cas followed him, the feeling of Dean spasming around his cock sending him over the edge with Dean’s name on his lips.
Dean eyes, alight with amazement, followed Castiel’s graceful form across the dance floor and back again. The lights were down low, casting shadows on Castiel’s face. Music reverberated around the room, drawing Dean into a trance as he marveled at the sight before him. Castiel not only had moves, he exuded a sexual confidence that penetrated the room. Dean knew he wasn’t the only person in the room captivated by the man with stunning blue eyes and bed head hair.
Castiel’s feet are ahead of his brain and it catches up when he’s halfway to the bed. He sits down anyway.
He wasn’t ready.
“Sammy?” He questioned in between kisses and nibbles on Cas' earlobes.
“Yeah, Cas
“Uh, yeah…I think so,” Sam said. “I think it’s just free form right now, so they can change partners for practice.”
it — it hurts.
Dean is trying to follow instructions, he really is, but the feel of Cas’s warm breath on his neck is NOT helping. Not to mention the sound of that deep voice issuing commands in his ear. Sweat beads up around his hairline and rolls down his neck. He’s not entirely sure it’s from the workout.
Cas fell forward, planting both hands on either side of Dean’s bowed legs and changing the angle of their connection. Dean drove his hips up harder, aiming for the sweet spot. The moan that erupted from Cas’ throat was downright pornographic.
Dean,” Cas panted. Dean felt Cas’s body tense and his balls draw up tight, so he pulled away before the angel came.
The darkness isn’t permanent.
He can only make out bits and pieces, but it’s enough. Enough to wish that he still had his grace for the sole purpose of flying away faster than he can run.
That…that’s not a good face.
Dean got up from the bed, Cas’s head following his movement, and placed the hot pack back on the nightstand. He stripped off the AC/DC shirt and faded blue jeans constricting him. As the last of the ice cube melted in Dean’s ridiculously cold mouth, he climbed back in the bed and settled between Cas’s legs.
When Charlie showed up at the bunker, Castiel wasn’t sure what to make of her at first.
The only thing Castiel could do was wait. Again.
Dean’s arms tightened around Cas as he took a moment to process the implications of his statement. If Sam actually got back late Thursday, not Friday morning, that means…
“Aww, Dean,” Sam teased. “Don’t be jealous. I’m sure Cas can teach you how to move like that if you ask nicely.”
Belatedly, Dean realizes that Cas’ hands are occupied, so that cock ring still clamped around his dick is angel grace — they certainly didn’t have a real one lying around in reaching distance. It’s - God, it’s so fucking hot, and Dean moans like a wanton whore at the thought of it.
He can’t say he blames them.
════════════════════
In this moment, he exists for Cas and Cas alone, to be used how he pleases, to reaffirm that Dean
.’ The obscene moan he made as he came was just for show...mostly.
They face each other on the bar stools now, legs nearly touching, and just when things start getting interesting, Ken Doll shows up and slings an arm over her shoulder. He leans in to kiss her cheek as Dean struggles to control his surprise. Candice has been shamelessly flirting with him from the get go, so yeah, he’s a little stunned she’s got a model boyfriend and he’s
The Winchesters can use him, he’s not dead weight taking up space in the bunker.
Cas, your mouth — ”
Maybe he never will.
He’s one hundred percent sure when he walks by their designated training room and sees Cas and Dean on the floor. Cas is in a modified spooning position with his legs and arms wrapped around Dean's body. Dean is struggling to get free, but it’s obvious he’s enjoying his predicament.
Sammy returned and launched right back into their discussion. Dean only half-listened as he began moving his foot in a circle then rotating the ball of his foot from side-to-side, alternating the pressure on the angel’s semi-hard erection. Dean was treated to the sight of Cas' lips parting as his breath hitched. He tried stealthily moving out of Dean’s reach by scooting farther back in his chair.
Told him to stay as long as he wanted, it’s his home now.
“Cas…” Dean didn't want to hear this. He can't take it when Cas talks like that.
Dean unexpectedly reached out and grabbed the front of Cas' shirt and pulled him close, pressing their lips together in a hard, heated kiss. The angel let out a surprised squeak but melted at Dean’s touch and kissed him back fervently. Dean wrapped his arms around Cas and turned them until the angel backed up against the Impala with an
Tries not to combust when Dean’s eyes trail down the length of his toned body.
“And yet, that man’s hand ended up on your leg,” Castiel growls. “He
“I do not understand that reference, Dean,” he replied, resigned. “We need to get that necklace and since both of you dance like cows in China, I will be the one infiltrating the dance floor.”
Castiel is not impressed.
Without a purpose, because he doesn’t have one anymore.
She’s starting to grow on him. As much as she possibly can in his current state, he supposes.
Suddenly, Dean wasn’t hungry anymore. He dropped his burger on the plate and stared at his hands. He breathed in deep, trying to calm his queasy stomach.
“Well, he actually got back late the previous night…and he heard us.”
“Can he do that?” Dean asked.
They all play games, watch movies, study lore. Slowly, he starts participating more, and the smile Dean gives him is enough for him to do it again.
The babbling starts again. Dean is strung out, practically weeping from over-stimulation and he needs to come before his dick explodes. He’s so keyed up that this orgasm is going to be more painful than anything else. Castiel must understand his pleas are unjokingly serious because he picks up the pace, bucking wildly into Dean as he releases that iron grip of angel grace from Dean’s cock.
Later, as they laid in bed with Cas curled into Dean, his head resting on Dean’s shoulder, Cas’ fingers traced small circles on Dean’s muscled chest.
“I need you, Cas.”
There’s a clock hanging over his head, so Dean makes the most of the time he has left. He eats some pie, saves some kids, kills some vamps. And if he’s more reckless than usual, loses his weapon, pulls his punches, lets himself get tossed around without trying all that hard to defend himself, Sam doesn’t seem to notice. He doesn’t notice when Dean get shoved against a support beam, a piece of rebar stabbing into his back. He certainly doesn’t notice the glimpse of a smile, the relief that washes over Dean in a split second.
The seconds tick by.
Sam tries not to think about how Dean has been acting lately.
“You saw Sam, how’s he doing?”
“Come on, Dean. Come on.”
Sam tries not to think about Dean saying he didn’t believe in anything. How he didn’t faith in anything anymore.
Cas opens the rear passenger-side door, where Dean’s head lays. Gently resting his hand against Dean’s forehead, Cas frowns, shaking his head. He lingers a moment, frown deepening, as he appears to consider something. “He’s not physically injured, but there’s a high dose of opioids in his blood. Sam, what happened?” Cas looks up at Sam, a pleading edge on his words. Sam tries to hold his stare but can’t, looking down at his brother as he speaks.
Cas just watched, at first.
But it was nice to know that he didn’t have to.
Parking in the garage, Sam catches sight of Cas, anxiety plain on his face. Anxiety that morphs into horror when Sam steps out of the Impala alone. He’d guess his face is a near mirror image.
Before he arrived, Cas was sure he would head straight for Dean, to see him again. But now? This memory stopped him in his tracks.
can’t
“Cas?” Cas, still on the ground, began stirring as Dean turned him on his back, positioning him to be somewhat upright, “Cas! You okay, man?”
“No, Sam. What happened? What-” Cas cuts himself off when he spots the body in the back seat.
Cas stayed with Sam and Jack, for the time being. He knew that, eventually, he’d return to Heaven, would be able to see Dean again. But time worked different there – Dean could wait for Cas, Jack needed him now.
Leaning up against the Impala, Dean looks out over where he parked. Vaguely aware he’s somewhere in Appalachia, the drive from Lebanon was done mostly on autopilot, too many thoughts fighting for his attention. Orange, red, and yellow leaves give the appearance of flames burning through the landscape, as Dean tries not to think about the funeral pyre he built for Cas last time, and how there wasn’t even anything left for him to burn or mourn over this time.
At that, he meets Cas’ gaze, a wounded expression on both faces.
Dean appeared alarmed for a second, “Cas?” Looking between the memory version next to him and the real version standing a few feet away, settling on the real one when the memory doesn’t react, “Cas? What is this?”
Nothing happens.
he wanted to show it to Cas.
00:30
sent his way as Dean stormed past towards the garage was any indication, something must have set Dean off.
Sam tries not to think about how, just moments ago when the doctor’s ghost had Dean cornered, Dean didn’t even try to defend himself.
A decade ago, Dean went down kicking and screaming, fighting for his life tooth and nail. Now, on the edge of death by his own hand, he’s about ready to beg to not be sent back. Heaven would be a nice upside, sure, but he’s been to Hell; he’d take either over more of the same.
He white-knuckles it the whole drive back, refusing to look in the rear-view in case he accidentally catches a glimpse of Dean back there. Of course, pulling up the Bunker’s driveway just causes more dread to set in.
Once they were both steady on their feet, Dean began, rubbing the back of his neck, “Look, uh, about what you said-”
“Well c’mere, man.” Dean rises, pulling Cas into a hug. they may not have physical bodies here, but the comforting effect it has on them both is the same as on earth. “It’s good to see you. The real you.” Pulling apart enough to see Cas’ face, hand resting on his neck, Dean continues, “I, uh- I missed you. You were gone, and I… It wasn’t the same without you.”
Inhale. Exhale.
Over time adjustments are made to make this space into his space. Ultimately it ends up reminiscent of the library in the bunker; more shelf space, clean lines of uniform books rather than a hodgepodge of lore, but it feels like home.
Jody and the girls make the drive down. Donna, too.
“Dean?”
According to the clock, it’s just after noon. If he drives without stopping, Sam will be back at the bunker by midnight. Then he can go from there. Figure out what to do. But right now, he just has to drive.
“Help me get him inside?” Sam asks quietly.
Sam’s watch beeps.
“I don’t understand, what happened?” Pulling away enough to see Dean’s face, Cas caught sight of the white-stone ring, “What did you do?!”
“Dean, you’re talking about killing yourself.”
“Hey! Dean. No, no, no, no, no, no, no.”
Once Dean is confident in his ability to teleport between dimensions, he stops by the bunker, invisibly, to check up on Sam. The time difference is expected, given the 4 months versus 40 years’ time difference he experienced in Hell, but it’s still jarring. Dean has spent at least a year preparing, getting his feet wet before diving into his new role, but only a month or so has passed on Earth. Despite not finding a body near where Dean’s car was left with his phone, gun, and a note in the glove compartment, Sam has organized a proper hunter’s funeral with all their friends and family exchanging stories and reminiscing.
Cas recalled Dean’s happiest memories from the last time he was in Heaven – with his mother, with Sam. And this was his new happiest, lying on the couch with Cas, watching a cowboy movie, binging on junk food?
Sam can feel it. He can’t say for sure what happened, but there was a shift in the air. The cold spots, the buzzing energy of ghosts trying to pierce the veil, gone in a heartbeat. He doesn’t need the EMF reader to tell him that his is the only soul left in this place.
Dean could talk, and the words sounded right to him coming out of his mouth, but according to Sam, what came out was gibberish. Writing wasn’t any better. They tried everything from speech therapy to angelic healing to enlisting Rowena for help, but apparently archangel trumps magic and modern medicine. With one dead end after another, Dean eventually stopped talking.
Jack is now the Almighty, and even he doesn’t mention Cas, doesn’t offer to bring him back, to try.
“It’s me, Dean. Jack, he brought me back.”
“Yeah?” Dean says, preparing the syringe he dug out of the duffle bag, “Well, it worked before.”
“Hey, it’s okay. Long story short, we took down Chuck, Jack took his powers, so he’s god now, and he set me up with this gig. That’s how I got you out.” Dean began to stand, offered a hand out to Cas for support, “You alright, need a hand getting up?”
Cas smiled softly as he made himself visible, “Hello Dean.”
Focusing for a moment, Dean felt a draw, urging him in one direction. Whether it had to do with his newfound abilities or the “profound bond” Cas had mentioned, Dean had a good idea of who he would find when he followed it.
With Sam, on the other hand, things were more strained than usual. Patience is a virtue, and not one that either brother has in spades. Between Dean’s guilt over Michael getting lose, Sam’s frustration at not being able to fix Dean, and Cas being stuck in the middle, speaking for Dean, tensions were high when the three were in the same room.
Cas knew Dean well enough to know when he was in a mood. If the gruff
Michael, evidently harboring some bitterness over being trapped in the cage in Dean’s head and a remarkable grasp of irony, decided to leave Dean with just enough brain damage so he lost his ability to communicate, but not so much as to make him unaware of this new reality. Trapped within the confines of his own mind. Again. Poetic.
“Good, good.” Dean looks around the room, pointedly not looking at Cas, “So what about you? Aren’t you persona non grata in Heaven? Are you going back to earth?”
Coming to, gasping for air, each breath leaves a bitter taste in his mouth. A breath he doesn’t deserve, doesn’t want, but he doesn’t exactly have a choice in the matter. What else is new.
When he gets the phone call this time,
“Dean, you have to know, no one thinks of you that way,” Cas pauses, “But I understand. When I was human, when my grace was failing, when I couldn’t heal you or your brother. I felt useless. I felt like a burden.” Dean has stopped pacing at this point, looking like he’s about to object, but Cas cuts him off.
“Idiot,” he grumbles; Dean may or may not be able to hear him, but Sam can’t be bothered by that at the moment.
. Dean just didn’t realize it went both ways. You don’t know what you’ve got ‘til it’s gone, apparently. And its absence is certainly profound.
“Stupid.”
“Sam? I’m sorry, I thought I called Dean’s cell. Yes, it’s me. I’m at the Bunker now with Jack. He brought me back, somehow. We’re not exactly sure how. I just wanted to check in on you and Dean.”
Sam injects the second needle.
Sam dropped the lighter and they watched as Dean burned.
The sun had just set behind him and Sam was nearing the Kansas state line when Dean’s phone started ringing. Pulling over, Sam reached back to retrieve the phone from Dean’s pocket. Jack’s contact was displayed, the phone they left him with before taking off, so Sam answered the call. But before he could get a word out, he heard a familiar voice, noticeably deeper than Jack’s, on the other end asking, “Dean?”
The neurologist called it aphasia.
“All right.”
Eileen had agreed to dog-sit for a few days so Dean could take some time for himself, and Dean knows that, when he doesn’t show up tomorrow as planned, Sam will be able to track down his cell phone and find it here. Knowing that Miracle and Baby will be well taken care of, Dean allows himself a moment to enjoy the peace that has been pushing at his edges these past couple weeks, since he decided to put an expiration date on his grief.
And so, knowing that Jack could contact him as needed, and that Sam was handling the circumstances as well as could be expected, Cas returned home.
Home was never the bunker, or even Heaven, really.
Dean wants to argue, wants to be able to comfort Sam, Eileen, Donna, Jody and the girls, the people who Dean has most impacted at some point during his life, but Jack’s right. That life is over, and knowing what his life is now would bring them more pain than comfort. “I know. I just needed to see them. To know that they’ll be okay.”
“I know, I heard your prayers, and I’m sorry. I can’t get Castiel out of the Empty. But you can. There’s a vacancy: Death. After all the damage Chuck and Billie did to this universe and the others, I’ve been repairing and rebuilding. That includes respecting the eons-old agreement Chuck went back on, that god shall not exert any power over the Empty. But if some power-hungry reaper comes into this job, this could all be for nothing. You’ve worn the ring before, you know and respect the burden that comes along with it. I trust you.” Jack reaches out, offering the ivory ring in his open palm.
It’s not like Dean hasn’t seen nearly every corner of this country, almost 40 years on the road all but guaranteed this. But these moments when it was just him and Cas, with no monster to hunt, no case to solve, no one chasing him, that Dean could really relax. Take in the scenery, spend time with his best friend, and enjoy the moment.
And in exchange, Dean built a garden for Cas. Truth be told, he’d choose tilling garden beds over digging up graves any day, and while Dean would never admit it, he actually likes eating vegetables knowing how much care Cas put into growing them. He built bee boxes, too, remembering how much Cas had enjoyed following the bees, collecting honey.
They got into a routine. Dean would never get tired of waking up in Cas’ arms, or with Cas in his arms. The angel didn’t need to sleep, but Dean slept better when Cas was there, had fewer nightmares, so of course Cas obliged.
So what if he wanted to share his favorite movies and music with Cas. Dean’s dead, Cas is dead, and this isn’t real; no point in being ashamed now. Cas was his person. The only one besides Sam who he’d put before everything and anyone else. Who he gladly would kill for or die for. Brother, best friend, those labels didn’t quite fit right for what they had, but Dean didn’t have the vocabulary to describe their relationship. Even if knew every language ever spoken, Dean’s not sure the words exist to describe what they have.
Tried to dissect Dean’s Heaven, his happiest memory.
A not-insignificant part of himself was surprised that he made it to the attic, not the basement. Pleasantly surprised, sure, but at this point he was willing to roll the dice. Clearly. He’d take the eternity of slicing and dicing over these past couple weeks any day. At least then he felt something.
He’s not under any delusions. He knows that Cas isn’t coming back this time. Even if they did get Chuck to bring back everyone he snapped away, Cas was taken by the Empty, not by Chuck, and Chuck isn’t exactly doing them any favors these days.
“Decided what?” Dean said eventually, flapping his hands angrily to get the suds off. Doesn’t anyone else clean this fucking kitchen?
There was something missing from both of those seeming happy endings, and even though he was here now with Sam, Dean still felt a tug that there was an absent piece in his life preventing him from settling down for good. He tried not to dwell on this too much, because he was pretty sure he knew what that piece was and there was nothing he could do to reach it, no matter how much he wanted to.
"No, I'm-" Jack was interrupted by a yawn that made his jaw click.
"Why not give me the knife and I'll show you." Dean suggested harshly, straining against his bonds fruitlessly.
Cas turned them deftly and guided Dean to sit on the bed and knelt over him, almost an inverted mirror of the night before. Cas pushed up Dean's undershirt and kissed along his chest and belly, letting out these little breathy hums that were driving Dean crazy. He licked over a nipple and Dean twitched like he'd had a static shock. He realised he was getting all the special treatment here, and that was wrong.
"You're welcome."
The boy was equally exhausted.
“You can leave it out, if you’re reading it. I have some bookmarks somewhere.”
A lump had formed in Dean’s throat and he swallowed a few times, finally managing in a low voice, “What are you doing here man?”
Dean nodded and rubbed the back of his neck with his free hand, suddenly nervous. “Do you um. I’m going to make pancakes. If you want you can-” Dean stopped and closed his eyes for a moment. “I’m going to make pancakes and you are going to eat them.” He nodded decisively and pushed past Castiel, tugging him along behind him with the hand on his arm. If that hand slid down to hold Cas’ hand rather than awkwardly pull his him along by the bicep, well, it was only because it’s easier to tow by the hand. It had nothing to do with the fluttering that sparked in Dean’s chest. Not one tiny, little bit.
Cas looked up at him with his stormy blue eyes as he sucked Dean down again, bulging out his cheek with the length of him. Dean whined and kept petting Cas's hair, wanting to give back some of what he was receiving.
Dean looked away from his brother, choosing instead to look at the floor, moving a stone around with his foot. They had talked about this, had tried picking the mantle back up after the Hell was shut by the trials when Sam had recovered somewhat.
Dean shook his head, mentally congratulating Sam on his valiant effort to seem unaffected.
So saying, Dean gripped both of Cas's wrists in his hands and raised them parallel to his head, pressing them into the mattress firmly. Dean was lain almost on top of Cas, the flaps of his flannel tickling his sides tantalisingly. Their faces were close. Dean had a rivulet of Castiel's grace oozing down towards his chin. Cas tested his strength against Dean's grip, and found himself unable to break free, with his grace diminished. It sends a surge of tingling, shocking heat from his arms to spread through his whole body. Nothing was supposed to be able to keep an angel down. A groan found its way up Cas's throat, and Dean's grin widened.
Cas closed his eyes and made a noise around Dean's cock, a feedback loop of praise and pleasure.
"You're going to have to bite me harder, then," Cas said, and Dean's mind spun out for a minute. He knew Cas was kinky, but he didn't know he was THAT kinky.
"Cas, is he..." Jack trailed off apprehensively as Dean looked up at him, tired.
“I want you,” Cas confirmed in the dark. He spoke softly, confessional. He dragged his hand from Dean’s shoulder to his cheek and stroked it with his thumb.
“That’ll be Sammy, I should get that.” said Dean, patting down his pockets in search of the phone. “Uh, if you want to watch TV or something the living room’s-”
"Thank you." Cas said, holding his arms out to the voice of Dean Winchester, joyful as he had arms around him that felt real and strong. His eyes were still closed against the painfully bright light, designed to make him feel like the empty couldn't have conjured it.
He still felt breathless, like he’d been punched in the chest. Cas just nodded and leaned in closer, tugging at Dean's lapels.
Sam gave Dean an exasperated look over his shoulder and kept walking. “I’m not going to buy any drugs, period.”
"Cas," Dean responded playfully, unbuttoning Cas's shirt buttons with a practiced hand. With every new inch of exposed skin Dean would trail his fingers down it and his lip would twitch. "I need to see your wound, mr Lancelot."
- brief mention of suicide
"Then let's continue."
Dean nodded and eased them both up with a hand from Sam. They pulled Cas's arms over their shoulders, as if he was walking with them rather than a dead weight. Dean felt his heartbeat against his arm. Not dead, he corrected himself. Sleeping.
"You are a kind stream," Dean told him, seriously, then huffed a laugh at Cas’s bemused expression. Cas let go of his arm and reached out his shaking left hand to touch Dean's bottom lip and squish it with his fingers.
"Okay, alright Cas, I'll say it. This is just for you though, you hear? I don't do this for just anyone."
- Brief mention of John Winchester's various bigotries
Please do comment and kudos. Or don't lol I understand not commenting on h0rny stuff 😳
Cas broke the silence, smile fading from his mouth as he began, “Dean I-”
Sam hugged back, his eyes going misty as the word “Dean…” wobbled out of his mouth. The man in question gave a watery chuckle and pulled back, hands still gripping Sam’s upper arms tightly.
Dean pulled into the driveway of the house, having driven through the night because the road was soothing, and leaned against the car for a while, looking over the place he and Sam had made into a home over the past few months. The whitewashed front had little to distinguish it from the house on its right or any other houses on the street, with the same pattern of four exactly symmetrical windows looking out at the suburban street, the sturdy front porch, and the cheery welcome mat sat proudly at the door. The only real distinctive addition to the outside was a knocker in the shape of a goblin’s face which amused Dean greatly when he spotted it in a thrift shop display case and had pulled a rueful grin from Sam as he affixed it to the door.
“Good thing we’re all dirt poor,” he clarified, and Dean hooted, slapping Cas on the back.
"To be clear," Dean said eventually, raising his head, "you mean..."
“Oh yeah, tell that to Monopoly. I seem to remember
presence recently.
“Some kid we’ve got there,” he said when Sam came in to get himself a drink too.
"Piss off Sammy."
He felt a weight to his limbs that he couldn’t quite shake as he sat up. That was weird, right? He’d got his best friend back, they’d had excellent sex, he was supposed to be happy. Dean sighed. He could feel his poison leaking out into his limbs.
"Are you going to be good?" Cas asked, allowing Dean to take both their fingers to the knuckle. Dean hadn't done anything to show he was turning demon so far, but it paid to remind him who is in charge of this transaction. Dean moaned and Cas pulled their fingers back to let Dean speak.
"You like that Cas, you like hearing how you make me feel?"
He meant to return the favour, he really did, but he was exhausted from keeping watch the night before, and Cas pushed off his wandering hands. He cleaned them both up with a wave of his hand, and lay Dean down properly, pulling his jeans back up and shirt back down. Dean looped his arms around Cas's shoulders and left them there, a tugging in his gut telling him not to let him go.
“I...” Cas hesitated. “I think it might be best.”
“That’s because I didn’t realise you were palming all the good Community Chest cards.”
Dean heard Jack leave, and felt Sam's hand on his back.
Cas instead diverted at the last minute and licked along Dean's chin and cheeks, getting up as much grace as he could. He then leaned back to look Dean in the eye. Dean looked from his stormy eyes to his tongue, which had silvery rivulets running down it. God damn, this guy is going to do him in before they even have sex.
He rinsed and spit, and even tried flossing. He quickly gave up when it made his gums bleed, but he tried, damn it, that had to be worth something.
Then he almost dropped the phone when Sam called back.
“What’s wrong with me being a lady and a boy?”
Sam rolled his eyes so hard they practically fell out of his head, but he laughed too. Dean couldn’t help his grin. He felt lighter, gleeful. He followed Sam back out to the library, and Jack turned to them, eyes bright.
“Right.” The pause that followed was just shy of uncomfortable as they both continued eating, Dean using the last of his food to mop up the syrup left on his plate. He sat back in his chair and tried for conversation again. “So, where are you working?” Dean asked, remembering him having said something about wages.
They had moved on to the frying pan when Dean spoke up again. He couldn’t look at his friend as he spoke and his voice came out small, quiet, sounding fragile as a pane of stained glass. “Cas, what happened to you? Last thing we knew, all the angels disappeared and you were nowhere to be found. Where were you buddy? Are you human now?”
“Me too Dean,” Sam replied just as gently, putting his hand on Dean’s bicep too so they were joined along the arm, speaking concernedly when Dean looked up at him, “You gotta call me every week okay? If you don't, I'm running straight home with a shotgun and some holy water.”
(See the end of the chapter for
"Dude, what the hell was that?"
Cas looked back, and, to Dean’s horror, scowled. He pushed his chair back with a screech and stormed out of the room, slamming the door behind him. Dean stared after him, mouth open. Was he not supposed to say in front of Jack? But Cas had just demanded kisses in front of him two seconds ago. Had Dean done something? Did Cas not love him anymore?
Dean set to sucking and worrying the spot with his teeth, which made Cas gasp and tense over him. He wondered idly how long a hickey would last on Cas with his mega healing, and hoped it would be long enough for him to see it in the light.
Cas opened his mouth to correct Dean, and let out a breathy whine instead when Dean lowered his head and planted soft kisses down his sternum. His hands gripped the sheets instinctively, then reached up to Dean's hair. He stroked and tugged it aimlessly as Dean started open mouthed, sucking kisses on his abs. He lingered on them, breathing hot air onto cooling wet skin, which had Cas clenching his muscles and tensing his arms to stop himself pushing Dean's face back to his skin.
Thanks to everyone for reading, and especially those who've left comments, every single one has made me clutch at my heart with joy. I hope yous all have as good a day as you can 🥰
He could reach for his happiness too.
Noises slipped from Cas's lips easily, and whenever a new moan or hitch in breath comes through, Dean repeated the movement until Cas twisted his body. He's never sure if he wanted to escape the feeling or get closer, until it consumes him entirely. He found himself muttering endearments to Dean, repeating "I love you, I love you" like a prayer.
selfish, unreservedly. He hoarded the times Dean was reliant on him, dragged them out as long as he could, he refused to keep his instincts to tease and caress freely despite the embarrassment he knew Dean would feel if he knew about it.
Instead Dean sat low in his chair and watched him breathe. In. Out. Alive.
Dean pulled back with a drag of teeth across Cas's tongue and smirks at Cas’s face.
"Sorry," Dean said with his best rakish grin, unrepentant, "Maybe you could clean me off?"
A long pause. Dean reverently put Cas's shoes together, neatly, at the foot of the bed. He rubbed the heel of his foot with his palm and debated whether to take his socks off. Would his feet get cold? Or would he feel sweaty and gross? Dean might feel vulnerable if he woke up with his socks off. He left them on.
“Are you two in love?”
"Cas, buddy, it feels good, you feel so good."
"As for the mood..." Cas said, and kissed Dean's damp cheeks, then his forehead, then his jaw, mouthing along to his ear until Dean's breath caught in a gasp, "Yes, I think we can reset the mood quite easily."
Dean's gaze roved slowly up and down his body before coming back to meet his eyes. He had that heavy look he sometimes got before feeding, a banked flame of hunger that could spark back to life in a second.
Dean trailed them at a distance and hovered outside Jack's bedroom. He listened to Cas's deep, rumbling voice reading To The Moon And Back Again. His heart clenched every time Cas said "I love you". It was different to how he'd said it to Dean, not laden with grief or desperation. Purely happy. He turned that thought over in his head, and as Cas left Jack's room he blurted it out:
“No, you’re a boy.”
“I think I’m a boy right now,” Jack said, “but I might change my mind and be a lady and that’s okay.”
“Sam!”
"Here?" Cas said, ignoring Dean, revelling in the undivided attention he got when he put the blade against the soft skin of his inner elbow. "Here?" He tripped the sharpness along his cheek and was surprised to see Dean manage to shake his head through the violence imbued in him at this moment.
Cas kissed him, hard, and slid his left hand into Dean’s pants. Dean arched away from the kiss with a whine, feeling overstimulated. Cas jerked him, once, twice, and he came, the lights bursting out with his groan.
Sam’s smirk turned soft at the mention of Jess, her memory now being a throb of sadness and affection rather than the stab of guilt it once was. Or, that’s how he described it when Dean had asked. Returning to college had brought up some difficult issues. “Yeah, well, I don't know how Jess put up with me for so long either. She was...great. Anyway how about you?”
“Okay, good, get going then Gigantor.” Sam got six feet away before Dean called out again, “Sam!”
When Dean was in this state, he wouldn't remember anything Cas said to him, which was a brittle comfort. It might snap into a sharp guilt later but for now, he was in a similarly euphoric mindset to Dean. He'd always been too close to Dean's emotions, after all.
“To make out.” Cas clarified, as if it wasn’t clear.
Dean felt a sudden surge of panic, his heart going haywire. Cas was gone. This prayer was all that tied them together. He was gone, and he didn’t know how Dean felt about him. Dean kept his eyes squeezed shut. He scrunched a hand in his jeans and had to keep talking.
- Castiel being nasty to his son (believing he is the Empty)
- compulsive checking behaviours
Castiel paused a while before answering, seeming to gather his thoughts. Dean listened to his soft exhale before he began, his voice as low and grave as ever. “I did not mean to remain hidden from you all this time. In heaven, Metatron revealed the last ingredient for locking the Gates was the Grace of an angel who loves...” he huffed out a small breath and raised his eyes to the window in front of them, “humanity.” Cas quirked his lip and gently nudged Dean with his shoulder. “I suppose ET could not go home as planned.”
Chapter specific warnings:
"Dean," Cas managed, finding his hand and guiding it across his side to the grace shining across his wound.
"I will. I'll stay with you," Cas said, knowing his voice was coming out too earnest for the friendship he so desperately wanted to cling to with Dean. Dean might have been asleep by the time he could bring himself to add: "As long as you need me, I'll stay."
- Implied references to suicide
“I was going to reveal myself the next morning but when I climbed back down the ladder I realised that contact with either you or Sam could pull you back from the safe-haven you have built for yourselves here. I didn't want to trouble you with hard memories so I stayed in the attic. I apologise for my freeloading. I had nowhere else to exist.” He finished with a small shrug and looked down at the floor.
Oh. He wanted to feed. Castiel wished this knowledge would deflate the anticipation building in his chest for an intimate moment with Dean, but Cas's treacherous heart beat faster at the thought of Dean needing him again.
I included a star wars film bc my pals are really into Clone Wars rn and if I have to hear about the Jedi all the time then so do you lol. Also please imagine as I do that Kevin is alive and well doing something badass somewhere offscreen with his mum who is also alive. Also also as you can tell from this note I am British innit so idk what a freeway is exactly. Is it like a Motorway?? I sure hope so! Enjoy!!
Dean copied his expression, squinting at his brother, “What? I work at the garage all day why would I stay up to clean?” He refrained from mentioning that he was usually awake anyway, sleep elusive as he remembered bad hunts and lost friends.
"We'll take him to my room." Dean said, daring anyone to comment but they didn't.
He said it over and over, kissing his lips, his forehead, his nose, laughing when Dean wrinkled it in response. The intensity had splintered and softened, with every “Dean” Cas brightened and Dean could hear him smiling into it.
“You think I don’t know you’re both cheating. You’re literally angels.”
Castiel gazed at the wall for a moment, and then looked at Dean again. “We can give it a…trial run” His fingers twitched in a small parody of quote marks around the last two words.
Please give me a kudos or a comment if you enjoyed this chapter, the kudoses (?) I got last time made me super happy.
