“He’s looking at us from the window, just smile.” Sherlock whispered and the doctor did so and then, unsure, brought Sherlock’s hand up to his lips and placed there a small kiss.
Because if she was right, it would change everything and John wouldn’t know how to handle it. “Look, I can’t help you dream wise but I could help you sort out your feelings.” Ella promised. “But you have to be open to anything. Whatever comes out, you have to embrace it, John. For your own good.”
Sherlock kept his deduction to himself and let Lestrade speak. “We got ahold of the people that were going to live in a house in the neighbourhood and delayed their move.” He tried to explain.
John wanted to have him in that moment. He didn’t care about anyone entering and seeing them like that, he wanted to have Sherlock there and then. He started unbuttoning the detective's shirt, then revealing his naked torso. “God..” John admired, kissing his skin with his fingers.
“I can’t risk it, Molly. There’s too much on the line.” Sherlock argued, his voice a whisper. “I can’t risk losing what we have. I’m not even sure that love is what I’m feeling, it’s all new and I’m-” He stopped, clenching his jaw.
John cursed himself for waiting so much, denying himself what he always wanted. Sherlock thought the same, he knew John would be the one that changed him for the better and he was glad his deductions turned out to be right, but God had he done it sooner.
John couldn’t believe his ears. “No.” He chuckled, nervously. “Why would it—no! I don’t fancy Sherlock
He let go of Sherlock’s hand and placed his on the detective’s cheekbone, tracing it with his thumb. “I always found them mesmerizing.” He could feel the detective tensing up under his touch. He moved his gaze up to his eyes and his heart stopped. Sherlock’s irises were almost invisible, the pupil was covering most of the space.
The doctor pushed Sherlock down on the couch and a few moments later he was striding him. His mouth grazed at the crook of his neck, making Sherlock arch his back. “Hmm..” He mumbled, cupping John’s face to capture his mouth again, lips locking loudly.
She whispered, trying to hide her sobs. Sherlock breathed, his hands a little bit shaky.
Of course there were a lot of speculations about John and Sherlock loving each other more than friends, and she had her doubts, too. Equally for both. Sherlock was a very difficult man, scared of human emotion in all its forms and John was equally as difficult, only attracting psychopaths into his life to stay afloat and give his life meaning. Yet she couldn’t think of anyone else more perfect for both of them than one another.
“You already sound like a married couple. This task shouldn’t be hard for you.” Greg smiled, looking at them from the rear-view window. Greg had always thought the two of them had something special and deep down he’d hoped a case like this would pop up.
With his hand, he muted John’s voice. The images getting smaller behind the new memory. Sherlock let out a sigh. The new one had every lip lock, every sound, every breath and every small move of air around them that night. He sniffed and piled the kiss with everything else, quietly. He wanted that memory gone from his conscious mind as soon as possible, but he also wanted to store it since it was probably the only time he’d kiss John Watson. He gazed at the room for a few seconds and then turned around, not really ready to leave it-
Sherlock was taken aback by such question and stared at John for a few seconds before replying, taking his time. “Does it matter?” He decided to avoid the direct response, wanting to know more about John’s feelings.
John looked down, his voice coming out as a whisper. “I could lose him.”
“Jesus, now there's two.”  John whispered, walking out of the door followed by a chuckling detective.
Sherlock thought about it for a moment. He had let her in once before, when she'd helped him fake his death and they hadn’t talked about
John thought for a moment, placed down his cup and crossed his arms. “Wait, do you think he was talking about me in the text? And not the both of us?” John had never complained for a case. He liked new challenges so he couldn’t understand what Greg meant by implying they wouldn’t have liked it. Just like his flatmate, John couldn’t think of anything he wouldn’t do either.
“School’s boring.” She protested, her eye-lids closing.
He kissed his daughter goodbye and headed back upstairs where Sherlock was silently sitting in his chair, violin on his lap. He had lost the usual blue rope he was wearing earlier and was back to his normal clothes. Black trousers, a white shirt and his black jacket on top. John sat silently in front of him.
She assured
John blinked. “Uh my— my boyfriend bought everything. He’s the designer, I usually notice from the credit card bills.” He joked, wondering were Sherlock was. “I’ll go put this down, be right back.” John informed, going to look for him. “Make yourself at home!” He shouted from one of the corridors.
Sherlock’s phone buzzed in his pocket, he grabbed it and sighed at it.
“How?” Sherlock asked again, furrowing his brows.
He’d called the room his ‘human room’ because in there was Sherlock’s human side. He never opened the door, except when he had to store in new memories. Many times he had wanted to delete everything because it just hurt too much, especially while he was inside. Sherlock’s love for John was something else, something he had never felt for anyone before and that room, with time, had become both his favourite and the one he despised the most.
John snickered. “You want to put
“Mh, no.” Michael smiled, mouth full. “I’m more of a lone wolf. I’m not a fan of the whole commitment thing. Haven’t met the loyalest people. But I enjoy looking at other couples. I love the way you gaze at each other. You can tell you’re in love.” He complimented them.
Rosie’s face saddened. “Was the kiss a mistake, too?” She asked, looking at both of them.
“Jesus.” John sighed, walking to hit the sack as well.
Sherlock glanced at him. “I don’t know.” He lied. Of course it was meant for John, why else would Greg text him on his phone and not on his own as usual?
“How long have you known each other for?” Michael asked, biting into his food.
Mycroft’s voice teased him.
Sherlock stared at him blankly. “What are you saying?” He asked, taking a step closer towards the doctor.
It felt weird calling him love, John almost winced. Not because he didn’t like calling his detective
Rosie thought that the damage was already done by then so she continued. “Do you love him?” She gasped. “Do you think he loves you, too?” Her eyes were sparkling.
“A little bit.” He winked.
Victim’s boyfriend’s house. Okay but
“Hm,” Sherlock smiled and pulled his head back so that his eyes would meet John’s. “I hadn’t noticed.” He revealed and for John that was it. His heart was done, completely done.
The man had taken a shower, put on clean clothes and looked a little bit more alive than before. “Hi, come in!” John welcomed, opening the door to let him in. “Me and-” He turned and Sherlock was nowhere in sight. “We’re glad to have you here tonight. We’re really warm people and when we move we like to make friends. After all we’re hopefully gonna live here for a long time.” John stated happily, taking the man’s coat.
Back at 221B, John had regained the ability to speak. “What was that?” He asked, crossing his arms over his chest.
“Well, now that’s a nice view.” Greg clapped his hands, letting out a laugh. Sherlock had never looked so different and John.. did John work out? “Where the fuck did you get those muscles from?!” He squealed, pressing his fingers on the doctor’s biceps. John told Greg he was used to do some work when anxious. Sherlock rolled his eyes and forced John into the car muttering a
Sherlock could sense there was something troubling John and he hoped it wasn’t the kiss. He didn’t want to lose his best friend over something he did for the sake of the case.
“You know I have zero problems watching this doll, dear.” Mrs. Hudson declared, softly calling Rosie inside her apartment with her hand.
Sherlock was excited, he couldn’t stop pacing around.
Sherlock had put Rosie to bed that night, reassuring her some more about the kiss but not giving her too much hope about him and her dad and was now sitting in his armchair with John in the other.
“Not yet.” The detective replied. “But I will, soon.” He assured, looking out the window. “So, from what I see the boyfriend’s home. We should pay him a visit.” He suggested.
His hands went to Sherlock’s curls and tugged the ends towards him as both their tongues were dancing together. The detective’s hands moved from his shirt to his sides, squeezing them before running them back up to cup John’s cheeks. God, Sherlock was good at this.
John cleared his throat and Sherlock moved his hand up to stroke John's cheek which made the doctor’s heart do a flip.
After a couple of minutes both men came out and looked at each other. “Oh.” John let out. Sherlock was wearing a lilac t-shirt and a pair of low-waist jeans that showed the hem of some bright green underwear, similar to Moriarty’s. He had also changed his shoes to sneakers. John grinned.
John blushed, wishing he could go back to when his daughter couldn’t talk.. just for a minute. “But I did that as a mistake. It won’t happen again.” He assured.
John tossed and turned all night. Everything he was feeling was very new to him, he didn’t know what to expect. How could he face Sherlock in the morning? Would they pretend nothing happened?
Sherlock ignored him and disappeared towards his room.
But no weird 'Sherlock' things.” John finally advised, pointing a finger to the detective. He felt like he needed to make that clear because Sherlock could go that far if he didn’t set some rules.
Sherlock’s heart tightened but he kept sipping from his now half-cold jug. “But it’s okay. It was for the sake of the case. Like you said, it didn’t mean anything so..” John cleared his throat. “We’re okay. Everything back to normal, yes?”
more than anything, romantically or not.
“Well?!” Sherlock’s hands opened in front of him. “Drug deal? War threat? Death threat?” He gasped. “Serial killer?” Sherlock closed his eyes and crossed his fingers. “Please tell me it’s a serial killer.”
“You still haven’t told me what the guessing game you play with Rosie is.” John pointed out at Sherlock who had come out of his bedroom and had positioned himself on the couch.
“You can.” She assured, nodding. “But it’s up to you.” She continued. “Tell me, what’s the worst that could happen, according to you, if you let yourself open to the possibility?”
Sherlock’s eyes were pleading and Greg sighed, disappointed. “You can pretend it was just for the case with John, Sherlock.. but you can’t kid me.” He glanced at Sherlock whose gaze had suddenly saddened, then at John. “I see how you look at him, and how he looks at you too.”
“Sorry.” He apologized. Sherlock just shook his head as in not to worry.
When he opened them again he was standing in front of a black, locked door and his hands were fidgeting with a golden key. He stood there for a few moments, unsure. Then, having gathered the strength, he slid the key inside the lock with shaky fingers and let it fall to the ground with a loud thump.
“How about the neighbours?” Sherlock asked.
“His best friend, as well as his drug dealer and accomplice, found out she was cheating on him with some guy named Paul, and the call was to tell him he’d killed him. Michael was quite pissed about that, that’s why he had to leave dinner so abruptly.” Sherlock explained, wiggling his eyebrows at the little girl who giggled in return. “Anyways me, your dad and the inspector found him with a gun pointed at his friend. He confessed everything. You should have seen his face.”
“Yes.” Sherlock gulped, glancing at the man next to him.
Sherlock had his back against the sink. His hands were holding a fuming cup and his curls were tracing his forehead so perfectly that John couldn’t help but stare. He had often found himself gazing at Sherlock for more than a few seconds but he didn’t find it unusual. Sherlock was a very handsome man and it was fine, John was just acknowledging a friend’s beauty. It was normal. Yes.
“You’re not scared of your feelings, John. You’re scared of what they would do to you if you let them in.” Ella revealed with a small smile. She knew that this topic in particular was pretty tough on John, but she also knew that someday it would have come out and she was ready to help him deal with it.
When he opened his eyes again, Sherlock was back in the room. The memory of the kiss was there but the feelings were faded. They still existed, they were still somewhat alive, but very faint. It was easier for Sherlock to control them that way, especially regarding John.
“We don’t know yet.” Greg revealed and Sherlock’s lips turned downward. “A young woman was found dead along with her parents in their family home. Apparently her boyfriend, Michael Mavis had gone out to take a call and when he came back he found them laying dead. He said he didn’t hear any shots or screams.” He explained with his hands resting on his waist.
“Do you really think it was a good different?” John asked, unsure if he wanted to hear the answer or not.
John watched as the two of them talked even though he couldn’t understand what they were saying. Sherlock’s body language had varied throughout the conversation but he wasn’t as good as the detective at deducing the meaning behind certain movements. That’s why he decided to let it go. “Everything good?” John asked, stepping outside.
He waited for a few moments, took a deep breath and confessed “I’m scared.”
“Yes.” He assured, pecking his lips again.
As he was patting his face dry, a distant sound of the kettle made him realize that John was awake, too.
John tried, nodding down.
“Hmm.” The detective groaned, the voices getting louder.
John’s fingers sent a shiver down Sherlock’s spine and legs and for a moment he thought he’d fall to the ground. He clenched his jaw, trying to maintain control but failed miserably when he met John’s eyes. Sherlock’s free hand joined his other behind John’s back, stopping their movements. He moved them a little bit lower, resting just an inch above the doctor’s curving. “I can think of a few things I find mesmerizing about you, as well.” He said in a low, raspy voice.
Michael’s smile faded as soon as his phone buzzed. Eyebrows furrowed.
Sherlock must have sensed John’s worry so he continued. “It really is just a game. She likes it. I’m not forcing her to do anything.” He paused. “Rosie’s smarter than you think, John. She has a lot of Mary.” He expressed with a calm voice. “But also a lot of you.”
“You did, but uh-you—” he cleared his throat. “You were probably thinking of something else, it’s okay.” Sherlock smiled, handing him the salt container.
, he just wasn’t used to it.
Thank you so much in advance!!
Sherlock looked up from his phone. “Do you really want to know?” He asked, turning to face John who nodded with a smile. “We like trying to guess people’s lives based on what they’re wearing or how they walk. If they’re on the phone who they’re talking to. What their job is. Stuff like that.” Sherlock explained. “Rosie is very good. She learns quickly. I usually start deducing and she follows, I ask her questions and teach her my methods.” He shrugged.
He closed his eyes.
“Now there’s the other part.” Greg hinted a smile to both of the boys, took a deep breath and opened his mouth again. “We need you to go undercover and investigate from there.”
“You’re enjoying this, aren’t you?” John shook his head, a small grin forming.
Sherlock rolled his eyes.
Molly’s voice echoed through the phone and Sherlock bit his lip, not really knowing why he’d called her. Not hearing any response from the man, she spoke again.  “
“What about-OH.” The realization hit him. He grabbed his coat and picked Rosie up. “Daddy and Sherlock have got to do something, you can play at Mrs. Hudson for a bit. I’m sure she won’t mind.” John didn’t like leaving his daughter all the time to their landlady. He knew Rosie wasn’t a burden for her but still, he didn’t want to impose.
“Say it again.” Sherlock demanded, taking a step back. John groaned, pulling him back in. “No, I want you to repeat what you said.”  The detective chuckled, keeping his voice low as not to wake Rosie up.
John hid his face in Sherlock’s chest, blushing. “You heard me.” He replied, nuzzling his nose in his shirt, loving his smell.
The bathroom’s door opened in front of the doctor and a new scent made its way through John’s nostrils. “Is this cologne?” He asked Sherlock, smiling cockily.
“Not much.” Sherlock smirked, glancing at Greg. “I think we can go to the crime scene, now.” He grabbed his coat but was stopped by the inspector’s hand.
“Then, do it.” He suggested, his voice barely audible.
“Second room to the right.” Sherlock pointed, then eyed John again. The doctor hadn’t said a word. His chest was moving up and down quite fast and his cheeks were of a bright red. Sherlock raised an eyebrow. “Do I have to restart you?” He asked and once John’s gaze met his he continued. “We have a killer to catch, c’mon!” His hands moved up and down and John just nodded, suddenly not knowing where he was or what he was doing.
Sherlock took a shower, changed his clothes and laid down on his bed. He took a deep breath, rubbed his hands together and closed his eyes.
John lifted his bruised hand up to the knocker on Sherlock’s front door. His knuckles were grazed, his cheek hurt and his eye was swollen. His lip had stopped bleeding, at least.
"I-I mean," he says, "my flat is in one of the oldest parts of the campus, the building is Victorian and has some interesting features, I have a fireplace in my room for example, it unfortunately doesn't work, well, not anymore, not since the incident with the owl, but the mosaic of tiles in the surround have a pleasant green carnation pattern, if one can appreciate that kind of thing and, well."
Sherlock closes his eyes, forcing himself not to curl into the space beside him that John has vacated. He hears John searching for something, then a scratching noise that seems like... that could be...?
“Do you really think that, Sherlock?” John asks, his tone unreadable to Sherlock’s screeching mind. He nods, then dares to open his eyes and looks at John.
I look at the now dark house. I know I shouldn't be here. I know he knows I'm here. He knows I know he knows I'm here.
The smooth, rich voice broke into Sherlock’s thoughts and he opened his eyes. The man pulling up the stool next to him was tall, with a casual air of distinguish. Mid-fifties, dark hair and soft brown eyes.
“So, you’ve done me. Who else…” John looks around, then indicates the student who’s just come into the coffee shop. “What about her?” he whispers in a conspiratorial tone.
Sherlock answered the door with his customary “John,” then John felt warm hands cradling his face. He winced and Sherlock instantly backed off. John regretted it, but dutifully followed Sherlock to the kitchen at the latter’s instruction.
John sighed. “Yeah, well that what friends do,” he countered, “they stick up for each other, rainbow drag or not!”
"Are you sure?" Dr Bradstreet said. "You know we're here to help you, right? With anything at all?"
The joy in Sherlock's chest is tinged with a sharp ache of longing. John looks like he belongs here, standing amongst Sherlock's things in a space that Sherlock keeps so private and so protected. He wonders what John would think to know that he is the very first person to be allowed in like this.
pouring into his veins as endorphins flooded his system. John smiled where they were connected and a dart of tongue dashed across Sherlock's lips. His mouth dropped open in a silent gasp of appreciation and John pressed his advantage. He licked his way inside, teasing and gentle, and it was all Sherlock could do to stay upright. He swallowed back a groan of pleasure as finally John pulled away.
John, God love him, just nods and keeps smiling, as if this display of complete idiocy is charming, rather than merely insane. Sherlock scrabbles for his phone in his pocket and flicks the photo app to a picture he'd taken of the fireplace when he first moved in. He offers the phone to John across the table, and their fingers brush for a couple of seconds when John takes it. Sherlock's heart makes a break for it, escaping his ribcage to settle in his mouth.
“Hm?”
John chuckled to himself for a moment, then something clicked. He sat bolt upright. Sherlock twitched but didn’t otherwise react.
“Yes I can,” Sherlock argues. John gestures for him to elaborate. “Left thumb,” Sherlock says, lips quirking into a half-smile.
Christ. Too circular, too tired. Anyway, makes no difference. I didn't expect him to come straight back to me (my open arms, always open for you John), except the very small part of me which did. He didn't, that's why I'm standing in the garden watching the house. It would be foolish even for me to think that everything could go immediately back to how it was. I curse my naivety for ever thinking that everything could somehow be the same as it had been. I curse myself harshly back to the moment I knew I had no choice but to go up onto that damned roof. Nothing is ever new. Everything is broken.
“It’s about Sherlock,” Greg sighed. John’s jaws immediately clenched.
The desk is covered in crumbs, wrappers, an empty water bottle, crumpled bits of paper, and a chewed pen lid or two. Scowling at this invasion of his space, Sherlock irritatedly sweeps the detritus from the desk into a nearby bin. He drops his bag on the floor beside the chair and draws out his laptop, determined to concentrate on his notes. Despite himself he can't help gathering information on this interloper who's made such a mess and carelessly left it behind for him to find. Sweet tooth, that's obvious from the wrappers and biscuit crumbs (sloppy eater, ew), stressed out despite it being only the third week of the semester (chewed pen lids), clearly plays sports (water bottle), medic in their final year (going by the crumpled notes).
The smoke curls up into the faded orange light of the streetlamps. Giving away my position, I think dimly, should really know better. Should really know better than to be standing here in the first place. But then, I never was one to do what's best. Even when I try to do what's best, I fail miserably. That's how I lost John. How I keep losing John.
“What? I can’t hear you, love,” John said, barely even noticing the endearment until Sherlock blushed to the roots of his curls.
This is a date. A proper date. John had said so. Well, texted so. Since that conversation yesterday, Sherlock has spent approximately 55 minutes of every hour panicking and envisaging every possible way this date can go wrong. And there are so many hypotheticals and variables that he has been driving himself up the wall. He's changed his entire outfit, down to his socks, at least six times. At this point he has no idea if he is even wearing pants. He fussed with his hair in the mirror for a full hour before giving up and washing it again so he could start over.
The average response time of a London ambulance is eight minutes. Feels a lot longer when you’ve ripped stitches out of a bullet wound in the centre of your chest, you’re bleeding internally and you’re gripping for dear life onto your best friend’s arm, begging him without voice. Begging him to do what exactly? At that moment I’m not sure even I was precisely sure. But it worked. Mostly.
Well, that last one was easy enough to answer. Despite having been at the school for a couple of months now, Sherlock didn't seem to have made any friends. John often wondered how lonely it must be, not to have anyone to talk to, to muck about with, to tease about girls. And maybe... Boys too?
“Very clever,” he said. Sherlock frowned. “My turn? British, obviously,” he continued, ignoring Sherlock’s huff of indignation. “Here for work, not pleasure. Leaving for pastures new soon though. And alone.”
“Hi Sherlock!” He greets cheerfully, gesturing to the seat and cup opposite him. “I got you a cappuccino.”
"Oi! Eyes up!" John laughs, giving Greg a good-natured shove away from Sherlock and tugging his arm gently to make Sherlock step closer to him.
"Whoa, sorry mate!" The lad says, taking Sherlock's elbow in a firm grip as he juggles his bag, cup and phone. Sherlock manages not to spill or drop anything and opens his mouth to tear a verbal strip from the group for blocking the doorway. He freezes when he sees deep blue eyes, a scruffy dishwater blonde fringe and a warm smile on the face of the boy holding his elbow.
John smirks at Greg and nods as if to say, see, anything you can do... Sherlock glances at Will, who is flushed to his ears and panting slightly. Greg grins back at John and before any of them can react, drops to his knees in front of Will and whips off Will's towel. Sherlock can't help the tiny gasp that escapes his throat. Will's erection bobs in the air in front of Greg's face and when Greg looks up to Will, tilting his head for permission, Will can only plead in a whisper.
John glanced around his shelf to see Sherlock gazing out of the window to his right. His tangled hair was catching the sunlight again, the coppery hints in the curls glowing warmly. His eyes were bright but somehow sad, and his mouth. His mouth looked soft but almost wistful. His profile was striking and unusual, with those sculpted cheekbones, and he had an overall air of effortless elegance to him, even just sitting looking out of a school library window. John wondered how he’d never noticed just how beautiful Sherlock was. Too busy only thinking about his hair, his brain supplied helpfully. Fuck off, he told it.
"Shh, s'okay," John was saying, "we don't have to-"
“John?”
Sherlock began to look a little uncertain, and her voice was quiet when she next spoke. John reached out without thinking and stroked Sherlock’s hand in reassurance. Sherlock blinked, and John decided that it didn’t really matter how they’d gotten here. Just that they had. And-
“God, Sher - I’m...I’m so sorry,” John said.
'Please. Dregs in the cups you leave behind, one of which had a phone number written on the side of it. Either you're not interested in 'Sarah' or you're not reusing the same cup. Simple. That and the fresh grass you traipsed in on your shoes, indicating you'd come here directly from rugby practice, via the cafeteria in the Wilson building, which is the nearest one to the sports facilities. Conclusion: you have no idea what good coffee is. Or where to find it.'
“Oh, my abilities are much improved alright. And I have you to thank, Sherlock.”
“We solved the case. Tedious. You hadn’t slept properly since Thursday, and were almost catatonic by the time we returned to the hotel. I admit I was a little tired too.”
Hands entwined, they made their way to the bathroom, kissing between giggles. The roof repairs could definitely wait.
First the message – Mycroft’s doing. Then the reaction – Mary. Then – this. This mess.
I have a plan, or rather, I had a plan. Simple really; lure in the shark, remove its teeth, let the family go live in peace. It’s Christmas, after all. Time of cheer and goodwill to all men. Time of forgiveness, even for those who have done unspeakable things to those whom they love. Is there such a thing as the unforgivable? I fear if there is, I have at the very least come closest to it. Unforgivably stupid, that’s certain.
made John look like that. The swell of pride he feels at this realisation is only dampened by the ache between his own legs, his erection pressing uncomfortably into the fastening of his trousers.
“Stop thinking,” John murmurs fondly. “Come and meet the boys.”
"Good morning, Holmes!" Watson greeted me with a quiet grin. "A satisfactory evening, I trust?"
Sherlock just has time to blush at the praise when John's mouth meets his. The kiss is soft, just a simple pressure of John's lips, but it sets Sherlock's veins alight and sends a hot pulse of arousal to his groin. He hears a moan as John deepens the kiss, his tongue swiping across Sherlock's lips, gently demanding entry. He dimly realises the sound came from his own mouth but he can't bring himself to care when John's tongue brushes against his for the first time. John's thumb is stroking his cheek as his other hand moves down to his open collar, tracing the line of his throat. Every touch to his skin makes Sherlock's heart skitter.
Greg has nothing but mischief in his eyes as he reaches forward and tugs Sherlock to his feet. He strokes Sherlock's arm and shoots a cheeky grin at John, who is now rapidly turning a fetching shade of pink. The sight of John's lizard brain making itself known makes Sherlock swoon and want to beg on his knees for John to mark him and claim his body as only for John. The heady feeling makes Sherlock's head swim as John moves to push Greg's hand away (not as gently as John perhaps thinks) and wrap an arm around Sherlock's waist, angling his body so Sherlock is almost behind him and John is firmly placed between Sherlock and Greg. Will watches this display with widening eyes, licking his lips and grinning. His pupils are almost completely blown and Sherlock is certain that his own are in a matching state. Greg concedes gracefully and casually shrugs. He smirks at John, issuing an unspoken challenge, before turning to pull Will close to him and kissing him fiercely.
“No,” Sherlock murmured, “you are mine to please tonight, John. Let go, let me please you.”
John hands him his phone back. "Looks nice," he comments, and Sherlock can't miss the cheeky twinkle in his eyes. Feeling brave, Sherlock goes all in.
Sherlock moans lowly and closes his eyes. The stimulation of Greg on his knees, Will's head thrown back in ecstasy, and John whispering in his ear while he fondles Sherlock's prick is too much. Then John huffs a breath against his neck and Sherlock is almost overwhelmed by John's next words.
"John?" he asks quietly, unsure what he did wrong. "I-I'm sorry," Sherlock says, wanting to reach out and just touch John, to offer comfort or apologise or whatever John needs. John's head snaps up and he lets out a wet laugh.
"John, more," he moaned, lost in his desire. John obliged, adding another finger and licking away the pre come gathering at Sherlock's slit. Sherlock's breath was coming in great gasps now, his pulse racing and unsteady. Then John curled his fingers just so and sparks went off in Sherlock's mind, his blood thrumming in his veins. He arched his back, squirming as the intense pleasure swept through him. As soon as it had passed he felt his eyes suddenly fill with tears, chest heaving with heavy sobs. John's hand moved away and he gathered Sherlock's shuddering body into his arms. He murmured soothingly as Sherlock trembled, overcome and furious at himself.  His face flushed flushed with shame. He had ruined this, spoiled it before they'd even got very far. It was just too much, after waiting so long and wanting so badly, the feeling of John's fingers inside him so perfect and it was just too much.
"Which is why I've assigned you a tutor."
"Condom?" John asked against his mouth. Sherlock shook his head and John pulled back. He looked down at Sherlock with a frown. "Need a condom, Sherlock," he said, his tone the 'I'm a sensible doctor' one Sherlock disliked. He opened his mouth to argue; they were both clean, Mycroft had expedited the results. Not the best of times to be disagreeing with John though, or to be thinking about one's brother. Blinking to clear that image, Sherlock considered. Small price to pay this first time. Then he'd show John the paperwork and there need be no barriers between them next time.
"You can't just break into my nest."
"But I don't feel it!" Sherlock yelled in despair. "I thought when I'll get back to you, it would be okay, but it's not. How could I bond with you without an alpha?"
"You have one new message" chirped the phone. It sent a picture.
"Admit it, you missed me. You need me. Without me you are nothing. We are the same, expect you are boring, here on the side of the angels."
He turned around to leave, but then he saw Mycroft Holmes behind his back.
"Fine. But after that, out paths are separates."
He went to the swimming pool where Carl Power died. He understood all of the puzzles were a diversion to the Bruce-Partington project, but he got it.
John used his room, his bed. It filled Sherlock with satisfaction. It meant something. Maybe he has a chance to make things right.
"Sherlock, dear! This taxi driver..."
"But you liked Irene. You liked her more than anyone else. You grieved..."
"I'm so sorry!" Told Moriarty for John again.
"Few weeks ago he said you are the devil yourself."
"I never liked riddles."
"Look, Andrew West stole the project, tried to sell it, he get killed. That's it. The only mystery is why my brother annoying me, when someone else is so much interesting."
"Please God, let me live."
Idyll didn't last long. All of a sudden Moriarty sent a message for Sherlock.
"Yes, yes, yes!" Sherlock chanted.
Mike probably  wanted to bring him together with this alpha, Sherlock Holmes. Yes, he has to be an alpha. However John didn't smell anyone since the suppressants, every aspect of Holmes shouted he is one of them. He was handsome, but a dickhead as well. John didn't need and alpha patron, but maybe he has a chance for a better life.
"Let me see you again!" Sherlock pleaded. "We could go to dinner at Angelo's."
"You know, I had a plan, a brilliant a plan... " Mycroft walked out from the shadow. "...about a terror attack without victims. But one lonely, naive man, desperately to show of and a woman clever enough to make him feel special were enough to destroy this plan."
"It's obvious. And you will move to my room."
He could hear the low rumble of Sherlock’s voice in the sitting room, and the sound of bare feet pacing the wooden floor. Curious, he quietly tiptoed out of the bathroom to eavesdrop on what Sherlock was saying.
"I know that place!" He exclaims, "Molly makes a cracking cappuccino."
“Bit busy here!” he snapped.  Mycroft merely tilted his head at his brother, raised one eyebrow and left the room. Sherlock snorted, stood up and slammed the door. John huffed a small laugh.
John's shriek of alarm echoes down the hallway and I think I see him running towards me as my knees fold under me. The floor rushes up to my face and I realise with no small amount of annoyance that I've fallen. My brain feels as though it's being squeezed out of a tiny gap in my skull and my vision swims and goes dark. The last thought that registers in my mind before I lose consciousness is my frustration that the thief managed to surprise me enough to whack me over the head with the stolen psalter.
He kisses my hair softly, then my closed eyes, my cheeks, my jaw, my neck. His hands on my sides, his arms under and around me, his legs entwined with mine. I want, no, I need him, to take me apart, slowly, then put me back together. Sweetly, with such care, he does.
No, as much fun as that would be, John wanted what Sherlock wanted to give him. He would writhe and gasp as Sherlock’s tongue teased his leaking slit. He would cry out when Sherlock smoothly and surely licked a path towards his entrance. He would let time drag out, let himself be carried away in the feeling of Sherlock slowly preparing him. Those lovely fingers, slick and soft, circling and pressing just enough, entering him so sweetly, Sherlock crooking his finger until-
A knock and the door opening snapped the eye contact between them, and Sherlock startled before schooling his face to one of disdain at the intruder. John looked towards the door and saw a tall young man with ginger hair, sharp eyes and a smug expression on his face.
Well, alright, maybe he was allowing himself to become a bit distracted. But he was still doing very well. His biology and physics grades were superb, his French not so much but that was ok. It was extra credit anyway, it didn't matter as long as he passed. His maths and English were as good as they'd always been.
“John!” John growled in his ear and Sherlock’s cries of pleasure grew louder and breathier, his voice unsteady. A litany of “yes” and “oh” and “John” rushed from his mouth as John stroked him hard and fast, rutting against his bare backside in time with his fist on Sherlock’s cock. Sherlock turned his head, desperate to kiss John, but he couldn’t reach. He huffed in frustration, wanting to roll over, but unwilling to lose the feeling of John’s hot cock sliding over his cheeks. John’s rhythm was faltering and he growled again before letting go of Sherlock’s prick to roll him over.
“That was brilliant,” John told him, “I don’t know what Sally sees in that twat though. How did you know?”
Sherlock cleared his throat. “Yes, well…” he mumbled, cheeks flushing a frankly adorable shade of pink. John bit back his smile and set the bee down on top of the pillows. He still had a stuffed rabbit wedged behind his headboard, he wasn’t going to make Sherlock feel bad about the soft toy in his bed.
The ride back to Baker Street is equally silent. I leap out of the taxi as soon as it pulls up and retreat to my bedroom, discarding my coat and suit jacket on the way. I lie down on the far side of my bed in the dark on my front and try to stop my thoughts circling in despair.
Sherlock tried, he really did. But there was no stopping it now. Norwood would hear them and make a run for it, and John would have to chase him down because Sherlock would be bent double, tears streaming down his face, as his guts made a valiant attempt at escaping the confines of his ribcage through his nose and mouth.
“Is this a bee?” John asked softly.
Someone is there. Bent over, arm moving as if they're scribbling something hurriedly in his notebook. The person's face isn't visible, but Sherlock can see a compact body, strong shoulders, lovely arms, and a bum that shouldn't be legal in those jeans.
“What do you plan to do when you graduate then?” he asks.
"I know it's fine," he says, a little more clipped than he'd intended. He rushes to clarify. "I mean, I-I'd like that, if you- that is, I'd be happy to show you, i-if you- it's fine with me, if you-"
He realises that he's been sitting staring into space, fingers poised above his keyboard, a soppy expression on his face, for the last five minutes. All because of John Watson and his damn smile. The pleasant warmth in his body leaves him quickly as he scowls at himself, getting up and stuffing his things into his bag. He's late for a tutorial. Not one he ever goes to, but still. Anything to stop his mind simpering over John Watson. Or mooning over the note-leaving sporty medic who makes a mess and annoys him.
“Don’t worry, I won’t tell the others,” he whispered. He looked down at his feet sadly and then, shaking off whatever had made his shoulders slump like that, he took off down the hallway to his art class.
“Look, I had a quiet word,” Greg said. “I told them to lay off Sherlock, that that kind of shit wouldn’t fly and they should leave it alone, but I don’t think the message sank in. I mean, you must’ve seen the bruises, the amount of time you two spend together?”
Sherlock had apparently had plenty of offers but had turned them all down. Irene Adler had supposedly asked him out one day. He'd politely but firmly declined. At least, that was one version. The more salacious version was that Sherlock and Irene had hooked up her room one weekend but she'd kicked him out when he couldn't get her off. John didn't think that version was true, but it didn't stop the hot spike of jealousy he felt whenever he spotted Irene's neat bun in the canteen at lunchtime.
Sherlock gathers his things but as he lifts his books the note from the desk mess culprit flutters to the floor. Sherlock picks it up and annoyance flares once more. He crumples it and stuffs it in his bag, pulling free a note pad and tearing off a bit of paper of his own. He fishes about for a pen and when he finds one, scrawls a reply. Then he trawls the reference collection until he finds what he's looking for.
Satisfied, he gathers his things and heads for the stairs.
John gasped and arched up into the contact,his hands finding Sherlock’s hair again and trying to speed things up, take control. Sherlock wasn’t having any of it. He looked up, his eyes pleading with John to give him this, to follow instead of lead. To let the simple joy of being in one another’s arms like this carry him through.
Sherlock frowns a bit and blinks. He's starting to feel a bit nervous again. Will chuckles and claps a friendly hand on Sherlock's knee briefly. He leans in and whispers Sherlock's ear.
Sherlock spends the next few minutes deducing the student waiting for her macchiato (literature postgrad, owns a cat, shares a flat with her male best friend), then moves to the first year walking by the window (engineering, failed his exams last year and had to repeat them over summer, lives in a shared house and hates it). At every 'amazing' and 'brilliant' from John, Sherlock's confidence grows and he relaxes little by little. His verbosity and hesitant attempts at playfulness seem to inexplicably delight John.
John didn’t know how to feel about that. Rosie was still young to understand that it wasn’t really a game they were playing and that what Sherlock was teaching her would be with her forever. She’d end up like him. The doctor didn’t know if that’s what he wanted for his daughter. Sherlock was complicated and the whole thing sounded wrong to him.
“What?” The detective asked, mentally complimenting himself for the clothes he’d chosen for John. He was used to see him wear very large and comfortable clothing items that wouldn’t do any justice to the doctor’s figure so seeing him with that, indeed very tight, white shirt and those skinny black jeans was a sight.
“No!” He protested, looking in those blue eyes that were screaming ‘please’. He clenched his jaw and thought about it. “
His voice of a baritone lower than usual sent shivers down John’s spine, wanting nothing else other than to kiss his best friend. “I want to kiss you, again.” He spoke his thoughts out and a smirk approached Sherlock’s face, then his hand started moving up and down John’s arm, igniting his bones.
“Positive.”
Sherlock’s deduction was right. Obviously. “Let me guess.” He began, closing his eyes for a split second. “The people supposed to be moving in are a couple?” Greg nodded, knowing the detective had already got it. John, instead, looked at him with his eyebrows still furrowed so Sherlock proceeded. “A homosexual couple?” He specified.
“Oop, sorry!” Michael exclaimed at the sight.
. Shaky hands,
He let go of every single thought and every single worry and just followed Sherlock. If he went left, he went left. If he slowed down, he slowed down as well until at one point he noticed they were dancing in silence. “There’s no music.” John gave voice to his thoughts, whispering.
“What, princess?” Her father asked and she giggled. “You calling Sherlock sweetheart. I liked it.” She explained and Sherlock covered his face with his hands.
I loved writing Sherlock and Molly's conversation, I hope you liked reading it. :)
He managed to stand but his legs were still unable to properly support him.
John and Sherlock shared a look, then shook their heads. “It’s all fine.”
? The word house kept echoing in his mind.
Sherlock sat up properly. “What’s wrong?” John asked, glancing at the man beside him.
Her voice was sweet, kind of in a motherly way. Molly, somehow, was able to get Sherlock and see things that even John couldn’t.
John gazed up at his daughter, who had her eyebrows furrowed. “Yes, love?”
“I would never.” The detective promised. “Now, we need a change of wardrobe. We don’t look.. gay.” Sherlock’s hand gesticulated at the word and suggested a run to the shops to purchase a few things to look credible. After a lot of pleading, John agreed to change his looks.
“Thanks. Not everyone is this welcoming.” He sighed, looking around. “This is beautiful. Where did you get the kitchen?”
The detective screamed, finally being able to pull the memory of the kiss into the room.
He was ninety percent positive Sherlock was spending time inside his mind palace and he knew that he couldn’t do anything about it, even if he wanted to.
Sherlock smiled back and eventually stood up, offering John a hand. “Dance with me.” He was embracing Molly’s advice which turned out to be the same as John’s therapist.
Sherlock left John’s lips with a smooch sound then turned around to face Michael with an embarrassed smile. “Oh, God. I should be the one apologizing.” He walked towards the man. “I just can’t keep my hands off of him.” He bit his lip, still sounding embarrassed.
“Greg.” John corrected.
“It’s a new neighbourhood. There is an old couple on the other side of the road but their alibi checks in. The only person that lives there is the victim's boyfriend, but we’re quite positive it wasn’t him. He looked devastated.” Greg explained, looking at John here and then.
He sighed, rubbing his face, hoping that would erase the detective’s face from his mind.
John sighed, his jaw clenching. He wasn’t angry.. well, he didn’t really know
Sherlock nodded, good. He didn’t ruin anything. Everything back to normal.
Molly comforted, making Sherlock smile
“You’re doing it again.” The detective pointed out, sipping his tea without looking at John. Since day one he had noticed the staring, too. It didn’t make him uncomfortable. There were times, though, where Sherlock had called John and he just wouldn’t respond, as if he wasn’t even there.
The man agreed to the dinner and disappeared inside his house.
Yes, she’d really hoped she’d be that person for Sherlock but nobody could compete with John and she was okay with it. It hurt a lot, it was probably the worst heartbreak she’d ever experienced but they had her blessing. Truly.
“I liked it.” Rosie declared, looking at both of them.
“Got anything?” John asked, looking up at the detective.
. Something we haven’t done, going undercover, empty houses. Houses.
John smiled. “I know.” He whispered, walking out of the room.
Rosie hesitated for a moment, not sure if she should ask the question. “Did you give Sherlock a kiss?” But her three year old curiosity got the best of her. She could see the shock in her daddy’s face making her immediately regret going through with it, suddenly wishing she could travel back in time and take it back.
“Mh.” Sherlock muttered. “Tell him we’ll meet him here tomorrow morning.”
Once inside, Sherlock left John’s hand and walked straight to one of the bedrooms. “We have two hours to get ready but I have something to do first.” He said before slamming the door shut. He had been doing that quite a lot recently. John wasn’t sure why.
. He thought, blushing a little. Nrph. “How could you not be in love with this man? He’s the best thing that’s ever happened to me.” Sherlock confessed directly into John’s eyes. Again, if John didn’t know he was acting, he would have thought he was telling the truth.
John thought he’d faint. “What I think..” he began, leaning in. “Is that you need to sleep because you have school tomorrow.” He chuckled at his daughter’s grimace and kissed her cheek.
The detective raised an eyebrow and whispered. “Yes. It’s more believable.” He rolled his eyes and both walked together back to the man.
“A good different.” Sherlock confessed, reassuring Rosie’s fantasies and deep down hoping John wouldn’t notice the accuracy of his statement.
.” Sherlock moaned, his fingers pressing on his back, pulling the man in front of him closer. John moaned back at the contact, feeling his pants growing tighter against his skin. Who’d ever thought he could feel this way for someone of the same sex? Certainly not him.
“Put that cute little apron you have.” Greg suggested, a chuckle escaping from his lips.
They walked in the centre of the room, quietly. Sherlock’s hand went on John’s back hesitantly and the doctor’s hand rested on his shoulder, gripping it slightly. John’s other hand joined Sherlock’s and gasped when the man intertwined their fingers.
“Thank you. I don’t know how long it’ll take. Greg should be here any moment now.” John glanced at his watch.
“To whom?”
“Lestrade!” John grunted, looking up at Sherlock. “It’s been ages. It’s not a hard name to remember!” He complained.
John glanced at Sherlock who had a big smile on his face, then at his daughter. “How do you know we’re going to Scotland Yard?” He furrowed his brows.
Sherlock had never felt that much guilt, he hated it. “John?” He called softly, wanting to fix it.
while doing so.
(See the end of the chapter for
“The shoes are... nice.” John pointed out.
“I have my answer and I’m happy.” Rosie cheered.
The doctor blushed, only thinking of Rosie. “Greg it’s not-” he tried to say turning around.
. Gulped multiple times.
“How are we going to do this?” John asked as they walked. He had to admit he was a little bit nervous. Playing Sherlock’s boyfriend wasn’t something he had ever thought he’d do. John wondered how Mrs. Hudson would react if she knew what they were about to do.
John thought.
“I can’t.”
“She lives with you, are you really questioning it?” John asked back, referring to his and now her skills. “The kiss was for a case, honey. There’s nothing romantic between me and Sherlock.” He said, a little more to himself than his daughter.
John was sitting in front of the detective, not really paying attention to anything but the food on his plate. “Hm.” He began, tasting his meal. “Could you pass the salt, sweetheart?” He asked, extending his hand towards the man. Sherlock froze, his fork dropping on his plate. “What?” John asked, noticing Sherlock’s shocked gaze on him.
“But the kiss me and your dad shared was not a romantic one, it was a-” the detective paused, glancing at John. “A different kind of kiss.” He tried to explain and John’s heart skipped a bit.
“Hi.” Sherlock smiled widely. “I'm Stephen and this is my boyfriend Everett. We just moved here,” he wrapped an arm around John’s waist, pulling him closer, then gazed back at the man. “We thought we’d introduce ourselves and invite you over for dinner tonight, since we’re the only ones in the neighborhood. To know each other.” He explained, his tone sweet and light.
John was carefully tucking Rosie in. His daughter was gazing up at him with wonder in her eyes. “Daddy?” She asked, positioning her hand on his dad’s face. She could see that something was troubling her father, he wasn’t as chatty as usual and that worried her. Rosie didn’t want her dad to be sad.
“Then I’d be alone, again.” He confessed, his eyes saddening.
“But you said he was happy at dinner. What happened?” Rosie asked, her legs swaying from the couch. Sherlock loved her interest in his cases, maybe almost as much as he loved her. The little kid had introduced Sherlock to a new kind of love, different from the one he had for her father.
"I always thought you were incredibly handsome." The detective smiled, mirroring John.
John let out a laugh, finally realizing. “No.” He shook his head. “No way.” Sherlock’s eyes were fixed on John’s face. “Don’t look at me like that. I’m not doing it.”
Sherlock looked down at John and threw his hands in the air. “What’s the matter with my cheekbones? Why do you always have to involve them?” He half-shouted, touching them.
John rolled his eyes but smiled right after. He took a step closer, put himself on his tiptoes and whispered in his ear. “I said,” he began. “That you,” he continued, pecking at his ear lobe. “are..” he added, leaving another kiss on his jaw “so..” he kissed it again, a little lower on his neck. “Hot.”
“I’m Michael by the way. Didn’t have a chance to introduce myself earlier, sorry.”
“Greg. Can I talk to you in private?” Sherlock grabbed the inspector by his arm and dragged him a few meters away from his family. “The kiss wasn’t what you think, please don’t make a big deal out of it.” He finally said, lowering his voice.
He convinced himself to give it a try. He took a deep breath and began to talk. He told Molly everything, from the beginning of their friendship to where they were in that moment. He hesitated a little bit when the topic of his mind palace came out, he decided not to tell her the whole truth. Some things Sherlock wanted to keep for himself. He just told her he had a room for John that he never opened, without giving any detailed explanation on how he felt about it or what happened while he was inside.
he was feeling. “You-” His voice broke. What was happening to him? He was in complete tilt.
Sherlock furrowed his eyebrows. “What was what?”
Ella felt for him. Her heart warmed at how much he cared for Sherlock but was too blind to see it. The fact that he thought he’d be alone, even though he would have his daughter and Molly along with the inspector and Mrs. Hudson only proved that her theory was right. “When Sherlock came back, did you end up telling him what you so desperately wanted to?” John shook his head, a sad smile forming.
"God, Sherlock," John breathes, "I've been dreaming about this, about you. So gorgeous, just look at you." Sherlock moans, low in his chest, surprising himself with his reaction to John's words. John's praises turn into pleas.
“Really, John. This wasn’t a problem last night! Now you suddenly have concerns?!”
“Sh’lock, just get in if you’re tired.” John mumbled sleepily. Sherlock’s mouth dropped open and he blinked, still frozen as John pulled back the covers and then promptly fell asleep again. Everything Sherlock hadn’t realised he wanted, here in front of him, waiting for him to lie down in bed? He couldn’t take advantage of John’s sleep-addled brain, offering nothing more than a comfortable place to rest and yet he couldn’t retreat to the kitchen or the sofa; he wouldn’t get a moment’s peace from thoughts of John.
"Hey, you okay?" John says quietly. I sniff and berate myself for my weakness. Stupid, stupid, stupid, you always were so stupid Sherlock! I turn away from his careful hands, standing up and trying to gather the scraps of my dignity. I pull up my trousers and fasten them. John does the same. Then we are standing in my bedroom on opposite sides of the bed, not looking at each other. This feels wrong, somehow. He should be here, in my arms. I hate it.
"Is this what you had in mind?" John murmurs, pressing his lips into my hair.
Well, it wasn’t as if John had actually harboured any real hopes of having more than a very deep, meaningful friendship with Sherlock. That whole ‘married to the work’ thing had put paid to that over their first dinner. Not that Sherlock actually ate anything then. Not that Sherlock ate much even now, John still coaxed and cajoled and secretly loved it when Sherlock dramatically conceded to Chinese takeaway on the sofa. So good, those nights. Just the two of them, curled up in their chairs reading, or John creasing herself with laughter at Sherlock’s commentary of some crappy movie they’d found on tv, bony feet tucked under John’s bum as they watched from the sofa. As much as John admired and adored case-Sherlock, 221B-Sherlock was actually her favourite.
Sherlock resisted the urge to stick out his tongue. He cleared his throat and gestured down the hall to his bedroom.
I am shaking minutely and squeezing away the hateful tears when John returns. As he tenderly cleans the mess on me with a damp cloth from the bathroom, my control snaps. My face crumples and I rub it into the bedclothes to hide it.
I stub out my cigarette, wrap my coat more tightly around me and step out onto the street. Headed for home. Hollow word that, now. Home.
Sherlock glared at the stranger but felt a stirring of grudging respect. Maybe not so dull as first thought - he was right after all. Sherlock was alone.
John grinned, giving in the the impulse to reach over and stroke his fingers through Sherlock’s hair. Soft, like he’d always thought it’d be. Sherlock arched his back and nudged his head up into John’s hand.
“So,” Sherlock agrees. They lapse into silence once more. Sherlock drums his fingers nervously against his cup, still deliberately not watching as John raises his to his (lovely) lips to take a sip. John catches him and Sherlock flushes, looking down and forcing his fingers to still. He can feel the smile spreading across John’s face.
"Yes," I breathe, refusing to acknowledge any blushing my face might be doing.
Oh John. How do you do it? I wish I knew so that I could do it too, for you.
"Oh God Sherlock, I want that too," he panted. "Um, gonna need, um, lube?"
I’ve already made my choice. I made my decision almost instantly. He has to die. There is no other way. I will be the one to do it. I have made John carry too many of my burdens, he will not carry this one. This mistake is mine, and mine alone.
I hear him speaking to John as they walk out onto the patio. Mycroft shouldn't be far behind. I surreptitiously check my watch. Late. Of all the times for him to be late. Nothing for it now.
"I'm fine," he said, hoping his tone was somewhat lighter than he currently felt.
“Of course they started it, John!” he said, throwing his hands up in exasperation. “Obvious!”
John gaped. A tutor?! He didn't need a tutor, he just needed a bit of time to catch up and he'd be fine.
It's curious, Sherlock thinks, that John would choose to smile at him. Granted, John is friendly with everyone but he surely must know of Sherlock's reputation as a cold, acerbic arsehole. The only person they have in common is Mike Stamford, who, while he is wonderfully kind, is under no illusions of just how much of a freak Sherlock is. Mike would surely have told John about that thing with the beakers and the professor's blouse. And the time with the acid and the ostrich egg. And the- yes alright, Sherlock snaps at his own mind. There may not have been any explosions at university but Sherlock has certainly made an impression on the academic staff. Not necessarily a positive one.
John got out his own book and flicked to the page they’d been studying. He looked back up to see Sherlock watching him closely again. Undaunted, John stuck out his hand. A tiny line appeared between Sherlock’s brows as he frowned slightly, his eyes drawn down to John’s outstretched hand.
"He's gone," John said matter-of-factly.
Sherlock frowned and looked even more puzzled. He scowled at the table silently, then said:
I blink and peer at the gravel beneath my feet. I’m still wearing the clothes and shoes I had on when I boarded the plane. Seems ridiculous so that so much can have happened since then.
“Sherlock said Greg’s name and you suddenly grabbed your coat.. it’s five in the afternoon so the only place you could find him right now is Scotland Yard.” She explained, as if it was the most obvious thing in the world.
The taller one cleared his voice and a few moments later John’s gaze moved to the ground. “Right.” John muttered and kept walking towards ‘their’ house.
The house John and Sherlock were in was already furnished. The couple had got their goods brought in so the boys just had to pretend it was all theirs. Lestrade had left them alone, placed a few cameras and microphones around the house and wished them good luck.
“How did they die?” The doctor asked, one arm supporting the other on his stomach as his fingers rested on his chin.
John questioned him with his eyes and Sherlock bit the inside of his cheek. “I’m sorry.” He continued as his hands went on the smaller one’s shirt lapels.
Sherlock followed Michael’s movements and positioned himself next to the room’s door, closing his eyes.
He looked at the clothes that the taller man had provided and winced. That shirt would have looked tight on him.
Sherlock noticed the man. Red eyes, runny nose, messy hair.
Molly listened carefully to Sherlock. She was aware of the fact that if she didn’t let him speak he’d stop, perhaps changing his mind about it, so she just listened without making any sound. Letting him spill it all, safely.
"Mh.."
. Sherlock groaned loudly and pressed one foot to the ground.
That was one of the reasons why John whispered an “Okay.” And grabbed Sherlock’s hand in his.
way.” He shook his head, standing up.
The detective’s hands ran up and down the doctor’s back, sinking his fingers in, wanting the contact of his skin with John’s. Feeling so helpless and vulnerable, he parted for just a second. He wanted to look at his partner in the eyes, wanted to know if he was the only one in that state, deduced he wasn't. Sherlock crashed their lips together again. This time he added a little more, letting himself go just a bit.
Every time John closed his eyes, Sherlock’s hands were back on his shirt, pulling him with strength against that column and kissing the air out of him.
John didn’t have to hear it twice and crashed his lips on Sherlock’s. God, it was the most satisfying thing he’d ever done. He loved his taste, the way his arms were holding him. His whole body on fire, he just didn’t want it to end. John was overwhelmed by a wave of passion and lust that he didn’t care it was for a man and that that man was the one he’d always seen as a friend.
“What are you doing?” John asked, looking at their hands as his heart did a flip.
Sherlock’s stomach contracted at the word but he tried to hide it with a nod. “He’s the best.” He agreed, gesticulating at the man in a whispery voice. “C’mon, just for a couple of hours then we’ll let you go.” Sherlock promised.
His cheeks were soaking wet at that point.
behind.
Sherlock hated the wait. His fingers started pinching the cords of his instrument, mentally writing down a few notes.
John nodded, warmed by the statement. He opened his mouth but before he could properly respond the doorbell rang. He rubbed his hands and walked to open the door with a smile.
John nodded and went to sit down. “Thanks.” He grinned, turning on the telly.
“We wouldn’t have to kiss or anything. I can do most of the work, you can sit silently if you want.” Sherlock begged. “This is a good case, John!” He tried to convince him, his arms going to his friend’s, squeezing them.
Golden engraved bracelet.
“Yeah, I must have.” John gulped, embarrassed.
kind of different. John was used to women’s skin, delicate and smooth but didn’t mind the detective’s either. He could feel the soft harsh of his beard, even though it wasn’t yet visible, and of course, he had stronger features.
At first Sherlock’s lips were kissing the doctor’s in a slow and soft way, then with a swift gradation of intensity, it became wetter, louder as Sherlock’s mouth was eagerly parting John’s lips. Soon John realized that he was kissing the detective back.
“Do you think he-” John began, running a hand through his hair.
. Hand Loosening his tie knot.
Both didn’t know what that evening would mean for them, but they couldn't wait to figure it out.
After properly changing her and putting her to bed, the detective walked in the living room where he found John standing with his phone in his hand. “Problems?” He asked, hovering him to look.
The curly-haired man shook his head, trying to make everything go away. “Stop..” He whined.
. Mycroft called. “I can’t.” The detective mumbled as his fingers were tugging his hair ends.
He thought, abandoning himself in the kiss. “God, you’re so hot.” John praised as Sherlock pecked his bottom lip.
John tilted his head to the right just slightly, grazing Sherlock’s lips with his. The detective let out a low sound at the almost contact. “Stop teasing me.” He whined, squeezing John’s bum with his hands. The doctor gasped at the touch and tone, leaving Sherlock the chance to finally take John’s mouth with his.
John smiled briefly at Rosie and then started looking for Greg with his eyes. It didn’t take long because two strong hands wrapped around the guys, pulling them together. “Hello there, smoochies.”
"Please, Sherlock, let me be alone for a few days." He sighed. "I need to think."
"Are you serious?" He glanced the bouquet of rose in Sherlock's hand. "I agreed to the dinner, but it's not a date." John cleared the situation while he stepped back to the flat to put the roses into a vase.
"She could have lost it."
"I'm your landlady, not your housekeeper."
"I know your instincts tells you, you should take care of me, but I'm not your alpha. I don't looking forward a relationship, I'm married to my work."
Sherlock didn't gave her phone back, so one average day, when they arrived home, they found a sleeping Irene Adler in the genius's bed. John sucked a harsh breath but didn't say anything.
"Stop it!" Sherlock yelled.
'My John is nervous. Stand up, cuddle him! Cuddle and scent him, it would calm him.' But Sherlock stayed motionless.
"I love you too, Sherlock." John muttered.
"What about Moriarty?"
"I understand." John said gently as he stroked Sherlock's hair. "I'm still sure we should give a try. So if you would pick up your lazy butt, we could arrange the shopping, to be ready to your rut."
John was silent, but Sherlock felt, he is restless.
"The usual stuff."
The restaurant's owner, named Angelo appeared at their table.
"I will remember this." John turned his back at Sherlock and left.
The game continued with a new puzzle and a with a new hostage. Sherlock was on the case in his every minute, while secretly he also got close to Bruce-Partington project. John's gonna like this.
"Well, the older one did. But Sherlock helped me to get rid of from my enemy, so I can come back to you."
"John..." He said his name softly. His own eyes fixed on John's lips. He leaned closer. First his nose touched the doctor's, his warm breath danced on his cheek while his hand wandered from his blogger's chin to his nape and the other to his hip. John breath was cut off. Sherlock's lips found his. It was tentative and gentle, not tongue or teeth involved. He stroked his face with his long fingers, while also kissed the good doctor's eyebrows and temple. His doctor... Sherlock propped his forehead to John's. They stayed that way for a while.
People have said it before. Of course they have. People are idiots. So full of sentiment and so determined to smear their own illogical emotions all over other people, as though feelings are viral particles and if they only exude enough they’re bound to be catching. Three – no, four – people have told Sherlock they loved him, mostly during sex, when people seem almost pathologically incapable of shutting up and focusing on the enjoyable physical sensations that are the entire point of the exercise. One man Sherlock had picked up in a gay club near Soho and hooked up with between cases for close to three months – longer than normal, that had been his mistake – had even interrupted a rather nice blow job to say it. He’d got quite upset when Sherlock had rolled his eyes and urged him to focus. So why didn’t Sherlock want to roll his eyes when John said it? Is it because they’re colleagues? Flatmates? Friends? No. Stupid. Why would that change anything? It doesn’t make sense.
"The sergeant has just been explaining everything. The two pills. Dreadful business, isn't it?"
"He is an alpha John! You can't go with him."
"I understand, dear, I've got a hip." She went to the kitchen and John started to read the newspaper Mrs. Hudson left on the table.
"Why the hell would Sherlock..."
"People do little else." They smiled at each other when a disturbing voice interjected.
"I am clean!"
"Why would she scratched her name on the floor with her fingernails? She was dying, it took effort, it would have hurt."
Sherlock examined the envelope.
Sherlock went back to the couch.
Moriarty listened Stayin' alive from  Bee Gees, when Sherlock arrived.
"Come on, Sherlock!" John kissed him slowly, he opened the alpha's plump lisp with his tongue.
"No." Sherlock get closer to her and touched her wrist again. "Because I took your pulse, elevated" whispered to her ear. "Your pupils dilated." He took her phone. "I imagine John Watson thinks love is a mystery to me but chemistry is incredibly simple and very distractive. When we first met, you said disguise is always a self-portrait. How to review the combination to your safe your measurements, yes, I knew. But this is far more intimate. This is your heart and you should never let it rule your head." As I would never let John rule my heart, I just can't. "You could have chosen any random number and walked out of here with everything you've worked for. You just couldn't resist  it, could you? I've always assumed that love is a dangerous disadvantage. Thank you for the final proof."
"I see there is nothing wrong with your ego. It's huge, like always."
Later, he started to work with the Scotland Yard, as a consulting detective. It helped him to keep his feelings in check.
"It wasn't me. It was my alpha. And sorry if I do not find pleasure in a sight of an aging man bare, wounded body."
The doctor didn't move. He didn't even blink. He looked horrified.
'He is sad. I knew he will be. You are useless after all.' The alpha inside him was very vigorous.
As John packed the food they bought, he wondered it wouldn't have been better if he had let Sherlock's alpha bite him. John wanted to wait with the bonding - besides it had to happen with Sherlock's permission - because it was more successful and stronger if it happened during a heat. The bite out of heat caused pseudo heat, and although bonding was still possible, it wasn't natural.
" So another case cracked. How very public spirited. Though that's never really your motivation, is it?" He talked to Sherlock, they clearly knew each other.
"What do you mean? An organisation? What?"
"We will move back to our room, and I'm gonna do so much filthy things with you... You can not imagine."
"I am with you. Why would I?"
"It's dangerous, Sherlock." His brother told him.
John was standing in the kitchen with his feet rooted to the ground. He made a tea when a heavy smell hit his nose. Sherlock stood in the living room, naked, his cock proudly erected. His eyes were yellow.
"When we first met, you knew everything about me."
"I knew it would. I slept with your jumper when I was away."
Okay. The text is dense again. I'm sorry, but I didn't want to change it in the middle of the story, it would be queer. But if I'll write a new story, it will be more space between the lines :)
"How come I can see you, I don't even want to."
"It wont happening." Answered John.
"Mrs. Hudson! I thought you went to your sister!"
"Learn to, cuz I owe you for sure."
"You think?"
"Sherlock! What have you done?"
"Let me encourage you! If you wouldn't, my assassin will kill your precious omega."
"Irene?" The alpha blinked. Seemed he don't remember The Woman at all. "Are you jealous, my John?" He cocked his head. "You are my omega." He licked the tears from John's eyes.
"I have been reliably informed that I don't have one."
"No." He exhaled.
"It's a drug bust."
"Cardiff?" Lestrade pushed further.
"Please!" He rarely used that word.
Sherlock was also on his feet, while wiped his nose.
"Careful!" John checked the phone.
He grabbed his omega's bottom, and trusted between his legs firmly. John mewled in ecstasy.
"Here, use mine." The short man offered his own. That was Sherlock wanted. The man came closer, and gave Sherlock his phone.
'Than do what I say!'
"That's it love! So good!" He praised John.
"That doesn't matter, just a hostage. It's not a trace, useless."
"How did you know about Afghanistan?"
"Once you told me, you are not a hero, but you were the wises and best man I knew. And nobody can convince me you are lied. That's all. I was so lonely, I own you so much! I only wish you wouldn't be dead!" He broke up with tears.
Sherlock burst out with cheering.
John face was red with rage like a turkey.
"No." Mike made a wondering face, but didn't pushed further. "You know I was in the army. What's new with you?"
"I've played four times. I'm alive. It's not chance Mr. Homes, it's chess. With one move, one survivor."
"I was sure, you'll be good for my brother."
"Before you met with Sherlock, you considered your own suicide. If you did, you would never known him. I know you see everything in dark now, but good things will wait for you, if you give yourself time." Good things? What good things? John looked at Mycroft as he would be crazy. "I remind you I have cameras in the flat. I recommend you don't do any stupid. Oh, and don't mind search after your gun."
"Tell him! Tell him the truth! It's over now." Said Moriarty. Sherlock radiated with rage. "Don't touch me!"
"We were together more than a year."
John felt his alpha licked and nipped the skin of his inner thigh. His cock hardened. Sherlock licked the tip of it.
"What else can happen?" Grumped John as he fiddled with his keys.
"Aneurism. Right in here." He pointed to his head. " Any breath could be my last."
"Turn back John! On your stomach."
"I think it was rather sexy."
John was sitting naked on the toilet. Sherlock didn't tolerated clothes. They were unclad all day. Sherlock was  unbelievably clingy. He followed John everywhere.
"I gladly see, you are well, Dr Watson. I have a new case for you."
John giggled, and  Sherlock's chest swelled. He was in big trouble.
"Evening! What a surprise, isn't is Sherlock?"
"Someone who is young and important to the royal family."
"Shup up everybody!" shouted Sherlock. "Don't speak, don't breath. I'm trying to think!
"I'm..."
"You are welcome."
"You know how they never leave notes. Well, this one did. Will you come?"
"As if there wasn’t enough complication in my life." Grumbled John under his nose.
Soon an excited, grey haired man appeared in their flat.
"I'm sure it is all right, just mourning." MH
John clung to his black coat as he slept. Perhaps he had a bad dream again. So Sherlock carefully lay down next to him and spooned John from behind. The doctor didn't woke up, but he stopped sobbing.
"Dinner?"
"Use nicotine patch. Helps me think."
I have a past, you maybe wouldn't understand. Besides you have your own future. I accepted that.
The doctor cupped his face and kissed his lips. Sherlock sighed relieved.
John ran his fingers into his black curls, while with his other hand sent a text to Mycroft.
"Be good to me!"
"My alpha healed you." Sherlock said, and his heart sank even more.
Sherlock gently lifted John's head to his chest.
"Molly, and few people of my homeless network."
"I want to kiss you!" He searched his lips.
John woke up from a terrible nightmare. He saw Sherlock in blood again, lifeless. But Sherlock is alive, isn't he? He was there, wasn't he?
Before John could realize what is happening, Sherlock threw him on the giant bed and lay on top of him. He licked into the doctor's mouth immediately and rubbed his groin to the other man's. John moaned loudly, raised his hips, totally forgot he should protest. The pleasure was so intense, he could cry. This was Sherlock, his alpha, the man he loved. He still loves him. Of course he loves him. He would always loves him, now and forever, no matter what would happen or what he would do... The bastard!
"Of course she had a suitcase. Someone else was here, and took it. So the killer must have driven here. Forgot the case was in the car."
"I'm not worried. You left me in Brixton!" John seemed angry.
"Want me to continue? Ask nicely!" He whispered to his ears.
"I talking to myself John."
"You said, you have cameras! You see, he is not okay!" Shouted John. He started to undressing. He has to warming up Sherlock with his body heat, it would be more helpful, than blankets. In the end, both of them was naked. John lay on Sherlock, stroking his hair while covered his face with soft kisses.
"Tell him you're alive." He hated this, but if Sherlock would feel better, that's the way.
"I think you're damaged, delusional and believe in higher power. In your case it's yourself." Brilliant, John would say. This woman is stunning. "Somebody loves you. If I had to punch that face I'd avoid your nose and teeth too." Oh, John.
"I do not expecting anything, I just hoping."
It's been two years. Felt like forever without Sherlock. At first his smell was felt on his clothes, furniture, especially on his leather chair. It comforts John a little. But now nothing remained after him. John packed all of Sherlock's stuff in big boxes, even the skull.
"How?" Sherlock didn't answered so Mrs. Hudson interrupted.
"Lying on you is very good, indeed." Sherlock's voice became serious. "Okay, let's try. But swear to me, if I try to hurt you..."
"I hope so." Sherlock said uncertain.
"Forget that bad woman, John!" He snarled showing his fangs. "She means nothing to me! But you... you will never leave me again!"
"Why didn't I think of that?"
"By looking."
"I would like to give so much more to you." John whispered into Sherlock's neck.
"I did. Told Mike this morning that I must be a difficult man to find a flatmate for." You? Difficult? I'll rather live with a three headed giant dog. Watson wasn't sure where all this is goes out. "Now here he is just after lunch with an old friend clearly just home from military service in Afghanistan. Wasn't a difficult leap."
"Shower, then bed. Right?"
"She is dead." She sent her phone to him, this was the only explanation.
"Piss off"
In that moment it was a big show for John. Sherlock knew Moriarty wanted to uncertain his friend, his mate, his omega. It would broke him, if John would left, because he believed what Jim Moriarty told him.
"I can't help him. I don't have smell what the alpha could react."
"And if he don't want me anymore?" This option didn't turned in his head till now.
"It's a drug bust" John told her.
Sherlock lay on him again, peppered his face with kisses.
The Woman started to read aloud her texts she wrote to Sherlock, while John tried to cover his hurt feelings.
Sherlock stroked his scalp with his fingertips, he went on his back down to the bottom. John's mouth was shut hard, he waited to the penetration. He was dry. It won't do any good. Than he felt a gentle tongue licked into his hole.
"Congratulations, Dr Watson!" He read the letter. "Or may I call you brother-in-law? Unfortunately Sherlock's sex education is very incomplete, but don't worry. His alpha knows exactly what to do. ;)"
"Oh, for my suicide."
"Don't make heroes from people. There are no heroes, in spite of that I'm not one of them."
Sherlock looked at John. He pondered on their chances.
"You chose the flavour."
Before John could tell something, Sherlock sealed his mouth with a kiss.
The distance is gone in that moment when John jumped at Sherlock so suddenly.
"Friend of mine. When I say friend..."
With love, Mary
"Asphyxiation, probably. Passed out, choked on her own vomit. It could have been a seizure. Possibly drugs."
"He would come after me."
"Everything a said it's not real. I just played the game." Her eyes were wet with tears.
"I support the idea."
"Yes, he is allways like that."
"It wasn't sure I can come back alive."
Mike Stamford? His old buddy. How the hell he knows he is here? He put the gun down.
"Irene Adler is not my brother's omega."
"No you won't!"
"I made the right thing. Why are you angry?" He frowned." It's about him, isn't it? You put me in the corner because of him!"
Sherlock grabbed his hair.
Mycroft would never risked John's wellbeing of course, but he also would never let his little brother be unhappy because of a beta woman.
"I never will be separated from you again!"
"I don't. I just like to watch them all competing. Aren't ordinary people adorable? Well you know, you've got John."
"You keep me safe. You are brave, honest, loyal. I'm not alone with you. You are my home. My only friend, my everything. My chest feels warm, when you are around." Sherlock slid his finger down on John's shoulder to his old bullet wound.
"Are you okay?" John stood at his room's entrance.
"I wasn't with anyone, especially not during a rut. Please go away."
"Hello Dr. Watson."
Moriarty didn't bothered himself, he sat on Sherlock's armchair.
"Come here!" Sherlock laid his head on John's lap. "I had no smell. Remember? But you healed me."
'You did the same with me, so watch me!'
"Are the police try to trace the phone?" John paced nervously.
"Of course. I also need it."
"I just need to talk about the rent."
Sherlock knew the doctor needs time, but he couldn't hide the growing feeling of belonging in his stomach.
"Oh, my God!" John paled as he saw Sherlock's form up on the building. "What's going on?"
John wanted to tell so many things to Sherlock, he didn't know where to start.
"I didn't compliment."
"He loves you John, he wants you the best."
"Where is she now?" asked John. Sherlock, who avoided his blogger naked chest's sight, now looked at him.
"It's not a game, it's chance."
Sherlock squeezed him aggressively, his arm hurt. He knew Sherlock started to panic, and John decided put and end of it.
"Whoa! I don't..." John touched the bridge of his nose. " It's not my instincts. Maybe I'm not functioning well as an omega, but I'm a doctor, and as a doctor, I tell you..."
"Who would notice me?"
"You all right?" He took the parka off from John with rapid movements and tossed it far away from them. "Are you all right?" He desperately asked him again. It costed all of his self control to not scenting or petting John right there.
"I really don't have more time to chat."
"Right."
"Yes, great conclusion."
"I want to be with you. For an alpha and omega couple is important to being together."
They ordered from the menu.
"My alpha wants to thank you." Course, his alpha... John cut a sour face.
"So you manipulated me!"
"Thank you." The grey haired man bowed his head, and left in a hurry.
"I know. And this is just loosing." He showed her what he typed into the phone, what was the code. I am Sherlocked. He gave the phone to his brother. "Kept the contents make up for any inconvenience I may occurred you tonight."
"So, the shooter. No sign?"
"What good is it for?" Frowned John.
Sherlock closed his eyes, breathing in his lover's smell, he felt secure, at least for now.
Sherlock didn't answer, he stood like a statue, but he didn't take his eyes off John.
"Sorry, it is in my coat." Mike said, and Sherlock of course, knew it.
"Because it's easy, right?"
"You are much more than just your brain. You groomed John like a good mate. You took him to your own bed, take his clothes off, take your clothes off, and warmed him with your own naked body all night." Sherlock was poppy red. It wasn't enough he didn't remembered any of this, his brother witnessed his actions. "I know you don't want my advice, but you should let your alpha to do few things it wants, in return, it won't take the lead. It's compromise."
Mycroft leaned forward to see into his brother's eyes from close.
"It's not your business! If you want to be useful, take Sherlock's stuffs away. Mrs. Hudson don't have space for them."
