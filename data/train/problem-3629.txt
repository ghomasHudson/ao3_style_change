“So if we can make good on that promise, make sure that the empty gets what it wants that’s good right?”
He makes his way to the equipment shed. The gig sits right at the front of the shed so it's easy enough to grab. He wheels it slowly behind him with a hand on each of the shafts as he walks to the stables.
“Is she pushing for you to get married before you can go to school? I would think that setting yourself up and being supported should come before a wedding, no?”
The work goes quickly, she wasn’t near hot enough to need a walk out and she trusts him enough to not fuss or fight against what he’s doing. By the time he’s cleaning the tack the sun has hidden itself almost completely behind the horizon line wrapping the earth in soft orange and gentle blue as he tracks his eyes away from the ground towards the stars that are beginning to show themselves.
Occurrences similar to the hand on his back was nearly commonplace by the time he was healed up, and as much as Dean savoured it, it was equally as maddening as he’d still never said a word on any of it. Not that Dean had either, but he figured that Cas held more power in their dynamic and therefore didn't want to endanger himself by acting on an impulse that only continued to grow.
He had begun to relax, not calm down per se but his muscles started to untense and his jaw had finally released when an evil lightbulb went off in his head.
The rest of his day is spent with Charles, his nerves dissipate as the day stretches, shadows growing long on the dirt, by day end he has been taken through the mornings and afternoons for all the animals and been tested on his ability to groom the horses, although he wasn’t asked to do hoof or shoe work; he suspects that will be asked of him tomorrow.
Luckily for Castiel dinner continues without much further mention of his relationship status and as he’s saying goodnight to his youngest siblings he stops in his room; he pauses to listen for any sounds of his family before taking his flask out and swallowing a healthy shot. He tucks the still cool metal into his pocket, figuring that if he’s had a lifetime of his ma’s cooking and still sometimes needs the liquor to wash it down the newcomer will likely need it too. It's only as he’s heading out to the barn does he realize he is still in his supper clothes. He debates for a moment about going in and changing but settles on carrying on to the barn.
He doubts he’ll ever be ready to leave, always another milestone around the corner, another memory to be part of, another smile or laugh or hug or tear to wipe from a reddened face. But at some point, he knows he has to let go. He also knows that right now is that time for him. He knows he’ll mourn, likely won’t ever stop, forever aware of what he’s missing. But staying means giving in and that’s something he can’t do. Staying means eventually leaving anyways, at least with this choice he will get to live as he wants.
Dean turns minutely, keeping an eye on the man in front of him while trying to search out Cas.
“Sorry, I have no reason to doubt you in that regard, but ‘Cassie’? He told me to call him Cas.” There is a familiar warmth that runs down his spine when he thinks of the familiarity that the nickname suggests, Dean can see in his sly smile that Gabriel is not unaware of that familiarity.
There was nothing further from the truth, he whittled his way through Dean’s walls because no matter what, he couldn't imagine Dean not being the focus of such intense regard in his mind. He isn't sure why it fills him with the guilt that it does, he knows it wasn't true, he knows that he was protecting himself and by extension Dean as well by lying to his father but it stills makes him feel like a fraud.
“C’mon Cas,” he stutters out, glad that he's made no comment on the memory. “Your turn, what's your happiest memory?”
? Had Dean really just called him Sir? What the hell caused that.
“Dean. Are you in the stables? Dean!”
It’s over as fast as it began, Dean’s shirt sways from its quick drop and the trail of Cas’ fingers feels red hot and completely cold along his skin. He knows his face is flushed, he can feel it curl around his neck and disappear beneath his freshly donned shirt. The heat in his body doesn't stop there, it sprouts in his chest when he’s unable to remember a time when someone was that gentle with his broken body. And most unfortunately heat curls itself round in his groin. With a brief shift of his hips he realizes he’s nearly half hard in his trousers, glad for the fact that his shirt covers his crotch.
His eyes are dark, hooded by his brows, and the glow of his lantern does little to light them in the darkness of the barn. But he wants to see them, to know if they have the same all-consuming nature as the rest of the man does.
“What did you want to be when you were a child?”
A few days on this property, a hot meal, possibly a place to sleep in exchange for some labour work, is a risk for sure, but it’s also a necessity. He foolishly left with no food or water and has no way of knowing how long he’ll be walking before he finds another place to settle.
Cas wakes up he’ll want a nip or four of the whiskey, when, in his periphery he sees the two men. A second later he’s jogging over to their bodies. One of them—Alastair—landed face up, his blank eyes staring unseeing into the sky.
He’s in the paddock when Cas comes to see him. Some kids are still playing, others are sitting with a book or a slate instead. The young woman seems to have no issue keeping a handle on the children, still full of energy and chasing them sporadically as they squeal.
He tells them again and again, he’s proud of them, that he loves them, that he wants the best for them, wants them to find what makes them happy.
He pauses, his attention drawn to a bat weaving its way through the night air and catches sight of the barn. He can see the gentle swaths of light as they bleed through the still open door onto the packed-down dirt that surrounds the barn, like it does for each of the buildings on the property. He stops at the window, his mind briefly registers that this is the same window that he first spotted Dean out of, he smiles and tries to see if he can catch a glimpse of the man now. He knows it's highly likely that Dean’s already turned in for the night, lord knows he should have as well.
“Speaking of, shouldn't he be here by now?” Sam asks with a quick look around the room.
. And not for the first time, Dean finds himself desperately trying not to read into that at all. After all, it’s easy to misspeak, it doesn't mean that Cas is opposed to women.
every step causing another wave of pain down to the soles of his foot.
And so he helps, he spends hours writing out tables for them to follow, rules of grammar and spelling. Charts with the sun and the planets and what it means to be kind to others. He leaves behind words of encouragement and love; he puts some of his favourite books into the room with all of his scribbled notes and an inscription inside each of them. He tries to leave some sort of legacy.
“I think we should move to machine tack for Ibby soon, that will, for the most part, be his role here, on occasion he’ll be used for riding but only if Pa is in need of it,” Cas says as they move again from the shed, his knowledge of the equipment much improved. “It will also allow you to become more familiar with the machines and buggies.”
Then again, Dean seems to be understanding that just fine himself considering the job he’s just accepted, and the fact that he embraced the name Castiel had offered.
Dean has no clue what Cas is doing, but who is he to stop him if he needs to use the bathroom.
“I want to learn,” Cas says without prompting, looking just past him, “I want to go off to school, or even to a job, and just be more than a farmer's son.” Cas sounds as though he's lost in another world, where he has all that he wants and he knows that feeling well; sometimes that feeling is all that keeps him sane.
“I’m sure,” Dean says, cutting him off. “I’ll manage just fine by myself.”
Sleep evades him for some time as his mind betrays him, straying to Cas and the signals he got from the man, as sure as they were hesitant.
He had been walking to the bunker's kitchen for a late night snack of just about anything at this point thinking that with the other thems off to bed and it being well past meeting hours, he would clearly not be interrupted by the other him in the entrance hall to the kitchen.
“I did everything I could to get him out, I tried everything I knew how to do, but it wouldn't budge. It wanted a soul for its taking, it said it was the only way,” Cas stopped, his breathing short and in truth concerning in its raggedness. “Dean it was the only thing I could do, the only way I could save our son, I made it a deal. My life, my eternity spent in its grips for his life, his ability to go home and back to you and Sam.”
He looks at Dean once he’s done and sees warring emotions cloud his face. Scrunching his brow, he looks at him longer, but past excitement and trepidation Castiel isn't able to place anything.
“Isn’t the friend supposed to first ask for the help, rather than it being forced upon them?” he shoots back, annoyed with how thoroughly Cas refuses to drop this conversation.
“Just, don't fall over while I run ahead to get my ma, okay can you manage that Dean?”
Dean makes it within ten yards when Cas and his ma exit the house. In her arms is a decently sized chest which he hopes has some medical supplies.
The night before their first lesson was the night they had learned of Hannah’s condition; the dam had broken within him and his soul felt lighter than it had in some time after telling Winchester all that he had. And in turn his heart felt weighed down from the stories he had received back. It solved nothing for either of them but it was a catharsis he hadn’t known he needed. He let himself bleed in ways no one else had seen and he came out on the other side on his way to better, he only hoped the conversation had worked the same for Winchester.
“I didn’t know that, thank you for telling me. You know when I was about your age, I didn’t know how to ride horses either. Someday you’ll be able to, maybe even better than I can,” Dean says conspiratorially. He looks up at Cas and sees the soft awed look on his face as he continues to interact with his siblings.
Whirling around he saw Cas, leaning up against the entryway to the kitchen.
“Maybe so,” he concedes slowly. “Come to bed,” Cas whispers against his lips, the gentle tickle making him shudder.
“Heavier than it looks huh?” Dean asks with a smirk. Everyone's first time with a gun in their hands is the same, his too. Granted he was seven and his father started him with a rifle even earlier than that, but even when he was allowed to switch to a pistol the weight threw him.
“I came out here to say, I’m not going to hurt either of you by exposing your relationship, but Dean, if you hurt my brother, I will do everything in my power to protect him. The only way that doesn't happen is if he begs for me not to, and while my brother is kinder than he should be I’m not sure he is that kind.”
“Dean, let me take you in my mouth,” he pleads, the need to have the weight of his length in his mouth outweighing any sense of not seeming too desperate.
By some saving grace, his mother is far too involved with his siblings' return to bring up any woman she’s heard is single. It excites him for the days ahead, knowing with more certainty that his siblings would draw the attention away from him.
“I don’t know, probably some horse shit for me,” he gets a one breath laugh, nearly a pity laugh but he takes it, before he switches gears. “Whatever it brings, I know that we’ll be able to handle it.”
Our first Cas chapter!! I hope you enjoyed this look into his life and all the craziness of a full household.
During the first days, he thought his eyes must have been brown, possibly so dark brown they looked black, beautiful in their boundless depth and he knew they would be easy to fall into, like the curtain of nightfall and its inky hold on the heavy eyelids as waking hours turn into silence and peace. In the clouded light of the day, his eyes were shadowed, darkened by his brow. He knew that whatever they looked like there must be a deepness to the colour, but he hadn’t been able to get close enough to see it.
“I just wanted to make sure that when Michael and all of them get back, that you won’t forget to spend time with me,” Hannah says looking down at her twisting fingers.
It’s not necessarily an outward claim that he desires, it's always been too risky to mark any of his partners or be marked by them. What he wants is for Dean to feel it, for Dean to know of the claim laid upon him and, because he can’t have that, he settles. He wonders what claiming a man destined to leave really accomplishes, nevertheless he does it.
Cas is shaking above Dean as he lowers his weight fully on him, though he soon shifts down to lie beside Dean on the dirt.
When the haze dissipates Dean is standing in front of him looking oddly bashful. Taking a chance, he leans in again and catches Dean’s soft lips in a tender kiss. A gentle whimper makes its way out of his parted lips as he pulls back, Dean doesn’t seem like he’s done as he leans back in, catching the back of Castiel’s neck with his hand to keep him close.
Cas, why would you do this, no wait you just explained that didnt you, fuck,” he had his hands gripped in his hair as he fought the tears that threated to roll down his face. “Cas what am I supposed to do without you, how am I supposed to watch you get taken and know that it's
It’s regret, and anger and sorrow; it’s confusion and frustration and an emptiness that he’d long ago gotten acquainted with, it's a confirmation of everything he already knew and it tears into him.
Dean sets back to work, not wanting to be caught staring at the group. As he makes his way back from the barn the sounds of laughter waft through the air and he's reminded of Sam, playing with his friends in the streets carefree and happy.
“I may be in town tomorrow. If I am you’ll be alone to work on the farm, my pa doesn’t like the idea because you’re still learning but we don't have many options currently with Hannah still ill. I hope I won’t be in town for too long as the farm isn't supposed to be left unmanned as it were in case someone was to come looking for my pa. With him gone that duty falls to me and if I'm off the property for long and someone was to stop by neither of us is sure exactly what would happen.”
Castiel pauses and frowns. He is disappointed at Dean’s words, but more than that, Dean’s behaviour seems different than what he has known. Castiel can’t figure out why, but for a brief moment, he feels panic rush cold through his blood and is certain that Dean knows about last night. Almost as immediately as it came on, it abides; there was no way for Dean to know about his conversation with his father, and it would perjure himself greatly to ask Dean if there was something wrong, or even specifically ask him if he’d overheard something. He figures that Dean must just be having an off day.
A part of him has shut down in the wake of the incident and everything he does seems to be mechanical, as though he’s separated from his body, going through the motions but not actually doing them.
His story won’t ever be told, his life will never be written in books, and when he dies, it dies with him and he knows that that might be sooner rather than later. To be known, to be seen and found in more than just his own mind is tempting.
If he'd been more present in the moment he could have told Cas that his form was the reason his shots were going wide. Not a single one had managed to hit the target yet and Dean could tell that Cas was getting annoyed with the lack of results.
“Ya just about,” Dean shifts Cas’ left hand just a bit. The movement causes him to completely encircle Cas with his arms and for a moment all he can do is close his eyes and breath, trying to ignore the heat that ignites low in his abdomen. “Okay you’re set, slow deep breaths, and you should be good.” He steps back.
Cas helps him slide his arm into his shirt sleeve, then his head, staying silent the entire time. It's unnerving, for the first time in a while Dean feels uncomfortable in Cas’ presence. Maybe the scars are too much for him, it’s easy to ignore his past when you are faced with it so gruesomely.
Their mouths hover, open, inches apart, slotting their lips together seems an impossible task and so they gasp and pant heavily into the space between them, eyes roaming each other's face.
“So you want to leave?”
It feels odd to him that he’s become the person that he used to either try to steal from, bet against, or work for, during the few nights they’ve spent in the towns. Cas seems to not find it at all out of the ordinary. Then again this has more or less always been his life.
In all this planning Dean hadn’t even considered the fact that the empty might not allow Cas to leave and his stomach threatens to empty itself when it sinks in how likely it is that Cas might be trapped for an entirely other reason.
Dean circles his hole, warming the jelly and relaxing the muscle, he teases himself and Cas with the slowness of his movements and he feels so empowered to have Cas staring at him dumbstruck.
He keeps his path and walks onto the property moving slower than before. The possibility of rest and shelter weighs down his bones and makes his steps heavier, like they know he doesn’t have to rush so much anymore. His limbs feel leaden as he thinks of the nearing ability to sit and relax, and most importantly, to eat.
“Well we were managing just fine before, and now with the fixes the boy did, we should have no issue going back to how it was here,” his father says simply.
are safe, nothing is coming to take us away from each other anymore.”
Jody is about to launch into some discussion with them but her face lights up and she turns to face Donna’s retreating form.
“I just mean, I’ve taught my brothers and sisters, and I don't mean to offend but, you would be at the same level as they were when I did so. It makes sense that if you had a want for it, I could help you learn how to read and write a bit, we still have all the supplies, books and the like so it wouldn’t cost a thing for anyone.”
The spell hinges on Jack's blood being the blood of Cas’ son, just like what was needed for the spell Nick used to try to bring Lucifer back. Jack being family will bring Cas back. And dammit everyone is going to know that.
“Stop me if you don’t want this,” he says as he spreads some of the jelly between his thighs, the back of his hand knocks against his heavy balls with each pass and he’s being driven crazy with the punches of lust that hit him each time Cas makes contact.
“Hey there boy,” Dean calls gently to focus the horse’s attention. “Shh, shh hey now,” he continues when Ringer gets a tad bit uppity with him being there. He wants to hop down into the stall with him, to properly get on the right foot with him but without the other men he doesn’t think it would be a great idea.
“Even if the sale doesn’t go through Dean, you still worked on Ringer as you should have and he’s a far better horse than he used to be,” Cas says, drawing him in.
. He’s hurting Cas again and it's ruining him but he can’t listen to any of that, so he sets his jaw and lets that pain guide him instead.
Neither his ma nor pa had asked why Dean calls him ‘Cas’ until two nights ago when his father brought it up, he knew they would have issues with it but hadn’t ever wanted to broach the topic himself. By his father's words, he could assume that he wasn’t fond of Dean using such a casual term for him, but his father does know at least a little about his dislike of being referred to as sir and at first, must have accepted it by believing it was coming from a place of following an order Castiel set out.
He sneaks his arm around Cas’ middle. It feels so rewarding to be able to do so without worry. Sometime in the days after they left the farm, they came to an understanding about what all this was exactly and with it came the allowance of these tender moments they’d both denied wanting. Of course he’d disallowed himself to have this after Cas got shot, couldn't fathom why Cas would want it and he had to punish himself in some way for his failure but now things seem to be better.
Anger, he’s learned, is a gateway to unrestrained thoughts, without meaning to, he let slip far more than he ever intended for Cas to know, he’s realizing that his unassuming nature and kind face might be his power in this world, a power he doesn’t even know he has.
“No, you didn’t,” Dean replies breathily. Cas flips the cylinder out with an ease he shouldn’t possess, or perhaps Dean is too focused on his fingers to notice the hesitation and confusion in his actions. Cas looks at him expectantly, a request for more bullets written on his face.
The thought churns something ugly in his chest, as though he’s only worth something to Cas when his past remains a mystery, just another puzzle to solve. He wants to get bitter and angry; he wants to confront Cas about it, but he’s mostly just tired, let down in a way he didn’t know he could be. He wishes Cas would leave, go back to his happy life and stop making him feel special, stop pretending that he’s worth something when it’s so clear to him that he’s not much more than nothing.
Cas grumbles good-naturedly as he turns his head towards Dean’s neck, he kisses and licks his way to Dean’s mouth before sealing their lips in a filthy kiss. He means for it to distract from him pulling out but it only somewhat works.
He bucks his hips violently, chasing the bolts of pleasure that strike him each time Cas presses against the spot.
He knows that Michael will do a good job with the farm, and by the look on his brother's face, he’s thrilled to be the one to inherit the land.
The odd feeling doesn’t dissipate, it’s as though his body already regrets the choice he hasn't gone through with yet. Dean settles in for the night, turns out the lantern, and desperately tries to think of what he’ll put into the letter he wants to send Sam. The feeling gnaws at his heart, settles behind it so that with every beat it pains him. He hopes that signing the contract will make it go away, but a part of him knows it will do nothing of the kind.
Cas moves them, sliding an arm around Dean’s waist and turning Dean around in his arms. He ends up on his forearms and knees and has a brief thought that Cas may try to take him before Cas’ hand reaches around and begins to stroke him again. At the same time, he feels Castiel’s other hand press below the swell of his ass. Instinctively he presses his thighs together. But Cas soothes him with the hand, running it along his flank while shushing him.
“I think that’s a wonderful plan… just don’t go through with it if she had a tough day, make sure that the happy memory isn't backed by tragedy. Have you picked out a band yet?”
He doesn’t know if Cas is being purposely avoidant or not or if he regrets any of his actions from his first night. Worry curls itself around his chest. He decides that he will act as he would with anyone else, respectful and definitely showing no interest in anything other than an acquaintanceship. It is foolish anyways, his time on the farm will be brief, he doesn’t need to go about forging relationships; his life is not one that lends itself to friends, or to partners of any kind.
He’s settling into the barn that night, when he realizes that he’s left his washing at the house. Cas hadn’t been the one to bring him supper that night—but Dean found that even without that time with Cas, he wasn’t worried about where they stood with each other, not like he had been in his first days—and because of that, no one had made it known to him that he had forgotten.
“Seems you do too. For what? I don't know, but you think it's your fault,” Cas responds, his eyes have lost some of their hardness, and he fights again against the fury that starts to stoke from the embers that never seem to leave his chest.
“It was you, shit Cas your fucking hands—drive me crazy,” he says as he slides his hands under Cas’ shirt to score his back. Marking him in the only way he can, if only he could get his mouth on the untouched expanse of his chest or hips, bite into the flesh and suck his claim onto the soft skin.
“No I can’t, no matter what I come up with it doesn’t fit, and for some reason in a matter of a single day everything changed, all I tried, all I wanted was to be your friend, De—”
Laying in the dark he sorts through the day, the last three days, and realizes that this was the length he had thought to stay for, continuing his time at the farm may prove dangerous not only to himself but to the family. But some part of him wants to stay, with Cas’ younger sister sick it seems extra cruel to leave in the dead of night.
Dean’s a little unsettled that Cas never asked the hardest question to answer, but he’s glad too. If Cas wishes to stay ignorant, that's his choice. He’s not about to jeopardize any part of what he and Cas have by telling him.
(See the end of the chapter for
When he speaks it’s hardly above a whisper, but the force and conviction behind them is as loud as anything. “I’m sure.” With that, he draws Dean in again and drops a desperate kiss to his lips.
He may not be able to ask outright but he figures he knows a way to imply with just enough ambiguity as to not cast aspersions, “Bring the flask?”
“Dean, I’m really sorry about that.”
Dean’s face flushes at the thought, and the rouging is made worse by the fact that Cas is currently standing over him still, looking at his face for his response to the unspoken question.
It does almost nothing, his mouth fills with blood in seconds and he resigns himself to swallow it.
Dean doesn't know what made him decide on the tree. They didn’t have a body to burn, not this time. They didn’t have a six-foot hole to dig and he felt odd putting a marker over unmarred earth. So when he stumbled upon a tree in the woods surrounding the bunker, one with a beehive tucked nine feet up he didn’t even realize he had popped out his pocket knife and started carving until the first three letters were written in the wet bark.
He’s not sure how long he has before Cas shows up so he runs through everything as fast as he’s able, making sure best he can that Ringer is ready for this trip. Dean has ridden him daily in preparation but he’s still worried for him. He secures the tie-ups and the reins checking placements as best he can without much light to go on. For a moment he debates taking a saddle but decides against it, no doubt Jody will have more than enough equipment for him once he’s there and he’s not keen on stealing from the Novak’s.
It scares him, make no mistake, he’s objectively terrified by Cas’ ability to make him so open but there’s a sneaking part of him that rears up whenever a bit of the wall is toyed with and another that shouts in glee at the intrusion into his carefully constructed façade.
He feels far too much like prey than he would care to, caught in a trap that his brother likely doesn’t know he’s set.
The dopey look never leaves Cas’ face for more than a second—dropping only to step in with a directive of some kind—and Dean feels his cheeks heat more each time he catches Cas training his gaze on him.
“Nuhuhh,” she says hitting his arm, “that’s you!”
He has them gripped in his hand a mere second before Cas starts to rock against him like it’s the only thing he wants to do forever. Hell, maybe it is.
“No disrespect to your mama,” Cas says, “but that's an easy thing to say to a child, a dream we tell them so they never think that the world is closed off to them.”
It shouldn’t be news to Castiel, but each time his eyes fall upon the man, his breath stutters, not so overtly that anyone else could tell but it's clear to him. He doesn't know when Dean would have done it but he’s wearing the clothes Castiel knows he never retrieved yesterday. Then again, his father delivered him his food earlier so it’s not a great leap to make that he also would have taken the clothes with him.
When he gets back to the bunker his shattered being has fit itself into a mosaic, determination glares off of it in kaleidoscope patterns. He’s not whole, shards of himself are buried into the tree, more still have shot themselves into the ether, searching for the thing that he’s missing, all that he’s missing. Still, he’s whole enough, if a little jumbled.

Everything is gentle and warm and he finds himself fighting to keep the words from escaping, three little words that he’s had bouncing in his head for far too long. He keeps them inside though; tonight isn’t the night for them.
“No one thinks highly of themselves Cas,” Dean says evasively.
The man pauses at the still-open door to the barn and knocks against the wood as though he thought he might be indisposed. Just as he begins to say, “Come in?” the man rounds the door and he finds himself stock-still at the sight of him.
“It wasn’t your fault Jack. It wasn't Cas’ fault or anyone's fault,” Sam steps in while Dean swallows his heart all over again.
By daybreak, the house has found a calm with all the additions. It's a tentative calm, ready to splinter with any minor thing, but a calm nonetheless. Again, he’s kept in the house, not allowed to work with Dean.
“Hey it's okay to be nervous,” he reassures when Alfie sticks his head into the crook of his shoulder, “I know he’s very loud and,” he looks around conspiratorially before leaning in close and whispering, “quite annoying, but he’s really just a softie,” he finishes returning to a normal speaking volume.
Castiel doesn’t think his younger sister has any qualms about marriage, but it irks him to think that she may not get to live all the life she may want because their mother, and by extension their father, is so insistent on having them ‘comply with the doctrine set out for us’ because it's the ‘only way to live a bountiful life’.
They fight like mad when the pain is too much, both physical and emotional, just as those on their bodies, the scars from past transgressions never leave, though they become unnoticeable for stretches so long they are forgotten about. They work through it, Dean takes care not to shut down, Cas takes care not to push his own issues aside as he so often had.
He knows it doesn't matter, either which way, Cas is as untouchable as they come. His feelings, whatever they are, mean nothing here. He needs to focus on the fact that he will be leaving this farm, soon. As protection for himself and this family. The longer he stays the longer he’s at risk, the longer he’s putting Cas—Cas’ family at risk.
When Cas comes back—his shoulder far more expertly wrapped and body rinsed of the blood—Dean holds the physician's gaze as he pays an extra half on top of the bill, hoping it’s enough to buy his silence. When he catches sight of Dean’s wound, he insists on wrapping it at the very least to avoid infection.
“I was tryna make friends with Ringer over there but mister had other ideas and he tipped me back,” Dean says with a head jerk and a cut-off laugh at the horse that seems to care not about the pain he’s caused. “Landed right on my shoulder, think it might have broken but I’m not sure.”
He’s quiet again as he thinks, and he starts to feel agitated the longer it takes. Minutes go by before he can settle on something that’s good.
He tries to move again, but the angle at which he fell seems to be limiting the movement of his good arm so much that he can’t feasibly shuffle himself around without the sharp bursts of pain. Just as he’s about to shout in vain for Cas or anyone really his soundless plea is drowned by a shout.
Hours later they stop to water Ringer and check the map Cas had thought to buy. They have hours to go still but there's no doubt they’ll make it to town with plenty of time to bathe.
“Just make sure I’m not the only one getting letters, the rest of them all miss you too.”
Dean throws a look to Cas who has the decency to look at least a little chastised. He smiles in spite of himself, Cas looks quite endearing with that look on his face.
Choked off shouts push themselves past his lips as he rides through the waves of pleasure. He vaguely registers Dean cleaning him and making him presentable the same way he had as he comes down from the high.
“Heya Cas, you enjoying the show?” Dean says looking over his shoulder where Cas is standing.
Dean whines when he pulls back, and in the quick look Castiel gets, he can see the confusion in Dean’s eyes and the quick flash of stoicism as he prepares to be rebuffed.
His mind spins without ever showing a sign of it tiring, flitting from thought to thought, always landing back on Cas. Every time it does, a whimper falls from his lips and tears run anew. At some point Cas starts whispering into his ear as his good arm rubs up and down Dean’s back in time with his own breathing, it helps to control Dean’s breathing which he thinks was probably the goal.
Dean holds Cas’ gaze until the look in his eyes becomes too much. The heat he felt but couldn't name when Cas’ hand touched his back is there again, settling between them, heavy as the midday sun, and just as distracting.
He had wanted to scream then and he still wants to scream now. He truly doesn't understand how things so quickly went to rot. He and Dean were getting somewhere, or at least it seemed that way to Castiel. Dean was opening up, it wasn't just desire, it was genuine a connection between them. But now Dean is leaving.
It was different all the other times one of them came back from death or what have you. There was always this intense fear that ate through his heart because he couldn't risk losing Cas again. No matter how desperately Dean wanted to rush up to him and make him see that Cas was beyond anything,
“Do you need help to finish, or can I head over and get to work on Ibby?”
Dean nods. “So what do you suggest? Tell him a fake spell? Just make it up as we get closer to an actual answer we can use?”
“Sunshine, huh?” he can’t help but ask, his voice is thick with sleep and as he looks up, he sees a small smile on Cas’ face.
“I’m not sure if you were told, but I fell onto my shoulder and I can hardly move it, and I've seemed to have scratched myself up quite badly at the same time. I'm sorry to trouble you with having to patch me up.”
“We can start back up tomorrow if you’d like,” he says with a look that expresses his opinion on Dean’s lack of work, and his opinion on why it happened.
According to the lore, when the empty is woken up
Dean quickly spins on his heels, not wanting to hear the end of the conversation, though it plays in his mind regardless. He imagines that by now Cas and his father are laughing over the drifter who never had a life that he could be proud of, laughing because Dean thought Cas could even for a moment enjoy his company.
“I’m not sure why my pa is treating this day so importantly, it’s not as though this is the first horse sale we’ve had, and no offence to him but Ringer isn’t the most impressive horse we’ve had, he’s not the least impressive either but my pa is acting as though this sale is the most crucial deal yet.”
A warm palm grips onto his hip, possibly in warning, possibly as a promise for later.
I would like to say that after a royal fuck up at the pharmacy I've been off my meds for five days and as such my cognitive abilities have been tanked (just like the general opinion of the show post-finale - woo!) which is why my notes are hella weird and my tags are shite
He always was a bit slow on the uptake in all honesty, “Cas.” He tried his best to keep his voice from dripping with acid as it so wanted to. Cas couldn't have known about Dean needing him like that when he made the deal, they’d only really been together for a few weeks, “If you made that deal how are you still here able to tell me about it?”
Cas lets out a short laugh at his frustration and drops his hips placatingly. The pressure has his back arching from the ground and as one hand reaches up to thread through Cas’ soft hair the other grips onto the blanket Cas had directed them to.
Also, I wanted to address the fact that yes Cas has siblings who aren't white, this will be explained in the next chapter and then further talked about as the story progresses (in Cas' chapters (3, 6, and 9) most notably). Rest assured that nothing fucked up happened to result in non-white children being part of their family I can promise that.
Just as he was about to ask what he was talking about, ask him to continue and put him out of his misery, Cas spoke again.
This poem connects with the very beginning of the original story and the final few chapters of it
“I’ll make sure that we have all the info we need on getting Cas back, and I’ll make sure to grab a bit of his grace. I’ll tell him it's a part of the spell. I doubt he’ll question it. That way when the dust settles we’ll have a decent chance of it actually working.”
“How do you mean Pa? I’ve been doing as much of my chores as I can.”
He isn't sure if he would call it a blessing or a curse when his ma yells again into the dark of the night, but it snaps the moment in two and he passes one final look at Winchester before leaving. For the first time since laying eyes on the man, he’s faced with an oddly doe-eyed look that makes him think that for all this man pretends he is above the horrors he seems to be weighed down by he is still a child in his own right same as him, in response he offers a small smile, kind and gentle as what he gives to his youngest siblings, before walking through the yard separating the two buildings.
“Fuck it,” Cas says to himself, just barely loud enough for Dean to hear. “Tell me you don’t want me to go with you and I’ll leave on my own, live whatever life I can, spend my days with whoever deems me fit to be theirs. Tell me you want to put our farm behind you, never to look back on. Tell me you want to forget me, forget whatever we’ve spent the last weeks doing and I’ll let you.”
The way his heart seizes in his chest when Cas’ name shows up on his phone makes him worry that he’s going to die of cardiac arrest at the ripe old age of 41 but it's nothing compared to actually hearing his voice. Strained and hurt and pleading and
“Yes I can help with that, it’ll be a bit trickier just the two of us but I reckon we’ll manage just fine.”
I really enjoyed writing this softer chapter, even if it had some angst sprinkled throughout it.
Gabriel catches him in the schoolroom as he’s looking again for Anna’s toy. He doesn't hear him walk up and when he speaks Castiel can’t help but jump.
He’s too shocked to ask why the empty would choose him of all its occupants to boot out. Hell, he's too shocked to do much of anything as Lucifer goes about zapping a reaper into the bunker, killing her, and having her resurrected as the new Death.
It had scared him for some time, when Cas would tell Dean he loved him, a fear set so deep within him he didn't know it existed until Cas spoke those words for the first time. It shocks him still how casually Cas says that as though the act of doing so, of loving him, is as easy as breathing.
Cas threads the fingers of his right hand through Dean’s left, holding it up above his head effectively pinning him down. Dean could break from the hold but he doesn’t, he revels in the position. Cas ducks his head kissing him soundly, devilishly, before sealing his lips over Dean’s pulse point and licking his way up to his ear, he pulls the lobe between his teeth, runs the tip of his tongue along the shell.
Cas is quiet a moment. When he does speak Dean can hear that he’s struggling with something.
“Oh please call me Gabriel, 'Sir' is so stuffy and formal,” Gabriel says with a put upon shudder as he pulls a small candy from his pocket. He offers it to Dean but having never gathered a proclivity for sweets he declines. Gabriel gives a half-shrug before he unwraps the treat and tosses it quite impressively into the air and catches it in his open mouth.
Imagine his shock when neither man stepped up beside him. Before Dean even has a chance to stand up to speak to the man, he sits down beside Dean, legs stretched out in front of him, his feet tapping together gently in a steady beat.
Dean has never entered the house when that door has been open, all his reasons for going into the house are accessed before he’d ever need to pass through into the house proper and he’s unsure as to whether or not it would be right to gather his clothes with the door as it is.
“Dean, are you okay?” Cas asks, terror so audible in his voice that it turns his stomach. “Dean?”
The gnawing follows him through their morning, both taking care to clean properly, helping Cas when needed. It stops him from eating as he should but there's nothing to be done for that until he knows one way or the other what Jody is going to do. He fiddles with his long sleeves constantly, enough so that Cas takes his hand on more than one occasion to give it a reassuring squeeze.
The next part is something like what I would have liked to see in the finale. It's a bit short compared to some of these chapters but it's more a glimpse into their post series lives than anything else so I hope you stick around for that, it'll be coming out in a few days max.
Cas is still looking at him, eyes roaming his features. A crease forms between his brows and Dean longs to reach out to smooth it with the pad of his fingers, or perhaps lean in and smooth it with a press of his lips, but he holds back.
“Wouldn’t for a moment wish not to.” He means the sentiment with his whole heart. Hannah's face lights up a bit more than it had been and it serves only to break his heart a little more. What will happen the day he does leave? When he goes off to school or concedes to his mother's wants and marries.
She’s not seen Cas yet, but Dean can pinpoint the moment she does as her eyes go almost comically wide. She tries to school her expression but it's clear that the double shock has taken some of her tact from her, Dean can’t blame her, they’ve shown up in quite a fashion.
“Dean?! Dean are you okay?” Relief flooded him at the sound of Jack’s voice before confusion set in. “Hey Dean, oh I’m so glad you're okay, oh okay you’re sitting up, ya we can do that.”
Even still a heat rises in his chest and lights a small flame upon his cheeks at what he could mean by it. “I’ll be sure to sneak it past my ma when I bring you supper,” he says with a smile. “Wouldn't do to have her think you've got an issue with the cooking, even if it’s valid."
Castiel seethes down to his core at his father's reduction of Dean. Down so far that he’s essentially become a damn tool that once it’s been ‘used up’ you toss away as though it’s nothing. Aside from Castiel's feelings for Dean, he’s still a human being, he still deserves respect from those around him.
Cas had rarely ever called him by the name Winchester in his time on the farm, but now that ‘Dean’ had been offered and accepted he seems hell-bent on only addressing him as such.
Cas seems most excited about his brother Gabriel returning and talks about him and his return near constantly. Dean finds himself listening to Cas’ stories about his siblings as he worked beside him in the machine shed, setting up some of the equipment so that Charles could use it. Dean’s been making sure that each piece is up to par and Cas was working beside him doing the same.
“Castiel, I’m going to be taking the boy his supper tonight. I want to talk to him about the changes that will come with the arrival of your older siblings. You’re free to do as you wish tonight seeing as you no longer have to waste your time out there.”
He makes to grab the bag away from Cas, and away from the man, but before he can the gaunt man snaps his hand out and snatches the pouch.
He had tucked each new piece of information away in his head, against his own better judgement he replayed them, ignoring the part of him that told him not to get attached to the man, even slightly. But with all the learning he had done, the part of him he longed to see most was blocked off. Until now.
“Always, I’m glad you could make it,” Castiel says as they pull apart and Gabriel makes a scoff of playful indignancy.
But how do you apologize for something you did but also didn’t do, and how can you make sure that the one who’s owed an apology doesn’t realize that the love he feels is for a pile of ash if you aren’t the one who lied to him but still you are. How do you live as two people at once?
Dean sets to work quickly, running through the chores and the extra work that had piled up the last couple days. He fixes what needs to be fixed, like the loose boards on the side of the barn, he resets the fencing around the trough pens, making sure the ground isn't getting chewed up enough for any animals to weasel their way through. It's easy work, nothing he hasn’t done before. Cas pops out a few times throughout the day to ask if he’s okay before heading back inside.
He’s about to shove Cas’ hand off of him with an aggressive roll of his good shoulder when Cas’ hand trails its way down the length of his back, sliding gently over the ridges of scars he’s all but forgotten about, ones caused by falling on broken glass and knives and brass knuckles, ones he doesn’t remember getting, ones he can't ever forget.
He stalls for a moment, unsure of his answer. In all his years the only person that had asked him that was Sam and he hadn’t done so in such a long time that he forgot the cavern that opens in his chest at the thought of his old idea of ‘perfect future’. It's a hollow cold feeling that sucks the air from his lungs.
He finds himself wondering if Dean’s leg still bothers him at night. Some time ago Castiel had given him an extra pillow to set his leg on as he slept after one particularly bad day. It wasn't a day that was any more strenuous than normal but Dean had insisted that he could go back to doing the majority of the work, shifting the work to himself instead of relying on Castiel to pick up the sack as it were. It had been maybe a week since his fall but he refused to take it easy. The two of them had gone out to the fence line to repair them. Castiel had only gone because Dean was still favouring his uninjured leg and if he was going to need assistance Castiel had wanted to be there. Of course, there was also the fact that he was intensely drawn to the man and found that if he could rely on any excuse to be near him, he would take it without hesitation.
Dean cranes his neck to see the doorway and hisses at the pain the shift causes.
Granted it was only because the button was labelled
“Uriel! I said no climbing past the clothesline!” Dean hears Cas call. He watches as the boy Cas lifted into the tree makes his way down from where he’d climbed to—several feet higher than Dean would have dared at a similar age. When his feet touch the ground a young girl runs up to him and pulls him into a game of jacks so quickly it gives Dean whiplash.
He mourns with every breath. Mourns Cas and Eileen, Charlie, Donna, Bobby, Claire, Jody, Garth, Bess
“Dean, I'm sorry that I eavesdropped on your conversation, if you'd like I can leave now, even just to my room.” Dean didn't need to have his eyes open to know that Cas was doing a little pivot move he did when he was unsure of himself.
When he does hear the door clatter against its frame, the butterflies return to his stomach and he fiddles nervously, glancing down at his bare chest and its gnarly appearance with a scowl. He shouldn’t care one way or the other how Cas finds his chest. It shouldn't bother him in the slightest if he reacts in disgust or with apprehension. And he most certainly shouldn't hope for him to react as though they intrigue him, as though they make him more enticing
The hand on his arm slides up to cup the back of his neck. He goes willingly when Cas pulls him forward to press a lingering kiss to his lips.
“You know scars can often mean someone else did disreputable acts against you, I still think that you are blaming far too much on yourself.”
“Hey,” Cas says with mock indignancy. “Who are you calling old, you’ve got to be around my same age, maybe even older than I am!”
“Were you ever able to keep in touch with the people in the places you’d moved on from?” Cas asks snapping Dean so harshly out of his thoughts he’s surprised he didn't get a physical injury.
His ears ring, his blood rushes through his body, there’s no outside world to him anymore. Everything fades out. The ground around them, the noises Ringer keeps making, wholly displeased with what’s gone on here, the exhaustion that seeps into his bones, it all disappears.
He runs over to where he’s slumped over on his side. When he rolls him onto his back his eyes are fluttering, barely staying open.
He grits his teeth against the flare of anger that blooms, it’s no time to lash out. “Someone had to make money, someone had to make sure that Sam had clothes and school supplies, and food in his stomach, now it wasn't my mama’s fault she wasn't there to help but it sure as hell was my father’s fault that that was put on me.” Bloody and cold, that’s how he found his father, in a maze of back-allies a full day after he was supposed to come home.
Huffing fondly Dean stretches his legs around to open the space wider for Cas, he hooks his right leg high on Cas’ hip. Pulling Cas close, Dean hooks his left leg up and over his shoulder. Taking the cue, Cas lands on his right elbow, supporting much of his weight on his forearm while Dean supports the rest of his upper body on his thighs.
Five days later Castiel sits in the kitchen of the only home he’s ever known. A home that has brought so much joy to his life, so much love from his siblings, so many memories it's like he can hear the laughter bounce down the hallways, or the wail of an infant in the dark of night. A home that he had all of his milestone moments in, same as his brothers and sisters, where every door or window is part of a million moments in his life that together made him.
He never could do that to Sam, he was too young to burden with all that. To let that onto another person would be to damn his soul more than it already is, to keep it in is to break his body around the pain. But now, now he knows that if he were to offload it, it wouldn't be to put upon another but to simply release it, let it run from his body and soak the ground around him, mar the earth until nothing could grow upon it.
Ringer is fully done up a short while before Cas is making his way from the house. The heaviness in his shoulders is enough to tell Dean that he needs to ask Cas if he’s sure about this. His body is further weighed down by the cases in his arms. They are both far larger than Dean’s meager pack, he can’t begin to guess what Cas has stored in them. He has a blanket tucked under one of his arms, its bulk making it harder for him to carry what he has.
“Can I help? Your form with your hands is okay but your body is throwing off your shots.” He raises an eyebrow in a silent question and walks himself behind Cas when he gets a nod of assent.
He’s thrown from his thoughts when a small, but oddly forceful, arm—make that two arms—land around his neck.
He lets his doubts go. What his father said last night was true, he had responsibilities he’d let slide and Anael had been picking them up, which certainly isn’t fair to her.
Rationalization (of the past and the present, the lies and the truths, the differences of the worlds you came from, the fact that you failed to protect him once and you won’t survive if you fail again and the fact that all your life you were locked away but freedom comes with risks you couldn’t have imagined) takes time. It’s ugly and messy and fraught with pain. But a love that aches is still proof of a love that exists.
He waits until he has something to tell Sam and Jack, waits until there's actually hope so that if nothing came of any of this it would only be him who gets crushed.
“Castiel, mmh please Casti—” his pleas die half-formed as Cas’ hand shoots up and wraps around his throat applying just enough pressure to be a clear warning. His fingers flex, pressing harder into his skin, causing his breathing to shallow and his eyes roll back at the fuzzy sparks that light up along his body. A moan makes its way from his body and a spurt of precome rolls down the underside of his cock as Cas’ fingers hold steady against the vulnerable skin of his neck.
“I'm sorry to hear that.” He remembers the fear every time Sammy came home looking ill, and how he did anything and everything to make sure he stayed healthy.
knowing how long Cas spent at his side, how much he must have added to his pain, just because Dean thought Cas could never feel anything like that for him. How long could they have been together if one of them had just been brave enough to
Again, Dean’s nerves pick up at the whole prospect of what this day’s going to hold for them.
Cas does so and it's a simple name really, four letters, pure in a way. Like fresh air or when he was able to snag a still warm piece of bread as a child. Something about the four letters just seems to evoke ‘home’ in his mind.
Dean has always been one to ensure proper care of what few possessions he owns; they often needed to last far longer than intended and constant upkeep was the only way he knew how to ensure that. So one afternoon between his chores and his other responsibilities he takes the time to check his pistol, making sure that it’s as clean and undamaged as it had been the morning he left town. He’d put it off longer than he planned to but his time with the Novak’s had been so interesting and distracting and all around busy that he’d let it slide.
Each step towards their room has more of the tension seeping from his body. His feet become heavy as the toll of the last few days catches up to him. His breath comes in short, his throat threatening to close itself under the weight that's crashing down on him. His eyes are burning by the time they make it to their room.
“—whoa! Hey are you okay Castiel?” Jody asks in response to the noise.
“Whatever we’d like, we don’t have to rush, we don’t have to worry or keep quiet,” Cas pauses as Dean spins around in his arms. “It’s you and me; we can do anything.”
“It’s easier to unlearn a habit isn’t it?” he asks with a playful cocked brow, distracting himself from his hands.
The stitches had been removed after about two weeks, something he was tremendously thankful for. The fabric of his pant leg would catch on the ends of the threads and tug at the skin with every movement and he’d grown quite tired of it, and the mild pain that accompanied it. It was an annoyance more than it was actually painful but the feeling was altogether unpleasant and not having to deal with it was a blessing.
The man hasn’t chosen to sit or walk further than the entry to the barn standing less than calmly at the door frame instead. And he wishes he would, just as much as he wants him to leave and head back to the house. Everything about him is conflicted, it unsettles him, for so long he never had to question what he wanted.
Cas gives him a watery smile, “The impermanence of life is what gives beauty to it.” It sounds like he’s quoting something but he doesn't ask what.
“Well I uh—I want to ask her to marry me…” Sam says nervously.
He barely sleeps that night, and when he does it’s propped up outside Cas’ room, waking at every whisper and every creaking floorboard.
“Well Ma’s right,” he lies. “Soon enough I’ll have to start my life away from the farm.” That's not so much of a lie anymore. “With me gone and Balthazar only eleven, who’s going to keep up the work on the farm?”
Dean and Sam share a look, understanding coming quickly to them both. Whatever is happening to Jack, it seems like he’s absorbing the power from things around him. To an extent that it nearly drains everything from them. Yet he and Sam are fine… then again if Dean’s learned anything from the last decade of his life it's to not think too deeply into what goes on with angels because it's the fastest way to give himself a headache.
“You expect me to believe that, Cas? If it was apparently so easy to lie to your pa, how am I to know you’re not just lying as easily now?” Dean says, there's a war going on within him that Castiel can see clear as day.
“As tempting as that is, I’ll stick with my name.”
“No! I mean no uh stay, I think we should maybe talk huh?” He hated how much his body was betraying him at that moment.
“You’ve got a lot of experience with horses then, Dean?”
“You have just the one?”
“I remember everything Cas, all of it, every fight, every drink, every goddamn time we looked at each other. And yet I can’t recall a fucking thing because I thought I had more time. After everything we’d gone through, I still thought we would have more time. It's all broken and jumbled and set to static and I can’t handle it because it's crystal clear and as muddy as anything because I thought I’d be able to make more, replace what got muddled. I thought you had more time.”
“Charles mentioned that you’d only been here a few weeks?”
He can't very well tell Cas that he wants to stay with him, for one it’s assuming a great deal about what Cas could want from whatever it is that they are doing, and for another, he’s not sure he could handle the blatant rejection and possible ramifications that could come from admitting that his wants go far past simple acts of hedonism and sin.
“Good, as Charles’ son you are our best option for a witness.” He knows it to be true. Jody knows that he has knowledge of the farm’s finances, a low stake-holding in the property, a good understanding of Dean’s character, and knowledge of the fact that he will in no way directly benefit from this deal. In fact, he thinks, this deal is a direct detriment to him.
This takes place directly after part one of the series, it's not necessary to read part one but it also wouldn't hurt to do so
“Do I what?”
“Shall we see how fast I can bring you to the edge with just my hand, think about it Dean, picture how my hand looks around you. Do you like it? Why don’t you look; see how gorgeous your cock looks wrapped in my fist.” The bastard is cocky as all getup and even worse, he has every reason to be.
The nerves turn into something less sinister because maybe they won't fail, maybe tonight is the last night that Cas won’t be in the bunker. The last night he goes to sleep
There's a scar near Dean’s mouth, it's small, a fallen piece of glass from a bottle cut through his skin when he’d fallen after a particularly rough punch who knows how long ago, insignificant in the canvas of scars on his body but Cas laves his tongue across it, lets his teeth scrape it and it feels like it's the singular most important part of him for a second. That is until Cas moves on and the feeling follows his lips as they lay worship down upon his heated skin.
Warning the next chapter is very long (not that any of these chapters are really short at all) so if it's time for some sleep you should probably get it now.
“I find it reasonable to assume that you already know, Dean. Now if you’ll excuse me, I must go tell my brother that he shouldn't be so flippant with matters such as these. I do hope you will allow me the decency of keeping my reputation intact.” His voice and words sound so unlike himself, or rather so unlike the self he gets to be when he’s with Dean. Now it's perfunctory, emotionless and so proper that it sounds foreign even to his own ears. He turns to leave quickly when a hand grips tightly on his upper left arm.
With this goodbye pertaining to so many of them it's far worse than it was with his brother, with his age now and all the understanding that comes with it, there's an extra blade carving into his chest, he knows what this loss will do to them if they love him even half as much as he had loved Gadreel.
“I’ll be back with your supper in a couple of hours.”
“My shoulder is fine.” Dean sends him a pointed look. “Okay, it’s not fine but I can handle this and I promise that if it ever gets to be too much, if my shoulder ever starts to hurt, I’ll tell you,” Cas says earnestly. “You won’t hurt me Dean,” he says as though he knows that's what Dean needs to hear from him and leans in again, their lips meld against each other, spit slick and wanting.
He walks back to the gig and digs around his bag for the rounds he’d purchased. He drops a few extra into his pocket before rolling the three bullets around his palm. The metal warms against his skin, it’s familiar in ways he doesn't want to think about.
Castiel remembers little after the envelope had sealed. There’s talking, Dean is animated and joyous and Castiel is happy for him, if devastated for himself. Eventually, Dean asks Jody if she would take his letter into town and send it for him. Remembering, Castiel asks Jody to wait before running to his room (and getting scolded for it) to get his own letter. He remembers Dean sending him a surprised look when Jody accepted the envelope, but he doesn't respond, not wanting to explain what he’s decided. After that, Jody hands Dean a small bag of money, far more than enough for food and such on the several days journey he’ll embark on in the coming days or weeks.
It takes only a few more seconds of silence before Dean snaps, “Spit it out Sammy.”
“Before we went up against Chuck Sam and I had been talking, deciding things. If I survived the fight with my grace intact I was going to give it up. It was the only way to get out of my deal. That was what we were looking at in the library, we were triple checking that everything was kosher. And it was what I wanted, Dean I want a life with you, even if one day you decided you don’t want this anymore I won’t ever regret the choice I was going to make. I don't know what's going to become of us, or Jack and that scares me, more than I ever thought it could. But this, you Dean is what I want and barring everything else I will spend my life at your side if you’ll let me.”
He watches as Cas loads them, his fingers working over the small rounds, hands capable of so much, of bringing Dean to the brink and falling with him, of patching wounds and writing names for the first time, of gently cupping his face and manipulating the steel of a gun with an ease that Dean can’t help but shiver at. Once he’s loaded the gun, he clips the cylinder back into place. He studies it for a moment, runs his fingers along the barrel, all the way up and all the way down before resting it back in his palms.
“Well I’ll be damned!” Gabriel shouts gleefully when he sees Castiel. “Would have thought you’d be off doing something important, especially considering the hour,” he says, a small jab at his habit of sleeping late as a child.
Cas sends him a scathing look that falls so far short of its mark he almost laughs out loud.
He hisses as Cas slips out, feeling so empty after being filled so perfectly. It's a shock to his system. Just as he settles onto his back he stops, putting a hand on Cas’ good shoulder.
Chapter four will be out in a couple days! I'm still not on my meds and so my ability to do things is about 20% of what it used to/should be (but I did have a very long, very 'fun' conversation with the pharmacy today to get everything sorted because it's been a week now and I hate this).
Dean reminds himself that as far as he knows Cas is completely off limits, in more ways than one, and that whatever it is he feels, whatever it is that's been growing against his will since his first night here needs to be ignored for his own sake.
Cas starts him out with rewriting the alphabet but from memory as best he can, he makes it to the letter F before he runs into trouble, and then makes it to Q before he stalls again. Cas gets him to go through the song again and sing as he draws out the letters. It’s easier today, though it's still not easy altogether, and when Cas finally asks him to start copying and writing the words he doesn't get frustrated as quickly.
He sits up—hardly noticing the pinch of pain in his bent knees—and reaches back, his need heightened by his desire to feel even a sliver of the claim he finds he wants put on Cas, and grabs his length at the base holding it steady as he slowly sinks down onto it, impaling himself with Cas’ cock.
He looks up as the mumbling stops and sees Cas’ eyes slip closed, abandoning his shoulder he starts to panic for real.
He runs some of the tepid water through his hair before brushing it with his fingers into a partial style to make himself look more put together. Dean takes a slow deep breath and rests his hands on the sink basin as he steels himself for the next few hours of posturing and propriety.
Dean reaches his hand out, unwinding it from the post, and holds it there, hoping Ringer will investigate his limb, get used to his smell, his touch. As he does so his mind traitorously strays to Cas. He wonders if Cas has those pure and soft memories of adoring parents wishing him sweet dreams, praying with him at the side of his bed, kissing his head as it rests on his pillow. He wonders if Cas uses that same voice with his siblings, if he sings them songs at night when nightmares have woken them up, if he reads them stories in the dim candle and lamplight.
Refocusing his efforts, he pulls off the head and runs his tongue around it before diving back in and taking as much as he can of Dean into his mouth. As he starts bobbing up Dean’s length and down again, his own erection becomes harder to ignore. Snaking a hand down, he presses against his prominent bulge letting slip a small groan at the much needed contact.
He rushes through his breakfast, getting a well deserved look of mild disappointment from his ma for putting on such a display in front of his extremely impressionable younger siblings.
Castiel sits in his home, letting it sink into his bones, the smells and sights, the noises and the emotions that are almost tangible, able to be grabbed and understood through touch. He feels it all settle into him, every moment of his life, he lets it simmer, all the feelings that threaten to overwhelm him. Every part fits itself around his heart and it’s almost as though, as they piece together, something about the space shifts.
They’ve been forced to triple up while the older kids are home to give the incoming families privacy. It’s a bit of a tight fit squeezing everyone in together, but none of the younger kids really mind. To them it’s special, out of the ordinary.
“My brother Sam is the same way, always has been, but he’ll never stop being Sammy to me, not even in his old age.” The ever present itch that forms when he talks of his brother returns, but Dean is chuffed to discover that it's nowhere near as overpowering as it had been.
Through it all, there's a constant burning in his throat and the hitching in his breath goes unnoticed often enough that no one asks him about it. He picks up every one of his siblings—except for Anael—and holds them against him, he whispers jokes in their ears and memorizes the way they laugh one last time. He hugs Anael and does the same, he thinks she might be the only one who understands what's happening but she’s kind enough not to say anything.
Dean gives his shoulder a light shove as he says, “What an astute observation.”
The man reaches him and dismounts but keeps a hand on the reins. He’s reasonably short and stands unassumingly, but he can see something in the man's eyes that shows he’s not to be pushed around. The man vaguely reminds him of his father, or what little of him he can remember. An old fear creeps its way down his spine, which straightens without his permission.
“There was nothin’ left for me there, I couldn't get a job, well at least I couldn't find a place to take on the risk. Figured it’s best to make a clean break,” he says, not looking up from the floor. Cas joins in with the scooping as he speaks.
Dean takes this in stride and when he slips to his knees in front of Castiel he lifts the hem of his shirt before leaning in and sucking small bruises into the skin of his stomach and hips. Dean bites at the skin gently and Castiel has to throw a hand out to support himself on the wall as the other lands itself into Dean’s short, sun blonde hair.
“No it doesn't Dean, those men had no idea who you were. You’d never wronged them in the past, they had no cause to come after you. Sometimes we just cross paths with evil people and it’s no one's fault.” His hand cups Dean’s cheek and his eyes slip closed, an errant tear spills over and treks down his cheek, Cas thumbs it away. “If anything, your past saved us, I screwed up royally and we’d be dead if you hadn’t acted as you did. Know this Dean, nothing you’ve done in your life got either of us shot, this was not your fault, you have nothing to be absolved of.” Cas says the last sentence so fiercely Dean finds himself nodding.
Guilt curls in his chest. “No I’m the reason you were in danger, I caused this, my past I—. Just being beside you puts you in danger.”
The first thing he registers is the heavy weight of Cas’ arm draped across his waist, the next is the soft, even breaths that land on his shoulder. He’s exhausted, tired down to his bones, so he makes a choice he’s never made before and he allows himself the chance to go back to sleep. The softness of the bed beneath him throws him with every movement and he reckons the only reason he’d been able to sleep so well last night was because of the fatigue that plagued his body.
He and Anael sit with Gabriel, Kali, and their parents as they talk, finally old enough to be included in the adult conversations while Balthazar and Inias, aided by Hannah—who had been given permission to traverse into the schoolroom—watch over the youngest kids.
” and he can’t understand why his chest seems to expand against his ribs while his lungs squeeze themselves together because he’s never heard the type of lyric that was made to hit you square in the chest because, well, there’s not been a lot of music listening aside from piano and string quartets in his life.
“Last time we did that I found you lying on the floor in a puddle of blood with a ruined shoulder,” Cas says with that same odd look.
“Wait, you mean to tell me you didn’t orchestrate the entire venture just so you could see me?” Dean says in mock offence. He may be swimming in a river of conflict within himself but he’s a master at pretending that all is well.
It would be easy enough to deflect, change the topic and move past the slip-ups, but he gets the sense that even if it works for right now, Dean isn't going to let this go in the long run.
Cas props his head up on his elbow, gazing down at Dean who knows he looks red with slight embarrassment, a reaction caused solely by his earlier thought. He reaches his hand out as though he’s going to lay it upon Dean’s face, perhaps thumb softly at the curve of his jaw or cheek, a gentle touch Dean never thought he’d be on the receiving end of, but he seems to change his mind at the last moment, instead resting it upon his arm before sliding it down to his waist and letting it fall from his body.
He was still guarded, aware of what he was letting slip, as though he was untrusting of Castiel, which he couldn't fault the man for, of the glimpses into his past it didn't seem as though many he crossed paths with could be trusted not to have ulterior motives behind their façade of wanting friendship.
When he gives Dean his supper he sits with him, aware that he has a limited number of nights like this left. He feels as though he’s trying too hard now, the easiness they had is lost to what the events of the day mean for them. He can’t tell if Dean feels the same, he can’t tell much at all right now and it bothers him.
(See the end of the chapter for
It was different when they were only working on random words and common sentences, but with the texts in front of him he feels quite dim. It's not a feeling he is unaccustomed to, Sam tried his best but he knew he wasn’t the one that could be deemed anywhere near smart. Still, it grates at him, his incompetence in something that should be so easy, he
It’s quiet for so long he thinks Cas must have fallen asleep and is well on his way to the same when Cas’ gruff voice rumbles against his back.
By the time night fell, Dean was wiped, he took Cas’ hand and led him back to his room. He dropped unceremoniously onto his bed and pulled Cas in against him, tucking his head against his stomach like he had done the night he learned he was going to lose Cas so long ago.
“Morning boy,” his father calls as they get closer. Dean raises his head and Castiel pauses a moment.
He dreams as he does most nights. Dreams of blood and tears; screams echoing through his head joined by flashes of scenes he’d hoped he would have forgotten by now. The threats thrown at him root fear deep in his chest.
There's a hopeful look in Cas’ eyes and it cracks through the last bit of trepidation within him.
Dean sets to work. He grabs the scissors and cuts Cas out of his shirt. Lead fills his veins when he sees that the bullet tore straight through the top of his shoulder. It’s a better scenario than if the bullet had stayed in his body but now he has two wounds to contend with.
“Well I’m happy for you, does Cas know?”
He can’t let himself go too far into anything right now so as he stands there he places his hand just below Cas’ name, his fingertips barely touching the bottom of the carving and in a voice so low it barely carries he says, “I’ll see you soon.” and breaths out in a long gust.
“To free Jack’s soul from heaven was to immediately put him at risk for his angelic side to be scooped up by the empty. It came for him, in his heaven, said that he couldn't return to earth, couldn't come home with me.” Dean hated the way he could picture it, hated the way he knew Jack’s face would have fallen and broken in fear and sadness.
He tries his best to not make a mess on his way to the wash closet and is, for the most part, successful. He makes quick work of cleaning himself up, perfunctory and really only about three-quarters of what he should be doing, but he’s eager to crawl back into bed, to burrow into the warmth of Castiel’s body, to relax into the softness of the moment.
Cas gasps behind him and Dean shuts his eyes, wishing Cas was better at hiding his reactions. “Ma?” he says and motions the woman over.
Cas rounds the corner and pulls up short for a second before recovering and crouching down next to Dean. In response to Dean’s raised brow Cas says, “Not in my dinner clothes, don’t have to worry about the dirt.”
“Do you remember, a couple years ago when Jack died and I went to heaven to save him?”
“You are the most sinful thing I have ever laid my eyes on, and yet you are the closest to heaven I’ve ever felt,” Cas whispers against the heated skin, the air cooling the path his tongue took.
“Honestly, I haven't put much thought into it at all, I suppose I’d move to a larger city and find work there while I’m in school. Not sure where I would go though. I’m not even sure how I’d manage to get there.”
To save Dean from having to, Castiel speaks up quickly, “Jody is it okay if I sign in print rather than cursive, I'm afraid that I’ve not been using it very often and as such my skill when using it has decreased shockingly."
He thrusts harder again and almost loses himself with the moan that rips itself from Dean’s throat.
After the extra work is done, he makes sure to do his normal duties, not wanting to leave them to pile up as well. With Cas in the house, he’s not as distracted as he would normally be and he wants to monopolize on the moments of productivity. Though he still finds himself looking to the house occasionally to see if Cas is coming back or even just standing by a window, hoping to catch a glimpse of him.
He walks up and shakes Ellen’s hand and Cas follows suit. Dean sees Ellen’s eyes catch on his bound shoulder but she doesn't ask.
They never talked about it, but Castiel assumes now that Dean had wanted Jody to end up being the one he went to work for.
“Now what was so important that you risked bonking your head,” he says as he stands, figuring that whatever caused the running and the jumping is going to require something from him, and drops her to the floor, making sure that her legs are first under her before releasing her. He’d made that mistake once and once was all it took to not make it again—though it had been a tad bit funny (once he was sure of her wellbeing) to watch as Inias laid crumpled on the floor.
Stretching out from his beaten up knuckles are the crooked lengths of fingers that have been broken too many times. He can picture with clarity the scars that pattern the skin beneath the sleeves of his shirt. A map of wrong turns and missteps that had more serious consequences than he could ever have imagined.
Castiel is getting quite tired of this avoidance, if Dean wants to stop being his friend that's fine, but he could at least pluck up enough courage to actually say so to Castiel's face.
Dean had mentioned him in his letter, how could he not. Sam would’ve certainly asked how the hell Dean managed to write a letter and it was just easier to come out with it before he had a chance to.
It takes him no more than twenty minutes to write it all down, asking a favour he never would have thought to ask his brother had it not been for Dean.
“Sam’s right Jack, this wasn’t because of you and Cas knew that, he never blamed you for it,” Dean says. “He never even told me you were there.”
“There was a problem,” He cringed at the echo of their fight, at how he made it so Cas was the reason there were problems, as a stone sunk deep in his stomach. “Jack being nephilim meant that in death he was kind of up for grabs between heaven and the empty. The empty wanted him because of his parenthood, but he went to heaven because of his soul.” Cas paused and closed his eyes, Dean watched and his nerves picked up the longer Cas sat there silent.
“Hello there, I hear you’ve all been itching to see me up close,” Dean says as Hannah and a few other children sit down around him. Two of the kids stay wrapped at Anael’s waist but he can see that she’s at least intrigued in the upcoming proceedings.
He taps Cas’ shoulder gently, cautious of the injury, “I’ve got to go to the bathroom, gotta take care of—” he gestures vaguely about his lower body before they shift and Dean can roll out from their little concave bit of the bed.
“I was forcefully summoned here by a small child upon your bidding m’lady,” he says, getting a giggle from both his sisters. It amazes him how easily they laugh at everything, their childhood joy so pure and whole. Duma’s laughter echoes gently as she leaves the door, content that her job is done.
“But where will you go?” his mother asks.
“Don’t listen to him Ma I’ve seen him wincing from the pain more than once, I didn’t know it was like this or I’d have done something about it myself,” Cas says as his ma opens the chest, inside is more medical supplies than he’s seen in most clinics he’s stumbled into before.
“Dean! Dean!” The voice isn’t panicked but it’s booming, loud enough to filter clearly through the light haze the pain is causing him.
“I don't think they see you as a parent Cas, there's always a difference in a relationship between siblings even if one has a hand in taking care of or raising the other,” he says. “They’ll always see you differently.”
“You felt safe there, happy even at least a little?”
“I don’t give a damn Castiel, you have a responsibility here!” he says as he roughly taps the top of his desk with his index finger to emphasize his point. “Your sister has been picking up the slack for far longer than she should have to, as have I mind you, simply because you want to make sure that an imbecile who went against orders and got himself hurt doesn't do it again? He’s dafter than even I had thought, and I never had much hope for him to begin with.” Castiel watches, silent, as his father sends his arm out again.
He looks up at Dean through his own haze of lust and sees that the man's eyes have lost all but a small sliver of their vibrant green, the colour swallowed by his blown out pupils.
Sam and Gabriel are resoundingly steady in the 'simp for' category as per the tag, and of course, I had to give them a loving and large found family because I love the trope.
The memory of Jody telling them that Dean is the one that she’s here to inquire about likes to spring forth in Castiel’s mind unbidden at all times of the day. Each time it does, it sends another spike down his spine.
was the reason bad things happened to a good person. His stain on Sam’s life meant blood and pain and horrors that kept them both awake at night and there is no God that would forgive a transgression so great as endangering those you are meant to protect. He’s not ever been one to believe in any of that but he knows it regardless.
“Ma! I’m going on a walk for a bit, I’ll be back for supper. I just want to get some fresh air quickly,” he calls as he leaves the house, not waiting for a response. He knows Gabriel will cover for him if it comes to that. Right now he is too driven by the thoughts that have taken residence in his mind over the last week to care.
“I mean it would make sense, wouldn't it? He wants to be Chuck's favourite and always has; a chance like this won't ever come around again. He’d be an idiot not to take it.”
“Yes Ma’am, if you’d like you can come around and join me in here so you can get an up-close look.”
There's an uneasiness that starts in his stomach and runs along his spine. It’s not a feeling he’s overly used to, but it’s also not one he’s never known before. His late childhood was filled with this feeling, it's the same one that creeps up while his mother details all the lovely women she wants him to meet, though it's far less distracting then.
Knowing that Cas is stuck in there living his regrets over and over and over, all while Dean can’t fucking work fast enough to save him would be enough to send anyone into the comfort of a bottle. And Dean may be one of a kind but he’s never been that strong.
“Sir, I—” he begins quietly. “I can’t read, nor even write, either, but I sure am mighty good with horses, and I’m plenty strong so I can mend them broken fence posts and lines out-a-ways. And I swear I don’t need nothing more than a hot meal and a warm place to sleep.” He’s being truthful; keeping the lies to a minimum is his best option here. Getting caught in the web of them all is what’s gotten him into trouble all his life.
“She works here a few nights a week, nabbed us out right the first time we came in while she was working, scared the living daylights out of the both of us but she assured that no one had her eye for that kind of thing. Then oddly about an hour later she started propositioning me, so go figure,” Dean explains.
They spend some time—after Dean calms down from the excitement—writing sentences. Cas starts off by saying one aloud and Dean repeats it, then they write it in turn before moving on. Cas pulls out some of his books and gets Dean to read from them as best he can, the sentences are short, the words rarely reach longer than five letters and he can understand why these books are given to children.
Dean knows that he still has a few hours before their guest’s expected arrival, same as when Cas’ older siblings came, the potential buyer had stayed in town the previous night and will ride in at a more reasonable time, so he sets about his normal chores before going to the stables to see Ringer.
“Little brother, you always were kinder than the world deserved, always allowed yourself to be subservient to it… always allowed others to take precedence,” Gabriel says airily as though the conversation wasn't on such a heavy subject.
Cas is looking at him fondly but he looks away knowing that if he doesn't, they’ll get lost in it.
“You think too highly of me, Cas.”
“Either way if you’re ready, I’d be happy to help with the fences.” He phrases it a bit like a question, his own demeanour shifting off-center in the wake of Dean’s odd behaviour.
It’s overwhelming, having everyone together again. But as much as it picks at his nerves—they may be family but that doesn’t mean Castiel has unlimited patience with them—he can’t help but let his heart fill up with every smile he sees on one of his sibling’s faces. Or the rapt attention the kids, nieces and nephews included, give his older brother as he explains just what it’s like in the big city.
“What kind of pistol is it?” Cas is full of questions but he’s yet to ask the one most people want to know above anything. Cas smiles with his last answer and he can’t for the life of him figure out why he would want to be shown how to use a gun.
At dinner that night they learn why it is that all but one of them are back home. His father clinks his glass to halt the ruckus of conversations amongst the twenty-two of them. Castiel looks at the children settled into a table for themselves, sending an apologetic glance to Anael for the fourth time since they all sat down.
“You seem to be the one with the answer to that, not me,” he shoots back, not wanting to play into whatever game Dean’s hedging at.
“And the new look you’re sporting?” she asks after a moment.
Twelve extra people in the house is a lot more in practice than in theory. Especially considering they all had to quickly relearn how to live amongst each other while going about their business.
“In hindsight, it was a poor choice,” Cas says as he walks into the barn. He sits with the lantern beside him. Dean huffs and releases his crouch, landing soundly on his ass.
“Good Dean, take it, take what you want,” Cas says above him and that’s all it takes to have him crashing over the edge far sooner than he wanted.
He sends a glance at his brother. His eyes are wide and open, a little surprised and overwhelmingly fond. Sam probably always figured the truth was what it was. Hell, he dealt with the two of them for more than a decade and he’s by no means an idiot. Still, he doesn't push for anything from him right now and probably won’t for a while.
It doesn't help that each time Cas uses his name a jolt runs through his body, and he says his name a lot. Almost like he wants to make sure Dean knows it. As though he could even for a moment forget the fact that he finally has a name.
He turns the paper over again as Dean had and peers at the paper Dean is reading now. He sees his father's signature written down, no doubt from when Jody was here last. The remaining blank space at the bottom mocks him and heat crawls along in his veins, his heart starts to beat ever faster in his chest as reality starts to sink in around him.
“A little possessive huh Cas?” he says with a laugh.
For Cas to see him, truly see him, could be disastrous, but those feelings he never quite understood in other people, are starting to make him want to try.
They grip into each other as they get used to the sensations. After a minute Dean lifts his ass experimentally and lowers himself down again. Arousal sparks along his spine and the curling pressure at its base begins to gather again.
As Dean lays wrapped in the blanket that night, he thinks about Sam. Sam, the boy who had pleaded for years for Dean to name himself, who wanted to see his brother escape the life he lived as he himself slowly was. What would Sam think of his name? Would he be happy or angry for it having taken him so long to finally do? Would he think it rude that a relative stranger offered up one name and Dean had jumped on it where he had offered ten, twenty, thirty only to be shut down each time?
“Don’t thank me yet son, you’ve got a lot of thinking to do and not all of it will be fun.”
He closes the barn door and says a weak goodnight to Remy before settling for the night. His hand touches cold metal as it slips into his pack as he reaches for his spare clothes, but he decides against changing his shirt or pants so he tosses the bag within arms reach. The blanket is large enough to act as a barrier from the floor and as a cover and once he’s between the layers he created he reaches out and extinguishes the lantern.
After a brief introduction to some of the workers Dean will be working side by side with, they head back to the main house. During dinner they seem to have a consistent stream of people to meet, hopping from one table to the next.
“Here, have some of this, I love my ma regardless but she ain’t the best cook,” Cas says snapping back to himself. He steps closer and pulls a flask from his pocket and tosses it the rest of the distance before retreating back to the door and leaning against it. He must be able to see his reproachful expression at the retreat because he says, “Ma and Pa would have my hide if I dirtied my dinner clothes.” He nods as though he knows what that’s like.
“Ma’am I hate to pry, but how is it that you came to own your farm? Most women I’ve come across are the wives of the owner instead of the owner themselves.”
“Sweet dreams Hannah,” Castiel whispers before heading again to the stairs.
“Yes, god, do it.”
“Sorry Ma.” His brother at least has the decency to look a bit chastised as he pulls their ma into a hug.
“Have you thought about where you would want to go for school, if you are able to put off the wants of your mother for the time being? You could go and become a teacher like you want to,” he adds as Cas hands him the oil can. He tries to ignore that spark that still settles up his arm when Cas’ hands brush against his. From the corner of his eye, he catches Cas flex his hand before gripping it into a tight fist.
Knowing it's later than he should be up, Castiel makes his way upstairs. He changes quickly, eager to get as much sleep as he can, but he’s unable to help his underlying avidity to prove yet again that Hannah is in fact safe and at home. It may have been nearly two weeks since she had returned to the farm on the mend but there was a part of Castiel that needed the proof time and time again.
He pivots on his toes a few times, his internal debate raging before he decides that he can ask Cas to get his clothes for him at breakfast. Dean turns to leave but the faintly heard conversation catches his attention.
“Yeah he was home when Jody came by to talk to me about it, he had his concerns, mostly the same ones as you, but he understood quickly.”
Ringer doesn’t like the sound of the shot if his protests are anything to go by, but he’s not trying to run off or losing all his composure so Dean counts that a win.
“Hmm,” he says with a raised eyebrow and an ‘oh well’ expression. “It’d probably be best not to let my pa see it.” And just like that the conversation seems finished.
. As he had that night, Dean still doesn't know what Cas meant with that statement. And as that night, he still desperately wants to.
He and Sam head into the kitchen afterwards to settle afterwards and to figure out exactly what to do with the information they gleaned from that little session and where to go from here.
The bruising had been the worst part, with the pain diminishing a few days after the incident and the mobility returning before a week had passed. He was out of the sling after only three redressings—the fabric untied only to check his healing and his joints mobility—but the bruising had still been an issue, yellow and green splotches stretched around the curve of his shoulder and across the blade of it on his back, it made sleeping an extra pain as he’d taken to moving around again after his binding had been done away with.
It doesn't help the matter that as the day goes on, Gabriel’s look turns into a smile that Castiel would quite like to wipe off his face. He doesn’t know why it's there and he doesn’t think he wants to know.
The taller one spins his gun already drawn, not a second later the ground beneath them uproots as a bullet strikes into it. If it was meant as a warning shot Dean doesn’t listen to the threat. He draws his pistol as pain slices through his arm, he bites out a shout and looks down quickly. A decent sized chunk of his skin and muscle has been shot clean off his bicep, the edges are torn, muscle trying to hold on but failing, and blood pours down his arm. Licking hot trails down towards his fingers eager to drip off into the dirt.
Jack sends him a little nod before walking back to his room, hopefully, his facade was built well enough and he’s not about to stare dejectedly at the ceiling for hours and hours.
Like I said in the notes of this series I am not in the correct state to really get into the nitty-gritty of trauma, grief, guilt, self-hatred, or anything like that so it might seem like I'm really glossing over bits that could (or should) be expanded upon. I am doing the max I can to write those parts without putting myself at risk. I hope you can understand.
When day breaks on the fourth morning, Castiel knew he would be working with him again, what with his father requesting Remy be ready at dawn.
His breathing turns shallow as Cas thumbs the hammer, his face heats when Cas tilts his head and his farm roughed hand squeezes back on the trigger. It lights him up in ways that send his thoughts into a spiral of want to see hands that are capable of being so gentle and kind wrapped around the unforgiving metal of a gun. Paired together it does things to Dean he doesn’t want to dissect.
my fault, my blame isn’t misplaced as yours is,” he says, trying his best to keep the harshness from his voice.
He thought back to that first moment he knew he was in trouble with his feelings for Cas - he knew he was in trouble based on physical reaction the moment he laid eyes on him but that moment, when Cas looked at Chuck and said they were making it up as they went, solidifying himself in Dean’s life despite what the fucking books said and somewhere deep in his mind a little light bulb went off as it clicked.
Dean works it over in his mind, a few minutes with the children certainly wouldn’t hurt unless they then went about telling their parents but Dean knows Cas would make sure that this was kept between the lot of them.
