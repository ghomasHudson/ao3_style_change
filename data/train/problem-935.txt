Who was he kidding? Of course Sherlock would try to defend him as much as possible no matter how strained their relationship was so all he could do was nod at the words Sherlock had said. He took Sherlock’s hand in his and knelt in front of him, to have better access at treating the wound.
Mrs. Hudson excused herself for a bit, and returned with a bouquet of the azalea, still fresh because Sherlock asked her to nurture both bouquets. Keep it alive, and for Mrs. Hudson, it's just her way of reassuring herself Sherlock was as alive as the beautiful flowers.
“It would have been too risky. I wouldn’t have risked your life, John. It would have been better if you believed that I died to make it more believable to the public view and to Moriarty’s snipers, and if… I had actually… died in those two years,” He had said it as soft as he could. But from the look of John’s eyes widening in horror indicated that maybe any attempt to lower his volume in an empty, silent room wouldn’t be any help anyway.
“I… I don’t know… Sometime around Rosie’s Christening?” Rosie was already hiding her face in the crook of her elbow, trying hard to not sob nor cry, while Sherlock was gently rubbing her back.
"If... That is.. Only if Mary consent to what we dreamt of," smiling sadly, he grabbed John's hand and intertwining it.
Mycroft had let them stay in his room because he still had to fix the mess his brother made of the murders, also giving them room to discuss and digest the newly obtained information. While drinking their complimentary scotch, Lestrade finally broke the silence between the two men.
"Oh fuck, Sherlock. You're doing so good," he moaned and clenched Sherlock's hair tight in his grip. When he felt Sherlock removing him from his mouth, he could hear a faint chuckle from him while he himself let out a tiny whimper at the loss of contact.
He was all sorted, with his black suit and assassin clothes that fits all his favorite tools used in any of his work of arts. Fast forward to when he reached London, straight to Lord Moran's office to get the rest of his briefings for the case. He got six codenames, complete with their exact schedules regarding of their whereabouts and of when they'll be there, in order to make these murders a swift one.
"Oh Sherlock..." he sighed, resigned, when he saw the man walking back through the front door, greeted by a concerned Mrs. Hudson. He just hoped for the best for his little brother.
“That you really do love me,” that was not wrong, but it had caught the air in John’s throat. Acknowledging it had seemed wrong, out of place, considering of what he had done to Sherlock. And yet, Sherlock had accepted him back in no matter what condition, because, what? Because-
Hell, that was it. He turned his head and captured Sherlock's lips with his own not too gently while he tried to pull down Sherlock's pants. Thank God it was just sweats, so he doesn't have to bother working with pesky buttons and zippers. Sherlock trailed his kisses to John's throat, alternating them with bites and licks which left John weak to his knees. And Sherlock didn't keep him up, instead he slowly pushed both of them down on the cold floor.
a gun wouldn't suffice, so he carefully withdrew a spare Gerber Mark II dagger from underneath his coat and rested his gun hand on top of the one holding the dagger firmly. He would rather prefer a twisted bayonet dagger but this rare dagger was rewarded to him just after his one year of service. He'd see it as good luck, even though he doesn't really believe in luck. He shook off the train of thoughts in his mind and leaned just a little bit onto the wall to make sure the door wouldn't hit his face full force if the person outside kicked in with maximum energy, and kept his sight to the door.
In the midst of his train of thoughts, a long, black car stopped beside him on the street. A tall man, quite serious by the looks of his posture and general gestures, got out of the car and stood in front of him.
“So have I. And I hope no one would barge in at this hour, in this reality,” Sherlock smirked at this before pushing John to the sofa and lost himself in a passionate kiss and John caressed his cheekbones before their tongue explored each other’s mouth, battling for dominance.
"John stop it you're making me so red!" And he was self conscious about it too, because not everyday the great Sherlock Holmes would deduce the heat rising up to his face was out of embarrassment and not in anger or frustration. More laughs filled the air when John made Sherlock blush more and Sherlock was continuously pouting and playfully sulking at him and hiding his face in the crook of John's neck.
“That night… That night I was very angry with you, of course, because you had me thinking for two years that my best… friend, was dead and it turns out later that you are alive and of all the days you could have made your appearance, you chose the most special night of my life,” he presses his forehead in frustration.
I did expect this to be long, but it became longer than I anticipated but hope you got a good read of the burst of emotion of the characters in the story :)
"Mrs. Hudson, what's wrong? What's with the long face?" he asked, partly joking, because he hated how the atmosphere just shifted.
“LIES! Everything you do is lie, Sherlock! Don’t involve Mary into this. I bet if you solved a case without me, you’d finish faster because you wouldn’t have to explain everything to me all the time. I’m just there as someone to listen to you and make you feel good aren’t I?” There. If you listened closely, you could’ve heard the sound of whatever remained of Sherlock’s heart shatter. The only plausible reaction he could make was to break eye contact before John could read the hurt from his eyes and let him know about it as subtly as he could.
"I didn't know why he chose these flowers. It's a bit hard to find in florists. Should've just gave me sunflowers or lilies and I would take care of it just the same," she continued, muttering the word in a confused but appreciative tone. Like ones they'd use when finding some efforts too far-fetched or if someone does to extra length for no reason.
"You're cute when you blush," he giggled. "And yes of course I'll bear with you, you intelligent git. I've dealt with you for years before so I know what I'm dealing with and I still want it. Still want
happen! And you might think "oh it's okay because I could've die for real" but that just doesn't bloody justify anything!" he sighed, trying to regain his patience. "Still stubborn, you are. Why is it so difficult to digest the fact that there are actual people out there caring for you and that they didn't want to mourn only once because you could have died again, no, we prefer not to mourn at all!"
. Sherlock could feel John's presence nearing him and when he touched Sherlock's shoulder, he unintentionally flinched at the touch but didn't make any reassuring or apologetic eye contact afterwards anyway.
“Sherlock. Can you talk to me? Please?” And with that, Sherlock turned his head slowly and squinted at the sight of John.
The room was now a mess of echoes. Sounds of moans, slaps, pants and wet kisses were all mingled around each other. They moved from fucking Sherlock on the wall back to the floor, with John lain down while Sherlock was being fucked on top of him, moving up and down and rolling his hips now and then. Once John was nearing his climax, he pressed Sherlock's hips so hard that it could bruise, to hold him in place while he thrust hard and fast into Sherlock, enjoying the tightness of him and the pleasure cry from Sherlock when he hit the blissful bundle of nerves with every hard thrust. Sherlock, who rarely ever curse would often times hiss out a curse at how good John felt inside him.
fucking smile. 'I'm happy for him', was what he spoke most of all the whole wedding and reception, and it was true. He was indeed happy for his best friend, John Watson and his newlywed wife. But he had hoped that it took a different turn. Though in all candor, that will never happened. Sherlock Holmes, as always, will end up last and most of all, alone. 'Alone is what I have. Alone protects me', was now a mantra for him, making him feel less like a failure to actually be wed by—no, no. Don't think about that.
"Don't think I could recall who he is. I'm sure it doesn't matter," the response earned him a scoff from Mycroft, before he retrieved his phone to open a picture of John and pressed the screen onto the glass barrier between them, giving Sherlock a chance to clearly see the picture. When he was sure Sherlock was looking at the picture, he asked in complete dissatisfaction, "Ring any bell?". Slowly, Sherlock reached out and rested the tip of his fingers on the glass, directly above John's picture, as if trying to reach out for the real thing.
the assassin was inside, most probably waiting for Mycroft to casually come back to the office. After a few straining seconds, they hear a faint code from their earpieces indicating a safe go to proceed further. The leading guy knocked on the door, as if he was just a messenger passing important notes to Mr. Holmes.
"Oh I kind of got interrupted while I was proposing. Where's Sherlock?" he tried changing the topic because he's there to talk to Sherlock. Not talk about Mary.
was an understatement; he'd be there for such a long time because even if he wouldn't want to believe it, his brother was undeniably a murderer. His brother was back and alive, but his mind wasn't. His mind was somewhere deep within him, locked by Moriarty and keys thrown into the sea. And he will try to find that key to bring his brother back. He had some memory flashes nevertheless, so that's good. Least somewhere inside his mind was fighting back the manipulation set upon him, so he just needed to assist, but
“Waste my time again, John Watson, and I won’t hesitate to have you removed from Baker Street by force,” he responded before going into the room and an echo of the door slamming shut and the click of the lock had been the cue for John to go back to his room.
“I can’t tell you for sure. But if he wakes up and he sees us, I’m sure it will make him feel better, okay?” At first Rosie was just pouting at him because obviously it didn’t calm her down as much as she hoped but after a few moments she suddenly tensed upon looking over Sherlock’s lain head. She was comically frozen, and that made Sherlock bewildered.
"Sir, are you in?" he casually asked through one side of the door while looking at the rest of his teammates, nodding when he heard movement from inside the office. In sync, all of them raised their gun and pointed it towards the door, ready to kill as per ordered.
“You won’t lose me. Never again,” he gave a quick peck on his lips, sealing the promise at the tip on his lips, between John and Sherlock. If there’s one thing he hadn’t expected to occur in his life, was to find someone who was willing to put maximum effort to be with him but not neglecting everyone else. But he had found a brave soldier, with nerves of steel and heart of gold that was going through a war zone of obstacles to end up with him. He was right in front of him, and he is
Drugs are liquid gold that runs through your veins, dancing with your blood in the streams under your skin. You don't need the adrenaline from running around London or the thrill of solving an impossible case to feel the bliss. All you need are syringes and pure crystals to blur your vision from the bad of the world.
"Are you sure about this, Sherlock?" John asked, for consent, and for confirmation while his hands rest on top of Sherlock's shirt. This could as well be too quick, but at the same time they had waited for too long to had missed this opportunity early on. Sherlock had placed his hand on John's neck and caressed it slowly.
Sherlock wasn't really having the best time back in London. The scene at the restaurant had made it to the media, and the people who felt as betrayed as John weren't exactly keeping their mouths shut. 221B isn't a hard place to find, and neither was he. A lot of curses and a lot of praises came to him. It was overwhelming. Especially for him. And the only person there for him at the moment is Mrs. Hudson, constantly checking up on him, making him tea and keeping him distracted from the hassle of the street. She knew how hard it was for Sherlock to keep a steady face, constantly holding a mask over himself, when in reality the mask is cracking. But given that, she was still surprised when Sherlock told her about his plans for the coming future. It would help him maintain the mask without having emotional connection damaging it. And he explicitly said that he'd only call or send letters to Mrs. Hudson.
“Really, John. You of all people should know I am anything but. It’s a facade for work, so to speak. Do keep up, John,” the comment was followed by a classic eye roll to hide the fact that he was slightly hurt by the impression.
John, for the second, even ditched his anger and look almost sympathetic towards Sherlock when he realized the hesitation in his statement but he was still expecting an answer. He can't
Sherlock Holmes was engaged to someone so mediocre as the loyal Dr. John Watson. The shock receded quickly, and the man was in full doctor mode. Eerie how all medical staffs had that ability and reminded of how John had always took care of him professionally back then. He was finally granted access into the vehicle, and frantically went beside John, holding his hand tightly as if the pressure was the only thing that could keep him alive and to keep himself grounded. The heart monitor was steadily but slowly beeping, imitating John’s heartbeat. The respiratory rate was below normal, but not critical. Almost critical. Anywhere below normal is never good.
When he pushed the door open, he noticed that Mrs. Hudson was away, probably with her friends playing bingo or poker somewhere she never ever mentioned before to the boys. But the whole building was strangely... still. John just brushed the thought off as maybe from not being there for such a long time. Maybe the air changed in the place, a bit of a foreign feeling to him. The building wasn't always occupied anyway. He made his way up two steps at a time, showing a bit of excitement to go and meet Sherlock, proving to him that hey, it's just like the good old days. A whole script was already prepared in his mind-about work, about the newest case Lestrade had been fussing on, about Mary, about the wedding, and about a dog he's about to get because he knew how Sherlock loves dogs even when he wont admit it. All those just flew out of the window of his mind when he saw how the door of their... well,
"You're... You're John Watson?" John followed suit and mirrored Sherlock's action to walk closer to the glass.
"Oh John! I thought I'd never see you again! Did you propose to her yet?" Shit. He forgot he told Mrs. Hudson.
"Fine. Fine, just wait here for a hundred years if you want. Go on wasting your life waiting for someone who doesn't even bloody care about you!" he got up and walked to the door in a frustrated manner, near stomping his way out. "I hope you get your sense back," nodding a farewell to Sherlock, he stepped out of the confinement.
"I really did thought he was dead when I lost track of him. But now he's back, and he had flashbacks, fragments of memories from the past," he turned to John midway the sentence, "and he had even written your initials on his sleeves, reacted positively to a picture of you and your name. I believe, if we go see him on our own assigned time to talk to him or just simply spend time with him, the brainwash effect could fade away slowly," he sighed as he relaxed his shoulders significantly. The verbal conversation had drained so much, he wondered how much it would tire him to actually commit to this
If people ever said about time being still as a ridiculous metaphor, they’d obviously never experienced anything like at the exact moment. John had said everything out loud, inside the perimeter of the crime scene and in front of the present Scotland Yarders. It wasn’t embarrassment that Sherlock felt (well maybe a bit) but the emotion that clouded everything was betrayal, fear and despair. The giant, gray, cloud of hurt. Everyone stood still, mainly because it was a sensitive situation, so fragile that one careless move could cause so much more than a catastrophe, but Sherlock, the self-acclaimed sociopath and the seemingly cold machine, was unblinkingly still, unmistakenably as if having a malfunction. Suddenly all of Sherlock’s scars started to ache, because the betrayal he felt rooted from the two horrific years of ‘hide-and-seek’ as John had poetically called it, and the bullet scar in his chest which resembled of his effort to restart his heart and of Mary’s scar which took her away from John and caused him to be a subject of mental abuse for being the sole cause of her death. For John being a widower and for Rosie being left without a mother. His eyes started to feel itchy from the dam threatening to spill out all of his hateful tears, to expose his vulnerable sadness. His right hand that held the signs of PTSD started to tremble slightly at the fear he felt deep in his chest. Why does it hit him straight to the heart, like a blunt dagger that had to be repeatedly thrust in to reach his heart? Why must John’s words hurt, so much.
. He turned it around and see a picture of himself-a candid photo of him smiling. He remembered that moment when John took out his phone to take a picture of the scene but maybe he accidentally pressed the snap button and captured his smile instead.
“Why is it such a big deal for you? Friends move on rather quickly, but you-” Shit. He can’t be caught off guard. Sherlock shouldn’t know the truth. It could hurt him more and he’s hurt enough by everything.
A few hours passed, and it's finally time for Lestrade to look at Sherlock after two years. This may or may not be the sarcastic, smart-arse man that helped him in the yard over the years. He grabbed the tray that was handed to him and walked towards Sherlock's room. Upon arriving, the first thing he did was to put the tray through into Sherlock's cell.
"Well, I just happened to be locked up because I was careless. Just this once," Lestrade just hummed an answer. Seemingly like he wouldn't give out a verbal, more clear words, Sherlock continued the conversation further. "It's a funny thing; all of you said I worked for the law. But Moriarty made me the best
“And I love you too,” John head snapped back up, staring back into the verdigris eyes that was so full of unexpected compassion and care. He hadn’t expected that at all. All he could see inside those eyes the last time he dared to lose himself in the stare was emptiness, but now he was blessed with the spark he missed in those eyes.
John was aware he was spitting venom because if Sherlock’s expression was anything to go by, he was immensely hurt. Like a child being separated from his longtime best friend. But he couldn’t stop his mouth before he regretted anything.
"Any of those pesky women you dated been this good? This... delightful?" he flicked his tongue on the tip before citing the last word and smirked when he hear the ragged breath from John.
Half past one, and John was still up. Awake and reminiscing. Was he being a little shit to Sherlock earlier? That bastard deserved it. John just felt like he was being played with when he grieved for a living human being. But Sherlock had listened to his little speech, to his plea for him to not be actually dead. In a way, Sherlock was granting his one wish before he left to god knows where. Is that apology-worthy? It's debatable. It's hard for John to actually decide if it's worth it or not. But at least he could offer a little visit tomorrow, like Mary said. John felt very lucky to have Mary, because like this situation, she sees ahead when he's stuck in the past. And she's also his future wife, is she? Will Sherlock coming back disturb this future?
Almost on cue, he heard short murmurs from the landlady. But, he could also hear the voice of someone else. Recognizable but indistinctive from that distance because it was as if they were whispering, cautious of their tone in case Sherlock would be shocked by a generic volume of speech. He tried to reposition himself so that his hearing isn't blocked by the soft cushion of the sofa. What he heard sounded like an exchange of concerns. Not surprising considering his state but he's curious on who cared enough to check up on him apart from his landlady and occasionally, his brother or DI Lestrade.
"To the man who never fails to amaze, and never fails to protect. And for every sacrifice, for he shall be remembered" and for the message of the flower, shall they keep the promise.
They couldn't even argue about it. Because Sherlock looked calm and content like that, leaving with the sight of the people who had been there for him in the depths of life. And he left with a vow from Greg, that he won't ever forget the detective who always intentionally mispronounce his name. No tears of sympathy. Just good memories to revisit. He made a vow, one that didn't break Sherlock more.
“I’m sure your impeccable Yarders can proceed from this point onwards, Detective Inspector. And I don’t mean by only this case.” John had saw the surprise in Lestrade’s eyes when Sherlock casually cut ties with his work in front of everybody. Then Sherlock averted his gaze to Donovan, who subconsciously shift her weight from one leg to another when she felt the sharpness of his gaze, squinting his eyes in disgust, before making his final comment on scene,
"Sherlock, please. I'm sorry," A bit too forced of a tone, but he needed to get this across. Sherlock sucked a breath and muttered his response.
about his drug activity and about his relationship with Janine to John. Not that it was necessarily real nor serious, anyway, but it was necessarily relevant to gain better access to information in this recent case in his hands.
He was a bit hazy in his thoughts throughout the walk to the food truck Sherlock was talking about, and he must have realized this, because Sherlock asked him what's wrong.
“John, he’s getting away!” Sherlock screamed as he used his signature blue scarf to push down the knife wound on his left thigh. John, recognizing his queue, ran after the 6 foot tall culprit on the slippery rooftop. It wasn’t at all a good idea to have a chase on a rooftop after a rain but this culprit was a serial rapist AND killer so they had to push aside all worries to catch this monster. He was close, oh so very close, when the criminal decided to turn around and swung the knife in mid air, just a few inches in front of John, startling him. The guy must have seen the lack of defense and the guard being put down for a moment so he decided to run back where he came from, forgetting that Sherlock was in that exact direction. He sprinted past John and pushed him aside, hard. By the time he reached Sherlock, he was pinned down with a full body weight of a 6 foot, bloodied detective. While keeping the criminal lying helplessly, he searched frantically for a familiar silhouette of his beloved doctor, his newly-declared partner.
“Why would someone risk his life multiple times for someone if… If it weren’t for… love?” he smiled shyly and looks at his feet, avoiding eye contact for the time being. He continued when John wasn’t giving his piece of thought.
Sherlock was silent for a bit before asking, "You're... Lestrade?" and got a simple nod as an answer from the man.
fault!” his hand was now shaking from the overwhelming emotions he’s feeling. He couldn’t take it anymore. ‘
He’s clutching his right hand with his gloved left in an attempt to stop the bleeding but it served no purpose whatsoever. It only helped him feel more pain, and distract him from the one inside his chest. A distraction was what he needed then and there. Pain might’ve been a very bad choice, so he looked up the sky. Judging from how clear the sky was, it must be somewhere around after 2 in the morning. He took off his left leather glove to retrieve his phone from his coat pocket, and as if on queue, a ping was heard. Hesitantly, he grabbed the phone and glancing quickly at the time before reading whatever notification had came in. 03:47a.m. It’s so late for him to be out at this time. No wonder he was freezing. He glanced downwards and saw a name he never would’ve expected. He had expected Mycroft’s meddling because like Sherlock, he just doesn’t sleep. It was a text that made him as anxious as he is relieved about it.
Readjusting the pen in his grip and looking at a sharp line he made when he put too much pressure, he let out a long breath in attempt to calm himself before going back to the experiment.
“Nothing happened to me, John. I seem to be indestructable,” Sherlock uttered while he boiled the water while letting the rest of the sentence mumbled from his lips,
"Your coldness and stubbornness was what caused Mary's death! Of course I bloody deserve the goddamn information!" The sharp tip of the pen dug into the notepad a bit upon receiving the vile statement.
Minutes after John arrived, they really thought Sherlock just locked himself in but then they hear the click from the bathroom door of it opening, they both simultaneously turned towards the small corridor. And they set eyes on a partly frightened and shocked Sherlock.
“I told you before, and I will tell you a thousand times more. Yes, I am happy you are here and that you are special to me,” he let go of Sherlock’s arm and look away in resignation.
"That doesn't really answer the question, Sherlock," he turned his head towards the taller man, and Sherlock stopped in his tracks, turning so both of them were properly facing each other.
“You could tell me, please. I’m your… friend,” he uttered the last word in a lower tone, as if he wasn’t sure if that term was still valid between them. But Sherlock had decided that distractions was his go-to solution out of the conversation.
"I was quite alright, I suppose. After Sherlock 'died', I tried to get my life back together again, even managed to meet someone too for a few weeks, and then
, a scripted answer. Of course he uses the friendliness and coldness to his advantages in many cases but it is an advantage for him personally as well. Being cold lets him get away with feeling too much emotion which are very much bothersome.
been in love!" those words just spilled itself out of John's mouth, no second thoughts and from the looks of it, no regrets either.
“I don’t want to ruin more than I already did. You’re married, John. You need to figure that part out,”
"Sherlock?" John called out with a soothing tone. Mrs. Hudson must've warned him beforehand. Sherlock wanted to respond, call out his name as soothing as John did with his, but his voice was stuck at his throat. All he could manage was a raspy hum, just to indicate his whereabout.
“He-he fell when he was chasing the criminal after I was… wounded. My leg had already treated but I’m afraid for John. I don’t know how bad, even the doctors couldn’t tell on the spot,” the little child in his hands hugged tighter upon listening to this revelation.
They spent the rest of the day talking about everything else, anything to not look back at the harsh reality that's been set firmly in the background. But mostly Mrs. Hudson did the talking and Sherlock would just squeeze in the little tell tale with a sassy remark or his own joke.
He grabbed a fountain pen beside him and started to jot down some notes all the while still focusing into the microscope.
, John is really curious. Sherlock didn't really explain what he did during the two years. Just that Moriarty had to be stopped. But that's as far as he said. No details. John sat down on his old armchair, making himself cozy and telling Mrs. Hudson that he'll be waiting for Sherlock, which she agreed to without a second thought.
others don’t hurt others, John. Mistakes, yes. But this is one huge mistake that both of us had done, and I couldn’t afford to make another one that I most probably regret; such as having hopes for you,”
They shifted on and on trying to get in the most comfortable position to deepen the kiss and once it grew heated, their hands frantically search for the opening of their shirts, working on the buttons. But once Sherlock pushed John’s jacket off him, he suddenly froze in place, rethinking this moment.
"He's not in London. Of course it would take him time to even realize that there's something wrong because I never failed in any of the mission I've been sent to,"
"I know it's your first, with a man I mean, and I'm honored that you're okay with me being the first one," he said while he squeezed a dollop of lube on his fingers.
is amazing," he gave a small smile. "She helped me a lot, especially when I was mourning and was falling hard after Sherlock's supposed death. She's just heaven sent". They knew that they should be talking about the more pressing matter on hand, but they needed the distraction, even just for a fraction of second.
John probably took more time than necessary to step back to 221B to give even Mrs. Hudson a visit, because only five days later he dropped by Baker Street after work. It was fairly late in the evening, and without looking at his watch, it probably was a little past 7pm when he arrived the doorstep. The sky isn't showing yet the hints of the light blue disappearing, and for John it was somewhat metaphorical of how the light shimmer of hope isn't yet to fade and be blown away by mere slip of the tongue.
"Th-then you'll love every bit of today," he said in between pants, enjoying every moan that he manage to form from John's mouth.
“You,” John answered simulatineously with Sherlock’s question of ‘who’, which left him wide-eyed, still disbelieving what was happening in front of his two eyes. John had looked away almost immediately after indicating the receiving end of the confession was indeed Sherlock himself, as if in shame. It shouldn’t be. He put his hands on the sides of John’s face and force him to make eye contact. In the midst of John’s confusion, he managed to deduce the honesty in him.
"Donovan was right, I should've stayed away from you since the first day and not be stupid enough to be pulled in, because all it ever did was bring me utter misery. Now tell me, you
doctor, Holmes,” the man under him said in such disgusting pride enveloping the words, while holding out a…ring. God forbid Sherlock to decapitate the man then and there, but he needed to be justified for everything else he had done to countless others. So he opted for shouting for the Yard’s assistance.
“Mycroft, where is Sherlock? Why did Mrs. Hudson say that Sherlock isn’t gonna be in 221B for at least a few months more?”
That earned him a silent, thoughtful stare from Sherlock before he began asking in a small voice, "Why did I carved your name on my wrist? It's not what best friends would do, right? I had the strong urgency to not forget your name when I had the flashes of memories. Jim... Jim tried to stopped me once but I wouldn't let go of the knife," he pursed his lips as he remembered the panic in Moriarty's eyes when he saw how much Sherlock was bleeding from the cut and he sat with Sherlock the whole week, treating him like his whole world.
John was bewildered of what to do. How to react. Who wouldn’t be, if they heard such angry confession in their face? Sherlock was clenching his hair, making it into an array of mess, when John tried to reach for one of his arms.
"So, I'm just being held captive to be tested experimentally to see if I remember my old life? Might as well put a bullet in me," both of them simultaneously sighed.
could offer was a sigh. Does this have anything to do with him? Because he sure does feel guilty. Mrs. Hudson sat him down and offered to make tea for the man. Probably talk over a few things over tea.
“Shut up, Sherlock! Do not ever say stupid things again, because that’s my role. You never ruined anything. From the bottom of my heart, I was genuinely happy you came back, although that night I didn’t really show that,” Sherlock could only look bewildered at first before giving John a tight smile. Why would Sherlock believe him if all he ever did was hurt him back?
Upon arrival, Mrs. Hudson had fussed about his presence, thanking him because she was worried about Sherlock. The door was locked, and he hadn't been making as much noise that day. Of course, being the man he was, he tried to reassure her that maybe Sherlock was just sleeping the effects of the drugs off. Maybe he decided to stop taking it and was just working through the withdrawal with the easiest solution on hand—sleep.
"Come on, Sherlock. Make me shout," he said while moving his hand over his perspiration on his temple. Sherlock held John's waist as both of their hips meet repeatedly hard and every hit had sent them to a string of broken moans and breathless mumbles until John trembles under him.
“The only person who never called me a freak, or even considered me as one in any other terms. I honestly felt stupid, John, for letting you under my skin and destroying myself for you. Truly I wished I was the machine you once accused me of but, I’m… I’m just human, John. I’m just…” his voice broke at the last word, and the uncharacteristic detail of that worry John beyond imagination. The thought that he might have managed to break Sherlock beyond repair scared him. He had put Sherlock through hell in and out whenever he had troubles containing his anger and never once he thanked him? He had just called his best friend a freak. Were they still even friends?
After a few minutes he stood staring at the empty walls of the hallway, deep in thought, he walked again towards Mycroft's office. When he entered and was greeted by an anxious Lestrade, he sat down on his chair and let out a heavy sigh.
“Believe what?” John asked, scoffing, because he thought that Sherlock was just playing him. Or maybe saying things out of pity.
"Which is?" she asked, not satisfied with how he handles the situation. But she didn't know what she had expected, honestly, because she wasn't given an answer. All he gave was a quick glare. It was clear that the conversation found it's full stop for the night. She turned to the back car window, seeing Sherlock eyeing the cab driving away. And he didn't look anything like what she saw from the restaurant or even before in the papers. He looked hollow. Just within a few seconds of looking back at the lanky man, he just turned around, walking in slow steps to the opposite direction, head low and chest heaving. She saw the side of Sherlock that John always refused to believe-the vulnerable child starving of affection, but only got dust.
"The worst part now is that he doesn't remember anything. He thinks we are monsters under the bed, and we don't love him. He trusts Moriarty like his own partner," he spoke this out slower than usual. "You said
"He did apologize. You didn't listen," Mary gave a small smile before giving him a pat on the shoulder. "Go check on him later, John".
"Everybody have a soft spot for kindness and hey put more trust onto friendly figures with information they seek for. That, for me as a consulting detective, is an advantage. I use a friendly facade to solve cases and maintain a cold one in the other times because it's not as necessary outside of cases. It's as simple as that, John, that even a brain like yours could've form an answer like that," That, even for him, felt like a scripted answer. It, in a way,
?" Well, that phrase was common but it felt like he was quoting Sherlock whenever John came back from a date every now and then. God knows how he managed to deduce his date without even seeing who that was half the time.
"Why is it that you never care about your well-being?" he chuckled sarcastically. "The work always comes first for you,"
“Sherlock! It got to the point I didn’t want to eat or leave my house, I might as well die along with you!” He shouldn’t have shouted but he was getting frustrated at this conversation. Sherlock just stepped back. In guilt? In shock? Seemed like an accumulation of every single emotion logical in this situation.
. Right here right now, I want to taste you, I want to fuck you," Sherlock was breathing heavily by now, lust slowly taking over his mind completely. Upon seeing Sherlock like this and wanting to take John right then, the hairs on his neck stands on its end.
As he look at him entering Sherlock many times, Sherlock also began to massage himself fast and that's just a blessing to his eyes-seeing Sherlock being brought down like this, desperate and aching for him. After a few more hard strokes with the deep thrusts, Sherlock came screaming John's name while having his head back and the clench around John made him came hard into Sherlock as well, which he milked completely.
Mrs. Hudson sat down on Sherlock's chair, opposite of John. And John somewhat doesn't like seeing someone else on that chair but Sherlock, but Mrs. Hudson deserve a comfortable seat and not the hard wooden client chair. It's far more appropriate. She thought that John at least deserved to know what she does.
“My God, Sherlock that’s…that’s horrible. But couldn’t you…” the questions were starting and he doesn’t like it one bit. Sherlock looked at John, signaling him to finish his question.
“Oh, you’re a new one. The other apparition would just…mock away and blame me for everything,” he sighed and closed his eyes.
“Will he be okay?” with a sigh, Sherlock placed one hand on top of Rosie’s head and softly pat her head.
"A couple's retreat," Sherlock groused. "I've seen pictures; that place deserves more than something as base and boring as that."
Anthea wanted to punch Mycroft. Okay, so that wasn't anything new, but this time she thought that she might actually do it. She wanted to go to prom; the tall, posh git didn't. Because if he had, then they could have gone together and avoided ninety percent of what the bastard had been complaining about.
He checked himself in the lift mirrors one last time and then stepped out when the lift landed on his floor. He took his cane in hand and hobbled up to the front desk.
They looked up to see the boisterous celebrity chef, Angelo Bartolomeo, standing there with a candle in one hand and the wine menu in the other.
"Bloody hell, Watson," Marrow boomed, causing John to wince in pain from the sound of it. "I don't know how you did it, but digging out the bullet when you did probably saved your life."
The more Sherlock talked, the harder John gripped the edges of their table. By the time Sherlock had finished explaining, John had a white-knuckle grip on it.
They were still dating. It was one of the reasons he turned down their invite to come out for Christmas. He couldn't take seeing them so god damned happy and raining on their parade wouldn't be a very brotherly thing to do.
Sherlock raised up slightly so that he could look John in the eye. "And you are the most incredible man I've ever met, my heart is yours to keep."
Mr Lyons blinked in surprise that Mycroft actually deigned to raise his hand, but called on him anyway. "Yes, Mr I-have-an-opinion-about-everything?"
Sherlock was more merciful than John as he quickly divested John of his trousers, revealing a lovely pair of red trunks.
"You weren't far off the mark that Mycroft was involved. But not the way you thought." Sherlock cleared his throat. "Did you ever wonder why Mike needed to introduce us in the first place? Despite the fact that my clothes and everything else about me screamed monied?"
"Right." John grabbed Sherlock's face with both hands and brought Sherlock down for a kiss. Sherlock was surprised for a moment before he wrapped his arms around John and melted into the kiss.
"We've had conversations via text and over the phone about it, but he can't let it go. Though, when we are together he doesn't bring it up."
"I'm flattered by your interest. I really am. But it hasn't even been a year since my wife died and I'm-"
“Oh. I thought you were upset about the mobile phone being out when I should have been warming up,” he admitted.
This chapter is brought to you by a whole hell of a lot of effort, not just by me but my beta Old Ping Hai as well.
Mycroft hurried out his car and wasn't surprised to see Greg waiting for him. The other teen was leaning against the driver's side door, arms folded across his chest and ankles crossed.
"You'd think so, but other than claiming he can see ghosts, he doesn't seem to exhibit the other signs."
"People being enormous cunts is what happened," Mike growled. "He wrote a book and it was good. It just had some...themes that people didn't appreciate."
"Because everyone wants to hear me play. Like I've stopped being me and turned into a performing monkey. No one asks you to prove you play rugby, but they always ask when you play an instrument. It's hell."
John grabbed that arse and moved his cock between them. Sherlock and John groaning together. While John took his pleasure, Sherlock worked on opening his hole, using his come and sweat to prepare himself for John.
He sat in Mycroft's chair behind the desk and indicated to John to sit in the armchair in front of him.
Sherlock threw himself back against his chair and folded his arms again. "Except for one very major problem: my brother is an angry, overbearing twat with absolutely no social skills."
"Certainly sounds like it," John agreed. "How did you get involved?" He put his arm on the back of the chair and propped his head on his fist.
"Hey, I just got the latest Jaguar, and wondered if you lovelies would like a ride after school," Bertie suggested. "It's a convertible."
John was coming back from the shops when he heard the first shot. He ran up the stairs fearing the worst. While it wasn't death and destruction, it was Sherlock shooting at the walls, and that's bad enough.
"You gorgeous, gorgeous thing, I love you so much," John gasped as Sherlock proceeded to take him apart.
Hello, darlings. It has been a really busy few weeks for me, as well as a bad case of dizzy spells that are horrendous, but with any luck, you'll get two chapters this week to make up for it.
"Sherlock..." Mummy said, with a note of warning in her voice. She knew when her son was about to ask for something he shouldn't. Like the time he asked for nitroglycerin.
John rubbed his eyes and yawned. "Not really." He huffed out a sigh. "These new hires are going to kill me. I'm used to giving orders from my army days, but this training shit has got my patience down to my last nerve."
"Explains why you hate therapists," John replied. "Well, you get to reading that, I'll find other things to do with my time."
There was a slight hiccup in the seating, however. Mary sat down on one end of the sofa and Molly the other. John made his way to the open spot between them, but David leapt over the back and slid down between them.
I would have had both chapters up today but I bashed my head pretty hard last Friday, I am almost certain I have a mild concussion. So I'll have the next chapter up this Friday. I would have done the editing on Thursday but I have a son and he LOVES Halloween, so yeah. Friday it is.
John blushed. He knew who the customer was referring to and so did Mary. He couldn't help her crush on him, so he did his best to ignore it.
John's hand was ever present. In his hair, in his hand, on his thigh. It infused Sherlock with a warmth that nestled in his chest.
Sherlock straightened his shoulders and suddenly the petulant child was gone and in his place was a shrewd businessman.
Greg smiled and flicked his cigarette. He stood up and shoved his hands in his jeans' pockets. "You're not very talkative, are you?"
"Holy shit, Sherlock," John cursed after his first bite. "This is incredible. Where did you learn to make this?"
"It certainly sounds tempting..." he agreed and she smiled triumphantly. "If I were a simpleton. Which I'm not."
Sherlock rolled his eyes and flopped on a chair. "It's not like that. You know full well I found him to be odious and foul-tempered before we were stuck in Sussex together."
"And you aren't. I promise. Me working at the surgery was my last-ditch effort to appear normal. Your accident just made realize that I don't want normal. I never did. If I had wanted normal, I would have become a GP in some little country cottage with two point four children, a white picket fence, and gotten older and fatter as I dealt with colds and broken bones for the rest of my life. But even when I tried for the white picket fence, I married a former assassin. I just
"Yes," Mycroft said over their mother's shoulder, quite proudly. "Looks like you'll have to take the Tube to school for a while." He grabbed his keys, wallet, and jacket and made for the stairs.
John pulled his lover in for another hug. "Love, you could have shown up with takeaway and you and I would have been over the moon."
John took a sip of the spiced apple cider that Divya had brewed up and watched as she and Molly and Mary set to decorating the interior with Christmas decorations. The tree was up and the ornaments on. There was holly on the chimneypiece and tinsel was beginning to sprout
John took another long draft of his water. "Tall, thin, reedy-looking bloke. Clothes that were more Victorian than modern. Goatee. Smarmy bastard. Why?"
"I plan on taking you apart, inch by glorious inch," John breathed into Sherlock's neck, the dancer moaning as his eyes drifted close.
Mike shook his head. The nearby church bells began ringing out their lovely, peaceful chimes. The ghost closed his eyes and a warm ray settled on his shoulders.
Anthea looked at him approvingly. "So you know your Shakespeare. I'm impressed. But you aren't here to spout the Bard at me, so why are you here?"
Ajay laughed. "Greg, you're of age, you can go wherever the hell you want. But you know why I've got to ask."
John had to stop for a moment. The sight before him was glorious. Those gorgeous globes just begging to be fondled.
Anthea cocked her head to the side. "Right, new plan." She put her hands on her hips. "Bertie Gruner is not going to ruin this night for all of us. John will take Greg home or wherever he wants to go and come back here to finish prom with Sherlock. Mike and I will go see what Mycroft wants to do, take him home if that's what he wants and then come back and enjoy the rest of the night."
Sherlock wasn't sure which emotion took dominance. It seemed like there was a battle between fear, jealousy, anger, and distress. Victor nudged him again.
Greg wasn't having a good day. The star of his most popular show was on bedrest. He'd seen the dailies from the day of the incident and what Anderson's camera caught on film was breathtaking. In the middle of the hallway, where it looked like John was behaving like a lunatic, was a blurry figure clearly pointing a gun at Sherlock. Sally was threatening to quit every day, she'd come in and Greg would soothe her for another day.
"I spoke to my brother-in-law, and he was willing to lend you some of his old things that he doesn't fit into anymore so that you can have some things to change into while you are here and to sleep in," Sherlock explained, thrusting the pile at John.
Across the hall, Greg Lestrade was playing with his lighter, lighting it and putting it out with the tips of his fingers. He stared back at John.
"Well," John said, "despite its cliffhanger ending, I still want to finish it. Though, I might kill you for it."
"You're not going to telling me where you're taking me, are you?" John asked after a moment of silence.
Mycroft chuckled. "Oh yes. He turned in his edited manuscript earlier this week for reconsideration and today accepted a book contract from us."
Only, John had no desire to date someone fifteen years his junior. Even without all the complications that came with having feelings for a certain publicist. Maybe before he was invalided out of the army, he would have at least tapped that, but now...John shook his head.
Yay! It's done. I am so grateful this is done. After nearly seven months, I glad to be finally moving on to something else. I have written three other stories while writing this and while this was fun, it didn't hold the same attraction as the others.
When John came to that night, the stranger was standing guard at his bed. But all John could think of was the pain he was in. He took a deep breath and forced himself to focus on his apparition.
I hope you guys have enjoyed this wild ride with me. I'm always sad when a story comes to a close, but coming up next is a Miss Fisher's Murder Mysteries crossover with Sherlock set in the 1920s. Then at long last the sequel to Death and Youth. Then for a treat, a fusion with the movie 10 Things I Hate About You starring the Holmes brothers as Kat and Bianca. I also have 20 billion other ideas swirling around in my head. Including one I came up with today, a fusion with The Wizard of Oz.
"The 'never going breathe the same air as us' group," Mike snorted. "That, my friend, is Sherlock Holmes and Sally Donovan. And he's not allowed to date."
"I just described how I felt when I kissed the boy who went on to become my first and well...if I'm honest, last boyfriend," Sherlock said with a sad smile.
Hello and welcome to the latest chapter of my depression KICKING my ass. So much so that I didn't even realize that I had enough story written for a chapter. When I did realize that fact I sat down and started typing it up. I finished over the weekend and then sent it off to the wonderful Old Ping Hai.
Just then a rather large boom shook the house enough to make the chandeliers shudder and Sherlock dropped to his knees to cover his ears.
"Excuse me?" John bit out. "I spent a lot of time on that scene and you're telling me it's unnecessary?"
They hit the pavement and Sherlock hailed a cab. John was about to follow there, too, when Sherlock slammed the door in John's face.
"Yeah," John agreed, "but in those stories they usually invoke God or use spells. But this was just Sherlock telling ghosts to go away with the sheer power of his own will. Frankly I'm surprised that he didn't pass out after the first one." John took a drink of the whiskey. "Is he going to be okay?"
John's smile grew and set aside the paper to turn his complete attention to the dark-haired detective. "I told them the day after we came home from the hospital that I was quitting. Didn't even bother giving them two weeks' notice."
Bertie took a swing and nailed John right in the jaw. John fell to the floor and Bertie yelled, "Come on!"
I've started typing up part 5 and it's looking like it might be part 5 and a small epilogue. But we'll see.
Anthea burst through the cheering crowd and turned to Mike, "What happened? I just saw Bertie limp off."
Sherlock nodded, leaping up to pour himself another drink. "He originally wanted Mylock Publishing but it was pointed out that it sounded too much like the ape-like creatures from 'The Time Machine'."
There were a few moments of contented silence before Sherlock spoke. "Mycroft told you about Victor, didn't he?" he murmured.
he told the host it was because he thought the furor around the book was because it was from–and I quote "a nobody". And that having the Holmes name behind it would cause people to swing back around to make it a hit.
"Ah ha!" John cried, finding the games at last. He grabbed a couple of his old school favorites and a pack of cards (first double-checking they weren't for pinochle or something like that) to take back to Sherlock.
"Wait, is that what I think it is?" Wiggins asked, looking back and forth between Greg and Sherlock.
"Often enough that we got a generator, of course," Sherlock said, rolling his eyes. "I'll go find out what happened, let's just hope whatever it was that knocked out the power didn't knock out the mobile tower as well."
John sent out a hasty, panicked text to Mike and hoped it was enough to get the point across that this was bad. This was worse than bad, this was a full-on crisis.
Mary had come down and she patted him on the cheek on the way to the coffee machine. "I know it's one of the reasons I keep him around."
Mr Holmes cocked his head. "Is the reason for the..." he trailed off, waving a hand at John's old and threadbare clothes.
The rugby players helped him to his feet, murmuring apologies and offering to buy him drinks as recompense.
Mycroft looked toward the stage in shock and amusement. "Vauxhall Cross?" He was trying to contain his excitement but it was spilling out.
John handed Sherlock a set and sat down to eat. They talked and laughed, enjoying each other's company.
John came back and Sherlock had his dance. They danced really slow, and Sherlock held on for dear life. When he started this, he was so sure that Mycroft and Mummy had been wrong, that the world wasn't as bad as they had made it out to be. But he had gotten his taste of cruelty and it hurt.
"I have no plans of going even if someone did ask me to," Mycroft stated proudly. "And you shouldn't either. Why do you even want to go?"
The dancer had gone to get them more drinks. Not that John was finished with his, but it gave Sherlock something to do besides stand there next to John, fidgeting.
Damn it! John cursed in his head. Sherlock had invaded every corner of his mind. So much that he couldn't take a walk without thinking about the lean detective. He was about to give up and go back home, when crashing through a nearby bush came a large Mastiff with a long, blue scarf in its mouth.
"Mycroft!" a familiar voice cracked from the entranceway. John whipped his head around to see that Sherlock was standing there, his fists clenched at his sides.
He ignored John's question. "According to his doctor, he fainted. Apparently, it has been over a week since he last consumed anything besides the occasional biscuit and a cup of tea or two. Usually because Mrs Hudson made it for him." He finally turned to John, casting him an accusatory glare.
"We try to do this with as much dignity as possible, but here is always a chance that this could go badly for you. Are you all right with that?"
As for the next story, it's supposed to be the Beauty and the Beast AU, but it has been a LONG time since I worked on it because I would say I have three or four chapters worth of world building material that is important to set up the story, but I haven't even got Sherlock yet. And usually with my fan fiction I don't have to do that sort of world building I can just into the meaty parts of the story. But I can't do that with this one and it has left me frustrated. And writing out of order has never worked well for me.
John walked out of Greg's office building onto the pavement, twirling his cane. He thought back to his interactions with Sherlock and he knew that he hadn't used it when he was arguing with Sherlock over his book. Or when he quarreled with Sherlock about anything really.
John didn't like it. America was where Sherlock's ex was. But as much as he wanted to let his lizard brain take over and tag along with the company during their tour, he had his own touring to do, being on the road for what was going to be a lot of away games with his team. So he was sitting on the bed watching his lover pack for his trip.
"You'll get used to it, don't worry. I know you will. Though I might not get used to being unable to walk after sex,"
Rosie was static, and so was Sherlock. They were looking at each other in confusion while Mrs. Hudson who just recently woke up from her nap approached them, eager to share the joy which was now nonexistent.
"What do you think?" he doesn't quite fancy Sherlock's constant 'question as answer' method but that was what he had to deal with all these years so he's letting it pass. A bit flustered, he slowly slipped his hand to intertwine it neatly with Sherlock's larger hand, tucking it in place and Sherlock squeezed his hand ever so slightly almost so protectively. When they both comfortably held hands on their way to the food truck, John couldn't keep a smile off his face and noticed neither could Sherlock.
He's trembling on his bed, the crook of his arm itching to feel a sharp needle pierce through and his body felt like being compressed from bone to bone until it's breaking just like how his mind was. Breaking, and a complete mess. Information passed in lightning speed in his mind, difficult to catch up on what's happening but the most repetitive thought had always been about his ex-flatmate. He tried to stand up and walk to the kitchen where Mrs. Hudson had kept his painkillers and aspirin. It doesn't help, but it's at least made the withdrawal more bearable.
"Even though he isn't here. He must have people looking out, reporting back to him about what's happening every second. They would have already told him that you
He stood up slowly, suddenly aware that his whole body ached when John finally spoke after a long pause.
He couldn’t finish the sentence. All he could do was stop it abruptly just to protect his little heart from whatever reaction he many get if he did continue. Just to hide his hesitation, he stared into his tea, avoiding eye contact.
"No. You told me that I always wanted to win in an argument without you realizing you're always doing the same! For once, stop this. I'm tired. I'm going to rest in bed," Sherlock was frowning and just pure rage and disappointment across his face. He wanted to let the apology sink in but he felt like a complete and utter trash for coming back to someone who's moved on and now is planning to marry another person.
“No, Sherlock. Seriously, shut up. There’s a lady there traumatized because not everyday she sees a dead body like you do, and you going all impressed and going off on the criminal’s methods, it’s like you don’t give a shit about anyone’s feelings, not even me!”
The car halted to a stop, and the driver told him to get out of the car, in which he did because disobeying these guys' orders would prove to be harmful to anyone regardless of rank. He stepped onto the pavement and heard the car engine fade as it drove away behind. Looking around, his mind was hazy as he didn't know even a bit where he was. The building in front of him looked highly guarded and secure, but he still didn't know the purpose of him being there. Should he wait? Maybe, just for a few minutes and he'll try to ask the guards at the door.
“And even now, your deductions are still mostly wrong,” John wanted to argue, to have a say in this but was cut off by the gentle press of Sherlock’s lips against his. It felt as if years of surpressed feelings was lifted in just a mere contact of the lips, the density of the air lessening greatly when he felt John kissed him back after the few seconds of freezing in place. A while passed and he broke the kiss in search of air but kept their foreheads pressed so that the scent of the other lingers close.
"I adore it," he smirked and gasped when John took his penis and began to massage it firmly and in a moderate pace, before increasing the pace of his finger going in and out of him. In a matter of minutes, the room was echoed with the sounds of their moans and pants, and filled with the scent of sweat, musk and sex. John let out a long breath when he felt empty inside and glanced over to realize Sherlock was lubing his own hardness with a mix of lube and his own precum.
"Not to me it's not. You are far too young. You have your whole life in front of you and I'm not going to be your foundation. I want someone who's been through life long enough to know who they are and what they want out of this life. And I think I've found him," John pleaded with her.
Now it was Mrs Hudson who blushed. "Oh, it was the least I could do, with Sherlock standing up with his mother. I couldn't leave you standing there with no one."
Greg immediately threw another, this time hitting Mycroft in the chest. Greg laughed as the paint dripped down Mycroft's long neck and chin.
Sherlock twisted his fingers together to prevent himself from biting them. "Things are going great!" he replied around gnawing his lip.
"Hey, don't be like that, My," Greg soothed. "It was nice of them to take us in and not only provide a warm place to stay the night, but breakfast. They didn't have to do any of that."
Mike moved to his right and John followed. "For Christ's sake, John! You're behaving more like a six year old than a thirty-six year old. You're a grown man, so act like it."
They threw a huge party at Baker Street. Mycroft wasn't as spry as he used to be, Mrs Hudson had to be helped up the stairs to 221B, and Molly and Greg brought Will and Lily. But there were others there as well, former clients, members of various other police departments, friends they met along the way, all of them crammed into the tiny space that was the living room.
John nodded. He was done for the season and he and Sherlock had six lovely weeks to themselves before the dancer had to go back to the Opera House to begin the next ballet season. And this was the best way to start it.
like that and get away with it? And I was trying to get him to trip up so I could catch in the lie, but he kept dodging me." John rubbed his face with one hand.
Sherlock leaned back into his chair and folded his arms as he watched John skim through the French grammar book.
"Also, Mike is a general practitioner who has been out of rotation for a while, but knows what to do in theory. Professor then. Now Molly and Divya left John, Mike and Mary to do the actual doctoring, which suggests that while they are doctors, they are not in professions that deal with people. They both mildly smell of disinfectant. But as Molly would know, that no matter how hard one tries, one just can't quite get the smell of formaldehyde out of one's hair. A pathologist, who specializes in post-mortums then.
Sherlock glared at him. "I may be in marketing as a publicist now, but I learned to do this sort of thing, same as Mycroft."
He was shocked to silence when he saw who had answered the door, his speech dying on his tongue. He had been expecting Brook, so when he saw the small, elderly woman clothed in a plum dress, he didn't know what to say.
"Whatever," Sherlock said imperiously. "I'm sure that he thinks very highly of his nephew's playing, but have you ever heard a violin played badly? It makes seagulls sound pleasant in comparison."
"Wasn't lying apparently, I found them in a green trunk by the door," John said calmly, his voice warm and soothing.
John pressed the call button for the nurse and Amy arrived with the release papers and a wheelchair for Sherlock.
They stopped in front of Sherlock's room and John glanced through the window at his friend. Sherlock's eyes were closed, but John could see the stamps of his malnutrition on the circles under those fluttering eyelashes. His skin was sallow, having lost its healthy glow, and his cheekbones stood out more prominently then ever before. He sighed. This was the product of weeks of self-neglect. He had just been too busy to notice.
Sherlock started making breakfast while John showered, it was better than pacing the floor. He decided to make crepes as they would be both light and filling.
"Just a boy..." Mummy said, sitting down as if she were going to faint. "Love, I understand that with both you and Mycroft being homosexual, that you can't get a girl pregnant. But there are other things; drugs, diseases, and it's really not worth it. What are the two rules of this household?"
"Relax, John, I'm fine," Sherlock assured the anxious doctor. "Last time it was two malevolent spirits, one right after the other. This was simply sending someone home who didn't know how to do so on her own."
Most of his friends were trying to dissuade him, but the two people who could have succeeded weren't there at the moment. Mike had gone to get a beer and Sherlock still hadn't arrived.
James was standing on John's left, which gave his right an opening for Mary to stand, but the young nursing student had other plans.
John stopped but he looked at Sherlock in disbelief. "You promised, Sherlock. You said you'd burn it. Then delete it. Please..."
As if he would stoop to speak to me. No, he was blasting me on some podcast and let it slip it was him. My brother dug a little deeper to see if he was making it up or not.
The editor's interest was piqued. "Oh? That soldier fellow who stayed out at Musgrove and borrowed some of my things?"
"You know, when Prof Smallwood said that you were a polo player, I really didn't believe her, or you I guess," he told Greg.
Before Mike rang off, he said, "I just wanted you to know that I kicked David and Mary out after you left."
"Yeah," John replied. "I didn't mean to abscond with your book, I just had it with my things and I packed so quickly, it ended up in with the rest of it."
"Hey, Amy," he greeted. He and Sherlock had been to this hospital so often that almost all the nurses and doctors knew him.
Sherlock woke with the soft click of John closing the sitting room door. He waited until he could hear the thud of the front door closing before he was on his feet. He could feel the thrill of anticipation. This was better than a case. He would finally learn what John wanted most in the world.
Mike coughed into his hand, and then pushed his glasses up on his nose. "You see, my guy likes your guy. A lot. But they've had a fight and I was hoping you'd tell me what Mycroft's temperature was on the matter."
Greg started going over how the process would work, what his deadlines would be, what the average number of drafts was, how and when to stick up for certain things.
Just then Mycroft's phone rang. He looked at with a frown. "You'll pardon me, I have to take this. Anthea will show you to the veranda and I will be in as soon as I can."
Once the bridge was done, he finally felt like the book was ready to send off to publishers. But each rejection stung a little more. The only thing that kept him from giving up altogether was when he got a new rejection letter he would look up one of his favorite authors to see how many rejection letters they got. It was usually in the double digits, and not
This session, it was Sherlock who had a hard time concentrating on the lesson. Over and over in his head he kept wondering why straight arrow John Watson would be interested in punk rebel Sherlock Holmes. But even Sherlock would be a fool to not notice the connection between them. Maybe it was that connection that prompted popular John to ask the social pariah out.
He opened the door and turned on the lights, or rather with the shit generator, light. The study was pretty much as John remembered it, not a place that one would expect to store games. It was a quiet, austere place that felt more like a haven from fun, than one where laughter and enjoyment could be found.
Phillip Anderson was getting in fights with the editing crew, an assistant or three, and two cameramen. And those were just the incidents that had landed on Greg's desk. He had no doubt there were others, and that there would be more in the coming days. Greg had a list of complaints from other members of the crew, claiming that Phillip was involved with Sherlock and this Dr Watson fellow to hatch a clever hoax.
John looked at the tickets and noted the all the relevant information as Sherlock began to rummage through Mycroft's drawers. He also decided not to touch the diary, he really didn't want to know what someone like Mycroft thought about. Mycroft didn't have a filter and always said what was on his mind, and the thought of getting that on full blast was enough to leave the damn diary alone.
"Wow," Mycroft breathed. He thought that Mummy was bad, but maybe there were people that had it worse. "I'm sorry."
"Are- oh god," Mycroft put his head in his hands and then drew them down until the tips of his fingers pressed over his lips. He sighed deeply. "Are you leaving my brother, John?"
"Okay," John began, after they had finished dinner on the third night. They had settled in to the library to play chess. "I have to ask, how did you and Mrs Hudson become so close?"
Sarah was looking around at the perfect arrangement. She had almost every cheese imaginable. Well, all but the stinky ones. Her mum put her foot down at the Limburger.
John shook his head, trying to tramp down on his anger. "You could have said. I went out on a limb for you. I learned French for you. I've risked my father's wrath for you, and let me tell you, no can scream quite like an army drill sergeant." John took a deep breath. "Just because you are beautiful, that doesn't mean that you can just walk all over everyone and treat them like rubbish."
Sherlock leaned up against the door jam and said with a smirk, "I see you decided to go for something other than eau du rugby today."
When John walked into the office, he wasn't sure what to make of it. Sitting at the desk behind a placard stating her name was Mrs Hudson and a fancy, new laptop was an older woman with glasses, typing away and muttering something about members. And John really, really hoped she was talking about about a club and not what he thought it was.
"Here, in the library," John explained. "You said I could read anything I found on the shelves to my liking. This was most definitely to my liking."
John excused himself from a Molly that was being overly apologetic for Mary's behavior and said, "I'll be right back."
Sherlock shrugged. "It's simple chemistry, John. Once you understand that, it becomes very easy. That Alton fellow is quite clever."
fears or phobias they have needs to be punched in the teeth," John said calmly, crossing his free arm in front of his chest.
"Oh yes, they were both in on it," Sherlock replied, moving the white pawn forward. "So Mrs Hudson tried to go to the police, a solicitor, anyone at the company who would believe her, but they cleverly blocked her at every turn."
"Of course you can stay with us, Sherlock," Mycroft said, "I would feel so much better if you were someplace safe."
Greg smiled in satisfaction watching Sarah run around trying to prevent damage to the house. She grabbed a crystal vase that someone had been using as a spittoon and tried to break up a fight.
The note lay opened on the floor as they continued to kiss. The note that had brought them together in ways they never thought possible.
They took a step back, but took each other's hand and went to eat and chat with the other attendees.
"Of course he does," Greg cursed softly before putting the schedule back. Miss Hooper, the school secretary, almost caught him, twice, but Greg would ask her to get him something and she would wander off. Once he was actually in Mrs Hudson's office he completely tuned her out. He just needed to get out of here and find Mycroft.
The next morning, Sherlock woke up to the smell of grilled bacon and eggs. He followed his nose to the kitchen where John was making breakfast.
She squealed in delight at Sherlock's tux and Molly's dress. "Well don't the two of you make quite the pair."
Greg grabbed Mycroft's shoulders to steady him and to look at his eyes to see if they were dilated, "Because you might have a concussion."
a mad bastard, but there was something niggling at the back of his mind, saying that this was a bad idea.
John took a deep breath and walked out to where the podium was set up for him to read his first chapter.
Barbara looked as though she was going to kiss John right there on the rug. "That would really make things easier for everyone, if you could."
John lifted his head and their noses brushed. Their breath mingled together and all it would take was to move just a hair's breadth and they would be kissing.
"Well, hello, gorgeous," Greg murmured and then turned to look Mycroft up and down. "You aren't half bad, either."
John had written in a small leather-bound book all the little things that people had said about him and Sherlock being a couple over the years. From Jeanette's "My friends are so wrong about you. You're a great boyfriend. Sherlock Holmes is a very lucky man," to the Cross Keys inn owner asking if Sherlock was a snorer.
He handed it to Greg and then turned on his heel and walked off, leaving behind a stunned and completely poleaxed Greg, who looked at the £100 in his hand and shoved it in his pocket. Now to figure out how to ask a bloke out. He ran his fingers over his face and sighed. This was his literal worst nightmare. Despite how he looked, he had never gone out with anyone before. He just didn't have the time before...and now? Now he's about to ask the most difficult person in the whole school out on a date. He was in hell.
"I'm not interested," John was continuing. "Nor will I ever be." The doctor leaned in close. "I'm a wounded vet with an adrenaline addiction. My best friend is a consulting detective, my wife was a former assassin. I have friends in the army, the Met. I even know the government himself. If you as so much as whisper anything ill about Sherlock again, I'll make sure you disappear." She squeaked and removed her hand.
They got her a drink of water and a tissue. They shared a look and that's all it took. She wailed, "The ghosts aren't speaking to me!"
"Don't let it happen again," the creature said, standing up, giving John an even better look of the man's body. John's knees went weak at the sound of this man's voice. It was liquid sex and velvet...John nodded.
Thanks to my wonderful beta, old ping hai who makes sure this stuff is all pretty for you people. :D
"She said that we could do it for a lot of our clients because print houses were going away and we could rake it in."
Sherlock stood up. "You mentioned he had a gun shot wound in his head, can you describe the person you saw?"
He could feel the man's eyes on him, and he had a feeling that he had been found wanting. He had a couple of COs that could make him feel like that; this man didn't scream military, though.
Greg had relented and told him that he would find some juicy unsolved murders for him instead. That pleased Sherlock. Just then John had come down the stairs and Greg had turned around and invited John out for drinks.
John cleared his throat. "Right. That night produced a change in me. A shift. Subtle, but very crucial. I shifted my priorities from what I thought I wanted, a normal life, to what I truly needed, a lifetime of adventures next to Sherlock Holmes." John wiped a tear from his eye using the hand that held Sherlock's and then Sherlock kissed it away from their joined hands.
"That was for making my date bleed," Sherlock snarled and then hit him again in the nose. "That's for my brother." And then he kneed Bertie between his legs. "And
Greg thought about ignoring the other boy, but if school had taught him anything, it was that ignoring people like Bertie Gruner only made them more persistent.
Mycroft scoffed, "The only thing people 'know' about me is that I'm 'scary'." He used air quotes around know and scary. "My own mother wishes I was someone else."
He flinched as a teacher grabbed Greg's jacket, but he escaped by slipping out of it. Mycroft breathed out a sigh of relief. Strangely, he wanted to see how far this idiot would go before they caught him.
The true test of whether people actually liked the book or were just pretending to so they could suck up to Sherlock was what they felt about the two main characters kissing. And Sherlock (or Mycroft for that matter) had only met a handful of people who actually liked that scene.
But here we go, a new chapter to go with the new laptop. It was going to be longer but I thought it was better to end it where I did.
John walked through the door to their flat and smiled at the sight that greeted him. Sherlock was in his sleepwear and blue bathrobe, curled up on the sofa, sound asleep. John took off his coat and kicked off his shoes. He walked over to where his lover lay and knelt down, carding Sherlock's riotous curls.
John kissed his thigh and stood up. He undressed as quickly as he could and then crawled up the sofa between Sherlock's legs.
"The deal is off," John repeated. "Sherlock was never interested in me. He was chasing Bertie the whole time."
Mary rolled her eyes. "Of course I do, John. But as your girlfriend, I have to be there to support you."
"HarperCollins, Bloomsbury, Penguin Random, Scholastic, Hyperion...are they are sinking ships, too?" Sherlock asked derisively.
Sherlock nodded, he leaned back from John to press against the back of the sofa. He lifted his hand off John's back and then ran a hand over his own chest. "I have ever since- ever since that day."
"Nothing, sorry," Sally said trying to hide her smile. "It's just that a little tenth year kicked the shit out of a sixth former."
"Nonsense. If I can get the biggest second chance in the world, who's to say that it can't happen to you, too."
John tilted his ear up and then nodded. He could hear the pelting of the rain beating heavily on the roof and windows, but there wasn't a flash of light or even a low rumble.
Sherlock covered his ears and dropped to a crouch. It was followed by a couple more booms as lightning continued to flash.
Sherlock barely managed to stay standing as the bouquet went flying in a hail of petals. He put his arms around John and breathed a sigh of relief.
“Only for your own protection,” Greg muttered as he went searching through the messages. “So who is he then? This John fellow?”
"Yeah," John said. The helicopter landed and they got on. They were quiet for the entire trip home, lost in their thoughts.
"Effectively making sure you wouldn't ask until the relationship between you two had improved. How big of a fit did you pitch when you found out?" John asked with a knowing smile.
And then Sherlock got to a part of the story that made him pause. "I think we will save this one until the end." He turned to another page.
Sherlock walked back through the house, and across the hall he spotted John. And then John spotted Sherlock, and they stared at each for a moment before John walked away.
And whenever John felt like telling the other man to get off his arse and help, thunder would rock the house and Sherlock would whimper. John would sigh and go back to collecting "treasures" for them.
"So this is why you didn't want to marry me, isn't it?" John accused. "It's a lot harder to have a bit on the side when you're planning a wedding."
"You make the most amazing sounds," the rugby player whispered into the other man's stomach. John settled between the dancer's thighs.
Sherlock shook his head. "It put me in a bad place. So in my attempt to appear normal, I started doing drugs. To slow my brain to match those around me."
Ah. So that's what happened. "Of course, I do, Lockie," he murmured. "Is that how he discovered it, then?"
"My sister, Harry, reads the kind of books you publish, and I have no intention of writing that kind of story," John told her.
Sherlock blushed. "If I can get lost in doing something, reading, writing, beating you at Go Fish! It helps block out the thunder and I'm not so afraid."
"I have a very fine beauty regimen that I must follow. My skin is already in distress after using whatever it was that was in the bathroom."
Sherlock shrugged him off. "I didn't know that Langdale was still speaking with you. Remind me to send him a case of his least favorite beer."
Amy smiled. "I guess not. Just press the call button when you are ready to go, and I'll bring the release papers."
The remaining girl held up her hands, "I'm all thumbs, if I went anywhere near a needle I'd bleed all over the damned thing
John shook his head, "I'm too knackered. This case has been hell. And nothing against you lot, but no one worked as hard as Sherlock and I."
He had to find Mycroft before Bertie did, otherwise this night might go up in smoke. Or worse, completely set the place on fire.
Seriously, though. Greg's backstory was written and rewritten so many times that it makes my head spin just thinking about it.
"Is there anything else you do, you magnificent creature? You dance, you play violin, just tell me you have a singing voice like that of a frog choir..." John said, but trailed off when he saw the blush creep up Sherlock's ears. "God damn it!"
John listened intently and regaled him with stories of horrid customers and worse COs in between the stories Sherlock told. An anecdote here, a funny tale there. Apparently clients from hell were often similar to costumers from hell.
"But maybe if I hadn't been gay, I might have fallen in love her," Sherlock continued. "Maybe all this could have been avoided. Maybe I could have tried harder to understand my fans, to be more respectful of them, maybe she wouldn't have had to take such extremes to get my notice."
Okay, so he knew where that thought had come from. He was seriously attracted to the dancer. Even though Sherlock had been in a perfectly tailored suit, John couldn’t help but imagine him in tights and nothing else. It was a real problem.
Hello, and welcome to yet another chapter of this absolutely fun story. The chapters are coming along nicely and I'm moving at a steady pace. I don't want to tell you how I'm moving along so well, because I don't want to jinx it.
"Oh hell no," Greg said firmly. "You weren't there for the fallout the first time and if that happens again, I don't think he'd survive."
They sat cuddling for a moment. "I hope you don't mind, but I checked into your ghosts," Sherlock remarked casually.
"Not to bash the new place, Sherlock," he began, "but I've seen the other place a time or two dropping John off for the weekend, and this house doesn't even compare. What made you want to move here?"
"I didn't figure you wanted to explain to an entire room of strangers why your panic attack wasn't as out of the blue as you thought," Sherlock replied with a smile.
And then he found it. An honest to God fantasy novel. "Griffin's Steps" by William Scott. He read the back and it looked interesting. So he took it with him to one of the big fluffy armchairs and settled in for what looked to be a really good read.
Hands were grasping at clothes and moving them out the way to get that first touch of skin on skin. Shirts were dispatched with haste and Sherlock barreled John into the sofa. John gasped at the heated expression and then gasped again when Sherlock ground down.
Sherlock wanted to scream. He thought that he had successfully dealt with the printer, but apparently not. They had made yet
"Look, I'm all about evening the score with Mycroft," Greg said, standing up. "But there is no way in hell that I'm going to do it in front of you twats."
"Cheers!" John said, raising his fork to Sherlock. "Won't that mean less cases for you, though?" John added, with a frown.
That forced Greg to look up and the expression on John's face was thunderous. Greg huffed out an irritated sigh but followed John far enough away that Mycroft could not overhear.
Sherlock wasn't the only one in the sea of students who knew Mycroft who saw what went down. Mike and Anthea had been dancing nearby.
Sherlock laughed. "More inclined to insure we don't give his restaurant bad press than pleased to see us, I think."
Murray adjusted his morphine drip and John slipped into the arms of Morpheus, dreaming of three brothers playing soldiers in the warmth of the afternoon sun.
He blinked a moment or two and then shivered. When his brain came back online it said in Mycroft's voice,
Of course, his imagination might have not been so fanciful if he knew whether or not he was allowed to touch back. Well, okay. He touched back. But just the regular touches from before his disastrous birthday party. Oh, how he wanted to do more. It was going to drive him mad.
As they got into the car Mycroft asked, "Why aren't you being more..." he waved his hand trying to find the right word.
After a couple of hours they had cleared the SUV. Mycroft climbed into the driver's seat and tried to start the engine. It made no sound and refused to turn over. At first they thought it was the battery, but when Mike came back with his SUV and tried to jump it, still it refused to come to life.
"Good," the man, said walking up to John. "I don't need to stress the importance of this. I know your scholarship is riding on you passing the class, and you know that even your status as a rugby star would not be enough for the school to allow you to stay. You would end up having to quit medical school."
It took the publicist everything he had not to shudder in revulsion. "You should be grateful that I haven't pressed charges against you for harassment, Jim."
Mycroft shook his head, "I wasn't even there that day, I don't know how that one started to be honest. I blame Sherlock, honestly."
But just thinking about Sherlock made him feel frustrated. Not only had they never made it to lunch, John had missed a perfect opportunity in the summer, too. Sherlock had invited him to go sailing on his boat.
"You can write it down." He handed them to John. The doctor took them gingerly. "As much I tease you about your blog, John, there is never a doubt that your strength lies in prose. You articulate your feelings better when you write them down. Maybe it will work for what you want for Christmas."
"That's good. I'm glad Mycroft's friend recommended him," John murmured. Tobias Gregson had been chosen in particular for the interview for that reason. That he would respect Sherlock and not tear him down for a better story.
Brutus was lying on the ground like that's what he had meant to do all along, and there were two men standing next to the dog. One was holding the scarf Brutus stole, he was standing ramrod straight, one arm tucked behind his back. The other was dusting himself off, wearing a suit that probably cost more than she made in a month.
He did his make up and made sure to add the bright red lipstick that never failed to entice. He winked in the mirror before going to his first class. As he went about his day, he loved the lingering glances, the neck-breaking double takes, and the full on stares he got from all sexes. He couldn't wait to try it on John.
The warm glow in Sherlock's chest would brighten every time he would brush John's hand, or John's arm would wrap around his waist. They never strayed far from each other, always reaching out even if it was just a brush of fingers along the other's arm.
"I wouldn't do that to him," John urged. "You know how much I respect the guy's work. It's just…" he broke into a grin, "can you imagine the look on that sour grapes Sally when it comes out I'm the real deal?"
There were other things that seemed to change, in Sherlock's opinion, for the better. John would no longer run away when their arguments got heated, like he did before the Fall. It had hurt Sherlock when he had done that, and to see that John was trying to make concessions gave the taller man less desire to start arguments out of boredom.
He woke up the next morning to a text from John wishing him a good morning. A warm feeling washed over him. It was starting to get ridiculous how much this one person had turned his entire world on its head.
Once they had stopped, John sighed happily. "I have a turkey in the oven, you want to come over, have dinner together?"
"Yep," Greg agreed, popping the "P". "If Ajay or Rhys had been female or if they both were, it wouldn't have gotten the hate it did. If it was written today, it would be a best-seller."
John sneezed fitfully and nodded. "I know," he rasped, "but I don't have any more paid leave, and I can't afford to miss another day."
She put her hand back on John's arm and squeezed it in a way that Sherlock assumed she thought was reassuring.
Sherlock removed his clothes and John helped when Sherlock had trouble. Thankfully putting the clothes on was easier, and Sherlock didn't require John to assist. He turned the t-shirt on inside out and John cast him a questioning glance.
John took a steadying breath. "I have an answer for that, but I got the feeling that I'd be sanctioned for such talk."
John looked at the hand that held the drink for the toast and the other hand that held Sherlock's and sighed. "I don't have enough arms. But I will swat you for that later."
"John, it's not that and you know it. It's more that they are brilliant. Think about it, Mycroft must have invested the money for Sherlock and got it to that level. And if that's what happened, I bet it was a shock to Sherlock, too."
Sherlock opened his mouth the answer but John wasn't even looking at him. The doctor was looking out into the mangled, blackened remains.
Abernathy handcuffed their suspect and led him to the police car that Sherlock had been leaning against. She shoved him in and was about to slam the door when Sherlock stopped her with a quiet, "Wait."
just to understand what my female co-stars were feeling. I did to stand out. The competition is fierce for male dancers and I had to do something to get noticed. I'm damn sure that the only reason that I still dance after...," Sherlock shook his head, "is because of sheer nepotism. My brother is on the board for the Royal Arts Society and his husband is the director."
Mycroft was stuttering and trying to keep Prof Smallwood distracted when Greg made a noise opening the window. He needed to keep the Professor's eyes on him, so he did the only thing he could think of. He turned around and dropped his trousers, mooning his polo coach.
John ran his fingers through his hair. "Not really, I'm working all day at the bookshop and then coming home and editing until I fall asleep at my keyboard."
"Please!" Sherlock cried running up to John and grabbing his arm. "I don't know what I said or did wrong."
Sherlock's face took on a feral grin. "Actually, she isn't. She gave my table away to this man," he said, pointing to John.
He sat in the chair next to John's. "This place is better than the pictures she showed me. It really is a shame she's renting it out to anyone wanting to get out of the city. Could you imagine some yuppie couple in here, frowning at everything?"
felt like a single mother. Anyway, we moved here and she wanted to make sure I still got the best education, so all of her alimony goes toward keeping me at Bakers Academy."
Sherlock hung his head. "I can't bring Rosie back, and Mycroft's trying to find Mary. But he says that she will only be found when she wants to be."
"He's interested in you, Molly. He just thinks you won't be interested in him as he is neither a genius nor tall with dark, curly hair."
Sherlock waved him off in his head. His libido was for jumping John now. But that part of him that was still a romantic told his libido to shut up, too.
And these were just the major fires he had to put out, there were many minor flare-ups that he had to deal with on top of his own work. He hadn't had time to breathe, and sleep was a distant memory; these days he lived on caffeine and nicotine patches.
Mike held up his hands to show that they were empty. "Why would I want one of your stupid invitations?"
"I can only imagine," Sherlock said softly. "I'll talk to her and see if she can't hire more staff. Or at the very least start thinking about hiring your replacement."
"Not this time," Sherlock said, shaking his head. "No, it was my father. Everyone underestimates him, but he can be quite formidable. He flew down there and in three days found out where Victor was staying. He went and tore into Victor, gave him a proper dressing down. Victor called a couple days later to apologize and even offered to fly me down there to him."
"Not at all, every author does tours, it helps drum up interest in the book. Granted when you're first starting out, you'll only have small crowds." Sherlock tilted his head to the side, "If you can call two to seven people a crowd."
It always bothered me that Bianca and Cameron go from kissing in the car to her being pissed at him that he hadn't asked her to prom yet. But there were no scenes in between that indicated that they had even talked since the kiss, so I bridged the gap.
I think this is THE quickest turn around for a chapter that wasn't already typed out I have EVER done. Now, don't get use to this, how fast a chapter gets done depends on how long it is. It might take two days or a week depending. But because it is already written, it shouldn't take longer than a week. Fingers crossed.
"I had bad days," John informed him. They stared at each other for a moment and then they both broke down and laughed.
John stepped up between Sherlock and the bride assassin. "Hey, you leave him out this. He can't even see you. This is between you and me." He held up his hand, placating. "If you need to hurt someone, hurt me. I'm used to you lot trying to harm me. He isn't."
Also I totally cribbed from Vincent Starrett. I'm still not sure I like it. But I'm just going to have to live with it.
"Sherlock is around here somewhere, I'm sure he'll find you," Mycroft murmured. "In the meantime, why don't you go get yourself something to eat? You look dead on your feet."
The motorcycle roared to life beneath him and he rode off, kicking himself for well and truly fucking up his one chance with Mycroft. And just when he was starting to like him.
Just then Bertie roared up to the shop in his shiny new Jag, and parked directly behind Mycroft's old beater.
Something twisted in Sherlock's stomach and he turned to follow John, but the other teen had melted into the crowd and was gone.
Sherlock out and out laughed when he saw the "haunted house" that Brook was using as his headquarters. It was an old Edwardian house that had long ago been split into flats.
Not even when Sherlock was in the hospital had Mycroft looked this disheveled. His hair was in disarray as though he had run his fingers through it constantly. His jacket was nowhere to be seen, the waistcoat was unbuttoned and hanging off rounded shoulders. The tie was loosened and the top button undone. The shirt was rumpled, with the sleeves rolled up to his elbows.
Mycroft rolled his eyes, "Oh, for heaven's sake! Hemmingway was a drunk narcissist who squandered his life trying to get a leg up on Picasso's leavings."
"Can't you convince some wanker to take you out to the cinema for two seconds so that I can have a normal life?"
John shook his head fondly and just patted Sherlock's leg as he passed. He decided a nice walk around Regent's Park would be good for him. He walked to the bank of the lake and watched the swans. He kept his distance, though. He knew better than to get close. Swans were beautiful but real bastards.
"I talked to my mum and it took a lot of convincing from Mrs Hudson and Prof Smallwood, but when my mum heard 'free-ride' and 'choice of universities,' it was pretty much smooth sailing from there."
Also I have chapter seven done and will be getting that one edited soon. Hopefully in the next day or so. And eight is on the pipeline.
He looked around, happy that Sherlock had found a place so close to the Royal Opera House. During the two weeks Sherlock had been looking, John was on edge. Worried that Sherlock wouldn't be able to find something he liked that John could be close by for. But at this new place, the stadium was nearby and John could crash here after long practices.
Yay! Another chapter. I was gonna wait until Friday to edit this chapter because I got off work late today, but my beta Old Ping Hai convinced me that I could get it done tonight. So give her a big thanks for this chapter getting to you two days before I had planned.
But the more he thought about it, the less of a good idea that seemed. He would have to reveal his source and he didn't want to get Mike into trouble.
"Thank you," John murmured. He stroked Sherlock's back, soothing the tense muscles he felt there. Sherlock slowly began to relax now that the air had been cleared, and calm descended.
I told you I had the next chapter done. I thought about waiting a couple of days to post it, but...nah!
John gripped the sturdy metal rod like a cricket bat and inched toward the main hall. He had almost got to the door when a nearby window shattered, spraying the room with glass. John ducked and held the poker aloft, ready for anything.
"You see, I want to take out Sherlock Holmes, but there is the little problem of he can't date until his brother does," Bertie explained with a suave grin.
"Well, I happen to think you're worth it," John insisted. "So tell me what you've been up to. What does a fancy publicist do?"
"'To Sherlock Darling, yes I cut that scene. Because you were right as always, it was better without it.'" Sherlock quoted.
"You're right, I can't give you what you want," Sherlock croaked, his voice raw from the tears and emotion.
So...you'll notice there has been a slight increase in chapters. By one to be exact. And that is because after all the lovely comments I just HAD to put in Sherlock's take down of Jim. But it did kinda alter things a bit for the next chapter. But not a lot.
So the present that John was sure Sherlock couldn't give turned out the be the perfect gift for them both.
John looked at Mary and suddenly it all clicked. She had this look of glee on her face. Like she'd won. He had be taken in again. Mary didn't love him. She didn't love David or this poor bloke either. She just wanted to make men fight for her. She liked overt displays of masculinity.
"Can we hurry this along?" Sally snapped from behind Greg. "Some of us actually have plans for tonight and would like to still make them."
Sherlock frowned for a moment as he went through his mind palace. He sat up abruptly and clapped his hands together. "Oh!"
Mycroft led his horse out of the stable and out onto the polo pitch, where most of the team had already assembled. He mounted the horse and clicked his tongue to spur the animal into motion.
The next morning, John was practically vibrating with excitement all through Sherlock Darling's visit. The thinly veiled insults and snarky comments couldn't even dent John's good mood. And when the bell tinkled, heralding Sherlock's exit from the shop, he finally burst.
"I'm sorry, John. At least he'll be able to make to the wedding," Sherlock said, trying to console him.
John watched as Cathy got dressed. She appeared to be quite satisfied after the sex, but John only felt disappointment. It was middling at best, and he barely got off.
Marrow leaned back like he had been slapped. He clearly was waiting for John to reveal the secret of how he survived. John felt a cold chill settle between this shoulder blades. He knew that if he mentioned the stranger to Marrow, he'd be out of the army or worse, sanctioned.
"Oh god," John huffed, his breath coming in short pants. He lifted his arms and allowed Sherlock to remove his jumper. His hands dropped to Sherlock's shoulders, and he pushed the robe off those slender shoulders to puddle at his waist. Sherlock slipped his arms out of the robe and then began to attack the buttons on John's shirt.
"I love my job, well jobs, really," Sherlock sighed. "But this wasn't where I saw myself...at any time in my life, honestly. As a child, as a youth, as an adult. I stumbled on both because I'm a bastard. But this isn't what I really want to do."
"God no!" Greg said, holding up his hands in defense. "I was just doing a shit job of trying to make a joke."
Mycroft's head listed to the side and he brought it back up with a jerk. "You don't care if I don't ever wake up."
"Yeah, Clara found three empty bottles of Scotch, two half-empty bottles of rum, and a mostly full bottle of whiskey under their bed."
"You'll find a number of sharks in these waters, but if you have questions about anything, rely on Bill and Greg, oh and myself, of course. Any one of us will be able to steer you in the right direction. And if you want to get a second opinion, don't be afraid to," Sherlock murmured.
John frowned and then winced again. He smoothed out his face the best he could, but it was still pinched in pain. "Didn't– didn't Murray do that?"
"Ah, John," Sherlock said turning around. "Good, you're home. Go get changed. I have a lead on her purse and her murderer."
John had the most hopeful expression Mike had ever seen on another person. Right, that's why he was doing this, because against all odds John actually liked Sherlock. And there was of course the fact that John had befriended Mike after he had been kicked out of Future Doctors. Not that John knew him before then, but it was still a nice gesture.
The maitre d' looked over her list again. "Oh, here it is. I erased it because you weren't here at 7, so I gave it away."
So what have I been doing while typing up this wonderful story? Other little johnlock ideas, just fun little jaunts of writing exercises. And well...writing some Good Omens fics. But GO fics are my treat for writing Sherlock stories (not that they're a chore, they are just my main fandom and deserves my full attention even if GO has sparked interest for the moment). So I guess what I'm say is we'll see what the future holds.
Greg looked up at the balcony and his heart skipped a beat. Leaning on the rail looking roguishly handsome was Mycroft Holmes.
John dropped the poker and leapt for the door, pulling it open before Mike could holler for him to wait. The wind threw the door open wide and four bundled figures fell through, the one in the back falling on top of the other three.
John looked up from the hob, where he was cooking dinner and smiled. "Hey, beautiful. How was the interview?"
"He couldn't have," Mrs Hudson said. "You two were still together when it happened. That sounds more like something he would have done
John drew up himself up to his full height and said, "I am a doctor and a surgeon, I fought in Afghanistan, I have taken down men bigger than you, and I can break every bone in your body whilst naming them. I am Dr John Watson-Holmes and you are hitting on my
"Yeah?" John asked. "It means a lot to me to hear that from you. I worried the most about former and current military personnel being upset by it."
Pulling the curtain all the way through to hide himself, he asked from the tub through the thin barrier towards Sherlock.
"Sher-Sherlock, please, ah fuck, I want to fuck you," that certainly earned him a pause from the lustful detective as he removed John from his mouth.
"I can't promise the yet to be outcome, but I can promise you I didn't lie about anything," Mycroft reassured, followed by John nodding at the statement with an unsure expression. No one had more inquiries further than the clarification about Sherlock's whereabout during the two years, so Mycroft had devised a plan regarding the visits with Sherlock. One of the most reasonable entrance into Sherlock's cell was to serve the food for breakfast, lunch and dinner (probably tea and supper every now and then) because it wont come too much as a shock for Sherlock if someone entered with a reason that wont make him feel oppressed. John offered to go in first for lunch and Lestrade for dinner, just in case bringing too many faces in would result badly and because he seemed to remember John the most, even if it's just by the name or hazy memories.
“Where were you during my pain and pleasure? You deem me as the machine, how would you know when to come in, right? Just like my two years of continuous captive-release, it wasn’t just some playful hide-and-seek, John! It was, frankly speaking ; TORTURE! And coming back to such a bloody welcoming from the only person you were eager to meet after two years, how would you deduce I felt? Huh, Mycroft was right, maybe I SHOULDN’T care to come back!”
to tell us, considering you just abducted us from wherever we were". That earned him a silent pause as Mycroft reconsidered his words.
John stepped back a few steps and stayed silent for a few seconds before managing to mutter out words of truth, "
John just doesn’t seem to consider his supposedly nonexistent feelings and kept talking… and making him feel more guilty with every breath. John just doesn’t understand that he’s not the only one emotionally (or even physically) tired. He just… screamed with so much hatred, it would’ve sent so much vibrations in Sherlock’s heart it might shatter.
Mycroft only looked unimpressed by this revelation, but also looked sad in a split second because Sherlock truly believed that no one cared about him. Back to his cold persona again, he finally spoke.
When Sherlock regained his full focus again from the orgasm, he leaned forward, with John still inside him, and gave a passionate kiss to John, which John happily kissed back with the same eagerness in it.
John however still calmed her down, saying how Sherlock was always unpredictable his whole life. And he will continuously be unpredictable, sending cryptic messages every now and then. And maybe come back to life like he did a week ago. John felt like he wasn't privileged enough to kind of shed a tear or feel sad, because in a way, he played a part in scaring Sherlock away from the comfort of 221B. But the least he can do was make it up to him by leaving open arms for him if he were to come back again. Resurrect in any given time. And hopefully this time, he wont get a punch in the face. They both knew Sherlock couldn't walk away just like that. He just needs time for himself and they respect the decision. And they respect it by not being stuck in their emotions, and to talk about the brighter memories together, hoping they'd have the opportunity for more of that again in the future.
The gaze from Sherlock was truly drilling and unsettling but he kept his focus on the bloodied hand in his.
That was as far as it was for Azalea flower, unfortunately. But it started to get clear in his mind. He eventually found more explanations further in the leather bound notebook about colours. And above all the explanations, he emphasized about how if the colour is familiar to the flower, it could just mean it's coincidentally paired or it meant that the message one is sending through the flower should be commonly recognized, as if it had existed for a long while. John sighed before he proceeded reading the texts, trying to make sense of everything.
Tears. There were tears. He wasn't sure if that was his own that was flowing down his face, or Greg's that was falling onto the consultant's face. He was confused about that part but somehow for the other part of the tragic story unraveling in the room, not so much. Suddenly, he was more than happy he took too much, Life was painful. He was just freeing himself.
“Probably a bit too cliched. Although this isn’t much of my expertise, but yet I know quite well that JohnWatson, I am truly in love with you,” John stayed static.
"Of course it is difficult for me to understand, especially after he proved to me that none of you cared but now you all said you do! How many times do you want to reset my brain just so you can manipulate it again?!" he was now clenching his fist on his sides, repressing any shouts.
"I didn't lie the first time. I'm not a malingerer, for fucks sake, John," he rolled his eyes but that stupid movement only made his headache worse.
Sherlock had made many possibilities all planned out in perfect plots in his head about what John was about to tell him, but he hadn’t anticipated this particular tension in the air, and a confession hanging in between them.
“John, I really can’t… I shouldn’t let you under my skin again, because it hurts to love someone who doesn’t seem to appreciate what you did and see you as someone so
"Sherlock told me to give you this. He gave one to me too," she didn't mention about hers being more full of flowers, though. Might break something inside him if she did. The flowers exchanged hands and John just gloomily looked at the flowers, feeling it being heavy when in reality it wasn't. It was the weight of guilt and separation that add up to his hand feeling heavy from the flowers.
“Wh- Sherlock what did you say? I’ve known you long enough to know something happened, so prepare the damn tea, sit down and tell me what’s wrong,”
"... However you prefer?" both of them were showing a tint of pink on their cheeks by now. That was weird, to be having an offer to go out after he cancelled out on the previous date, to go on one with his own flatmate.
"Okay, good. That's it? I'm sure that's just it. Bye bye" he blurted out and his desperation to end the conversation just peeking through every crack of his breaking facade. Oh dear, the sight of him was saddening. He was desperately holding himself together, it's a matter of time before he broke down on the ground without no one else to glue him back together.
He sigh because he just didn't know what else to do but pretend the conversation never happened, and it's as if John though the same because he wasn't running after his girl even after almost a quarter of an hour Sherlock was with Rosie. A few moments had passed and Rosie was sound asleep again. The air was also lighter, so perhaps it's appropriate to come back out to the kitchen/living room area again and confront John.
Usually when he sees Sherlock’s Belstaff flowing gracefully behind the slim figure, he’d be happy, ecstatic and filled with adrenaline. But that day, John was as frantic as ever as he saw the figure ducked under the yellow police tape, hands in his coat pockets and moving towards the nearby park. It was definitely hard to catch up with Sherlock’s long strides but when he eventually managed to approach Sherlock, they were under a shady tree and it was nearing sunset hour. Before he could say anything, he saw Sherlock igniting a cigarette and blowing long puff of smoke in one long breath.
"Thank you, John. For loving me for who I am," he kissed John's forehead softly and full of gentle love. "And for making me realize that life was worth living," John was smiling at this, moreover when he saw that Sherlock's eyes was glassy.
Sherlock looked up from his experiment that he had delayed because of Rosie, gave John a questioning hum and waits for an anser.
"Just go to the room at the back. There's spare clothes there and I'll make some tea to warm you up," John said and walked away to the kitchen. From a distance, he could hear Rosie playing with her toys, evident from the sound of squeaks and rattles. He wanted to check on her, just to say hello, but he was sure if he did just so, he'd be kicked out in a split second.
as claimed by Moriarty. He also had a magpie brooch with him, but now he's not sure anymore if the items were sentimental or pure manipulation by affection by now.
," he looked away when he finished reminiscing the memories together before he fell to his so-called death. "You're Sherlock Holmes, the infamous consulting detective."
The day after, just before Sherlock left the premise, he had given a bouquet of light pink azalea flowers with a white in the centre, just beautifully merging colours, to Mrs. Hudson. 'A goodbye gift', he said. And she tearfully accepted it, and said she insisted a hug and a kiss on the cheek before he leave. How can he say no? He let that happen with the same reassuring smile that he used the day before when saying he was sure he wanted to go on with his life as an agent. Mycroft offered him the spot way back when he was in his twenties. He's now just revisiting old forts. Nothing new. No biggie.
He gave Mrs. Hudson a small smile and a soft pat on her frail arm before making his way upstairs, two steps at a time. The very second his knuckle had hit the door of the living room, he heard a loud thud. Surely that wasn't his knock, right? He barely put an effort in the knock and it shouldn't have made such a loud sound. Now he was panicking. Mrs. Hudson knew that something was wrong, and she had the right to think so.
If he'd let Sherlock just run away now, he wouldn't know when else he'd see the man. He wouldn't know when else he could make it up to him anymore. If he'd run out to find Sherlock now, Rosie would be left unattended, so he tried ringing his phone but it was unsurprisingly a fruitless attempt. He ran to the door, in hope to at least see a silhouette of Sherlock. His dark hair and clothes had made it easier to spot him in the white of snow.
"Sherlock," he said, fighting back tears. "I pledge to understand that there are times when you need to be alone in your mind palace and to not take it personally when you do. I pledge to be by your side through every danger, whether it is the criminal class or the daily pitfalls of daily life.
Sherlock pulled his coat tighter around himself to prevent any further comments on his state. He watched the rest of the match trying to think of everything and anything to make it more bearable, but by the end he was very much in the same condition. He hoped that he could duck out before John caught him so that he didn't have to see the blond like this.
Everyone seemed oblivious to Sherlock's inner turmoil, everyone but James it seemed. He stepped forward.
John nodded and watched as she dashed out the door. He flopped back on the bed and cursed. He actually felt relieved that he wasn’t going to be seeing her until the weekend. He could stop playing the good boyfriend.
"Why are you so bleeding tall?" John shot back with a grin. He put down the spoon he had been using to make the beans and brought Sherlock in close for a kiss. "I still think you should have worn the robe, that way I could see those incredible legs of yours."
When the classroom door slammed shut, Greg coughed and discreetly wiped away his tears. He didn't even hear Mr Lyons call for their poems. He was struck by the raw emotion and that Mycroft had dared everything just so that he could hear it.
He held out both hands and turned his head away. "I can't believe you would do this to me, wasn't I good enough for you?"
"I was in a tree when a pretty big storm hit," Sherlock said, looking down at his shoes. "I was supposed to be inside taking a nap, but I thought I saw a squirrel with something shiny and I wanted to see what it was." Sherlock closed his eyes.
The officer simpered. "Oh, come on," she implored. "I'd make it worth your while." She put her hand on his arm.
Like him coming home early, apparently. It wasn't so early that he and Greg never made it out for drinks, but far too early to have been the night out that they planned.
She was introduced to the owner, Mike, and a feeling of unease settled over her like an ill-fitting garment.
If Sherlock had seemed upset before, it was nothing compared to how stricken the man looked now. His already pale skin looked ashen and his hands shook.
John and Sherlock mumbled what drinks they wanted and the chef nodded. "I will make sure it gets out to you straightaway."
John grabbed the band of the underwear and pulled them completely off, Sherlock bucking his hips to aid in the process. Once the pants were gone, John buried his face into Sherlock's crotch.
It's another "long" chapter which I hope will make up for it being so long since I posted. But I do have the last chapter written, it just needs to be typed up and sent to the ever amazing Old Ping Hai. So with any luck, it should be really soon.
I haven't started typing up my other story yet because I found out that I have cubital tunnel syndrome. Which is like carpal tunnel syndrome but instead of it being in the wrist, it comes from the elbow. So my left hand is super weak, and even typing this up aches, so... yeah. It's going to be place on hold until I get better. Which sucks.
"Of course," he said, taking back his phone. "After all, producers are a dime a dozen, but there is only one Sherlock Holmes."
notes on the scene, it must have been the one we discussed. And like with everything I've said, you have completely ignored my advice on the matter."
He opened the door and stood there staring. Apparently Sherlock wasn't the only who had gone out of his way to dress to impress. John had showered and applied a little product, making his blond hair sweep back from his face. He was wearing tight jeans and a t-shirt that was straining to keep John's compact chest under wraps. It was failing.
He looked out at the falling snow and sighed. He really didn't want to go without it, it's what made Christmas dinner for him. His mum's recipe was divine.
"Your head still hurting you I see," Murray said as he began the routine of checking the machines, changing the saline bag, and making notations on the chart.
The director, Greg Lestrade, came storming into the practice room and skidded to a stop. He had thought that the other dancers were having him on, but there was Sherlock with a grin on his face and his phone in his hand as he replied to someone. Someone who apparently made the dour dancer light up.
Sherlock snorted. "No. I didn't want to listen to Mycroft drone on and on about how careless I was, so I pretended to fall asleep."
To take his mind off the feeling, John asked with a wink, "So, what can you tell me about this place that wouldn't be cheating?"
"Fuck," John groaned, struggling to sit up. Sherlock grabbed his arm and helped him into an upright position.
Victor and Sherlock both protested. Dale dragged Victor to his feet and pressed the tall dancer into the footballer's even longer side.
I also didn't have the time as my husband went out town for Dragon-Con and because I couldn't get all the time off I needed to go with him, guess who stayed home and watched the two year-old? You guess right again, me! So, deepest and sincerest apologies and I hope the massive amounts of fluff in this chapter make up for it.
Bertie shoved his hands into his trouser pockets and rocked back on his heels. "Mycroft is a twat and I'm willing to pay you to date him."
Returning almost three hours later, he made a few trips to take all his bags and packages up to the flat, even with the help of the driver.
John turned from his task and tossed the empty roll into a nearby garbage bin. He pulled out his phone with a sigh.
John got up to take a look at the plaque. Sure enough, it read "Sherlock Holmes, gold medalist, 2012."
Sherlock took the dossier from Mike and flipped through it. "She's not hearing ghosts, she's just a very empathetic person and uses ghosts to explain why she can guess what a person is feeling. Dull." Sherlock tossed it on the seat between him and Mike. "Next?"
"So why not rewrite it now that you're an adult, make it better by your sheer experience, not only going through the constant hell of people hating your book, but by your experience in the publishing industry."
Mycroft closed his eyes pained and let them pass, but at the last second, he reached out for Sherlock's hand. "Wait, Sherlock! I have something I want to tell you."
Sherlock looked over at the rugby captain and then back to John. He felt like a bucket of cold water had been dumped over his head. The expression on James's face was one of undisguised yearning. Here was someone who loved John. And John had promised him that they could ride together? Sherlock didn't know what to do.
"And you haven't managed to frighten him off with your charming attitude, your penchant for vocalizing your deductions, or that horrid taste in clothing you call style?" Mycroft sneered.
PS: If anyone can tell me how align Mike's tombstone to the middle of the paragraph, instead of the left side, I'd love you forever.
Bertie Gruner was taller than average, with classic good looks and an arrogance matched only by his self-absorption. He and his best friend, Jim Moriarty, watched as the new sophomores walked by.
Lithe as a cat, Sherlock surged up to pin John underneath him. "You aren't getting away with having me naked and you not."
Mike shook his head. "Not at all, Miss Hooper." He pulled out a chair and Molly sank into it heavily. She clutched her cup of water and braced her elbows on her knees.
John blinked. "So, what; did you borrow money from Mycroft until the paid consultant thing comes through?"
John laughed. He supposed he did; lack of sleep and no breaks at work today had completely done him in.
But John leaned into his space again and soon they were pushing and roughhousing with each other right there on the pavement.
John looked up at him and then over at the display. The books were ordered from oldest to newest, left to right. "What's wrong with it?"
"And what is everyone's preoccupation with prom, anyway? I don't want to go, why is that so hard for people to understand?"
Greg knew it was time to take a different tactic. "Right, so say I take him to the cinema. He seems like a cinema kind of guy, right?" He clapped Bertie on the shoulder, "That's £30 off the bat, then he'll want a coke and Maltsers, that's another £30. And then dinner to talk about how horrible the show was, which will be at
John watched as Sherlock stared at the floor, completely torn. John wanted to tell him to go. To find this bastard. John would keep.
John stepped back far enough to see Sherlock's face, but not far enough to break Sherlock's hold on him. "You think I'm good looking?"
After security sorted everything out, Seb had been hauled away while the Manchester owners looked on in worry. John and Sherlock were nestled on one of the sofas nursing their drinks.
"The worst of the worst, I'm afraid," Mycroft agreed. "He is a snake and no longer any of your concern. You focus on wooing that soldier of yours."
John blinked. It was a fair question he supposed. In addition to the professors hating him, there were other rumors about this boy. The drugs, the parties, and the one-night stands. By all rights, John should have jumped Sherlock and then walked away. But there was something about this boy that left him wanting more, and he suspected he was looking at the reason right then.
Sherlock ducked his head. "That case Lestrade wanted me to look at ended up taking nearly three weeks to solve and I figured by that point you'd be too upset to speak with me." He looked up through his lashes. "I thought you were going to start in on me in the store earlier tonight."
