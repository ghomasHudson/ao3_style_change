"You mean like the one from Lord of The Rings?" Molly questions, that being the only Golem she knows of.
Everyone laughs at Sherlock wanting to be a pirate. “I can’t not imagine Sherlock on a boat,” Anderson can’t help but comment through his laughter.
"Am I imagining things, or does Sherlock look a little anxious to you?" Donovan questions in shock, at seeing the 'Freak' show any emotion expect for confidance.
“I would not have expected her to say that,” Donovan commented in shock. John winced, remembering that fight.
The Yarders all sigh at Sherlock’s actions, shaking their heads but not even a bit surprised at him.
“What?” Donovan questioned curiously, her eyebrows furrowed together in confusion. While John and Molly both glare at her.
He had never said that aloud, never told anyone about the feelings he had been trying so hard to squash. Arms wrapped around him, and it took longer than he would like to realise that they belonged to Mrs Hudson and Molly.
A few people roll their eyes at Fletcher putting on a mask, proving to them that this was just a hoax.
"John!" Lestrade hissed, shaking his head at the male. "Never go off on your own, that's like horror movie 101,"
John and those who believe that Sherlock is innocent winces, because in the end that's kind of what he did didn't he?
“Holly shit,” Anderson speaks up in shock. “When the hell did she get there?” He added, and no one responded, everyone but Moriarty and Mycroft still shocked that she was there.
“Despite seeing Sherlock figure it out, I still have no idea what exactly he figured out,” Molly admitted.
"Did it ever cross your mind that John didn't want to accept the deal, because his an army doctor and has morals?" Anderson asked and Mycroft glares over at him.
"What happened to not taking dating advice from Sherlock?" Lestrade teased, struggling not to laugh.
"Besides, why would Sherlock even waste time doing all that, it's not like he ever actually needed John," Anderson adds before wincing slightly, "that came out wrong," He muttered.
Everyone, even Mycroft jumped at the howl. Their eyes frown, because the hound wasn't supposed to be actually real.
"All of this worry is gonna be the death of me," Mrs Hudson huffed, absentmindedly clutching at her chest. Lestrade hummed in agreement.
"Seriously? That's what he cares about? Skulls? Not his own life?" Anderson asks like it's ludercris and maybe for normal people it is but he doesn't seem to understand that this is Sherlock.
"Do you think the museum would actually let him back in, espically at night?" Molly asks, causing John to frown in thought before shrugging not really having an answer her.
“Why can’t we see what this hound looks like?” Kitty questioned, started to get even more frustrated, while trying to push down her own fear.
Their glares intensified at Irene’s words, while luckily, or unlucky depending on how you see it, no one noticed the smirk on Moriarty’s lips.
"Did anyone else notice the fact that Sherlock didn't say his bedroom, but the bedroom?" Anderson comments causing John to blush slightly.
“Oh that was actually a good idea,” Anderson mused, after a few seconds of having to remember where he got the invoice from.
After Molly sat down everyone else grabbed something thing to eat. Once everyone had seated back down, Lestrade finally seemed to realise something.
“Let me guess, it’s the second one,” Anderson muttered, with a lot less contempt in his voice than before.
"Couldn't you guys use another hand?" Lestrade asks, ignoring Donovan, John hums slightly and shrugs but doesn't bother actually answering it.
Once again everyone starts laughing. Even John laughed, though his was more awkward then actual laughter.
"You stopped doing that," Lestrade mutters, causing John to raise an eyebrow at him. "You stopped saying praises about what Sherlock does," He elebrated and John shrugged, not knowing what to say.
"What do expect, the freak to actually tell the truth," Donovan snarled, being her usual grumpy self.
"Wait, does she think-?" Anderson trails of as he notices the look on John's face, after a few seconds of silence, everyone but Mycroft bursts out laughing, they just couldn't help it. None of them notice the screen pausing as until they had managed to finish laughing, or at least get their laughter under control.
John flushes in embarrassment as a few people raise their eyebrows at him. Though no one can really be all that surprised that John flirted with the random girl. Especially after watching this.
“Um,” Anderson muttered as everyone stared at the screen in shock. Surprised that Irene was completely naked.
“It means duck out of the line of fire, it was used in the second World War,” John explains quietly.
“Is she really dead?” Anderson questioned, only being slightly suspicious because of Mycroft’s previous words.
Any and all of their grins disappear as they see the woman, their humor at John fading into sadness and guilt. John and the police officers suddenly wishing that they could go back into time and solve them earlier so the hostages didn't have to suffer.
"Wasn't that obvious?" Anderson mutters and John nods slightly, embarrassed that he had asked such an obvious question.
Mycroft winces, feeling annoyed that the one time Sherlock decides to fall for a girl, it’s such a bad one.
"Did you really think that he was a delivery guy? He has no food with him," Lestrade asked, amusement dancing in his eyes.
"Wait, what the fuck is that?" Almost everyone screeched as they stare at the white words that had appeared. Though no one bothers to even try and answer the questions, to shocked to speak as they stared at the screen. After a couple of seconds, of everyone in shocked silence, the screen turns black and words appear.
"Why did he swipe the beer?" Donovan questioned in confusion. Before coming to the realisation when he moves towards Fletcher.
"The best and worst part about the code," Lestrade sighs as he speaks, shaking his head in despair. "But at least now we know about it,"
"I don't get it" Lestrade muttered. He, Anderson and Donovan were sitting in his office, every file for the cases Sherlock had helped with splayed out on the desk between them. "Why would he kill himself, it just isn't him."
A couple people chuckling at Sherlock being so confused. Sometimes they could forget that some simple interactions slipped Sherlock’s mind.
"Because I wanted to be slightly discreet when asking my brother why he broke into a top secret government facility," Mycroft retorted dryly.
Said person, the one who ratted out his brother, not Sherlock, obviously, stepped out of the car. "I am sorry John," Mycroft Holmes said, grief filling his voice, well just as much grief filled his voice as a robots'. John glared and Mrs Hudson just sighed. Nobody spoke for a while before Mycroft's wall cracked and a single tear ran down his face. "He was my brother John," He whispered which caused John's own walls to break.
For those who actually liked Sherlock, they all frowned, worried for the genius as he gets more and more panicked.
"Repulsing," Kitty can't help but mutter under her breath, though no one hears her. Which is lucky, because if they did, they probably would have tried to kill her.
Anderson, Molly, Donovan and Kitty couldn't help but blink, both of them wondering how someone as emotionally stunted as Sherlock could fake cry.
"Mycroft literally introduced himself as Sherlock's greatest enemy, and you're just now realizing it?" Anderson questioned, John flushed slightly.
"But that's why it's so clever, it would be harder for a local to figure it out," Lestrade also pointed out.
Everyone frowned in confusion at Frankland helping them. Between Frankland popping up, and helping them despite obviously not being Mycroft, was very suspicious.
“Who is she working for?” Molly questioned cautiously, though from the way this case was unfolding she figured she had a good idea.
"The wrong kind," John replied, though his words were harsh his tone was soft, a slight smile curving his lips.
A few people smile at Sherlock rolling his eyes, relaxing slightly as they come to the conclusion that they would be alright.
Everyone collectively breathed a sigh of relief, glad that it was just a normal dog and not an actual hound. Not that many of them doubted Sherlock, it was just hard to be sure with so much happening.
"I'm not sure," John admitted, frowning ever so slightly. Trying to figure out if it would have helped or hindered Frankland more or less if he had let them get captured.
"And who are you deary?" Mrs Hudson asks, okay so Mrs Hudson could think of something else. Mrs Hudson's questions causing a couple of people to mentally slap themselves for being so stupid.
Lestrade sighs at Sherlock’s words, remembering that Christmas and hating that Sherlock always had to be right.
"Really, Sherlock?" Molly asked, amusement filling her tone. The original ones, (everyone but Moriarty and Kitty) all chuckled slightly, and in Mycroft's case, that meant his lips lifting in an amused smirk.
"GO SARAH!!!" Donvoan, Molly and Mrs. Hudson all yelled happily at the screen, Molly jumping up  as she shouts. Everyone chuckles, some quieter then the others.
"Oh, hey I'm about to be in it!" Anderson says trying to get rid of the embarrassment, or at lest make sure no one knows about it.
“I’m still curious as to why that matters,” Anderson mutters under his breath as he watches Sherlock curiously.
Fear and worry shot everyone at the sigh of the door being jemmied open. They had no idea what was happening, but whatever it is, there was no way it could be good.
“What has he figured out?” Kitty questioned, finally speaking up. No one answered, as only one person even had an inkling of an idea as to why.
"Did you really not realise that they hadn't followed," Kitty questioned in shock. John glared at her.
"Yes because the state of his suit is more important then your life," Lestrade commented dryly and John chuckled slightly.
"You know for a split second, I think Sherlock actually thought you were smart John," Lestrade jokes slightly, John huffs slightly.
"Wouldn't it have been easier to look for a book that they would both have and go from there, removing all the books that no one would have?" Mycroft asked, finally speaking without the usual arrogance.
"Why would Sherlock say something like that?" Lestrade asks causing the two other Yarders to go red, causing the Detective Inspector to frown.
Worry filled the room, no one knew exactly how much time had passed, which just increased their worry even more.
"Why else would he be happy unless that was actually him?" Kitty points out, trying to prove to everyone that she was right.
Everyone blinks in shock, confused as to why Bluebell had suddenly been brought up again. Especially seeing as a few had to remember who Bluebell was.
Now everyone chuckled in amusement at Sherlock's comment. A few wondered if Sherlock had finally gone mad.
"Holy shit," Donovan commented, her, well everyones, eyes are wide in shock as they stare at the screen.
Everyone hisses slightly at the sight of the laser at Sherlock, their eyes narrowing at Moriarty's next words.
"Sally, if you insist on believing that my brother is a fraud, that maybe you should try and deduces John here," Mycroft announces, rather suddenly causing the black figure in the corner to shift slightly. Sally or Donovan glares at Mycroft but still she and the other Yarders lean forward.
Everyone frowns in confusion as they stared at the screen, everyone's mind whirling to try and figure out who these new people are.
"If he was real, wouldn't Moraity be Sherlock's arch-enemy?" Donovan immediantly groans at Lestrade's words.
"That's how you met Mycroft Holmes? That's so... dramatic!" Anderson asks and John shrugs as Mycrofts eyes narrow ever so slightly at him.
A few people blink in shock, but most, like the Yarders weren’t all that surprised at Sherlock’s announcement.
Everyone frowns as Irene tranquilers Sherlock, while John sighs guilty, wishing he hadn't left Sherlock alone with her.
"Your a freak as well!" Donovan screeches, pointing her look of disgust at John who in turns just rolls his eyes.
Everyone snorts, and the few people who hadn’t realised that the phone was different, relaxed. Having been confused that Sherlock had actually just handed it over.
"We were never together!" John hisses, and that definitely wasn't a tinge of bitterness in John's voice. Nope totally not.
“Mycroft,” Mrs Hudson chided, “you shouldn’t be annoyed at your little brother calling for christmas,”
“When did she have time to get dressed?” Molly questioned in shock. After all, they hadn’t been talking that long, and Irene had been at Sherlock’s house.
"If it wan't clear before, it is now, the dudes crazy," Anderson comments causing a few people to chuckle.
"What is he talking about?” Molly questioned turning to look at Lestrade. Having forgotten that other things could happen during this case.
"So that's what you were reading, I knew it was too long to just be 'wrong' but I couldn't see," Donovan muttered and Lestrade just shrugs.
A few people huffed at John going into the room without bothering to read the sign. Mrs Hudson hitting him over the back of the head for being an idiot.
Everyone laughs at John. "And you wonder why everyone thinks your together," Lestrade can't help but tease. John sinks down in his chair, blushing slightly while Molly frowns.
"No wonder he is so agitated," Anderson mused, a few humming in agreement and sympathy. Though those who actually liked Sherlock, smiled proudly.
Everyone winces, at the sight of the security breach alert. Even more worrying filling them as they are now actually caught.
"JOHN! couldn't you have been just a bit more consderate, he is being strangled!" Mrs Hudson scolded, lightly smaking the back of the doctors head. John sheepishly smiles back at them.
"Did he really not notice, the freak was right outside!" Donovan snarled. John, Mycroft and Mrs. Hudson all glare at the girl but they don't have any comebacks at they were wondering the same thing.
"You're getting really good at that," Molly comments happily. John flushes slightly and grins back at her, feeling proud of himself.
Everyone flinched as Sherlock suddenly yelled. More at the sudden loud noise than Sherlock actually yelling.
"I am serious." Sherlock said and rolled his eyes, "And you're more than my boyfriend of less than a month. You're the one I want to marry and spend the rest of preferably both our lives with.. I love you and it's just money." he said with a shrug, "You're way more important to me than my bank account."
"Mmh, they're awesome." Charlie nodded with a smirk. "I can show you a video later on, if you want to." She said and shifted a little on her bed to look at Rosie more easily. "Now, Speedy, do you already have a plan for our secret mission into Mrs. Hope's office?"
"Yeah, I think I know what you mean.." John said shifted in his chair to be able to look at Sherlock. "By the way, didn't your mum want to talk to my dad today?"
Sherlock smiled, "Be right back." he said and looked up the house, smiling as he spotted Rosie at a window, waving at him. Waving back, he walked to the front door and knocked.
"Right... He's teaching PE just about now in our gymnasium and should be done in fifteen minutes too. That's through the garden and behind our chemistry labs. You might want to ask someone to show you the way." John nodded at that and rose to his feet as well. "I'll gladly talk to him then. Thank you for your time, Mrs. Hope." She smiled back at the two of them. "Of course, Mr. Watson. I'll schedule an appointment on the formalities tomorrow for 10 am. Goodbye."
"Oh- that's good." John gave Sherlock's hand a squeeze and let out a slow breath, understanding fully well Sherlock's subtext. "Here let's help you with that. My parents have come especially to see you, so we should make the most of their visit." He told her with a smile, trying to calm his pulse, before picking her up so she could reach her bees. "And... there she flies."
"I suppose, given then time that was actually wild." John said with a chuckle and wrapped an arm around his waist. "Think dancing for one song would embarrass her too much?" He asked and looked over to their daughter who was looking as if she'd drunk a love-potion in a comic. "She doesn't look as if she's noticing too much anyway"
"Oh yeah, I got to drive a tank this morning. That was pretty brilliant." John said with a chuckle and gave Sherlock a bit of a smirk. "Hold on, you what?" Scott asked him immediately. "Yeah, Sherlock borrowed a tank from a veteran this morning. He sort of promised that the morning after he told me about vampirism."
"I guess I'm just the only treating him like a perfectly healthy adult. Maybe that scored me some points with him. Obviously I keep avoiding to talk about the V word." William said and sat up again, feeling slightly nauseous from the lack of blood, but he was pretty sure he wouldn't throw up.
John nodded at that and began to walk up the stairs. "Jesus, when she held your wine glass in her hands and had blood dripping from the corners of her mouth... I thought I was about to either die or murder something there for a second." He admitted with a shake of head.
"Yeah, we really wouldn't mind." Charlie got herself to say, wondering if Rosie and John were in on this, because they were doing Charlie an enormous favour right now. Lowell would sit right next to her, so maybe she'd be able to touch his arm, or leg, or act as if she was falling asleep on his shoulder... Maybe, if a blizard would start right now, he'd be trapped with them, right here, in the living room, she thought, wondering if she'd be able to sleep right next to him... "No, we wouldn't, but we also don't want to keep you here if you have somewhere else to be." Shut up, John!!!
"I thought maybe you were on the loo!" Rosie said and smiled as Mrs Hudson lifted her off the table, "I forgot sometimes when I'm on the loo at night and go back to bed, once I left my plush bee on the cupboard next to the sink and only when I found it there I knew I was on the loo."
"Oh, there you are. You did a very good job waiting for it to cool." John said, cursing himself for letting a four-year old unattended in front of an open fire with marshmallows... After feeling her marshmallow for her, he said. "Yeah, you can eat it now. And that's Sherlock's friend I was talking about, we're saying hi to him right now. Rosie, this is Lowell. Lowell, this is our younger foster daughter Rosie."
"You shouldn't touch your face or scratch your eyes until you've washed your hands." Viktor said, figuring the last thing anyone here wanted was for Rosie to catch anything from Scout today.
"Yeah, they told me they'd get back to me about a try-out day." Sherlock said and shrugged, "I've sent them a big cheque and a few pages where I describe her intellect and just to be safe subtly make sure the understand that there are more cheques where that one came from." he said and smiled, "I mean, honestly, I don't think we need bribing to get her in, but I want to make 100% sure that it works out for her. There's enough she has to deal with."
"Yeah, he or she is very, very mean." Charlie said, figuring she'd best spare the little one the details and got to her feet after putting their files back into the cabinet. "Can we trust Sherlock, you think?' She asked after a moment; after all he'd been understanding towards Rosie (which also meant he was likely smart himself plus, he was possibly Violet's son, if Rosie hadn't fibbed) and they could use an adult ally.
"I don't have allergies, John." Sherlock said and shook his head with a smile, "Remember? Hyperactive immune system?" he asked and raised a brow at the packs John had taken. "You're very optimist for tonight huh, how many are that? 40?" he laughed, nudging John's shoulder with his own. Sherlock and we ignore that a hyperactive immune system technically makes allergies more likely...
"Damn right, because if it weren't for me, you'd hardly even consider it." John pointed out, before adding with a slight smirk. "And I definitely wouldn't mind you coming round to watch me eat."
"Yeah because that way they don't have to hurt other animals to scare them away!" Ally said and smiled.
Sherlock smirked as he sat down on John's back and watching John cheekily, "I will get to watch you change, right? I mean.. after all I have to spend the day with people that don't really want me there, so I deserve some sort of treat before." he chuckled and leant back against the pillows.
"I should add that we each found our significant other randomly and not at family events." John said after a moment with a laugh, because even he thought their family trees looked weird at this point. Charlie frowned. "Wow, that's a lot of coincidences. You really weren't lying when you said the people in John's family are good at relationships with Holmeses."
"Yeah, it was amazing. And he's just gorgeous..." Charlie said with a grin and let out a soft and happy sigh. After a moment she looked a bit more serious. "Seriously though, please please please don't tell my dads.. They'll think I'm I'm pregnant halfway through your story and have Lowell killed by the end of it." She said, giving Jane a look.
“Shit! What the fuck... But could it have been, you know, self-inflicted? I don't mean suicide, but... some sort of sex game gone wrong?” John sounds weary.
Eventually, John had had mercy and coated the dildo protruding from Sherlock's mouth with lube. “Now it's your turn, Sherlock. You know how I like it. Nice and slow.” And Sherlock had set to work, fucking John's hole with the dildo attached to his face, in and out, so close, smelling John as his puckered hole gave way right before his eyes.
Sherlock rolls over to the wall while John switches off the light. The room goes pitch black. John’s only guide is the light of his cheap phone's small display. He crawls under the covers and drapes one arm carefully around Sherlock’s middle, falling asleep before his head even hits the pillow.
Sherlock is impaled on John's left arm, circling his hips, rocking, gliding up and down like a puppet, fitting John's hand like a glove, sheathing his arm. John twists his fist again and Sherlock makes a hissing noise.
Late that night, when John had popped out again and bought some bread, cheese and wine, they sit naked and cross-legged on the bed (the duvet soaking in the bath) while Sherlock tells him about the last four weeks. John smiles and frowns, nods and listens. He will tell Sherlock in return how badly he missed him, alone in London, but not tonight. This is their reunion, their celebration, and he will not spoil it with his grief.
It's Big. So big! Sherlock can't imagine how the toy might possibly fit his narrow passage, and yet...
Up in this flat, Mycroft keeps his equipment in a large wardrobe with sliding mirrored doors. Sherlock is aware of John inspecting the collection and choosing a device of his liking. Mycroft approves with a low hum. When John turns around, Sherlock can see that he's holding a hickory spanking paddle, about fifteen inches long and rather slim, with eight holes to allow for the delivery of fast blows in quick succession.
Sherlock just nods and moans in desperation. John gets a pair of kitchen scissors and cuts through the strips of black Gaffer tape around Sherlock's arms and legs. At last he rips off the strip covering Sherlock’s mouth in one swift move. It still stings and Sherlock can taste blood as his delicate lips are torn open.
Sherlock remembers getting the bowl the next morning. He crouches on the floor and holds it up while John empties his bladder, sitting on the edge of the bed. Afterwards, John stirs glucose into the piss and feeds it to Sherlock via the tube until his belly is nicely rounded. Then he tends to Sherlock's abused skin, gently washing the dried blood off and applying antiseptic ointment, while Sherlock desperately tries not to wet himself. The wounds are just superficial and will heal in a day or two. But his belly is so full that it hurt, yet John strokes and massages it with both hands while Sherlock sits into his lap.
Sherlock puts down his small cup. “I'm sure we left DNA behind.” John grins and nods. “Not funny, John.”
Sherlock's eyes open as sharp pain sears through his body. Toby has pinched his left nipple with one hand while expertly pushing the needle through the sensitive flesh just below the hardened nub. What little blood wells up is caught in a sterile wipe. Sherlock watches, mesmerised, as a dark red stain blooms onto the fabric while Toby pulls the needle out and quickly replaces it with one of the silver rings.
Sherlock is panting hard and almost unable to stand any longer when John enters the room about five minutes later. Sherlock's face is burning. He's only able to take quick, shallow breathes, and black spots dance before his eyes as he's on the verge of hyperventilating. His balls feel drained, yet there's still more clear fluid trickling from his slit.
“There have been so many instances when you've acted like an annoying prat, little brother. Do you remember the Bruce Partington plans, for example? How many times have I sat here and imagined you, tied down onto this beauty, helpless, at my mercy. Well, I think it's time to turn this fantasy into reality. It'll get you in the right mood, I'm sure of it.”
“I told you, guys, all laid out and ready to be used.” John answers as he moves around the group, looking sternly down at Sherlock. “Aren't you, love?”
Was he really interested in anything to do with Sherlock anymore? Why should he be? After his... demise, his whole live – or what the media had been able to unearth – had been tabloid fodder. It had lasted about a week. John doubted there was anything left he didn't know about Sherlock. It was over. He had to let go and move on.
“I... I don't...” he stammers, confused and perplexed. Her gloved left hand slaps him, hard, and to his embarrassment his cock twitches. He gets even more hard when Irene pushes all five fingers sheathed into his mouth, making him choke and grunt in desperation. The taste of latex is almost intoxicating and Sherlock wants to suck, nibble, succumb to being forcefully entered like this. He wants to do whatever Miss Adler has in mind for him.
Suddenly, the rod glides almost all the way in. Sherlock huffs as he can feel some inner barrier being pierced. “God, I think I just pushed right inside your balls.” John's voice is rough with arousal. “Does it feel good?” Sherlock experiences slight discomfort at the idea of being penetrated by a sharp object. But he trusts John, so he nods again and hums in approval.
It's still tight, but also slippery. John slides in easily. His stiff cock is sensitive from hours of playing, teasing. It won't take long. Sherlock is barely conscious anyway.
John slaps him so hard that he's thrown sideways onto the mattress, before being pulled up by his hair and pushed onto his knees on the floor.
“I think it's enough.” John says, putting the glass down onto the floor. “Mycroft, switch that toy off.” Sherlock feels wetness on his cheeks and needs a few moments to realise that he's crying. The look John gives him is a strange mixture of exasperation and concern.
“What's so funny about?” John shouts, and is tempted to smash the laptop onto the floor. Instead, he just shoves it onto the mattress, disgusted.
“Was Acri fighting with someone? Did he seem sad, or angry? Did anyone behave suspiciously?” The Inspector is browsing through her notes, tapping her pen against the table-top.
It's coming in huge waves now, and Sherlock is unable to ingest it all. It splashes all over his face, drips from his mouth, runs down his throat and chest and pools between his thighs. Eventually, the boy just spits remnants of frothy saliva into his mouth and on his face.
John finally had had some mercy with Sherlock and had removed the cock ring. By now the ache of Sherlock's straining muscles had taken the edge of his arousal, leaving him kind of numb. When the first cloth pins had been attached to his balls, Sherlock had groaned behind his gag but had been far from coming.
He does. He puts two fingers in his mouth and pushes them down his throat, triggering his gag reflex. His whole body convulses, but then the pasty white mass he just swallowed over the last fifteen minutes comes up again, flooding his mouth before splashing into the bowl. He has to heave a few times before he's sure his stomach's empty. His cramping stomach muscles trigger the sound again and his cock throbs despite being caged.
The first whack hits Sherlock’s arse, setting his cheeks jiggling. A bright red stripe appears, welling up quickly .
It feels strange and intrusive to go through Sherlock’s old stuff. There are a few books, records, CDs and tapes, note pads, school reports – but nothing personal, no photographs, drawings or toys nor  the typical knick knack one collects as a child and teenager, sentimental keepsakes that one doesn’t need anymore but doesn’t want to throw away either and therefore stores with one’s parents to preserve when moving out. John’s father still has John’s old Action Man as well as snapshots from school trips, drawings, letters he received from Beth Morgan when they both had been in year eight and had exchanged sloppy kisses behind the bikeshed, a box of shells John had collected during a summer holiday in Weston-super-Mare.
When the crop comes down hard onto his cleft it feels like he's split in half by an incandescent rod.
Sherlock shivers and sobs silently onto the table top. He's drooling and closes his eyes to shut out the humiliation.
Mycroft has dropped the chain and stepped back a little, leaning against his desk, watching his brother undress. He smiles.
John first undoes Sherlock's feet so that he can stand on shaking legs while he unties his arms. When released, his arms and shoulder ache rather badly. His back also complains. John slings an arm around his waist and supports him as they both hobble back to the bench. The cool marble feels lovely against Sherlock's abused arse.
When he arrives home his arse still feels a little sore, and winces as he climbs the stairs. Greg did take him hard after all, but Sherlock is a little proud of himself that he finally got Lestrade's seal of approval. The DI seemed sated and satisfied when Sherlock had left.
John peels off the glove, still glistening with lube, before kissing Sherlock’s knuckles, his palm, his wrist, then gathers him up in his arms. They end up in a pile of limbs on the bedroom floor, John leaning against the mattress with his lap full of a totally spent consulting detective with his eyes drooping and his cheeks still flushed. They are both sticky, covered in come, lube and sweat, but neither of them cares right now.
The inspector doesn't bat an eyelid. “Of course.” She retorts with only the smallest hint of an accent. “Or we could get you an interpreter.”
He moans around his gag, his voice low, not just from sexual arousal. There’s true Sherlockian excitement in the sounds he makes.
He’s already panting, the idea of taking John and Mycroft at the same time making him slightly dizzy. He smears lube all over John's shaft and his own cleft before lining John's erection up with his hole to slowly sink down on it.
After he's squeezed an exceptionally fat load out of a condom, Acri says to John: “I'm not sure he's properly savouring the taste. Keep it in your mouth a little longer. Play with it. That's it, on your tongue, between your teeth. Gargle with it. God, you don't know any shame, do you?”
He gives Sherlock about ten minutes to escape. That's how long he's able to face the mob at their front door. He tries to come over as confused but genuine, denying as best he can the allegations hurled at him.
The plug glides back into his hole as the straps of the chastity belt are fastened around Sherlock's waist. John tells him to take his erection in one hand and pull his slit a little apart with the other. As Sherlock obliges, John carefully inserts the tip of the sound into his urethra and slowly pushes it in.
Sherlock's still wearing his slim tailored trousers and a white bespoke dress shirt – but has at least shed his jacket and kicked off his shoes sometime during the evening.
Sherlock looks up at him through wet lashes as his very talented tongue starts to massage the underside of John's cock as he begins to suck in earnest, his deep guttural moans resonating right up into John's balls. This feels amazing, and John would love to come like this, but he also needs to fuck Sherlock so hard and deep it might feel like being split him in half.
“I have a very special surprise for you at the flat.” John whispers into his ear as they sit in the cab, and the shiver running down Sherlock's spine has nothing to do with being cold.
It needs physical effort to touch the damned device again, but John forces himself to. He deletes the pictures and both videos. He would love to destroy the whole mobile, smash it to bits, melt it in their fireplace, but the phone incorporates Sherlock's whole life. He has no right to do something so drastic. That will be up to Sherlock.
That's why John pulls out after a few minutes, slapping Sherlock's cheeks a few times with his hard wet cock just because he can, and Sherlock makes the loveliest needy noises as he's deprived of the boner in his mouth. Soon, saliva and precome glisten on Sherlock's cheekbones, and John decides that the next time he'll have Sherlock wear make-up as well. Smeared lipstick and runny mascara will be a nice addition to his already debauched look.
“Now, that's convenient. I'll drench you in my piss until you choke on it. It feels there might be plenty. So we better go downstairs and get you into the tub.”
His balls are pressed against the ridge of Sherlock's nose as he pushes as far into his wet mouth as possible. John doesn't show any consideration as he ruthlessly thrusts in and out, deeper and deeper. But the man beneath him shows no signs of resistance either as he offers his body and its orifices to be used. John watches as a crimson flush creeps down the milky expanse of his lovers chest and is sure that Sherlock loves what they are doing at least as much as he does.
Sherlock's head lolls on his neck, his whole body gone limp. He just takes it. And takes it. Mycroft is pistoning in and out of him, snapping his hips, slapping against his bruised cheeks, but Sherlock is unable to come. He just lies back and lets his body be used for what it’s made for.
But John shows no mercy as he twists the brush deep inside Sherlock’s colon. “Your hole is sleazy, Sherlock. I don’t know how often I pissed into it over the last few weeks. A toilet has to be scrubbed from time to time. For you, that’s now.”
“She was someone's daughter, Sherlock. She should have been at school, not in a brothel.” John gives Irene a sharp look but she just shrugs and glances over to Mycroft.
When the beaker is empty, he at least hopes that his ordeal might be over. But to his horror, John walks over to the sink and prepares another portion to repeat the procedure. It's simply too much.
“I'll send the maid with hot water and towels.” Irene offers before silently gliding out of the room. At the door, however, she turns around. “He's something special, Doctor Watson. Look after him.”
He also somehow knew that this was a once in a lifetime chance. He'd lived with Sherlock for some time now – and never had the man been so open when it came to... physical stuff. Intimate stuff. Sex. Therefore, John had decided to knock back another drink and plough ahead. If it turned out to be disastrous – as his recent love life tended to be – he could blame the booze, and argue that Sherlock had started it.
“Oh, but Doctor Watson, someone with your reputation... I feel rather flattered.” She gives John a slow appreciative smile that John returns with a slight shrug.
They both can't help it. It starts with a small smirk that develops rather quickly in one of their uncontrollable giggling fits usually reserved for extra-gruesome crime scenes. John has to grab the edge of the counter while Sherlock rests his bare arse – the sod really doesn't wear any pants beneath those bespoke suits – onto their kitchen table.
John watches as Sherlock's uninjured right hand slides lower and eventually gives his cock the much needed friction as his long fingers palm himself through his tight black trousers. His hard nipples are visible through the nearly translucent cotton and John licks his lips as he imagines pinching them until Sherlock weeps in agony.
John has just unbuttoned his fly and is now shoving his hard cock down Sherlock's throat, while Sherlock is choking and moaning around him, his noises of pleasure every now and then interrupted by sharp gasps of pain as the tongue of Sally's crop bites into his marble skin.
“You sure?” Dimmock enquires, which is answered with one of Sherlock's epic eyerolls, impressive despite the cut to his eyebrow.
Sherlock swallows and nods, already getting somewhat aroused by the fantasies playing out in his head.
Eventually, Sherlock can feel John's rectum loosen; he spikes his tongue and pushes in. His lewd moan is stifled by John's flesh. The taste is sharp and bitter, but Sherlock loves it. John shouts “Fuck!” and leans even further forward, granting Sherlock better access. He eagerly starts to tongue-fuck John's hole, pushing deeper and deeper past the yielding ring of muscle until John tells him to stop.
As he is about to cross the road to get rid of his pursuer in the maze of little streets that make up this part of town, he has to suddenly jump backwards to avoid being run over by a Vespa. The driver shouts something at him that doesn't sound too friendly, and John slows down to preen around a corner to be on the save side before continuing his flight. But this turns out to have been a mistake when long, strong fingers grab his arm, clutching around his biceps.
“Thank you, John.” Sherlock gasps, but stays in place; John hasn't allowed him to get up. His arse is a lump of red, raw flesh, decorated with angry crimson welts. John puts the crop aside. Sherlock can't take any more of this. But he's not done yet. In fact, he might have acquired a taste.
Sherlock goes still beneath him as John's index finger caresses his hole, flicking it tenderly, spreading the cool fluid dripping out of it down Sherlock's cleft.
Which seems superfluous to Sherlock, regarding what he's just been through. The pain he's suffered cocoons him like an aura. He's floating on a cloud of endorphins, set adrift in a space between hyper-vigilance and unconsciousness. But as John starts to remove the cloth pins one after another the sharp pain that shoots through Sherlock's body has him howling in agony behind his gag. He throws his head from one side to another, sending spit and sweat flying, as he helplessly pleads with John to stop his torment. The coating of wax over his cock and testicles breaks away, leaving highly-sensitive skin behind that John caresses with his fingertips. Sherlock's spine arches off the bed and he can taste blood in his mouth.
It takes ages. John strokes and tugs, teases and pulls, squeezes and pumps while Sherlock whimpers with need and arousal, reduced to a quivering mess. He can't even beg or plead. All he can do is endure John's touch and try not to come until eventually, despite his best efforts to prevent it, he can feel his climax building like an unstoppable tidal wave. Sherlock groans in despair. He's panicking, trying to warn John, silently bargaining for a lenient punishment as his orgasm is wrought from his tense body. He comes and comes, his body shaking, the rope pulling at his nipple rings, and the noises he makes are almost animalistic, high croaks and desperate rasps. John's fingers get sticky and nicely slippery with Sherlock's semen.
“You are doing so well. Breath. Don't fight it.” But the toy is still not properly inside him. There's a long way to go. John pulls out a bit, watches Sherlock's hole flutter, already swollen, the light pink turned red. John bows down, licks a bit, just with the tip of his tongue, until Sherlock's sighs and gives him a sharp nod as a sign to continue.
“Now, now, Mr Holmes, have we been a naughty boy?” Moriarty smiles darkly as he takes in the bruises.
He can feel Sherlock tense as he opens the door to the sitting room. All eyes are suddenly on them. John encouragingly touches the small of Sherlock's back above the tattoo and gives him a little shove, whispering in his ear: “They'll love you. Just remember, relax. Do as you're told. All will be fine.”
Sherlock needs a few minutes to accomplish his task. Eventually, John pulls the dildo away to see if Sherlock did a thorough job. As the toy is glistening with spit and nothing else, John nods with approval before putting it on the bed.
“Clean cut. The victim didn't struggle. He was tied up and didn't know what was coming. I'd say a scalpel was used, or a very sharp razor blade. But because of the precision I think it was a medical instrument. He bled to death. Got what he deserved, in my opinion.”
Which she does in quick succession, criss-crossing the strokes from Sherlock's shoulders down to the swell of his buttocks until he sobs and has difficulty breathing. Black dots dance before his eyes. His hands scrabble over the table top, searching for leverage. He's not sure how much he's already bleeding.
Sherlock quickly crawls over to him on all four and presses his eager mouth into the exposed cleft. The boy is absolutely hairless down here and tastes of expensive soap, lube and come. With his speared tongue, Sherlock pushes in, lapping up the thick goo. It has been a lot. Sherlock's
Sherlock has lost some weight due to the tube feeding. As his weight hadn't been healthy even before that, he's now quite thin, sinewy, all taut skin, lean muscles and delicate bones. This will help him suffering through his next ordeal.
“That wasn't so difficult, was it?” John says when the glass is finally empty. Sherlock doesn't meet his eyes.
He's almost on the verge of seriously choking, already getting blue in the face, when they eventually manage to untie his heaving body and remove the spider gag, allowing him to cough for real, slobbering all over himself. They leave him lying on the floor, covered in disgorged porridge, while discussing how to proceed.
When they break apart, John presses their foreheads together, still clutching the liquor in his right hand. He's sure he'll need it tonight, but not the way he needed booze over the last few weeks; not to sedate him, but to celebrate. Due to his sudden movements, some cognac has spilled over his hand. He holds his damp fingers up, and without being told, Sherlock’s tongue darts out, pink and wet, to lap the sticky liquid up, tentatively licking before boldly sucking John’s fingers into his mouth, one after the other.
John has to admit to himself that he absolutely loves using Sherlock when he's tied up and open, overwhelmed by the sheer incredibility the degrading things he begs John to do to him entail.
“Are you alright?” John asks, gesturing up and down Sherlock's moist body, pale skin flushed pink from the heat.
“Is there a purpose to this visit, or do you just want to rile John up and humiliate me?” Sherlock asks, sounding rather bored.
“Don't get distracted, brother mine.” Mycroft mumbles into his ear as he finally let’s go, his teeth marking Sherlock's skin. “John is merely here to assist. This is about you and me tonight. Don't forget that.”
He's been lying face down on the mattress for hours now, exhausted yet still so very horny. None of his three orgasms today truly eased the arousal pooling low in his guts, and John is only coming into his mouth or all over his face and chest, not inside him. He desperately wants the feeling of John breaching him, filling him, his semen leaking out of him afterwards.
After manoeuvring the car into one of the vast parking lots, trying to find a space as far away from the security cameras as possible, he wakes Sherlock up and tries to explain. “I'm going to hire a new car. You stay here. I'll be back soon.”
They both have to hold their breath, and only when John is sure that he won't come right here and now does he tentatively start to wiggle his fingers inside Sherlock.
John sighs. “I think we have to talk?” He sounds almost equally daunted by that prospect. “And you'll have to accept that I won't initially forgive you. These things take time.”
When Rossi pulls out with a grunt afterwards, Sherlock stays crouched over the desk. He's not sure if his legs would support him right now if he gets up. His whole body hurts.
John had expected the interior being all dark oak panelled, antics and brass and therefore is pleasantly surprised by the whitewashed walls and light wooden beams. The large rooms are furnished scantily in what he calls, for a lack of a better word, Scandinavian style. Abstract paintings line the walls. An open stairwell leads to the first floor.
“All right. I have to... conclude some interviews here.” The DI states, sensing that his presence is somewhat counterproductive at the moment. ”Thanks for passing this on. You better get going.” With that, he steps back into one of the downstairs rooms.
After letting the voice of his parents wash over him for another ten minutes, Mycroft bids his farewell on urgent government business. He's made it a habit to come up here every Sunday since his brother's demise, but is now contemplating cutting those visits to once every fortnight. It's getting tedious.
He thinks that by now they've all must have fucked him at least once, but he's not sure as he drifts in and out of consciousness. He jerks awake again when suddenly something big enters him. As he has to kneel on the floor, his cauterized, unfocused eyes try to make contact with Mycroft, who's leaning on the mantelpiece, watching his sufferings with a slight frown on his face, not even batting an eyelid. Sherlock silently begs him to make it stop, but Mycroft just turns away and pours himself another drink.
Therefore, he shuffles a little backwards and gets up on his knees, spreading his thighs while bracing his forearms against the old radiator as he presents his naked arse to the men. “Fuck me, please.” He whispers, but it's loud enough in the small kitchen for all of them to hear. Sherlock glances up at the group from under his lashes and smiles invitingly if shy.
Sherlock licks his lips, tasting John's come. He's desperate for release as well, but knows better than to demand something, anything, for himself. He's just a hole, a toy, with no will of his own.
He eagerly laps and sucks, licking broad stripes up and down the cleft, getting it nice and wet before pushing the tip of his tongue inside the loosened ring of muscle. The man in front of him growls and bucks, eliciting high-pitched, needy grunts from the young boy who must by now almost be suffocating from sucking cock.
“I'm afraid not.” John replies, and both Sherlock and the boy groan in disappointment. “But he can come onto the floor and Sven will lick it up.”
John wiggles out from under Sherlock and walks into the kitchen, leaving his still drowsy lover sulking in the bedroom.
“It's ok, it's over. I'm here. It's ok...” John murmurs while holding an almost catatonic Sherlock, rocking him back and forth while Moriarty's bleeds out merely five feet away, soaking Molly's lab coat and the hideous cardigan she wears underneath.
“Take a seat, little brother.” Mycroft gestures over to the chair. Sherlock carefully climbs onto the black leather seat. It's cold beneath his naked buttocks. Because of his bruises he's grateful for the bolster-work. A recess beneath the seat makes his arse easily accessible.
“Stop. Whining! Or I'll have John gag you.” He hisses, shoving yet another ridge up Sherlock's arse.
Afterwards, as the man entangles himself from between them, Sherlock and the boy immediately crush their lips together, Sherlock's tongue licking deep inside the other's mouth to get a taste of come. The Asian boy sucks his tongue as a reward to taste his master's ass. The surrounding men continue to spit at them, now on both their faces, until Sherlock can feel something warm hit his groin and belly while the boy in his arms trembles and shivers.
Sherlock is kneeling in front of John now, almost like a puppet, stuffed by his gloved hand. John's other hand has dropped to his waist, steadying him, while John's erection presses hot and heavy against Sherlock's damp arse cheek. John's cock is gorgeous, thick-veined, large and swollen, the tip shining wet, and Sherlock desperately wants to taste it. He can smell John, all tangy musk and pungent heat above the sharp odour of fresh piss. It's mouthwatering. Sherlock pants, helplessly, oblivious, then slouches forward a bit, even parting his lips as he imagines lapping at John's leaking slit.
They'd steadily made their way through two bottles of red wine before John had brought the whisky out. This prompted some kind of game – they both weren't sure anymore how it started, or what the rules said, if there even were any - but it involved telling each other things they'd never told anyone else before. At first, they'd confessed some rather minor secrets – lies they'd told, petty crimes they'd committed, people they'd snogged - and had graduated from there. Now, they'd arrived at their secret sexual fantasies, things they'd always wanted to try but never had dared to act out or even admit to previous partners.
John takes his time, careful not to hurt Sherlock. This is a little dangerous, but he's a doctor after all. Sherlock tries to relax and not to worry but that's easier said than done when a five inch long metal screw is pushed up one's penis.
Looking down, Sherlock can see John's big cock slide in and out of him as he sets a fast rhythm. It doesn't hurt, quite the opposite, and as John starts to hit his prostate with every third or fourth thrust ,Sherlock knows that he won't be able to last  much longer.
“Do you know who she is?” Sherlock walks over to the young girl, kneels before her, looking right up her spread thighs. Sally has to avert her eyes.
John lets his free hand roam possessively over Sherlock's arse cheeks, kneading them a little before pinching them hard. Crimson marks bloom on the pale skin. Sherlock yelps before he tries to stifle his gasps.
Sherlock stays very still, looking up to find John's face. Those blue eyes above are fixed on him while their guest chases his orgasm. John is sitting on the mattress, his own cock in hand, wanking languidly. But he's not watching Mark. Instead, he's staring at Sherlock, hungrily and determined. Sherlock is bathing in his gaze. The head of John's cock peaks out of his fist, red and shiny; the leather of Mark's high boots brush over his cheeks and he loves it, the feel, the scent – it’s perfect.
“Drink.” John presses the rim of the jar against Sherlock's lower lip and Sherlock reluctantly takes a sip of his own by now cold piss. “Swallow.” John orders and Sherlock does, even as the salty bitter taste nearly makes him gag.
“So...”, he starts when they are alone, drawing out the word to raise anticipation. “Are you curious what we unearthed about Moriarty, little brother?”
Sherlock's cheek burns. He has to blink a few times to clear his vision, fixing his eyes on the grimy linoleum as he eventually mumbles barely audible: “I drank my own piss.”
“You look delicious.” John hums in appreciation, lazily teasing Sherlock with the chop sticks. “This is so depraved and yet you are enjoying it.” Sherlock nods and moans in response, low and needy. “If I push to hard, I might seriously harm you. Or one of the sticks could slide fully inside you. We'd have to go to A&E to remove it. Imagine all the nurses and doctors giggling and joking about the stupid fag who fucked himself with chops sticks until one ended up his arse. God, the humiliation... I can see you blushing all over, Sherlock. I'm sure some nurses would probe your anus with gloved fingers, trying to locate the chop stick, perhaps even looking for other objects. Hm, doctors might want to take a good look as well, perhaps even taking pictures?”
They wash him, albeit with cold water. Because Mycroft calls him a human pissoire, John scrubs Sherlock’s skin with a toilet brush and Harpic until his whole body feels sore and tingles. John especially concentrates on his arse and groin, almost flaying his still hard cock while Mycroft declares that Sherlock is a dirty toilet slut, a human urinal smelling of piss that needs to be disinfected.
“Yes, and a very exclusive one. She's an expert.” John licks his lips. “Do you have anything to add?” He asks to Sherlock's astonishment. Upon sensing Sherlock's confusion, John tentatively enquires: “Have you ever done anything at all, Sherlock? I mean sexual. Ever? Anything?”
“John, what...” He huffs out as he tries to twist his head to see what's happening. John's arm looks weird, and it takes Sherlock a moment to notice that he must have pulled on the violet household gloves that usually lie next to the kitchen sink.
“You want a big one?” John asks, almost smiling, after pressing a soft kiss against Sherlock's shaking fingertips. “Ok, then, how about this one?” John holds up a rather large glass plug, bigger than the black rubber plug he has just removed, but not frighteningly huge. Sherlock just licks his lips and nods. God, how he wants that.
She turns so that Sherlock can unbuckle her skirt. When it falls to the floor she's just in her black high heels, black hold-ups and white corset. Her round firm arse sports a brand mark on the right cheek, the letters I and A entwined. Sherlock swallows, remembering his own punishment from last night. He's tempted to brush his fingers over the mark but is sure that this will not be allowed. Nevertheless, he's fascinated by the degree of submission proven by this mark. It must have hurt like hell. As Sherlock let's his eyes roam over Kate's body to distract him from his thoughts he discovers that she's got freckles on her shoulder, which Sherlock finds strangely cute.
The last thing John sees before the door is closed in his face are the guests positively leering at Sherlock. John stares at the solid wooden door frame a whole minute until he turns and leans his back against it, taking a few deep breaths to compose himself. After a moment, however, he can hear characteristic sounds emerge from behind the door. Slaps, moans, more laughter. He resolutely walks into the kitchen to get himself a beer.
The small upper neck isn't a problem. But when the bottle starts to widen, Sherlock slows down. He carefully bobs up and down a few times before sinking deeper. A small pained sigh escapes him as the broader part breaches him. Yet he continues to fuck himself on the bottle. John is sitting up in bed by now, watching him while slowly stroking his own cock.
Meanwhile, Sherlock made his way by bus to Berlin. He paid cash, and due to the Schengen agreement passport controls between Germany and the Netherlands were non-existent. Sven Sigerson from Norway crossed the border unnoticed.
John really had no idea who he'd been meeting. An old friend of Sherlock with a message from beyond the grave? An old enemy, still holding a grudge, out to settle the score once and for all? Some lunatic, who'd lured him onto the continent to share a particularly crazy conspiracy theory (there had been some disturbingly insane posts on the blog last time he'd bothered to look)?
“Don't you dare to come, Sherlock.” John hisses between two blows. Sherlock screws his eyes shut tightly and shakes his head. His desperate moans and growls fill the room while he can smell his own musk and sweat heavy in the air.
When the fourth man is finally finished with Sherlock, he's a sweaty, debased mess. His wrists and arms are grazed open and bleeding; bruises bloom dark on his pale skin. Saliva, blood and come run down his throat and chest, while pearly pre-come pools onto the floor beneath Sherlock's by now almost purple cock. The men stand around him, watching him while sipping cold beer directly from the bottle, smoking and smirking. The whole room smells of blood, sex and agony.
His lower back starts to hurt, the wound John has superficially covered last night threatening to open up again. His legs really burn by now, as does his abused hole. He's sure he'll be sore for some time. Maybe it will show when he tries to walk, the slight chafing reminding him of the lewd things he did to please John.
“We could bring him down to one of the holding cells some Saturday night.” Greg grunts as he has eventually stilled. “When we have some heavies in. They'd love to fuck the living daylights out of the world's only consulting detective.” He doesn't withdraw his cock, though, but lets it soften inside Sherlock.
John takes a step back and watches Sherlock piss himself, the urine eventually dripping from beneath the satin. He lets Sherlock sit in his mess for a little while longer, squeezing his now soft cock through the wet fabric, ignoring Sherlock sobbing with sensitivity.
John has already left for work when Sherlock gets up the next day. He doesn't bother getting dressed, just settles on the couch in nothing but his dressing gown, reading, sipping the odd cup of tea and yelling at the telly. John doesn't even say hello when he eventually walks in but heads directly for the bathroom, taking a very prolonged shower.
He's the only one to give his name, in a guttural, heavily accented voice. John shakes the offered hand, his eyes darting between Sherlock's brother and his pal.
When John finally pushes the plug past Sherlock's sphincter and it settles snugly inside him, Sherlock lets out a sound part moan, part cry. To soothe him, John brings his mouth down to kiss Sherlock's perineum, very softly, before getting up.
Sherlock's eyes are by now screwed shut and his mouth hangs open. He's drooling. God, the tawse hurts. Especially as John is now flogging his whole body mercilessly, right up to his shoulder blades. Even when he has to pause for a moment, the leather tongues caress Sherlock's sore skin with . As the piss cools on his legs and he stands in a lukewarm puddle, Sherlock can feel himself sliding deeper and deeper into subspace, embracing the pain, the humiliation, trying to become one with it, accepting it, welcoming it. He's debasing himself but he doesn't care anymore.
“Oh, I won’t.” John answers, stroking Sherlock’s curls back from his face, pulling his head up while crouching down in front of him. “But you will.”
It's suddenly very quiet in the room. John knows that Sherlock's eyes are trying to penetrate the darkness and bear into him, to cut him open and take a long, hard look at his inner mechanics.
As much as being confined like this turns Sherlock on, it also gives him an eerie sense of peace. He can't do anything. All there is for him to do is breathing, listening to his own heartbeat and his blood rushing through his veins. Quiet fills his head; under different circumstances, this would drive him mad. But not tonight. Not after those two weeks of high-strung anticipation and coming completely undone this evening. Now finally getting some rest is somehow alluring. All responsibility is taken from him. He can relax. John's in charge.
“I think we found our host.” John whispers into Sherlock's ear. An almost naked servant passes them, just clad in small satin pants, carrying a tablet full of champagne flutes. John takes one and presses it in Sherlock's hand.
Sherlock's eyes are dark and hooded by then, his cheeks flushed. John can see his pulse throbbing in his throat. Enough is enough, he decides after fifteen minutes, and suggests they change location to get a bite to eat. Does Sven have any suggestions...
Before steering him to the exit of the club, however, John shows him the showers where Sherlock is subjected to a hosing down with icy water by a tall, thin man in a white apron while John gets his coat. Sherlock crouches down, balancing on his high heels as he tries to protect his body from the cold spray, hugging his shins to minimise the surface of impact.
“I knew I would meet you again today, so I got myself ready for you.” Sherlock breathes, his head hanging low between his arms, his sharp shoulder-blades forming a pale ridge on his sweaty back. The round, silver base of a plug is visible between his cheeks, protruding from his hole. It’s beautiful. John brushes his fingertips over the smooth metal before flicking it a few times. Sherlock rocks forward and moans.
“Not yet. I going to fuck him first.” John has already walked over to Sherlock's exposed arse and now presses the head of his cock against Sherlock's yielding entrance. John unceremoniously pushes in all the way until he's fully seated, his jeans and pants still round his thighs. He's desperate to fuck Sherlock, who has no resistance left and just lets John claim him. John holds onto Sherlock's bound thighs as he fucks him rough and fast, plunging deep, then pulling almost all the way out. It's a brutal rhythm with which John hits Sherlock's prostate almost every time. Sherlock is leaking over his stomach while chanting John's name, only half-conscious due to pain and arousal.
“She's young.” He swallows. “Very young. Barely developed breasts. Her... private parts don't seem shaven, so no pubic hair yet... I would have to look at her teeth but I'd say she's about... ten.”
Mycroft makes a few choked sounds as he comes in his office at Whitehall, and Sherlock closes his eyes to imagine his brother stroking his big cock to completion over a picture of his come streaked face.
“Don't you dare to come.” John hisses, pulling the chain taut again, and Sherlock shakes his head, his sweaty curls sticking to his smudgy face. He feels grubby all over, but that’s surely how Mycroft and John want him.
They take their time, drawing it out. This is not about instant climaxing. They just want Sherlock to tease them, to stimulate them, to keep them keyed up and on the edge.
Despite being blindfolded and forced into silence, Sherlock doesn't feel the unsettling detachment that had plagued him in the beginning of this scene. Now, he feels save, owned. Everything has been taken care of. He doesn't have to do anything besides giving in. He allows himself to fall. He trusts John and Mycroft. It's a shocking revelation. He realises how much he loves to hand over responsibilities. Even for his body.
John only pulls out as Irene hands him the small black plug. He replaces his cock with it, sealing Sherlock before his come can leak out. They'll play with it later, at home.
“Yes. I need it. I need you to fuck me. Hard.” Sherlock blurts out, trying to sound seductive despite the pain. “You feel so good inside my mancunt. Please, take me. Deeper.”
“I'd guessed so, the way you went down on my pets and ate them out.” Acri's hand pushes into Sherlock's hair, turning his head to face him.
“John, I can’t anymore…” Sherlock whispers. “Please…” The brush has torn he corners of his mouth. He looks such a mess that John is almost moved to let him off the hook.
“God, look at you as you get your face fucked by my massive cock. Come on, suck me, show me how much you want it.”
“Sorry, so sorry, John...” Sherlock mumbles, and desperately tries to calm himself, to clench, to stop leaking. But to no avail.
John is rather glad that he chose his longer coat for his short shopping trip. His hard cock is throbbing in his jeans and the memory of Sherlock with a big glass plug up his arse, desperately sucking a rubber dildo with his impossible mouth doesn't help to calm him down. John just wants to be back and continue playing.
“Ok, so...” Sherlock turns to the sink to get his shaving kit but John stops him by grabbing his wrist.
Suddenly, Sherlock is sure that he wants and needs this – not only servicing John, being his whore to use as he pleases, but getting hurt by him as well, exploring their limits.
“Incredibly.” Sherlock breaths. “I can feel my own piss slosh around inside myself. God, John, this... is so hot, please, let me come... please.” He actually whimpers with need.
“Please, John. I live to serve.” Sherlock's voice trembles a little as the words drip from his lips, sweat and thick like treacle.
“John, please, stop.” The deep, velveteen voice gasps behind him. “These shoes are really not made for running after you.” It’s breathless, and sounds so much like John's memories of Sherlock - beneath him, in bed, held down and forced into submission - that it actually hurts in his chest. Yet John doesn't dare to look around.
Sherlock's heartbeat starts to race as he watches. He remembers John filling him up with his piss a mere hour ago, the sensation, the smell... he wants it again, desperately.
Sherlock does. It's slim, but very long and solid, reaching hidden places deep inside Sherlock's rectum. After a few thrusts, he's already panting hard, begging for more. John speeds up, rocking Sherlock faster, back and fourth, back and fourth, until Sherlock comes with a surprised shout, spurting white come onto the dark earth. John just holds his hips steady, watching his body spasm and jerk in his bounds.
Ginger fucks him hard and fast. Sherlock is again and again shoved against the radiator until his elbows are sore. The cock inside him is really big, and the minimal lubrication the condom has provided is not nearly enough to make this only remotely comfortable, but the raw obscenity of it all makes Sherlock's head swim. He is already fucked sore when Ginger comes inside him, grunting like a pig.
They make Sherlock crawl all the way up to Mycroft’s suite of rooms. For additional discomfort, John had threaded black hemp rope beneath the silver chain attached to the nipple clamps and tightly wound the rope around each of Sherlock's thighs. Therefore, the clamps are pulling at Sherlock's nipples with every move he makes, tugging at the chain as Sherlock scuttles along wood-panelled corridors and up a flight of stairs. Precome dribbles freely from his hard cock, leaving a translucent trail behind.
John kneads his arsecheeks, pulling them apart to watch the toy shift inside Sherlock's tight ring of muscle. It's mesmerising.
They had arrived in Florence yesterday. While Sherlock had visited the Uffici today, John had gone shopping. Sherlock had been thrilled all day imagining what John might have bought and how he intended his purchases to use. They had left most of their gear in Berlin, wanting a fresh start. Sherlock imagines that Judith might get a little shock when she opens her wardrobe... But as they had paid for the damage to some of her furnishings, he didn't have a guilty conscious.
“Sure. You lot like to watch?” As neither men does leave the room, Toby nods. “Thought so. Ok, you already decided on the rings earlier.”
Sherlock only removes his hand as she's fully seated in John's lap and sits back on his heels to watch.
“In fact, I do!” John barks as he yanks Sherlock's trousers and pants down, revealing his beautiful arse still open and stuffed with the large black toy. Despite – or perhaps because – of all the stress John has endured over the last 18 hours, it looks mouth-watering.
“Twenty... two.” Sherlock's voice falters as his sweaty fingers skitter over the table top in need of purchase.
“How about some breakfast?” Mycroft asks form behind Sherlock. He's holding the detached catheter bag filled with Sherlock's piss. John looks up at him and nods.
“He is quite a beauty.” She tells John who meets Sherlock's eyes when replying: “You should see him when he's tied up and helpless.”
Sherlock does, pulling one knee up at his side, exposing himself. His balls are already tight against his perineum. John watches small droplets of cold water run over it.
The clenching and fluttering of his stretched hole, however, is the last straw that's needed to send both John and Mycroft over the edge. Sherlock can feel their cocks swell before spurting inside him, filling him with hot, wet come. It immediately starts to leak out of him, soiling the sheets, but Sherlock can't help it. He's not sure he will ever be able to contract his hole again. He feels ripped apart. But he doesn't care. If John and Mycroft want an open, leaking fuckdoll, he'll be that. For them. Anything for them.
John slowly turns. Sherlock reaches out to take the needle form John's hand before facing the mirror. He swallows, then brings the tip of the needle up to press against the right corner of his lower lip. Their eyes lock in the mirror, and Sherlock hesitates briefly, taking a deep breath, before pushing the needle through, piercing his lip. John sits down on the edge of the tub, crosses his arms over his chest, and watches.
Suddenly, John removes the needle and gets up. “Be right back.” He gasps, walking over into the kitchen, where Sherlock can hear him rummaging through their drawers. He can feel a light burn inside his penis, but he's also already missing the peculiar feeling of something being pushed inside him that way.
John quickly finds the bottle and places it next to the knife. He stares at the plug, but avoids the black letters still decorating Sherlock's sacrum.
Before Kate can start to hump her wet cunt against Sherlock's thigh, however, she is brutally pulled back by her pony tail. Miss Adler slaps her face three times, leaving bright red marks on her cheeks and orders her not to behave like a bitch in heat. When Kate kneels submissively by John's chair, begging for forgiveness, Irene turns her attention towards Sherlock.
” Sherlock huffs, frustrated, dizzy with arousal and pent up need. “Please...” He's becoming incoherent, his brain awash with endorphins. Reasoning flies out of the window as the only thing that has any significance in his life is John's cock.
He's led down to the basement on his brother's arm as not to stumble. Sherlock's usually secure stride has been reduced to a careful scurry. They meet a few servants, but no one gives Sherlock as much as an odd look. They all greet politely and mind their own business.
Sherlock almost trips as he stumbles onto his feet. He's down the stairs before John is even out of bed and already waits, kneeling in their bathtub, when John enters the loo. John has to fight his beginning erection as he pulls his pants down to mid-thigh. He has to breath deeply a few times to relax and allow the yellow stream to flow freely from his cock. He aims for Sherlock's open mouth and watches as Sherlock starts to swallow.
“I... I just want to tell you that... it's all fine.” Sherlock finishes, holding his gaze. “It's all fine.” He repeats. Sherlock never repeats himself.
A hand is kneading his left arsecheek as the policeman writes something onto the marred skin just above Sherlock’s sacrum: “Fuckhole,” Sherlock registers.
“Because.” The man crosses his arms in front of his chest and positions himself between Sherlock and the door. His eyes are small slits in his reddened face. His breathing is speeding up. So he likes a bit of resistance.
“It's... like a dream. The David... and with... beautiful parks and gardens...” Sherlock tries to suppress his sobs, leaning his thin, trembling frame against John's reliable, solid body, giving in to being held.
Sherlock makes a dismissive gesture. “Dry cleaners.” He answers by way of an explanation. “Unless you want to see me in something else?”
John’s face is so close, his eyes dark with the promise of exquisite torment. It’s been so long, just the two of them... The previous night had just been a suggestion, hinting at something dark yet tender they could explore together. It’s unspoken and fragile, hanging between them, unfathomable but becoming more lucid the longer they test their boundaries.
“Come on, let's go to Oxford, we need to get you some decent clothes.” John whispers against Sherlock's lips when his cheeks have turned a very endearing pink.
Surprisingly, the first splash of warm piss doesn’t hit him in the face. Mycroft chooses his tormented nipples instead, pissing all over Sherlock’s chest before directing the stream downwards. Streaks of hot urine run over Sherlock’s concave belly and pool between his legs. But it’s not enough, Sherlock needs to taste his brother. He leans forward, desperate to get some piss in his mouth, and Mycroft answers his silent pleading and finally raises his stream up to Sherlock’s face, his open mouth. He swallows, greedily, thirsty, and instantly loves the taste of his brother’s piss. It's sharp, yet sweeter than John’s. To relish his depraved refreshment, Sherlock lets Mycroft fill his mouth over and over again before swallowing, drinking him down. His brother must have held it rather long, for Sherlock is soon kneeling in a dark yellow puddle as the piss gathers on the white tiles. He closes his eyes as Mycroft sprays the last splatters all over his face, greedily trying to catch every drop, his mouth slack, his tongue darting out, licking, indulging.
When he opens both eyes it is to discover that he's on top of the blond man Moriarty has shown him before.
“Did you miss me, Molly?” Jim asks, tilting his head and giving her a faux smile not reaching his eyes. He makes an obscene gesture with his tongue, and that does seem to break the spell, as Molly takes a step back.
“Think of poor Molly. Think of the pictures I have from you with your own fist up your arse. You remember those pictures, don't you, Sherlock? Good.” Moriarty takes a step towards the stretcher, then another, reaching for Sherlock's backside, and squeezes one arsecheeck encouragingly. “Now, get the hell on with it.”
He does, though it's strenuous. His head threatens to drop forward as his neck, arms and shoulders start to hurt with the strain they are under.
“Please, I…,” Sherlock chokes, and luckily John catches on and turns the tab. Ice-cold water hits Sherlock’s body, and the instant shock is enough to pull him back from the edge. Still, he feels almost dizzy, the sensations of lust, pain and humiliation mixing as he descents deep into subspace.
He's told to lie on his side, facing the wall. Toby's hand stays on his middle, positioning him. As the gloved fingers, apparently by accident, brush over Sherlock's iliac crest, however, John steps up behind Toby and says in a low voice: “Keep your hands to yourself, mate, or you won't be working for a while.”
“God, your mouth was made to suck cock. I want to see some guys come on your face after you sucked them off while I fuck your arse.”
Oh god, Sherlock thinks. Not Molly. Not Molly Hooper. He won't get it up. And even if he would, that is just too...
When the dildo is fully seated, Mark waits a little to adjust to the stretch, grinding his hips in small circles. Sherlock can't see his face but there’s no discomfort showing in the arch of his spine. The teeth of the zipper brush against Sherlock's sweaty face, leaving angry marks.
John steps right into his personal space, grabs his chin between thumb and forefinger and tells him: “Get into the bedroom, strip and kneel.”
John takes Sherlock back down and puts him to bed, despite just being early evening. When he wraps himself around Sherlock, still fully clothed, Sherlock shudders in pain, yet stays perfectly still otherwise. John is just holding him close while whispering into his ear: “Do you know another fantasy of mine? You are in hospital, some mental institution I think, shackled to the bed. You are wired with an IV drip and a bladder catheter. Instead of the nasogastric tube a permanent gastric tube has been implanted into your abdomen. As you are always plugged, you've also got an ileostomy with an ostomy pouch attached. You would be able to breathe on your own, but I have decided that you should be intubated, to shut you up and better control you. Therefore, you have to be kept mildly sedated and given a muscle relaxant. After being kept like this for some time, you have forgotten how to breathe on your own, your muscles have subsided. You are drooling, drugged, reduced to a vegetable. Fuck meat. Because during the day, the urinary catheter gets removed and is replaced with a cock ring so the nurses can ride you. Perhaps you even get Viagra mixed into your meds to keep you hard all the time. That's what you are there for, to be used as the nurses wish, for their amusement. They just pop in during the day and sink down onto your cock. It's always wet, red and swollen, glistening with their cunt juices, as no one bothers to clean you up. In the evening, a doctor comes in and examines you, probing all your holes with gloved fingers and some rather large instruments, using a speculum for example. She'll insert a new catheter after extracting all sorts of samples – blood, urine, semen, saliva, skin, perhaps even faeces? But the highlight of my day is when I turn the respirator off while I wank you, nice and slow, until you are allowed to come, almost passing out due to lack of oxygen. You'd be totally dependent on me, for if I decide to turn your life support off, you can only pray that I'll let you quickly suffocate. But I don't think I would. I might continue the respiration while you slowly starve or die of thirst. And you would let me, wouldn't you?”
Suddenly, the receiver is deep inside him. As Greg allows Sherlock to remove his hands, his stretched hole slowly closes around the twisted cord.
“Thank you.” He whispers, just glad that at least this part of his punishment is over. “Thank you for cleaning me. Please, let me suck the toilet brush.”
“We'll lie down a bit. But we won't leave you alone. If you can't endure this anymore, just stamp your feet. We'll free you anytime you want.”
Sherlock, still kneeling, shoves his trousers down to mid-thigh and his cock springs free as he didn't bother with pants today. John gives it a few light strokes that have Sherlock shiver, goosebumps breaking out on his exposed flesh.
Sherlock just stares at his brother, assessing him. Has he just shown his hand? As they both stay quiet and don't spring to the provocation, Mycroft continues somewhat calmer.
Sherlock wants this to be over quickly and therefore pushes the needle through his upper lip as well. After about three stitches, however, his vision blurs due to tears of pain springing to his eyes. He has to wipe them away with the back of his hand and wait a little before he's able to continue. Blood starts to drip from his chin into the sink, shocking bright red splashes on the white porcelain. Sherlock forces himself to look at the mirror again and get on with the task at hand. The feeling of the needle scraping against his front teeth sends a shiver down his spine.
Mycroft frowns. “Listen, John, circumstances have arisen that call for an alliance with Belarus. Those men belong to a... trade delegation.” Mycroft coughs to indicate that their occupation has nothing to do whatsoever with commerce. “We need them. And they asked for a special treat. So I have to give it to them. It's in the interest of national security.”
When the glass is empty Sherlock puts it on the table. He can't look into John's face, he's too ashamed.
Sherlock is allowed to stay the night. John holds him close, strokes his back, his hair, and whispers sweet nothings into his skin until they both fall asleep.
Sherlock wants to nod but John still firmly holds his face in place, so he licks his lips and answers “Yes, John.”
And John does stop, even pulls Sherlock up onto his feet, staring at him in disappointment and disgust.
“Let’s see what he can take.” Mycroft is rolling up his sleeves and pulls the nitrile gloves back on again. After slicking his right hand up, Sherlock can feel all his five fingers nudging at his entrance. They slide in surprisingly easy until the third knuckle. Mycroft pauses, twists his hand once, twice, before pushing past Sherlock's sphincter. Sherlock bites down onto his gag as he stares down his body to watch his rim close around his brother's wrist. John groans next to him and starts to palm himself through his jeans.
“Y-yes, Mycroft...” Sherlock moans, because Greg is again caressing his rim with two fingers of his free hand.
“Nice.” It must have been Irene. Then the toy is moved, pulled and twisted, and Sherlock mimics the movements with his mouth and tongue. Kate is writhing in the chair, pressing her wet cunt against Sherlock face but just as he can feel her clenching and shuddering his head is pulled away.
By now the fourth man can push easily inside Sherlock's willing body. The man leans back and is half lying on the kitchen floor, letting Sherlock ride his stiff cock while the others cheer, pull Sherlock's hair to slap his face and call him come dump, fucktoy and greedy slut. Sherlock's erection juts out in front of him, neglected and dripping wet, but he knows better than to expect to have it taken care of. He's just a hole, after all, made to pleasure others. He bobs up and down on the cock inside him until his eyes roll back in his head and his voice breaks. He yearns to get his mouth stuffed with some cock but doesn't dare to ask for it. If John wants him to, he'll tell him.
“Let me… so lovely, Sherlock, gorgeous. You are amazing. Good, look at you. You held on for so long until you finally passed out. I literally saw your eyes roll back.” He whispers, pressing open mouthed kisses down the side of Sherlock’s aching neck.
Sherlock shudders and writhes on the table. His balls are pulled tight against his body, the cloth pins causing a sharp pain on that sensitive spot.
By the end of the week, a friend of a friend of Alex - one of the girls Sherlock shared with - was looking for someone to rent her apartment while she went away on a student exchange to Singapore for three months. It was quickly agreed that Sven would be the right person. He paid for the duration in advance and, just like that, became the subtenant of a two bedroom flat in Friedrichshain.
“John. Sherlock.” Sherlock's mother replies, not so much as a greeting but just as an acknowledgement of their presence.
“Patience, Sherlock.” But John's voice is betraying him, giving away how affected he is. No wonder, regarding the sight in front of him.
When he comes round again, he's in John's arms, who struggles to pull him upright. Something sticky cools on his back and the belt is still loosely wrapped around his throat. Sherlock tries to entangle himself from John, who only hugs him tighter, shushing his weak protests with low words mumbled into his ear.
Sherlock gently massages John's sack while his other hand plays teasingly with his foreskin. He watches mesmerised as John's swollen, glistening cockhead pushes out of his fist again and again. John can see the longing on Sherlock's face, but his lip is still split open and his left eye and cheekbone are badly bruised. As much as John wants to push his cock inside this impossibly beautiful mouth, it'll have to wait.
Sherlock has to kneel beside the sofa while John eats, but is occasionally fed a bite of chicken or rice. When John's finished, he first clears the table, before bringing some rubber bands back from the kitchen, as well as a long soft hemp rope.
The woman who opens the door has flaming red hair and wears some kind of tasteful 1940s styled dress in black and white, rather formal but not a uniform. They are shown into a stylishly furnished sitting room – not some kind of dark torture chamber as Sherlock has expected but a bright room with comfortable sofas, low tables and abstract pictures on the wall.
There are pics of Sherlock all over the web. Some are manips, made to show him looking thin, ill, spaced out, slightly degenerated. In one he's with Irene, not giving her name but describing her as a 'notorious bawd' – insinuating either that Sherlock used her services or is somehow employed by her. There are some snapshots with Molly, asking if she's one of Sherlock's flings, his therapist or even his secret wife – depending on the stance the article takes on the whole issue. Some show him with members of his homeless network, and are used to illustrate his ostensible social relegation by insincerely commiserating him. Not only Kitty Riley's article features shots of Sherlock with a group of young men, snorting coke. On almost every site, on every front page, is a somewhat grainy pic of a haggard Sherlock in his black hoodie, crouching over a table on which treacherous white lines are clearly visible.
They stays like this, unmoving, for a few seconds until  Sherlock has adjusted his breathing. As John feels his throat relax he starts to pound into Sherlock’s mouth, brutally fucking his face.
Sherlock had been getting a bit too loose for his liking anyway. Those huge plugs they'd been using had stretched tremendously, almost past endurance. It had looked gorgeous but the friction John so loved had been gone. Time to tighten Sherlock's anus. John's a surgeon after all.
“God, I'm going to fuck you so hard.” John murmurs as he lowers his face to Sherlock's crotch and starts to mouth and suck on his satin covered erection until the fabric is wet with his saliva. Then he leans back, and the fingers playing with Sherlock's balls wander further back, slipping beneath the satin to rub on Sherlock's cleft. They quickly find Sherlock's hole and push easily in.
But when John removes the weight and twine from Sherlock's balls, his shrill scream breaks the peaceful quiet of the darkened park. An bird flies up nearby, startled. Sherlock whines, tears shooting up into his still blindfolded eyes.
“...because I'm such a horny slut, I need the stretch, I need to get cleaned out, and you are such a good doctor...”
They'd entered the vast gardens an hour before closing time, strolling south and then west, down the Viotollone, lined with laurel hedges and old cypress trees. But instead of proceeding towards the Isolotto as most tourist did, John had steered them into the wilderness that stretched to the left of the broad walkway.
“Oh, my god...”, she huffs, pressing both hands to her mouth as she takes in the scene in front of her.
Sherlock has to bow down to remove the vibrator himself. The emptiness is at the same time bliss and loss. Sherlock's overstimulated body has no idea how to deal with this. He suddenly feels just drained and tired. His eyes keep fluttering shut as he drifts in and out of what feels like a minor apoplectic stroke. Only some sensations seem to filter through to him.
The toothbrush feels interesting because of its shape. Its girth widens at the grip; having this inserted inside his very tight urethra is a challenge. But Sherlock manages it after a while. John admires the display, only the head of the toothbrush protruding from the glans. He relishes the sight, stroking Sherlock's spread inner thighs and flicking the clothes pins there until Sherlock's hips buck and twitch while he keens behind his gag.
Sherlock had done as he'd been told, clambering shakily about on all four, skittering like a newborn foal, his hard cock and full bollocks hanging heavy between his legs. In their kitchen, he'd taken one of the Ali Miller teacups form the shelves, suppressing the urge to stroke himself or rub against the furniture to take the edge off his arousal. He had to do what John told him. He could trust John. It had suddenly been so very easy to give himself up. His head had felt light, his mind had been clear. He'd been... content. Save. Happy.
First, he offers Sherlock a spoonful of Tramadol to get him to relax. Sherlock swallows it without hesitation.
“Ok, get up now and bent over.” John's voice is smooth and dark. Sherlock gets to his feet and leans over the table until his upper body is flush against the cool table top. He's glad to be able to hide his burning face.
John's gloved fingers start stroking Sherlock's back, moving over welts and split skin, probing and pressing. It hurts – god, it hurts! But John doesn't stop when Sherlock groans in agony. He just fists Sherlock's curls and mumbles in Sherlock's ear. “I said, be quiet. Just take it. You are mine to do as I please, remember?”
“Mycroft is getting a little bit impatient by now. Irene phoned him and reported your session. Afterwards, Mycroft had a rent boy come over, and it got a bit out of hand – so to speak.” Greg smirks. “We had to tie that whore down in the end. You know, Mycroft doesn't like that very much. He wants them ready and gagging for it, not crying and spluttering 'Uh, that hurts, nonono...” Greg imitates a camp high whine and both men laugh. “One of Mycroft's minions had to take that slut to his discreet private clinic afterwards. Not so much because of the fisting but because of the beating. Mycroft was... agitated. Got pretty nasty. The cane he uses is quite fierce. That boy passed out several times during the session. Even bled on the upholstery of the car. Mycroft was not amused. That boy won't work for some time in the future. Luckily, Mycroft had something on his pimp to shut him up from complaining, otherwise...” Greg shrugs, all the while caressing Sherlock's open anus.
This takes ages. John now and then adds some more come from the glass as they both stretch Sherlock's arsehole beyond what he'd thought physically manageable. Only when Sherlock's knees start to buckle does John have mercy and removes both their fingers. As Sherlock moans at the sudden emptiness John takes another hemp rope and ties Sherlock's wrists behind his back. He works quickly and in a few moments has Sherlock's lower arms bound together up to his elbows.
John massages his tummy for the next half hour, sitting on the rim of the tub. Sherlock is openly crying again as cramps set his body spasming. He needs to empty himself, he’s so full, but the plug prevents it. His bowels still feel on fire. To add to his agony, John strokes his cock from time to time. Due to the cock ring, he’s still so very hard despite the humiliation he has to endure.
he thinks. John's sure that he won't have to answer for it in front of Mycroft's friends. He'll explain later. Or will he? Does Mycroft have to know everything he and Sherlock did while he was absent? After all, he didn't warn John that he'd invited company.
Eventually, the hot water is turned off and both men grab a towel. But not Sherlock; he’s left dripping wet, kneeling on the tiles. Soon, he starts to shiver.
“Fuck me, John. Please, fuck me.” He pleads, raw and hoarse, flayed, his core laid open. John instantly drops the knife, unbuttons his jeans and pulls them down to mid-thigh. As his stiff cock springs free, he takes the lube and slicks himself up.
They start slowly: when John is watching telly, reading or working on his laptop, Sherlock is swaddled inside the bag, blindfolded and pushed under the bed. John checks on him every 30 minutes. Sherlock's not gagged, so he could call for help if need be and John makes sure he drinks enough during those sessions to stay hydrated. Afterwards, he looks him over, measuring his blood pressure and massaging his limbs to ensure circulation.
"Cool! I can show them all the animals, because I know a lot about animals, I know that elephants have a really good memory and if you're mean to them, they'll remember that like 20 years later too! And I know that some snakes bite and other's squish their prey and I know that kangaroos carry their babies in a bag on their belly and sometimes the babies look out of the bag and I can teach them a lot about bees!" she said and Sherlock chuckled, "Well, I'm sure they'll be glad to have a teacher like you, sweetheart. They're smarter than normal kids their age as well, you know." he explained, "And you know what, they're John's cousins, but my sisters." he said and smiled, "That's because long after I was born, my mummy fell in love with John's uncle." he said and Rosie frowned, "What about your daddy?" she asked and Sherlock smiled, "Well, my daddy went to heaven a really long time ago." he said and quickly changed the subject again, not wanting Rosie to get sad over her parents again, "But you know who my mummy is?” he asked and chuckled, "It's Violet, you know her, don't you?" he asked and Rosie nodded, "I do! She's really super nice!"
"Oh come /on/." Charlie snorted after looking at him for two seconds. "I wasn't being /that/ obvious about it. He's awesome, though, so thanks for asking." She said and sat down next to him.
"Not that I used to be a big fan of those.." Sherlock chuckled, "But I suppose you don't appreciate some things until they're gone " he said and smiled again, still glad that his mother really was here.
"I'll do it in the morning, for now, we all need some sleep." Sherlock said and took the empty glass from Charlie, before he took her pillow (maybe they should just start to have spare pillows in their bedroom, really).
"Thanks, love" John said with a smile, before Charlie came back up to them. "What do you think of that one?" She asked with a smile, wearing a sparkly silver shoe. "Yeah, I like that on you. And it's almost as sparkly as your personality" He said and gave her a smile, which caused a grin to tug on the corners of Charlie's mouth.
"I think I'll have a nice pizza; after yours I'm actually convinced all the other ones have to be worse." John said with a warm chuckle, giving Sherlock's hand under the table a squeeze.. "Erm, is it okay, if I eat a tiramisu?" Charlie asked after a moment, unsure if that was maybe bad etiquette or too unhealthy or something.
Sherlock chuckled, "I really didn't..." he said and shook his head, now feeling incredibly stupid about being so anxious about this. "I hardly doubt running after you in panic counts as really well..."
John came a bit closer, before wrapping an arm around Sherlock from behind and laying his hand carefully on Rosie's back. "Hey, don't leave me out." He commented with a smile, resting his chin on his boyfriend's shoulder.
Sherlock chuckled at Richard's expression, "You've been together for /two days/ and you're already planning to get married?" Rich asked and Sherlock chuckled once again, "Seems fast I know.. but.. well, it feels right and I'll go with the latter." he said and smiled at John, once again having one of those moments where he just got lost in watching him. "Good god, you guys are like watching a disney film." he said and Sherlock snapped out of his haze, smirking at Rich. "What?" Richard asked and Sherlock chuckled lightly, "You're the second person to say that to me today." Richard frowned lightly, "Really? Who was the first?" he asked and Sherlock smiled, "Your granddaughter."
"Right.." William said and ran his hands through his hair, "Are we done here then?" he asked and really was quite eager to end this therapy session, "I erm.. I promised Jim I'd show him some of my favourite books in the library."
"My point exactly. Emilia's the only other girl my age for example." Charlie said with a shrug. She didn't want to make her own life harder than it had to be by being all nerdy and stuff. "You don't get to choose your family I guess. By the way, what do you think of us? Well, the ones you've met."
"You're welcome." Ron said and smiled at her, before looking over at Rosie as she stirred and slowly opened her eyes, coughing a little, "Hi Ron.." she said and gaped when she spotted the little stuffed bee next to her, "Woah.. is that for me?" she asked, looking back and forth between Charlie and Ron.
"He's actually just a few years older than you.." Sherlock said and couldn't stop smiling, Mycroft could tell himself as much as he wanted that he was just curious (because he was sure that's what he was trying to do), but the way Mycroft had looked at Greg had been disturbingly similar to the way Charlie looked at Lowell.
Sherlock sighed, "Our mother forced us to.." he said and rolled his eyes again (at that rate, his eyes would probably actually hurt from all the eye-rolling in the evening). "Anyway, do you know if Dorothy is in her office? I was actually hoping to catch her since my brother here wanted to offer help fund some afternoon activities for the kids and find instructors for them, he even generously offered to hold a regular class on how to deal with paperwork issues and building up a believable background once they have to change identities. Isn't that nice of him?" he asked with a smirk. Even if he was still a bit disturbed by what ever was going on between Mycroft and Greg, he didn't see a reason not to use to further his plans.
"Yeah, I could see that. I'm really glad you two get along by the way. And about the couple evening" He started, not looking like he was going to dismiss the idea, before teasing. "I think that would only be complete with Mycroft and whoever he is seeing, don't you think?"
The rest of the morning passed uneventful, mainly because John went out soon, leaving Sherlock with the usual anxiety he had when he wasn't with John, though something had taken the edge off of it, making him less panicky about it. Perhaps the fact that he had actually talked about it with his mum and John made it better. Richard had agreed to come around later in the morning, so that left some time for Sherlock to go out and buy some paint and wallpaper.
"Okay.." Sherlock said and smiled at her, "Thank you." he said and sighed a little, before smiling a little again, "And don't forget about our deal, you take care of your actual grades, okay?" he asked.
''Yeah." Charlie nodded and followed Sherlock out the door. "So where are we meeting John?" She asked looking up.
"It isn't even so much the fact that you haven't decided yet.." Sherlock said and rested his forehead against John's, "The fact that you said you wouldn't want me to save you in case something would happen to you in service.. and.. that you don't want me to be there with you.. " he sighed, "It just.. hurt."
"I don't know..." Sherlock said, putting a hand on Charlie's shoulder, "But we're gonna find that bastard. As hard as it sounds, the fact that this Timothy boy just arrived is actually rather lucky, I could probably find a way to get his case file and possibly even yours and Rosie's, the police must have been involved in each case."
"It's on march first!" Rosie said and smiled, "And I was born in 2013!" she added with a grin, "Well then mark that in your calendar, just like July 27th which is Charlie's birthday." Sherlock said with a smile.
Rosie nodded eagerly, "Yeah! Sherlock is great! And John too! And Sherlock is really smart, he's smarter than other people too and he told me that his brother is as well and his sisters too!" she said and smiled.
Sherlock smiled, "Glad to be of use." he said and chuckled, sitting up a bit more, "The violets are nice.." he said and reached out to touch the petals, "They're nearly the same shade as the ones I have upstairs.. was that intentional?"
A few people chuckle at the indirect mention of John and Sherlock being together, much to John’s annoyance.
"To much to count, but that's Sherlock for you," John replied, a bit of annyoance lacing his voice as he remembered all the times he's supposed partener in crime left him.
"Is it bad that the first thing I thought of was if a tree falls in the woods with no one around, does it make a sound?" Anderson randomly asks.
"No wonder Sherlock is always so annoyed at us, between the scene with the words and this, if the cases aren't made up, then how isn't he snapping at every word they say?" Anderson exclaimed, though John did glare slightly at the middle part.
"Definetely better than I would have guessed," Molly murmured. She knew that she didn't have a lot of experience in that thing, but even she thought it was a good guess.
"Seriously? You have a gun pointed to your head and your calling it dull?" Lestrade comments, and the others, excluding Donovan and Mycroft, chuckle slightly at him. As that was Sherlock for you.
"Yeah this is just before I met Sherlock," John muttered and Molly, Lestrade and Mrs Hudson gave him a small pitying look. John adverted his eyes and shuffled awkwardly before looking back at the screen.
Molly and Mrs Hudson huffs in sadness when they notice the grimace. How could anyone be that mean to their own brother?
Most of the people sighed at seeing the enthusiasm dying in Sherlock’s eyes. This being the first time they had seen the usual Sherlock on screen for a while.
"I'm so confused," Anderson muttered in confusion. "Is he really talking about the rabbit from the start of this case?"
Sorry that this one is so terrible, I suck at writing confrontations and anything to do with emotions.
"Maybe she could but she just wanted to be nice to the freak," Donovan replied, disbleif filling her voice towards the end.
"Wow," Donovan whispered, shocked that they actually had anything that was decent proof. Not that she believed them of course.
"Don't you work with Sherlock?" Kitty questioned, "you're solving cases with the Police often enough, isn't that a job?"
"Anyone who actually knows what they are doing would always perform their own interviews," Lestrade muttered to himself. Wondering why Henry would think the Documentary would be good enough.
Clara still wasn't entirely sure if Sherlock was telling the whole truth... Mycroft and flirting together seemed like an oxymoron.. "Oh, yeah sure. Greg's a good catch, your cousin could've found someone worse." She said with a chuckle and showed her a photo of Greg together with one of the toddlers. "Yeah, he's certainly good-looking..." Clara said to Janine, before turning hack to Sherlock. "And Mycroft's seriously going out with him?"
"Okay, reality. Is Rosie still sick then?" Charlie asked and cracked her eyes open, even though the hair-stroking felt nice. "She is. I think you caught that flu from her. I'll just get you two your medicine." He said and gave her hand a warm squeeze before rising to his feet and leaving again. "Aren't you worried you'll catch my from me too?"
"Wait.. Mrs Turner?" Sherlock asked in surprise, looking at her familiar face - familiar, because she was his neighbour. "You're.. wow. Does Mrs Hudson know?" he asked, before looking at John, "Uh, John.. I don't know if you've met her.. this is Mrs Turner, she lives next door.. she's a close friend of Mrs Hudson.." he said.
Sherlock sighed, "I don't know.. probably a big confrontation on your mum's birthday isn't that much of a good idea to get into her good graces." he said and shrugged, "Now.. go on with my treat, will you, not also would I like to be reminded of what you look naked, it also wouldn't be good if we're late on her birthday." he said and smiled.
"Seriously, thank you. I don't want to think about how this would've played out if we had invited someone less honest over." John said. "Don't worry about it, of course I didn't play along." Viktor said and shook his head.
"Well.. I suppose that depends entirely on skill." Sherlock said with a chuckle as he set the bags down in the living room. "But I suppose for a hundred pounds more each, the people from Ikea would like to help out. They should be about to get off of work after delivering the furniture anyway, given by how late it is.."
"No. Victor told me a lot about your boyfriend though." Lowell said, looking at John while Sherlock grabbed three glasses and opened a bottle of wine. "He told me a lot about his brother as well.. he was crushed when he heard about your death.." he said and looked at Lowell with a frown. "Honestly, with all the confusion and unnecessary loss that could have been avoided by just being more open about the whole vampire thing, I'm nearly tempted to just tell the world about us." he said, handing John a glass of wine before he started to make a blood wine mixture for Lowell and himself.
John looked at the table at the table for a while before speaking again. "I know you love and respect me. I know you don't tell the children I'm the reason they can't have nice things and that that's not what they think. What bothered me here was that I would've liked you to talk to me about those things first." He said to break the silence. "Okay, what are you thinking?"
John kept his hand on Sherlock's back and leaned into a little his touch. He hummed into the kiss and just thought how right this felt. Being that close to Sherlock, he felt himself slowly hardening.
"What? Why not?" Sherlock asked and frowned, "If anything, it's proof." he said and shrugged a little, "I mean.. at least it's not pure..." he mumbled.
"We avoid me and if we meet Victor, we'll tell him what's going on." Sherlock said immediately, "He'll believe us." he said, knowing that was true. No matter how crazy the story, Victor knew that Sherlock would never lie to him. "He'll help us find Rosie." he said, only now feeling his pulse quicken a little at the thought of seeing Victor again, not that he still felt the exact same for him, but he still missed him and loved him, even if it wasn't in a romantic way anymore.
"Can we be friends? You're /so/ cool! Are you a real animal expert?" Amy rattled off, because really, she'd learned something from Rosie that not even /mummy/ had told them. And daddy said mummy knew almost /everything/! She looked over at her excitedly, eyes wide and Violet couldn't help chuckling fondly.
"As long as it doesn't involve Rosie and a bag of 'not paint' " John chuckled lightly, before looking back at him. "Seriously though, shoot."
"Yeah, still a bit not good. And it's a good thing that you know my dad's officially deceased but actually alive vampire father. Otherwise I'd have had to rob a bank to make my relationship seem less severe to him." John said with a bit of a huff.
Charlie chuckled at that. "Perfect. I'm already looking forward to that. Do you think John would want to join us when he's back?"
"Really? I didn't even see her. That's some-" John began with a chuckle, before being cut off by a woman opening the door. "Hello, how can I help you?"
"Yes, how about 3pm? Mr. Watson, we'll talk at a later time then. Goodbye" She said with a nod and held out her hand, which he shook. John nodded and stood up. "Yes, thank you for your time."
"No.." Rosie said and shook her head, "But I'm sure it's really pretty!" she said and tried to lift her suitcase, grimacing a little, it was a lot heavier than it looked.
John stirred, when he heard the wet coughing next to him and was awake in a matter of seconds. It took him a few seconds to realise that the noise came from the man sitting next to him. The med student rubbed his eyes and squinted sat up as well. "Jesus, Sherlock. You sound awful."
Amy frowned deeply at that speech, having quite her difficulties to follow completely. "But... if it's okay that he's stupid, why is it mean to say it? You told me to always tell the truth.."
Charlie read her text, before burying her head in her pillow. This was a nightmare... Ouch! And she would've honestly felt a bit more comforted if Sherlock hadn't forgotten her tea, but at least no one was asking her embarrassing questions or anything. Oh, she could text Amber, couldn't she? ...Yeah, she'd do that.
Sherlock raised a brow when John called the guy a descendant of Victor - which couldn't be. If there ever had been a wholeheartedly gay man, it was Victor. But the name wasn't unfamiliar. "Lowell Trevor, you say?" Sherlock asked and Lowell gave Sherlock a - he had to admit that - quote dazzling smile. Not that he was any competition for John, but he was very nice to look at. "Do you by any chance have a brother?" he asked and Lowell's smile grew brighter. "As a matter of fact, I do, yeah." Lowell said and Sherlock smiled a little, he really did look and acted exactly like Victor had told him all those years ago.
"Oh, that's really reassuring actually." Charlie said with a smile. No steady blood supply was an unnerving thought. "Then I guess Rosie and I can visit Dad together."
"No, I didn't. Is someone at the door?" John called back, leaning over the table to look at Sherlock. Charlie meanwhile chewed her bottom lip and glanced up at Sherlock, before turning to Rosie. "Let's see if John can teach us something while Sherlock is at the door." She told her and took her hand to get her subtly out of the living room.
"Fine, I can't argue with that I suppose." He said and thought for a moment, still sure that Sherlock wouldn't get to make more than a first impression anyway. It was frustrating to think about, so he decided to just let it go for now. "Maybe put on some jeans, a tshirt and a pair of trainers. He has no respect for politicians, art of any kind really, even music, or things like that... maybe just don't bring those topics up."
"It's a good thing you're sure about that, otherwise marriage might not be the best call for us." John said and huffed a laugh. "At the very least it'd feel like that to me. I'm as sure about us as can be, but there are some things I feel we need to do as slowly as other people. At least kind of."
John nodded at that glad they were fine. However, after his fiancé's words had sunk in, his eyes suddenly widened with dread at the sudden realisation. "Sherlock, we left Rosie in an open flat."
"Don't be unfair, there are some people that are loyal and think of rules more like.. loose guidelines.." Sherlock said with a laugh.
Sherlock smiled and nodded, "We'll be right back." he said only briefly looking at John before he looked back at Clara, "Right then.. let's go." he said and walked out of the room, leading the way for Clara.
"I already know you'll do great" Charlie said with a chuckle. "Could you style my hair the way you did 200 years ago?" She asked him with a smile. "I never wear my hair like that and it looked so pretty"
"Well.. it's completely up to you, of course. I just wanted you to know that you do have that option.. what with six vampires in the family, possibly seven even, it might be worth to seriously consider it." Richard said and frowned, "Sorry if that came off as pushing you to do it. I didn't mean it that way."
"Well.. no." Sherlock said and frowned, sitting down in John's armchair across from Charlie, "I don't know, it's not like it was their fault, I just didn't have the guts to go to people and show them what I'm really like. Which was made especially difficult since being homosexual was an actual crime, people went to prison for that. So of course there was that, holding me back, not just social pressure."
“Yeah, kind of. But as his cousin I can tell you he's a good guy." John said with a shrug. "I don't exactly love his parents if you could tell, but he's alright really."
Sherlock had forced himself to sit down in the kitchen with his glass, pointedly not looking at his phone as he nipped at his glass, his leg bobbing nervously. He was still not sure if this was just an altered version of his dream. But at least he would know, so it couldn't surprise him.
"You're a really cute couple, you know?" Charlie said with a chuckle. "I hope someday I'll find someone who I can make me just as happy as John does you."
"We could replace the inside of a pie with chocolate cake." Charlie giggled after a moment and took Ron's hand as they began to walk down Baker Street. She felt so light when she was with him...
"Got it" John nodded and followed close behind, his heart thudding loudly. // This was it, she'd almost reached the living room, where the film was still rolling. One more flight and she'd be with Charlotte...
"You look suspiciously happy." Sherlock said with a small frown, handing John a cup of water, with all the blood talk they had forgot that John had to eat and drink too. "Sorry, I was so distracted with Rosie and getting something to drink for them that I forgot that not all of us live on blood." he mumbled and pecked John's cheek.
A while later John felt.. better. Still like shit, mind you, but not on the brink of death anymore. Slowly, he moved a bit (and quickly stopped since his limbs hurt), before opening his eyes again and looking up. "Hey" He breathed, incredibly comforted to see his fiancé.
"Yeah, Mrs Hudson had so many pretty dresses! I didn't even know which one to pick! But this is the prettiest, look!" Rosie said and turned around a few times and Sherlock quickly halted her, taking the cup from her hands, "Rosie, love, what is our rule? Don't move to fast when you're holding a glass or cup with tomato juice. It's really hard to get those stains out of clothes, especially white ones." And he really didn't want to have to explain blood stains on the dress of a little girl to anyone.
Charlie smiled at that, quite relieved actually. "Good, thanks. Seeing that bloke again really freaked me out a bit." She said with a shudder and looked over at him.
Sherlock nodded and already started to walk towards the stairs to check Rosie's room, basically running up the stairs and pulling the door to her room open only to be disappointed, finding her room empty. "No, no no no.." he murmured, checking Charlie's room too just to make sure Rosie hadn't sneaked in after Charlie got up, but Rosie wasn't there either. Not wasting any time, he made his way back down the stairs.
"...Are you being serious right now?" Charlie asked him wide-eyed... Sherlock definitely didn't have to tell her that that was a big responsibility, she was pretty aware of that. Though she did want to know what his and John's conversation tonight would look light. "You really trust me that much?"
Charlie began to walk with Jane back to her cottage. "Jane, can I ask you a question? Is the older Sherlock very different from your young one?"
"Hm.. maybe it's really just that we have experience with kids that are too smart for their age." Sherlock said and chuckled a little, "Or maybe she senses that I was one of those kids too." he said and smiled, "She's great, though. Really. It feels wrong that she's apparently so.. lonely. Even if it's a chosen loneliness because no one knows how to handle her.."
"Good call." Paul said and walked up to the girls on the sofa. "Hello Rosie, hello Charlie." He said and opened his bag. "Hi Paul" Charlie croaked and watched him. "Sherlock called me last night and told me you two were sick, so I thought I'd have a look at you. Is that okay?" He asked and Charlie nodded.
Sherlock gave a breathless laugh, clearing his throat, smiling stupidly, "Me too.." he said as he cuddled up to John, feeling a little cold with the sudden lack of John's body warmth. "By the way.. lubricant is a very.. very.. /very/ good invention." he said and laughed again.
"Well.. I wouldn't consider whatever's happening with those kids 'being adopted for real'. Even if they pretend to be a family, or whatever those sickos do, I hardly doubt they'd want to stay with the people who murdered their parents." Sherlock said with frown.
"Yeah, me too. But he really does seem nice. I mean how many kids do you know that still offer to help their elderly neighbour carry home their shopping bags?" Sherlock asked and chuckled a little.
Sherlock huffed a laugh at that, "Ah so that's on the list of reasons you like me? Probably better not mention that in your vows or your speech for that matter." he smirked.
"That'd probably be best. And I think, Rosie will now own every available toy or item of clothing with bees on it." John chuckled and followed him outside. "I hope you haven't deduced my present for you yet. I've been looking forward to surprising you for once."
"Yeah... and it's just five minutes walking distance from here. "And the they've got their own tech club that takes care of the computer maintenance..." Charlie added after a moment. "And a rugby club."
"Okay." Rosie said and took off her pyjama top, "Okay where?" she asked, already putting the eartips into her ears.  "Whoa.. it's really loud when I touch it!" she said fiddling with the metal knob.
"Okay, I see. And what other things did you want to get or teach her?" John asked him after a moment.
John exhaled slowly and shook his head. "Stop me, if I try to attack him later on. Or on second thought, maybe don't."
"Well, there's a reason I prefer painting.." Violet joked with a chuckle. "Maybe just tell me beforehand which pieces you've got. I'd like to hear most of them again myself, you know." She told Sherlock with a mile. In truth she really just didn't want to be surprised by a tune she'd written after William's or Eurus's death.
Rosie looked with wide eyes at the entrance of the zoo, actually gaping, "I didn't think it's so big!" she said and Sherlock chuckled, "Have you ever been to the zoo Rosie?" he asked and the girl shook her head, "No, I've only seen a few zoos on TV and they didn't look so big!"
"Well done Anderson, you exceeded my expectations," Mycroft commented randomly, but Anderson did look slightly proud at his words. "Your not as stupid as you seemed," Anderson immediantly frowned after Mycroft finished speaking.
"He actually sounds like a normal human," Donovan's voice is filled with shock as she speaks. Her words cause John's fingers to curl into a fist and it took everything to not punch her.
"This mysterious thing, teleported us, it is only natural it should be able to teleport us back, a better question would have been if we would remember what happened here?" Mycroft retorted, causing Anderson to glare at him.
"WHAT!" Molly cried in outrage. But she was the only one who was shocked, as Mycroft, was well Mycroft, John and Mrs Hudson trusted Sherlock and the yarders mostly Lestrade had noitced it.
“Forget protection, I’m gonna kill you for messing with Sherlock,” John growled in annoyance, his eyes narrowing.
“I’m tougher than I look,” Mrs Hudson responded, smiling slightly that Sherlock wanted her around so badly.
Mrs Hudson can't help but sigh Sherlock's name. Even though she wasn't surprised, she still hoped that the boy wouldn't be so causual around a muderer.
"I don't understand, if she was being comparative why couldn't she just say the name, instead of just saying he?" Mrs Hudson tuts. "It's not like Sherlock wasn't going to ask,"
