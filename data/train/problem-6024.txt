They both throw their heads back in laughter, “We should head back to work now.” Steve stands up, keeping Tony in his arms, he gently lowers them so Tony can stand. “I’ll get your stuff.” The man heads towards their bedroom, grabbing his own jacket as well as the many things Tony carries around.
Empty schedules? Check. Avengers other than Cap and himself on emergency duty? Check. Late lunch reservation? Check. He had even informed Pep about clearing his corporate duties this time.
And then he thinks, maybe, maybe it really could. Yup, this is definitely going to be the best way of testing the waters. Steve is a genius.
He stepped out, rumpled and still bleary with an orgazm blush on his cheeks and walked a couple blocks before he hailed a cab. Cold evening air crept down his collar. He checked his phone but he had no notifications. That’s normal, Tony tried to reassure himself, not like him to pester after calling once anyway. Still, everything felt like an omen. Inside of the taxi smelled like dust and stale smoke. He buried his nose into his own collar to breathe in the lingering aroma of Steve’s flat.
Steve wasn’t mooning. He definitely refused to accept that he was moping. But Tony was literally right there and he could see Steve looking at the gauges the goat had made in the salt lamp longingly so really, he didn’t need Steve to accept it. He wanted a goat.
Tony lifted it from one side gingerly. Under the mattress was slightly dampened from use, without a bed base to allow air circulation. There were patches of black rubbed off on the off white exterior, especially on the sides. Dust? Soot? Charcoal? Something else? Tony couldn’t be sure.
"I completely understand," Tony assured them, and was pushed carefully into a seat. Alive. In tact. Without any broken bones. Wow, this was a lot scarier than he remembered. It had been a minute or two since he'd had the shovel talk.
No one really knew this though. Tony wasn't going to just bring it up in random conversation. Instead he'd made every excuse as to why he thought this camping trip was a bad idea, but in the end everyone had agreed that it definitely wasn't and Tony either had to go along or admit something was wrong.
"I don't have time for your sass right now, Steve wants me to go out to the bar with him and his best friend," Tony hissed, flailing his arms like a madman. "He just called me and I swear to god he tricked me into it because one second he's asking how my day was and what I'm doing, and I told him nothing honestly and he goes good, then lets go get some drinks with my pal and I had no time at all to come up with a proper excuse and... and..!"
"Steven, you're really killing my boner right now," Tony told him firmly. "Of course I want to. If you're having second thoughts, though, you can head right back inside. I won't be upset, I'll still hide in your apartment whenever I want to."
"Is that what this is about? You missed me?" And the way his lips twisted up into a smile had Tony's eyes narrowing because damn him. And he was about to give in, this was all about to go so well when suddenly Steve was pushing off of the wall, coming over for what Tony was sure was a kiss, and Tony moved to brace himself against the table behind him and-
“Good. This’s gonna be a habit, Stevie. You just wait. You’ll be beggin’ for it this time next week.”
For a moment they just looked at each other, and then Steve laughed, and Tony laughed, and suddenly they were holding each other by the back of the neck in hysterics. It must look ridiculous to anyone else (except maybe the team who thought this was a long time coming) but there was a strange understanding between them in that moment. Then they were kissing again, this time short, sweet pecks, and slowly floating back down from the clouds and back to reality.
"I could probably open an amusement park," Tony said suddenly, and Steve could see the light in his eyes. Oh boy, if he didn't derail that fast Tony was going to board the jet and leave them all here on this beach. "Come on, think about it, Stark Land. No, no. Stark World. Wait, what about Avengers Island? I could profit off of us, right, that's not weird? Themed rides, little Iron Man toys as prizes for games-"
"I think they said something about a team-sized banana split for desert," he offered innocently, and he didn't stop Tony- or his cackling- as the genius fled to the kitchen.
“He sure does,” Tony replied, cocking his hip off to the side and letting his hand rest on it. “Take it that’s what you want? Coffee to go with? Milk?” Tony was a big fan of that cake himself, though the way Bucky lit up when he confirmed it was available, you’d have thought it was the best cake in the whole damn world.
"Steven Rogers do not fucking finish that sentence," Tony hissed, pushing Dum-E aside as he tried to sweep up the pieces. No, maybe it was.. fixable, maybe it could just.. Okay no, this thing was garbage now. Days without sleep for nothing, and the reason was reaching for his shoulder. Tony turned on Steve in an instant. "Why the fuck did you think it was a good idea to come barging in here when you knew I was probably-"
"Oh?" Steve replied, and the surprise had Rhodey and Clint boring holes into Tony's skull. Caught. He'd been caught.
Tony wandered back out to find Steve staring at the spot where Bucky would usually sit. It was difficult to watch. The entire thing was hard, and Tony wasn't even the one who had theoretically lost someone. Steve had his hands on the menu, but it was closed, and Tony hummed before making up his mind. He walked over and sat down on the edge of the seat next to Steve, startling him and bumping him with his hip until he got the message and moved over. Steve didn't smile, but he looked a little less lost, and Tony would take that.
"Oh yeah? Are you gonna show me how to build a proper sand castle? Can you even build things without a wrench and a torch?"
They spent the most of the night there. Eventually Tony fell asleep, and Steve had no qualms with carrying him back to the tent. Once they were curled against the air mattress Steve pressed his lips to the back of Tony's neck, trailing along his shoulder.
Tony's head shot up, eyes centering in on him in a second. Part of him wanted to rejoice because of course he'd missed his best-friend-boyfriend while he was gone. But Tony was a complex creature, so rather than going with what most of him wanted he listened to that tiny voice in the back of his head demanding he holler at him.
"Now that that parts over with, why don't we do a-" Bucky paused, obviously catching himself. "High five. We should do a high five." Since he'd probably made Tony uncomfortable with the almost-shot-offer, he promptly held up his prostetic arm, and Tony struggled to keep a straight face as he took the man up on the offer.
"Pepperoni is fine," Steve cut in, dropping his keys on the table and trying not to offer a fond smile. He wasn't fond. Break in, remember? Seriously, Steve, priorities. "Is this gonna be a habit Tony?" He tried, absolutely battled, to keep his voice stern but even he knew that there was a sparkle to his eyes, and he was pretty damn sure Tony took note of it as the man stared at him. Within seconds they were both laughing, and Steve was plopping down on the couch and grabbing a slice from the box on the coffee table.
"We're open," Tony said, instead of asking. It was lame and stupid and he was pretty sure at this point that Steve knew they were open, but he had to- He didn't know what else to say. "You can't just stand out front and not come in. It's bad for business if I let you do that, and I'm already in hot water for very accidentally telling a customer to fuck off last week."
After a few minutes Tony dropped his grip on Steve’s neck, instead bracing against the mirror. The new angle was just fine for the action of it all, but Steve found it hard to catch a good look at Tony this way. The soldier leaned forward, draping himself over Tony, surprised to see that Tony had ground himself against the mirror. The genius had his forehead pressed against it, choking out moans as Steve continued to press on without any sign of stopping.
"You break into my house multiple times, I don't get to know your middle name, and now you want me to tell you what I do for a living?" When Steve put it that way, Tony absolutely had to see his point. "I figured you'd have that all sorted out by now. What do you do to entertain yourself if you're not snooping around?"
Tony wasn't sure how they got out of their pants, but he did know that his back was against the mattress and everything was bare. He was hard and ready, and Steve.. fuck, Steve was hung, and he was gripping himself. Tony licked his lips, but Steve just shook his head. Apparently he had the same sentiment Tony did. Fuck now, explore later. Steve sucked at Tony's throat, and Tony muttered some jumbled words about the nightstand. Before long, a lubed up finger was pressing inside of Tony. If they were younger, if he was some love drunk teenager, that might have been enough to help him come apart. Instead it caused Tony to draw Steve up to his lips by his chin, fixing the man with a filthy kiss that demanded more. More fingers, more speed. Anything to get them to the point.
The elevator had never been so silent. Steve had nothing to focus on but the disappointment of letting himself hope when he should have known better. He stepped up to his apartment door, grasped the handle so he could put the key in and.. It turned. Unlocked. Steve stood still for a moment, licking dry lips, thinking hard. Suddenly, he threw the door open.
He stood suddenly. "I've got to.. uh.. I'll be back." Yep. He had something very, very important to do. Something that couldn't wait. Something-
"He's not-" Steve groaned, rubbing his temples. "Tony and I aren't a thing. Sam likes to joke, that's all." At Bucky's snort, Steve put his hands on his hips. "That's all! Seriously. He's just a really good friend. He lives upstairs. He uh.. he broke into my apartment and-"
"Did you have to wear layers?" Steve huffed, and Tony laughed, helping Steve to help him out of his jacket. As Tony reached for his tie, Steve shook his head. "Keep it," he told him firmly. "I can use it to put you right where I want you." And fuck if that didn't go right to Tony's dick. He was nodding eagerly, as though Steve had asked him a question, and slipped right out of his shirt as Steve got the last button out. He paused, realizing that Steve hadn't seen him without a shirt, and he knew the exact moment when Steve finally caught sight of the scar.
"Tony?" Steve's voice was full of worry as Tony shot up from his seat and abruptly walked away from the group. Looks were exchanged around the fire. Steve didn't wait for anyone else to volunteer; he'd find out what was wrong with the man.
Everything was fine until Steve had his hand down his pants and Tony caught sight of his eyes reflected, and then he was moaning and leaning forward to ground himself against the mirror. Steve paused, and in the glass Tony could see Steve eyeing him curiously. Tony’s cheeks burned, trying to think of how to explain this one. Steve was trying, very admirably, to adjust to Tony’s kinks. Tony wasn’t sure he was ready for this one.
"Hm? Yeah, because we didn't all just sit on our asses for a whole two hour flight," Tony teased, depositing the three he'd grabbed in the sand and beginning to unfold them.
"If I see you even sip someone else's beer, I will shame you in front of the entire bar," Bruce told Tony firmly. "And then, I'll make you wear the hat."
“Please, please, please tell me old man MacKinnon still makes the meanest Irish Cream Cake you ever bit into.” This one, Bucky he’d later learn, was the first to make Tony laugh. Steve was funny too, had his charm, but
"You were never a-" Clint began, but all at once Tony's face was lighting up. Clint didn't even bother finishing. Tony was shooting past the group and straight towards Steve. Steve who was smiling. Steve who was laughing. Steve who's muscles were twitching with the laughter, who's eyes were just as touched by the smile as his dimples were, who-
"Almost," Steve confirmed. He slammed forward, as deep as he could go, nearly pulling out with each pass. Sweat had begun to form on his forehead, and he could feel Tony’s arm shuddering as he began to pump himself faster.
me, Steven?” Tony asked, placing a hand over his chest in mock astonishment. “First of all, I know I don’t
"Was that even legal?" Clint wanted to know, inspecting the ball and finding it had begun to deflate. Apparently Thor had hit it a little too hard.
He pushed past Steve, leaving the soldier actually a little startled. Tony usually gave in to that look. When the genius didn't stop at the door, Steve followed him, reaching out for his arm.
laugh for Bucky. Bucky, who looked like he probably could have had a resting bitch face for the history books, gazing at Steve with the softest smile on his lips (and just a little bit of icing that Tony was
"Am I allowed to ask why you're not now?" Tony obviously didn't want to pry. But Steve hoped he was just as invested in getting to know him as he was with Tony.
"No matter how hard you stare at that door, they aren't coming through it." Tony hadn't realized he'd been staring, zoned out as the clock ticked by and the night crept towards closing time. Rhodey was right there with him as he leaned on the counter, which was probably lazy and unbecoming of a partial business owner but what was the point of buying part of the diner if he wasn't allowed to mope a little when and where he wanted to? Not that Tony would admit he was moping, because that would have required him to fess up to what he was moping about. And there was just no way that after three years he was still waiting for Steve and Bucky to come in and get their anniversary cake, because that was ridiculous.
Tony sputters, phone in hand and eyes locked onto the little criminal currently pat-pat-ing greasy footprints all over his beautiful and once clean car. With a harmonica in its beak.
Leaning back to the headboard, he lost himself in the work as the sun slowly set outside, painting the room first a warm orange, then gradually a cool purple that faded into darkness. Tony didn’t bother with the lights. Darkness, coupled with the intense light of the laptop helped him focus with the background faded into abyss.
Steve had loved the constant sun, the warmth, laying by the poolside in a hoodie. Tony had started calling him Toasty.
Doubting his own fucking sense of smell when it had been trying to tell him there was an Omega in distress right under his nose.
But Tony had grown as an impulsive person in the last couple of years. He had learned to pick and choose his battles. Approach things… More critically and in a calculated manner. Be impulsive responsibly.
Tony started weeping again, almost inaudible, but Steve was so close now. So fine tuned to catch those little whispers.
He couldn’t let him go though, clammy hands holding onto the bony shoulders, muscles jumping under Steve’s hands now and then.
Tony snorted, knowing Steve had to be something like seventy fucking years old. But it was so easy to forget that, looking at him. He did look young. Tony tried not to think about the implications of that.
He plugged in everything he has disconnected, which was a sure way to stay unhacked. If you didn’t exist, they couldn’t find you. Whom he was scared of, he wasn’t sure yet. Obie? Government? But he was playing it safe this time, with Steve on the line.
He looked at the code he had abandoned years ago. A self learning security system. God. He could have finished a working draft of it when he was seventeen but no. Obie had said it was impossible. Obie had said it was too ambitious. Obie had said that he should lean more towards engineering rather than coding. Obie, Obie, Obie…
An animalistic scream came through the crack, piercing before it cut off with unnatural abruptness. Like a dog howling until it remembered its commands. The burning smell of Omega in distress poured out of the hole in the wall, along with a disgusting smell of decay and humidity.
It had taken a little to convince Steve that he was really about the “less is more” lifestyle, especially when he had vintage champagne in his hand and had been wearing a three thousand dollar suit but well, it had worked. Somehow.
It isn’t until Tony catches the fat feathery fury of hell making off with an entire bundle of fiber optic cable that he fully recognizes the extent of the crimes committed by this goose.
“Just a second JARVIS, I know what to do,” Tony looked around the workshop with purpose, “Ah! Here we go,” he picked up a little case.
Steve slowly inched around the entryway, tranq gun ready to fire. The tree’s needled rustled, he could still see the one rat bumbling on top of the tree precariously, now if he could only…
“He’s just taking them out, I actually bought them,” Tony complains, continuing to chop vegetables, “I remembered you like mini sausages. I went and bought extra. Well, I didn’t buy them myself. I told Jarvis to put it on the shopping list but still. I remembered. I want that known before that trash pile gets all the credit.”
In the middle of the glistening fog, was a… Young boy, about the age of Tony. And he was the prettiest boy Tony had ever seen. His thin frame, combined with his light skin and hair, made him look like an elf. He wobbled on the toadstool he was sitting on. Tony reached to steady him, holding his hand. Blue eyes met his.
It’s also a mess. Tony realizes the burn on his hand as they sit down to actually drink the coffee. He wants to patch it up but they soon realize that he knows nothing about how to treat a burn despite claiming to have burned his hands countless times.
Tony locked himself into the basement with his computers after his next encounter with Obie. Even thinking about it made his skin crawl, but he couldn’t even explain what bothered him so much. Still, everything Obie did started to grate on his nerves. Everything he did and said kept playing over and over in his head as he laid in bed at night; every second he got distracted, he remembered that the video that was still in Obie’s hard drive.
“What?” Iron Man does the first attack. Skrulls do their thing and all turn into Steve’s and Iron Man’s character but their shield allows them to just blast off area damages without worrying about friendly fire. They get all the Skrulls down to half of their health bar in three seconds and their mirroring spells break.
“I wanted to do more, I-” Steve took a deep breath, rubbing his greasy fingers harshly over his eyes, “God, I wanted to just,” his hands clenched into fists, he presses them against his face.
The owner knew Steve. Tony had guessed she would but it was so strange to see Steve well-known for being so gentle and polite. Somehow it just fit right into the puzzle that was Captain America in Tony’s mind. Kind. He even held the door open when they were coming into the cafe.
How could they do that? How could they have done that? He had been drifting, slipping in and out of uncontrollable rage. Hiding had become harder after that, but then again, he had been caring less and less about that.
Tony suddenly straightened, “Steve, not here, come on.” He pressed another his to his brow, “Let’s go home.”
Sobs shook his body long after he ran out of tears, he coughed, “You know what the worst part is?” He wiped his face with his sleeve, “Obie saw that. Obie saw all of that and he called him a ‘good asset’,” he laughed darkly. His throat hurt.
And oh God. When it hit him, the acrid smell of fear, Steve almost doubled over, instincts raging. Burnt vanilla under a hazy cloud of something akin ammonia and putrid smoke. Something vile was wafting through the house.
Now though, a year after it’s release, it’s very easy to say that the game is a success. Buttery smooth servers, secret nooks and crannies to every level area, a lively world, engaging and evolving combat, several branches of stories along with sandbox servers, constant content updates… It is the online RPG every player dreamed of.
Everything looked the same. And the worst thing was, there hasn’t been one single animal since Tony entered the woods.
Suddenly his blue eyes were so much closer than before, kneeling with Tony on the damp grass. Wide eyed and hyperventilating, his shaking hands got a hold of his own blond strands pulling with a ferocity that made Tony flinch.
But that was Steve and he would go down onto his knees and weep on the kitchen floor for some other Alpha’s dead Omega.
The irregular walking had turned into little tinkerings by the time Steve had made it downstairs. Coming from the kitchen, it was reminiscent of a rather large rodent looking for food.
Once they eliminate the chance of a house fire (and without the help of Dum-E or its beloved fire extinguisher) and take out the over-cooked eggs from the oven, the situation calmed down a little bit. Tony is still hurt. And Steve is still abashed about everything, as he should be.
“Maybe you should take a vacation, huh?” Obie had said, “Get away from the concrete jungle a little bit, unwind a little after- After everything.”
Steve stood there, looking at the view in front of him, bits and pieces from the past days flying through his mind. Blaming, blaming, blaming. Always blaming. Blaming the house. The noises. The smell.
“You really are,” he dropped his head, “I was so scared you were- That something was going to happen to you. I- Yeah,” Steve cut off. He rubbed his eyes, “I think I have butter in my eyes,” he huffed, smiling.
But Tony had gotten him these. It was before Steve had drilled into his head that sentimental gifts held more value to him then expensive ones but this had been Tony’s sentimental back when they were young and naive. Much later Steve had learned that Tony had put them there himself. Welding and all...
The “You died!” screen fades. Loading screen takes its place and in seconds, Steve is transported back to the lobby.
Tony scoffs and backs away from him, “I, Tony Stark, am not a house-wife! I refuse to make my husband food when he comes home every day from a day of tiring work.!
“I can’t-” Steve ran a hand over his face, spreading the filth, “You shouldn’t have- You shouldn’t be here, Tony, please.”
“While Obie was coming to you, Stone was waiting for me here,” Tony shivered, the fact that Obie had planned to kill him only now setting in, “He might have tried to kill me. I kind of might have buried a meat cleaver in his head. He might have pissed all over the kitchen floor, I don’t know.”
He gets the email when still in school and he has to physically stop himself from screaming by putting both his hands over his mouth. His phone burns a hole in his pocket.
Steve got up. Restless. Paced the living room. He caught his faded out reflection on the windows. In the faint reproduction of his mirrored image, he could see the deep valley between his brows, the dark purple that circled his eyes. He shivered, turning away from his distorted face.
Seeing Steve (Steve, Tony thought giddily, his name is Steve), eyes tearing and nose leaking, with his shaky hands holding onto Tony’s wrist had bruised his heart more than his abused joint. Knowing the key to the apartment was resting in Steve’s pocket, safe. Tony had been scared, the more he had looked at Steve he had felt it more and more acutely. He hadn’t been scared for himself but that this wouldn’t work. Still, the more Steve had panicked, the less he could feel that fear abate. Steve hadn’t known what to do as much as Tony.
To hell with it, Steve thought, you were so ready to take on the netherworld, face your own reality now.
“Hi.” Steve stands with a bouquet of vibrant red and yellow carnations, just behind a beautifully set out candle-lit dinner. “Thought I’d treat my boyfriend… Are you going to come here or just stand there,” he laughs, the way he does with the twinkle in his eyes that Tony can’t get enough of.
Tony looked down at him, he bent down, kissed his cheek. A pink blush instantly bloomed on Steve’s cheeks. Tony smiled for a moment, but then yesterday’s discovery came to his mind. His mood soured.
He also cannot take stuff from strangers when they pass things from hand to hand. He cannot drink very specific alcohol combinations because they trigger his depression. He can’t stand to be in cars when someone else is driving. And he definitely has trouble trusting people which turns forming relationships into a fucking hurdle race where hurdles have their own minds.
“It’s okay!” Tony squeaked, “I could carry you if you wanted to become a frog again.” This was a dream, so it probably didn’t matter if he said stupid things. Right? Were toadstools toxic? He couldn’t remember if he ever touched them.
Steve’s hands tightened around him once more, “Drinking doesn’t affect me, even the most potent drug doesn’t stay in my system more than an hour. At first I tried running but that didn’t cut it,” he choked on a humorless laugh, “I tried boxing but it just reminded me of Bucky. Then again there are only so many underground rinks that will accept you after you accidentally killed two or three thugs in a row. I hid in plain sight, I could do that before you. But maybe the way I lived was killing me from the inside out,” he looked at Tony, eyes sparkling with unshed tears.
Still, the shoulder wound would need cleaning, he thought. He could also cook while he slept. Tony must have been hungry. What would be appropriate to feed somebody who was starved, he didn’t know. He didn’t even know if he had anything suitable in the kitchen. He fumbled for a second, mind drawing blank as he stood in his small kitchen with a sleeping Omega propped up against his chest.
There he was, sitting under a tree, scratching at a pad, head bent comically close to the paper. Tony could literally hear the blood rushing in his in his ears. He hadn’t planned any further than this. To be fair, he hadn’t thought he would ever get this far either. So he stood there, unseen, slowly growing colder and colder while a hurricane went on inside him.
Obie could get someone to track his phone. Obie could get someone to literally follow him. He had never stopped and thought about how much of his life Obie had taken under control. His cards went through Obie because he was drunk most of the time wasn’t he, so were his friends, what if someone stole it.
“Well, not buy, not exactly. I may have kind of funded them though. The animal’s rights organization that I was in contact with wanted to open an educational zoo about farm animals for a while now. You know, to get the city kids in touch with nature and stuff. The grand opening is tomorrow but I wanted you to see it without the crowd and such, in peace.
Stone toppled over to the floor, taking Tony down with him. He had the advantage of his body weight but Tony was running on adrenaline. Stone made to grab him again with his good hand. Tony averted him and rolled to the side, shaking him off.
“Oh!” Steve had fixed it with a little touch on the side, “I- My ears get cold, so,” he had shrugged.
“I’m cold,” had whispered Steve, under scalding water, air inside the bathroom so warm and humid it had been hard to breathe, “I can’t feel my feet.”
A voice came through the open doors of  the sitting room to his left, “My son wasn’t supposed to die, you know.”
The constant beanie and no hair touching hadn’t been in the original agreement, Tony refuses to believe that. But also, he cannot understand why Steve is so against it.
The worst thing is that Tony Stark was as intimidatingly and effortlessly handsome as he remembered. Steve hadn’t been able to stop peeking at him as he gingerly taking off the ribbon around the goose’s neck. He had been in a black tank top; his slightly tanned and toned arms flexing as he fiddled with the bow. He had wiped his hands on an already grease stained fabric before opening the note.
Steve got up, turning around to look at his boxes. He could finish the clothes and books all tonight. He was just going to unpack and place them in drawers and shelves after all. Then he could do the kitchen stuff tomorrow as he made breakfast. Leave the paints and brushes in the living room, take them out as he needed them.
“Oh! Hi darling, you’re the one Tiberius sold the house to then,” a middle-aged woman with already coiffed chestnut hair had poked her head above the tall separator between the houses.
That voice is not what Steve expects. He stands there, slack hand pointing at Tony Stark, doing his best beached fish impression.
Steve laid down on the bed, listening to the telltale sounds he knew would come. He gripped the handle of the hammer in his hands.
He still had trouble connecting the Steve he had in his arms just last night to the man Howard went on and on about. Steve Rogers to Captain America.
“You’re up! Not that I don’t love your morning voice, but go freshen up!” He heads over and pecks Steve’s lips, “I’m making breakfast!” Tony grins and brushes Steve’s hair back from his forehead, “Pancakes, gotta keep my eyes on the prize baby.”
The thing is, Steve can’t really be sure if this is a passing fancy, fed by holding the attention of someone else or if it’s something he would really like to do indefinitely. He loves environment design and he loves gaming too, but he’s worried that his favorite pastime activity will become a burden, once it gets official and there is a deadline on it.
The lack of sleep, energy, the fact that he hadn't been able to eat hit him, slowly took over him. He swayed where he sat. Vanilla wafted around him, surrounding him, getting more and more powerful the more he sat.
Tony faked crying in front of police officers, gave blood samples and acted like he had no idea who might have drugged him. And apparently Ty was so horribly maimed that maybe for the first time, Tony saw actual disturbance in Obie’s eyes when they met.
It was visceral. A loud thump echoed in the room, making Steve jump out of his skin. Then the entire kitchen was filled with the pungent smell he remembered from the day before.
“You knew that,” Steve has no idea what Iron Man truly means or why he is so surprised but on the other hand, maybe he understands a little. A lot of other people would capitalize on such fame. “Well, you know, I like the anonymity of it. I could be just… Anyone. And that makes me, uh, relatable? I guess?”
Emboldened, Tony offered that they check out the apartment. They slowly walked, quiet, arms rubbing at every other swing.
Code came to him in disconnected pieces. He really had gotten rusty in the passing years. His mind jumped out forward to create pieces that shouldn’t have existed yet. He wanted to go crazy on the keyboard, smash out the entire code in but he forgot operators; wrote new, unnecessarily long and complicated, functions for already existing ones.
“I legally bought this house from-” he couldn’t bring himself to say the name, “from him about a week ago.”
He had wondered if Steve would pick up on what he was saying but he did. He seemed sheepish; still, he was not secretive when talking to Tony about someone he killed. Tony didn’t know why that made him happy, but it did.
But no. Because Tony was a very lucky person like that, his boyfriend had to go and find probably the only free roaming goat in the entire New York. And not only find the animal. No. But also bring it home and love it so much that he was now looking at the photos of it from his phone and sighing whenever he thought Tony wasn’t watching.
Tony heard him shuffle on the other side. A flutter or pages. A zipper. Semi-slick, almost rubbery sound of dewy grass and mud under his shoes. Leaving. Don’t leave.
There was only one person to ever come into his arms and stay there for a warmth that even boiling water couldn’t give, and that was Steve.
Steve squinted at the screen of his phone, “I don’t know. Last time I had a phone, they still had buttons.”
“Alright,” Steve walked up to the bed. He sat down beside him, inhaling his metal and herb scent and bent down to press a lingering kiss to his husband’s lips, “I’ll ogle you instead.”
He slowly jacked them both off, exploring in a way he never had before with any other partner. Steve was uncut. Tony’s thumb fit just right under his foreskin, so he pushed it there, rubbing the moist head. Steve shuddered violently above him, his chest rumbling against Tony’s. He was leaking so much. Tony wanted to taste him. Some other time, he promised himself.
Little did he know, this would become a long running joke between him and his husband for years to come.
There had to be a logical explanation to all of this, but thoughts were slippery. His head turned, not unlike a bad case of vertigo. He was scared shitless still. Adrenaline sucked up every reasonable thing his brain came up with like a black hole.
Tony didn’t dare move. His head on Steve’s shoulder, one hand carding through the short strands on the nape of his neck; they sat like that long after Steve ran out of things to say. The room got colder and colder as the sun started to set.
Tony woke up to an unfamiliar, empty flat with his eyes crusted and mouth sour. He slowly dragged himself upright on the bare mattress he was on; memories of last night trying to make a come back, take over his mind.
Suddenly Steve is full of questions and he doesn’t even know if he can ask them. He puts his head into his hands and tries to process everything and their implications, the game forgotten.
He stands there for a couple minutes under fading daylight, with a defeated expression on his face before turning around and leaving for his garage. Maybe he should go back to his ideas for cutting-edge anti-goose technology.
He had almost went victim to homicide, not to mention Obie thought him and Ty were a thing by mutual choice. So in his eyes, he had also lost his boyfriend. Well, good riddance.
“I don’t want things to change either. And yes, maybe your position combined with mine will make things hard at times, a Crown Prince and- Well, me.”
“These,” Tony waved the pack while looking for the gun itself, “are left from the time Thor tried to adopt the racoon, remember, should be more than enough.”
It’s a Wednesday. They are asking him if he can make it Saturday morning (because they remembered that he’s a teacher), but are open to rescheduling in work days. Steve’s hands shake as he writes the email back at home, saying that yes, he can come on Saturday.
Ty’s breath was sour on his face, hands uncoordinated as they ran over his body, pushing his clothing aside with a single minded determination that said I don’t care about your body, I get what I want, I want you humiliated.
But then there was the fact that, even if he really hadn’t been remembering correctly, Obie still had been in his room while he slept. Sure, his ideas of Obie were souring real fast lately but Obie wouldn’t try to hurt him directly. He wouldn’t try anything like suffocating him in his sleep.
The point was that with one pair of ordinary jeans and a pair of sunglasses later, Tony was just a guy.
And Tony knows something will go wrong. It will. He made Dum-E. He loves Dum-E, even though he would never admit out loud. And he knows just how clumsy the thing is. It can’t help it. AI coding was stilted at best when Tony had made Dum-E and now, his hardware just wouldn’t handle that much updating.
He reached over to smooth the crease between Steve’s eyebrows, “You’re not doing this out of obligation or anything, right? I mean we can just- I don’t know. Stay here. Be free-range superheroes or something.”
“Gone to deal with your new boy,” Stone started walking towards him, “He realized you looked at the video footage, you know. His own security systems are not too shabby either. We didn’t think you would go find that boy and lay under him too but oh well, you made it easier for all of us, didn’t you?
“I cannot be sure if you’re underestimating yourself or overestimating the entire world. Also, please, take the Hand and let’s roll, better drop won’t materialize in your inventory the more you scroll.”
Steve peeks around the rock to deal some more damage and gather more orbs, “How do you like the arena?”
Thinking back now, he was berating himself for even saying that much. He should have found something to say that- Hell, he just shouldn’t have opened his mouth at all. But he also had had to find a middle ground to make Obie quit his I’m worried about you act and make him go away so that he could get his throbbing wrist out from under the covers and run it under cold water or something.
His dream, his new beginning, crumbled around him the more he stayed in this place. But God, oh God he couldn’t leave.
“Not in the kitchen, Tony,” Steve whispers in his ear, if he didn’t have self control, God knows Steve would have taken Tony right away. He sweeps Tony off of his feet, taking him towards the elevator, “You look beautiful. You always do.”
“Not a rotary?” Tony laughed when Steve shot him an accusatory look, “but look, this one has a button!”
Steve panicked. They never had a pest problem in the tower before. Tony had regular cleaning crews. There were several labs in this very building, they couldn’t afford poor hygiene or contamination. But apparently, all of these meant nothing to the notorious variety of sewer rats that lived in NYC.
Tony looks around and sees one of the colorful post-it notes that he has lying around. He balls it up and tucks it into his pocket. Then picks up their drinks and walks back into the garage.
Rustling noises came from the tree, no one peaked out behind it. ‘Have I been discovered?’ thought Steve. Wouldn’t be surprising in this tower.
“Sweetcheeks! Surprise date time!” Tony threw himself onto the bed beside Steve, who was lounging with a book in his hand after breakfast.
“You shouldn’t have come here,” he grabbed Tony’s wrist, “You shouldn’t be around me. Especially you.”
But it’s not unsalvageable. And it’s really just the saddest sight, seeing Steve’s ears lay down flat like that.
Now, he had just came into the mansion. He could leave. Physically, there was nothing stopping him from leaving. But he was stuck to the chair he was sitting on. Possibilities ran through his mind.
Overall, they are productive classes but it definitely doesn’t help him get the looming meeting out of his mind. It’s just hard for Steve to reconcile the idea of Iron Man, the in-game character with Iron Man, the Stark Industries employee who has several other work obligations.
Dropping his shoulders as if he could hide from his own outburst, Steve lowered his voice, “No. Ah- No. It’s just that-” he whispered, his eyes still on the long line at the counter, “There was blood and I- I had wiped but I should- Don’t leave. Right? You won’t leave if I-”
And it’s good. It makes Steve ache a little because he would like to have this outside of the game too. He cannot be sure if he’s projecting his feelings onto Iron Man but he feels like Iron Man is having fun. They do just stand around, idle, and talk about nothing.
The mushrooms got bigger and bigger as he walked. The foliage was so thick, if this was a regular forest there would be no way Tony would be able to see where he was going. He had no idea how there was even a path this deep.
Surely it wouldn’t take long for someone to tie this to the other cases where someone must have used some kind of superhuman strength and then…
When he’s home, in front of the computer with a posture that would make orthopedicians cry, he’s TheCaptain. In the player communities, he’s kind of a big name. It’s not that he engages in the chats a lot. He knows firsthand how nasty they get. Still, everyone knows shit’s about to go down once TheCaptain logs in.
“No, Steve,” Tony sighed, “Do you really think you hadn’t left any of your blood on Ty?” he felt Steve tense underneath him, arms locking in their constrictive embrace, “Babe, I had your back from the start.”
And obviously he wouldn’t be able to trust the dumb (however cute and waddly) bird to find its way directly to the mechanic’s garage so he had all but grabbed the goose and went over to the place himself. Had set the goose back on its feet from the side of the garage door and ran away like a kid. Well, there had been some peeking, but he couldn’t risk being caught.
“We’ll do a couple layovers. We’ll act like we were already gone. By the time someone gets suspicious we’ll have ten thousand alibis. I’m good at the show off boyfriend act, you’ll see.”
All of this barely processed through his mind before he was leaning forward to capture Steve's lips in a kiss that, if he was being honest, he'd been wanting to go for since they sat down to watch Netflix together for the first time. Who would have thought that running away from commitment would drive him to actually wanting it with someone?
For a moment Steve just took the chance to breathe, watching as Tony’s face twitched, his throat contracting with the helpless moan that escaped him. Steve’s hips picked up the pace at that, driving up into Tony in quick, calculated movements. Tony’s right arm had lifted to hold the back of Steve’s neck, the left gripping one of Steve’s that had wrapped around him. His eyes. They were so blown, so gone. It was beautiful. It was-
That at least got an attempt at a laugh, one of Steve's hands coming back out of his pockets to rub the back of his neck. "So it hasn't changed," Steve breathed, a mixture of relief and dread to his tone. "It's been- Well. I figured it wouldn't be the same place."
Tony took a moment to glance over at Steve, who seemed to be locked in deep conversation with Clint. Briefly the man wondered if his friends were giving Steve a similar talk. Suddenly Tony wished he could have a shot. The more he thought about it, the more and more he wanted to try things with Steve. This was the perfect setting to make a move. Everyone seemed to agree that they were trying to start something. What if he just...
“My pleasure, now let’s settle down before my lasagne gets cold,” he slides off Tony’s jacket and ditches it on the counter, in a very un-Steve like fashion.
It was a surreal experience, showering with Steve. It hadn’t been something Tony ever fantasized about, though, to be fair, he wouldn’t know what to imagine if he had fantasized. But not this, never this.
“There used to be a toy store,” Steve pointed to a brick and mortar that was now a high end boutique, “It was real fancy stuff. We wouldn’t come to this part of the town much when I was little, but sometimes,” he sighed wistfully as they left the boutique behind, “Even after I outgrew toys I’d come here to look at their displays. They’d always have these puzzle boxes out of dark, polishes wood. Wonder what happened to that shop.”
Maybe it hadn’t happened that way. Maybe Tiberius Stone had gotten to hold his Omega’s hand until his untimely end and had now made his peace with it. Maybe Tiberius Stone had been ready to let go, the moment he shook Steve’s hand for the last time on that very porch. Maybe he hasn't looked back since.
It was unheard of a royal returning alone. Or… Well, not returning, more like. Because he was to not return until he found his consort.
Steve rolled his eyes, getting up from where he was petting the goat as it kept licking the lamp, which was a scene Tony still couldn’t wrap his mind around, “Apparently there had been a problem with the transportation of these little guys a while ago,” Steve says gesturing at the goat, “they found the majority of them but a couple are still missing and, well, I found this little guy at the supermarket and decided to take him in until his owners can come and get him.”
It had been occupied by a blond cutie who had been wearing a blue beanie on top of his suit and tie.
Steve slowly turned to him. Eyes closed and his forehead creased, he looked every bit the murdered who caved Ty’s head in. He took a deep, shaky breath. Let go of the doorknob. When he opened them, his eyes were almost all black, swallowed by the dilated pupils.
Tony slowly lost the time. Steve’s tempo never faltered. It felt like they actually been in bed for the entire day, Steve fucking him for forever now, but also as if he had just started. When he came for a second time, it was slow and long. Heat coiled in his belly, slowly spread around his body as his cock pulsed, pressed against the pillow under his hips with Steve’s weight. He shook, feeling the force of it in the back of his throat. He couldn’t breathe.
A smell, like vanilla gone bad, aromatic but with a sharp edge of something noxious to it came and went.
You see, the worst part is, he wants to devise a plan. He wants to devise a plan to sneakily remove the beanie from Steve’s head and just bury his hands into those golden locks. Just give his boyfriend a kiss on the head.
Steve’s mind didn’t work that way. He swayed in the darkness, ruined wall and crying Omega still right in front of him.
“God, I am so fucking weak for you,” Steve whispered into his neck, pressing his nose in so hard, he must have been cutting off his own air, Tony thought. His hips continued their aborted little thrusts and circles above Tony, grinding their hard cocks together through layers of clothing.
Iron Man waves away a couple attacks Steve makes in the meantime, and continues babbling on, “So that was bad obviously. Someone is getting fired. I mean, not really, but still. Bad. Still, I- Well, I wondered what kind of things you’d come up with. I also felt a little bad about egging you on after you said you had scoliosis. Don’t get me wrong, I’m sure you’re- Uh- You’re living with it. Do you have a good set up? Be honest. I’m ready to feel worse if you’re playing on a little laptop on your kitchen table right now.”
Back into the living room, Steve walks over to his boyfriend who has appropriately put away all the dishes in their respective places. “Hi, got all your stuff.”
But the crying. It hadn't even sounded human. Almost like a dog that had been beaten and left outside.
“An A.I. Steve, the coffee thing was just an example. Artificial intelligence and all from scratch, I might add,” Tony took a bite of his cinnamon roll, “I have no idea why I thought I could mix like C++, Python and Prolog. It doesn’t even make sense.”
Steve groaned, turning away in mock indignancy. Tony laughed at his antics. They would be just fine.
Steve came up to him, walking as if moving slowly was a challenge he had to win, then knelt between his legs. Tony’s hands found his hair. Steve looked at him with blown out eyes, he could see a muscle ticking in his jaw.
“Hey Toasty, Coulson called for the third time today and if I have to deal with his lovesick voice one more time I’m going to throw myself into the pool.”
“Geese don’t use screwdrivers!” Tony shouts after it, halfheartedly, “You don’t even have opposable thumbs!”
It’s just that Tony, being Tony, hadn't been able to say no to flirting with the handsome stranger. It’s not like they get new blood in this town that often. And definitely not of that caliber. Rogers had looked good, coming out of the little store with groceries, biceps swelling with the weight of the bags. Face open and hopeful. Tired, but hopeful.
Steve stopped. Listened. That was not an echo of the sound of the hammer. In fact, the hammer had barely made any sound.
But Tony felt it too. They were ready to go out there. Show their faces. Become Iron Man and Captain America besides just Tony and Steve.
Stone handed him the keys, shook his hand and left in a sleek black car. The moving company took his signature for the last paperwork and drove off.
Grudgingly, he had to admit there was an eerie beauty to the morning light streaming through the mist. Not quite foggy yet, but there was a blur to everything. But then again, that could have been the lack of sleep on Tony’s part too. Dew covered the  grass like a glossy coating. The smell of it was enough to keep him awake and on the path, reminding him what he was about to do. Excitement fluttered in his stomach, something between childish glee and desire.
But there was also the part where the man, Ty’s killer, had came over to Tony, hadn’t turned him around and potentially choke him on his own vomit but put two bloody fingers into his mouth, clearing liquid and pulling out his tongue, clearing his airway. Carefully holding Tony’s head to the side as he had held him like a baby that weighed nothing.
Tony spoke gently, “You can, like, not answer this if you don’t want to. Like, you can- I mean, you don’t have to answer anything you don’t want to, obviously, but-” He bit his lip, “Do you- How was Howard when you had met him?”
“No. Steve, don’t be like that. I- It’s not your fault. I don’t think that was the only thing but- Yeah, he was- He wasn’t really that good of a father,” Tony laughed, humorless, “But yeah, he would always talk about you. He was convinced he could find you. Bring you back. I always wondered how a man like Howard had ever been friends with you.”
The map maker that greets him is both overwhelming and exciting. There is basically everything. Or seems like it to Steve. He has never really dabbled in modding but then again this is more like a tool pack. And basic things, he can figure out after a little fiddling.
“I mean,” Iron Man clears his throat, “You don’t have to be a person to get weird stuff. You should see some of the,” he emphasizes, “fan mail that we receive around here.”
A little hiss of clothing, a brush against the walls. Just the hint of a sound and he was pulled away from dreamland.
And for Tony too! The magic of the place probably knew how forgetful he was, how he would get caught up in his own inventions and forget about ruling. Forget about his consort too, probably.
But that pushing stuff off of the table thing, combined with the hair thing, sticks with Tony. He doesn’t even know why. It just does, bounces around in his head like there is an obvious train of thought that he should have caught long ago.
Tony doesn’t seem mollified by that. And frankly, it’s not like him to be so nervous about interviews. Not outwardly, at least.
Tony looked around, there really was nobody around. He had crossed a couple runners, a trio of yogis in various states of stretchiness. But the more he advanced in his path, the less and less frequent people had become. And now he was all alone.
“They don’t know me and how I will go on a tangent when it comes to accessibility in gaming, come on.”
Steve follows after her and thinks, clearly, there must be something wrong. Surely, they must have confused him with someone else. Steve Rogers isn’t an entirely unique name. It would just be Steve’s luck if another Steve Rogers had applied for a higher positioned job. He has been confused with people named Rodgers before.
Tony hacked street cams, security cameras, maybe revolutionized facial recognition technology in a way that he would never be able to admit publicly if he didn’t want about twenty different charges of disregarding image and personality rights and such, but he found him.
He was haunted by the moaning cries of a nameless, shapeless Omega in his dreams, whenever he drifted off. Just out of his reach. Where he couldn’t comfort them, scrambled like the useless Alpha that he was.
Or maybe he was crying for his own dead and gone dreams. This place, this hellhole of a house making him act out his worst nightmares, as if it had been him who lost a partner. As if he had any right to this pain he was feeling.
He sat up. He was going to tear down the wallpaper. Not now. Not today. But he was going to take it all apart and he was going to paint the walls all over again.
“Ah- Yea,” Iron Man sounds… He almost sounds sheepish. Can an AI sound sheepish? He does. If he is an AI, at that. “Map tools weren’t really a thing, until yesterday, and then they were. So if the user interface is a bit shitty, yea, it’s because of that.” The in-game model claps his hands and jumps in place, “Music or no music?”
Or if he wanted to be the one to break the illusion of anonymity for this man who had went to great lengths to ensure he was not found.
Suddenly there was a poof of mist, felt almost like a mix of condensation and smoke without a scent. Tony waved his arms to make it dissipate.
“Nothing,” he whispers, his eyes don’t meet Steve’s, just to make this more ridiculous, his face is flushed deep red, an almost ironic way to how Steve blushes.
“Did someone change the lightbulbs? Do we need an electrician in a mansion with the name Stark on it?”
“You’ll have to forgive my shoddy work with the wallpaper,” Stone said as the movers brought in last of Steve’s boxes and piled them up in the living room, “I had to change them once- Well, after I lost my Omega.”
Tony was sure there hadn’t been a plate when he woke up. Had he been that sleepy still that he hadn’t realized? It still bothered him. Nagged at him like a pebble in his shoe. He would have realized a platter with a cloche sitting on his side table, right? Right. Why would Obie lie about bringing food, even?
“I heard you quit drinking since the accident, hm? If your psycho knight in shining armor hadn’t interrupted the little altercation between Ty and you, would you have quit just the same?”
There was so much he wished he could ask Howard too. What had pushed him to cut his ties with the remaining scientists from the super soldier project? What had pushed him to cut ties with the government projects? Howard had talked so much about Captain America and so little about his ties to the project.
Did they remember the houses they built and the rooms they decorated with the hope of a lifetime in them only to have that dream stolen? The rug pulled under them, did they traverse the world of living, scrambling to find a way to be with material beings again?
They had been leaving the cookies out with a glass cloche on them. It’s not like you could put cookies in the fridge. But a cloche, glass or not, meant nothing to the NYC rats. Those things chewed holes in walls.
He sighed, “Steve, worst case, Obie probably knows I looked at the video. They probably want me to know that they know I looked at the video. We’re going by that they don’t know who you are yet but if they really set their mind to it they will find out. Howard’s stuff about you is still somewhere in that house.”
It will be fine, he thinks to himself. He is a high school teacher, he has the ability to talk over anyone and anything. And does he love talking about accessibility anyway.
If this is the kind of artificial intelligence Tony Stark can come up with, Steve doesn’t want to know just how the inside of the man’s mind is.
It took him ten hours to hack into the databases untracked. Three days to connect him to other cases. Another week to find him, head low with a tattered sketchpad under his arm, living out of a duffle bag.
Because a man has got to throw away his trash somewhere, even if the receipts were paid in cash and the little baggies were torn, data was everywhere. And Tony was nothing if not thorough. After all, what was the point of being a genius if you didn’t sit down and compile the purchases from the same establishments at similar hours. And hacked their security cameras.
It had been Steve’s dream to have a house. To be fair, there had been other things involved in that dream; a loving Omega he would support and cherish, a dog, kids someday… But the house was a start. Steve just had to remind that to himself. He had to start somewhere, and if it was all by himself… Well, he was just being maudlin now.
The changeling blushed, “I don’t really know it either. We have no kings. But… We can figure it out together, right?” He hopped down from the toadstool, “I’m Steve.” His hand was still in Tony’s.
No more late night booty calls that got him into trouble with Obie, the ones that he didn’t want to answer anyway. No more dealing with his asshole ways. No more cajoling and guilt tripping. No more parties where he knew no one but Ty so he had to stick with him and… Well. Not again.
Also, Steve had called the goose, the town criminal, without specifying that he was talking about the bird, which will always be written as about 10 points in his corner. Even if this thing doesn’t work out. It
The tree was big enough to hide a person behind it. And fake, since Tony didn’t believe in cutting trees and dealing with fallen needles just to have it up for a couple weeks. It looked like it was decorated by a bunch of kids, the garish pink tinsel that went all the way around twinkled under the light of scented candles and fairy lights.
And oh, he burns his hand while trying to make coffee and then just give up on breakfast altogether. At least it’s his left hand, which technically can stay hidden the entire time if needed.
Steve had been sitting in front of his easel, fluid white drying on the empty canvas as his brain did nothing but play the conversation with his new neighbor from earlier again and again, focused on one single fact: He had died in this house, the Omega.
The billionaire leans forward, “Hey, you’re eating said chef’s spag bol,” he laughs and eats more of the spaghetti.
“Oh fuck, I can’t help myself, Tony, please, I can’t-” Steve let out a shaky breath, “I’m gonna hurt you, Tony, I can’t control it, please.”
It’s been really hard. Moving. Leaving a big city like New York and coming to a small town. Wondering if it will work out, if you’ll be able to make it. Get used to it. But staying in Brooklyn had became harder and harder after I had lost my mother. But also I had never lived anywhere else before. All my life; the same neighbourhood, same faces, same places...
Light suddenly filled the room, temporarily blinding him again. Tony blinked. His heart clenched at the sight when his eyes adjust.
The dream of being a pro at anything is long gone. Not that his reaction time is lacking but his back, it just doesn’t want him to sit straight for too long. Or at all. Never did. I do it for fun, Steve says to himself, slashing through players and NPCs alike in whatever competitive game or community event he finds himself drawn to. Not to prove anything. Really. I do it for fun.
He didn’t know many things, to be completely honest. He looked down again. After doubting the truth under his nose for so long, so selfishly focused on himself, he owed Tony a happy ending.
“I can only judge what I have in front of me darlin’” Tony shivers hearing the Brooklyn accent in Steve’s voice clearly.
They didn’t even get naked. Tony fumbled with Steve’s sweatpants and his own zipper as Steve worried the skin of his neck between his teeth. He took them both into his hand but once he started touching Steve’s cock, he couldn’t bring himself to hurry.
Unlike Steve, who had waited a little too long and worked a little too much and in the end he had his name and his illustrations but nothing fulfilling to come back home to.
Steve sighs and goes to set out some vegetable scraps for the little rascal. He looks at the goose as it gobbles down the carrot peels, “You started this mess and you fix it!”
Children were waiting for the school bus a couple of houses over. Next door was washing plates in the sink. Down the street, someone was mowing their lawn.
The next class he enters, one of his students goes, “Oh my God, Sir, are you getting married?” Because he’s beaming that much.
Tony looks to the left. Then to the right. Then for good measure, he pokes his head out of the garage and looks around. There is nobody.
Now, three hours later, Steve still has no idea if the thing can actually discern things about his fighting style from their conversation or if this is just a way of messing with his flow. He doesn’t even use the microphone normally, he doesn’t know if he forgot it on or if the boss fight overrides things like that.
“No,” Tony sidled up close, “I am not black and blue for the first time in years, do you even know how much Ty- That night wasn’t a one-off thing. This,” he held up his wrist, “this is nothing, this-” as he reached for the tight hands Tony realized he had busted open some of the closed wounds on the left one.
And anyone else was just dead, not that Howard would count as someone who stuck around. Maria, eh. Just Jarvis. Tony took a deep breath, trying to will his lips not to tremble.
“Oh for fuck’s sake! Will you keep repeating that? Because I will need you to sign an NDA at this rate.”
Well, Tony is not going to be knocking on that door anytime soon. He knows for a fact that the guy hates his guts. Since day one. Not that there had been any other day apart from day one but… Well. Oh well.
No. Not only Obie knew but he had allowed it. He had allowed Ty to do whatever he wanted with Tony. Hell, he had encouraged it. They both did, Ty’s own father did.
All the kings and queens of Starkia went into the forest to find their life long partner. The true changeling would find their way to the king or queen-to-be. Changelings were magic. The forest was magic. No matter how deep it got, the sunlight was always visible. Colors were vibrant. Flowers always bloomed. It was made ions ago, to tie the humans and the magical creatures. To fall in love.
What was his plan, really? Tony and people didn’t really mix anyway. Just look at the people who did stick around. Ty, after his ass and money, trying to find a new blackmail material every single day, and if he couldn’t find it, he wasn’t any above creating it. Obie, who called Ty a bright boy, even after everything and had slowly detached Tony from SI, somehow.
He can figure out the openings in the attacks and defences of any opponent under five minutes. If it’s an AI, even shorter. He categorizes playing styles, weapon and armor choices, tactics and terrain in an almost tangible separate folder from the rest of his brain. In another life, he could have been a war hero maybe, a true tactical mastermind.
He flipped open one of the notebooks, one of the half-sized ones that Steve had in Central Park too. Small trees, bushes, dogs and squirrels covered the pages. Some were more realistic than the others. Some, Steve had left unfinished; head too crooked, one limb too long to waste more time on.
This was supposed to be someone’s dream house, he thought to himself. Someone’s dream family with the loving Omega, kids and a dog.
Tony would have never thought that he would be the one in a relationship who promotes healthy eating habits but here he is, putting chopped bell peppers into their egg mixture as Steve tries to bat the pepper pieces off the board, “Steve, it’s frittata muffins! They can’t be just egg.”
I had been tired and irritable, Steve had written. I owe you a very late apology, he had said. I have, what I assume is, all of your lost tools and I would like to return them if you’re not against seeing me again.
Steve’s hips faltered, he moaned into Tony’s neck. He laid down, engulfing his body completely. It felt safe, Tony realized, being here, under this man who could probably rip him apart if he wanted, he felt safe the most.
Steve opened the window, breathing in the clean air. Surely, he was imagining. Hallucinating. Maybe moving had whacked up his rut cycle.
Steve was staring directly at the phone like his gaze alone could shut it up. His hand on the armrest of his chair was tight, fingers digging into the fabric.
It wasn’t the sobbing kind of cry. There was no force behind it. Just the pathetic mewlings of somebody who could do nothing but cry with nothing to lose and nothing to gain. Crying hopelessly, out of instinct.
Tony was stranded and desperate. He wanted that known. It wasn’t like he went around kissing frogs on the regular. Nope.
“He seemed like a sweet boy,” the nosy woman had said, “he didn’t come out much, only with Tiberius. He was quite shy, I guess, but they looked so good together. Fit so well, was a shame, really.”
Tony smiles, and dries his hands, “Great, thanks babe.” He puts on his blazer and straightens his tie, “Let’s.”
“I knew, you know,” Tony started after a while, shaking hands rubbing Steve’s back, “I knew he was trying to keep me out of the company. I knew-” He took a deep breath, “I didn’t care, I guess, I don’t know. I wasn’t going to fully inherit anything until I was twenty one anyway, so… God,” he chuckled humorlessly, “You’d think someone would be more worried about his godson’s cocaine addiction.”
Steve knows Iron Man won’t be able to do it, he can recognize patterns, he can rework what he knows, but he cannot create something new from scratch. The fact that he understood what Steve is asking for is an accomplishment in itself. But he cannot create something new. Not without a human behind the wheel.
The good times are always good in any relationship. It’s when they disagree that Tony feels like this is it. Because they always find a way. They make it work.
“Yeah, some, though to be fair, the snail mail is mostly genuine fan mail. Like, trolls don’t really go that far to troll. But emails and social media? Weird. Just, weird Cap. We have a group channel where our social media guys share the funniest or weirdest ones. Some of them straight up make you question what they were thinking when sending that.”
He clears his throat for a moment, and looks between the other parties in the room, “Of course, whatever it is,” his gaze flickers down to the files in front of him, “it’ll be great. If that’s all Miss Potts?”
Tony scrambled for Steve’s arm, holding his wrist right beside his head, “Steve, oh God, Steve, lay down on me, let me feel you please.”
The cold sweat on Tony’s back clashed with the excitement bubbling in his stomach. Captain America had been living like this for decades. Surely he wouldn’t slip that easily. Still, Tony had seen the seemingly uncontrollable way he had went at Ty’s face.
Holding firmly, he slowly caressed away the detached scabs and the drops of blood welled up on taut skin, “It’s nothing. You wouldn’t-” Tony pulled away Steve’s hands, clenched in his own hair, one by one interlocking their fingers, “You wouldn’t hurt me like that.”
He wouldn’t be able to sleep. There was no way to make sure it wouldn’t be able to reach him. But still, this was all he could do.
He reached for Steve’s hands, one fist clenched in his hair, the other around the keys still. A shiver ran through him as Tony held his hands, rubbed his thumbs over his knuckles, feeling the bumps and the valleys of new and old scars. He ran his hands up Steve’s arms as he went pliant under his attention.
They look at each other. Dum-E slowly lowers his pincher, laying the beanie back on Steve’s head on its side.
Alas, he’s an art teacher with scoliosis. And his love for games did spurr his interest in art and character design. It did open a new world to him, in which he built the career he loves now. Still...
It was just that he hadn’t been able to stop thinking about it. He was supposed to scratch that itch and leave it there but God… With the things he had found, now it was impossible to stop. Thinking. Daydreaming. Scheming.
He giggles and lays back down, this time, resting his head on Steve’s chest. “You know, all dopey, and love-sick. Everyone knows, it’s when you look at people you love. Meaning me.” He grins and looks up at him.
They look at each other for a moment, then Iron Man, well, Tony breaks down laughing, which in turn makes Steve laugh. Maybe it’s a bit of a manic laugh on both of their parts but it is a laugh nevertheless and it breaks the ice.
Tony took in Steve’s stiff posture, jaw clamped tight. He wanted to be good for him. Wanted to show Steve he could be good, he could be anything. Anything Steve needed. Anything he wanted.
Tony squints at him, failing to hide his own smile, “Sure, you know me, I can never just have one thought, I’m a man of taste Steven.”
Steve rubbed a hand over his face and got up, leaving the canvas to fully dry, now that it was apparent that he wasn’t going to be painting anything. He went into the kitchen, took a glass and ran it under water before filling it up and taking a drink.
They have Discord set up. He has his Discord, oh God, Steve has IronMan’s actual Discord. And hearing Iron Man’s voice, out of the game, without the in-game modulators is weird at first. He doesn’t sound like how Steve imagined he would. He sounds just as cocky as his character does. And he sounds human, normal. Steve thinks he likes that voice.
Saturday morning is the worst, most horrible time Steve has had in years. His clothes feel awkward on him, even though he logically knows that they look just like how they do any other day. He looks exceptionally worse in the mirror.
And Tony is right. The waddling bundle of doom approaches, honking and being a general nuisance. It doesn’t even try for stealth as it grabs a long strip of discarded chain and totters away.
He coded until morning and then some. His focus seemed fragile. Normally he would be in the zone, deep enough that he wouldn’t hear if a bomb went off beside him but this time he was disconnected from the world by a soap bubble that threatened to pop and let the panic sink in the moment he quit working. I have to be useful. In the end though, exhaustion had consumed him.
“...will be later this month, they are keeping the, well, the body. They think the killer’s blood may have mixed in with his but with enough luck, there may be a…”
After rinsing and flossing, Steve picks Tony back up, “Everything is romantic. You just have to do it with the right person.”
“I am not,” Steve trails off, looking at the article about the Lovelace test. Yep, this is it. This will be fun, “How- How many attacks do you have?”
“Did you think I could just let it go?” Tony lowered his voice, suddenly aware of how open, how vulnerable they are outside, “I used to have nightmares about him. Now I have nightmares of him coming back from death. Every time I wake up I just cry with relief that he is fucking gone, I-”
Steve kisses him again, “I know, thought you deserved it, you’ve been busting your ass for the team, I thought I’d help with your stress.”
That had gotten Stone wistful, “I had built this house for my Omega initially. It was supposed to be a bonding gift, you know,” he had sighed, ”well…” He had gestured stiffly.
They travel around the map. TheCaptain’s fame travels with them. Iron Man keeps poking him about it and it’s good. It’s, well, it’s just like playing with an actual friend. They take some notes about what kind of health items, drops and environmental clues could be used in the upcoming boss. Iron Man likes Steve’s idea that back to back phases should be from wildly different but previously traversed areas, so that it will be both challenging and not boring.
From his right, the side that faced the wall, came a slight warmth. As if someone had been sitting in the slight space between him and the wall. And they had just vacated it.
Throughout the house, burnt vanilla tickled his nose. Steve tried to make sense of it, tried to find where it was coming from. Pressed his nose to the floorboards, to the wallpaper he still couldn’t find the courage to tear down; breathed in that damp smell that rubbed him the wrong way.
But he could have done that days ago. He could have done that the first time he had been surrounded with weird smells and unexplained sounds.
“Not the point at all,” Steve cuts him off, “ the point is, people do stuff for the games they like for free all the time, people do much more than I do, why should I-”
Those dreams were long gone now though. Because right now, Tony was in the thick of the woods, he had no idea where he was exactly and the glinting light was starting to seem less and less friendly every second.
“Exactly. I need a bootstrapped language- I mean one that is, like, written in itself, that can learn and adapt itself, if I can manage that, then I won’t have to make the code be able to read other languages manually, Steve, it will learn that by itself.”
“It’s a good thing, I always win.” Tony turns his head and kisses Steve, deep and slow, his hands gently roam around Steve’s back, gently tugging at Steve’s shirt, “Want this off,” he whispers.
“I will have to think about that.” Steve pulls the blanket closer to them, tucking it right under Tony’s chin.
A soft pair of lips are on his, hungry, beautifully soft and so so warm. “I thought you misspoke, I thought it was a mistake, I didn’t even think much about it, but then for some reason I really understood. And..”
It takes Tony every single ounce of self control in his body not to say I’d like your sausage more. Instead he keeps chopping up shallots as evenly as he can while Steve takes a step back and looks at the chopping board with discontent.
Miss. Potts leans towards him as the elevator slows down, “Before you start blaming people, I just want you to know I did tell him this was a bad idea. He rarely listens.”
Tony had been in beds where arms and legs mixed, under the influence of way too many shit to ever be safe, in places he didn’t know with people whose faces he couldn’t recall and still… This was the thing that broke him at last. This was the thing that would make him throw everything aside if asked. He wouldn’t be able to go back. If Steve ever sent him away, he would be incomplete.
The sounds, he could take. The trepidation that never left him as long as he was in the house. The constant state of alert, in his own home, his sanctuary. But the smell. That whisper of a smell was going to drive him crazy.
The house had gotten colder, thanks to the windows he had left open to let the smell out. But that was the only reason why Steve could feel the minute difference between his right and left side.
Had he hit too hard? Did the vibrations cause something else to fall? Was that even possible? Maybe.
Steve gave up on painting. He woke up way too early and taking his coffee on the porch, standing, ready to duck in the moment the neighbourhood started to wake up. He felt listless and drained at the same time. He hadn’t slept well since he came here. It was almost like something just at the edge of his detection was keeping him awake.
“HEY!” Steve shouts into the headset, then winces, “Hey, yeah, I’m here I just- I just didn’t expect it to happen, uh, like this.”
It’s nice. It’s homely. It’s everything Tony didn’t know he needed until he got it. He can only hope Steve feels the same.
“I’m just saying,” Iron Man presses on, “at some point, the game will need fresh ideas Cap. This is an online game, that’s how it works. Avengers will need innovation in the design department, and if it’s going to come from someone who can actually understand game strategies besides art stuff, I think people would be, you know, interested.”
He took the keys out of his hand, blodied. Steve had cut his palm on them but he didn’t even seem to be aware of the cuts. To be fair, he seemed to slip away somewhere inside his own mind, eyes glazed and shivering from time to time. Tony unbuttoned his shirt, gently pushing it off of his shoulders.
Tony took in his face, barely there crow’s feet starting to settle around Steve’s eyes. One day Tony had found him in front of the mirror, late at night, smiling. He was periodically clenching and unclenching his face, eyes rapt on his own features.
Steve looked at him in the eyes, “I don’t want you to go there. Tony,” his arms got painfully tight around Tony, “I want to take you and run away. Go, anywhere but here, never let you get out of my sight.”
They stood under water, close, then closer. Tony had washed Steve’s hair, raising himself on his tiptoes to reach, Steve dipping his head unconsciously, pinkish water collecting around the drain, then slowly clearing away.
Tony dried them both with fluffy towels with the tags still on. Steve was shivering still but he looked more alert, more present. Tony dressed them both, tucked Steve under blankets and cuddled, head on his chest, listening to his breathing.
“So,” Tony turned to the impostor. Clearly, this was an impostor, “Who are you and what have you done to Captain America?”
The garden was rather barren, so they had gone inside immediately as the moving company brought in Steve’s furniture.
Steve pushes the bolt off the table. The wrench. That almost gets Tony on the foot. A screw. Another screw when Tony leaves the garage to make coffee for himself and bring water for Steve.
A few quiet moments pass, but neither has fallen asleep, Tony knows Steve isn’t asleep. He looks up at Steve. The moonlight from the window perfectly casts soft beams across Steve’s face, the light dances across his features and Tony feels like he falls in love everytime he sees him. But there’s a time for that, “Steve? You okay?”
All in all, he’d give himself 10/10 for planning, 10/10 for execution and like… 3/10 for the contents note itself. So it all averaged to something passable. Hopefully.
They spent the night under the blankets, talking. Every second of it, Tony made and remade his plans, backtracking Steve’s steps. In the end their talk turned around and came to them.
If Tony was asked if he was crying, then he would deny it, he was absolutely not crying! His glossy eyes and streaked face would perhaps say differently, “I want all that too. And so much more. And I always get what I want.”
“Oh my God! Language! Kids play this game,” Steve put his head right back into his hands, “Are always a human?”
Before he could lose whatever was left of his courage, Tony bent over and kissed the frog on top of his head.
He sags, “In the end it’s either because I can’t eat most of the things or because I get up at 3AM full of energy or because I like actual cat kibbles as a snack- It just gets too much and things fall apart and no one even sticks around for the benefits,” he scoffs.
Tony looked at him, calculating, “Well, you know we can send him back ourselves. We definitely do have the money for that, if the owners are already troubled.”
As he came back to himself, Steve realized he was shaking. His entire body trembling. He laid there, looking at the blue sky, the clouds passing by. He couldn’t bring himself to get up. He couldn’t bring himself to go in.
Steve stopped drinking, and smelled the water. That wasn’t it. He turned on the tap again, just in case. The water ran clear. Still, he dumped out the water in his glass, thirst replaced with a queasy feeling in his stomach.
Tony wants to say maybe Rogers saw into him that day, somehow knew Tony’s track record. The short and failed relationships. The bad decisions and the mistakes. Just how Tony failed to make any partner happy, failed to be enough so that they would stay...
When he makes it to the edge of Steve’s picket fence, the goose is already inside. Right at the door, sitting on the doormat with its face tucked under its wing, seemingly dead to the world. Once Tony opens the garden gate however, it starts screaming its little head off. And the door opens before Tony has any time to psych himself up.
