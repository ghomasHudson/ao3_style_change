Going out every day, seeing the hopelessness in the civilians’ eyes were devastating because the Avengers didn’t do their job right. And even as they walked out in full uniform with supplies and a willing hand, Steve always felt that underneath their despair was accusations for not doing more. Steve may be able to brush the thoughts aside, but facing that constant failure wore him down too.
Already, his mind was creating a hundred different scenarios and he moved forward slowly, eyes cataloguing the inventory of the ship, leaving Nebula behind with a fleeting thought. Spare metal was haphazardly stored away on one of the shelves; he had some nanites left from the fight, and he had done some research on Vision’s stone. He could scrap the holoscreen for his own use, and he was sure there was a sensor on this ship somewhere so that he could find the stones. If he knew the energy wavelength…Tony bit his lip, stopping in front of the dark screen. He reached out a hand to touch it, tilting it so that he could reveal the wiring in the back of the screen.
When all was said and done, the feathers looked all mottled, and there were streaks of white interspersed with black.
“Good, because I can’t, but my flying has been shit, so that’s how I know that I have missing feathers. And I can’t reach that, so you’ll have to tuck them under the muscle.”
“You neither, Tony,” Steve’s voice was barely above a whisper.
but he stopped himself just in time. He didn’t know whether the man knew.
“I said—” Fury started, but Steve interrupted him, “—I know what you said. But why? I died because of the Tesseract. You should have left it in the ice where it belonged.”
not talking about that either, or else I’m going to pull up that other time where you –“

“He could use some food and water,” Steve relayed to Tony. Tony turned around to get the supplies Tiny Steve requested, and Steve looked at his back longingly. So focused on staring at the man, he was not prepared for the onslaught of arousal that filtered into his mind, and it took all of his concentration to tamp down the sudden feeling and bulge in his pants.

“Come again?” Tony asked in disbelief, shouting over the wind. This blue police box could no way be a
for being cursed, and being jeered for being cursed was even worse than being jeered for being flightless. But at least he would have the opportunity to fight, and to die, for the country.
Tony sighed again and dropped his hands from his face. Nebula, although she was mostly machinery and looked as determined as ever, Tony still felt the underlying sense of exhaustion and haggardness underneath. Tony didn’t feel much better, and he was sure he looked worse than her. They cut down on food to preserve it as long as possible, but even though he had often forgotten to eat during his workshop binges, this conservation took it to an extreme level.
Rhodey ribbed him and sent him staggering sideways. Tony glared at his friend. “What did you do that for?”
It’s been years since he walked towards the science section of the Compound, but being there gave him a warm nostalgic feeling where not a week went by where Bruce or Tony exploded something in their labs. He missed this.
“No,” Tony corrected. “I said I hated the sound of Neil Degrasse Tyson’s holier-than-thou explanations of black holes.”
Tony pressed his hands against his eyes. No leads whatsoever in finding any signal of the Stones. He sighed tiredly.
The creature was adorable, and it took a lot of concentration and will for him not to melt under the cuteness of his clone. Steve hitched his shield behind him and looked at Tony.
He does lmao.
“Close your mouth, Tony,” Stevens ultimately said, laughing softly.

I still can’t believe that
“And you are,” Steve said breathlessly. He pressed wet lips behind the curve of Tony’s ear. “You make me happy.”
And he didn’t, even though Steve was sad when Thor replied solemnly, “Asgard is no more. My people are gone as well for Thanos has murdered them, so I will stay on Earth.”
What the world needed now were the Avengers to bring them out of this great loss, but the truth of the matter is, Steve…Steve couldn’t do it. He wasn’t a politician; he was a soldier. And he had no choice even though he felt so lost.
“But you were trying to spare yourself pain by not telling him.”
“Anything,” Steve replied.

“Yes, well, what Johann had originally was worse.” The man gave him a bland smile, and Tony crunched his nose with the thought.
However, indeed, the woman in front of him was an amazing one: strong, ambitious, determined. And supportive even though he was the weakest link out of the entire troop. She didn’t look at him with pity, for which Steve was grateful.
“Cap, what’s going on?” a cacophony of voices replied back, but Steve ignored them all.
As one, Steve and Tony moved closer to the cage, making sure that their movements were large and exaggerated and slow to signal that they weren’t there to hurt him.
Just as he was about to try again, squat down a little lower and looking at the keyhole, a distinctly British voice interrupted him. “Oi! What are you doing with my ship?”
Steve snorted through the last drying trails of tears on his face and strolled through his apartment filled with memories that made his heart ache. He shivered, and he realized for the first time that he was cold to the bone.
I’ve only accepted it to get the other guy off my back.
“Indeed.” Yinsen stripped the armor down, and Tony slithered inside. It was like a metal coffin, and Tony was trapped inside. The armor was much too heavy for him to move properly, and it stifled him. Every piece that Yinsen placed on him felt more and more like a coffin. His coffin.
“Trade secrets,” Tony said. He felt better now that food settled in his empty stomach, but his eyes also nearly shut under their own volition. However, he also saw the way Nebula looked unimpressed by his answer. Besides, now wasn’t the time to be cocky, so he amended, “I’m building an AI that could calibrate to the ship.”
Steve sobbed dryly. The sheer emotional rawness was too much, and he choked back a second sob. He saw Tony reaching over to spread something on his fingers, just before he pressed a digit against his asshole. It was too much, and emotions bubbled in his chest. Steve gasped wetly. “Don’t hold back, baby,” Tony said softly, slowly pushing in. “You can cry. I know it’s a lot to take it.”
him. It was as simple as that.
“Stevens?” Tony asked, walking back towards him.
Doesn’t know what he’s missing
Steve followed Tony back into the elevator.
“It was bad. I hurt Tony in the process. I had an inkling that Bucky killed his parents while he was still the Winter Soldier, but I didn’t know for sure, and Tony took it badly. He attacked both of us, but Bucky was my best friend! I couldn’t just let Tony kill him.”
Tony looks behind him and he bristles at the sight. Well, he bristles as much as he can with his already puffed-up fur.
Oh god, Yinsen. He was going to save him, and he was dead.
Kids shed feathers all over the place, and especially when they roughhoused each other. It wasn’t unusual to see a few feathers flying all over the place during recess.
Tony let out a litany of long, lewd moans of pleasure, feeling the finger fuck him. “Gimme another one,” he said, and Steve obliged, pressing another finger within him, stretching him sweetly and slowly. Tony drooled against the window. Two fingers wasn’t much for him as someone who fucked and regularly got fucked, but Steve’s fingers were another story: big, strong, fighter’s hands, but also artist’s hands, ready to hurt, but also ready to admire and love. And those fingers in his ass were definitely loving.

weapons, to cannibalize and repurpose them for the Jericho missile. He needed his weapons to build a better substitution for the thing in his chest.
“Where to?” Nebula asked, as the ship left the ground. They focused their gazes towards the open sky, leaving desolation behind.

Pepper, don’t worry, I’m doing my work. I just needed to get out of my office for a bit. (I’m definitely not avoiding my board meeting.)
Steve opened his eyes, staring at the man in front of him. Tony licked his lips, and his eyes followed the movement. “Man, you’re so gorgeous. That’s a good look on you.” Tony grabbed him again and took him down the corridor, opening the door.
Bucky made a noise of sympathy, patting him on the back. “I know buddy, I miss her too.”
“I know.” Those words sounded flat in his ears.
It was such a pity that Peggy wasn’t his soulmate; she would have been a perfect one too. No, the clock on his chest still ticked down slowly, week by week, seven days closer to seeing his soulmate for the first time. And he was still alive, although barely. He had someone to live for, but his body proved otherwise. Besides, the government needed bodies – if he could be one, he would gladly sacrifice his. Perhaps this pound of flesh would do its good deed for once.
Last time we were in the same room, Carol had to split us apart because he tried to murder me!
Natasha and Clint were off doing a SHIELD mission, Bruce was in his lab, and Thor was back at Asgard. Tony was thankfully in the middle of meetings, last Steve checked.
That was an understatement, but that was the best word Steve could come up with in his dumbstruck mind. The red and gold wings shone and glittered as he moved, flying with grace and speed. The occasions that the feathers caught the light, it cast a beautiful glow onto the ground.
And this was good, so good, so special, more than all the fucks that Tony ever had. He was doing this with the man he loved, a man who loved him back, and it was a lot to take in, to accept.
(And the way that the feather glinted unnatural under light, Steve understood that they
“Mini you is so cute!” Tony cooed, draping his body along Steve’s side. “I can’t stop staring at him.”
Steve tilted his head forward again, opening his eyes, mewling as Tony fucked him in earnest. It was too much for him, with the way that only Tony was the one who never looked at him like he was disgusting when he saw his wings. He touched them like they were the most beautiful things he had ever seen, and praised him like he was something worthy.
“Friday,” he called out absently, fingers digging into the mess of wires, “Start a new file project – “ Tony trailed off when he glanced up inadvertently and then remembered that he wasn’t in his workshop. No AI was installed on this ship. His face fell slightly, and his heart panged, feeling more lonely than ever. He shook his fingers loose from the wires and stepped back. “I guess I have to do it the old-fashioned way,” he muttered, moving to find paper and pen.
. “Get out, and we can do this the easy way. Stay here, and we’ll do this the hard way. Your choice.”

“You act like one though.” Tony grinned into his mug even though Rhodey wasn’t there to hear his final parting shot or see the upturn tick at the corners of his lips. Food sounded good, although he ignored the entire steaming plate of breakfast that Rhodey made for him and only grabbed the slice of buttered toast on his way out the door.
Yinsen reared back. “With your heart, and the fact that
So, Tony's sleeping lightly when the deadbolt unlocks and the handle turns, listening to the barely-there footsteps entering the room. The bed dips under Steve's added weight, and Tony can feel his heat emanating through the thin blankets.
“It was bad luck,” Steve whispered. “Didn’t want anyone to see what a freak I am.”
The sketch that Steve had left behind last time was still in his hand, staring back at him innocently. Tony exhaled. “What is this?” Tony asked dully. “What game are you playing at?”

“I wouldn’t try to shift if I were you,” the man warned, but the warning came too late as Tony closed his eyes and tried focusing on shifting. If he could do so, he would be able to heal faster.
“You probably insulted the department head,” Rhodey replied flatly. It was true, but Tony wouldn’t admit it. He scowled at Rhodey, who wasn’t even looking. Tony scowled harder at his back. “But even then, you’re usually never this late.”
Steve blushed. “I meant…”
“We’ve sent help,” Steve said desperately. “Help is coming.”
He had no plans, but he had his voice. “Let’s escape.” When he finally said it, it became something solid, a promise for Yinsen and for himself. Everything else would fall into place. Because it was for Yinsen’s sake, if not for his, that he should get him out of this hellhole.
“Because I need to get the weapons ready for Dad, and I have midterms to oversee tomorrow. Go back to your charging stations. I need to focus.” He spared a glance at the clock, and then he despaired and groaned out loud. “I can’t even go to bed tonight because you dumb idiots wasted my precious time to work.”
“Oh, and DUM-E!” Tony called out, looking past the pepper robot.
“You think he’s gone?”

Steve bit his lip. “What about his family?” he asked. He wasn’t sure if he wanted to know the answer because, even if he had only met them once, he still considered them as part of the Avenger’s family. And they took care of each other. But if they were gone, that was three more people dead because of the snap.

“No,” Bucky agreed. “But my baby sis cries every time she has to tell people that she doesn’t have wings, and it’s my job to be a good big brother and tell her that I love her anyway, flightless or not.”
Tony nodded in acknowledgement. “Then I’m going to put a pillow under you, make it easier for you. I’ll be right here, not going to leave the room, okay?”
“Hey Cap.”
Unable to tolerate the sinking spiral of depression that threatened to send him over the edge, Tony quickly resolved to find something to keep himself busy. Maybe another AI, one that would keep him company on their way home. He had more time on his hands now as they cruised in space, and his fingers itched to create just so his mind would not go insane. He rose up from his chair and leapt over the mess of papers on the floor, heading towards the box of scraps. With a little bit of wiring, a little bit of tweaking, Tony could create something from next to nothing.
“Everything, Tony,” Steve said, crying out loud when Tony sucked a bruise into his neck. His breath hitched, and he said again, “I want everything you give to me. All of it.”
Steve moves his head closer to Tony, then stops short when Tony moves back out between Steve’s paws and hisses. “I said, ‘Move closer to me,’” Steve repeats gently. “I can’t always protect you when you’re out here, so move to the tree that’s closer to Sam’s place.”
“And yet, I find myself unmoved by the hatred,” Pepper replied. “Go mingle. We need a minimum of five new sponsors tonight and I think you can get Fitzpatrick to commit to maybe 750k if you play your cards right. I’m off to make sure Bucky polished his arm for the photos the consulate staff paid for.”
Spoiler alert - It’s food poisoning
“And you! There will be no extermination tonight!”
DUM-E whined, rotating his claw and trapping himself even further on Butterfinger’s whisk. Tony growled, “Oh my God, DUM-E. What did I tell you?”
Stunned.
So he said hoarsely, not even a modicum of confidence in his words, “We rebuild. We are responsible for protecting Earth, so we do what we were tasked to do. We must go back out there and help those who need help.”
Tony wished he could feel the warmth from the other side of the barrier when he pressed back. He gritted his teeth and shook his head, trying not to convey the sense of hopelessness when he thought about the work back on the ship and the failed attempts at finding the Stones and Thanos. “It’s…not going well,” Tony admitted. “Our resources are dwindling, no leads on the Stones. We’re drifting in space.
With pleasure.
“He’ll be back, right? I saw the way he looked at you.” Rhodey stepped aside and let Tony through the door. “He’s most certainly attracted to you. And you brought him home to see your workshop. You never let anyone see your workshop.”
“You’re perfect too,” Tony said, pressing a kiss into Steve’s hair.
...My heart?
It was easy to fall into an easy focus where all paid attention to was his sketchbook in front of him; everything else around him died away. Still, he was a supersoldier, so he didn’t know how he missed a second presence in the living room until there was a black feather that appeared into his vision. Steve looked at it in dread: that was his feather.
taken his back brace off in public because it was better not to show what his wings truly looked like. He took a step back and gulped.
“I’ve got your meals,” Deborah said, bustling in with three plates.

“Rocket came back with a ring for Gamora. Peter didn’t know whether to strangle him or kiss him.” Nebula huffed in amusement, and Tony was hit with yet another pang at the mention of “ring.”
“Mister Stark,” Yinsen said worriedly, coming over to help him.
He never expected his ma to let out a little scream of horror, eyes widening in shock, before she covered her mouth with her hands, stifling the sound that came out of her mouth. But already the damage had been done, and Steve’s wings wilted.
He slipped back into unconsciousness.
a werewolf, there was no telling whether he would be alive or dead. He bit his lip. It was horrifying to know that fact.
Steve broke the silence first. “I was worried that I wasn’t good enough for you,” Steve admitted, looking at the floor length windows ahead of him. “That day, I don’t know if you remember, when you asked me if I said something. I said that I wasn’t good enough for you.”
He whizzed off, leaving the second bot to chase after him excitedly.
Apparently none of you have any confidence in my cooking abilities - well too bad, he's coming to the tower and my food will be great.
You must have not been able to find a real man, cuz really, stark? you traded me for a fucking playboy?
“Whoa there, it’s just JARVIS.” Tony lifted the helmet to eye level. “He’s a…non-human being, a bit of my handler and…oh, he’s a friend. Nothing to fear, and JARVIS? Yes, engage.”
Tony groaned under his breath. He just wanted to check the thing out – it wasn’t like he’s seen a police box before.

Logically, he knew that it was important to be prepared. He looked ahead, out into the vast multi-colored galaxy. Under other circumstances, Tony would have found the view pretty, the golden, blue, and magenta hues illuminating the universe, brightly colored white stars glowing brightly, not unlike the images NASA had taken with their satellites. But the situation was dire. No help would be coming for them, not in this corner of this forsaken galaxy. There would be no Avengers to have his back this time.

Steve said softly, “Just rest Ma.”
“Pepper has never, not once, let me do things in my own time when she thinks I’m being an idiot,” Tony smiled. “Can’t say I’m upset with her, though.”
First his ma, now the good Doctor who saved his life.
“You know, you look familiar,” the man said, but with Tony so focused on the TARDIS in front of him, he sounded as if he was far away.
Stevens looked like a deer in headlights. “Umm…” he stammered, his cheeks staining red. But he gave a tense nod.
It was Tony who broke the silence first. “How’s Pepper and Rhodey?”
Stevens was. It was attractive, that mystery, and Tony couldn’t help but lean forward into Stevens’s space. Tony wanted him.

Butterfingers said happily, tilting his whisk up and down.
“Right?” Tony looked up at his friend, and there he was, fighting a smile. Tony scowled. “What now?”
“What happened?” Steve asks, finally calming down for the most part, though giggles still spill out from his mouth at random moments.
“Who are you?” Steve asked.
Can’t believe Cow Boy traded me in for Tiny Stark over there. Guy is like 3 feet tall
“Whew, that was a trip,” Tony said, releasing the catch on his helmet. He looked at Steve’s worried face. “EMP, shorted out my wings.”
Stevens nodded miserably. “He’s mad because I’ve ‘been sad,’ his words.”

Before Tony can open his mouth, their sweet moment is interrupted by a shrill yell of Clint, and they look over to see Clint’s nose buried between his paws and Natasha walking away back towards her human who is standing at the edge of the field. Besides her human stood Sam and Clint's human, all calling them by name.

Steve’s heart ached in pain, and his eyes burned with unshed tears. The first words that came out of his mouth were hoarse and raw. “What’s wrong with my wings ma?”
His chest was raw with agony as he watched the dirt pile on top of the casket. There were no tears left to cry, but still his soul wept with pain. Bucky stood beside him, giving him silent support with his arms around his shoulders and holding him up when his legs gave out.
Indeed it did, when Steve peered in through the driver’s window. Stolen SHIELD tech had outfitted the interior of the car.
LMAO HE JUST SAID “HIS OWN CHILD” OMG and asshole DIDNT EVEN NOTICE
The wind battered against his naked back, rippling through his wings. He shuddered hard.
“I didn’t know that Bucky hurt Howard and your mother, not for sure. Back then, I only had an inkling that something happened between Bucky and Howard,” Steve finally said. Good. Tony felt less guilty when Steve defended himself. “I didn’t want to tell you before I could say for sure.”
“Protocol six?” Steve asked.
Steve looked at his wings in the mirror everyday and hated them. He didn’t know why he stared at them: punishment, perhaps, for molting them black? Penance? Steve wasn’t sure, but he looked at them and gritted his teeth.
Tony opened his eyes, facing his doom, except Cap was…
DUM-E tilted his claw up and down in an approximation of a wave, and he began to move off his charging station.
“This is yours, isn’t it,” Tony said softly. “No one else has black feathers.”
“And it looks like you failed your job.”
Stevens shook his head. “I wish I could. I want to, but you know too much already, and the more I stay, the more danger the timelines will be.” Stevens gathered Tony up into his arms, clinging onto him almost desperately, like there was some loss that Stevens wasn’t telling him. “Thank you, so much, for the fun day.”
Tony Stark, Iron Man, was perfect, and it left Steve flatfooted and breathless watching him fly and fight, while he himself scaled up buildings with a superhuman speed and fought beside his new teammates.
With all the intent of moving quickly across campus and back into the warmth of his house so that he could work on his thesis and not drink himself to an unintended engineering binge, he still couldn’t have missed it.
Suffice to say, in those two years, Tony barely slept as his nightmares took hold and guilt wracked his body. But never had Tony dreamed about a

Clint nodded.
And it felt so wrong too. Tony spun around. “Do you?” he asked aggressively. “Do you really? I don’t see it.”
It’s FINE. DUM-E’s on permanent fire extinguisher duty.
She stopped, sighed, anger deflating but grief still palpable on her face. “I know I will never defeat him myself no matter how many times I try, but I will die facing him so that no one else will have to suffer the same fate as we did.”

“Put us down?” Tony asked. Steve nodded, and he floated them gently to the ground. Steve clung to Tony, breathing hard. Tony stroked his back, stroking his wings. “I’m so proud of you.”
A bit later—showered, caffeinated, slightly sobered, and tucked safely into his massive king-sized bed—Tony checked his phone, only to see that last text he sent to Steve.

The first pluck felt good. All he did was reach over and snapped a primary feather off the coat of broken wings, seeing it fall into his hands like the broken thing it was. He did it again, and then again.
Tony’s highly sensitive ears picked up the breaths of the man in front of him, standing still, like he was waiting. Tony himself wasn’t a patient man, and it was hard for him to stay still, hardly breathing.
Should I lean in for the kiss now?
“Yeah,” Steve said, poking at his own burger with disinterest. “How about your ma and your sis?”
But Tony knew, even if Steve didn’t know himself. “Relax,” he instructed as he started moving, drawing out until only the tip was in his ass, “this is supposed to feel good.”
So even though they sat out there again, watching as the day slowly turned to night, the warmth of his joy easily chased away the cold.
But in his dreams, Tony was right there in front of him. His back was turned, but still, he looked amazing with the gentle brown curls sitting atop his head and the way that his black tank top hugged his body.

Tears began to trail down the corners of Steve’s eyes. “We’re coming to find you,” he begged, voice cracking in the middle of his sentence. Steve clung to him, holding him as tightly as he dared, as if he could singlehandedly grip him down and keep him for forever. “Just hold on a little longer.”

“What’s on your mind, Stevie?”
“Here.” Tony reached past his body and took hold of his wing muscles with both hands, stroking them softly. The heat that emanated from Tony’s hand to the muscles were overwhelming, and Steve shuddered hard, letting out a soft moan when Tony continued to stoke his wings. He hardened in his pants. “There we go, relaxed.”
“I don’t deserve happiness,” Tony mumbled, shaking his head. “I’ve killed people.”
“Hey guys,” Steve said, switching his gaze between the both of them.
In the aftermath of unimaginable tragedy, the universe was quiet, mourning the loss of her people. In the wake of silence, dust settled to the ground, revealing carnal destruction: tall buildings leveled, human-less cars piled up in the middle of street corners, and people just standing there in the middle of the wrecked street, dazed, confused, horrified. It was almost unfathomable to imagine that just one snap could instantaneously change a whole world.
“It’s going to be better,” he promised himself, and then he poured the bottle of bleach over his wing muscles, letting the liquid seep down into his feathers.
He, dare he say,
Tony bounded up the stairs, nearly slipping when his foot caught a patch of black ice. Only Stevens’s grip held him up and he smiled his thanks. “I just really hope my bots didn’t destroy anything while I was gone. They usually are pretty good about that. I’m home!”
Rhodey gave him a flat stare. “Because it’s you, Tones,” he pointed out. “Only you would be drunk and engineer something crazy from our bathroom. You don’t even remember that night.”

“Good thinking, friend Steven!” Thor’s voice boomed.
...the most gorgeous man he had ever met. Even in the dim light, he could see the blue eyes looking back at him. He wore the “dirty soldier” look much too well; there was a streak of sweat running down his face.
Once the doors were finally shut, he hitched his coat closer to himself and burrowed into his scarf. It’s been ten seconds since he left the Maclaurin Buildings, and he could already feel cold nipping his bare nose. He turned around, fighting against the weather as he struggled to put one foot in front of the other.
When he couldn’t bear to see his wings anymore, he put them back into his back brace, hiding them from view, from himself and the world.

Steve, as if in a trance, picked up the beeping box. It wasn’t a piece of Stark tech, that was for sure. It fit the palm of his hand, and Steve brushed away the dust on it. There was only one button and a fading small screen, like it was dying.
Peggy argued, “They’re just a tool, Steve. An extra appendage. You shouldn’t believe in superstition.”
Rhodey snorted. “Come on, you can introduce me to him.”

“Besides,” Bucky said in a conspiratorial voice, “I love seeing the excitement on her face when I take her out flying. I get to hold her and fly with her. Wouldn’t be able to do that if she had wings.”
“I’m sorry Sarah turned out to be a bit unhinged,” Tony grimaced.
“Did you get everyone, Rumlow?” someone asked. American. Tony’s eyes snapped open, but all he could see was the wall on the other side of the cavern. He didn’t know where Yinsen was, but considering that the voice seemed unconcerned, it mostly likely meant that Yinsen was dead.
Tony turned and stomped away, anger boiling within him. But he didn’t go far; he couldn’t really walk away – he just had to know the truth. “I cared about you, Steve!” Tony burst out, still facing away. He couldn’t bear to see the man who had hurt him so much. “Friends don’t do this! I would have liked to know about this!”
“Was that what you were hiding all this time?” Clint snarked, coming over to examine it further, looking past his shoulder. “A fully usable pair of wings under your baggy shirts? Man, I feel so cheated. You could have done so much more than be a flightless supersoldier.”
sympathetic because he hadn’t stopped thinking about Stevens - his ass in particular - since he saw him by the TARDIS and this reminder of competition was unwelcome. But before Tony could speak up, Stevens mumbled into his plate, “He told me that he was sick of me moping and that I should get rid of it before he would allow me to come back…” The rest of the sentence was too low and unintelligible to hear, but Tony found himself grinning like a lunatic.
“Jericho!” the Alpha growled at him, eyes flashing red.
The smell of bleach were more potent than ever when he uncapped the lid, his sense of smell more powerful than before. Steve wrinkled his nose at the smell, but he endured it, stepping into the shower.
“Gladly,” Stevens replied, returning Tony’s excitement, and followed Butterfingers and Tony.
“Chill man, it’s right here,” Rhodey said fondly, pouring coffee into his empty mug. “Although I really shouldn’t be feeding your caffeine addiction. What you really need is sleep.”
That taken care of, Steve could focus on studying the room, noting the bubbling tanks, the glass cages, electronic equipment, and piles of paperwork strewn all around the room. Steve carefully walked around the room, making sure nothing jumped out at him. There was a blinking console at the center of the room – Steve marked that as something that Tony should take care of.
Tony stepped backwards one stumbling length at a time until he hit the wall, the music taking Tony back to his childhood.  These songs replaced the quietness, and Tony sagged down, letting the music wash over his weary body. For all its cheeriness, Tony couldn’t bring himself to feel more light-heartened, just overwhelmed by the loss and numb from the pain. For all the work he had done, it still wasn’t enough to face Thanos.
“She, not it,” the man corrected. “And it’s certainly possible. Think about it. Why is this police box here? Where did it come from?”

“Is that all you can say Steve? For two years, I had dreams of you killing me in that HYDRA bunker, over, and over, and over, and over…” Tony’s voice trailed off. “At least with that, I expected your anger. I was angry too.”

“Presently, Captain. Would you like to include a note?”
“Wow,” Steve breathed.
“You’re touching them right now,” Tony remarked dryly.
His ma wasn’t happy that his translucent wings turned to something colorful when he finally came of age for it to molt; she looked terrified when she looked at them. He knew that, with the way Sarah looked at them, his wings weren’t something to be proud of, no matter how beautiful he initially thought they were.
Bruce came over with a Q-tip, encouraging Tiny Steve to do a swab test. “He didn’t need any water like Octopus Tony, does he?”
Bucky sat on the rickety dining chair and asked between bites of his burger, “Are you okay?”
Butterfingers asked. Tony swung around.
They reached for each other and clung together, kissing desperately. With every touch that Tony imparted on his skin, Steve felt like there was a fire burning within his veins. He whined, parting his lips so that Tony attacked his mouth, craving every bit of him like a dying man.
Tony took a step back, and he crashed ungainly into a figure. Tony turned.
Hottie: I actually love cooking
Tony shook it.
Tony whined softly, and he nodded in eagerness, staring, captivated as those hands traced the inside of his thighs. “You’re—” he began, trailing off as Steve leaned forward and mouthed his cock, still covered by his pants. He was leaking in his pants like a teenager, and he would be embarrassed by it, but the man below him was more than distracting.
He took a quick glance behind him, making sure that no one was noticing that he was about to (illegally) break into a police box. Satisfied with the lack of attention, he turned back to crouch in front of the lock, taking out his lock pick set from his bag. It was something he always carried with him since he had a tendency to forget his keys or get locked out of his own labs by Rhodey.
Tony’s having more fun than he’ll admit.
But usually when
“Why do you hang out with me?” Steve finally asked during lunch one day.
He was avoiding Tony because he was sure the next time he saw him, he wouldn’t be able to jump at his bones, and he couldn’t have him. There was an aching in his heart. He wanted Tony so badly, but he couldn’t do that to Tony, no matter how much he loved him. Keeping Tony alive was more important than his happiness.
“He wasn’t trying to kill us. He was only trying to scare us.” Yinsen turned to Tony. “Are you okay?”
👏 Truly *EGG*-cellent
Shit, I definitely spilled butter and cheese all over myself.
Steve pressed his forehead against Tony’s shoulder.
Steve heaved.
OUT THE DOOR LIKE A SHOT

“And you’re the backup?” Steve asked. When she nodded, he said disbelievingly, “But you’re the only one.”
Steve gaped, and there was a gnawing at the pit of his stomach. He was so careful. “Give it back,” he said, strangled.
“Weather’s worse,” Tony said again, and they walked to Deborah’s café. There really was nothing to it. Bad cables, perhaps, but nothing they should be worried about. The smell of delicious heavenly coffee invaded his nose, and he inhaled deeply, cherishing the love of his life. Then, his eyes trailed over to the table in the corner, unbidden.
“You say something?” Tony came back with a bottle of water and a granola bar.
“Okay,” Steve said softly, voice hitching, watching through his tears as Tony moved away for a moment. With his touches gone, he was bereft, and fresh tears began to leak out of his eyes again.
“Nothing.” Tony broke off his stare, but his friend looked in the same direction that he was looking at. “Stop, it’s nothing.”
He was surprised that his heat hadn’t come on - surely his body would have succumbed to it. It felt like he had been in the cave long enough to have had one. But when Tony brought it up tentatively to Yinsen, Yinsen shrugged.
Travel size for my convenience
“Yes sir.”
Tony blinked. “On a first date?”
indeed exhausted from his binge. Before his head hit the pillow, he was asleep.
Tony breathed, pressed back against Steve’s cheek, turned blindly and kissed him. And Steve kissed him back, all lips and tongue and heat and passion. “Okay, move.”
The Alpha barked, and two soldiers came forward. They picked Tony up between them, ignoring the way Tony struggled. He needed to shift, get away from all of this…
Tony held his breath, but the man continued knowingly, “You flashed your eyes at me.”

“J, let’s copy the files to our server and delete the rest. Blow this popsicle stand when you’re done,” Tony said through his helmet before he spotted Steve and approached him.
The man gave him a bland smile, but he didn’t move his hand away. “Extenuating times call for extenuating circumstances,” he said. “I may not be pack, but my touch helped calm you down.”
“What did they do?”
“Fuck, Tony,” Steve said. “You’re...fuck...you’re gorgeous. I’m so glad I get to have you.”
Steve smiled at Tony and placed a sweet but lingering kiss on his lips. “Just a thank you, I think, JARVIS.”
“Natasha,” Steve said, looking over at her, where she sat by herself on the bean bag.

“Back brace too,” Doctor Erskine said, looking at the brace that held his wings back.
It’s called an upgrade. At least he listens to me.
They’re in their zone.
Because you’re Captain America, all-American hero, perfect human. I always thought you had a reason to hide your wings, but I never thought that you weren’t good enough for me. I’m just a mechanical flighted human.”
With followers like you, who needs haters.
Tony scrambled up to his feet. “What does he want?” Tony asked.
“Yeah,” Steve leaned down and mouthed Tony’s nipple. “If I do my job right, that stops now.”
Steve nodded tightly, trying to force his wings into place. Tony cupped his cheek. “Relax. It’ll come naturally.”
Steve looked at Bucky with blind panic. Bucky stood there, stock-still, staring at the black feather with unreadable eyes. Then he looked up and eyes aimed at Steve.
And Steve always wanted everything from Tony: the dark marks on his skin testified to that. Even though Extremis healed the bruises and marks that Steve left upon his skin, Steve always made more to replace them. Tony shivers when he feels the brush of Steve's lips upon his neck, drawing a line of fire in its wake. He moans when teeth pierces the skin of his collarbone, helpless to every cruel bite that Steve makes.
“Yeah, that one, and I had the disguise on, so she didn’t know who I was, which was actually the problem, because she spent the whole meal telling me how awful our team was.”
The man chuckled, looking amused. Tony was disgruntled that the man didn’t even play along with his obvious lie. “Okay.”

And he sure was very good at extermination.
The camera tipped down in sadness. “
Steve jolted at the new voice, and he automatically reached for his shield before remembering that it wasn’t on his person. He turned sharply, looking at the intruder who appeared out of nowhere –
With that voice, he was helpless to obey, and he came in his pants, shuddering through his orgasm.

“You’re back?” Tony asked. His voice was gravely with sleep, and Tony stroked Steve’s chest. There was less heat to it; it was more of a soft, protective caress, and Steve felt warm.
Tony tried again. “DUM-E?”
“By choice?”
The knowledge that Tony had given him certainly felt like rocket science (it probably was, considering that it was Tony), but at least Steve can repeat everything word for word to Bruce.
She watched him in silence until he was finished with the bottle before she said, “We should begin working on a plan to find Thanos. The longer we wait, the reversal process would have worse consequences.”
He didn’t know whether being out here in space was worse or better than Afghanistan. On one hand, he was not being tortured at the hands of his enemies. There were no life threatening hole in his chest or the dire situation of drowning or the pressure to create weapons. On the other hand, being out here in the vast nothingness had its own problems because there was no escape. The ship was its own prison cell, merely sustaining him but providing nothing to distract him from the gravity of the situation that they were in. Back then, he had something to look forward to when he escaped: Rhodey, Pepper, Happy, America. This time, there was no promise that he could do the same because out here in the unknown, the enemy was nature.
For five minutes they were silent on their walk back to Tony’s place, but those five minutes were the longest in Tony’s life. For one, ever since he placed his hand in Stevens’s palm, he could feel the addictive warmth through his glove, and it felt safe. Warm, solid. And the man was beautiful, even if he was off his rockers sometimes.
“What we have now is terrible,” Tony grumbled, grimacing. If he had to listen to that song one more time at one of his mother’s balls, he was going to cause a riot. It was the
Make that once a week.
The prison doors opened with a mighty bang, and one of the Alphas flew in. Tony’s fingers were still gripping onto the chestplate, and it was much too late to hide his project from them. The Alpha looked at Tony, eyes glowing ruby red, and snarled under his breath. His teeth were elongated, protruding out of his mouth, and Tony was frozen in place.
“I’ll be with you all the way,” Tony promised, pulling back. His lips were red and swollen from their kisses (every single one of them continued to bring Steve to his knees), and Steve was sure that he didn’t look much better. “Ready?”
Steve didn’t know what he should be guilty more for: hurting Tony after reciprocating his kiss, or being selfish for reciprocating that kiss. If he was entirely honest with himself, it was both.
And perhaps dying was easy too.
And this time, he wasn’t the small, skinny boy, falling down after every punch but still getting back up again. No, this time he was the big guy, one of the strongest men and enhanced by science, and he used his strength to
“We really need to get down to how they’re getting our DNA. This is getting out of hand.”
“Fine, but only because I like you,” Tony replies, turning back around and letting Steve groom his fur. “But only where my fur is sticking up.”
his soulmate. Steve never thought that it would be the complete opposite, that his soulmate would fight him at every turn and decision.
Slowly but surely, the armor formed piece by piece. It hung in the darkest corner of their prison, away from prying eyes. The shell of Jericho laid strewn on the table so that when their captors peered in, they would see that Tony was working on what they wanted.
“He’s only summoned by my safeword. I’ll add yours, too. Wait, do you have a safe word? Are you into things that require safewords? I have so many questions, and I-”
Tony knew
Steve pulled away with an obscene “pop” and stood up, gathering Tony into his strong arms and kissing him. Steve tasted bitter with the taste of Tony’s come, but combined with Steve’s own scent, it was glorious.
Tony whispered, “Who are you?”
“Please,
“Give me another one,” Steve sobbed, “I need it, please.”
With one smooth motion, Steve throws off the covers, revealing Tony's nakedness. Because he doesn't get clothes anymore either; Steve owns him entirely, heart, mind, soul.
PROLOGUE
“Thanks,” Stevens said softly. “I had a lot of fun today. I know you’re busy.”
Another day of work, repairing what was broken, but Steve couldn’t help but think back and replay the conversation over and over in his head. Out there, the people needed them to do their job, and they collected the bodies of the dead, righted up what they could, leaving what they couldn’t. They marked the dead in mass gravestones, too many to count, not enough bodies to match the names. At the end of the day, Steve stared up at “James Buchanan Barnes,” blinking back tears because the pain was still raw and hurting.

Tony nodded vigorously. “I once built a suit out of a box of scraps in a cave. This time, I have a ship. I built an AI with scraps. The least I can do is to get us home.” Then, he looked at Nebula, honey brown eyes intense with perseverance. “I can do this. We’re going to Earth, and I’m going to need an extra set of hands to help me create the things we need to get them.”
“I actually don’t know. I’m an artist, not a scientist. I can’t tell you much about the science behind the Time Rotor or the different ways the TARDIS breaks four dimensions, or anything about that. That’s the Doctor’s job. What I can tell you is that the TARDIS is beautiful and very able. She travels in time and space, and it’s so amazing how capable she is as a ship.”
Steve wished it was an accident when he said, “Yes, JARVIS. Take me down, please.”
New York was…different. New, unfamiliar, timely. He felt untethered as he stood there in the middle of what had to be Times Square, looking at all the…newness of what should have been a familiar city.
“I didn’t mean to hurt you.”
“Is he even a supersoldier?”
“Fine, half of us. But still, we couldn’t defeat Thanos at our best. What makes you think we can defeat him when our forces are depleted? Not to mention, he has all the Stones, so he could kill us with a snap of his fingers.”
Stevens’s eyes were piercing when they stared at him. “What do you think?”
Tony squirrel likes it! Look at his face!
No? Well, here's the second chapter that
He’s home. He didn’t know how, but the ship landed onto familiar soil. He felt weak, he was emaciated, he held sanity by a thread, but still, somehow, his broken body managed to conjure a tear for the sheer relief of being home.
“Yeah, okay,” he mumbled. “Thanks.” He got up, walked to the cockpit, and sat in one of the seats. He felt numb and passive, looking out the window to see the stars shining and waiting listlessly as the ship cruised towards the outpost. Somehow, despite the feeling of intangibility the dream, he still remembered the images crystal clear in his mind’s eye, and he latched upon it, directing his thoughts inwards.

The breeze picked up, sending the leaves flying into the air as they walked home. Steve shivered, clutched his jacket tighter around himself. He was numb - as much as he fought for justice, he couldn’t fight Death. He was grateful that Bucky was there in silence; he didn’t want to talk, not right now.
“Oh, fuck off!” came the brazen reply.
“Last time it was interesting they cloned me,” Tony retorted. “Let’s hope they didn’t do something similar this time.”
And his world faded to white.
“Lunch.”
have to do it. I’m not even professor material.”
You’re right. I’ve done nothing in my life. I’m a nobody 🤷
He said, “That’s not an excuse not to eat.”
A shallow shudder of the ship landing startled Tony out of his thoughts, but what he expected to look outside was not this: a city laid to waste, not unlike the way Titan was destroyed. The decrepit outpost was devoid of any lifeforms or resources, soot settled on every available surface. What was not covered by the blackened area was streaked with dried blood.
“What’s this?” Yinsen asked curiously.
“I know you’re scared, but the view is worth it,” Tony said in his ear.
“I feel like you’re always sorry,” Tony said tiredly. Steve nodded, clenched his teeth.
Because they both had a promise to keep, and Steve wouldn’t let him go again.
The squirrel is now trying to steal my man. Steve, stop feeding the squirrel! OMG, I swear, don’t give it junk food; it’s bad for them! Also, think of the diseases it could carry.
“I like the burn,” Tony said, pushing back against the fingers and fucking himself more desperately. He was so deliciously desperate, and to be honest, while he loved Steve’s fingers, he wanted Steve’s cock in him three years ago. “Actually forget the finger, I want your cock. Please, Steve, I’m begging you, please fuck me until I forget my name.”
Because while there were some people in society that didn’t have wings, those people were few and far between, considered freaks because they didn’t have wings.
They stopped for a late lunch, and Stevens somehow made a killer spaghetti and meatballs with the items he found around the kitchen. Tony didn’t even know that he owned half the things that Stevens collected from his various cupboards, but once he put his fork into his mouth, all thoughts flew out of his head.
Tony shook his head. “All of us were to blame, and we need to own up to it. Yes, we were wiped out, but we also need to stay strong for the sake of the rest of humanity. Because if we don’t, there’s no hope left.”

I really need better friends.
Steve blushed, because those plans included ravishing Steve, which they had been doing before they were interrupted by the Avengers klaxon. “Less chatter guys,” Steve said instead. He wanted to go home as soon as possible too, be fucked out of his mind again and again, have Tony stroke his wings and groom him until he was completely gone and blissed out. But before that could happen, he had to focus on the task first. “Iron Man, please see if there is a way to turn off the bots collectively, so that we don’t have to defeat each on individually.”
He reached blindly behind him, wrapping his arm around Steve’s head, and he dragged himself up, leaning his head back against those strong shoulders. “
“And you can get a zero if you don’t turn it in right now.” Tony made a point by picking up the papers on his desk and neatening the stack with a thump against the table. Needless to say, the student slunk forward and submitted the exam. “Good, now you won’t have a zero even if you didn’t finish it.”
“Can I blow you?” Steve asked, staring up at Tony. His hands roamed up and down Tony’s thighs, a possessive and warm hold that made Tony feel utterly owned and helpless.
Steve nodded, and he relaxed his wing muscles. Tony pressed his entire length against Steve’s, and then he fell back again, taking Steve with him.
He shook his head. “I need to finish this,” Tony replied. “I’m going stir-crazy in here.”
It looked ominous. “What?” Steve said defensively.
“Can I be of some assistance, sir?”
“Black wings are bad luck,” she said into his ear. “They remind people of death. Don’t ever show anybody your wings.”
Bruce shook his head. “I’ve been taking cat naps during diagnostics, but I’m working overtime to see if I can get Fury’s communicator boosted up with a stronger signal. I’ll be fine though.”
Tony punched the bot with his gauntleted fist, and the mic cut out with static. Steve’s stomach fell to the floor as Tony fell out of the sky, falling towards him in an ungraceful, uncontrolled, tumbling heap, as if Tony lost control of his flight controls.
Tony didn’t have the energy to muster up the spirit that she had, but he understood her desperation. After all, he made Ultron for the sake of humanity, to protect Earth so that when the Avengers faced a foe greater than they could handle, Earth’s people would have had something to protect them. Even if their approaches were different, her style more offensive that his, he understood her.
“Yeah, so that’s why you look so smitten.” Rhodey threw his arm over Tony’s shoulder and considered him. “Doesn’t he seem too old for you?”
“For now it is,” Stevens said. “It’s impossible now because the tech doesn’t exist yet.”
, Steve thought, watching Tiny Tony drag himself forward, sucking and unsucking himself with his tentacles.
It just happened. Steve reached out blindly and smacked Archie hard in the face so that he went with a grunt. But the teasing stopped, the words dying in their throats. Blood spurted out of Archie’s nose, and Steve should feel sorry about it.
“It’s more than that, Captain. The Tesseract has gone awry.”
Hands cleaned, Steve stepped into the ring where Natasha awaited. As one, they settled into the default fighting stance, balancing their weight at the balls of their feet, ready to pounce at a moment’s notice. Their hands were out, body turned slightly away from each other, and Steve watched Nat like a hawk. After so long, they were attuned to each other’s quirks and styles, but it never helped when Natasha lashed out like a cheetah when Steve least expected it. It was a game between them, waiting to see who would break the waiting and concentration first.
OMG THE PAN IS ON FIRE
And sometimes, Tony fell in the same way Rhodey fell, the armor’s power cut mid-flight as the shield sliced cleanly through all the power sources in the armor. Tony fell like a fallen angel, arms stretched out as gravity took its hold and hurtled him uncontrollably to the ground.
Stevens looked flabbergasted and wide-eyed, not unlike a deer in headlights. “But I didn’t order breakfast,” he stammered.
Watching a couple on what looks like a terrible first coffee date at the table next to me. Dude is a very pretentious self-involved writer.

“What are you doing?” the man asked. His voice was a rich, deep baritone, and Tony fell in love just a little bit more.
The park. Really?
“Pretty sure I got it.” Tony could feel a presence in front of him now, and he squeezed his eyes tighter. He let out a shallow breath.
Tony nodded. He put a bounce to his step, dragging Stevens behind him. He was going to pretend that nothing was wrong, for his sake. Besides, he wasn’t privy to that conversation. Not yet, at least.
Seemingly absent of thought, Steve nodded, and at Bucky’s persistent prodding, he finally took a bite of his burger. It tasted like ash in his mouth, but he chewed it anyway.
He could do this, acclimate to a new life, wrangle and understand the new technology that had evolved while he was dead, and learn everything new that had happened during the past seventy years.
They walked through the city with careful steps, pieces of rubble crunching underneath their shoes. Nothing was spared by the fire. “We made the wrong choice,” Tony said. “We’re not…we’re not going to get home. We don’t have enough fuel.”

“Coffee,” he finally decided, and he made a beeline towards the coffee pot.
“They’re…” Natasha swallowed and cleared her throat before she tried again, “I couldn’t find them. It’s highly that they’re dead. Snapped. But it’s Clint, Steve. We can’t just leave him alone out there. I’m going after him.”
Didn’t mean he had to like it. But then again, when did he get what he wanted?
tig: AND WE'RE BACK (after 6 months)! As usual, huge thanks to my buddies neb and kait for being amazing collaborators, and anoo for being an amazing intern, and thank you so much to you readers for being so supportive as well as suggesting prompts!
Tony huffed. “Fine. Just this once.” Aluminum foil was good for cleaning out gunk in his metal projects, but they were also good for pet robots who enjoyed destroying things a little bit too much. He had balls of them laying around his workshop, and so he picked one off from off his desk and tossed it in the air.
However, he still couldn’t stop a small wave of disappointment of realizing that the ship and the man would probably be gone in the morning.
“I—” Tony hesitated, “—I feel it. It can’t be though. It can’t be real.”
They were silent for a moment, letting silence settle over them.
“Hello son,” Captain America said lightly, as if he couldn’t hear the roiling thoughts that were running through Tony’s mind. The gravitas of this whole situation wasn’t there. He looked at him a moment longer, before he asked, “You’re Tony Stark, right? Many people are looking for you. I’m here to take you home.”

The other kids whispered “freak” under their breaths too, shying away from him when he looked at them.

a howl that was abruptly cut off. Then, the acrid stench of too much warm blood filled his nose, and it took all of his self-control not to gag aloud. Tony closed his eyes, trying not to imagine what he thought had just happened.
“You’re wearing too much,” Tony complained, wrapping his fingers around Steve’s tux and unbuttoning them with clumsy fingers. “I want to see you.”
“Yeah, that sounds pretty apt.”
Yinsen frowned, but he didn’t push. “Okay,” he finally said. “What do you need me to do?”
“Let it all out, baby,” Tony said lovingly. “It’s okay, cry as much as you want. It’s overwhelming, I’m sure.”

Tony snorted. “Who’s winning?”
Steve gasped: he had a full set of wings again, the wings that he hated so much, that he bleached and plucked and cried over, the wings that promised death to anyone who encountered them.
“Can you do that?” Nebula asked, skeptical. “We barely have anything on the ship.”
“Oh my god,” Tony whispered in horror, stumbling out of the ship. “Did Thanos do this?”
“Steve,” Tony whispered.
Tony looked even more than hell between the time Steve saw him to now. His face was gaunt, pale, exhausted, and his body hunched inwards into himself. Unconsciously, Steve lifted his arms up when Tony staggered forward, as if he couldn’t hold himself up anymore.
Until Rhodey decided to continue., “Or remember that other time when you created Butterfingers out of a whisk and plunger because you were drunk engineering like usual?”
So lost in his thoughts, he nearly crashed into someone.

“Yeah,” Tony replied, burying himself into his coat. “Shall we?”

“Okay,” Fury conceded and nodded decisively. “You’ll have your wish. We’ll get you settled into civilian life.”
“Yeah, about the physiological effects of stress and burnout on people’s bodies,” Steve responded before he asked JARVIS to start the Audible file where he’d left off.
He just needed to avoid him.
“No, the one about the student debt crisis,” Steve said. “She took issue with your idea that college wasn’t for everyone.”
He took his shirt off.
As if Stevens was just one note off in a perfect symphony. Indeed, Stevens was amazing, but Tony recalled the very first conversation he had with him, all those days ago when they stood in front of the TARDIS, and Tony got the impression that Stevens was something else.
“You got it, Cap.”
Every single thing Hottie mentions Asshole “did that one time, with my buddy” and is an expert in
But Steve stood there, his golden locks shining under the red glow of the room, merely a few steps away, and Tony only had to stretch his arm partially to feel the tangibility of the man in front of him. But he didn’t, not yet at least. He didn’t know whether it was that fragile, tentative hope he had within himself that he could still have him eventually, or self-punishment that he didn’t have him that stopped Tony from reaching out to the man in front of him. His throat burned, and his heart constricted tightly in his chest. He both loved and hated the man in front of him.
When he stumbled into his bed back at the Compound, he clutched the cell phone in his hand, cradling it in between his palms, wishing desperately that it was Tony himself.

It took Fury less than thirty seconds to acquire the back brace that Steve requested. Once the familiar clinging pressed against his wings, Steve finally settled.
He looked down at the feathers. Once soft and silky, Steve’s wings looked just as sickly as his body was, patches of dried out white feathers interspersed with patches of nothing. It was ugly and terrifying, and Steve couldn’t help the fact that his eyes burned with anger and grief at his wings.
“It’s certainly not something I’d like to find out,” Pepper chuckled. “Anything specific today?”

But Rhodey would not have it, settling his weight down so that it felt as if Tony was pushing a brick wall. “This man is not leaving,” Rhodey retorted.
Through his tears, Steve looked at Tony, gasping and moaning, seeing the all encompassing love for him. Tony smiled at him, and he reached for Steve’s wings, stroking it lovingly with gentle hands.
“So he’s essentially a centaur,” Tony said. “Half-human, half-horse.”

Yinsen stared at him. “Do you remember anything?” he asked.
“Give up Tony, the TARDIS will never let you in,” the Doctor said with a smug smile on his face.
But the professor-looking man just nodded, flapping his hand in the direction of the box. “Yes, that right there is a ship. My ship. How can you see my ship?”

It was like Tony knew something Steve didn’t, but he didn’t answer. Steve bit his lip. If Tony knew about his crush…
would be there – the dream him, that is. It’s why he didn’t often sleep. He didn’t know if he wanted to face yet another fight that he was sure he would lose. Heaven knows that he had already lost enough. Still, whether it was missing his friend or lacking self-preservation instincts, Tony was always drawn to look at

He can't, is the thing. Tony's body isn't his anymore, and they both know that. So Tony bites his tongue, feeling blood spurt in his mouth while Steve drags himself off of Tony. "Don't move," Steve says. Commands really. And Tony does, listening to the way that Steve unbuckles his belt and the shift of clothing as he undresses. Steve's uniform falls to the floor with a muffled
“Please,” Steve begged. Tony leaned up, and Steve leaned down, willingly giving himself Tony to take care of.

You’re going to burn the banana bread.
Although the man was interesting, his non-answer was quickly making him lose his interest, and the cold wasn’t helping either. He was probably high on crack . Now that he wasn’t so focused on the ship itself, he could finally feel the chill seeping through his coat. He was cold; he didn’t know why he was entertaining this stranger. He had work to do, prototypes to test, a thesis to write. “Whatever, Doctor. Pleasure. Fair warning, you might want to park your…spaceship elsewhere. This is a college campus, and we’re curious students.”
Nebula shrugged wearily. “Long enough.”
Guess he really had to scramble for clout. He’s just mad he didn’t get laid 👏
He trusted that Tony would bring him back, keep him safe, and protect him.
Now that Tony wasn’t fighting for his life, he could now see that he was in a cavern, only illuminated by the fire on the other side of the room. A nail dug relentlessly in his back, and he shifted slightly to get away from the annoyance, which shifted the wires that went into his chest. “What’s this?”
Rhodey stopped at his door and turned around to face Tony with a glint in his eye that Tony was sure he wouldn’t like what he had to say next. “Or remember that other time when –“
…The last vestiges of the dream faded away to Nebula’s hand shaking his body. “Wake up Stark,” she said, pulling her hand away once she saw that Tony wasn’t in danger of going back to sleep, “We’re near the outpost.”
“Oh, so it’s a him,” Rhodey said consideringly. “Tony said the other person was a her.”

There would be no more sleep tonight, and there was no longer any point of staying in bed. “Lights at thirty percent,” Steve croaked out, mouth dry, and the lights turned on. Even as he moved towards the gym, the words played over and over in his mind, and they wired him up. It couldn’t be true. He lived in the present. He had Bucky back, he had Sharon, Sam, Natasha…
“Of course she did,” Steve started laughing.
Stevens pointed shakily at the window. “That’s…that’s...,” he stuttered. Tony looked towards where he was pointing.
“I found Clint,” Nat said quietly, out of the blue. “He’s out there doing contract killing.”

“You know,” he said, “Dad always told me that Captain America had the most beautiful wings that he’d ever seen, so strong, beautiful, and gorgeous, protecting those in need.”
“How about the U.S.?”
Tiny Steve trilled at him before looking up at Steve. He leaned to the side, pressing his tiny hands to Steve’s lick of skin not covered by his glove. Immediately, as soon as his tiny fingers brushed against the pad of Steve’s thumb, Steve felt everything his tiny counterpart was feeling: contentment, happiness, a little bit thirsty, a little bit hungry.

“ – sorry,” he whispered aloud. Hot tears dampened Steve’s pillow, and he opened his eyes to the darkness of his room. The flip phone remained silent and dark, only warm because he cradled it in his palm as he slept.
“Yeah, I’ll be fine.” He wasn’t, not really, but Bucky had to take of his own mother and sister. “Really, I’ll be fine.”
Grieving.
His wings were all mottled black and white like a zebra. But a zebra’s coat was prettier. Steve stared at himself in the mirror, hating his own reflection because of them.
“Steve,” he rasped, tears of relief and unhappiness in his eyes. Because as much as he missed Steve, he also missed Peter. “I lost the kid.”
So busy with his inner turmoil, he missed the warning signs that could have prevented everything that came to be. But then again, he probably wouldn’t have because their scents were all masked when they surrounded them. The Humvee in front of them stopped, forcing the Humvee he was in to come to a halt too.
Tony was silent, still, processing those words. “As far as apologies went,” Tony said, “your words were pitiful. I’ve been dreaming of this moment for two years, seeing you, and I’ve always expected that you were going to finish the job. I’ve regret trying to hurt Bucky, and I’ve always wanted to tell you that I was sorry.”
An acorn bops him on the nose. Hard. Steve deserves it.
“I...I don’t remember.”
“How would they stick?” Steve asked, as he followed Tony’s instructions and tucked them under the muscle.
“Me? I’m fine,” Tony replied, with a smile that didn’t reach his eyes.
“Face me?” Tony asked softly, and then he helped Steve take off his shirt so that all that Steve had left between him and the world was his back brace. “Do you want to take it off yourself, or do you want me to do it?”
“Yeah, she definitely is,” Tony agreed. He set down his fork on his plate. “I’m going to figure it out.”
Tony grinned. “Thanks. I missed you too.”
Don’t get cocky, Mr. Stark. Don’t forget who runs your company.
“Fuck yes,” Tony groaned, dragging him across the balcony but never letting him go. He held him by the nape of his neck, and Steve never felt so owned before. “I’m never going to let you go, now that I know that you’re so amazing.”
“Tony,” Steve says, strangled. His eyes are filled with mirth. “Your fur…”
So far away, all he wanted was someone familiar, and STEVE provided that bittersweet comfort on this ship.
Stevens bobbed his head down and up in acknowledgement to Tony’s hypothesis. “I can’t tell you who I am. Complications and all that.”
oh, *now* you’re admitting that this is a date.
“Did you deck her, Cap?” Tony was attempting to process the amount of information coming at him, while maintaining a neutral face, and it was taxing even for his brain.
Stevens picked at his plate and nodded glumly. “It’s taking longer than I thought to ask for his forgiveness.”
“Hey, no. You can’t blame yourself entirely for not stopping him,” Tony countered. “Thanos was too strong and we weren’t strong enough to stop him. Because if you blame yourself, I have myself to blame too.”
Bucky shook his head. “I just… I know that doofus and he is

“I always want to please you,” Tony said, bucking backwards and letting out a long, throaty moan as Steve pinched his nipples. They were hard, dusky and dark, and they were so sensitive from the cold and then from Steve’s overheated fingers. As he jerked backwards into Steve’s body, he could feel Steve’s own hard dick pressing insistently against the crack of his ass, and he couldn't help but tease, grinding back against it. He smirked when Steve gasped in his ear.
Tony gasped as his chest radiated pain, and he hung limply between the two soldiers gripping his arms tightly. He didn’t shift. What should have come so naturally to him was now very out of reach, and it was like he was missing a limb. His wolf...it was like his wolf was gone, leaving him human.
“Penny Reid,” the man shrugged. “Structured joy calms me. Anyway, I considered having Parker web them against a wall today but Nat reminded me that it’s possible that using the kid to facilitate sex might actually count as child pornography.”
“What about him?” he said weakly.
And then she stepped out in front of them.
“Hi, Steve, it’s me,” Tony sighed, “which you know because I invented the fucking phone and you’ll have caller ID and Jesus, I’m rambling, but right, so about that text, I’m sorry. That wasn’t how I was going to tell you, but I’m too tired to lie any more, so I meant the text. Both parts. I’m sorry, though, about telling you.
“I’ll be there for you now, not in the way I wasn’t for you before,” Steve said. There were tears in his eyes, but there was also a look of benediction and promise. “I’ll be there for you. I love you, and I should have told you before, but now that I have this second chance, I can’t not tell you that.”
Bags were packed and students left more quickly than they came in. Typical. A few students hung around after class to ask him a few questions, and Tony was forced to remain on call until all of their questions were answered.
By now, Tony's cock is also fully on board, hard and leaking. He's coiled tightly, crying and whimpering as the tongue presses insistently against his hole.
She left, leaving the two alone.
There were two footsteps that were near him now, and Tony held his breath. His heart was beating loudly in his chest, pressing uncomfortably against his arc reactor.

The city lights glistened down below, sparkling prettily, and the stars above greeted him too. “I love this,” he breathed.
WHY IS EVERYONE SENDING ME THESE???
“Not Jericho,” he said ruefully. “I’m never giving that to them. I can, however, build something else. Here.” Tony laid out his blueprints on their worktable. He’d been working on it for the past several days. “I’ve been thinking about this since I was stuck here.”
“It’s…” Stevens tried saying, but Deborah had already left, walking away with a bounce to her step, and he trailed off, “not a sad beard.”

Tony’s comment was met with silence.
“I’d...I’d really love that.”
Steve’s eyes glistened with tears. “I know. I took it too far, and I’m so sorry for letting you down. No. I let both you and Bucky down.”
Steve traps the squirrel between his paws and noses into the stuck-up fur. Tony should be used to it by now, Steve nosing his way into his fur, but it is always a weird sensation in the beginning for Steve to lick his back with one motion and spit out a mass of leaves, twigs, and dirt from his back. Tony tries to squirm away, but Steve holds Tony down. “Hold still!” Steve says, tail wagging, before adding another big slobbery lick.
“He is, sir. Would you like me to take you down?”
Natasha shook her head, and the way her face fell matched his own disappointment. “It might be early yet, but there’s a chance that the trail is cold.”
It was patriotic to not give up the Jericho. But Tony wasn’t thinking about that. It was for Rhodey. He would never betray Rhodey, even at the cost of his life. The Alpha snarled, hearing the recalcitrance in his tone; he snarled back, not giving an inch. He would never allow terrorists, and terrible Alphas to control him.
“Come on, Tones, I’m your best friend. I should know these things.”
Steve stepped back and curled his wings tightly to himself, avoiding the curious look that Fury gave him. “Just get me a back brace, please Fury.” He hated that his voice sounded so fragile.
Steve nodded.
“Do I really mean so little to you?” Tony asked.
It’s possible he passed out temporarily as he scrambled to figure out how to invent time travel.
Rhodey gave a cheeky grin back. “Nope.” But he let the matter drop anyway. This is why he was Tony’s best friend, and Tony appreciated him.
Indeed, those wings were different than normal wings, Steve realized when Iron Man touched down. The feathers weren’t down and soft; they were hard and sharp, as they were created from metal.
Tony picked up his metal wings from the floor, held together by a brace. “I’m wingless, Steve,” Tony said plainly. “Why do you think I had metal wings?”
“They cloned…me,” Steve said in horror and awe.
Tony grabbed Stevens’s cup and swallowed the rest of it. “No, tastes fine to me, why?” Tony looked up to see Stevens’s stunned face and frozen form, hand still curled as if his mug was still in his hand. There was a slight tinge of pink that stained his cheeks. The blue eyes shone cerulean blue under the incandescent lights and his pink lips were parted in surprise as they stared at each other.
“And I love you, Tony Stark. I swear to Jesus, Mary, and all the saints, I love you.”
“And you!” Tony twirled around, pointing at Butterfingers. “Did you let DUM-E clean you today?”
The winter breeze was picking up again, as if the weather had one last spite for him, chilling him to the bone and reminding of the time - before, as if he wasn’t reminded already.
”I’m writing a screenplay. It’s about this guy who never really feels like he fits in. Like he’s just different.”
“That could be a new children’s cartoon—The Genius Pumpkin,” Steve quipped as he scanned the room for a photographer. Making eye contact with one of the SI staff, he motioned for the woman to meet them near one of the photo backdrops.
Steve nodded. He was terrified. Everything, all of his worst fears for years, were laid out on his table, and Tony ripped them apart like they were nothing.
Hottie just looked at his phone in feigned surprise. “Oh weird, I have a text from my mom.” I just inhaled my coffee and coughed loudly

“Being flightless isn’t that bad,” Steve defended.

For all you twitter fans, I’m in Brooklyn, where they make the best coffee that I’ve ever tasted.
Steve’s eyes were wet, and his voice was thick when he said, “Come home, Tony.”
Tentatively, Steve stretched his wings out again, the way that Tony had taught him earlier. “Good, baby. You’re doing so well. Now can you flap your wings for me?”
There was a crazed look in Stevens’s eyes. “I...thought I saw someone from my past,” he said, voice hoarse, looking back towards the window again.
“Fury knows that if he presses that button – “ she pointed to the communicator, which was mysteriously turned off while they were focused on her, “ – it meant that help is critical.”
And then they did it again because Steve’s cock, even after three orgasms, was still hard, and Tony dropped down to his knees to take it into his mouth, gagging and choking and loving the feeling of Steve’s big cock there.
Big, callused hands wrap around his waist, gripping excruciatingly tightly and lifting him so that his ass is in the air and his face is smashed against the pillow. The cool air of the room is a stark contrast to his overheated body, and he shivers again when the air nips every inch of his naked skin. Steve shifts so that his warm breath is

He tried not to feel sad about it; he barely knew Stevens after all. But it still felt...like there was an aching in his heart.
Howard was probably talking about the only time when he showed his wings to the world, and his eyes burned again. “They—”
Thank you Arcade for beta-ing this chapter!
“Don’t listen to them,” Bucky said, coming forward. “They’re just bullies.”
“Thanks Thor,” Steve said. He looked at the rest of the team. They didn’t stare at him in disgust or in horror; Steve could feel the love and the camaraderie as they gathered around him. He could cry again in happiness.
He woke, gasping. For a moment, Tony was blinded and disoriented by this sudden change of scenery, and during that moment, Tony didn’t remember where he was. His heart jackrabbited wildly in his chest before realization and remembrance came flooding back in – he was on the Guardians’ ship, he was in space, and he was alone with Nebula for everyone else had turned to ashes. Tony sighed heavily, thumping his head back against the orange cushion of the chair, and he looked out into the emptiness.
“No time. If we’re making our escape, we have to do it now. We don’t know what’s going on outside.”
Rhodey snorted, and Tony glared at him. “Hey Debs, I’m not here for him. I’m here for breakfast and for a nice cup of your coffee. Please and thank you.”

After a moment, Steve tried flapping his wings once. It was a miniscule one, one that barely did anything while Tony’s own mechanical wings were flapping harder than normal to accommodate the weight of two people. But Tony wasn’t complaining, only gave him constant praise and encouragement, “That was a good first try, but flap a little harder so that you can get wind under your wings and fly.”
“Well, Spidey isn’t here, is he, and we can keep secrets, right?” Tony winked at Steve. “But seriously, no, that’s insane. You… Cap, you’re you. No settling.”
“It feels like there’s no hope left.”
It’s his only choice.
“Yeah right, you never pay anyway,” Rhodey said, small bursts of laughter still spilling from his mouth. Tony shoved him into the wall. Or, he tried; Rhodey
Natasha looked up again. “He loved you,” she argued back. “Everyone knew that. You were his favorite. But I don’t think you realize how much he cared for you.”
Tony snorted, and then he considered him. “Are you still displaced?”
Butterfingers asked, twirling his plunger.
“Shut up, Rhodey,” Tony grumbled.
“We’re all broken, Steve,” Tony said softly. “They called me the ‘Merchant of Death,’ for God’s sake.”
) as they watch Peter and MJ ride upon Bucky’s back. Peter is excitedly directing Bucky to go this way and that while MJ sits behind Peter, feigning disinterest. Slightly further away, Clint is barking up a tree where a cat is settled upon its lowest branch, and the cat is looking down at the dog with haughtily amused eyes.
“Understood. Please, tell your people that we are grateful that you stood with us, and we are sorry that we could not prevent this tragedy from happening.”
Well, in reality, it was less catching and more like Tony tumbling right into Steve’s waiting arms. He could take the uncontrolled fall; Tony couldn’t. Tony’s arm continued to swing with momentum and smacked Steve’s face. He grunted, but he held on to Tony.
Steve chuckled.
“So he wanted you to have fun and enjoy yourself?” Tony asked.
The Alpha looked at the table, then at Tony. He shouted something at him and pointed viciously at the table. The only word that he got from the rapid mess of words was “Jericho.”
“Sir, download’s complete, shall I begin the self-destruction process?” JARVIS’s voice came through the speakers, and Tiny Steve shrank back in surprise.
Tony pressed a hand upon Steve’s thigh. “You know black wings aren’t anything to be ashamed of.”
“Chatter,” Steve warned.
Nature would always eventually win.
“It’s amazing,” Tony agreed, pecking him on the check. “You ready to soar now? It’s easier than keeping us up.”
The initial draft looked crude and messy, looking nothing like the sophisticated equipment Tony had made. He wasn’t even sure if the thing would work, because he would need to do tests to find the stones. He hoped that the sensor would be able to catch on to the wavelength of the stones.
“Okay,” he repeated more quietly, “We’ll go to the outpost, restock, and refuel.”
“I wanted to tell you I’m sorry.” It was barely a breath, but in this quiet place, Tony heard every word.
Bucky matched his smile. “You did? Where?”
Tony remembers the incident well enough, and the scars from that ordeal sends phantom pains down his body. Luckily, Steve’s right there to drag Tony back into his embrace, holding him gently between his paws until Tony’s body stops shivering.
Tony exhaled. “I don’t know, Rhodey, I don’t know. I don’t think so, though.”
“Yes, it’s safe here. I live here, and so does the rest of the team. You’re not going to be an experiment if you don’t want to.” Steve glared at Tony when it looked like he was gonna say otherwise.
“Maybe, but he’s cute,” Tony whined. He stole another glance towards the far table, and Stevens gave him a wave and a grin.
I don’t know why I’m still friends with you
“We…couldn’t beat Thanos.” Steve loathed to admit it, because it was a weakness to show the crippling failure of them not doing their job. But they needed help, whatever help they could get.
“Uhh, yeah,” Steve said out loud, even though by the looks on their faces, they already knew his answer anyway.
Steve shook his head. “I’m...I’m scared.”
Butterfingers growled eagerly.
“But it may be our only lead to fix all this,” Natasha said. She looked at the communicator. “Keep it powered up. Let’s hope that whoever’s on the other side while get the message, and not be gone as well."
“Okay.” Steve closed his eyes as Tony unclasped the brace with a

“What,” Tony deadpanned, and he stared at the man. Tony had two doctorates and was on his third. He knew mechanics like the back of his hand. In fact, he probably knew mechanics better than the back of his hand, and he had no idea what the man was blabbering on about. “First of all, you need to explain to me what a TARDIS is. Second, this here?” Tony patted the wooden exterior. The warmth that emitted from it was an appreciated feeling under his hand; he was tempted to press his nose against it too. Tony tamped down the urge and continued, “This doesn’t blend in at all, especially not here.”
Thank you so much for all the lovely feedback ❤️ we’re glad that you’re having as much fun as we are.
Of course, how could I, an uncivilised piglet, know anything about conspicuously ostentation verbiage in the form of ear-assaulting peroration.
“Stretch your wings out, there we go,” Tony encouraged. “You want to capture the wind so that you can be aerodynamic.”
“Fuck, Tony,” Steve groaned, speeding up his own thrusts, “You are gorgeous. I love you.”
“Any lead on the communicator?” Steve asked.
“Of course, sir,” the AI responded and then, after a short pause, continued. “Mr. Barnes was also involved in the plot.”

Tony didn’t blush at Pepper’s final message, the kissing face emoji, not at all. Nothing was going to happen, no matter what Pepper wrote. He needed another drink and to get his mind off of a certain man who had smoothed out his blond hair for this event, groomed his beard, dressed up in a sharp tuxedo, and was dancing with a pretty girl on the dance floor.
“I’ve never seen this on his person, but we can check once we get back to the Compound. May I?” Steve nodded, and Natasha plucked it from his hand and eyed it critically. “Nick isn’t one to be sentimental, so if this indeed is truly his, then there will be some purpose to this. It’s certainly possible that this is his. Anyway, if he indeed was calling someone, then we’ll need to charge this up.”

Steve had to take off his shirt before he entered the chamber. He looked around the room with trepidation. Everyone, from Erskine to Howard, to all the generals sitting in the observation room above them were going to see how pathetic he was. He looked at Peggy; she looked back encouragingly.
He wanted to go
“Nah,” Tony waved his hand. “Diplomat. You avoided an international incident for which Pepper would have actually had us all shot if Captain America had punched someone on a date. You were feeling unsafe and you got out of there. That’s what we’re always telling Peter to do.”
This was the man he loved, and he was so happy that the man loved him too. With that thought in his mind, he came, Steve’s hand stroking him firmly while he went over the edge.
They’ve been gone awhile, did they both just leave without paying?!
“The TARDIS has a chameleon circuit that would allow her to blend in with her environment.” The man stated it in such a matter-of-fact tone that it was as if
No, he wouldn’t think about that at all. Tony
“So that means you’re going to stay with the rest of us in the Tower?” Clint was already bounding down the corridor.
Steve snapped awake quietly, a habit he never shook off from working undercover ops. However, as he laid on his side in a bed that was still unfamiliar, his heart ached. Too many people were just gone in a snap: Bucky, Sam, T’Challa, Wanda. More. In this post-apocalyptic world, sleep was sparse; too much work had to be done. Governments had collapsed, city infrastructure had fallen to the wayside, and missing bodies were still rising steadily. Steve…didn’t want to get out of bed and face the world.
“It’s nothing.” Steve was too embarrassed to look at Tony. He was sure he was blushing. Inadvertently, that put him in a position where he was looking down at his palms and…Tiny Steve who was giving him a wicked smirk. He couldn’t take this anymore. Steve stretched his hand out blindly in the direction that Tony was in. “Just give them to me please.”
“Everyone else, herd them to Thor so that they can all get shorted out.”
He had dreamed about Tony before, and back then, he wasn’t so untouchable. Steve could stand in front of him and brush his hand gently down Tony’s cheek, caressing him sweetly in his palm in the way he would never be able to do so in real life. Now, however, the cold and cutting words were more like nightmares, and it stirred up anger from deep within his soul until he wanted to fight.
Sarah closed her eyes, breathing in and breathing out, and Steve gripped her hand harder. He bowed his head over her supine form, praying. But he didn’t believe that she would stay because it was a punishment.
“And I have Tony’s stash of rocks.”
“Tony,” Steve repeated, his voice finally becoming crystal clear. Tony was silent, staring, memorizing at this…stranger in front of him. The silence stretched between them, and long moments pass as they stood frozen looking at each other before the Steve-lookalike made a noise from deep within his chest and took a small step forward. Immediately Tony jerked back, a full body flinch as he sought to keep distance from this Steve, and Steve watched as Tony stepped back like a startled colt.
. Steve’s fingers lifted, unbidden, and he brushed over the numbers, which only stared back at him. His chest constricted, then swelled.
“My cock is bigger than my fingers,” Tony said worriedly. “I may hurt you.”
Rhodey was waiting for him when he finally left the hall. “Brunch?” he asked plainly, foregoing a greeting. Tony nodded and fell in step with his friend.
“Tony.” The familiar voice washed over him even though the voice sounded as if he was far away, and Tony closed his eyes, letting
“I forgive you.”
I’m having problems entering Stark Tower...
And it was, much to Tony’s excitement. Tony hitched his bag higher up his shoulder, making a beeline for the ship. It was easier to study it up close when it was daylight, and Tony could see that the TARDIS was a shade of blue that reminded him of blueberries. Besides the fact that it was a blue wooden police box, the TARDIS itself was nondescript. Tony tried the doors again. Expectedly, the doors were still locked.
“How are you doing?” Steve asked, pressing his lips to Tony’s temple. Tears gathered in the corners of his eyes; it felt so good, and he said so.

And Tony was awake. Dried tears made his face sticky, and his mouth was rough. There were pins stabbing his lungs every time he breathed - it was like he had a diminished lung capacity. He forced his stiff neck to move to find the source of the pain, bringing his hand to graze the bandages that covered his chest.
it. As it stood, however, Steve still had an evil streak, and because his miniature counterpart was evil and wingmanned earlier, Steve opened his palm and placed Tiny Steve on the countertop in full view.
He didn’t deserve it, not with the way he hurt Tony yet
could not jeopardize that - especially since it wasn’t reciprocated.
He couldn’t see his wings; he didn’t need to. All ugly and broken and mottled, streaked with black and white from all the harm he did to himself. He bit his lips when he heard a small gasp behind him.
Oh gee, I don’t know, maybe I lead a Fortune 500 company, I’ve been in the Times 100 every year since I was 21.
And Tony watched themselves in the darkened window as they slowly fell apart, hurtling to the edge like a rocket. He was gasping, whining, crying, sharing breathless kisses with Steve, and he loved this more than anything.
“Changing something can change everything?” Tony asked. “Like a time traveller.”
(But really, he’s not that torn up about it – he gets to see Steve more often now.)
Steve shrugged and hit a few buttons on the control panel. “It was just something Bucky said as we were leaving the mayor’s house, back there. Made me wonder if that’s just the kind of thing I have to learn to put up with now.”
“Yes, sir.”
Tony, still afraid to use his voice, nodded once more.

He just wished that that smile would be directed towards him. Someday perhaps. “Hey there,” Tony said gently, “Do you need anything? Water, food?”
But still, there was still an inkling of doubt in his mind, that they were connected to each other, so Tony pulled back slightly and said, “I dreamed about you, in a Red Room, that you said sorry to me, and you told me how much you regretted hurting me.”
I have the worst friends.
“I’m sorry I wasn’t there for you,” Steve said lowly. “I should have been. We should have done this together.”
“Dr. Smith doesn’t know the difference between his right hand and left foot, let alone anything he teaches.” Tony rolled his eyes.
“That’s good, I’m really glad.”
Steve stretched out his wings as he entered the living room, showing off his new set of wings. “Just got them!”
Tony grinned when Stevensn’s blush darkened.

Thank you Stingray for betaing this chapter!
He had no intention just yet of doing that, but he needed an excuse to get as far away from her as possible. He didn’t wait for her to reply, tucking his helmet under his arm and headed towards the back where the ladder was. As he climbed down, he looked back to the utter sadness in Nebula’s posture, bowing over the armrest as she looked out at the wide and bottomless expanse of space.

“Tony,” Steve whispered.
“Okay, Tony.”
He may have been grounded, but he still had two fists, and America needed men. Still, four tries, four “4F’s,” and Steve sighed at his luck.
Need your help! Where should we go for our next date?
Because he didn’t believe in Bucky’s words anymore, the belief that when the time is right, he would meet his soulmate. He saw the way one of the gal’s soulmate timer faded right in front of his eyes. It was on her hand, ticking down day by day, and then it vanished the next moment. Her cries and wails as she collapsed on the middle of the sidewalk still haunted his dreams. So he just wanted to be selfish, this once, because who knew that tomorrow meant his own death?
As a matter of fact, I do. Unlike you.
“You’re not a freak,” Tony burst out. He sat beside Steve. He repeated, “You’re not a freak. You’re Steve Rogers, Captain America, amazing soldier, strong, and beautiful.”
And it
“Everyone’s waiting for us.”
“Tell that to Dr. Smith,” Tony shot back. “I still can’t believe he decided not to turn up to lectures one day without notice and Dr. Jones made

“Fu-fuck me,” Steve moaned back, clutching onto Tony’s arms desperately. Because if he didn’t do so, he would have fallen to his knees in a prayer to him.

I’m an award-winning novelist. I was the winner of the National Book Award in 2005. What have YOU done?
“You’re so gorgeous, baby,” Tony said into his mouth, “So perfect, I don’t know what to do with myself.”
He extended his hand, and she took it, leading him to the dance floor. “I look forward to learning.”
Tony’s eyes were cold as ice and boiling as hot as fire. It wasn’t the Tony he wanted to see, if Steve admitted. But it wasn’t fair at all, to hear Tony accusing him of all that. It
“Stark” was written on the side of it, and he stilled. As the cries of the wolves grew louder and closer, he scrambled back, away from them, away from his own missile…

“Oh, I like how you think, Cap,” Tony grinned.
In this factor of unknown, where the past was gone and the future was uncertain, Tony felt lost, but if there was one thing he wanted, it was to go “Home,” Tony said. “I want to go back to Earth.”
But Tony’s eyes were half-lidded, nearly closed, and he sagged in Steve’s arms like a puppet cut from his strings. “I’m sorry. I don’t think…” his voice trailed off and his throat bobbed as he swallowed. Steve watched as Tony’s eyelashes fluttered, eyelids struggling to open. “I don’t think I’ll make it home.”
“Aren’t we all. They’re not even creative anymore,” Clint groaned. “Like…at least make it interesting.”
Steve wished he could have that, and he looked at Tony’s back longingly. Perhaps one day.
Steve agreed, “Yep. You can’t believe how long I’ve wanted this.” Steve bracketed Tony’s head with his arms, bending down to lick a long stripe from his sternum to the base of his throat.
It took him a while before the conversation replayed in his head, and Tony realized he never caught his name. He snapped back to the present. “What did you say your name was?”
Butterfingers said. His voice was gravelly, and he sounded utterly disappointed at the news. Tony gave the robot a level-headed stare even as he expertly poured his coffee into his mug.
Steve thought viciously, looking at his tiny counterpart instead of Tony.
“Every single man and woman who you took to bed all this time made me jealous, so very jealous,” Steve growled in his mouth. “I looked at every single one of them and wanted them to be me.”
And when the pain came, then Erskine’s death, she was there, supporting him as Captain America. Perhaps, however, he could be selfish for once, because she was there, and his soulmate wasn’t.
Asshole, oblivious: “oh yeah? That’s awesome, I don’t think my mom even knows how to read”
As much as Tony promised that the rest of the team wouldn’t judge his wings, old habits died hard, and Steve put the back brace on when they were out and about. Because even though Tony praised his wings every time he saw them (and Steve blushed every time without fail), he was still too scared to know what the rest of the team thought of them.
Steve Rogers like the one who was facing him now. It was shocking, to say the least, because those sky-blue eyes were never shiny with unshed tears, nor were there ever any wrinkles on his perfect forehead. Dream-Steve was never so unsure of himself, haunching his shoulders forward, or gave Tony a grief-stricken look. It caught Tony utterly off-guard; he knew how to ride through a dream of a murderous Steve. He didn’t know how to deal with this miserable man in front of him.

“Don’t we all wish that?”
For once, Steve’s ma had come home before the sun had even set.
Stevens had to go back to Deborah’s cafe. There was something wrong, something very, very wrong about that place, and he didn’t know what it was.
Steve tucks his hand under Tony's neck and lifts him up as he continues to pound relentlessly into Tony's ass. He feels owned - not by choice - but he reluctantly loves it too. His cock slaps against his leg as Steve pulls out and pushes in, dragging his cock against his prostate.

“Electromagnets. It was the best I could do to prevent the shrapnel from reaching your heart.” Tony traced the wires from his chest until he found the other end, connected to a car battery. He inhaled. It was painful with the foreign object in his chest, but there was no other choice he had.
“Good.”

He was back in Red Room. Once dramatic and slightly frightening, the eerie starkness was just boring now. Tony paced the room, every footstep echoing hollowly. This…emptiness drove him out of his mind. It was a red room as far as the eye could see. He wished that he was back at his workshop. Or even on Earth.
The “4F” was all but shoved into his face, and Steve clutched onto it before it could fall to the ground. He left to snorts and soft jeers behind him.

Tony waved off the apology. “It’s PTSD, isn’t it? Took you back to the war?”
“You better,” Bucky called back as his steps thumped down the staircase, “Else I’ll kill you myself.”
The cries of despair broke the silence when their brains had finally processed the loss.
Nebula exhaled heavily, sounding very close to defeat, and Tony swallowed.
“You’re gorgeous,” Tony said again, stroking the sides of his body. “Your wings, you cock, your eyes, your voice. There’s no way I’m letting you go now.”

But before the weight of Bucky’s death crashed over him, Steve saw the way Tony was preparing for a verbal war. His spine straightened, his face took on an intense look, and he seemed deceptively casual. He was sure that, with the way Tony stalked closer with fire in his eyes, Steve wouldn’t like what he had to say.
Steve obeyed, staring into Tony’s eyes. He could get lost in those eyes, the ones that shone with love for him. “Do you want me to tell you the truth about your wings? Do you trust me?”
Stevens slumped over his plate of food. “I just...I don’t even know what I did wrong,” he said morosely.

It felt much too long before he gripped the doorway with a white-knuckled grip, looking at himself in the dirty bathroom mirror. He stared at his sickly face, the pallor of his skin more pale than normal, and then he turned to see the source of the pain that radiated down his back.
Bucky hummed, plucking a piece of ham from Steve’s plate and eating it. Steve laughed and batted away his hand when he tried reaching for another piece. “Because I know what it’s like to be on the outside,” Bucky finally offered. “My baby sis is flightless.”
All that is left in this room is sleep, think, sleep, think some more, sleep yet again. Steve would never let him out of the room - he's a danger to himself and to others. And he'll take it because he doesn't think he can survive betraying Steve again and seeing him die under his own hands.
Steve threw a skeptical glance across the cockpit, but remained silent.
“A friend of his,” she said. “You?”
“You know, you’re not supposed to touch me,” he rasped. He almost nearly said,
“I’m not sad! But he dropped me in the middle of nowhere,” Stevens replied. “I didn’t even know where I was or when I was and it was all just very confusing very confusing very quickly.”.
”A lot of my friends are having kids but I don’t know,” *self-conscious laugh* “I can barely take care of myself let alone a baby.”
But talking about classical music was less interesting than this box and the man who claimed he owned a spaceship. Tony turned back to look at the TARDIS, and the man came up beside him. While the freezing torrent of snow battered against his entire being and covering everything within reach, Tony only had eyes for the contraption. It was fascinating to see something new and unique, different from anything else he had seen before. But he also knew that current technology did not permit anything like this to be a spaceship. He asked, “So you’re a time traveler?”

"You're going to let me in," Steve says into the corner of his lip.
Tony debated whether to go to class or stay here and check out the interesting police box more. On the one hand, he had a midterm he had to oversee. It was important, but as Tony’s feet slowed down while he stared at the TARDIS, he found that he couldn’t care more about the students. This TARDIS thing, right here, seemed way more interesting than twenty questions of fives sheets of paper that he had to answer in a dim classroom.
DUM-E beeped and twirled his claws excitedly, as if he was completely innocent. Tony huffed, but he walked forward and stroked DUM-E’s claw. He was relieved that DUM-E wasn’t exterminated.
Nowhere was safe from this loss. As the tall grass bowed gently under the blowing wind in Wakanda, soldiers stood stock still, lost and empty. They had fought a great battle expecting to win, expecting to beat Thanos.
him. They stood in silence, staring at each other like time warped around them, like it was the only two of them in the world and nothing else could break this moment they had together.
“I can’t tell you. You know that.” Stevens stood up, and Tony felt bereft as the warmth from Stevens body dissipated. “Thank you, Tony, for the good time.”
His eyes snapped open. The entire room was red, casting an eerie hue that coated even the air he breathed. He remained facing forward, breathing only shallowly because it seemed difficult to even draw a deeper breath. His eyes fixed upon the wall in front of him. This place was unfamiliar, but Tony couldn’t bring it within himself to be frightened – he was too exhausted to even be scared. Somehow, however, he also knew that there was nothing behind him…there was no possibility for escape in this God-forsaken area.
Do y’all remember the terrible first coffee hottie? I scored a date with him.
Tony inhaled sharply, and Steve looked up in shock. “You’ve put them in a brace since you were ten?” he asked, lowly, dangerously.
“My apologies, Mr. Stark,” the AI said. “Considering you have not configured a set time in my program, I am making my best guess.”
The fire department just called me asking if there was a fire on the 73rd floor, Tony. I hope you’re not still in the kitchen.
And Tiny Steve was buried deep in Steve’s palm so that Tiny Tony couldn’t see him.
“Black wings,” Steve whispered. “Bad omen.”
Steve repeated, the wave of his pleasure arching higher and higher.
“Uh huh,” Tony replied, letting disbelief color his voice. “It’s still here though.”
Like you have your life under control?
“Please. Hear me out,” Steve begged. “I’m sorry.” Steve raised his hand slowly, outstretched towards Tony. But Tony couldn’t bear his touch. Not now at least, not when he knew it wasn’t real. Tony took a small step back, just barely out of reach, and Steve’s face fell.
As Tony unbuttoned his shirt, the arc reactor emanated from his chest, glowing a soft blue. Steve had never noticed it before because Tony had covered it whenever he hung out. But now, Steve was looking at it, mesmerized by its pulsating and soft blue light. And then Tony took off his shirt and turned around.

It wasn’t the same, not really, with Bucky’s sister being completely flightless and Steve being flighted. Steve would have preferred being flightless if it meant that he didn’t have to stare at his wings when he passed the mirror every time.
It was an accident. It truly was. But Steve had been always a boy from Brooklyn, and Tony’s words scraped Steve raw, cutting him to pieces even within the dream.
Steve was so, so worn. He didn’t want to do this. Every face was looking at him, waiting for him to begin, but he felt just as lost them.
And deprive the world your blush?
Tony stumbled after Nebula, holding an ache of emptiness in his chest and the crumbling pieces of his helmet in his hand. He was exhausted from the events of the day, the torrent of emotions washing over him. His world was tinged in grey, and he was in agony both physically and mentally.
“Where am I?” Steve asked. His voice was hoarse. Made sense; after all, he hadn’t used his vocal cords in over seventy years. (He was supposed to be dead.)
He felt all alone, and perhaps this was punishment for his sins, to be in this prison. Too weak to defeat his enemies, letting Peter die in his arms because he wasn’t strong enough to ask for help. This Red Room wasn’t heaven, but it didn’t feel like hell either. It felt like…someone was behind him. Tony tensed at the unknown presence, but he dared not look back. Tony’s heartbeat pounded to the cadence of the slow march that grew ever louder until it stopped a few inches behind him. He waited, body still and frozen.
Thor growled. “You will do no such thing!”
Tiny Tony was propped up at the top of his tank, excitedly watching them come closer. He blew bubbles at them. “Bwob bwob?”
“Probably power surges and the weather,” Tony dismissed. “I don’t think that there’s anything to worry about. It’s typical.”
OMG THE PAN IS ON FIRE
Tony held up a hand, and he slowly placed it against the invisible wall between them. Tony swallowed, his Adam’s apple bobbing up and down with the motion, and Steve lifted his hand to match it. “Please, if you could do one thing for me,” Tony whispered, “don’t tell me. I’ve been thinking, looking at these clues. I thought you, for a long time, were just a figment of my imagination, but there is no way that my imagination could hurt me so badly, or that my imagination could respond so…viscerally. You can’t be anything but real. It’s really you just on the other side of this barrier.”
“And I promise you, I’m a hell of a backup.” She stared steadily at Steve, gaze calculating, and Steve felt a wave of power emitting from her before the sensation cut off and she looked at Bruce. “I’m Carol. What do you need?”

Tony took the cup from the man’s hand. His own were shaking badly. Some water spilled over the rim. The man, perhaps recognizing that he wouldn’t be able to give himself a drink, wrapped his hand around his hand and brought the cup up to his lips. Tony hated feeling weak, but he had no choice. The water poured into his mouth, wetting his parched mouth. When the water was gone, the man pulled away. Tony drew his eyes back to the man hovering over him. “Who are you?”
“I finally got into the TARDIS,” Tony said, twirling his fork into his spaghetti. “You were right. I asked the TARDIS to let me in, and she did. I didn’t believe it at first.”
It was just like the other day, when Tony grabbed his wrist and licked the stray whipped cream off his fingers, and Tony had to admit, he really loved the taste of the man. He licked his lips again to watch Stevens’s eyes darken further.
And then Tony was right there, touching him again, inserting a pillow under his ass. “Crying again?” Tony asked, hovering over him, brushing his face through his tears.
“You sure you got this?”

The box was glowing dully, pulsating with an inviting light, and Tony had the urge to touch it. This was the dumbest plan he had, considering that it was way below freezing and he was headed towards hypothermia if he stayed out here any longer, but Tony peeled a glove off from his fingers and pressed his hand against the wooden exterior. It was lukewarm, buzzing weakly under his palm. “POLICE TELEPHONE, FREE FOR USE OF PUBLIC…PULL TO OPEN,” the sign on the call box read.
There was a silence that fell between them, and it took all of Steve’s self-control not to lash out and curse the world at the unfairness. However, the self-control wasn’t enough for him to kick a piece of rock out of his way, and Steve watched it fly in the air before it bounced and rolled to a stop beside a small rectangular…
Steve choked on laughter. “I think that’s on the list of phrases Peter told you that you were too old to say.”
It was Stevens, gently lifting up the bot like it was nothing and placing the bot back onto his charging station.

Steve pressed his forehead against the wall as well, and he closed his eyes. If he concentrated, he imagined that he could feel the echo of heat pressing radiating through the wall. It was still cold under his skin, but he could imagine, just this one moment, think that Tony was just right next to him. He said softly, “I miss you too. Please come home safely and alive because there is so much I want to tell you, so much that you deserve to hear.”

“Sometimes I still am mad at you,” Tony admitted, glancing down for a moment before looking back up at Steve again. “Sometimes I want to punch you in the face because you deserve it for hurting me.” Tony took a daring step closer, just one step closer in being able to touch the man in front of him. He wanted to. He despised himself for wanting to because Steve had hurt him.

Steve wasn’t going to answer her because she was a stranger, a danger, and an intruder. He stared at her; she glared steadily back, giving no ground.
“Thor, do you have to return to Asgard?” He desperately hoped that Thor did not have to go.
“I couldn’t have even been that drunk!” he protested. “Butterfingers just appeared out of the blue one day and never left! I couldn’t have possibly created Butterfingers. I may do drunken binges, but even I wouldn’t stoop so low as to use a plunger to create my projects. Why don’t you believe me?”
Steve kissed Tony’s temple, ushering him back into his bed. “I don’t regret it at all.”

Then the echo of the high-powered whine reached Tony’s ears, and he nearly spilled his coffee as he turned.
. Steve bit his lip to keep from giggling. “Tony.”
“I hate superstitions, and I don’t believe in omens,” Tony said. “The others would say the same.”
Steve agreed. Bucky deserved all that and more. He was there in his life since the beginning, fighting with him and being the best friend one could ever have no matter the circumstances. Likewise, Steve wanted to be the best friend Bucky was to Steve. “But you have to remember, too, Bucky wasn’t the same person from back then. He went through HYDRA’s brainwashing program. He couldn’t be the same person you knew him as. And as much as you wanted him to be your best friend again, the relationship between you and him couldn’t be the same. He was someone else, you are…timeless, and you had to relearn each other. Had you had the time, your relationship could have probably been better, but as it stood, you couldn’t face the fact that he was someone else.”
“Stop, Tony. I’m – “
The afternoon was spent out in the backyard destroying pieces of scrap metal into smithereens, Butterfingers gleefully saying,
With his permission, it felt like a wave of emotion crashed over him, and Steve couldn’t hold back anymore. Tears dripped out of his eyes, and he wailed, letting Tony fuck him with finger. It was hard to breathe with the ache in his heart soothed by Tony’s litany of praises, fucking him with one finger.
“What the hell is going on?” his driver muttered, right before the Humvee in front of them exploded in a fireball. The resulting shockwave rolled over them in a heatwave, and Tony gagged as he inhaled the hot air. Then, the car door crumpled, and the acrid scent of blood filled the air. Tony’s ears were still ringing from the blast.
“Well, that’s a weird way to say it, but just to clarify,You’re in Cambridge. It’s the year 1989, and you’re here with someone who knows how to have a good time,” Tony said brightly. He pushed away his half-eaten plate of food. “Tell you what, how would you like to come by my workshop?”

REALLY? You’re going to talk about THAT on Twitter?!
He shifted, and Tony’s hand in his wings stilled for a moment. Steve didn’t want him to stop: it felt so good, so warm.
I’m having problems entering Stark Tower...
Stevens was frowning even as he moved to follow Tony back out into the cold crisp air. Tony was excited. He was also a little bit nervous; he couldn’t believe that Stevens was interested in him
of death too, and that she was scared of him and his wings, bringing death to their front door. And even as she told him she still loved him, Steve sensed that their easy relationship was no longer there because they were tainted by his wings.
Steve bit his lip. They were everything to be ashamed of.
Which had been the question Tony was asking since the beginning of this whole affair. “I don’t know. But it’s not supposed to be here.”
He was terrified.
“Why are they all chanting ‘Doom?’” Clint asked. “So dumb.”

Weather’s nice.
“Tell me again, and I may believe you.”
after ever bolt of laser. It was fun, especially with Stevens by his side, relaxing beside him and his body pressed against his. It made Tony more aware of the man, a man who accepted him and his bots, even joining in on the fun when Stevens tossed a piece of aluminum foil into the chilly air and watching the ball explode into dust.
“Where’s Fury?”
“Captain, what is your destination?” JARVIS asked.
Tony knew that they couldn’t stall for too much longer. He could see that the Alphas were getting antsy about him, their red eyes flashing when they came in to inspect his work. They would lick their lips, give him a heated smirk, like he was a piece of meat to be devoured. He hated the lack of autonomy, in more ways that one. As a captive, he had no choice but to submit to the demands of his captors. As an Omega in the midst of Alphas, it was so difficult to fight Alpha commands. It was easier to shake it off because they weren’t his Alpha, but it still took all of his energy to fight off their flashing red eyes and not fall to his knees in supplication.
“We’re home,” Steve told Tiny Steve. He stepped off the Quinjet and took a moment to let his mini counterpart take in his surroundings. It wouldn’t be home, not yet, just like the way it took a while for Steve himself to get used to the new world. But Steve was confident that he would get used to it.
“Please,” Tony moaned back, and Steve pulled back, jerking desperately, crying out loud as he went over the edge again, coating Tony’s face with come. He opened his mouth, letting the water and Steve’s come drip into his mouth, and he clung to Steve’s legs as he twitched through the aftershocks of his orgasm.
And when Tony pushed back in, he punched out a moan from Steve’s lungs. Steve arched his back in pleasure. “You’re so beautiful, baby,” Tony praised, stroking the length of his throat. “Eyes on me. I want to see your beautiful blue eyes.”
Five…four…three…two… “Time is up!” Tony gleefully said when the minute hand reached ‘12.’ He couldn’t wait long enough for these students to flee…and there was still a student working on the exam. “You, hey, next to Mr. James, yes I’m talking to you. What about ‘time is up’ was unclear?”
Got something for my date!
“Compared to finding the Infinity Stones, I think your name is less important, Tony.”
in fact. His skin felt like it was trying to pull apart, and his mind was aching.
Everything.

Deal.
Tony understood; Steve knew Tony understood. “But I didn’t. Look at me Steve, baby, please.” Steve stared into Tony’s eyes: they were fully trusting, just like the way Steve trusted Tony the first time Tony dropped the feather into his lap.
When Tony awoke this time on the spaceship, he felt calmer and more relaxed. He finally made peace with Steve. Any lingering anger dissipated as he woke up, leaving determination in its wake.

“But—” Steve tried, and the recruiter shut him off with a look.
Your track record isn’t looking good right now, considering that you cause a fire every time you try to cook for Steve.
He was alone, all alone, no one wanted him—
Steve let out a dry sob, but he did as Tony asked, flapped his wings more powerfully. His wings were aching because he never done this before, but to hear Tony’s litany of praises in his ears, giving him constant encouragement, made Steve want to try harder. He flapped again, and this time, enough wind caught under his wings and lifted them into the sky.
As if he could hear Rhodey’s words, the muffled growling voice of Butterfingers sounded down the hallway. “
Tony blinked a few times and focused his eyes on Steve. “Coffee.”
Going to make one of my world famous omelettes. It’s so smooth that it’s gonna make him cream...Hottie’s not going to know what hit him
remember back in college when you used to know all the firefighters by name?
“You finished your game?” Tony asked, glancing at the screen. Bowser was dancing on the first place podium. “Oh good. Dinner’s ready.”

” A metal robot shaped like a pepper pot came whizzing down the hallway. A second robot with a claw for a hand chased after the first bot, beeping equally excitedly in greeting.
Tony shook his head, speechless with terror.
Hottie has a look of panic.
(When it came down to protecting Earth the first time around, when Loki opened the portal between Earth and the rest of the Universe, the team banded together in unity to fight for a common cause. The team may have been outnumbered, outgunned, out of their depth fighting something they had never encountered before, but with desperation came strength, and they won. It proved that a group of remarkable people with very different lives could work together when there was a battle that normal people could never fight. From different backgrounds, strangers became a team, and that team became family.)
The man tilted his head from side to side. “Of a sort. Time Lord. Name’s the Doctor, pleased to meet ya.”
Everything was in technicolor and overwhelming. The one thing that didn’t change was that there were still more flighted people than grounded ones, and there was not one person that had wings that were as dark as his.
Tony looked at Stevens, really looked at him, staring straight into his azure eyes and leaning slightly forward. “There is a lot of missing puzzle pieces that I don’t know yet. But I also think that you’re not from this time.”
But then, it was either this or go back home, facing the disgust and jeers of being flightless instead of fighting in the front lines. His fingers curled around the straps and unclasped them, the brace falling to the floor. Steve closed his eyes in shame.
After staring at Tony for a moment, he finally said, “Okay. I’ll upload the program.” His fingers flew over the keyboard, and Tony heaved the chestplate up to put it in its final resting place.
He felt a presence behind him.
“We need you,” Fury said.
“Steve,” Tony breathed, still facing forward. He exhaled heavily. With his eyes still shut, he turned around. “Cap.”
(The loss was too great to bear, so they kneeled, gripping the ground in hopes that they could catch even an echo of who had disappeared.)
and everything else...wasn’t. But when Tony saw the excitement on Stevens’s face, he wanted to share that with him.
Pepper, I assume you need an adult?
Of course you, an uncultured swine, wouldn’t understand the magnificent beauty in the masterpiece I tactfully crafted for
Tony, please, please, please, fuck me, please.”
But perhaps, when the battle was over and Loki was gone, his soulmate needn’t be a perfect replica of who he thought should be. Steve looked at Tony, his haunted face of nearly sacrificing himself for the sake of the world, and thought to himself,
Come on, man  👉👌👅🍆💦
Then his anger dissipated and left exhaustion in its wake. After all, he shouldn’t have been angry over something that was partly his fault. He just…he wanted to apologize correctly this time, make every word mean it because he wanted him back safe and sound.

on him and I’m just fucking sick of the flirting.”
Hell, he’d been the one
She pinned him with a look. “Talk. To. Him,” she said again, stressing every word.
Nebula’s voice was flat. “Because then I will have no purpose, and Thanos would be the ultimate ruler of the Universe, playing God to all. He is a madman, Stark, and he cannot have such power in his hands. There was a reason that all the stones were split in the first place – their power is too much for any one man to bear. Between you and I, I know him better: he played my father for decades, and Thanos ruined me completely, pitted me against Gamora, replaced me bit by bit with technology so that I could become stronger. He was a monster to me, and I became a monster because of him.” She growled here, grief and anger flashing on her face. She slammed a hand hard against the armrest, and the metal bent down at the force, creaking. “He killed my family, my original one, and then he killed Gamora, so it is my vow to end him and his reign of terror. Even if you don’t fight against Thanos, I plan to kill him, and with him, destroy the Infinity Stones so that no one else can do what he did.”
“Tony,” Steve gasped, reaching up for him. Tears dripped out of his eyes because he never had been so loved before. Tony grasped his outreach palm and tangled their fingers together. He kissed the back of his hand and nuzzled it.
As if sensing his presence, Tony looked up from his work and gave him a beatific smile. Steve watched as Tony’s mouth moved. Tony beckoned him in, and Steve walked through the doors.
During a quiet evening where the rest of the team were conspicuously absent, Steve absentmindedly picked at his covet feathers as he sat quietly in the couch of the communal living room, drawing Tony flying, his wings outstretched like he owned the world.
If he didn’t pluck his feathers all the time, he could have probably flew too. He wasn’t flightless, just...cursed. But with the fact that his wings had been in a back brace for years, the muscles must have atrophied too.
“Hive mind,” Tony said, acknowledging his words, and if Steve focused a little harder (which he definitely wasn’t doing), he could hear the praise in his voice, and Steve’s blush darkened a little harder. “Got it.”
Tomorrow became today, and his death was imminent. Dropping the plane into the Atlantic was America’s only hope, and he had one week left on his soulmate timer. Pity.
Steve was going to die of embarrassment.
“What do you want?” Tony asked, pushing him up against the wall and crowding into his space until there was no room between them. “Do you want me to hold you down and use you and—”
Tears prickled in his eyes until his vision of the feather became blurry. Now Tony knew how much of a freak he truly was. He nodded tersely, keeping his eyes down at his sketchbook.

Balancing the world, his ass. More like trying to play God when Thanos wasn’t one.

he thought to himself.
He wanted to go back to his Tony. Sure, his Tony may not have a physical body, but Stevens didn’t care; he just wanted to be with his man, forever. Instead, he was stuck outside, in the cold, wandering around like a lonely traveller with nothing to do, stranded in the middle of the cold Cambridge in February, 1989. He felt guilty to want Tony’s younger self, even though he was given permission.
But it was the suit that was most recognizable. For even though it wasn’t the distinctive blue suit with the bright red and white stripes, Tony could recognize the utterly distinctive star at the center of his chest.
Tony's overwhelmed.
That was a terrifying revelation.
He found his paper but also found a box of old electronics, mostly burnt out and long-obsolete stored in a corner of the ship. He rifted through it, noting the broken wiring and cracks of monitors. They were not ideal scraps, but with time, Tony could probably reuse them for something.
You forgot the genius billionaire philanthropist part.

Tony cut a quick glance to his best friend and resumed eye fucking the man he’d been vaguely obsessed with for about three years. “When did you know?”
We do.
Here at the Tower, the floor length mirrors showed all the flaws that were his wings. They were pitch black, as dark as the night, and it was masochistic that Steve continuously stared at them with hatred in his eyes.
I’ll DM you our secret entrance...Mr. Stark is currently having problems in the kitchen
The raw honesty of that statement took Tony’s breath away. He didn’t understand, or maybe even believe it, but he believed Steve believed it, and that was enough. “Bed,” he whispered.
“Okay, mother.”
see it?”
Tony gave him a look. “You know what I mean. This damned fucking wall.” Tony banged his fist against it (strange that it made no noise), and then he leaned forward, pressing his forehead against the barrier. He sighed again, tired. And old. He sounded like he aged twenty years. “I miss you.”
“Maybe,” Rhodey seemed skeptical. “Just seems that this year’s blackouts have occurred more often.”
“Then it isn’t your fault,” Yinsen said. “You deserve a second chance.”
Being on ground zero looked even worse than what the holograms had shown. Donned with their uniform, the Avengers stepped off the plank of the Quinjet at the heart of Times Square, seeing the utter emptiness of the people walking the war-torn streets. While New York had faced its fair share of war, its people had always endured, stood up, and rebuilt afterwards. This time, however, it seemed as thought Thanos’ victory had robbed them of all hope and the will to continue living.

They were both here - HYDRA, always alive, no matter what time period it was, and he had to stop it.
They were a block from Tony’s house when Stevens cleared his throat. He was carrying himself better, as if the walk in the chill shedded the effects of the incident earlier, and he was more self-assured. “I’m very sorry about what just happened there,” he said. “Something just came over me, and it was like I was hallucinating for a moment.”
Are you really live tweeting under the table?
Steve thought for a moment. “Is Tony in his workshop?”
Tony hesitated before he replied haltingly, “Maybe more like three days ago?”
”You should try my paella, mom’s recipe. I think it’ll knock your pants off.” Asshole is winking...with both eyes
“You trust me,” Tony said simply. It wasn’t a question, just a statement of fact, and Steve couldn’t deny those words at all.
“Hold up a second,” Tony interrupted hastily. “We didn’t discuss going back to fight Thanos again. We were just thoroughly defeated by him, and we were at full strength. How do you think we’re going to win when there are only two of us?”
Tony whines every time those cruel fingers mark him, pinching his nipples hard. His cock jerks. He hates it: he hates the way that his body isn't his anymore, he hates this house arrest, he hates the way that Steve takes and takes and takes, but most of all, he hates the way his traitorous body loves it. He shouldn't want this, but he does.
Steve put his coffee mug down on the nightstand and opened his arms, gesturing for Tony to return to them. “No, in fact, JARVIS?”
Tiny Steve acted similarly to how Steve acted when he first woke up in the new era. Everything was new and big and shiny. For Tiny Steve, however, everything must be multiplied by ten because everything was
“Bwubweebwub!” Tiny Tony said shyly. His tentacles seemed to be redder than normal, and Tiny Tony was staring right back at the centaur. He pulled his tentacles over the edge of the tank, and with the suction, he crawled down the glass until he landed on the countertop.
“Just give me a minute,” Tony said. “I need a minute.”
Steve bit his lip. He wasn’t going to, no matter how threatening Nat looked.
“Rhodey and I have been hoping you were going to stop sleeping your way through our supply chain managers and grow up, which thank you for doing that, by the way, just about two years too late.”
You tweet like a twelve-year-old Wattpad romance writer. Let it go bro, Steve hasn’t been your date since the great coffee debacle of August.
I had to look up “populous breasts.” Why is he disrespecting the entire female population like that?
Ugh, the way they’re staring at each other is disgusting
As much as Steve hoped he would see Tony more often now that he moved into the Tower, in reality, Tony was so busy with Stark Industries that it was rare that he would come down and make an appearance.
