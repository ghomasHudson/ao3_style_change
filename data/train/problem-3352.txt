Sam narrows his eyes very slightly, eyebrow arching, a moment later forcing himself to turn back to his laptop as though nothing is weird about the whole situation.
He hears Kaia laughing.
“Dean, I promise.”

“Long time no see.” Sam calls to Balthazar, who grins roguishly and inclines his head, Cas reappears a moment later.
"Okay so what was the deal? Maybe there's something in how it works, like a loophole or—“
6 hours after the uncertain arrival, 2 hours after Eileen did her final check on Cas, 1 hour after Sam did his subtle
“When you return, I will make you an Archangel.” Jack leans back in his chair, his confidence apparently restored by their conversation.
Trying to protect Dean. Always to protect Dean.
“Beautiful.” He answers simply, as it is the only word in the language of men that can even come close. Perhaps the only word which has ever come close.
“You okay?” He asks, Dean shrugs.
Dean’s brain isn’t connecting to his mouth, blood flow is not rushing up it seems.
“Why?” He grinds out.
"Perhaps loving Dean Winchester is just another gloriously improbable choice you will make, and this time, perhaps it will change you both for the better. Be happy Castiel.
“Listen, Cas— “ Dean takes a breath, he feels like he can’t breath, he can fix this, “I was going to tell you—“
Somehow she had known instantly that it was Castiel she was messaging. He is nearly convinced that she has some latent genes of foresight.
His team is led by a girl in her late twenties, tough and quick. She’s kind enough to stay close and be his buffer, somehow aware of his nervousness. He’s no longer looking at her though, his gaze drawn to the far end of the dingy space.

He stands, doing his best not to wake the mostly-angel; pads down the hallway, passing what is known informally as “Jack’s Room”, seeing the light still coming out from underneath the door.
His dad burnt the cards the next day while Sam was asleep, ripped Dean a new one and told him to keep a better watch on his little brother.
“You do not wish to have an orgasm?” The Angel asks seriously, after a few expressions cross his face.
“Maybe, it's not avoidance,
In what feels like a life long past they sat on adjacent park benches and discussed an uneasy alliance and the tet offensive, it was the first time Dean saw him smile, and
“Dean I—“
He called it
Cas watched their interaction carefully; noting that Dean was also pretending not to notice; their two charges had spent very little time in each other’s company prior to the new normal of holidays in the bunker with Sam and Eileen.
“So just top him off with Angel mojo and call it a day.”
“Sam do you remember when dad caught me holding hands with…nah, you probably don’t, you were still pretty young then.”
He breathes in and out.
“Mistletoe.” They say at the same time.
, is that Krissy Chambers,” Dean’s voice is loud and warm, his smile can be heard in each syllable. “Thought you and yours were down in Lousiana.”
Dean’s head snaps up, already glaring belligerently. “It’s not creepy. Plus he used to do it to me all the time. And besides uh, he sorta fell asleep on my shoulder, didn't want to wake him up.”
Not a word Castiel was used to hearing in his inner-monologue, but he was preoccupied to dwell on it. Because,
“He won’t come.” He mumbles, drooling blood, it’s hard to brace against a punch when your arms are numb. Everything is starting to get hazy; between the blood loss and fatigue.
"You in my head Cas?” Dean warns, more out of nervousness than anger, but the Angel flinches back.
former Angel of Heaven, Mr. “I love you Dean Winchester and you made me love the world” himself, gazing with at him with a horrified expression. Looking like he wishes he was still just enough of an angel to fly right out of their kitchen.

“I am real.” He assures, “We’re real. You’re home.” Cas stays in the doorway, looking so unfamiliar without his coat and tie, his white dress shirt stained with dried blood, hair a wild thicket.
Dean blinks, “No it wouldn’t,
“Sam, you and I both know what happens when either of us start thinking about being happy.”
Sam can't help but worry because Dean is free and at they're at peace and he is somehow worse off than before.

Dean managed to get a single text out to Sam without the guy noticing. Out of practice but he’s not a damn fool. He hoped that since hadn’t left the county alone in months, that his random “trip” would be weird enough for Sam to look into it.

It makes the hair on the back of Liam’s neck stand up.
“Yes.”

“It wasn’t the right timing, another instance where I was unsure what was allowed, At the time it was enough: You thought of me enough to make it. My first gift from someone cherished.”
Sam nods absently, hands Dean another mug, and a paper towel for his hand. “I mean, you're not a Winchester unless you've made a dumbass deal with a higher power—"
“Actually Sam,

They sit for a moment, Cas leans and rolls down the window a smidge, enjoying the tactile nature of a hand crank; the slight breath of crisp winter air. He remembers vaguely something Dean had said a long time ago, about taking little things for granted and offering a personal anecdote about being surprised that

One shoulder, is definitely dislocated; the other arm had been stomped pretty badly after he’d tried to escape for the third time. Dean had been hanging by his wrists for hours which wasn’t helping anything, it honestly might be worse than he thinks, but he hasn’t been able to feel from the shoulders up for at least a day.
“It is defeated.” He coughs up more of the stuff, and wipes his face in annoyance. “They have no reason to fear.”
“Not what I said.” He rumbles, pulling Cas back toward the bed, already leaning forward to tease the skin under the angel’s ear, he sniffs, pauses, nose wrinkling. “Cas, why do you smell like
“I know. Dean.” Jack is touching Dean’s wrist. He looks so young. “He won’t be able to remember
Deuteronomy 2:10 - The Mountain Goats
, in honor of you.”
So he walks alone and talks to Jack.
Sam’s response is a rude gesture. “So, what, were we going after vamps cause of a lead on Cas?”
As though through deep water he hears the garbled raspy voice; his heart trembles.
“Jesus Christ. Gotta pace yourself on that dirty talk there bud, you'll charm my pants right off if you're not careful.”
Sam is on the phone most days, hunters call in at all hours, asking for “the new bobby”. He tries to act all annoyed by it, but he's pleased, Dean knows.
Of course, being Dean, that means he had gone through the Christmas Eve festivities with their family, found family, and whatever hunters were within driving distance, with his usual good-natured banter and only the barest hint of unease.
“Well

“Hey Dean, what’s… up?” He types random garbled nonsense to keep his hands busy.
“He is not fully human, nor is he angel. It is… difficult for him in between. His vessel is…frayed. Amara is not sure how it will affect long term— but she’s certain that he will still eventually shatter, just slowly.”
Cas blinks twice. “I still need your help.”

With effort Dean turns his eyes back to the road.
Balthazar rolls his eyes dramatically, his eyes glow slightly in the near dark, they speak in low tones. “I’m just saying,
Cas rolls his eyes, but he smiles, a small just-for-Dean smile, and Dean’s heart catches in his chest.
I couldn't resist, I'm almost tempted to make this its own work, but regardless, my one-shot became two.

Cas makes a noncommittal noise, presses a kiss to the top of his head, shifting them until he can comfortably wrap his arm around Dean’s waist.
Besides, changing the way the world works might help kids thrive in a world where they don’t have to grow up the way he did--
“Why?” he rasps, his voice strained, teeth clenched, “Why do you always
“You know, Claire suggested we fight like normal people and just refuse to have sex with one another for a couple days—“
Sam crosses his arms and makes no attempt to move.
“Fajitas.” Cas says matter-of-factly, pushing past the fact that he’s letting Dean use him, It just, it doesn’t feel quite as bad as he expected.
Jack, Rowena, Garth, Charlie… Cas.
“Nah, but this might.” Another box from another pocket, this one smaller, plain and wooden. He pushes it into Cas’ hand a mix of shy and insistent.
“So Cas?”
Dean recognizes a familiar jittery hesitance at such open domesticity. He appreciates that she even showed up. Unknowingly, Jack had followed them; eager to spend more time with his prickly older adopted(chosen) sibling, whether she wished it or not.
and waits, looking as uncertain as the angel feels. “Not like, for your angel magic just… you.”
Jack frowns. “As long as he had grace and memories he would never completely sleep, and that meant the Empty could not rest; other Angels were starting to wake up—“
His coffee mug doesn’t have steam rising which means John ambushed him before he could even take a drink. There’s another cup across from it, also untouched. It’s Dean’s favorite mug, the handle rotated carefully so it would be ready when he walks in.
“They used a hell-kissed blade.” He hears a familiar voice say, muffled. “Bloody well prepared— looks like you might've be the real target. You can come out now. We’ve dispatched them.”
He peers suddenly,
He’s about to rejoin Sam— unwilling to spend much longer in this private space— but he notices a box, tucked between two books on the opposite, bedside table, the wrapping is familiar, green and red— '
Cas catches the mug with inhuman speed, sighing, “Dean please, don’t swear in front of—“
Dean chokes mid swig, pauses, the burger immediately dropped onto his plate, uncharacteristically forgotten.

"I’m Dean." He says, his knees lock, he chews his lip. "I’m uh— I’m pretty sure I’m an alcoholic."
“Thank you Dean.” He says, and means it. “I did not realize that there was any left in the bunker.” Cas leans into the familiarity of their connection, letting it soothe the tattered edges of his mind.
He takes the paperwork to Sam the next day.
“Fallen.” She corrects faintly, as she had been corrected so long ago. “So you

garden.
“Someone will see.” Cas is trying to be serious, but Dean can see the half grin playing in on his lips.
“Is he well enough to be doing that?” Balthazar asks loudly enough to earn a scathing look from Dean and a moderately ashamed expression from Castiel.
“What, you think I should ignore him? Let him work through it alone?” Dean’s voice rises, making Sam wince, “He’s family Sammy.”
He gets it.
Dean is thrilled by being called upon to tell taller and taller tales in response to their questions. Sam rolls his eyes, Eileen adds details with animation and laughing eyes. She laughingly tells him once that she had no idea she was dating redneck serial killer royalty; winks at Cas dramatically. Cas huffs, rolls his eyes and signs something that makes Eileen laugh.

me.” He sniffs and sighs. “Isn’t that sort of what we’re all looking for really?”
Dean squeezes his hand, and Cas squeezes back.
He shrugs, “The older I got the more I wanted to be like him, and being into guys definitely didn’t fit that. Plus I liked girls just fine, so I uh, made it work… it was just another thing to be ashamed of about myself.”
“Don’t play dumb chickenshit, sack up and answer the question.”
Though for days after Dean couldn’t shake the heavy disappointed feeling in his chest, the tightness he felt when he accidentally caught Cas' glance full on, like he'd missed something.
“I already did.” He says, charmingly against his lips, and Dean isn’t sure how he managed to forget that One: Castiel is
Sam wants to hug him, or tell him how proud he is, but an exposed Dean is also something of a cryptid. Sam is equally concerned that if he moves too suddenly his brother will just scamper into the darkness of his room like a frightened deer, and come out acting like the poster child for toxic masculinity.
Nice shot
Cas rolls his eyes, which Dean ignores and presses another fond kiss to his cheekbone, still talking, “I was going to speak to Rebekah and her team, about Salamandriel joining them, I believe he is ready to spend time in the field.”
He taps his fingers on his thigh, focuses on breathing in through his nose and out through his mouth like Bobby taught him when he was a kid.
“Y-yes sir.” Liam’s throat catches meeting Cas’ direct gaze for the first time, he falls back, inner eye blown wide.
Cas ignores the self-imposed warnings in his mind, He sees the way Dean is reliving his own regret, and as always his instinct is to rescue Dean, even from himself.
Dean finally looks up and takes a deep breath, nervous and stuttering, gaining confidence the longer he speaks,
“I was being romantic," He admits, "Highly dramatic as well, I believe it is a side-affect of being mostly human for so long.”
"You aren’t real. I don't want to see you.” He whispers into the dark.
“It’s April fools jackass—” Sam mumbles pleasantly,
, she has not spoken to him in over a week. Where did he say he was going?”
"I told you then, I don't want to talk about it. And, shocker,
Everything stops. He can’t breathe.
“Bitch.” Dean replies, always. And they’re okay again.
Jack hears the fury, he’d told Amara that Dean would not be happy about this.
Jack shakes his head. “That’s… not how it works Dean.”
if you’re god now, you’re still not allowed to say it, and Jack, whining is for babies.” He sighs. “So, you knew about the deal…
“Okay?”
Dean sits and drinks quietly, refilling his glass for the third time, staring.
“Okay. But instead you what— collared me like a puppy?” Dean teases, but his eyes are serious, he trusts that the angel has not brought up his time in hell without purpose.
Sam’s mouth twitches, “I mean, clearly he’s into trench coats—“
He nods, thankful. “Yes,
“Focus buddy.”
“He’s your boyfriend.”
be emotionally, the equivalent of a leaky faucet,
Dean shakes his head frantically, thoughts turned inward; eyes sorrowful.
Cas’ lips tilt up slightly, deciphering the muddled sentence, his eyes lighten, he shakes his head.
Cas doesn’t let him do this soft of thing often, growing awkward and cold when the hunter tries anything soft. Dean isn’t sure what that means in the long run, but the only plan he’s really got is making this the best damn week of Cas’ life.
He grins, unrepentantly pleased at his own cheesy line, calloused thumbs reaching up and brushing the tears out of the Angel’s eyes; Castiel’s joy is incandescent, it might be their bond but Dean’s pretty sure he’s glowing faintly.
that’s fucking hot.
his other still held in a vice grip. Cas turns,  head tilted, eyes concerned, toward his best friend. He's clearly seeking somewhat belated permission to do violence to Dean's not-quite-biological father.

Cas still hasn’t looked over, there’s steam rising from his mug,
” He keens, trying to keep his voice down, noticing the slight smirk playing along Cas’ lips. “Are you teasin’ me? Cause if you keep doing….
Castiel looks up to the green plant taped clumsily to the door’s arch, squinting suspiciously first at the plant, then at Dean whose eyes sparkle. “Who enforces such a law?” He asks, Dean takes a big drink of his reindeer mug.
He keeps his voice level and subdued; “Our intimacy has been… enjoyable.” He sees Dean nod jerkily out of the corner of his eye.
He tilts his head, “Yes, Erin, dealer’s choice.” He says proudly, remembering slang. “I do not wish to keep you if you’re busy.”

The world is suddenly very small; in a single breath they two are contained in the dust motes lazily dancing across Dean’s bedroom. The hunter bows his head,
—  just me,
Eyes snap open. “Not true” Cas protests.
Without looking back he reaches a quick behind him, snagging the Angel by the back pocket as he passes, pulling him insistently to his side and kissing him soundly. He winks broadly at the hoots and cheers from the surrounding men and women.
He holds his tongue, lets Sam and Cas asked the pertinent questions.
Dean doesn’t turn, his posture nervous and eager.
“Oh shi— I’ve still gotta do mine.” She groans, then leans forward as a thought strikes her. “Did

Dean refuses to let himself be intimidated by the ancient Eldritch being who (often) shares his bed and (recently) his life and sits heavily, Cas sighs and shifts on the bench, not quite away from him, but just enough to let Dean know he isn't pleased.
He stops for neither rest of respite, his true form lingers hazily around his vessel, snapping at anyone who dares tread too close. If he stops he can feel the acid burn around the edges— but he cannot rest until he has saved all he hurt and the list is ever long.

Dean shrinks in, feels everything slipping through his fingers, but Cas isn’t done.
Dean for whatever reason and he’s like 98% sure Dean’s got the big L on his brain right now.
Dean takes another hefty gulp of his bottle and sighs. “Has uh, has Cas, you know, ever mentioned, if he likes any particular type of, um, clothes.” He plays with a gash in the wall where Billie’s scythe had cut into the wood and stone “You know like… like, pants and shoes and socks and stuff…” He adds, just in case Sam isn’t sure what

The bartender, Erin, watches the two of them with curiosity, glancing from the hunter’s sunshine smile down to the tanned hand still holding tightly to the angel back up to Cas’ confused expression.
“About Cas or about guys?” He watches his little brother’s eyes widen.

“What’s got your motor all revved?” Dean asks cheekily, settling his hands to a safer space, around Cas’ thick hips, digging into the strength of them. “Not at all complaining by the way—“
He says proudly, “Got up early and went downtown to this little coffee shop I saw,
All in all they do a pretty good job of not talking about Cas in front of Dean. Pissed him off that 8 months on and everyone still tiptoes around the whole situation. He knows they must know it’s his fault.
“Say it again.”
His head tilts, his eyes shine.
Cas frowns and reaches into his vast knowledge, “I would not wish to wed anyone in the host.” He confirms, noting Dean's relief with amusement.
A long pause, a bitter snort.
“I know.” He replies gruffly, like he hadn't been working up his courage to even bring it up all day.
Cas blinks slowly as a spatula comes flying toward his brother’s head, and only a feat of Grace-enhanced movement prevents it from hitting its target.

“You think you’ll make him happy? Soulmates?” Her voice sounds skeptical, he knows her story too well to misunderstand the bitterness toward fated love.
Dean clears his throat, noting the Gandalf quote before adding, “Plus, nobody said you can’t be god from our backyard right?”
Very little has changed about the kid since becoming one of the most powerful cosmic creatures in the known universe. He’s bubbly, empathetic, kind, and best of all, genuinely hopeful. Dean isn’t quite sure how their three dysfunctional asses raised such a great kid, and it’s clear by the way Cas looks at Jack he thinks the same thing.
I don't think i've ever prayed so much in my life..." He chuckles nervously.
He shivers, the voice in his head is so familiar, the low gravelly tones weaved with sincerity and disdain.
Okay… so the thing is…” He throws a hand up, pointer finger raised for emphasis. “I knew she thought it, and then I kinda realized it was sorta true, and it really didn’t bug me. The idea of being on a date with Cas… it felt kinda… right?”
"She said, that he's um... he's having trouble with light, and uh noise, stimulation..." He signing rapid-fire, lips mouthing the words, brow more and more scrunched, Sam snaps his head toward the celestial in the room. "Jack, is, is time different in the Empty?"
Dean wakes and finds Cas looking at him with warm eyes, a blue so poignant it makes the sky seem faded.
He freezes, "Damnit Sammy, I'm
Dean turns to Liam with childish glee.
Cas glances at Dean; begins blowing out the candles, sliding the chocolate covered strawberries back into their packaging, looking apologetically at Dean who nods in agreeable resignation.
Castiel lets out a small gust of air through his nose, letting himself infinitely appreciate Dean’s ability to find humor in any situation no matter how painful. It happened more often in the early days, before the betrayals, lies and pain. The hunter would find his eyes and smile like they shared a secret, making references that half the time Cas didn’t even understand. Their bond allowed Cas to sense the intent, to feel unexpected kindness rather than pity aimed toward the awkward celestial.
It feels like a dream: an Angel sitting in his kitchen looking soft and rumpled, no suit jacket, no tie, just a simple white shirt, buttons undone or ripped off. The barest shadow lingers around his broad shoulders, his knuckles are bloody and unhealed.
Dean pushes laboriously to his feet before the panic can set in, impulsively searching for something to eat, to distract.

Dean lumbers back into the kitchen minutes later, familiar leather jacket in one hand.
“No, that’s not—

heard about them.” Krissy laughs at something one of the hunters says as they pass, headed obviously over to the men in question.
The younger Winchester struggles to find words, Dean needs this. More often than not Sam would find himself forcing Dean to process the endless shit they go through by provoking his brother until everything bubbles up past the surface. It's a 50/50 chance that Dean doesn't punch him in the face at some point. Somehow the odds have gotten better as they've gotten older.
Cas stares at the top of Dean’s head, at the silver hairs shining in the light, noticing for the first time how long it’s grown since he remembered seeing it last, distracted by the way it shifts as he moves.
“You know Sam would have been more of an ass about it… beat around the fuckin’ bush for at least three more beers.“ His curdled look would intimidate most.
Jack is waiting when the seam to the Empty belches outward with a flare of light, along with a seemingly endless fountain of black slime.
Cas’ breath quickens suddenly, his eyes unfocus, pale again, pressing back against the wall.
Dean turns the engine off, makes no move to get out.

crawls into bed with him, he lets the hunter press his clammy self against him without even a word of complaint. Dean leans his head wearily against Cas’ shoulder, sniffing pathetically.
Jack’s young face relaxes and his sunshine smile returns. “It is perhaps better that he is not here. I have things to tell you.”
John’s head swivels slightly, on guard.
“Yes.” Jack’s eyes go wide. “I mean no. It is a secret.” He looks incredibly guilty, all of Dean’s sourness dissipates into affection. Even now that Jack’s the all-knowing master of the universe he’s still shit at keeping secrets from Dean.
Dean bounces happily, winding Cas up still makes it to top-ten things he enjoys in life. Plus this was the most emotion Cas had expressed in the week since he’d been home.
He skips the stairs and flies directly into the master bedroom, decorated with the same warring sense of comfort and economy.
Cas searches his face for the truth in those words, straining like he wants to believe him. Dean feels his heart in his throat, it’s beating so fast he can barely think.
For the first time in 10 months he reaches out across their bond: instantly gold-tipped pain and yearning comes screaming down their connection. The pain spikes unexpectedly and he leans into it, trying to pinpoint his charge’s location. The agony is overwhelming; excruciating in detail.

Dean gazes at the man beside him, Cas wrinkles his brow at the attention; Dean’s lips are already quirking into the fondest of smiles, debating making out with him right there in front of Jack. Cas sees the intent and shakes his head imperceptibly.
Dean shrugs and starts digging through the fridge aimlessly, “Honestly, it was a little unclear, you married a very blurry, lady-shaped person and named your son after me—“

John shakes his head once, and storms into the hall. Sam is there in the stairway between him and the portal still open outside. Sam’s face says he heard the whole exchange in the kitchen.
“Hey Dean!” Erin pops her head in, “Someone’s here to see you, says they’re an old friend.”

The confidence, the pouty-ness, the anger, dissolves.

“I thought you said you wished for us to sleep in your room moving forward? Memory foam?” He nudges the doop open a little wider, Dean sees the neat duffel in his hand. ”I was gathering my things, to make it less obvious to Sam and the rest that we are…”
“He will be.” He nearly shouts surprising himself. “I’m gonna make sure of it.”
He grabs Cas by the chin, kissing him insistently until the angel gives up his righteous anger, and drops the paper bag onto the table with a crunch.

His hands slip up to surround Dean’s face, holding it like some precious and beautiful thing and he shakes his head once again.

“You are wrong though.” Cas says, breaking the moment, Dean frowns.
When he sits again, his green eyes aren’t angry, “You gotta lay off the sauce Cas.” He winks; it’s his way of apologizing for his outburst.
A nauseating mix of grace and corruption, doubt and faith.
“So…” It's too late for Sam to go back to sleep now, he might as well change into something he can run in. “You’ve just been watching him sleep?”
Cas leans back and closes his eyes, the faintest hint of a smile playing across his face. “You cried at the end of

Dean looks disappointed, but nods.
“For?” Cas rumbles, eyes on the screen.
He buys the clothes he likes, even if they aren’t practical, and gets reading glasses, cause his eyes hurt when he reads before bed and apparently he’s farsighted as hell. He stops cursing at the grey hairs he sees in the mirror. Mostly.
“You're losing your touch Wings,
Dean pulls back slightly, surprised. “Why didn’t you ask?”
Jack and Amara had explained cautiously that they were uncertain of the efficacy of this mission. Their confidence rested on the fact that he was the only Angel,
“—I mean I
Are you lonely?”
The whole place reminds Cas of Dean's small room in the bunker, tidy and quaint. The walls are dotted with memories: artistic car parts, band memorabilia and countless photographs. Most of the furniture seems handmade; earthy and overstuffed.
Cas walks for hours in the snow to clear his head and breathe deep, It helps most times, being outside, able to see the sky. The Bunker had always represented safety and security, but since being back it has felt oddly stifling and now even the presence of Dean gives him a skittering sense of anxiety.
The past couple days hadn’t set right, every time he gets a chance to talk to Cas he turns into chickenshit and dodges.
Sam chose
Cas frowns, Dean works his jaw soundlessly, he knows he isn’t making much sense,
“We good?”
Cas piles blankets on him, ignores his protests, insisting the google told him it was a good idea, he chooses Lord of the Rings, Dean grumbles, mostly about the blankets.

the saying—“
“Do you… do you like it?” Cas stands off to his left, the breeze picks at his loose t-shirt, he’s not nervous per se, just eager to please the righteous man, as he always has been. When Dean’s eyes meet his, they’re wide and very faintly misty.
The box is the final piece in his plan to keep Cas around.

“I cannot claim control over what will happen next, if you

either, unless you help him. He won’t let himself be happy—”
Chest to chest, he can feel Dean breath, human instinct blinds him, he grinds lightly against him, watching curiously, seeing Dean’s face go wide with want.
“Why don’t I remember any of that?” Cas hears the anger in Dean’s words. “The stuff from hell.”

“I understood the pun.” Cas interrupts, dryly, clearly for Sam’s benefit, signing something sly to Eileen. “I apparently did not find it

He says it so much to himself that he almost believes it.
Cas shrugs; keeps his eyes on his hands, the trembling has grown worse during Dean’s monologue, he tucks them under the edge of the table; his head is starting to throb, but the pain grounds him.. “I don’t— Dean— I…”
“Awesome. You should probably go get headphones.” He’s standing, and pulling Cas to his feet.
The lights inside are low and amber, the back wall lined with bottles, a ladder leaned on the wall in order to reach the highest shelves. The crowd is still small, as it is still early in the evening. The clientele young, well-dressed, mostly couples dotted around the cozy, polished, leather booths. Cas tugs on the sleeve of his borrowed flannel and feels out of place.
Cas shakes his head, “Have you ever tried to tell him no?” He says tiredly, hearing Dean chuckle,
Krissy and Liam watch the whole interaction in something kin to fascination. “How long have ya’ll been married again?” Krissy asks
She said with a lopsided smile,
“And in the meantime you’re just gonna what? Explore your sexuality cause Cas is willing? Can’t you see that’s fucked up?”

His eyes snap open, he didn’t hear Dean come over, didn’t hear the engine roar up, the soft crunch of snow.
Dean breathes, “You have me. Always have, I think.”
.” The Demon instructs.
John reels back slightly as though Dean’s words are somehow made physical; pummeling him mercilessly.
“I don’t know Sam. I’ve lost him, I’ve hurt him, I lied and used him— and he still— he still loved me the whole…” Dean’s hands ball into fists at his side. “Jack brought him back, and it felt like… a chance.”
Cas chuckles, thinking through his words, fingers carding through the wavy hair at Dean’s temple. “They are… dark, Six, because I am Seraphim; when fully manifested they are fearsome and filled with eyes.”
“So, I did what you said, I uh, I took Cas out, like, to this snooty place downtown… I mean it’s no

Cas counts again and frowns. They’re missing a gift.
“Point taken,” She adds, (almost) fondly. "He’s an hour outside Huron."
“Please.” Dean whines. But he isn’t begging out of fear.
Viciousness creeps into his voice, Cas reaches forward, grips Dean’s elbow in a blind attempt to stop whatever is brewing from happening. Dean turns; fixes him with an unreadable look before pulling the Angel’s hand from the back of his arm and very surprisingly (to both of them) clasping it firmly in his own.

“I wondered, when you gave it to me, if it was a gesture of affection.”
His life takes on a still sort of peacefulness, Dean works until close at the shop and then drives Baby out to his house where he either fishes or beats on whatever new construction project he’s dreamed up.
Late one evening, he notices the color suddenly washes from Cas' face mid-movie night, Dean is ready, up and across the room, bending low to speak slowly and carefully.

from the guy who literally just spent the last few minutes... his eyes dart back to Cas' lips and instead of thoughts there's a neat little warm feeling in his mind.
When Erin notices he puts himself on the schedule to close every Wednesday, she doesn't comment.
Cas’ eyes flit up, he pauses in his movement, Dean pants open mouthed, eyes blown so wide there’s barely any green.
He winks.
“Hey, hey, Listen to me Cas— Cas you’re in the bunker—
Not all those who were sent to the Empty are allowed free roam in their respective realms. Jack and Rowena have much to evaluate.
“I hope they are correct,” Cas continues, “I called Kaia and she offered some recommendations…” He watches Dean, “I thought you might enjoy sketching the places we visit.”
By the next morning, Sam is convinced that he dreamed the whole thing. They’re all sitting in the kitchen; most of the hunters still sleeping off their respective hangovers or hunts.

“You know— near the end there, after you…”
After that the Angel makes an effort, he sits off to the side, content to listen to the Hunters talk and laugh and reminisce.
“All I need is four hours you know that; I’ll be right as rain.” Regardless, Dean collapses onto the bed. “You’ll be here when I wake up though right? No take backs? I

The smell grows stronger, not quite the metallic tang of spilled blood. It’s deeper, more cloying and suffocating. He recognizes it then, his own room smells the same:
He hooks into Cas’ belt loops, pulls them from his hips.
“Sure, heard some things, that uh, it’s getting better up there for you… all.”

“It’s his favorite.” Cas admits, seeming to take his explanation at face value.

He doesn’t apologize in the prayers.

Such a simple concept, but he doesn’t think Dean means home in the way that Cas feels it. Home is not the warded walls of the Bunker or even the back seat of the Impala watching the world go past.

Cas tries to wrench his hand hand free again, pulling away from Dean's protective stance, separating so as to aim John’s anger.

“Yes Dean,” He whispers, burying his nose in the hunter’s hair. “I am.”
“Oh, hey, uh, Cas.” He says sleepily, cutting off a yawn. “You good?”
Dean’s trying, more than ever before, but this, this feels different.
Hunter rule #1. He’d said it with surly bravado for years, charming, cool and casual.
“Careful old man.” She teases, “Getting pretty feeble on me, sure you’re gonna be able to take on these vamps? Should I go get your walker and cane, let you man the radio instead?”
Dean gotten the gifts out of the back of his car alone, ignoring Cas standing awkwardly; slammed the trunk shut and stomped inside without a backward glance.
Cas looks sharply at him, eyes lingering, understanding import of the macabre promise. If time passes they don’t notice. It could have been a few minutes, or it could be a fleeting and unimportant millennia sitting on that park bench together.
“First: fuck you.” He says, finger raised. “And B: Last time I checked you got Eileen back with all her damn memories
“—Husband.” Sam finishes, Dean stops dead, “Yeah dude, I was at your wedding…” He hears someone’s sleepy murmur, “Trust me,
A door swings open to the right, Cas doesn’t even glance backward, knowing that Balthazar will make quick work of him. Movement, too fast for the naked eye; the Demon is subdued, exorcised with a few carefully whispered words.
Bolder now he looks up at the formidable mother, willing himself to remember that he has faced down gods and entities with far less concern.
Castiel's voice sounds scorched, unused. The lamp in the corner begins to blink off and on, the high hum increases. Dean watches as faint, fearsome edges of dark shapes extend past the angel’s shoulders, hanging off the edge of the bed, curling defensively around the bony man. They don’t look the way he remembered, light seems to be sucked into them, they’re tattered and frayed. His eyes start to burn—
“You came for me.” Dean murmurs, still trying to understand the gently iridescent layer between them and the room.
“Everything is too large, but it will be fine.” Cas assumes the extended stare is negative, he still isn’t in a good mood.
Cas looks down his rough human hands, hands that held and created and built and he smiles.
“Sure sure, but does he know that?”
“Cause I want you to feel comfortable.” Dean retorts, hand now on the small of Cas’ back, pushing him to follow Erin. He only drops his hold on the Angel when they reach a booth at the back corner of the pub. Dean flashes a quick smile and excuses himself to go to “the little boys room”.

“—Dean you aren’t trying to… date Castiel, to have a measuring contest with Meg, who is… very dead, right?”
Cas laughs widely at Eileen's quick hands, they're trying to teach Jack how to wink; something winds so tight in Dean's chest he can barely breathe.
“Jack helped… Um.” Dean pulls one of the gleaming rings out and fidgets with it. “It’s the uh, the same material as your angel blades are uh, made them out of the first one you gave me.” He looks up to find Cas staring, the angel’s eyes filled with something that shouldn’t fit inside someone finite, his words begin to stutter nervously.

“What the fu—“
“Nearly forgot that bit.” The Angel groans, flopping onto his back, and coughs. “But I see you’ve done your best to make it right, more than I would do.” He admits, he notices Jack standing nervously nearby.

it took us so long to find you in hell." He pauses, knowing the pain they had caused him by the delay. "We had been assaulting the abyss for what felt like an age— when we got word of your location, the enemy knew, and their final stand was bloodier than ever before—” He closed his eyes, could still smell the sulphur, the warmth of the pits, could hear the screams of enemies and friends alike in that forsaken place.
Balthazar laughs, he snaps his fingers and a glass of wine appears. “You’re right— just a few favorites, had to talk Gabriel out of coming down to visit the larger brother— Sam was it? I got the distinct impression that he was
“Still scares the shit out of me.” Dean admits, voice a little too fierce for his light words. “I’ve seen you die enough alright? I don’t want to go through that ever again. I told you and I meant it: The next time we go, it’s together or not at all.”
“You, Dean.” Jack replies, no longer sunshine, but kind, and merciful all the same. “He saved his last moments with you.”
"I'm sorry, I'm sorry,
“Dean, you’re up early.”
“Which part?” Cas asks, there’s an almost familiar fondness in his voice.

Cas takes a breath, he hasn’t been this nervous in a long time. He raises his hand and knocks. The door opens a moment later,
“I mean it’s great, like super awesome. But, yeah, I want you to know that.” He rests his forehead against the other, thumbs rubbing gentle crescents across his cheekbones “I love you, and I want you.” It’s still a strangled gasp, each syllable tied to his heart. “Just. You.”
Cas nods, his eyes still thoughtful, “I suppose there could be a binding invocation of sorts, knitting our souls as one before heaven, I believe it was called our Divine Right of Conquest…” His lips quirk, "Divine

Fortunately for Jack both of them seem to adore him enough to not try to violently depose him. Dean also thinks that maybe neither of them feel confident enough to anger any of his fathers.

Cas sighs, somehow imbuing it with the general vibe that he’s in love with the most insufferable idiot of all time.
The hunter throws his arm up over his eyes and sighs, “I’m starting to think you say crap like that just to make my brain short out and get all fluttery n’ shit.”
“You’re being dramatic, not everyone knows that I was—“
“Trying to keep it casual. I respect it. But you seem to really like him.”

Liam learned quickly (painfully) that American hunters don’t like being scanned on principle. He feels more than sees that he’s been noticed, and snaps off the quick look, hoping that he hasn’t gotten anyone’s attention. He hadn’t even had time to look at the other man.
“Uh,” Dean yanks on his jeans and thinks of dead animals,
“Did you mean it?” Cas asks, sort of breathless, and out of character for him, endearing and (mostly) human.

His brother eyes him flatly,“If the guy has been in love with me for 12 years, and was willing to just… be near me and get nothing out of it, and think he couldn’t ever have what he wanted…” Dean’s voice softens, and it takes him a minute before he continues. “Cause he thought I was some sort of toxic repressed bastard.”

You know I, I had— had a lot of trouble, trying to figure out life— cause, living a longer time in hell than I had on earth it really fucks with your melon, not to mention uh, what…what I did there.” Dean’s voice grows small, filled with shame, like it always does when he talked about his time below.
"Listen, I know ya'll are worried about me, but I'm fine, he was only in there, what, like a couple weeks? He's been through worse." His tone is forced and casual, but he knows Sam is watching the way his eyes dart to the doorway. It's been a few years but in a fair fight he's pretty sure he could get the upper hand.
“His grace. He’s hidden it so deeply, I can’t forcibly retrieve it without harming him. It’s so intertwined with his memories of you, it would rip him apart.”
“Every time.” Cas affirms, as if he isn’t saying that he loves him, chooses him, delights in him, as if it isn’t earth-shattering information and the cheesiest pick up line he’s ever heard.

Cas slides his palms from Dean’s knees up to where the hunter’s legs thicken, he pushes his legs wider, Dean winces at the stretch, watching the Angel, whose thumbs have dropped downward to Dean’s ass. Spreading his cheeks and staring intently at his pucker, Dean blushes, uncomfortable with this decidedly physical vulnerability.

He usually does okay, makes it through dinner, pays and all; every time he drops them off and smiles says something about work in the morning— one or two times they linger and smirk in the time-honored way.
“That was years ago.” Cas replies, still staring out the window, cheek pressed against the glass, it fogs up with each exhale, he doesn't seem to notice.
“Oh.” Cas looks dubious, self-conscious, his hands crumple into fists. “I didn’t realize it was so unpleasant.”
“I’m going to send you to Rowena.” Cas replies flatly. “Your treatment at her hands will depend on what you tell me here.”
Liam can’t help but stare, he wonders absently if Dean is aware that his very essence is hemmed in with the purest light of the heavens.
He almost smacks himself, rushing to the paper calendar— already switched to April— blank. A few AA meetings noted in Dean’s scrawl, but no notes in Cas’ careful handwriting or vague doodles that the angel seems to think function as reminders.

done that before.
Cas is there (always), tucking the abandoned boots into the bag, handling the socks with distaste and amusement. He pulls out a pair of sandals, ready to hand them over; but Dean’s already rolling his jeans up to his knees, smiling widely as he’s tears off toward the water, whooping in glee when he feels the January chill.
His eyes are drawn to something on the shoulder. He knows dried blood, he’s cleaned it out of his coat many a time. Cas pauses, flipping on the lamp absently and peering closely.

Dean scrubs his hair and paces, pouring himself a glass of whiskey, taking a sip. He sets it back down, walks two feet away and then stomps back and picked it up again, draining it.
Dean’s phone buzzes on the bedside table.
“I dunno.” He argues. “Back in the day, your hair used to do this thing where it would stick up all over” he imitates Cas’ hair with his hands. “It was pretty damn cute.”
“I don’t think I can Sammy, I don't...

He makes his way into the hallway drowsily, Dean’s door already open and his brother is already in the hallway, gun in hand and looking, well, like he’d been crying.
“You done?” Dean’s voice is gruff, his back to Sam, still fussing over the stove, Sam can hear that he’s pleased.

“—If I am going to do this for him, I want it to be good.” He mutters, embarrassed.
But this time Dean parks, actually pays the meter, smiles proudly at something an old man says about Baby. He notices Cas still sitting awkwardly inside, pulls a face and gestures for him to follow.

Cas shrugs, sinking elegantly into the overstuffed chair. “Full again, hopeful for the first time in ages, I’m sure Jack has told you—“

“Are you happy?” Cas is staring out at the night, Dean’s fingers go still on his neck.

Cas’ head turns into the regular soft tilt, Dean’s face warms, a smile creeping it’s way in, and continues less awkwardly.

“I wasn’t thinking.” Cas admits softly; Dean cracks one eye open and there’s the lightest dusting of color on the Angel’s cheekbones, “You were about to do violence on my behalf, it was…” His eyes roll around as he searches for the right word, “Sexy.”
Background music plays muffled over their speakers, Cas
“I believe that is fair, after I went insane and murdered you.”
“Most of the time, they don’t have anywhere to go. And everyone thinks they’re monsters, or created them just to use them, and nobody,” He says firmly. “

“So which did you choose?” Dean asks the ceiling fan, voice rough with near sleep, one hand playing with Castiel’s elbow skin, which annoys the Angel and is unofficially half the point in doing so.
The angel nearly pouts, “Maybe it has more to do with who gave it.”
“Home.”

“I guess angels really were always watching over him.” She murmurs.
for the first time in his adult life, how painfully eager he'd been for Cas to approve. To stay.
The dream comes back in bits and pieces,
Cas’ gaze slips back to the sky and he nods gracefully.
They cannot simply jump from place to place inside the wards here. This hunt is more visceral; they rely on the metallic taste of gore in the air to lead them toward their quarry.
“Uh, the

Luckily, Eileen appears and derails the Winchester v. Winchester hallways prize fight. She eyes them curiously, sensing the tension, pulling the door shut behind her. Signs tersely to Sam, her eyes serious, eyebrows pinched. Sam responds instantly signing almost as quickly.
Castiel detects the resentfulness in his voice, but misinterprets the venom.
“I don’t know what I’m doing either— But I do know that I don’t want it to be like it was before. I don’t want to hurt him anymore.”
Sam rolls his eyes, watching his brother prepare breakfast at… 430am for his platonic angel partner of 12 years.
sorry Cas. I’m… just sorry.”
Cas’ brow furrows, and the honey glow Dean might have felt quickly flees upon being confronted by the archness of an annoyed and moderately human Castiel. “It was because I would not have been able to fulfill my mission if we had been truly wed, I would have been honor bound to stay.”
Cas feels his vessel bristle at the words, he isn’t
“Can you believe,” Cas says later with venom, while revealing the homemade waffles tucked inside his bag and further affirming his angelic status, “People just go on the internet and tell

Dean snorts, enjoying the return of a little fire. “Yeah okay fine— old but like
“ Dean’s hands move to touch himself, stuttering to a stop when Cas’ eyebrow arches. Cas presses a gentle kiss to the pucker. Dean finds enough mental capacity to stretch backward to his side table and pull out a tub of lube (unopened, Cas notes smugly) and passes it to the angel, who covers his finger and slides it into place, there’s a burn at the stretch, in and out it moves, before looking at Dean, who's already got his own cock in hand,

Dean yelps, dropping his tools with a clatter, clutching his heart, remaining on his knees, sweat dripping off his forehead.

“Of course he did.” He thinks he’s imagining the smugness in her voice. He is not.

Being human is so visceral, so
Dean Winchester dithers on the sidewalk, “Cas, how about let’s walk… I gotta, I gotta talk to you about something.”
“You think? Stealing a motorcycle and driving off in a furious blaze of glory seemed pretty on brand, actually.”
They assume a face he recognizes, now close, this face intended to inflict pain, green eyes gaze out and it hits its mark. But the voice is still theirs, a perverse twist of memory.
“For the last damn time Dean, that is

emotions as a whole, are a pain in the ass and a massive distraction all rolled into the same ball of nonsense.
“Will that appease the Fae?” Cas asks, and Dean knows him so damn well he can hear the amusement in his voice.
When he turns to look daringly back up, John’s face is curled with unconcealed disgust.
at the sight of Castiel: Angel of the Lord, Vessel of Mercy, Warrior of Heaven standing in the doorway of his room in a blue flannel that Dean had worn maybe once (not his color, according to an Elle magazine he’d picked up ‘by accident’ during a stakeout), and a pair of Dean’s tightest old jeans. They’re hanging so loose off his hips that Dean makes a mental note to buy him a belt, or stop looking at the way his hipbones show below the
“Took you long enough.” He’s got both his hands flat on Cas’ chest, leaning down to bite his lip; Cas doesn’t let him have control for long. “I’m never making you breakfast again if you’re gonna eat slower than damn molasses.”
If he’s completely honest,
?” She says the word like one would hold a particularly smelly pair of socks.
The tension that’s been around for most of their lives eases slowly and suddenly. Sam shyly starts showing off.
“How was the Christmas Shopping Mister Dean—“
This is nothing new to the Angel as he has spent more than a decade adjacent to two conventionally attractive brothers. He takes it all in with irritation, and the self-satisfaction of being the only one who has seen the light which rolls off Dean Winchester’s soul.
“—The deal was happiness, Sam." He interrupts, "He had to be
Cas is still wearing Dean’s shirt.
“I’ve been thinking.” Dean starts suddenly, anxiously, interrupting the Angel's contemplation.
“He loves me.“ Castiel says, ducking his head shyly, a gesture softened by Balthazar knowing him for many years.
The smallest quirk at the corner of Cas’ mouth, he moves quietly like a cat across the space of the room and sits in the chair, which Dean notices is definitely from the living room; now pulled close to the bedside.
Cas only winks, blinking once, before wiping his hand on Dean’s shirt and walking out the door, passing Sam on his way, who looks between the two of them and the darkened room, his eyes narrowing with disbelief.
“I’m not made of glass. You forget that though I am not completely an angel, I am still very much
Dean nods.
Dean seizes his wrist, shakes his head stubbornly. “It’s just cause I’ve been working outside on the house, probably some sort of damn cold. Listen, go out there and steal Sam’s other laptop, it’s in the library. Stop fussing— I’m fine.”
The kitchen light was left on, drawing him in. This space is wide and bright, coffee machine gleaming in the corner; couple of books stacked haphazardly on the island in the center. Cookbooks mostly, a car repair manual, two books on sign language, one on the care and keeping of succulents.

“So?” Dean quips. “Go ahead, lay it on me, bitch away.”
There was no justice to Castiel’s sacrifice.

They’d had exactly two screaming matches in the course of 8 days; by the end, one of them (Dean) would go outside, take a walk, calm down and feel like absolute shit before walking back in, ready to apologize, only to find the other (Cas) frantically trying to scrape whatever he had burnt, while trying to cook a peace offering, into the trash.
“Amazing how trauma and falling in lo—" Dean looks at him sharply. "
“Gross.”

The Angel had added carefully, as though instructed.
He wants to burn the jacket. The tie, the clothes that still kinda smell like him.

“Untrue, that was the second time we met. “
A cold, trickle of fear claws up into Dean's heart. "Bud, how long was Cas in there?"
— nearly a palace in comparison— no liquor though. Wasn’t your boy a bit of lush back in the day?“
Cas is standing unnaturally still in the center of their—his— room. It’s been nearly a week since the angel had a hard day, he’s seemed so happy. But he probably got overwhelmed with all the people and noise, Dean is across the room in two strides, he reaches out—
Balthazar's grin widens, "Any chance there's enough for three?"
old, like me. Do they fit?” He asks,
“Which part?” Green eyes flit up, a line of concentration appears between his eyes, Cas resists the urge to press a finger to it, smooth it, “The shit about drinking deeply from my fountain or climbing me like a vine and taking hold of my fruit?”
“Castiel.” She says, inclining her head slightly when he doesn’t respond.
"The entity known as the Empty is not constrained by the boundaries of linear time."
“And we both know you’re not compensating for anything.” Still cheeky, still Dean Winchester.
His breath catches, he looks away, misses Dean’s soft smile.
He turns too suddenly to act like he hadn’t been waiting for this moment, Cas looks sorry.
Dean’s thumb brushes underneath Cas’ ear, tightening slightly.
overwhelmed
“Sure, sunshine.” Dean says to Cas, his eyes drop suddenly to Liam, voice lowering unexpectedly into an intimidating range, fixing Liam with a cool stare.
Whatever Sam might have said is cut off, phone and pistol dropped on the counter, Dean is across the kitchen and pulling Cas into his arms in a flurry of movement.

Jack is gleefully two steps ahead and clearly proud that he is leading the conversation, “When two people love each other very much— we talked,

Eileen is still standing, watching the two of them grin at each other.
“It’s still his choice to make.” Jack says finally. “You taught him that.”
“Lad.” Rowena says quietly to Cas, her hands moving swiftly, preparing the ingredients for her spell and watching her demons and Jack’s angels attempt to intimidate each other in an endless cycle. “We’ve had our differences, I won’t deny it and neither shall you. But, I’ll be
He throws his hands up. "Dean. The guy gave up heaven for you. After knowing you for like… 5 minutes.”
For three weeks Dean’s routine exclusively became a cycle of finding out ways to retrieve Cas (who isn't dead. just lost.), sneaking out to the liquor store like a naughty kid, getting too wasted to feel and somehow making it home.
“You probably think I’m a dumbass.” She says dryly, they’re staining chairs, Dean’s teaching himself how to use a welding arc. He still has all his fingers, neither of them are blind, they’re both wearing goggles. He considers the whole day a win.
He sneers the word
“Damn straight he does.” His brother retorts enthusiastically before realizing, “I mean, yeah, Cas told me he does.” Then as an afterthought. “Asshole.”
“Was that the year we bought him the bike?” Cas asks through a mouthful of eggs, sounding more confident,
“Promise me.” He repeats slowly, his large hands slip into the back of Dean’s long hair and tug very gently. Dean shivers, tilting his head back, instinctively exposing his neck. The predator in him acknowledges that he is not the most dangerous being in the room.
“Heaven.” He says simply, like it’s an everyday occurrence, like Dean doesn’t have an Angel in his room, sitting and adoring him for no reason other than he wants to, wants
Sam and Eileen pretend not to notice, letting the movie play.
Cas ignores the twinge of emotion. “Have you checked with whomever he has been staying with?”
They appear to be a repeated variation of “I am well. Do not worry.” And an odd assortment of emojis, it’s phrased so awkward and stilted that it’s followed up by several even
The Empty is as he remembers, an abyss where all things may pour and be reduced to less than a memory— nothing. It is a space beyond darkness, void and malevolent in it’s nothingness.
“I was ordered to retreat— but then I glimpsed you: a righteous soul in hell. Bowed and scarred yes, but not broken, never once broken.” Cas couldn’t help the awe seeping into his voice. “I cannot begin to describe my astonishment at the sight of you. I was an ancient being, I had seen ages come and go; great men rise and fall. But you— even though you had been so utterly devastated by the tortures of Alistair, you would not let go of who you had been—You were in the pit— turned from victim to torturer, it had unleashed the worst darkness in you, Yet you fiercely fought to remember, even if the guilt over who you had become was ripping you apart. I saw you, corruption covered you, but even hell itself could not diminish the way you shone.” He smiles faintly, breathing out reverently at the memory, eyes still craned upward. “So, I did not retreat; instead, I fought my way to your side.”
, That’s my husband’s celestial trueform you’re ogling.”
“You are not wrong.” Cas muses, unsure of the emotion he hears. “I drew my line in the sand when I rescued you from The Beautiful Room. But, on reflection, I believe my choice was made in hell.”
Dean’s head jerks shakily, he sighs, mildly relieved, but the sense of antipathy remains, vibrating low along their bond.
“I appreciate it though.”
Sam angles around the pillar to make eye contact with Eileen, who’d been sitting silently in one of the nearby cubbies witnessing whatever just happened with Dean.

“Is that why you…” Another brief glance at the hunter’s mouth, Cas blinks. “Did, what you did?”

"Hey uh...Cas?" He taps his fingers softly against the door, trying to be aware of how easy it is to frighten the angel. “Buddy, you doing okay in there?"
Dean scratches his neck, “I have

The muscle in Dean’s jaw ticks. “What else does Amara say?”
There isn’t anger in his face any more. It’s fear.
“Where else would I go Dean?” Cas snarks tiredly, noting that Sam and Eileen are suspiciously absent, ignoring the creeping tendrils of jealousy at the ease of their relationship.
“Looks like both of us kinda let ourselves go the past couple of months.” He takes his time, gradually brushing the hair out of Cas’ eyes.
“Yeah.” He replies softly, honestly, the snow is coming down around them.

“No it hasn’t.” Again in tandem.
Dean thinks, and he realizes he could say it out loud and there would be no shame in it,
Cas’ nostrils flare, “I thought you were sore.” He murmurs, licking his palm, a thread of concern in his voice, opposing the fact that his hand is already working it’s way into Dean’s pajamas, relieved that they are a loose pair.

Cas stands in front of the open fridge, naked, save for a ratty pair of boxers that hang off his hips.
“If it has been causing you discomfort, why didn’t you say something?”
Now, Dean’s hand remains tightly clasped in the Angel’s as they sit in the silence. Ever since this morning when they woke; the hunter had gone no less than five minutes without some form of physical contact. Cas could feel the underlying anxiety needling off the hunter’s soul all throughout the day and chose very carefully to wait until Dean decides himself, to bring it up.
Cas sighs uncomfortably, rolling his shoulders; tightening his grip on his blade.“Please open the portal Rowena.”

Unsurprisingly, even with no major evil event lurking on the horizon, they manage to stay obnoxiously busy.

He searches for the right words, hoping they will make sense, and not offend too terribly,

Garth teaches him how to look up YouTube DIY during one of their visits; the two of them end up renovating a whole bathroom that weekend.
Dean follows, on his face the barest hope. He’s talking too loud, trying to stop Jack, to see who he holds, until he sees a flash of dirty, dark, hair peaking out of the corroded khaki bundle. Sam watches Jack stop his brother at the door, head shaking, before telling Sam quietly to wake Eileen.
Dean hadn't said a word, sat the coffee mug down in front of his boyfriend (partner) and proceeded to drink his own in silence.
He can’t help it really, he never thought he’d see Cas again and he’s never been so good at impulse control. He takes the bowl from Cas; sets it gently on the counter, bringing Cas’ open palm to his lips gently, just once, holds it there.
He waits, a warm, light glows below the door.
“Oh uh…
Every time he thinks about throwing it out, every time he doesn't.
He hears keys jangling at the front door, and moments later Cas stands in the doorway, mouth downturned as he takes in the gun in Dean’s hand and his clearly panicked expression.

He growls, “
Silence slips in, comfortable and warm. Cas, releases his face, comes and sits on the edge of Dean’s bed. He’s wearing Dean’s clothes again, the t-shirt is tight across his chest.

His chest is heavy with fear and disappointment, He can do this, without abuse or anger. Cas deserves better than that. Dean said what he needed to say.

He contemplates it, loneliness is a real big thing; but bringing anyone to his house makes him feel like— well, he isn’t there yet.
“I think it would be a worthy legacy Dean Winchester.” He replies, filled with a sudden sense of pride over the man next to him, “Have you spoken with Sam about it?”
He gives Dean a few minutes, refills his own drink and sits, this time closer to his brother.

After that Jack shows up almost every night right around dinner time, eager to chatter about his day, asking about their lives, seeking advice about the best way to work with Amara, (Dean is less happy about this) but he sorta sees the point,
that he sounds like a stereotype. He’s screwing this up so much, maybe they should just stay repressed. Avoid their feelings. Like men.
It’’s earlier than usual. Dean casually tried to change up his schedule enough so that running into Cas inside the bunker wouldn’t feel like he was stalking the guy. It’s not like he
