“Actually, I did – but you couldn’t resist. You always have to make the wrong choices, John!” Mary said.
Sherlock.
And he didn’t even have the chance to try and talk to John because
He wanted so much to believe her, to trust her. He wanted to believe that she cared for Sherlock – or for him, but he couldn’t; he couldn’t trust her with Sherlock’s life – he couldn’t trust that she would not betray them again.
Herman Bennett had been just a name – it had been pictures of crime scenes, forensics reports on the five victims – it had been detailed reports on what that man had done to  three women and two men.
"What am I supposed to do?" Sherlock asked, feeling for a moment like the child he had been, the kid who  used to  think that his big brother had always all the answers and could do no wrong.
“Sherlock…” He said. He was about to say more, he was about to tell him that he was sorry, so, so sorry – even if Sherlock would believe the lie, it would cement it in his mind because he had let sentiment cloud his judgment, when his mobile phone vibrated.
“Promise me again,” Mary said.
destroyed everything.
“Did you talk to Mary?” Greg asked. He didn’t know what exactly had happened between John and his wife, he hadn’t asked and he only had suspicions about what had changed between them, but he had a feeling that things were considerably more complicated than Mary understanding what all of them knew: that Sherlock Holmes came first for John, before everything and everyone. Besides, Mary was not stupid
Whoever was pulling the strings was extremely careful, to the point of paranoia. They had only moved when Sherlock and him had been too busy, too distracted to really notice things that would have been otherwise obvious.
John looked surprised, there was also hurt in his eyes (why?) and Sherlock really didn't want to deal with that.
) and walked.
John shook his head, apparently his words had taken the fight out of him.
John had told him that he was in love with him while he was in the hospital, he had believed him, of course, because he would always believe in John, but it was starting to feel
John Watson would go to the clinic without noticing that he had people spying on him. One of them was Mary Morstan.
Sherlock –
He suspected Mary hadn’t even started with him.
“I know,” Sherlock said.
William closed his eyes for a moment and mumbled, “They will kill her, won’t they?”
John was trying to get on his knees, and he could not afford to call out his name, not now. John – his John, had been used as a pawn in that game, and it was his own fault – but that could not be his fight. He would not allow that to happen. Round and round he went – but the core never changed: he would always try and protect John, even from himself.
Nevertheless, he had to ask, even if he knew it was an exercise in futility. “You must also be aware that killing me will not change the past,” Sherlock said.
need him. Sherlock lives means John Watson lives, right?”
Sherlock was trying, but there were things that would
“Someone will interrogate you soon,” Sherlock said, “you should rest, now.”
It was the truth, for once. How ironic! It was one of the very few truths she had said to the two men in the room: she had been out and Alex too. They had had plans and dreams. They had left their pasts behind. Alex had saved her life – and she had not been there to save his. It was as simple as that.
“Ready?” He asked, instead.
His words were slurred. Perhaps, he shouldn’t have been so ready to plunge that knife, but then again Sherlock was always ready and willing to be self-sacrificing for the man he loved to the point that he had not paid attention to the knife. Too bad.
Silence.
She was at the door when she stopped and looking at him said, "What happened to the mirror in the bathroom?"
"John..." Sherlock whispered, but didn’t add anything else. He got up from his armchair, his movements still too slow, still those of a man who had healing wounds all over his body and John wanted to tell him to stop, to stay there, to continue what he had  meant to say, instead he looked at Sherlock and locking gazes with him felt good, and it also scared him because he knew that look, he had had it on his face right before he had killed Magnussen.
They were both lucky to be alive. He had been shot before, it had brought him to London, to a life he wasn’t sure he wanted to keep on living and to a park, where he had met an old friend who had introduced him to one Sherlock Holmes.
“I would have told you if he had.” She replied.
, but there was more than that – he didn’t look like he had for the past few weeks: as if guilt was crushing him. She had tried to tell him, more than once, that he was not responsible for what had happened to Sherlock, but to no avail – she had seen how the past weeks had weighed down on him.
“Of course, I don’t really believe in coincidences.” The woman continued, “Coffee is ready, shall we get back to work?”
"I'm aware of that," Sherlock replied, more coldly than he had meant.
“I hated it.” Sherlock repeated, “You won.”
The two men weren’t surprised in the least to see him when he finally entered the room. They exchanged a brief glance, but didn’t say a word. Sherlock sat, clasping his hands on the desk.
now; I need to be shielded and protected!”
Not a chance in hell. He thought. Joan had already paid her dues. She had scars on her body, her hands were fucked, she would not be interrogated by Mycroft Holmes. She would not be dragged into that mess. Not again.
“Well, fuck, no! Why do you think I married him in the first place?” Mary said, interrupting his thoughts.
It was the truth; he wouldn't have allowed Sherlock anywhere near a crime scene if he had thought he was. John touched the stains of blood with his fingertips and said, "He won't be alone. Not this time." John said and Greg doubted John was aware he had said those words aloud.
He supposed that he ought to thank Herman Bennett for that, for reminding him of the truth. It had been an appallingly careless strategic mistake from whoever was on top of that game.
, John,” Sherlock said. He had frowned for a moment before adding in a low voice, almost to himself, “Love
Three versus one. Plus two people outside (he had expected more), the mole and the driver.  He needed the name of Jim Moriarty’s emissary in the Midwest. The mole didn’t know or else Sherlock wouldn’t be in that room, he wouldn’t have been forced to do
"The car is here," Sherlock said. He turned and looked at him, "William wants to avenge what happened to Joan."
John closed his eyes, “Leave a note when?” He panted.
Sherlock could only nod. Only later did he realise that when they walked, hand in hand, to his bedroom, John had held his right one, and not once Charles Augustus Magnussen had entered his thoughts.
“Where is she?” Sherlock said, right when John did.
Sherlock Holmes owed him -- and William thought that he owed the man as well. Because that  was more than personal -- it was their lives. Joan (and John Watson, he was sure) were
There was only one way to find out.
," Sherlock said, and it was probably meant to reassure him, but it only made John's throat dry.
“There is a message in that envelope, isn’t there?” John asked.
Sherlock nodded, “Yes.” He said. He was doing exactly what Mycroft had anticipated he would do. There was something that Mycroft had not anticipated, though: Sherlock was in pain.
John was a bit surprised to hear that sound; the mobile had been turned off for days; Sherlock kept looking at him even as he answered the phone. He saw Sherlock raising an eyebrow at what he was being said to him and ending the phone call without uttering a word.
And he knew that it wouldn't change what John was thinking either. He would want to sit in front of Herman Bennett, he would listen to him. If not for Victor, he would do that for Molly – or even for Janine because John Watson was a good man.
Sherlock’s face was absolutely blank, he saw him placing the books he had been holding on the floor, he saw him dusting his hands on his trousers before he took the bag from his hands.
“Is everything okay?” John asked, but he was already pulling over to the side of the road.
“Do you think it’s connected to what happened to Joan?” He had asked, more because he was still trying to rationalise how his life had become such a nightmare for the past eight days than because he actually expected an answer from Mycroft Holmes.
“Three years ago I insisted with Sherlock that you were not to know about our plan. Jim Moriarty’s associates would have known if your grief hadn’t looked genuine. It was a cavalier way to ensure both the success of our plan and your protection.” Mycroft looked at him and said, “I won’t apologise, John, because it was necessary. I am not Sherlock.” He drew in a breath and said, “Nevertheless I admit that I had underestimated the attachment between my brother and you. I won’t make the same mistake twice.”
because Joan was alive, she would bear his own name on her skin (the symmetry was not lost on Sherlock...and he hated it. He hated that he had to carry Moriarty's name on his skin and that woman had to carry his. He was not like Moriarty!), Joan's fingers were a mess of broken bones, damaged muscles and tendons...but she was alive. She would heal...and William would be with her.
“I am not leaving you alone with her,” John said, “ever heard of divide and conquer? She is bluffing!”
“You said you would not shoot me,” Sherlock said.
Christ, he thought, scooting closer to the man in the bed.
Sherlock had pushed him away, he had hurt Sherlock – he had seen him die twice, he had almost lost him, but in the end, it could not have been any different. It was raining, and it was dark and Sherlock was kissing him – licking at the seam of his lips, desperately seeking entrance – and John was only too happy to oblige, he was Sherlock’s, he had always been.
It wasn’t pictures of Herman Bennett’s victims and it wasn’t pictures of Sherlock in the man’s basement, either. But he had been right about something: those pictures
He chose to ignore the answer.
“Where is he? Is he okay?” John asked. He was up in a moment, the images from his nightmare fading as he listened to Greg. He noticed William Moore outside the office, talking to one constable, he could see the man vibrating with nervous energy.
“What happened?” John asked.
“Sometimes a deception is so audacious, so outrageous that you can't see it even when it's staring you in the face.” Sherlock mumbled.
She had chosen her outfit carefully; that was the first thing Sherlock noticed about Mary when she entered the flat: she was still wearing that hideous red coat, but the jumper underneath and the trousers had been chosen with extreme care, the clothes were meant to highlight the fact that she was a pregnant lady, but at the same time that she was
Sherlock shook his head but looked at him when he said, “Apparently, I’ve been living with fractured memories all my life. Resting doesn’t sound like a good idea right now,”
The cases he had refused to solve because they were mind numbingly boring, the people he had not helped, the old woman Moriarty had used for one of their games and her neighbours were dead because of a game.
He met John’s eyes, there were still tendrils of fear (for Sherlock), but he saw the bravery of the soldier in the man’s stance. He had told him, during their first meeting, that bravery was a synonym for stupidity.
“I know,” Mycroft said he was still looking at the screen, he was watching Sherlock tear that cell apart, looking for clues. Herman Bennett had poisoned himself, even though he had been searched and another capsule had been already found on his body when he had been admitted to the facility.
Molly took his hand and Greg ...He would never, ever, say that they slow danced to the notes of one of Adele's songs.
He was in Serbia, running and running, knowing that they would get him, that he didn’t have any weapon on him, that John, in his mind, was urging him to keep running but the balance of probability told him that he would be caught. He would be hurt.
Victor shook his head, Sherlock wondered whether the man was feeling a slight sense of vertigo or, perhaps, the sense that reality had been somehow altered.
He could see John through the broken mirror: he was pale. John was scared for him. He oughtn't to be, though. He was fine. He would not inflict damage to his hand. He would not (go to pieces again) do anything stupid. John needed to know, though. He needed to know how much he was not a good man. He needed to understand. That was why he had told him about what he had told Moriarty that day.
it sounded and felt – as if he hadn’t spent the better part of the past five years yearning for the man sitting next to him in that car.
There was a sergeant from Scotland Yard, Sherlock didn’t even remember his name and was surprised that Lestrade wasn’t there, he hadn’t even been at Baker Street when he had left, nor had he been in touch.
– more than fine.
Granted, he did not run a country, he was not a genius, but that was just common sense, wasn’t it?
John hissed. John was in the water, with him. Why was John with him?
distracting.
how not to feel ripped in half without him, how to be truly alive without Sherlock.
"Good." He said, "because..."
The man in the video was clearly in pain, he had been in pain even
He had missed that; not risking his life, of course, he had not missed the lack of sleep or the jet lag, or even getting as close to torturing a human being to get information while still being within the law.
and his anger at that man for what he had done to his brother was a quiet, cold, merciless creature.
Read the tags.
John didn't say that he shared the sentiment. He didn't need to. The envelope ended up in the pocket of Sherlock's jacket. Sherlock followed his gaze, but didn't talk.
Sherlock’s left hand was on the envelope, he talked slowly, more to himself than to them, John realized, when he said, “I had assumed it was your people.”
Enjoy!!
Yes, I know it’s an open ended story, and I do have some ideas about a follow up for the story (I have had more than a year to think about it).
Family? Best friend? What were those words even supposed to mean? Sherlock was so much more than that to him; he had always been since that crazy first night spent chasing a cab through London.
“You need to see this. Is Anderson with you? Put him through!” Greg had said.
Bennett might have hurt his body (and it had been painful, it had been excruciatingly repugnant), but Magnussen, with his words, his touch had bolted open doors that were supposed to be sealed shut.
He had of course noticed the pigmentation in the Plexiglas wall on his right side, thinking it could be altered remotely.  It did not matter, however, because John was there. He had not measured time since they had been separated, it would have been – a lot of not good. But it felt like it had been ages since he had last seen him, since they had gone back to Baker Street.
John would tell him the truth – and it would be a jagged instrument, bloody and terrible because some truths were like that.
The night he had smashed his hand against the mirror he had lived the whole experience, until John had kissed him, with detachment: one minute his head had been filled to the brim with faces of people he had killed, people who had tried to kill him and had almost succeeded, with Magnussen’s lips against his skin and a moment later it had all gone away, leaving behind a tabula rasa, no feeling at all, not even physical pain.
“John.” Greg’s voice came from behind him.
“Answer my question.” John said, “truthfully.”
Mr. Neal wasn’t like that; oh, there were bodies melted in acid that were proof – so to speak - that hee was not someone you could fuck with, and that had been something she truly hadn’t missed about her past, it had brought back memories of some of the jobs she had actually hated, but she knew Mr. Neal would not react to her words. He needed her. They needed each other.
She had given birth – but clearly, she had been hit (John, most probably, at least judging by the bruises on the doctor’s face and the bullet on his upper forearm) and it had caused damages.
He rolled his eyes. “Must you be so obvious, Mary?”
She blinked her eyes, focusing on what Sherlock had said, letting his words finally sink: Alex had not told her about being approached by any government operative, he had told her it was a well-paid job, a favour he owed. If he had told her the truth – what? She would have told him that it was dangerous? That he should know better than trusting government agencies after all the shit they had been through? Or would she have told him that they had done a good job themselves at disappearing and they did not need any help?
So, Sherlock had killed Mary’s husband, apparently –  a Brian Cooper, a semi retired criminal  loosely associated with one of Moriarty’s men in Chicago. He had the feeling that there had to be more to the story, more to that man, whose criminal records were frankly risible, but he wasn’t exactly keen on finding out the details. Not at the moment. Or ever, if he had to be honest.
The drugs he had been given – that prickle at the back of his neck, in Bennett’s basement.
The tall man smiled. It was the smile of someone who was enjoying saying those words – because he knew he had the power to hurt him. He shrugged,  imitating his gestures of a few moments earlier and said, “Eventually, yes. But it doesn’t take a
“It’s...” John trailed, but he was already up, taking the remote from the other bedside table in the room.
“I – I think I get it, now. You know? I was so mad at him, even the last time, but I get it, now.” John said.
They, whoever they were, wanted to destroy him, bit by bit. They wanted him wounded, scarred, humiliated and weak.
Sherlock did.
She had also dropped her pretenses, she was living a long held fantasy or wish fulfillment. Gambling with John’s life was dangerous, but it could buy them time. Every second could make the difference, at that point.
“Here --” she said. John was still holding that stupid bag in his arms, and looked at the cup for a few seconds, until Mary hissed, “For God’s sake, John, I didn’t poison it! Drink that bloody coffee!”
The words were ciphered, but Herman Bennett knew what they meant right away. He tore the rectangle of paper in pieces and ate it, like he had been long ago instructed to do and part of him hoped that the paper was poisoned. It wasn't.
Sherlock arched an eyebrow, but Greg said, “I mean it, Sherlock: it is John’s daughter we are talking about – I am
Sherlock’s face, the only thing he had been able to focus on, while still drugged as the man pulled him out from that bonfire (and later, almost a year later, he would see, would hear how frantic Sherlock had been, how he had walked through the fire for him, without second thoughts – and that image would haunt him as he went back to Mary doing what Sherlock had asked him to do).
Sherlock had been right, as usual; Greg hated that Sherlock had had to come to that crime scene because in the end, ignoring his gut instinct (or was it
As he took a step toward Sherlock he felt like their lives would add another “before” (before Bennett, before they had kissed, before he had seen Sherlock’s scars) and “after” to the list, but it didn’t matter, he decided, as he shortened the distance between them. It took him exactly six steps to be in front of Sherlock, ignoring the other people in the room, because the only one who mattered was sitting on a chair, not uttering a sound, apparently oblivious for once of his surroundings.
Mycroft had failed when he had tried to make him quit drugs: rehab, intellectual reasoning had fallen on deaf ears, but the
It had to be now: he was exposed, wasn’t he? They could kill two birds with one stone: Mycroft was there as well (why?), they could get rid of the Holmes brothers who had defeated Jim Moriarty and had allowed someone else to take his place.
The two guards outside (who would be their shadows when they got out of the hospital), didn’t spare him a glance, and Greg absolutely did
She loved the structure of the plan, she didn't care about the
“I am sure Miss. Adler can continue on her own before being allowed to disappear again. She can be very persuasive when she wants to,” Mycroft said,  after a few seconds of silence, "come home Mr. Moore,  your expertise is needed here."
He could tell him, scream until he was hoarse, that it hadn’t been his fault. He had been a child, for God’s sake! He had spent all his life putting together pieces of complicated puzzles, solving mysteries, helping people, refusing to care about the victims because he had failed to solve a puzzle when he was a child.
They walked in silence and Greg wanted to take off his jacket and give it to Molly who was hugging her own arms and he couldn’t understand why on Earth he wasn’t doing so.
He was good at masking the relief he must be feeling at the thought of big brother to the rescue, but she had always been good at seeing when he fibbed. Sherlock Holmes was a good bullshitter, but she had worked with the best of them, she had been trained, in another life, when she had another name, to see right through the best liars out there.
She would have liked to have
Two new operatives were already outside Sherlock’s room, they had a list (which he was sure they had already memorized) of the people allowed into the room and, no doubts, they were aware of the fact that Mycroft Holmes was cross. “That will be all.” Mycroft said to the other operatives.
“Good news,” The man said, ignoring his words, “your boyfriend is coming!”
He breathed: in and out, forcing himself not to think, fixing his gaze on the fridge in front of him.
Catherine was on the second dvd: her birth, the moment where Mary had held her in her arms, and a loop of her either sleeping or crying. It was what they had seen on the screen in the cellar.
they were home, finally!)
man told you? You manipulating me again? Christ, Sherlock..." John said.
There was a moment of silence. Was Mycroft satisfied with his answer? The simple one would have been one word: everything. But that was not what Mycroft had truly wanted to hear.
Mary smiled, but some of the happiness she had showed was already fraying around the edges. She was not bluffing, she was absolutely sincere.
It had stung -- knowing that John had heard what Bennett had said, not because of the man's words, those had been poor attempts at taunting and playing games with him...because he might have had his penis in his mouth in that basement, but Herman Bennett was unimportant. He was an amateur at playing the game. He truly was a pawn in the great scheme of things and that was the only thing that mattered.
He handed Mycroft the envelope he was  keeping  in his pocket. He had not lied to John: it was personal and there was something he needed Mycroft to see in the sheets of paper inside the envelope. But there was something else as  well.
Mr. Neal had taught her that those people were useful as well, that they were assets: the plan, the strategy (an ember of it at first) had been Mr. Neal's idea, it had been an idea at first, she had just helped him to turn it into something real.
for him not to understand things right away, not to see everything at once even though his senses were sharp as if he had shot up cocaine. It was unusual for him not to understand motivators as glaringly obvious as that one with barely more than a look.
And there was something else: the mole was protecting someone (wife? Daughter?) by not setting off a chain of events that would cause his death anyway. He saw it all in the man’s eyes and face, he saw the resignation set in, he saw that he chose to surrender. He saw the loss and regret crossing his features.
Mycroft and Lestrade got in the cell; it was Lestrade who helped him up, he noticed splatters of blood on his shirt, visible underneath the Kevlar vest he was wearing, he leaned on him, and the man’s hand went immediately to his side, to put pressure on the wound. Right, he had been unable to.
Mary didn’t answer. She didn’t need to – it was clear in the way she had said Bennett’s first name, the casual familiarity of it, as if they had known each other for a long time. Sherlock had always addressed that man formally – so had their friends, but not Mary. Oh, no – for her that fucking bastard was Herman.
John took the cup from his hand,  it wasn't necessary, but Sherlock didn't comment on that.
“I –“ Sherlock hesitated, “I don’t want pain killers. But I wouldn’t oppose to something to sleep. I need to sleep. I –“
have been a coincidence.
God, he looked exhausted; poor Greg had been sucked into the events of the past week, and was running on fumes, just like them. He had been worried about Sherlock, and he didn’t even know what had happened in the hallway, he didn’t know that the reason Sherlock had disappeared was because of him, because of what he had done.
, Sherlock had solved the mystery – when did he not? – that the culprit had been apprehended and that the rest of the day had gone on swimmingly.
And if it weren't Mycroft, if there weren't decades of animosity between them he would perhaps be moved by how carefully he was choosing his words; outbursts of brotherly concern, though, were not part of their relationship and he could barely take John walking on eggshells around him, he only tolerated it  from John because he realised that it wasn't easy to be with him, because there were moments he was so angry that keeping a  calm facade became nearly impossible;  there were moments where he felt numb,
wanted. Sherlock had not been fine, that day. He had been...like he sometimes was ever since they had left the hospital: apparently calm and his old self, but the look in his eyes was too blank, too empty. When it happened in their flat, when there were moments where he feared that Sherlock would calmly keep his hand under slashing water until the skin blistered he had got quite good at bringing him back -- until that morning, at least. He had seen the signs, he had seen the look in his eyes and he had done
"That's different," John said.
“We will find her…” John said, “we have to…”
All the exits were covered, the men had been all disposed of one way or another; there hadn’t been many casualties among the operatives of that mission – which was good since far too many people had died or been hurt because of Mary Morstan and her cronies.
“Does it really matter whether you determine why you did not react that day?” He asked.
He blinked his eyes: the pieces were all there,  dancing  in front of him and he couldn’t put them together.
tell John -- dark moments, after he had come back, hours flown by without him noticing, while the water in the bathtub became too cold and the lights were switched off and his stash of cocaine had been so tantalizingly close and yet he had not moved.
Sherlock’s lips were soft, he tasted like rain and coffee and everything John held dear.
Facts.
John, pushing into Mary, touching her, kissing her, looking at her, his seed spilling into her, their objects mingling, their breaths as one, their lives united, forever, by the conception of a new life.
Detective Inspector Lestrade, who had briefly met Janine at John's wedding, closed his eyes upon reading the content of the message for Sherlock.
“I am aware of that,” Mary said, and he snapped his attention on her. He had to focus, to concentrate, John’s life depended on it.
And John thought that one day feeling like he had just skipped big chunks of dialogues between the two men, even if he had been right there with them, would not annoy him so much.
And Greg saw; he saw that John was about to tell Sherlock that it was not up to him to decide for him, he was about to remind him that someone they had known had been killed and that Janine was just the first of many, probably. John didn't say any of that, though.
The man didn’t reply for a moment when the shot came, loud and deafening in that room, even if broadcasted through a mobile phone, Molly let out a sound – a cry, perhaps, or a whimper, he wasn’t sure.
Sherlock stilled – and then
“Choose.” The man said and then the video feed ended.
No, that was not what Lestrade was worried about – and he didn’t care  about Lestrade’s worries.
interested in them.
– I had to improvise.” He shrugged and said, “Five.”
Just some jumped up romantic nonsense I spit out one day!
Sherlock's chest heaves and his lips burn.
It is only the thought that his repugnant brother, and the forces at his command, might be of some assistance to John that prevents him from hurling his phone at his wardrobe. He jabs a text to his unfortunate relation, resolving to delete the previous correspondence first from his mobile and then from his brain.
“God, Sherlock. Who the hell knows what this is.” He laughs this time, a small, broken sound. “Please say I can kiss you.”
“I'm sorry, John.”
Sherlock would cock his head and turn to John, next to him on the sofa.
“I've half a mind to kiss you,” he tells Sherlock seriously. “The other half is almost certainly concussed and can't be trusted.”
"It is difficult, you know.”
“You can drink it here.” Sherlock is suddenly shy, hopeful. Trembling. John can feel it. “I’ll buy some. I promise I will.”
Flush against his chest, John can feel when Sherlock’s breathing stops, and when his heart picks up. He takes gasping breaths of the air whipping past him as he descends.
Then John is shaking his head and leaning back against the hedge.
dangerous to you in the way that she-"
Closely followed (with heat in his belly and lips quirking) by:
He’d gotten as far as broaching the subject as delicately as he could manage, therefore nowhere near delicately enough, and explaining that he had proof, before the desolation on the doctor’s face brought him to a halt, and John stumbled from the flat. Sherlock heard the thud of a foot colliding with a wall before the slam of a door, and then silence. Mrs. Hudson would worry.
The night he departs the wedding, he returns to Baker Street, consumed with a nameless torment beneath his breastbone. He moves through the darkened flat, ignoring the lamps. Places his Strad, safe in its case, on its designated shelf. Lights a cigarette from a pack that John probably thought he'd hidden well the last time he came round. Stomps to the bathroom in disgust and flushes it after only two drags. He'd let John hide every cigarette in his possession for the rest of his life if it meant he'd be at Baker Street.
There's a twist in John's chest as he turns his head to find Sherlock close, very close, the strangest expression on his face and hands gripping John by the purple silk shirt he's wearing, and… what?
“But not with a woman on a bus. Not with just anyone.“
He is rewarded with a smile, small and doleful though it may be, and he thinks he could possibly grow used to sentiment, if he has John and John has him. John leans back in his chair, smile fading into the resolve and decisiveness Sherlock so respects in him.
Sherlock huffs a breath into his hair.
“Right, look, Sherlock, I love you,” he says now, as the music continues on around them. “And I can’t imagine why you’d ever doubt that you’re worthy of it, but I figured music might help you understand. Even if it’s, y'know, pop culture music.”
“You know me, John, I'd have given something away had I not escaped all those… people.”
Sherlock's muscles relax as John speaks.
John regrets laughing now, just a little. He runs a hand over Sherlock’s cheek, over the bow of his lips, relishing the flutter of eyelids in response to his touch, and the small burst of heat in his own chest. He doubts they’ll ever stop wanting each other.
Something had tightened in John’s chest, and then he was pressing into Sherlock’s lap, kissing him, running hands up into curls, mind racing in an attempt to find the right words to say.
He doesn’t respond at first. His foot hovers in the air. The drop from the edge is terrifying.
, in just about every way, his to protect and care for and hold.
Hold you tight to me
and say hello! :)
Sherlock yields to him, as some part of John had always expected. He’s softer now, less sharpness and haughty grace, more compassion and benevolence. John has never stroked his face, but he does so now; he imagines that before now, before their embrace weeks previous, Sherlock would never have felt as warm and soft and consuming as he does now.
Sherlock doesn’t seem to know what to say as they face each other. John waits, staring at lips wet from his own.
“I've just said I find my shirt to fit you quite well,” Sherlock says, pulse noticeably elevating, though if he's flustered by John's words, his face doesn't give it away. “And oh, would you like me to tell you that? I should have so many times. It's true.”
In the morning, there will be time. Time to run his fingers through obsidian curls, time to press languid kisses to the perfect bow of lips or collarbone or waist, time to forget what the world looks like outside of opalescent eyes. Time to whisper and to shout things he’s meant to for years. Time for Sherlock to do just the same.
“Sherlock, there’s nothing but you.” He is broken, and whole, both more completely than he has ever been before.
"But as I am apparently your best friend, I cannot congratulate you on your choice of companion."

“Sherlock,” John had started, but closed his mouth again. The most gorgeous and tempting person he’d ever known was asking him this. He’d kissed every inch of Sherlock’s body, heard that voice in all manner of gasps and cries and moans, felt those elegant fingers in places that set him running hot just remembering.
He didn’t say anything, but his eyes twinkled in amusement.
“And you?”
I shrugged. “That’s fine. I don’t mind being perceived as male.”
“Now, why don’t you start from the beginning?”
John laughed. “Agreed,” he whispered, pressing their foreheads together.
Watson looked up and met Sherlock’s eyes. <Somehow, I don’t believe Acton will appreciate the bond Fox asked for.>
<Your hair!>
I would see this finished one way or another.
He smiled gently. “Most would consider it polite to introduce themselves to their host, Hunter.”
I sneezed, the closest I could get to a laugh in wolf form. He seemed to understand and smiled in reply.
The alter, the chains adorning it, and the dagger were all that mattered.
I yawned in agreement, allowing the magic to wash over me. If the major elementals were involved, merfolk, dragons, griffons, phoenixes, as well as a Unicorn, I’d be just fine, so far as appearance goes. My clothes would say what they needed to say, and I’d have gold and jewels, courtesy of the dragons. The local elementals would know me, and the Unicorn’s magic would tell them why I was there, if they didn’t know already. All I would need to worry about was the threat the Unicorn spoke of.
Davy scowled. “He was talking a lot. I thought it was to himself, but...” he glanced at the gathered elementals, “I heard Fox in my head, before this.”
“Very well. You,” Watson announced, pointing at me, “lie back down. I’ll send up luncheon and Mycroft, the pair of you can discuss Shanbrook. You,” he continued, pointing at Holmes, “I believe we should take the gentleman’s suggestion and talk.”
“What-”
“Did it look like he vanished into the air, or was he pulled into the ground?”
“Sorry. Thought the mage gathering power was closer.”
Watson raised an eyebrow, but didn’t comment. Holmes always did hate social visits.
I circled the troll, darting in to free it, and dashing back. It bellowed in rage, sending a row of glass-edged rocks up under my paws and I yelped.
<Smart pup.> He flushed, pleased. <But it’s hiding. I know roughly where it is, south and west of the town, but I’d rather not spend time looking for it. Where could something be out there?>
“I am Father Simeon. The elementals told me of your coming, Hunter. I offer what aid I can, as well as sanctuary, if you should desire it.”
Sherlock Holmes was sprawled in his chair, absently dragging the bow across the strings of his Stradivari. His most recent case had come to a close rather faster than he had hoped, and there were no further ones on offer.
Holmes sat in his chair, fingers steepled under his chin as he considered everything I’d said.
“Ah, but here is brother Mycroft, likely with your books.”
Watson took the offered seat. Lord Acton said nothing for some time, allowing Watson to prepare and light his own pipe.
The faun seemed to understand, silently pointing me towards a large fallen tree. There was space enough underneath for me to rest comfortably, and a layer of dead leaves looked to be a comfortable bed.
Father Simeon gave me an inscrutable look as I finished buttoning the jacket. “The carriage just arrived.”
“Yep. Granted, which one they turn into depends on the person, but yeah.”
I ran on towards Shanbrook.
I studied Watson’s profile as my mind raced. No, I don’t think he knew.
I waved as the carriage passed me in the lane, not overly surprised when it pulled to a halt a short distance away. I took the implied invitation, climbing in across from Father Simeon.
“Good. Get your horses, and guns. Bring salt, too.”
He could feel the warmth of John’s breath the instant before their lips met. He forced himself to keep his eyes open, to engrave every instant of this moment across his heart.
“He’s going to try something. If the bowl is disturbed, I’ll loose the spell.”
I sighed, shaking my head. I would need allies to handle whatever the Unicorn sent me here for, and well, beggars couldn’t be choosers. My options were the priest or nothing.
She shrugged. I decided to not push, standing up and looking around.
“I’m assuming the missing elementals has something to do with this, as well.”
Holmes barked an order, setting the carriages rattling towards the hut. He turned to regard the image again.
“Yes, sometime today.”
I nodded, grim. “Yeah. There’s something that set out to capture and bind as many elementals as it could get that was attached to the net that got the kids.”
I narrowed my eyes at his tone. “You know something,” I began, but before I could find out more, the carriage rattled to a stop.
Watson looked a bit uncomfortable. “I’ve never had occasion to work with a wolfwalker before.”
Watson shook his head with a small smile. “You know, I almost forget that you have a family. It sometimes seems as though you sprung up, fully formed, in Trafalgar Square.”
Lucky me.
<Maybe. However, there is… something… in Europe right now. It’s very large, and evil, and something like that likely won’t be content with only a small chunk of land. Whatever it is, it’s a threat to everyone until it is taken out.>
“My brother and I…?”
Holmes half-turned, unsurprised to see Lord Acton had liberated himself from the wine cellar.
I dodged through a flock of sheep, sending them scattering as I continued, <Personally, I wouldn’t touch this mess with a ten foot pole if I had a choice. You two need to sort out your feelings first, before considering adding someone else to your hot mess. But needs must and all of that.>
Right. Davy.
“It’s a pleasure to meet you, Mary.”
Watson chuckled at that. “So, what does bring an American to this part of the country?”
Holmes bit back another laugh at Fox’s laconic reply.
<Gale, Bubbles, Sparky, Rocky,> I called, broadcasting my comments to any elemental in range, <I don’t care how you do it, but I need Watson to meet me. Now.>
Watson shook his head, looking lost. Mrs Hudson and Holmes shared a look, and Mrs. Hudson tsked.
Sherlock,
I headed down the hall, dropping the pack just inside the door of a small, neatly kept room. It should have felt cramped, but instead felt cozy. There was a massive bed dominating the room, and every available stretch of wall was taken up by bookcases, with a large wardrobe in one corner. A window overlooked the garden, and I was pleased to note that it was large enough I could use it as an exit, if I truly needed to.
<As long as I’m not imposing.> I yawned. <Right. I’m going back to bed before Watson yells at me some more. I’ll likely start changing the potentials here in a week or so.>
Watson was sitting on the edge of the bed in his shirtsleeves, staring vacantly at the teapot. Holmes sighed theatrically.
He reached out, but none of the sylphs came to his call. He climbed out of bed, unease growing as a salamander climbed atop the embers in the grate.
Huh. I thought back over the lunch and dinner. That couldn’t have been for me.
Dr. Watson was a mage.
<A simple transport spell,> a gust of wind that looked almost human chimed in, swaying and weaving in the air above the children.
I shrugged. “Little bit of business, little bit of pleasure.” I took a drink of a very nice beer offered with lunch. “I had… something of a falling out with my family. It seemed easier to be elsewhere for a time.”
She could keep the flat. It was paid for. He would see her looked after. It was the least of what he owed her. He was only passably aware of boarding another cab, and barely noticed when it came to a halt.
He was kneeling on the ground of the clearing, speaking softly to the faun. The faun seemed relaxed. That was good. Fauns were skittish, usually. A faun sticking around to talk to someone spoke well of their character.
I cleared a low stone wall and staggered as I landed. Something big had just swept through, heading for the town.
He nodded, tamping out his pipe. His belongings were waiting for him at the door, and the doorman had a cab waiting for him.
And I valued my freedom too much, if I was being honest.
I barked a laugh. At least they were honest.
Watson smiled weakly. “I do. But for now, I would like to sleep, and figure everything out in the morning.”
I went along with it, noting the sympathetic amusement on the faces of the adults we passed. Names and occupations were shouted at me as I was swept along, but none of them seemed to be ascribed to any particular adult. Mentally, I shrugged. I’d get more formal introductions from the adults later. For now, I’d just let the kids show me what they wanted to.
He could feel Holmes watching him, and finally turned to acknowledge it.
Burke grinned. “A bit nicer than I was going to say, but yes.”
Watson bowed slightly.
“I do.” He sighed. “And you will stand with me against the Council.”
“And now that the threat has been dealt with?” Holmes asked softly.
Watson was somewhat surprised to see nearly the whole of Hewe-Upon-Arun waiting in the courtyard as the carriages rattled up. Holmes stood beside him, face impassive, as the carriages came to a halt. There was nearly instant chaos as the children flung themselves out of the carriages and into the waiting arms of their families.
Who had hunted my kind to extinction.
He dashed off, the rest of the kids following. I watched them go for a bit, shaking my head.
Mycroft considered that pronouncement. It sounded preposterous, but Watson was more level-headed than that, and Lord Acton’s response seemed to fit that as well. He nodded, placing a firm hand on Acton’s shoulder.
<There is something hidden. We can not see it.>
Holmes sighed, scowling at the letters.
Holmes raised an eyebrow at the fact it was addressed to himself.
This one looked like someone had tried to burn it, and I felt my heart drop. Oh, God. If someone tried to read that as a cohesive whole….
<Are you fucking kidding me right now?>
“If you come back tomorrow, I’m sure we can fit you in again.”
I flicked an ear at him before sighing and shifting. He didn’t react to seeing me nude before him, and I got the impression the brownie gossiped more than I was used to. I’d spent too long alone.
Mycroft nodded slowly, considering.
So, this priest was willing to speak kindly to a faun, and wasn’t afraid of a massive wolf.
Although, the faun said there were no wolves in over a century. Huh.
<In the interest of full disclosure, I personally could not swear an oath to place British interests above my duty. My duty is to protect humanity, all of humanity. I can not, will not, be stopped by an arbitrary border. I will eventually be forming packs in every country. If I have the support of the Crown, I will start with British packs, and those countries deemed allies, and I will provide warning before I awaken packs in ‘enemy’ countries, but those will be happening regardless.>
“Yeah. Anyway, I was approached by a unicorn a couple of days ago. I was told that there was a world in danger, and I was needed to help save it. I agreed, and was sent here.”
I took a moment to mourn the sylph, but had to move on.
I sat up, still mostly asleep as I considered what I’d been told. Finally, I climbed out of the bed, a rather decadent feather bed, and prepared for the day.
He headed toward the garden, stopping by Watson.
It was a stranger, with brutally cropped hair and a suit of good fabric. They were sat in a corner, with what looked like every child in the village attending them.
Watson shot Holmes a look at that, but said nothing.
Holmes rubbed his knuckles as Paget dragged Acton out of the room. “The wine cellar is empty,” he said mildly.
“Mr. Sherlock. This is Mr. Fox. He just got here yesterday.”
The window to my room was open, and I jumped through it, shifting as I hit the ground. The brownie was waiting, foot tapping in annoyance.
Holmes nodded. “Very well. What happened to the children?”
There was a pack of kids waiting at the gate as I left the church. They straightened up as I approached, and I slowed, studying them as they studied me.
Watson nodded. “So, the poison, minor cuts, at least one that will require stitches, and what else?”
Watson seemed to consider that. “It would also allow me to tell Acton that I have some manner of leash on you, as well.”
Watson swore. “All right. Go home, Holmes and I will handle it.”
“Good. Poor man was completely blindsided. I found this in his luggage, as well,” she added, handing over a sealed envelope.
“So long,” Holmes murmured.
I laughed. “I bet. The faun I ran into said they’d all been wiped out.”
But how could I say no? Here and now, I had nothing. I had maybe enough cash to survive a week with humans. I had two sets of clothes, both of which were getting a little threadbare despite the effort of the brownies that always found me. I had a couple of well-thumbed books. I had no pack, no family. No one would come looking for me, save the pack council, and they wanted my head.
Society’s insistence on pants was a hassle, though.
<Yeah, kid?>
<Things are not always what they seem. Lies have been told so often they seem as true as fact. There is a darkness in Hewe-Upon-Arun, and allies, if you can see past the lies. Trust your instincts, and trust in Holmes. More than you know hangs in the balance.> So saying, the sylph released him, dancing through the open window after its fellows.
<Oh, so he thinks that I’m a woman? Asshole, but I can run with it.>
Carefully, he set his bag down and began cleaning the mess. Everything would need to be perfect, and then he would truly earn the power he was owed.
“What’s off that way?” I asked Davy, gesturing towards the trees.
<You think he can help me.>
They came readily enough, dancing around his head and shoulders. He smiled at them, touched.
I cleared out a small spot on one end of my hollow and lay a small fire. Once it lit, I pulled out the first volume of Holmes stories. I started reading the earlier ones, mostly because they were simple, familiar, and comforting. A salamander joined me, keeping the flames in check. I waved an absentminded greeting, but it didn’t seem to mind. The faun joined me, curling up next to me.
Father Simeon watched silently as Fox bowed and began walking toward the village. “I can see several different forms developing, although which one remains at the end of this is still a mystery.”
I could feel him watching me, and smell his amusement. I ignored it for as long as I could, but I finally snapped.
Although, considering the fight, I think I was in great shape.
That was odd. I know we aren’t exactly common, but usually one could find signs of a pack within a few miles. It was hard to scowl as a wolf, but I did my best, flattening my ears as I settled down to meditate. Stilling my mind let me spread my senses out further, covering hundreds of miles.
<Wolfwalker. Hunter. Lost child of the Pack. You are powerful, with the potential to be more.> The Unicorn angled its head, studying me with one endless blue eye. <We could use you, in a way your pack could not.>
That would explain why the Unicorn came. Wolves provide balance. If the mages had truly slain all of my kind, then there was nothing keeping the less ethical in check. And those less ethical mages were the ones the really nasty stories were about.
He bowed, chivying Holmes out ahead of him.
He breathed a laugh as he approached the stairs.
“It’s up to Fox, now.”
“But that would be my strength, not yours. I’ll start looking.” I studied my plate, then sighed. “How much will my appearance offend the town, anyway? I mean, I’ll wear the dresses if I need to, but I’d prefer the greater range of motion that trousers would give me.”
“I will set the wards tonight, but I will key them so you may pass unmolested, should you wish to begin hour search tonight.”
The elementals who fought their bonds were nothing. An extra layer of defense, nothing more. His spells lay ready. The first would rise with the sun, the second, the moon. Everything was balanced.
I tucked myself under the log, shifting back long enough to search the pack. There was a blanket on the top, which I pulled out gratefully. It had been wrapped around my books, and I was pleased to see that they had been rebound, leather replacing the fairly cheap paper. I stroked the spines with a smile, tucking the books back into the pack.
“It’s a nice night, I think I’ll walk back,” I told Watson. He nodded in reply as I half-turned to bow towards Holmes and began walking toward the village and the rectory.
I planned to grab some food and return to the south, see if I could narrow it down any further, when Father Simeon stopped me.
“I see,” he said, dryly. “Bring Dr. Watson some tea, I’ll have the letters ready to go out by the time you finish.”
“I have felt the beginnings of one such, in the countryside near the village. I can’t quite sense where it is coming from, but….”
<You’re far too skinny, Hunter.>
I forced myself to relax.
Watson and I shared a look as Davy practically vibrated out of his chair. He looked drawn, this close, and I could smell some lingering hurt, but he flashed a grin, evidently amused by the puppies for now.
Mrs. Hudson nodded and returned to the kitchen.
Wait. I’m Fox. Who…?
“Interesting. What do you know of this… Mr. Hunter?”
Holmes debated stepping in, trying to claim his own chance with Fox, but no. Watson was his dearest friend, he couldn’t, wouldn’t, try to impede his happiness.
Mycroft
“Well,” he breathed, panting. “I think I should listen to Fox’s advice more often.”
He grinned, unrepentant. “Tomorrow is a full moon, Hunter.”
“The children are fine. Only some minor bruises.”
I laughed. I couldn’t help it. Sherlock Holmes, the most famous fictional character in the world, was real, and staring at me across a crowded pub. And this puppy thought he was interested in me. It was probably just the hair, honestly.
“Which the Council will see as a threat.”
The rain stopped a few hours later. It was cold, and I had managed to acquire several more fauns during the day.
He followed Holmes, taking in the decor of the Hall as they walked. Here, too, was the expected unexpected. A wide variety of weapons and artwork lined the walls, looking out of place in a modern dwelling, and yet they seemed to belong, more the property of the Hall than anything else could be.
“He can’t possibly go on. He’s half-dead already,” Holmes exclaimed, transfixed by the scrying bowl.
The brownie sniffed in annoyance, but I could tell it was just for form.
Thanks for reading, and Comments are Love!
He gathered the tray, intending to leave it in the parlor for Mrs. Hudson. Later, he lay back against his headboard with his pipe, considering the problem of Watson.
He felt his heart twist in sympathy before brutally quelling the thought.
<We can restrain the troll for her,> it said, <But we can do nothing for the poison she ingested yet.>
There was a corset. And a weird, lobster-tail-shaped half cage thing. And several more skirts, along with a shirt, a small jacket, some uncomfortable-looking shoes, and a hat.
“I see.”
Both men raised an eyebrow at that. I grinned in reply, offering my hand.
There was a hand gripping the fur of my neck. It felt nice.
I sighed, slowing as I approached a nasty snarl of magics. <Right now, nothing. I would like your permission to drain off your energy, should I need it, but that will be later.> I walked along the leading edge, then something struck me. <Actually, yes. Get a cart or something set up. Don’t head out here yet, I don’t want to give him any more warning than needed, but getting a lift back for the kids would be good.>
Holmes grinned, there and gone, as he focused on Fox once more.
Holmes watched him through half-lidded eyes.
I sighed, leaving it for now. Tomorrow, I’d head south, see what was what.
She studied me in silence, still sucking her thumb. Finally, she spoke. “I think you’re a boy.”
“Mary asked for a separation, then?”
Soon, now. There was much to be done, and little time to do it in. He could not afford to make a mistake now.
I turned my head. There was a kid. A puppy. Do I know any puppies?
He pushed the issue aside as the cab approached his flat. Mary would be waiting, and he could wrangle Holmes in the morning.
I stopped, confused. Watson gestured to the table behind me and I turned. There lay my copies of the complete Sherlock Holmes books. I grinned.
“John.” She took a shuddering breath. Something about her tone made him hesitate. “I can’t keep doing this, John.”
“Oh? And what do you have to say for yourself?”
I looked over at the salamander, surprised. “Huh.”
“Oh, Baker Street, certainly,” Holmes replied, an amused glint in his eye. “But come. My family has land on the Downs, near a small village. Hewe-Upon-Arun. It’s quite quaint, and I’m sure you would enjoy it.”
“Wait!” I turned to look at him, head cocked. “Could you turn me into a wolf like you?”
A sylph blew on my earlobe before I could really start panicking.
“Hardly,” Holmes lit his pipe as he considered Watson. “Mycroft did have something. Personal, rather than business.”
“Peace, hunter. I mean you no harm.”
“Well, he’s welcome to stay here as long as he needs to. I’ll have some notes to send off shortly.” He paused in his writing to glance up the stairs. “I’m taking the liberty of asking Drs. Anstruther and Jackson to see to Watson’s practice for the next few weeks, at least.”
The salamander nodded, and Holmes leveled his steely gaze at Watson.
Holmes nodded, half turning as the carriage got close enough humans could hear it.
The door creaked open, and I dropped an arm across my face. “Hey. So how’re the kids?”
<So, the Solar Council likely wants me dead. I was trying to come with a way of  avoiding that.>
Well, it looked like I was right. He was just visiting Holmes’s mom alongside Sherlock. No biggie. I just needed to keep my head down and-
I stepped off the couch, then turned as Mycroft raised a hand.
Being alone, surrounded by people who didn’t, couldn’t, know the truth was tiring. I was starting to see why loners went mad.
Watson breathed a laugh. “True. Until I do this.”
Holmes sighed, looking pained. “There is a Wolfwalker, one who can transform into a wolf, who is heading off to where he believes this rogue mage is. We were intended to join him, however we were needed to stall for time.”
Damn pack politics. If it wasn’t for the traditionalist, hidebound assholes calling the shots, I would be happily set up with a cushy job, a house, and a very healthy bank account. Instead I was left to work cash under the table jobs and keep moving across the US. Everything I owned was in the beat up backpack I was carrying around. Ah, well. It could be worse. Normal humans weren’t as durable as wolfwalkers, and I at least could sleep rough and hunt for my dinner.
“Really? When?” I asked, kneeling down to her level.
“Mr. Sherlock! Mr. Sherlock!”
Thanks for reading, and as always, Comments are Love!
I raised my nose, sneezing as the scent of troll reached me.
Watson’s attention abruptly broke off, and Holmes rose.
I sighed. “Longer story than we have time for, but the short answer is most everyone in Hewe-Upon-Arun is like me. The mage is probably trying to find a viable way of getting lycanthropy, or immortality, or some shit. We can figure that part out after the kids are safe.”
I headed out of the door, walking around to the crates. I sat, considering Davy’s hiding spot, then sighed again. I took a step forward, gently biting the back of his jacket and pulling him free.
“I will.” Holmes rose. “Mr. Hunter. I’ll send a carriage to the rectory for you and Father Simeon at seven.”
“Oh, yeah, that would be easy.” I studied him. “You know, you’re taking this whole magic thing much better than I expected.”
“Hunter,” he said, inclining his head. “I have a simple supper laid out, and I have a room available for as long as you would wish it. Come in, and be well. We will discuss your task over dinner, and in the morning, you can begin your hunt.”
<Rules on my end, too, but at this point, I think its better to break them. Nice to see you agree with that. Get the window, would you?>
Oh, boy. This’d be fun. Like a root canal.
I followed the gesture, then nodded. I’d need to be among humans long enough to figure out what was happening. And where I was. I eyed the pack as the rain slowed to a minor drizzle. In truth, I was still a little out of it from the transition. I grabbed the pack in my teeth, intending to find a slightly drier place to spend the night.
He braced himself, considering. “What do you need?”
The pair strolled through the town, each considering their luncheon with Fox. Watson idly looked around for a telegraph post. True, he could send an elemental with the message, but a telegram would be much simpler.
I grinned as I grabbed for the underthings on the bed. “At least we don’t have to worry about my hair.”
So, I was walking through the middle of a strange pack’s territory, with their pups.
Dr. John H. Watson closed the door to his office with a sigh, locking it before turning down the street. His practice was enjoyable, and his life generally looking much better now than when he had first returned to London. He had a wife, friends, and a comfortable income from selling his versions of Holmes’s adventures.
“No. I think being back in Baker Street would help me a great deal. Although I do look forward to seeing your familial estate.”
He could feel the blood drain from his face. He dropped his stick and bag in the hall, tossing his hat behind him as he rushed into the parlor.
<Perfectly ordinary humans. Well, not ordinary, but no, you’re not mages or wolves.>
Still, no signs of any wolves.
“Apologies. I’m Fox. Fox Hunter.”
I swayed, staring at him as the world around me swam in and out of focus.
Well, if I could take out that minor evil south of here, maybe I could use that as a springboard to get on the mages’ good side. Assuming they had one.
Disquieted, I changed tack. With the storm, undines and sylphs should be having a ball. I sent out a thread of presence, seeking any local elementals that might want to talk. It was answered, not by a sylph or undine, but by a faun.
“Don’t push it, Doctor,” I snapped, but sent  flash of humor to soothe the sting.
“You-” Acton took a step forward, glaring at Holmes, then seemed to think better of whatever he was going to say. He turned on his heel, snapping his finger at his men. He stopped by the door to his carriage.
“What’s wrong?” he asked, glancing between her and the hall.
“Alright. So, I’m a wolfwalker, specifically a skinchanger. Exactly what it says on the tin, I can turn into a wolf. Skin changes, whatever’s on is doesn’t, so no clothes. Anyway, there are two other kinds: soulshifters and Potentials. Soulshifters… physically, they can’t change. They’re born human, they die human, and they spend every day in between human. But, they can project their…” I waved a hand as I tried to think of the best way of describing it., “their soul, their spirit, their power, and manifest that elsewhere. Usually as a ghosty-looking wolf. Dealing with that idiot earlier, if there had been soulshifters present, they could have unmade all of the bindings, and drained off the magic so he couldn’t whammy me during the fight. Things like that.”
Honestly, the kid couldn’t be older than twelve. I fought back a smile as even the older kids seemed to take Davy’s lead.
“They will do no such thing,” Holmes cut in, standing between them and the entrance. He felt Paget step up beside him, and Davy clambered to the stair ahead of him.
I snorted. “Or you’ll realize that your people have been feeding you lies and you’ll wind up helping me. This might come as a shock, Doctor, but we aren’t actually on opposite sides. I don’t know what’s building power out here, but I will stop it. You’re welcome to help me or not, but please know, I will not hesitate to go through you to stop it, if it will protect the people here.”
He considered the sylph’s words as he packed the last few of his belongings in his suitcase.
Holmes barked a laugh at that, enjoying how Watson’s face flushed.
“Some, certainly, though I hope to speak to Father Simeon tonight to see the details of his plan.” He studied me, then flashed a grin. “You should join us for dinner. There’s more than enough room.”
Holmes watched him in silence, nursing his own tea.
I snorted. <I’m a wolfwalker. I’ve always been able to do this. Now, you know there’s something evil around here. I need to find it.>
<Of course.> The faun gave a slight bow and vanished.
The men nodded, grabbing the sheet and carrying Fox by the makeshift liter. Watson followed, barely sparing a glance to Holmes.
Nothing.
“When did you know?”
<I guess that’s a no.>
The carriage rattled to a stop in front of the old pile, and a familiar footman helped him alight. Mycroft nodded to him, attention arrested by Sherlock and Watson arguing with the men from the second carriage. He was surprised to recognize the leader as Lord Acton.
He sighed. Sylphs were wonderful at gathering information, but had a tendency to speak in riddles. Oh, he could press them, force them to give him a straight answer, but if he did so, they would abandon him.
He smiled and inclined his head, but didn’t rise. Points for bravery, at least. I sat taller than him.
I remembered why that wasn’t a suggested attack as the toxins that acted as its blood and bile flooded my mouth.
No. There it was. Watson. And Watson had felt the same every time Holmes flirted with me.
Sherlock and Dr. Watson approached the table, Davy shooing some of the other kids out of the way to free up two seats. The kids grumbled, but moved around easily enough.
“Nothing interesting, then?”
The room was silent as they watched Fox free the remaining elementals. Mycroft had paled when the sylph asked for release, but he said nothing, simply standing as silent witness. Holmes didn’t move, eyes fixed on the image of the black wolf. He had seen the hesitation before she had killed the sylph.
Watson considered the half-packed state of his luggage, then sighed, sinking onto the bed.
That seemed to encourage the others. They swarmed around me, shouting their names as they each tried to get my attention first.
Holmes laughed at that. “Well, I can sympathize. However, you are intruding.”
He shrugged and spent time unpacking his bag and his thoughts.
Holmes shoved the thought aside, settling down to his own breakfast. He kept an eye on Watson as he began to complain about the lack of cases lately. He cocked a brow as Watson felt something in his breast pocket, but as Watson didn’t mention it, Holmes declined to comment.
Watson studied the Hall with a raised brow. Somehow, it was nothing like he expected, and exactly what he expected. It was a modest hall, all things considered, short and sprawling. Vines grew wild along the facade, providing an interesting contrast to the manicured drive.
A cold shiver that had nothing to do with the rain ran down my spine.
I slowed as I approached the faun’s clearing. There was a man nearby. Not usually a problem, but I would prefer to not be shot at. Except I couldn’t smell any gunpowder. Huh.
I nodded. <There are potentials, people with the wolf blood who don’t know what they are. I can awaken that potential, make them into true wolfwalkers, train them in what they need to know. I can not take on the darkness in Europe alone, I will need to awaken more wolves to handle it.>
“I’ll do it.”
She flapped the letters at him. “He was always a better tenant then you were.”
I looked up as the door opened, not really paying attention. Two men were standing by the door, studying the room. Both were well-dressed, and drop-dead gorgeous. The man in the lead was tall and lean, easily six and a half feet tall, with a strong jaw and aquiline nose, and cheekbones for days. His companion was a bit shorter, probably just under six feet, with a very impressive mustache adorning a round face. I could feel some ignored part of my psyche sitting to attention, whispering “Mine”. Honestly, I don’t know which it was talking about. I’d be happy to stare at either.
I sat up, setting the book aside. The question was new, and set my hackles up.
The cages could be stronger, but the children would sleep until he was ready for them. It would be fine.
<So, I have a proposal for the Crown, to be expedited with your help. I am the only wolfwalker in the world right now.>
Davy snorted.  “Everyone’ll be at the Laughing Deer. You can eat there. Come on!”
“I know. I just don’t know what that idiot’s doing.” I sighed, dropping my head back against the seat. “I’ll go for a run tonight, see what I can see.”
Holmes nodded slightly. “If it comes to that, I’ll help.”
Watson scowled. “I don’t know yet.”
I stared at the pile of fabric, then shoved it all back into the pack.
Watson stepped into the room and sat heavily on the closest chair. “I’m so-”
He sighed as his head rose. <Sherlock?>
(See the end of the chapter for
“I suppose that would be something of a drawback to letting him keep that.”
There’s a new priest in Hewe-Upon-Arun, who was asking about Shanbrook. Wants to use it for orphans or somesuch. I have work, and from what I’ve seen, you have nothing going right now, so why not take Watson, nip down to Shanbrook, and see what’s to be done?
“Your things are already packed.”
I scrubbed a hand over my face. “Christ on a cracker.”
“The Drebber case. When you managed to lay hands on Hope.”
“My father sold me to one of his cronies, the moment he knew how strong I was going to be. Not- not like an arranged marriage thing. It-” I took a breath, staring at the goose. “On the day of my sixteenth birthday, I was to be drugged and taken to my father’s friend’s home. There was a room prepared. It had no windows, and no latch on the inside. There was a chain and a manacle set into one wall. The only other things in it were a bed and a bucket to relieve myself.”
I swallowed heavily. I knew, in the same way I knew magic, that there were alternate universes. Hell, most fiction novels came from people who could see into those alternate realities. But moving from one reality to another? That was practically unheard of. And if this many elementals were approaching a single, packless wolfwalker with the opportunity? Whatever was happening in that reality would threaten all of them, eventually.
“Of course.”
“In my way, yes. I never wanted to see her hurt.”
The sylphs danced in silence for a few moments.
“What did you find today, Hunter?”
Watson had long given up on trying to track every way Holmes could read him, simply nodding and following his directions to the post office.
“This is not over.”
“Was I really that bad?”
I couldn’t be sure, but it looked like a period in history where women didn’t have rights, and depended on the menfolk to accomplish everything.
“Watson? Mrs. Hudson wanted me to look in on you.”
I wrapped the blanket around me, getting comfortable as I began my search. Faint flashes of magic in the town, nothing major and nothing I could get my teeth into. A soulshifter would be able to tell more.
Holmes took the sack as Davy raised both hands to his mouth, whistling sharply. The chatter in the yard stopped as everyone turned to face the pair. Holmes suppressed a smile as he addressed the crowd.
“How-?”
<You can hear this?>
Holmes noted a flash of sympathy in Fox’s gaze as Watson made his way out of the pub.
“Wrong?” Davy asked.
His heart twisted at the thought. Yes, he’d wanted Watson, still did, but now was hardly the time to focus on his own wants.
I turned to head back to the village, ignoring the prickle of unease. I should be hunting this thing. I knew where it was, and I should be dealing with it now.
“You can’t stop me,” Acton snarled.
I glanced between the two men, then sighed. “Okay, new plan. Watson, you distract them, and start scrying as soon as you can. You know how to feed magic between lovers’ bonds?”
He could feel the power of the wolfwalker in the air, coiling around him like smoke and froze.
<Well, I never. What did you do to yourself, Hunter?>
If the Council ever finds out I told him….
“This does appear to be interesting, at the least.”
One of the sylphs looped its way around his wrist. <Your heart never fully belonged to her.>
He was kneeling beside me, tugging on my ruff as tears streamed down his face.
The salamander laughed. <Yes, Hunter. This is your test, to see if the Unicorn chose wisely.>
There was a gasp behind me, and I whipped around. There was a small opening that served as a window, and I climbed up to it. There was a stack of crates piled up outside the shack, and I could see a small form trying to cower between two of them.
Holmes waited for Watson to join him in the garden, saying nothing as he led the way along one of the less-tended paths.
I trotted off, slipping into a lope that would eat up the miles. True, the kid was a Potential, but I wasn’t going to think about Awakening anyone until I had the measure of the mages here. And I certainly wasn’t going to turn a prepubescent kid. Teenagers were bad enough when they couldn’t turn into wolves.
“Wha?”
Mycroft was just entering the hall, and bowed slightly when he saw me.
“Alright.” I took a breath, gathering my thoughts. “There are other worlds. The technical term is parallel universes, but that’s not really important. I’m from a different world. It was 2010, and the pair of you were- well, that’s not really important.”
Claire finally finished counting my pay and handed it over with a grin as fake as her eyebrows.
I trotted around the field, freeing the salamander, gnome, and undine. None asked for that final release, and privately, I was glad. I was a hunter, yes, and my nature was that of a predator. But elementals were friends. Most times, the only ones I had.
Holmes laughed. “Father Simeon has a proposal to turn my family’s home to an orphanage. I came to see if the plan had any merit.”
I shrugged it off. “But what brings you gentlemen out here?”
They sat in silence for some time, and finally Watson sighed. “My thanks for the tea, and for the room, Holmes.”
I bit that back, staring at a taxidermied goose as I tried to collect myself.
“Fox!”
I considered that. Somehow “genderfuck” didn’t seem to be the right answer.
He nodded. “We’ll come, and offer what help we can.”
It was raining. I sneezed myself awake, then shook the water from my fur. It didn’t do any good, of course, since there were still sheets of rain falling, but it finished waking me up.
<Keep them busy.>
“Mary-”
“Don’t worry about me, Claire. I’m moving on tonight.”
“That wolf. They’re bred, they can’t transform anyone.” Acton strode down the stairs, looking around for his mages. “Lord Bexley, Burke, Tabiner. Go in there and finish it off.”
“And what form to you see here, Father?”
He frowned, thinking. “There’s an old shepherd’s cottage out there, and some old caves.”
He kept up a pointless string of complaints as Mrs. Hudson brought in the mail. He tossed the papers to Watson, scanning the letters with interest. Most disappointed, but a letter from Mycroft caught his attention.
No, Mary had never held all of his heart. If he was honest with himself, she never held it at all. It was Holmes’s, fully and completely.
I could tell he wanted to know about the banishment, but he was polite enough not to ask.
He felt a brief surge of jealousy, and shoved it down.
“Very well, Doctor. What do you need?”
“Dominick Hislop, younger son of Lord Hornsey. He only had a simple talent for magic, so he was never taught.”
Holy long chapters, Batman! I'm not apologizing for them, either.
“I see. Did anyone catch our villain’s name?”
John sighed. “There are rules, that every mage must abide by. By rights, I should have said nothing to you, and by so doing, I branded myself a traitor to the Solar Council.”
I sighed and stepped into the clearing, sitting a respectful distance from the priest.
<Yes. There are several unicorns who visit him. He knows more than he can tell.>
We had left the village behind, climbing a small hill. The view was breathtaking. There was a small forest to one side, and I could see the lines of roads through it. To the other side was the village of Hewe-Upon-Arun, with the curve of a river beyond it. I suppose that was the Arun. In between stretched fields, spread out to the horizon. There were dots in some fields, sheep, cows, and horses, according to my nose. Other fields were thick with crops. I closed my eyes, enjoying the breeze and sunlight as I let my senses stretch out.
“Oh? I didn’t think Mycroft would drag you into his personal affairs.”
<The packs will never stand the loss of one who can bear pups, especially one with your strength. They will hunt you until you can no longer run. What will you do then?>
I gave him a look. <What do you think?>
I was right. The troll was struggling against the bonds, and apparently had been for some time. The downside of elementals is that they don’t tire out. Not like mortal creatures.
I felt both of them pull away then, probably to deal with the mages that arrived, and sighed. The rest of this run would be lonely.
He studied her closer. She carried herself like a man, and from what he saw, the children were treating her as a man.
Holmes was studying the man, clearly expecting dishonesty. Watson stepped forward.
He turned to Holmes and offered a hand. “Fredrick Burke. With your permission, I’d like to set a ward here, and send a warning to those who think Acton’s…”
Holmes leveled Davy with a look, and he ducked his head. “I know. I’m sorry. I told him where the cottage was, and he said he could turn me into a wolf when I was twenty five.”
I threw the pillow off and sat up. It hurt, but I needed to move. I managed to stand up, clinging to the bedpost. Watson and Holmes shared a look, but didn’t argue, Watson merely handing me a dressing gown as I limped my way around the room. I shrugged it on, tying it loosely as I wandered, leaning on the furniture.
The kids.
But every other person in the village was a Potential.
“Fox?” he whispered.
Fox lay on one side, breathing lightly. He was lying, half-wrapped in an old sheet. Watson winced at the sheer amount of blood seeping through the sheet into the carriage itself. He sent a brief tendril of a question down the bond, then sighed.
Holmes turned away from where Watson had vanished with Fox, raising a brow in question at Davy. The boy held up a sack triumphantly.
Mrs. Hudson turned on her heel and marched off, leaving Holmes alone.
He finished addressing the final envelope as Mrs. Hudson returned with the tea tray. Holmes made an absent note that she had laid the tray with all of Watson’s favorites. When she returned from puttering over Watson again, Holmes held out the small stack of letters.
“All the deers and foxes left,” Mary said, peering up at me from behind Davy’s leg.
The sound of an approaching carriage grabbed my attention.
I raised my arm enough to see Holmes’s face, then sighed, dropping my arm again.
“Bit of an unusual business, Watson. Might need to get your friend on it, but quietly.”
<You are protected until tomorrow, Hunter. We can promise no more than that.>
“Fox, you need to get up.”
That’s not always a good thing, though. All those stories you hear, about werewolves? Yeah, all the true ones were a Potential who was Awakened without proper preparation.
“You’re up to something, wolf. I don’t know what, yet, but know I will discover it, and I will stop you.”
Fox was standing, head hanging as he swayed slightly.
The troll flung its arm out, and I went flying. Luckily, my fall was broken by a large boulder. I slammed into it, hard enough to break something and send my ears ringing. I staggered to my feet, shaking my head to clear it as the troll rushed at me.
One kid, and apparently the leader, stepped in front of me.
“Yes, sir. All of them, as soon as the sun touched the horizon.”
He felt his brow raise as the stranger laughed. That laugh was clearly female, though roughened.
I caught the barest hint of of a grin as he climbed into the carriage, leaving me to clamber into the rear-facing seat.
His eyes drifted closed and he allowed himself to focus on the sensations of John’s lips and tongue, his hands along Sherlock’s hip and hair, the feel of John’s heart pounding under his fingers. He pulled away the barest amount, trying to catch his breath and still his pounding heart.
A pair of salamanders formed a path between Watson and one of the carriages, low lines of fire scorching the pristine white stone. Watson nodded at a pair of men, large brawny types, and approached the lead carriage.
A pair of brownies joined me, taking my pack.
“The grounds are more extensive,” Holmes said.
<Here. Wear this for now, and I will fix the rest of this,> they raised the pack with distaste. There was a suit laying across the bed.
But Holmes seemed as indifferent to the many attractive men who found their way to Baker Street as the women. Maybe slightly more, actually. He usually managed to find some way to tease Watson about the women, at least.
That symbol was on a wolfwalker tome.
I waited until nightfall, when I could only scent the priest in the small cottage behind the church. There were more elementals hanging around the church grounds than I expected. Most of the supernatural avoided religious places like churches. It did speak well for Father Simeon, however.
The excitement in the faun’s voice was almost palpable. I flicked an ear. Elementals were usually happy when a wolfwalker passed through, but never before had I heard one this… frantic.
Watson smiled in response. Fox really was pulling him out of the shell he’d been trying to build.
“Thanks again.” I turned to face Holmes and grinned. “So, we really don’t have time for the full explanation.”
I nodded. “My thanks. I plan to be gone at dusk.”
<There is an ally here, if you can see past the falsehoods.> So saying, the sylphs departed.
I lay back with a sigh. “Alright, lesson time.” I shot Watson a look. “I’d appriciate it if you kept this information away from your council, but I do understand if you’ve got to tell them.”
<That can wait, now that it’s out of the hands of someone who would abuse it. But I did want to talk to you, yes.>
I sighed. <We do need to talk though. Are you two coming up, or are we doing it like this?>
Holmes barked a laugh. “’Sherlock Holmes: His Limits’.”
Oh shit.
“I quite agree,” Watson said. He frowned. “We- I- will have to deal with Mary, when we return.”
“What can you tell me of the people here?”
Hopefully one of the gnomes or fauns managed to calm it down.
The man turned, relaxing a bit now that someone seemed to be taking him seriously.
<There have been instances of pack bonds between non-wolves and wolves, Hunter. That would give you the connection you desire, while also granting them the space you wish.>
I sighed. Puppies.
I stretched again, feeling my fur settle, then curled up in the middle of the elemental’s pattern.
At least this way, I could still see Fox…
I was exhausted, poisoned, wounded, and weakened. Any time something like this had happened before, it was taken out by a full pack. I was just one wolf. Going on, continuing this fight, it was suicide. There were several mages over at Shanbrook. They had been scrying me since the sylph, as well. I could leave this mage to his fellows. No one would blame me for taking off.
He raised a brow at the sylph’s message, but nodded. He gave the driver of the hansom the address of the Arcadian Club and settled back, idly wondering what the summons was about.
I licked my side to slow the bleeding and continued on. The ifrit proved saner than the Roc, merely bowing and dissipating when its bonds were broken.
“Well, at least you seem to be recovering. I’ve sent round to Drs. Anstruther and Jackson to handle your patients for a few days, to give you some space.”
“It suits you,” he replied, turning slowly in place to see all of the yard.
“The pair of you are madly in love with each other, have been for ages, from what I can tell. Since both of you feel some kind of way about me, I can slap a quick and dirty mate bond between us, let you keep an eye and send me help from a distance. Elementals won’t be able to help. Once this is done, I can take the bond away, or solidify it, but we’d need a real conversation about that first. That work for you?”
But I didn’t want to antagonize the mage. And I did want to see Holmes and Watson again.
“Keep an eye on my stuff, please,” I said, barely waiting for one of the fauns to reply before shifting and trotting off.
“I have wanted to kiss you for ages.”
I did, and felt him brush some magic along the ache in my shoulder.
The thing about “talking” as a wolf is it’s not really talking. Wolves don’t have vocal cords. So, as a wolf, we can project our thoughts to others. Elementals can hear us just fine. Mages, too, although they don’t listen. Other wolves can, as well, whether they can shift or not.
I grinned at the brief flare of satisfaction that garnered me, and returned to the bedroom. Things were looking up, and I could take the time to recover before I tackled the burned tome, the Council, and whatever was brewing in Europe.
“Every faithful sheepdog was once a wolf, Hunter.” He rose as bells began chiming in the village. “Come to the church, and I will tell you what I know. I can also assist you in finding a place to stay, and navigating what may be unknown to you.”
“Indeed.”
She said nothing at first, just watching him with sad eyes.
The brownie sniffed again, and I was alone.
The bitterness in her voice cut him, far more than her words.
He climbed through the half-rotted door.
“They’re coming, aren’t they.”
I sat, studying him. <That’s my name, don’t wear it out.>
Watson sipped his tea. “My thanks.”
If possible, the faun’s ears drooped even more. <Hunted. Slain. Mages fear your kind, and they killed all the packs.>
Letter drafted, he handed it of to the butler, then stood at the window, gazing out over the grounds.
“Mr. Sherlock!”
“There was one other thing I wanted to know.”
“I take it that’s the major group of mages who hunted my kind to extinction?”
“And is what you think of Fox?”
<And the rest of you?>
So. The big house, where the money was. Newly arrived mage, probably wealthy. Either he was hunting the same thing I was, or he was hunting me. Likely we had the same prey. I doubted the elementals would alert mages to my presence.
I let my mind wander as I ran. According to all the stories, Watson was a good man. Granted, he was also the one writing most of them, and people hardly tried to paint themselves in a bad light. But the sylphs seemed to like him, so point in his favor there.
The heart fell. “Doing what, Mary?”
Holmes glared at Lord Acton. “That ‘abomination’ is doing far more than you and yours, and you have made no mention of going to assist.”
I straightened my spine and turned to face them.
“I know.” She turned to face him, still hugging herself. “I do love you, John. You’re kind. Kind, and gentle, and loving. You’d be almost perfect, if you weren’t so bound to Holmes. I’ve had time to think, while you followed him on his cases. I loved you once. Maybe I could learn to love you again. But not now. Not when you keep jumping every time he beacons.”
“John,” Sherlock breathed.
“Well, come on, then. You have hardly any time before the carriage will be here.”
My head whipped up. Davy was crouched in one of the cages, arm outstretched towards me.
He shook that off. He would wait, see what this wolfwalker would do.
“Hunter. I don’t believe you managed to see the paper yesterday morning.”
I could feel Watson huff in annoyance. <And your knowledge of our feelings?>
Claire counted out the cash slowly, carefully lining up every bill on the counter before moving on to the next. Since I’d seen her count considerably more in half the time, I knew she was just doing it to make me late. She was succeeding. The last bus had already come and gone before she’d gotten halfway, and I could smell the oily satisfaction oozing off her.
Well, now. That was new.
“Mary, what’s-”
“I assume you know more than you’re telling?”
He stretches, chuckling as he catches sight of Sherlock’s rumpled suit jacket and trousers on the floor. He remembers how much it used to turn him on, to wake in the morning after a night of glorious love making and see those expensive articles abandoned, having been hastily removed and promptly forgotten. Still turns him on, if he’s being honest. He swings his legs over the bed, ignoring the growing interest in his pants in favor of heading toward the music.
“John,” Sherlock murmurs, enfolding him until their bodies are indistinguishable, wrapped together in the bedclothes, and John weeps without restraint. There is no precedent for this love he cannot bear to live one more second of his life without. There is no precedent for the surge in his chest when he realizes he will never again have to.
The frigid shock returns him to his senses, physically if not mentally, and for an endless moment he stands, icy water sluicing over his body, mourning and hoping and chastising and
“I love you, John,” Sherlock breathes through kisses. “You’re everything. God, everything.”
“I’m not ever giving you up,” he tells Sherlock, a subtle growl in his tone. “Most days I can barely believe that after all these years, I finally have the fucking pleasure of calling you mine.”
Sherlock, sat uncomfortably in his armchair, turns cautious eyes to the man stood in the doorway of their (
He brings his Strad to life while John dances with Mary. The bow and strings feel like acid in his hands, and for the first time he can ever recall, he takes no pleasure in a melody of his own creation.
He imagines most people nurse arousal by picturing far filthier things than the look in someone's eyes during a first kiss, but there it is. He's unspeakably aroused by the fresh memory of John Watson kissing him. He grinds his face into his pillow, pleading to nothing that he can resume sleep before sorrow overtakes him again.
“Sherlock.” He’s not sure if he’s asking or telling.
He’d waited. He wants to bring up the fall. He doesn’t.
John shifts back, still on elbows, to better take in the scene Sherlock is presenting him, though his head is still hazy.
“Will you wait, Sherlock?”
buzzing with something he's never known before.
Sherlock doesn’t answer, just watches him with those silver eyes that seem to melt in the firelight. John has never loved anything as much.
John doesn’t see Mary now. Maybe he’ll never know what she really was. But he’s glad for what what his heart made her, in the absence of Sherlock, to push him back to where he belongs.
“I was just- just taking a moment,” he starts, but John waves off anything further as his smile widens, though minutely nervous, and there's a knee-jerk shift into consulting detective focus that Sherlock frantically attempts to stall.
John would shift where he’s sat and grin over at Sherlock. “Sentimental nonsense for sure, yeah. But probably some truth in it.“
faith in: his own steadfast brilliance, and his life-altering partnership with an army doctor.
John stands to embrace him and Sherlock thinks desperately that there isn't a single lie he wouldn't tell, in the name of keeping John Watson safe. He clutches at John's blazer for just a moment, and prays to every non-existent deity of every human religion catalogued in his hard drive that he will be able to do just that.
“But John,” Sherlock had whispered. “What if I’m just not
His lips part and he feels too warm. If John has taken notice of this deviation, his expression is not giving that away, and so Sherlock draws in a steadying breath to continue.
There’s a shrug and a quirk of lips from Sherlock in concession to the statement. John laughs, all fondness, and strokes his thumb over Sherlock’s lips again.
The song ends, but Sherlock is frozen under John’s touch, stormy eyes glistening, giving him away.
Sherlock’s lips are trembling beneath his fingers. He turns his body to directly face the man, their knees slotting together.
John shrugs. He’s still in awe. He thinks he’s smiling but he can’t be sure. It would feel so foreign now.
John had put his hands on him and kissed him. For Sherlock, it's not unlike staring down a perilous slope, where once he
“Not even the work?” John laughs through a sob.
He deletes that with a sigh.
It is eight nights when he realizes that perhaps he could pass this time, where John is unavailable, by being useful, perhaps even seeking support in their plot against Mary. Admonishing himself, he considers Lestrade and the Yard, before scoffing because he knows even
“Does that quite make sense to you, John?” he would say. “Or is it just sentimental nonsense?”
and say hello! :)
"Not weeks." John's voice is a rasp and a murmur at the same time. "Longer than that, god. Much longer."
Sherlock, though still attempting to melt his skin in an effort to not think of John in bed, cannot prevent the flashes of
John struggles to push himself up on his elbows, awareness coming back to him rapidly, though he suspects he has a concussion. He's lying on pavement - he recalls falling to meet it after finding himself pistol whipped clean to the temple by the target of their investigation that evening. Police lights flash too bright across his vision, though from only one vehicle, John deduces, so Lestrade must have arrived before the rest of the Yard (not surprising). And Sherlock-
And now…
I wrote this crap after The Hug, where I still had hope for johnlock confirmation in ep 3. :) :) :)
“I mean it though, Sherlock.” John tells him quietly, and Sherlock pushes down the uneasiness of recognizing that John has cried, perhaps for an extended period, and obviously substantially. “Thank you. Trust you to look out for me.”
Sherlock smiles, radiant and cocky and eager. John barrels him down into his chair as the Strad is set safely aside, their lips meeting furiously, and he can taste everything except doubt.
He doesn't expect an answer until morning, so he sets his mobile down and wriggles into his sheets. What he
As always, his doctor is the exception.
“Funny you should finally ask for help, dear brother, when these came to my attention only this morning.”
“And you deigned to intrude in my flat without waiting for a response because…?”
He stands by and watches the woman who will never deserve his doctor, and who may very well hurt him, take him far enough out of reach that even the memory of John’s kiss-come-confession is of little consolation.
“Yes, John.” Quiet, patient, tender, murmured into his hair.
He can't bear to think of the next several weeks, where John will have to be absorbed in Mary and newlywed life. Where Sherlock will be severely restricted in seeing him. He's not sure if this is fear for John's safety or something else entirely but he aches at the idea all the same.
“John,” Sherlock says to him, voice tremulous with emotion, and that concerns John, though not so much at that second as does the image of Sherlock wearing his jumper.
Sherlock squints at his mobile before tossing it aside, deciding he'll check the time the message was received in the morning. He groans with dissatisfaction as he settles back into the bed and glares at the bulge beneath his pyjamas.
In the course of eight years, John has come to understand Sherlock as a highly emotional man, far removed from the portrait of a sociopath he had once tried so hard to present. However, John cannot say he has ever truly understood the depth of insecurity behind Sherlock’s confidence (and sometimes arrogance).
(See the end of the chapter for
He strips out of the suit and leaves it on the bathroom floor, quite content to never wear it again, and heads straight for his bedroom. He pauses in the doorway, a wordless exclamation of distress leaving him without his permission as he braces against the wall and clenches his eyes shut.
). If John has chosen him in any manner
He is rigid with indecision and agitation, and John's eyes flick downward ever so briefly-
Sherlock melts under his lips, startlingly delicate hands coming to clutch at his jaw as he pushes closer for more. John drinks Sherlock in like he's been parched for this since the moment they met, and if he's being honest, that's entirely the case. His temple throbs again and he moves back. An ambulance pulls up next to Lestrade, and John is grateful for the promise of medical attention, though impatient for the next opportunity to kiss his flatmate.
