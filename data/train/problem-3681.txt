“Oh—yeah, that’d be great,” Mary told him, seeming a little overwhelmed.  Next to her, Sam stood up again and placed his hand on her shoulder.
When they got to the front door, they lingered for a moment, neither of them moving to open it.  They stood facing each other, and Castiel didn't know what to do.  He gripped the strap of his briefcase and looked down before meeting Dean's eyes again.
Dean forced himself to look up.  "I was being a dick.  And you know . . . I said some stuff I didn't mean.  I know you were just trying to help."  Two things occurred to Castiel then.  The first was that Dean was apologizing for his behavior, and it sounded like he was apologizing for more than just the other night.  The second was that this was the first time Dean had acknowledged that Castiel was helping them.
“Then why don’t you just
A smile tugged at the corners of Castiel’s mouth at the sentiment.  “I’m fine,” he said.
Uriel was considering him.  “It’s the son, isn’t it?  Dean?”
No matter how cowardly, Castiel knew he was right in trying to leave.  Now that Dean was in front him, he wasn’t certain he would ever want to go.  The thought of it alone left him hollow.
The call ended, and Castiel hauled himself out of bed and walked to the closet, where he’d hung his clothes.  He pulled on his faded old jeans, and kept the black t-shirt he was wearing for bed over it.  He grabbed his coat next.  On the bed, his phone lit up in a text message from Sam.
“Oh, Mom, you’ll never guess who came into the garage today,” he said at once, his mouth still a little filled with food.  He’d spooned a divot into the top of his mashed potatoes to catch the gravy they were drowning in.
“Do you understand that, if completed, your departure is permanent and irreversible?”
He led Uriel to the front door before knocking.  He kept his shoulders back and his spine straight, doing his best not to give away the roiling in his gut.  His heart skipped a beat when he heard footsteps from within, following by the lock disengaging.  The door swung open.  Dean wasn’t exactly smiling, but his eyes were alight, the green of them stark and vivid against the overcast day.
Castiel looked down at his lap, unable to meet Dean’s eyes, darkened by the night but still so green, head on.  “It was too advanced.  And I watched her weaken and deteriorate and inevitably die.”  He could still see his sister in her hospital bed—how fragile she’d become.  He thought, if he breathed on her the wrong way, she’d blow away like dust.  “And there was nothing I could do.”
“Well, like I said, it’s not my decision,” Gabriel told them.
Castiel pulled his own vehicle to the curbside in front of the house and put it into park.  He picked up his briefcase from the passenger seat and rifled through it quickly, double-checking that he had all the paperwork he needed to conduct Mrs. Winchester’s interview.  Once satisfied, he got out of the car and started up the walkway to the front of the house.
“Yes, I did.”  Dean lifted his chin.  “And you stayed.  You think someone else’ll stick around to put up with me?  I’m an asshole.  And Sam and Mom ain’t too pleasant, either.”
Dean kept staring at his mother.
In the past, people had told Castiel that his face wasn’t very expressive.  Perhaps it was the nature of his job.  He’d trained himself to keep all emotion from bubbling up the surface, which perhaps began long before he started working at the Departure Network.  But, presently, he felt as if he were balking.  In reality, he was probably just staring ahead blankly and blinking more than necessary.
Mary took it in stride.  In fact, she almost seemed relieved.  “Probably for the best.  I’m
Dean shrugged, and laughed a little nervously, in that way people do when they’re sad.  “So?  Dying’s the easy part, right?”
“No,” he said, turning back to the phone.  “I’m still in Lawrence.  I’m with the Winchesters now.”
When he looked over his shoulder, the door was closed.  Dean hadn't slammed it.  Castiel hadn't heard him shut it at all.
A few times, on her better days that were increasingly few and far between, Mary insisted they go to Sam's office for the appointment.  Sam usually protested, saying it was no trouble for him to go back and forth to the house, and Castiel mostly agreed.  Straining herself in such a way was unnecessary.  But it seemed Dean had inherited his hardheadedness from his mother.  Perhaps she just wanted to prove to herself that she could do it.
“Should she be approved, the preparation process normally takes four to six weeks.”
He really didn't know what to do.  This was the first time one of the Winchesters had hugged him.  In fact, he couldn't recall the last time he'd been hugged by anyone.  It was strange, but also . . . pleasant.  Hesitantly, he brought his arms up and loosely returned the embrace.  "Goodnight."
When the kiss broke, they stayed close, sharing the air between them in heavy exhales and deep, panting inhales.  Each one sent a puff of hot air out of Dean’s lung and into Castiel’s.  Dean’s mouth and chin were slick and red, and Castiel bit down on his lower lip as he realized he was the reason for that.  Beneath Castiel’s palm, Dean’s heart was racing, and Castiel almost wanted to take Dean by the wrist and place his hand over Castiel’s heart to show him that he was feeling the same.
Castiel shrugged.  "I wanted to be a pilot when I was a child."
Castiel huffed.  "Dean—"
When Castiel entered the bar, the soft melody of a folky rock song drifted toward him.  The crowd was thin, a few people around the booths and the tattered pool table, only one group in a hushed conversation.  It was a weeknight, but even at peak social hours Castiel wasn't certain the place would be filled with a young crowd looking for a good time.
Mary nodded.  “I invited Castiel to join us, so we’ll have to set another plate.  I’m guessing you made enough.”  Her gaze went to Castiel.  “Dean usually cooks enough for an army.”
"Oh.  Hey, Cas," Sam said, the wild look in his eyes subsiding somewhat.  Castiel couldn't help but to feel a rush of warmth at the diminutive form of his name.  Sam had only ever called him Castiel, which probably meant the brothers had spoken about Castiel at some point.  They'd spoken about him, and Dean had referred to him as Cas.
What could be the harm of it?  If he were truly being taken off Mary’s case, there was no reason to worry about getting too close to the Winchesters.  Selfishly, he thought this whole situation was freeing.  He could have Dean now, at least for the night; and then he would go back to Boston in the morning and never come back to Lawrence, but he could pretend that wasn’t about to happen.  It wasn’t real yet.  The only things that were real were the scrape of Dean’s stubble and the heat of his hands on Castiel’s body.
"Yes," Castiel said, trying to shake his embarrassment.  It had been a misunderstanding.  Dean had misspoken.  That was all.  "Well, technically Belmont.  That's where I grew up.  I live in Fenway now, in the city.  When I'm there, that is."
“I’ll just—” Castiel said, already turning away, but Dean grabbed his shoulder, halting him.
Dean shook his head, like he couldn’t believe what he was about to do.  He said, “Look, just come inside, alright?  They’ll be back any minute.”
"What?" he asked, suddenly self-conscious.  He tilted his head to the side.
above my paygrade.  Literally above yours.  And if there’s an afterlife, awesome.  If not, I guess we’ll never really know the difference, right?  Either way, it’s not anything to be afraid of.”
“Yes,” Castiel told him.  “I’m with the Departure Network.  We received your mother’s application a few days ago, and I’m here to conduct a preliminary interview with her to determine whether this course of action is best suited to her situation.”
It had taken him all day to work up enough bravado to finally come over.  Because, in truth, he didn't want to see the reality of it all sink into the Winchesters' expressions.
Castiel headed back downstairs.  Eager to put his mind to work, he set in on the dishes in the sink.  It was a poor distraction.  Mary’s words kept echoing in his head.
Castiel leaned forward, too, so that Dean wouldn’t have to strain his neck.  It was better to be level with him for such a conversation.  “I meant what I said, Dean.  Your father—this.  None of it is your responsibility.  You can’t continuously carry the brunt of your family’s trauma without it causing you to collapse.  Your mother doesn’t want that.  Why do you think she’s going through with this?  She told me you and Sam moved back in with her after she was diagnosed, to help take care of her.  But you aren’t taking care of yourself, Dean.  You have a life of your own.  Your mother wants you to get back to that.  And maybe you know that already, and perhaps it’s what you want, too.  Maybe that’s causing you guilt.  But it shouldn’t.  This isn’t your fault.”
It was ill advised, and downright stupid, but he let go of his anger and let his grief take hold.  He wanted to tell Dean what happened.  He wanted to have some kind of connection with him, no matter how morbid.  And maybe . . . Maybe he just wanted to talk about his sister.  Maybe it was time.
.  She believed it, so maybe there was something to it.”
The funeral was held three days later.  It was open-casket, but Castiel could hardly bring himself to look inside at the body, with half a dozen layers of make-up on stretched skin, cold to the touch, feeling like cracked parchment to his fingertips.  He hadn’t touched the body, but he remembered the feeling—from Anna.  It wasn’t something he thought he’d ever forget, and it certainly wasn’t something he was willing to do again.
Castiel moved his hips, fucking himself in and out of their hands.  Dean was bucking up into them, and his expression was strained with intense focus.  Castiel wanted to kiss the lines of his face, so he leaned down, stretching his spine uncomfortably, but it was worth it.  He kissed Dean’s forehead, between his brows, under his eyes, the tip of his nose.  He got to his mouth and Dean kissed him back enthusiastically, both of them breathing hard between kisses.
"That right?  Yeah, I hate flying, too."
“You can say that again,” Dean said, his voice somewhere near a laugh.  “I guess I just never really thought of what’s next, ya know?  I mean, Sam’ll probably go back to California eventually.  And . . . I dunno—maybe I’ll keep the house for a little while?  But without anybody else here . . .” He let himself trail off, and Castiel tried not to let the fissure of disappointment that ran through his heart reach his lungs.  He didn’t even know why it was there.  He hadn’t expected Dean to ask him to stay longer than required—but, perhaps, deep down, he’d hoped.
Mary placed her hand on Castiel’s shoulder, dragging him in closer to Dean until their shoulders brushed.  Her gaze flickered between the two of them, seemingly assessing them.  It was uncomfortable, and Castiel had already been feeling awkward enough.  His eyes slid to Dean in question.  Dean looked back and pulled the corners of his mouth down to show he, too, was clueless.
"Thank you for dinner," Castiel said, wanting to fill the silence.  He wiped down the plate until the glass squeaked, but lines of moisture were still left on the glass.  He set it down on the counter and picked up the next one.  "It was nice to eat something that didn't come from a take-out box."
After, Castiel returned to his motel room with a cheeseburger from the local diner in a to-go box.  He plopped it down on the small table in the corner of the room to fill out the final paperwork for Ms. Baker.  He didn’t know how much he’d actually eat, as he usually didn’t have much of an appetite after assisting in a departure; and, honestly, living off soggy diner food for the last six weeks was beginning to get disgusting.  Not that he wasn’t used to it.
do anything, he supposed.  And Gabriel was right: he was already there.  There was no point in sending another Guide out, especially to conduct a preliminary interview.  There was no telling if this candidate would even be approved, anyway.  And what was the alternative?  Two days driving toward an empty apartment and TV dinners?  Castiel would rather be working.
She seemed to be expecting the question, because a small smile pulled on the corners of her lips, and her shoulders sagged.  She exhaled, and it sounded more like a wheeze than a sigh.  "I know.  I'm awful for putting even more pressure on him," she said remorsefully.
“Goody,” Gabriel said.  “So, guess I’ll talk to you in a few days.”
"I'll be up in a sec," he promised.
He placed his knees on each side of Dean legs and sat up.  Dean blinked up at him, eyes wide and hair askew against the bed, and he was acting like the sight before him was the best thing he’d ever seen.  Castiel knew for a fact that was true on his own part.  Dean was beautiful.  He was sturdy and strong and every inch of him was as lovely and imperfectly exquisite as he was on the inside.
“I . . .” Castiel said unsurely, gaping as he turned to watch Uriel walk further into the room.  His fist was still tight around the doorknob.  Not knowing what else to say and hoping Uriel wouldn’t comment on the state of the room, he said, “Yes.”
Castiel let his eyes fall closed, dejected.  He couldn’t find anything else to say.  He felt as if he’d failed Dean.
“Dean,” he called as he approached, the frozen grass crunching under his shoes.  When Dean’s head snapped up, his nose and cheeks were pink, and Castiel wasn’t certain that was from the temperature.  He didn’t mention it.  He settled in front of Dean, looking into his eyes, a little red, making the green of them impossibly clear.  “I wondered where you went.”
He signed his name at the bottom and set down his pen.  He remembered his food then, and the plastic bag crinkled in an all-too familiar sound as he took out the to-go box.  The bag was white and it had an obnoxious smiley face on both sides with the works
Sam paused.  And then, “You sure?”  He asked it as if he hadn’t called Castiel for this specific reason.  And, no, Castiel wasn’t sure, but he knew Sam was relying on him—in a way, so was Dean—and he couldn’t let them down.
It didn’t take long for footsteps to sound inside, and the door swung open to a man in what appeared to be his early thirties.  He was tall and broad, light brown hair the same color as the freckles scattered across his nose.  He wore a t-shirt under an open plaid shirt with the sleeves rolled up to his elbows to reveal strong forearms.  He struck Castiel immediately as very mid-western, but simultaneously a caliber above anyone else he’d ever laid eyes on.  And, for a moment, Castiel forgot why he was there.
“Ah, just lookin’,” Dean said, gently tossing the photo back into the box.
Somehow, it didn’t bother him, especially when he heard the sheets rustle behind him and felt Dean’s strong arms wrap around his torso.  Dean kissed the back of his neck with a soft, dry press of lips.
“But I have seen many people die, and I promise you, you are not leaving her alone.”  He slid his hand across Dean’s back, to his far arm, and hooked his chin on Dean’s shoulder.  Dean breathed out and tipped his head to rest against Castiel’s.  “You’ll be there with her, and so will Sam.  And so will I.  And we’ll do this together.  And, like you said, no matter what, she will be at peace, I promise you, Dean.”
Castiel met his stare, neither of them looking away for a long time.  Carefully, he said, “My reasons are personal, Mr. Winchester.  But, what it comes down to is this: I want to help people.”
Dean put his beer can in the sink, his eyes finally leaving Castiel’s in the process, and picked himself up off the counter.  He disappeared into the hall, and there was low chatter from the doorway.  Castiel waited patiently until Mary and her sons entered the kitchen.  Sam had his arm wrapped around Mary’s back, and her hand was in his for physical support as he slowly guided her into the room.  She had a tube in her nose that was connected to a portable oxygen tank.  Dean followed behind them, carrying the tank for his mother.  The strap of a care bag was hanging from his shoulder.
“Maybe even before that,” he mused.
Castiel didn’t
. . .
“Cas, we need you,” Dean interrupted.  He searched Castiel’s gaze, and as much as Castiel wanted to, he couldn’t look away.  Something in Dean’s eyes shifted.  It was imploring and vulnerable and desperate.  He said, “I need you.”
,” Gabriel said, dragging out the word.  Whether he believed it or not, he moved on.  “Anyway.  I heard back from HQ.”
And that wasn’t something he could allow.  He’d been stupid to forget that.
“Castiel,” Uriel answered jovially, clapping Castiel on the shoulder in a way that nearly knocking him off balance.  “I see management is making us suffer yet more filthy accommodations.”  He stepped inside the room, which was currently a hurricane of pizza boxes, empty beer bottles, an unmade bed, and Castiel’s overturned suitcase.
Dean cleared his throat before he spoke.  “Uh, yeah.  What I can say?  Needed to get away from the constant onslaught of
That was a loaded question.  He supposed, technically, he did; and, technically, he didn’t.
Dean stared at him for a long moment as if he were trying to fathom something out.  "Why did you?"
“But—” He exhaled, and it sounded shakier than before.  “This is
Castiel didn’t care much about what they watched.  He was too focused on the heat coming off of Dean’s skin in the space between them.  It didn’t take long for his eyes to start drooping, but he fought to stay awake.  However, when Dean cleared his throat and stretched his arm over the back of the couch where Castiel was sitting, Castiel found himself leaning in closer to his side.
Castiel watched on, feeling mostly invisible, but he didn’t mind.  He enjoyed listening to the Winchesters’ banter.
Castiel wrote it down, and that must have made Mary nervous because she hurried to say, “It’s just . . . I didn’t wanna lose my hair.  I know it sounds vain, but . . . And, you know.  It weakens you.  I didn’t want to get sicker than I am already.”
“Dean,” he gritted out, low enough for Gabriel to not hear.  The last thing they needed was an argument.
“Yeah, well, she better be.  I rebuilt her my own damn self,” Dean said shortly.  He took the wrench in his hand and tossed it into his toolkit.  He began packing it up.
Castiel’s gut reaction was to argue.  He tried to quell it, to marshal his thoughts into something more organized.  When he opened his mouth, he wasn’t sure if what he said would sway Gabriel’s decision in his favor or get him fired.  Still, he said, “All due respect, but I disagree.”
He was holding his breath, afraid that, if he tried to exhale, it would shudder out of him and cause the tautly pulled string of his body to tremble.
"Seriously.  Get—
Mary kept smiling at him, and Castiel couldn’t tell if she was nervous or friendly.  “They’ll be back in a sec.”  As if to fill the silence so it wouldn’t be awkward, Mary fiddled with her hands and said, “So, Castiel.  Are you from the area?”
Sam Winchester.
,” he had the good sense to add.
“Damn right, you are!” Dean called out before Castiel could answer.  His tone was hostile; and, when he’d asked Castiel to fight, Castiel didn’t think he’d meant it so literally.
His arm came up and hooked around Castiel’s waist to pull him in closer.  Castiel stumbled forward at the unexpectedness of it, his palms instinctually coming up to brace himself.  They landed on Dean’s chest, and their bodies pressed together.  Dean deepened the kiss by licking at the seam of Castiel’s mouth.  Castiel opened up to him easily, allowing for the slow roll of Dean’s tongue against his own.
“Yup.  All those years of chain smoking, I guess.”  She gave a wry kind of smile, and Sam chuckled lightly.  Castiel realized she must have been joking.  He carried on.
And he couldn’t tell Dean the answer.  Mary and Sam both looked at him expectantly, too, but Castiel couldn’t say.  It was personal, and it was better to remain impersonal.
“Maybe ‘cause you’re
This was very much the opposite of remaining detached.
He thought, maybe, he would stick around for Mary's, if only to support her sons.
“He—he won’t call them.  I promise,” Sam said sternly, shooting his brother a glare before returning his gaze to Castiel.  His eyes grew large and imploring.  “Please.”
Castiel shook himself out of it.  He stood up and put the medical records in his briefcase.
Once he was situated straddling Castiel’s lap, Castiel reached between them and undid the fly of Dean’s jeans.  He slid his hand down the front, beneath Dean’s cotton boxers, and brushed his fingers on Dean’s dick.  Dean shivered and broke the kiss.  He gasped out, “Cas—”
Castiel’s fingers tightened around his phone.  “It was a check-in,” he excused.  “I was . . . helping.  Emotionally.”  His voice sounded small even to his own ears.  His job wasn’t to be a therapist.  At most, he was supposed to give out brochures and refer the patient and their family members to a counselor.  Even if he were supposed to be a shoulder to cry on, he’d just lied to Gabriel.  He and Dean hadn’t spoken about Mary or her departure throughout the meal at all.
Castiel tried to breathe.  He and Uriel had worked on a few cases together years ago.  Uriel had always seemed to like Castiel.  Maybe this wouldn’t be as bad as it sounded.
They stroked each other through the final waves of their orgasms, and then they stilled.  And caught their breath.
Castiel felt Sam’s eyes land on him unsurely, but it was only for a brief time, and he said, “Yeah, sure.  Be right back.”
The TV burst on, breaking the darkness and the quiet with a sudden onslaught of flashing blue light and staticky noise.  Dean cursed at the volume and hastily turned it lower—much lower than it would have been in the daylight hours.  He flipped through infomercials and late-night talk shows, eventually landing on a black and white cowboy movie on some B-rated cable channel.
But that was something that seemed very far off, especially at the moment.  Mary seemed so alive, so animated, as she sat on the couch across the coffee table from him.  She was grinning and laughing and joking around with her family.  She was shoveling forkfuls of the pie Dean had picked up from the bakery to celebrate her coming home into her mouth and melting around each bite.  It seemed unthinkable that she would be gone soon.  It wasn't real.  Her presence was much too ingrained within the home, and Castiel thought the physical structure of the house might crumble, and the grass in the lawn might brown, the tree out front would decay, when she died.
He didn’t argue.
Sam let out a heavy sigh and sat down in the chair his mother had been in.  “Sorry about him,” he said, and he could only be talking about Dean.
Castiel nodded at her and offered a small, polite smile of his own.  “Hello, Mrs. Winchester.”
"Yes."
"You," Castiel growled.  They were attracting some looks, but he didn't care.  He grabbed Dean by the elbow and tried to pull him toward the door, but Dean shook him off.
“You sure?” Dean asked, eyeing him skeptically.
Castiel sighed.  This wasn’t the first time a candidate’s family member had less than subtly told him to fuck off.
The memory of Dean’s kiss was prominent on Castiel’s lips, like a weight.  He felt as if his thoughts were wading through water.  He blurted out, “Who are you sending?”
Castiel looked down at his plate and chuckled a little.  It was an inside joke he had with himself.  “I suppose you can say I went from wanting to work for the law to becoming a criminal.”
Castiel felt his smile in his eyes, followed by a sting of pressure.  He breathed in, nodding.  When he was sure he could speak, he said, “I don’t have plans.”
He was about to make his exit when Mary said, quite abruptly, “Castiel, why don’t you stay for lunch?  We could whip up some sandwiches.”
Dean rumbled.  “Think you can help me out with that?”
Castiel barely heard it, because at the same moment, Dean had hooked his arm into Castiel’s.  He slid their hands together, lacing their fingers.  Castiel turned his face to look at him, awestruck.  Dean didn’t look back.  He kept his eyes forward on the phone like he was in a staring contest with it.
“He was really messed up about Mom being here.  I think he must be at a bar,” Sam went on.  “Look, I hate to ask this, but I have to stay here with Mom, and if he’s drunk, he might say something about—you know.  You.  I mean, the Departure Network.”
Castiel pulled out his wallet from his coat and dropped a twenty-dollar bill on the counter, hoping it was enough to cover Dean's expenses.  He kept his eyes fixed on Dean the entire time.  Then, he grabbed Dean by the arm and all but dragged him outside.
Sam shook his head, trying to remember.  “God, I dunno.  It was like a million years ago.”
He noticed Dean put his hand on Mary’s shoulder protectively.  She reached up and placed her palm on top of it.
Dean didn’t say anything.  He blinked drunkenly at Castiel, one of his eyelids sticking together a half of a second longer than the other one at a point.  His lips were parted in something that could have been offense or disbelief, and Castiel didn’t really care.
"Well," Castiel said, licking his lips and looking up as he decided the best way to phrase this.  "My line of work draws . . . a certain amount of attention from the authorities.  The federal government doesn't like me leaving the State of Massachusetts.  I find it best to avoid unnecessary security checkpoints if I can.  I have to answer less questions that way."
decided it,” Dean argued, tone clipped.  “I decided, over my dead body.”
As the phone continued to ring, he watched the way Mary worried at her bottom lip and the way Sam ran his hand through his hair.  Under his breath, Dean was muttering, “C’mon, c’mon, answer . . .”
“Yeah,” Dean agreed, and there was a certain force behind his voice.  Some stubbornness, some weighty determination.  “You’re family now, Cas.”
Castiel couldn’t advise that Dean or Sam help their mother to die without the supervision of a Departure Guide.  If something went wrong, they could go to jail, and Mary could put herself in a worse position.  Still, it wouldn’t be the first time a person took their own life when their application was rejected.  Castiel just didn’t want the Winchesters to have to go through that.  Not alone.
It had been a few days since Mary had gotten home from the hospital, and she'd made her sons sit down to help her plan her funeral.  A grumble went through the room and Mary insisted it would "be fun."  Castiel had gotten roped into it, too, somehow.  He didn't see how planning one's own funeral could be considered fun, but so far there were plans for fireworks and a burial plot on the moon, not to mention the Beatles cover band.
“That’s about it, actually,” Dean said.  He was squinting slightly in the early October sun.  It hit is hair just right, making it light up in what could almost be auburn.  “The garage isn’t far from here.  I usually stretch my legs during my break.  Clear my head.  You know.”
Sam nodded.  “Okay.  Well, Mom’s just in here.”  He took Castiel into the living, where a faded cloth couch and an old armchair with a knitted throw over it were situated in front of a television set.  Framed family pictures were on almost every flat surface—the mantel over the fireplace, the end table under the lamp, the shelving unit along the back wall.  There were also strange decorations scattered around, and Castiel thought they must be some kind of religious artifacts.  There were candles with sigils designed inside the dripping wax, pendants on braided strings, a statue of a cherub over the fireplace, and a Buddha on the windowsill.  In a town that was predominantly Christian, Castiel couldn’t quite tell what religion the Winchesters practiced.
seriously.  I’m sure there’s no cause for concern.”
Dean didn’t say anything for a long time.  He just stared ahead.  It was dark, but Castiel thought he saw a tear drop down quickly from his cheek in the pink glow of a neon sign.  And that was a relief.  It meant Dean was accepting what had to be done; but it didn’t make it any less unfair.
Castiel tried to remind himself of Dean’s personality.  And why he was there.  This had never happened before.  He’d never become so bothered by a patient’s family member.  But, God help him, all he wanted to do was put his hands on Dean and trace his fingers along every part of him.
Mary slipped her hand out of Sam’s and lifted it, reaching toward Castiel.  He stared at it for a long second before stepping forward again and taking it.  Her hand was warm and her eyes were a little wetter than before when she said, “Thank you, Castiel.”
They made the real plans a little easier to swallow.  A simple ceremony at the local funeral home, bouquets of daisies, and a pine box, as Mary planned to be cremated and her ashes buried in the cemetery with John's so "there's no need for a big expensive casket."
“Dean, get in the car.  D—Dean—” Castiel wrestled to keep him in his hold as Dean spun around, this time pointed in the direction of the bar.
And he realized suddenly that he'd called Dean by his first name to his face.  He had never done that before.  It had slipped out so naturally, like the word wasn't foreign to his tongue in the slightest, where he’d struggled with his own sister’s name just hours before.  He didn't need to get a feel for Dean’s name in his mouth; it was already there.  He didn't think Dean had even noticed it happening, either.
He picked up the burger, rotating it a few times in his hand as if looking for a more appetizing angle.
.  It was the only thing that mattered anymore.
He sat in a chair next to Dean’s at Mary’s bedside.  The too-sterile scent of the hospital was clogging Castiel’s senses, making his skin dry and his eyes itch.  It caused his thoughts to become foggy.  The bitter taste of cafeteria coffee sat on the back of his throat.  Under the green lights, he felt as if he were inside of a dream.
“Hello, Uriel.”
He tilted his head to the side, eyes steady and imploring.  “Anything you ask.”
Castiel laughed dryly.  Dean had no idea how correct he was with that statement.
Sam was instantly scrambling to his feet.  "Here, Mom, let me help you up the stairs," he offered.
get the details right.
Castiel nodded.  Many people didn’t.  “That’s fine, but you’ll need to file one.  It’s necessary in case there comes a time during the preparation process or as a result of the departure that you’re unable to voice your decision.  If you wish, I can help you with that for an additional fee.  Do you have a lawyer you would like to use for this?”
Castiel sighed at the toiletry bag in his hands.  He looked down at the open suitcase on his bed, his clothes folded in neat squares inside.  Part of him had hoped he’d be gone before the Winchesters got the call that he was taken off their case.  He knew that was cowardly of him, but he didn’t think he could handle saying goodbye.  Because this was different than the other goodbyes.  Mary was still alive.
idea what that like—”
And Castiel tried to pretend he wasn't hanging onto every single word.
Panic spiked in Castiel’s chest.  He’d never exactly been rich.  He wasn’t certain he could afford to pay for everything for very long.  But he didn’t anticipate the decision taking more than a few days.  Maybe he could swing it.
“Do you have a living will?”
Into the phone, Castiel said, “I’ll stay.”
When they broke to catch their breath, Dean was grinning, and Castiel felt his lips pull up into a gummy smile.
in blue below it.  He opened the Styrofoam box to find the limp, lukewarm burger and spongey fries inside.
Sam groaned loudly, practically tossing his head back.  “Yeah, good luck,” he said, sounding sarcastic.
“Oh, yeah,” Dean said, his voice kicking up an octave as he recalled the memory.  There was a sly grin on his features, and Castiel realized that was the very first time he’d seen Dean smile.  “What play was that again?”  He snapped and pointed at Sam.  “
When the laughter died down, there was a pause in conversation.  Mary took a bite of her food and hummed, as if getting out the last of her laughter.  She put her fingers in front of her face to hide her chewing as she said, “So, Castiel.  You mentioned you weren’t from around here.  Where do you live?”
Dean took a step forward, titling his head to the side to keep Castiel’s eyes.  “Okay.  And?  Why’s that a bad thing?”
He knew the Winchesters felt it, too.  He’d walked in on the brothers whispering to one another one night in the kitchen, discussing what they were going to do if Castiel was taken off the case.  They pretended they hadn’t been speaking at all when Castiel joined them.
Castiel’s eyes connected with him.  “I prefer Clint Eastwood.”
There was a smirk on Dean's face, shy and wistful, and Castiel couldn't stop thinking about kissing him, no matter how hard he tried.  Castiel pulled his bottom lip between his teeth and let his eyes flicker downward as he imagined it, and he couldn't stop his own small smile from lighting his face.
"Okay."
“And I understand the cancer has metastasized?”
At last, he pulled up to the front of the house, and Dean was opening his door while the car was still in motion.
Castiel dropped his shoulders tiredly.  “Uriel’s a coworker.  A good one.  He’s been sent here to—”
He gave her hand a gentle squeeze of assurance.  She knew he wasn’t going anywhere.
Castiel trailed away from his lips, kissing Dean’s chin and down his throat.  He listened to Dean’s choppy breathing as he went, mouthing at his Adam’s apple when Dean titled his head back to give him better access.  Dean made a low moaning sound, and Castiel felt the vibrations from it on his lips.  He realized, somewhere along the line, Dean had managed to undo his pants, and now Dean’s hands were on his ass, groping and kneading and shoving their hips together.  Castiel felt himself filling out against the warm lines and planes of Dean’s body, and he wanted more.
They kissed in the yellow glow of the porch light, as the gusts of wind chapped their cheeks and whipped up beneath the tails of Castiel's coat.  Dean's hands were on the back of his neck, fingers brushing into his hair.  Castiel lifted his hands and placed them on the crook of Dean's elbows, feeling where his sleeves were rolled up.  Dean was warm and alive and soft and beautiful.  The kiss was gentle, unlike what it was the other night.  When Dean's lips parted, the slow roll of his tongue against Castiel's was intoxicating.  He tasted like cherry pie.
Castiel felt everyone’s eyes weighing on him.  He glanced at them in turn, his gaze snagging on Dean for a moment longer than he’d intended.  He reached forward, tapped the speaker icon, and brought his phone to his ear.  “Hello?”
Mary seemed to be mustering his thoughts, but Sam spoke first.  “How long does it usually take?  You know, after the application is approved.”
He stood to the side to permit Castiel admittance, and Castiel stepped into entrance hallway of the house.  It opened up to a living room where a sports announcer was relaying the statistics of a game on a TV hidden by the wall, and a staircase led up to a landing with a small window before continuing on to the second level.
Dean shuffled a little, pushing his shoulder back against the tree’s rough bark.  “Mom wasn’t really religious,” he started.  “She was more . . . spiritual, I guess you could call it.  Didn’t really believe in God or anything like that.  More like—all the gods.  Or what they represent, anyway.  Forces or whatever.  I dunno, she was always pretty into that crap.”
There was a long pause—long enough that Castiel thought the call had dropped.  And then, “Castiel . . . am I on speaker phone?”
"So, Boston, huh?"
Dean straightened out.  Despite the chill in the fall air, he was in only a t-shirt.  A ring of perspiration was around the neckline and the armpits.  The shirt had a hole toward the bottom of it and it was covered in grease stains.  It hung off Dean’s body limply, stretching across his chest and showing off the outline of his arms.  And Castiel tried very hard not to notice any of it.
“Do you,” he asked carefully, “believe she’s going to a better place?”
“Yes, I know,” Mary said, voice soft and smile softer.  She let out a quick laugh.  “But I guess there’s no use turning back now, right?”
“What’s wrong?” he asked anyway.
,” Mary answered.  “And we’ll get you those medical records.”
He reminded himself why he shouldn’t.
Strangely, however, Castiel trusted him not to do any of those things.  And perhaps that was why he continued his tirade.
Castiel found himself watching Dean—barely blinking as he traced the lines of Dean’s profile.  Dean was leaning forward, his gaze intent on Mary, as if he could will her health to return.  Castiel wished he could.  He wished Dean didn’t have to endure this—even if it meant Castiel never met him.  As long as Dean was happy.
Dean’s brows were popped, and he held his arms out akimbo.  “Blink twice if you’re being held for ransom.”
He supposed that was the issue with dealing with a new patient and their families.  Castiel never truly knew what he was in for.
"What about you, Castiel?  Who's going to play at your funeral?" Mary asked.
“No.”
The door opened again, this time to an even taller man with longer brown hair and an apologetic expression.  He looked younger than the first man—Dean, Castiel assumed.
Castiel understood.  It was real now, hanging over them like a storm cloud, building in pressure and turning black, waiting to burst.  And, on the day Dean couldn’t stand to look at Castiel, falling back into old patterns of snipping at him and hurling insults, Castiel understood that, too.  Especially when, that night, Dean wrapped his arms around Castiel’s middle and buried his face into his throat and wouldn’t let go.  It was an apology easily accepted.
“Then what’s stopping me from calling the cops right now?”
“This is Uriel,” Castiel told him, keeping his voice neutral.  “He’ll be evaluating Mrs. Winchester’s case to ensure everything is up to protocol.  You won’t even know he’s here, Mr. Winchester.”
The brothers would have to call an ambulance, to tell them they found Mary like that.  Castiel would have to be gone for a few hours while the dust settled.  More than anything, he wished he could stay and help them through it.  It felt wrong, leaving.
Castiel resigned himself to not being about to get out of this.  He looked around to Uriel and nodded.  “I’ll be right there.”
But, despite her current state, he knew her condition was worsening.  She put on a brave face, but everyone knew.  She hadn't fully recovered from her bout of pneumonia, and it was unlikely she ever would.  Her lungs were too weak.  Every breath she took in rattled slightly, like she was breathing from under water, and she coughed more often than before.  The yellowing under her eyes had deepened and spread.  Her limbs trembled when she tried to stand.  She wore her oxygen tank at all times now, not just when she was leaving the house or performing an activity.  Her hood and nitrogen had been ordered as of a few hours ago, which was why Castiel had come over in the first place.  They would arrive in a few weeks’ time.
Castiel was instantly consumed by the cresting wave of emotion that had crashed into him.  He could hardly breathe under its pull.  All he felt inside of him was pressure—in his lungs, his chest, his head, behind his eyes.  He didn’t know how to say that Dean shouldn’t have been the thankful one.  That Castiel had been the one who was alone—and now he wasn’t.  Now, he had something to lose, and the thought of it terrified him.  But maybe it didn’t matter, after all.  Maybe what was important was that he’d found it in the first place.
He turned away again.  “Usually, Baby’d be able to take it.  She could bounce right off of any other car.  They’re all made outta plastic and they’re light as a feather these days.  But . . . it was a tractor-trailer.  Driver had been on the road too many hours.  Was practically asleep behind the wheel.  Ran a red light.”
“Cas, I know you’re in there!  Open the damn door!” Dean’s growling voice came through, muffled by the metal door.
“I should go send these in,” he said, regarding the file folder.  “Perhaps another time,” he added, half meaning it.
Unfortunately, when he pulled up next to the Winchester house, there was only one car in the driveway: the classic car that must have belonged to Dean, seeing as the hood was open and he was currently bent over the grill working on the engine.  Castiel paused for a moment, having to swallow hard at the sight of Dean’s ass in his old, oil stained jeans.  It was difficult to look away, because he kept moving it tantalizingly as he busied himself with the car.
Uriel walked in first, following Dean’s instruction.  Castiel followed after him, head ducked.  He didn’t know why it was so difficult to look at Dean now that they were inside.  He heard the front door close behind him, and then Dean’s, “Hey, Cas—
He understood.  He’d met many people who forewent chemotherapy for similar reasons.  It was Mary’s decision, and it would have little bearing on her application.  “That’s perfectly acceptable.”
"You would."
“You want me to go find Dean?”  His voice was even, measured, as he said it, but he felt anything but calm.  This was probably overstepping his boundaries, but the Sam was asking for his help.  He had to help them.  Dean was out there somewhere, alone and angry and depressed.  Castiel ached thinking about him that way.  He wanted to take Dean back to his motel room and just lay there in bed with him, holding him until Dean felt safe enough to sleep.
Dean barely glanced at him as he went back over to the pot of what Castiel assumed were mashed potatoes.  “You can set the table.  Plates are in that cabinet.”
“Fuck you!  I’m—back inside!” Dean slurred, his words lost to a few grunting noises as he attempted to unlatch Castiel’s arms from around him.  “Jesus, stop being so
She brought her gaze up to him, standing next to the bed, and there wasn’t a speck of regret in them.  There was fear, of course, but it was minimal to what Castiel had seen in others.  She gave him a soft smile, more to comfort herself than him.  “Yes, dear.  I read the contract before I signed it, if you remember.”
.”  The joke fell flat.  His eyes flashed toward the house, and he seemed a bit overwhelmed.  “There’s just, uh . . . a lot of people in there.”
Castiel looked down at his hands folded on the table in front of him.  He wanted to ask Dean more about his car—not because he had any interest in cars, but because he had an interest in Dean.  He wanted to ask him if he fixed cars for a living, and what made him choose that profession.  He wanted to ask him if he’d gone to college, and what he studied there.  Hell, he wanted to ask Dean what his favorite color was.
Upstairs, the four of them lingered around her bedroom door.  She had her arm around Dean for support, and Dean said, “You guys turn in.  I’m gonna get her ready for bed.”
He nodded, glad she’d understood his meaning.
“Hi, Mr.—um—Gabriel,” Mary said, much more tactfully than her son.  “This is Mary Winchester.  Both of my boys are here, too.”
me, you dick."  He pulled himself out of Castiel's hold, and Castiel spun around to scramble for him.  Thankfully, he didn't go back into the bar, but he was making for the Impala.
“Could you go get him?  I think we should all be here for this, in case he has any questions.”
Castiel had
“I dunno,” Dean said.  He lifted up the bottom of his shirt to wipe the sweat off his forehead with the fabric.  Right in front of Castiel.  Castiel saw a glimpse of Dean’s freckled torso, and the small, adorable pouch of his stomach.  He saw his belly button.  “Soon?”
Castiel laughed against his skin.  He dug his nose into Dean’s side, and pressed one last kiss on the dusting of freckles there before withdrawing.  “Not to mention the most ill advised,” he said, frowning now as he looked up to meet Dean’s eyes.  There was hardly any green left; his pupils swallowed it all up.  “I am a serial killer, after all.”
Dinner that night was a silent affair.  No one looked at Castiel directly for the rest of the day.
Belatedly, Castiel remembered Uriel’s presence.  He felt a weighted stare on his back.  He looked over guiltily, wondering if he could fix how this looked.  But it was too late.  He knew it was already over.
He shook himself, trying not to jump to conclusions.  Perhaps Dean had just excused himself for a moment.  Still, Castiel’s feet led him to the front door, eager to ensure the Impala was still in the driveway.
He breathed in, trying to muster his courage but only inhaling more fogged-over thoughts and sour air.  But he knew he couldn’t avoid this any longer.  It was time.
Dean was there, stirring something in a pot on the stove.  There was a plaid oven mitt on his left hand.  He glanced over his shoulder as they entered, his eyes immediately landing to Castiel.  They lingered for a moment before flickering to Mary, and his expression both softened and filled with protectiveness.
But it wasn’t true.  He didn’t want Mary to die.  Period.  He didn’t want Sam and Dean to lose her.  He didn’t want to lose any of them himself.  That was all there was to it.
“Yeah,
Castiel stared after him, chest pounding with a mixture of irritation, anger, and impatience.  And the overwhelming urge to go after him.
Castiel frowned, turning back around.  Behind him, he was aware of Sam stopping midway down the hall to look over his shoulder.  Even Dean’s face was lined with confusion.
Castiel pulled the front door closed behind him and descended the steps to the walkway.  He rubbed his chapped hands together, puffing hot breaths into them that did very little to combat the redness already overcoming his fingertips.  The air was a cloud in front of his lips before it faded to nothing.
He approached the bench, hovering next to it momentarily, his hands forming awkwardly into fists at his side.  Dean stared up at him wordlessly, and Castiel took that to mean it was okay for him to sit down.
He knew he should leave.  Dinner was over, and the Winchesters no doubt wanted to settle in for the night.  He wondered what they did when they were alone, in the uneventful moments of domestic life.  Did they watch movies together?  Did they talk and laugh and share memories?  Or did they go to their own separate corners for alone time?
He nodded.  He didn’t need comfort.  He was only there for her, because she had no one else.
After dinner, Mary bid them all goodnight and Sam took her upstairs to get her settled for bed.  Castiel watched them go until they were out of sight, and continued to stare after them for a long time, lost in thought.  This was the first, and likely the only, dinner he'd shared with the Winchesters, but it didn't feel that way.  He felt as though they'd done this hundreds of times.  It was as soothing and familiar as dinner with his parents and Anna had once been.
He didn’t remember drifting off.
When Dean finally did leave, Castiel hadn’t calmed down very much.  He didn’t know how to navigate saying goodnight to Dean, and the two of them ended up standing awkwardly in the doorway for a number of seconds before Dean rubbed at the back of his neck and said, “Well, ‘night.”  Castiel replayed the entire night in his head, and eventually fell asleep to Dean’s scent on his pillow.
Dean gestured to the coat rack next to the door.  “Wanna take a load off?”  His tone was too casual, and Castiel felt like there was a rock lodged in his throat.  He knew Dean wanted to speak with him privately, but this conversation would take much longer than they were given.
Castiel counted the seconds.  She must have been unconscious by now.
“It’s Gabriel,” Castiel said.  He put his hand on Dean’s chest and shoved him back, and Dean went still.
“Since your sister?” Dean asked knowingly.
Each of the Winchesters answered in the affirmative, their responses just a fraction out of sync with each other’s.  Sam was nodding his head.
“Yeah.”  There was a pause.  And then, “I’m gonna have to send someone out.”  Castiel’s stomach dropped.  Quickly, Gabriel added, “Just to make sure everything’s kosher.  I’m sure there’s nothing to worry about!  You’re a stellar Guide, Castiel.  This probably isn’t how it looks.  I tried to make your case to management but . . . you know how they are.  Sticklers.  Gotta make sure no one’s crossing any lines and all that.”
“Exactly.”
Castiel’s face dawned with realization.  “You want to be alone.”  He should have known that immediately when he saw Dean standing out in the cold.  He shouldn’t have come.
“What are you doing here?” he asked Dean, eyeing his sandwich.  “Besides eating lunch.”
Castiel opened his mouth, but nothing came out.  He wasn’t even sure what he wanted to say.  He hadn’t been expecting that.  It was probably a bad idea.  If the company found out about it, he certainly wouldn’t be able to stay on Mary’s case.  But, he had to admit, it would help him curb his spending.
It would be easier to hate Dean than to let him in.  Because once that door was open, Castiel didn’t know if he could shut it.  Not for Dean.
But, in typical Winchester fashion, no one spoke about it directly.  They preferred to bury their grief in morbid humor, which might not have been a bad thing.  It was better than Dean's usual surliness.
Mary half-turned around to look at him.  “Sweetie, come on.  There’s no harm in talking to him, right?  We decided that together.”
He was breathing out Dean’s name again and again.  His orgasm was building up inside of him, rising higher and higher as everything in him tensed up.  He jerked them again, harder now, and let he let out a loud, short sound, and he felt his body light up.
“Yeah, well, maybe we’re the idiots,” Dean said, in the hopeful way of non-believers who’d be happy to be proven wrong.  “Maybe we
“Hey, Mom.  How’d it go?” he said, leaving the wooden spoon sticking upright in whatever was in the pot as he came over to her, wiping his hand on his jeans.
“And what made you reach out to the Departure Network?”
"Get in."
you should—” Dean said, and at the same time Sam held up his palm and beseeched, “No.  Castiel—he won’t.  He won’t call the cops.”
When they got inside, Dean set his toolbox down in the entrance hall and led Castiel to the kitchen.  “Sit down,” he said once they were there, and it was more of an order than a polite suggestion.  Castiel did as he was told, taking a seat at the breakfast table.
Castiel looked up, meeting Dean’s curious gaze.  The pale morning sunlight made the green of his eyes stark, and flecks of gold swam inside them.  He was everything Castiel had ever wanted without knowing he’d wanted it.
“Dean,” he said again, closing his eyes so he wouldn’t have to see it when Dean said no.
He looked at Dean and raised his brow.  Dean pulled down the corners of his mouth and shrugged, approving of the fib.
It was a strange compliment, but Castiel had to fight back a smile all the same.  “Well, then,” he said, leaning against the tree next to Dean.  The wood creaked, and it sounded hollow inside, likely eaten by bugs.  Still, it held steady.  “I’m happy to not count.”
“What’s he saying?” Dean whispered, so low he was practically only mouthing the words.  Castiel waved him away, silently telling him to shut up.  He didn’t need Gabriel to change his mind.
"Fuck you."  Dean tried to get away again, so Castiel wrapped his arms around him once more.  But Dean must have found some of his strength because it was more difficult this time, and Castiel had to plant his leg between Dean's as they struggled.  Dean's hipbone kept rutting against his, and he imagined he wouldn’t have minded that so much had it been happening under different circumstances.
“No.  Was something wrong with the paperwork?” Castiel asked.  Gabriel usually didn’t call after Castiel had finished up with a patient.  In fact, he never called unless he had another assignment for Castiel.
“Mary,” Castiel corrected.
Dean held out a fork, and their fingers brushed slightly as Castiel took it from him.  Just when Castiel's heart rate had settled, too.  Why was this so stressful?
“Sam and Mom may buy into this whole shtick, but me?  I ain’t convinced.  So stay outta my head, and stay the hell away from me!”
, right?”
He was in the park, strolling down the winding walkway with his hands shoved into his coat pockets to keep them from chapping against the wind chill.  His nose was already numb and, he was certain, a shade of red that resembled the dried leaves crunching underfoot.  But it was nice.  Going for a walk always cleared his mind, as if he were walking away from his troubles instead of carrying them around with him.
“C’mon, man,” he whined, and might have been the most arousing thing he’d done so far.  Castiel withdrew his hand, mostly just to hear Dean whine again, and ran it up Dean’s bare chest.  When Dean’s eyes opened again, they locked onto his right away, as if their gazes were attracted by some magnetic pull.  Like a compass pointing north.
They were both silent for a long time, Dean thinking and Castiel not knowing what to say to make him stop.  And then Dean said softly, "You, uh—really believe in what you're doing, huh?"
Castiel didn’t know how to say he’d do anything Dean asked of him.  He simply nodded.
Castiel deepened the kiss—and then his phone on the nightstand started to ring.  He gasped and ripped himself away.  There could only be one person calling him, and it could only be about one thing.  He looked over his shoulder at the lit up screen.  His breath was coming out choppily and adrenaline rushed through his ears.  He had no idea if that was from kissing Dean or from the prospect of the phone call.
"Yeah?  Where you've been going?" Dean asked, sponging down the last plate before handing it to Castiel.  It dripped a little onto Castiel's shoes, but he didn't complain.  He realized he'd never stood this close to Dean before.  He smelled nice—like motor oil and something musky.  Castiel never thought he'd describe motor oil as a pleasant scent, but it was on Dean.
“But you just get to walk away after this!  You just get to fuckin’ walk away!  No funeral, no nothing.  No stupid fruitcakes and condolences baskets or whatever.  Me and Sammy are the ones who after to watch her die!  And we have to live with that when she’s gone and you got
Castiel blinked, desperately trying to forget what he’d seen.  He turned his face down and to the side, and decided to admire the car instead.  “This is a very nice car.”
Castiel frowned, more taken aback than anything.  “Dean cooks?”
“You didn’t need to!” Dean yelled, baring his teeth, suddenly quick to anger.  Nearby, a strolling couple turned their heads toward the sound, and quickly walked away.
“Any siblings?” she asked.
Next to Castiel, Mary asked, “Who?”  Now that she wasn’t moving, she’d turned her oxygen tank off and the clear plastic cord no longer hindered her.
For years, death had followed him as if he were the Grim Reaper.  Now that he was seeing the aftermath, all he could do was whisper a choked, “I’m a friend of her son’s.”  Sooner than he thought, his answer became, “We were friends.”
After Dean was done teasing him, he climbed back up Castiel’s body and laid more sweet kisses onto him.  Castiel tickled the tips of his fingers up and down Dean’s spine, and then he kicked his leg around Dean and flipped them.
But it was always possible.
"So, what do we do?" Dean asked.
Dean shook his head, practically snarling.  “You mean throw in the towel?  Roll over and die without a fight?”
"We're leaving," Castiel told him, his tone leaving no room for debate; but, somehow, Dean argued anyway.
“Tufts,” Dean supplied.
The question struck him.  He hadn't expected it from Dean.  "Do you?"
He didn't know why he was giving so much detail.  It was unlikely such names meant anything to Dean.
“Beth Whitshire.”
Uriel turned, his smile now gone.  “I understand we have an appointment with the Winchesters this morning?”
Perhaps all of it.  His entire life.
Castiel nodded, both relieved and disappointed, because Dean was giving him an out.  Dean was letting it slide, and Castiel should have been nothing but grateful.  But he wanted to kiss Dean again so badly.
There was a bow to his legs, Castiel noticed, even though he tried not to.  He focused on Mary and Sam and opened the file folder.
Castiel scooted himself a little further up Dean’s body and lined up their dicks.  He wrapped his hand around both of them, and Dean gave a sort of strangled sound before placing one of his large hands over Castiel’s.  They moved as one, holding themselves together in their fists as they jerked each other.
Dean must have known he’d plucked a cord, because he dipped his head to fish for Castiel’s eyes, and he stepped in closer.  “Cas?”  He licked his lips.  “You can’t leave, alright?  I’m not letting you.  They’re not just taking you away and sending in somebody else.  I’ll tell the new guy to go fuck himself.”
Castiel cast his gaze down at his blanket-clad lap.  He didn’t think he’d be able to sleep very much until he knew his fate.  “Yeah,” he said simply.
There was unease in their eyes when they looked at him—and he knew it wasn’t solely his fault.  Every day, Mary’s health continued to decline.  But it felt like his fault nonetheless.
He breathed out.
Castiel wasn’t even aware that he’d fallen asleep.  He’d been watching the news on the static-prone television of his motel room, and the next thing he knew he was startling awake to see a Kimmel monologuing in front of a live audience.  He grunted and sat up from his slouch against the headboard of his bed, where he was propped up with his legs stretched out in front of him.  The room was dark but for the blue glow radiating from the television and the crack of yellow light streaming in from the bathroom.  He ran his hand down his face, and his first thought was to turn off the TV and go right back to bed.
“Did Sam offer you anything?  We can make you some coffee?  Maybe some tea?” she asked, and Castiel shook his head.
He sighed, knowing he should protest.  It shouldn’t have been this easy for her to convince him.  He squinted over at the front door, letting out an exhale.  A home cooked meal did sound nice.  And if Dean was cooking it . . .
Castiel pushed a tight smile.  "Fine," he said, and immediately shoved his hand into one of Dean's jacket pockets.  It was empty.
Castiel nodded dutifully and glanced around for a dishcloth.  There was one hanging off the bar on the oven, so he picked it up and brought it back over.  Dean handed him a plate, and Castiel offered him a small smile as he took it.  He hoped, foolishly, that Dean would smile back, like he did over the dinner table.  He couldn't stop picturing it, the twinkle in Dean's eyes and the rush of warmth it had sent through Castiel.  He wanted to make Dean smile like that again.  But Dean only looked back down at the dishes he was scrubbing.
When Mary reached for the tank, she didn’t pause before turning the gauge.  Castiel couldn’t look anymore.  He was aware of Mary holding out her hand blindly.  Sam took it, and Dean folded his hand over theirs.  His other one gripped Mary’s shoulder.  He looked down at the comforter, shoulders shaking silently.
Dean nodded and lingered for a moment longer before picking himself up from the floor.  He hovered close in case Mary needed him.
,” he breathed out, voice cracked.
“Good morning,” Castiel said, tilting his head slightly to give Dean more access.  Dean hummed as he trailed more kisses on Castiel’s skin.  He shifted slightly, aligning himself closer against Castiel’s body, and Castiel felt the press of Dean’s erection on the back of his thigh.
Mary’s words kept rattling around his skull.  It sounded like she was giving her blessing.
?  Really?  Not even just garden-variety
The Impala was parked toward the back of the lot, where grass began to poke out of the loose gravel, carefully parked away from the other cars to avoid bumps and scratches.  Castiel was simultaneously relieved and annoyed.  Relieved, because Dean was there, and he was likely fine.  Annoyed, because Dean was not at the hospital where he was supposed to be and Castiel had to go looking for him while the clock neared midnight, which was decidedly not part of his job description.
Mildred Baker’s eyes were on the opaque plastic hood folded next to her on her bed, the bright pink and yellow floral pattern of her comforter popping in the setting sun streaming through the west-facing window of her room.  She had wanted to do this at sunset, as she had told Castiel on their very first meeting six weeks prior.  She said it was her favorite time of the day; that she even paid extra in her rent at the senior living facility to get a unit on this side of the complex.
“Isn’t that what people are supposed to say?” Dean asked, voice dripping with cynicism.  “She’s in a better place?”
Mary said, “Well, it’s nice you decided to stay so close to your parents.”
He rolled onto his side and sidled up against Dean’s ribs.
The bartender came over with a bottle of whiskey, about to top of Dean's drink.  Castiel snatched the glass away.  "Close his tab."
He didn’t know if Dean would, especially when Dean would continuously meet his eyes across the room, holding his stare.  Castiel supposed it was better than quickly averting his eyes, but he still wondered what Dean saw when he looked at him.  A friend, a lover, or a reminder of his mother’s death.
"Well, I . . ." Cas began, inching toward the general direction of the front door.  "I should probably—"
"Ella Fitzgerald," he decided.  "Or, since she's deceased, the closest I can get to her."
"You can pick your car up in the morning when you're sober."
“Are you aware that, while I will guide you in obtaining the materials needed for your departure, I, nor anyone else, will be able to initiate or aid you in your departure?”
He mostly stuck to a secluded corner, or he took Jess’ example of cleaning up where he could to take the burden off Sam and Dean.  He watched as the brothers went from person to person.  Sam usually stuck around longer, always nodding and listening attentively, always gracious with the kind words despite having heard them in similar variations all day.  Castiel’s eyes normally followed Dean.  Dean, who gave a few words in reply—a “thank you,” a “thanks for coming”—to each person before moving on.  Dean, whose eyes remained distant and out of focus.  Dean, who hadn’t so much as feigned a smile all day.
He wanted to touch Dean.  He wanted to bring him pleasure instead of pain—for once.
He didn’t answer, and instead waited for Gabriel to continue.
“I’m recommending that you’re taken off Mary Winchester’s case,” Uriel told him.  Castiel let that wash over him.  It wasn’t a surprise, but hearing the confirmation caused the air to quake around him.  He nodded.  “It’s for the best, Castiel,” Uriel then said.  Castiel wasn’t so certain he agreed.
When everyone took their seats for the service, both of the brothers said a few words honoring their mother’s memory.  Castiel was seated in the front row, the same pressure as before welling in his heart; but he didn’t think he would cry again.  He couldn’t.  Dean needed him.  That much was clear when, after he’d finished speaking, Dean sat back down beside him and promptly slid his hand into Castiel’s lacing their fingers, holding tight.
He'd gotten the approval that morning, but something inside of him wanted to ignore it.  He kept telling himself he would inform the Winchesters right away—after he filled out some paperwork that he needed to get done, and then after he mailed in his rent check to his landlord in Boston.  After he paid some bills online.  And then he needed lunch and a coffee.  And then maybe the cancer would go away and Mary could stay alive to be with her sons.
.  He paused and rephrased, "Whatever I suggest, he seems to do the exact opposite."
“Thanks for the, uh—for the ride,” Dean said awkwardly, and the tips of his ears were flushed pink in the glow of the streetlamp.  It was adorable, and Castiel errantly wondered what other parts of him were flushed.
So, too, did the clicking of the pipes in the walls as the heat kicked on in the absence of all sound.  The light from the streetlamps streamed through the window, casting the stretching shadow of the dying tree in the front yard on the floor.  The room seemed different in the darkness, in the quiet.
But that didn’t matter.  The simple possibility of it was enough to break the tension in Castiel’s chest.  Or maybe that was Dean’s touch.
Dean’s hand was in his.  Dean had hardly let go of it since they’d sat down, and Castiel allowed him to hold on for as long as he needed.  He did his best to stay silent, mostly because he didn’t know what to say.  He thought back to the stuffy halls and stale coffee of Anna’s hospital ward.  He tried to recall what small comfort, what string of words he’d longed for.  But his mind came up empty.  There was nothing to say.
Mary looked back out the window.  "We lost their father eleven years ago," she said, seemingly out of the blue.  Her hand lifted, fingers playing with the ring dangling from her necklace.  Castiel had wondered what happened to the man in the photographs scattered about the Winchester home.  He made it a point not to ask, but Mary was offering the information.  It was okay if she gave it freely.
“Hi, Castiel.  Sorry we’re late,” Sam added.
“Yeah, hey!” Dean said, all smiles.  He joked, “It’ll be like a sleepover.  We can braid Sam’s hair.”
"Fine, I won't."
But something had woken him up.  His cell phone was on the bed next to him, its screen alight as it chirped for his attention.  He looked down at the caller ID.
Dean’s expression broke out into a blinding smile—beautiful and radiant, his entire self shining with it.  Castiel didn’t know why it made him bashful, but he was suddenly shy as he tried to return the smile.  He looked at Dean’s flushed pink chest, at his broad shoulders and smattering of freckles, at the place where Dean was sitting on him.  This must have been what attachment felt like.  This must have been what it felt like to want to dig your claws into something and never let it go.
Castiel told himself it was a normal question.  He’d answered it hundreds of times.  He recited, “The patient orders a plastic hood and a tank of nitrogen gas.  Once the hood is placed over the patient’s head and the gas is turned on, the patient becomes unconscious with thirty to sixty seconds.  In twenty to thirty minutes, the patient passes away.  It’s painless and completely humane.”
Dean nodded, like he’d expected to Castiel to already have the information.  “That’s one way to put it.  It was a long time ago,” he said, but the tone of his voice revealed a different attitude.  Castiel wondered if this could help Dean open up about his mother’s departure.
“Are there any other questions?” Castiel asked, eager to get back on track.
He didn’t necessarily mean that.  The nurses would be making their rounds in an hour, and one would knock on Ms. Baker’s door to provide her medications.  Castiel needed to be gone by then.
Dean nodded, seeming to agree.  "Yeah.  Yeah, okay."
“I’m required to take all threats of contacting the authorities seriously,” Castiel told him, almost apologetically.  He didn’t want to leave.  He wanted to help Mary.
Uriel flashed him another smile—smug and teasing—and withdrew his hands.
“Yeah, ‘cause he kept putting me in the back of every scene!”
This was good.  It had taken a while, but Dean was finally being honest with himself.  He didn’t want to lose another parent.  That was more than understandable.
The first bar Castiel went to was a rundown sort of place built out of slated wood, seemingly something of a relic of a time long past.  It loomed on the gravel lot, scattered with pickup trucks and cars parked at haphazard angles, as a shadow in the night.  Neon beer signs buzzed from the bar’s windows, painting the night in their various glows of color.
This was excruciating.
He kept staring at the door, having completely forgotten any basic motor functions.
Dean rolled his eyes.  “Yeah.  She said he’d gone out to LA to make it as a big time director.”
Castiel squinted at him.  He hadn’t expected such a reaction from Dean.  He was clearly passionate about his car; usually, people reacted more positively when such things were complimented.  Maybe it was Castiel himself who was setting Dean on edge.  “Mr. Winchester, if you’d rather I wait in my vehicle for your mother and brother to return, I’d be happy to do that.”
It took him a moment to realize Dean was clearing off the table.  When he did, Castiel turned to him, watching him move around the kitchen.  He cut up the rest of the roast and placed it in a container along with the onions.  He took another one out for the mashed potatoes, and stacked them one of top of each other in the crowded fridge.  He put the dishes in the sink and ran the water, getting to work.  His back was turned to Castiel most of the time, and when it wasn't, he didn't look up.  He was generally ignoring Castiel's presence, but it didn't feel rude or awkward.  It felt comfortable in a way.  Castiel wondered if Dean felt the same.  He was almost positive Dean knew he was being watched, but he didn't say anything about it and Castiel didn't look away.
Castiel glanced up, letting Uriel’s judgement hang in the air.
Then, he brought his gaze up from where the phone was situated on the coffee table of the Winchesters’ living room.  He was sitting in the chair, leaning forward.  Dean was perched on the arm of the chair, his side brushing up against Castiel’s every time one of them moved.  Mary and Sam were across from them on the couch.
Castiel swallowed, not knowing how to answer.
He found the corners of his mouth tugging upward.  “Your secret’s save with me.”
And, eventually, Castiel forgot that he wasn't supposed to be doing this.  He forgot he was getting too involved.  He forgot that he wasn't supposed to hold any fondness toward the people in his care.
Dean said his name, his fists tightening, digging into Castiel’s skin.  And then he locked up, too; and Castiel’s hand was suddenly warm and sticky, and he could feel it on his chest, too, but he didn’t care.  Because Dean’s mouth was parted in a silent shout and his eyes were skewed shut and he looked so beautiful and sexed out and there was come on his stomach that Castiel didn’t know whether it was Dean’s or his own.
“Thank
Dean must have come to a similar conclusion at the exact same moment, because they both froze against each other.  And then Dean swiftly pulled away.  He turned his face down and away as if he were ashamed, and Castiel couldn’t help the sting of rejection he felt at that, even though he had no right to feel it.
He couldn’t dwell on that that.
He had to drive Dean home.  That was at least a fifteen-minute car ride, and it was bound to be the most awkward fifteen minutes of his life.  He thought he should apologize again, but he didn’t know if that would change Dean’s mind about forgetting what happened.
"Hey, why can't I back you up?"
Of course, Dean wouldn’t understand.  But there was no time to explain.  Castiel placed his suitcase on the floor and took off his coat.  He hung it on the rack, saying, “Dean, if Uriel’s evaluation isn’t in my favor, I could be taken—”
Sam looked up again, pushing his emotion to the side.  "Now's not really a good time," he said.  "She isn't home.  She's . . ." He swallowed and shook his head once.  "I think she's been exerting herself a little too much.  She came down with a cold a couple days ago and it turned into pneumonia.  She's in the hospital."  He lifted his arm a little to indicate the care bag.  "I'm headed back over there now."
Castiel shot the man a withering look, remembering that he wasn't the one to be angry with.  "Please," he tried.
Eventually, he became too exhausted to keep himself upright.  He slid off Dean and laid down at his side, and he grinned up at the ugly stucco ceiling.  Dean’s breathing still hadn’t evened out when he let out a chuckle.  The laugh was infectious, and Castiel didn’t even know what the joke was.
The evening air of Lawrence was crisp and clear, and a lot more breathable than what he was used to in the city.  It wasn’t even nine o’clock yet but, as he walked through town, he noticed the majority of the shops were already closed for the night.  The bars and restaurants, as well as the supermarket, were open, their interior lighting spilling out through the windows and revealing the people inside as they shopped and drank and laughed.
“You shouldn’t have to,” Mary said at the same time.  Then, her eyes lit up with an idea.  “Hey, why don’t you stay with us until we hear back?”
But that didn’t matter.  Castiel didn’t want to leave them, but none of it was his decision.  He pressed his lips together and shook his head.  “Dean.  I’m sorry.  If you reject your next Guide, the organization will withdraw your mother’s application.  She’ll be on her own.”
to get this attached to one of the patients.”
After dinner, they went into the living room to watch
He was always met with, “No, don’t worry about it.”  Or, “You’re a guest here.”  Or, “It’ll just be easier if I do it.”
“I am.”
Dean laughed, but it was a humorless thing.  “I don’t need a shrink, pal.  And I don’t need a brochure.  You do realize that what you’re doing is
“Oh,” Mary said, seeming a little relieved.  “Well, that doesn’t sound so—”
At the same time that Castiel scolded Dean, Sam let out an aborted sound of protest.  He gave his brother another warning glare before leaning in closer over the phone.  “Gabriel, hi.  Sam Winchester.  Excuse my brother.”  Dean rolled his eyes.  “Quick question: if we request that Castiel stay on as my mom’s Guide, is there any chance that’ll get her case thrown out?”
“No,” Castiel agreed, and maybe he should have left it at that.  Maybe he should have let Dean believe he’d been speaking in general terms.  But he said, “But I meant
Castiel reminded himself that he shouldn’t get involved in family matters.
Castiel tried to talk to himself out of it.  They were likely just being polite, anyway.  He attempted to give them an out: “I couldn’t impose.”
“About what made you choose this job.”
Over Mary's shoulder, he lifted his eyes to find Sam's brow lined with a kind of sadness as he watched his mother while she couldn't see him.  His gaze then found Dean, who was looking on with a soft expression that Castiel couldn't quite interpret.
“Kitchen,” Sam whispered, as if it was some kind of secret.
Dean’s expression melted into concern.  “Cas?”
“Can I ask you a question?” he said, turning back to Dean.
They’d been at the hospital for three hours.  Mary’s condition was stable.  Her hemoptysis had been caused by a ruptured blood vessel, which was far less severe than what any of them had expected.  She would be kept for observation and was put on coagulants.  Despite the doctor’s assurances, a stifling pressure had moved inside the room as Mary slept.  They all knew it was only a matter of time.
They waited together.  Dean’s hold never wavered, not even when, twenty-five minutes later, Castiel checked Mary’s pulse and found there wasn’t one.  He felt his own pulse stutter.
The plans were laid out for Sam and Dean, so they'd know what to do when the time came.  None of them would be shared with a funeral director until after Mary had passed, because they decided planning the event with her still alive was too suspect toward her departure.  Castiel appreciated their discretion, although he assured them that, in the case of terminal illnesses, it wasn't necessarily unheard of for a person to start planning their funeral.  He'd seen many of his patients do it—he'd just never gotten involved.  He never even attended the funeral.
Dean’s lips were leaving hot trails of saliva on the inside of Castiel’s thighs; and Castiel nearly arched up when Dean mouthed at his dick through his boxers.  A loud “ah” sound bounced back to him before he’d even realized he emitted it, and Dean continued on until Castiel was aching and circling his hips slowly.
"I stand by Phil Collins."
Castiel looked back at Mary.  “How are you feeling today?”  It wasn’t uncommon for candidates to have second thoughts on the day following the interview, especially after a scheduled doctor’s appointment.  Depending on what happened at the hospital, some candidates were given renewed hope.
“Fuck, Cas.  I’m gonna—Damn it,” Dean cursed and moaned.
When the call ended, Dean drew his hand away.  Castiel tried not to feel mournful for that.  With any luck, there would be more of that in the future.
When the back of his knees hit the mattress, he broke the kiss, and he sat down on the edge of the bed while catching his breath.  Dean took the opportunity to take his t-shirt off, revealing his firm chest and the slight softness of his belly.  Castiel felt himself grinning at the sight of it.  Dean had a tattoo on his chest, a strange five-point star in a circle, and Castiel thought he saw something similar in the Winchester house.  He wanted to ask him what it meant, but now wasn’t the time.
“It’s okay,” Mary was telling them before they pulled away.  She touched her hands to their cheeks, turning to Dean first.  “Dean,” she said, and the name was full of pride and love—and Castiel only knew that because he felt the exact same way.  Mary looked at Sam as if she were still seeing that infant in the old photograph in Dean’s box.  “Sam.”  And then, “I love you both.”
Castiel called him back, listening to the line ring as he locked the door behind him and shrugged out of his coat.  Just when he expected the call to go to voicemail, Gabriel’s voice came through: “Castiel, hey.”
He imagined this is what it felt like: dying.
"Yeah," Dean said again.  He turned around slowly, walking toward the exit of the living room.  Wordlessly, Castiel followed him.
“And it couldn’t hurt to send over a letter from the three of you saying why you want Castiel to stay on,” Gabriel advised.  “Not sure what good it’ll do, but it can’t hurt.”  He didn’t have to do that—give them pointers.  Castiel was grateful.  He squeezed Dean’s hand back.
Castiel didn’t know how to say no to him.  Maybe it wasn’t in his best interest, but he sat back down.  Mary and Sam seemed to relax, but Dean was still primed for attack.
Castiel blinked, wondering if this were a social call.  Gabriel always did like to chat, but the pleasantries were usually over with by that point of the call.  “Um.  It’s . . . temperate.”
“Hi,” Mary said again before getting down to business.  “Look, Castiel told us you took him off my case.  We’re calling because we’re hoping you’ll change your mind.”
There was a pause between them, and then Sam stood up from his chair.  “Anyway, I don’t wanna keep you.  Thanks again for swinging by.”  He placed one hand in the back pocket of his jeans, and held the other out to Castiel.
He wiped Dean’s stomach off with the sheet.  It wasn’t perfect, and it smeared the come around more than anything else, but it would have to do.
"Where are your keys?" he asked impatiently.  He opened Dean's jacket and found a few breast pockets inside.
your problem, anyway?” he continued on, barely thinking about the words leaving his mouth.  He would probably regret them later.  They were unprofessional, and Dean could have him reported to his superiors.  He could have Castiel fired.  Worse than that, if Dean got mad enough, he could call the police.
"Because that's what I want, that's why."
Still, Castiel’s nerves were fried.  He felt as if he’d just been caught red handed and was awaiting trial.
Castiel felt his expression slacken as it dawned on him what Dean had meant.
Gabriel launched right into it: “You know bringing the whole family in on this to gang up on me isn’t helping your case, right?”
Mary bit down on her lips, visibly considering whether or not she should say anything, but she didn’t need to.  Castiel knew the answer.  “No.”
He stretched out his fingers haltingly toward the phone, knowing it should pick it up before it stopped ringing.  He forced himself to do just that, and his voice sounded raspy and shaky to his own ears when he said into the receiver, “Sam?”
He heard Sam blow out his cheeks.  “Yeah, if you can.  Just like, get him home—or at least take his keys off him.  He’s probably at one of two bars.  I can text you’re their addresses?”
Everything kept dying on him.
Castiel had been so wrapped up in his own issues—his job, his lifestyle, his transient ways, his apparent inability to want to get close to anyone—that he hadn't even considered Dean's own reasons.  It would be a mistake.  Dean would always remember Castiel as the man who helped his mother die.  There couldn't be room for happiness there.  It would be too greatly overshadowed.
Castiel sucked in a breath.  His resolve faltered momentarily before he straightened his posture again and nodded once.  "Give Mary my best," he said, forcing calm.  "Let me know when we're able to proceed."
Dean ran his hand over his mouth.  “Yeah, maybe,” he allowed, but he clearly didn’t believe it.  He cleared his throat, trying to regain his composure.  He said, “Anyway.  The car was totaled after that, all bent out of shape.  But I fixed her right up—good as new.  Better than new.  Just like Dad taught me.”
“We don’t want some soulless asshole taking over.  Mom’s comfortable with you.  You know her—”
Castiel nodded.  “He thinks I’m becoming attached to your family.”  He was right.  Castiel was far past attached.
“Are you really
“What if I don’t?  What if there really is nothing?”
The next week and a half was dedicated to filing Mary's living will with the state.  Sam had drafted up the document and walked her through the options.  Castiel had done this enough times to offer his own guidance, but Sam knew her better and was therefore more equipped at advising his mother.  Most of the sessions were at the Winchesters' house, and Dean was never there for them.  He was working, Mary said, and Castiel tried not to think about his absence.  He would be a looming, dark presence in the background, constantly hovering over Castiel's shoulder and questioning his every move, frequently aloud.  Castiel thought he'd been overly aware of Dean's presence while he was there, and this would be a reprieve; however, he was even more aware of the empty space Dean left behind.
He didn’t trust himself to speak.  He reminded himself that this was her decision, and it was the right one.  He believed that, even if it was hard to do so at the moment.
Castiel nodded.  “My parents were the same.  Listening to them, I sometimes thought prayer was the best medicine.  But it wasn’t.”  He remembered watching them in the chapel of Anna’s hospital.  He’d been right beside them, kneeling, begging for a miracle.  “I’m not certain I believe anymore.”
If he couldn’t ask Mary what their significance was, perhaps Dean could give him an answer.
Sam was sitting beside Mary, his hand in hers and red rimming his eyes.  Dean was perched on the corner of the bed’s end board, eyes fixed on his mother and expression drawn.  Castiel was standing next to the bed, fisting his hands tightly at his sides to keep them from reaching out.
There was a moment where they stood silently, just staring at each other, neither of them moving.  Castiel imagined rushing forward and taking Dean in his arms.  Nothing would make him happier.
Castiel didn’t stop to question it.  He placed the phone back down and did as he was told.  “Everyone can hear you.”
There was an exhale over the line, like he didn’t much appreciate being ambushed.  “Hi, Ms. Winchester.”
Dean was staring at him again, a mixture of shock and sympathy on his face.
Castiel hadn’t meant to upset him.  It seemed that was all Castiel made him feel, besides anger.  After a moment, Dean ate the last bite of his food and brushed his large hands together to get rid of the crumbs.
Heartbreak could not be a part of the job.
Gabriel’s sigh was tinny over the line.  “Look, Castiel, I’ll level with you.  If this were up to me, I’d let it go.  You know that!  But a few people up the chain have . . . raised some eyebrows.”
And Castiel didn’t understand.  He hadn’t done anything.
Castiel swallowed.  It was more difficult to do than it should have been.
“Long?” Castiel echoed tonelessly.
Castiel told himself that heartbreak wasn’t a part of the job.  From the moment he met Ms. Baker, he knew how their relationship would end.  Like this.  Just like all the others.  He’d traveled across the country, to the sick and the dying, to assist them in taking their own lives before their illnesses consumed them.  And he believed he was doing the right thing, despite the law, despite the run-ins he’s had with it.  But he couldn’t afford attachment.  Steeling himself was the only option.  It was for the best.
Dean blinked, and Castiel didn’t know whether he was denying it or blaming himself.  He said, “So, why’s that such a bad thing?”
impossible,” Dean slurred back mulishly.
“It’s good enough.”
Castiel thought about the night before.  He thought about how badly he’d wanted to close the space between himself and Dean on the bed, about how much he’d wanted to kiss Dean goodnight in the doorway.
“I understand,” he said.  “Thank you, Gabriel.”
Dean looked at him.  Hardly.  It was a sideways glance out of the corners of his eyes, and his face was barely turned toward Castiel, but his eyes were skewed up in thought and his lips were puckered and he was, in fact, looking at him.  "The one on Monterey?"
“Sweet!  Knew you would.  Candidate’s name is Mary Winchester.  I’ll email you the file now.”  With a quick goodbye, the call ended, and barely a moment later, Castiel’s phone chimed with an email notification.
He swallowed past the lump in his throat and looked down at her upturned palm on the bed.  Her expression was fragile, but brave, and he knew he was meant to be the brave one.  Keeping his voice even and his composure intact, he said, “Of course,” and fit his hand into hers.  It was soft and delicate, but strong from years of work.
Castiel stepped a little further into the kitchen, flapping his arms out at his sides and hearing them smack back down against his trench coat.  “Let me know if I can make myself useful.”
And Dean did keep talking.  “Sammy and me were in the car, too, you know?”
Castiel kissed him again.
“I’m serious,” Mary went on.  “What d’you say, Castiel?  You can stay as long as you need.  The couch is yours.”  Her eyes flashed to Dean over Castiel’s shoulder.  She obviously meant to be subtle when she finished, “or whatever,” but even Castiel knew she’d failed miserably.
“It’s no problem.  I haven’t been here long,” Castiel assured them as Sam guided Mary into one of the chairs at the table across from him.  Dean placed the bag and tank beside her on the floor and crouched down to be level with her.
“Which got me detention for a week,” Dean supplied.
“Castiel?” Gabriel asked, sounding perplexed.  “You okay?  You sound a little out of breath.”
“Yes.”  Castiel had just finished dressing.  He was supposed to head over to the Winchesters’ house for a routine check-in before Sam and Dean left for work for the day.  “I’m leaving now.”
Keeping one hand on Dean’s chest, he rubbed small circles with the heel of his palm on the front of Dean’s shirt, and he brought the other up to cup around Dean’s neck.  Dean placed his other hand on Castiel’s hip, and his thumb smoothed gentle lines on the bone through the fabric of Castiel’s shirt.  Castiel heard a soft noise lift up from the back of his own throat, and he decided to let himself have this.
Dean puckered his lips in thought.  Another laugh burst out of him.  “Well, that’s good, ‘cause I was kinda thinking the rest of our lives.  I mean, you don’t have plans or anything, right?”
Dean hovered there for a while, and Castiel awkwardly fished for something to say.  He settled on, “Was there something you needed?”
“Well, currently, she’s in her bedroom.”
not to look at Castiel.  He busied himself stacking the sticky plates from the pie on the coffee table.
“Did you go to school in Boston, too?”
Dean let his hand fall back to his lap.  A muscle in his jaw leaped when he bit down hard.
Dean opened his mouth to say something flippant, like "sure thing" or maybe "anytime."  He closed it again, leaving it unspoken between them.  He wouldn't really mean it, anyway, Castiel knew.
“I’m fine, thank you.  If you don’t mind, I’d like to ask you a few questions as part of your application process.  It shouldn’t take long.  You’re encouraged to ask me any questions of your own, and I’d be happy to answer to the best of my ability.”  He wondered if he sounded rehearsed.  This was the opening he’d been trained to say and, after a few years of doing this, it was kind of automatic to him.
“Yeah, yeah,” Gabriel answered.  “Uh, just a quick thing.  Kinda awkward . . . It’s about your daily reports.”
Castiel nodded, getting the feeling he'd done something wrong.
“Good point.”
Dean leaned forward, folding his hands together between his knees and staring out at the street on the other side of the park.  “It happened in the Impala.”  He turned to Castiel, and must have seen the lack of recognition in his expression because he rolled his eyes.  Although, there was no heat behind it.  “My car.”
"'Night, Cas," Dean said, his head tipped slightly to the side, making it too easy for Castiel to lean in and press their mouths together.  He didn't, but he couldn't stop staring at Dean's lips.  They had their own gravitational pull.
“Cas, are you gonna be okay paying for that stuff on your own?” Sam asked once Castiel’s phone was back in his pocket.
“There really isn’t a particular major.  I actually studied political science.  I wanted to work in government, but . . .” This was the part that was too personal.  He couldn’t say it, even if his job allowed it.  “My priorities shifted,” he finished vaguely.
“Then, unless you have any questions for me, I’ll be going,” Castiel said.   He always hated this part of the interview.  He’d heard almost every question that could possibly be asked over the years with little variation, but he was still uncomfortable answering them.  It was one thing to stick to a script; it was another thing to look a person in the eyes and tell them how exactly they were going to die.
Castiel pursed his lips.  "Then don't come."
Sam blinked, a little thrown off and uneasy.  “Oh.  Uh, yeah.  Sure, Mom.”
Dean rolled his eyes, tried to side-step Castiel.  Castiel pounced.  He wrapped his arms around Dean's midsection and dug his heels into the gravel, hearing it scrap underfoot as Dean tried to push forward.  They ended up in a kind of embrace as Castiel pushed him away from the Impala's general direction and toward his own car.
Castiel nodded.  “Understand that this should be considered a last resort.  According to your file, you have stage four lung cancer, which was diagnosed in April of 2015.”
Cas felt his lips part slightly in shock.  He felt strangely numb, and heard himself say from somewhere far away, "Is she—?"
"Yeah, right."
Castiel didn’t let that deter him.  “You’re reckless and selfish and belligerent and, in all my years of doing this, you are the most unpleasurable person I have ever known.”
Again, she nodded.  “Yes.  I did radiation for a while, and it helped, but then it just came back.  And, well, I’ve been going to Missouri, too, of course.”
He pressed another kiss to the corner of Dean’s mouth, and Dean groaned and leaned into it.
Dean scoffed, a phlegmy, ugly sound.  Castiel decided to get to his troubles later.  First, he had to focus on Mary.
Castiel’s feet were weights.  He wanted to help, but the message wasn’t being sent to his limbs.  He stood stalk still, eyes glued on the Winchesters.  And a ridiculous thought struck him: he didn’t want Mary to die.
“You’re not,” Sam told him sincerely.  “We mean it, Cas.  You didn’t abandon us, so—we’re not gonna abandon you.”
She reached for the hood next to her, placing it on her lap for a few long seconds, and Castiel’s heartbeat sped up in the hopes that she would, in fact, opt out.  It came tumbling down when she unfolded the material and slipped it over her head.  Dean swallowed hard, visibly stopping himself from ripping it off.  Sam looked to his brother.
“Howdy-ho, Castiel!  You’re not on the road yet, are you?” Gabriel’s chipper voice came from the other end, and Castiel glanced at the clock just to make sure he had the time correct.  He did.  It was much too early for such energy.
“Just saying,” Mary told them, “if anything good came out of all this, it’s that you two met.”
“Yes.”
Like how maybe, just a little bit, Castiel was falling head over heels in love with Dean.  With all the Winchesters, really; but Dean was different.  Special.  Remarkable.
Castiel felt how wide his eyes had gotten.  A cold fist was clamped around his intestines, telling him this was a bad idea.  He shot a quick look at Dean, as if asking him what to do.  Dean nodded sternly.  Castiel managed to garner some strength from it.
“Okay, but you get how this looks, right?” Gabriel said.
“Right!  That was it,” Mary said.  “Are you from there originally?”
On the evening Mary signed her living will, Castiel drove her back to her house while Sam stayed behind to get the document notarized.  As he'd feared, she named Dean the executor—and it wasn't Castiel's business.  It truly wasn't.  He should stay out of it, because it was unlikely Mary would even need the will.  The chances of the departure processes failing were slim and he didn't anticipate Mary becoming comatose any time soon, so there was a good chance Dean wouldn't have to decide anything.
“Here,” he said, and lifted up the corner of the sheet beneath the comforter.  They were still facing the wrong way on the bed, their legs hanging off the side at their knees.  The linens had gotten messed up, and one corner of the sheet had been pulled out, probably when Castiel was fisting at them.  They were laying down on the comforter, and Castiel remembered his mother telling him that he should never do that because hotels didn’t wash them and they were full of germs.  He was never certain how much he believed that, but he made it rule not to use them, just in case.  But, at the moment, he didn’t care.
Castiel’s back was to him, but by some sixth sense, he was all too aware of Dean’s every movement—of the hurt in his eyes that he was desperately trying to shield.
But Castiel had to try.  He wanted to try.  For Dean.
"I should go," he whispered.
“Eyebrows,” Castiel intoned.
“Bullshit there isn’t!” Dean argued, because of course he would.  It wasn’t in Dean to give up.  “We can fight this, Cas.  Come on!  Would you look at me, damn it?”  He grabbed Castiel’s shoulder and wheeled him around suddenly.  Castiel didn’t even fight it.  He let Dean manhandle him.
Castiel ignored him and continued to push until they were near the passenger side door of his car.  He grabbed Dean's sleeve again, holding him tightly as if he were a recalcitrant child having a temper tantrum, and pulled the door open.
From the side, Castiel saw tears prickling in Dean’s eyes.  The tip of his nose was turning red and he sniffled sharply.
She also had stage six dementia, a living will, and no spouse or children.  She did have a niece in Omaha, but they had lost touch over a decade ago.  She had contacted the Departure Network eight weeks ago, and Castiel was assigned to her case.
The rest of the sentence got stuck in Castiel’s throat.  He swallowed, trying to unlodge it.
Castiel’s skin buzzed.  He shook his head.
Dean’s voice was thick from his drink and he took another sip as soon as he was finished speaking so that the tin can muffled the last of his words.  He didn’t offer Castiel a drink.  Perhaps his hospitality only went so far.
Castiel pressed his lips together and tightened his jaw.  Eventually, he said, "You're not nuts."
He tried to amend it.
Simmering, Castiel dropped his voice low.  "I understand you pain—and your anger.  But your mother is in the hospital and all you're doing is giving your brother more reason to worry with your irresponsibility.  What you're doing here won't solve your problems, Dean.  So, we're leaving.  Now."
“Whatever you’re all comfortable with,” Castiel told them, trying to give Sam an out.  But that was their personal business, and he wouldn’t intrude.  However, he couldn’t help but to voice one reservation: “But you do understand that, if Sam files your living will, he can’t be executor?  You’ll need to choose someone else to handle it.”
“Evaluate
“I’m here, Dean,” he said.
And that was that.  Castiel moved to the other side of the bed and sat down in the wooden chair beside her, taking care not to block her view of the sunset.  “Take as long as you need to begin.”
Dean's smile faded slowly.  His green eyes darted along Castiel's features.  "Right," he said, dragging the word out.  He sniffed and looked down at his crossed ankles.  Castiel immediately regretted saying anything.
In truth, Castiel didn’t know what was going to happen next.
Castiel didn’t have the right words before.  He didn’t know how to tell Dean that he was there for him, that he would always be there when Dean needed him.  He would stay—for as long as Dean wanted him.  He didn’t have the words to tell Dean that Castiel would always need him, would always want him.
“Oh,” he said again, pleasantly surprised, “Good morning.”
“What is your friend’s name?”
He chuckled dryly and shook his head.  “Dad wasn’t even supposed to be in the car.  I was supposed to be teaching Sam.  But he said I was too annoying.  ‘Cause, you know—car was gonna be mine one day.  I didn’t want him wrecking it.  So Dad came out and told me to get in the back.”  His expression twisted, and his eyes were far away but they were no doubt looking inward.  “I shoulda been the one in the front.”
He wanted to pull Dean closer, to kiss his cheeks where the tear had fallen and take away any pain and sadness that Dean had wrapped like a coil around his heart.  Because he didn’t deserve any of it.  He deserved his mother and father and his brother, for all of them to live to a ripe old age, unburdened by tragedy and untouched by illness.  He deserved happiness; and he didn’t deserve someone like Castiel coming into his life to create more pain.
Dean had picked up the pan he'd used to cook the roast.  It was covered in grease and a black burned substance that must have been difficult to get out, because he was scrubbing hard, putting his elbow into it.  The yellow sponge was getting stained brown.  Distractedly, he said, "Well, I'll have to take you for one sometime."
Castiel tilted his head to the side.  He wasn’t sure why, but his stomach clenched.  He waited for Gabriel to continue, but the line remained silent.  “Is there . . . something wrong with them?” he asked unsurely.  He didn’t think they were very different than his usual reports.  Perhaps they contained more detail, but that was only because the Winchesters preferred for him to be around during their planning.  There was more to report.
Castiel didn't follow sports very much, so he didn't respond.
His eyes flashed briefly upward, behind Mary and Sam, to catch Dean’s gaze in the doorway.  Dean was still looking at him sourly.
Mary didn't seem to understand, as if the reservation was completely unfounded.  "What do you mean?"
He was about to knock again when he heard a shuffling coming from inside.  Loud voices argued from within.  He recognized one of them as the man he’d just spoken to, and there was another male voice that wasn’t as deep, and then
When he got closer, Uriel stood up.  All he said, voice reproving, was, “Castiel.”
The phone line trilled, and for a heart-stopping moment, Castiel was sure Gabriel wouldn’t answer.
Castiel went cold.  This was it.  This was the end.  He kept his eyes on Dean, trying to ground himself, but that didn’t help because all he could think was,
“C’mon, Mom, let’s get you upstairs to bed,” Dean offered.  Mary gratefully accepted, and he helped her to her feet.  He picked up the oxygen tank and they shuffled out of the kitchen.  Before they left, Dean glanced over his shoulder, his eyes meeting Castiel and holding them until the wall obstructed their view of each other.
“Yeah, I got it.  Unless you wanna help—”
"He's great and you know it."
For good.
Dean stayed silent for a second, and then let out a sound and shook his head.  “Yeah, great answer.”
Castiel wrapped his hand around Dean, gentle and teasing, and stroked him.  He watched, enraptured, as Dean’s eyes slid closed and his lips parted distractedly.  Dean’s throat rippled every time he swallowed hard, and a line formed between his eyebrows as he concentrated.  He was filling out quickly in Castiel’s fist, and it didn’t take long for him to let out a frustrated sound and buck into the touch.
Dean didn’t look up.  “Yeah, come on in, Cas.”  His voice was scratched.
Castiel resolved he would keep his hands and emotions to himself that day.  He would remain level and professional.  He was certain the Winchesters would understand—if they even noticed the change in his demeanor.  Or maybe they wouldn’t.  Perhaps he should have warned them about Uriel’s arrival.  He knew he wasn’t supposed to, but it seemed the rules were forgotten where the Winchesters were concerned.  He should have told Dean last night.
He looked away, his eyes finding the empty space in the driveway again.  "Is Dean with her now?"
Sam was squinting at him thoughtfully, and Castiel was certain he could see right through him.  "I mean," he said, "it's Dean.  You know what he's like."
“I don’t have a choice,” Uriel told him, but at least he sounded sorry about it.  Maybe even a little part of Castiel understood.  “You know it’s not our place to get involved in the patients’ personal lives.”
Dean fit his hand under Castiel’s jaw and dragged him into a kiss.  Castiel went easily, his eyes still open, watching the way Dean’s lashes fanned on his cheeks.  Dean’s mouth tasted like whiskey and salt.
He steeled his expression and forced himself to look back at Sam, retroactively attempting to make his question seem polite instead of heartfelt.
He didn’t know how long he spent staring up at the ceiling before he heard footsteps on the stairs.
“You sure?  You want some water or anything?  I think we got some of that meatloaf from last night in the fridge.”
me,” Dean said, stomping after him.  “You know
Castiel almost couldn't believe what he was hearing, but he honestly should have expected it from the Winchesters.
“I’ll put in a request,” Gabriel corrected.  “And I’m gonna draft up a document to put this all in writing.  I’ll email it over.  Just fax the signed version back.”
"Mostly, the diner."
Uriel scoffed.  “You must know where this path leads.”
!"  He stepped further into Dean's personal space, their chests nearly touching.  He ignored the tense tingle on his skin in the proximity, and the way Dean was looking at him like he wanted nothing more than to tear into Castiel.
“What
Behind him, Dean grabbed the door gently by the wood.  He said, "Night, Cas."
Because, in a few weeks, she'd be dead.  Sam and Dean would move on with their lives.  And Castiel would return to Boston.
And maybe that would be for the best, he thought in a moment of weakness.
Three days went by and Castiel still hadn’t heard back from Gabriel.  No one spoke of it.  In fact, everyone seemed to do everything in their power to avoid the topic.  They went on with their days as normal, with their standard routines, and Castiel did all he could to not get in the way.  He felt he was even failing at that.  He offered his help with cleaning up after dinner, with helping Mary, even with going grocery shopping—just to get out of the house for a time.
Castiel nodded.
Castiel noticed Mary had spotted them.  She remained quiet, but her eyes kept flickering to their conjoined hands.  Castiel ducked his head as to not meet her eyes, the back of his neck heating up in embarrassment.  He cleared his throat and tried to focus on the task at hand.
Dean was staring down into the box, cradling its sides with both hands now.  He said, “You’re not here to tell me death isn’t the end or some shit, right?”
With slight frustration, Castiel wondered how Dean could have possibly interpreted that.
A week.  A month.  A year.
Castiel looked behind him at the armchair.  There wasn’t anywhere else to sit, and he never liked sitting so close to a candidate on their couch.  He preferred to put some space between himself and them, so he sat in the chair, perching himself on the edge and placing his briefcase on the coffee table.  He started pulling out Mary’s file.
He tried to rationalize it.
“And how—” Mary asked, stopping and starting again.  “How does it work?  The—well, how do I do it?”
“Are you of sound mind to make your own decisions?”
"Cool," Dean said, nodding.  "Go Sox."
Suddenly, the cold seemed very far away.  Castiel swallowed, unable to break eye contact.
"I understand," Castiel said, even though he didn't.  He wished he shared their confidence in Dean.
"I'm good, thanks."  He lifted up a finger to signal toward the bartender for one more.
“Have you tried chemotherapy?”
It was better this way.  He couldn't start something with Dean.  He was already too involved with the Winchesters as it were.  When it was over, he would have to go back to Boston or to his next job.  He would have to move on.  And so would Dean.  The memories from their time together would be depressing enough; he didn't want to make it more difficult for him to look back on them.  He wanted Dean to remember him with at least a tiny gossamer of fondness, as unlikely as it was.
,” Gabriel went on, catching his interest, “there’s a candidate in Denver who hasn’t been assigned a Guide yet.  You can take that job instead and get a big ol’ paycheck.  Or, well, your usual paycheck.”
Mildred Baker was a seventy-four year old woman, long retired from life as a traveling showgirl.  She had performed in every state in America, and many countries in Europe.  France was her favorite because she liked the chocolate there.  She was kind and warm and had a distinct flare that was so very hard to find in this world.
“Do you?” Uriel urged.  “Honestly, I’m surprised, Castiel.  I never thought you, out of anyone . . .”
He didn’t even have the keys in the ignition when he dropped his arms to his lap and glared at Dean in the shadows of the passenger seat.  “You’re impossible.”
Sam jerked his head back in surprise and blinked rapidly.  Castiel turned around on his heels and started down the walkway.  Behind him, he heard Sam say, "Uh—yeah, okay.  Sure."
“Squeaky clean as usual,” Gabriel told him.  “Hey, you weren’t an accountant in a past life, were you?  I feel like you’re too organized.”  Castiel opened his mouth, unsure how to answer, but Gabriel kept speaking.  “Any-who.  How’re you liking Kansas?”
Castiel sat beside him, the mattress dipping under his weight, gravity pulling him closer to Dean until their sides were touching.
Regardless, Castiel hadn’t been able to pay much attention to the movie.  He’d been far too wrapped up in watching Dean, his eyes alight as he recited the majority of the lines.  It should have been annoying.  Castiel found himself wanting to be invited to every Winchester Movie Night.
The kiss was at an awkward angle.  When it broke, Dean leaned away momentarily to set the shoebox on the floor.  The sheets of the bed rustled as he turned his body into Castiel.  They reached for each other, Dean’s hands on the back of Castiel’s neck, Castiel running his palms down Dean’s chest.
He nodded, taking a step backward to give her room.  “Take . . . take your time to begin.”  He wanted her to take years and years.
He hadn’t even known why he was crying.  It was for Mary, yes.  It was for Mildred Baker.  It was for all the people he’d watched die.  It was for Anna.
“I know you thought they could vouch for you,” Gabriel told him, “but I’m not really sure what to do here.  You’ve put me in kinda a tough spot.  And, honestly, Castiel?  I’m not sure it’s healthy for
Castiel put his notes down and closed the file folder.  “That will be all for the day.  I’ll send this information into my superiors.  But I will need a copy of your medical records in order to complete the application process.  Should you be approved, we can begin making arrangements.”
It occurred to him then that the Winchesters genuinely wanted him to stay.  He wasn’t quite sure what to do with that information.  But he knew he’d regret it if he backed down now.  He’d promised Dean he would fight.  He wasn’t about to break that promise.
Castiel dipped his head to the side in consideration, playing along.  He was leaning forward, elbows resting on his knees.  Sam was sitting on the floor, his long legs folded under him.  Dean and Mary were across from them on the couch.
Castiel blinked, his eyes adjusting.  “Hi.”
Dean brought his eyes up, more guarded than before.  "Why?  Don’t you believe in fate or something?"
want to help.  It was clear on his face, just as the firm set of purpose and determination was clear on Dean’s.
“Oh,” Castiel said, trying to knock himself out of his slump.  “Hello, Dean.”  He didn’t have an appointment with the Winchesters that day, and he really wasn’t in the mood to act professional.  But perhaps he didn’t need to.  Dean never seemed to appreciate it very much, anyway.
How many times Mary answered, “Yes, honey, I’m sure.”
“Looks a lot like giving up to me.”
Dean's gaze snagged on his, and it lingered for a moment before flickering down to his lips.  Castiel wondered if Dean was thinking about kissing him, too.
“Don’t you let them take you away.  Come on, Cas.  Fight ‘em with me.”
Castiel reached for his phone and checked the caller ID.  He was right.  It was Gabriel.  He picked up and held the phone to his ear.  “Gabriel.”  His voice sounded rough and breathy.  Damn it.  This probably wouldn’t help his case, but he doubted it would matter very much when Gabriel inevitably recommended he pack his bags.
“Ah, me and Sammy got those for Mom when she was first diagnosed,” he explained, dismissing it with a wave.  “Neither of us really thought they were gonna protect our family or . . . save her.”  His last words were whispered.  He looked down again, mouth pinching and twisting.
Castiel’s mouth hung open, but no sound came out.  He didn’t even know what he was expected to say.  His limbs hung heavy around him, feet glued to the floor.  And, despite that, there was a fluttering in his chest.  He looked at Dean, and Dean didn’t look back.  His head was bowed and turned away.
