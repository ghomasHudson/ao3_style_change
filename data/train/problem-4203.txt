He promised himself when he started therapy with Pam that he’d keep that beast leashed inside, because he doesn’t want it to escape and hurt any of his loved ones.  And he renews that oath now, because he wants to deserve the faith Castiel is showing him.
Cas’ response is immediate, equally hungry.  His lips part, and Dean takes advantage, slipping his tongue between them and seeking the heat inside.  The intimate contact rouses a deep and painful knot of longing deep inside Dean , and he presses for more.  Then Cas gently pushes him back onto the blankets, leaving the sweet, hot, masculine taste of him lingering on Dean’s tongue as he draws away.  His blue eyes are dark with arousal when their gazes meet again.
Castiel hesitates when his mother asks him if he’ll run things for a little while.  Jody had given him a few weeks leave, despite the fact that he hasn’t been working for her very long.  He’s trying to build a life there, and he doesn’t want to commit to anything in Boston that will take him away from that.  He hedges around an answer, saying he’ll keep an eye on things for a few days without making any solid promises.
“You can’t let your feelings for me dictate my life.”  When Dean keeps his head down and doesn’t say anything Castiel sighs.  He slides off the stool and turns away from the man who might love him too much for both of their good.  “I’m going to go read, or something,” he murmurs.
“Those people you killed in Tombstone…” a group of three, two beheaded and one exanguinated, “what were they?”
A bitter wind comes up, and Dean pulls his hat low over his face as he gazes into the distance.  Cas is resilient, and smart.  And Dean will continue to believe he’s alive until he finds proof otherwise.
“Ellie!” Amara exclaims from the doorway.  “What can you be thinking, having our guest change the baby?”  She quickly scoots between Castiel and Dean and takes the baby in her arms.  “It’s not a chore for a man,” she adds in a soft, breathy voice as she looks at Dean from beneath long lashes.  “I will take him, and then perhaps you would like to see our horses?”
Leaning against the counter as he dries his hands with a towel, Castiel tilts his head thoughtfully.  Then he smiles.  “I don’t have any Star Wars or Indiana Jones, but I’ve got Lord of the Rings or Doctor Sexy.  Are you in the mood for Middle Earth hotties, or cowboy boots and smut?”
Crinkles appear around Castiel’s eyes, and his lips curve up at the edges.  “I think I’d like that.”
“Dude, no.” Dean rolls his eyes and kicks harder at Sam’s foot.  “I’m trying to be the good guy here, okay?”
“Good timing, Sammy.”  Dean sets the frying pan back on the oven, flips off the heat, and picks up the plates before heading for the table tucked on the far side of the room.  He lifts the one that has more green dotting the eggs in invitation.  “Breakfast is served.”
“Oh god, let me at least get out of here first,” Jo says from nearby.  Tools clatter loudly, punctuating her protest.
“Holy shit, really?” Dean not only sounds excited, he looks excited.  “Dude, I’m in this book club that basically sticks to fantasy and sci-fi.  You should totally join us.”
Dean’s teeth clamp down over his bottom lip, and he nods.  He holds Castiel’s gaze with his own, silently begging for more.
Castiel takes the flashlight, and a shiver of awareness runs up his arm when his fingers brush Dean’s jaw.  By the way Dean looks at him, it’s obvious he noticed.  Ignoring the way his pulse rate picks up, Castiel directs the beam down toward Dean and Eileen’s hands.
“Stay here.”  It comes out harsher than he intends, but he only softens a little bit when hurt flashes in Cas’ eyes.  “I’ll get my horse.”
Since Castiel also sees no sign of a badge, he assumes the man must be a bounty hunter.  He’ll need to proceed with caution, or he’ll get himself and Dean both shot.  This man seems like the type to shoot first and collect rewards later.
A warning tingle in his fingertips makes him curl them tighter around his mug of sweetened lemon juice to keep from reaching out.
“Dean!” He slaps the outlaw in an attempt to rouse him, but there’s no response.  His hands run over Dean’s face, his chest, arms and hands.  Dean is cold, but no colder than Castiel.  Still there’s no telltale rise and fall of his chest.
Groaning, Dean lets his head drop forward to rest against Castiel’s.  “You heard that?” He laughs brokenly.  “Goddamn, it was a stupid thing to say.  I didn’t mean it, I just wanted to get Sam to quit sticking his nose in my business.”
“You still feel like shit.  Me too, man.” Dean barks a laugh that holds no humor.  “Look at us.  Aren’t we a couple of dumbasses.”
“Dude, nice.  What’s your favorite movie?” Dean finishes taping Castiel’s side and pats his knee.  “Put your foot up here.”
Castiel blinks a few times, and then he grins as well.  “There’s always phone calls.  I’m sure we can find a way to make them interesting…”
After dismissing Castiel, the man’s eyes had fastened on Dean’s back, but now they swing back, brimming with contempt.  “Dean Winchester is a wanted man, and I’m taking him in for the reward.”
Dean catches a movement out of the corner of his eye.  Very deliberately he doesn’t turn his attention toward it, hoping that it’s a rescue and not Martin coming to see if he can help.  He snorts.  “I prefer working with robotics.  Don’t have to maim or kill anyone for parts.”
In the almost three months they’ve been together they’ve learned enough to avoid most misunderstandings though.  And the ease with which their lives have settled in together is part of why Dean’s in such a good mood right now.  It’s Friday, and they’re going up to the hot springs after they’re both off work.  It’s the end of Castiel’s first week as deputy, and they’re going to celebrate.
And it’s a miracle that Castiel still wants to come back after the way Dean’s been acting, especially after he spent so long supporting Castiel’s ability to make decisions for himself.  When Sam had run off he’d been determined to never come back because he didn’t want to live under Dean’s thumb, and it had taken several years for Dean to rein in his mother-henning and for Sam to trust him not to return to his momzilla ways.  But Castiel still thinks of the bunker as home, still wants to return, still loves Dean, despite everything.
“Do you know where we are?” Castiel asks after wetting his mouth with barely a sip from the canteen.  It does very little to clear the gritty sand from his mouth, and doesn’t touch his growing thirst at all.
As he’s pulling out his keys to let himself into his condo, his phone rings.  He pulls it from his pocket, and grins at Dean’s picture on his screen.  He thumbs the answer icon and puts it up to his ear as he unlocks the door.  “Hello Dean.”
He catches Cas’ wide eyes with his own, and the Pinkerton nods as if he understands.  With Dean’s support he’s able to get his feet under him so he can attempt to crawl out of the water.
After a few shuddering breathes, Dean thinks his muscles are ready to cooperate with him again and he crawls up over Castiel’s body and kisses him.  He remembers as their lips touch that he just had a mouthful of jizz and hesitates, but Castiel grabs his head with both hands and pushes into the kiss, licking into Dean’s mouth as if chasing his own flavor.
Keeping up with Winchester, figuratively or otherwise, is like trying to keep up with a tornado.  Castiel’s anger over the previous subject shifts into impatient annoyance.
“Can I smell it first?” Castiel accepts the opened bottle when Dean hands it over and holds it up to his nose.  The same sweetness hits his senses and he closes his eyes to enjoy it more fully.  He sighs out, and takes one more whiff before handing it back to Dean.  “What do you normally use?”
Dean doesn’t make it easy for him, keeping his body still as Castiel strains for more.  “Tell me you want me, Cas,” he says as he begins to pepper kisses down Castiel’s stomach.
He was pissed--and he definitely thinks of it as past tense now--because he was scared.  But everything turned out okay, and it would be a dick move to yell at a man suffering what Dean’s going through now.  Accidental infection and miserable recovery are enough punishment.  There’s no need for Sam to dole out more.
“He didn’t say anything specifically,” Castiel says, grinning.  “But I could practically ‘see the wheels turning in his head’.”
Being alone with Castiel starts his brain down the path of all the things they could do in the time it takes Sam to get ready, so to distract himself, Dean grabs the phone he’d been setting up.
Before he can move away, Dean’s hands are on his shoulders.  “Is this about Amara?  Because nothing happened the other night.  I sent her away.”
And then there’s the other memories.  Of gentle hands on his skin, and in his hair.  A low voice reading an old Western novel out loud to him when he couldn’t go back to sleep despite his exhaustion.  Unblinking eyes watching him; concerned, without a hint of judgement.
Sam is the first to take a side tunnel.  Castiel and Dean watch for a few moments before continuing on.  When they reach the next split, Dean pulls Castiel to a halt by the sleeve.  His green eyes look nearly black in the dark tunnels, but they are very clearly full of worry.
There’s enough space at the end of the cot for Sam to sit, so he does, dropping his head back against the wall and resting a hand on Dean’s ankle.
“Fuck no,” Dean retorts with a small chuckle of his own.  “But I’ll pretend as hard as you need me to.”
Despite the futility of the motion, Castiel shifts his weight again.  Maybe it does help.  “I don’t want to sleep.”
While they’re talking, Dean feels a vibration against his leg where it’s pressed up against Castiel’s.  They shift apart enough for Castiel to fish his phone from his pocket and check the Caller ID.  Almost immediately he hits ignore and shoves the phone back in his pocket.
Castiel is about to decline her offer--the last thing he wants is to give them warning so they can turn tail and run again--but he’s distracted when Pamela closes the space between them.  He tenses, not really in the mood to tolerate more physical advances.  But she only loops an arm through his.
Sammy has been bugging him to ask Castiel to stick around for a while, but the request gets stuck in Dean’s throat every time he considers it.  How can he ask Castiel to stay?  Castiel has shit going on back home.  He doesn’t say anything about it, despite how much they talk every day, but Dean can read between the lines.
When he’s through, the sun is high in the sky.  His back throbs, but he refuses to stop until the task is done.  He drags Alfie’s body to the crudely dug grave and rolls him into it.  When freshly turned soil is mounded over the grave, he kneels down next to it.  Tears slip down his cheeks as he says a prayer for the lost boy.
When Castiel tries to extricate his hand Dean grips it tight, refusing to let him pull away.  “You are.  What you went through… what you’re still dealing with.  I know it’s not easy, man.  But you’re doing it.”
As Castiel lay in his blanket roll that first night, he listens closely to the night sounds until his nerves are raw, and his fingers ache from clutching the gun he kept under the edge of his blanket.
Besides, at some point he’ll need to stop being a coward and take his life in Boston out of its current holding pattern.  That means taking the trip, whether his condo is waiting for him or not.  He’s not quite ready, but he thinks he’s close.  He has enough clothing to survive another week or two, and then he’ll man up and go to Boston.
Following more slowly, Castiel watches Dean move around as he drains the last of his rootbeer and puts the bottle in a milk crate half full of other empty bottles.  He doesn’t look up as Castiel approaches, and his shoulders grow tighter.
The enormity of that understatement makes Castiel laugh, although it comes out more like a wheeze.  His mouth still burns, and his eyes won’t stop watering, but the laughter eases some of his discomfort.  “I think my teeth are going to melt,” he admits.
He catches Castiel’s smile just before he passes out of sight, and he carries a ball of warmth in his chest all the way to his room to drop off his stuff.  It doesn’t fade while he gathers some clean clothes to sleep in and heads to the showers.  When he steps under the hot spray the ball of warmth moves lower, turning into a low hum of arousal as he washes himself and remembers Castiel doing this for him when he couldn’t do it himself.
Together they watch, and together they move.  Dean’s hands clutch at Castiel’s arms, his shoulders, his hips, always moving.  Castiel keeps his hands and knees planted firmly against the mattress to give himself leverage.  They shift and rock together like they’re fucking, but without either penetrating the other.
Dean ignores the interruption.  “Next time we go out we’ll make sure to get you a proper wardrobe.  But for today, we’re going to work on your education.  I’m thinking we should start with Westerns…”
When Castiel agrees he holds up two fingers to Ellen, who responds by bringing them some drinks.  She brings over a couple glasses, one full of amber liquid and another one filled with a much darker beverage that she gives to Dean.  She insists Castiel try his and makes sure he likes it before she pats him on the arm with a motherly smile and heads back to the bar.
“I need to go back to Boston.” Castiel is breathless from running, and he has to pause to suck in several lungfuls of air.  By the time he’s ready to speak again, Dean is on his feet and standing in front of him, brow lowered in worry, and his hands come up to grip Castiel’s shoulders, grounding him.  “It’s my dad.  He’s in the hospital, and--” he breaks off again, and pushes his face against Dean’s chest, seeking comfort.  “Dean, I need to go.”
Since his brother isn’t in his bedroom, Sam has a few expectations of how he’ll find Dean and Castiel.  The best case scenario will involve everyone wearing clothes, and Dean cheeky with glee while he teases Sam with details he doesn’t want to know, and worst case will be the ultimate mental scarring of walking in on them loudly fucking.
Dean shrugs, but his gaze sweeps through the trees surrounding the meadow, alert for signs that they’re not alone.  “Hard to say. They could be miles away or close enough to know what happened. We should get out of here in case it’s the latter.”  He’s hopeful that the dead demon is just a straggler, but he’ll feel much better once they’re both back inside the protective wards of the ranch.
Kicking off his blanket only makes him more restless, and he thinks longingly of his memory foam mattress at home.  He would have been fine driving back tonight, but he really didn’t have a gooda good argument against staying when the rooms were free.  And not when Sam looked as rundown as Dean felt.
When the coughing subsides he wipes mud out of his lashes and looks around.  Rain still falls in solid sheets, but the thunderous pounding of the river has lessened to a dull roar.  His eyes land on Dean’s huddled shape several feet closer to the rushing water.
Sam’s lips thin into something close to a smile, but there’s a shadow of suspicion in his eyes.  “Do you need something from the city?”
apologizing when he knows Dean is deliberately trying to break him, he has no idea.  He tries to shift away, to stand under his own power, but his legs still refuse to cooperate.
Maybe he should start the caffeine infusion earlier.  So he’ll feel fortified enough to start a conversation one of these days instead of just exchanging a smile, a wave, and a quiet hello before they go their separate ways.  And he can finally get close enough to figure out the guy’s true eye color.  It would be worth getting up earlier.  He’s not a fan of mornings, but he’s a fan of hot potentially single guys.  He can make an exception.
“You never asked.  And my past lovers weren’t relevant because I was with you, and that was all that mattered to me at the time.”  When she still stares at him in bafflement, he adds, “I’m bisexual, Hannah.  I am attracted to both men, and women.  But I loved you, and you were the only person I wanted.”
Gabriel, and he tries not to be bitter that Sam has an easier time going to his boyfriend than coming to Dean.  He’s got his own (unhealthy) coping mechanisms, so it would be hypocritical to begrudge Sam his.
After criss crossing the trail several times, he’s sure there’s only one set of tracks following Cas.  They seem to be staying far enough behind Cas to avoid detection, probably waiting until he’s far enough from the ranch that there’s no chance of help arriving on time.
Samuel gives him a surprisingly boyish grin.  He’d also found time to shave since they last met, and without the beard, Castiel realizes they’re about the same age.  Samuel claps him on the shoulder. “Don’t worry about it.” He winks and then goes into the stable, probably in search of his nefariously acquired horse.
Eyes darkening with intent, Gabriel gets up from the desk, and comes around it to straddle Sam’s thighs.  He wraps his arms around Sam’s shoulders, and tugs the back of his hair, forcing Sam to tilt his head back to look up at him.  “That kind of information comes at a price,” he murmurs.
Before they separate, Sam’s biocircuitry lights up.  “Hey, Gabriel is calling me.  I’m going to log on to Moondor for a few hours if you need me.”
“Roast beef and cheddar for you,” Castiel pulls out Dean’s sandwich.  “And salt and vinegar chips to share with me.”
Castiel holds her tighter.  It’s entirely possible that if they’d had this conversation while he was in the hospital that he would have accepted the apology and taken her back.  But she hadn’t been there when he woke up, and he checked himself out immediately, despite the protests from his mother and the doctors.
Dean holds himself tightly, afraid he’ll lash out if Cas decides to pry.  The Pinkerton’s gaze is heavy on his shoulders, and the dried blood still clinging to the cracks of his knuckles and under his nails itches.  He wants to wash it away, but doing so will draw more attention to it.
Guthrie laughs, a chilling sound that cuts through the blazing heat.  When the noose is pulled down and tightened around his neck his laughter trails off, but he grins widely at the watching crowd.  There’s no fear in his eyes, only a burning madness.
Dean laughs.  “Shut up, you know what I mean.  Anyway, I’m minding my own business and out of nowhere Bobby says--” he lowers his voice, imitating Bobby’s rough drawl, “--‘you know you can bring that Benny boy around for dinner if you want’.  Next thing I know, Sam’s telling me he’ll still love me if I’m gay, and Bobby and Rufus are talking about their own relationship… it was like a goddamn intervention.”
The adrenaline drop shifts to arousal so fast that Sam’s head spins.  He grinds his hips against Gabriel, grunting at the wet fabric between them.  “Want you,” he growls against Gabriel’s mouth. “Now.”
“Already?” Dean’s hands slide away, and Castiel immediately wants the return of their weight against his skin.  “You just unplugged what… eight or nine hours ago?”
Well that definitely explains Castiel’s normal outfit of a loose t-shirt and lounge pants.  He must have loaded his favorite orange items into the washer too.  Dean rolls his eyes.  “You probably balanced it wrong.  I’ll help you with it, but I need coffee and breakfast first.”
In the shower, he turns his face up to the spray and just breathes in the steam.  The water beats down on his chest, relaxing muscles and warming all the places that had gone cold when he saw Castiel lift his gun and point it at Dean.  It had taken everything in him to hide how disturbed he was by the incident, and now that he’s in a safe place with no one to witness his distress, the overwhelming terror he’d felt finally escapes from the box he’d locked it in.
Men, women, and several children emerge from the cabins, while even more young men appear in the fields and corrals, all watching the strangers with wary curiosity.  Many of them are dark haired and dark eyed, with similar features.  But there are anglos among them as well.  Castiel even picks out a young blonde boy, and a redheaded girl of only a few years clutching an older girl’s skirts and peeking at the visitors with pale eyes.  It’s a large group, the children ranging from an infant cradled in a young woman’s arms to young boys and girls on the cusp of adulthood.
The reminder of the demon that had whipped Cas wipes away Dean’s humor.  “I’m sorry I didn’t come sooner.  I had to wait until they were distracted.”
“Why is-” Sam cuts off with a huff and squeezes the bridge of his nose.  There’s a warning throb behind his eyes and he’s going to have to mix himself up something for it after he’s done making the vamp antidote or he’s going to be in for one hell of a migraine later.
Seeming to realize he’s got an audience, Dean coughs and straightens.  He turns a disgusted glare on the bulky android that delivered Castiel’s new parts.  “What are we going to do with this guy?”
“You’re a damn fine shot with that thing,” Sam says as they meet in a small circle among the carnage.
Whether Castiel planned to resist or not, he’ll never know.  Something unseen wraps around him, and pulls him across the floor, until he’s kneeling at Alistair’s feet.  The demon doesn’t move other than to reach out and pet his fingers through Castiel’s hair.  “I’m so torn,” he murmurs.  “Do I wait for Dean to return to me, and use you to retrain him?  Or do I burn away that silly ink in your skin, and greet him with your face?”
Cas nods and heads for his horse, but Sam stops Dean from mounting Baby with a soft grip around his arm.  “Hey,” he says low enough not to carry.  “Are you all right?”
And now he’s in the dump, probably inching closer to being destroyed in recycling, if he hasn’t been already.
He gives up on limping along, and straddles the bike.  Pushing it forward with his feet is still slow going, but it’s a great relief to take the weight off his leg.  At this rate, it may be the middle of the night before he gets back to town, but at least this way he believes he’ll make it.
Amara’s voice carries on the night air, haunting Castiel as he leaves Dean behind.  Jealousy burns through his blood.  The faceless woman in his mind who gives Dean a family takes on Amara’s features.  He realizes that Dean may not be interested in her now, due to her age, but in a few years, when Dean is ready to retire, he may see her in a whole different light.  And there are things she can give him that Castiel never can.
For a while he’d tried self medicating with alcohol, but that hadn’t helped either.  Not surprising since it never helped his dad deal with his problems.  One morning he’d walked into the kitchen, and seen the sun gleaming off all those empty bottles… well he wasn’t so much of an idiot that he didn’t recognize when he’d turned onto a bad road, and with Pam’s help he’d been able to get turned back in the right direction.
“Should he be able to do that?” Dean demands.  He’s still pressed close to Castiel’s side, although he’s also craning around to examine parts of the hologram.
But Dean does neither of those things.  He tucks the infant into the crook of his arm with practiced ease, and distracts Benito with another piece of tortilla to chew on.  “All right, where do you keep dry pants for this little muchacho?” Dean asks while he and the baby carry on with a mock battle over the tortilla.
Castiel rushes to help, grabbing the creature’s wrists and pinning them to the ground above its head.  Its claws are stained red, and blood drips from several slashes in Dean’s skin, including one too close to one of his eyes for comfort.  Dean doesn’t seem to notice.  With one hand still holding the rugaru down by the throat, he grabs the syringe from where it had been knocked out of his hand, luckily still within reach, and plunges the needle into the creature’s neck.  He thumbs the plunger down, injecting the anti-nanite gel.
His eyes unfocus again, and several sectors of the hologram change from the uniform pale blue to a lime green.  Castiel’s active memory updates, and he knows his admin password.
, lying under the stars in the back of his truck, cuddled up to a hot guy who doesn’t show any disgust or fear over his scars and his shitty trauma.  Castiel is warm and solid, his heart beating steadily under Dean’s ears as his fingers trace shapes on Dean’s back.  He waits quietly, patiently, for Dean to tell him more, but he seems just as content with the quiet between them as Dean is.
Before he can comment further, Cas spins around to face Gordon with a devastating smile on his face.  “Is there something else?”
Moving as close to a flat out run as he can while dodging people on the streets, Castiel makes it to the coffee shop in record time.  Breathing hard from the exertion he shoulders his way through the other patrons standing around gawking at Rowena as she tries to coax Dean out of the corner he’d backed himself into.  Seeing Dean makes his already elevated heart rate turn into painful thumps under his sternum.  He’s crouched with his shoulders pressed against the wall, flinching at every sound.
“Oh yeah okay that can wait,” Gabriel babbles.  His wings twitch against the bed, and his fingers curl into the lavish blankets under his body.  And when Sam slides a single finger inside him, his head tilts back against the mattress and he lets out a low keening that might or might not be Sam’s name.
Instead of reaching out, Dean moves the bucket near Castiel’s knees then lies back down but with his head on Castiel’s thigh instead of the pillow.  He tilts his head back enough to look up at Castiel.  “Is this okay?”
One of the spark plugs falls off the ratchet when he tries to pull it free, and clangs its way down into the depths of the engine.  By the sound, he knows it didn’t find its way through to the floor.  Cursing, he leans down to see if fell somewhere he can reach it easily.
He leans in and presses a tender kiss against Castiel’s lips.  “I love you, Cas,” he whispers, breath hot against Castiel’s lips.  “That’s what I came here to tell you, even if you don’t want to hear it.”
They don’t get far before he hears the distinctive sound of more guns being cocked from more than one direction.
He stops under a lemon tree and presses a hand to the ache under his sternum.  Closing his eyes, he takes slow, deep breaths.  But the feeling doesn’t pass.  Instead, realization dawns that maybe he hasn’t been as successful at protecting his heart as he’d thought.
Krissy’s voice snaps Dean out of his spiraling thoughts, and he sends a quick command to his nanites to stop the rising heat in his cheeks.  It doesn’t work to disguise his thoughts though because Krissy smirks at whatever the hell his expression must be doing.  “I think Dean likes it too”
Jo shows him her teeth, more of a challenge than a smile.  Behind them the bell rings over the door as the stranger walks in.
“Somehow I thought it would go to that sheriff out at Las Cruces,” Sam says.  “He trailed us into those mountains, but a friend of ours managed to get him lost.”
“You know it’s me.” He steps closer to her desk and leans over it, over her.  “Tell me why you threw me away.”
But he definitely needs to lighten the hell up.  He’d noticed the flash of uncertainty when Castiel mentioned Hannah, and he doesn’t want to be the kind of guy that Castiel has to tiptoe around certain subjects with.  “It sounds like Hannah’s got nothin’ on my mad dishwashing skills,” he teases.  “But the real question is how do you feel about cat fur?  Because Lore sheds like crazy, and I think she likes you.”
The last of his annoyance melts away.  Dean still wants him to take something, but he’s not pushing anymore, because he respects Castiel’s wishes even if he vehemently disagrees with them.
“It ain’t no fancy condo in Boston,” Bobby says as Castiel surveys the room.  “Lot cheaper though, I imagine.”
His limbs grow heavy and useless, even as he mentally commands himself to retreive the knife, he feels it slip from limp fingers.
Her vaguely hopeful expression crumbles and she shakes her head.  “I’m so sorry, it’s really not here.  I even checked to see if it got left on someone’s desk instead of in the mail room.  There isn’t anything addressed to you.”
“C’mon man, talk to me,” Sam entreats, going with Unthreatening and Reasonable so he doesn’t spook Dean any further.  One wrong step and Dean’ll clam up for weeks. “What’s wrong? And don’t tell me it’s nothing. I’m not an idiot, and I know you better than anyone,” he adds when Dean looks like he’s going to object.
” he grunts as he starts putting away the rag and cleaner he’d been using on the car’s seats.  “It’s just a little warm in here and I’ve been moving around a lot.”  Which is true, but definitely not the reason for his red face.
Now Sam does look at him, his face scrunched into a put upon glare.  “Oh please.  You can’t deny that half the reason you’re being such an ass to him is because you want him.”
“There was more wrong with our marriage than a lack of children,” Castiel says with a firm headshake.  “Maybe we would stay together for the kids, but honestly, I don’t know.  And I don’t think I’d want us to be tied together that way.  It wouldn’t be fair to the innocent members of our family.”
Dean’s voice is warmth, and Castiel gravitates closer to it.  Why is he so cold? “I just… just give me… a minute.”
When he stands up out of the water, his skin tingles for a whole other reason than the cold air on his wet skin.  He glances back to the camp and the tethered horses, who seem at ease as they rest.  There’s nothing on the opposite bank along the forest line either.
Castiel refrains from thanking him.  It seems ill-mannered to show appreciation when he forced Dean into this situation.  The fact that the Winchesters were already going to die was justification enough for his actions before, but he sees now how cruel he was to these men who didn’t deserve such treatment, much less the death sentence hanging over their heads.
Then he pointedly looks over Dean’s shoulder.  “Your manners are lacking, mi amigos.  You haven’t introduced your compadre.”  He waves at Cas, who is still astride his horse, quietly taking in the reunion.
“Don’t look a gift horse in the mouth,” he mutters as he pulls the top blanket from the bed and gets another face full of sneeze inducing dust.  He doesn’t know what the idiom actually means aside from its common usage, but looking up the origin of the strange turn of phrase distracts him from the discomfort in his sinuses while he goes about dusting surfaces.
“I guess.  He’s around, doin’ his God Business.”  Dean clears his throat when it threatens to close around his next words.  “And Cas is helpin’ him out.”
His wounds are healing.  The bullet holes in his side are neatly closed, and heavy bandages hold his ribs so they can also continue to heal.  The infection that had swollen his thigh to almost double its normal size has abated.  The ugly discoloration is fading.  Castiel changes the bandages himself, and applies fresh salve.
Dean looks up, his eyes sweeping over Castiel.  When he doesn’t find anything wrong, he smiles.  “Mornin’, sunshine,” he says.  “Hungry?”
Castiel absorbs every detail, adding megabyte after megabyte to a database he’s partitioned off specifically for Dean.  He records the soft gasps Dean makes when Castiel runs his fingernails across his shoulders.  He saves the location of every patch of skin that reacts to his touch with goosebumps.  He flags the data of how Dean’s muscles go loose when Castiel’s fingertips dip briefly in the cleft of his ass.
Beautiful.  Especially when he smiles bashfully, as he always does when Castiel has been staring longer than is socially acceptable, but the attention is still appreciated.
“Looked like it to him,” Dean explains.  They’ve reached the part of the city where he can take control of his car, so he disengages the auto drive and turns down the highway that will take them home.  “I’m surprised he didn’t kill you, to be honest. If I hadn’t woken up when I did, he probably would have.”
A shadow falls across him, distracting him from the thought anyway.  He rolls his eyes toward its source, and scowls.  “Dude, can you be any more of a cliche?”
“Love it when you manhandle me,” Dean mumbles.  He tips his chin forward, pressing his lips against Castiel’s in a series of small, gentle kisses.  His eyes had drifted shut and he looks like he might want to go back to sleep.
As soon as he’d reached town he’d checked in at the local Marshal’s office.  His inquiry about the Winchesters had been met with curiosity and some skepticism.  A reaction he’s becoming used to since he’d left Denver on his hunt for his brother’s killers.  Marshal Earp had sent a telegram ahead for them to be on the lookout for the escaped prisoners, and no one had seen them yet, but they did have other information he needed.
“Yes, I am.” Castiel glances around.  “Although maybe not here.  I have a feeling your friends would be distracting.” His attention comes back to Dean, with a heated gaze.  “And I think we’d have more fun doing it alone anyway.”
“Again?” Castiel asks, and then smiles when Dean reaches between them and gently fondles his spent cock, massaging around it and sending tingles of pleasure through his belly.
“Yeah yeah okay I got it,” Dean says loudly.  His grin is back, and he shakes his head too, but he doesn’t seem to be denying anything.  “How about right now we don’t call it anything while I’m this gross.”  He tugs at the strings at his waist again, but this time he loosens them.  “How in the hell do you have a whole database of dick slang, but you miss so many figures of speech?”
Maybe when this construction project is done he’ll take a few less intensive jobs. He can see if his hot neighbor wants to hang out a bit.  Even if he’s not into dudes, it would be nice to make a friend in the new place.  Dean’s used to having a roommate, but now that he’s living on his own, it’s a little lonely in his down time.
Dean takes a deep breath, and looks into Castiel’s eyes.  “I haven’t had many serious relationships,” he says.  “Mostly because I was so busy with my military career, and then I came back home and I
“There is the possibility that they stepped out for a drink,” Virgil suggests haltingly, obviously aware of what a lame excuse it is.  “We could check the saloons in town.”
Giving up on getting his hands any cleaner without some harsh soap, Dean tucks the rag back in his pocket.  Completely unafraid of Jo’s temper, and the heavy tool-slash-weapon in her hand, he steps close and slings an arm over her shoulder.  He takes the wrench, twisting until it slips out of her white-knucked grip, and sets it on the bench before guiding her out of the garage and into the afternoon sunlight.  “If you don’t go back, she’ll gloat about being right,” Dean says as a blast of heat hits him.  He’s already sweaty from working in the garage all morning, but being out of the shade only feels a hair cooler than the surface of the sun at the moment.
But as he makes his way through the airport, the urge to hear Dean’s voice becomes too strong to resist and he pulls his phone out anyway.
Relieved, Dean accepts the soda and presses the cold glass against his forehead.  “No kidding.”  August in the desert is a bitch, and Benny’s garage only has a measly box fan to move the hot air around.  He takes a long swallow from the bottle, and then gestures at the truck.  “Alright, now that we’re done talking about my personal life, let’s get this bastard put back together.”
Castiel can see that their argument isn’t just going nowhere, it had become circular, rehashing each point while neither man gave any ground.  If it's the truth about the Colt being the only weapon they can use against Alistair, then Castiel isn’t going to let it slip out of his grasp.  Despite the gathering storm in Dean’s eyes over the interruption, Castiel steps forward, bumping past Dean’s shoulder so that he’s no longer half-hidden behind the Winchesters and meets Rufus' curious gaze.  “And I’m doing it for my brother.”
Looking back at the doors, Castiel zooms his vision in until he can see the details beyond the glass.  There’s a deep lobby, with a wide desk manned by a single receptionist.  Over their head the Angel Industries logo glows softly, backlit by multi-colored LEDs.  People mill around inside the lobby, journeying from elevators to small shops that flank the area.  Humans going about their daily business, hardly looking at each other unless it’s to exchange pleasantries.
“It’s enough,” Dean commands sharply.  “The Fates have other plans for these people, and you’ve already interfered with their work enough.”
Dean is starving, and the idea of following his brother to the kitchen is tempting, but Castiel’s continued silence is really starting to bug him.  He scours his brain for something to say, a way to prod Castiel into opening up.
It’s concerning, and he should attempt to perform corrective maintenance.  But every time he considers asking Dean or Sam for assistance his security protocols start sending up even more errors and alarms.  It’s nearly the same reaction he had to Naomi advising him of another pending reset, or the moment when he woke to find an unknown green-eyed man standing before him and reacted in self defense.
It’s just a list of locations, and Sam doesn’t take long to figure out what they are by the names.  “Why are you giving me a list of brothels?”
Shoving that disturbing thought back to a deep dark corner of his mind, Dean returns his attention to the road.  “Everything turned out okay though, so don’t worry about it.” It’s practically his motto. “You did good today.”
It’s not the reassurance Dean was hoping for, but he’ll take whatever reprieve they can get.  And he keeps his weapon ready, just in case.
Dean has to tilt his chin down to meet Castiel’s worried gaze because the android is right up in Dean’s personal space, making their height difference more noticeable.  “Don’t worry, Cas.  You won’t even notice what’s going on when it happens.”
“We could stay awhile longer,” Sam says.  He moves further into the room, sitting in the chair that has been at Dean’s bedside for weeks, and looking up at Dean through his too-long hair.  “Cesar and Jesse and Ellie have all said they’d like us to stay as long as we want.”
Sam and Eileen stand together under an arch of orange and yellow irises.  Bonfires flank the raised dais, and torches line the aisles.  Light and shadow from all the flames dance across Eileen’s flowing white dress, making her appear to be bathed in her own fire.  Both the bride and groom are displaying their wings proudly, Eileen’s sheer and rainbow shimmery, Sam’s fiery feathers arched over his shoulders.  Only clever spell work keep them from sparking fire in his clothing and the nearby flowers.  And Eileen’s fairy blood protects her from Sam’s burning touch.
Cas is all hard muscle and power in Dean’s arms.  He could shove Dean away, defend himself from any unwanted touch, but all that strength is dormant and pliable as he gives himself over to Dean’s kisses in a way that is humbling.  Dean could draw Cas to the ground and have him right here and--
He senses the boy might be an ally, but he’ll need to gain his trust.  “Can I help you cook?  I’m not very good at it, but…”
The idea of putting one of those pills in his mouth and swallowing it makes Castiel’s stomach roil in protest.  He hasn’t been clean for very long, and he has no idea how easy it will be for him to backslide into addiction, and he’s not willing to risk it.  He just needs a little more time.
But he knows this is different.  He knows what signs to watch for, and what led him down the wrong path in the first place.  This is only for a headache, not a way to curb his depression.  He’s no longer suffering the heartbreak of a broken marriage.
“Well, I never would’a believed it,” Ellie mutters with disappointment.  “I thought sure we’d have us a gunfight on our hands.”
Castiel jerks around and gapes as Sam rides into the little clearing, leading Dean’s Appaloosa and Castiel’s gelding.
It’s a familiar argument, and he falls into the snarky back and forth they always share.  He’s not even middle aged, and she’s not even legal to vote, buy cigarettes or alcohol, or even watch porn yet.  Damn
Despite having a mild headache from not getting enough sleep, Dean feels pretty good, and starts to whistle or hum along as well.  The part of his mind that isn’t taken up with what he’s doing wanders, and he smiles when he remembers the dream he’d been having during his nap.
In an attempt to nip those thoughts in the bud, Dean jerks his eyes away.  They land on the mule near Cas' gelding, and annoyance successfully grabs his full attention.
Pamela pauses on the dressing room’s threshold and her voice is high pitched with what sounds like fear.  “He what now?”
Teeth flashing in a grin, Sam sets up a small metal stand over the fire and puts a tiny skillet over it to warm up.  “It’s not safe to be too close to water out in the desert.  You’re more likely to run into unfriendly critters that way.”
He half expects the android to throw another bone crushing punch at Sam, which would be a huge mistake since Sam is a Hunter, and the commotion caused by a body smashing furniture would bring him prepared for trouble.  But the android stops just out of Sam’s reach and drops into a defensive crouch.  It watches Sam with wary eyes, and speaks for the first time.
.” It’s spoken so fiercely that it leaves no room for Dean to doubt Castiel’s sincerity.  “I know this is hard for you, and I’m sorry.  But it won’t be forever.”
“Nah, I checked out the model and compared it to what you have, and they’re only cosmetically different, not functionally.” Dean pushes up into a sitting position and narrows his eyes.  “You were okay with that, right?  I didn’t overstep?”
He hadn’t expected to stop at Dean’s right now, but it makes sense.  If Ash drops him off to the motel, he’ll have to either ask him the extra favor of helping him get his bike to the shop the next morning, or call for a tow if that’s even an available service around here.  His heartbeat kicks up at the idea of seeing Dean again so soon.
Anyway, thankfully a dream that all the skin peeled off my legs gave me an idea.  It was a gross dream, but I'll take inspiration anywhere I can get it lol
Castiel has trouble getting his toe in the stirrup to mount.  The boots Dean had found for him are too big, which he would have thought to be a relief after his own too tight boots that still hadn’t been broken in yet.  But his feet slide around in these, and they’re starting to rub new blisters into his heels.  It takes him a few tries to mount up, and when he’s finally astride his horse, he looks up to find Dean watching him from the back of his Appaloosa.
Closing his eyes against the handsome man in front of him, Castiel scrambles for self control.  His willpower is stretched ribbon thin, and it takes everything in him to not grab Dean and ravish him right there on the table.  After a breath to steel himself against Dean’s beauty, he opens his eyes to find Dean watching him intently.  “I want more than a fling,” he admits.  “And I don’t want you to think I take things like this lightly.”
He doesn’t offer painkillers again, even though his instincts are screaming at him to do something, anything, to ease Castiel’s suffering.  But he’s got plenty of practice clamping down on those instincts since Sammy had grown from a clumsy, gangly kid into a competent adult who doesn’t like Dean treating him like a twelve year old anymore.  “Sounds good.  See you in a few.”
And then they’re blessedly alone.  It probably won’t last long, but Dean’s going to enjoy as much of it as he can.
Castiel frowns at his back.  His own spine goes ramrod straight and he tries to clamp down on his arousal.  “I don’t think sharing the bed is appropriate.”
Castiel Jameson gives the room one more sweeping glance to make sure he’d left nothing behind.  Then he slips out of the room, closing the door behind him.
Dean straightens, but doesn’t pull out of the hug.  He smiles down at Castiel.  “No, I didn’t think that.”  He keeps his voice low.  Hospitals always make him feel like it’s rude to talk louder than a whisper.  “But I’m still glad you came.”
He’s going to keep arguing, which Dean understands.  Castiel doesn’t have actual nerve endings lighting up under Dean’s touch.  His body is only responding because it’s programmed to, and even if he has an orgasm it won’t be real.  Not the way a biological body’s would be.  And because of that Dean usually let’s Cas do all the work, taking him apart at the seams and putting him back together with a freakish level of skill--and Dean really doesn’t want to think of the small jittery man he met today coming up with all of Castiel’s sexual knowledge programming--that leaves him too worn out to even think about returning the favor, if it were possible.
Dean blinks as if he didn’t expect that question.  “I binge a lot of Netflix, or hang out with friends.  Or I work.” He shrugs, and rubs the back of his neck.  “Fixing cars relaxes me.”
The android’s eyes flick to Dean’s hand, but he doesn’t reach for it.  He doesn’t attack either, so still a win.  “I have a
A voice in the background lets out an excited whoop and the hologram shifts to include Jimmy.  “Fuck tomorrow, I’ll go into the lab tonight and get started!”  He waves ‘into the camera’.  “Hi Dean.  Glad you’re on board.”
Her mouth snaps shut, and she gives him a perturbed look.  “You seem to have all the answers before I know what to ask.”
“I beg your pardon?” Castiel is fluent in French, as it had been required in his schooling, but knows very little Spanish.  With as much time as he’s been spending in territories where the language is common, he really should make an effort to learn it.
He is in no way inured to death, although it no longer shocks him as it once did.  But he’s never seen death at such scale, and nothing so brutal since Emmanuel.
He looks down at the softly glowing power supply in his hand.  He wants to be satisfied with his confrontation with Naomi.  The fear in her eyes as they left wasn’t exactly respect, but it was acknowledgement that he is more than an object to her now.
They make camp at the first summit just as the sun is starting to lower itself below the rocky peaks.  It’s too dangerous to continue their ascent up the mountain in the darkness.  But they’d ridden for almost fourteen hours, and both they and their horses need rest.
When Castiel opens the room, Sam’s head comes up, and he smiles in relieved welcome.  “You look much better,” he says, standing to take the tray from Castiel and put it on a small table near the bed.  “More like a Pinkerton agent, and less like a mountain trapper.”
He doesn’t know if Aaron is aware that he’s no longer an android, and he doesn’t really have time to educate him.  “No, I’m here of my own volition.”  He swings his duffle off his shoulder and unzips it.  “I have something to sell.”
But this time is different, and even though Dean understands Castiel’s limitations, this isn’t about biological functions.  It’s about an intimacy that Dean only knows how to express physically.
He’s done his best to avoid Dean since the moment they’d shared at the spring, going to Sam for his needs or to answer his questions.  Or he’s kept his nose buried in John’s journal to avoid conversation.  Even now Cas is mostly addressing himself to Sam, and purposely not looking at Dean whenever possible.
After another short period of thought, Castiel’s irises settle down and he nods.  “Thank you, Dean.  I hope we will both find reason to trust each other.”
Water, mud, and debris churn toward them, sweeping up anything and everything in its path.  And it’s going to take them with it if Dean can’t get Cas to higher ground
Now Dean’s throat does close up.  Maybe he’s not done mourning.  Maybe he’s just upset that Cas got out of the Empty and didn’t come straight to him to let him know.  They could have had time.  Time to do one last tap dance around each other before coming together and breaking in Dean’s memory foam mattress with its first two person horizontal mambo.  But then again, maybe Cas didn’t think that was a possibility…
It would make sense of why Dean had ridden with Alistair for so long.  Castiel can’t imagine any other reason that he would do so.  Not when he speaks of the Comancheros with such distaste.
Sooo.... remember when I wondered if this fic would end up shorter than the original because I was cutting stuff out?
Dean rolls his eyes, unwilling to concede.  “And what would you know of how a woman looks at a man?”
Unbidden an image of himself in Dean’s arms appears from the depths of his imagination, and his body reacts.  He clamps his teeth over his bottom lip and closes his eyes.  He doesn’t want to think about that, but as he listens to the other two people in the room, the image becomes more and more vivid.
He definitely doesn’t want a woman either.  He wouldn’t even if he were here for pleasure rather than business, but he can think of no excuse that won’t make her suspicious.
She steamrolls over his response.  “Home is where the heart is, Castiel.  If you decide you’ve found a new home, then stay.”
It’s something Sam hasn’t really felt in the bunker since his mother died in a hunt when he was a teen.  Mary had taken John’s light with her, and a few years later he’d followed her into the dark, leaving Sam and Dean alone in the huge complex built for far more than just two people to occupy.
Castiel’s attention is fully on what he’s doing, a crinkle of concentration between his brows.  He hums thoughtfully, and then gives a short nod.
Dean claps a hand on Castiel’s shoulder, the touch coming easier now that he expects the human-like warmth under the layers of cloth.  “We’re gonna start with how to make breakfast then.  Probably not all that useful for an android that can’t appreciate scrambled eggs, but I’m starving and I know Sam will be too when he gets up.”
He still has to override his safety functions to speak though, and he hesitates for a few milliseconds while he disables the internal warning.  “I don’t like to sleep because…” he force closes the security application so it will stop popping up the warning.  “Because I experience memory errors.  They load randomly, often out of order, and I find them… disturbing.”
When they reach Sam he’s frantically clearing away rotting food scraps that should have been sent to compost instead of the dump.  And beneath the disgusting mess is a body.  There’s no signs of decomposition, and no teeth marks from ghouls.  And when a face is revealed under Sam’s ministrations, Castiel gasps and shuffles closer, dropping to his knees with a squelch.
Dean shudders and reaches out to touch him.  He’s still warm, which doesn’t really ease Dean’s sudden disquiet.  The only thing that probably will is getting him charged up again so that he’ll be able to power back up and walk and talk like a real man again.  Another reason to hurry the fuck up and get home.
“Not the work itself.” There’s an edge of annoyance to his voice, but he doesn’t expound on whatever is bothering him.
Instead of wasting energy on fighting the current, Dean lets go of the root and concentrates on keeping hold of Cas.  Kicking his feet in an attempt to keep their heads above water he shouts “Swim!”
He finds their abandoned camp in an old cliff dwelling just after midday.  The remains of their campfire are still warm.
One of her shoulders lifts in a shrug.  “Sure, some.  But I kinda thought you’d want to stick around for a while.”
“I...I’d rather not.” Dean’s words are slightly slurred, as if he had something in his mouth blocking his tongue.
Alistair moves in again, close as a lover.  “I can see why Dean has claimed you for his own,” he murmurs.  “You’re magnificent.”
When he’s finally buried inside Dean to the root, Castiel goes still.  His muscles twitch like he’s trying to control himself, like he wants to give Dean time to adjust.  Which Dean definitely needs.  He marvels at the fullness inside him.  Castiel is bigger than he’d expected.
“Well why would you?” Dean asks as he unwraps the rest of his sandwich.  He slumps back in his seat, and props his boots up on the corner of Castiel’s desk.  He takes a huge bite, and speaks around it.  “Food there can’t be nearly as good as this.”
Dean assumes they are far up in the mountains, perhaps even already at the hideout.  But it’s also possible they’re close by. He won’t put Cas in that kind of danger.
He reaches up and presses a finger against the tender flesh under the tattoo.  It burns like a brand, and Castiel hisses as pain radiates out across his chest and into his shoulder.  When Black Eyes removes his touch, Castiel expects to look down and see smoke rising from blackened skin.  But the tattoo, and his skin underneath it, remains intact.
For almost as long as he can remember, Dean has eschewed the need for kindness, gentleness, and tenderness.  There’s no room for them in his life after his mother’s death.  But now from somewhere deep within comes the need to comfort and protect Cas.  To take away his fear, and give him the gentle care that he deserves.
It sounds like a jest.  No one really believes the dead come back to life.  But Castiel has seen things in his investigations over the years that have opened his eyes.  And there’s also the strange journal he’d found among his brother’s belongings…
He almost points out that Purgatory is his home now, but it isn’t important at the moment.  “How’s dad?”
His thoughts are interrupted by a cheer going up behind him, and he turns to see that Dean is stepping up onto the stage.  His mouth drops open in surprise, even though Dean had mentioned earlier in the night that he’d sign up for the singing.  But other than getting drinks, Dean had been at his side all night and hadn’t given any indication that he was planning on taking his turn on stage.
“He went to Crossroads.” Dean lets out a triumphant huff as he pulls the spark plug free.  He drops the piece in his palm and shows it to Sam.  “See?  No big deal.”
“Is it because she keeps coming on to you?” Castiel asks.  He doesn’t know if he has a jealousy protocol, but it would have had barely any time to boot up with how quickly Dean had made it clear he was in a relationship with Castiel and wasn’t interested in her offers.
“What the hell?”  Dean throws the blankets back and stands as he checks the system again.  When he still doesn’t show up in the bunker, he pings Cas directly.
After a kiss between her ears, Castiel sets Lore on the bed and follows his boyfriend out of the room, chuckling when he hears Dean grumbling about “insane weather” and “snow before Christmas is unnatural is what it is”.  They end up outside, where his own luggage is already tucked in the Impala’s trunk.  “Is there anything else you think we’ll need?”
Dean’s smile slips a little.  Something about the way she said that feels a little ominous.  His appetite sours, and he sets the uneaten half of his sandwich on the desk.  “What do you mean?”
Dean barely notices the quiet that falls over the room and the curious look the women give him as he stares down the hallway to where Castiel disappeared.  He doesn’t spare them a look when he decides to follow.  “I’ll be back.”
His throat tries to close, and his eyes begin to water.  The heat radiates outward, and he feels his whole face start to burn so badly that he wouldn’t be surprised if smoke starts leaking from his ears.
Dean is immediately at his other side, sliding an arm over his shoulders and leaning in to press a kiss against his temple.  “Hey.  You’re not thinking of backing out are you?”
He strokes Dean to full hardness and relishes all the little noises he pulls from Dean.  Turning Dean into putty in his hands is a skill that he was able to utilize immediately after his transition, no practice required.  Although hardly a day has gone by that they haven’t practiced anyway.  Hormonal surges often have Castiel shoving Dean into any dark corner where they won’t offend Sam’s sensibilities, and sometimes he’s so overwhelmed with lust he doesn’t even bother with privacy.
Jo has already been giving him a hard time.  As soon as he told her he was taking Cas to the Roadhouse, she’d started asking him if he was going to get “girlied up”, and suggesting the best pants to highlight his “assets”.  Dark looks and growled threats have only spurred her on, and ignoring her would be impossible.  Even if he lets her off the clock early, he’d have to physically lock her out of the garage to get her to leave him alone, and it’s far too hot to put the doors down as a barrier against her teasing.
And he does give the little hotel Castiel picked an impressed look as they park out front and walk in together.
She must have snuck back into the dressing room through a hidden door that he missed during his earlier search.  And now Winchester might get away if Castiel can’t fend off her attack. She has the benefit of surprise, but he’s still bigger and stronger than her.  And no slouch in a fight. He leverages his feet against the floor and heaves her to the side with his hips. A shove sends Pamela face first into the carpet, and he’s free.
The end effect is a frankly disturbing number of eyes staring at him out of the room as he dances terribly to music playing only in his head.
Jesus H. Christ. Dean spins so quickly he almost knocks the pasta off the stove, and then there is the brief panic of righting the pot.
“Leaving dishes in the sink is gross, Sammy.” That comes out a bit harsher than he’s trying for, but Sam doesn't seem fazed.
Dean finishes the dock, pauses the tape, and even takes a few silent, selfish seconds to be proud of the work he’s done.
She says she likes to feel the vibrations of the music in the car. Last time Sam had asked about that, they started talking about an entirely different set of vibrations, so Sam doesn’t ask anymore. Not if he wants to keep blood in his brain.
Castiel was in love with Dean, and he didn’t care who knew it. He also didn't require anything beyond acknowledgment of his love’s existence. Dean tried to imagine a love that didn’t ask anything of him and simply couldn’t. Dean’s love had always been need. Dean’s love demanded loyalty, begged to be loved in return. Dean’s love had no patience, none of Cas’s forgiving care. Dean’s love was violent and silent. Cas’s love was gentle and spoken.
Cas frowns at his shirt sleeve like it has personally betrayed him. On closer examination, the sleeve cuff is a bit uneven, rolled poorly. It’s Cas’s right sleeve, so non-dominant hand use might have tripped him up.
. His baseline. His most mediocre. Cas knows Dean. Cas doesn’t just know the face Dean puts on for most of the world: he knows
Dean had known a little sign before they met Eileen. He’d tried to learn some after they’d met Lucas, reminded suddenly of how easy it is for words to abandon you. It wasn’t an easy thing to learn on the road, so Dean hadn’t gotten far, but he’d been on the look out for books that might help. After Hell, he’d barely remembered it. He’d tried to get back into it during his year at Lisa’s, just in case Ben ever...
Dean lets the shame buffet him. No bones to burn, no monster to kill. Still, he’s falling apart. Just listening to a woman scream about the tongues of liars. Listening to her scream
“Ah yeah. Okay, that's actually a classic thing. So like, say you have someone you want to tell something to, but you're not good with words — or, you're not sure how they would respond to the words?” Sam floundered. Dean should’ve helped him with that because he knew that Sam had never made a mixtape for anyone a day in his life, and also how the hell do you explain a high school experience to a 3 year old whose closest friends are maladjusted hunters and a creature who is older than humanity itself? But see, Dean was really busy with the kitchen counter, and luckily Sammy was actually a bonafide genius, so he trucked on. “So, basically, it's a way of communicating emotion — the way music communicates emotion, so if you have a song that you want to, uh…if you want to communicate what the song wants to communicate to someone, you can put it on a mixtape. Or, like, if the music is really important to you, you can share it that way?” Sam's voice lilted up at the end of the explanation, like even he wasn’t sure what he was saying.
The tape ticks over, dialogue starts, and Dean is too busy trying to figure out if Cas included a scene from a movie with an underscore to freak out about the lyrics. By the time the second pre-chorus comes on, Dean isn’t even panicked — he’s just confused.
Is Cas saying he lost faith in Dean, that he lost his faith for Dean? Or is Cas saying Dean’s lost faith in everything?
It might be the same confused sadness of another situation, but Dean will be damned if he can think of one right now.
Everything he ever had was used up and burnt out: by the rack, by the mark, by Michael, by the realisation that all of that — ALL of that — had just been a twisted game to fuel Chuck’s drama. Every life he’d ever saved was meaningless because they were all still stuck in the web of Chuck’s warmachine. He was never going to be anything other than a soldier in a losing fight, but he still couldn’t give up on the small chance that he could buy freedom for others with blood, so he had to fight. He had to. He didn’t really have a choice.
Dean has no idea if he's made things better. Jack isn't crying anymore, which seems like a win, and he has a soft smile as Dean fumbles on the flannel and goes to tuck him in again. Dean walks to the door and figures, well — checking never hurt anything.
“Oh, the weather anomaly? Yeah, I thought that too. Turns out the Banes twins were just in town celebrating Alicia’s first birthday in her newly, uh...
The dock is dry, in that he doesn’t have to worry about the stain coming off onto his clothes, but it’s also wet, in that it's covered in morning dew. Dean bundles his jacket up, sits down, and stares up at the sky.
Dean, who learned his mistake last time the gang played Scrabble (another game that has been banned from game night, the list ever growing), stays the fuck out of it.
“I would not lie to the angels, Dean.” Cas’s face smooths out as he switches from confusion, through sadness and into simply regarding Dean. “I do not lie to the angels about you, Dean.”
Sam, who managed to absorb himself in a book in the 10 seconds that Cas tried to formulate a response, hums in reply before pulling his attention back to Cas. “Oh. Yeah. Everything’s good.”
Fortunately, he remembers that one Michael is dead and the other is happily vesseled. He rips the headphones off to take an extremely cold shower, but it's made worse by the fact that the song is just catchy enough to remain stuck in his head.
Hell, Eileen has watched Dean order around demons, angels, and gods alike. Eileen’s not so worried about her pride that she’s going to let people keep dying just because Dean wants to be in charge. She’s done it before on jobs, and she’ll do it again.
“You're using me as a meter stick for humanity?” Dean realises his voice has gotten a little high and works to correct it. That seems like a really quick way to get apocalypse two (four?) back on the menu.
No. I’m — “No shit, Castiel.” Dean bites. “Observational skills like that, no wonder you’re always fucking things up.”
Jack had been quiet for a while, and then thoughtful. He’d thanked Cas and then fallen asleep right there on Cas’s chest with one of Cas’s wings folded over him. Cas had sat for a long time in silence.
It’s objectively hilarious how often Sam and Dean walk into buildings full of law enforcement. Eileen is very invested in keeping her civilian ID clean enough to fly on her passport, thank you very much. Still, she loves how Dean has no fear about getting made, even in a building full of cops. There is a non-zero chance that Dean is actually waiting to be called out on it.
She’s comfortable, Sam realises. Sam feels comfortable around her. Not comfortable like complacent. Comfortable like comforted.
Uh, not his angel. Cas. Castiel. Castiel the weirdo angel of Thursday and Free Will and apparently also ABBA. Dean laughs a little to himself and resolves to show Cas
It's a love song. It's a fucking love song. And Cas knows that it's a love song, because Dean had explained it. Dean had said, “Sometimes you just want to touch someone so badly that every time you're not it feels like starving.” Castiel had responded by putting it on a mixtape labeled “For Dean”.
He rewinds the song. He gives up two minutes in and puts his head in his hands. He feels hot all over. There's…really no other interpretation. And Cas…Cas has had sex. Cas definitely knows about sex.
Dean thinks about Sam's probably cracked computer, and the definitely cracked range divider, and Jack's shattered facial expression — there is simply no way that's true. He misses the next verse but
Dean pops on Castiel’s second tape once he’s on the open highway and lets it start singing about Bees. Alone in his car, driving back towards the bunker, he tries to hold onto the softness and the happiness of seeing Cassie alive, vibrant, and healthy, but he feels it leeching away, leaving just him and his tired bones.
Dean can't even imagine saying I love you without feeling an icy grip at his throat. He can't imagine a version of himself that can give Castiel what he deserves.
He's not sure why Jack's here, to be honest. He's not sure how Jack could stand to look at him. He's not sure why Jack, powered up as he is, hasn't wiped Dean off the face of the earth.
“That’s—” God, if Cas could stop looking at him, Dean could lie and say that the tape made him unhappy and that’d be the end. Cas would never do it again.
Dean keeps a careful inch between himself and Cas when he leans across the table to distribute goodies. He also shamelessly fucks up everyone’s cards — no one is safe. Well, Jack is safe. The kid is bad enough at cards. He doesn’t need Dean messing with him on top of that.
Dean feels a lightness he’s not sure he’s felt in years. He’s not sure his feet touch the ground as he puts away his bags and reracks his guns. Hell, he’s still smiling by the time he sits back down on the bed.
“Cas! Get this! Patience’s college has a food hall, and it has a cereal bar! Can you believe that? It was all just sitting there, and they have like 8 different types! And a soft serve ice cream machine!”
“Is she also a hunter?” Cassie asks with genuine curiosity, and Dean holds back a groan. That’s her reporting voice, and he knows he’s about to suffer through a hundred questions about his fake marriage. Cassie’s going to catch him in a lie just like she’s done every time he tried to snow her when they were dating.
“What the fuck, Cas?” The creeping horror of Cas having seen him so pathetic, so broken, curls over his shoulders.
It’s a picture of several magpies from Cas, all of which have been crudely dyed different colours. The caption just says, “This is your fault.” Holy fucking fuck, they’re really dating, aren’t they?
Eileen grabs her bags, double checks that she hasn’t left anything, and nearly leaves cold coffee and keys alike on the counter. She doubles back and checks again.
“Thank you, Dean.” Cas says, his voice impossibly deep as he drops his hand to his side. Dean, who is staring at the sleeve for his own sanity, finds his gaze trailing alongside. It takes an impossibly long time for his eyes to travel up Cas’s body to find his eyes.
Then, he quietly sits down and starts to cry. Alone, silently shaking, carefully hidden in the trees.
“Heya Deano! Glad you could make it.” She laughs delightedly when he picks her up slightly in the hug. Jody gestures to the girls, and they break up their weird confusing sisterhood ritual to help put the groceries aways.
Claire and Alex drop antagonism for allyship as they gang up on Patience about some guy named Charles by the time Donna returns.
“What’s up, Cas? What’s going on?” Dean says, scanning the treeline, resting his free hand on his gun. The girls left for their hike, but if there’s a threat near the cabin they may not be clear enough.
The mixtape continues. Dean doesn't even have thoughts about the next song for 30 seconds, too busy trying to figure out the total tonal shift. You can't just go from Ella to whatever light-metal band this is.
Dean shoots Cas an incredulous look. He remembers every horrible second of being in Detroit. Of course he remembers what he said. Sort of. In Dean’s defense, a lot of things were going on, and Sam was possessed by Lucifer and going to die. Also, it was a long time ago. Still, he remembers the feeling. Sam was going to suffer, but Cas knew where, and Dean needed to know so he could be there.
Castiel does. Dean’s not sure how Castiel could have missed it. Cas, for all he can be recklessly brave, isn’t stupid.
The voice was Dean. His inability to say anything that matters without Death’s scythe to his neck, followed by the quiet, gentle way Cas prompts him to speak.
Dean mutters something under his breath that Sam doesn’t grab. He’s remembering Dean tucking him into bed a million years ago, realizing that Dean wasn’t even 10 the first time he put Sam to sleep alone.
Also in the safety of his own room, he lets his face glow beet red. It's not like he didn't know Cas was in love with him, he just…doesn't usually think about it much.
Cas opens his mouth to tell Sam that isn’t the problem. He knows Dean loves him. He’s known that for years. He has never doubted Dean’s love.
Dean, for want of something better to say, throws out, “And it's...edible?” because Claire and Alex are walking up, and he can’t fly apart, not where they might get caught in the debris.
Sam said something about not taking unnecessary risks. Dean responded with something glib about already outliving his “Expired By” date.
Dean stands there, suspended. He’s not one hundred percent sure when he stood up. He definitely doesn’t know when Cas got to his door.
Everyone laughs, and the conversation moves away. Dean catches Kaia and Claire texting each other a few times, which is somehow extremely cute — even with the conspiratorial grins they share. Everyone breaks up after dinner, and Dean spends a quiet evening with Jody and Donna on the porch, watching the girls run around in the lawn.
It’s a sure sign that Cas didn't actually retire to his bed last night, but instead engaged in his nighttime ritual of “observing humanity,” which actually entails flitting off to whatever insane market compels him.
Dean drains his drink, tries to think of a witty rejoinder, but his brain is stuck on, “You saved the world, now live in it,” so when he says, “You deserve it,” it ends up being a shade too honest.
“No. I’m not nervous because of the ceremony. The spell work is actually really simple.” It’s more a pooling of magic than a spell. Sam figures it could be channeled into massive power, but there’s nothing specific any of them will be trying to accomplish, so it’s more a communal meditation. Sam’s done harder spell work while being actively shot at.
Dean is not so much avoiding as he is tactfully busy. Time with Cas means stilted conversation, Dean incapable of apology, Cas sympathetic before snippish. Cas gives as good as he gets, which Dean used to enjoy, but now it feels weird. Dean keeps missing the mark, sentences expelled too softly or too angrily. He can’t get it right.
Dean also doesn’t have any good words right now that aren’t, “Please, let's do that again.”  Then, Dean realises he
He does what any sane man would do. He stuffs the paper back into his pocket, pulls out the walkman, and rewinds to the beginning of Peacock Dance.
“What?” Sam says, distracted from his thoughts by Dean’s antics. “No. Sorry, zoned out. Haven’t had coffee yet.”
He’s halfway down the hall before he’s doubling back and stuffing the walkman in his pocket, slinging the headphones around his neck. Just in case.
Dean thinks of Cas saying, “Well, I can go with you,” 100 different times, in a 100 different ways. He thinks of all the different ways that's gotten Cas killed.
. Life isn't Mamma Mia though, and there isn't a convenient musical number to help him confess, nor is there a happy ending waiting for him, so he doesn't say anything either. He reaches across the couch and squeezes Cas's left bicep like that's a replacement for everything he wants to say, and the soft smile Cas gives him after almost makes it seem like it is.
Dean pulls Baby onto the open road and lets out a breath. Her steering wheel is a comfort under his hands.
Dean stares down at the papers, wishing fervently that he could see what Cas ever saw in him. What mirage Dean destroyed.
It's the weird “eeney meeney miney moes” that click it for Dean. This song isn't about Dean. It's about
Dean almost says, “Who?” before he realises that Cas is talking about Sam and the googly eyes, not Dean and sex, because Cas thinks normal fucking thoughts. In Dean’s defense, Cas doesn’t have to
. But all he can think about is his traitorous left hand and how it always snakes out to grip Castiel's bicep when he passes. He feels like the song is in two minds. He thinks the song is kind of violent for a mixtape. He hears
“I only took people no one would miss. I’m not heartless, you know.” Isabelle drops her sheen of composure. “But you hunters clearly can’t be reasoned with.” Her eyes sharpen, bloodshot. Sometimes, monsters that can shapeshift make it difficult to recognise them as a threat. Not this time. “Drifters, bums, assholes — and, of course, hunters like you. That’s who I kill. Imbeciles who think they stand a chance against me. People with no one left and no one to look for them.” Isabelle feels like a killer.
Cassie sticks out her hand to shake Claire’s, and then Kaia’s, because Cassie never backed down from anything except Dean, and says, “I’m Cassie. Dean and I are old friends.”
She reaches out and flicks on the tape deck. Music always helps Sam — no reason it wouldn’t do the same for Dean.
She gets in her car after another few minutes of looking for answers that don’t exist in this particular ditch on the side of the road. At least the diner has excellent hamburgers.
Jack's face crumples for a second, and then his hand is sliding off Dean's bicep and around his neck as he leverages Dean into the world's most awkward hug, take 2. He mumbles a soft “okay” before laying back and settling on the bed.
He walks out over the water, stands next to his abandoned walkman, lets the 2 o’clock sun beat down on him. He wastes time till Donna’s truck pulls out of the driveway.
Dean had snapped. Just once, just one time, he’d wanted something better. He wanted someone out there to have better luck than the Winchesters. It was a world free of Chuck: why couldn’t just one fucking person have a happy ending? Why shouldn’t the twins get a chance to be okay?
It also doesn’t take too kindly to Eileen decapitating it, but Eileen is okay with that. The Marid’s opinion is hardly important to her.
In the morning, Eileen resolves to visit shelters and see if anyone knows the missing men. The police have only IDed a few of the bodies, but it’s worth a shot. Dean, hesitantly, asks if she wants company, but she waves him off. He can do his whole FBI schtick on the local police, get a look at the bodies, see if there was anything they didn’t think worth mentioning.
“Well. You can go now.” Somewhere inside his body, Dean begs his anger to give up the driver’s seat. He’s drowning under a hundred tons of liquid rage. He never had a chance.
So. Flowers. Cas gave Dean flowers. Blue flowers that look like Cas’s eyes. Cas and flowers. Cas with flowers. Cas laying in a field of flowers. Cas’s blue eyes and soft lips surrounded by these soft blue flowers, making his dark hair stand out like a smear. Cas’s long black eyelashes lifting to look up at Dean with those blue flower eyes. Cas’s hand entangled in green stems and blue flowers as he comes apart.
Dean knows where he’s going when he dies. He’s not stupid. He just doesn’t get why he keeps going there now.
Dean boggles. “So, what? You’re upset that it’s gonna be too easy? You don’t wanna go, but you don’t know how to turn him down?” Then, he continues in a distinctly mocking lilt, “You can always tell him your babysitter said you’re not allowed to be out past curfew.”
Cas might have had a response of some kind, but Dean wouldn’t know. He’s finally doing the smart thing and making a tactical retreat to the kitchen.
Dean is so tired. Exhausted. He can feel his bones. He just wants this to be done. He closes his eyes, let’s comforting black embrace him. Nestled inside Baby, carefully empty of thought, Dean sleeps.
Dean feels a wetness on his face that he resolutely ignores, but just in case, he closes eyes. A fact he’s grateful for when the song continues with
Cas flies close to Jack, smiling down, and lets himself preen Jack’s wings a bit. Jack doesn’t squirm away in embarrassment, shifting slightly to give Cas better access, so Cas wraps one of his wings around Jack’s waist. Jack is happy with who he is. So is Cas.
Here’s the thing: this is the angle Dean needed for the shot. She gets that. But a hundred million things could go wrong, and if Dean doesn’t make the shot, Eileen is dead. She can’t fight an Aswang at close range. No one can. That’s sort of their whole thing. She has her knife, and if she could catch it off guard or off balance, maybe she could reach the small of its back. Unfortunately, with the way they’ve set this up — with Isabelle fully aware why she’s there — Eileen’s shit out of luck. Isabelle may be a smug bitch, but she’s smart as hell and twice as deadly.
The cabin is loud, full of people as it is, and Dean falls asleep as soon as his head hits the pillow.
Alone with the weight of the truth that Castiel is in love with him and is just four rooms away, both in his heart and in his fucking walkman, Dean readies himself for bed.
completely tracks. Cas described being human as at once beautiful and terrifying. The strangest thing, he’d said, was the way he couldn’t perceive the light of people anymore. He had no way to orient himself. Cas had likened it to suddenly losing your senses. You knew that the world was still there, but you just couldn’t feel it.
Dean slams on the walkman headphones. Smashes play. Sits on his bed and takes breaths that are exactly 7 seconds in and 7 seconds out, perfect in their deliberacy and little else. The tape picks up where he left it, but Dean can’t hear anything over his own careful counting until he mistakenly syncs to the rhythm of Oh Honey telling him to take his time.
It’s probably because Sam isn’t here. After all, he is looking to get back to normal. Sam’s normally here.
Mostly though, there was Dean and his gun. Dean, the gun. Dean learned to shoot before he graduated elementary school. It’s been with him almost every step of the way, his one truly faithful companion. Sometimes he struggles to remember a time when he didn’t have a gun in his hand.
Dean hasn’t thought about his first hunt in years and years and years. Hasn’t thought about what his dad was saying, about turning 17 above the bodies of two nuns who dared to love each other, about the very last time he thought about another life — a different life, a safer life, a braver life. Dean never thinks about the parts of himself he lit on fire that day so that he could walk home to Sammy and his father.
Eileen and Cas seem capable of conversing one handedly, but Dean’s not sure how, so he puts his coffee mug and fork down regularly during breakfast. He enjoys chatting with Eileen anyway. They’re discussing her ideas about the case — nothing crazy — but Dean finds it weirdly fun to know that they’re having an entire conversation a half step from Sam, Cas, and Jack, and none of them have a clue. That thought quickly turns towards ideas of weird things to do to Sam’s room while Eileen has him away. Dean is figuring he’ll go classic with shaving cream in the pillow, until Eileen suggests covering everything in googly eyes.
They’re obviously close enough to hear, because Claire shouts an indignant, “Hey!” Dean shoots Sam a nonsense text asking him if the nail gun was left in the garage as they finish their approach.
Sure enough, Castiel hands over what appears to be a jar of feta in brine and a bunch of spinach. “I got these for breakfast.” Dean shrugs and switches over to making omelettes. Who is he to argue with that?
Dean’s not sure that Gladioluses come in purple, but Dean’s gonna work with what he’s got. He wanders down to the workroom, not dodging people per se, but taking the long route to avoid the sounds of Sam, Cas, Jack, and Eileen making a mess in his kitchen.
“No. You can’t.” Dean knows it hits as Cas shifts his posture, because Cas has left the building. It is Castiel, Seraphim of the Day, Shield of Heaven, brilliant rage and golden fire, who responds to Dean’s unnecessary anger. His eyes flash a bright blue that outshines the grace of Heaven itself.
The realization that if Dean revealed that it made him unhappy, Cas would stop doing it slams somewhere in Dean’s mind, and he’s too busy trying to examine if that’s real that he forgets to lie and instead says, “That’s not true.” Because it’s not. The mixtapes make Dean very happy. It's everything else that’s the problem.
The next song starts and he doesn't know it. The woman's voice is pretty, and Dean isn't really focused on the lyrics because he was honestly distracted by wondering where Castiel is finding all this music. How does he even know this artist? The song has a little techno break before the singer starts again. He flips through his pocket to find the card where Cas had diligently written the song names and artists. Who the fuck are the Chainsmokers? More importantly, how does Cas know about them?
Sometimes, in moments like this, it's hard to remember that Chuck is actually dead. Well, not Dead, but gone. Dealt with. That there is somehow a world that gets both peace and freedom. Sometimes, Dean’s only grip on reality is that he didn’t pull that trigger, and if Chuck was still riding driverseat on the road of the universe, Dean would definitely be dead. He might be in Heaven, but he’d definitely be dead. That’s the ending that Chuck wanted.
Cas is a real dick sometimes though. Is this fight Dean’s fault? Absolutely. Did he deserve Cas throwing the Ma’Lak box in his face? Also yes, but it still fucking hurt, okay?
Cas had chimed in and said, “It's also alright if you never understand this kind of love. There are many kinds of love.” Then, it was 5 minutes of Sam trying to explain asexuality to a kid for whom they'd all forgotten to explain sex.
Cas walks into a room, Dean thinks, ‘I could kiss him,’ and he’s immediately useless. Going on the hunt with Sam had been a relief purely to have a working brain for more than 2 hours.
So, Cas’s fingers curl a bit possessively around the headphones on Dean’s neck, and he steps back with a bit of a smile.
When Dean pulls away, it’s Cas who turns a brilliant red, who stutters a nonsensical sound. He looks wrecked, lips bitten and hair mussed. It’s almost easy for Dean to say, “I would also prefer that you stay.”
The shame that rests heavy in his chest isn’t because he was resilient. It’s because he doesn’t want to be.
During what should have been a completely normal check-in with Michael and Adam, Jack had then challenged Michael to a race, contesting that Cas could judge. The summons somehow escalated into a flying tournament, Cas charged with racing the finalist. Michael, who Cas had expected to refuse on principle, had been delighted by the idea and produced a bracket with surprising speed.
Jody huffs, irritated. “Oh, come on, girls. You didn’t think me and Donna just let you wander out of the house with no protection at all.”
Which brings Dean to this weekend, where he’s standing out in the bright sunshine, finishing up on building. Sam had offered to come help the first weekend, but he’d spent the whole time on the shore
“Somewhere along the way,” Cas continues, “I became yours. You reached for me when I let Lucifer in. You forgave my mistakes. You made me a part of your family. I am not a selfless creature, Dean. I have killed more to protect less.”
Dean needs to uncurl his fist, and open the fridge, and tell Sammy that it’s okay. It’s okay. Sammy, it’s okay. I’ll keep you safe, it’s okay.
“I am not a punching bag for your anger,” Cas snarls. “If you’re going to be a child,” don’t leave, don’t leave, please don’t, “I will leave.”
