Sherlock’s mouth hung open. Clearly this journal was very personal, considering the fact that Sherlock was not even aware of its existence. Had he always felt this way? Did he truly believe that Sherlock did not love him?
John laughed and bent down so that he was only inches away from his lover’s face. He gave him a kiss and was pleased when Sherlock moved to deepen it. John rose to his feet again and Sherlock was pleased to see him removing his clothes. He’d wanted John’s company since he fell ill. He was lonely and there was nothing that brought him more solace than the familiar weight of John’s arms around his waist. He was glad that John was comfortable enough with Sherlock to be naked in his presence. Sherlock had turned down his sexual advances, John had learnt he was not entirely human and was kept together by sutures, and yet still wished to love Sherlock and even share a bath with him.
John shot up from the couch and grabbed Sherlock’s carefully sculpted face in his hands. He kissed him again and again, and Sherlock resisted his urges each time he did.
“I am terribly sorry you had to undergo such misfortune, Lady Martin. My word he even looks odd - that mess of curls he wears on his head!”
John only smiled and placed a kiss to both of Sherlock’s cheeks. “Perhaps I am not the peace you crave now. Go for a walk outdoors, and then maybe, when your head is a bit clearer, you can return and we can resume our discussion.”
“Do you know what it was like? To be locked away in an asylum as a child?” Moriarty and Sherlock were now at the bottom of the falls, the roar of the water nearly overpowering his voice. Sherlock’s hands were behind his back and his face unreadable.
The blond pulled away first, his breathing rapid and unsteady. Sherlock’s eyes were half-lidded and his breaths were short but lustrous. John kissed Sherlock once more, but it was merely a peck on the lips, and then another, followed by a last one. John smirked as he watched Sherlock become even more aroused from the teasing pecks and tried as hard as he could to ignore the hardening in Sherlock’s groin, which was pressed against his leg. How long had John wanted this? To have Sherlock like this and all to himself?
Sherlock hadn’t the energy to argue with her. He hadn’t slept, nor had he the will to come up with a quick enough response. He only closed the door and returned to the desk. He placed his notes next to the tray and read them over. He had an ominous feeling that something was amiss- and there was always something. It irritated Sherlock to no end. What did he forget? What was it that kept ease out of reach? Was it the idea of stealing body parts from corpses? Or was it the very idea of creating a man? He thought that maybe he should have created a woman, make her his wife, attempt to live amongst the other nobles. But what was normalcy anyway? Yet another social construct created by the privileged who thought that everyone who didn’t abide by their impossible criteria was to be treated with scorn and malice. Sherlock rolled his eyes. He was born into said privilege, yet he was subject to its bullying. He knew the others laughed at him behind his back, Lady Martin and her group were the first to ever do it within earshot. Sherlock realized that they only treated him with a modicum of respect because he was related to Mycroft, and no one dared upset him. That never stopped them from mocking Sherlock once they left the manor.
“I will not force you to do something if it unsettles you, Sherlock. When you are ready, I will sense it and I will ask you for an answer. For now, we should enjoy one another’s company in this bath.”
“You would think that, coming from a lineage of geniuses, he would have had the sense to bring an umbrella! Look at him, he resembles that of a stray mutt.”
“You do understand his reasons for his poor behavior?” He was not excusing the way Sherlock acted while Sebastian was at Baker Street. He could not bear the thought that the love of his life and his kin could not care for each other. To his relief, Sebastian nodded and smiled.
The rope around John’s hands fell to the floor and Sherlock cringed at the red lines left on John’s perfect wrists. He picked one of the limp hands up and kissed the irritated skin.
Sherlock’s eyes looked sunken in, as if the very thought of their punishment brought him great distress.
“His diet was always poor, as well as his lifestyle. He worked himself to the point of exhaustion and would only recuperate enough to resume his duties. His way of life might have worked in his youth, but Mycroft grew older and his body was no longer as strong as it once was. He developed a cough, nothing serious, we had simply pegged it as a cold. His cough never subsided and it was upon my insistence that he sought medical attention at once. The doctor, the moronic quack, prescribed him tonics and other medicines in the hopes that they would cure his seasonal illness. He only grew worse, his cough became harsh and his body grew weaker. It was not until he coughed blood that he returned to the doctor. He had Consumption. It buggered his lungs, making it harder for him to breathe. He was bedridden until the time of his death, and due to the nature of the illness, I was not allowed to see him.”
Sherlock placed a hand on his chest and mustered the politest smile he could. “He is a family friend.”
His voice cracked, and Sherlock picked up the paper that he had bought at the station. John’s pleading voice wrenched at Sherlock’s soul and he never wished to hear that desperate tone or the soft crack of his voice. Sherlock had found a page in the crime section that interested him and began reading it. He had not reached the second paragraph of the story before John whispered, “What are you reading?”
“I must say, I was rather nervous when my man struck you. There was blood and,” He stopped to put on a disgusted expression,” it was an absolute mess.”
“Give me your arm, Sebastian.” Ah, there was fear in his eyes. His suspicions were confirmed. The poor man.
John clapped his hands together. “Would you care for company on this walk, or would you prefer to be alone?”
He wanted to shout at her, saying that the Vermeer didn't belong to her, didn't belong to anyone, but provoking her with semantics seemed unwise.
“Why not?” Sherlock brushed the flowers and mice off the table, no longer concerned with gloves now that the mice were dead.
and bigger things like shouted warnings to duck from a murderer's bullet. But those commands had always been uttered with the great understood that John would obey them. This was something different. This was unsure, and this had absolutely nothing to do with the case. Commands were always related to the cases or the mundane. He didn't know
“You never struck me as an impressionism person, really. I thought you were more suited to Sargent, or someone like him. Artists who paint people instead of places. You always did care more about the people than anything else.”
He would have to be more careful; he couldn't just leave the painting in an open suitcase, poorly concealed.
. You were dead!” He hushed himself, words coming out in a hiss to avoid them coming out in a scream in the cool silence.
Mary walked up, handing him a glass of champagne. “You know, just because we're both here, sort of together, it doesn't mean that we're actually together.”
John smiled at him as he walked into the living room of Baker Street. He was seated comfortably in his usual chair, reading, and his eyes seemed to flood with relief to see Sherlock returned in one piece. Sherlock threw his coat over the hook on the door as he briefed John on all that had occurred. John listened with his usual attentiveness, Sherlock moving to sit across from him in his own chair, steepling his fingers and quirking a smile at John's praise and concern. The most amazing thing about John Watson, Sherlock thought, was that even though the world was moving around them, John made it feel stilled just by his presence. No special ability needed. His calming influence always spread over Sherlock in such a way that he didn't feel the need to halt the world. John grounded him and stilled him enough.
John thought little of the world as a whole sometimes, and given his situation, no one would have faulted him for this being one of those times. But Molly had a sort of infectious innocent optimism about her that made it more difficult for him to be bitter and scared.
“Oh, well, it was one of my parents' favorite movies. Harry and I saw a lot of it when we were growing up.”
I don't care if you don't want to. Just do it.” Sherlock raised a gloved hand to push John's hand away, but stopped when John spoke again. “
“There is nothing rational about this!” Whatever had made him resigned, even scared earlier, had vanished. “I'm not going to kill you, Sherlock! I'm not!”
John shrugged. “It's just nice to be able to talk to someone and actually know who you're talking to, Sherlock. Sometimes I wonder. I remember the way people talked about you back home. They never had anything nice to say about you, but I'm wondering why. You haven't given me any indication you're a bad person. A lot to put up with, maybe, but not bad.”
When the moon was already high in the sky, he heard the noises below him. He craned his neck to see over the edge, and immediately jerked his head back out of sight. He clamped a hand over his mouth, trying to muffle his own breathing. Below him, a pack of tributes had come in from the direction opposite the mines. He couldn't hear them all that well from so high up, but they talked amongst themselves for quite a while, and then he realized they had set up camp for the night. After nearly an hour, John had enough courage to try and look over the ledge again, and sure enough, one tribute stood watch over his sleeping comrades down in the hollow. John sat back, cursing to himself under his breath as he added another layer of medication onto his shoulder. Of all the places in these goddamn woods, they had had to choose this one. He only prayed they didn't find him. It felt like a cruel cosmic joke, to escape death once that day and to have it resting below him that night.
was on shelves. How do you break the hearts of the people in the room by saying, “There's nothing, and might never be again.” He didn't want to frighten them. Especially given that he doubted this writer's block was permanent. In all likelihood, he would find another story soon enough. But for the time being, the very idea of trying to write another book sounded agonizing. As far as he was concerned, his last book was
“I don't think it's a matter of opinion. Empirically, you are attractive. It isn't a complex observation. At least four women have stolen glances at you since we walked in here, and a few men as well.” John opened his mouth to speak, but Sherlock cut him off. “I don't have any romantic attachments because they get in the way.”
On days like that, he turned to other things to make the stillness more bearable than the whirling motions real life. Drugs were easy enough to obtain when one could pluck them right from the dealer's pocket. But part of him knew he wouldn't last long if he continued like that.
“It's the only way I can see these things in London. How can I figure any of this out without proper observation, and how can I do that in a city with so many lights that the sky hardly exists at all?”
Sherlock was quiet for a while, and John was nearly convinced he'd gotten through to him. But then he said, “But the potential for delayed effects –”
“Then why not get rid of it entirely? We could just move in together. We've been dating long enough. Most couples would have already moved in.”
“John, I believe you are one of the few who was unaware that we were involved with this case,” he said, handing John one of the folders, “given how many unsavory characters have moved in around you two lately. Opportunists, assassins, very questionable individuals.”
John glanced over at Sherlock, who had lit a Bunsen burner and was about to hold a test tube over it. “No, no, put it down.”
“I thought you were dead, Sherlock,” John said quietly. “It was the most miserable thing I've ever dealt with. I'm glad you're back, really, but you nearly killed me.”
Sherlock’s eyes snapped from his vials to Stamford, scanning for evidence that the comment had been a disguised insult. But then his mouth quirked into that hinted smile that was little more than a softening of his features, then he spun back to his work with a dismissive wave of his hand. “Well, if you find anyone
“Boring. Please do not waste your time citing meaningless examples. Displaying sentiment is occasionally useful. Colleagues, acquaintances, ‘friends’ are convenient. How many times must I tell you—”
For his part, when attention returns to the woman Watson quickly relinquishes his position of power, lowering himself to his knees and offering her comfort. It is true that he stands again when Holmes reveals that she married her fiancee in secret and thus will gain financially from his death, and the woman’s despairing glance at Watson as she finds herself overhung now by four men is a little heartbreaking. But it is worth noting that in the wake of the revelation of her low class-status, former jail-time, and secret marriage, he finds no satisfaction or even complacency in her apparent guilt, insisting despite Lestrade’s assertion that one get’s used to these sorts of things: “I still think it’s a tragedy.”
Sherlock hasn’t turned to look at John, he is staring across the room at a blank spot on the wall, but now he is speaking (
) Sherlock rolls out from under the bed, hoping to make it to the door unseen, unheard. He’ll tell John the truth, won’t hide anything (his heart stutters on
It’s a miracle that the plan is working this well, that Sherlock is actually standing on the edge of the roof, Mycroft’s lackeys poised for action below, Moriarty bleeding behind him. Well, that last is a mixed blessing. Yesterday he’d have thought that would be a best-case scenario, but if the man hadn’t gone and shot himself in the head he could have called off the snipers and maybe . . .
Stamford nodded and moved into the kitchen, where he filled two glasses with tapwater. Returning to the living room he handed one to John, forcing him to release a tightly clenched fist. John nodded, took a sip. With a distinct sense of deja vu, Stamford sat beside him.
. And so with a sudden impulse of duplicity that was almost viscerally unnatural, Stamford announced that he’d left his phone in his coat, feeling his eyes cast down guiltily as he spoke. Oh, but the attempt paid off magnificently, for after a beat John Watson—the man who for the past half-hour couldn’t sacrifice his privacy far enough to look Stamford in the eye—was actually offering the mad detective his phone.
But now Sherlock bloody Holmes is at it again. Just when it matters most, when everything is fear and shadows and John desperately wants to be present, to help and protect.
I am aware that this is somewhat long for a single installment of a 41-part meta series. It should naturally become more succinct after the groundwork has been laid, but I'm also still considering taking out the "my story" and/or "highlights" portions. If you have an opinion on the matter I'd love to hear it in the comments. Thanks!!
I confess that when it comes to Holmes stories I tend to neglect the cases in favor of examining character and relationship dynamics. Certainly I didn’t think I had anything interesting to say about the case in this episode apart from the ways it continues to reveal aspects of this Holmes and Watson’s relationship. But as I watched it again, I realized that I had nearly missed out on one of the best parts of the episode. For although this case is not in itself especially compelling, its framing contextualizes Holmes and Watson as not merely crime-solvers, but as defenders of the innocent and the unheard.
My theory, counterintuitive though it may seem, is that Lestrade is the sort of man Watson believes he ought to be. I think there is evidence that this Watson, regardless of his actual personality and inclinations, thinks he ought to be a traditionally proper English gentleman. Throughout the show he continually protests Holmes’s eccentricities, and yet far from meaningfully attempting to abate or escape them, he not infrequently joins in wholeheartedly. To me, this seems indicative of a pattern: in this series Holmes and Watson are both eccentric madmen, but whereas Holmes is perfectly comfortable with the fact, Watson has put effort into appearing ‘normal’ and ‘correct’, and periodically struggles to maintain or reclaim that image—both in the eyes of others and himself.
Looking back, he supposes that was the moment that made it all possible: the moment that established, if not exactly a friendship, than a mutually content tolerance between Mike Stamford and the detective Sherlock Holmes. Stamford didn’t run when Sherlock entered the lab, and Sherlock ignored his existence. Particularly discouraging days were often improved by Sherlock's delight over the success of an experiment, and occasional bouts of loneliness were assuaged by the man’s quiet mutterings and habit of exploding into the room with a bag of severed thumbs and morbid glee.
John grips his hair with both hands and yanks, hard, vaguely aware that he is fighting off panic. Because Mrs. Hudson is dying, alone, and he has to go to her this instant, but four steps away his best friend is hiding an intense grief as some fucking terrifying coping mechanism, and instead of offering comfort John has just insulted him in the worst way he knew how.
Stamford’s colleagues, convinced that Sherlock had no capacity for emotion, or at least had a thoroughgoing lack of empathy, would have been incredulous if Stamford had attempted to communicate these moments. But if there is one conviction on which Stamford would stake his honor (were he prone to dramatics), it would be this: everyone has masks. And those who seem most transparent are often those who have put the most desperate effort into keeping it intact.
In one sense, Stamford was quite right. The man is strange. He is also intriguing, infuriating, compelling. He does the oddest things, things which by their nature invite query, and yet by all appearances he does not expect to be questioned. It all makes sense in his mind, and apparently he expects that to be sufficient cause for everyone else to take it in stride. That isn’t to say he doesn’t love sharing his discoveries; he’ll regale you to death with the results of his experiments with obscure Egyptian poisons. But if you ask why the deuce he put the stuff
Barts’s employees were not the only ones who were frightened. Sherlock was in a state Stamford had not yet witnessed: frantic and harried. Vials and instruments trembled visibly when the detective held them. Once he dropped a chemical-filled beaker, and for a few long seconds he stilled, blinking uncomprehendingly at the scattered shards. Then he jerked back to the table and resumed his uncoordinated endeavors.
“I love you,” he says, and for the first time the words are not meticulously controlled, for the first time they are not too quiet. They never will be again.
Of course, this mental assertion and the detachment Sherlock must project for John’s benefit might be a bit more convincing if Sherlock wasn't gripping the chair arms with whitened knuckles.
You see, it’s not the most ‘accurate’ take on Holmes. This show is less a balanced representation than an intentional counterbalance. Essentially, Sheldon Reynolds looked at the way other adaptations lent into the darkness and went, ‘well that’s all very well, but what if we drew everyone’s attention to the fact that Holmes is a over-dramatic playful nerd?’ And you don’t have to take my word for it, because he said so himself: “[while reading
This series doesn’t always display that level of social critique, and Lestrade, who generally assumes the role of good-hearted buffoon that this Watson has mercifully vacated, doesn’t always appear in a negative light. But I love that the first episode is structured to emphasize that Holmes and Watson aren’t heroes merely because they have unique levels of intelligence and physical capability, but also because their love of truth and their compassion serve as protection against prejudice, complacency, and pride.
And in that moment Sherlock solves the puzzle he had been unable to identify, and he knows the pain of loss, and he understands the shame he had tried to lock so deeply away.
As will become apparent, in this fic I am writing Watson as gay, not bi. As I general rule I definitely read Watson as bi, so I hesitated over this choice. However, in the 1954 adaptation Watson's statements of romantic/physical attraction to women are so entirely performative, and he is so deeply uncomfortable with actual interactions that imply romantic involvement with women, that reading him as gay felt truer to this series.
) has been wheeled, curiously ignored by the hospital staff. His head is between his knees, and he focuses his weak energy on trying not to see, think, feel, putting every thing on hold until he knows for certain; but he sees nothing except the bloody, limp, empty shell of the most vibrantly alive man he has ever known, and he hears nothing but those words, “It’s a trick. Just a magic trick.” Sherlock had spoken them once and John had dismissed them entirely, believing them to be part of the nonsense about Sherlock being a fake, but then Sherlock had repeated the words, and there was something so urgent in his tone that all at once it gave birth to a desperate, angry hope.
His defense mechanisms had shifted, Stamford realized. Or perhaps he simply no longer had the energy for his old ones. Every now and then he seemed to be making a vague attempt at his old cheery demeanor, but all he could really manage was straight-backed tight-lipped stoicism. He would not meet Stamford’s eye for more than a moment. He transparently wished to get away, to be alone. Stamford wondered whether the very fact that John had allowed Stamford to see him in the past made him appear all the more threatening now.
About a month later they did go out for drinks. John’s eyes met Stamford’s, and they were empty. Stamford clasped his hand silently and ordered them beer. They sat in the bar for an hour. Not speaking. Not hiding.
And yet . . . everyone has masks. And nothing does a number on those masks like being with a lover. Sometimes the mask increases in detail and intensity, because the stakes of being seen are so much higher. In better instances the mask is all but removed, when couples have let one another see and found that everything was alright, somehow. Even outside the charged atmosphere of romance, it takes a consummate actor indeed not to shift the disguise with a shift of company—to increase or decrease or alter it—and, and … well, there should be some difference between the way she behaved around her lover and around a casual acquaintance, dammit!
Tentatively, the boring, predictable, trusted man lifted his hand and rested it lightly on his friend’s shoulder.
Stamford just hoped the performance was for his benefit, and that John dropped it when alone with Mary, at least sometimes.
That was a strange thought. "The worst"? Obviously Moriarty and the maybe dying part is the worst; alienating John is just a necessary side effect. Stupid brain. He clearly hasn’t filed all those emotions correctly and his mind is misinterpreting them.
I confess that when it comes to Holmes stories I tend to neglect the cases in favor of examining character and relationship dynamics. Certainly I didn’t think I had anything interesting to say about the case in this episode apart from the ways it continues to reveal aspects of this Holmes and Watson’s relationship.

For although this case is not in itself especially compelling, its framing contextualizes Holmes and Watson as not merely crime-solvers, but as defenders of the innocent and the unheard.
something had happened—that first time he told himself that it was alright, that he just needed to trust Sherlock. But of course he remembered the cabby, the speckled pill hovering before those sensitive lips, and he knew that he would indeed trust Sherlock with the protection of almost anything of real value, anything at all except himself.
Before that day I knew well enough that Holmes valued my company. He was, after all, continually requesting my presence on his excursions, if not simply assuming I would follow him. And I knew I had occasionally been of use. But, though I flatter myself I hid any insecurities rather well, it isn’t easy to feel really useful when your partner is a genius. For him to announce that he really did depend on my skills, that my competence was a factor in his plans—well, let’s just say there’s a reason I can still recite his little speech word-for-word.
Following the title sequence (a simple and heartwarming scene of Holmes and Watson walking as close as possible down the street followed by a still of their coats hanging together next to a lamp), the episode begins with Watson gazing cheerily out a cab window while his voiceover narrates his return from war and pleasure at being back in London. It is clear at once that the series intends to elide the depression and ill-health that burdens Watson in canon—a passing mention of “long and difficult times” and the trials of war are all but forgotten.
Despite the long Christmas (and post-Christmas) break, I am still working on this series! I wasn't particularly looking forward to writing this chapter, in part because I didn't think I had much to say about it. But a lack of conciseness has never been one of my more pressing issues, and so this chapter became a somewhat lengthy analysis of Watson's character in this series. Enjoy!!
About four months in, after John wrote about that insane Moriarty adventure, something shifted. Sherlock came more often to the lab, but his focus seemed scattered, his anger at failed tests more frequent then they had been since Stamford guided John through that lab door. It made Stamford anxious at first—perhaps John hadn’t taken kindly to being strapped to a bomb? But the ability of the occasional text to calm Sherlock’s moods and make his face soften with a tenderness that would have shocked anyone else at Barts soon assured him that John’s reaction to the incident was not the root of the issue.
He knew what was wanted. John Watson sitting in his space, unmasked and silent, was a long unseen but achingly familiar image. Unfortunately for Stamford’s unobtrusive good sense, these two seem to have done a number on his impulse control.
“John,” Sherlock has turned towards John and is stepping slowly forward, “if I wasn’t everything that you think I am, everything that I think I am, would you still want to help me?”
Sometimes they start tearing at my tongue and my subcutaneous skin at the oddest times: when you’re sulking like a five-year-old and petulantly tug your dressing gown tighter across your chest, or when a case has you really and truly stumped and you’re staring at the evidence with your head cocked just slightly and the faintest pout on your lips. And I pretend not to notice while I declare,
Sherlock stares at John’s lifted face, exploring it with a new freedom, “I—I was smelling your bed.” A smile quirks at the edge of his mouth, the joy finally beginning to settle in, because parse John’s words however he might, he can find no way to understand them except as everything he wants them to be.
) and Sherlock has to keep him far enough away so that he doesn’t see, and as Sherlock dials his number he thinks,
I hardly know whether I feel guilty or nostalgic for that time. The fact is that I often put us in a tight spot when I might have summoned the police instead, simply because after so many years of working alone I delighted in the phenomena of just the two of us facing all comers. I wanted to put on a properly staged performance for Watson as I unveiled the solution, and I was (and am) perhaps overly fond of watching his competence in facing any difficulty. That isn’t to say I was exactly comfortable when guns came into play, but I quickly realized that with a flow of deductions I could keep the criminal’s attention and weapon trained on myself, giving Watson the space to employ a strategy and disarm them. Even on Watson’s off days, such as that time he took to believing in corporeal ghosts, any lingering anxiety caused by the volatility of firearms was far outweighed by the blithe and intoxicating certainty that my Watson would get us out of it somehow. And he did. He always has.
Sherlock turned away, but not before his eyes fell shut and tight lines tracked his face. “No, he doesn’t.”
John and Sherlock would be a cacophonous pair, but with a heap of luck and the one gargantuan moment of courage it would require for one of them to actually bloody communicate, they just might be transcendent.
So Stamford was pleased but not at all surprised by these small vulnerabilities, even if he suspected that he was privy to them only because Sherlock had forgotten his presence entirely. It was not until three weeks later, the day Sherlock stilled and gazed at nothing with an expression that might almost be described as wistful, only to catch his eye and quirk the bare hint of a smile, that Stamford realized he wasn't being accidentally let in to these moments—he was being allowed.
Fifteen minutes later they were seated in Regents Park with ceramic coffee cups, and it was transparently clear that John Watson was not fine.
• Like I said, this show doesn’t take itself too seriously. It is unabashedly delighted with its characters and its world, and if you’re looking for angst, this isn’t the place—although be prepared to be smacked with a rush of emotion when you least expect it.
And Mary herself? Her manner was cheery and charming and intelligent and kind, and Stamford could not for the life of him explain why she put him on edge. Then John was called off for an emergency shift at the hospital and Mary stayed a half-hour longer, and she didn’t change. Not one whit.
and Guy Ritchie Watsons. I haven’t decided the extent to which I read canon Watson in a similar manner, but the potential for such a reading is there in the way he paints himself as a deeply normal man while engaging in highly abnormal behavior.
If nothing else I ought to have noticed the way I had already fallen into treating him as a partner. It was he to whom I addressed my observations, he to whom I turned for a second opinion, he who I kept by my side when I wanted Lestrade out of the way. And when I accused the criminal in the absence of the police, I was factoring his skill and steadiness into that choice. I think that if anything had happened to him, even then, I might never have stopped feeling an inexplicable void in the space where I nearly had a trusted partner.
” John is shouting now, standing practically knee-to-knee with Sherlock, and in the quarter of his brain that is still functioning, Sherlock is really quite proud of himself for maintaining his indifferent exterior. John continues: “I’m not sure how much of that care extends towards me”—
And indeed, the tone of the room does shift the moment they enter. Whereas the previous occupants seemed primarily interested in flinging accusations at the woman, Holmes’s first move is to examine the scene for evidence. Intentionally or not, in doing so he draws attention away from the now sobbing woman, allowing her a moment to compose herself.
He mutters “sleep” and sits on a hard chair and lays his head on his forearms on the hard countertop. Sleep really would be best—Sherlock clearly isn’t in the mood for teamwork, and the best John can do is be rested enough to be alert and ready when the time comes.
I confess I was … inattentive when I first met John Watson. In my defense, I genuinely believed that I had made a discovery which would revolutionize police work, and so I had—it made a real difference once the blockheads at Scotland Yard finally paid it proper attention. Besides, my Watson can only manage one role, but in portraying that character he has proved is a consummate actor—not least because he’s half convinced himself of the act. By all appearances he is a dime-a-dozen hearty British gentleman, complete with good old-fashioned English values. The fact that he is a rebel who only needs a proper goal before he abandons all the conventions of his performative conservatism is a secret so well kept that some who have known him all his life have no inkling of it. So really, I couldn’t be expected to—
He is standing so very close, face hovering above John’s, and John is pressing against the door, terrified now he has felt just how completely Sherlock is capable of tearing him apart, yet his response is unconsidered, inevitable: “what do you need?”
Stamford ducked his head to hide a smile. He supposed he ought to but offended, but that was the closest he’d ever heard the detective come to issuing a compliment, and so he determined to accept the intent and not quibble about the result.
As a result of this framing, Holmes and Watson are not primarily up against the supposed stupidity of the police-force. The real obstacles are class prejudice, laziness, pride, and a base pleasure in wielding power over the weak. During this case what is needed is not only or even primarily their intelligence, but rather their fair-mindedness and their empathy.
• 20:17–21:36: Honestly, few scenes better encapsulate this iteration of the duo than Holmes proposing illegal means of investigation and Watson objecting every step of the way without once raising a finger to stop Holmes or remove himself from the situation.
“I used to think maybe that was true, that you just don’t care. But I have been objective and scientific. I have explored every angle, every explanation, every alternative, and the only possible conclusion is that
Mourning—less expected. No point in mourning his own death; can’t be that. Must be that if he survives he will be leaving the city he knows, with the comfort of the streets and the shops and the . . . the people he can navigate without pause, without anxiety. This emotion is harder to keep put; but he places as much as he can manage next to files containing his confidence in his skill set and his ability to learn a location quickly, and after a minute decides he’s filed enough to get on with.
• While I personally find most of this show’s flaws to be part of its charm or at least easily ignored, it does occasionally announce itself as a product of its time in a decidedly unfortunate manner. With one glaring exception it’s treatment of women tends towards the progressive, but I’m afraid I’ve nothing positive to say of its portrayal of race—its glaring whiteness is only occasionally altered by painfully stereotyped side-characters.
He told himself that he was being arrogant and ridiculous. He is no savant of human nature, and Mary was consistently entertaining and nice to the barista and sent out none of those warning signs one is alert for in the partners of one’s friends. He’d been delighted when John was infatuated with bloody madman Sherlock Holmes, for god’s sake, and now he’s taking issue with this sane and inoffensive woman? Nonsense.
Stamford ducked his head to hide his grin, planning a quick escape before incredulous gossip invaded the momentary silence of the lunchroom and diluted his pleasure. Abruptly the silence was broken by a tremulous, truncated cheer, and the whole room turned with surprise to gaze at the timid mortuary attendant, whose face was quickly turning cherry-red. Feeling grateful and a bit obligated, but with his cheeks already heating with pre-emptive embarrassment, Stamford gathered his courages and claimed the stares with his own rather pitiful “hurrah,” before resuming his plans to beat a hasty retreat. But his movements were arrested a second time when a third voice took up the shout, and in a few moments the entire room was cheering and laughing and saying “I told you so.”
(why do I always insult you in the same breath that I declare my love? I suppose it’s because if I don’t call you moron or idiot I’ll call you beautiful or precious or mine).
Yet here I was, having lived with a fellow-madman for less than a week, and my facades were crumbling. I was badgering my flatmate into making an impromptu trip to Sussex because an interesting murder had been committed, assuming my presence would be wanted, and reciting train schedules as dutifully as good little boys recite the Bible. My lifelong disguise was evaporating, and the terror of being discovered at long last was being countered by laughter.
• 12:33–13:00: Although it ultimately has little bearing on the case, I appreciate that Watson’s medical skills are immediately made use of.
but Sherlock is so very alive and John feels his face screw tight in an ineffectual attempt to hold back tears.
—Sherlock waits until John has taken one step beyond him so that he doesn’t have to see his face, then he darts his hand back and gently grasps John’s wrist.
Because now he heard John’s footstep ascending towards the room, Sherlock hadn’t noticed the sounds of him entering the flat, and it was too late to escape—
He hadn’t meant it. Or maybe had, he doesn’t know. He just knows he’s sodding terrified, because if Sherlock Holmes doesn’t care about Martha Hudson, he doesn’t care about anybody. Certainly not about John. And if Sherlock doesn’t care about John, what’s to keep him from up and leaving one day when he feels like it, because he’s bored or because it’s
But Stamford is a practical man, and in a moment he was considering the best way forward. How was one supposed to respond to the resurrection of a casual acquaintance for whom one has somewhat more affection than the number of words exchanged appears to merit? Then Sherlock had glanced in his direction, flinching visibly and looking quickly away when he met Stamford’s eyes. That’s what had decided him. Sherlock no doubt had and would face an overflow of dramatic scenes in the wake of his return, and while the man may deserve it, Stamford had no desire to be the arbitrator of a justice that the world would so unstintingly provide.
“You are correct. I am not cutting myself off from the people I care about, because I do not have people I care about.”
Because that’s one of the many the beauties of their relationship: Holmes frees Watson from the endless task of conforming, and his genuine self is far better than any cheap imitation. And while I didn’t get into in this write-up, Watson returns the favor by loving Holmes as he is while curbing his more dangerous exterminates and keeping him grounded and present. Also in this episode he’s already 2-for-2 saving Holmes’s life and property and they’re just so good for each other and I love them.
Of course, it would take an extraordinary individual to not only receive but also return the love of a man like Sherlock Holmes. Certainly no one who had met him here would do. Any by the by, which genders would he be open to falling for? Statistically speaking female was more likely, but although he didn’t put much stock in stereotypes the man exhibited certain mannerisms which . . .
Sherlock Holmes was dead. The news spread through the lunch room, and silence spread with it. Later there would be discussions, defenses and ‘I told you so's,’ but today all was quiet. It was the one comfort of that horrid day: for all their griping, because of John Watson the employees of Bart’s Hospital had been rooting for Sherlock Holmes.
• 24:42–25:36: Two days in and Watson has already appointed himself Holmes’s knight in shining armor, defender of his honor. I love him.
And Sherlock steps yet closer, eyes searching John’s, desperate, pleading, and little baffled: “You.”
At the time, Stamford found the whole thing rather ridiculous. For the first time in his life he’d taken it into his head that he’d like to play matchmaker, and then had been all but commissioned to do so, and yet all he could do was sit on a park bench and think that even if Sherlock wasn’t Sherlock, Stamford is Stamford, and that was sufficient to put the nail in the coffin of this endeavor before it began.
Sherlock stood on the roof of Bart's with Moriarty. His head was spinning. How had it come to this? Over the last day, he'd had to reevaluate his entire plan for his life, and for John's. Moriarty had ruined everything.
It wasn't even a full minute before Sherlock noiselessly appeared, sitting beside him. He offered no comment, but followed the line of John's gaze. John was sure Sherlock had known why he'd come out here, but he had never pegged Sherlock for someone to watch the skies for the list of the dead.
He wondered briefly if he'd left his phone in the living room, thinking that if anyone was trying to reach him that they would have no luck. He had no intention of leaving this bed anytime soon, no plan for being more than arm's length away from the sleeping man beside him. This was heaven, this was shelter, this was comfort. And as he fell asleep, finally resting untouched from awful dreams, he thought that
It was an evening opening, winter making the world full dark early on. John took his time walking through the museum, looking at all the works, not just those lucky enough to be in the same room as the Vermeer. The white walls of the Hickman were almost clinical when combined with the cool air.
The whole time, he kept the gun at the ready in his hand, but with an apathetic looseness to his grip.
When he finally tried to force his eyes open, he found that he couldn't, and was instantly struck with panic. He heard his pulse rise on the monitor and he tried to force himself to calm down. Why couldn't he open his eyes? Suddenly, the blackness that had at first been so soothing was now a gaping abyss, and he was trapped in it.
Once or twice, though, he looked as if he almost hoped Sherlock would confirm whatever nagging visions of the night he had, like he was looking for an out. But Sherlock never did.
Sitting alone in a military camp in Afghanistan many days later, John shut his eyes, and thought to himself, Please let the world stop again. He didn't believe it was that simple, but when he opened his eyes, his friends were still, caught mid-laughter across the camp from him. He shook his head in disbelief. He had never been one to doubt that there was more to his world than he knew, but he never imagined he would be such a part of it.
Sherlock shook his head. There was a small puncture wound on his palm, bleeding. “Thorns,” he said, nodding toward the flowers. When John took a closer look, he saw them. They could be easily missed, not so obvious as rose thorns. Sherlock hadn't been paying enough attention.
“He was out behind the police blockade, watching everything that night at the Hickman, when the police were trying to defuse the second bomb.”
Sherlock stared at John a moment longer before walking a few steps closer to the falls, slowly. He looked over them, at the faint outline of Jim's body below. If he hit the rocks just right...
Sherlock had only been in Baker Street for a few days, although Mycroft ensured that it felt like longer to the humans who were now officially Sherlock's “friends” and business associates. Sherlock had decided on being a detective, since Mycroft had insisted he have a job like everyone else. Sherlock had taken some joy in how displeased his brother had been with his career choice.
Mrs. Hudson had been informed before, so when the two of them arrived home, all was quiet. Sherlock said that she had screamed, but was glad he was back, and that Henry had been especially glad to see him.
John laughed a little. They were quiet for a while. "Sherlock...tell me something. Is there honestly a chance that once these bandages come off that I still won't be able to see?"
He saved the face for last. The face was where he could make one error and ruin everything. He added some final touches to the hair, appropriately tousled, and then slowly set about breathing life into the face of John.
“Besides, we don't even know which OR they took him to,” Lestrade said in a hushed whisper like a disciple in a church.
“Yes, perfectly all right. Just –” It should have been so easy. But all Sherlock could do was shake his head. “Lightning. Not helping my head.”
Try as he might, John still couldn't manage to breathe slowly, every breath coming out ragged, ripping through him with a tightness he hadn't felt since his nightmare flashbacks after the Hickman. “I hope Mycroft makes her disappear.”
Sherlock shrugged. “Say what you will. People can never keep secrets from me, anyway. I find out everything eventually, not out of wanting to pry, mind you, but out of inevitability. But if you'd like to insist that you have no interesting qualities or experiences, by all means, Dr. Watson, continue.”
Sherlock looked at the two hands. The berries were identical, as far as he could tell. He hated his mind, half focusing on the old man's “sponsor,” instead of focusing on the task at hand. He had always had a brilliant mind, but he was also always under ideal conditions.
John shut down, became a soldier again, and blindly lunged for the fire iron by the hearth and with a fierce swing brought it crashing down on Mary's skull.
“I'm curious about one of the lines. 'It was a bond of union when I found that he was as friendless as I.' Surely there's a story there, yes? Who inspired that line of thinking? Who was the real life equivalent that surely elicited such a reaction? Was that your own experience in academia?”
. What Mary couldn't understand, what John had only just realized the night before, was that Sherlock hadn't found an act for the sake of bettering his own chances of survival. He'd found an act that would better John's.
"No, don't give me that, Greg! We both know it's not true! I don't know why he said it, but it's a lie!"
“Try and keep that attitude under wraps in the Capitol during the interviews. No one will like it.” Sherlock let out an irritated sigh. “It's my job to try and make them like you. If you want to be the first one dead in the arena, then that's your business.” She paused, looking him over, considering. “Maybe we can find a way to play up the intelligence angle. It's sexy, when you're not insulting someone. I'll see what I can come up with. Just try not to alienate anyone in the time being.”
"They had never really stood a chance.  Even if you spent your whole life in your district, never reaped, and even rarer, never starving, you still never really stood a chance."
anywhere. It was more of a stride. John watched his performance. He could easily tell how fake it was, but if the shouts were any indication, the audience couldn't. But Sherlock was clearly wearing his public face, and it was so different from the one John had grown used to.
“I'm so glad you were at the Hickman. I know it was a terrible thing to live through, but I'm glad.”
John suddenly realized how quickly he was breathing, how panicked he must have sounded. “Yes. You could say that.”
Sherlock insisted John sleep the first shift later that night. While it was true that he was more used to sleep deprivation than John, that had little to do with his offer. It took some convincing, but finally John agreed to at least try to sleep for a few hours. He gave Sherlock the gun after making sure he knew how to shoot it.
“I wasn't sure what he wanted to happen to the ring,” John said, gesturing at it where it sat on the tabletop, “but I thought there would be someone around here who would know.”
The greenhouse was quiet this late, though in truth it was quiet during daylight hours too. But somehow the night made the silence feel imposed. Every small noise was magnified, even the lightest footfall scraping in discord over the ground. Sherlock usually avoided the greenhouses at such hours. They unnerved him. But tonight the house proved more nagging and terrible than the greenhouses ever could.
“Anyway, they were definitely dead. One of them had a spear sticking out of him. And they were on the sky last night, when they showed the people who had died.”
When they got to their suite, Sherlock immediately set out a bowl of water from the kitchenette, and then made a quick call requesting food and supplies. He looked after the Irish Setter so fondly that all John could do was stand in the living room and stare blankly.
They sat against the cave wall, a few feet away from each other. Night fell so early that it felt later than it really was, and neither of them could manage to fall asleep. But it was the safest John had felt since entering the arena. He could almost believe the lie of safety here.
Sherlock wanted to go straight to him, wrap his arms around him, prove that he was real, but he was terrified that if he did that John would not react well. So he stood there in the doorway, tense and ready to bolt.
One weekend when she wanted to see him, he told her he was busy Saturday night, that he was going to an exhibition opening.
“About me. Unlike you, my brother could not keep secrets from our parents, nor did he care to or make any effort to do so.”
their names, don't you?” Sherlock shot a glare at him as the doors to the lab swung open. “Hey, Molly. How are you doing?”
A whistling shot by his ear, followed by the clatter of the spear skidding across the stone. He could hear her footsteps, competing with his own, a guttural sound escaping her throat and echoing in the canyon around them.
"Because it's none of your business, Lestrade. Besides, don't you have a murder to solve?" The DI glared at the detective. "Your presence here is not required."
When John looked back up, Sherlock was watching him carefully. “You helped save my life. Then you understand that at the interviews, I was attempting to, in some small part, repay the favor. Every audience is full of potential sponsors looking for their favorite tribute. Of course, the unfortunate reality of it is that we still aren't likely to survive this.”
“I almost was, once. I think they herded someone toward me. But I got out in time. I had another knife, but I dropped it when I was running. They took it, but I got everything else out. I waited for a few hours, to make sure it was safe to come back. It's a nice spot. You wouldn't be able to find it easily unless you were led here. Otherwise, chances of just stumbling across it are slim.”
Evidently, he was the kind of man who wanders around London at night trying to make his brain fall quiet.
The question was only whether they called it off because they were successful, or because they weren't.
Sherlock smirked. He had heard from Irene on occasion since the incident in Karachi. Any time he would get one of her texts – he still never replied to them – he would consider telling John that she was alive. Sherlock still loved that John had tried to protect him. But he was convinced that if he brought up Irene that it would only lead to a very intense fight between the two of them, and Sherlock didn't want to ruin John's mood. Especially not during Christmas.
He turned into the living room. Sherlock sat on a sofa, still and staring straight ahead of himself as he had on the train. He was as neat as ever, not a hair out of place, but he hadn't bothered to change out of pajamas, and the hollows of his cheekbones seemed more pronounced than usual.
“I won't even ask what that entails, since I know you won't tell me.” Sherlock expected the phrase to be terse and passive-aggressive, but when he darted his eyes away from the street outside to look at John, he seemed completely unfazed.
SH: Anything can be a waste. No writing has intrinsic value, only extrinsic, the value that readers assign to it.
“I hate being out of London, I hate the prospect of dealing with this family bullshit, I hate not being able to get any sleep, I hate the quiet, I hate the dark, and I hate being far away from you.”
“Well, at least half of those people are imbeciles, if they're anything like the ones I've had to talk to since you've been away. Oh god, the woman's name is Pussy Galore. John, why on earth are you familiar with this movie?”
He probably shouldn't have come at all, but the shop was so close to home, and he was so tired of the silence in Baker Street. Theatrics aside, this wasn't how normal people did things. Normal people were dinner and a movie, ad nauseam, so it wasn't as if he genuinely wanted to be like them, but he was acutely aware that there was no rule book of social cues for
The train pulled to a stop at the station, and John stood at the window, watching the people outside cheer for them. Sherlock stood and walked up behind him, looking over his shoulder at all the Capitol residents in their ridiculous outfits, getting so excited about meeting the people they were going to have killed. It was too morbid even for him.
He was numb and enraged and had never believed those two emotions could somehow exist at the same time, but they could. And exhaustion could exist with them. He wanted to scream or cry and at the same time, just wanted to curl up on the ground and never move again. No wonder Irene had turned to such a questionable lifestyle when she'd come back.
But the museums, they were always calm and quiet. John wasn't sure what exactly inspired silence in museums, but he was grateful. The only other places that were ever so serene were churches, and he had had some difficulties where God was concerned after returning from the war.
Shortly after returning from Karachi, John and I were on a new case involving a serial killer. I had had more difficulty than I had imagined trying to keep my sentiment in check. He would shoot me one of those warm and open smiles of his, and I had to force myself to only return it with my usual brand of appreciative arrogance. It was getting steadily harder.
He threw the sponge down on the floor and ran his hands over the entire statue like he was molding clay. The strange color continued to appear, darkening when he would cross over the same space more than once. He tried to place a name to the color he was seeing and when it finally came to him, he jerked his hands away as if he could be poisoned by further exposure.
John decided that in the wake of his late-night train ride collapse that he would keep to himself for a few days, try not to talk to anyone at all. Not Mary, not Sarah, not Mrs. Hudson, and certainly not Mycroft. Maybe a few days of peace and quiet, of tea and reading and solitude, would do him good. Or at least, it certainly couldn't make the situation worse.
He turned to see the man himself staring at him with a mischievous smirk on his face. Sherlock steeled himself, the time for recollection was over. He folded his hands behind his back. Moriarty stalked over to him and circled him like a shark.
John made his way over to Sherlock, who was standing over the body with a look of fearful curiosity. John watched with unease as Sherlock towered over the body, which still lay dormant and unmoving. It made very little sense, why had he not yet awoken?
Sherlock visibly crumpled at the words. All these months and he still could not even associate death with his brother. He would get over it in time, he told himself, and he would learn to make it hurt less with each passing day. Soon, his brother would live on in fond memories, but for now, all his memory brought was pain and sadness. He rose from the couch and began to walk in the direction of his room. Their room. Sherlock was not sure.
Sherlock pushed the yolk of the egg about with his fork. A few bites would suffice, and then he’d return to his room for the remainder of the day.
“I will not drag him down with me. If we are to be free, I must go this alone. Moriarty is my enemy and mine alone. If I do not return by tomorrow...tell John he is to seek passage out of Switzerland, and quite possibly Europe if he must. I will not see any harm come to him or you.”
She made her way to the entrance but Sherlock grabbed her arm before she could leave. Her brow rose at the contact.
“Holmes’ Manor. Please." Sherlock hopped in and immediately felt the movement of the cab, every step of the horses' hooves. He paid the coachman once they arrived and entered his home before the carriage left the front gate. He was immediately greeted by his maid, who gave him a warm smile. She took his jacket and his hat and was careful not to soak herself with his wet garments.
He was not ready to stare into those beautiful eyes. John had given him no warning when he lifted his face. He felt John’s lips on his own, and it was heavenly. He melted into the kiss that John graced him with and found that he had been craving it. John pulled away from Sherlock and pushed him onto the couch. Before he could voice his objections, John was already down to his waistcoat and on top of Sherlock. He peppered kisses all over Sherlock’s long, slender neck. Sherlock tried to push him away. This was wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong.
“Alright, I am aware that you are unable to speak my language, but you deserve a name, nonetheless.”
Sherlock rose from his seat and bent down in front of John. He rested a hesitant hand on John’s cheek and stroked it gently with his thumb. Once he saw John’s hand leave from under his chin, he leant forward and allowed John the choice of kissing him or not. He tried not to grin as he felt the coarse skin of John’s lips meet his own. Sherlock moved his hands up to cup John’s face and moaned once he felt John’s fingers run  over his sensitive scalp and clutch the silky locks. He pulled John’s body in so that the kiss might deepen; he’d always wanted more from John, wanted to have him wholly, and now he would give in to all of his carnal desires if John wished it. It was unholy to love someone as much as he loved John.
Sherlock nearly choked on his ham. He had almost forgotten about the bruising on his face, it did not hurt as much anymore but that did not mean that they were gone. How would he tell Mrs. Hudson about this?
Sherlock’s chest went a bit tight at the possibility. The answer was no. No, he wasn’t ready. And even so, because of his curiosity, he had asked. His shoulders went stiff at what was to come. Inevitably John would see Sherlock’s question as permission and if Sherlock denied him, he would be nothing but terrible for tempting.
“How very proud you make me to be your lover,” John whispered. When John’s hand lingered to Sherlock’s neck, those pale eyelids fluttered to reveal the blue eyes that made him shiver. John sucked in his breath at the sheer beauty that Sherlock possessed. How could anyone lay eyes on such a wonderful man and think to treat him with cruelty and malice? The thought was simply unfathomable.
“...Will he die, John?” Sebastian’s voice was soft and shaky, and it broke John’s heart into a million pieces. He was a grown man physically, but he betrayed that appearance by sounding like a frightened child. He only sighed and pulled the terrified man into an embrace. It probably did little to comfort him.
Not even the loudest crack of thunder could rouse him, the intensity of which could only mean it struck nearby.
He lied to Mycroft, it was not the last time he did it. He spoke to men and flirted with them but that was only the time he was struck by Mycroft for such a thing.
“I think that this enough for tonight, John, we have had a long day and you had remarked upon your fatigue earlier. Shall we retire?”
“Up. Up, love,” John broke their kiss to breath the words against his lips, rising to his feet although still bent forward so they were not separated. “Up. The bedroom.” He clutched a hand around Sherlock’s elbow, urging him to stand so they could move.
Sherlock sighed and said, “You are making me uneasy, John. I admit you have been less than quiet and it is very uncharacteristic.”
Sherlock clenched his fist and bit his lower lip. He had to attend to John, that was his first priority at the moment. He walked up the stairs to the door.
“I shall leave you to your thoughts, it is clear that you are in no mood to hold conversation with me.”
He looked over at the window, searching but not seeing.  With a gasp of breath he realized what needed to be done in order for his dream to become a reality. He had to go to a graveyard.
They were all the same. They did not understand him, for all they said to him when he was younger, they did not understand a single thing about him.
Sherlock spent the night at his writing table, scribbling away on the paper that he procured from Mrs. Hudson, who used it to write to her sister. An hour of drawing, writing, and sketching passed before he scowled at his work and swept it all to the floor. He yanked at his curls out of frustration. This had to be accomplished. It had to.
John folded his hands and sniffed, the first sound that either of them had made during the entirety of their trip. Sherlock’s eyes travelled to the rags that John’s shirt had become. Ripped in nearly every spot, white stained with red, and then there was the black of that thread that held his body together. Uneven stitching, heavy on the top and then light on the bottom. He had done his best, Mrs. Hudson had always done the sewing for the brothers because she didn’t think it proper for men of their standing to mend their own wardrobe. Pity too, who knew that he would later need that skill to accomplish what he had.
Sherlock did not respond. He heard the guests talking again, and he could not help but overhear their idle chatter. It seemed that Albert initiated conversation this time.
Sherlock chuckled before  yawning and sitting up. He looked more like a little boy rather than a grown man. The charms that this man possessed never ceased to amaze John. That ice blue gaze turned downwards to look upon the treats John  held.
He was right, Sherlock was loathe to admit it but sleep did sound rather an attractive proposition, and the thought of sleeping with John made the proposal even more enticing.  He felt John pull him up and guide him to the bed. This is what he must have done after their visit to Mycroft’s grave. He laid Sherlock down first and then joined him. Sherlock wanted John to stay with him like that forever but they were not in the flat. They risked an intruder entering the room to find them in such a suggestive state. John noticed the apprehensive look on Sherlock’s tear-ridden face. He smiled and said, “Have no fear, Sherlock. I will not fall asleep, I will migrate to the floor after you have drifted to slumber.”
Sebastian’s eyes opened once again only to take in the position, and then they were closed and remained that way. Sherlock was sure that John had successfully put Sebastian to sleep. No matter how recently the man had found life, his body was bound to be fatigued and exhausted now that his pulse was calm.
John rubbed his eyes and walked over to the table. Sherlock took his seat and motioned for John to do the same. John looked down at the plate in front of him. He picked it up and brought it to his nose, Sherlock placed a hand on his mouth to hide the chuckle from his companion.
Not even waiting to hear a response from John, Sherlock shot up and walked into the bathroom. He closed the door behind him and nearly sank to the ground. John was quite the romantic. He no doubt learned the skill from all the poetry that he read. Sherlock turned off the taps and began to remove his clothing. He lifted one leg up and tested the temperature of the water with a dip of his toe. Considering it warmed to his liking, Sherlock slid in with a sigh of relief. It was exactly what he needed to soothe his aching limbs. He ignored the bruises littered all over his body and closed his eyes, lying back.
She smiled to herself as well. “How’ve you been? No more shagging corpses? That John fellow left you yet?”
John let out a breath and removed his hands from Sherlock’s soapy curls, much to his dismay. He placed both hands on Sherlock’s arms and rubbed his thumbs against the soft, wet skin. Was this it? Was this all he needed to say in order to initiate it? Was he ready?
At such an quick pace, they were on the brink of coming within seconds but John did not slow. He kept pushing in deep until they were both flung over the edge, falling into the white hot pleasure of climax. Sherlock’s cum painted stripes on John’s stomach at the same time that ejaculate filled the already tight space of Sherlock’s arse around John.
His eyes prickled at the sound of John’s voice being so soothing, caring. It was like the night after he woke and John coaxed him into putting on the robe. He sniffed and wiped away the tears furiously, he would not disappoint Sherlock, and he would not worry John any more than he already was.
He had forgotten that John was even there. He meant to hide his suffering from him, but John had borne witness to it; Sherlock’s destructive behavior.
He rose abruptly and held his hat underneath his arm once more. He didn’t look at Thomas as he shuffled past him. His pace quickened even more as he passed the hateful group of three. He tried to ignore their laughs and cold stares. His yearning for Mycroft had been emphasized even more by their words - Mycroft would have never allowed such chatter to continue. He hailed over a coachman as a carriage came into view. The driver stopped and looked down at him.
part of it felt like another day at the proverbial office. The hellish part was their attempt at playing house, at having dinner and drinks as if they were a normal family, despite missing one of the key family members. Clara and John's mother got along quite well, all things concerned, for which he was grateful. But that did mean that typically the two of them were chatting together, leaving John to deal with the beast that was his father.
And how much attention had they paid Sherlock? He was insufferable, yes, but he could command a room by presence alone. Surely they hadn't blatantly ignored
“Mycroft's already had a cleaning service take care of upstairs,” she said as she sat the plates down on the table, taking her usual seat across from him. “He even replaced the carpets.”
John should have known Sherlock would never choose anything as simple or commonplace as jeans. By the time they left, he was wearing a dark purple dress shirt and blazer, and had insisted on including a “dressing gown” with the other purchases. John was too tired to fight him on that one. He had also let him keep his mostly inconspicuous overcoat.
“Don't take that tone with me,” his father said, sharper than his other words had been. Still thought John was sixteen. “Jesus Christ, John, I'm just chatting with you.”
John put his head back down. “I wish it was all a hallucination. One big bad dream. Or a real show, like a scripted one where the people don't actually die, their characters just don't come back.”
Mary had shown up more and more often lately, always all smiles and hardly ever sitting. The more John had thought about that troubling afternoon when she'd first canvassed the place made him see something sinister in every innocuous movement and act. There was evil in how she always stayed near the doorway of the kitchen and a horror in how she would tilt back and forth on her feet like a fidgety child.
When Mike's face appeared in the sky, John cringed. Sherlock saw it. John clenched his jaw so tightly it hurt. He could feel Sherlock's hand flat on his back, the closest he could manage to a soothing gesture for someone as restrained as him. But when John looked at him, Sherlock was staring at the ground, and for the first time in the arena, he looked truly sad. But was it for Mike's sake, or Molly's? Or was it for John's?
doomed. That's just it. They'll probably spend the rest of their lives together and retire to some little house outside of the city with a hoard of grandchildren coming to visit them.” He said all of this with just a hint of disdain.
He leaned his head down close to John's shoulder and whispered, "I'm sorry." And he thought of delaying explanations, but he had to add, "It was to protect you, while I took down Moriarty's network. I didn't want to leave. I never would have left if I didn't have to."
Sherlock shrugged and took John's drink right out of his hand and downed it. "I'm making an effort to be normal, as per your request."
to his place, like a photo negative of his own skill. Who had done it? Why had they done it? And did they even understand what power they had just acquired?
are you talking about?” But even as he asked it, he felt a sinking in the pit of his stomach, a warning alarm going off in his head.
Sherlock looked around at the other tributes and their teams as they prepared for the Parade. One pair caught his eye. The tributes from District 8, textiles. One was a large man with glasses, older than John it looked like, dressed in classic formal wear, an elegant blue brocade suit. The other tribute was a woman, and a small one at that. She had a scared look in her eyes like a little girl would. She was wearing a pink ball gown, one made of seemingly endless thin layers of shimmery sheer material. The end result made her look like a princess from a fairy tale. She had a lot of light brown hair that was left hanging straight down her back. Her stylists must have been working the sweet innocence look.
"None at all." John had never been more relieved in his life. He had been in pain all morning, aching from the cuts and burns, but in light of this, the rest of it didn't seem to matter.
and I can’t say that, never that, because then you’d be far more scared and you’d try to be kind and you wouldn’t know how to behave around me and …
“No, not a word, Sherlock, not a word, you have no right—no, fuck that. Not again. I’m sorry, I should let you explain, though I can’t imagine …” then, unaccountably, he chokes out something like a laugh, and the next words sound almost affectionate, although they can’t be because that makes no sense—“Personal boundaries, Sherlock. I guess we still have to clarify a bit, eh? I assume it was some experiment requiring my ignorance—“ voice breaking again he collapses against the wall, dropping his head into his hands.
My parents, you see, were decent and affectionate folk, but rather firmly attached to social approbation. As such, my education was as much concerned with ‘proper’ behavior as mental development. And having discovered how much more kindly the world treats the conformist, I learned my lessons and played my role. It was not so painful as one might imagine; but neither was it patriotism alone that drew me into the army.
Moments of genius aside, Stamford prizes those small vulnerabilities from the most subtly reserved man he has ever known as the ultimate testament to his disposition. But others, unaware that there is anything much to discover about the open-faced captain, are rather more impressed by the treatment Stamford receives from the resident consulting detective. Or rather, they are impressed by the treatment he does not receive. The detective can clear a lab in a matter of minutes—when he first began commandeering labs at Barts he would send anyone who hadn’t already sought to escape his crazed mutterings scurrying off with barbed deductions, and soon enough his mere presence would induce an abrupt and comprehensive leave-taking. At first Stamford left with the others, not wanting to disturb the man when he so clearly wished to be alone, but one particularly boring day his curiosity overcame his impulse to avoid making a scene. So when the detective burst in and the others gathered their things with undisguised exasperation, Stamford stayed put and waited for the verbal firestorm. It never came.
Later that day they went out on a case, and John acted as if everything was normal and Sherlock tried to do the same, (that was the day Sherlock said
"Got your message," John says as he strides through the door, and there is a question in his voice. No accusation for Sherlock's sudden desertion, no doubt; just "What do you need? I'm here" (
Anxiety—expected. Today he might die. But that is hardly unusual; just increased odds today. The emotion is pleasingly under control and easily placed in his filing cabinet. (
), John didn’t retreat into himself or shake his head; he stood straighter as if squaring for a challenge.
John stares, blinking rapidly. Then, all at once he throws back his head and laughs, deep and full throated—and this, this is Sherlock’s favorite, John’s rarest laugh, the one fueled not by adrenaline or even humor, but by pure unmitigated joy.
For his part, despite his previous discomfort over Stamford’s anecdote about Holmes’s corpse-beating, Watson is instantly charmed by Holmes—charmed, bemused, fascinated, and already (in my view anyhow) careening his way to being in love. Not only does he forget his reservations and instantly agree to move in with the man (Holmes having made up his own mind amidst his rambling about hemoglobin), he enters willingly into the conversational dance and within moments has already adopted this particular smile, a smile which ranges between smitten “you are incredible and fascinating” and indulgent “I love my silly husband whom I just met.” (For reference, see minute 7.11–7.35).
After the numbness, the shock, there is the burst of emotions: elation, confusion, fear, disbelief, joy that doesn’t feel like joy because it is impossible, and because John hadn’t meant for him to hear those words and if he discovers he was overheard he’ll be furious—Unless he meant to be heard? What if John knows he is under the bed, guessed what had happened and is mocking him? But no, John would never—then the sobbing begins, and Sherlock can’t hide anymore because John is crying and he doesn’t understand but one way or another it’s because of him; and even if being found eavesdropping under John’s bed is the last straw and John leaves for good this time—well, John deserves to know.
So, after his hidden and essential contributions to the epic which is finally receiving its seal, Stamford is finally sitting next to John and enjoying Lestrade's speech without needing to dread his own. Greg has done excellently, of course, electing laughs and sniffles from the audience, blushes and grateful smiles from the grooms. And now, just when his ramblings begin to push the boundaries of ‘too long,’ he is drawing to a close.
For Mike Stamford the professional consequence of this effect is mild difficulty maintaining order in the classroom, and the interpersonal consequence is that individuals regularly depart from his company feeling rather more free and relaxed than when they entered it. Most conclude that their mug of beer must have been particularly well-brewed, or that the chicken was unusually well-cooked. But the perceptive few recognize the real source of release, and as a consequence Stamford is rarely without a few friends whose warmth of attachment puzzles the imperceptive masses.
If you ask one of Mike Stamford’s acquaintances what they think of him, their first reaction will be poorly-veiled surprise that he had sufficiently lodged in your mind to prompt the question. Then they will hem and haw and stall for time—clearly this isn’t a topic to which they have devoted much thought—before declaring him to be a pleasant, steady, unobtrusive man; the sort who earned his credentials through plodding consistency unaided by outstanding qualities.
Moriarty is telling a story, has promised a tragedy, and he won’t conclude it inelegantly, not with a sniper in the dark. No, murder would mean investigation, discovery of innocence. His death needs to confirm his guilt: suicide, then, proof of his shame and despair. It’s poetic. Elegant. Moriarty destroys Sherlock's work—his heart; that’s what he must have meant by burning Sherlock’s heart—and Sherlock himself seals that destruction with his dying breath.
John is seething with fury. He's never especially liked Mycroft, but he had thought Mycroft was on his brother's side. He had never thought—never imagined . . . and then Mycroft had the audacity to bloody
Now John momentarily considers chasing after Sherlock, trying to follow him; but it’s no good. No one knows London better than Sherlock, and he is quite capable of losing John if he is determined. Perhaps it would be better to search his common haunts or—
And the funny thing about Lestrade is that, for all his buffoonery, in a very real way he represents the proper English gentleman. When Holmes isn’t busy destabilizing Lestrade’s self-image he is confident, assertive, and takes the lead. His manner (when he feels in control) is dignified and polite. He has the socially sanctioned “correct” opinions about gender and class and English superiority. And granted much of this is a facade which interferes with his accomplishing his job justly and well, but it has been sanctioned by the symbol of the police cap and the power of the Inspector. He has been chosen as the protector of a society whose cultural ideal he (superficially) embodies.
Quietly, Stamford sprayed a cloth with an alcohol solution, grabbed a bin, and made his way over to the mess. With slow and deliberate movements he collected the shards and soaked up the liquid. When he finished, he raised his eyes to find the detective staring at him. After a pause, Sherlock nodded once. Stamford returned the gesture and plodded back to his table.
Sherlock Holmes was alive, and John Watson was about to be wedded to Mary Morstan. Stamford received a wedding invitation with “John Hamish Watson” written alongside the name of that woman, and he threw it in the bin. He told himself he was overreacting, that John was an intelligent man who could determine his own means of happiness. Yet Stamford couldn’t stop remembering John’s false smiles and Mary’s perfect mask and Sherlock the morning after he came back to life.
He knows he is occasionally helpful with his questions or his skills as a doctor or his excellent aim; but surely there are hundreds of others who could fill that same role, and maybe they’d have a intelligent thing to say once in a bloody blue moon, to boot. And some part of him knows it is silly, that the worth of one’s work is not mediated upon whether anyone else could accomplish it. But Sherlock is irreplaceable, utterly unique, and if John not does not and could never have Sherlock’s love, their lips and their bodies pressed together and exchanging energy, he at least longs to be more to Sherlock than a replaceable accessory.
ask, because before I even met my companion I was determined that Stamford would be wrong about one thing: “Another strange thing about this Holmes,” he’d said, “… somehow one never thinks to question him.” Well, I decided right then, I will be the sort of man who questions him anyway, the sort of man who solves this enigma of an individual by sheer persistence, if nothing else.
” and “Mrs. Hudson” and “Lestrade,” and then a good three fourths of his mind was out of commission save for
Stamford is quite aware that this is how he is perceived, and in rare moments of self-pity he sighs over how dull it sounds. Not that he’s ever attempted to do anything about it; for in truth those acquaintances are largely correct, and although he’s had his daydreams Stamford never could muster the passion to attempt a transformation. In consequence, he stumbled early upon the typically hard-won conclusion that it is far better—not to mention far less effort—to recognize the advantages of one’s disposition than to lament its shortcomings.
But that's no good; he needs John distant, needs him to be the one to leave. It will be easier on John that way. Sherlock shouldn't have called him back in the first place really, but he had to figure out that key code and it was easier with John around and besides . . . well.
) and he is saying, “You’re wrong, you know. You do count. You’ve always counted and I've always trusted you.”
John spends the next twenty minutes asking questions, trying to stumble on the right prompt. But Sherlock responds without epiphanies, only insults. It isn’t altogether unusual, but these feel different. They’re calm, not spoken as if in the midst of frustration. And they’re more targeted—not the generalized “idiot” Sherlock usually opts for. Almost as if he isn’t simply blowing off steam this time. Almost as if he means it.
Sherlock flexes his hands, willing himself to speak, utterly baffled but determined to explain himself:
John keeps talking for perhaps another thirty seconds, something about “I care” and “they care” and “can’t leave,” and then he is charging out the door at full speed.
And then they were off, Sherlock using his deductions to impress rather than attack, and John stiffly on guard but intensely engaged; and Stamford was sufficiently caught up in it all to be quite intentional about selecting the
) then slips out, leaving the door cracked open for John. He freezes, suddenly unwilling to release his final moments of hope, then steps inside.
It’s a deuced bother when good memories get mixed up with ones you’d rather forget. I would be delighted to never again think about the time I took to believing in tangible ghosts, only Holmes
“Point is, every officer at the yard has wanted to smash these idiots’ faces together for ages.” Laughter ripples through the audience. “But for all our well-wishes, I don’t think we really understood. We knew they were addicted to one another, but we didn’t know they needed each other—not at first. And even when we knew that, we still doubted that they could survive each other,” more chuckles. “We were too dense—yes, Sherlock, that is the only time I’m conceding the point, don’t get used to it—to understand that an angry doctor and a mad detective could just, fit. And later, we thought it was too late. We didn’t understand that they’re the sort of men who will be loyal to and beyond death itself. In short, there were many who loved them, but I don’t think there was a man in the world who
If he’d tried to boast of his success he would probably have received dismissive laughs at worst and condescendingly indulgent smiles at best. After all, his listeners would remind him, everyone and their sister knew John Watson was head-over-heals in love with Sherlock Holmes the moment they read his first blog post, and it didn’t take long for anyone fortunate enough to see them together to conclude that the infatuation was mutual. But if Stamford had opened himself to such dismissal by pronouncing his success—he didn’t—he would have stuck to his tale. This is partly due to the salient fact that while it is one thing to perceive an electric attraction between companions, it is quite another to predict it between strangers. What would be harder to convey is how utterly different—how seemingly unfit for any manner of relationship—the two men had been mere hours before they met. Most people, seeing John as he was that day, would have sought to steer him in the precise opposite direction of the mercurial consulting detective.
And the fear and the smell overwhelmed him until his genius brain betrayed him, as in days past he had almost wished it would but
He had lain there for an hour, breathing noiselessly, matching his inhales and exhales to John’s, simply because he could. He lay waiting for John to fall asleep, anxiously wondering whether it would be safest to risk slipping out or whether he should spend the night and escape when John went to use the loo, almost wishing he could stay the night despite the discomfort, but at the same time thinking,
It is also just as well, because if he had been standing he’d have quickly found himself seated again when John bursts back through the doors approximately 39 seconds after he left. And this isn’t the obedient soldier John who entered twelve hours ago. This John is seething and not—in any sense of the word—compliant.
• Partial credit for everything I say goes to those who participated at any time in the Howard Holmes watchalongs—my thoughts on the series have become irrevocably mixed with theirs. I will of course try to give credit for any thoughts that aren’t mine, but I’m afraid it’s been a while and my memory isn’t fantastic. If you see me stealing someone else’s idea, do please let me know!
Sherlock has been watching John ever since he lay his head on his arms, hiding his face. He's hardly even been thinking, just watching. Memorizing. It’s not much of an angle, but he’ll take what he can get. Not that he allows himself to ask how on earth he can stare at an objectively uninteresting mess of sandy-blond hair and the uncomfortable curve of a spine for thirty minutes without an ounce of boredom.
I don’t have anything particular to add on this point aside from what I’ve already said, but here’s the link to chapter two of
This episode features Holmes at his best, but I was initially bothered by the fact that Watson spends the first half of the episode being rather stupider than normal. Now, characters needn’t be intelligent to be loved and lovable, and the fact that Holmes and Watson take their turns being played for fools is frankly one of the strengths of the series. But given the history of adaptations erasing Watson’s capabilities I get touchy when he is being underestimated, so when in the span of 10 minutes he has fallen for a transparent lie from Lestrade, mocked Holmes’s experiments, taken 24 seconds to process a perfectly straightforward sentence, and flat-out forgotten how bullets work, I start getting defensive.
I don’t have much to add to what I said in part 1. However, if there is a moment in which Holmes begins to fall in love, it is when Watson rescues them from the actual murderer. Obviously Holmes liked Watson enormously from the start, but when Holmes realizes he has led this poor innocent man into mortal danger, only to have said ‘poor innocent’ neutralize the threat with quick efficiency, he looks at the man like … well, like he's really rather smitten.
Returning to the episode: although the case in this episode bears no resemblance to A Study in Scarlet, it does closely replicate Holmes and Watson’s first meeting, moving from Watson’s reconnection with Stamford through to Watson’s list of Holmes’s fields of knowledge and ignorance. As for the dynamics of their meeting, if you have not seen the series I urge you to stop reading and watch minutes 3.33–7.44, because in my eyes their meeting is magic. Holmes is wrapped up in his discovery of a test for identifying hemoglobin and begins regaling Watson with his delight the moment he enters. His sporadic intermingling of greetings with rambling about his findings is hardly polite, yet it is impossibly endearing insofar as it springs from what appears to be an equally genuine delight in his discovery and the stranger in front of him. Besides, the initially scattered proceedings do add a level of weight to the moment when Holmes stills, stands very close, and gazes intently at Watson while explaining his deductions.
And there is Sherlock Holmes, looking bloodied and battered but standing without discernible effort. And John wants to scream and to strike him because
He had hoped they were done with this charade—ever since the drugs incident in Baskerville Sherlock had been so much better about not cutting John off in the middle of the work. Sure, he still gets distracted and forgets or just doesn't bother to communicate essential details; but he no longer involves John through deceit or (intentionally) abandons him for the climax. John had suspected—or at least, hoped—that this was Sherlock’s way of saying ‘sorry.’
“my dear fellow, I have sublime confidence in your ability to extricate us from any predicament in which my rashness may place us.”
I debated whether to include this section, because it is terribly self-indulgent. But heck, I’m writing this for my own enjoyment, and you can always skip the section if you’re uninterested, so I’m doing it.
Because Mrs. Hudson is dying and he just told Sherlock Holmes that he, John Hamish Watson, is in love with him.
Normally Stamford would have guiltily provided John with the space he so clearly wanted and so clearly didn’t need, but today he was struggling even for proper sympathy with his old friend’s condition. He was too busy with the anxious, hopeful assessment running underneath his attempts to steer the conversation towards flatshares.
Intrigued, Stamford made a habit of failing to vacate rooms commandeered by the detective, and continued to find himself summarily ignored. At first he supposed that the man must have mellowed, and he had simply been the first to test the waters. But soon enough Lina, a young colleague, decided to try her own luck. It did not hold. Having had her wealth-enabled career laid out before her, she hotly demanded to know why the detective insisted on hating all and sundry, upon which he coolly informed her that she mustn’t flatter herself; she wasn’t nearly interesting enough to be hated. It was merely that they were all idiots, and being surrounded by idiocy distracted him. Incredulous, Lina asked whether he believed “that man”—here she gestured towards Stamford—to be the undiscovered savant of St. Barts. The detective returned to his chemicals as he replied, “No, he’s an idiot too. But he knows he’s an idiot, and doesn’t bother himself or me by pretending to be otherwise.”
“Nope.” John draws out the ’n’ and pops the ‘p’ in the way he only does when he’s really angry. Sherlock loves when John does that. “I’ve seen you—”
) might have discovered his plan during the past 39 seconds, Sherlock flashes back to Baskerville and John pulling rank on a number of duly cowed officers.
At any rate, he needs to stamp out that ready willingness in John's voice and purposeful stride. For starters Sherlock just hides his gratitude, launches into a description of his puzzle: the key code he needs to find if he is to have any chance of staying. But he has to remain seated at first, concentrating all his energy on hiding his wonder at this man who is surpassing all the duties that even extremely close friendship would demand of him, every muscle straining with the announcement, 'yes, of course I'm here, I wouldn't consider anything else' and—
But that’s bullshit; he knows it is. He is not replaceable, because he is Sherlock’s friend. And Sherlock, whatever he might say in a fit of anxiety, cares about him. He is sure of it, certain of it—almost. Because underneath the self-doubt, there is a worse fear; a fear which has been constantly put to rest only to reawaken countless times since the first day he met Sherlock Holmes: the fear that the detective’s sociopathic self-diagnosis is essentially correct, and that Sherlock doesn’t care about John because he doesn’t care about anyone.
John laughed at that and looked at Sebastian, who visibly shrank in his seat at the mention of marriage. “No, nothing of the sort Mrs. Hudson. His name is Sebastian and he is very dear to us. Is that not right, Sebastian?”
The man looked over at John, as if he was looking for approval on his face. Sherlock tapped John on the back, signalling John to nod or in the very least give some reply.
“Calm yourself!” John shouted, running over to subdue the creation when his target seemed to be set upon Sherlock who would be powerless to stop the onslaught of such anger. John threw his arms around the naked man’s body, locking his hold by gripping his own wrists to keep the arms from lashing out and causing any more harm to the lab, and most importantly, to Sherlock.
Lestrade tipped his hat and turned to walk away only to stop again and say, “Mr. Holmes, if there is anything the matter there is no shame in asking for aid.”
It wasn’t much, but it was better than nothing. They nodded fervently and watched as Thomas exited the building.
Sebastian nodded, John knew now and he was forced to come clean. Perhaps this was not in violation of Sherlock’s command. John had come to the conclusion on his own, after all.
Sherlock clenched his fist and nodded. “I know Sebastian, I know. Now go, be off and go to John. If he asks for me...distract him, do not tell him where I went. That is all I ask.”
Sherlock nodded at the compliment. He went into the kitchen to bring the food out, returning shortly with the tray and setting it on the table. He was about to head back into the kitchen before he felt John’s gentle fingers wrap around his wrist.
“Inspector.” Was Sherlock’s parting word. He was led by John back to their flat. Sherlock frowned; John’s gift would have to wait, sadly.
“Mycroft was seven at the time, but lord, he had the mind of a grown man. In those rare moments that she allowed him to handle you, I’ve never seen him be so gentle. I daresay that, in his own way, he loved you more than your mother did.”
Sherlock pondered for a moment. He should file a complaint, report harassment from professor Moriarty, but then that would result in him having to provide the Yard with every sordid detail of his life, and something told him that the police would no doubt find him guilty rather than the professor. Sherlock shook his head. How would he get Lestrade to tell him without asking outright?
The body was of a white pallor, but John imagined the skin would have a natural peach tone if blood were to fill the still empty cavities within. He could recount the night when he was sent to the cemetery to do what Sherlock had all that time ago. Seeing as how Moriarty would not want a man of neither his nor Sherlock’s build, he laboured to find body parts that would impress the madman, but not overpower the two of them were he to become violent. Were he alive, he would be the picture of health and considerably handsome. His features were rough, but complementary; John could picture those thin lips pulling up into a smile and found the image quite dashing. A likely ancestry would be German, or possibly even Roman going by the strong bridge of his nose.
With one last look of John’s tattered clothing, he turned to look out the window. He could have sworn that he saw John’s gaze linger on him in the reflection. Sherlock made the quick decision to not speak a word until after they’d reached Baker Street. Everything would be left just as it was before the attack, Sherlock would have to replace the china and the chair that sported the broken leg. He would also have to reveal that he had read John’s journal. Sherlock would tell him that it must’ve dropped when he was taken and that he hadn’t a clue before he read it that it belonged to him. It was very likely that John would become upset at hearing this, but he would rather John know than pretend that he did not invade his privacy. A habit that he tended to do often. And either way, John Watson was going to leave him, what did it matter to add fuel to the fire that would incinerate Sherlock’s heart?
There were a few moments of silence that passed between them before Sherlock decided to tell John the schedule for the remainder of the day.
He would want him to eat something, a full meal. Sherlock was going to wither away if he continued to lay in bed and watch the rain fall. One drop...two...three....
“Why keep such a thing secret, Sherlock?” His voice lowered, “I love you a great deal, I will do anything to keep you safe, you know this. Why, love, would you think to keep me in the dark?”
Mrs. Hudson’s eyes appeared glassy and the last thing Sherlock wanted was to make her cry. It was not her fault and he was sure that if she learned the real truth as to why he was in the cemetery that night, she would want to strike him too.
His face did not change, Sherlock ran his hands through his curls. He could stand to bathe as well. Sherlock yawned, but continued the name search. He felt as if he was talking to a wall instead of a person.
“I find them interesting, and part of me thinks that, for events such as this, I will be able to help you. You will not need to send for any doctor as long as I am here, Sherlock.”
“It was not until his death that I realized my hate for him was because of his very act of dying. It was then that I realized that I was alone, and there is nothing more terrifying than being lonely.”
Maybe if he walked enough he would end up in the grass and find flowers to pick for Sherlock. For now, he would settle with finding the nearest market and buying Sherlock some sweets. He was satisfied when he found a tiny bakery and walked in. He bought two slices of Swiss Torta that were carefully boxed for the journey back to the inn. John had started on that very journey when something caught his eye. He stopped dead in his tracks and could not remove his eyes from the man that was standing before him. He had alarming blue eyes and chestnut colored hair - John nearly dropped his treats - he could recognize those features anywhere.
Sherlock paused. That came out much harsher than he intended it to be. John did not take offense to Sherlock’s terse response but did squeeze his hand.
Sherlock raised his eyebrow waiting to hear what John wanted for breakfast, but he noticed the lecherous look that John gave him, which prompted another eye roll. He moved to walk out of the room before John shot up and wrapped his arms around his waist.
“However, I am worried for the younger Holmes. I have had the fortune of running into the man after the incident. With him was a man, Mr. Watson if I remember correctly.”
Sherlock humphed, followed by soft snoring. John smiled and began stroking the curls as he continued, “Would this suit you?”
He made his way to the living area, the seats were empty and the grooves on the chairs were nearly nonexistent. He pulled his coat off the rack and placed his cap on his head. The door seemed in that moment so close yet so far. He was only mere inches away, but his legs felt locked in place. He exhaled, and he began his walk to the exit. As soon as his hand was hovering above the doorknob, the sound of a door opened and then closed.
“Hear my words, Jeanette, tell Mrs. Hudson that I am not be disturbed during my time at Baker Street unless there is a dire need. Do you understand?”
John’s attention turned from Sherlock’s soft face, and to the raging flames that Sherlock warned him against moments ago. He did not see how Sherlock’s face fell at his rejection, or the way Sherlock skulked off into his room, leaving John alone in the living area. Sherlock left the door open a sliver and sank to his bed. Why did John not follow him to the room? Did he not feel safe around him? Had Sherlock been too overbearing? Sherlock shook his head. John was not yet used to the flat, to the fire, to the elements, to Sherlock. He was attacked in this very room, Sherlock imagined that it would be hard to not see the blood that was drawn from his wound. Sherlock did not mean to, he only tried to defend himself against an invader. Was he scared of Sherlock now? Is that why John didn’t want to sleep with him?
Sherlock could not help but blush at the situation he was thrust into. He was sure that he smelled quite rank, due to his sweat-soaked clothes, but John was being polite about it. He wanted to tell John that it was alright, that he did not have to undress him as if he were an invalid, or a child incapable of undressing himself. He was ill, but he was not incapable.
“What of him? He was an incompetent fool, my mother as well. I was glad to hear of their deaths from the cholera epidemic.”
Thomas sat back in the chair and smiled. He was satisfied with the answer, believing Gregory when he said that he would try his best. There were few policemen that would help him, the reason being that the English were not quite fond of the Irish. He was sure that his social status and wealth helped, so when people talked to him, they did not hear the accent, but saw how powerful he was. The only Englishman he met whom he set aside his hate for was Mycroft Holmes, someone he respected immensely.
Sherlock stiffened. It rained that night, and all be could think of was Mycroft’s coffin, and how no one cared that he was alone in the world. It was bad on some nights, Sherlock tried to block it out, the flashes of his wake, the people who sat huddled together on the other side and whispered amongst each other while Sherlock held back tears. On these nights Sherlock would cry until he fell asleep or until when he had simply dehydrated himself to the point where the tears stopped flowing.
“Do not take their words to heart, my boy, they are only heartless nobles, spawned from England’s upper class.”
John hummed and watched Sherlock exit their flat. Immediately, John jumped up and watched out of the window. Sherlock had just climbed into a hansom cab. He sighed and returned to his spot on the floor.
He felt the familiar grasp on his wrist. How could he imagine such a realistic hallucination? The skin as smooth as his own, almost unnaturally so. His hand, warm to the touch. The stitching on his wrist in the same fashion as his own sutures. Was Sebastian truly here? Was this not a cruel trick?
He walked towards the back, to his room, so that he could be left alone and safe, but he heard Moriarty’s voice beckoning him to sit with them. There was an armchair for each of them, he pushed his as far away as he could without much notice. He did not like Moriarty. The man  was wicked, he was evil, he was everything John and Sherlock were not. He did not like Thomas for staying quiet, even when Sebastian knew he disagreed, for being a coward, for watching as Moriarty destroyed the world around him.
“No, the man does enjoy his sleep, however. Today may be a day where I find a way to while away the time.”
John did not respond, he only glared at the man as they walked away, his hand resting on the small of Sherlock’s back.
Sherlock could have sworn he heard something resembling a gunshot shortly after that statement. If only he could will himself to open his eyes. Whatever Moriarty’s henchman attacked him with served its purpose. He was tied up, going by the way his wrists burned from the coarse ropes. John. Where was he? They did not harm him, did they? This Moriarty, whoever he was, had better not have laid a finger on his John. That gunshot he heard- No. No, that bullet had killed one of the henchman. Not John. John was alright, they spared him, no harm had come to him…
They shared the same bed, as had become normal, letting each other’s presence heal and give a sense of safety and comfort. The fight against the threat to their love, their relationship, was now over - washed away with Moriarty in his grave at the base of the Riechenbach falls. They were free of his looming presence and that freedom was almost difficult to become accustomed to, in a way. John knew that Sherlock looked at him often, but now there was something loving in the man’s eyes that John was not used to receiving so openly. In reciprocation, he also allowed his affections to shine through unadulterated.
“What am I, Sherlock?” John’s tone became harder at Sherlock’s reluctance to answer his inquiries. The truth might not have been uncovered but John knew now that something was very wrong. Sherlock was keeping something from him.
Sherlock held the box to his chest tightly the entire ride back to the flat. He could barely contain himself, he wanted to see John’s face when he opened the box. He would be ecstatic, Sherlock knew already. The suit was pricy, but such was the way of high fashion. John would be quite the dapper man. He had to be informed by the driver that they arrived at his destination.
Sherlock jerked his hand away and shot up from the couch as if he had seen the face of the Devil himself. He startled John with his sudden movement, the man staring up at him wide-eyed.
“I wondered how I would alleviate myself of the pain, John, how I would be able to have my brother back or at least someone to care for and to care about me. These thoughts plagued my mind and it was to expel them from my head that I began to study death and rebirth. I thought it was evil that, of all the stories I have read as a child - Snow White, Sleeping Beauty - they were all sent to their eternal rest but at the very end were revived and given the chance to start anew. It angered me to think of the unfairness of it all. How was it that they were able to come back while my brother rotted beneath the earth? It pained me that I would never see him again and so I devised a plan to create life from death.”
Since there were no clothes for his creation, Sherlock gave him his silk red dressing gown. His hair was wet, but Sherlock could not get over how relieved he was to be able to touch him, to feel the dripping locks. To have him wholly.
Thank you guys for being so patient, as we are both very busy and do try our hardest to get the chapters out.
Sherlock had just finished his sentence when he heard Mrs. Hudson knocking at the door. She had come to appeal to his appetite once more. He hid his papers inside of his desk drawer and went to open the door. There she stood with a covered tray resting on her hands and a warm smile adorned her face.
Sebastian’s face looked hopeful. “It is not too much to ask if I may accompany you back to your inn? I have sorely missed the sight of your faces.”
There it was. How grateful Sherlock was that his back was turned to John. How shameful it was for Sherlock to blush at nearly every word John said. He only said two words - barely a sentence! He felt John’s hand on his own, how soft when they should be cold; hands that belonged to a dead man.
He was completely mesmerized by how Sherlock squirmed and bucked at the movements of his fingers, that expression going slack to show nothing but pleasure.
“Rubbish! You’ve not eaten in nearly a day, I shall not have the last brother dead as well, not if it can be helped!”
John’s face perked up at the invitation. He immediately walked back over to the vacant side of the bed and settled himself in. He sighed as the blanket wrapped around his body, unused to the warmth because he usually slept much after Sherlock, leaving him without the knowledge of spare blankets.
Part of Sherlock could not help but feel guilty over the fact that John was now forced to work in the very lab in which he was created. The news was still relatively new to him and he knew that, although John forgave him, this information festered within him like a fresh wound. Sherlock had not meant to upset him, but he also had no intention of telling him that he was not human, that he was not created and born as Sherlock was. It was good to know that John did still love him, as he was given no indication otherwise, and there was nothing he needed more than to have John’s love.
“Your attention seems to be solely on the roast, you’ve completely ignored the mash and the peas and carrots as well.”
Mrs. Hudson only smiled, but there was something almost sad behind it. She patted his hand and said, “My dear boy…”
“Who is there?” He asked before he swung open the door and found a man staring back at him with two younger men standing on both sides.
“Perhaps you were able to wake due to your shock being directly from the storm with no means of conduction. Our friend here does not have the privilege to follow in your footsteps. We must perform compressions of the heart upon him, John!”
Sherlock sighed and moved to sit up in the bed. He turned to look at John and pushed his leg. John smirked but did not budge, and Sherlock rolled his eyes as he slid out of the bed for the second time that day.
They thought he enjoyed the sight of dead bodies. One part of Sherlock was relieved that was all they gathered from his appearance in the graveyard that night, the other was revolted that he would be aroused from such a horrid sight. He was shoved again before a fist met his cheek. He could try to fight them off but there were too many. He curled himself into a ball as protection from their kicks and blows reminded of his time as a child when this was a regular occurrence.
The woman referred to as Lady Martin took off her veil. Sherlock caught a brief look at her face. She had applied an excessive amount of white paint to her features and garish rouge to her cheeks to hide the fact that she was aging, and rather poorly at that.
“I do not, John, I am only experimenting with my knowledge of medicine and anatomy. Hopefully, we shall be able to start his heart.”
“Earlier this week, I was subject to a rather hostile group of miscreants, Mrs. Hudson. They claimed to have seen me visiting Mycroft’s grave on the night of my departure from the manor. They assumed that my presence in the cemetery was due to a...perverse infatuation with corpses. They then proceeded to...attack me...just outside my flat.”
A true smile spread across Sherlock’s lips, eyes shutting for just a moment at the rush of emotion. Yes, he had imagined doing this for years now with different men and had felt so wrong about it. He had felt isolated and like the freak everyone said he was for his inclinations. Sherlock had never thought he would be able to have this and now, to have it with a man like John who cherished him and cared for him without ulterior motive? Well, he could only see the wait as worth it - all that pain, all that doubt and fear, was worth it.
Both men pressed closer to one another. Sherlock leaned forward, bringing his arms up around John’s neck while the other man’s looped around his middle.
Before Sherlock could reply, one of Moriarty’s henchmen struck him from behind, leaving him dazed and confused on the slippery floor of the room. He was going to lose consciousness soon, could barely keep his eyes open. All he saw before everything darkened was John being dragged back to the chair and Moriarty’s polished black shoes directly in front of his face.
“Oh, yes. Please, please, John. Right there. I need you.” Sherlock reached up, gripping at John’s shoulders while the man smeared the Vaseline across his entrance.
She offered Sherlock a cup; he declined. She tucked her chin and took a slow, careful sip of the hot liquid. John had already helped himself to a sandwich. Sherlock could not blame him, the man must have been ravenous.
John frowned and rested a hand on Sebastian’s shoulder. “You must be dreadfully lonely.” Sebastian swallowed and shook his head. “Your face is a much welcome sight. I have missed you terribly.”
Sherlock rose and moved to his wardrobe to retrieve an old robe he had no use for. Then held his hand out for John. John smiled at him and graciously accepted his invitation and they both headed downstairs. They found their creation staring at them with fascination and fear. Sherlock walked over to him with the robe in hand, but of course, the man did not even make to reach out. After several attempts at trying to wrap him in some sort of clothing, Sherlock realized that there was no way for him to overcome the barrier. He turned to look at John and said, “Do you mind?”
Thank you all for your patience! We are trying as hard as we can to update the chapters within a reasonable time.
She smirked and shook her head. She waited for Sherlock to take his first bite of the ham before she struck up another conversation.
“On some nights, I hear sounds come from your room at ungodly hours of the night. It is not the same noise as when you talk, mind you, but it sounds...oh, I cannot place it. It saddens me whenever I hear it.”
“Hush, I’m going to remove your clothes, and you are going to have your bath and love every moment of it.”
Sherlock could not help but chuckle. What was it about the night that made everyone so sentimental? The both of them especially. He kissed John again and replied, “That would be oxygen.”
“John, tell me you forgive me. All I wish for you to say is that I’ve been pardoned for my wrongdoings towards you. I only wished for companionship, someone that would care for me as much as my brother had. I’ve spent so long alone, and to have you now, for you to hold such hatred, such anger towards me for withholding your creation from you. Words cannot express how badly it aches. I…If you must go, if you absolutely cannot bear my presence, I understand, but please, forgive me.”
Sherlock walked down the street. He scowled at the cold weather and pulled his coat tighter around his neck. He had hurt John. To him, this was even worse than causing John physical harm. He had broken his heart. How could he be so stupid? How could John not feel hurt from the way he recoiled from his touch? Did John not know? The only reason why Sherlock leapt from his seat in that manner was because he liked the way John’s hand slowly approached his groin and it terrified him to the point where he had to flee. Why did he torment John so? Why did he have to be so...why did he have to be the person he was?
“Perhaps I shall. How elegant you look reclined in your seat, long legs stretched out. How beautiful your throat looked bared as you tipped your head back. How the light now dances in your eyes. Those are only a few of the observations I have made. You are a smart man, do you not see how they overwhelm me? Why I cannot do anything but continue to look at you, entranced?”
Sherlock closed his eyes and exhaled. The air was cold and harsh, but he would not move, he would freeze to death if need be. He knew that John had questions, any person in his position would. Sherlock’s eyes opened and he began to tell John just how his brother had come to rest six feet below their very feet.
“Kidneys, beans on toast, sausage, and egg.” He raised a brow at the full meal, toast and tea a pale comparison to it.
“It is not a matter of obligation, Sherlock. I enjoy helping you, even more so since you have not had a good time of it.”
John shushed him and pulled him close into a hug, “Neither do I, but we will deal with him in time, as soon as Sherlock returns from his walk, we shall all handle this.”
His mind raced as he ran up and down the flat, tirelessly searching for a way to locate John, he even called for his dearest companion in the hopes that maybe he was able to defend himself from his attacker and was now recovering somewhere in the flat. Of course that was not the case. It wasn’t until Sherlock made his way to the fireplace that he found a card on the mantelpiece.
Sherlock was en route to the nearest clothing store. He did not want John to look like a street urchin, he was with Sherlock, and Sherlock Holmes does not tolerate unfashionable clothes. Sherlock smiled, Mycroft would be proud. It took the driver nearly ten minutes to reach their destination. Sherlock paid a generous amount, and walked into the shop to find a suitable outfit for John, as well as a few shirts, trousers, socks, pants, and shoes. The clerk walked over to Sherlock with a smug smile spread across his face.
They had done their fair share of blushing for the day. John was only recovering from his most recent one, and Sherlock had not recovered from his own yet. He was not over the warm presence of John, he was not getting used to waking up and finding John sitting at the table or on the couch. He could not force his brain to understand that he was no longer alone, that he had John now. His hand snaked his way over to John’s own. A finger rested on the top of the tan hand, followed by another, until he was resting his hand on top of John’s. At first he smiled, feeling the smooth skin beneath his own, elated to be able to touch John in such a way that gladdened his heart. Until he saw the smiling face of the waiter flash in his mind.
That night he did not take supper, his minimal appetite reduced to nothing by sorrow. Instead, he retired to bed after his bath though he knew slumber would not grace him. Mycroft would have given two knocks at the door as a sign that he was going to bed as well, but there was no noise in the manor that night, none besides the muffled sounds of Sherlock's sobs.
That night, he was racing around the room, packing his clothes and everything else that he would need. He was already dressed in a simple white shirt and black trousers with shoes to match. The outfit itself was not one of his best however it was one he would not miss should it be ruined by mud, rain, or even tears. He emerged from his room and shut the door quietly. Mrs. Hudson was in her quarters, preparing herself for sleep no doubt. There was only one other maid that was up at the hour. Jeanette, he thinks her name was. He would have to give her the order to fetch a coachman so that when he returned he would be able to leave for Baker Street. He found her rearranging a vase of flowers. Why she never retired with the others was beyond him.
“You look so beautiful right now,” John whispered, leaning down to kiss the corner of Sherlock’s mouth and along his jaw while he kept working his lover open.
It took a while, but John’s eyes finally landed on Sherlock’s book, and without even looking up at the man, Sherlock could tell that he was interested.
Sebastian looked up at Mrs. Hudson wide-eyed and then shifted his focus over to Sherlock and John. Sherlock shook his head. “Do not worry, we will provide for him, at least, until you deem it necessary for him to be paid.”
John went over to Sherlock and helped him up. Sherlock scooped the box up from the ground as he stood. The officer looked back at them.
“Sherlock, I understand you’ve a need to conduct your experimentations. Do be mindful of the cold and bring your coat this time. You know how easy it is to fall ill.”
“I did not say that I find joy in my work. In order to protect ourselves, we must do this, please heed my words when I tell you that there is nothing worse than to be jailed for being in love.”
If Sherlock were to be granted one wish, he would wish that they could remain that way for forever and a day.
“What you have had the fortune of missing was my descent into complete and utter despair. I’d gone days without eating, drinking sleeping. It was at Mrs. Hudson’s insistence that I would consume anything more than a slice of toast and a cup of tea. I have never felt more alone than after his passing John, you must understand. There were even nights were I contemplated the thought of death and how I would be able to take my own life.” Sherlock took a shaking breath in, thankful there were no tears.
“I am John,” He put a hand to his own chest and repeated, “John.” Then he extended his hand behind him to gesture at Sherlock, “He is Sherlock. Sherlock.” Though introductions had already been made, he thought it best to repeat them once again now that the creature was in a much more relaxed state. “Sherlock means you no harm,” John added, trying to add appropriate gestures but not getting them quite right.
There was a knock at the door and John smiled, as he approached it. He swung it open, half expecting Sherlock to be there, but it was Sebastian.
Sherlock rose a brow, amused, “Now who was it that once told me that sarcasm is the lowest form of wit? Was it you or another dashing man?”
“A palm is four fingers, a foot is four palms....” He muttered to himself. It was nearly eight o’clock and Sherlock was hunched over his desk, hair wild from unkemptness, eyes wide from manic determination. Just another addition to the second-to-last note, one more look at the encyclopedia, a break to wipe the fatigue from his eyes. He could not be burdened with the needs of his body.Hunger, his bladder, and weariness all could not prevail upon him to satisfy them.. He set the pen down and read the newest sheet of notes. They would do. If he edited them any further he would surely go mad.
“No, do not leave! It is me John, I am here before you as real as you could make me. Come, place your hand upon my breast and feel the heart that beats.” Sebastian slowly moved John’s hand to his chest and true to his word there were the beats of a heart underneath his palm. He was real! By God, Sebastian was real!
Sherlock and John turned to find Mrs. Hudson standing behind them with the tray of tea and sandwiches in her hands. She walked over to the desk and set the tray down gently. John moved closer to Sherlock who looked seconds away from breaking down into tears. She wiped her hands on her apron and formed a smile that held more sadness than happiness. Her eyes gaze seemed worn and beaten down from years of hard work, as well as loss.
Thomas frowned. He made acquaintances with Sally and Anderson five years ago because his friend told him that they were useful for gathering information, even if they were a bit sloppy in manners. He sighed and pinched the bridge of his nose.
“That was my caretaker, Mrs. Hudson. She has written to me. My brother’s belongings have been retrieved from one of his many offices.”
With that, she exited the room. Sherlock stretched his aching limbs and then rose from the bed, careful not to disturb John. He was glad that he had not brought his whole wardrobe to Baker Street, while he was sure Mrs. Hudson would not mind him wearing the same outfit from yesterday, he found it scandalous thanks to years of Mycroft’s complaints. He stared at the coat draped over the chair, brilliant, it had little spots of dirt from his visit. He had a mind to leave it to Mrs. Hudson’s care, but once he left this manor he knew that it would be a long while before he would ever return.
Sherlock’s eyes widened at the revelation Moriarty threw at him. Mycroft had stopped him? Of course Mycroft would never tell Sherlock what might upset him. He used his pull with the British government to do it, of that Sherlock had no doubt.
Sherlock shut his eyes so that he might shut those thoughts out. John had every reason to hate him, he had every right to desire to leave the flat. What a hypocrite Sherlock was. Had he been in John’s place, to be confined to one area for an extended period of time, he would have thought the setting akin to a prison and done everything in his power to escape. Of course John loved him so dearly that he did not have the chance to fully experience the world, save for the trip to the manor and the attack in front of their flat. John was perfect in every aspect. He would be loved by all, desired by every noble woman, married or not.
“I expect the plate to be spotless, Sherlock. The others have told me that you’ve not eaten since your brother’s funeral.”
He had no right to fall so deeply in love with John. He knew that nothing good would come of it, yet he pursued the relationship anyway. And now look, he was almost certain that things would never be the same between them again - it would become too awkward, to tense. They would merely sit together for meals and perhaps, occasionally, they would mutter the polite “good morning” and “goodnight”. Why did he leave? He wanted nothing more for John to touch him the way he had and to be kissed the way John kissed him. He wanted to be loved the way John loved him.
Sherlock’s breath hitched as he felt John’s tongue lave his nipple, tug at it with his teeth. He was losing control of his body, becoming pliant under John’s ministrations so that all he knew was the need to chase the sensations John was bestowing upon him. His back arched under John’s tongue, testicles still finding friction against John’s thigh.
They were cruel to him. They taunted, jeered, attacked him when they saw fit. Mycroft warned him but Sherlock never listened until the moment after the other children left him with bruises, a split lip, as well as a broken heart. Mycroft comforted him that night, something that Mycroft rarely did.
“I’ve been meaning to ask you this, there wasn’t much chance for talk yesterday. What happened to your face?”
Sherlock was wasting his breath, to give such a formal apology to a man who could barely clean himself. Nevertheless, Sherlock was taught that he was to apologize if he was at fault, and quite frankly, he was at fault. John remained in his place next to the fireplace, the silence was filled with the cracks of the firewood. Sherlock cocked his head. John still did not trust him. He couldn’t be blamed.
Sherlock groaned. He truly was the epitome of the wretched patient. John felt badly for Sherlock - How could he not? - but then he had warned Sherlock repeatedly of the consequences that would befall him if he did not manage his body better. If Sherlock did not get well before the end of the week, then he would send for a doctor even if Sherlock wished against it. The man was working himself to the very extremes of fatigue, dehydration, and malnutrition so this was a price he would have to pay. John found supplies to clean the mess on the floor, thankful that Sherlock hadn’t eaten anything or else it would be much harder to remove. At this point, Sherlock had fallen asleep again. John wondered if he should join Sherlock in his nap, or leave him by himself while he tended to the dormant body upstairs. He shook his head. He was no better than Sherlock, he could not keep his mind off of the creation. The body was complete, John saw to the retrieval of the limbs due to Sherlock’s poor health and refusal to step anywhere near a cemetery. Sherlock himself mustered the courage to piece the limbs together while John watched slightly horrified and slightly intrigued.
