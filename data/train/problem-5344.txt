Toni may not like working with her father or even talking to Phillips right now, but she was willing to do both if it meant going home. "I would suppose you and Stark would be there to make sure nothing explodes."
Bucky? She thought to herself. What was a Bucky? Or was it a who? She would assume it was a person as she doubted Rogers was a type of person who would name an inanimate object. "Bucky?" she asked. "That isn't a weapon you kill helpless, not that I am helpless, women with?" she joked again. Though I'm helpless at the moment. She didn't like that thought at all.
But then Tony let out a long, shaky exhalation. "Just me, huh?" he said. "I think I can live with that."
Steve could say he wasn't angry all he wanted to; he really needed to send his body language that memo if he wanted to be believable.
“Oh,” Tony mumbled. “Steve.” He said something else, but Steve couldn’t make the words out, and if Tony was asleep, they probably wouldn’t make much sense anyway.
"I never argue when you tell me to do something I wanted to do anyway." Steve must have looked skeptical, because he added, "Well, almost never."
Steve pulls free of Tony’s grip so that he can back Tony against the wall. The doorman isn’t looking, and Steve’s not completely sure he’d care. “Not at all,” he insists, and then kisses Tony, hard and hungrily, the way he’s wanted to all evening.
Steve got that, too. "The latter," he said. "For me, anyway. At least going into the ice was just bad for me." For Peggy, too, and the remaining Commandos, and maybe Howard. But they'd have mourned him no matter how they'd lost him. It was sad, but not a horror the way it was for him. "If Hydra had succeeded, millions of people would have died, and life would have become a nightmare for the rest."
"I wasn't sure," Steve said. "You were complaining, like you didn't know exactly how to get me to do whatever you want."
The drawings he'd done of Tony weren't graphic. They weren't even nudes. Steve didn't want to draw Tony without seeing the real thing. Not quick glimpses as they hit the showers after training, but a chance to really take in all the details.
Steve changed quickly; he’d slept in his uniform before, but he wasn’t going to do that here, in his own bed.
He'd only had a short look at the dimension Tony was in now, and Dr. Strange had implied that it would be possible for Tony to make it more comfortable for himself than the bare space that they'd seen. But Steve didn't know what it looked like now, or what Tony was doing, so he sketched it the way he'd seen it, all planes and angles.
It had only been a little over a year. Steve had been out of the ice for longer than that, and he still wasn't over it.
"Oh, no," Tony said. "I told you I'd show up to support you at events, at least until we call this whole thing off. I'll be there."
For a second, Tony felt sick, because Steve was terrified of him? What kind of a monster did Steve think he was?
Tony shrugged. "I never take anything back. Besides, you should see the stuff that was on the gossip pages about me, especially back before Iron Man. This isn't even negative, even if some people think so."
"It's not an emergency," Tony said, and then stuck his foot in the doorway so that Steve couldn't close it on him. "But if I put this off, it's going to make it a lot easier for you to avoid me, because you know I'm looking for you. So let's not do that."
"Pretty well," Tony said. "It was mostly about the company--about how Stark Industries has reinvented itself, five years after we got out of the weapons business. But there were a few questions about me." He hesitated. "Or us, anyway."
New York was experiencing record high temperatures. It was hot and muggy and Steve's shirt was clinging damply to him before they even made it to Central Park.
Steve changed position, moving so that he could feed Tony his cock. Tony let himself be sloppy, doing the best he could to get Steve's cock wet enough to fuck him.
“I think I figured that out on my own,” he said, though it was still good to hear it from Tony. “And it’s after ten. I’m usually in bed by now.”
By the time he'd managed to get his eyes open, he'd remembered why he felt like that. He'd gotten incredibly drunk at that charity gala. If Steve hadn't been sitting with him the whole evening, he'd probably have embarrassed himself enough that he'd be on every gossip site on the internet.
The genius freezes when he steps into the common room, and the Brooklyn Boys aren't even there yet. He hates to see how he'll react once the two Super Soldiers are. Is he going to fall apart completely? Is he going to fall down at their feet like a dog? Is he going to beg, telling them that he made a mistake? Is he going to cry?...Oh, god, he might, and he hates himself. He hates how emotional he's being, and he wants to punch his own self in the face. He's so fucken annoyed at his behavior. He isn't a teenager girl, and he needs to stop acting like one.
"What happened?" Rogers asked, shock presented on his face. He took a few steps toward her, but stopped when he noticed the pain look on her face.
He turned to her. "First, I don't believe anything that you are saying, and two, why would I kill the project? I fully support this program and as you say, it will produce."
I think the issue here is that I wanted out of Iron Man 3- I didn't want to do Iron Man 3 (This movie annoyed me and it wasn't due to villain but rather Pepper. Can't stand that character or rather what they did with her) but i didn't think that I could skip it and to go Winter Soldier (which PS is my favorite Marvel Movie). And then I ran into the problem that I didn't know how to get out of Iron Man 3. It was like I ran into a brick wall as nothing was coming to me, which just pinned me in this chapter for weeks- months. I was at an still stand. I didn't want to change much as I didn't want to spend chapters in a movie that I did not want to do (which I did anyways.) However, I struggled following the movies. Then I was forcing myself at points which made my work suffer.
She wondered. She knew Rogers, Mr. Nice Guy, would never expect anything from a lady, but that could not be said about Barnes, who seemed to be already expecting something.
However, there was one thing that she knew. Even after losing feeling of her being, she knew she was screaming. She couldn't hear her scream, hear anything anymore really, but she was screaming. It was too much and she wished that the darkness would take her away. She wished this darkness would just end her as she couldn't take it anymore. It was too much. Just too much. It was-
After the first few blocks, Toni had lost track of how long she had been running for or how far she had gone, but if she had to judge by the number of people who flirted with her, she could guess that a few hours have past, that she had ran a few miles. She could feel her body protest as she pushed her body passed her limits. She was never the runner, never wanted to be, so this was a challenge. She could feel her legs tingle and her muscles contract. She had the urge to sit down and rest, but she refused to listen, refused to stop.
"I cannot say for certain. She did take precautions, which could have protected it from being permanently damaged."
"Killing…me," Toni said softly and slowly. It was difficult to make out what she said, as she was fighting to stay awake.
It was getting dark but Toni didn't care because for the last hour, she had been following her stalker and getting close. Though she wasn't sure, she didn't think he had spotted her, and this was a good opportunity to see what this guy was up to. She would find out if he had been ordered to follow her by the Colonel. She knew the chance of that was low as no military tail should be this sucky. If he was, she would have to give Colonel Salty a firm talking to.
Toni started to freak out, because she couldn't stay in a cell for the rest of her life. She would go crazy. "You will kill the Super Soldier project." She had to find a way out of this.
Thumping the picture in his hand, Pierce stepped toward the Asset. "Imagine what we could do if we get that time traveling device working? We can change everything."
The former Russian spy wasn't the only one annoyed at the touch. Even if he reasons were different, Steve was as well, and he couldn't hold back his annoyance. No one noticed though, which was probably good as he couldn't help but glance down at his own arms before looking back to Thor, who was still eyeing the genius.
"Were too, Punk," Barnes replies as he leans toward Rogers and pulls him in for a kiss. It's a wet kiss that has both men panting for air when they're finished. Their lips are red and wet, and their faces are hot and rosy. Tony doesn't feel left out as he watches them. He enjoys watching them, even if he say he doesn't—not that he can. Watching these two turns him on, and he wants nothing more than to rip off their clothes.
Toni watched Bucky as he rounded the corner. She didn't know what happened next, but she heard a struggle with a few colorful words and then something falling to the ground. Panic, she dashed around the corner with her gun in her hand, ready to use it, but instead, she was shocked to find Barnes standing over a body with a knife in his hand. Blood dripped from the blade. "Bucky," she uttered, shocked to see him like that.
he thought to himself. He needed to stop being so bitter, because there was no time for it. They had Loki to worry about.
Her eye twitched. Out of the many things she needed, a therapist wasn't one, because she didn't freak out. Sure, she had small, very small, extremely small attacks (not panic attacks-she refused to call them that), but she did not need a therapist. That would mean she needed to talk to someone and she didn't. "I'm fine, Salty."
Toni, unwilling to panic just yet, narrowed her eyes at him with a pointed look, while she forced herself to take a deep breath. "You either stop this car, or so help me, god, I will punch you and shove my foot up your ass."
"Then let's get started," She stated with a smile, but that smile would not last long. In a few minutes, she would regret not listening to JARVIS.
"No stop signs-" Toni stopped as JARVIS had down turned down the volume. "Hey, what gives?" she asked, demanding answers.
Steve squeezed his eyes shut, trying to get some sleep. He needed to sleep, damn it, or else he would go crazy. Everyone else already thought he was crazy though, which was why he was left behind while everyone else went out.
Anyhow, I am again sorry for the long update. Also, I would like to say that it may seem like I am rushing through Iron Man 3, but I have a reason for that. I don't want to spend too much time on IRON Man 3. I just want to get past it.
However, for some reason, he couldn't stop himself from casting judgement on her—and these judgements weren't facts. Sure, he had given assessments and reports to his handlers when his mission called for it, but this time was different. He wasn't supposed to draw conclusions on the woman, which was what he was doing, and with every passing second, he was drawing more and more conclusions as he watched her. Questions formed in his mind, as he ignored the shape pain at the back of his head, trying to figure out what made her so special-because she was special. Special in some way, and he could feel it in his bones, though he had no idea as of why.
, and she wasn't even looking. But now, she's trying, which is saying something as she isn't exactly fond of you," she exclaims, sounding exhausted and a bit angry. "So don't be an ass, because I will kick your ass, and it won't be fun."
After the 4th try, Toni gave up, as it felt like the world was coming down around her. With her vision clouding, she racked her brain for someone to call. She thought of Pepper, but that woman had made it clear that she didn't support her in her super hero life and she needed to put distance between the two. They may have loved each other dearly, but sometimes love wasn't enough. God, how could she allow herself to push away Pepper, a woman who had been there through everything? But she would answer, right? She had to. "Shut up." In a split decision, she dialed the red head, but with her heart-breaking, Pepper didn't pick up.
Now, if Toni knew that, she would've given Steve an answer. Maybe, she was scared. Okay, she was scared. God, she was scared of so many things, and it didn't help that her brain was running in ten different directions. "I don't know." She paused for a second, biting her lip. "Maybe, a little scared." She admitted, closing her eyes.
Closing herself off, she couldn't make out what was going on around her, though she couldn't find it in herself to care. She needed to get away before she completely broke down in her panic attack. Her heartbeat was beating rapidly, feeling like it could pop out of her chest at any second. It felt like it was a million degree in the room as she hopped to the door as quickly as she could. She tried her best to ignore the growing fear in her body as she reached the door, and it took everything she had to open it and step outside.
"I am anything but old," he countered. Yes, he was over 90, but he wasn't sure if he considered himself a 90 year old. He had a body of a 25 year old, and he wanted to use it.
"Barton, you need to calm down," Natasha stated as they walked down to the labs. They both had suitcases in their hands, and each held heavy important equipment.
Toni glared, not liking the look that he was giving her. Why in the hell was he looking at her like that?
There was no doubt that he would have to face the Beefy Blond in order to get the Brunette, and like most men, he had had a desire to show his strength, so he could impress him. Even if he looked past that desire, there was a part of him that wanted to see that fight. Sure, he didn't know the abilities of the Beefy Blond, but he didn't doubt his own abilities. There was a reason why he was Hydra's best tool, as there aren't many who could best him, even on his worst day. It was these invaluable skills that could attract the Brunette to him… though why did he want the Brunette? What purpose would she serve for him?
"No, it isn't. I would be an idiot if I thought that." He took a step back from Toni and looked into her eyes. "I'm just worried that's all." He paused for a second. "You are important to…" He let himself drift off unable to finish it
The cabin they'd initially entered was primitive, but that was clearly deceptive. The back room wasn't a room at all; it was a cave, though Tony couldn't be sure if it was man-made, or if it was a natural cave that had been made more inhabitable through technology.
But he'd stuck to the parts about what Tony could bring to a team, and not to his personal history, and in the twenty-first century, being attracted to men wasn't seen as a significant drawback, just a detail.
Steve disappeared into the bedroom while Tony was doing that, coming out just as Tony was turning the water off to let it cool.
Steve considered for a moment. "We should keep it close to the truth," he said. "We became friends after the Chitauri invasion, so maybe we should let this fake relationship start there, too? The truth is that we learned to appreciate one another more during the battle, so we can just... build from that."
They'd kissed before. Technically. But even the one kiss that hadn't been for public display had been careful, controlled. Tame.
"Yeah," Steve said softly. He wanted Tony to have company, but he'd specifically wanted to be that company. And he'd specifically put music from the thirties and forties on that playlist because even though he knew that Tony wouldn't really like it, he'd think about Steve.
"We're not in public," Steve pointed out. "This is a private conversation." Then he frowned. "It is a private conversation, isn't it?"
Fortunately, Tony swooped in to save the day; he leaned in closer to the microphone and said, "That depends on the U.S. government. Steve and I have decided that we're not even going to discuss marriage until it would be valid in the entire country. Just because we're lucky enough to live in New York, that doesn't mean that we should have rights that other Americans don't."
Steve took Mandy back from her mother, and they both smiled for the camera, with Mandy's arms twined around his neck and her head resting against his cheek.
He didn't even turn to see if Steve was behind him--he didn't have to turn to see if Steve was behind him, he could feel Steve's presence in the room--just peeled off his shirt, his back still to Steve.
"You don't look like a waiter, trust me." Tony looked him over and nodded. "Definitely not a waiter."
Instead of answering, Steve cast an eye over the array of items on the table. Most of it was bits and pieces of circuitry, screws, tools, and the usual debris Steve saw in Tony's workshop, but off to one side, he spotted what he'd known must have been there.
So there was absolutely no explanation that Steve could see for Tony's ebullient mood today, or for the fact that he'd let a woman with pink hair paint a rainbow flag on his right cheek, or the collection of rubber bracelets, in a wide spectrum of colors, representing a dizzying array of causes, that he had around both wrists.
They'd already proved that they could do this--that nothing went terribly wrong between them if they had sex.
To what end, Steve didn't know, but it couldn't hurt for his teammate to have a more accurate image of him, could it?
When they got back to the Tower, Steve expected Tony to head straight for the lab or the penthouse, but instead, he followed Steve onto the floor where all the common living areas were located.
There were a lot of implausible scenarios, but Tony knew those were just daydreams. There were some things that not even he could have.
"This reactor," he started, using her word, "is very interesting. It's intergraded into your body. Why is that?" He learned forward in his chair. "When the doctors found that thing, you freaked out not letting them look at it. You had knocked out a few nurses, yelling at them not to touch it."
With the city disappearing behind her, Toni's speed picked up, and once she reached the speed she wanted, she spun—rotated continuously, creating a vortex of water around her. With the water surrounding her, she closed her eyes, listening to the water moving. It sounded like she was flying through a waterfall, as the water pinged against her suit. It was like a song playing, and she wanted to fall asleep to it. She wanted to dream to it as the world around her appeared and she finally found some peace. Flying in her suits could always bring her tranquility as she was safe, but this was something else. It was freeing to be the only one around and to be in complete control.
She glared at him. "I thought we were talking about you and the loss of your best friend. Not me." She closed her eyes as she hid her face in his chest. She didn't want to talk about herself, or how deeply she cared for Barnes. She didn't want to admit that she cared that much for him, when she had no idea of how he had gotten that close to her. "I'm sorry, Steve. I'm so sorry." Tears ran down her face.
to see it. She didn't want to be forced back into a hospital bed, because that sleep was not restful, even if she needed it.
Something in Barton changed as he followed her glance. His playful tones vanished as he took a step closer. Quicker and faster than Toni thought possible for the archer, he grabbed her arm, pulling her out of the doorway. He was gentle, though firm, with her, as he held out her black and purple wrist for all the world to see. "Did he do this you?!" There was a roughness in his voice that the genius hadn't heard before. "Did he?!" he pressed harder, when she didn't answer.
"Rogers," she muttered as he came closer. She tried to make herself look less pathetic and fragile than she really was, because even in this time, she didn't need his pity. However when he looked her over, Toni knew he was seeing past her deception. She had no idea how he did that, when no one else could.
"What else do I have in this bag?" she asked. With her good arm she reached into her bag (not caring about her broken phone), she pulled out the boots she had been wearing. "Yes," she said, loudly. She turned and eyed the door that the guys disappeared behind. Did they hear her that time? "They've been in there a long time." She wasn't going to wait for them to come out.
"Why would I do that? It's half the fun," he said, jumping off the table. "You agree and then I tell you."
Toni took a deep breath. She could see that he was exhausted. "Why don't you go to bed in your room?" she asked as she reached to him to help him up. She had no idea how long he had been asleep at the bathroom door. If she wasn't annoyed at him for his gentlemen qualities, she would hug him or something. He was so cute and adorable at this size.
for an update on your status. Hours, Stark! We weren't even allowed to wait at your bedside with Romanoff standing guard? Do you fucken know how that feels?" He's shaking in anger as Tony remains quiet. "Damn it, Tony, answer me."
Steve was about to respond when Phillips pushed back the flap on the tent and stepped out. "He might not be able to, but I can, Sark."
Putting on her best mask and puffing out her chest like she owned the place which she did, Toni limped her away over to the trio. "I have a bone to pick with you!" She yelled pointing at the newcomer. She could see both Natasha and Steve giving her a weird, surprised look. "Someone needs to tell you that's not how you get a lady."
Natasha walked behind him in silence, because there was no talking him down. He had to cool down on his own, and besides, she knew how he felt. Though Stark was a pain in ass, she cared about the genius and she would do anything to save her.
She glanced at the items. "Please tell me I don't have to wear a skirt, as I refused." There were a few things she could put up with, but she wouldn't wear a skirt. Yes, she had worn skirts and dresses before, but that was different. This was the army.
And this is unbeta-ed and I am sorry for my horrible grammar skills...it was a real battle to proof this.
"Yup," she stated. Maybe, I should just cool it. "If I insult you, I'm sorry. It's who I am or so I am told….a lot of people call me an asshole for my teasing. That I don't take anything serious." Maybe, that was why she couldn't keep friends. She took a deep breath. "Any help would be great though."
Toni thought as she remembered what happened in her own lab. However, if she was able to power it, it would either kill her or send her farther back in time, and she didn't want either of those things. She needed to find a way to control the device, but first thing first, she had to find a power source.
"I think you can agree, sometimes the best ideas come in the middle of the night," he replied, picking up the device. The Core fizzed in his arms but didn't activate in his hands. It was like the device was flexing its power.
Loki sat up in the cot and put the journal down, keeping it open with two fingers. "I had the desire to see your beauty," he stated with a smirk. "Interesting diary you have it." He fingered the pages of the book.
That was a total complete nightmare, but she wouldn't tell him that. If she told him that, she would have to admit that she thought her stalker was back. And if her stalker wasn't, then she was crazy, and she couldn't crazy. "He was just a random guy," she said.
"Like I can do much with this?" Toni stated as she tried to lift her broken arm. The very movement of her arm hurt. Is that medication wearing off already?
"Enough," Howard interrupted with an annoyed look on his face. "Let's get back to the task at hand." He took a deep breath. "Carbon polymer. Should withstand your average German bayonet. Although, Hydra's not going to attack you with a pocket knife."
? She thought. He had never watched, always leaving the room whenever they started. She wasn't sure of his reasons, and she didn't really care for his reasons. She just wanted him to die in a blaze of fire.
two." His smile is so large that planes can land on it, and Tony just wants to sock him. He's sure that he's not alone. If looks can kill, Clint would be dead, as Natasha is giving him a nasty look. "He doesn't like it when others cuddling with the genius.
"Let's get this under way!" Clint's yelled as he jumped over the back of one of the large sofas in the lunge. He landed heavily on the overstuff pillows. "I have places to be. People to see."
He stared at her. "So what can I call you? Jane Doe does not seem fitting for this conversion." He took the chair form the corner of the room and set down next to the bed.
Everything was pounding around her. It was pulsing, bumping like a speaker playing loud music, and all she wanted to do was cover her ears. Toni could feel the world around her explode—like bombs going off, though that could just be all in her head. Her head was pounding. Sure, she was in a middle of a battle, a fight with
However, it doesn't last long as it seems like Barnes had made it his life mission to win him over. Tony isn't sure why Barnes thinks it's so important, but he sees it in his eyes. He isn't sure what it is, but he sees how hard he's willing to work for it. He's a stubborn bastard, and there's no wonder how his relationship with Rogers works. They're willing to fight until the ends of the Earth for each other; they're in it until the end of the line, and that's clear to everyone. Tony likes to think that's why he gets light headed whenever he sees them as he wishes he had that. Not because he likes either of them—again, he's not teenager.
Tony was cranky because when they'd stopped to get hot dogs, the guy running the cart had looked at Tony and said, "Aren't you--" but when Tony had interrupted him to say, "Iron Man, yes, I'd be happy to sign anything you want," he'd shaken his head and said, "No, sorry, I thought you were somebody famous."
If Tony agreed to go along with this--and it wasn't like Tony seemed bothered by the picture or the caption, just surprised that he didn't remember when it was taken--there was no way anyone who had a problem with Steve being bisexual would ever want to imply that Captain America was on their side of any issue.
"I want to remind you that I'm not twenty, or a super soldier, and if I come now, I'm going to be out of commission for a while."
"Thor makes popcorn by hitting the bag with lightning," Tony pointed out. It didn't have a high success rate, but the coolness factor kept Thor doing it all the same. "But it's not about popcorn." Though he should probably have JARVIS keep an eye out for that, if Clint was that defensive about it.
"--but that doesn't mean that I expected an immediate second round." Steve probably could have managed that without a problem, but that didn't mean it was necessary. "To be honest, I had the ulterior motive of trying to get you to sleep."
"Next time, we're doing this my way," he told Tony, and was quietly pleased that Tony didn't scoff at the idea that there would be a next time.
Steve could hear Tony's breathing, coming more rapidly than it had before, just like his own. Then Tony said, "I'm trying to imagine it's your hand. Bigger. Calluses in different places. Stronger, so you have to be careful."
Steve got the hell out of his lab, and was incredibly grateful that Fury contacted him about a STRIKE mission that afternoon. Steve was on his way to DC by dinnertime.
"Leave more," Tony said. "I don't mind, I want you to," and there it was, a part-truth spilling out when he'd never meant to say it.
"Okay, good." Tony found another large pot, filled it with water, and set it to boil. There were some empty jars on one of the shelves; they could fill them with the cooled water so that they could keep a steady supply.
Steve turns away, ready to move to the next little cluster of guests, but he still hears the moan of pleasure when the taste hits Tony’s tongue, and when he looks back in that direction, he’s seized with the urge to punch the leer off Tony’s companion’s face.
Tony quelled his argument with a look. "Where anyone with the override code could walk in," he amended.
"Let me guess, it's the biceps?" Steve said, and Tony couldn't hold back a burst of surprised laughter.
"And turn off internal security recordings until the elevator starts moving again," Tony added quickly. Then, to Steve, he said, "I mean, unless you just intended us to stay in here playing tic-tac-toe on the walls for a while?"
Maybe Steve wasn't trying to hold Tony close to him for the few minutes he was allowed. Maybe Tony was the only one of them who wanted a reminder.
If Tony had seen him that clearly, how much else had he seen? Did he look at the meals brought to the lab, the insistence that Tony needed to learn proper fighting techniques, the unwavering faith in Tony--not always in Tony's judgment, no, but in his
"If I remembered that, this morning would have gone very differently," he said. "I thought I'd done something terrible, or at least hugely inappropriate, and I wanted to avoid a conversation that involved you being understanding. I didn't think I could handle being understood, not with a hangover. Not when 'understanding' is shorthand for 'please don't ever do that again, Tony, I'm trying hard not to run away screaming.'"
"I'm ready," Tony said, squirming under the palm held flat against his spine. "Seriously, that's all the prep I need. I've been around the block a few times, you know."
"Yeah, me too," Tony said. "You might have noticed that by how much I hated it when we stopped pretending to date."
"But I'm not trusting whatever it is until we take the time to check it out," Tony finished for him. "It's okay. Spit will do."
, because Tony’s explanations had been getting increasingly unclear as time wore on. If he’d had any sleep at all, it would have been because he’d face-planted on his workbench.
Steve wasn't as sure about himself. "I feel like a waiter," he muttered, as he and Tony walked into the hotel where the event was being held.
"One of the smartest people?" Tony demanded. It was ridiculously predictable of him, of course, but the traces of uncertainty were completely gone from his voice.
The images that remained online still infuriated Steve--lots of captions about American traditions and old-fashioned values--but the lawyer had said that there wasn't much they could do about them, since the wording was ambiguous.
Some weeks, they had plenty of time, but very few of them had the inclination. Tony certainly didn't, and he paid the catering company.
"I was also in bed." Tony leered at Steve, exaggeratedly enough that Steve laughed in spite of himself.
By the time they'd brought their captives in and gone through debriefing at SHIELD, Steve had been away from the tower for almost a week. Enough time, he hoped, that Tony would have been able to forgive him.
"He hasn't even asked me yet," Tony said. Then, to Steve, he added, "And since you're an old-fashioned guy, I expect the ring, the going down on one knee, the whole deal." Steve looked at Tony's shoulder, because looking him in the eye felt dangerous, while the audience chuckled.
He didn't want to read them at all, but if he was interpreting that tweet correctly, he was probably going to have to. The team who handled all the Avengers' official "social media presence" was going to want to know what Steve wanted them to say about this particular situation.
"Not necessarily." He grinned at Steve, and Steve felt something in his chest ease. "I'll sleep when I'm dead," he added, and headed off toward the elevators.
He'd realized a week or so ago that he had Tony in mind when he drew them. He'd been envisioning some day in the future when they got Tony back, and he could sit Tony down and show him what the team had been up to while Tony was gone.
He did that often enough as it was. Not that Steve seemed to notice, and maybe that was for the best; Steve didn't need to realize that Tony was a lovesick idiot. He could stay oblivious, and Tony could keep what they had.
It was a good thing that was old armor Tony hardly ever used. Steve wasn't going to be able to look at it again without remembering what he'd seen.
"Does that mean that as soon as the entire country has marriage equality, you'll be getting married?"
“I was just here to pass the hors d’oeuvres,” Steve adds, and maybe the inanity of it does the trick, because the agent in charge nods, and a few minutes later, they’re alone in the lobby.
Tony didn't disappoint him now; it took a few seconds, another nearly-audible swallow, and then he went on. "I'm not as in love with my own tech as you might think," he said, "so I was thinking about you. Which could have been something you never wanted to know about me, but I don't think it is, and besides, you asked."
“Some people,” Steve replied, “might think it’s a little creepy that every time you crash after spending days in here, you sleepwalk straight to my bed. Not me, but some people.”
He was about to ask JARVIS if that would be a good idea when Tony walked right past him, climbed into Steve’s bed, and pulled the covers up over himself.
Either Tony had canceled a date with someone else to bring Steve here, or he'd pulled strings to get them a table. The latter seemed more likely, since to Steve's knowledge, Tony hadn't been seeing anyone lately. And, while he wasn't proud of it, Steve did pay attention to that.
He was going to miss that. Not that--that one kiss aside--there had ever been anything about those touches that wasn't completely platonic. But it meant that Tony was drawing back a little from their friendship, and to understate things, that wasn't great.
And then Bruce said, "Cap? Tony? You guys still there?" Then, to someone on his side of the portal, "You're sure these were the settings when we talked to Cap before?"
Steve's expression softened a little, and he gave Tony what looked like a shy smile; even the tips of his ears went a little pink. Okay, if that was what being sincerely complimented did for Steve, Tony was either going to have to do it a lot more often--if he went the self-indulgent route--or a lot less often, if he took the option that was less of a danger to his emotional stability.
He couldn't remember them ever taking their time like this before. Steve was moving a little faster inside him now, but still not in a rush, and the friction of Steve's body pressed against his was enough to keep Tony aroused, but not in any hurry to come.
"Hey, Cap," he said when the discussion was over and everyone was starting to go their separate ways, "want to grab some coffee in about half an hour?" They usually did that after Saturday training sessions. It was one of the ways Tony tortured himself.
drool a lot. With her stomach growling, her neck cracked painfully as she looked up. She wasn't sure if it was the food calling her name or the 'bed' she found herself on after a long night of Star Trek that made a her grumpy. Though, calling it a bed was generous. In reality, it was nothing more than a fold out chair with a lumpy mattress, which was hard as a rock. She supposed it was better than the floor or the sofa-not by much. "Better not be burning the bacon." she mutters with a long moan.
Toni sighed, as she closed her eyes. "Not my fault that you have the abs of a god. Not even Thor can compete."
Toni was so close to him that she could hear his breathing change and it made her wonder if she had gotten to him. Sure, she had insulted him, but she didn't think those insults had affected him as much as that statement did. It made her feel guilty, and she hated to feel guilty.
Sharon made a face, a definite yes if Toni ever saw one. "Still not the worst thing I have ever done while undercover," she replied, putting eggs and bacon on the plates. "Call girl. Dancer—more than once. You don't realize how stupid men are. Just show some skin and they will tell you anything.
However, that doesn't stop him from turning on the comm and turning to the Avenger's channel. He doesn't alert the others to his presence as that'll create questions that he doesn't want, questions that he doesn't know how to answer. There's no doubt they had noticed his absence. Plus, he doesn't know what Wanda had told them, not that he expects her to. She doesn't seem like one to talk, but then again, she isn't his biggest fan no matter what she says.
The Asset had no idea to who these words belonged to and who or what was a Buck. What was a Buck? The Asset wasn't sure and troubled him. It wasn't like he cared or mattered where these words came from, but it was a clear sign that he needed repairs. What good was he if he wasn't functioning at 100 percent? Why would his handler want a tool that wasn't working?
She laid out all of the outfits on the bed, as she was unsure which one to put on. Each was too girly for him, but at least they had high neck lines, which would hide the fading reactor. "Let's go with the dresses, because it would be too much work with the skirt," she moaned. She hated dresses, and she knew the future Rogers would be having a kick out of this. He had told her once that he had always wanted to see her in a dress, as he had never seen her in a dress. He wasn't even sure she owned a dress. She did of course (thanks to Pepper), but they were hidden in her closet.
Natasha took a deep breath as she eyed him. "You don't need to worry. Loki struck out. He wasn't able to make contact. He tried a few times." She turned back to Bruce. "Is he okay?" she asked, knowing that she couldn't ask Rogers that.
"So he's Rogers again," he teased as he took a step closer. "I have a chance now." He winked at her.
Toni held back her snort, because she wasn't sure if she was 'back.' Her nightmare was still on her mind, and she still felt like she was falling to her death. The famous
With her arms on the table, she rested her chin on her hands and stared at each of the pieces. She would need some kind of heating element to fuse them together. Maybe, there was something at the tool store that she could use…or there was that idea she had earlier.
Tony's eyes drifts over Rogers, taking him in. He's wearing low riding sweats and a tight shirt that he can't look away from. "No."
"Insanity is a relative word," Madame Hydra said. She stepped away from Toni, pulling her hair harshly as she walked away. "Just kill him already."
"Something tells me you're lying," Howard joked as he stood up. He pushed the table away from Toni, so he could knee down in front of her. "I have been bitten by that device. I know how much pain you're in."
Toni let out a chuckle. "Which I will. Right, let's do this," she said, turning to the whiskey bottle. She knew it would be stupid to take another shoot, but she needed it.
She smiled at the sound of her name on his lips. "In here," she demanded as she looked around. People were looking at them. As she didn't want to have this conversion in public, she pushed open a door a few feet from her. She glanced around the room quickly to make sure it was free, and to her luck, it was empty. "Get in," she ordered as she pulled Rogers in. She didn't expect to pull him as easy as she did, since he could've easily fought her off.
After a few seconds, Rogers closed his eyes in awkwardness. He sat straight back against the couch as she sat on her knees at his side. Her body was inches from him. "How did you get this?" she asked.
Steve knew that Bruce was probably right but he didn't want to give Toni time. He needed to tell her now, before it was too late. What if something happened to her? What if she disappeared again? "I need to talk to Toni."
"Let's take this back to our room," Steve says, his voice husky. He's watching the two with an intense look in his eyes. "I think we all need to be reintroduce to each other. Been
Pepper glanced toward Steve, studying the tension in his shoulders. Though she had no idea of what Toni said, she knew it couldn't have been anything good. However, she also knew it must've been more than that conversion to send the genius out of the tower. "What did she say?"
She took a deep breath. "It isn't that you're ugly….or wait it is," she chucked. She switched their clothes and walked out of the room with her head held up high.
"I thought…I was going to hurt you, Tony. I thought I would wake up and find you…in the puddle of your own b-blood. Killed from my own hand," Bucky whimpers, continuing. His voice is shilling, and it breaks Tony's heart. He sounds like he has lost everything that he has ever cared for.
Yes, Pepper knew he was right, but Toni didn't always think clearly, always doing things half-cocked. The CEO couldn't help but wonder where Toni would be without her. Would she even be alive, considering how many times that she had to force the genius to eat? "She doesn't know what's good for her," she replied.
Steve didn't say anything as he watched Fury disappear through a door that he couldn't follow him through. He just stared at the glass doors, wondering why Fury left. What did that man want to show him? He wasn't even sure that he trusted this man. Why would he? This man showed up and told him nothing. There was no proof that he could trust him, besides the fact that he was a part of SHIELD which evolved from the SSR.
Toni shook her head, as she tried to focus. "Wait, what? Take a step back," she ordered. "Explain this to me. What bet?"
"If I can sneak into Stark Industries, I think I can sneak out of this base," Toni said with a smile. "And I have my trusty guns." She padded her guns.
give up, no matter how bad it looks or feels. No matter what." She took a deep breath and turned back to the Captain. "I…" She started before drifting off. "Though I can't understand what she's going through, I know how it feels to reach rock bottom and be overwhelmed by one's own past. I know how it feels not to know which way is up, Steve."
"It is. Trust me, Shellhead." Though Steve didn't want to admit it, he knew about the side effects of sleep deprivation; he knew about the mental state of a person who couldn't sleep, who went without sleep for days. It wasn't abnormal to see things when you hadn't been sleeping, so it didn't worried him too much. What worried him was the fact that she hadn't been sleeping in the first place. "What do you want to do?" he asked, his fingers running up and down her back. "We'll do whatever you want to do. Though we should eat first."
Toni let out a weak laugh as she adjusted herself. "Me watch myself? You don't know me every well, do you?" she asked.
He glanced from Banner to Toni and all he got was angry. He couldn't understand how she could be flirting with him so soon. She just met the guy and she was already flirting? It just annoyed him so much, and he just needed to get away before he did or said something he would regret.
With a grace that could match the Famous Captain, the man in the black mask charged. His movements were fast and controlled and impossible to track if not for JARVIS. He was super human. Again, she would be amazed if this man wasn't killing people and charging at her, but this was not the time to think about that. She had to take him down. "Stand down. You wouldn't want me to hurt you, would you?" she asked, firing her gauntlet blaster. He did have an advantage over her: he didn't care who he hurt.
Toni found herself twitching again. Did he always think about sex? He was worse than she was, and that was saying something. "Yea, because I so want to have sex tied to this hard ass chair," she said, coldly.
Even though it didn't seem like it, she wanted to sleep, but the idea of it scared her, especially if she couldn't wake up. She hated it when Salty had sedated her, and it almost gave her a heart attack. She didn't know what she would do if someone tried to sedate her again. Her hands went straight to the dog tags hanging around her neck, and she squeezed. These tags had become a lifeline to her, and even if she didn't want anyone to know about them, she didn't know what she would do without them.
Tony doesn't go to movie night, and no one comes down to get him. He doesn't know if that's a good or bad thing. He decides it's for the best anyhow. He needs to distance himself, because those three little words are haunting him. He's glad that he hasn't said those words yet, as this would've been so worse if he did… Though he wonders if it really will be, as he already feels like shit and an idiot for thinking this could work. He should've known better.
"How can you tell?" she asked as she shook his hand off her. "You should watch calling me Stark. We don't want anyone to hear that."
Rhodes clearly didn't like that idea. "She dumped me in the middle of nowhere! I want to talk to her." He stepped toward the door. "I'll find her on my own. I know her well enough to know where she could've gone."
Taking a few deep breaths, Toni reached for the payphone. It was cold against her hand, though she paid very little attention to it. It was nothing compared to what she was already feeling. Without a second of hesitation, she dialed the Stark Secure Server, not knowing who else to call. Considering her house was just blown up, she doubted she would be able to reach Steve, as she knew what the SHIELD's protocol was. Yes, she could call the Pirate, but she didn't trust him, not at all. He was a spy, the spy of all spies, and he was always be up to something.
He'd just poured himself a drink and opened the refrigerator to look for something to eat when JARVIS interrupted the music Tony'd had playing in the background. "Sir, Captain Rogers has asked me to inform you that he has returned to the tower and will be in his quarters for the remainder of the afternoon."
He had to wonder if Tony was seeking him out in his sleep for the same reason that Steve didn’t really mind these nighttime invasions. If maybe, Tony wasn’t as fond of him as he was of Tony.
Right now, Steve crooked his fingers again in the way that made Tony's breath hiss between his teeth.
The sound of the door opening still woke Steve, but he lay silently in the darkness, waiting for Tony to join him.
Steve wasn't sure whether he hoped the answer was yes or no. Would he rather know that Tony had overlooked him, or that he'd realized what all Steve's little gestures meant, and decided that Steve wasn't worth the effort?
"I think that might be something I'd be interested in," Steve said, and then he stopped talking so that he could focus on the way it felt to push a wet finger into himself, how it felt to be stretched and filled, how much better it would feel when it was Tony--Tony's fingers, first, but also, Tony's cock.
cheat?" but, as Steve would have expected, Tony handled those with aplomb, and without putting any blame on Steve.
"I don't want to talk to Sam," Tony said, which felt like a subject change at first, until he said, "Obviously, I want to talk to Sam. I want to figure out a way to get me out of here and leave Ultron behind, and Sam's more help on that front than you are."
His cock throbbed, aching for attention, but Steve didn't go back to stroking it; he just lay still, letting Tony's words wash over him, thinking about Tony's fingers deep inside him.
Steve folded up the soiled blankets on the bed they'd used, so that nobody inadvertently slept on them, and then sat on one of the other beds.
"I'm going to hold you to that promise," Tony said. "I'm going to watch you get yourself ready for me, and then--I mean, if you think it's something you'd be interested in--I'm going to fuck you, Steve Rogers. And you can hold
Their next speaking engagement together was in late July, at a rally celebrating the second anniversary of the Marriage Equality Act in New York and campaigning for nationwide marriage equality.
Surely he was; it wasn't like Tony had ever been a man of few words. That was Steve himself, although he might have been more talkative if he hadn't been so happy to listen to Tony.
Tony had suggested, rather forcefully, that maybe Bruce should check Steve out since he'd tasted alien food. It gave him a chance to call a car and get away, back to the tower, back to his penthouse.
Two days ago, they'd had the PR team tweet out the pictures Tony had taken of them, with their statements confirming that yes, Tony Stark and Steve Rogers were in a relationship and had been for quite some time.
The picture was definitely misleading; Steve managed to follow it back to the original photographer, and even in the context of the other pictures from the dinosaur battle, it still looked incredibly intimate. The facts were straightforward, though: there was nothing between him and Tony.
Tony noticed now that Steve had a paintbrush in his hand. "Sorry about that," he said. "This won't take long."
But when Steve tried to bring up the subject of the kiss, he never even managed to get the words out.
He'd been sitting on the edge of his bed--his new room had a desk and chair, but the chair was one of those metal folding ones, and it wasn't comfortable for long periods of time--but now he let himself stretch out, trying to will himself to relax.
Tony's attempt to convince him that he looked fine in the suit met with limited success, but Steve had to concede the first point. This was a fundraiser for a charity providing scholarships for the children of dead or disabled veterans, and they were honoring Steve for the work he'd been doing for them. Steve couldn't back out of this.
Well, not quite as simple by Steve's standards, since he would have just knocked on Clint's door, but simple enough.
"Good." It was less that Steve didn't want the rest of the team to find out how he felt about Tony--he didn't, at least for the moment, but if they managed to bring Tony home like they were hoping, that would change--and more that some of their conversations had been at least a little bit foolish. Steve had found himself talking about nothing in particular, just to keep Tony company, and he'd feel a little ridiculous if other people had heard him.
Steve laughed, but he lowered his head to kiss Tony again as he went back to stroking their cocks. The friction of Tony's erection against his was almost overwhelming, and when Tony arched against him, shuddered, and came, Steve groaned. "Tony."
She was the only woman he'd ever loved. She'd been a surprise, in that and so many other ways. He'd never met another woman he could feel that way about, and she'd shaken him, overturned what he'd thought he knew about himself.
And Steve wanted it to be like this, didn't want Tony to turn to a programmed automaton when Steve was right here, aching to give Tony what he needed.
“No, Captain. I believe it may be related to sleep deprivation. Mr. Stark spent most of the time you were away in his laboratory.”
Tony examined the breakfast tray. Fried eggs, bacon, potatoes, toast. Definitely not health food, but Clint and Thor were right: if he could get this down, he'd feel better. Luckily, his hangover hadn't left him nauseated; he was even hungry.
Steve did. "Hold one out," Tony told him. "Far from your body, okay? I don't actually want to shoot you."
Tony was quiet on the way home, and Steve wondered if he'd realized just how lucky they were that they'd come up with an excuse to not get married, or even engaged. It'd be a while, Steve thought, before the federal government came around to the idea of equality, and by then, they'd be finished with this pretend relationship.
Which was great, honestly, because not only was that Steve's plan, but it left his schedule free to accept last-minute invitations like the one that had come from Empire State University's Gender and Sexuality Alliance, inviting Steve (and Tony, if he wanted to come) to ride on their float in the Pride parade in two weeks.
"Oh, that," Tony said, shaking his head. "No. I meant it. I enjoyed tonight, especially the company. Come and have coffee with me."
"This is amazing," he said. "The food's great, too. I'm pretty sure I don't deserve this, after last night, but I appreciate it."
Even with that smile, Steve might have believed him, except that Tony followed it up with, "Anyway, I'm working on a project for SI right now. It's confidential, so I can't have anyone in the lab with me. You understand, don't you?"
"But you're right. Didn't want to see you all dressed up, looking gorgeous, when..." He shrugged. "'S no big deal, usually. 'M Tony Stark. I can find someone else. But you..."
Steve licked his lips, wishing he'd gotten himself a glass of water before contacting Tony tonight; his mouth was unexpectedly dry. "Me."
Tony shrugged. "Because you hate big flashy events. Because you didn't approve of how much I was drinking. Because you felt sorry for me. Am I wrong?"
"A couple," he admitted. "But let's take things slow, yeah? I wouldn't want you to get the wrong idea about my intentions." He leaned closer, kissing Steve gently. Kissing him did feel familiar, and not just because of their earlier kiss this afternoon; he supposed his subconscious hadn't completely forgotten what happened when he blacked out last night.
"Steve, I swear, I will give you a picture you can look at any time you want if you'll just do something," Tony ground out through gritted teeth.
"And Captain America doesn't need our life story," the first woman said gently, coming over to Steve and disentangling the girl from him. "Tell him it was nice to meet him, Mandy, and then we're going to let him and Mr. Stark go on with their day."
"Hey, Tony," Steve called. "It's just me. You've been holed up in here since this morning, and I"m guessing you haven't bothered to stop to eat. I brought you a sandwich."
He looked thoughtfully at his sketchbook, then started roughing in a figure, lying on his back on the "ground," his head pillowed on his folded arms, one knee bent.
“Maybe you’ve never had the right motivation.” Steve waited until Tony was settled in the bed, then rolled over onto his side and put an arm over Tony, just below the arc reactor.
All the way back to the tower, Steve kept his hands resting on his knees, because if he let himself reach for Tony at all, if he even let his hand brush against Tony's, they were going to be breaking a lot more than traffic laws before they got home.
"No, that's not it," Steve said. Stark Industries had done everything they could to help the Avengers regroup after Ultron, and Sam was doing a great job getting everything running and keeping it operating smoothly.
sounded great, because an hour out of the tower without having to be "on" as half of "New York's premier superhero couple!" was becoming a rare thing.
"Yeah. And I have enough time before my meeting. There's an all-night diner not that far from here. Let's go get breakfast."
"Later, maybe," he repeated, and Tony grinned. That did sound promising. "But let's skip all the stage dressing and go straight to the point. We still should probably talk about what happened last night."
"Tell me you're not really this obtuse." Tony was laughing, though, so Steve knew he didn't really think Steve was that naive.
"Yes, I want to know what you were thinking about." Steve took a few steps closer, until there were only inches between them. "I'm really hoping it's along the same lines as what I was thinking when I saw you."
Steve frowned. "Why not?" He'd been under the impression that all of Tony's talk about wanting to avoid complications hadn't really been relevant to
Tony didn't like that Steve clearly felt the need to put a lot of space in between them. That was something new, and it was his fault.
But the tray in his hand is big and solid enough to use as a makeshift shield if there’s trouble, and this was the only way they could get someone in here as backup, in case things go wrong for Tony.
"If you're hating it, and I'm hating it, then why don't we just not have it, and say we did?" Tony's smile looked a little frayed around the edges.
"How about you do that?" Tony dug out his wallet. He looked the three of them over and handed some cash to MJ. Not that he thought Peter or Ned would steal it. She was just the least likely of them to be the victim of some absurd run of improbably bad luck that would end up with Tony's money being eaten by a coyote. "We need more trash bags, I need a black Americano, Steve wants a flat white, no sugar, and get yourselves whatever you want."
"I'm really not," Tony agreed. "Which is why I'm letting you drag me into an elevator, instead of me dragging you onto the hood of a car."
"Did I say that? One, I'm used to that kind of event, and two, I had a good evening. I promise. In fact, I'm not even ready for it to be over yet." He grinned at Steve. "Now, in the old days, I'd have dragged my date off to a party or a club to balance out all the earnest goodwill of that awards dinner..."
On the jet back to New York, Tony kept starting to say something to Steve, and then changing his mind. Eventually, though, he said, "Thanks. For today, I mean. I know it can't have been much fun for you, listening to me talk about AI development and then looking at a bunch of buildings."
Later, Steve promised himself. Later, when they were in that bed, and they had more time, and Steve wasn't quite this desperate to touch Tony.
But that was definitely a groan, hoarse and ragged like it was being dragged out of Tony's throat. And it had to be Tony; if there'd been an intruder, and Tony had the upper hand to the point that his attacker was groaning in pain, he'd have had JARVIS sound the alarm.
"So what's the problem? Feel free to bounce ideas off me, Cap. It's not like I have anything else to do."
"As long as I don't get distracted," Tony said. "You're going to have to work pretty hard to keep me fo--" Steve assumed that was supposed to be "focused," but it dissolved into a strangled noise as Steve took Tony's cock out and gave it a few quick strokes.
"What?" Steve wasn't sure what there was to mention. Maybe Tony had been gently making fun of his insistence on doing paperwork the old-fashioned way?
"I'd make you ask me for it," Tony was saying, "but as soon as you did, I wouldn't make you wait any more; I'd take your cock in my hand and give you what you needed."
Neither of them did much talking--which again, was unusual for them, or at least for him. Steve usually seemed to like it when Tony talked during sex, so Tony made sure to do it a lot. But he didn't know what he'd say now, because the only thing he wanted to say was the one thing he wasn't going to.
Besides, Steve was going to be monopolizing Tony's entire weekend with the city's Pride festival. If he didn't get enough time in the lab beforehand, he'd probably go into withdrawal.
"Not really." Tony grinned at him. Then he stepped forward again, dropping the bit of metal he'd been fidgeting with on the table as he did, and put his arms around Steve. "Not when it means we get to do this."
But now Steve was giving him a long, measured look, and saying, "You know, back in my day--" and Tony was going to kill him, he was, he didn't want to hear how everything was better before the invention of the microchip, not when he was probably going to die on some godforsaken planet with no company other than Steve Rogers.
Face on like that, Steve's expression didn't look blank. It looked scared. Scared for Captain America, anyway, which meant that Steve's jaw was clenched tight and he was looking Tony straight in the eye, because Steve didn't back down from things that terrified him.
Tony couldn't possibly be drunk, because he and Steve had been together all day, and he hadn't been drinking anything but water.
Steve really should have been expecting the first question, from a guy with shaggy blond hair and a "Queer Rights Are Human Rights" t-shirt: "So, Captain America, does this mean that you and Iron Man will be tying the knot soon?"
"Never said 'she.'" He was definitely slurring his words a little, but not so badly that Steve couldn't understand them.
"Halloween was bad," the other, a tall blonde that Steve was impressed Tony managed not to stare at, added. "She hugged everyone in a Captain America costume, and that was before you came out." She shook her head, smiling.
Steve shrugged, putting his arms around Tony and pulling him in for a kiss. "What can I say? I want our friends to be as happy as we are."
If it opened again, they might not have time to waste. "Get dressed," Tony said, squirming out of Steve's embrace. "We need to be ready to move if they find us again."
And then, Tony had woken up and immediately sworn to Steve that everything he'd said and done the night before had been the alcohol talking, and that it would never be repeated again.
But that message via JARVIS had been a challenge Tony didn't intend to back down from. After what had happened between them in that shelter, Steve would know that Tony was just being a coward, and there was no way in hell he was letting Steve think that.
Tony shrugged. "This was about you. Believe it or not, I am capable of not upstaging somebody. And it's not like your right-wing fan club liked me anyway. I quit the weapons business, I have an education, I believe in science...."
It’s another twenty minutes before the phone in Steve’s pocket buzzes, and he ducks into the kitchen to check it.
Steve hadn't read too deeply into Tony's SHIELD file, or anyone else's. He'd wanted to get to know them for who they were, not for Nick Fury's opinion of them. The part where Tony was a narcissistic man-child who tended to self-medicate with entirely too much alcohol--that, he'd read. It was on the first page.
He realized he was expecting them to be stuck here for a long time. If this had just been an unusually heavy storm, the work crew would still be here, or they'd be out in it, doing some kind of emergency response. But this place looked largely deserted; there wasn't any fresh food, even in what he'd worked out was the refrigerator, and while there were a few clothes in the lockers, there wasn't much sign of habitation.
He was going to have to say something. Not the full truth, obviously, but something that Steve would believe.
But Tony didn't answer, even when Steve knocked again more loudly. He could hear something on the other side of the door, a metallic clanking, so he was sure Tony hadn't called it a night and headed to bed.
Tony hadn't even realized they had trays like this. Then again, while he'd had the tower built to his precise specifications, he'd left the furnishing of it up to a design firm he'd hired. He'd told them to thoroughly stock the kitchen. Clearly they'd taken him at his word.
The organizers had arranged a Q&A session afterward, because they knew a lot of people would have come just to hear Steve and Tony talk. Not that they didn't sincerely support the cause, but that was what actually got them to show up here.
, though Tony was going to blame that particular adjective on the whiskey. He didn't go around thinking of Steve as edible, ordinarily.
people felt was more important, and he was going to disappoint, maybe even hurt, a lot of people if he came clean.
Steve braces himself. Most of the time, he’s not even sure Tony’s aware what he’s eating; it’s whatever someone sets in front of him in the lab. To be honest, most of the time, Steve suspects Tony’s not even aware
The "someone else put him to bed" theory was backed up by the fact that he'd been lying on his stomach, with his head turned to one side. Sensible precaution when putting a drunk to bed, but Tony wouldn't have done it; the reactor was uncomfortable when he slept that way. It was also supported by the large glass of water and bottle of painkillers on his nightstand.
"Both." Tony raised an eyebrow, and Steve clarified. "Mine to let me grab some clothes, then yours? If you're planning to keep me in bed with you for two days..."
Tony shrugs. “Oh well,” he says. “Since you weren’t even a tiny bit jealous, I guess that’s not going to happen. It must not be my lucky night.”
"Does this look like someone who doesn't feel the same way about you?" Steve asked, and Tony struggled to figure out what he was talking about, until Steve pressed his lips softly to Tony's.
But the shelter they'd found themselves in wasn't all that well-supplied. It was a log cabin, basically, about twelve feet square. There were some primitive-looking benches along the same wall that had the door in it, and what looked like the cover to a well in the center of the floor, and that seemed to be it.
