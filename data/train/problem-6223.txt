The android was staying with him since he was feeling guilty for what happened to Rhodey, and the program that had helped to create him was still influencing his actions in a small way. "Indeed. I too find his actions rather distasteful."
Natasha rolled her eyes. "It might. This is a supernatural being. Meaning, collecting these pages just might be the ticket out of h-here." She stuttered that last part. But seeing that the rest of the group were too busy examining the new found page to notice. Tony did, but payed it no heed.
Loki hadn't woken up yet and was draped over Thor's shoulder as Thor nodded. While Natasha and Coulson just stayed silent.
A desolate Tony took another sloppy swig of booze before Vision had had enough and snatched the bottle away before tossing it into the trash, not before dumping the left over drink into the sink. "
And that brings up the problem with all of the electronics. For some reason, whenever somebody turned on their phone or tablet, the screen started to fuzz. Electronic devices are now checked off of the list of ways for outside help. Guess they had to do this the traditional way. Check out the area on foot and try to find something to help them find a way out.
Despite the disgust aimed at himself, he sought out Vision. He had been the last one to see him, also, he was one of the only ones he trusted implicitly besides Rhodey, Bruce, Thor, Coulson, and Pepper. Steve wasn't a part of that list. Not anymore. And Clint was halfway on his shitlist too.
And that's just what he did. That next Monday Tony, after 87 hours of no sleep filled with the engineer jumping at his own shadow, attended one of the charity galas that Pepper was always trying to get him to go to.
Tony had silent tears streaming down his face as he spoke to Vision. "I-I just don g-get it! Stev didn even
arrival. He makes as if to stand up, but two iron hard hands with ghastly long fingers grips his shoulders and shoves him back down into the couch.
Tony lurched backward and whipped his head around looking to see if there was someone nearby, dropping his half empty champagne glass in the process. No one was around. Tony breathed a sigh of relief, but then stopped. Why didn't he hear the champagne glass break? He glanced down and saw nothing. But that was impossible! How could the glass just disappear!? The engineer cautiously looks back toward the painting and feels the blood drain from his face. The painting was no longer of the Slender woods. All that could be seen was Slenderman's face and his gaping maw. The champagne glass was inside of the painting broken into jagged pieces and embedded into various parts of Slenderman's face and some in between his teeth and black tongue, causing black blood and pus to flood the rest of the painting and spill out of it. It dribbled down the wall and pooled on the white marble floors. Tony scrambled back with his hand pressed tightly against his mouth to prevent him from losing the champagne and meager snacks from earlier.
He walked up and stayed close. Lightly brushing his hand against Clint's. Clint looked over and offered a relieved smile. This was one of those times why he loved his handler so much.
This seemed to be the last straw for Clint, because after a muttered, 'Oh yes I can, just watch me you faceless fuck!' and took off running off of the dirt path and into the dark trees to the left.
"TONY!!" Steve screams as Tony finally comes to, coughing violently. Steve squeezes him tightly, sobbing. "I-I saw you f-fall! When I checked you, you-you weren't breathing! I thought that you we-were dead!" Tony squeezes Steve back, just as fiercely. After a long while, he looks around.
They cautiously entered the building and found dirty cracked tiles and a creepy looking chair sitting upright across the hall from them.
Tony started to send smug looks at Steve. And Steve was scowling back in return. Bruce and Coulson were the only ones who havn't said anything now. Tony looked at them expectantly. More so at Bruce. "Well? You guys comeing or what?"
The game is already on the ninth inning as they tune in. Hopes are high when they see the score is low and that the Bisons are up by two by the end of the top of the inning. The Clippers have the home field advantage on them, but as long as they don’t score three or more runs before the game ends, The Avengers will have them beat.
While Steve is sure there are countless things to do in Tony’s apartment, it feels strange to just wander around and poke in his things. His stomach contests loudly and he decides if he’s going to invade Tony’s privacy, it might as well be somewhere harmless like the kitchen.
Now it’s Tony’s turn to be a smug bastard. Ty’s expression is almost comical, his grin wiped off his face without his consent, his entire posture changing. His nostrils flare defensively, mouth twitching to try and form an ass-covering response.
“Rogers!” Natasha calls out to him just as he joins Thor at the bench press. “Hey, can I borrow you for a sec?”
“Janet is up to her ears in paperwork,” Natasha groans as she comes back to pass around their waters. “Which means I’m up to my neck trying to deal with transfers and all that nonsense. We had about three retire this year and another handful who are looking to trade up. Lord knows the Majors are clamoring after half our team after that game with the Irons,” she makes a face, pinching the bridge of her nose. “I have no idea where this is going to take us next.”
Another laugh escapes Bucky's chest as he leans up against the weight rack. "I guess now that I'm retired I tend to have more free time on my hands to stay on top of the baseball news circulations," he jokes dryly, Steve flashing him a pained look. Silence hangs in the air for a moment before Bucky speaks up again. "Don't give me that pity look, at least
“Do you like it?” Steve asks as they walk back towards his new home, ice cream cones they picked up down the street in hand.
“Call him. The cell’s got a built in signal amplifier so the landlines being down won’t affect it. You can let him know that you’re unfortunately stuck with me for the holiday,” he says crossly, turning away from Steve again to go back to work.
“Nonsense! This isn’t about me today— well, it’s always a little bit about me— but this is about you!” He gives Peter’s shoulder’s a little shake, murmuring something quickly in his ear that makes Peter stand a little straighter, immediately more conscious of his posture on camera. “Everyone is here to celebrate you lot, auspicious, fresh blood on their way to the top,” Tony looks back to the interviewer off screen. “Sorry to hijack the interview here, but no one wants to hear me blather on and on. Everyone should be hearing about these guys’ experiences. Today is about
“Yep, they sure do grow up fast,” Steve suddenly says out of nowhere, Tony looking at him in surprise. Almost simultaneously, the crack of a wooden bat against the ball echoed around the stadium, Tony’s reaction time slower than usual. There is an awkward beat of his legs not being quite ready to move, focus still on the first baseman behind him. His gaze immediately snaps to the ball, watching the arc and direction of it as it sails towards the back left corner of the field. Tony doesn’t even need to see the batter’s swing to know it’s going to be an out. He returns to first base without preamble, unhappy with the out but pleased that his lapse in attention wouldn’t cost them anything.
He dreams about the sensations. Tony’s tongue swiping over his sensitive flesh, the enveloping heat of his mouth, soft hair beneath his fingers as he cradles the back of Tony’s bobbing head, sucking him into the back of his throat without hesitation—
"The art you have hanging up is amazing," Steve compliments as the rest of them start on their salads. "Was that a genuine Klimt I saw in the foyer?"
Tony and Steve jump up and down in the dugout, getting caught in the fray of excitement of the rest of their players. A very strong start indeed, leaving Tony only
The victory couldn’t feel more hollow to Steve, despite earning the Stars the last, winning run in the final inning of game five. They had been tied for the last two innings of the game, two outs in, and Steve hit a home run. He had done it. It would be historically known as a momentous World Series moment, something any baseball player would hope for. But it doesn’t matter, because out of all the teammates piling onto Steve as the crowd goes wild, Bucky is sitting in a box somewhere.
” Steve practically loses his footing as Tony’s hand reaches up to gently fondle his sac. His balls tighten up as Tony massages them, and Steve is sure he’d be able to come if he wasn’t trying to meet Clint’s eye right now. “I’m just really sore today,” Steve lifts a hand to rub at his shoulder. “Think I p-pulled something,” he stamps down another moan, Tony being absolutely cruel as he continues to palm at him and stroke at the underside of his length with his tongue.
“If you decide to go out, please don’t go alone. Watch out for each other so I don’t have to, alright?” She points between all three of them now before grabbing her bags. “Now I will be lounging by the pool if anyone needs me. Please don’t,” She slips her sunglasses from the top of her head onto her nose and leaves them to their own devices.
"You're fifteen minutes late, sweetheart. Don't pretend you don't know where you get it from," Maria says sweetly, pinching his cheek. "Steve, darling, would you like any cheese and crackers?"
They drove out to their favorite restaurant, a little Chinese place that’s equal walking distance between both of their apartments. They’re recognized by the entire staff at this point, as a pair of regulars rather than famous ball players. They’re greeted in the usual fashion of being seized by the tiny Asian woman who simply asks to be called ‘Miss Sun’, accepting kisses on both cheeks as she pulls them down to her level.
Steve can’t quite believe it himself. They’re the #1 team in the entire International League, and will soon be facing off against the best team for the PCL to determine the top team of the Minor League as a whole. The PCL’s Champion has not been established yet, their top performers gridlocked into a much tighter race. It’s between four teams as of right now, who each have a handful of games left in the league, leaving things up in the air for at least a couple more days. One of these teams, of course, is the Malibu Irons, who are currently tied for first with games won and only up by one run overall according to Tony— who somehow always knew
Having their relationship be so thoroughly scrutinized is easier for Tony than it is for Steve. He’s immensely grateful to have someone so used to being examined under a lense to bear this weight with him. The positive impact their coming out and following public relationship has on the world far outweighs all the hatred and slander they’re subject to. They’ve changed the perception of gay athletes by action more than anything else by being undeniable power houses in their own right. They would become household names so synonymous with baseball thanks to their talent and careers that they would be impossible to talk around.
And here the Avengers are, a ragtag team that has in recent years sat comfortably in the middle of the pack until Tony came along and reawakened their fighting spirit.
The strength of the hug from such a small woman always surprises him. “I almost didn’t. Finished up with things a bit early and thought I’d try and stop by to see everybody.”
“I’m not gonna look,” he explains to the unasked question. “I’m just gonna watch your face and it’ll tell me whether or not I lost fifteen grand or now have thirty to take over to Craps.”
Tony can’t stop grinning as he gets to his feet, wiping the dirt off one hip as he turns to look smugly at Rogers over his shoulder. The blonde is glowering with a narrowed gaze and shakes his head. Tony shrugs one shoulder and winks.
Tony groans, trying to wriggle his hips back impatiently, but Steve has a firm hold on him. “Please,” he eventually caves. “
He has an air of maturity that goes even beyond his physical appearance. This is a man standing in front of him. Not that a very youthful, early-twenties Tony wasn’t a man in his own right. Steve watched him transition through what were meant to be his most formative years, full of change and mistakes and consequence and growth. The growing maturity was less noticeable when Steve was there to witness it, the development feeling more gradual and suspended in the way that time seemed to slow down whenever they were together. Now, after years apart and trying in vain to forget every plane of his face and curve of his body, the differences strike him with awe.
Currently, the Stars and the Mockingbirds have three wins each tucked under their belts, and the series doesn’t end until that fourth win is cinched. It’s all coming down to this final game to determine who will move forward to fight to be World Series champions, and since the Stars had the superior season record, they had the home field advantage for this final game.
“It’s not my fault!” He denies vehemently. “I wasn’t just going to sit there and let Hammer spew all that shit about me! He harassed me all weekend and he got what he deserved.”
There are fans in the lobby when they leave, both of them stopping to sign a few things and shake a few hands on their way out. Steve has gotten so used to Tony’s chilly exterior, that he almost forgets how good he is with people. It’s also easy to forget that despite all the controversy, there are plenty of people out there who like Tony—
It’s expected behavior at this point, but tonight his tardiness is making Steve’s stomach turn more than usual. Things have been tense between them lately— Well, for quite some time now. The last couple of years hasn’t been kind to their relationship, and it certainly hasn’t been kind to Tony either.
"Fantastic end to the season boys," Peggy starts, clipboard in hand. "We can get more into all the things we need to change when training for the next season starts. For now, you lot deserve a night of celebration. I'll see you all tonight at Kurtzberg’s." She brushes out of the room then as the cheering continues. It's an uncharacteristically short ending statement from her, but Steve’s sure there will be plenty of speeches and discussion tonight at the bar.
Steve is so stunned that he allows Howard to shake his hand a little longer than socially acceptable. His fingers are a little sore once Howard finally drops his hand away. "You're a fan of mine?" he asks in disbelief. Stark is one of the biggest names in the U.S. baseball scene. Their production company has made some of the best gear since the sport started. In the past couple of decades, they have begun branching into other fields as well. Automobiles, clothing brands, standardized police weapons, power resources, interior design, you name it. One would have to be living under a rock to have not heard the Stark name, but in the baseball world it’s considered blasphemy.
It breaks Tony’s heart that Steve still wants to give people the benefit of the doubt. He’s so dangerously optimistic sometimes that it hurts. “You were the one who pushed me to keep my career going and in tact. I’m trying to do the same here by telling you
“Get out of here, Steve,” Bucky sighs from his bed later that night, an hour or two after Steve had already thought he fell asleep. He looks up from the sketch pad he’s doodling in, catching the vague outline of Bucky’s profile in the light of the lamp. “Treat yourself to a bed for once, you’ve got practice in the morning.”
“Oh,” Steve glances over where he left the box sitting on the bar countertop. “Actually, no, I haven’t. I kind of came straight here.”
Neither of them have parents to give them away. It might be common to have a close friend or relative take the place of a parent to walk them down the aisle, but in the end, they had no desire to be passed off to the other by someone else. They were continuing forward in their relationship the way they came into it and the way they tackled everything in life: together.
Tony smiles softly and nods, pressing one more chaste kiss to Steve’s lips before he turns his attention back on the keys and continues to play until they’re both tired enough to retreat to the safety and warmth of Tony’s bed.
“Like hell,” Steve argues, the orthopedist not doing much to stand in his way despite the protocol he’s meant to follow. Everyone knows how close the two of them are. Steve is immediately at Bucky’s side, looking down at his left arm. It looks hyperextended, the skin swollen and already beginning to spot with bruises.
Steve considers himself a very open-minded individual and a fairly good judge of character. He refuses to make assumptions off Tony’s character only based on commentary from others, even if he did get a slight glimpse into Tony’s attitude earlier that day. That was a singular news clip that could’ve easily been taken out of context and wasn’t an immobile testament to Tony’s personality. The optimist in Steve wants to believe the interview had been some fluke and maybe the Stark kid was having an off day or has just been painted in a rough light.
Tony lets his gaze fall to the grimy bar top. “Uh, yeah. I just… went for a drive. Had to clear my head.”
Flashes of cameras immediately start going off now that Tony has appeared, the throng of them pushing against the human barrier of the police and hurling so many questions over one another that Tony can’t make out a single word. “Inside,” Hill orders, planting a hand on Tony’s chest to push him back into his house. They enter quickly and slam and lock the door behind them.
. So, what, I’m not able to do anything on my own so I should just keep letting everyone else breed and mold me to be their little fucking puppet? To fulfill some dream that was never even mine just so others can sleep at night thinking they
“Oh nothing,” she sing-songs, walking over to assembly-line dishes into her drying rack. He doesn’t have time to ask her to elaborate before she moves on to the next topic, perhaps for the better. “What about you? Any plans for Christmas?” She knows he doesn’t have much in the way of family or friends either. Well, he has
"Glad you could finally make it," Obadiah says from behind Tony as he finds himself a spot on the bench, sitting by the other two pitchers who play for the Irons.
Natasha smiles at him. “Absolutely. I hear his kids are big fans of yours anyway, Captain,” she winks. Suddenly it makes sense why Clint was always asking for him to autograph gloves and balls and jerseys. He always just thought it was for some gag. “Besides, I feel like I’ve heard so much about this Bucky guy and have yet to actually meet him. Is he cute? Single?” She asks jokingly.
Tony doesn't glance up as he sits down and starts to take the device apart. It's about the size of a dinner plate with four propellers on it, and that's about all Steve can deduce. "Drone."
, remember? Wholesome little cake topper who's the ideal poster child of America's favorite pastime. Who wouldn’t be soooo enamored by Steve Rogers? Howard’s obsession of you was as bad as the boys’ at prep school with Farrah Fawcett.”
“Thank you, Nat,” Tony yells to her over the crowd when she’s finally back on the ground with them. They embrace tightly, Tony burying his face in her hair. She’s believed in him as his coach from day one, even when he was nothing but a thorn in her side. She never let him give up, always knew what was best for him as a person and a player, and even today gave him everything he wanted.
The interruption in the form of a quiet knock comes from the doorway, breaking the hostile air. Steve assumes the man standing with a cell phone is one of the butlers of the mansion, because hired caterers were obviously just the tip of the iceberg. "Sir, It's Beijing calling back."
This was a newer tradition in the baseball world, and Tony loves the addition. Beginning last year, the Triple-A League put together a huge All-Star Championship game that was to take place in the middle of every season, normally the day after the Major's All-Star game. Since the Triple-As were split into two sections, the Pacific Coast League and the International League, these two almost never got to play each other during the regular season. Now, the crème de la crème are chosen from every team in the league to represent their division.
“Nah, I just looked all around he’s not there, but his car’s still here so I know he’s around,” Clint scans the showers again, now giving Steve an odd look. Despite the shower stalls having about a foot tall gap from the bottom of the floor, Steve knows they’re at a good enough angle that there’s no way Clint would be able to see Tony on his knees in front of Steve from his viewpoint. “You okay, man? You’ve been in here a while.”
"I want to start with, of course, our incredible and fearless Captain Bradley—" Peggy allows the applause to break out again, smiling at their captain who's sitting in a nearby booth, accepting pats on the back. "As you’ve all probably heard by now, Isaiah will be retiring after next season—" Awws and boos erupt from the crowd. "—And even though we didn't make it to the World Series this season, we still finished at the top of the division and did much better than we have in years. Isaiah, you've led this team and raised them up by leaps and bounds and we all thank you for the years you've given as both a player and a captain," Peggy then signals for Isaiah to stand. He shakes his head as everyone starts banging on the tables, starting a steady chant of
Tony shrugs, his mouth curled in disgust quickly morphing into a grin. “If it does pass we could drive down there. Carol could marry us. Ha! Imagine that. Two gay men getting married by a lesbian. I’d do it for the big middle finger alone. We could get custom-made rainbow tuxes and burn bibles instead of saying vows. Elton John can play the bridal march as we walk down the aisle.”
Bucky has always had these plans of grandeur, ever since they were kids. Telling Steve how they were going to tackle the world, Bucky either becoming an important astronaut, lawyer, detective, doctor, cowboy, all those things and more. In every fantasy, all Steve wants to do is to make art and play baseball. He doesn’t need to be some sort of super hero.
The only question he knows he can answer is the first one. He’s not ashamed of what happened with Tony, nor of his feelings for the man. He stands up from the couch and heads back towards the loft, knowing he needs to clear that up straight away and make his intentions clear.
Tony, however, is none the wiser. Steve takes his stance again, squaring his shoulders as his fingers clench around the handle of the bat. Tony's form twists as his arm pulls back and then snaps forward, the ball flying down the line. Steve lets his body follow it's natural, practiced swing, expecting that familiar crack as his bat connects with the baseball. He watches the ball come towards him, a curveball. Tony hasn’t thrown out too many of those so far, as that sort of pitch is too predictable and is actually one of the easier pitches to call early in a swing.
Steve follows after the Starks, his eyes glancing Tony's way as they fall into step behind his parents. Howard hadn't even so much as looked at Tony, let alone greet his son in any way. Any affection Tony carried in his expression thanks to Maria now melts into an unreadable impasse as they walk through the halls.
, he insists. Honestly, Steve isn’t even sure if Tony is sleeping with anyone else. If they didn’t spend almost every day and night together, and if Steve didn’t know Tony’s schedule allows for very little fun on the side, he might have the right to assume he is. They haven’t exactly agreed on any sort of terms for this… whatever they are.
He’s just coming out of two weeks of rehab, something he’s been fighting tooth and nail against for the past year whenever it was brought up. With combined efforts of Carol, Steve, Pepper, Bruce, and Rhodey, they were eventually able to convince him to take a break and go through a detoxing for at least a week. Carol was the real heavy hitter there, the only one with any authority to threaten Tony with being dropped off the leading roster if he didn’t go. Every time there’s a period of Tony not playing, rumors get stirred up that he’s finally being kicked out of Major League play because of his
Steve stumbles after him, wondering exactly how big this apartment is as they wind around another five rooms. They finally reach Tony’s master bedroom, Steve not really getting a good look around in the darkness before Tony has him pressed up against the door and is stealing his breath away with another mind blowing kiss.
Tony can’t tell if she’s fucking with him or not. “Er— Right, sorry. Carol, this is Steve. Steve, Carol.”
Tony does a remarkable job of not saying anything while Steve processes this predicament. He lifts his head slightly, folding his hands against his mouth as he stares at a spot on Nat’s floor, not quite having the strength to stare directly at Tony like he’s some sort of personal sun. “You’re here,” he states obviously.
It’s even easier than the playoffs, in a way. The Stars lose the first game to the Oakland Panthers, but then follow up with four wins in a row, ending the Fall Classic at five total matches.
No one is able to react quickly enough to stop Tony from lunging forward to shut Hammer up. He may have been able to accept the prick’s insults earlier in the week, but he’s had enough to drink by this point that any concerns for repercussions were out the window.
just yet, most of his personality tucked away in a studio space towards the back of the apartment that he’s renovated into more of a workshop. It pales in comparison to his labs at his and his parents’ houses back in California, but the scant space works well enough as a foundry for the ideas that just won’t leave him alone.
As his fingers run over his head, he briefly remembers the sound of his skull cracking against the ground. The flash of memory is gone in a snap, Tony’s brow furrowing. Where was he when that happened? Who caused it? He can’t remember anything beyond getting on the plane in D.C… He can’t even recall leaving the airport. Did something happen there? Why hadn’t he just taken a cab straight to Steve like he originally planned?
“I’m good, Coach,” Bucky answers without any hesitation, much to Steve’s dismay. Steve waits until Hodge walks away before he grips the sleeve of Bucky’s jersey.
“C’mere,” Tony nods to one of the chairs next to his bed. Peter moves almost robotically, coming to sit down next to Tony. His demeanor shifts once again, realizing that not looking Tony in the eye is getting a little weird. Nervous blue eyes flicker up to meet his face, teeth digging into his bottom lip. “That’s how old I was when I first played your old Cap here. Back before we were on the same team.”
Tony manages to get his right hand under control long enough to snake underneath his paper-thin shirt from an open slit in the side— since when did he own something like that?— He feels a small tube near the middle of his torso that’s solidly stuck into him, hand traveling up a little higher to a thin wire with something sticky on the end that he immediately rips off.
. His friends of course didn’t know the extent of their parting, but the whole team could sense something was off. Even Peter kept his mentions of his idol to a bare minimum after enough elbowing from Bruce whenever Steve was in the room. He turned his eye away from newspaper stands with headlines or magazine covers that had anything to do with Him. He went back to being ignorant of any and all reports in the baseball world, knowing He would be brought up at one point or another.
A naked man covering himself up with Tony's hotel bed sheets is not in the realm of possibility that even he could've come up with. Steve recognizes him as a part of the hotel staff, either a caterer or bellhop he had seen in passing. His uniform and Tony's clothes are strewn about the room, condoms and a small bottle of something sitting on the bed.
The worst part is, Tony knows he’s right. It’s not like the Knights are the only players who do it either. “Who said I was going to tell anyone?”
“Just for a bit,” Steve laments, letting Tony curl into his side the best he can. “Don’t want someone to find us like this.”
He keeps catching himself staring at Steve from across the room. They do their best to keep their distance; It’s second nature while in public. With inhibitions lifted, it’s much harder to keep his doe eyes to himself. Tony’s wrapped into playing some ridiculous drinking game in the kitchen, while Steve is leaned against the piano in the den, laughing and chatting with Thor and a few others. Their eyes meet at some point, Steve flashing him a small smile and a tiny wave of acknowledgement. God, he can be so cute sometimes. He’s pulled away from admiring his boyfriend and back into whatever heinous action he’s meant to perform after losing a game of Rock Paper Scissors to Quill.
Steve nods, knowing that there’s no need to explain himself or come up with excuses. He supposes that if he wasn’t able to hide it from Bucky for very long, it’s no surprise Tony’s closest familial figure figured it out either. It’s different than Pepper, a friend and a confidant knowing. Peggy is family to Tony, and she’s the only family he has left. Her support in this means the world to both of them.
“Welcome back,” Steve says dryly. Not an uncommon greeting, but the basemen usually sounded more smug about it.
“Figures,” Rhodey laughs, brushing off Steve’s weird behavior. “Now if you don’t mind me, I’m gonna go smoke our birthday boy on the lanes.”
Tony hesitates before getting out, turning to look at his driver for the night. “I feel bad you had to come all this way just to drop me off and drive back home. I can pay—”
It’s not until he feels the car slow and recognizes the peak of a church steeple that Tony leans forward, narrowing his gaze. Steve pulls off to the side of the road, parking along the sidewalk in front of an wrought iron gate.
Tony holds the door with both hands, trying to force it closed. "I don't know what the fuck you're talking about, man! Just leave," he sounds desperate now, pressing all of his body weight against the door to try and keep Steve out.
The sheets next to him are cold when Steve reaches out to feel, confirming that he’s slept in this morning. He’s hardly a stranger to waking up alone, whether Tony was sleeping next to him the night before or not. He dozes lazily in that state of semi-consciousness for a while longer before making an effort to listen for any other sign of life in the house. He hears mostly silence, the occasional whirring of wheels, and a dull thud from downstairs.
Without fail, Tony rebuffs him every time. At least he’s consistent. Steve becomes more frustrated as the days pass, not sure why Tony is being so purposefully distant from all of them. Steve wants to chalk it up to just trying to adjust to the switch-up in his lifestyle. The kid was barely out of his teen years, and just moved across the country and away from his home team. That’s enough to set anyone off kilter.
, implying that all they ever do is fight. That may have been the foundation of their budding relationship with each other, but they’ve come a long way and built up a mutual respect. They don’t have petty little arguments over every insignificant thing anymore, each of them having something to prove to the other.
“You said it yourself, I’m always able to figure it out,” Tony shrugs. “Honestly, I’m surprised no one else has caught you. You, and the thirteen other guys on the team who you probably roped into thinking it’s a good idea. I watch tapes of each player every week. I see how fast some of the changes are, and let me tell you, those results are
Tony smiles, his heart aching for his old team even more. “I’d be a shit mentor anyway. He’s better off having you.”
Tony grins at him as he opens the door right next to Steve’s, taking his baseball cap off the hook and placing it atop his head to complete the look. “But it’s so much fun! How do I look?” He holds his arms out and does a little spin.
"Clearly," Tony mutters under his breath. He turns around, crossing his arms and leaning against one of the shower stalls. There's no curtain or door, just the linoleum wall to separate one showerhead from the next. Steve almost wants to avert his eyes. He’s seen all the players naked in passing, but things suddenly feel intimate where Tony is concerned. "What, you didn't get enough of an eyeful last weekend? Nothing's private between us now, right?" Tony asks sarcastically while padding towards him slowly, causing Steve to take a step back.
dumb." Steve catches Tony bite back a smile and decides to venture closer into the ballsy/pushing-it territory of banter. "Doesn't change the fact that you were kind of being a drunk brat."
"Godspeed," Steve replies, giving Bucky a firm push towards the door. Now that he knows Buck is taken care of, Steve doesn’t feel bad about slipping out the back door and heading home.
Tony glances back at Steve and just shrugs, letting the man put a hand on his back to guide him over to another pod of tables. He snaps his fingers at a nearby waitress standing by the bar. “What can I get you boys to drink? Anything at all, it’s on the house. I’ll have Lana here be your personal waitress tonight.” He pulls a velvet rope aside to another one of the card rooms that appears the same as the rest minus the exclusivity barrier in front of the entrance.
"Don't do that to poor Karen," Steve chides, the two sharing a smile before he ducks into the computer lab.
Steve thoroughly scans the dugout when he returns to it, coming to the conclusion that Tony is nowhere to be found. He chews on the inside of his cheek in contemplation, glancing up to where Natasha is standing with her jaw clamped tight, lips pressed tightly together. Never has Natasha Romanoff ever shown nervousness before, but he imagines that he’s witnessing it for the first time as she stands there, arms crossed, heel tapping against the ground. Steve toys with the idea of prying into whatever is going on that caused Tony to get subbed out mid-play, but decides against incurring her wrath on the matter. At least for now.
make me not worry about you any less. You don’t get to just remove yourself from someone’s life and expect them to forget everything.”
Steve retreats to the living room, pulling the curtains apart by a few inches to let some light into the apartment. He tries Bucky’s cell first, knowing that if the phone lines are affected in the city, they might not be faring well upstate either.
Tony scoots closer to him on the couch, holding the photo close to his face to watch it develop, giving it the occasional little flap through the air. “Not too shabby.” Once it’s developed completely, he passes it to Steve for his own approval.
“Do you really expect us to believe that?” a voice shouts from the crowd. Tony’s reserve breaks, his eyes flickering up to see a blonde woman standing up in the aisle, heads turning to look at her. She seems familiar, but he can’t place from where. “Players from your previous teams have come out with stories of your suspicious, queer behavior.”
Tony turns his impatient gaze on him, hands on his hips. “Tools. Have any? Like, a screw diver? Tweasers? A cotton swab? A pencil? Rubber band? Literally anything?”
Everyone falls into the ground in a heap, laughing and still screaming as rogue snowball throwers scramble to their feet to keep the battle going. The kids are playing dirty now, attempting to shove snow down each other’s pants and go back to pick up the other sleds to use as shields as well. Steve gets to his feet, wiping some snow off him when Tony suddenly tackles him to the ground, a shower of snow accompanying them as the kids start kicking it up in the air.
“Probably,” Tony agrees, his eyes shining as he stares down at the floor. His expression sobers, lifting his chin to look at Steve. “I know you may not want me on the team, especially after what I did, but I came back to try and fix things. I’ll still try and do that, even if we’re not playing ball together but… I don’t know,” he gets a funny smile on his face, making Steve feel like he’s part of some in-joke. “It feels right for us to be on the same team again.”
Nothing can beat late summers in Brooklyn, not to Steve Rogers at least. The sun casts shadows across the open field, the dirt a deep red and marred with cleat marks. Trash bin lids are spaced evenly apart in a charmingly lopsided diamond, makeshift chalk lines stretching between each one. Chirping crickets accompany the steady sound of a baseball thumping against leather palms. It’s serene once the jeering and chatter of school boys drifts away, their game having ended on the cusp of dusk.
Steve sighs through his nose, watching Bucky pick the ham off his slice of pizza. Steve doesn't know why he always lets him order it if he hates the stuff. “You know how I play without you. Shall we revisit the great Bucky’s Home with the Flu Debacle of 1976? I didn’t hit a single ball the whole game and missed about six outs.”
Tony is hyper aware that Steve’s little detour takes him an additional twenty minutes before he rejoins the rest of their team, and the fact that he takes note of this is infuriating. Before the game begins, they all gather around Rezzo to be inspired by some rousing speech in the tunnel. The man is confident and well-spoken, a very good choice to helm the best of the best from the IL and definitely less abrasive than Whitaker had been. They line up to head onto the field first, basemen in the front, fielders and designated players taking up the middle, while the pitchers bring up the rear. Tony is the very last player in line as the relief pitcher, adrenaline roaring in his ears as they wait for their cue to walk out, the sound of cheering all around them deafening.
The high pitched ring in his ears gets progressively louder before it suddenly starts to fade, the sounds around him coming back into focus fuzzily, like his brain is rotating a dial back and forth trying to find the right frequency.
“We’ll figure it out,” Steve says confidently, reaching over to squeeze her shoulder. “The Avengers are a family, no matter what.”
"The kid can handle a lot of liquor, I know that much. He probably dabbled in some kind of fun fairy dust last night that knocked him on his ass. I saw him this morning and if anything he just looked like he'd been crying."
Ty freezes in the doorway, throwing one last icy look over his shoulder. “At least I’m still at the top. Look at where being honest got
Tony always loves making a big deal about birthdays. Personally, Steve thinks he just likes to have an occasion to tease him about how old he’s getting, even if he always insists that’s not the case. The extravagance in his gift-giving seems to come and go in waves. Some years he just buys Steve film for his cameras or sketching pencils. Sometimes the gifts are handmade, fun, little, mechanical inventions that Steve knows are one-of-a-kind… And sometimes he buys him, well, a house.
Steve tries not to blush at that. He knows the age difference isn’t exactly something to ignore, and he doesn’t just mean the old man jokes Tony is constantly making about him. As if their relationship isn’t controversial enough, the fact that they come from completely different
He ignores the jab, mostly because he has absolutely zero regrets about how that holiday worked out for him. “I think you should be thanking the snowstorm for that, not us.”
Dove is practically glowing with the attention Tony’s giving her. “Maybe I’ll see you when my shift is done.”
Her fierce insistence on protecting Tony’s well-being now makes a lot more sense. “Does anyone else know?”
“It’s, um…” Steve glances over towards Tony who’s cracking open his crab legs with his bare hands, a couple of small shell chunks scattering across the table. He seals his lips around the edge of the leg meat with a fervor, expertly slurping it out in one piece like he’s done it a million times. Steve is still fumbling with all the special silverware that came out with the meal, which was completely disregarded by the twenty-year old sitting next to him. “...A challenge. But challenges are rewarding after all.”
,” Tony insists. They’ve had this argument dozens of times, in dozens of different ways over the past couple of months. “My life has been hell since I did it and I’m not dragging you down with me.”
Patrons are staring at the car from inside and Steve suddenly feels self-conscious stepping out of it. He probably looks as uncomfortable as he feels, while Tony probably looks like he was born to drive the French Roadster. They walk into the restaurant together, the hostess whistling.
“Exactly!” Steve cups his face, staunchly keeping their eyes locked together. “You’re not done yet. You left the majors on such a bad note. I’m not saying you need a redemption arc to prove yourself to anyone…
Howard winks again and give Peggy a kiss on each cheek before squeezing through the crowd to get back to the bar, empty glass raised like a torch guiding his way. Steve stands awkwardly with Peggy for a moment, his eyes now trapped in the lingering foam on the bottom of his glass.
Tony chuckles. “I like to think you’ve whipped me into a much better-behaved player over the past few years.”
Falsworth and Morita are both on base, first and second. So they both couldn’t manage more than singles, and they don’t have any outs yet. This will be easy.
Tony almost pinches himself in case he’s dreaming. Steve is standing in his door in plain jeans and a dark hoodie despite it being the middle of Summer. He’s got a hat in one hand, blonde locks messy and flat in some areas from being tucked underneath it. He’s running a hand through them to try and fix them when Tony opens the door, offering that endearing Steve Rogers smile. “Sorry, were you expecting someone else?”
She nods thoughtfully. “My partner and I just had our anniversary last month. I’ve been with her for five.”
It’s a simple but spacious two-story house-on-a-hill a little ways outside of New York’s Capital, complete with a huge yard and a white picket fence. The outside is juxtaposed of white brick and mixed cobblestone, weathered naturally to not look
They’re neck and neck with the Columbus Clippers as far as won games and runs scored goes, the third team ranked below them already far below what was needed to keep them in the running. They still technically have two games in the regular season left, one more against the Red Wings (the same team they played today), and then a final home game against the Stripers, but both of those teams were also low on the rankings. Even if they lost their last two matches, they would have enough to carry them to the post-season.
“Consider yourself lucky,” Natasha says, coming around to his side of the table so he can reach out for his godson and the reason his best friends are losing so much sleep lately.
“Mmhm,” Tony sighs happily, tucking his face into Steve’s chest. The sound of the machine’s incessant beeping is replaced by the steady thumping of Steve’s heartbeat. “Had a dream… Can’t ‘member it now…”
He runs a hand awkwardly through his hair, eyes darting over to see Steve awkwardly staring at a fixed point near the woman’s feet, the back of his neck bright red. “Uh, same, I guess. I mean— not fishing— I don’t know how to fish. Just… a little vacation. My family owns a house in Truro.”
“Just some whiskey on the rocks. Whatever you have works,” Tony grunts, pulling a fifty from his wallet and tossing it onto the bar.
pushes inside of him. He’s missed the feeling of the man inside of him, realizing he was just as needy for this as Tony.
“You did fuck his face up first,” Rhodey points out as he walks over from the kitchen with ice bags for Quill’s developing black eye and Scott’s bruised jaw.
He scrubs through channels as he drives, eventually catching the tail end of one weather report stating there won’t be any snow until early tomorrow morning. The news channel immediately shifts back to the main anchor, summarizing the main events that Steve now misses out on due to Bucky assuring him that
“Um, well, it’s a series of twelve poems, so they’re all about something a little bit different. One of them is actually known for being the first ever documented myth about werewolves.”
Steve throws Peggy a grateful look as they follow the nurse through the double doors. It’s loud in the emergency wing, sounds of ringing and buzzing alarms mixing with nurses and doctors all talking over each other to form a loud cacophony as they bustle down the halls, the occasional patient in a wheelchair or gurney rolling by them. They’re led into an elevator and ascend up by one floor that’s a bit quieter with multiple rooms with windows up and down the halls. Steve loses his breath when he spots Tony through a window before they even reach his door. There’s another doctor and two more nurses inside the room, talking quietly and examining the readings on some big machine that’s next to his bedside.
Steve swallows thickly, backing himself against the wall. "No. Whether you are or aren’t, it doesn’t matter to me and it— it's none of my business."
With a sigh of his own, Steve humors him and bookmarks the page he’s on, closing the book and standing. He towers over Tony like this now, having a good eight inches or so on the billionaire. “Can I help you?” He asks dryly.
Rejoining the major league is still a possibility, but it all depends on how his knee heals in the coming years. Steve also has to keep in mind that he's almost thirty now, and the time is ticking on how much longer he can continue professional play.
, Steve?” Tony rakes a hand through his hair. “What makes you think that’s going to change anytime soon? You’re the one who made me go in the first place. I could’ve stayed in New York with
. It’s a win on all sides, right? No flack from the media for kicking me off the team because I’m gay, but all the close-minded fans will be happy someone like me won’t have anymore game time. They can always just fall back on the excuse of my injuries keeping me from the active roster. Me getting the shit kicked out of me was the perfect scapegoat to fall into Pierce’s lap so The Knights have no blood on their hands.”
Tony bumps into him as he shoulders past to pick up his... whatever it was. Some kind of contraption with propellers on it. Tony's muttering to himself under his breath, walking over to plop it down on a table. He scoops some kind of handheld remote control off the ground as well, placing it next to his flying doohickey. They're almost the same size, the remote having about five different joysticks and twenty different buttons in it in addition to a huge antenna sticking out of it.
Tony grunts. “Coulson and Hill run a pretty tight ship and don’t really let us out of their sights. But I suppose I could sneak away to the bathroom for a quickie in the stall…”
He’s not sure how long he drives for. Somewhere in the back of his mind he knows he’s upstate with only blurred road signs flashing by his periphery to give him any clue as to where. His tank is low, fuel light flashing at him. He gets off at the next available exit in the middle of seemingly nowhere, traveling another mile down the single-lane road before he finally reaches the gas station.
Right as Tony readies himself, lifting his bat up into position, a whistle is blown. He watches as the pitcher leaves the mound to be replaced by someone else. “Seriously?” Tony can’t help but ask, looking back at Whitaker for assistance. His coach is already approaching the Ump to try and contest, but the substitute was previously marked down and deemed perfectly legal. Tony swears under his breath, squinting up at the board to see the name of the fresh pitcher who just came in. Carson Greene. Tony knows about him— he knows about all the pitchers in the MiLB. It’s how he stays on top of monitoring his own skill level. He has to make sure he’s always outranking the rest.
“I’ll get the order in. Be right back with water and tea,” she smiles at them before disappearing into the kitchen.
“...Stark is on shortstop, Wilson is on third, and as always, Shade is catching. Subs might change by tomorrow morning, as always, there will be no questions, and you all can get out of my sight because you’re all goddamn filthy. Dismissed.”
His late start to the morning means he’s the last person to make it to Tony’s private box, the room already filled with familiar faces of close friends. “Steve!” Comes the disjointed cheer from the room as he slips inside, giving a little wave to everyone. Clint, Thor, and Rhodey are all getting food from the buffet selection, Pepper is grabbing a couple of beers from the mini bar for herself, Bruce, and Carol. He can see Nat and Buck’s backs from where they’re standing on the outside balcony along with both Carol and Clint’s wives and children, the kids clearly arguing over who gets to sit where amongst the three rows of seating once the game starts.
“Yes!” Tony pumps his fist as Steve jogs to first which allows Nancy to advance to second. He can see Hammer’s ugly tomato-colored face from here, his beady eyes meeting Tony’s as he strides forward, spinning his bat in quick circles over his wrist. Tony flashes a shit-eating grin, winking at the man who knows he’s getting beat at his own game.
“There are far worse things in life than being sandwiched between two beautiful redheads,” Tony replies before a loud interruption comes from somewhere behind him.
, or so he thinks, at least. It isn’t exactly something people were free to shout from the rooftops in this day and age. If the average person doesn’t outwardly make their opinion clear with hate speech, it’s a quiet thought most Americans have in the back of their minds about that community of people. Steve has grown up in this homophobic environment, not quite understanding why it hurts anyone else who you do or don’t love or sleep with. He has no idea how to put this into words and offer it to Tony in a way that doesn’t make him sound over-compensatory or belittling.
Peggy's smile was bashful now and she waves a hand. "Thank you, thank you. It's a shame that Chester's condition has only worsened, but I'm very happy he chose to leave the team in my hands rather than just sell it off to the top bidder."
I’ve seen that spark in this kid since day one and just know that every recruiter in the MLB better be trying to get Peter Parker on their roster for next season now that he’s back in action.”
His brain is still fuzzy and laden with alcohol as he straightens up in the driver’s seat, rubbing his eyes before he puts the car in reverse and backs out of his spot.
He smiles at her, holding himself back from trying to wrangle her into another hug. “I’m gonna miss you too. I appreciate everything you’ve done for me, Tasha. Seriously.”
The ER waiting room is hectic and swamped with people even at such a late hour. He resists the urge to shove his way past the line of people in front of the main desk to ask Tony’s whereabouts and status, but manages to hold back and impatiently wait his turn until he can speak with a nurse.
Steve ignores the arguing of his teammates, looking back at the elevators over his shoulder. The doors finally ding open, the last of their teammates stepping out of it. “There you guys are,” Steve chides, waving them over. “What took you guys so long?”
Tony glows under the praise from their teammates, nothing quite giving him the same thrill as Steve’s almost imperceptible shake of his head paired with a muttered, “
They have scheduled evening practices at Cashman Field for the next two days leading up to the actual game, everyone loading up on the bus a few hours later to get some time in. As they pull up to the stadium, there’s a second bus there waiting to pick up the PCL team who gets field usage in the morning. Tony enters the stadium with the rest of his teammates when a gratingly familiar voice echoes out through the entrance tunnel.
“Yes, well, I wonder where he might’ve gotten that from, dear,” Maria says. Even though she’s smiling, it comes across cold.
seen Tony’s record, and it’s fully in his capabilities to strike out every single one of them. He was quite interested, however. When they had played against each other for the All-Star game last year, Tony wasn’t even slated as a pitcher. Steve has never seen him actually pitch in real life and wonders if he’s all he’s cracked up to be.
It’s getting harder to breathe. Tony’s vision is starting to black out around the edges, his hands in front of his face blurring. The photos keep flashing in his mind, even after he squeezes his eyes shut. The moment that once made his heart race is coming back to do so again, now for all the wrong reasons. His chest hurts, lungs expanding painfully against his rib cage every time he thinks about Steve’s face. How could he be so stupid? So reckless? He’s ruined this. He’s ruined everything.
Natasha's eyes narrow. "We'll see about that. Line up, everyone. Time to see what our new pitcher can do."
“Boys, play nice,” Janet sighs. “I’ll see you in the morning for the meeting with Rezzo and the rest of the team, I don’t care what you all get up to tonight, but my one request is that you aren’t too hungover tomorrow…
crazy while cooped up in the same living space. For a few hours a day, he holes up in his workshop, not really caring if Steve is there or not as long as he sticks to the background while he works. There’s a home gym in the apartment that Steve takes advantage of, happy he has the chance to get out some of his energy and not deviate too far from his normal schedule so he doesn’t go stir crazy. When they are together, Tony is pretty good at finding entertaining enough joint activities for them to take part in. Some of them are innocent: watching movies, playing chess and board games, arguing about baseball strategies, even rearranging some of the artwork hanging on his walls. However, they also take advantage of their many hours of the day being unable to leave their residence by Tony slowly introducing Steve into the intimacies of same-sex intercourse.
, entering Tony one last time and feeling his entire body jolt with the force of it. Tony calling Steve’s name echoes in the room around them, the sound helping Steve over that edge as they come together. Tony’s muscles squeeze him impossibly tight as he jerks his hips upward with a renewed vigor, emptying himself inside of the man. Tony comes, completely untouched, spurting his seed between them, streaks of it landing on both their chests.
"Tony, please," Steve sighs, following him into the tiled room. "You can't avoid me forever, you know."
“I’ll let you boys handle it from here,” Carol cuts in with an eye roll before turning back to the players. “Happy to have some of you back. I look forward to seeing the rest of you prove yourselves,” she says before taking her leave.
"Aunt Peg!" he hears from behind him. Tony Stark shoots him a look of disgust as he brushes past him to get to Peggy, the glare immediately replaced with a dazzling smile for the woman. He gives her a tight hug and a kiss on each cheek. "There she is, the most valuable woman in the MLB!"
“Steve, what are you doing?” His eyes widen and his body tenses with alarm as Steve brings a hand up to cup his face. Tony’s hands curl to fists against his chest, clutching the fabric of his jersey and warring against whether he wants to pull him closer or keep him at bay.
Steve’s fingers gently card through his hair, coaxing him further over the edge. “Shh, no need to think about it too hard. Tell me about it in the morning, okay?”
Tony wonders if it had been easier to come out to Bucky than admit the identity of the person he was sleeping with. Realistically, he was probably just trying to keep Tony’s secret safe as well— he had no right to out even his boyfriend to
Tony releases the longest sigh Steve's ever heard from the kid. He's surprised there's any air left in Tony's lungs after a heave like that. "She always worries," he mutters, picking up a rubber ball off the counter. He starts bouncing it against the wall, catching it every time it comes back to him. "I would say I'd apologize to her about ruining dinner later, but it wasn't the first time I've done it nor will it be the last."
schtick, but many people in the majors don’t. I think what he wanted was to prove he could hack it on any team in the Triple-A League, no matter who owned it, and let’s face it, I think it was a good call.” Natasha looks as if she’s swallowing vinegar as she admits this opinion past her lips. “You can’t drop a kid that talented down anywhere lower than the league he’s at right now, it’d be goddamn ridiculous.”
Janet stares at Steve, shocked and confused by his outburst. “He’s got you fooled too then,” she laughs dryly. “Listen, I like him, I do, but this is what he does, Steve. Stark brings it all on himself with his behavior and then claims to be the victim to get nice people like you to sympathize with him… But you’re right, he’s not a liability.” She steps onto the bus, turning back to give Steve one last pointed look. “At this point, he’s a
playing. It’s a new challenge to be competing with people at his level, and Tony’s always been a sucker for a challenge. He’s also far from bored with Carol rotating him through positions every now and again, molding him into a jack-of-all-trades and formidable ace-in-the-hole. The Knights are on a winning streak, already expected to be a contender for the World Series despite the season only being half-over.
Pepper looks at him sympathetically, reaching out to hold his cheek. He leans into the touch, closing his eyes. “What did Whitaker say to you?”
It’s almost innocent, the way Steve points out the large fountain in front of the Aria saying how much he likes it. Tony grins, shaking his head. Of all the things to go to the Aria for, Tony’s first choice on the list is not architectural in nature. The Sin City would eat this man alive if given the chance.
“He’s just leaving the Avengers because he hasn’t been able to make kissy faces at Steve from the dugout the past few years!” Clint crows, coming up from behind to wrap his arms around Tony and start laying loud, smacking kisses all over his cheek. It didn’t take long at all for him to get to his normal, happy level of drunk. With most of Natasha’s family and friends being Russian, and Bucky’s company being, well, like Bucky, the wedding bar is fully stocked and the drinks have been flowing freely.
“Thank you for saying what you said back there,” he says quietly, a little bit of that initial discomfort coming back to him. He clears his throat awkwardly. “It was quick-thinking. A good lie.”
does, but even when it’s just him and Bucky at their favorite bar, he finds himself recounting all of his Tony-centric complaints. The man deserves a medal for sitting through all of Steve’s ranting.
and others. The snowfall outside has slowed to an occasional flurry, the winds picking up the light dusting of sparkling powder and sending it swirling along salt-covered sidewalks and roads. Behind frosted windows are dark and empty apartments, the inhabitants visiting elsewhere for the holidays, while some are warm and lively, filled with people. Parents corralling their children to get them in bed before St. Nick’s arrival, Christmas parties winding down with guests slowly trickling out and making promises to see each other next year, while some just contain three old friends sitting on the floor, playing cards, and catching up with each other.
His fingers clench tightly around the ball once it’s back in his hand. He can almost hear Steve’s voice in the back of his head.
There's still two more weeks of regular league play before Tony has to join the rest of the chosen players in Louisiana. It was decided that the host cities would alternate each year between the two leagues. The first game was hosted by an International Team based in Buffalo, and this year it had been decided that the game would take place in New Orleans.
. Playfully, he pushes Steve’s hand away and gets to his feet. “I’m fine. It’s a nice morning for a jog is all.”
“At least you can keep up with him,” she sighs playfully as Steve spins her around if only to not be faced with the suggestive smirk for too long.
“Well thank you for your time today before the game, both of you. It’ll be starting soon so we’ll let Peter get out of here, but I would like to wrap things up with you, Tony.”
Steve expects another fatalistic and dismissive comment, but Bucky flashes a confused look instead. “What are you talking about?”
These thoughts of Tony keep him up most of the night. If only this was a one-time occurrence in Steve Rogers’ life.
He lifts his gaze back to Steve, seeing the immediate regret is written all over his face. He reaches out for Tony who immediately moves out of reach, putting distance between them. “Tony, wait
Within a few seconds of Steve trying not to stare at the pink tip of Tony’s tongue as it stuck out between his teeth in concentration, there’s a little
Steve has to raise his hands up again, wishing he could physically block Tony’s words from reaching him. “Jus— Hang on— This is too much to unpack right now,” he shakes his head in irritation. “This doesn’t make any sense.”
He’s only called out by Carol once, after the very first time he does this. He’s late to practice one morning after his flight back into D.C. is delayed. Tony’s more than willing to take the hit of staying late or being banned from press junkets or whatever it is that’s outlined in all the subsections and fine print of the stupid expected behavior contract he signed.
“Hey now, where was all this shit talking at Bruce when he retired last year?” Tony points out, leaning into Steve for backup. “He wasn’t much older than I am now.”
Standing off to the side, looking out of place and a little older than Steve remembers, is Tony. It’s the version of Tony that Steve has well established as Not His but Everyone Else’s. Expression indifferent, cold, almost disdainful as he stands there staring back at him, one dark eyebrow ever so slightly raised, not in interest, but in a challenge. His honey-colored eyes aren’t shining with mischief and brilliance, his perfect lips turned into a frown rather than a smile. Everyone Else’s Tony was wearing a three-piece suit that fit him perfectly, Steve accustomed to viewing the Real Tony who wore oil-stained rock band tees, cuffed jeans, and beat up Chuck Taylors. He supposes that’s a childish view, a memory of the very early stages of their courtship being rekindled in his mind. Steve looks back at those being the fondest times, when they had each other and nothing else had been there to threaten their bond.
"Well thank you for coming," Howard says with a grin, patting Steve on the arm. He looks mostly the same as last time Steve saw him, maybe his smile lines and the grey in his hair a bit more pronounced. "I believe dinner's ready, shall we make our way into the dining room?"
The pitcher presents his middle finger, lips curving into the hint of a smile as the flash goes off. Steve watches as the film develops, plucking the square photo from the bottom of the camera once it’s finished. He gently waves it back and forth for a few seconds, helping the ink develop and dry before holding it out between them so Tony can watch it develop as well. The clarity of the image begins to sharpen, blobs of dark and light eventually shaping into the image of Tony. Steve looks down fondly at it. There’s hardly anything artistic or profound about the shot, but Tony’s personality shines through in it and Steve can’t help but smile.
Hurt flashes across Steve’s face before his expression turns guarded. He fixes a hard stare on Tony, jaw clenched tightly. “Tony. Stop.”
“But I didn’t,” Bucky wipes angrily at the tears before they can slip too far down his cheeks. “I didn’t, because I thought I couldn’t. And I didn’t want to drag you down with me, but here we are anyway,” he shakes his head bitterly, looking down at the little pile of ham cubes on his tray. “I’m not going to give you some cheesy garbage that I’m always with you in your heart or whatever, but you don’t need me to be there on the field with you to be a good ball player, you idiot. You’re doing this for both of us next week, okay? And you’re going to play amazingly, and you’re going to fucking
“But of course!” The man replies compliantly, finally releasing Tony’s hand. He wipes it off on the side of his thigh when the man turns away. “Come, come, right this way, we’ll get you to some of our best tables in the house.”
Steve is proud too. Proud of his friend. Proud of his love. Overwhelmingly proud as he’s surrounded by his triumphant teammates, confetti raining down around them in celebration of another Championship win to their name. Steve plays the entire game, his knee not aching even once. He gets choked up, crying openly as his team surrounds him, rejoicing for their Captain’s last run. Twenty-seven years of his life he’s given to pouring his heart and soul into the sport, at the expense of his own body at times. It’s the perfect end to a long and illustrious career. Almost.
“I like movies,” Steve replies, cursing inwardly when he realizes he is sounding a bit Neanderthalish. Tony strays closer to examine the titles, tilting his head at a ninety degree angle. Now that Tony is up and seemingly back to his old observant self, it’s officially the time for Steve to actually feel judged about his living space. “I haven’t bought too many recently because my VCR has been broken for a couple of months. Haven’t had the time to take it down to an electronics shop to have them fix it.”
Steve snorts. "Expect an apology from Tony Stark? I may not be some kind of chemical engineer drone-creating super genius, but I'm not
“Safe!” The ref calls, another wave of wild cheering bursting from the stadium. Tony wipes the kicked up dirt from his face as he collapses to his knees, sweat stinging his eyes. With that last push of energy, he had managed to sneak his way into a triple. He holds a weak thumbs up in Whitaker’s direction before getting to his feet, ignoring the proffered hand from the third baseman. Raising his arms above his head as he catches his breath, Tony knows he has next to no time before the next batter comes to plate.
Steve isn’t sure what to say to that. He isn’t exactly a fan of getting mixed up in the Stark family drama, but it seems like all three of them don’t know how to communicate with one another. Tony sighs loudly, slapping his hands down on the arms of the chair. The ball bounces and rolls off into a far corner as he gets to his feet. "Well, I'm not driving back to the hotel tonight, but I'm sure you can grab Gustav and have him drive you back. Or you can stay here, I don't really give a shit."
"Alright enough mush, let's go." Clint shoved his way pass the two lovebirds. He wouldn't say, but he was getting scared.
Clint was the first to speak up. "W-what are we going to do now!? Bruce is gone and that pale fucker is getting closer to us as we speak!"
Tony sighed and rubbed a hand across his forehead. "Look, I'm sorry. I'm tired and the nightmare shook me up a bit. I'll go and walk it off and then I'll come back."
Tony shook his head. "Thats just the point! We never have the time for anything! Soooooo, since halloween is coming up in a few days, I've booked us to spend a whole week in London for our vacation. We'll see all of the cool spooky attractions there, but most of all, they have this new haunted mansion there and Pepper says it's five stars."
It didn't work. All that came out was this strange static that came from the radio. Steve tried to bust down the door of the shed, but it was like the door was made out of titanium and wouldn't budge.
Coulson held Clint close, which he rarely does in public, but these were drastic times. "I've read a file on this type of situation with this 'Slenderman' before in Fury's office. The logical thing to do now, is to collect all of these pages and see if that opens the gate from where we started. Once we get out, we find Bruce and get the fuck out of Dodge."
Tony just wants to sleep. He doesn't want to wake up ever again. From the corner of his eye, he could just make out two impossibly long arms reaching out to him, beckoning him closer.
The next morning, Tony rounded up all of the Avengers via JARVIS and settled them in the living room.
- But right as he thinks that, a surprizingly gentle but freakishly long hand opens his mouth and reaches inside in order to remove something that feels like pus and cobwebs from his mouth. Tony begins to panic once more.
Vision was the next one to speak up. "Tony... that day, on the 19th, when I came back from the restaurant, you were nowhere to be found... That was approximately three months and eight days ago..." Tony was about to speak again, but then Vision gasped slightly before wincing in pain, holding a hand to the mind stone on his forehead.
"Tony? What's wrong?" She had bent down and picked him up as he barreled into her arms, sobbing. "You're so pale and cold! Shh, it's alright, mommy's got you. Tony looked up one last time and saw... nothing. Slenderman was gone.
Steve, still holding onto Tony securely, explains. "When you collapsed, Thor an I attacked while Loki went to find the others. When he did, Natasha told him that monster's weakness. His tentacles. So, Loki then wrapped all of the pages around one of his daggers and hacked them off when the others knocked him down for a moment. Afterwards, we tried to wake you up, but you wouldn't." Steve looks as if he was about to start crying again, so Tony kisses him softly.
There weren't any words on it this time, just a couple of badly drawn trees and a man standing among them.
Fury looked back up and scowled. "And what about New York? Who will protect this city?" Even though he probably knew the answer.
His tentacles were unevenly lobbed off and some were dragging on the ground, leaving a black, poisonous trail of pus and blood. His usually pristine suit was torn and ripped in several places and dirtied. His broken maw was wide open and hanging at an odd angle, leaving blood and cobwebs to ooze out and dribble down the side of his neck. His abnormally long limbs were bent at sickening angles. Slender Man was even more terrifying than ever before...
Pepper stomped her way down the hallway and started pulling Tony with her back toward the gala. "Tony! I know that you don't like to socialize, but you can only hide away for so many hours! The gala is about to end and you need to meet a few more people before it does." Pepper didn't notice Tony's sharp wince when she pulled the new bruises on his shoulders. What she did notice, however, was something on the side of his face, neck, and shoulder. She scrunched up her nose and took a handkerchief from her small purse and started to wipe at it. "Tony, what the hell? What's this icky black stuff all over you? And is that rug burn on your cheek?" Hearing that Tony flipped. He snatched the handkerchief away from her and started to furiously wipe at the blood and pus that was left. "It's some sort of machine oil right? I don't even know how you even got it in here, but come on! We need to go!" And with that, the red haired woman dragged a badly shaken genius back to the party. Before Tony could follow Pepper and duck under the rope, a breeze came and blew against his face and through his hair. Almost as if it was a hand caressing it. Tony yelped and quickly followed Pepper. Behind them, a ghostly and broken chuckle could be heard.
"That's all fine and dandy, but that still doesn't bring Bruce back." Clint grunted from under Coulson's arm.
Bruce sighs and starts to clean his glasses. "We don't know. We think that the creature branded you somehow when it...
Steve laughs and kisses Tony softly. "Yeah, Dead Beat was a good one too. And the dinosaur thing could be cool. Just don't loose control of it and have an incident like in Jurassic Park movies. God, what a mess that would be..." They all shuddered at that. (They had been bullied into a Jurassic Park marathon by Tony when he learned that everyone except for Clint hadn't seen the 'epic prehistoric movie series.')
Instead of answering, the frightening creature that shouldn't even exist, vanished with a faint beeping sound and static. Slenderman was coming...
Steve pulled Tony closer before speaking. "Well, at least we found another page." No one seemed too excited to hear the news.
Tony pouted and wiped his face as he groaned and fell back into the cushions of the couch that took up most of the livingroom. "Rhodey bein able to wak would be nish. Oh, and for this fukn brand on my tung to stop
Everyone gasped and rushed over to him, promptly enveloping him into a group hug, but then Tony flinches and shoves everyone away. The others look shocked and hurt before Rhodey takes a cautious step forward. "Tony? What's wrong? Where have you been?!"
Since no one dared to follow, silence rolled through the small clearing as the rest of the team looked at one another in disbelief.
That soon stopped when Loki snarled at them to keep their voices down. They didn't want to encourage the creature to take them faster.
Now that Tony was looking a little better, (but was still shaking a bit) Steve spoke up. "If that thing is following us, then I suggest we get a move on. No use in standing around here out in the open and risking a bad case of Deaditis."
Pepper pats Vision on the back soothingly. "Vision has been having slight pain where the stone is. He also says that-"
"Tony!" Steve shouted. He had to get to him. If anything happened to Tony- He never finished the thought as another Doombot punched him in the gut. Steve hunched over gasping. The robot was about to hit him again but an arrow suddenly lodged itself into the side of it's head, making it melt. The bot twitched one last time before it fell. Steve looked over to the top of a building a block away and saw Clint. He nodded his head in thanks and took off to the building that fell on Tony. "Tony? Tony!" Steve yelled as he searched through the debris.
Fury pinched the bridge of his nose. The universe must hate him passionately. He must have disgraced someone in a previous life or something. Not that he'd ever say that out loud. "Get a group of S.H.E.I.L.D. agents out there and search for them. This had better not be some sort of prank." Hill nodded and left the room. Maybe he was a distasteful bear or something in a past life. Killing hikers and the like...
Agent Hill stood infront of his desk. "It's the avengers sir. Stark's jet crash landed in an unknown area in London. Ms. Potts informs me that Stark's suit has been destroyed and the tracking device inside of Stark isn't acting right."
Natasha seemed to be up already and was starting to walk toward a tree were Coulson was already climbing to reach something draped over it's branches. Heh... it was Clint. Thor was sitting against a tree with an unconscious Loki in his arms trying to wake him gently. That still blew his mind a bit. What happened to him? Why was he here? He'll figure it out later. Bruce was sitting crossed legged with his fingers pressed to his temples. His skin was a little green, but it was slowly receding. Steve was just now getting up about a foot away.
"He is a myth! A bedtime story to make kids not wander off alone at night!" He should know. The only story his father had ever told him was the one about Slenderman. He got a kick out of seeing Tony run screaming whenever someone pale and in a black suit with a red tie came at him. There was even one time that he had thought that he had seen him watching one night. Tony had been coming back inside after finding his ball, when he had felt that something was watching him. He had turned around slowly. There, in the woods. Halfway behind a tree, was Slenderman. He had screamed and ran. He couldn't hear it, but he knew that it was following him. He knew that as soon as he looked behind him, he would be
Steve shakes his head. "I don't think so, we already knew that we needed eight pages, so how could they write one?"
They had been walking around for about twenty minutes when they stumbled upon what looked like a bath house. It was brick with no doors.
"You've seen it haven't you?" Loki looked at him as if in wonder. "No one had ever lived to tell the tale of the Slenderman without dieing soon after. I wonder why, why he spared you. Because that's the only option. No one escapes the Slenderman without him wanting you to." Loki shook his head and took on a distant look. "It is said that Thanos had made him, but that is not the case. He has existed far longer than even the Allfather. Thanos had only woken him up."
The figure opened it's mouth with what sounded like faint but loud whispers and bloodcurdling screaming sounding at the same time spilling from it.
"You know as much as I do, that Tony has already fixed this problem. The Fantastic Four will look after everything until we come back."
"Well, whatever this thing actually is, we have to be on our guard. If anyone dies, then you're fired." Coulson walked up, checking the rounds of his gun. There had been no ammunition whatsoever. That didn't stop him from using the gun in some other, creative ways.
Vision sighs and straightens up, opening only one eye to look at the dark-skinned man. "Affirmative."
Creating this chapter I was listening to some FNAF 4 songs. The title of the chapter came from one of them; Break My Mind by DA Games, and The Final Chapter by Typhoon Cinema. They're really good and creepy! Just look for them on Youtube!
"Ugh... take your time, take your time." Tony groaned from under a collapsed wall. He started to push it off of him, but Steve picked it up the rest of the way and flung it off to the side.
Everyone was excited about the vacation. It only took an hour to get everything packed. It was around midafternoon when they boarded one of Tony's private jets. It was a peaceful flight until something happened. Everyone was making pleasant small talk, when Loki, looking burnt and still smoking with daggers lodged in him, landed right in the middle of the jet out of nowhere.
Damn. It was almost impossible to say no to those eyes. And even though he has said no before, he relents.
Steve still looked a bit skeptical, but nodded anyway. It was too early to get into an argument. He turned around and laid back down as Tony got up and went to the bathroom. He turned on the faucet and splashed some water on his face. As he was shaking the water off of his hands, he felt a sudden throbbing on his biceps.
Vision sighs again and massages the spot around the stone as he talks to Tony. "That, I do not know. However, I do believe that whatever it is, it is coming closer."
"I know what you're thinking- No, no, no. DON'T-" Tony Stark yelled as he was blasted out of the sky by a huge Doombot. He was flung through the air and slammed into the side of a building, making it crumble ontop of him.
Tony whipped around and frantically searched the treeline behind him for the supernatural being, but he saw nothing.
Steve, Wanda, Clint, Sam, Bucky, and this guy named Scott wanted nothing to do with it, while Natasha, Vision, Rhodey, this promising kid named Peter Parker but liked to be called Spiderman, and the Prince of Wakanda, T'Challa were on Tony's side.
"Tony! Are you okay? Are you hurt?" Steve said franticly as he fluttered his hands around Tony's body.
Stark was just passing the large and twisted tree, the one they had found a page on, before freezing dead in his tracks.
He feels something cold against his lips. He seals them around the opening on faded instinct, taking a deep breath. He hears a hiss, coolness rushing into his throat and opening up the airway. He gasps and splutters on it, coughing before it’s pressed against his lips again. He can still hear Pepper, but she sounds more distant now.
He turns away to open the door, Steve grateful that he misses the visible pain on his face upon hearing that. Tony lets the door swing open but doesn’t leave, looking back to Steve expectantly as he steps aside. “After you,” Steve waves at the door.
“You retiring is a damn shame,” Sam agrees. “Even though the Knights were shitty to you, there’s plenty of other teams out there who’d be happy to have you.”
“I dunno, tripping on your way up the aisle? Remember what happened at graduation?” Bucky grins at him, making sure he’s loud enough for the others to overhear. Fucker.
, Howard. A son that, might I remind, you yourself built up to be the face of the team and possible future helm of the empire that you care so much about. So maybe you should try looking in the reflection of that finished-silver crab dish in front of you to see where he got that damn ego from in the first place.”
Steve lifts his gaze, eyes suddenly clear as they meet Peggy's unwavering stare. The rational part of Steve knows that she isn't the one to hold accountable; It's just the way of their profession. She has to make tough calls at times, and those are calls Steve has no right to blame her for. That aside, this entire conversation just reinforces the idea that they aren't players, aren't human, just assets to the guy a step above them.
Bruce strides away from Tony and Rhodey’s debate about the semantics of proper body hygiene and snatches the remote out of Strange’s outstretched hand, switching the TV back to the proper channels and turning on ESPN with a few clicks. A victorious cheer rises up from the group all piled around the single tv in the lobby, all the armchairs and couches gathered around it in a semi-circle. Tony and Rhodey sit on the edge of the coffee table, Steve deciding to perch on the arm of one of the couches.
What starts as an attempt to build a human barricade to keep the two away from each other soon descends into chaos when there are a few too many limbs attached to a few too many inebriated bodies involved. Natasha and Rhodey are combining efforts to try and drag Tony away from the brawl, Clint and Quill are caught in a scrap with Irons players who came to Hammer’s defense, and even the third-party players who are attempting to diffuse the situation start to accidentally tousle with one another in the confusion. Drinks are flying and it’s near impossible to tell whether or not it’s accidental.
He unwillingly retreats, knowing it’s not his place to supervise practices anymore. That’s Tony’s job now, and he has to trust that he knows what he’s doing.
“No Bruce?” Tony asks, looking around. He sees the familiar faces of Quill, Shade, Maximoff, and a few others on the team he’s not as close with, but there is no sign of his fellow brainiac on the team.
He can’t stop the smile of satisfaction that spreads on his face when he sees Hammer’s expression crack, his teammates not even gracious enough to hold back their snickering.
With an excellent swing on Steve’s part, he earns a double and Thor is driven home. A wave of relief washes over everyone on the Avengers’ side as they continue to strengthen the lead. 14-16. Still too close for comfort, but better than before. If they can get one more run, then Tony will take a moment to breathe again.
Steve is present in the moment, undeniably overjoyed for two of his best friends getting married, but he can’t help but let his eyes slide past them to where Tony is standing on the other side of the altar. They catch each other’s eyes more than once, sharing small and knowing smiles together. Tears are shining in Tony’s bright, honey-colored eyes, something he’ll surely blame on Barton later.
And just like that, they head back down to the garage, loop back to the Polo Grounds, Steve gets in his car and waves goodbye to Tony who barely returns it with a raise of two fingers against his steering wheel before he’s peeling out of the parking lot. Dazed and confused, Steve contemplates things in his car for a bit before turning the key in the engine and returning home.
“You dodged the question,” Steve accuses. “Why are you here? I’m assuming you didn’t come all this way to tell me something I announced publicly six months ago.”
“Do you intend to follow through?” Steve glances up. “Or do you enjoy playing games with people’s emotions?”
They arrive at the airport, check their bags, and Janet hands them their itineraries. It’s been a while since Tony’s traveled with a smaller group like this, enjoying the ease of it all. They have a couple hours layover in Kansas City, but are set to land in Vegas by early evening. Perfect, Tony has plenty of time to hit the casinos tonight.
“You don’t have to be a model, just let me take your damn picture,” Tony shifts closer, not making a grab for the camera, but just holding his hand out in request. Steve eventually relents, passing the camera to him. He can already feel the alcohol hitting his system. He isn’t a lightweight by any means, but he also doesn’t drink often enough beyond a beer or two to get that used to it. Tony had mixed in so many unfamiliar spirits and liquors that his system isn’t equipped to handle, and all it took was that one mug before he’s already feeling tipsy.
Steve leans forward, pulling out by a couple of inches as he presses his lips against Tony’s ear, bracketing his arms around him to further press him up against the wall. “You’d like that wouldn’t you? Acting out all day to get my attention just because you want rough sex?” Steve edges himself a little deeper, feeling Tony clench around him and almost making him lose his bravado. “How about we try ‘
He leans down to let Tony loosen his tie and yank it off over the top of his head, mouths messily clashing as Steve drags him into a kiss if only to slow his frantic lover. He drops his hands to Tony’s belt, slowly undoing it and dragging it out of the loops, his hand teasing along the seam of his zipper where he can feel Tony’s hardness underneath.
His right one is bandaged tightly, but he seems to be able to flex his fingers with minimal pain. The slight throbbing increases when he rotates his wrist, unable to get full mobility on it. His left hand is much worse off. It’s braced in something that’s almost a full cast but not quite, bound up in a heavy-duty brace that completely immobilizes any movement past his elbow. Either his radius or is ulna, he can’t tell which one, feels broken near the wrist, another sharp pain coming from where his thumb connects to his hand when he attempts to wiggle it in the brace. The doctor’s hands move from his chest to his hands when she sees him assessing the damage.
“Oh please, like I don’t know you and Janet give me ETAs an hour earlier than the actual time to make sure we’re not late to stuff. Now put those big muscles to use and help me carry down my bags,” Tony grabs his carry-on backpack and one of his rolling suitcases.
“How could you not tell me?” Steve asks in bewilderment, following Natasha into the stadium, the woman speed walking towards her office. Steve is covered in sweat from the rigorous practice, out of breath as he struggles to keep onto his coach’s heels. “
Realization suddenly dawns of Steve right as he hears footsteps echoing from behind him. Of course. How did he not figure it out sooner?
“Everything makes you horny,” Steve huffs in amusement, bracing himself against the wall. He finally gets a good look at the dark room— closet is a better word for it. It looks like some kind of storage room, some cabinets in the corner along with a large metal rack full of cleaning supplies against one wall. “You know there’s plenty of rooms with beds right?”
"Is that why you're always jetting off to literally anywhere else?” Tony asks from across the room, picking up some sort of glass blown decoration off an end table. “Usually to get away from Howard…”
His words echo in Tony’s mind. It was powerful and assertive. It was vulnerable and raw. It was a confession.
Steve knocks on the door as he enters, both Erskine and Bucky turning to face him. “Ah, an audience to witness my failure,” Bucky says sarcastically, sinking back into the cushioned chair he's sitting in. Steve can tell Buck is more frustrated than he’s trying to let on.
To soon, it’s time to go back out, and Tony is already itching for his turn to pitch again. Thankfully, Rezzo now takes advantage of his last Avenger, subbing Steve in. Tony can’t let himself be contained in the dugout now, the rules be damned. He waits at the edge of the doorway, entire body thrumming with anticipation.
Rhodes gets an amused look on his face like he’s seeing something Steve isn’t. “That’s where you’re wrong, Cap. You were being too soft on him. You of all people know by this point that Tony doesn’t really take to gentle persuasion— You gotta question his skill to get him riled up enough to do something about it.”
Tony downs the rest of the Bloody Mary as he slowly eases himself out of bed. He’s wearing the same clothes from last night, shirt untucked and rumpled from sleep. “So how’d we end up back here then? You fireman carry me all the way home?” Tony asks in amusement, peeking into the envelope. There’s still a hefty sum of cash stacked inside, not that Tony really cares how much he won or lost.
Oh, so not as late as he thought. “You’re up early,” he comments in amusement, grabbing a stool and pulling it closer so he can peer over Tony’s shoulder to see what he’s working on.
“This will mean a little more traveling this season, but we should be thankful for the opportunity. Not every team is participating, but we will get the chance to play against a couple of other teams for these friendlies. The PCL games will be at the end of the month, after we’ve played our regular IL games. The itinerary for the international friendlies will start with a couple of teams over on the West Coast, California and Arizona first. We’ll then fly to Texas for another match or two before coming home.”
Tony slams his locker door shut and sinks down onto a bench, jersey unbuttoned and hanging off one shoulder. Steve knows the frustration isn’t aimed at him, and it definitely seems like Tony was ready to get the confrontation off his chest. He sits down next to Tony, placing a hand on his bare shoulder. “I’m sorry to hear that. But your dad is wrong. About all of it. Especially saying you didn’t take the last game seriously. I mean, sure, we lost, but you only pitched for four innings.”
Steve reaches out and sets his hand on Maria’s knee. “Tony clearly cares about you a lot. I think he cares about you more than I’ve seen him care for anyone else. You’re a great mother, Maria.”
“Snow’s gonna melt before we get out there if you keep moving at that pace!” Tony yells from down the hallway, front door of his apartment left open. His exuberance chips away at some of the jaded edges of Steve’s thoughts, a smile on his face as he follows Tony into the elevator.
They’re all announced by name as they line up on one side of the field, all twenty-seven of them being met with a cheers from the crowd above. The Pacific League comes out after them to the same reception, Tony immediately catching Hammer’s eye. The bastard has the nerve to wink at him and spit on the ground as they line up opposite. Tony doesn’t care who sees it, there’s no way he’s shaking that fucker’s hand after all is said and done.
Steve fumbles her dinnerware again, surprised he hasn’t broken anything yet. “What’s that supposed to mean?” He asks defensively.
Tony sits with Bruce on the bus ride home, again denying Steve the opportunity to get some one-on-one time with him. He sits with the newest addition to their team instead— T’Challa, who they formerly played alongside in the All-Star game. He’s an excellent first baseman and Steve can already see the incredible potential he has to make a great Captain if he ever desired the position, despite being so new to the team. Retirement is never on the forefront of Steve’s mind, but he’s getting up there in terms of age— almost
“Defusing the bomb is a bit of a poor analogy,” she points out with a sigh. “At this point, the bomb has exploded, the building has collapsed, and we need to drag you out of the rubble. But Coulson is right, we can better help you if we know who he is and if we know whether or not we need to pay him off to keep him quiet or help him not be discovered.”
“He’s probably used to things being made about Tony,” Howard sighed, dragging a finger along the rim of his glass.
The Knights won the 1996 World Series. Not giving the monumental victory a moment to breathe, Tony happily tore the attention back to himself and announced he would be leaving the ranks of Major League Baseball and taking over his company. On top of that, he revealed in a tell-all ESPN interview the rampant misuse of performance-enhancing drugs in the Majors, stating that the drug abuse is what drove him away, not his sustained injuries. This opened the floodgates for multiple investigations to weed out the steroid problem across the big leagues that is still ongoing. It left more holes than expected, giving plenty of opportunities for talented and honest Minor League players to have their chance.
He manages to get a clean sweep of the table aside from the two of them, Tony brushing Clint off with a thinly-veiled “Steve’s knee can’t handle it.” Before he gives up, dragging the rest of the men onto the dance floor while Hank sneaks away to reunite with his wife.
Steve shrugs. “You told me you never got the real experience of being a kid. No fun birthday parties with all your friends, never been in an arcade, or gone bowling. I figured it’s better late than never.” He jerks his chin over to the secondary food area by the bowling lanes, nachos, popcorn, and other candy options galore. “And they have beer here.”
"Hey, I'm not saying I'm on his side with how he goes about it, but you can't discredit—" The TV suddenly goes black. Steve turns to see Bucky standing behind him with the remote.
Hammer does it again, a second curveball that is slower than the first, but still dips out of reach.
Carol sets a pattern for Tony that wavers slightly depending on their opponent and if they’re playing one or two games that day, but is still predictable enough. She’ll play him for an entire game, all nine or more innings, and then let him have the next day off to sit on the bench and check in with the PTs. He also takes those days as an opportunity to sneak in a quick hour-and-a-half flight to New York for the day just to visit with Steve in secret.
His bat completes its path with no resistance. Steve stumbles a bit, not expecting to miss. He turns his head in surprise, Natasha rising up from her crouch to return the ball to Tony.
“No, but she’ll be back in the morning. We’ve both been sleeping here the past few days, but we convinced each other to take turns so we can get an okay night’s sleep every once in a while,” he explains, pulling a chair back up so he can sit next to Tony, holding his bandaged hand. “How are you feeling? Do you need more pain medication? The doctors have been saying at this point you’re just in recovery, but I want to make sure you’re not in any pain. I can go get a nurse—”
Yankee Stadium is swarmed by the time Steve arrives, both with fans tailgating in the parking lot before the start of the game, as well as media conducting interviews with fans and players alike. He debates putting on the jersey for his walk through the parking lot, trying to decide whether it would help him blend in or just stand out
Howard sits at the head of the table, with Maria on his left side. Tony has chosen the place setting as far away from Howard as possible, leaving Steve to sit in between the two. He takes a seat as their server first fills their glasses with water, then pours wine for everyone except Howard, who is given the entire bottle of brandy and a snifter. Steve also doesn’t miss when Tony signals for the man to tip the wine bottle a little more until his wine glass is significantly full. Neither Maria nor Howard make a comment.
Dinner with a family on a farm actually does sound pretty inviting. For as long as he can remember, he and Buck spent every Christmas together even after their families had long since passed. They normally spent it just the two of them holed up at Bucky’s place for the day, but maybe it would be nice for a change of pace. “He actually isn’t far from Kingston either. I think we’d love to come if Clint’s family doesn’t mind.”
“One of our top stories this morning is the news that Tony Stark, the 28 year-old CEO of Stark Industries, has officially stepped down from the company, relinquishing all hold on the now multi-million dollar corporation. In the fall of ‘96, Stark had regained control of his family’s company after ending his career in Major League Baseball. In that short amount of time, he diversified the company’s interests beyond far more than making sports gear. Stark began investing in new branches supporting STEM research and design, becoming an immediate source for innovation in technology and clean energy sources. While there is no official ruling on who will be taking the helm of Stark Industries, it is rumored for COO, Virginia Potts to be promoted to President and CEO. Relatively unknown designer Riri Williams has been announced to be taking Stark’s secondary title of Executive Chief of Design, Stark himself announcing in his statement that he will still be a “consultant” for the company. This comes as a shock, especially with the opening of a bureau right here in New York being established a few short months ago—”
Steve shrugs one shoulder, fingers flicking nervously at the corner of the worn out book. “Yeah, but yours looks a lot nicer than mine.”
He narrowly avoids the pillow that Steve chucks at his head. “I was only three when this came out, so shut it. Besides, everyone should see
Steve continues to bet modestly, but is doing rather well for himself. Tony can’t help but fidget in agitation every time he can figure out that Steve knows when he’s going to win a hand, but doesn’t raise or even call.
“Well it sure sounds like it! And it sounds like you’re just trying to get me to take the deal so you have an easy ticket out of this relationship!”
Tony almost jumps back out of his seat in the fear that he’s about to be assaulted, until the man raises his dropped chin to look at him properly. Tony stares at his face for a second, trying to work out why he looks familiar. And then it hits him— “You’re Bucky,” he utters in realization, recognizing him from a few photos around Steve’s apartment. “Steve’s Bucky.”
The reporter nods. "Your comments at your father's last press conference have ruffled many people's feathers. To quote you— If I may?"
for him. He hates the feeling of just being a passive party in this, but also doesn’t want to make a fool of himself. Tony insists time after time “I’m fine” and “Let’s focus on you”, always bringing Steve to completion without even touching himself.
"Thank you," Steve replies with a blush. Over the past three years of playing underneath Peggy’s watchful eye, the two have grown close. They regularly get drinks and meals together or stay in the stadium long after practice has ended just to chat, to the point of teasing from almost everyone on the team. Bucky is probably the only one who doesn’t tease Steve about his relationship with their manager because he knows Steve better than that.
. “And you’re one to talk after being put in the corner for a whole year after the tantrum you threw.”
Tony stands up and walks towards Steve, scooping up a razor thin letter opener from Natasha’s desk. For a fleeting moment, he wonders if Tony is going to try and stab him, or worse, kiss him, but he just gestures for Steve to step aside. Steve moves away from the door, watching Tony get to his knees and start picking the lock with the letter opener.
It's far from fun to be holed up in the doctor’s office for a couple hours every week, but at least Steve always offers to come along with him. Tony knows about his old teammate Bucky— the one who suffered the really bad UCL tear— and how dedicated Steve was to seeing his recovery. All that guilt on his conscious is most likely what has him tagging along, trying to prevent Tony from falling to the same hubris.
Things changed after Buck's injury, whether the two of them liked it or not. The stress and pressure of being in the limelight didn’t help the UCL tear, so Bucky moved upstate. It's not like Steve could be mad or even betrayed by his best friend's decision. It was for the best, and being out of the public eye is what he needed. They still visit each other a few times a month when they can, and Bucky is always invited to attend Steve’s games, though there are times when the retired player can’t bring himself to step back into the stadium, even just to watch. Steve doesn’t blame him for that either.
“Eh, somewhat. It’s usually off by up to three games overall, but it’s not a bad way to evaluate the offensive and defensive aspects of a team… There’s always room for deviation because of luck and chance though, which can make predicting a team’s future win-loss ratio difficult…” Tony might have more to say about it, but is cut off by the yawn that forces its way out of his mouth.
He remembers the game at this point last year, how they all were practically begging for a mercy killing to end it. It had been a truly soul crushing defeat for his team, the final scoreboard reading Irons: 15 - Avengers: 3. Its marked in the books as the biggest gap in points in the history of the single-game Championship event. It’s a David vs Goliath story that, last year, didn’t end well for David.
Steve's swing is near perfect, and he sends the ball flying right over Tony's head into the outfield, right towards the empty spot with no coverage. So he knows what he’s doing with a bat. Before he can stop himself, Tony takes off at a full sprint, the center fielder making a run for the ball as well.
“You know, I’m getting kind of sick of all the secrets here, Nat,” Steve can’t help but snap at her in irritation, emotions still all mixed up with Tony’s abrupt appearance. “Seriously, why do you bother to tell me anything anymore?”
It’s quiet for a few moments as they walk, a sadness creeping in and hanging over the pair. “Maybe you’ll be okay in a couple seasons,” Steve eventually says, ignoring the quiet sigh he hears from beside him. “I’m serious. I mean, maybe you’ll recover before our contracts are even up and you won’t even have to worry about trying to get resigned.”
“I was going to go for biochemistry and engineering, but then things sort of took off with my pitching,” he admits, rubbing the back of his neck.
Tony sighs deeply through his nose, squeezing his eyes shut tighter as if he can wish hard enough and this conversation will stop coming up. “No, Steve,” he mutters tiredly. “I told you this discussion was closed.”
Peggy last week that I’m clear to play!” Bucky is almost laughing at this point, throwing Steve an amused look as he comes to stand next to him, tossing his own duffel bag into his locker. “Go on, tell him, Steve.”
Bucky imparts a very encouraging “Don’t fuck this up” on Tony before kicking him out of the truck. He feels almost completely sober at this point as he ascends up the stairs to Steve’s apartment. He lets himself in as quietly as possible, slowly easing the sliding door shut and locking the latch behind him.
“Come on, lazy bones, get dressed,” Tony tosses a heap of winter clothes towards his face, already completely outfitted in snow pants and snow jacket himself, a woolen hat pulled down over his ears with the ends of his hair flipping out from beneath it.  He hurries out of the room, Steve listening to the sound of water-proofed nylon rubbing against itself fade into the distance.
going to cut it. Now, most of my clothes are custom made or tailored, so they’re not going to fit you, but surely you brought something else,” he goes over to Steve's closet and dresser drawers, immediately combing through his very limited options. The best thing he finds is a simple, pressed white dress shirt and a hideous brown sports jacket.
As far as the Knights go, they seem to fall on one side or the other. Pierce has made his disapproval known, but Carol called a team meeting the day after the press conference that any mistreatment of Tony because of his sexual orientation would result in immediate play suspension. He feels a bit like the teacher’s pet because of it, but it does deter any players who already disliked him to not take their hate any further. Most of his teammates actually do offer words of solidarity, a few “my uncle/cousin/friend-of-a-friend is gay”s and other attempts to connect to him. Sam makes it clear to him that if anyone gives him a hard time about it to let him know, and Tiberius’ attitude doesn’t change in the slightest. After a few weeks, it became a non-topic as far as his team was concerned. Carol continues to put him in games despite all the calls for him to be dropped from the team, and he continues to be one of the brightest shining stars of the MLB. The satisfaction in knowing that he’s proving the world wrong two-folded is enough to keep him going.
“I’ll regretfully have to pass. Jane is in Arizona for a research project and is flying in tonight to visit,” Thor answers, getting that doe-eyed look in his eyes that makes bile rise up in Tony’s throat.
Howard’s team today, and I know we’re going to absolutely crush them. You always told me to have a backbone and will made of iron, so here I am. Hopefully the Irons’ loss today will have you rolling in your grave, and that will be enough for me.”
As the game starts, he does feel a pang of sadness seeing someone else on that pitcher's mound. Harrington is the second best choice on the all-star team, and he proves that in the first inning. His ace pitching combined with the Pacific Coast team's impressive outfielders ensures no runs for the International League. Tony barely gets any handling on the ball, and was itching for some action. Unfortunately for him, he's low on the batting rotation because of his position as shortstop. When it's their team's turn to take to the plate, they manage to get one run before three outs are called. There's still two more players ahead of Tony for the batting rotation, so he'll have to wait until the next inning before he has the chance to swing.
Tony glares for a moment, but Steve can see a hint of contemplation in the squint of his eyes before the kid turns away, retreating once again. “Yeah, well… Some of us refuse to follow the path other people pave for us.”
Steve can’t fault her for that. Since Tony showed back up, his performance hasn’t been great. It hasn’t been
Steve shrugs, crunching on perfectly crisped bacon. “Suit yourself. I’ll see you later.” He inhales a few more bites of food before pulling his shirt on and heading out the door, leaving Tony to his own conflicted thoughts.
The TV is muted again as the feed cuts to a different reporter on the field, the players warming up in the background. Steve hands his little red-headed godson back to Natasha as the group slowly migrates outside to take their seats as the game draws near. Everyone cheers and waves to Peter when he finally makes it onto the field, his face lighting up immediately. Their box has one of the best views (as to be expected when it belonged to the home team’s star pitcher), and Peter easily spots them and waves back in excitement before the coach barks for him to get a few practice pitches in.
Steve can't imagine how Tony’s dealing with all of this. His closely guarded secret is now known by someone he isn't exactly a fan of. He has no one to reach out to. Even in Steve's most isolated moments, he always had Bucky that he could rely on. He thinks back to how he was treated by Hammer in the big confrontation after the All-Star Game, and the way even some of the other players had looked at him in disgust at the insinuations his former-teammate had made. Tony has exactly zero support in all of this.
Bittersweetness closes up his throat as they sneak out of the back exit of the hotel and walk the couple of blocks down the street to where Steve had parked. They’re on an empty, dilapidated street, Tony holding Steve’s hand openly because he knows he’ll have to let go at any moment. He still clings to him as they make it to the car, Steve laughing and gently trying to pry Tony’s hands off the soft material of his hoodie.
"Let’s hear it," Tony spears another mini sausage on the end of his fork. "Fancy car, flat screen TV, penthouse in Beverly Hills, fancy vacation to Santorini, the world is yours."
“There,” Tony grabs a hand towel to wipe off the remainder of the substance. He walks back over to Steve and reaches up to undo two more buttons. He then grabs the cuffs of the shirt and unbuttons those as well, rolling them up to expose Steve’s toned forearms. He follows the natural line of Steve’s body, grabbing him by the belt next.
They duck behind their snow forts and immediately start readying up ammo, Steve counting down before each side starts sending off their barrage of snowballs. Tony is unsurprisingly accurate and fast with his throws, purposefully ignoring any of the minors as targets and only aiming for Steve’s face. They clearly have a better defense with the ridiculous fortress Tony had managed to scrape together in ten minutes, so there’s only one logical thing to do: go on the offense.
They’re going to be able to go through the reconstructive surgery, using some ligaments from Bucky’s leg. A lot of the muscle tissue in Bucky’s elbow is still extremely damaged, and because of the extent of the injury, it’s still uncertain if he’ll ever be able to play baseball properly ever again. It will be at least two years of physical therapy to even regain basic motor functions.
want to go back and prove everyone wrong again. The Knights stole your chance to get a World Series title that everyone knows you were capable of earning. You
The words don’t register in his head for a moment. He blinks, feeling a pat on the back from Los Angeles’ Noah Denver as he hops off the bench and jogs out into the shortstop position. Tony comes out of the dugout, his glove still clenched tightly in one hand. “What do you mean, Whitaker? We had a deal!”
Peggy's voice isn't completely unsympathetic, but it all sounds so disengaged to Steve's ears in that moment. It
Whitaker puts a huge hand on the top of his hat, giving Tony’s head a forceful push towards the bench. “Better rest up while you can.”
“Thanks, uh, Buddy,” Tony lets Steve wheel him in, clambering out of the stupid wheelchair as soon as the door shuts behind them. He stares woefully at the mini fridge in the room, surely stocked with tiny liquor bottles that he’d happily down one after another until they were all empty in any other circumstance.
Tony scoffs, wiping some nonexistent dirt off his nose. “I pitch circles around everyone’s batting lineup,” he counters, bumping his shoulder into Steve’s before grabbing his glove. He jumps to his feet and starts stretching his arms out in front of him as he heads out onto the field, but Steve can still see the line creasing between his brows.
Janet’s hand flies up to massage her temple, squeezing her eyes shut. “It’s not about that, Tony. We’ve been working so hard to clean up your image and now you go and do this. It’s not going to matter whatever Hammer said to you because
When the moment ends and the whistle blows for the game to start, the rest of their team realizes the new arrival as well. Most of them hesitate the same way Steve had, unsure of how to behave when he showed up out of the blue like this. Rhodes comes down the line immediately, throwing his arms around Tony in a tight hug. Steve watches as one of the camera operators notices Tony’s unexpected arrival as well, the big screen immediately shifting to the live feed of Rhodes and Tony locked in embrace, Tony’s face schooled into a mask of indifference.
Evidently, he’s been doing something right. He and Thor are the popular picks from the Avengers this year, with Steve being tacked on by the IL Board’s vote. The year when Tony had still been playing for the PCL, Steve was the only player chosen to represent the Avengers. Last year, no one had been called up. Tony thinks that Steve probably would’ve had another shot at it had he actually played more, but the previous season was more of a resting period for the thirty-four year-old Captain. The Avengers have always been a well-regarded team, but haven’t always resonated with the fanbase. Half of the interest with the Triple-As were how often rosters fluctuated, constantly rotating players in and out, new faces every season. The Avengers had sort of fallen at a stalemate in the last couple of seasons, but they’ve started a slow crescendo again thanks to Steve at the helm and having a handful of newbies from the Double-As on their team this season. (Tony also likes to think he’s piqued people’s interest since joining.)
“What?” Steve blurts on instinct, hearing the familiar phrase out of an unfamiliar mouth. He’s still a little disoriented, not used to actually getting any sleep during travel.
They’re fairly evenly tied when it comes to batting and baserunning stats. Tony’s average home runs per game and per season is lower than Steve’s, but the kid’s got him beat in grand slams (home runs with loaded bases). Tony’s apparently a monster when it comes to stealing bases, with a huge margin between that and how often he’s been tagged out during a SB attempt, resulting in a high success rate. Steve is pleased to see he’s at least far ahead of Tony in his inside-the-park home runs, on-base percentage, and slugging average.
Tony squeezes his hand the best he can with his awkward limbs, urging him to stop when he starts to get to his feet again. “No, m’fine, just— Just lay with me?” Even after all the sleeping he’s been doing—did Steve say days?—he’s feeling tired and light-headed again.
Tony helps get another out, and then the International team gets a home run, followed by their third out. Tony's itching to step up to bat, squinting through the sun to try and spot which position Steve is at. His blonde hair is free of any baseball cap, making him easy to pick out. First baseman. Not really a threat, especially if Tony's batting right-handed.
Bucky throws his head back in laughter. "If she does I'm in trouble," he glances over to their teammate who’s still immersed in a game of quarters on the opposite end of the bar. "I'm gonna get out while he's still distracted."
"Who else are we taking from the Irons?" Tony asks as he combs back his tufts of hair that refuse to behave even on the best days.
“I don’t know,” Steve eventually sighs, draining the last of his beer. Tomorrow morning the Avengers are all piling on a plane and flying all the way to Bakersfield, California to begin their International exhibition games. The teams they’ll be playing against were finalized only last week, and everyone had been disappointed they didn’t have a game against the Irons. Steve sincerely doubts it’s for any reason other than wanting to see Tony’s reaction. “I think I just don’t know how to
He sighs and throws the blankets off himself, picking through all the items of clothing Tony threw at him. They fit surprisingly well, Steve wondering if these are all just oversized clothes Tony never got altered properly. He dresses slowly, lingering in Tony’s space as he passes through the apartment, wondering if he’ll ever get to experience anything like this ever again.
“I don’t know how you’ve gone almost forty years without that realization, but it’s not really news to the rest of us that life isn’t
“Yes,” he answers almost immediately, having to clear his throat. “God, yes. Sorry— I haven’t— I just mean that I never—”
Tony jumps off the bench when Steve’s thumb brushing against the top of his spine makes all the hairs on the nape of his neck stand up, ignoring the shock that went through him from the touch. He’s too keyed up right now to pay any mind to a touch that’s meant to be soothing that only puts him further on edge. “I’m not putting faith in
Steve is already flying out the door as she speaks, practically jumping from one flight of stairs to the other without even bothering with the steps themselves, his knee crying out in protest. “Is he okay? What happened?”
He almost has half a mind to feel self-conscious as he lets the other man into his apartment, knowing it isn't near anything up to Tony’s standards as far as size and luxury went. The billionaire doesn't seem to care, drifting out of Steve’s hold as soon as there's a couch in sight. He collapses face down onto the big, ugly, brown thing, a content sigh leaving him. Steve goes to the kitchen to pour a tall glass of water, and upon returning to the living room finds Tony snoring softly with one leg already hanging off the edge of the couch. Steve sets the glass down as quietly as possible on the coffee table and grabs an afghan off the back of the couch to drape it over his sleeping form.
They don’t have long to stay and chat, needing to get down to their designated locker room to get changed and warm up as fans start entering the stadium. “Make us proud, boys!” Natasha calls out the door to them, a raucous cheer coming from the room as they head out of it. Tony turns left with Thor to head back down the stairs, but Steve starts in the opposite direction.
The snow is falling in large flakes, drifting lazily down to stick to any available surface. A couple of inches have built up in the parking lot since the snow plows came through that morning, the white surface crunching lightly beneath Steve’s boots as he gets out of his old beater car. One of these days he’ll fix it up. Maybe next Summer if he ever remembers to take it out of the garage.
She laughs and gently pries Tony off of her, settling herself against his side with an arm around his waist to best avoid his flailing arms. “I’m happy to see you too. You were amazing out there today.”
Steve loves these moments with Bucky—staying after their games with the other neighborhood kids just to toss the ball around was almost more fun than playing the actual match.
None of the pictures are able to capture Steve’s identity. He’s mostly got his back to the camera in the shots, face shrouded by his outerwear or Tony’s face blocking it as they kiss. And to think Tony always made fun of Steve’s idea of a “disguise” when going out, Tony not doing the same because he hadn’t expected to see anyone when walking Steve to his car, or do such an impulsive thing.
Janet gets their keys from the receptionist, holding out one of the small envelopes between Tony and Steve. “You two will be rooming together. Thor, you’re down the hall staying with T’Challa Ukatana. I believe it’s his first season playing in the Triple-A, so make him feel welcome, yeah?”
The movie actually isn’t half-bad. It’s enough to keep Tony’s full attention, evening plans all but forgotten as he watches the Roman tragedy unfold in front of him. His exhaustion from staying out so late the evening before catches up to him unexpectedly right as Spartacus and Antoninus begin their fight to the death, his eyelids beginning to droop. Tony does his best to stay awake, fighting his own battle against sleep, but ends up following the lead of his on-screen namesake and succumbs to his opponent.
“He was,” Obadiah answered simply, drawing himself up to his full, proud height. “He had to pull out last minute for a family emergency, so the board elected me to step in and fill his place.”
A deep sigh escapes Tony as his chin tips back down towards the ground. "That's what I was worried about." His eyes meet Steve's—god, is he pouting? "Dinner's this Saturday, after the first game. The house is in Malibu, so it's a bit of a drive, but—" Tony lets out another exaggerated sigh, his teeth grinding together as he gets the next part out. "We'd love to have your company."
