"You can see my dilemma, right?"  He asks more seriously.  "I am not father material, John.  You can be certain I am going to mess it up, badly.  And then what will you do, caring for a proper baby and a thirty-seven-year-old one? All this... it feels like I'm putting an incredibly heavy burden on your shoulders.  You will hate me in the end, and our child will probably as well."
"Mycroft!  I was about to call the Yard.  Where have you been?"  He practically yells into the phone.
Moriarty is scared.  For the first time since he had kidnapped John on his way to pick up a medical file at Sarah’s, the crazy bastard is scared.  He knows Sherlock can shoot any second.  Not even his hidden gunmen can kill him fast enough to prevent it.  Moriarty’s face crumple; he suddenly looks like a whiny, ugly little kid about to wet his trousers.  John represses a nervous laugh bubbling in his throat.  He wishes Sherlock would just shoot his gun and get it over with.
"Alright.  Good.  Now listen to me.  I want you to try and follow my breathing rhythm, okay?  There, feel it.  I know you can do it, come on."
John doesn't know what gets to him so much, but it almost hurts, hearing Sherlock speaking about his belly expanding -and he might have a brand new kink, as fascinated as he is by the rounded treasure expanding under Sherlock's navel.  Maybe it is the thought of being responsible for it, for all the changes his lover is going through and will go through; maybe it's because soon, yes, Sherlock won't be able to conceal his pregnancy anymore, and it will be there for everyone to see, how Sherlock belongs to him, and carries his child.
Because let’s be serious, how could Sherlock Holmes, so beautiful and graceful, the man with the incredible mind, the incomparable genius... how could he be interested in John? Short, soft around the edges John Watson, with his round nose and funny ears.  John had always felt confident when flirting with women because he knows there is much more than physical appearance alone when it comes to the opposite sex.  His wit has won him more conquests than his soldier’s broken body, that is for sure.  With men, though, and most especially with Sherlock, John is self-conscious to the point of losing any bit of confidence he ever had.  He can’t let himself think he could be attractive to Sherlock.  As John's mother used to say,
John frowns at him, then turns on the radio, changing channels until he finds one playing Christmas music.
Bloody Sherlock and his sense of drama.  John comes close to hitting one of his precious "ears around the city" who keeps silent and smiling two inches away from his face, if only to relieve some stress. He doesn't.  He figures it would be awkward, when he tries to reconcile with his lover, to admit he has lost a spy because of John's temper.
...Only to meet with Sherlock's back at full speed.  John tries to stop -can almost hear the break noise like in cartoons- and throws himself to the side, his shoulder bumping hard against an empty container.  At least, Sherlock is still standing, although he's wincing, hopping on a leg to get to John.
Sherlock shivers and lowers his head, rubbing his nose into the crook of John's neck, before settling there, his face turned toward John, his lips resting on the sensitive skin right under his jaw.  Sighing, John wraps an arm around his back, letting his hand rest, firm and solid, on the middle of his spine.  Grounding him.  And loving him, fuck, loving him so damn much.
Sherlock gives him a furious look.  "Do not treat me like some fragile flower.  I do not have the faintest idea if what I have done tonight is the right thing to do.  In these... morally ambiguous cases, I make a point of detaching myself from the aftermath, because it is not MY FAULT if people do stupid things, sometimes!"
He finishes undressing himself and settles on the bed with a bottle of lube that seems to have materialised in his hands.  Looking as John undresses slowly, Sherlock blushes and closes his eyes.
"Because you think it's okay to do things like that!   Because, you arrogant dickhead, the universe doesn't revolve around you and life just goes fucking on, even when you're bored.  I'm sick and tired of dealing with your temper tantrums.  I didn't throw away your experiment to get back at you, I threw it away because we had a deal and you didn't hold your part.  But you, you destroyed my jumper to get back at me. Must have thought about it all night, huh?  How to get revenge on John for what he did.  Your brilliant mind suggesting multiple scenarios of what to do to upset me just right.  You know what?  Your bloody intelligence doesn't make you a better person because, when we're down to it, you can be as petty as the rest of us."
Sherlock stares at him, his eyes a little too bright.  "John. You are always so kind to me, why do you let me get away with so many things? You asked a valid question. You deserve an answer."
"No, we cannot work with suppositions, Geoffrey, we need facts," Sherlock shouts at his mobile while his fingers never stop typing.
Lestrade gives him a surprised look and leaves them both, walking toward the gathering of cops and experts.
Sherlock shivers, then lets out a tired laugh.  “Some are lucky enough to expel the baby in three or four pushes.  Of course, it isn’t my case.  It would have been too simple.”
Sherlock and John return to London on March 18.  John still has two weeks ahead of him before he can go back to work, and wouldn’t have minded staying longer, but Sherlock has a medical appointment that week.  They could have driven to London in the morning and be back in Sussex late in the afternoon –it is, after all, only a two-hour trip, but a text message from Mycroft discouraged them.  He asked for Sherlock’s help with a case and it is evident, given the way he explains it to John in a nervous, manic voice, that he really wants to take it.  John is relieved to see his detective of a fiancé showing his usual enthusiasm and is prompt to suggest they start packing.  He’s been worried, after Sherlock’s confession, that the more he waited to get back on track, the more difficult it would be.
"Well I know of at least one goldfish that would very much like to kick his superior ass," John grumbles.
Angie has withdrawn her hand and is now babbling full-speed.  What is Sherlock's name, is he a friend of her daddy, and is John his boyfriend because she knows boys can be boyfriends and oh, does he want to visit her room?  It's a quite pretty room.
Sherlock being Sherlock, he doesn't do anything by normal standards. Too long minutes pass and he doesn't show any sign of stopping. At one point, John beings to worry he might not be
Sherlock takes the stairs two by two while John is dragging himself. The flat is cold and dark, almost... unwelcoming.  John feels a bit sorry for himself.  While Sherlock monopolises the bathroom to take a shower, he lights up a fire and sits in his chair, waiting for the flames to warm him up, so that at least he feels a little less miserable.  He might have dosed off, but not for long.  He shakes himself awake when Sherlock reappears in the sitting room, and John, surprised, notices the fresh clothes he's changed into -no dressing gown and old pyjamas, but one of his clean and crisp dark suits.
John knows Sherlock won't sleep if he's not close.  He always falls asleep easier when they are cuddling.  He's so tactile.
"Yeah, that's what I meant. My god, we aren't ready.  I mean, Sherlock, have you ever held a baby in your arms?
ly," Sherlock murmurs, right on point, as always.  If he knew, though, that his lisp comes back when he talks while sleeping, John has no doubt he would find a way to discipline himself even when unconscious.
“You know it is normal, right?  I mean, sort of, being tired and slow, and uncomfortable, when one reaches a pregnancy’s full term.”
“You can go home, you know,” John says, feeling the need to sleep overtaking him.  “Get some rest.  You haven’t slept much in the past few days.”
And John discovers that being in doctor mode doesn't help at all when it's someone you love.  When it's your baby. He calls Lestrade, and his voice, unsurprisingly, sounds just as hurt, and scared, as Sherlock's.
"No," Sherlock cuts him off.  "You needn't apologise.  I am well aware of the damage I have done in the past.  You have been carrying the weight of being not only my brother but my keeper for way too long."
He takes John's hand, and John makes a tremendous effort to relax.  He hadn't even noticed he had become angry.  Funny, how Sherlock is the one always insisting he doesn't
"That's it," he says nevertheless, focussing entirely on Sherlock.  "There's a good lad.  Keep going love."
Another few seconds, then Sherlock releases the pressure on John’s hand and blinks at him, as if he’s just woken up.  “I can do this,” he says, trying to smile.  “I trust you, John.  We can do this together, right?  It’s just like it’s always been.  You and me against the world.”
"John, will you call a cab, we are done here," Sherlock turns toward him, and John, who is still confused by how fishy this whole conversation has been, jumps in surprise.
“My fiancé is about to give birth!” John yells back, using his hands to carry his voice.  “We need to get to the hospital.”
New tears appear at the corner of Sherlock’s closed eyes.  He shivers, and allows a silent sob to escape.  It’s not good enough.  He needs to breathe.  John orders him, hating himself for being so commanding.
The discussion planned for the second hour of the class starts slowly, awkwardly, with the nurse needing to ask a question specifically to one participant if she wants an answer.  It is not long, though, before it becomes animated, everyone giving their opinion of the various methods to relieve pain, and sharing personal stories of a step-sister who used laughing gas and became covered in red blisters (allergic reaction, probably), or that article in the journal from five years ago about the dangers of hypnotism (there aren't any). Sherlock does not participate, but he seems to really listen.  John tries to be the spokesperson of their couple, whenever Marcie throws a question in their direction.  Of course, after a while, the subject shifts slightly, going from generalities to more personal experiences, as if ten minutes of speaking to each other has made all of them close friends.  A delicate blond with the voice of a mouse reveals that she had witnessed the birth of her brother when she was five.  Her parents thought it would be a great experience for her but on the contrary, she remained terrified years after the fact, remembering he mother's shrilling cries and what she describes as a gush of blood spatter from her vagina "like in horror movies."  Today, she's still terribly afraid of being in pain and reliving what her mother went through, adding with a nervous snort that she would very much like to be asleep for the whole process.
"What about... tea?  Isn't the caffeine contained in it severely restricted for a pregnant person's consumption?"
"Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Whatever.  But I meant what I said.  I had no good reason to be upset.  You don't have to indulge me, you really can go back to your case."
"I know what it means," John cuts him off, with more impatience that he intended.  Sherlock huffs at him.
"John," he murmurs between short intakes of breath, "demisexual... It huh... means I need to feel a deep, affective connection, to be physically attracted to someone... And you... oh god, god, John..."
Sherlock stares down at his shirt and seems surprised by the brownish stain.  "Oh. I am sorry John, it must be quite disturbing for you."
Sherlock stands up with all the dignity he is capable of and lays down the doll's body on the table, delicately, making sure its resting on its little cot.
That last sentence proves too much for John.  A savage laugh bubbles in his throat, and gets out like a bark, making Sherlock jump in surprise.  He stares severely at John, trying to intimidate him to silence, but damn it if John can control himself.  He's laughing so hard tears are already streaming down his cheeks.
Tonight, John had needed for their roles to be reversed. And Sherlock had steppedup.  He's been solid and reassuring, he's been the protector, the care taker.  He's been perfect. Of course.  He is strong.  Stronger than he thinks.
"I am saying...  What I am saying is, it would be a legal advantage to be married as we are to become a family," Sherlock hesitates, then just seems to crumble in on himself, shoulders slacking, fingers of both hands fidgeting, and John takes pity.
“Tell me help is coming,” John asks, moving a hand to caress Sherlock’s head.  His curls are damp with sweat.
"You're an idiot," Sherlock states.  "You must have realized by now how uncomfortable and ignorant I am regarding sex.  How would it have fit into a conversation?
"I never thought it could feel so good, how is it feeling so good," he pants, shoving his head in the crook of John's neck, sucking at the skin there.  "I am obviously demisexual."
"Angie was there," he says, after shutting the window of the glass panel.  "That... set up, it wasn't Beeks trying to mimic a crazy killer."
"It's ok," Sherlock whispers, his eyes taking on that particular pale, static appearance, which happens each time he immerses himself in complicated, intertwined thought patterns.
Sherlock blinks.  And blinks again, and again.  Mycroft is observing him with a little smile, his eyes busy deducing his reaction.
"So that is the result when I do thank you, being laughed at," he pouts, trying to push John away. At the same time, though, he cannot hide the smile quirking up his lips.  John keeps a firm hold around his waist and kisses him again.
John feels a fond smile stretching his lips.  He has never loved Sherlock more than in this moment, ordering him around like he does on a case, so bloody sufficient and confident he thinks he can stop death.  This, John can give that much to him.
In the cab, Sherlock cannot stop talking.  It is nervousness still, but the good kind.  Even if he is freed from his bed rest, he needs to be careful, and Amy has been very specific regarding what he can and cannot do.  She's used to Sherlock by now and knows how reassuring detailed facts are for him.
"I am going to come soon," Sherlock whines, turning his head to the side.  "John, please, stop, I want it to last. Make it last."
"Woah, there, Sherlock," Lestrade says, standing between him and the suspect.  "I think he's had it, alright?"
Mrs. Hudson waits for them in the lobby, the door already opened, waving at them with enthusiasm. To be honest, John is as excited as her.  For once, he's the one out of the cab as soon as it comes to a halt, leaving Sherlock behind to pay the fare.
Five days after Sherlock felt the baby move, the first real warm day of spring arrives.  The sun is pleasant, the air filled with chlorophyll and the sugary sweet rotting draft from last autumn.  John is at the point where he has to restrict himself from moving too much.  The only pain left is a slight discomfort at the site of his cut, and soreness at the end of the day.  The swelling is practically non-existent.  He knows it is especially during this part of his convalescence that he needs to be careful, because the wound, underneath the surface, still has some healing to do.  He occupies himself that morning with a much needed catch up with the laundry -Sherlock has made some surprising efforts, but it remains that he tends to forget the most basic things, those boring, tedious tasks -like, say, eating- when he could do so much more even remaining immobile, just thinking.
"About time you showed up, Mycroft was freezing down there," Sherlock says.  There is the usual arrogance in his voice, but it's toned down, and Sherlock's voice is higher than usual, higher and breaking.
John might have very well lost the sense of time passing, or anything else existing, really, outsideof Sherlock's belly and himself, because the rumbling of Sherlock's voice has him gasp in surprise.
John had seen Mycroft going speechless before, but it never gets old, how his overly confident voice breaks and his mouth hangs open -not much, but still- while his usual disdainful expression elapses, for at least a short moment.
"I had completely given up on ever having grandchildren.  Now, can you imagine, John, in one year from now, you will show your baby the Christmas lights of the tree? Here, of course. You will spend Christmas here," Louisa decides, and John is immediately sure neither he nor Sherlock will have a say in the matter.
Peter Gainsburg has been beaten to death with a golf club.  The walls of his office were sprayed with blood from the force of the blows.
He lifts a conniving eyebrow at Sherlock who smiles in return.  Still slightly dizzy, John sees Claire Green's gun has fallen from her hand and kicks it away from her with his foot.  He better not try to bend his head right now.  He doesn't need to anyway.  The woman is curled on herself, both hands pressed to her face, moaning in pain and insulting him in between loud pants.  She has quite the colourful language, as it turns out.  John doesn't remember ever being called a "fucking arse face" before.
"Well, you are an idiot," Sherlock states matter-of-factly, stealing the last tart on the plate.  "But," he adds, lifting a finger when John begins to protest.  "I will admit I was hit by a certain sense of... inadequacy when I began to take notes.  It seemed that the more I read, the more I discovered the length of the changes we would have to make.  I would suggest we find a specialist store and buy everything there, which would reduce the tedious, horribly boring time we will spend shopping."
Another soft nod.  Sherlock doesn't even react when the paramedic takes his arm and rolls up the sleeve of his shirt.  John cannot remember when Sherlock lost his jacket, but he knows he left the coat at the flat.  John needs to text Lestrade about it.  Sherlock's coat is like a second skin.  He has once told John that Belstaff didn't make this particular model anymore and that he was "ridiculously attached to the thing."
John forces Sherlock's chin up so they can look at each other.  He grabs his face between his hands and takes his most reassuring, most confident tone.
Sherlock wiggles his toes under the water, making John laugh.  While he works the long pale toes, Sherlock apologises for his behaviour during the class, and John does, too.They come to the conclusion that they shouldn’t go back –
He's starting to drift off, certain Sherlock is almost asleep, when he speaks, sounding way too awake for John's liking.
Sherlock sighs but nods, turning the bedside lamp on while John lowers the sheet. Sherlock gets rid of his pants, parts his legs and tenses all over when John's hand gets close.
“Speaking with Hudders.  Remember the shoe picture Moriarty had sent as a first clue after the explosion last year?”
John would like to do it, to look Sherlock in the eyes and swear he'll stay alive and safe and close.  For as long as Sherlock needs it.  It would be a lie, though.  If there is anything he learned yesterday evening, it’s that life has a way to tip over, and that a couple of seconds are sometimes enough to make you stumble and fall.
It's a miserable sight, Sherlock wincing against the pain, wearing only a pair of boxer briefs and still sweating all over despite the four fans.  He expresses the wish to sleep it off, but Sherlock's sleep hasn't miraculously improved to the point he can nap on command, and he doesn't manage to have more than a vague tiring sensation.
Yeah, right. Plus, it's not like Sherlock will be able to help, buried as he is at the heart of all those layers.  Speaking of his feelings, when he never experienced intimacy with another person... John sighs and begins his ascension.  He walks as slowly as possible but still, in a matter of seconds –not even a damn minute to try and put himself together one last time- he’s facing the door.
“The rain hasn’t stopped,” Sherlock says with a somewhat dreamy expression.  “There are still lightning strikes once in a while... I...  Oh my god, John!”
Sherlock has left him there, called by Lestrade, and so John busies himself taking some note for his blog.  He doesn't know how many minutes go by, or what exactly makes him lift his head at the right moment.
"My John," Sherlock breaths out between kisses and caresses.  "You made me a free man.  I am completely infatuated with you."
"No, I said a two-mile radius around Southend Airport.  Am I...?  Of course I am certain, Gene, what sort of question is this? Yes, I'll wait."
Sherlock has asked to walk around, saying it is easier to keep worrying thoughts at bay that way.  John had agreed -anything to keep him calm- and he follows him around in between contractions.  The fire is now burning brightly, and the lights are up.  It took Mycroft a little less than half an hour to start the generator, and when he walked inside, oil was smeared on his face and hands, his hair was standing straight up on top of his head, but he looked so satisfied it took John all his will not to burst out laughing.
Sherlock shows John another photo, of a paint-peeling wall with huge red letters drawn on it, in a shape that suggests, or tries to imitate, the writing of a young child.
“You know it is usually more work for carriers, darling,” John reminds him.  “But the head is engaged and with each push it gets closer to be expulsed.  We’re getting there.”
When they had arrived (John sitting on the backseat with his leg propped up, Sherlock driving their rented jeep very slowly to avoid any shock that could hurt his wound) they had driven through the village of Storrington, a clean and touristy place almost out of a postcard.  It had been easy to locate the main street which, mostly because of summer tourism, offers all the shops they would need, and less than twenty minutes away from the cottage.  Sherlock has already driven down there twice and, if he had replied to John with a disdainful "
John lets go of Sherlock and, seeing as he shivers at the loss, grabs his dressing gown and helps him into it.  He collaborates silently.
And it is much more than just his looks: it's the way he walks and talks, everything studied and applied without a fault.  As if to compensate his human flaws.  If he lets slip a lisp while speaking to a client, or stumbles on a crack on the pavement, the event is treated with an exaggerated amount of shame and humiliation.  Sherlock prefers to choke on a scratchy throat than cough in front of people; he will act as if the blow to the head he's just received is barely a caress, waiting to be alone with John to grab at the furniture because he's too dizzy - well, look at that, the great Sherlock Holmes has a concussion...
They had discussed it during their last appointment, four days ago -a funny coincidence if you think about it.  Sherlock's exam had revealed their baby was still in a sitting position by then.
"I know you have.  Please, keep it.  For now, that is our best proof that you didn't have anything to do with your wife's death.  I will take care of speaking to the police first.  The chaps at Scotland Yard can be quite thick, but they listen to me.  You should be able to at least avoid prison.  If you are intelligent enough to follow my lead, that is.  Keep to your story, simply explain exactly what you told us.  Do not add unnecessary details."
"I relaxed, like you told me," Sherlock protests.  "And it was... relaxing, finding the man's address.  Helped my brain to focus on something other than early labour and such."
It goes on like this for fifteen more minutes, more or less, and the head of the baby is showing a little more each time. It is the largest and most difficult part of the small body to breach the birth canal, and as it gets closer, the pressure intensifies, and it takes its toll on Sherlock as the pain becomes more acute.  The birth canal’s entry is swollen and red.  John is massaging it to prevent any tear of the skin, and to try to relieve some of the pressure, but only the head getting expelled will do so.
"Yes, right, you just want to get into my pants," Sherlock jokes ponderously, but John is ready to give him a break.
“So, no.  You stay here and you try to get a couple of hour of sleep in that very uncomfortable looking chair."
"That is simplifying but true enough," Sherlock answers, just as quietly.  "She's in there - I still have trouble believing it," he adds, looking down his belly where one of his hands is resting firmly.  "I know it is nonsense, I feel her move every day."
“I know.  You have been very good for my brother, John.  Do not think my parents and I aren’t grateful for your presence in his life.”
Sherlock shakes his head violently, and it is so sudden John wonders for a second if he's in pain.  Then, he presses his fingers on his forehead, closes his eyes and groans.
The picture was not all that clear, and it would be difficult to identify anyone by those standards.  It was one of the reasons for the fight Sherlock and Lestrade had had after the interview. Lestrade had trouble seeing how irrefutable the proof was that the mysterious worker at
"Given her medical ailments, and general health conditions, she has probably still four years to live, if she doesn't encounter an accidental death in the meantime."
“John, please,” Sherlock cuts him off, voice strong and assured.  “I know what you are thinking, and yes, you might be able to practice a c-section here -I would trust you to do it.  Nevertheless, you might find yourself with the same problem we are currently experiencing, if the head is truly stuck, there is a serious risk of damaging the neck vertebra, and I will not get into specifics because I am currently trying very hard to ward off an impending panic attack.  What I am thinking of is a position that would allow my hips a larger width, a few millimetres, maybe, but it is better than nothing wouldn’t you say?  If I am crouching, we will obtain that effect, as well as be helped by gravity.”
Sherlock is doing incredibly well.  Whenever a contraction starts, he holds onto John, facing him, hands wrapped around his neck.  He concentrates on his breathing, and very rarely lets out a groan of pain. Still, John can tell it is getting harder.  His legs are less steady, and he needs more time to relax after a contraction.  Despite the fact that they remain close to the fire in the living room, and that John has put him in one of his old jumpers plus a pair of wool socks, Sherlock’s body is racked by shivers, some strong enough to have his teeth chattering.  It isn’t worrying.  It is a normal biological reaction to the hormonal outburst and the rapid changes Sherlock’s body is going through –it is the same principle as going into shock.  Nevertheless, John knows how exhausting shivering can be –it is draining the body of its precious energy, and Sherlock will need some later.  There is little John can do besides cranking the electric heat up and mop up the sweat from Sherlock’s face and hair.
"Sherlock, I am fine," John says slowly.  "I know it's been a hell of a night, and what happened is no one's fault except for Laura McMasters."
He slowly puts his violin away and turns toward John.  His face is even paler than usual, making his eyes stand out, so blue and bright they seem like something not fit for this world.  They have dark circles under them, though, and the rim is red.  Insomnia, or maybe... crying?
“I know that,” Sherlock protests softly.  “Do not think I doubt you, but this is... overwhelmingly scary.”
"He's getting some sort of respiratory therapy," Mycroft explains, looking relieved to have an excuse to get out.  "Keep me posted, John.  I am certainly not the person my brother needs or desires by his side right now.  Anthea is going to stay here so if you need anything, do not hesitate to ask."
Lestrade agrees, and finally lets Sherlock go, leaving him still unsure of what just happened, even redder than before, his hair sticking up to a side of his head, unsteady on his legs.
Harriet's fear of rejection is pouring out of each word, and that's it.  John cannot deal with this right now.  It's too much, he doesn't have the energy.  His involuntary silence does speak for itself.  John doesn't even know what he wants, but there have been so many broken promises, so many missed meetings, deception, and...
John smiles fondly.  His heart is swollen to the point it feels it might just give in to the pressure.
Then, for the second time of the day, he acts completely out of character by kicking the already immobilized criminal in the ribs, almost hitting John in the process.
"I am losing myself," Sherlock hisses.  "I can't control anything anymore.  I am not fit to care for myself, how can you do this to me?  Make me believe I am that formidable person, courageous, selfless; thinking -and convincing me- that I can actually do this, carry a child and then care for it.  The worst of it is that most of the time, it works.  I am so stupid, I feel good about myself, and I am actually looking forward to all that is to come.  And then, something like... the bloody heartbeat of a lentil has reality coming back to slap me in the face because I have. No idea.  What I'm doing.  And you -you, John, dear John, always so comforting and positive because you are enough of an idiot to think I am worth it, that I won't screw this up.  How dare you say you know what I am going through with your tiny, boring brain.”
"Too much sleep, everything's kind of... cottony," Sherlock complains.  "I would sell my soul for a coffee, if I could of course, because the human soul is a concept that has been-"
About this new chapter : I am so sorry, but it ends on another cliffhanger.  I couldn't work my way around it.  I'll do my best to post the next chapter very soon so you guys won't have to wait for long.
"It is," Sherlock agrees in a somewhat surprised voice, stopping right in the middle of pulling John's jumper off.
John stretches and arm and presses the back of his hand on Sherlock's forehead -he manages a second before Sherlock sighs and pulls back.  And yes, his skin is damp and hot.  He has a fever.  That explains the chills.
They eat Christmas dinner around two, and it's nice.  Sherlock is in a good mood, which has John in an excellent mood.  They eat slowly, after the present exchange, and John shares a long conversation with Louisa about their living space - are they intending to move, or is the flat fit for a baby?  This is a subject John and Sherlock haven't talked about yet, and the answers presents itself as evident when John gets to it.  Of course they'll stay.  Sherlock needs to be at the heart of London.  221B is their home.  John cannot see himself elsewhere either.
He has started shivering again, and it's not long before he breaks into a wet coughing fit.  It's like his body had held on as long as it had to and was brutally reminding Sherlock it wasn't okay after all.  John goes quiet too, wrapping an arm around Sherlock's shoulders.  It takes all but five minutes before Sherlock is asleep, snoring loudly with his mouth open and a crease between his eyebrows.  It's not a peaceful sleep.  It is still a pity, though, that he has to wake him up when they arrive at Baker Street.  Sherlock jolts awake, his eyes swollen and red.  He lets John drag him inside, stops at the bottom of the stairs to catch his breath, then in the middle, struggling with a sneezing fit that is not silent or discreet.  At the top, he watches as John opens the door, frowning.
John himself is drifting off, comfortable and spent, when he feels it, right under his palm.  A kick.  A discreet, soft kick, but it cannot be confused for anything else.  He smiles in the darkness, shoving his nose in the soft hair at the nape of Sherlock's head.  Waits for more.  He doesn't have to be patient because soon enough, he feels a wave going through the skin, and then a soft push.  Daddy's here, he thinks, indulging in the moment completely.  It is the first time John thinks of himself as a father.  So far, he's been so focused on Sherlock and his well-being, he neglected the fact that all of this is happening to him too.  He will be a father.  A weight settles on his heart, heavy with the knowledge of the new responsibility he's been burdened with.  Instead of feeling crushed, John has the wonderful sensation of being grounded, and gifted with the knowledge of a precious secret.
He bends down to kiss Sherlock's embarrassment away, and stays close to him, their faces inches away from the other.  "If what you learned prevents you from jumping in front of danger without thinking, it works for me.  And, of course your life is not your own.  It's mine," he whispers.
"I will never leave you, not if I have a say in the matter," John finally says, hoping it will be enough.
Sherlock presents his other foot to John and begins typing.  John takes the socks off as well and grabs Sherlock's left big toe, twisting it.
Outside, the wind has picked up, making leaves dance on the pavement.  John has to get closer to catch what Mrs. Holmes is yelling.
“I know. It is just wishful thinking, I guess.  Imagine the story we will tell our daughter about the day she was born.  All those events that lead us here, the tempest of the century trapping us... Every single element that had to be put in place so that I gave birth in that manner, with chaos all around, thunder, wind, hail, snow...  A landslide... “
Sherlock nods and pushes once more, shouting through the pain, his features contorted and shaking.  John twists himself to reach with both hands and grab the head.  Tilting his head, he sees it, the scrunched up, bluish face covered in vernix, the frontal fontanel pulsing, covered in a few hairs, curling.  Sherlock is pushing still, and it’s going too fast.
Mycroft smiles, almost sincerely.  “He doesn’t.  He should have deduced it by now.  Sentiment.  My genius of a brother has been rendered stupid by love.”
"Oh, John, I'm horrible," she says, shoving her head into her hands.  "Of course he isn't using.  And now I’ve upset him, the first Christmas he comes to spend with us in years."
"Oh, go on, suggest away," John says, trying to control the hysterical laughter bubbling in his throat.  "Meanwhile, I'm going to have a nice heart attack because I just bloody jumped on the baby train.  I was so focused on the pregnancy I never stop to think, really think, we would go from two to three come June.  Jesus, Sherlock, we are having a baby."
It takes another five minutes before Greg finishes celebrating the news with them, which is clearly too much for Sherlock, who's trying to busy himself, emptying a bag he brought with him in the closet, then making some tea -anything, it seems, not to listen to Lestrade's litany of "Unbelievable" and "wait ‘til I tell people at the Yard".
John's fist are clenched, and it doesn't escape Mycroft, of course.  He takes a step back, frowning.
Two weeks of complete inaction.  It reminds John something Mycroft had once said, about Sherlock being his own worst enemy.  John looks at him, at his tired eyes, the nervous way Sherlock's long musician fingers are playing with the sheet, and a strong wave of pity washes over him.  Instead of anticipating the worse, John takes the resolution, right there and then, to do everything he can to make Sherlock's forced inaction as easy on him as possible.  As long as his brain has something to work on, he should be alright.  And John will make sure to keep him busy.
"Yeah, you are," John agrees.  He takes a deep breath, his nose shoved into Sherlock's curls, getting drunk on his smell.  "A walk."
"I was about to propose to make a few calls for you, if you wanted a discreet... abortion, but I'm wrong, aren't I?  You and John are keeping it."
"What?   For Christ’s sake, Sherlock, we fought about a jumper! What makes you think I would break up with you for such a ridiculous thing?”
"Oh, I could put the missing pieces together; asking without really asking. Angie only partially understands the concept of death.  She thought, since Alexandra was spending so much time taking care of her infant, she would be lonely without her.  Hence the doll.  The rocking chair was a bit farfetched, in the line of thinking Angie is capable of, so she must have seen it in the building, maybe on the side of the street, or in another room.  What was still a mystery was the Sussex Vampire.  Why would she have the idea of writing such a thing on the wall?"
John knows Lestrade is fighting Sherlock away from the wound, and he gathers enough strength to call him, loud.  "Sherlock, he is right!  Let him do it... please, love."
"I know. I said it because I wanted to. Please don't doubt me.  You're the deducing genius, then deduce me."
"Give it back!  I will do it myself!” He shouts desperately, although there is still a hint of anger in his voice.  "Where is John!?  I want John!"
John gives up all pretences and concentrates, for the first time in five long days, on his own feelings.  He, too, had only thought about the logical side of this pregnancy so far.
Sherlock slides off John's dick which falls on his stomach, glistening with natural slickness, plump and red.
"As I was saying, John," Sherlock says, smiling a little.  "Do not think I am having an internal breakdown because of a urine stain that was barely the circumference of an apple."
. John loves it.  It's soft and comforting but there is also a hint of mischief and joy, it is perfect.  John closes his eyes and lets the music take him.  Sherlock has been playing a lot since he's been allowed to leave his bed, which tells John he must have missed it terribly.  He's now making up for lost time.
Sherlock expresses it differently.  He’s noticed John’s worries; of course he has, and had tried to explain. “I feel like my own being is entirely dedicated to the arrival of our child.  It fills my mind just as my body, so full there is no place for anything else.”
John steps back, feeling like a voyeur, wondering why that simple, quiet moment between mother and son is making him so emotional he's close to tears.
At some point, Sherlock let go of John's hand, and John is content to just observe all the emotions passing into Sherlock's eyes while he takes into account the transformation of the room.  He's happy, he's surprised, and deeply touched.
Sherlock has gone from cold, calculated calm to fury in an instant, yelling two inches away from John's face, so angry his lips are trembling with it.
Nevertheless, John is coming, and it's painful, and heavenly good, because he wasn't ready, hadn't braced himself for it.  He even whines, which is very unusual for him, and he's just present enough to hear Sherlock's reaction, a mix of loud moans and "love you" and "John, my John".  John opens his eyes just in time to see Sherlock grabbing his cock, with long trembling fingers, and cupping his already drawn-up balls with the other, pulling once, then tugging, his head of messy curls lifted so that he can see himself.  John's cock gives one last weak twitch just as Sherlock starts coming, his back arched, his mouth slack, and his eyes closing shut and perfect. Perfect.
"Sir," the unlikable moron starts with a condescending tone that makes John's skin crawl, "if you want us to take care of your friend, you will have to let us do our job properly, which implies-"
Sherlock follows, more or less.  His own mobile is trapped between his shoulder and his ear while he types on John's phone, moving his fingers at a dizzying rate.
“Tea would be nice,” he says.  And because he’s still Sherlock, what he means is: why don’t you make us some tea.
God, he’s pale.  He’s going through another contraction, and he doesn’t seem to have enough strength left to do more than whimper softly, eyes closed shut.  John takes his pulse, and is relieved to find it strong, albeit a little quick.
"It's fine, you know,” John reassures him, sitting heavily on the coffee table, "it is bound to happen more and more.  Remember, your muscles are practicing before-"
"Surely you do not think I am going to go now that the case is finally getting interesting?" He asks, lifting an eyebrow.
John smiles.  He only slept for an hour and a half, but he feels better than he has all day.  Greg stays a few more minute and they share their coffee in an agreeable silence, John's mind soothingly blank of any worries.
"Well, if it facilitates your understanding, yes, me.  Even if I am aware of the change as it happens, my brain will need some time to assimilate it, and change its spatial representation.  Which ends up giving me the false impression that my belly went from flat to its current state over night.  You hear it all the time, people say a baby bump is special, that one day there’s nothing and the next it's there, suddenly.  It's false, of course."
("No, you wally. I run faster so you won't do something stupid and get killed," John had replied once, after Sherlock effectively did something stupid that almost got him killed.)
"Good, because you didn't have control over it anyway," John agrees, sliding down the bath until he reaches Sherlock's feet.  "Massage?"
Sherlock stops, closes his eyes and articulates silently.  Then he tries again.  "Ap-pro-xi-mate-ly theven minutes between each one, which brings me to the following deduction: it has been twenty-nine minutes since the last contraction."
Sherlock seems to realize his mistake and takes a deep breath before taking a step toward John’s bed.  He points at the side of the mattress.  “Can I?”
"You look younger, like... mid-twenties, no more.  And sexy, in another way.  Your face is rounder, and... you know, I never noticed how cute your ears were before?"
He takes his hands off his eyes and offers them, wide and beautifully pale, to John's attentive gaze.  "I am going to be the father of a little girl; how is it always so hard to believe, how is it that I always need to convince myself that all of this is really happening?"
Their conversation is short, unsurprisingly.  How can it be otherwise when Mycroft doesn't even wait for John to say
"It is chemically impossible to fall in love with a place," Sherlock replies.  "Metaphorically speaking, though, it is probably the closest way to describe my reaction with accuracy."
Sherlock snorts, lifting his chin.  "Well, at least I'm not to be confused with hundreds of others."
“Amy told us during your last appointment that she was expecting you to have an easy, natural delivery. She expected no complications.  I will make sure there isn’t.  I swear, Sherlock, if help isn’t there in time, I will do whatever is necessary to keep the both of you safe.”
That is exactly what he is doing Friday afternoon.  He wasn’t surprised to find Sherlock asleep when he got back from the nursery.  He had spent an hour and a half there assembling the baby swing Molly bought them, leaving Sherlock to play his violin.  It had been silent for a while.
"As you say so often: don't be so dense.  You know what I mean.  That may be a disadvantage, but in another way, like I've said, it's bloody liberating.  So, I know it frustrates you, and trust me Sherlock, I'm doing everything I can to help, but I like the way things are.  And the way you are.  Fuck, I'm so far gone for you, just as you are."
“Of course Mycroft would be an excellent host in somebody else’s home,” Sherlock adds, and the little smile he’s making lacks the sarcasm that usually accompanies it.
"Cosy?" John laughs, amused at the term.  He stretches his head to look at Sherlock.  He's sitting, both hands feeling the cushion, his long fingers pressing into the fabric.  John's laugh gets louder.  He looks like the worst actor in the world selling furniture for a local store.
Nightmares aren't the only particularity of Sherlock's sleeping patterns when he lets his body rest out of exhaustion.  He will often talk in his sleep.  John once had a whole conversation with him, about, of all things, where the best place is in London to buy chips from a food van.  It is so funny, and also a little adorable, Sherlock's voice slow and lisping when he does it.  Also, it is a guilty pleasure of John’s to tell him about it the next morning, because Sherlock never remembers.  He'll get red in the face and always look for a logical explanation as to why his subconscious has latched onto the given matter.
"Part of me was angry because Mycroft was right.  Caring wasn't an advantage.  And being right about that meant he was probably right about the rest, and sometimes... Well, sometimes, I missed being a very young child, thinking I was normal, just like mummy and daddy.  But then I came to the conclusion that nothing could possibly be worth the suffering I went through when Redbeard died. I wasn't prepared, see,  because it was only with him that I was still remaining unguarded."
Sherlock tenses suddenly, letting out a surprised cry.  "Oh John, it's... I cannot stop it it's coming and it's coming fast," he babbles in a panicked voice.  "Faster, please, faster, need to, gonna-"
Sherlock gives him an annoyed look.  "How can you?  I barely make sense.  See, this, this is the problem when it comes down to sentiment... It's all... vague and... based on impressions... Nothing is ever certain, or clear. "
The most noticeable difference between carriers and non-carriers isn't visible unless you get very intimate with them.  Compare to normal males, carrier's anuses are larger on the inside because the rectum has a sheathed passageway to the reproductive system.  Since it also self-lubricates, it allows penetration with no preparation or very little.  Another difference is that the muscle spasms, when carriers experience orgasm through penetration, are said to give them greater pleasure than non-carrier men; it has the practical function of guiding the spermatozoids up toward the ovaries and keep them there.  Knowing how easily it would be to penetrate Sherlock, the bare thought that sex with him will never only be sex but will carry the potential for procreation, even if it never happens... Jesus, it has John's cock trying to fill with blood already.  He might very well have a fetish - or if not, it is still a huge turn on.  Not that he would admit that much to Sherlock.  The bastard is already smug enough for now.
"Sherlock, love?  Can you answer me?  Are you even hearing me?" He asks loud enough to cover the cries.
Panic settles low in his guts.  After another useless contraction and forceful push, Sherlock’s upper body is sliding down the armrest, and when Mycroft tries to keep him up, he sobs that he can’t, that it hurts too much, and ends up on his side, sobbing silently, shaking and sweating.  Mycroft looks at John, the question clear in his piercing eyes.  “What are you doing, what is going on?”
John tries not to appear impressed, once again, by the complete trust Sherlock puts in him.  "I do," he says with all the conviction he is capable of.  "And I will have your back when you give birth."
Green has just been taken away tied to a gurney, her face cover in drying blood.  As for Chambers, he waits at the back of a police car while Sherlock has his usual debriefing with Lestrade.
Fun facts :  So, the weather going completely bonkers is, of course, a deus ex machina so that I could have my boys exactly where I wanted them for the labour, and it might have been farfetched if it had been written a few years ago... But nowadays, with all the crazy weather we've been experiencing because of climate change... It seems almost, hum... believable?  So, yeah, I do not feel bad one tiny bit  ;-)
"Then go, we are not attached to the hip, John, we still are two separates individuals.  You tend to forget it."
Sherlock takes a deep breath, having forgotten to do so, once again, while he was speaking.  It triggers a light cough that doesn't last long.  John is satisfied by the sound of it.  No trace of accumulated mucosity. It seems Sherlock's cold is almost cured.
"Far too many," Sherlock admits.  "So I will be a coward like you, and wait before pronouncing myself."
His frustration doesn't really have to do with the case itself, if John is honest, but with the bloody fight he and Sherlock had gotten into after their first medical appointment.  In the cab ride to the crime scene following Lestrade's call, they had shared awkward apologies, but it had been done too quickly for it to really count.  Then, the Work had needed Sherlock's complete attention and focus.
"I... like this sss-so much," Sherlock admits.  "I lost my chain of thought again... Ah.  Yes, being sick is only another unusual thing on top of that odd feeling I have and... oh... oh!"
"Oh, John," Sherlock whispers, shaking his head softly.  "What happened between us was a shared fault.  Do not think you deserve any of the rubbish I laid upon you just because you cannot - and I mean because it is impossible- understand what being pregnant feels like."
,It's nice outside.  For the first ten minutes, Sherlock and John just walk side by side, in silence.  Sherlock leads the way, and they leave the busy streets to cut through a small quiet park.  They've been there before.  There is a pound with ducks.   John doesn't know why it is, but Sherlock can spend an hour observing them, calm and silent.  This time isn't different.  He points at a bench near the pound, and they both sit under the warming sun.  They practically have the park for themselves, except for a mother and her little boy, feeding the ducks with bread.  They are on the other side of the pound, but the little boy's crystalline laugh reaches them.  John smiles and lets his thoughts bring him to a time in the near future where he'll be able to do the same.  Take his daughter here and feed the ducks.  Teaching her how to do it properly. Watching her laugh.
John wanted to sound at least annoyed, but he cannot manage to hide the smile in his voice.  And Sherlock knows it.  With his usual swift way of moving when he has his mind focused on something, he takes the step separating him from John, his blue dressing gown flying behind him, and sits himself on John's lap, facing him, both legs bent at the knees, wedged in the sides of the chair.  Automatically, John lifts his arms to settle his hands on Sherlock’s hips.  As for Sherlock, he puts his on John's shoulders, bending down to kiss him, a quick warm one, mouth only slightly open.  It's lovely.
John contemplates Sherlock, not even trying to follow the conversation - well, monologue.  His speech pattern is impressive, even for him, bordering manic.  Sherlock's mental list will be properly addressed later.  For the moment, John is content, even a little fond, to see him using one of his most frequent coping mechanism.  The verbal assault is reassuring, familiar for Sherlock.  John thinks of it as a way he has found to relieve his mind when it becomes too full. John nods when he thinks it's needed, then finishes washing the traces of soap off Sherlock's skin before they run out of hot water.
"Hello, there," Sherlock had murmured, caressing his stomach lightly.  Then he had looked up at John, smiling without reserve.  "She is wonderful, isn't she?"  John had nodded silently, incapable of speaking at that moment.
It is doable.  Hell, some people give birth in cabs after all.  It is John who needs to adapt, not Sherlock.
"You didn't come.  When I texted you," he whispers, trying to keep his tone even.  "That is the first time.  You always come back to me when I ask you to. And you told me yesterday you were tired of my behaviour.  I came to the conclusion that you no longer wish to continue our relationship.”
Now though, if he were to write about himself, and the way his life has changed since he moved in with Sherlock, the timing would be perfect. Here he is, laying on his hospital bed, drifting in and out of the stupefied artificial sleep of morphine.  He has survived the explosion with very few consequences: some bruises and scratches, a couple of cracked ribs and a broken wrist –which explains the strange alien sensation John had been feeling.  The pain came later, during the ambulance ride, to be precise.  At the A & E, John’s wrist had to be set before being immobilized, and the doctor hadn’t been cheap on the morphine dosage.  Not only does John not remember the actual setting of his broken bone, but he’s lost all sense of passing time.  He could be lying in this dark hospital room for hours or weeks, and he wouldn’t be able to tell the difference.  His thoughts are following him in and out of consciousness, and would probably make zero sense if they could be accessed, but to John, they are clear and logical.  He's living through his own very private exposition.
His legs are shaking.  John isn’t certain they would hold him up, if he wasn’t there to support him.
John slides under the blankets, turning on his side to wrap an arm around Sherlock's belly.  Sherlock sighs, blinking, as if he's just realised he's not alone in bed anymore.
“I am still scared, of course, but it is neutralised by my discomfort.  It is more than that, though.”
"We'll stop," John reassures him in a soft voice.  "If you want me to stop at any time, you just say the word."
"Then explain to me why you look exactly like it?  Do you have any ideas what it does to me to see you like this, emaciated and-”
Sherlock’s long moan ends on a dry sob, followed by a series of curses.  Mycroft walks over to them.  He looks a bit scared and unsure what to do. “John?  Do you need me to prepare something?  I don’t know, boiling some water or-“
John decides right then, watching fondly over Sherlock eating his chips with a satisfied look on his face, that it is more than time he has a private conversation with Mycroft Holmes, and not only to ask for his help surprising Sherlock with his own private laboratory.
"My penis does not hurt," Sherlock says, already panting, "but it is more sensitive than usual.  Please do not apply too much pressure."
No baby-shower.  John had sent an email to everyone they knew to make sure they understood he was being serious, suggesting instead how lovely it would be to receive their congratulations through the mail –because it would have been cruel to not give their friends and family at least one chance to celebrate Sage’s arrival.
John knows what is coming.  They will argue about whose fault it is, both trying to take the responsibility.
The quote about Sherlock being a volcano is directly taken from an interview with Mark Gatiss and Steven Moffat.
It's hard, keeping his composure because it's so scary, seeing Sherlock like this -it hurts.  Physically.  Mentally.
Eight months to go.  John had started to believe they would be similar to the past few days, and that he had better brace himself for it; then, when he had arrived this morning, Sherlock had still been sleeping -good- then had shared breakfast with him - very good - not mentioning the pregnancy but trying his best to at least seem interested in John's night shift.  He was already playing his violin when John had gotten out of the shower to discover Sherlock had -by himself!- made pot of coffee for him.
Sherlock had examined John's face for several seconds, probably pondering if he would really dare act on his threat.
Right.  It's been more than two months since they were in presence of the whole team.  They have seen Greg in the meantime, but that is all.  And Sherlock, as struggling as he is with his physical appearance, isn't comfortable with the reaction he will certainly provoke.  Hence the coat, which he surely would have keep if he hadn't been sweating on the stairs.
“Why...”  John clears his throat.  “Why on earth would you think it wasn’t possible for me to be head-over-heels in love with you?”
John already knows the answer, but he still needs Mycroft to validate him.  The older Holmes shakes his head curtly.  Then, for the first time since John has known him, he gives up control of a situation he’s part of.  The sentence is simple; a few words, but they carry an immense weight with them.
Sadly, the musical interlude lasts for all of five minutes. When Sherlock needs to stop for the third time to sneeze, he throws the violin on his chair in frustration and goes into his room, closing the door behind him, which is a sure sign he wants to be left alone. John is more than happy to comply.  He's sure Sherlock is tired enough to sleep if he sulks long enough.  John settles for a quiet afternoon of reading by the fire when he begins hears some shuffling noise in the bedroom.
"I think we are, hum... done here," John gives the stupefied room an artificial smile and takes Sherlock's hand.  He follows without resistance.
"I know, I can see," Sherlock cuts him off in a low voice.  He takes a hesitant step forward, pressing John's fingers with a death grip, and clears his throat.  "As I was saying, a simple thank you carries as much... As much huh..."
The kick he receives below the knees has him groaning in pain, but he endures stoically.  It's not like he didn't asked for it.
"I have no desire to act upon the possibilities my biology offers me, and although the idea of a child might seem somewhat romantic, even to me, I won't ever change my mind," Sherlock declares, his voice confident but his eyes lost.
"There you go," John grunts, knowing Sherlock now has his dick nudged against his prostate -which is larger than a non-carrier's gland and swells to twice its size during intercourse, another little difference that fascinates John.  Sherlock brain is shutting down, and it pleases him, seeing him move with intent, rising up and down John's dick, his graceful back bowing, his head tilted up, his powerful thighs flexing effortlessly.  It is so rare, Sherlock taking control so completely, and John, already close, can forgive the fact that he's still speaking.  Who bloody cares when Sherlock is riding him, managing to still look graceful when bouncing on his dick, his body on display in the most lovely way: all his muscles shifting under his sweat-covered skin.
"You will forgive me if I'm ignorant of the conventions regarding ruptures, is it me that should leave?  You are the one who ended things so I assumed… "
"We can’t do the second coat of paint right now, the first needs at least a couple more hours to dry.  It's sunny outside and my leg needs exercise.  Are you coming?"
"Don't be embarrassed, please," John says soothingly while his free hand slides between them both and finds its way to Sherlock's belly, forcing the already half pulled down zipper all the way.
Sherlock pushes, as strongly as he has done before.  His hands are on Mycroft’s knees to give him some leverage.  The push is silent and the longest one he’s given.  John, half kneeling, half lying on his side, doesn’t have the clearest view, but he is using one hand to lubricate the birth canal, and feel the baby’s head at the entry.
"You're bigger than me," Sherlock wonders.  "Oh, you feel so good in my hand. I want to help you, let me help."
Sherlock looks straight at John, and there is no frenzy or impatience in his eyes.  He's sincere.  It might not please him, but he is.
There was that one evening he started hiccupping and couldn't get rid of it. He was actually embarrassed to hiccup in front of John, even more embarrassed when he declared he knew the scientific way to stop it and it failed miserably.  And then John, who by that point was as enamoured by Sherlock's shyness as much as he felt sorry for him, had discovered something else.  Almost an hour after the hiccupping had started, it was still going on, and Sherlock went from pissed to anxious in a matter of minutes.  The fear of losing control, of being rid of it, is almost a phobia for Sherlock.  He had needed to be coaxed into taking a hot bath with John and even then, it took several minutes of snuggling and murmuring nonsense before Sherlock finally calmed down.  With it, the hiccups went away.
Sherlock sits on the bed and joins his hands once more.  He's shaking, staring into emptiness, his eyes still fierce but also liquid, darker.
A slow, agonizing violin note swells in the flat.  Sherlock plays that piece he loves so much, something from Gorecki he adapted to play as a violin solo.  The title is, if John remembers, not exactly joyous: something about sorrow.  As for the music itself, it would make anyone close to tears.
Right on key, Sherlock  illustrate his point by sneezing.  When he blows his nose, it ends up in another wet coughing spell.  John frowns.  He doesn't like the sound.
"Oh.   It's almost ridiculous how perfectly we complete each other, Sherlock," John says when their lips part.  " It turns me on so much when you're like this, because I have you completely at my mercy, pliant and docile, while the rest of the time you're like a wild horse impossible to tame."
Camila was secretive, and Afton had learned not to ask question because she rarely received answers to them.  She must have been celibate because she had never mentioned otherwise, and since she had been paid in cash, Laurie Afton didn't even have an address, only the number of a mobile phone -which turned out to be deactivated when Sherlock had tried it.
It's not like John doesn't love rubbing and caressing Sherlock's body any way he can, right?  When he's satisfied, he concentrates on providing pleasure to his lover by reaching for his nipples and pinching them -not too hard, Sherlock is overly sensitive when it comes to them- while he lifts his head to ask for a kiss.  Sherlock shivers once more and bends his head, his heavy curls tickling John's face, allowing himself a chance to shove his nose in John's hair and breathe in deeply. Sherlock's sense of smell is very acute -years of practice, he keeps telling John, categorizing perfumes, some poisons and a wide variety of flowers scents.  John doesn't really care, except he loves it when Sherlock gives up control and takes what he wants.  He's so in touch with all of his senses, and his keen sense of smell is probably the most developed one.
Sherlock makes a curious deduction the morning after the end of the case.  John has put him in a hot bath , hoping the vapour can help him with his clogged sinus.  Then, kneeling on the floor near him, he washes Sherlock’s hair tenderly, taking time to massage his skull. Sherlock becomes very quiet, humming low in his throat, looking like he's ready to fall asleep.
This chapter is the last one about the case Sherlock is working on, The Sussex Vampire.  So, it is case-heavy, I am sorry if it isn't something some of you enjoy.
"It is still related to your immune system, which, as you so nicely pointed out, doesn't work properly.  Ah.  Pregnancy and its many joys."
The food is excellent, and the supper is surprisingly relaxed.  Who would have thought?  Mycroft’s conversation can be interesting, when he lets go of his cantankerous responsible big brother persona.  Or maybe it’s the wine, but John finds himself laughing out loud more than once.  Sherlock is quiet but this is nothing new.  He keeps eating, very slowly, small bites he chews several times each, observing Mycroft and John’s conversation with a mix of amusement and exasperation.
"Sherlock isn't the only one using an unsanctioned network of informants.  Let's say mine aren't used to seeing me in person, and I had to convince a couple of them to speak to me.  Forcefully."
Without thinking, John grabs Sherlock in a tight hug.  A long moment passes before his lover seems to realise what is happening and relaxes into his embrace.  Then, Sherlock starts shaking.
“It’s fine, Sherlock, it’s... You’re going to have a baby.”  How can those words sound so surreal, even now that John is
John walks the bedroom, drying his hair with his towel.  Sherlock is lying over the covers of the bed, still dressed, staring at his mobile.  His cheeks are pink, as much from the generous meal as from spending supper being forced to talk about babies, mood swings, and hormones.
"Yes, love, do it, come for me," John coaxes, lowering his hands to solidify his grip on Sherlock's arse.
John grins, and keeps holding the nipple between his teeth while he rolls the other between his thumb and index.  Sherlock's hips rise from the bed, enough for John to feel his cock fully hard and leaking.
You have the nerve to say that to my face when we both know how immature and infantile you've been acting for the past week because, God help us all, the Great Sherlock Holmes finds himself bored.  Bored!"
"You know," he says slowly, choosing his words.  "We can wait... before you make the final decision.  At least a couple of days."
It's John's turn to smile.  "Sherlock wonders the same thing.  Well, from his perspective.  He wonders how to let you in."
Not only do they hear the heartbeat, but Dr. Brown has isolated the image that takes all the screen now, of a still blurry beating heart that is perfectly formed and pumping.  John swallows back the knot of emotions and clears his throat.
Sherlock constantly puts himself in danger, whether facing criminals and dangerous situations, or by simply neglecting his most basic needs.  John can't possibly ask him to stop everything because he's carrying a child, but damn it, he's not a clerk, he's the world's only consulting detective.  John is constantly looking out for him because Sherlock, even though he has made progress ever since they started their relationship, has come to rely on him, and it's a shared fault.  They work so well together, but the balance has now shifted, they need to rethink everything.
Could happen.  Right now, while he gets ready to jump over a pile of folded cardboard, John kind of wishes it would have happened already.  He lands too hard, feeling a strain in his right ankle.  No time to worry, though, so he keeps running...
In the time they have been together, Sherlock's only term of endearment for John had been to add "my" before his name, and on rare occasions. Once, Sherlock had irritatingly told John that he couldn't, he just felt like an idiot trying pet names in the mirror, practicing to see if he could pull it off at the appropriate moment.  John had laughed at the image -he didn't care, he used pet names himself because they came naturally to him.
"Well, of course we could," Sherlock says distractingly, shedding his jeans and pants on the floor.  "The cottage is ours."
Sherlock lifts his shirt -the position he's in is the one where his bump is the most on display, and John's mouth fills with saliva, while his dick gives a soft twitch.  At the same time, there is a warm sensation in the pit of his stomach, that has nothing to do with sex.
It might not be possible, though, and there is no way John is forcing Sherlock to move if he refuses.  The advantage of the sofa is that it only has one armrest (which is the reason Sherlock could fit on it in the first place), with the other side giving John an easy access.  It is also close enough to the fireplace that he won’t have to worry about Sage suffering from hypothermia.
Lifting his head, John sees Sherlock, seated on the other side of the table, gazing at a picture.  He turns it to show Louisa.  It's a garden in front of an old, decrepit house.  An auburn head of curls is showing in the middle of a bush of tall ferns.
Annoyed but seemingly too tired to argue, Sherlock follows John in their bedroom.  He's almost passive, shedding off his clothes and then lying on his back while John holds the duvet.
John feels like an arsehole, forcing Sherlock to remain on his back in the middle of the contraction.  The pain is worse that way.  “It’s like a metal rod piercing me from hip to hip.”
The meeting with Amy Brown lasts another half an hour.  With Sherlock's due date approaching, there is much to discuss.
your favourite jumper," Sherlock points out, lifting his chin in defiance as if his revenge had been in fact very cruel and calculated, which... well,
"Never gives you an instant of respite, that brilliant mind of yours," John says quietly, trying to imagine how it must feel.  When he has a busy shift at the surgery, he feels so damn tired coming back home, mentally tired, as if he's given his brain too many things to work on.  That mental tiredness times a hundred, or even a thousand, is it close to what Sherlock experiences on a daily basis?"
Sherlock turns John's phone toward him to show the image of a shop with a yellow and green banner in the window.  "Le Pouce Vert," John reads slowly. " It's French".
Sherlock shrugs.  "Ok or not, it is not something I can control.  With the hormones overflowing my brain, I can only go with it.  It is only chemistry after all.  Fascinating."
“That’s not it,” Sherlock cuts him off, with what is supposed to be an exasperated eye roll, but turns more pleading than anything else.  “I...  if I let myself go, as you say... John, I will lose whatever control I have left.  I can’t... I’m afraid I won’t be able to get it back.”
This is apparently the wrong thing to say.  Sherlock’s head lifts up, turning toward Mycroft.  “And how would you know?  I would like to see you in my place, brother dear, given that you faint each time you see a needle.”
Sherlock does.  He has wide, innocent eyes, this look he reserves for when he lays himself bare, figuratively, for John.  He cannot help but kiss his chapped lips.  It makes Sherlock shiver.
It is cracking, this facade; has been progressively, over the last few months.  John can very well see in Mycroft’s eyes the quick flashes of affection, or worry, as Mycroft has witnessed Sherlock’s transformation from a too-thin man moving with grace and agility, to the slower, clumsier version of himself he has become, carrying an ever-growing belly in front of him.  When they are together, he will behave less disdainfully and complacently than usual, and will often let go when Sherlock’s bantering gets too personal, or cruel.  He just doesn’t answer, which takes Sherlock completely off guard, each time. With time, though, it seems he has processed the same observations as John and has decided he could deal with his brother’s less distant, more warm-hearted attitude.
John feels himself blush, setting things into motion.  He's struck by how Sherlock looks.  It's not just about the obvious signs of physical desire - the way he's leaning toward John, breathing already picking up - it's also about what can be read in Sherlock's eyes: uncertainty and arousal, anticipation, shyness and affection.  John has never seen him so open before and it triggers a burning fire in the pit of his stomach.  He's already hard and he hasn't even kissed Sherlock yet, but then he goes for it, starting by pressing small kisses all over the other man's face.
John turns toward him and wraps a hand around his shoulders the best he can.  "Come on, now.  It's only normal to feel like this.  It's all pretty recent.  It is going to stay with us for a while, Sherlock.  I might have nightmares, or be more nervous on crime scenes.  The same goes for you.  We just have to allow ourselves the time to get over it.  We will."
"I do not know what is the etiquette for hugs but I believe we've exceeded the determined period and are now heading toward an abnormally long time.  Plus, I cannot breathe properly."
At least, now that the birth has happened, for those too tired of waiting, you have there a satisfying ending, but there is still a bit more Sherlock will be submitted to before the true ending.  ;-)
He sees all of her petite body now, and how red her face is when she turns to look behind her shoulder, eyes big and fearful -oh god, why did she run, she's just aggravating her case, John thinks in a sudden bout of sympathy.  She needs to slow down because if she keeps her current rhythm she'll meet the brick wall face to face.  John himself has already slowed his pace, and then...
"This is definitely not digestion," Sherlock murmurs, widening his fingers.  "And it is consequent with the baby's development, although it varies greatly, especially for a first pregnancy."
John knows he's getting worked up, but his frustration is an accumulation of two years trying to explain basic economics to Sherlock.  And it is not because he needs to be told, he's a god damn genius.  He simply refuses to acknowledge a subject he can afford not to think about.
"I... That is not what I said either," Sherlock murmurs, casting a look at John sideways, a shy, insecure glance.
Luckily, it will only be the two of them and Mycroft -Mrs. Hudson isn't even there. The new laboratory is a big deal, though, and John is almost glad Sherlock already knows about it: at least, the present isn't really a surprise anymore.
After a little while, John goes in search of his book and finds on his part of the desk the spreadsheet Sherlock had designed for the baby’s room, right after they had found out about the gender.  He smiles to himself as he goes back to his chair, going over the small but impeccably formed handwriting that covers half the sheet.  Trust Sherlock to treat the preparation of a nursery as a scientific matter.  Each colour they’ve discussed is listed, each one with its psychological effect.  There are several dispositions of the furniture suggested and they all have a theme, like: “pro-efficient” or “light-oriented.”
Long story short, dear mpreg amateurs, it is coming.  The first part has four chapter and you've just read the third one.  I can already tell you that the second part begins with the baby's conception ;-)
"Always so modest," John mocks.  "I would like to see you try.  Anyway, it took me twelve minutes to succeed.  The hum... crotch region is especially challenging."
-The Sussex Vampire is an ACD story, you can read it (but it isn't necessary) online for free.  In my story, some elements of the original case will be used, but twisted, like it is done in the show.  Although this case Sherlock and John are working on will have some importance in the upcoming chapters, I am not turning my hurt-comfort fic into a casefic.  The focus of the story will remain on Sherlock and John dealing with the pregnancy.
"No, she will not want to see one of her parents exhibiting his swollen belly in some ridiculous pose.  Couples do those photos for themselves, not the children."
“Alright,” John murmurs, taking a deep breath to remain calm despite what just happened.  He needs to be.  Mycroft has never seemed so lost and out of his element.  As for Sherlock, fear has taken over logic and judgement.  John cannot blame him.  He presses his hand over his face, rubs at his eyes.  “Alright,” he repeats.  “New plan.”
"Thank me?" John laughs, ruffling Sherlock's hair.  "Sherlock, you’re the hottest person I've ever had sex with.  Besides," he adds more seriously.  "It's... it wasn't just getting each other off, you know.  I..."
.  There is no soldier seated in the backseat.  Only Sherlock, draped in his coat, holding a small bundle of yellow blanket expertly, smiling down at it and hushing it softly.
He kisses Sherlock again, longer, using his tongue to explore the inside of his mouth, soft prods and licks that always get Sherlock worked up and moaning.  That he does, before breaking the kiss softly, a flicker of regret in his eyes dark with desire.
The paramedic, a buff little guy who seems to think the uniform he wears makes him all powerful and unquestionable, doesn't take the insult well.  He tries to get Sherlock's arm back, even though his colleague, an older woman with a Latino complexion, tries to intervene.
Sherlock swallows, his breath hitching.  John holds him tighter.  "It never leaves my thoughts, even though I try so hard to occupy my mind otherwise.  A part of my mind seems to have decided it was a good idea to dedicate itself to my fears, and the worst scenarios I can imagine swirl around one after the other.  There are so many things that can go wrong when a child is born, for the child as well as the father, and so many illnesses and birth defects that cannot be diagnosed in the womb.  It is driving me crazy, John.  I am used to managing my thoughts like a rider does a carriage driven by a wild horse, with firmness and a great amount of willpower.  My brain is so incredibly fast that if I do not hold the reins firmly, my thoughts escape to many different directions and it gets impossible to function."
This is most probably behind them now.  All Sherlock needs to do is to build up his strength. His attitude in the car today is so much
"You're beautiful, Sherlock, you know that?  You're fucking amazing, and taking me so good.  Look at me love.  Come on, I know you can do it."
There are more people this time, although they still are the only carrier couple. The room is buzzing with noise and lively chatter.  It is evident most of the couples have taken more than one class together and, contrary to last week, when the whole room had froze at their arrival, no one seems to notice them except the nurse.  Good.Sherlock hates being observed unless he is in show off mode.
"We can now start the work on the nursery in your old room." Sherlock states, sitting up straight and sudden.  A project.  Sherlock will jump on anything that can distract him from boredom, and too much time to think about difficult stuff like love and concern.
Hearing "darling" from Sherlock, though, makes him second-guess his own self-proclaimed indifference on the matter because now there are tears on his cheeks -few, and producing them actually hurts, but John cannot help it.
John sits up and bends forward to watch Sherlock's pouting face; he wants to be certain he will listen.
Then the world explodes.  John crouches, caught in the incredibly hot wave of air that pushes him backward.  He’s going to fall on his back, and he knows that's not good.  The debris will hit him on the ground -that is, if he doesn’t hit his head in the fall, and-
Sherlock opens his eyes wide.  "You took my mobile away from me to know what I think of... a couch, while I am discussing a criminal investigation about a woman who was most probably murdered?  Are you serious?"
John, strangely, is spared, which should be nice, except it means he has to be hyper vigilant every time they are not alone, because everyone else is fair game.
And for anyone who knows Sherlock, that is huge.  That is care taking.  It’s clumsy, and singular, but still.  John doesn’t make anything of it. He even finds it endearing, telling himself it will all go back to normal as soon as the cast is off, probably before that, even, once the novelty of the situation is gone.  It doesn’t, though.
The paint job will have to wait for tomorrow, but at least the room is empty and clean.  John proposes to go grab something at the Thai restaurant down the street, which Sherlock has been especially fond of for the past couple of months. A pregnancy craving?  John hasn’t dared bring it up, he just has the feeling Sherlock would be insulted enough to refuse eating there anymore.
John grabs his arm.  "Sherlock, slow down.  What is it?  Listen, I know it's a big deal, listening to the heartbeat of the baby for the first-"
John helps him sit while Sherlock, oblivious, stares at two pictures on the wall, letting himself be guided down onto the couch.  The first photo is of a pretty woman with dark hair and almond-shaped eyes.  The second is the portrait of a baby girl that might be six to eight months old.  She has a fair complexion and her father's wide blue eyes.  The only thing Sophie Beeks seems to have inherited from her mother is her full, heart-shaped mouth.
He falls asleep like that, less than five minutes later.  John is glad.  He intends to pack most of their things tonight so that they will be ready to go in the morning.
"My blood pressure is a little high," Sherlock points out, and John understands only because he's had years of training of hearing patients through heavy plastic masks.
Sherlock lifts his chin.  "I... might have," he admits, trying to repress a smile. "My god, my dear John, we are getting incredibly domestic."
And then, John's quiet peace of mind is broken abruptly as an all-too familiar black car stops in front of 221 Baker Street and the slim ending tip of Mycroft's umbrella makes its appearance, followed by the brother himself half a second later.
"Jesus, Sherlock, you're going to drive me mad," John mutters.  He takes a deep breath to remain calm.
John stands up slowly.  He really doesn't want to fight.  If Sherlock hadn't insisted on using Mycroft's credit card, they wouldn't even be having this conversation.  On the other hand, maybe it was overdue.  Money can break couples, he knows.  Soon, they will be married, legal contracts will have to be signed, and money will without a doubt be a matter their solicitor will want to discuss.  Better to root out the evil now.
"You are close, too," John wonders, tilting his basin up.  "Christ, Sherlock, you're going to come in your pants by rubbing yourself all over me…Jesus. Do it.  I want to see."
"Can my second reason to be married, after, of course, our child's well being.... can my second reason be that I love you like crazy and do not wish to spend a single day apart from you?"
“I know, and it’s fine.  But you are the strongest person I know, Sherlock, and you will do an amazing job –you already are.”
"Mmh," Sherlock says, leaving the matter to rest.  He settles back on John's chest.  "Hearing your heart beat is very reassuring."
"Stop being so bloody condescending. It's annoying, that patient tone you use as if I am as fragile as glass.  I am not.  " Sherlock yells, yanking his arm away.
who's yelling at you for not saying how great the bloody couch is.  Ironic, isn't it?  I just gave you a taste of my best stay-at-home boyfriend imitation.  Complaining about doing the chores without a thank you, as if I've just accomplished a fucking miracle."
With each compliment, John kisses the inside of Sherlock's thighs, and he shivers every time, the grips of his fingers so tight his knuckles are white. John aligns himself and pushes slowly, very slowly, while Sherlock, eyes closed shut, lets out controlled harsh little pants, frowning, as if in pain, but John knows better.
, John, you do remember what a case is?  Crime scene, Lestrade is out of his depth.  He's sending a car for us."
“I don’t know,” Sherlock protests, visibly exasperated at himself.  “I’ve been experiencing pain in my lower back,nothing like the usual pain, but now it’s gone, and I... had the strangest feeling, a few minutes ago, as if... something... my god, I hate having trouble putting words to things,I...it’s as if something has snapped, in me.  It didn’t hurt.  It felt –do not laugh at me-“
"Maybe... maybe I'll become a bit... irrational during the more painful phase, and if it happens, if suddenly, I'm pleading for drugs instead of the anaesthesia, please remind me I'm an ex-addict."
John doesn’t answer, he can’t.  What he does is shove a pillow in between Sherlock’s legs and move next to him, rubbing his back and telling him to breathe.  When Sherlock looks at him, his swollen, liquid eyes are as intelligent as they always are, despite the pain, the exhaustion and the fear.  He already knows what John is about to tell him.
"God, look at you, I can't believe you're letting me touch you, I can't... " John brushes his lips against Sherlock's cupid bow, and oh, feeling those small puffs of warm breath against his cheeks...
"There is a food truck if we head this way," he says, pointing to his right, when  they exit the park. "They have those great chips with all sorts of dip.  I could go for some chips."
They are stuck.  The mud pit isn’t a mud pit.  It’s a landslide cutting off their onlyaccess to Storrington, and the hospital.
John sighs and wraps an arm around Sherlock’s shoulders.  “I prefer my overly romanticised version.”
When he shakes himself awake, Lestrade is, again coming into his room, like some sort of déjà vu. John is rested, though, and the light has changed.  Also, Greg carries a stack of newspapers under his arm and a coffee tray in the other.
"Your nightmare, Sherlock... It's the first time I’ve seen you reacting... physically that way.  Was it that terrible?"
Harry sighs very softly.  "Yes, he did.  He seems to love you very much, Johnny.  I am happy for you."
John nods, but doesn't even try to believe it can be true.  Shopping with Sherlock is hell.  When he doesn't complain like a five year old you've forced to come along, he gets incredibly difficult when he is in fact interested in buying something.
“Oh.  It’s snowing,” Sherlock murmurs, sliding his upper body out of the car to stare at the sky as well.
I want to wish happy hollidays to all of you who celebrate Christmas, and well... for the others, virtual hugs coming your way, just because.
The stairs leading to the flat float in front of his eyes.   John’s not drunk: he had Mycroft’s driver drop him to a pub ("
"Never did," Sherlock agrees, lifting his head to look at John.  "Now it feels a lot like I have lost the reins, at least partially.  My emotions and my fears refuse to be put to their place by logic.  And I do not know how to control them."
Sherlock swallows audibly.  He seems close to tears.  “Are... are you sure I’m doing it the right way?  Is there really progress?”
"Okay?" John asks, because he knows penetration is very intense for Sherlock, sometimes overwhelming.  The first few times, he actually fainted after coming, something John had until then thought only happened in bad porno movies.  He handles it better now, but there is a reason they don't do it every time they have sex.  Afterwards, Sherlock is weak and too close to his emotions for his liking.
Their usual banter loosens the atmosphere.  Sherlock slowly walks around the room, observing all the instruments, chemical products and professional furniture, letting his long fingers slide over things, delicately tracing their shape.  Mycroft is careful to throw in a snarky comment here and there, which allows Sherlock to reply in the same tone and remain his good old self.  It is fascinating, observing their little game, the both of them knowing Mycroft does it to get Sherlock more at ease and comfortable, all the while pretending to be oblivious to the whole thing.
Sherlock nods and gives John a sideways look.  He's smiling now.  "I am only smiling because you are," he specifies.  "Smiling is a reaction of the sympathetic system that-"
, and understand, everything that going on. He is grateful, because the next step is most probably being taken to the stabilisation room, a place where Sherlock cannot follow.  Might as well feed off his presence while he still can.  Who knows how this night is going to unravel.
There it is, the knot in John's stomach, the swelling in his throat.  He should try to compose himself, but instead offers the window to his feelings for Sherlock to see, to have him realize he is not the only one choked up on sentiment right now.
It fascinates John.  What really gets to him, though, is how adamant Sherlock is to include him, every step of the way.  It is always vaguely frustrating, not being able to experience a pregnancy first hand, and knowing you will never truly understand what it is to have this new life taking root inside you.But as John feels truly and completely included in the experience, he doesn’t suffer much from it.
And apparently he wants to ride John, which has only happened once so far but has been mind-blowing.
No, no one is dying... except of embarrassment, maybe. But there is no going back when you just fought over a doll
Sherlock stares at him with fondness, an expression John rarely sees, and always directed at him.  He supposes from now on, he’ll have to share itwith their daughter.
"I will sit with you for a little while," Sherlock tells him, bending over him to plant a soft kiss to his lips.  "Then I'll lay down on the couch."
Sherlock allows himself to smile while undoing the buttons of his shirt.  "Very well.  First things first: of course, sexual intercourse is out of the question.  I'll remind you that my parent's bedroom is right below ours.  Second, I have no idea what you are referring too; it surely is another pop culture reference I do not get, but my old room has long since been converted into an office for my mother."
"I know you are perfectly awake," Sherlock snaps. "And if you think I am going to sit with other pregnant people speaking of baby kicks and gastric reflux you are so, so deeply mistaken, John Watson.  By the way, I hope you do not really wish to have a plaster made of my belly because I can assure you it will not happen.  Not in a hundred years.  I cannot believe you really thought I would just go with it and..."
Sherlock elbows John in the ribs with all the strength of a kitten. He yawns and settles comfortably, grabbing John's hand on his belly and holding it there, trapped in his own.  This time, when he blinks, it seems his eyelids remain closed. Good.
Sherlock is up near the toilet, his wet pants and trousers pooling at his feet. He stares down with the same startled expression he has since his waters broke.
The older Holmes remains calm and unfazed.  “I know, and I know you, Sherlock: that’s why I know you can do it.”
Sherlock stops, mouth open, lowering the glass which leaves John with the straw sticking to his lower lip.  His spits it on the side, observing Sherlock who stares into nothingness, blinking very slowly.  His chin is trembling and, when he tries to put the glass back on the bedside table, he drops it on the floor.  Luckily, it's made of plastic and only contained a few drops.  The noise startles John;  he winces, cannot hold back the groan of pain that escapes his throat.
However, his idea is quite brilliant.  John won't deny he had spent some time thinking about Sherlock's experiments and how he would bring the matter of their daughter's safety to him.  There might have been a couple of nightmares involved, one in particular with a premise so ridiculous John wouldn't talk about it for a million pounds.  Let's just say it included a missing infant, a crazy Sherlock and a machine capable of shrinking things.  John doesn't even remember having ever seen the Disney movie.
And as the minutes pass, John has given up the hope help will get to the cottage in time.  It is a waste of his energy.  He prefers to concentrate on Sherlock, and on everything he’s learned about birth -the ones he assisted, the ones he did himself –if only he had more experience in carrier’s labour and delivery. He tells himself it doesn’t matter, a birth is a birth, and the differences at this point are minimal.  Usually, the pushing phase is longer with carriers than women, because of the length of the birth canal and its position, in the shape of a stretched “S” instead of the straighter one women have.  Carriers’skin and tissues around the birth canal do not have the same fragility that women’s do, so this is an advantage : John will not have to worry that much about the skin breaking.
