“I know.” Castiel’s lips pulled into a barely there smile, and then leaned in to kiss him. It was a soft kiss, it wasn’t going anywhere, but it meant something. It lingered, left pieces of each man with the other. “I love you, Dean.”
He took Dean’s hand and led him to the front porch, where they are greeted with doors so large Dean felt compelled to measure them. If he had a measuring tape, he probably would. Castiel sucked in a deep breath, then turned the knob and opened the door.
The heat from Dean’s arm from where the mark was seared into his skin, began to withdraw slightly as he met Cas’ gaze.
Dean popped open the beer and emptied almost half its contents into his mouth before turning to face his brother and leaning against the counter.
“Well he doesn’t really get a say does he?” Dean countered. “Just think about it, alright? The south of France isn’t going anywhere. Let the kid adjust to life without her parents in the slowest way possible. It’ll be better for her in the long run.”
Dean watched his brother throw the frisbee high into the air and followed it over to Clarence who was eagerly jumping into the air to catch it the moment the frisbee left Sam’s hand. The dog wasnt a puppy anymore but he still moved like one, an unyielding source of energetic happiness. Dean called him Ren, and let him sit in his lap when he watched TV at night.  Cas thought it was adorable.
3.) I was super busy publishing and promoting the first book in an lgbtq fantasy series. That's right. I took my frustration with canon destiel and decided to create my own world where the gays would get to be gay and the bis would get to be bi and there would be interesting plot and deep characterization. I created an entire world, people, and I'm damn proud of myself. I am currently in the process of working with my editor to get the second book in the series out by the first quarter of next year. If you're interested, you can message me on Tumblr!
Dean almost shrugged his brother’s hand off, but he didn’t. Instead, he let out a groan and proceeded to whine like a small child. “Sam, why can’t you just leave it alone?”
And now, so did they. The four of them, (Sam would insist it was five- including Clarence), they were a family.
“No, no.” Castiel shakes his head and swats at Dean’s hip. “Your son has staged a nerf gun assault outside your door this morning. I suggest you be clothed when he attacks.”
Michael frowned, but didn’t reply. A snicker came from behind them, where Luke had taken up residence against the bookshelf again. Dean kept looking back towards the ex-con, anticipating some sort of attack. When Gabriel handed Dean his drink, he sucked it down quickly.
Suddenly, all Dean could see was red. He could see the veins pulsing through the skin on the demon’s that held him. He found himself staring at the demon’s neck, mesmorized by the vibrations the flowing blood caused.
This time it wasn’t Dean on his hands and knees, crawling through smoke and batting away falling debris. It was Ash. It was Ash and Kevin. It was Ash, and it was Kevin, and it was Bobby. They’re the ones in the building when it roars like a son-of-bitch. Dean was next to it—he was—but he just got knocked sideways and thrown into the truck. He dropped the girl he was carrying to an ambulance, though, which was a difficult situation to rectify when he was thinking about how many of his friends he may have just lost, but the girl had to come first. So he picked himself off the ground and pretended the hotel didn’t exist long enough to get that girl back in his arms and onto the closest stretcher.
“Okay,” Dean replied, shaking his head. “That’s enough out of you, Bruce Wayne. I’m tryin’ to…you know…do something here.”
There were collective gasps, the loudest coming from Anna, but Dean just laughed. “Alright, then. I guess that’s settled.”
“I’m so sorry, Dean,” Castiel replied, reaching up to stroke his fingers through Dean’s hair. “That must have been so terrible.”
He pushed past his discomfort over being in a teenage girl’s room without permission, and walked to the desk. It was messy, with what looked like school work and a few notes from friends. There were creases all over them, and Dean smiled at the memory of passing notes in the hall in high school. He hated himself for doing it, but Dean opened the drawers of her desk to search for clues. He found what looked like a journal, a pack of highlighters, some pens, a few old chargers, a silver dollar, and a pack of cigarettes with only one left inside. He smirked at the pack and put it back where he found it. The journal however, he took out and placed on the bed beside the duffle bag.
“No, devil woman.” Castiel stood up and began walking towards his darkroom. “They’re of the first day we met.”
Dean continued to kiss Castiel until they were both breathless and obviously wanting more in the moment. Unfortunately, they really didn’t have time for more. The firefighter pulled away from Castiel slowly, gently pecking his lips a few more times as he did.
He stepped forward quickly so that Cas barely had a chance to react. Dean’s hand reached out to cradle the angel’s face as he brought their lips together in a soft kiss.
If everything Cas just said was true, then maybe he wasn't as bad off as he had thought. Despite the incredibly stalker like quality to it, if God felt that Dean was worthy of Castiel’s love, then maybe he really could have it. Maybe he really could let himself be happy, take that proverbial leap of faith.
Dean took that as a good sign and pulled the chair in the corner closer to the bed. He sat down and crossed his leg at his knee. He winced slightly as his bad leg groaned against the position. He adjusted, then looked up to find Alex staring at him again.
They sat down across from each other at the table the hostess showed them to, and Castiel picked up his menu. Dean did the same, but made sweeping, dramatic motions with his face and head as he read, making it look like he was in some kind of silent film from the twenties.
Tonight though, it was Dean’s turn to feel Castiel moving inside of him. His cock stirred at the thought. With great effort, the naked firefighter pulled himself up from the couch and sauntered to his bedroom.
“I could have sworn...” A disappointed look came to his face and his eyes fell to the ground. “My mistake.”
“Well, that's what i figured. That's why i brought a little help.” Crowley’s eyes darkened considerably as the corner of his mouth lifted a fraction of an inch. He moved forward quickly, before Dean had a chance to react. Crowley’s hand was over the mark and his mouth was speaking words Dean couldn't understand.
Castiel shrugged. “I said what I needed to.” He paused, and then shrugged again. “I’d rather sit here with you if that’s alright.” He motioned towards the grass next to Dean.
It was silly, to feel like his heart was going to implode as it beat wildly in his chest. Just a small black cylinder of black and yellow, and Castiel was left relatively speechless.
A shift had occurred, somewhere between Dean’s joke about furries and Castiel’s confirmation that they were, in fact, ‘doing this’, and Dean felt the world tilt on its axis. The seriousness of this step, the undertones of what it meant, it overwhelmed Dean in a wave of emotion.
Castiel thought about that, and couldn’t help but admit to himself that he didn’t want to spend New Year’s alone this year.
This was going to be great. He and Ash had been talking about this meeting for weeks, and he was sure they were  going to blow the investors away. He strutted up to the counter.
Dean was grateful that Jimmy and Gabriel were ride or die when it came to Castiel. He didn’t know if Castiel truly knew how much his brother’s loved him, how much they supported him, until they walked out of the house with him. Jimmy didn’t even need an explanation. That’s what family is supposed to be like. Sammy would have done the same.
“Oh come on,” Gabriel replied, looking over to Dean and giving him a little wink. “Luke isn’t going to kill you. Just torture you.”
It felt like hours had passed while Dean stayed outside growing more and more anxious, but it’d been less than ten minutes since the explosion. Dean gritted his teeth and looked for a viable entry point. Some headway was being made by the right stairwell exit, flames falling back and fading into smoke.
“Okay, okay, I’m leaving. Calm down.” Dean took one step towards the door but then was stopped by the machines by Alex’s bed that began to chime, loud and insistent. Her heart rate was climbing.
When Castiel walked up to his door, having not noticed Dean sitting on the patio furniture behind him, Dean felt his heart do a familiar flip that was a common occurrence whenever Dean was around Castiel. Or thought about Castiel.
Cas watched as Dean looked him up and down for a moment before narrowing his eyes and tilting in head questioningly.
“She’s a good kid, but… yeah. Enter at your own risk, man,” the nurse replied. “Just a friendly warning.”
Dean felt the mark’s power subside instantly and a warmth spread within him. Cas could feel Dean relax considerably at his touch and didn't suppress the soft smile that graced his lips.
“First of all, why would I get mixed up with someone who I know first hand, will get off with the first person who knocks on his door?”
The camera would see two naked bodies in shadow, heads angled so they could stare into each other’s eyes. Their bodies were pressed flush together, and the moon and stars shined behind them. If they stayed perfectly still, the picture would turn out with their bodies in focus and the moon and stars blurred in the background.
Alex nods and turns to start making her way up the eave. Dean follows closely after her, mostly thinking about what he could do to help Alex, but also thinking about what he was going to get at Arby’s.
Dean saw Castiel’s car in the lot, so he was sure he was home, but he didn’t know how long it would be before Castiel heard him. If he would even hear him at all.
“Cas,” he tried for a third time. His words would fail him, he knew this, but he had to try. “I love you so much, you know that right? You know that I’ve never loved anyone the way that I love you… I honestly don’t think it’s possible. This thing between us, it feels like more than that.”
Castiel was quiet for a few moments. Neither continued to eat, and instead just stared at one another while the television from the living room played a re-run of
Dean could hear his heart thumping in his chest as he played the intro, and it wasn’t long before neighbors began to look out their windows and step out onto the patio to watch him.
Forever is also a countdown. It’s New Year’s Eve and kissing like it’s the first time. It’s champagne and resolutions. With ten seconds to midnight, forever is the spark of promise and the ring in Dean’s pocket.
“Eventually, I caught up with him on Antares. I destroyed the star when I sucked the power out of Chuck, but other than that it wasn’t too eventful.” He shrugs. “After that, I went back to Earth and rebuilt it. It took a while. Longer than I thought it would. Humans are particular.”
Dean strummed along the guitar once softly, testing his resolve just as much as the tuning of his guitar.
By the time they made it back to Castiel’s house, Dean felt like he needed to say something. Something to set the record straight, something to clear the air.
Dean grinned. “Just to fuck with him.” He leaned down and pecked Castiel’s cheek. “Finish up here and you can get all sudsy with me.”
Gabriel shook his head. He traveled to the trunk of the rental car and knocked his knuckles against it. Castiel popped the trunk as Gabriel laughed again. “Oh, Cassie. Life has never been easy for you, has it?”
He was happy. I mean, really happy. The mark still buzzed in his ear occasionally but Dean was finding it easier to ignore it and press on, especially with Cas by his side. He was singing in the shower, he didn't complain when Sam brought home rabbit food, he even kept his mouth shut when he found Cas and Sam had brought home a puppy they found stranded in an alley.
Sam shifted uncomfortably in his seat but neither Cas or Dean noticed. Their eyes continued to lock together as their bodies seemed to shake in the vibrations of the moment.
Dean was dumbfounded. He wasn’t put out that Castiel didn’t want to talk about Inias, but he was extremely confused about whatever it was Castiel was holding back. Castiel had said he wasn’t ready to discuss it yet, though, so Dean was going to respect that. Relationships took trust and Dean trusted Castiel to come to him when he was ready.
If presented with the same scenario today, Castiel wouldn’t have made the choice to ambush Dean in the airplane bathroom, but he didn’t regret it either. He was glad to have met Dean, and he’d definitely be lying if he said his heart didn’t stutter in his chest when the receipt slipped from his address book.
“I know.” He paused then let out a small sigh. “Actually, I didn’t know. Not until tonight. Not for sure, at least. I think that’s what’s been holding me back from talking to you about…about this. I don’t want to lose you, Cas.”
Dean felt the heat from Cas’ arm and sucked in a quick breath. He tried to ignore the way his mind wandered to what it would feel like to have Cas touch him, really touch him, and found himself unable to focus on the words Sam began to speak.
After he was through getting his brain sucked out of his dick, Dean watched through lidded, thoroughly satisfied eyes, as Mr. TDB finished himself off. Then, after a quick hand washing session where the stranger continued to look incredibly sexy and smug at the same time, Dean was left alone to clean himself up. Mr. TDB didn’t leave a mess at all, he licked Dean clean when he was finished, but Dean still felt like he should wipe himself up before he pulled up his sticky, coke soaked jeans.
, into Alex’s room. He wasn’t going to, but Bela looked back at him over her shoulder as she entered and the look she gave him implied her request for help. Dean wasn’t sure how much help he could be, he just started breaking through Alex’s hard shell, but he was curious as to how Bela would interact with her niece.
Dean didn't have a chance to fully absorb what had just happened though. He rushed back to Cas’ side who had fallen to the floor with a hand over his bleeding neck.
Castiel let out a soft laugh. Dean’s excitement to affirm his feelings for him was extremely cute. Castiel didn’t dwell on his mind’s procurement of the adjective ‘cute’. Instead, Castiel pressed his lips against Dean’s again, this time both of their smiles prevented the kiss from becoming too heated. They pecked at each other’s lips, laughing as Castiel moved to straddle Dean’s lap. They cradled each other’s faces as they continued to kiss, the kisses turning less excited and playful and more heated and sensual. Castiel pulled away after a moment and looked down into Dean’s eyes.
Ben frowned at not getting an answer from his uncle, but as it was a common occurrence, he let it go.
. The flooring was from the early 1990’s when everyone decided light blue made for the best color carpet. It was faded in a number of places, where the light from the large windows shined in. The bay window in the middle had one large crack down the middle and mold growing around it.
Only, when Dean told Castiel that he had to go, the morning they woke up in each others arms in the back seat of his car, Castiel kind of shut down. He smiled and joked some while they got dressed and back on the road, but there was a clear difference.
“There ya go. I roasted the potatoes with rosemary. I thought it would be a nice combo with the mustard dressing but I think it clashes a bit. What do you think?”
It felt good to get that out, but Dean was left with a very confused looking flight attendant. Also, he just embarrassed the shit out of himself by unloading on her like that.
“I’ll see you later, Miss Alex,” Gabriel told her with a wave. “I’ll be expecting a rematch you know.”
“Let’s not turn this into some sort of Novak family moment,” the man in the chair said. “Try to reign yourself in, little brother.”
It was nights like that, where he didn’t fight any fires and barely saved any lives, that Dean really hated his job. A few weeks ago, Dean would have been too afraid to talk to Castiel about it, but now things were different.
“It’s more fun if there are more than two players,” Castiel said as he sat down. “Maybe you can convince a nurse or two to join.”
Castiel smirked down at Dean, and then took his hand off his cock and placed both of them on either side of Dean’s hips. He angled himself down slightly, so he could drag his penis across the crest of Dean’s ass, dipping between his cheeks and sliding back and forth a few times. With the aid of the massage oil, the feeling was indescribable.
Dean let out a loud breath, and then sucked in back in. With his next exhale, he blurted, “I’ve been coming to the cemetery to talk to Inias.”
Castiel stiffens and his voice is suddenly carefully controlled. “I know that, Dean. I don’t expect anything from you.” He starts to pull away, but Dean clings to him. He pulls him back in and presses his forehead against his angel’s.
Trying not to let his concern taint his visit with his parents, when Dean finally sat in front of his parents' graves, he delved into a long-winded ramble about Alex. He planned to visit her after his shift tomorrow and hoped that maybe they’d do better than last time. Sure, Alex opened up and really allowed herself to feel her pain, but Dean didn’t want the kid to constantly suffer.
“Sorry, kid. Thought you might be sleeping.” He stepped around the corner and moved closer to the center of the room.
“FreshenUpYourBaby.com?”  Castiel read, one eyebrow raised. “You’re selling car air fresheners online?”
Cas let out another moan, which elicited a mimicking groan from Dean who grinded himself down into Castiel’s hardness. Cas bucked his hips up to gain more friction and Dean was momentarily blind as he fumbled with Cas’ shirt buttons. He needed to feel him, skin to skin, nothing between them. As Cas continued to move his hips eagerly against Dean’s, Dean couldn't think straight enough to be bothered with the buttons anymore and he propped himself up enough to get both hands on the edges of Cas’ shirt and torn it open, popping buttons along the way.
“It was just a hard day Cas.” He turned to the doctor, who placed both water glasses on the counter and faced Dean head on. “To be honest, I don’t really want to talk about it. That okay?” Dean asked earnestly, gently. He didn’t want to rock the boat here, not when things were going so well between them.
They’re standing next to the map table at the bunker, and Dean’s still holding Castiel’s hand. His mind has adjusted to reality—to being in a place that lets him feel however he wants to feel. He doesn’t know exactly what that is right now, but that’s okay. He’ll get there on his own. In this moment, Dean’s just going to do what feels right.
Dean stood up too and the two of them just stared at each other for a long moment, under the soft orange glow of a nearby street lamp.
“Well,” Dean started. “I guess I’m…there’s this thing.” He looked down at their hands and smiled bittersweetly. “It’s Inias.”
Castiel smiled and put the camera back down in the box. He saw something else that caught his eye and pulled it out.
Dean sighed. “Listen, I’m not sure what’s going to happen. All I know is right now, you really need to get back to the hospital and get checked out. Once we’re there, we’ll figure out what comes next, okay?”
“Alright then,” Dean sighed. “I guess we found our place. I don’t think we’ll be able to move in right away though. I refuse to sleep here until whatever’s living under the front porch is removed.”
“Not to me little brother.” Dean said, eyes on the two men who just emerged from the beat up civic. The driver was a tall blonde, thinly built wearing a black t-shirt and dark jeans. The other guy had short dark hair that looked like it had never seen a brush.
When he was finished with both sides of the conversation, Charlie smiled sweetly at him. The picture of innocence.
2.) I got sick. Like...really sick. My neurologist isn't positive, because it can be very tricky, but we think I have either advanced Lyme disease or the beginnings of Multiple Sclerosis. Major bummer. Only time will tell there.
“I think that's incredibly inaccurate Dean. If you insist that you will not accept my Grace, then you will absolutely need to accept my love.”
He followed Castiel out of the library, smiling proudly until he caught Luke’s gaze. The eldest Novak brother stared back at Dean with something akin to fury, but the expression was so subtle, so understated, it took Dean a second to recognize it. When he did, Dean felt a shiver run down his spine.
“Okay,” Sam said carefully, then placed the knife he was using to chop lettuce down on the counter and turned to face Dean. “And where does Cas fit into this?”
“Yeah.” Dean said, pulling open another drawer and then the cabinet above it, apparently looking for something.
“Don’t you need an official document to report that?” Dean replied back easily. “Could be a good way to get your name.”
Dean’s mouth had gone completely dry listening to Castiel explain himself and couldn't help but lick his lips as he parted his mouth to speak, a motion Cas’ eyes flitted to instantly and lingered there until Dean spoke.
“I don’t know how not to, Cas,” Dean responded. “You lost the love of your life. If you lose the next guy too-“
Dean didn’t see how that was possible, but then he realized what Castiel planned to do and began to turn over in earnest. Castiel removed his fingers just to plunge them back inside once Dean was on his stomach. A moment later and Castiel was pressing his mouth to Dean’s ass cheeks, working towards the center, kissing, licking and biting. The hand not attached to the fingers currently in Dean’s ass massaged and kneaded, grabbing roughly before soothing again. And then Dean was being spread apart, and Castiel’s tongue flicked around the fingers scissoring inside of him.
“Dean is getting some test results back today, and he was hoping I would go with him. You know, for moral support.”
“Don’t worry about that right now, sweetheart,” Donna responded. “Just concentrate on your breathing.”
“I should probably get some booster shots when I get back,” Dean mumbles to himself, but its barely a thought at all because his mind is just chaos, chaos suffocating in the warm blanket this place keeps wrapping him in. He rubs his hands over his face and tries to focus. He hopes Sam is already with Eileen; he hopes they’re sharing the first moments of their eternity together. He can’t imagine what it feels like for his brother. He must miss his wife…whatever her name was, Dean didn’t catch it actually, but he knows Sam loved her. Fake reality or not, Sam had a whole life without Dean and without Eileen and he wouldn’t be surprised if Sam has a hard time adjusting to his new reality.
Castiel didn’t like seeing Dean this way, but he also understood where the man was coming from. A relationship that he invested time and energy into, had turned out not to be what Dean thought it was. That really messes with you.
“Mhmm,” Castiel answered against Dean’s neck. He kissed a line up Dean’s neck to his ear. The doctor’s breath tickled Dean’s ear as he whispered into it. “Any suggestions on how I should show my gratitude?”
“You don't have to let it take you Dean. You don't even have to fight it anymore because we can get rid of it. I can cure you.” Cas kept moving towards Dean, not stopping until he was standing right in front of him.
“Cas, I’m ready. Come on,” Dean said as he caught his breath. He reached for the lube and put another generous slather on Castiel’s cock just as Castiel pulled his fingers out. Dean lined himself up and teased the tip of Castiel’s cock with his hole. The doctor shivered beneath him, biting his lip and bucking his hips up in search of what he wanted. “Now who’s impatient?” Dean replied, smirking as he brushed his hole up against Castiel’s tip again.
“In a place? An extra bedroom for visitors. Two bathrooms. A porch or deck or something to sit outside…” He trailed off again and then shrugged. “Nothing fancy.”
Castiel didn’t give him the chance though, because he closed the distance between them before Dean could even react.
“Hey babe,” Dean said, stepping back to let Castiel inside. Castiel leaned in to peck the firefighter’s lips as he passed him, but stopped when he got a good look at Dean’s face. Dean smiled wider. “Dinner’s almost ready. Just gotta put everything-“
“Hold on a sec,” Dean called. He put the remaining pumpkins on the table before opening the door and immediately inhaling more pot smoke than he had in all his college years. “Oh, wow, hey dude.” Dean tried to cover his reaction, but couldn’t help a few subtle coughs. “Um, you’re the DJ?”
Charles smirked, then hid behind his medical journal. Castiel felt confused by his father’s behavior, but then again, he never really knew the man. Castiel didn’t know what to expect of him.
Castiel had a piece of toast half way to his mouth but paused before he could take a bite. His eyes widened as they swept over Dean’s face, looking for signs of humor. When he found none, Castiel slowly placed his toast back on his plate.
“Okay well, we should be going.” Castiel said, pulling Dean backwards down the sidewalk. “His appointment is in a few minutes.”
“Hey.” Castiel’s voice came over the line and Dean felt a piece of him settle. “Are you still in New York?”
“That’s just cosmetic,” Castiel replied quickly. “Think about what’s really here. Three bedrooms, large open floor plan, no stairs, huge windows that let in a lot of natural light, a large backyard-“
“And who’s that?” Dean asked. Alex said nothing, so Dean let the moment breathe for a little while. Eventually, Alex looked back up and over her shoulder at Dean.
They hadn't slept together yet, Dean wasn't sure it was something Cas wanted since he had never tried to go further than the heavy make-out sessions they increasingly found themselves in. The one time they ended up horizontal, Sam had called needing help with a case and they had to stop just as Dean was pretty sure Cas was about to reach for Dean’s dick.
Charlie was quiet for a little while, looking down at her abandoned lunch for a few moments before looking back up at Dean tentatively. “Why don’t you want to tell Cas?”
“It’s been disconnected.” Castiel said, his own phone in his hand. He had a death grip on it while he paced his living room. “I don’t have-”
“She’s pulling through. The poor thing is going to need physical therapy for the better part of her adolescence, but we think she’ll keep her arm. She’s sulking right now, so it may not be the best time for a visit.”
They were alone on the platform, so Dean approached Mr. TDB just as the stranger rolled his eyes at Dean’s presence.
He tried broaching the topic with Bobby, just a casual, ‘Hey man, you ever…you know…have trouble with the job?’ In response, Bobby stared at him for much too long, his hands on his hips and his jaw clenched. Right before Dean was about to tell him to forget about it, Bobby let out a loud breath of annoyance and replied, “Of fucking course you, idjit. You think I ain’t never felt it before? We all feel it, Dean. It’s not about
It was then that Castiel realized he wasn’t leaving his family behind on Thanksgiving. His true family was coming with him.
Cas sat next to him on the beach, their chairs low to the sand, their toes finding comfort in the cool textures underneath the grains. Dean loved the feel of sand slipping effortlessly between his toes.
Sam led the way towards the table they had sat around just days before, bringing another chair from the corner to join the three already stationed around the table.
“Of course,” He smiled ruefully. “I don’t always like to talk about bad days at the hospital either. “ He stepped closer and placed his forearms on Dean’s shoulders. “I just hope you know you can talk to me. When you want.”
Alex’s neighborhood was nice, not as nice as Castiel’s parents’, but nice. Kevin McCallister nice, Dean thought, and smiled despite his concern. The lawns were perfectly manicured, fallen leaves raked clean and frigid air making the grass crisp. Some houses already have wreaths and bows on their doors.
“No, Dean, I don’t think you do,” Castiel said quietly. He squeezed Dean’s hands and leaned down to catch Dean’s gaze. Dean hadn’t realized he’d been looking down at the floor. “Inias and I were compatible, but you and I? Dean, I don’t think there’s a word for what we are.”
The stranger’s lips were curled into a grin. He only waited another beat before joining Dean in his conversation with himself.
“Sure, we’ll see you later sweetheart.” The woman called after him as Castiel smiled and waved, leading Dean away.
“Thank you for your reading mother. It was the reminder I needed. Not that I am an abomination, of course, because I have no intention of living my life based on a book written by a handful of fallible men with dubious intentions. Your book holds no true value, as it is only used as a way to control people. I will not be controlled by your God, and I will not be controlled by you.” Castiel stood up and Dean joined him instantly. “It was a mistake to come here. I regret believing I had to endure this. I don’t. Unlike my sexuality, coming here was a choice. A choice I will never make again.”
“You know, I grew out of Sammy about a decade ago.” Sam said, walking back over to the drivers side of John Winchesters car.
“Yeah, yeah, yeah. I know.” Oliver answered him, not taking his eyes off of Dean. “Looking to contact Collette?” He formed his statement as a question even though he knew the answer. Oliver looked over to Sam. “And I’m guessing if i refuse i will see a very violent exchange in your mind.”
“Well, not to be the callous subject changer or anything,” Jo interjected, “but are you and Cas ready to party tomorrow night?”
“Information Castiel, information is power. You are convinced I have something you want. I have no interest in living a human life without some rewards for helping you here.”
Meg and Alfie had gotten married in Vegas seven months ago. The result of that union was currently incubating in Meg’s uterus.
Dean was about to complain about the lack of dick on his ass, but refrained. Instead, he began stroking Castiel’s calf with his fingertips again.
“I'm not lying!” Metatron gasped out, his ability to take in air constricted by Castiel’s assault. “But there is something else!”
“A new reality?” Dean whispers, his eyes on the country road he’s been driving for decades. Happily. He’s been driving his Baby for years because he’s in Heaven and he’s happy here. He has everyt— “Mother fucker.”
Castiel’s eyes fluttered shut as Dean moved over him, dipped his head pressed a kiss to the bolt of Castiel’s jaw. “
“Um, blue?” Dean answered. Castiel could hear his friend’s apologetic smile through the phone. “Is that okay?”
“It’s not so bad,” Castiel informed him. “I’ll be right back.” Dean nodded and Castiel left him on the counter to retrieve the first aid kit from the bathroom. When he returned, he nearly bumped into the firefighter in the hallway. “What are you doing?”
Dean looked over to his angel, something he still thought of him as even though Cas was mostly human. Cas had kept enough grace to heal himself, as well as keep some of his more interesting characteristics. He still always knew when Dean needed him, claiming he could no longer hear his prayers, but still felt his longing nonetheless. His wounds also healed faster than a fully human’s would, but he was no longer virtually indestructible. This had made Dean very nervous and had made it his mission to train Cas in combat. With out his angel strength, Dean worried about Cas incessantly, something that irked the ex-angel to no end. He agreed to the training sessions but they found it incredibly difficult to keep their hands off each other long enough to train properly. Sam took over Cas’ training.
Dean gave him a confused sort of smile. A smile that told Castiel that he was being unreasonable, which Castiel didn’t really need to be told.
Jack looks down at the road. “He thought it’d be best for me to come and see you. He didn’t know if he’d be able to leave you here if you’d decided to stay.”
“You know what Balthazar? Fuck you.” He began to walk towards the double doors of the airport’s entrance, a place Dean should have definitely been heading as well, instead of gawking at the scene these two had caused.
“Okay Dean. Sorry.” Sam said softly before absorbing the push of Dean’s shoulder into his side as his brother moved past him and out of the room.
They stopped at a gas station about two hours into their trip. Dean filled up the tank and Castiel bought snacks and booze inside the convenience store.
“Your favorite.” Dean nodded. “Just have to add some salt and then it’s ready.” Dean reached for the container of salt in the cabinet above him. “I may have some leftover meatloaf in the fridge. Not exactly what I was going for but- shit!”
is that whenever you’ve got something going on, you bottle it up until it basically vomits out of you. Avoiding actual vomit is a daily priority for me now.”
He called everyone he could think of that might not mind his company for the evening. Which included the one night stand he had the night before he met Michael and the barista down the street that flirted with him a couple times and left his number on his cup once. He even called the only person he ever engaged in the “friends with benefits” type of relationship, but everyone either already had plans for the night or didn’t even remember who he was.
Dean sighed as he rolled his eyes and turned his attention towards the backyard. He and Cas had been back there just the weekend before, helping Sam put in a vegetable garden because Eileen wanted to have fresh vegetables during the rest of her pregnancy. She planned to make the babies’ food from the garden too. Dean remembered the light in Castiel’s eyes as he discussed Eileen’s plans with her. The doctor looked absolutely gorgeous under the late afternoon sun, sweat glistening at his temples, his smile wide and completely genuine. Dean didn’t ever want that smile to go away. He wanted it every day for the rest of his life.
“Alright then, have a good night.” Castiel ended the call and placed his phone back in his pocket. He spoke quietly as he stepped closer to Dean. His movements resembled that of someone approaching a wild animal. “Mrs. Rachenfield’s son was moving her couch. He accidently dropped it. Everything’s fine.”
Naomi finally came around to tolerating, but not accepting, Castiel’s sexuality around the time the doctor met Inias. They were getting serious quickly, and Gabriel told his parents about how happy Castiel was. They insisted on meeting him, and Castiel complied.
Castiel stared at his brother for a long moment, obviously trying to figure out what Gabriel was getting at. When he reached for his bag, Gabriel refused to give it to him. Dean couldn’t be sure, but it looked like Gabriel’s smile had turn sympathetic.
He was standing at the counter when Dean entered the gallery. He was wearing kakis and a blue polo, which wasn’t exactly Castiel’s style but Dean was too distracted to notice.
Dean continued to stare off into the void for another moment before blinking rapidly and narrowing his eyes at Sam.
Something in Cas broke in that moment. His patience, his unrelenting understanding and compassion- all of it came crashing down at the bitter notes in his friends voice.
Dean sighed and stayed silent for a moment. After his talk with Charlie the day before, Dean was sure that he had things figured out. His friend was probably right, all his struggles had to come down to Castiel, and if Dean just talked to him, they could figure things out together. However, when Castiel canceled their dinner the night before because he had to stay at work late, Dean began to rethink things. Maybe he was being selfish. Maybe Dean should think about giving up his job and pursuing other interests. He didn’t think Castiel would ever ask him to, but Dean knew the doctor would be happy if Dean retired from firefighting and switched careers. He imagined himself bringing this problem to his parents for real, wondering what they would say and how they would contribute to the headache he would have undoubtedly already had.
“No, I know,” Dean insisted, but that wasn’t really true. He hadn’t really thought about the other reasons before. It’s not like he had the death wish Castiel claimed he did, but Dean was bred on sacrifice and it was just in his bones now.
The older Novak brother’s smile turned wolfish as he winked at Dean again. “Not yet.” He then turned to Castiel. “Come on, Cassie. You’ve got to get this part over with eventually. Jimmy will be here soon, and then we can all pretend that the rest of our family doesn’t exist.”
Startled, Dean stepped back from the wall of Castiel’s pictures and turned to the woman. She was the kind of beautiful that made people blush just by looking at her, and Dean did.
Castiel felt Dean shift nervously beside him. His voice felt fathoms deeper as the firefighter answered. “Uh, about six months Ma’am.”
Dean smiled and nodded his agreement. “Well, you got me there.” He placed his hand on the girl’s good arm as they raised the stretcher to begin rolling it towards the ambulance. “You’re not dying though, kid. You lost a lot of blood but your vitals are pretty good.”
“Oh,” Dean replied, trying to shake off the knowledge that Castiel’s family hires people to do their domestic work. “It’s really nice to meet you, Roberto.”
Dean thought about that for a moment, Cas’ wavering voice giving him the courage to meet those gorgeous blue eyes again.
Donna never ordered Dean around like that, so his expression must have warranted it. He nodded vaguely and allowed himself to be corralled toward the truck. Time was, he would have spun around and Hulked his way through the flames, but something in him was holding him back.
Then he secured his gear again and ran toward the building, shouting stuff he couldn’t even understand. Other people were shouting, crying, screaming in pain. There weren’t any screams for help anymore. The building was silent except for the roar of the flames as Dean tried to find a point of entry.
“Come on now, baby.” The blonde said, his voice heavily accented. “This is fun, but the band has to come first.”
“I believe I told you my name was Bela,” the woman answered with a grin. “But I guess that will do.”
He held Oliver’s hard gaze for another moment before turning sharply and walking out the front door, leaving the door wide open.
“I think Clarence could use a bath.” Sam announced as he watched the dog eagerly gobble up the last traces of food in its dish. He picked him up and set off to the bathroom.
When both of their shoulders were wet with the other’s tears, they pulled away but didn't go far. Dean held on to Castiel’s arm as Castiel slipped their other hands together. Just because Dean was mad didn’t mean he didn’t need Castiel’s hands on him. Dean was exhausted, emotionally and physically, and Castiel was his person—no matter how angry Dean was.
He hadn't told Cas he loved him. There was just something in him that couldn't go there yet. Part of him feared that if he let himself say it, if he finally came out with it, then he would be opening himself up to a world of pain when it all came crashing down. Taking this step with Cas, making their relationship cross that bridge beyond friendship, it was really hard for Dean. The actual process of it was amazing of course, but the worry and fear behind it still pulled at him. If he added a big emotional declaration on top of that, Dean didn't know how he would ever piece himself back together if it all fell apart.
Thank you so much for those who have clung on and have asked for updates. I have some stress to relieve when it comes to writing, as I am editing book two and that can just be a bitch and a half, so I think I'll find solace in picking up this verse again.
Whatever Castiel thought Dean was going to say, that certainly wasn’t it. His eyes widened, his jaw dropped slightly. His shock continued into the silence. It was the kind of silence Dean hated, the kind of silence that only ended when someone either started yelling or left. Dean was ready to start apologizing, not sure where Castiel stood on the whole, going behind his back and forming attachments to his dead fiancé’s grave, but he didn’t know where to start.
“I want a family, Cas,” Dean said as he lifted his leg up wrapped it around Castiel’s waist. “Cas,” Dean whispered, kissed his bottom lip and shifted to roll on top of him. “I want us to have a family.”
“No.” Dean shook his head and picked up his small amp. “I’m glad I won’t be an old man wondering...but uh, I should just go.”
“What? The epic cock-block that is Mrs. Rachenfield?” Dead tried to tease. He hoped his voice didn’t sound as strained to Castiel as it did to his own ears. “It wouldn’t be the first time she broke up a good thing.”
“Yeah, probably.” Dean sighed. “But what’s the point? I don’t have anything figured out. I gotta get my crap together before I can start anything real with Cas. My life...it’s gotta be a litte less full of shit.”
“I know sugar, pipe down.” Meg took in a deep breath. “Okay, so you have their number? If you call information, they might give you their address.”
“I don’t think we’ll be making it to your bedroom tonight either.” Dean closed his eyes and let out another soft moan as Castiel kissed his lips softly. “At least for round one.”
“Oh, we’ll pay him alright,” Castiel replied, his tone mischievous. Dean whipped around, his jaw dropping.
“Hello, Dean. Thank you ever so much for your help.” She batted her eyelashes at him in a way that Dean felt pretty sure she had never done before in her life. She looked like she was having a seizure.
He wondered about Alex, and how she’d spend her Thanksgiving. The only family the social worker had found was an estranged aunt with a record. They had tracked the aunt to this area a few times, even recently, but hadn’t been able to find her yet.
And so they drive. They drive through the night and into the next morning. They don’t get tired and they don’t need to sleep. Or eat. Dean thinks maybe that’s strange. He remembers pie and burgers, beer and whiskey, but he doesn’t crave them. He’s good. He’s got everything he needs right here.
Dean’s eyes traveled to the angel’s hand on his shoulder, meer inches away from the place he marked him the first time Cas touched Dean.
“Sam, what the hell are you even talking about? I’ve got a plan.” Dean loads the ammunition into his gun. “Cas, where’s the first blade?”
Castiel came to stand beside him. “Maybe she was packing a bag before she and her parents got in the accident.”
“- for us to transform into a great space,” Castiel said with confidence. “It would take a lot of work, but…” Castiel turned around the faced the house. “I think it could be great.”
“Break-up...or break. I don’t actually know...she didn’t specify.” Dean didn’t look at Castiel as he said this. It felt kind of weird talking about his current romantic relationship with someone he had definite romantic vibes with, but Dean kept going because Castiel was also his friend. “She said I was never around, that I worked too much.”
“Could be better,” Dean replied, once he caught his breath. He winked down at the Doctor when Castiel looked up at him. The fire in Castiel’s eyes ignited with that, and suddenly Dean’s cock was halfway down Castiel’s throat, leaving the firefighter to shout out his pleasure as he gripped the sheets around him.
The truth was, Dean was terrified of opening himself up to Castiel completely, just to have Castiel focus on the details of his job rather than the emotional trauma Dean seemed to be undergoing. He wanted Castiel to support him, support his job. He also didn’t want to do anything to upset Castiel or make him question his decision to be with Dean.
It seemed awkward to just stand next to him while they waited for their bags, and not say anything, so Dean cleared his throat quietly and turned slightly towards the stranger.
He could have easily looked at the GPS map that’s currently navigating them to Alex’s house, but he preferred to cross his arms over his chest and sulk.
Dean looked up to Cas as he pulled his pants down, freeing his already wet member, and  sliding them from his legs to the floor.
ago, Cas,” Dead argued with a content sigh. “I’m back in working order.” Dean heard Castiel mumble, ‘
“Well,” Bela replied. “It’s pretty obvious, even to a complete stranger like me, that you two are gaga for each other. It’s only natural to assume you’ll get hitched.”
Which brought Dean back under his parents roof, leaving him to stare up at his water stained, childhood bedroom ceiling and contemplating where everything went wrong.
Castiel remembered this scene being played from opposite positions not too long ago. He threw punches down to Dean and mangled his face without a hint of compassion. Cas continued to attack, continued to abuse, until something broke though. Something pulled him back to himself.
He didn’t have to wait long before Dean was crowding him back against the wall, lining up their groins so Castiel could feel the affect he was having on Dean. Castiel moaned into Dean’s mouth when Dean finally brought their lips together. Castiel kissed him back, opening his mouth to Dean before moving his lips down and sucking a mark into his neck. He rolled his hipe while Dean palmed Castiel’s ass, which elicited another gasp from him.
Jimmy and his family went right back out the front door, with Gabriel, Castiel, and Dean trailing closely behind.
Reaching into the bedside table, Dean grabbed the lube and threw it down towards Castiel’s hands, just as Castiel licked a long stripe up Dean’s cock.
As he made it towards the kitchen, Castiel found the noises to be made by a catering company, setting up food in the Winchester’s dining room.
“Damnit Castiel, I don't have the answer you’re looking for okay? Its a curse, yes. Most curses can be lifted, okay? Do i know how to lift this one? No.”
Castiel moved quickly between Dean and Gabriel and reached a hand out to stop Jo, who was suddenly ready to pounce as well. He didn’t know why his body put him in the position of protecting his asshole of a brother. Instinct, perhaps. Years of doing exactly that in the hallways of schools and the alleyways of bars. When Dean’s face contorted in confusion at Castiel’s choice to save Gabriel from the firefighter’s wrath, Castiel snapped out of it.
His hands were overflowing with junk food and two bottles of wine as he exited, and Dean was pretty sure it was the funniest thing he had ever seen. Castiel proceeded to throw a bag of cheetos at him while Dean finished topping off his baby.
Sam whipped his head around to face the angel and then turned back to the books in front of him. He let out another deep breath before answering. “Nope.”
Castiel kept his eyes on Dean, who looked nothing like his old self when he showed up on Castiel’s doorstep. Where Castiel remembered Dean’s eyes being bright and cheerful and his smile genuine and unhindered, now he saw dullness in the man’s green eyes and not even a hint of the smile Castiel knew Dean was capable of.
Dean’s voice broke and Castiel pulled back just enough to look into Dean’s eyes. “You thought if you sacrificed yourself, you’d earn your mother’s forgiveness.” Tears rolled down Dean’s face as he nodded. “Oh, sweetheart,” Castiel whispered. “There was nothing to forgive, you have to know that.” He cradled Dean’s face and kissed his tears. “Your sacrifice would be a tragedy.”
Bela crossed her arms over her chest and regarded Alex’s tantrum ambivalently. “I’m not singing to the heavens over here either, dear. But we’re stuck with each other. So you either put your big girl panties on, or I decorate your bedroom in Backstreet Boys posters.”
“Uh, don’t take this the wrong way, Buddy, but you’re sort of creeping me out,” Dean says. His hands squeeze tighter around the steering wheel. His knuckles are white, his fingers ache.
“The last time she visited my parents, she stole all of my dead grandma’s jewelry and wiped out my parents’ savings for my college fund,” Alex spit. “She’s a thief and a complete bit-“
There were loud noises coming from the garbage truck down the street, and Dean could hear them clearly through the open window. The same open window where he snuck in the girl he lost his virginity to.
He tried to run, but a plate full of crab cakes stopped him, as well as the large man holding them. All three went sprawling to the ground and the room turned into chaos.
This is what love feels like, he thought. He knew he loved Castiel, he knew he’d been in love with him for nearly as long as he’d known him, but
Castiel smiled as he pulled on a pair of sweatpants and a t-shirt. “Ah, yes. And then Meg thought it’d be a great idea to give them and her kids silly string to ‘decorate’ the toilet paper.”
Naomi opened her bible and began flipping pages. Castiel had a feeling what would come next. He grabbed Dean’s hand and apologized with his eyes. When Naomi opened her mouth, it was to utter the two biblical passages Castiel wrote over and over as a child, hoping it would cure him of his ‘affliction.’
Dean didn’t know what to do. He’d obviously said the wrong thing but he didn’t know what it was. Was he never supposed to bring up Inias again? If so, telling Castiel that he had been visiting his grave wouldn’t go well. “Cas-“
“I know you wanted Alex to come live with us,” Castiel said carefully. “But I think it’s better this way. I don’t…I don’t know that becoming parents before we’re even… well. It just seemed like a big step for something so important.”
Dean shuffled his feet slightly as he watched the mind reader set up his stuff for the seance and found himself looking to Cas in a moment of weakness.
“What if we hit it off? Become a thing or something?” Dean replied, moving around a couple with a stroller.
Sam looked to Dean and Cas for a moment before realizing what Oliver was trying to imply and he cleared his throat loudly.
“Actually, yes. I do have an idea of what we could do.” He took a deep breath, looking down at the discarded medical journal for just a moment before gearing up to tell Dean whatever it was he had on his mind. Dean couldn’t help the bundle of nerves that were collecting in his stomach.
When he spotted him, Castiel choked on his inhale and coughed while Dean sauntered up confidently to him. He liked the way Castiel’s eyes lingered on him, even as he coughed.
“You are operating under the assumption that you mean less to me than Inias did,” Castiel said firmly. “Please don’t.”
Dean winced at the nickname, knowing how Alex would hate to hear it. “Well, I told her I’d come and see her tomorrow. Maybe her doctor will update me.”
Dean balked. “No offense Cas, but I’ve never seen you drive and I don’t really want to start now, while we are riding in my baby.”
Castiel made the decision for him when he squeezed Dean’s hand once, and then let it go. “Meet back at the car?”
die, Cas, and this is the life I chose. I chose to become a firefighter. Maybe I did it for some fucked up reasons, but I’m here now and I’m not just gonna—“
The ones he expected to be there, were there (including the ones of Castiel’s ass), but there were quite a few Castiel wasn’t aware of.
“And how exactly does Cas plan to do that. I’m guessing Collette has long since moved on. Not going to exactly be waiting for us to call on her on the other side.”
“It’s just, I’m not the same guy I was three years ago. I mean, I am, but it’s not the same situation.” Castiel started to ramble.
Anna smiled instantly and pulled Dean into a hug. “I’m so glad to finally meet you, Dean. Cas just doesn’t shut up about you when he calls to check in.” She squeezed him tighter, and then whispered. “Please don’t hold us against him.” Dean liked her immediately. He hugged her back and nodded. “It’s good to meet you too.” When she pulled back, he gave her a wink. “I’ve heard a lot about all of you too.”
Dean leaned back in after rolling his eyes and pecked Castiel’s lips softly, before pulling away again. The look in Dean’s eyes made Castiel want to throw away all of the rules and just get down on one knee, right then and there. The thought, as ridiculous as it was, gave Castiel a different idea.
Dean bit into his burger and hummed his satisfaction. “Okay, cool. Cas has off that day so he can help out too. We still haven’t figured out what we are going to wear but-” Charlie’s eyes lit up suddenly.
He quickly turned around to face his brother, who was still sitting on top of his stereo equipment and looking like he didn’t have a care in the world. Castiel reached up, grabbed Gabriel by the ear, and pulled him off his ass and onto his feet.
The hunter could barely see the angel clearly. His body was a fragmented mess. One moment Cas would be there standing in front of him, the next it would be in pieces strewn across the room. Then it would be dripping with blood from multiple stab wounds, then his neck would be nearly torn away as his crystal blue eyes bulged out of his head.
He lunged across the table, leaving his finished meal for Sam to clean up, and grabbed his nephew. He tackled him to the floor and tickled him until the little boy threatened to pee his pants.
“Oh yeah, sure,” Sam teased. “Because meeting your boyfriend’s family for the first time is always smooth sailing.”
“Hey!” Sam could hear Metatron’s voice yelling from inside before the doors shut. “What about our deal?”
The train began to slow, and the gorgeous blue eyed stranger looked behind himself at the sign on the subway station wall.
“Dying?” Sam finished again, eyebrow raised. “Dean, Cas isn’t the only reason you should be worried about that.”
“Cas, I’ll be fine.” He could feel the mark burning into his skin, making his blood pulse with the thrill of the upcoming fight.
After he finished paying for his lunch, Dean weaved his way back through the lunch crowd and say across the table from Charlie.
“Are you feeling okay?” Castiel tried again. “You can sit down over there and wait, if you’d like. I’ll get your bag for you.”
“Listen, you’ve got my number and I’ve got yours. Let’s just keep in touch, alright? Let me know how your meeting in New York goes.”
The photo was of two figures, cast in shadows. Their bodies were close, their arms wrapped around each other. The background was full of stars and the brightest, fullest moon Dean had ever seen. The night’s sky was blurred, while the couple was in perfect focus.
Later that night, with their muscles sore from swimming at the Y and their minds fried from staring at house after house on Zillow, Castiel and Dean slipped into the master bathroom’s garden tub
“Don’t worry.” Castiel said with a pat to Dean’s arm, as Dean pulled the car into an open parking spot. “Just be yourself.”
“Well it’s either me or a home,” Bela answered casually. She walked closer to the bed but stopped just short of it. She looked back at Dean. “Unless Batman here has another suggestion. What are you doing here, anyway?”
Dean’s heart broke a little at the admission, but he understood where Castiel was coming from—especially with what Castiel went through when he lost Inias.
Dean heard Oliver sigh in annoyance and he tried to bring his thoughts back to the conversation at hand.
“I know, but with the holiday there are less people around and if they need me, I can’t exactly say no, babe.”
“Yeah.” Dean nodded. “I loved it too, I mean I’ve always loved working on cars but I didn’t realize how much I’d love restoring one like this. It was awesome.”
He caught a very impressive street performance outside of an art gallery, and gave the girl the only cash he had on him.
He doesn’t sound confident. Dean understands. Thinking works differently up here. It’s hard to know what you want when everything you’ve ever wanted is right in front of you. Dean’s jaw tightens as he takes in a big breath.
“I really wish you’d let me take a picture,” Dean said quietly, walking over to stand next to the bed. His fingers traced down Castiel’s stomach. “I’m going to want this memory for the rest of my life.” Instantly, Dean worried he’d said something far more intense and complicated than what he really meant, but Castiel only smiled. He reached for Dean’s hand using the hand not currently stroking his cock and rubbed the back of it with his thumb.
Then he just started talking, as if the flight attendant had any interest in his current predicament.
“You’re going to do great,” Sam insisted. “It’s normal to be nervous, but man. You’re awesome. Cas loves you. It’ll be fine.”
Of course Michael would have a date a week after they broke up. Of course it would be someone gorgeous.
“Dean.” Cas was standing next to him. There was so much concern in his eyes Dean had to look away to keep himself from pulling him into a gentle kiss.
“What? Charlie, PTSD? You’re joking.” He tried to sound confused, but he knew he just sounded scared.
Dean paused and contemplated Ben for a long moment. How much do you tell a kid about sex? How much had Sam already told him?
When Cas opened his mouth to speak again, Dean found himself looking to his lips, absorbing the way they pressed together and the curve of his lower lip. His stomach flipped at the brief thought of what it would feel like to bring that lip between his own.
Dean could tell that there was less blood pooling around his fingers and he hesitantly pulled his hand back from the Cas’ wound. The cut was still deep and red but blood was clotting around it.
They stopped driving when the moon was high in the sky and pulled over at a rest stop that had a National Park entrance.
“I said no,” Castiel interjected. He pulled his overnight bag from the backseat and began walking toward Dean’s apartment. “Neither Dean nor I have any use for your discounts.”
Mr TDB dropped his cigarette and put it out with his shoe. The train car opened and he headed for it.
Cas’ body crashed hard into the edge of the doorway and his eyes flew open in shock. He quickly composed himself though and narrowed his eyes at the now guilty looking Winchester.
“He’s captain of his crew,” Castiel told them. It was as if he were speaking a foreign language to Naomi, who only frowned when Castiel caught her eye, but Charles nodded.
Dean didn’t say another word until Castiel finally sat down at the table, the doctor’s eyes still carefully trained on the increasingly less distressed firefighter.
Dean loves the sounds he can get out of Castiel. He loves it so much, in fact, sometimes just the sound of Castiel coming will put Dean on the edge of doing so himself.
Dean eventually let his eyes roll and placed his hands on his hips as he let out a sigh in frustration. “Cas, what do you want me to do huh? I’m not going to get rid of this thing, its not possible- despite what Collette said. And you two running around behind my back, breaking scribes out of heaven’s jail, is just stupid.  Just let me handle this.”
The voicemail ended and Dean found himself standing. He didn’t know when he stood up, but it was probably around the time he fully understood what was happening.
“Cas doesn’t like my job,” Dean blurted out instead. “Which is bullshit because I’m a fucking firefighter! Usually, people are pretty turned on by that, what with the uniform and the muscles, but Cas is all freaked out about it because of Inias and I just-“
He made his way up the hill to where his parents laid and then settled his back against his father’s tombstone.
He closed his eyes as he felt Castiel come behind him, placing his hand on the firefighter’s lower back.
“Alright. I was um, I mean, I know you probably have plans for tonight already, but I was wondering if you wanted to grab coffee or something this afternoon.”
Castiel shook his head. “Oh I do. They make me very happy. But too much of a good thing can be bad for you.”
With his eyes on his parents grave though, Dean rose from his place in the grass and placed his hand on Inias’ tombstone. “Until next time buddy.”
Castiel’s hands traveled up into Dean’s hair and began massaging his scalp, forcing Dean to flutter his lashes in ecstasy. The doctor’s fingers were long and strong, sliding between Dean’s tresses and eventually grabbing a fistful and pulling lightly. Dean went willingly.
He just wanted to meet this woman that would be taking Alex home with her. He just wanted to be sure whoever this woman was, that she was capable of dealing with Alex’ issues, and doing it in a way that wouldn’t mess her up even more.
“Have you gone in yet?” the woman cut her off. She turned towards Alex’s room and Dean was granted the view of her profile. He was struck with familiarity once again, but couldn’t place her yet. “Is she awake?”
Dean blinked forcibly, his body  shuttering as he fought against it. Dean’s eyes flitted between red and clear water. The sting from the cuts on his knuckles came and went as his bloodlust ebbed and flowed. He could feel himself being pulled in two directions, ripping him apart from this inside. The red receded greatly as he heard Cas tell him he loved him. It receded enough to let Dean see what Cas really looked like at that moment. He saw the bruised and bloodied face of the man he had fallen for. He saw the torment in the angel’s eyes, the fear and anguish he had put there. The red began to push again. Pushing at his edges, seducing him into not caring about the broken man before him.
Without thinking, Dean put his hand behind Cas neck and pulled their heads together, resting his forehead on Cas’. He could see out of his peripheral vision that Sam was watching them for a moment before grabbing the duffel back and turning around to go up the stairs.
“I am not!” Dean argued. “I’m just- I mean it isn’t like he- you know what? The steaks probably need turning.” He turned back towards the grill as Sam continued to cackle behind him. Dean dodged the waft of smoke as it escaped the grille when he opened it and flipped the steaks with the barbecue tongs. He closed the lid and pointedly did not look at Sam. “So, did you catch the Ranger’s game last night?”
It wasn’t long before Castiel was panting above him, making shallow thrusts with his hips and gripping the headboard above the bed like he might just tear it apart.
As his thoughts roamed over Collette’s words earlier he couldn't get past her use of the word lover.
Dean watched the tide roll in with his brother by his side for the first time in what felt like years.
“Take off your shirt, Cas,” Dean asked him breathlessly, but before he knew what was happening, Dean’s own shirt was up and over his head, discarded and forgotten.
Alex had no response for that. She pursed her lips, an irritated expression that made Dean feel both triumphant and sad at the same time.
He doesn’t cry. He’s shed so many tears over his brother, he’s not sure he has any left. Besides, Dean’s not sad. It could be because its hard to be sad here, but Dean thinks its true. He’s happy for Sam. He wants Sam to follow his own path, where ever that leads.
“I like the sound of that,” Castiel replied, working his way down Dean’s neck. “You should say it more often.”
Dean furrowed his brow. This wasn’t exactly something he’d ever hoped to hear. But. He loved Castiel and if he needed to tell Dean about why he loved Inias so much, then he would let him.
“I don’t want to rush things, Sammy. We’ve only been officially together for four months. People don’t declare their love for each other after four months. That’s- well that’s some chick-flick shit right there and that ain’t me.”
Dean, panting now, let out a small moan of pleasure as the Doctor purposely brushed the side of face against Dean’s penis. He mouthed along the shaft for a just a moment, and then pulled back.
Castiel stared at him from across the table, his expression completely unreadable. Dean fidgeted in his seat, feeling like he was waiting for a sentence to be passed down.
Alex was quiet again for a few moments, and Dean worried he’d have to call the fire department to get her off this roof, but then she nodded.
“I guess international spy is off my career list,” Dean replied. He slowly made his way over the eave. He stayed there, sitting above her rather than right beside her. “What are you doing up here?” Alex said nothing. “People are looking for you, you know.”
“Yeah, no shit.” Meg said with a laugh. “That guy is missing a few personality traits if you ask me.”
“Dean!” A man’s voice yelled from behind them. Dean pulled away and looked behind him. “What the hell?”
Dean grabbed some coffee and a sandwich at one of the kiosks near his gate, then settled into a seat near the gate’s check-in counter. He wass mid-bite of his pastrami on rye, when the ass he appreciated so much earlier, sat down right across from him.
Dean nodded his agreement and made his way out of the car. Castiel followed quickly behind and they walked up to the house together. The key was were Bela said it would be, so in less than a minute they were inside the house of a dead couple they’d never met. Dean felt like they were being watched as they stood in the foyer of the house. There was a large staircase in front of them, a hallway that extended into the backside of the house beside the stairs, and two rooms to the left and right of the door. Castiel was the first to move. He walked carefully into the office on the right, looked around for a moment then said,
At that, Dean smiled and placed his hands on Castiel’s hips, drawing him closer. “Thanks, Cas. I know that.”
“Dean will sleep in my room,” Castiel told her, and everyone else in the room. He caught Gabriel’s eye, who smiled and nodded with encouragement.“And if anyone has a problem with that, they can fuck right off.”
Charlie, clearly baffled, looked back at Dean with raised eyebrows and a slightly anxious look on her face. He mouthed back “Craigslist” and suppressed a laugh as he moved into the kitchen and replaced the light bulbs in there with orange ones.
The kiss was charged. Butterflies ignited in Dean’s stomach and pushed their way into every nerve ending in his body. Their lips moved slowly, carefully, opening to allow the gentle swipe of tongue. It was the kind of kiss that made Dean more nervous than aroused because it was the kind of kiss that reminded him of how much he truly cared for the man in his arms. It was the kind of kiss that could build into something hot and needy or taper off into something sweet. As much as Dean loved having sex with Castiel, the ones that tapered off sometimes meant more than the ones that ended with one of them bent over the kitchen table. The sweet kisses were the ones that meant they were really doing this. A relationship. The real thing.
Sam pulled the bitch face again. “That’s not what I’m saying. I’m just saying your job shouldn’t be your identity, and I think you deserve a break. You know? I think you deserve to do something just because you want to.”
“Definitely,” Charlie agreed. “And if you need a third and fourth opinion on paint swatches, you’ve got to call someone else because neither of us know a thing about design.”
It was one of those nights where it seemed like he couldn’t save anyone, and anyone who did survive was bound to be right back in his care just a few weeks later.
, Dean.” Charlie explained. “If you’re looking for victims to save when the episodes happen, then that might mean that you’re having trouble separating your life at work from your life at home because you don’t have an outlet at home. You’re afraid to talk to Cas about what happens at work, so you’re inadvertently bringing it home with you, forcing yourself to deal with things with Cas. However, if you feel like it’s you that’s dying whenever your body goes into overdrive, that might mean that you’re actually afraid of dying yourself. I mean, think about it Dean. The man you’ve fallen in love with has a severe phobia about his boyfriend’s dying and you, the new boyfriend, have been chasing your mother’s ghost for years. He’s terrified you’re going to die and you’re terrified of hurting him when you inevitably do.”
Dean cringed at the girl’s reaction, but pushed through the moment to look back to the bodies in front. Paramedics were running towards him, the girl would be moved soon.
Dean felt incredibly foolish for letting himself hope that the angel loved him in the same way he did. He scoffed slightly and ducked his head in an attempt to hide the angry embarrassment that threatened to lash out.
Castiel opened his moon pie and stuffed most of it in, all at once. He turned towards Dean and opened his mouth.
He moved through the house again slowly, cringing at the odd smells and particularly ugly crown molding that circled the dining room light fixture. Dean purposely looked past the stained carpet and imagined hard wood floors instead. He imagined the large windows clean and useful, and he pretended not to smell the things he definitely smelled.
“Yeah?” Dean answered as he walked back toward the living room. He was still very much naked and sticky from their earlier activites. Castiel smirked.
“Looks like I’m the one doing the favors here, Cas.” Dean says, looking up to his husbands face as he licks a long stripe up Castiel’s shaft.
Castiel let out a heavy sigh to match Dean’s then squeezed Dean’s hand. “It’ll be fine. My mother will be cold, my father distant. Michael will be a dick. Anna will be rebellious, which usually translates to unnecessary arguments, but she’s generally very lovely. Gabriel will be a side show act for none of us to enjoy, and Jimmy will just smile and nod.”
Sam looks to Dean, obviously sharing some of Dean’s discontent, and then looks back at Jack. “We’re in heaven. You built it, right? You should know.”
“But,” Dean amended, not even sure what was about to come out of his mouth. “I want to, like, really make that place
“Is there anything you could have done to stop him Collette? Is there something you wished you had done differently?” Cas asked the room, his eyes searching the invisible particles that hung above the table.
Cas let out a breath he was unaware he was holding and let his lips curl into a relieved smile. He squeezed Dean’s shoulder softly before letting his hand drop and turning and walking out of the room towards the bunker’s basement.
“This is Dean, my boyfriend.” Dean shook the hand offered to him and returned Roberto’s smile. “Dean, this is Roberto. He’s our family’s chef. I’ve known him since he was a sullen teenager, working in our gardens with his father.”
Castiel wanted to make it perfectly clear that he was not propositioning Dean. He was only trying to convince Dean to accept his own self-worth.
He thought about turning around and coming back tomorrow, but being that close to Dean made him want to see his plan through. If there was a chance he could end the day in Dean’s arms, he at least had to try.
“There will be no gushing,” Dean argued, his finger in his brother’s face. “But the other stuff sounds good.” He led the way to the backyard with the steaks in one hand and barbecue tongs in the other. Ben was still working hard on his space ship, referencing the instructions with a very focused look on his face. Dean sent him a small wave as he slid open the back door and stepped outside.
Castiel startled slightly, and then let out a short laugh. “Well, it seems this weekend is going to be full of proposals.”
“Dean.” Castiel’s breath stutters slightly as Dean continues to lick his way around Castiel’s dick. “Please.”
“Come now Dean, wasn't it much easier when you didn't have to hide how much you love this? How much you need it?” Crowley’s voice crooned to him as he walked closer to Dean.
Castiel didn’t speak for a long time. Dean could tell he was trying to figure out what he wanted to say. When he did speak, Castiel’s voice was rough. Like maybe he was close to tears.
Sam averted his eyes down to the beer that continued to sweat down his hand. He took in a breath and tried to steady his voice as he asked a question he knew could send Dean flying out of the room.
Gabriel trailed off, and something in his voice led both men to turn back around to face him. Castiel took a step forward.
Dean shook his head to get rid of the thought as soon as it entered his mind. That was, of course, ridiculous. Fate wasn’t a real thing, and if it was, it was telling them they were wrong for each other. If they were really meant to be together, shouldn’t they already be,,,you know
White chairs were set up on the lawn, with an aisle of flowers running through the middle. People were dressed nicely, dresses and suits. There was a group of women all wearing the same dress, huddled together towards the sliding glass door. At the end of the aisle of flowers, there was an archway, it too covered in flowers.
“No,” Jack says. “That was Chuck’s story. There is no destiny anymore, Dean. You don’t have to follow a script.”
“Surprise, Cassie.” He said it like the surprise was a good one, but Gabriel’s eyes said something else. Caution.
“That’s not funny.” Castiel said, barely containing an irritated smile. “What if I really was crazy?”
“There’s no shame in a little make-believe, Cassie. You have to spice things up somehow! You’re bound to be at least a little bored by now.” Castiel rolled his eyes and contemplated just hanging up on him. “How about this? You let me use your office for three hours and I will put together a little basket of fun for you and Dean. I’m talking flavored lube, glow-in-the-dark butt plugs, and the biggest cock either of you could ever-“
“I’m afraid I’ll lose him,” Dean finally responded, very quietly. He wasn’t even sure Sam heard him until his brother stepped up beside him and looked out at the backyard with him. He also wasn’t aware of just how afraid he was until the words were out of his mouth.
“Well, yeah.” Sam teased, putting the car in park. “How else are you going to have your own internet startup company, if you don’t learn all about profit shares and dividends?”
“Debauchery?” Castiel asked, craning his neck to track Dean’s entrance. “What exactly will that include?”
“Yeah, yeah,” Jo replied, obviously satisfied with the state of her bedroom. “Charlie’s asking for you anyway. She doesn’t know if she should kick out the DJ or pay him or whatever.”
“No.” Dean said quickly. “Well, yes, but I won’t in six years.” He finished writing out the number and pushed the receipt to Castiel. “Call that number in six years, and ask my parents for my new number. And I bet when you call my ridiculously hot husband or wife will answer the phone.”
Dean half-walked, half-hobbled through Charlie’s doorway an hour before the party was set to begin. With his arms full of bags of decorations she requested he pick up, Dean could just barely get through the door before dropping everything on the ground.
Jack tilts his head in confusion. “What do you mean? I told you he helped rebuild heaven. I think he’s currently…” Jack trails off and his eyes glaze over. Seconds later he blinks and smiles. “He’s currently helping a young woman find her lost cat.”
“It's on theme!” Charlie replied indignantly. “Did you get the candles or not?” She began searching through the bags.
“That you’re head over heels for that guy.” She said softly. “And that maybe you know Luke isn’t the one for you.”
“You’ve got to be joking,” Castiel groaned as he opened the door to his car and climbed out. “Gabriel, No. Absolutely not.”
Castiel opened the journal and flipped through it slowly. “Understandable, but it’s for the best. He’s quiet for a little while, so Dean moves to the other side of the room to open her closet. Some clothes are clearly missing from the hangers, and the bottom of her closet is a bottomless pit of junk. She probably just threw everything in here the last time she was told to clean her closet. Dean smiled. He respected that.
“Apologies,” Castiel replied. Dean could tell he was grinning. “Shall I play some peaceful water sounds for you?”
“What’s wrong?” Dean asks and as soon as the words are out of his mouth a shiver runs through his body. It’s painful before it’s gone. He’s stopped driving. The car is parked in the middle of the road and Dean is turned almost entirely around in his seat.
Dean hadn't agreed to look into what Metatron knew because Dean wanted to find the cure, he gave in because he knew it would make Cas happy. He was putting Cas’ feelings before his own, something that wasn't unique to this situation, but it felt important somehow. Castiel felt it in a different way this time.
