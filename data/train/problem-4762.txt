“Pull over,” Dean growls, pointing to the next exit.
“Only because John Hamm turned me down,” Dean quips, trying to keep a straight face but he ends up laughing.
. The mixture of Sam’s routine schedule and being a farm hand on Cain’s land has done him wonders. His doctors are impressed with his shape, his health, and his mood. Castiel will even brush his hair and take his medications under his own volition now. He’s not all healed, he still has dark days where he struggles to get out of bed, but Castiel can admit to himself that he is much improved from the shell that was dropped off like damaged goods at Sam Winchester’s door.
“Am I allowed to have a few peaches as compensation while I work?” Castiel questions, quite innocently.
“So do you,” Dean says motioning to the sexy as fuck aviators.
“I didn’t ask for your pleas, just your color,” Castiel is quick with his words.
“I know you will,” Dean states firmly, patting him on his back and then letting him go. “You have Cas with you.”
“That’s great, Mom,” Dean’s voice wobbles, so he clears his throat again. Cas crosses the tub, sitting next to Dean and resting a hand on the nape of his neck. Giving him a soft empathetic smile.
Dean sounds downright weepy now, his hormones must be plummeting and exhaustion must be riding him hard.
“I love you,” Dean replies into his neck, and they hold on to each other till the water runs tepid. An apology is unspoken, but isn’t warranted. Dean’s body sinks into Cas’, his fingers holding on to the other man in a way that brokers no argument that Dean is apologetic down to his bones.
“It’s fine, Dean. You didn’t know. I didn’t even know. Just, not again, ok?” Castiel practically chokes out, breathing deeply just like Garth told him too when terrible feelings overwhelm him.
“Is that a Dean-ism?” Castiel asks, eyes closed while Sam pulls through his hair a few more times.
Dean’s life has fallen into a domestic routine in just a few short months. Cas goes running, he always brings Dean coffee in bed, and the morning is not complete until they shower together, trading lazy morning kisses and hand jobs. It’s the best way to start the day and Dean doesn’t want anything to change. They definitely don’t even talk about Castiel’s fully furnished place next door, which they only use for yoga, and they haven’t done anything more than vanilla hand jobs and frotting, much to Dean’s disappointment.
“Would that be something you’d be interested in?” Dean asks, tucking the ring box back into his jacket.
“Better make sure it’s something Cas would like,” Sam reminds him, “He’s gotten weird about food.”
“He’s malnourished. I’m feeding him exactly as I was told by his doctors,” Sam retorts hotly, feeling more defensive than he probably should feel.
” Castiel tries to protest but Dean is quick to cut him off, “No, you listen to me. You protected my kid. You don’t apologize, capiche? You are a goddamn hero today and you can’t convince  me or Sam otherwise.”
Much love, ioascc
Dean and Castiel turn down their public displays of affection after Sam’s disastrous phone call, and Sam doesn’t know whether to be grateful or pissed off about them being so mindful. They make an awesome team,
Sam appears at his elbow, quiet, and grabbing a few more beers from the fridge. The ladies of their lives look at them with disapproving frowns, Deanna even smacks Sam’s arm in reproach.
“Cas,” Dean starts and hushes his voice a little more, “What you did was not ok.”
” Dean instructs and switches tactics when Jack seems unresponsive, “
” Sam sighs and there is a weighty pause between the two brothers. The static of the phone hums between them until Sam speaks again, “
“Jesus, Dad,” Dean barks, “It’s none of your business.”
The crunch of cones and the quiet sounds of eating is the only noise between them. When they simultaneously finish, both teens lay back on the blanket. Close enough to touch but still a great enough distance between them that Dean feels the space basically vibrates with tension.
“Castiel, your friend here was telling me that you are fond of being outdoors. I’m looking for a farm hand to help me with my bees and peach trees,” Cain states, with a small smile on his face.
“You gonna fill your plate, son?” John asks, waving his fork toward the buffet.
“How do you feel about spice?” Dean asks, pulling out his pickled hot peppers and popping open a lid.
“Oh my god, Cas,” Dean guffaws, “Don’t read that shit! It’s clickbait!”
“Only to people who aren’t homophobes,” his grandpa shrugs nonchalantly, “Now, can I have a beer while your grandma isn’t looking? She’s a shrew when it comes to me drinking. Thinks it’s going to mess with all these damn pills I’m on.”
“Dean Winchester, I know you are not laughing at me trying to protect your phone,” Cas scolds, trying to use his Dom voice but it doesn’t work… not while his ass is hanging out. Dean reaches over and gives it a little love tap, making the muscle jiggle delightfully. No wonder Cas enjoys spanking him so much.
“Ok,” Dean says slowly, “And how does that have anything to do with the band?”
He takes a couple big breaths, but it just pisses him off even more. The smell of their mixed scents is overpowering, they blend and compliment each other. He can smell it off of Dean’s skin.
“You read about us?” Dean tries to smooth his face from the scrunched up look of disgust, but it’s an arduous task.
“You’d rather not talk about it?”
Dean’s eyes dart away to rest on Hannah, who is staring and basically drooling at Cas dressing up as a cowboy. Damn her. This is his freakin’ fantasy and she definitely needs to butt out. Dean loves cowboys, loves them, and Cas knows this because it’s been a movie marathon of all of his favorite movies for the last couple of nights.
“I feel it,” Sam laughs, “Cas, man, you are my longest relationship outside of blood relatives and we aren’t even together.”
“It’s not a race, Sam,” Castiel states, putting a steadying hand on his shoulder, “And I’ll be with you every step of the way.”
“Uncle Sam? Are you still awake?”
“Of course,” Castiel smiles a little breathlessly. Castiel on his back, stretched out and under Dean’s mercy is a magical thing, and it takes Dean’s breath away.
“We’ll start with Tadasana, breathe deeply, rolling your shoulders up and back,” Castiel’s tone of voice has taken a soothing quality to it and Dean slips into a peaceful state of mind following the rise and fall of Castiel’s voice, his breath, and his movements. He follows everything Castiel does, his mind blank, muscles stretching. It feels good to be told what to do, Castiel’s hands and voice guiding him into positions, breathing with Dean. Deep breaths in and out until Dean is dizzy with oxygen. It’s an intimate holy moment and Dean gets lost in it. He doesn’t really come back into himself until he’s on flat ground in a pose that Castiel has called Shavasana, his thoughts start to trickle back into his mind. Dean can feel Castiel’s eyes roam over his body, causing arousal to tickle in his gut that he’s quick to squash.
“I sleep.”
“It’s beautiful here,” Sam comments, leaning against the questionable railing. Dean wants to pull him back from it, as if his baby brother is still a toddler who hasn’t quite mastered depth perception.
“Honestly, man, you’ve got more important things to think about than just a birthday. Usually it’s just another day for me. This year, I just wanted to do something special to honor Jess’ memory. It’s going to be ten years this year. Ten birthdays without her and I just wanted to celebrate, you know? I made it another year.
When they finally finish the very last music video number thirty-three,
“No, no, please,” Dean pleads in a panic, holding on tightly to his best friend. He’s messed up, he doesn’t want Cas to leave. But Castiel slips through his fingers and into his own bunk, shutting the curtains hastily.
Castiel groans loudly in reply, mumbling, “I gotta stop wearing his clothes.”
Looping his arm through Dean’s, they walk back to the hotel. They see the ducks in the hotel’s fountain. The two men get whiskeys at the bar. They drink them down and go up to their room.
Cas turns the car over, revving the engine a few times to Eileen’s delight. She proclaims she can feel the vibrations in the seat underneath her when Cas punches it down the road. The car roars and Dean laughs when he sees John pop his head out the front door.
“You alright there, Cas?” Charlie asks, her black and blue skirt swishing back and forth, holding the ukulele.
Scrubbing his lips, and running a hand through his hair, Sam nods and pulls out his phone to call Dean. It rings a few times.
“What? No!”
” Dean waves around his room from what Cas can see on the screen anyways, “
Castiel looks at him, eyes so big and fathomless. Calm ocean waters or a darkening clear sky. His voice deep, and barely audible, “And a good son for staying and taking care of her.”
Dean knows that he is living a lie by denying himself even the chance of being with a man. He knows that he could be missing out on finding the potential love of his life, but… after being burned so many times by previous relationships… Dean’s convinced it's better to play it safe and not date anyone long term for the time being. It’s been clearly established by his previous female partners that he is better off as the love-it and leave-it kind of guy.
“You deserved it, sweetheart, you are so good. So good. You deserve everything,” Cas praises and kisses. Kisses all over his face, his neck, his chest.
So, he settles for the next best thing. He’ll talk to Garth. Sam hovers, staying close by, making Castiel tea and eventually making him eat toast. Sam also hands him one of his heavy duty anxiety medications. Castiel dutifully swallows it with a tall glass of water. Eventually the shaking subsides, he calms down, and dozes on the couch.
“I want-” Dean starts, letting out a soft pant while Cas grabs a handful of his butt cheek.
Dean has messaged him back,
Charlie rolls her eyes, clearly picking up mannerisms from Gabe, “I visited the school once, those teenagers were all about you. Walking around with hearts in their eyes. Now they are all young suburban Moms and Dads, lusting after the newest Wiggle. Singing along about waking you up.”
“Easy, relax, sweetheart,” Castiel instructs and Dean lets the bar go a little. Watching Castiel undress slowly, fold his clothes and place them in a neat pile next to his, has Dean feeling a mixture of exasperation and pure desire.
Clearing his throat and quashing the desire to step back, or step forward to press his body against the other man, Dean waves the concern off, “It’s no worries, was a long shot…. You know? I was just trying to avoid surgery.”
Dean is glad he’s been in good company for the past two weeks though.
Thank you to all who have read this! Truly, Hello, Everyone! was created with so much love and I hope you all walk away from this story feeling happiness. I was encouraged to join up the SPN MBB by Emblue_Sparks, they had said back in September 2020 "write about what you watch." At the time, and even now, all I watch are The Wiggles because of my child. The idea burned in me and unfolded to what you all have read. I can say with my whole heart, they are amazingly talented group of people that are inspiring. The purple and yellow's Wiggles secret relationship and later marriage was the inspiration for this fic. And you may be wondering... why such an odd title? The band members say "Hello, everyone!" at the beginnings of their shows to be all inclusive. ;) Something to strive for.
“Cas,” Dean bemoans, “Go upstairs, please. I’ll be ok.”
“You say you are an angel,” Dean murmurs, still not believing.
“I just want to be loved and to love,” Sam says quietly, looking out towards their yard, “I want a mate and if they want to, I want kids.”
Cas hums in a response, taking a detour to the peanut butter aisle with his deodorant tucked under the arm that is holding his phone. His bulky knit cream sweater makes it difficult to manage, but he does it because Dean obviously needs to talk to him and work some things out. Cas hears Dean huff and puff in exaggerated irritation before he quiets and his voice mellows into that deep passionate gruff that sends pleasure goosebumps cascading over Cas’ body.
is playing,” Millie says, beaming, “It's one of my favorites.”
“I didn’t know- I thought that place was empty,” Dean comments, peering through the door. Literally nothing is inside.
“Let me help you, son,” the beta states, hands raised in supplication. Groaning, bones cracking, he crouches low and gathers things up and collapses their umbrella.
“The band does, yes. Like everyone else, we are salaried employees,” Dean grinds his teeth.
He hauls his bag up and whistles for Miracle to follow him, intent on spending the rest of the night in deep, restful slumber.
Cas colors brilliantly, face instantly beat red, “Yes. Well… and no, we are obviously not related and own a B&B together. I just let them assume.”
“It says so in the Bible,” Samuel answers.
Birds sing, their chirps sharp and loud between the two men. He can feel the breeze tickling through his clothing as goosebumps erupt on his skin. The sun beats down on him, hurting his eyes and still the question remains between the two of them… would it be so bad?
“Castiel,” Dean breathes.
Standing only in the tiniest shorts and sneakers, Dean’s tongue feels like it's going to flop out of his mouth like a lovesick cartoon. Spotting a breathtaking tattoo, its black lines and with show-stopping watercolors curling around the top of Castiel’s shoulders and down the slopes of his back. It’s gorgeous, light and dark mixed together in a vibrant dance of color that makes him want to trace it with his fingers and follow with his tongue. In his imagination, he can almost feel the skin beneath his lips, the strength of the muscle between his teeth, and taste the salt of Cas’ skin on his tongue.
Already dressed in silly comfy PJs, some kind of pattern of alpacas wearing sombreros, and an oversized baggy sweatshirt, Castiel looks adorable. As always. Adorable and just slightly intimidating, the secret steel peeking out that the other man usually hides so well.
Letting out a startled laugh, because Cas continues to place sweet kisses on his dick, Dean gives him a distracted answer, “Nothing is sexier than ass ointment.”
. Castiel should not be attracted to him, but he is and the burning sexual attraction lights up in Castiel like gasoline. But it’s too much for him, too much skin and too soon, and Castiel is just overwhelmed with feelings that he thought had been cut out of him. Sliding off the couch while Jack is regaling his father about his flight, Castiel slips into the bathroom.
“I’m sorry, Dean,” Jack mollifies.
“How are your wrists? Arms?”
“But it doesn’t, dearie,” Rowena chirps, “And like Vegas… pictures still follow you back to the States.”
Dean is about to respond with a witty remark of his own but Becky, their exuberant manager, comes up running to them holding her tablet to her chest wearing a manic grin. “You guys are trending!” She is practically shaking from glee, like an oversized Chihuahua.
“Yeah, man, pity. I’m… I’m a disaster. It’s pathetic,” Dean answers, honestly.
” Dean laughs and rolls back on his side, his face practically splitting with a smile. Once again, they just stare at each other. Castiel memorizes every freckle he can see, the slope of Dean’s nose, the valley of his lips.
“If you don’t mind, you can strip the bed and throw the sheets in the wash. Second door on the left,” Dean feels almost guilty for instructing Cas on what to do.
Dean drops the marble and his Dom stops instantly. Castiel drops his legs and Dean lets out a huge sigh against the tie. His muscles relaxing and the quilt scratching up against his ass. His Dom is quick to pull the tie from Dean’s mouth.
“Did you even dry off?” Cas amuses, reaching up and flicking Dean’s wet hair.
“I’m sorry to hear about it.”
Jack takes a look over at his other parents, watching their obvious enjoyment in each other. The noises of the restaurant fill the space between them, the tinkling of glass, voices rising and falling, the music, and the birds chirping at each other in the trees.
“I guess you're ok with going to Sioux Falls for this Christmas, then since we stayed home last year,” Sam jokes and rubs his lips, “Man, I’ve… I’ve been so out of it.”
The air feels weighted around Dean, and a slight chill makes him want to cover up. Feeling vulnerable and raw, he hopes Cas understands how badly he wants this, needs this. So he waits and he listens to Cas’ measured breathing. He doesn’t count, that would be rude to his Dom, but he knows that Cas needs to get into the right headspace to better take care of Dean. To take care of them both really, Dean instinctively knows that this will make Castiel feel better as well. He sure hopes his grandparents and brother don’t come home too soon.
“Take a step back,
Dean laughs loudly into the phone.
The shoes fell in front of Cas, who refused to catch them. Instead, Castiel looked at Dean with his normal exasperation. Swooping down and picking them up from the floor with a patented roll of his eye and sexy raised brow.
“You wanna date me? For real?” Dean’s incredulous tone seems to cause Castiel’s eyes’ to squint even more.
“Did they stick the cat in the boot, yet?” Sam questioned, peering up from his phone where he was waiting for Dean’s response.
“Chicken.”
“So, what’s the problem?” Cain questions, taking a huge chunk of the pie and bringing the fork past his teeth to irritate Castiel. He
“Sammy,” Dean impishly grins and then with all seriousness, “I don’t know if it’ll come to anything, but I promise I’ll call if something happens with the folks. You know relationships and me, man. Most of the time it’s a bust.”
“You disobeyed me.”
“Talk about it with Garth,” Sam offers with a soft smile, “I’d love for you to come.”
“Be a good boy and be quiet, Dean,” Castiel instructs, voice a seductive purr. Dean’s mouth snaps shut and he flexes his arm that is not around Cas to redirect blood flow away from his groin. Dean quiets down, watches the show, but he is hyper-aware of the effect Castiel’s words have on him. He doesn’t know how the other man has tapped into Dean’s absolute desire to be a good boy, to hear praise that was hard-wrought and hard-won growing up, but he has… and it’s lighting up everything in Dean.
“No!” Castiel practically shouts, “No. He said it was up to me.”
“Ew, Dean.”
is definitely a trigger. He’ll have to bring it up to Garth, including it in his exposure therapy. Garth has been showing pictures of where he was kept, it makes his skin crawl and heart race every time he sees it. Every time he thinks about it… but eventually, he knows he’ll just see it as a room.
“I’m saying,” John says again this time more imperiously, “Tone it down.”
“Not the jean ones,” Sam calls out to Dean’s retreating back and then mutters more to himself, “No one needs to see that.”
He felt just a little bitter admitting it, but his brother was right.
“So boys and Charlie dear, you’ll be back in the States for the first leg of your tour, then Canada? How are you feeling after coming back from Europe?”
“Rigatoni,” Castiel replies, sounding steadier.
Silence reigns between them, it’s uncomfortable. The radio plays in the background, some pop tune belting out; ‘
It only takes a few strokes of his hand and he’s so close to his climax. Soft moans roll from his lips, he doesn’t stop them along with Dean’s name. It comes out like a broken chant. The fact he’s recording himself, in this intimate moment adds to the power and the allure of it. His body careens along to his climax and it punches out of him. His knot is huge, so he reaches down and touches it, orgasming again. Taking a firm grasp, like he’s buried himself within Dean, he orgasms again. The white cum hitting his chest and making him moan Dean’s name wantonly. He ends the video with a soft sigh, his fingertips trailing through his own cum.
He’s quick to blanket Dean with his body, continuing the bruising kiss. Pulling on Dean’s clothes, they practically strangle each other trying to get their clothes off. Heated and rushed, with socks still hanging off his feet, Dean shoves a dry hand down into Cas’ boxer briefs and jacks his cock slowly. Dean watches the flickers of arousal and listens to Cas’ deep moans.
“Are you going to be ok?” Sam asks, realizing that his brother is watching his Alpha walk away from him.
“I don’t want to go into details,” Dean grunts out. Frankly, he’s embarrassed. They spent months together, Castiel thinking the entire time they were dating and Dean was too dense to realize it. Or is it the other way? Dean doesn’t even know. Couple of dumbasses, the two of them.
The whole thing is made funnier by Cas’ arousal jutting up and bobbing with every ungraceful movement and waving in time with the belly laughs. Castiel stops at the edge of the bed, smiling widely with good humor, he wipes his eyes and is still chuckling.
attitude. Getting pregnant with Jack and really enjoying sex with Alphas are probably the most “Omega” he ever has been.
Feeling uneasy, Dean decides as he slides into the Impala that he could go see his parents a little bit earlier than just their usual Sunday dinner. Dean half convinces himself that it’ll make him feel better for being kind of an ass to Cas. It’s a family tradition for the Winchesters and Campbells to congregate at Dean’s parents, they’ve been getting together for Dean's entire life. Their food is always delicious and he takes great joy in always beating the snot out of his grandpa Campbell at cards.
A shiver runs down his spine, Dean’s cock is still semi hard when he frees it from his pants and boxers. His first lick of Dean’s skin is salty, the cum cooled onto Dean’s skin. It’s carnal bliss.  With the flat of his tongue, he melts into licking Dean’s belly and his cock. The fine curled hair of his treasure trail  and the thicker pubic hair make his lips and tongue tingle delightfully with friction.
“I’ll see you, Monday,” echoes Castiel.
Dean walks in, giving a cursory knock on the frame around the door, “Ma!? Dad?”
It’s deliciously aggressive and not at all what he would have expected for their first real kiss.
“Nobody? Since Carmen?” Charlie asks, clearly surprised. Carmen was his girlfriend senior year of college. They had dated a long time after school, even lived with each other, but she had cheated on Dean towards the end of their relationship when he started picking up gigs in the band’s American tours.
“Marriage?” Castiel asks, blinking owlishly at Dean.
His mother had already made a little sound of disappointment when Dean had informed her that he was bringing Cas, his friend and bandmate, home with him instead of a new love interest.
“In this loving atmosphere, we’ve heard a lot of relationships blossoming between the crew members. Garth Fitzgerald, for example, meeting and marrying his wife Bess and they are now having twins. Any lucky ladies for you two lads?” Crowley asks, though he seems pained to do so.
Dean had sent him a teasing selfie, showing him where engine grease got in the morning scuffle. All soaked into his clothes and into his skin. Bare skin. Castiel can see in the selfie that it’s Dean neck and pectoral. There are freckles dotting along the ridge of his nose and cheekbones. He can even see the beautiful expanse of his chest and the slope of his tummy. If he zooms in, Cas can see the telltale trail of hair from his pectorals down the slope into his pants. His face is playful, a mixture of exasperation with his nose scrunched. He’s looking up at the camera, way above his head. His eyes are a brilliant green in the photo. His lips are so full that Castiel can practically feel them against his skin.
“Not particularly, no.” His words are overly dry and short, he doesn’t mean to be rude but sometimes, sometimes his thoughts are private.
“I-” Cas starts hesitantly but is interrupted by Dean,
“My couches are newer, but I like your TV.”
“That was by far the stupidest thing I have ever heard you say, Sam Winchester,” Cas deadpans, answering for both of them.
“Green, Castiel.”
Though he is the main vocalist for Dance with Cas, the video obviously focuses on Castiel’s dancing. Long limbs encased in highlighter yellow lycra and black, Castiel should look downright ridiculous… but watching Castiel dance with little girls and boys wearing tutus and tights is honestly adorable. They smile and spin, and Cas smiles and spins, and it almost makes Dean want to smile and spin… but he resists because Gabe
Cas’ fingers card through Jack’s hair and he blinks slowly at Dean, his words slow and so very deep, “Three.”
“Drop to your knees,” Dean instructs, stepping back, opening his belt. The little clank of metal hitting metal causes his cock to swell and his mouth to water in Pavlovian response. Like a dog salivating for his food, Cas knows that as soon as  Dean’s belt comes off, they are going to play. Dropping to his knees slowly, in the dirty alley, Castiel watches Dean unbutton his pants.
Dean huffs out, reaching for his phone on the nightstand and bringing it closer to his face. His eyes are positively blown out with arousal.
“I’m wrong?” Cas laughs and settles back down into his pillows. When he closes his eyes, which is exactly what he needs because they do indeed burn, he can imagine Dean is curled up next to him. His body is much bigger than Castiel’s. Dean takes up the majority of the bed, their knees would bump and they’d have to slot their legs in-between each other to fit. Cas can’t decisively imagine the way Dean smells, his scent is probably a lot like Jack’s…leather and woodsy.
“As you wish,” Castiel replies, untying Dean’s eyes.
Humming, Dean takes a sip of his beer, feeling a little vulnerable he answers Castiel’s questions, “Uh yeah, taught high school band and choir actually. For ten years if you can believe that. But yeah… my mom was sick and the band was taking off so Garth replaced me. Good guy, it feels odd replacing him now that he’s about to have twins.”
Cas nods and moves toward Dean’s feet, slowly divesting of his socks, then PJ pants, his boxers, and Cas even helps Dean out of his shirt. Each article of clothing is folded to the side neatly and Dean wiggles against the fuzziness.
” he comments and laughs dryly, “
“Obviously, I am not emotionally engaging with anyone. Just you, Dean,” Castiel assures, watching Dean’s emotions flicker on the screen. He’s pleased, his eyes lit up, and the smile tugging his lips is playful.
“They hurt,” Cas lets go and runs his sweating palms over his jeans. His fingers come back to life, the nerves screaming and tingling. “Like the rest of me. I hurt.”
“Of all the idiotic things-” his Dad starts in on Dean but Castiel hot on Dean’s trail and is pulling a chair up to the little table.
And then another ping;
“You ok, sweetheart?” He murmurs, holding Dean close.
They gaze at each other, long and way past what is normal. Dean reads Castiel and in turn, Castiel reads Dean. Reads his freckles that paint the bridge of his nose and across his cheeks, reads his vibrant verdant eyes, his lush red lips. Dean takes in all that is Castiel, the power radiating and the unassuming form of a beekeeper. The careless toss of the dark tresses, the tan of his skin, the broadness of his shoulders, and the swell of the muscles.
With a small bark of a laughter, Cas repeats seriously, ‘I’m not “talkin’ to anyone else’ besides you, Dean.”
“Please, the lemonade is on me and truly… I wish you didn’t come all this way under false pretenses.”
Sam nods again, a sharp quick thing that looks more like a flinch. Sam drives home and Castiel mulls over what he can say. The roads are loud. People are driving aggressively to get to work, but Sam is an aggressive defensive driver and they make it home safe with only Cas’ heart racing in fear once. Nothing like California traffic to get more adrenaline through his body.
whispered against Dean’s lips.
“I wasn’t going to say
“Is there anything else?” Dean asks, teeth tearing into the hot bacon, as Cas pours him a huge helping of orange juice.
“Yes, love, coffee and kisses.” Dean only barely registers being called love, but he definitely hears it in Cas’ voice as he drifts to sleep.
Returning with a warm washcloth, Cas just shoves Dean back into the bed with a wink, “Hands and knees,” he orders and Dean scrambles to do so.
(See the end of the chapter for
When Cas is calm, his breathing returns to normal and he shivers at the cool air in the Impala. Dean helps him back into his sweater and cups his face between both of his hands. Staring into the blue, blue eyes of his love, Dean feels it all settle… everything will be ok.
Castiel hums, low in his throat, he’s neither agreeing with Dean or disagreeing. Dean knows that’s his noise for thinking. “What are you playing with in your pocket?”
“Come,” Castiel commands, dropping the purple flower to the ground. Moving amongst the trees, Dean follows, wiping his lips. If this monster claiming he is an angel wanted to kill him, he would have done so already. They come upon a modest little yellow cabin in a small clearing, stepping inside, Dean calming at the normality of his surroundings. Wooden floors, dated furniture, and happy colors.
“No, we are going to take a walk,” Dean states and pushes Castiel to turn around. Onlookers look at them curiously, but Dean steers on. Feeling the press of the other man’s body against his, even despite the fact that Castiel in fact
“Pup,” Castiel practically purrs, hand rubbing Jack’s back and keeping him close.
“Alright, why don’t we focus on that. The kid gloves,” Garth asks patiently.
“Fine, we can implement a stoplight system,” Dean grumbles and very sarcastically he quips, “Are you interested in spanking me too? Going to tie me up to St. Andrew’s Cross? Should I be calling you Master? Sir?
“Well, my boy, it sounds like you’ll be busy for quite some time,” Missouri tuts, tapping the menus to the table, “I’m glad you stopped in today. You gettin’ your usual?”
The doorbell rings and Sam gets up to answer it. Jack unhappily frowns looking over at his Uncle, his voice hushed and he leans over the table knocking a few pieces off the board, “That’s not even half of it. He drinks constantly too. Dad’s constantly cleaning up after him, going to find him in some sketchy bar or motel. Brings him back, sobers him up and then John’s right back to it.”
Helen hums and wags her eyebrows, “Assistance, uh-huh.”
“No, not right now,” Dean shakes his head looking out his own side window biting his thumbnail and then dropping his hands into his lap, “This would be the shittiest time to ask you. I’m just… I’m just making sure we are on the same page in this relationship. That we’re both serious, not just passing time for fun.”
“More than fond.”
There is just an empty dirty coffee cup next to the sink and not in the dishwasher.
Dean’s eyes snap up to the blue ones of the clerk, the realization slowly dawning that he has managed to walk straight up to the person in question. Around the signs for sweet tea and lemonade, is a little sign of a bee proclaiming ‘local honey.’
“Yes, Castiel.”
“Yeah! We didn’t agree for you to be human!” Dean says with such fierceness of emotion that Cas steps back but then corrects himself and steps forward into Dean’s space.
Castiel hums, adjusting the hat and then his wide belt buckle. Drawing Dean’s eyes to Cas’ crotch. Dean is thankful he’s hiding behind the racks and no-one else can see the huge hard-on he’s sporting right now. Castiel does and a wicked teasing smirk flits across his face while he adjusts the outfit in front of Dean, looking at himself in the big mirror.
“Son of a bitch is cryptic, right? I feel like Indy wading through the pit of snakes, only to find that there is no Ark.”
“Places everyone!” Charlie calls and everyone scrambles to take their marks on the stairs.
Dean gets a generous slice for his Pop, way more than his MeeMaw would normally allow. But damnit, the man deserves it. Not like those other fuckers sitting around the table causing Dean more problems.
“Corner,” Cas indicates with a wave of his hand to the empty bed at the corner of the house.
“Sorry, man,” Sam says quietly, for Dean’s ears only.
Dean hands over an earbud and starts the movie up again from the beginning. Dean commits himself to do the very best to immerse himself in the story, getting caught up in repeating his favorite lines and even noticing something that he didn’t catch the last time he watched the movie. But his traitorous brain registers that Castiel watches Dean’s profile as much as he watches the movie, his gaze soft.
On his hands and knees, Dean eases himself onto the dildo. So slow, just like he would sink onto Castiel. This way he can feel every ridge that passes through his hot wet channel. So he’s able to listen to Castiel’s moans and the uptick of his breath, feel the tremble of his Alpha’s fingers at his hips.
Cas makes a dismissive noise between his teeth and dips into his car. With false exaggerated anger, Dean starts Baby up and revs the engine for Cas’ benefit. He can see through their windows that the other teen rolling his eyes in exasperation. It makes Dean smile, his heart thumping loudly with a surge of pure affection.
“Again, gross Charlie,” Dean laughs and takes a swig of his beer, feeling a blush rise to his face.
“I still enjoy it. I scroll through the pictures and a particular sense of vindication fills me. It’s incredibly satisfying knowing all these women and men lust after you and I’m the one who brings you to completion,” as he says these ridiculous things, a hand travels down and cups one of Dean’s butt cheeks. Kneading and pulling, so their pelvises align.
Grunting a very grumpy reply, Dean rises to his feet, a little unsteady, but Cas keeps a large hand on his back while they go through and shut the house down. Cas even brushing his teeth beside Dean. Dean gurgles obnoxiously, which earns him a smile and a teasing pinch on the meat of his hip.
“It predominantly casts shade over the house, not where I intend to landscape around the perimeter by the fence,”  Cas explains, even using his hands in gestures to explain himself.
“You’re a weirdo.”
Castiel unfurls from the bed, nude but elegant and with smooth movements until he stands before Dean. Cupping the back of his neck, eyes trained on Dean’s, “Your father is looking for you, I’ve received a few texts from my neighbors that he’s been through my house in Edenton.”
“Jenna sweetie, I believe Dean here needs a touchup, he’s a little shiny,” one of the hosts informs the makeup artist in her thick Scottish accent. The female host, a tiny redheaded woman named Rowena, is perched in her own chair opposite of them, a gown flowing around her. She looks like a Queen. Dean knows despite her small stature, this woman is a shark of daytime television. Her cohost, Crowley, also a Scot and somehow related to her, is known for practically being a demon in disguise. Dean has seen them rip people apart, but he highly doubts that they’ll do that to him and Castiel today. They are children’s entertainers for Christ’s sake and people love them.
“Sounds indulgent.” Castiel’s voice is soft and deep, leaning up against his counters and watching Dean with hooded eyes. Dean’s eyes flick around his visage, from his dark blue socks, faded jeans, to the white button-up, the top few buttons undone.
“You sure about that, Cas?” Dean asks impishly, licking his lips.
Currently, the two of them were spread out under an umbrella. Picnic between them, a huge bag of red grapes practically demolished. He had snapped a picture of the moment for Dean. It was such an instance of normalcy that Sam had unabashedly rejoiced. His smile was huge in the selfie, where Castiel’s lips barely quirked. With Castiel, Sam rejoiced in the small things. He was looking better each day, becoming more independent, and was even eating grapes without Sam’s instruction. Castiel had even gone into the ocean and swum, and had smiled briefly when Sam splashed some water at him.
“Dean,” Sam laughs, “We are two hours early for my flight because you insisted that traffic was going to be bad and security was going to be long. Traffic wasn’t bad and security seems to be moving along fine.”
“How is letting a group of people marry immoral?” Sam questions.
“Shoot! I’ll have to run to the shop and get that at a tackle store,” Hannah states suddenly, albeit a little after the fact, and darts out of the room. Charlie rolls her eyes and follows commenting that it was a good thing it was lunch break or something. Dean’s not listening,
“You have been busy,” Cas sighs and sits up pulling away from him, “I understand. You have to have a life outside of me.”
“You left your market stand out yesterday, sweetie, Stanley collected it all and put it in your workshop. Where did you run off to yesterday? Family emergency?” Helen asks clearly concerned, hand on her hip and gesturing dangerously with the coffee pot.
“Well, you just let me know, I like having you here, but the peach harvest is over. Nothing but chores and honey now. You should spend some time with your mate’s family,” Cain replies, his eyes trained on Castiel.
“O’ fuck,” Dean moans through his clenched teeth, staring down at Castiel on his knees and the damn cowboy hat perched on top of his head. “O’ fuck.”
During their meal, Cas had regaled him the various histories of “hush puppies” and other weird food trivia he had collected over the years. It was entertaining and Dean felt himself relax with the assistance of a few beers in his belly. Afterwards, Cas had insisted on walking off their starchy and deep-fried meal. They ended up at a bluff, looking over the harbor in companionable silence. The only people in the park, the two men stare out at the water and the bridge in the distance. Like any harbor, it smelled a little fishy but it was peaceful.
Dean tries to let his mind drift, to let his thoughts melt away. He struggles to let everything go, does his best to focus on his breathing. All the turmoil… he wants to let go, but he needs Castiel’s help in letting it go.
thrumming constantly through Castiel/his body. Wanting something.
His mother sounds so sure, so confident, and it has been six months since he last saw them. But he asks the words anyways, “You sure, Mom? I don’t want to fight Dad like last time.”
“No Cas, I know this is all in my mind. I know you're gone. I don’t even know why I bother asking,” Dean angrily bites out interrupting Cas, “I’m going crazy. I can’t do this anymore.” Getting up, and storming away from the bench the dream ends, but he can still hear Cas calling for him.
He’s helping Jack unpack, putting away clothes, shoes and toiletries when Jack brings up Officer Penikett.
his father snaps angrily, “
“Mr. Winchester, is there someone else? Castiel’s mate?”
love, ioascc
Dean laughs awkwardly at this and puts his hands over his eyes and shakes his head as if he can’t believe he said that, “
Feeling even more heat in his cheeks, Dean shakes his head no and sticks the mat into the closet. “It’s nothing, man, don’t worry about it,” he replies hastily. But Castiel doesn’t budge, his eyes big and his head tilted to stare at Dean.
Castiel waits ‘till Sam’s alarm rings at five-thirty. He waits ‘till Sam gets out of bed and starts the coffee. He’s shaking. He hasn’t slept. He’s spiraling. Malevolent and harmful thoughts swirl like a miasma around him and he can’t make heads or tails of them. Castiel clutches his phone, white knuckling it so he doesn’t drop it. Sam sees him and instantly freezes.
Dean was dating Amanda and she was a good girlfriend.
“Yeah, ok.”
“I know how to bake,” Castiel offers, feeling unsure of how he can contribute.
They disperse after changing out, conversation still unheard around Dean. He makes a beeline for his car, his thin flannel practically flapping in the wind he’s walking so fast, the door creaking loudly against the tumultuous thoughts in his head.
“Spending all the time with Cas… doesn’t leave much room to date? There aren’t any nice dancers?” Mary questions, her lip worrying between her teeth. She’s standing at the stove, waiting for the water to boil.
“Not my mate,” Sam automatically states, “And he’s my nephew. But yes.”
“I think that’s enough for now, we can venture into our kink list another time,” Cas answers, letting out a large breath. He comes near Dean, a little hesitant but eyes warm. Setting the orange juice in front of Dean, “Not coffee, but I can offer another kiss?”
“Oh,” she scoffs standing up, “Well, you should have just said that you were
Dean regales his namesake with life on the road, working in the studio, and hanging out with Cas. He tells both of his grandma’s about the amazing farmer’s markets, the meals the two of them make, and the outings they do. Dean tells them about the yoga and the veggie drinks Cas makes him drink. Dean even describes the one weekend they went to the Atlanta Aquarium and got swarmed by kids and parents alike. He talks about Charlie and Gabe too, their names sometimes appearing in the stories… but mostly… he talks about Cas.
The buzzing of his pleasure in his ears silences the street noises around them. He licks and licks until Dean’s skin is wet with his spit and not cum. His lover is breathing harshly through his nose, and normally there would be praise but this is a punishment and so Dean keeps his verbal caresses to himself.
“So, boys?” Crowley prompts, “Who did you marry in the crew in secret?”
“Yes, I believe it means the aversion or hostility to, disdain for, or fear of gay sexual orientation or gay people,” Jack answers robotically.
and Dean is saying his goodbyes and hanging up the phone.  Sam holds the phone against his ear, holding it wedged between his ear and shoulder until he can dry his hands.
After some time, Dean doesn’t know how long, Cas’ command breaks the silence, “Come here.” His voice is so deep, so smooth.
Not all is silent yet, if he strains hard enough, he can hear Sam and Eileen having sex…
“I know you, Dean Winchester,” Cas whispers against Dean’s lips, “I know you. I’ve seen into your soul. You are all that is love and kindness.”
In a short time they’ve settled into a domestic routine. Sam spends his days setting up a network that rivals the British Men of Letters and Dean gets out and works to support their daily needs so they don’t abuse Charlie’s magical credit card. They do laundry, make breakfast, and on the days Dean doesn’t work at the garage, they both go down into the bunker and work the phones and do research.
His mind shouts at him.
The statement hangs heavily in the air, Dean’s words are dark and thick with a cacophony of emotions. Anger, arousal, frustration, and even a tinge of satisfaction.
“It is.”
Dean nods, working his clearly abused lips between his teeth. Biting on them and nodding, he seems to want to say something, needs to say something. Instead, he keeps it to himself and Castiel is left wondering.
Setting his beer on the ground, Dean opens the box. Two plain platinum bands, the etched vines worn with time, are nestled side by side. A matching wedding pair.
“Do you wanna spend the night tonight?” Cas asks so quietly, Dean’s ears strain to hear him. Dean agrees just as quietly, lying next to each other bathed in the moonlight. He can only see the straight line of Cas’ nose, the wide lush lips, and those sharp cheekbones, everything else is hidden in shadows. They pass the time looking up at the stars, and Dean dreams of a different life. Listening to the noises of the city and the small woods behind them. When Cas shivers, Dean pats his shoulder and they make moves to the car. With Cas’ phone, Dean texts Sam to let him know where he’s going and where he’ll be.
Jack just shifts the peanuts back and gives him a small smile, “I’ll be ok.”
Castiel pushes again against his hole, the dry fingertip barely dragging inside and then slowly retreating. He’s so careful, but Dean shivers and moans at the micro-movements.
The men dress in silence, Cas reaching out and touching him. Soft caresses like he always does, every touch meant to comfort and weather Dean through this storm.  Dean can hear his parents stirring in their room as they are packing up their bags and loading them into Impala. Dean steals a few garbage bags for Cas’ wet clothes. While Dean is dismantling the couch bed and Cas is stripping the sheets off his childhood bed upstairs, his mother appears dressed in her robe looking small and timid.
Groaning, not wanting his father to bleed to death and having to hear about it… Dean searches the yard while Sammy and his Pop watch. Picking up the caps and grumbling. Sam gets out a chair for his Pop to sit. He gets heckled by the peanut gallery a few times, but it’s all in good fun. Henry is tipsy by the time he finishes his beer.
“I mean it, Dean,” Sam says holding Dean out by his shoulders, looking at his big brother thoughtfully, “Whatever happens, if they react poorly… you know they are in the wrong and I… I love you no matter what.”
Dean shrugs, “I’m alright with that, unless you aren’t. Gotta be true to yourself.” The words taste like bitter jealousy just saying them, but Dean utters them anyways and he does mean them.
Pulling on what is indeed Sam’s shirt, Cas aggressively finishes his pickle, ignoring Cain’s gleeful teasing countenance.
“Good session?” Sam asks, as he always does.
“I was unaware of the seriousness of our actions, Sam,” Castiel says calmly, but his words come out thickly and he seems to struggle with the English language, “I apologize.”
She flips the iPad around, displaying an article about
“That you’re right, I should just push through,” Castiel answers, his words a little above a whisper.
“Would you like for me to read the dictionary?” Castiel questions and Dean huffs out a laugh.
“What the fuck, Cas,” Dean shouts, uncaring if Sam hears him. He hasn’t told Sam anything, refuses to tell Sam anything. But he rails against Cas, his words angry on his lips, devastated, “It was actually you visiting my dreams? Why the ever-loving fuck did you think that was ok? After everything? Telling you loved me, sacrificing yourself for me… up and leaving me again!?”
, Cas. Don’t do it,” Sam pipes up, making Eileen laugh while he signs.
Now, there is no moving on. They live together, Cas taking up residence in his guest bedroom. They drive to work together, Cas is now working at a small and quaint nursery farm down the road from the garage. There is no escaping each other.
“Immaculate conception and a lot of stupidity,” Sam deadpans.
“You are so beautiful,” Cas lets out unbidden, “Thank you.”
His hands shake even typing out a simple “Ok” in response to Sam’s messages. He shuts himself in the office, stinking up the place with Omega distress that his men choke and gasp whenever they dare to venture into it to ask him questions about the cars he’s supposed to be working on.
,” Gadreel whispers and then says goodbye, clicking off.
Grabbing their coats, he shoves Cas’ jacket into his arms. Angrily jerking his on, he walks through the kitchen. Dean takes in his mother’s ashen face, the shock, and the tears welling in her eyes. She composes herself, wiping her eyes hastily and smiles weakly at Dean.
Cas’ house is across town, closer to the Magnet high school where he attended. Dean’s not surprised when they pull up to a pretty big house. Cas’ family is pretty wealthy, but Dean knows that Cas’ parents are never home. Like Dean, Cas raised himself but for different reasons. Cas’ father is an ER Surgeon and his mother is an Anesthesiologist, both work at Lawrence Memorial Hospital and when they aren’t working they are off doing their own thing. He drives a crap car and works because Castiel believes he should stand on his own two feet outside of his parent’s wealth.
“Would it be so bad?” Cas asks quietly, breaking Dean from his melancholy thoughts.
“Well, you're young, get back into the saddle.”
“Why?”
“You think?” Castiel questions, one eyebrow raised and sitting back. The steam of the food curling in the air between them.
“You get really mad, but you never say anything. So, Sarah created a betting pool to see how far they could go before you’d snap,” Cas admits and drops his hand from Dean’s shoulder, Dean watches Cas as if he is moving in slow-motion as he rolls his lips and licks them. His eyes are guilty and shifty.
Switching over to video call has its own technical problems, but they eventually make it and Dean fills his phone screen. They’ve both got their phones propped up on their nightstands. It’s almost like they are lying next to each other. Dean’s face is lit up with a blush, making the freckles stand out even more and his green eyes seem dark in the video. He’s shirtless, in bed, just like Castiel. The glow of his bedside lamp casts a warm creamy light over him and it takes Castiel’s breath away.
Staring into those blue eyes, Dean steps up to him. “Try again, please,” Dean asks, hand on Cas' forearm.
“Hey,” Dean croaks out, popping up and confused.
Cas looks like he’s about to burst from happiness, he’s nodding so hard. Smiling and biting his bottom lip, trying to stem the rise of emotions. So, Dean just captures the side of his face and with his thumb, he releases Cas’ lip from his teeth so as to kiss him gingerly on those wide trembling lips. “Don’t cry, sunshine,” Dean soothes, “I want to make all your dreams come true. We’ll build a happy home, you and me? Huh? Something we didn’t have, but we can have now. How does that sound?”
Dean's breath gasps from him when Castiel grabs the spreader with both hands and does an exploratory quick thrust into Dean. Dropping his mouth open, Dean cries out at the feeling of his prostate being struck directly by Castiel’s thick cock.
“Well, sweetheart, it was lovely meeting you. Maybe you can dig up my yard when you're done with your fellas. You could do no worse than Sam Winchester. Tall glass of water and so
This is one of the best Christmases they’ve had in a long time and Sam dreads going back home to California. He’s talked to Garth, wishing the man happy holidays, but preparing him for their arrival home. Ever the optimist, Garth seemed unfazed by the recent developments and wished Sam a happy Christmas and that he’s got Castiel an appointment first thing when they get back. He’s got the paperwork ready and some referrals for Castiel in Sioux Falls.
But Sam knows something they don’t… there is no case, just toes in the sand, matching Hawaiian shirts, and umbrella drinks. He’s already purchased the Hawaiian shirts.
“You’ll be sharing a bed,” Sam warns, taking back the key from him, “You don’t want to share with me?”
grateful for his experiences, they’ve been traumatic and yet humbling at the same time. They’ve certainly brought him back to his beginnings. Castiel finds joy in being a farm hand, joy in doing something tangible with his hands.
Dean sighs, letting go of all the tension that he’s been holding in,
” Dean says softly, his voice so calm through the video, “
. Amanda made him sort-of surface happy. They’d do things together, movies, dinner, and the town fair. He always enjoyed going places with her and they’d always have fun. But when he kissed her… his mind would drift and he’d think about what it’d feel like to kiss Castiel instead. To touch Castiel instead.
Letting out a jaded watery laugh that quickly turns into a sob, Dean lets go. Quietly crying into the sheet. He doesn’t make noises, his distress so sharp that the tears just roll down his face. He cries at the disgust in his mother’s eyes. The disappointment lining her face.
“In a manner of speaking, yes,” Dean fumbles out, really looking at the man. Dean knows his name is Castiel Novak and that he moved to Edenton three years ago. He’s a loner, over a decade older than Dean, and owns a farm a few miles out surrounded by the sound, trees, and wildflower fields on another. Novak sells his honey raw, in soaps, and lotions. None of the newspaper articles have really captured the raw masculine beauty of the man behind the little table though. Blue eyes the color of the brightest sky, dark messy hair, straight long nose, and a sharp handsome face peer curiously at Dean. His head cocked to the side as if he’s reading Dean like a book. His own eyes perusing, Dean can practically feel the other man’s eyes roam his body, creating goosebumps in the southern heat.
“While you’re out here hiding like a pussy,” John barks, opening the door, “You could get the Christmas decorations down for your mother from the garage attic. Put up the lights on the house. The ladder is in the shop. Maybe your friend can help you.”
“Ugh,” Dean groans and peers into the mirror, “They always do. I come off looking like a painted whore.”
“Come on, Dean,” Charlie groans, pulling him along like the ridiculous baby bisexual that he is.
Castiel’s blood runs absolutely cold, “Don’t call me that.”
Barking out a laugh, Castiel shakes his head and pushes Dean away playfully, “No, but perhaps I can sneak the hat home, and maybe you can ride me?”
His vision tunneling in panic, Dean sits down at one of the seats close by.
“Yes, Castiel.”
Dean signs and talks to Eileen and Sam, introducing Cas to both of them, and to his surprise, Cas knows sign language. Quickly leaving Dean in the dust.
“That’s alright, sweetheart. You may have pulled on them too hard, you have to relax next time,” Castiel tuts, untying him. Massaging his arms and wrists, Dean watches Castiel’s big hands bring life back into the zinging nerves.
“I’ll get you new sneaks,” Dean comments, sighing at Cas’ expensive running shoes.
Immediately, Dean goes to his mother and hugs her tightly, “I’m so sorry, Mom.”
“Yeah, Cas, I know,” Dean mumbles, feeling shy, so he plays with his food, Dean folds the berries and bananas deeper into the oatmeal while he listens to Cas talk about the relationships between Dominants and their submissives. He doesn’t know how to truly have his conversation with Cas, doesn’t know if he even has the tools to truly express himself.
“I am not,” protests Dean.
“Mary is just fine and that sounds very interesting,” Mary states and waves Cas’ protests off with a flippant hand, “Dean let me know that you're Gabe’s cousin? I hope he’s not lonely over the holidays with you visiting us.”
Letting out a deep suffering sigh, Cas looks to the heavens and then towards Dean. Dean tries his best to smile and nod reassuringly, but he’s sure it probably looks more like a grimace. He always acts like a moron around Cas, when he even dared to get close, the man’s intense magnetism short circuits Dean’s brain and makes him an idiot. He says stupid things and acts what his brother fondly refers to as overcompensatingly butch. Though, based on Cas' responding smile and the mirth in his eyes, Dean’s face must have arranged itself to look less constipated.
The world dances and brutally assaults Dean’s senses when he blinks his eyes open. Looking up at Castiel’s face, his partner smiles beatifically.
Dean breathes and then smiles, removing his own boxer shorts. Dean is also fairly large, thick and cut. His penis is fully erect, standing out from his body and up. It’s gorgeous. Dean is gorgeous and Castiel is compelled to tell Dean so.
“What does it look like? Getting Mom’s fuckin’ decorations down,” Dean snarks, throwing his hands towards the boxes and then the overturned garbage.
Rolling their hips together, Cas presses his chest against Dean’s to whisper against Dean’s lips, “So good.”
“Jack could take us.”
Dean nods, watching hungrily while Cas reaches down and adjusts his erection in his jeans. Dean knows from their mutual shower escapades and dirty cuddling that Castiel is packin’ some heat. His partner rocks the big dick energy and he definitely delivers. Cas eyebrow raises, but reaches over and tucks Dean’s flaccid cock back into his boxer-briefs.
Even with that soothing imagery, Dean’s anxiety is starting to get the best of him too, so instead he focuses on and worries about a particular blood vessel in Cas’ temple that might burst from internal rage.
“And also, how the heck did you get into my house?” Dean asks, trying hard not to watch Cas pull on his flannel with Hannah so close. Cas dressing is one of Dean’s favorite things, he’s obsessed with the breadth of Cas’s shoulders and the way clothes pull taut across each muscle. Blue jeans stretched thin over those damn thighs. Cas is so unashamed of his body, he’ll get undressed and dressed right here in the rack room.
He has even written a pro and con list on his phone, though it wasn’t helpful. All his emotions are all messed up and basically, it all boils down to not wanting to lose Cas.
“I figured you’d be on board. I was talking to Eileen about it and she was just as enthused. She let me know that she’d make herself available via video call if we needed assistance,” Castiel practically glows with happiness at the thought of a new project.
“I don’t like lying,” Castiel murmurs when he’s free of his microphone.
“Lack of morals?” Sam questions, and Dean pinches his brother under the table. Sam bats his hand away.
“I know,
Cas helps Dean step out of the mariachi boots and pants. His hands palm Dean’s buttocks, meanwhile his lips wet Dean’s boxer briefs with open kisses against his straining erection. Looking up at Dean, Cas’ eyes are swallowed up by his blown pupil, the halo of blue practically glows.
but his lover shakes his head.
“They do!” Sam chirps, taking a sharp left turn into the main road.
“Doubt it.”
“Hey, Sammy, welcome home,” Dean smiles, face obviously pleased and genuinely happy. It just makes Sam even more angry at the situation.
“Mom? What’s the problem with me staying upstairs? Cas really doesn’t mind,” Dean asks, stepping closer to his mother.
“Cas?” His doofus of a brother questions.
“Everything’s ok,” Dean says, automatically but then stops and adds, “I wanna do this with you Cas, I’m definitely into it.”
Just surviving blow after blow is getting weary. He’s weary. He feels older than what he is from all of his life experiences. It’s wearing him thin.
“It’s alright. Charlie is the one who told me about this place, she’s a few units over. I’m assuming she told you?”
That's what they called him at the ruttery, never his name. Always,
“Night,” Dean calls back and turns to Cas, “You need to go, please.”
“I can do that,” Cas whispers, licking his lips and watching the slope of Dean’s naked chest rise and fall between every breath. The moment is charged with sexual tension, even thousands of miles away. It’s palpable. Castiel’s words are slow and seductive when he utters them, “I want you too.”
Dean commands, and if under Dean’s spell, Cas does. His toes tingle, and the orgasm rushes through his body, his knot and sensitive head twitching with release. Lights dance behind Castiel’s eyelids and he’s sure he gasps Dean’s name and moans loud enough he has a moment of worry that Sam can hear him on the other side of the house.
“Hello, everyone!” The band greets the crowd, using Wiggle fingers and all.
“Good to know.”
“Media Arts and Production, Ms. Winchester.”
“Dean,” Castiel implores, “Is there something the matter?”
“If you’re amenable,” Castiel replies, hand trailing down and grasping Dean’s cock.
“Do you feel the need to be punished, Dean?”
Cas touches his shoulder, first tentatively, and then grasping it in shock, “Dean?” He’s alarmed, worried. “My love...Dean...what happened?”
Poor Sammy... He always gets kinda screwed when it comes to relationships. :/ whoops for continuing that trope in UHC. But you all will be happy to know that he will have his own story! Technically, since UHC is Castiel's story, I wanted to go more in depth with Sam separate. His/their side will be posted on September 29, 2021. So look out for that for those who wanna read Sadreel! :) Until next time!
“Green, Castiel, please, green.”
“Is that him? Are you texting him?” Jack asks, “Did you tell him that Cas came home?”
I don't know if a lot of you all caught it, but I bid on Verobatto, a lovely artist, for FicFacers and requested they do a scene form this story. You can click a few chapters back to see her lovely artwork. :)
So good. They’d be so good together. They will be so good together.
“Can I sit here?” Calloused fingers brush across the top of Dean’s unsocked foot, jerking Dean awake.
, and the flex of Castiel’s toes with a small
“Have you tried Missouri’s blueberry?”
Castiel, the professional dancer of the group, was trained in all things ballet, jazz, tap, Irish, and contemporary dance. To see Castiel from across the stage was seeing a true artist perform. The man was magnetic. He was cool, confident, and composed. Every move was fluid, like seeing crystal water rush down a creek bubbling over rocks and skirting around fallen logs. Dean couldn’t stop himself from feeling in awe of him, he definitely deserved it. Cas always made him feel uneasy in his own skin, a feeling that Dean wasn’t familiar with, ever since he first saw the man across the stage on tour three years ago.
“Oh, no, ma’am, Sam isn’t my mate. Just friends,” Cas explains awkwardly.
and a few “
“What? It’s true, name one female relative that isn’t absolutely batshit crazy?” Gabe sasses.
“Ok, fine, you made it,” Dean knows it isn’t fine but now the lid is off the pot and he’s bubbling over, "And now, now… you have all these women hanging all over you,” Dean’s hand gestures angrily towards the general direction of the store.
“Sammy, stop,” Dean hisses through his teeth, even though he delights in the look of cognitive dissonance on Samuel Campbell’s face. He loves his grandfather because he’s his grandfather, but he does not like Samuel Campbell or enjoy his company. He is the harsh grandfather, always telling Dean to suck it up and be a man.
“Color?"
“Cas,” Dean sighs, “Man, you have nothing to apologize. No one does besides those fucking dicks that tried mugging Jack and broke his arm.”
“Yeah, ok,” Dean grunts and nods, “See-ya.”
From one thing to the next, Dean doesn’t have long to consider these thoughts because he’s hustled along to the next event penned in the calendar. He drops all of his thoughts because being a Neanderthal in front of a national morning show is not a good thing. Dean has running internal chastisement to himself to not fuck this up no matter how damn tired he is. He will not be a weirdo on national television. He will not disappoint his MeeMaw. He will not sweat through this very fine sport jacket that their manager, Becky, picked out for him.
“Is your mother better?”
“I was scared and Sam sent her away. We left the beach and I… I was fine afterwards. We went for burgers,” Castiel offers, feeling caught in the realization that Garth is right.
“Dad was a nervous wreck putting me on the plane,” Jack offers after they switch games to
“Well, that’s gross,” he complains more to himself, Cas grunts into the meat of his neck. The man is completely boneless, spread across him, tacky skin sticking together. Dean traces the knobs of his spine, tickling the other man.
“Sam.”
With a horrible feeling, he glances up and sees himself and sees a mirrored horrified expression
Dean prompts, his words practically a purr, pulling at his own underwear. The band snaps loudly against Dean’s skin and Cas’ whimpers in want.
“Cas snores.” Sam shrugs.
“Yep,
The days are long; rehearsals, sound checks, concerts, back on the bus to a new city to start all over again. Dean’s tired. He sleeps whenever he can, curled up under a few blankets flat on his stomach trying to keep his left leg from dangling out of the bunk. No one is inhabiting the bunk beneath him, but he definitely doesn’t want someone to run into his rogue leg in the middle of the night. Everyone's sleep schedules are out of whack. The bunk above him is the one that Benny, their driver, uses when he eventually sleeps. So far, Dean hasn’t witnessed him use the bunk once, Dean is half convinced that the Cajun man may be a vampire.
“I can give you rides out to the farm in the morning, no problem,” Sam waves away, “If this is something you’d like to do?”
“Sweetheart, you can’t assault an Officer, you will go to jail,” Cas whispers looking around if anyone can hear him, “He will be ok. I promise. You are working yourself up, but he’s fine.  We are fine and I’m taking care of him. I love your brother, I’m not going to let anything bad happen to him.”
Swallowing the candy bar practically whole, Dean chokes out a “No!” Feeling alarmed that he has been coming across that way. He doesn’t want Castiel to think he hates him. If anything, Dean has a bad case of self-deprecation going on.
“Of course. Thank you, Dean,” Castiel breathes softly, a hand on Dean’s elbow, “I appreciate you welcoming me into your home.”
“Yeah, Mom, I can do that,” Dean answers, feeling so small.
“Yeah, thanks for that,” Dean growls, so close that he can catch the monster’s lips within his. Even knowing this creature is
It’s late into the night when Sam leaves to go back to his own apartment. Dean’s words are buzzing on his tongue, filling his mouth like angry bees, and he corners Cas as he’s stacking the empty pizza boxes together in the kitchen to take out the trash. Their eyes meet, and silence descends between the two of them. Not comfortable silence either, this is nothing like when they’d drive around with no music on with only the hum of the Impala between them. No-no, this is frustrated, weighty, silence that bites at Dean’s skin.
“Ground chuck or chicken?”
“Do you want this?” Cas asks, fingertips running down the back of Dean’s thighs, teasing.
, Dean is still so tempted.
“Where are we staying?” Jack questions, pleased smile on his face at the prospect of going on a road trip. Sam is not so much looking forward to it. He knows exactly how this road trip is going to happen. They’ll drive, yeah. Castiel will bitch about being in the backseat after about four hours, Dean will control the radio the entire time and probably won’t let anyone drive, Sam will be forced to blast audio books in his ears to drown out Dean’s music, and Jack will pretend to sleep even though everyone knows he doesn’t actually sleep.
“Well, Samuel must be seeing someone on the side and you are nose blind to it. It’s alright, it took years for my nose to get right after my Collette passed,” Cain finishes up his chips and wipes his hands. Cain doesn’t speak much about Collette. Castiel only knows of her because of her picture on the mantle and her presence that still lingers on in the small farm house, the faded feminine touches. A decorative pillow here, lace curtains there.
Sam’s mind screeches, must like the dial-up internet of so long ago, his eyes blur as he stares at their God-kid who just patiently watches him.
“I will,” Castiel vows. He doesn’t want to cause this kind of distress again.
love, ioascc
“What?”
“Well, Dean, this is probably the most I’ve laughed during sex in years.”
“You’re a wizard, Harry,” Charlie mimics in an awful British accent, just as Castiel drawls, “Looking good.”
“Sammy’s alright,” Dean drawls knowing this isn’t the first time he’s gushed about Sammy to Cas, “He’s a good kid and we got along real well growing up. Way smarter than me and he’s got himself a fancy fiancé.”
“Hmmm, not quite. When did your mate pass?” Cain asks nonchalantly.
Fiddling with his phone, he snaps a photo and sends it off to Dean, figuring this was the best way to inform his brother. It doesn’t take long for Dean to call him, his big brother is predictable like that.
“What are you talking about? I have that huge ass tree!”
“Dean,” Cas’ fight is still brewing inside of him, his voice begging and angry, “Please, sweetheart, let’s go. I can find us a cheap motel and we can stay there instead of dealing with this. It’s not right. I don’t like it, I can’t let you be treated like this, please let’s go.”
“I did push through, once you know of it. When I went to the beach with Sam, an aroused Omega came onto me and it made me think I was going to have to service her like I did at the ruttery.”
on. He had convinced himself that he might have moved on anyways.
Dean sounds so small and quiet and Castiel mourns his laughter and lightheartedness from just moments ago. It’s quiet again, this silence heavy and oppressing.
“Why don’t you just talk to him, then?”
“You’re sorry, uh-huh,” Dean snorts and then lets out a blustery noise that lets out the rest of his anger though he’s obviously still a little ticked. “Well, let’s go eat. I’m gonna need food if I’m gonna be forced to burn bones later tonight. ”
Dean and Cas just blink at her and she steamrolls on, “And there is more! This is just the first article. There are photos and tweets and even more articles! People love you two! They think you are the hottest not-couple! This is such good PR guys! Tackling heteronormative behavior and toxic masculinity barriers! I mean… some of its good PR… some people are saying you guys are actually gay and then it kinda derails into ugliness… but we aren’t going to worry about that! Focusing only on the good stuff! Maybe before the tour, we can tackle an interview? Yeah?”
“Up, please,” Cas requests standing at the foot of the bed, holding a huge wadded up cream blanket.
“Ride me, please,” Dean chokes out, closing his eyes against the tight sensations. Warm, wet, gripping him and molding around his cock… it’s almost too much.
“I love you too.”
He’s with Cas and it’s perfect in its own way.
“Solidarity, cuz! Solidarity.”
“How long?” The question finally blurts out, and depending on how Jack answers the question, Sam slightly wishes that a hole would open up in the Earth. He’ll slip n slide down to see Rowena and avoid the mortification that his brother has been involved with Cas for the past ten years.
“You aren’t, trust me,” Dean waves him in, “Come on, I was just about to start on an early dinner. Eat with me, use my real mattress.”
“Good,” Dean murmurs against his lips, “That was perfect.”
“I’m not on good terms with my mother,” Cas replies, simply with a smile. Though Dean can tell he’s putting up his guard. From what Dean knows, the little Cas has told him about his childhood, Cas’ mother is a master manipulator and beyond controlling. Dance classes every night after school, food weighed before it was consumed, and rules enforced by harsh punishments.
“Yes, dinner is at three,” Mary replies, though she looks exhausted.
, is heady. Arousal rolls sluggishly around in Dean’s gut, coming alive from the secret fantasies he’s buried so deep within him that this creature has awoken.
Dean hums, first nonsensical things and pieces of different parts of his favorite songs, but slowly he finds himself softly singing, "Rock-A-Bye Your Bear.” In his mind, Castiel sings along, the two of them singing and dancing while they shovel dirt. Cas is happy here again, in his little daydream. Dean figures that it’s safe, he can entertain a harmless fantasy in his mind.
“Yeah, yeah, fine,” Dean grunts, brushing off the imaginary dust. Cas clucks his tongue but lets Dean go.
“Want a treat, buddy?”
“Oh no! It seems that Dean has fallen asleep!” Cas cries, holding on to his arm, “Charlie! Gabe! Everyone! Dean has fallen asleep! We need to wake him up! On the count of three, shout Wake up, Dean!” The kids shout “Wake Up, Dean!” But the horror… it doesn’t work, Dean sleeps on.
“Running tomorrow?”
Sam cautiously opens his, Eileen signing him something that Dean doesn’t catch, but they both smile at Dean once they read the paper. Eileen laughing and telling Dean thank you.
“I can’t breathe,” Cas huffs out, his eyes wide with fear, “I feel like I can’t breathe.”
The days of Sam’s Christmas vacation are spent watching his brother make calf eyes at Castiel throughout the day and trying to avoid listening to the sex they have at night. When Christmas rolls around, Sam is grateful for the break in the monotony of watching the two of them fall more deeply in love with each other by the exchange of small presents. He’s happy for them. He is. But Sam can’t help the well of jealousy that rises in the back of his throat.
Mouth dropping open, Dean squirms and chases the orgasmic wave that’s cresting in his gut. Cas fingers twist and pump, opening Dean up in a tantalizing way. When he’s ready, Cas continues his onslaught making Dean’s thighs shake.
Dean speeds home and practically flies through the shower. He makes sure to wash his body twice, the dollar store body-wash killing the smell of pizza parlor instantly. Dean runs out the door, shutting it quietly behind him and hustles to the Continental. Hair still dripping down his nape, t-shirt sticking to his back, Dean drops down into Castiel’s passenger seat. Running his fingers through his long hair, letting it part down the middle.
“And I love him.”
Dean hears the click of the door shutting, then Castiel’s smooth quiet movements, picking up his clothes and folding them to place on top of his suitcase. Sitting in the chair in the corner, Dean hears Castiel take off his boots and set them aside.
Dean can only look up and look back down at his phone, completely in shock. Cas is quick, grabbing the phone from Dean’s loose hands. He reads it quickly, eyes darting back and forth across the text.
,” he whispers more to himself.
“Did someone teach you?” Sam questions, pulling into the parking lot of the doctor’s office.
But mostly, during the day, Dean tries to keep his mind on the road and his brother.
Hello, everyone! Happy Wednesday, y'all! At the time of this posting, I am officially in my new house! Hooray! Moving is hard. I purged a lot of things but it is completely worth it. We have a safe backyard with lots of trees. (I know that seems silly, but before we were in an open field with no trees and it was miserable.)
Dean is not angry at all, probably a little sexually frustrated, but Dean knows how much Castiel loves licking him clean. Castiel has a filthy come kink, this feels more like a treat than a punishment. Dean is slow to unbutton his pants, the press of his knees  on the rough cement is causing delicious pain that makes his whole body tingle.
“She was horny and she was flirting. Doesn’t mean you have to service her. You had a flashback?”
His scent fills Sam’s senses, calm ocean waters that are salty and pure. Taking deep lungfuls, Sam relaxes instantly and the Officer quips his lips in a small smile. Knowingly stepping closer to Sam, to allow the Alpha to breath him in and to calm down in his presence. Sam takes in the arresting features of the Omega in front of him, sharp cheekbones, tan skin, and dirty blond hair. He’s big for an Omega too, almost as tall as Sam.
“She is scary!” Castiel replies, smiling so wide that Dean can see the crinkles around his eyes.
Feeling remorseful, Sam thinks about how he’s going to ask the question before he  speaks, “This was your first venture into the United States, wasn’t it?”
When Sam finally arrives, Dean hugs him so tight that Sam coughs.
“We just need time, my sweet angel, that’s all,” Mary explains and pulls him into a forced hug, “Just give us some space, some time. I’m sorry, I thought we were both ready.”
,” Dean insists and Cas can hear the pure anxiety in his voice. “
“You didn’t want the scene to end?” Castiel questions, honing in on Dean’s drop.
“She’s in Hell!” Dean exasperates and his limbs feel weird but he grabs the offending shoes and follows Castiel out of one of the many storage rooms. It’s beyond weird watching his body walk in front of him with that patented Cas swagger. The former angel almost pulls off the smooth glide of his walk, but Dean’s legs seem to not quite be cooperating with the Angel.
They don’t talk about Dean’s family but once. Eventually, the buffer of good feelings erodes under the tide of emotions and breaks three days later. Dean rages and cusses, cries a little, and tries to move on. It takes a lot of will power for Dean to remember that sometimes you can love your family for being family, but it doesn’t mean you have to like what they say or do. Cas is quick to remind him that it’s okay to create space between family members when the relationship is toxic. It takes Dean days to accept that, and it just means that he hugs Sammy a little tighter when he drops him and Eileen off at the airport.
Eyes round, Dean freezes, eyes locked on the visage before him… Castiel’s chest is ruddy, his pupils eating up the blue halo of his iris. Dean eventually lets out a bark of a laugh, “You really got to stop reading my thoughts, man.”
“You guys almost done?” The manager, pot-head Chuck, called from the front where he counted the register.
In jeans that fit and a long sleeved button up, rolled to the middle of his forearms, Cas feels normal. He looks normal too, his weight and muscles returning to his frame. Gratefully, Sam has allowed more strenuous exercise in the past week which has boosted his energy levels.
“Need a spotter?” Castiel asks, wiping his face and neck with a towel.
“It can’t be too much of a surprise, though, you can barely keep your eyeballs in your head and your tongue in your mouth when Cas wears his spandex,” Gabe quips impishly, which earns him a swat to the stomach from Castiel.
“No.”
“What is the problem?” Castiel asks, and he’s so desperate that Dean feels sorry that he is causing such distress.
He pistons into Dean. The sounds of their flesh coming together along with their harsh breaths is the only noise in the room. It's deafening and perfect. Tears roll unbidden down Dean’s temples, his mouth open in a silent moan of ecstasy as his prostate is hit with every powerful thrust. When he comes untouched, it’s violent and it rips through him like a monsoon. With that his conscious thought washes away into perfect darkness.
Dean brightens visibly, “I think that would be brilliant! And inclusive to those in the deaf community.”
Tilting his head, Castiel watches Dean for a beat and leans over to kiss Dean tenderly. It’s a sweet morning kiss, chaste. Dean puts a hand on the back of Castiel’s neck, pulling him deeper into the kiss. When Cas pulls away, Dean gives him a brilliant smile.
“Ok,” Dean snaps back.
“The lady doth protest too much, methinks,” Castiel corrects while Charlie tells Gabe to leave Dean alone. Gabe and Charlie bicker some more, over the innate misogyny of how people view healthy sexual appetites.
Swallowing audibly, Castiel shifts his eyes to Cain’s face and sees only acceptance there. There is such stigma, such hatred in Alphas liking Alphas, but if
Cas laughs loudly, “Of course, Dean.”
“I bought those remotes that plug into the outlet, press a button and the tree goes off. Best fifteen bucks I’ve ever spent,” Dean murmurs happily. Hands wandering between them, down his partner’s back to the dip and then back up. Slow and steady, just loving the feeling of the muscles and warmth of his skin. He touches Cas, losing himself in the golden skin and thick muscles. Fingers tracing black ink.
“Residue,” Cas states and rolls his shoulders, and fiddles with the pillow in the chair.
“Not really, it’s our home and I want you to be comfortable. I can tell Dean no, Jack doesn’t need to come. Dean just wants to go to the bar and bang a few skeezes without Jack being in the house,” Sam waves his hand flippantly like that explains his brother’s behavior and goes to pick up another book reading the back of it. “What about hydrangeas?”
“Gettin’ old,” Sam teased doing his own stretches.
“I want to.”
Looking into her friendly green eyes, Dean decides he doesn’t want to hide from his friends anymore. “I kinda came out as bisexual to my parents,” he whispers, but it’s enough to silence the dressing room.
“Married?”
In its own dysfunctional way, it’ll be perfect.
“Alright, chick flick moment over. You are going to be late for your flight,” Dean grunts out.
Dean smiles uneasily, patting his kid on the shoulder and grabbing his bags. “Alright then, let’s get you home. Out of this hellish landscape of doom.”
“You wanted to watch, I want you to watch,” Castiel commands, taking a hold of the spreader bar and bringing Dean’s knees to his chest in one powerful, yet fluid movement. Dean pants and watches Castiel grab the lube from his bag. Pouring it directly on his hole, the cool liquid is a sharp contrast to his heated skin.
Sputtering for words, an internal voice not quite his own wants to call Cas out about being a girl, but Dean eventually just shakes his head at those errant thoughts, and they flit away. Instead, he stretches up against Castiel’s body appreciating Cas’ form against his own. Cas kisses his nose and settles in their little burrito of nudity and fuzzy blanket.
“I love you, too.” A simple truth. He has family waiting for him, everything will be alright. His life will continue and doesn’t begin and end with one man.
into the shirt. He spasms and twitches, his channel massaging the fake knot even more making him groan with satisfaction.
Like Dean, Castiel also sleeps whenever he can, that’s when he’s not making sure Dean’s eating. He sleeps during the movies they watch as a team in the front of the bus, he sleeps in the lounge curled around a book, and he sleeps splayed out in his own bunk. Shirt always rucked up, unknowingly showing Dean the smooth dip of his lower back and the crest of his butt. The watercolor rainbow wings fluttering below his t-shirt, calling out to Dean like a siren song, their beauty tempts Dean’s fingers.
“Mom thought you needed your own space, asked me to stay downstairs,” Dean answers woodenly, his face falling into his hands propped up by his knees.
“I need to go see Garth,” he manages to make out, which sends Sam into high alert.
“Yeah, knee-jerked and mind voodoo-d without consulting me solved the issue,” Dean grates, and makes a face at the offensive melon fruit.
“We’ll drive.” Cas ends the argument between the two brothers with one statement. Somehow during the last few weeks Castiel has become their decision maker and Dean just bends to his will. Castiel wants to try lamb gyros one day, Dean makes them for dinner. Castiel makes a small comment of eventually wanting a garden, Dean goes out and gets metal troughs and an assortment of herb plants and plants them next to the Bunker. Castiel says that in a few years they might look at moving out of the Bunker, Dean immediately starts house-hunting. It’s incredibly strange, but Sam goes along with it because out of the three of them… Castiel is the only one who has recently died and come back to life. Dean told him that Castiel sacrificed himself so they could save the world. Naturally he feels indebted to the guy. So, Sam eats the gyros, he plants the dill, and he adds his own list of houses to the already growing list to look at.
“Take me home, Cas,” Dean says, “But I gotta say goodbye to my brother.”
Or he used to believe in
“I’m going to flog you using my belt,” Castiel informs, and Dean shakes with pure desire. “A series of hits, twenty total, ten on each side. I’m going to count out loud and pause between each one. If you need to stop the scene, drop the marble and I will stop, no questions asked. I will also stop the scene if I hear your family come home, so let that worry fade from your mind. Do you understand?”
“Alright, follow me.”
“Uh-huh,” Cas sasses back, “I’m your big gay revelation. Don’t even attempt to dissuade me. I know you, Dean Winchester.”
“I’m sorry I freaked out,” Cas murmurs, playing with the edges of his case.
“First Christmas and you didn’t do anything?” Millie tuts disapprovingly.
,” Dean replies, easily adjusting himself in his pillows.
“Stupid? No, I’m not,” Cas replies, very coolly but Dean can tell a storm is brewing beneath the surface.
“Cas,” Dean finally laughs brokenly, “You gotta move.”
“So modest, Deano. Hope you know your life is dramatically going to change now? You are going to be a sex-object to desperate housewives. Becky is even working on a new TV deal for us. Every single move you make is going to be scrutinized and all of your past transgressions are going to be aired,” Gabe chirps with a devilish look in his eyes.
“So?” Cain prompts.
“Mary.”
“Treat yourself with kindness, Dean,” Castiel says, not releasing his hold on Dean’s chin, “We are all adapting and growing right now.”
“I really don’t need to know that, Sammy, but thank you for lettin’ me know,” Dean laughs, clapping his  brother and messing up his hair.
“It’s good to be home,” Jack replies sweetly, pulling Dean into a hug. His boy is so sweet, Dean doesn’t quite know how he managed not to fuck him up.
“It isn’t unwanted,” Dean murmurs, eyes solely on his oatmeal. No, not at all. This is a dream come fucking true. Not only does he get to experience being with Cas, a man who he deeply admires and respects and dare say it because it’s almost too soon... loves, but he also gets this? A lifestyle he’s been so attracted to, thought about, and masturbated to? Hours upon hours of looking into clubs, reading literature, and daydreaming? He wants this. He needs this. He would have never had the balls to go out and get it… but he can have it now.
“Color?”
Castiel doesn’t say anything but he watches Dean roll his lips and wet them with a quick swipe of his pink tongue. After a beat of silence, Castiel decides to put him out of his mercy and change the subject, obviously Dean had not intended to broadcast his feelings on a random Wednesday night over video call.
“Well, fuck,” Cain exclaims after a few beats of silence, eyes wide. Over a low whistle between his teeth, he grunts, “I hope she got what was due to her.”
“I think you’d look very becoming with a beard,” Castiel tilts and squints at Dean’s face in examination, “Yes, very becoming with a nicely shaped beard.”
“Oh, how wonderful! Thank you all, you guys have amazing voices, are you all ready to sing? Let's start off the show with Rock-A-Bye Your Bear! Everyone ready!?” Charlie strums the chords on her guitar and the rest of them sing and clap along.
He’d never tell a soul, but he was deeply in love with Castiel.
“Yeah. You are here now… but you make these decisions. Stupid knee-jerk decisions and you leave me. Every time,” Dean states, his voice descends a register and becomes more broken.
“Dad,” Dean lets out a big breath he was holding while his Dad talked, “We talked about this months ago and you both said you’d support it. Charlie and Gabe are legit millionaires. The band has been established for the past twelve years, so it’s definitely a good career move. Not just that… but it’s a fantastic opportunity to leave Kansas, see the world. Hell, the signing bonus I got was more than what I made my first year as a teacher!”
this bastard definitely has done something to him.
Dean is quick to reach into the Lincoln and turn off the radio. He clears his throat a few times as his ice cream melts and runs down the side of his hand. Cold sticky tracks snake down his fingers and break him from his gazing off at nothing. Licking it off, Dean lets out a heavy sigh. Tonight feels like the end of a huge part of his life.
Now, he’s just trying to get Eileen to take him seriously. She’s been avoiding him, not that he blames her after the fiasco in the casino and learning that everything was orchestrated by Chuck. She needs her distance and Sam respects that. He does. He just wishes she’d truly talk to him rather than ride the waves of surface conversation.
“Gabriel,” Cas lets out a huge sigh, rolling his eyes upward, but his fingers are quick, typing something on the phone.
