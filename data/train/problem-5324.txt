“Don’t push yourself too hard, boy” he said softly. “Dean needs you alive.”
Sam knew the circumstances. He knew Dean had only wanted good. He hadn’t known back then how bad a turn everything would make. That was the only time he remembered Dean acting selfish. Apart from that? Selfless, selfless, selfless. Even in their childhood. He wondered how many things he still didn’t know about. How many times had Dean given up something so Sam’s life would be peaceful?
“It appears” Cas nodded, a smile playing on his lips too.
“Why don't we hear from our new friends?” Suzy smiled at Charlie. “Charlie, what brought you here to reclaim your virginity?”
Sam asked. He was already sitting at the table in the kitchen with an apple in his hand. Gadreel didn’t have to ask what Sam wanted to know because he soon continued.
“Try renting a car.”
I narrow my eyes. Did the Campbells know the Men of Letters? Were they allies or something? Or was that just because of the angels and their big plans to make John Winchester and Mary Campbell fall in love and create the vessels of Michael and Lucifer? The world may never know.
Dean was still not convinced. Moreover, he looked personally offended.
“Gadreel? Who is it?”
Cas shook his head.
Castiel paced, his patience running short. He didn’t have any time to explain. Susie would die soon.
Dean watched him in silence. His face was unreadable and emotionless. It was similar to the look his of siblings when they possessed a vessel for the first time. Not knowing how to express thoughts and emotions with only their features they kept their face stoic.
(See the end of the chapter for
“What do you mean by those you knew?”
“Hey, D-Dawg.”
Crowley’s eyes were literally twinkling by hearing those news.
The waitress – Ann Marie, Sam read her nametag, – shifted uncomfortably, casting down her eyes at the pad in her hand.
A loud gasp then a scream was heard behind Sam. The man, covering his ears, turned around and saw none other than Becky Rosen. She looked older. Much older than the last time he had seen her. Her hair was short, it was a very boyish cut, and even her cloths looked more hunter-like than the way she usually dressed. But what stayed was the glint in her eyes when she looked at him that never promised any good.
“It’s okay, Cas” he put a hand on the angel’s shoulder and squeezed it. “It’s okay.”
Susie watched him for a while, face pale, eyes wider than humanly possible. She blinked a few times then looked away. At the floor, the curtain, back at the floor, the ceiling, then she started laughing. It wasn’t a desperate, maniac laughter but a sincerely happy one.
Dean nodded thoughtfully.
The next few entries are about the same things. Alice blaming herself for her sister’s death, her nightmares getting worse, not knowing where Carrol and Elle was, Bumby being a dick, Lisa supporting her. All the entries are short, straight to the point. Where was the mysterious woman then? According to Alice’s file, she had documented every one of their meetings but there was nothing.
Castiel looked away.
I almost lose it right at the moment I see him.
It was nightfall in Oz. The Emerald City glittered in the red light of the setting sun that colored the land in that warm color everywhere she looked.
Hannah’s jaw tightened and Sam rubbed the back of his neck.
“I know how I can find out the identity of the spy” she cut in.
Sam opened his mouth to protest but Cas was already climbing out the window, sitting on the door and Sam wanted to pull him back because it was NOT an action movie where a single bullet could stop a van.
The woman sat on the couch that night. Her face was damp but her eyes were dry. She ran out of tears to shed. She sunk into a grief so deep that crying was not possible anymore. She only existed in the dark room surrounded by silence and emptiness. There was nothing to live for anymore.
Castiel turned to Dean.
“Denying that we have problems and wait for it to snap any minute.”
small detour.”
the one he was hugging.
“I couldn’t destroy the tablet in time. When Metatron told me that he…” Castiel’s vision blurred. “You died because of me. You became a demon because of me. I failed you. I just want to die, Dean.”
“Was anything tied around the journal?” Castiel asked. “A ribbon, perhaps?”
“The woods sounds good.”
This was the moment when Sonny peeked inside. They must had been a great sight by the look on his face. A kid in the middle of the room hugging an action figure like his life depended on it, a dizzy woman with a guitar case at her feet still trying to find balance and two men helping a third standing. Also tools all over the place.
“So you’re here because?” Dean asked again. He tried to sit up but fell back immediately on the pillow. The Fate looked Dean in the eyes who after a short time looked away uncomfortably.
Sam chuckled with honest happiness. Maybe he even had tears in his eyes too but he was exhausted to notice them or care to wipe them away.
Sam continued,
“Sam!”
The angel didn’t move for a long while, making sure that Dean was indeed sleeping peacefully. The man’s breathing was slow and even, his features softer than during the nightmare. Castiel brushed away the wetness under Dean’s eyes with his thumbs, then moved to sit down next to his right. If not for still being sleepy, Dean would have kicked him of off himself. He had been invading Dean’s personal space in a very inappropriate way.
“It’s like in the Lord of the Rings” he sighed then added when he saw Meg’s questioning look “Men, Elves, Dwarves and Hobbits had to put away their differences and work together to defeat the forces of Sauron. You did that too.”
“Dean Winchester.”
“What have you done?” he asked and shook his head in disappointment.
Thomas was silent for a moment.
Castiel smiled at him sadly.
Castiel looked down at his lap. Dean deserved so much better, not a mother burning on the ceiling, decades in Hell and a destiny he hadn’t want anything to do with. He deserved to be happy, live in peace, be loved. But the only things he got were pain and tears.
“It reminds me of the time after Jess died.”
The girl blinked.
A week passed in a blink. Castiel became friends with Charlie who made him play some video games with her and Kevin. It took a while for him to learn how to use the controller but he managed.
weaker.”
The demon with the hipster glasses glared at him with his widened eyes when he realized an angel was at his doorstep. Del pulled out his phone and was about to dial a number but Gadreel reached out with Sam’s arm and a stone flew rapidly towards the demon which then hit a hole through the phone.
The young woman hit the man’s arm gently.
chest and in the process his
There was a light in Sonny’s eyes Castiel couldn’t put anywhere. He watched the former angel without blinking for a long moment then he all of a sudden patted him on his shoulder and grinned at him.
“I… I know… I saw them…” Dean sighed and looked up. “I… wanted to talk with you…”
Watching him as a human,
“I still don’t think we can trust them” he muttered. “That Sariel can make you her… zir – zir? – goon with a touch. What if ze finds them? Or. What if they’re already under zir control?”
“Me too?” Kevin patted Sam’s back while he looked up at Dean questioningly but the man’s vision was blurred too. Dean quickly turned away, pulled up his sleeve on his right arm and looked at it. Nothing. The Mark of Cain wasn’t there. They did it. They really did it.
Hannah nodded.
“There are, but Cronus was the most powerful of them all. He was the only pagan deity who could have helped us” the angel explained and exhaled slowly. “If only the angels got their wings back… We could ask Hannah to send us back.”
Dorothy showed her a pleased smirk. As a female hunter, she had to prove her capability. She had to know everything she could face one day and show the men who wore the trousers.
“Who are you?” I repeat my question.
“Ready.”
The nurse was annoying as hell. She asked a lot of questions he didn’t want to answer to and it took her more than half an hour to finally leave him alone.
Dean blinked a few times. He was not expecting this.
“It’s good to see you again, Kevin” he said and squeezed his shoulder.
kill Gavin. He hoped that his brother had lied a few days before but now the demon confirmed it. Dean was more lost then they had thought.
“Of course you want to” he declared.
The other didn’t react for a
“Yeah, I guess.” He looked up at the ceiling. “Good to be myself again. I was an embarrassing kid.”
“Someone who once told me to not blame myself if anything bad happens” he said with a low voice. Sam didn’t realize he spoke out loud until something clenched his throat tightl. Somehow saying it made everything more real and unchangeable. He quickly cleared his throat.
He didn’t want to think too much about anything regarding the two of them. It was good right now. They were both in the bunker, Cas wasn’t away all the time for angel business and Dean wasn’t running around with the First Blade in his hand having demonic fun. But Cas was dying again and he was hiding something, and it hurt a bit that Cas hadn’t said anything yet. Didn’t he trust him? He could help. He would find a way. Cas just needed to say a word and he would be there for him.
He sometimes wondered how different his life would be if there hadn’t been any supernatural creatures running around. If there hadn’t been angels and demons and God and Plans and a destiny he never wanted. When that djinn had captured him, he had seen a world like that. His mother alive, Jess alive, hot girlfriend… But that was it. His relationship with Sam was horrible and his life… Now he wondered… Had that been only a world he had thought he deserved and were only capable of, and the djinn thought that was what he wanted? Bobby had said he would have gone to MIT if he weren’t so selfless. Was he, or now maybe, had he been really MIT material? Ash had gone to MIT, and he had been an… interesting person. But he had been a great help with the Yellow Eyes case. Dean was good with cars, he had rebuilt Baby countless times. And Frank had taught him one or two tricks and he had learnt those fast. And he had built an EMF from a walkman. And when he had stayed at Sonny’s he loved going to school and loved learning new things. And… And…
Sam swallowed nervously. Hannah was clearly angry. Her eyes were narrowed, her fists clenched. There were many things Sam didn’t want to face, and the angry angel was one of them.
The last lines were blurred by tear drops.
But it seemed, as always, that plans were easily destroyed by outside forces.
“Yeah.” Dean was silent for a moment. He glanced at Sam then quickly looked away. “Do you… Do you remember what you said after we left?”
But in the end he nodded and gave the mental image to her too. He could only hope that this Hannah’s fate would be better.
Castiel sighed and smiled. Until then they would enjoy every moment of the remaining days.
He looked awful, he had to admit. His skin was pale and red at the same time, making a sick combination of the two colors. Gadreel put a hand on his chest and Sam felt his own irregular and weak heartbeat.
But I can’t see him anywhere. He must have left not long after I went back to the barn.
Castiel gasped for air as he woke and looked around with wide eyes, searching for something. Then his gaze settled on the two of them and he sunk back in the armchair. Hannah could see sadness and disappointment in his eyes.
Kevin laughed without any positive emotions in his voice.
Garth fainted after that. He was lucky Sam already held his arms otherwise he would have hit his head hard into the staircase.
Dean had taken a deep breath. No pressure. They had to do this on the first try, no failure accepted.
His silence made Dean impatient. The man stood up and though the height difference wasn’t that much between them he towered over the former angel.
Castiel turned his back where he heard Muriel’s voice then raised his blade, ready to fight. The angels didn’t move silently. Maybe now, that they were detected, they didn’t feel the need to hide themselves. They probably didn’t know Muriel had come too and they had originally planned to attack Castiel in the shadows. Which raised a question. Was Muriel warded against angels too?
The day passed in silence. Sam walked up and down the bunker, not sure what he was supposed to do. He took a pillow from Kevin’s room and put it under the teen’s head. Went to the kitchen and made a salad which he didn’t eat right away. Back to Kevin’s room, took a blanket, tucked him in. Kitchen again, ate the salad. Checked on Kevin, passed by the dungeon, listened if Crowley was making any sounds, back to the library.
“I was the one who put back together your body and soul piece by piece with my Grace.”
Dean absently rubbed his chest.
“Shut up” he said under his breath. His hands holding the Colt shook in anger. But the demon didn’t listen to him.
“Then shoot me, you son of a…!” I take a step closer when I say it.
“Oh, I like sneaking inside buildings!”
Cas’ face softened and Dean knew he agreed with him. They had been both fallen into the trap of Crowley’s manipulation. They had both come out of that as losers. But…
“You’re an adult again.”
Bobby sighed and stood up. He didn’t move for a while then without really thinking about it put a hand on the angel’s head and ruffled the dark hair.
“Bet you’re a closet Brony.”
“Not that one, I can tell you.”
“No, it’s good” he reassured her quickly.
Becky arched a brow and suddenly she looked way too serious.
He could try doing things he had never had the opportunity to do before. He could discover new things he would like, new hobbies. He could try to have a life like every normal person.
I nod, also unsure.
“They can’t rest a bit, can they?” Linda shook her head. “Always running somewhere.”
“What if there isn’t?” he asked.
“It looks bad” Cas said, referring to his back. “But Gadreel can heal you.”
No, Abaddon had black eyes, Lilith had white and Crowley has red. Maybe when the book was written the writer didn’t know about this.
Kevin woke to a door opening then closing. He forced his eyes open and found himself at the table with a pillow under his head and a blanket covering his back. Despite the place he had been sleeping he felt himself well rested. In fact, he hadn’t slept that well in a long time. The teen sat up and stretched. He expected that his back would ache like hell but nothing. That was not natural. And anything not natural around the Winchesters was connected to something supernatural.
He didn’t know if he could really fight this entity. They had found nothing about it other than how to enter this realm. If this thing was really God level or stronger he had no chance against it.
Kevin looked up. The tag on the shelf informed him that he was at the ‘Lez–Lif’ section. His eyes quickly wandered through every box until finally they settled on one name.
He turned away and left in a hurry. He felt shameful for not thinking about her for years.
“Dean Winchester” she started and Dean felt himself becoming smaller. He braced himself for the mother’s rage. “If you ever again think that you could redeem yourself by giving up your humanity, I’ll kick you into an other timeline then kick you again.”
Sam noticed the movement and glanced at her. She saw his respiration became slower and longer as Hannah’s hand got closer to him. The angel felt the magnetic field around his tense body, drawing her closer to him.
“For a month! Can you believe that?”
I fly across the room at hit the wall hard. I groan in pain as I try to pull myself together.
“NO!” Dean shrieked. “I DON’T WANT TO WASH MY HAIR!”
Dean clenched his jaw and focused on the Grace again without looking at it. It was not that far from him. His injury would keep him from snatching it away fast, but he had to try it. Just a well executed jump there and it would be in his hand. Then what? He had no weapons. Maybe he could get Metatron’s blade. It was somewhere hidden in his right sleeve. If he grabbed the Grace, Metatron would try to get it back, then in the scuffle he would take it from him.
“I’m a grown-up.” Even though he sometimes acted childish and annoyed Sam to hell.
“Which means if we don’t find your Grace in time, you’ll burn out.”
He was about to lift Sam by his arm when he heard a stick breaking. Dean looked up.
“What?”
Sam turned his attention back to the road, so Castiel guessed the conversation was over. He looked away too, watching the landscape, listening to the soft snores behind him, deep in his thoughts.
“I thought you might get hungry on the way back” Cas shrugged and with a switch of the key the engine awoke.
Ed fought back a snort when he heard the Winchester muttering something under his breath.
Slenderman.
“Why did he say that? Back in the diner?”
There it was. The conversation he knew was coming. Becky was always a crazy fan of them. She would probably express her undying love for him, how she always dreamed about marrying him and…
“Okay kid. You’ll have time for fangirling later.”
His brother raised a brow at that but didn’t comment. Instead, Charlie turned back to him with a huge grin.
Castiel felt his blood turning into an icy river in his veins. His throat became so dry suddenly that at first he couldn’t make any sound.
“Go ahead.”
Sam entered the library with Hannah following him. They both looked startled by the mysterious roaring.
“For what?”
The last third of the chapter, the part starting with Metatron taking his blade in his hand, was written more than a year (!) ago, before the first chapter was published. Every time I write, I start with the most important parts of the story, and this was one of the many. Because this one event will lead to the landslide that is Act Four. But before that, Act Three has one last chapter yet.
Now then. Lucifer is in the cage. Abaddon and Belphegor are dead. I’m gonna kill Belzebub, Mammon and Asmodeus. What about Sariel?
“I don’t know” he answered. “Someone knocked me out.”
“And look what happened. A civil war, the Leviathans, the Fall. All because you thought you can make everything better. All because you hungered for power.”
It was the angel.
I smirk at him. Act natural, act natural…
I lean on my forearms, getting more comfortable and casual.
“Now, Lee” she purred. “You know how to flatter a girl.”
“Don’t ‘
“I…” he continued. “I did a lot of stupid things. Like treating you like shit many times. And knowing that you always came back feels kinda bad, you know? I shouldn’t have done those things to my best friend.”
angel had informed them about the ripple and how he and the Winchesters had been sent back in time. He had also told them about Metatron and the game he had played with all of them in that other future. Hannah had her doubts regarding the reliability of Castiel. He was a human now. And humans lied.
“Hey, Ruth, would you, uh, please go check on the boys, make sure their morning chores are getting done?” Sonny asked.
-“Don’t worry, honey, you’re in good hands.”
I scratch the tabletop and try not to see Gavin’s expression. Being let down by a parent, a father, is no news to me. The bitter taste of realization that you are not as important to him as you long to be. That no matter what you do, you would never be the son they would love no matter what.
Nora walked away and took her phone out from her pocket. Castiel assumed she was about to call the doctor.
“With us” he said the words he had wanted to say the last time they had met. “He’s safe.”
The man, still mesmerized by the place, directed his attention to Cas. The angel’s face was paler than usual and he was round-eyed with shock. But there was something else in his gaze too. Something Sam only saw when…
“Then we have to find out what he wants.”
’ he said to the angel.
the chanting.
Dean shoved away this memory.
“Castiel” I say, trying to lock out any emotions from my voice.
“Nice to meet you, Timmy.” Dean held out his right hand.
“Sooner or later you would have left anyway. Take care! You know my number. Call whenever you want.”
Bobby was so stunned he didn’t even think about kicking that damn boy in the ass. But he so deserved it.
Sam’s face confirmed it. The boy looked back at his book with a bittersweet smile on his face. So Emmanuel didn’t remember anything yet because he had never met Dean. With a sigh Bobby continued reading too. The angel would never meet the hunter and still…
“I’ll bring some ice” he said and was about to walk away when Cas started speaking.
“I’m sorry, Nora” he apologized. “I’m…meeting a friend.”
“I failed you, Dean.” Dean was about to cut in but he continued. “I failed you many times. I didn’t trust you when I should have. I thought I’d do good if I don’t disturb you and your normal life but in the end I betrayed you. I hurt your brother. I hurt you. And I killed you.”
So he took Cas’ hand as soon as he got to him and started running, pulling Cas with him, not caring when the angel protested.
The angel observed the human.
Dean became smaller with each word until he felt like a little kid scolded by some fearsome authority figure.
“Seriously? You saw Frozen?”
“Is that all?”
“Yeah, let’s take a break. I need some sleep too. Tonight at the same time?”
“Do you have a car?” the former angel asked once they were outside. He checked him phone quickly. Colorado Springs. They could be there in an hour if they were lucky.
It didn’t sting. No. The pain erupted like a volcano inside him.
Sam couldn’t do anything but trust Cas and drove as careful as he could. He didn’t want Cas to fall out. But he stepped on the gas too. If Cas was about to do what Sam was thinking about, they needed more distance.
Dean sighed. Second chances, honesty, no lies, no fuck ups.
As Sam was still laying there Ms. Tran kneeled down next to him.
Charlie nodded with understanding, took the Impala’s keys, then left the diner with her friend. Then Jody stepped to Sam with a questioning gaze.
“You like what you see? I must say you look better than most of us. You’re a human with a lot of black but you’re still one of us.”
Dean shook his head and turned away, showing his back to Castiel once again.
And Dean looked okay too. The shadow seemed to pass away and the man could finally act normal again. No.
What if the ripple already reached her up in Heaven? What if she wasn’t the Hannah he knew anymore? What if she didn’t remember anything like Garth? What if he would never see her again?
“Yes…” he breathes out, his voice sounding unusually high.
“I understand.” The angel paused, downcasting his eyes. “But I should be the one to apologize. I threatened Dean with his brother to send you away. I was afraid that you might sell me out to the other angels. And when I, the other me, met Metatron who promised a new start in a new Heaven… That me should’ve been more careful. Not so naïve. My love for humanity was used against me. Again. I have no intentions to justify myself, the mistake was made by me, but I honestly believed Lucifer meant no harm when I let him inside the Garden. He was always a good brother. He looked after us unlike the other archangels. He used to be my favorite brother. His betrayal hurts more than anything. I should have trusted you and the Winchesters instead of those whose promises there were good to be true.”
The demon raised the weapon above his head to then strike down but it fell out of his hand as his face shined up with a yellow light just like the hound’s moments earlier. The demon’s body followed the blade to the ground, revealing non other than Linda Tran with an other blade in her tight grip. The short Asian woman glared at the lifeless meat suit like she wanted to set it on fire by just one look. Sam was sure she could do it.
“Can you look into my head?” he asked.
Bobby took a deep breath and rubbed his face in an attempt to calm down. He turned to Cas then.
The demon in the trap turned to have a look around.
“It’s okay, Dean.” He let go of his wrists and cupped his cheeks instead. “It’s okay now. Sleep. Rest. Nothing will disturb you.”
Castiel looked behind him and saw Bobby climbing out to the roof.
He didn’t know who was after him but they were determined to catch up with him. He heard the footsteps following him wherever he went. The owner wasn’t running like him but it was getting louder and louder.
He couldn’t read her face, it was like something carved out of marble. She didn’t say anything so he continued.
Around noon they were
“No more words, handmaiden! I forbid any spoilers to leave your mouth!”
“It does! Did you want to kill yourself or what?”
“If you’re okay with it, we can get some shelves.”
“Wait…” Sam brushed back his hair in a way to calm himself down but his fingers were still trembling. “Are you saying that we should…”
Sam was silent for a long while. He tightened his jaw, eyes fixed on the road then he finally looked at him, eyes heavy with sadness.
“I’m sorry.”
“You were driving?” Sam asked with honest shock.
“And what do you think?” he asks. His voice is calm, but there’s an edge in it I had never heard from him. Like he has a grudge against me. “Whose fault is that exactly?”
But Castiel hadn’t been that kind of an angel. He had always questioned orders and hadn’t run into battles blindly. Especially after he had met Dean. And to be honest, he didn’t miss being an angel. Of course he missed his ability to heal others but having all those feelings and senses… It was a part of him and he would miss those. He had already experienced losing them. He preferred to be a human. And Hannah, this Hannah, wouldn’t understand the significance of it until she experienced it.
“Which one?”
But death didn’t come. On the contrary, the pain eased and was gone in a portion of a second. Kevin opened his eyes and looked at the angel with confusion who watched him with great concern.
Mom placed me on the ground, and I orientated myself. I saw Dean a little bit away from the hospital truck, with a wailing bundle in his arms – Sammy. Uncle John and Aunt Mary weren’t anywhere around.
He was talking about the guilt Lady Macbeth was experiencing, the blood that she imagined on her hands. How all her deceit and schemes were catching up with her. I could relate to Lady Macbeth. Everyday Dean and I didn’t speak, the tenser it became between us. I could taste it in the air when he walked into the classroom from Amanda’s jealousy and confusion, from Dean’s heated looks, from the way he licked his lips when he knew I was watching him. It was an intense game of Chicken.
The lady who responded sounded like she could sing well, “Coming!”
“Can I please go play cars, Daddy?” My voice was small after Dean’s fast parade of words.
One of my earliest memories is meeting Dean Winchester.
He had a swagger in his step, like he knew what the finish line looked like, so he took his time. His hair was kept short unlike most of the boys in the school.
“What do you mean they’re not here?”
“Chuck Novak. And this is my wife, Amelia. We were walking past and… your son was talking about playing cars?”
Dean puts down the lighter. Takes the cigarette from my mouth and douses it. But he doesn’t move his hand, and he doesn’t look away.
One of my earliest traumas also involved Dean Winchester.
Dean’s smile is radiant, and my heart grew three sizes that day, “Great.”
The flame is reflected in his eyes, and I nearly forget to breathe in when he lights the cigarette. Except, the moment right after her lights the cigarette, his hand is on my thigh, his fingers, kneading the muscle there. I take short gasp and choked on the smoke. It tastes disgusting. Dean watches with a little sympathy, a little humour, and hand still on my thigh until I stop cough.
He grabbed my wrist and started dragging me towards and up the stairs, “Come on, Cas.”
Mom and Dad looked at each other with unreadable expressions. They looked at each other for another second before Dad said, “Lead the way.”
Dean kept talking to her in between Breytenbach’s droning voice, saying charming things, shocking things that made Amanda shake her head fondly at him as if she’d known him forever, and this was just how Dean was.
My mother’s hand was on my shoulder. “Don’t ask so many questions, Castiel,” she said sharply.
Before he answered he smile tightened at the edges as if he was fighting to keep it upright and solid. Amanda might have seen the tightness but she did not retract her question.
Dean.
A few seconds later, a beautiful, blonde lady filled the doorway. Her blonde was wrapped in a bun. She was wearing jeans – I didn’t know then that ladies wore jeans – with a white top that had mud on it. She smiled sweetly at Mom and Dad and stuck out her hand.
Ms Mary looked down at Dean, who just smiled up at her, his freckles mixing and mashing with each other. She shook her head, but there was a fond smile on her face like she expected this of him, but still couldn’t believe he did it, “Did he now?”
“Wh- wh- where are they, mommy? Where? Where?”
Dad took me off his shoulders and placed me on the ground. I readjusted my pants, and Mom tucked my shirt back in. We made our way up Dean’s wooden stairs. Dean pushed the door open and shouted into the house, “Mommy! There are guests.”
But, I’m not that brave.
my mother would ask.
“I mean, they moved somewhere else.”
It all happens in a single moment.
was a coincidence.
“Let me tell you about Montana, that was fun, for a bit.” He takes a deep drag of the cigarette, the end of glowing red against the dusk light. I don’t usually find smoking attractive – it’s literally allowing a thing no bigger than a pen to steal your life away – but the way Dean did it made it different. It was just as reckless, but that didn’t feel like a bad thing. He had pulled one from the box stuffed in his jacket pocket and went to sit on my window sill, and when he breathed out the smoke, I wanted nothing more but to put my mouth over his and inhale it. That thought bulldozed into my mind like an unwanted guest and would not leave. I started getting hard thinking about it.
” I said a little louder.
“But-”
. It didn’t make sense with just the two of them. Their new house had beige walls instead of blue, mom’s room had a new bed, I had fewer posters up, there was just one couch, and there were fewer photos. In the interest of being completely honest, Mom and I weren’t dealing well with Dad’s death, but we tried. She tried. But, I guess nothing prepares you for what she went through that year. 1974: pregnant with baby boy James, but she miscarried in the middle of her second Trimester, then Dad died on what should have been the birthdate. That would be enough to rattle anyone to the core and displace their life. I was just happy she got out of bed and took herself to work, and cooked food, and showed me how to do it as well, even if we didn’t talk much otherwise.
“Fair enough.”
My dad would put me on his shoulders and I would reach towards the blue-blue sky, stretching my body, never touching it.
“No, not really.”
He sighed and got bored eventually of trying to get my attention and taps the shoulder of the girl in front of him. She turns. Amanda Heckerling. Blonde and perfect, and annoyingly kind, who had never even given me a funny look.
to play cars?”
“I jog.” I don’t believe I am capable of more than those two syllables.
He was about to reply but a sudden voice called out. I looked around for the voice and saw a boy sitting on the porch of the house with the lovely lavenders. He had honey brown hair, but when he ran into the sun, blonde streaks appeared.
“Ever gotten a blowjob from a boy?” A numb shake of my head.
His brashness, rich voice, and secret smile leave me speechless, but I would be lying if I said it did not make him more of an enigma, one I wanted to examine closely and break apart and put back together piece by piece to find out what made it work.
Mom and Dad were taking me on a walk around the neighbourhood, pointing out different things.
“Dean and Castiel, come on!” Mr Breytenbach’s voice is reprimanding. “It’s the first lesson of the semester, have some respect for the rest of the class, and stop gossiping! You girls can do that over tea and biscuits later.” Breytenbach was an unnecessary hardass sometimes, but I didn’t like where Dean and I were going – you got in trouble for that in Indiana, that’s why I shoved them deep, deep down – so I focused on the projected presentation. I kept my head facing forward, no matter how hard Dean’s eyes bore into the side of my head.
“I’m returning back to Heaven for a while” she announced. “I’m bringing some other books and scrolls from the archive.”
Sam didn’t expect to find a crowd in the library. He saw familiar faces, mainly hunters he had met once or twice like Irv and Tamara, but there were some he didn’t know.
They arrive sometime around midnight to the field with the abandoned building. They parked right next to the Impala and as soon as Dean got out the car he stretched. Damn, his knees and back would ache for days for sure.
A quake shook Heaven. Hannah looked at the ceiling from where dust fell down.
“I think I know who she is” she explained with an excited tone and left.
“What happened to him?”
“According to Cas” Dean muttered to Dorothy as he passed her, but for an angel’s ears it was loud enough. Cas sent him a disapproving look when he turned to look back at him. But what Dean had said was enough for Dorothy to not trust their guests at all. Sam saw her hold tighten around Charlie and her eyes never left the angels.
I missed my own anger. After so many months feeling only what the Mark of Cain generated, I welcome it warmly. This anger is righteous. This anger has a meaning, not only a thirst for blood. It’s anger caused by the fact that this piece of shit used my best friend again.
“Look” he started after a deep breath. “I know you’ve been through a lot and I respected your wish to not talk about anything but I’m worried. You have nightmares, you have panic attacks and lock yourself into your room.” Sam turned to his brother who still showed him the back of his head. “We have to talk.”
“Why do I have to be the one to teach him how to use the toilet?!”
“Nothing is set in stone” he said, holding her gaze. “Michael and Lucifer were supposed to have their battle years ago, but now both of them are in the Cage. It is up to us how we shape our future and not because a divine power said so.”
Opening the Cage meant Lucifer would be free again. Nothing guaranteed that he would help him cure Dean. But if Sam made a deal that he would only say yes when Lucifer took back the Mark of Cain then maybe he would do it. Lucifer wanted Sam. He would do anything to get him. And maybe he could save Adam too. Two brothers’ lives for his own was a good deal. But there was Michael too. But maybe Michael could help them restore time. He could send back Dean and Cas to stop Abaddon. But why would he do that? Michael had blown up Cas the last time. And he was still probably angry at Dean for not saying yes to him. Or saying yes then running away.
The former angel collected the man into his arms to have a closer look at him. Dean was pale with a hint of grey. His breathing was shallow and forced while cold sweat was running down his face. He seemed to be… exhausted.
“Of course you think I’m not myself” I sigh. “Which is true in a way so let’s correct it. Of course you think I’m possessed. A human turning into a demon? Yeah, impossible. But guess what! It’s not. I’m me.” I pull up my right sleeve to show the Mark. “See this nasty here? Brought me back like this.”
“Will you read me a bedtime story?”
Cas’ room was right next to his. It was lit by just a little lamp on the nightstand but he could clearly see the form shivering under the blankets. Dean’s heart clenched in his chest. Cas was in pain. Because of him. Again.
It was a hell of a drive and both of them wanted to get to the end of it as soon as possible.
Gadreel didn’t understand Sam’s words but no matter how curious he was he didn’t look into the man’s thoughts. He waited patiently until they name the subject of their conversation.
“Why?” he asked with a low voice. He didn’t want the other angel to hear how angry he became just hearing the demon’s name, but he knew the shake in his voice gave away his emotions.
Castiel’s eyes opened wide. He knew this voice. The deep purr of a feline, caressing, but under the silkiness it hid something dark, some shady thoughts.
Harry nodded and glued his gaze back to the screen, his irises not far from taking the shape of a heart.
The angels turned to the opened door. Dean was leaning down, looking at them with raised brows, watching one then the other carefully.
Charlie joined in.
“Time is what we lack” she declared. “Abaddon is taking over Hell. Metatron wants the angel tablet. And now there’s someone who can control angels and the one who banished Gadreel from his vessel.”
Daphne frowned.
“Try not to spit out your lungs!”
“Dean, NO!”
“The Leviathans are here” he hushed.
He heard footsteps approaching him. Sam looked up to see Del hovering above him with gloat.
“What is it?” Sam asked curiously to which Crowley laughed without any feeling in it.
‘No. The warding prevents me from knowing about the inside of the building.’
“Can we make a small detour?”
“No, she wasn’t. She was not destined to die yet. She will live for sixty more years, mother of three, grandmother of seven.”
Charlie grinned.
It slices through it like it was only butter.

I slowly, and maybe a bit theatrically, turn around and look that ugly son of a bitch in the eyes.
believe in him. The ones he had betrayed so many times. He lost their trust more than once and he doubted he ever gained it back. He had only sunk deeper.
He didn’t show it, but Dean was going through a difficult time. He was still dealing with the aftermath of his demonic times. He had seen him scratching his forearm many times in the past few days. Castiel wasn’t sure if Dean noticed it at all. It was like the movement came absently to him from a deep instinct and it scared Castiel. What if they were still not out of that hole? What if Dean’s soul was somehow still attached to the Mark, even though it wasn’t burnt into his skin now?
A hand on his stopped him. Dean looked into the blue eyes of the fallen angel who fixed his gaze on him, not letting him turn away.
“You know how humans are so flawed creatures” he explained. “When a pure angel gets too close to them, the human corrupts the angel’s Grace. Like how our dear Castiel’s Grace was corrupted. And that’s why he was perfect.”
I lean him back against the wall and place my palms on his chest, concentrating on the image of Cas’ true form in a much brighter way. Which is quite impossible. Even in its unhealthy condition I can’t really understand what I’m seeing exactly, but I try my best.
What if his fear would turn out to be true? What if Dean was still a demon?
“Red” he said with a low voice and turned fully towards the other woman. “I’m serious. There’s peace in Oz but this right here? Anything could happen tomorrow or the day after. We can’t both leave them in the time of need, you must understand that.”
The angel winced. The demon’s voice was monotone, but it still hurt. He closed his eyes for a moment to gather some hidden strength than looked back at Dean.
when he cut down his next
The other looked at him
What exactly does Cas want with the Colt? Threaten to shoot me if I don’t do what he says? Kill me?
Dorothy couldn’t help but smile at that.
“Come on, Cas! Let’s draw!”
“I wrote the story after all.” The angel motioned around with his arm like he was playing in a Greek drama, performing an important speech. “The human in Dean Winchester dies by the hands of the new God who then kills the heartbroken Castiel with the same blade. Of course the Mark of Cain brings Dean back to life as a Knight, that would have been in the second book, who then goes on a rampage on Earth. But fear not! God, kind and just, descends from Heaven and locks away the beast where it belongs.” Metatron paused and clenched his fist. “Into the Cage.”
Dean pulled a hand down his face and the ‘I’m a hunter, not an emotionally conflicted giant baby’ mask was back on his face.
Theo moved his head away whenever Sam tried to feed him with some soup.
“Do you know her?” he asked. “I mean, she used to be an Archangel of Death, you’re working for Death…”
Dean smiled at that and stepped away. He was getting ready to disappear when Meg walked to him.
“Good to see you too, Tara.” And with a smug smile the demon took the seat next to the woman. Tara growled and turned to Bobby who held up a hand in a calming manner.
Theo shifted his weight on his feet.
Sam frowned at him then he smiled smugly.
Charlie pouted at that and Dorothy had to hold back a laugh.
that would have made his mother smile and hug him lovingly, saying she was happy for him. The
Cas took a shaky breath. Dean could feel him lifting his right hand, his palm getting so close to his face, almost touching it—
will show that weakling what I’m capable of.
“I’ll take him to a spare room” Sam said as he put one of Garth’s arms around his neck. Cas did the same with the other. “I’ll explain everything to him when he wakes up. I’ll call you.”
“Thank you” Cas said with a small smile on his face.
Susie was still in shock. She watched her still bleeding wound, mesmerized by the way the red liquid soaked her jeans.
The night found Castiel sitting on the roof of the bunker. He came across this place not so long ago and grew to like it immediately. It provided him the privacy he needed to think through everything. Or to just stare down at the small town of Lebanon above the trees. The humans down there lived so peacefully, not knowing what took place in the bunker in the meantime.
Hannah stepped closer and examined the handle. She had observed how humans open these doors during her walk. She only had to mimic their movements. And with that she succeeded. With a proud smile on her face she sat inside and slammed the door too, but she made extra care not to ruin it.
“I’ve met teenagers who had to grow up too fast but their mental and emotional growth was delayed because of that. Unfortunately, there are a lot of them out there. It’s part of my job to help everyone, including them if they let me.”
“Please, don’t do this to me” I plead, but my words find deaf ears.
the man answered and looked around. He found a timetable not so far from them and he made his way there.
The younger Winchester brother shook his head in disbelief. Not just the opening the Cage plan, but where the hell the fighting with Cas had come from? The angel was a great friend and he respected him for not holding any grudges against him.
“I spent the last two Earth days in Heaven” Hannah said. “I observed the behavior of every angel I could and kept an eye on the prison entrance but nothing.” She tilted her head. “But why would Metatron want to stop us? The ripple would erase him too.”
Then Metatron arched a brow and the angel blade sled into his grip.
good use of that knowledge.
Theo quickly took the key from his pocket and opened the cuffs. Finally free, Castiel rubbed his aching wrists.
“I met her as a demon” he said. “Didn’t treat her well.”
Elisa opened her eyes and looked around. The room bathed in a bright light she couldn’t tell where it came from. But she could look into it without squinting which was impossible.
Just Hannah didn’t.
This weekend the fic reached 100k words. That never happened before.
Dean didn’t find the courage to say anything because goddamnit, he didn’t deserve this. He didn’t deserve anything. Especially not this.
“This storage room contains the reports of those cases that occurred before this place was built” she explained. “I thought maybe there was something about that woman Dean and Castiel talked about.”
A collective laughter was the answer to that. Castiel moved his hand away, his eyes still had to adjust to the light but he could see the one who spoke earlier.
Dean stared at Cas for a long tense moment then let out that tension with a long exhale. Chuck had called Cas self-hating. And he really did hate himself for every little and big thing in the past. He’d seen it in the Empty, seen every memory, seen a broken angel praying for a God that never cared about him.
She stepped back, eyes wide with shock. Words and pictures whirled in her head, many appearing before her eyes and ringing in her ears at the same time.
Kevin turned to his stomach and buried his face into the pillow. He felt so small and Sam and Dean didn’t help with it, they just made everything worse. Especially Dean. He wanted to appear like some kind of parental figure and just ordered and forbid and never listened to him. He didn’t mean that he didn’t appreciate his concern but he was not a kid. He had ended being a kid the moment he had become a prophet. A prophet who couldn’t translate that
“You’re being watched” he said.
“No” Sam looked at his watch. Nine minutes. “She can be here in any second.”
In the next moment Sam was thrown back against the wall by an invisible force. Dean wanted to rush there, see if his brother was alright but he couldn’t move. The arms were still around him.
And after reliving the greatest pain he had ever felt…
and broke and smashed
Ann Marie puts away the sponge-cloth and turns to an other man at the counter to refill his glass. Looking back at me she tilts her head.
“Ephraim” Castiel carefully walked between him and the teen protectively, eyes never leaving the other’s. “I know it’s your first time on Earth and there are many things you don’t understand. This is one of them. Humans feel physical and emotional pain and both ease by time.”
“I suggest you to not drive for at least three days” she said as she wrote a prescription. “Rest plenty, drink three liters of water daily. Have three meals or six small meals a day. I’ll give you a list of foods you can eat for at least a month before you can try other foods. I wrote a prescription of the medicines you should take. It would help normalizing and keeping your blood sugar level. And keep a package of grape sugar in your pocket so if you feel dizzy again you can eat one immediately.”
Bess let out a long breath and touched her forehead to Garth’s.
“The nurse said three days. The third day was yesterday.”
“So. I find you this Father Time. Why would it be good for me?”
Metatron was sitting next to him.
Asmodeus was the easiest to find from the three. I didn’t have to look for long; I found the demon in an ordinary strip bar. She – because the son of a bitch possessed a pretty brunette – smiles at me with her meat suit, but with her true form, those three ugly heads, she snarls at me, showing sharp teeth.
“What do you mean I’m not from the Host?!” Hannah asked, offended. Did Metatron just question her angelhood?!
Dean looked at the other Dean getting impaled again then back at Cas.
“Killed her siblings?” Dorothy asked. “What did she mean by that?”
“Muriel…” he started with a shake of his head but the angel cut in.
the needle was stabbed into
“He’s working for an angel called Bartholomew” Sam explained. “They’re manipulating people to say yes to angels.”
Sam rubbed his face around his mouth but the smile was still there behind his palm.
pocket. Dean made a face that was definitely not a bitch face.
“I don’t believe you.”
Thomas nodded too.
This momentarily effaced the demon’s anger.
They were sitting in the motel room for a long while now. The silence was uncomfortable, for Sam at least. Jody was sitting at the other side of the table, typing something furiously.
“Yes. He exists.”
Elisa looked around the room. Pictures in silver frames were placed above the fireplace. Her daughter’s smiling face looked back at her and Elisa didn’t have to think long.
“No!” Kevin said quickly when the angel was about to stand up. When Cas looked back at him questioningly, he continued. “I don’t trust her.”
“Prison?”
“Sam needs healing now. I can wait.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Castiel took a deep breath. When Crowley wanted to speak it usually meant he was planning something in the background. He had to learn it the hard way but now he could tell – hopefully – when the King of Hell was playing with them. Now he probably wanted Castiel to take part willingly or unwillingly in his plan. But that would not happen. Maybe he would listen to what he wanted to say but he would never join him. Never again.
Their way down the mountain ended with them falling into the ditch. The world was spinning around Dean and every part of his body hurt. But panic mode meant he didn’t care about any of this. As soon as they fell into the ditch, he was on his feet, dragging Sam with him. From time to time he looked back and around but the woman was nowhere to be seen.
The half smirk was back on Metatron’s face.
“Dean?” Castiel placed a hand carefully on the hunter’s shoulder and gently shook it. Dean didn’t react to that.
“How is he?” Sam asked.
“Leave her alone, Ephraim. She’s just a teenager with everyday problems. It’s normal for humans.”
There she was. A girl, little more than two years old, was running up and down the corridor. Her long curly brown hair was floating behind her, bouncing up and down with each step. She didn’t have any toys, the running itself entertained her. Her laughter was a melody of wind bells, her smile made the empty corridor much brighter.
Dean smiled too but it melted off his face quickly.
No need to shake like it’s freezing cold.
“He came to me. At first I didn’t want to use it because I believed in you, Dean. After everything you did I still believed in you!” The frown softens on his face. “I hoped that a part of the human that I knew and admired was still there hidden somewhere! I worked day and night without rest to find a cure for you!” Castiel shakes his head and adds with a low voice “I believed in you…”
“Let me see your head” Dean said and before he could protest the man was already there. He took Castiel’s head and gently forced him to bow. Castiel felt fingers brushing through his hair and he almost couldn’t stop a shiver that was about to run down his spine.
“We’re here” Castiel continued and got out of the car.
Crowley acted like he didn’t hear the question.
“That was because the ripple reached you.” Castiel fought back the nausea when he remembered that he had intentionally let the ripple alter the Winchester’s life all because of a meaningless and stupid war. “Now it didn’t. Yet.”
THE FUCK OUT OF ME!”
“That’s why you summoned me? To ask why I killed?” I pull up his right sleeve. The Mark is burning red on my forearm. It’s angry at Cas for being here, being too close to me, distracting me from what’s important. For example killing. I hold it back as much as I could. “I have the bloody Mark of Cain. The mark of a killer. Is that a good enough reason for you?”
“I’m so sorry…”
The world that was slowly merging with this one.
Castiel smiled too. Maybe he wasn’t as useless as he had thought the last time. He was capable of helping others without his Grace. Maybe he was thinking like this because being a human was not a new experience for him. He knew his limits and potentials. He knew his needs and emotions. And he honestly liked it. It was a shame most of the angels – poor Ephraim included – underestimated them. Their Father had told them to love these supposedly flawed creatures. And he loved them. He loved being with them and being one of them. The other angels should realize that being flawed made the humans the most perfect creations of God.
Sam glared at him then without looking at Cas he stormed away. Bobby didn’t watch him leaving. He lowered himself to one knee and looked at the angel.
“And-uh… Why did you fall?”
Castiel looked up. Dean was watching him, turning around on the front bench.
wanted to lead you. You don’t need a leader. I only meant to guide you for a while, but I was dragged into a meaningless war.” He took a deep breath. “I know everything that happened was my fault. I’m still paying back for it. But don’t think my actions were out of selfishness. I always wanted good for all of you.”
Crowley blinked at Cas, like he had been looking at him after Cas had taken Sam’s madness.
“Tell her you’ll be fine. That she doesn’t have to worry about you. You’re strong and you can protect yourself.”
The angel paused for a moment lost in thought. Then closed the door and came over to the high chair bending down until they were face to face.
“In their natural habitat they live in underground shafts and are mostly blind. They can communicate almost telepathically with their own kind using vibrations on water vapour.”
“Yes, fine, Sir.”
“It’s OK, baby,” Cas cooed at him. “It’s all just new. Shhhh. No need to cry now. The sooner we can get you through your transition the sooner you can see your brother, I promise. ”
He caught a dropping bottle for the second time as Dean drifted off in his arms but this time it was empty.
Shit. Cas had exploded. And then Sammy was beating the piss out of him. It didn’t hurt any less that he was possessed at the time.
Dean tore his way back up into consciousness and then felt a little silly when he opened his eyes and saw he was lying in a massive comfy bed with a blue plushy headboard. There was a pale blue blanket pulled over him, one of the impossibly soft fuzzy ones you get in classy hotels.
“There’s some physical skills – we need to increase your lung capacity, breath control and muscle strength so you can survive and function at 15% of our normal gravity and atmosphere. Our chamber is only set at 5% at the moment but I’ll be gradually increasing it as you progress. We’ll also work on your sense of balance and reflexes so you’ll be more comfortable in zero g chambers. And we’ll work a little on your communication skills in Enochian. You won’t be able to leave our chamber or join the training group until you can tell people who you are and where you live, explain if you need anything or are in distress and read directional signs on the rest of the ship. It’s mostly for your own safety in case you get lost.” Dean looked put out by the last bit but not enough to challenge him on it.
“What are you? I thought you said ‘I am an angel of the Lord’.”
“Yes, fine, what?”
“Food it is,” his Alpha agreed with a kiss to his temple.
“Like what?” Dean was about to say “play hopscotch and finger-paint” as a sarcastic joke but choked on the words. There was nothing funny about it.
“To take in mana safely you have to do it consciously and deliberately, eagerly. It’s not enough just to chew and swallow. You have to relax yourself into it while drawing it in steadily. Sometimes it takes some practice. The bottle makes it a lot easier to accept it the most effective way.”
Castiel took advantage of the omega’s momentary distraction to drape a towel over the changing station and then lifted Dean into it pulling each corner of the towel up to envelope him.
Dean shifted so he was no longer curled into the Alpha’s arm. Castiel let him go as far as he judged safe without the omega falling out of his lap. Dean tried to bat away the hands that were holding him steady.
The Alpha touched one of the walls and a screen appeared covered in complex wire diagrams, symbols enclosed in hexagonal badges and Enochian characters. “Right now, you’re at Level One,” the angel explained pointing at characters that were meaningless to the omega but wanting to keep his attention engaged instead of wandering around the room.
He gave a little shout of surprise and collapsed onto his side, his boner solved for the moment at least. Half leaning up he moaned, “Shit Cas! A little warning next time? We’re going to have to get you a cat bell or something.”
“Do you want to try that again, little boy?”
Cas was standing next to the bed a second later tsking at him. Dean realised his neck was craning back to look up at him.
“Yeah, no. We’re doing the other one.”
Noticing he did still have some vomit on his pants, however, the Alpha slipped out of them. All he had left was his socks and his loinwrap but Dean didn’t seem particularly distressed, instead tracing the patterns in the tiles on the backsplash, squinting up at the lights on the ceiling and biting his lower lip now that he was finally allowed to.
He walked quickly into the bathing room trying to hold Dean against his chest to keep as much of the mess off the carpet as he could. Once there, he set the omega down in the sink and used the spray head set for water to give him a good initial rinse. Then he took Dean’s small clothes off and dropped them in the laundry chute.
“We are angels. That’s what you can call our species. It’s just that the last time our scouts visited, the humans we interacted with didn’t quite understand what we were trying to convey. They thought we were supernatural instead of extra-terrestrial.”
“Can I see him?”
“Dean. It’s perfectly normal for omegas to go pee in their diapers while their forms are adapting. I don’t mind taking care of you. It’s what I’m here for as your Alpha.”
Cas set the bottle on the tray meaningfully and looked directly into the omega’s eyes.
“Choice three,” Dean told him glaring back. “I’ll starve to death right here.” And with a sweep of his arm, he knocked the bottle off the tray.
“What happened to the other 10%?” Dean groaned not sure he wanted the answer.
“Cas,” Dean hollered. “You let me out of here right now and I’ll kick your ass into the next solar system, angel or not.”
“Elohim has matched all of the omegas that were raptured with an Alpha angel. I’m your Alpha. We’re soulmates.”
When he tried to sit up though, everything swam like he was at the bottom of a two-liter bottle of Jack that someone had set on fire. It was Cas that had done that and then he called Adam an “Assbutt”. Dean couldn’t help grinning as he remembered it.
Assuming Gabriel was in a position to respond in kind. The first pulses Castiel sent met with no response so finally he shot a short frizzle to light the alert signal at his brother’s chamber and was rewarded with Gabriel finally connecting properly – or at least with one hand.
“What’s the other choice?”
“So it’s all over, we failed.” Dean sank back down staring up at the ceiling. It was pristine and white with an elaborate scrolled crown molding. It felt about a million miles away though, like the room was built for someone thirty feet tall.
“We can have some dinner.” Food did sound good. Dean’s stomach rumbled betraying him but Cas was kind enough not to grin too obviously.
“Take it off. Fucking now, Cas. I’ll crap in a bucket if I have to.”
“I can understand why you’re uncomfortable calling me that now and you’re welcome to come to it in your own time. I’m just letting you know that item 17 on your list is at least three spontaneous occurrences of using the correct form of address for your Alpha. So this is something we’re going to have to come back to before you’re cleared to see Sam. I’m happy to just leave it there for now though as it’s time for your next feeding anyway.”
“Someday when you’re bigger. We’re travelling to our next colony at the moment so we can start a new aeon and when we get there we sometimes use shuttles like these to go back and forth when we need bring things down to the surface.”
The second time he must have squeezed a kidney accidentally because the next thing Dean knew he was draining into the diaper and it felt amazing. Like lying on his back at the top of a mountain he just climbed with his arms outstretched. The diaper was puffing up visibly and getting warm but he didn’t feel wet against his skin like he expected it too. Three little blue lines became visible running up the centre of his crotch.
Dean slowed down shaking his head a little and struggled to get off his lap – not that he knew what he wanted to do if he was set down on the floor anyway. His dance card wasn’t exactly full since the destruction of his home planet.
“OK, yeah fine. I get it.” Another thud, this time just under the other cheek.
“Can’t I just finish one more puzzle? Please?” The little omega opened his eyes as wide as he could and increased the frequency of his blinking. Gabriel caved almost immediately, setting him down carefully in the middle of a large beanbag chair and pulling up a new game on the tablet for him.
Then he felt Cas’s hand on his forehead again. He must have been doing some kind of mojo thing because it felt cool on his skin and then he was really dropping off in earnest.
“Which is what?”
“You really are doing remarkably well,” Castiel told him with an encouraging kiss to the forehead and rub to the back as he carried him back to his crib. He’d settle him in with a bottle there, as Dean looked too tired to sit up in his high chair even for a few minutes.
“Dude, are you getting taller?”
And then Cas was lifting him off the bed like he weighed nothing and sat in the armchair, settling Dean in his lap. The hunter winced again. His bladder was throbbing now and every little movement sent a sharp pain racing around his midsection.
“Yes,” he admitted miserably. And then before he could do anything else, Cas’s massive hand was cupping his crotch.
“I just wanted to check how you and Sam were doing. I’m glad he’s progressing well. Dean really does ask about him all the time. He’s wearing himself out with the training so he can see him at playgroup as soon as he can.”
“I’m ready now.”
Had it been less than a day? It felt like the omega had been in his care forever. Like some piece of his wandering soul had returned to him at last.
Dean let go of his mom’s leg and walked over to me. His green eyes were bright and I remembered thinking,
Dean had handed a gun with a loaded question, I could answer honestly and entirely: We sold the house in Lawrence when Dad died; it had been too much for Mom and for me to walk into the living room and not find Dad reclining with a paperback, or over his typewriter in his den, or not hear his footsteps in the middle of the night when both of us couldn’t sleep. Every inch of that house screamed
“Charles! Come here!” Dad pushed his way through the crowd of people. He found us and put a hand on mom’s back. “I’m going to talk to the EMTs about Sammy, see how he’s doing. Please look after the boys.”
My eyes widen imperceptibly – I hoped,
We are sitting in my room, I’m sitting against my headboard, hugging a pillow to keep my hands busy. Dean is talking about the places he’s been with Sam and his dad, him smoking with his head out the window.
Those were my thoughts when I walked into English the following day. I was early for the class, not one to hang around after recess. I get out my books as I settled into my desk.
English was my last period. We were studying Macbeth, and I was enjoying it. I loved English, I loved the running on words, the soliloquies, the dramatics. All of it. And as much as Breytenbach was hard to get along with, the man knew his Shakespeare inside out.
Another game of chicken.
These were my thoughts when I saw the new boy,
My dad died last year. And this was his. You hardly saw him without it in the winter. When mom and I were taking care of his things, deciding where everything would go, she said I could have it. I started wearing it to school whenever there was the suggestion of wind that day. And when I woke up missing him.
Dean just nods slowly and turns back to his cigarette without another word to me. My heart tilts a little, but I guess it wouldn’t have been a good idea anyway.
“Please, mommy,” Dean pleaded, “Sammy’s asleep and you said he can’t play cars with me yet. Can me and Cast- Casteel- Cas play while you do stuff in the garden?”
Mary smiled, “Oh, it’s Mary,” she looks down to me, and winks, “Of course it is,” then back to my parents, “Can I invite you in for a cup of coffee?”
I nod. Anything would be good right now. The world could end and it would be good if the apocalypse could leave this room unscathed.
“So, she won’t be home tonight?” The suggestion in the question makes this damn hard on impossible to ignore under this pillow. I need to get to a bathroom. Now.
I didn’t know if I should bring it up. I mean, we were young enough that Dean probably doesn’t remember me well enough, but how many people has he met since named Castiel? Surely, my name has to be somewhere in there.
“My mother says Castiel is the Angel of Solitude and Tears.” Dean blinked me. “And Thursday,” I add with a shrug.
big tooth had just started wiggling. Mom said it was going to fall out any day now. Dean stuck out a hand.
“Hello, young man,” Dad said, his large hand engulfing Dean’s. “Shouldn’t you be inside with your parents?”
A heavy sigh of relief left Dean and he ooked at the ceiling. Cas was okay. Cas was alive.
swallowed by
Dean rubbed a hand down his face. Damn, he didn’t want to get angry at her because she had the right to call him everything but it was not the right time and place. Why couldn’t she understand it?!
“At least we don’t have to buy diapers” Sam had sighed with relief when Dean told him he needed to go to the bathroom back at the motel.
“That would be highly appreciated.”
“Didn’t you get a ‘C’ on a quiz? How do you know things like that?”
Sam could only nod. His throat felt tight.
I’m a hypocrite, I know, shut up.
And there he was. Sick at first and second glance but under his skin he was still the same son of a bitch Dean despised so much. His gaze lit up with excitement as his eyes settled on the man. Dean walked to the edge of the devil’s trap and waited. It didn’t take a lot of time for the other to start speaking.
“Why do you ask?” I like thinking I can play the dumb well. I have the face for that, for one. Who would think a male with a pretty face has a brain? And the more I try to act the more convincing I am. It wouldn’t be the first time I fool someone with this strategy.
The way Bobby spoke confused Hannah but she didn’t voice it. She would figure it out sooner or later. She was already spending quite long periods of time in the Men of Letters bunker for the past month. The angels found a way to open new portals all around the globe and one of them was almost right next to this facility. It was originally opened for Castiel who was shuttling between Heaven and Earth, mainly spending time on Earth, but Hannah made a good use of that portal too. She couldn’t tell what drew her here. Maybe it was the guilt that she had left Castiel in a critical time for an accusation that wasn’t entirely true. Stealing an other angel’s Grace was a sin but once again Castiel had had to do it for one human. Not that it annulled his actions, but she tried to be understanding.
. Do you play cars?”
“Do you
“Cast
“Sure thing, honey,” Dad said.
“Then buckle up.”
, walk into my English class. I screamed at the emotions that started pushing through the fog that had blanketed my consciousness for the last year of high school to stay back.
“Dad passed away a couple of years ago, so we just need a change of scenery.”
We stand in each other’s arms, for the first time in twelve years, for a few seconds until Dean finally speaks, “Apparently our brains are supposed to make memories fuzzy so that we don’t experience trauma all over again. But, I can’t forget that night.”
? Which parts are you from?”
hands are trying to open my belt, but they are not going fast enough. As much as I don’t want to, I break contact with his lips, to unbutton my pants, and stand up to pull them completely off.
I had barely even thought about it before I had my hands wrapped around Dean. I felt his arms hesitantly wrap around me.
“Do you want one?” I look up from the pillow to find Dean holding out a cigarette to me. His arm reaching towards me reminds me of
I thought,
“No, she won’t.”
“Hi! M’name’s Dean.” The boy smiled up at us, at me, a large gap where his two front teeth should be.
“If it’s okay with Mrs Winchester, sure.”
“Good morning, I’m Mary Winchester. What’s this little rascal done now?” She ruffles Dean’s hair, who has his arms around her one of her legs.
“I only give those out to special people.”
I have no reply, so I just hug him tighter, and let out the breath I hadn’t realised I had been holding.
Surprisingly, when the bell rings for the end of the day, Dean leans over to my table, “Can I come over to your house today?”
Dean’s eyes absorb every inch of our house. “Why did you guys move?”
Her arm was curled around my thin shoulders.
Mr Breytenbach called for the class’ attention. I faced the front but Dean keeps talking to me softly anyway.
He lifted an eyebrow,
“So, you’re limited to one day of miracles per week, and the rest of the week you mope?”
“But, I didn’t say goodbye.”
Dad’s hearty rumbled through me.
Mary looked up from Dean, embarrassed. She didn’t seem to know how to ask Mom and Dad. The silence lasts a second before something I’ve never done before happened: I spoke up.
Sobs continued to rip through my body.
Dean Winchester was always coming into my life and leaving it soon thereafter. You would think I would have gotten used to it by now. But, when Dean Winchester storms into my life, with his loud car, his charm-your-pants-off smile, his eyes that reminded me of a long gone carpet, I forgot how much it hurt finding out the next Monday that he wasn’t there anymore, because seeing him in front of me, with a cigarette hanging from his lips, my whole body feels like it’s finally alive.
I could say that without the feelings breaching the surface. He was movie handsome. His skin was tanned, and I think I could see the barest hint of freckles. His eyes, green and gold, reminded me of a garden during sunset and an old carpet that’s now ash.
No, Uncle John was. I caught him in the corner of my eye. His broad shoulders were slumped as he looked at their burnt bones of their house. Aunt Mary wasn’t nearby.
This is why it is clever to keep feelings like hope stamped down at the very bottom of my stomach so that I don’t get hurt. It makes everything so much more bearable.
“Castiel,” I half-whispered.
“Winchester. Dean Winchester. I’m from everywhere, but I guess I hail from Lawrence, Kansas.”
I hadn’t even realised I was also crying until my dad’s hand appeared of my back, rubbing in slow circles.
He didn’t say
Dean’s eyes rake down my body, like he can see underneath all my layers, like he can see my dick. He smiles but says nothing. His silence, his smile, his knowing eyes scream at me not to retreat, and for once I don’t. I sit next to him on the window seat, our knees touch.
A shock ran through my mom and I wriggled in my mother’s arms.
I did not want to play cards, but I had seen worried expressions on my parent’s faces when Ms Panton said I wasn’t talking to the other kids in class. Maybe this would make them happy with me. Plus, even then Dean’s questions were never questions, more suggestions that you just had to follow.
But, it was his smile. Something in that easy smile tugged at a memory I had long since buried. That easy smile, that when it was aimed at you, every faulty light inside you lit up if only it would mean he saw something bright and worth seeing.
My dad would butt in on the myriad of questions, disrupt the rhythm of the answers.
“I figured. Don’t worry, I’ll show ya how it all works.” Dean drags the L’s in ‘all’ and winks.
“What does it even mean?” He asked it like the question had been bothering him for years, but I glazed over his tone of voice.
And I know. I should question it. Put up a fight. But I don’t have it in me to draw this out any longer.
“Hi, Dean. Are you okay? Is Sammy okay? Where’s Aunt Mary? I haven’t seen her.” I scratched my pants, wanting to keep my hands busy. Dean didn’t like people besides Aunt Mary touching him when he was sad. Aunt Mary should have been next to him. That was the saddest I had ever seen Dean.
Everything changed when she asked the question Castiel had been hesitant to ask, “So, what’s your surname,
The question answers itself moments later.
“Try again.” At the risk of seeming too eager he adds, “If you want.”
Dean’s smile was radiant. I returned it with my own shy one.
“Sure.”
This was
I remember that I was crying into my mom’s shoulder while the fire blazed, her grip on me tight – as if she was afraid I would run into the fire. I’m going to be honest, I don’t know what I would have done if she hadn’t been holding me. But, I couldn’t even look up from her neck, because the red flame reflected off everything around us, like we were all burning. I was too young to understand what hell was, but whenever I think about it now, I picture that night: my best friend’s house on fire, some people shouting and some just stunned, staring, waiting for the family of four to walk out, even if they were broken and bruised, just
They were driving for half an hour now. Sam considered turning on the radio so something would break the silence but he didn’t get there because all of a sudden Hannah grabbed the seat with one hand and put the other on her mouth and turned to Sam like she was scared to death by something.
Hannah’s heart jumped after hearing this. That was new. Sam had never said anything like this to her. She felt joy washing over her Grace and her face lit up.
Sam’s heart was breaking to see his friend like this. They were so focused on Dean and the ripple that hey had forgotten about Cas’ Grace. Sam shouldn’t have forgotten of his friend. He felt shame burning inside him. Dean would punch him for not taking care of Cas properly.
“I didn’t panic.”
“Go. I’ll talk to you later.”
Metatron smirked and looked at her innocently.
“Dean!”
Kevin sighed.
Gadreel looked at the rear-view mirror like he was looking Sam in the eyes.
Sam and Charlie lowered their weapons too, but Hannah and Dean stayed ready to defend everyone.
“I have some questions.”
But for that I have to make sure nobody can stop that ripple. And that means one thing.
Dorothy let her eyes wander around the room.
“Just think about it. Why did Castiel turn against Heaven? Why did he die – how many times? – three times? Why did he leave his angel army? Why did he take that other angel’s Grace? Why is he dying because of it?” Crowley raises a brow. “So, who’s fault is it?”
“What the hell's happening?” He looked scared when he shifted his gaze between Sam, the monitor and the angel.
“You know what?” I begin as I fill both glasses. “Let’s forget about unworthy fathers. They can all go to hell and fuck themselves, I don’t care.”
“So what are we gonna do?” Kevin asked as he poured some coffee into his mug. From the corner of his eye he saw Cas looking at the dark liquid with so much sadness the teen quickly changed his mind and put down the mug without taking a sip. He also decided he would eat breakfast later. He could wait.
When Hannah shook her head Castiel sighed.
Gadreel could detect the doubt in the young man’s voice without trouble. Gadreel himself would be doubtful too if not for Sam’s memories. At first he had been scared. Dean knew his name and that meant he was aware of his past too. But then Sam had reached out towards him and had given him access to his memories. To Gadreel’s memories too from the future. It was… a strange experience to have recollections from a period that already happened but would not happen again. He was thankful for that though. Metatron had taken advantage of his weakness, his fondness of humanity to control him for his evil deeds. Sam reassured him that once Castiel was back he would surely tell him more. Gadreel wanted to apologize too. He should have trusted the Winchesters more.
