Bucky stood up, grabbing the papers from Clint's hands and screwing one up into a ball before throwing it over his shoulder, "I'm with you ‘til the end of the line. If it's jail, then we're making sure we take Hydra with us."
Tony followed his nose, not spotting the red head anywhere as he made his way over to the coffee machine, stealing Steve’s mug off the side to make his drink. The slow drizzle of espresso into his cup smelt like heaven and as soon as the timer went off he set about adding sugar and a dash of cream to make sure he got that sugar hit fast.
Tony hadn’t spoken since they left the room and Steve was worried he was slipping back into his shocked state. He moved with Steve, letting him guide him through the doorway towards the shower unit at the back of the locker room. He was still shaking, subdued shudders that rolled across his body and had Steve gripping onto him tighter like he only could squeeze all of Tony’s fractured pieces back together.
“That’s his story to tell.” Bruce replied, “All I know, if it wasn’t for Cap’s monthly donations to the clinic it would have been shut down by now. Money for lights, heating, the space, the medical supplies. It’s not cheap. Most of the workers are volunteers but the equipment costs money. He saved that place and for that I’ll always be grateful”
Steve wrapped his other hand over Tony’s, that was currently gripping the edge of the desk for leverage, both their knuckles going white and forearms shaking with the effort it was taking to keep them in this position.
Steve backed away slowly, keeping his eyes on Rumlow’s body as he went. Howard was still there, lifeless and grey. Steve didn’t even stop to pick up his gun. He needed fresh air.
Tony moved his head away and Rumlow let him go, heading towards the door. He picked up his paper on the way out, “Tomorrow, Mr Stark. Think on your choices wisely.”
His family would be safe and untouchable in the eyes of the law. They’d just need to pick up the pieces of what was left of Hydra. It was perfect. They’d need someone to blame when Steve got sentenced and he knew they’d make sure Hydra was dead and buried in the ground before his trial. His team were efficient like that.
“It’s Hydra, I should have trusted my gut from the beginning.” Steve replied harshly, not slowing down his pace.
“He went to the docks, down to Rumlow’s base at the shipment yard. He said you’d need details of the operation before you guys made a move.” Tony explained.
“You don’t get to decide something like that for me.” Bucky spat out, “It’s your body, I know it’s your choice but the least you could have done was told me. Instead I had to find a leaflet in your room and connect the dots. You owed me more than that.”
“I know, sweetheart. I know. It’s okay. He can’t hurt you anymore.” Steve promised, “We need to clean this up though, okay?”
Tony found him later that day, coming home from a shift at the garage with grease on his cheek and a smile on his face. Carefree, happy, at least for a moment. He pushed his way into Steve’s bathroom on his floor, blinking his eyes against the steam and heat coiling up from the tub. Steve was reclined in the bathtub, back resting against one end with his feet at the other.
23 names left on the list and that was a lot more manageable, it allowed Steve to take a gulp of his drink and scan the names left on his screen. He stopped short at one name, just over halfway down the list. It was a name he recognised, a name he remembered. A man he once knew.
The pain in his temples flared when Tony blinked, trying to make out the room before him from the fuzz of his mind. He probably had a concussion. He’d been hit by Howard one too many times to know the signs of it well.
Even trust Tony when he said the palladium was a stabiliser. It wasn’t, it was a highly corrosive element that Howard added into all the missiles of the Freedom Line. It was a chemical stimulant and produced enough energy within the missile to allow it to cause real damage.
“Are we alone? Or do you have people waiting for this to turn ugly?” Fury asked, eyes never leaving the sea. His eye-patch was in place, as always, and Steve had always wondered what had happened that made Fury think eye-patches were the way to go.
Rumlow rubbed a hand over his scar, “Oh, I know what a weapon of mass destruction looks like. I saw them up close in Afghanistan, used a few myself. You know what I learned for my time overseas? Whoever controls the weapons has the power.”
Thor heard shuffling to his left and swung the hammer up in his palm again. There was more work to be done.
When he made it up to his study a brown envelope, A4 in size, caught his attention. It was neatly placed on top of the rest of Steve’s files, but he hadn’t placed it there. It definitely wasn’t there when he had left to meet Fury yesterday. Intrigued, Steve walked over to the envelope, picking it up. It was heavier than he thought, a good chunk of paper. He tore into it with a frown.
He watched as Tony shrugged out of his jacket, placing it gently over the back of the sofa before grabbing his hand and leading him over to the bedroom.
The weight of this moment sat like a brick in Steve’s gut. It had been a long time since he had done this, brought someone new into the fold and asked his family to trust his judgement that they would be the right fit. The last one had been Thor, arguably the most difficult for them to get behind because of his bloodied history and his unpredictable nature but the team had voted in his favour. An agreement between them that Thor would be a much better ally than an enemy and if Natasha could see something in him worth saving, if Steve could find enough evidence in the man that prompted him to bring Thor back with him, then they would trust that instinct. Thor was now a member of their family and an invaluable asset to their team.
“I told you, I don’t want to make weapons. I don’t want to sell weapons. I don’t want any part of your legacy if it gets people killed.” Tony insisted, he was gripping his keys so tightly into his palm that he could feel the metal cutting into his skin.
“You’re wrong you know. Steve Rogers did die that day. I’m that dark thing inside him that refused to die in the desert, and I’m the only thing left.” Steve replied.
Peter wasn’t put off in the slightest, “I think the little old ladies will love him. Women like men that are good with animals.”
Steve wasn’t sure what he was expecting when he arrived at the docks for two in the afternoon, his leather jacket on his frame to protect him for the biting cold of the day but it wasn’t to see Detective Inspector Fury waiting to greet him, looking out to the sea like he was enjoying a rare day off. Briefly Steve wondered whether this was a trap, the gun tucked into the waistband of his jeans seemed like a tempting option but he held back. Fury wouldn’t have gone to all this trouble of secrecy and discretion to get Steve to meet him just to arrest him, especially not when he knew Steve would be out in a few hours.
“How did he? How did the boy who dreamed about becoming a getaway driver end up as Brooklyn’s most wanted mob boss?” Tony asked, the question out before he could stop it.
“We need to move him to his bedroom; he’ll be more comfortable there.” Bruce told Steve, “Sam, I’ll need you to come with us. We need to start with the blood transfer while he’s resting. I want to give him chance to heal.”
He went back to moving his fingers faster than before, hitting his prostrate maddeningly as Tony sucked on his fingers and bucked his hips. He was so close; he was tensing with every thrust hoping it would be the one to push him over.
Steve nodded, the last of the blood on Tony’s face swirling down the drain between their feet, “Yeah. We’ll get them once we’re done here. Fury offered us a job working with him on a new unit. It comes with immunity; we’d all be able to stay in Brooklyn together.”
Steve softened slightly, Bucky’s anger giving way to pain, “We’ll deal with Hydra. We’ll handle the cops. That’s my focus. I promise you. But this thing with Tony, it isn’t up for negotiation. I don’t need your approval, but I would like your support.”
He felt the burn of his thighs from their activities and he almost wanted to wince because if he was feeling it then Tony would definitely be sore today. Steve managed to move off the bed without too much jostling, not disturbing Tony as he worked to retrieve his jeans and boxers from where they were discarded on the floor last night.
By the time he was so hungry he felt sick and he was running on pure exhaustion, Tony had made the arc reactor glove fully weaponised. He wiggled his fingers into the glove, the heavy reactor feeling weird in his palm. He flexed his hand, twisting his wrist this way and that to get used to the feel and the slight warmth in the centre of his palm.
Tony watched the exchange with a fondness, this really was a family. This rag-tag bunch of criminals that would kill and die for each other. It made his heart stutter. He dialled in Rhodey’s number and waited for it to ring.
Everyone fell silent and Steve had his gun in his hand before anyone could blink. Could this be the demands he was waiting for?
Or maybe, they could. Maybe he could repurpose the arc reactor tech, make it something better than a weapon. An energy source had any applications beyond that.
“I’ll make sure if I go down then you’re coming down with me. Two empires crumbling to dust in the city that we once called home.” Steve spat out.
Then he added another finger, Tony’s walls protesting slightly at the intrusion before relaxing into it. Tony was still rocking slightly, using his knees for leverage and Steve couldn’t resist diving in for a kiss. Tony was so gorgeous like this, unable to dampen down his own pleasure and want for Steve.
His pleasure was right on the edge, teasing him with every thrust that could be the one to send him falling into the abyss. He was sweaty and tense as he pumped his cock in and out of Tony’s hole, his pace maddening and erratic, fuelled by desire and need rather than teasing and exploring.
Bucky stayed there, taking comfort in their silence. He didn’t cry or speak or do anything more than stand there and grip Steve’s shirt like he used to when they first enlisted together, fresh faced and eager to protect their country.
“The turf war, the cops are bringing in a specialised unit to get the gangs out of Brooklyn. I’m at the top of their Christmas list.” Steve replied with a grimace that told Tony he was deadly serious.
Bruce was working feverishly, Sam pulling out items from his bag and putting pressure on Bucky’s wound when Bruce needed to get things ready. Natasha had dropped to her knees next to Steve, fingers clutching Bucky’s leg. Her eyes were fearful and desperate, she was afraid. Clint stood behind her, one hand on her shoulder to try and offer her comfort.
And just like that, they were back to the way they always were. Planning their survival and plotting to make the world a bit safer for their family. Steve needed that. “I’m waiting for T’Challa to get back to me with a list of returning army vets. See if any names pop up, it’s a long shot but it’s a start. I need you and Nat to start following Hydra members. I want to know who they meet, where, why.”
Steve paused, willing his mouth to work around his dry throat at the fear in Bucky’s voice as he said the last sentence, “Buck…”
These aren't his usual conditions, he is acutely aware of the fact he isn't in his condo or at the garage and if he needs something then he has to bang on the door of his cell and wait for someone to open up so he can ask for what he needs. It's annoying and it slows the process right down but Tony pushes on regardless.
Tony laughed, it was soft and delicate, like he didn’t do it often, “My apprentice showed up with a cat. My best friend is a workaholic who doesn’t know when to quit and I’m pretty much going to be doing double shifts from now til Christmas to keep my customers happy.” He shrugged, “Another day at the office.”
Steve softened, stepping closer to Tony. His cuffs rattled slightly as he moved. He dropped his head and Tony could see the shame wash over him, “You would have realised I wasn’t good enough for you. I’m not good enough for you.”
“Did you know there’s a whole buzzfeed article dedicated to whether you wear boxers or briefs?” Tony blurted out and then seemed to realise what he had said because Steve could see him blush.
“What’s Hydra doing in a nice place like this?” Steve called out after scanning the car park to make sure they were alone, “Isn’t the gutter more your scene?”
“I said Ross is in town.” Fury repeated, “He arrived this morning and started shaking up the whole station. Replacing people he thought might be on your payroll or Hydra’s. He assembled his own team for this within an hour. This is the last call you’re going to get from me. You’re on your own now.”
It was less than thirty minutes later that Clint was walking out of the precinct with a high head and squared shoulders. He made a display of throwing his hands out wide and smelling the air before his eyes found Steve and he headed towards his Captain. Steve was leaning back against a car, hands crossed over his head, keeping his distance from the station but not wanting Clint to be alone.
“You know what I mean.” Bucky replied, “This job, this life. It isn’t for everyone and you’re not like us, Tony. That’s a good thing. But it doesn’t make Steve any safer and I’m the one who has to pick up the pieces when you decide you can’t do this anymore. When being with a mob boss gets too much for you.”
“No, it’s my job to protect you. I promised your mom I would. I did in Afghanistan. I did on the streets. I will now.” Bucky replied, “I can’t lose you too.”
The steam created a thick cloud of privacy around them, fogging up the walls of the shower and blocking off the view from beyond their little bubble. He felt Tony relax with him, in their little moment of peace. His hands came up to Steve’s sides, just holding onto him with firm fingers as Steve continued to clean him up.
“He was a pretty shit father all round, I’m afraid. He paid up eventually, because the press would have made him look like a monster if he didn’t. Mostly I was fine, if they hurt me, they didn’t get their money so it was a few days spent in a basement.” Tony said, trying to play the whole thing off but Steve could see the distant look in his eyes and the awkward set of his shoulders.
His captor was intrigued, Tony could tell by the way he leant forward with his elbows on his knees, “The Captain?”
Tony rolled his hips again; this time Steve’s rose to meet him. He gave Steve a wide smile, “We’ll think of one. I’m not letting you go to jail, Steve.”
Steve paused for a moment wondering how to handle this next bit, “Bombs. You want to know more? I’m going to need a little more communication with you and a little less of the pissing contest. We get it, Ross, you’ve got a big stick. Mine’s bigger and right now, you need my help.”
Then the stalemate broke and a shot rang out. Steve acted quickly, shoving both him and Tony back around the corner for cover as the bullet embedded into the wall where Steve’s head had been. They were trapped like rats in a barrel and Steve didn’t have a weapon. What he wouldn’t give for one of Nat’s knives right now.
“Did Steve leave already?” The voice startled him and Tony turned round to find Thor standing in the doorway with his hammer in his hands.
Tony moaned into it as he felt Steve’s hips thrust up against his rock-hard cock. Steve tore his mouth from Tony’s to work kisses into the side of his jaw, “You need to meet the team properly. I need to tell them you’re with us.”
Tony was beyond everything, trapped in a chase for his own pleasure. A dull ache that refused to be ignored and grew every time Tony ground his hips against Steve. Steve was getting hard again just watching Tony get himself off like this, his cock awakening at the sound of Tony’s pleasure and the image of him seeking it out.
He walked into the interview room, closing the door behind him with his foot. Steve startled at the sound; those blue eyes shocked at seeing Tony rather than another police officer in the room.
“I’ll never understand how you can balance like that.” Steve mused as Natasha moved back onto her bed to start unlacing the slippers.
“Every night before bed.” Fury quipped. Rhodes handed him a few photos which Fury took, taking a moment to study each other before slamming the first one on the table in Clint’s direction. It was a body, close up on a guy’s face that was pale and deadly still.
Tony’s condo was warm when they stepped inside and Tony flicked the lights on, Steve was just moving his feet. The adrenaline was leaving his system and he was tired.
When it was done Pierce lay sweaty and pale on the ground, his hand a few centimetres away from his body. Blood was oozing out of the wound, marking the white snow red. The warmth of the liquid was melting the ice beneath it, making complex patterns as it spread wider beneath his arm.
Steve growled, hands snaking round to grab at Tony’s ass, round and full in his hands as he pulled Tony against him, “I don’t have anything down here…”
Tony shot Steve a smile, “Yes, it is.” He was standing at Rhodey’s side now, but his eyes were fixed on Steve, “Have a nice life, Captain.” He said in a purr. Tony stayed just long enough to watch Steve swallow thickly and then he was gone.
Steve took a moment to drink him in, admiring the tan skin and the length of his cock, proud against his stomach and already leaking. The head was shiny with precome and Steve wanted nothing more than to devour him.
“Brilliant idea.” Tony breathed as he pulled back, stroking Steve inside his jeans softly, “Best idea I’ve ever had.”
It was smart, slipping Steve the device so no one would notice it. It also left Steve slightly aroused and more than a little confused. Tony had said he loved him, but Steve knew he had hurt him and that alone had probably ruined anything they might have had together even if he did manage to get out of there. He’d retrieved the device from the waistband of his pants, turning the little box over in his hands. It would be easy to break the lock, he trusted Tony’s design, but then he’d have to dodge being caught by police and navigate his way through the station before he was free. The morgue would be the best option, he knew the layout from when he went to visit Fury and see Coulson’s body. There was a service exit he’d used. It would probably be unmanned.
They had kissed at the station but that had been a ploy on Tony’s part to give him the device, he had pushed pass all those feelings of hurt and insecurity to get the job done. Steve would have done the same. But Steve had kissed him back, eager and joyful. Just like he always kissed Tony, with the fine line between sweet and sinful.
Bruce pressed the rod to Bucky’s arm. Bucky started screaming, his whole body jerking before he passed out. The sound of sizzling hot metal burning into flesh filled the room and the scent of burning skin hit Steve’s nose with such a force his eyes watered, and he had to look away as Bruce continued his work on Bucky’s arm.
Steve gave him a smile back before turning to Thor, “Thor, wipe the slate clean, okay? No one gets out. If they’re Hydra…”
He was thrusting into Tony with a maddening pace, pure carnal passion fuelling him as they both worked towards their second orgasms of the night. Steve’s grip on his hip would leave bruises and Steve couldn’t even feel his other hand from how tight Tony was gripping it. They moved together, shuddering and pushing each other further towards the edge with each cant of their hips and every thrust.
Bucky did as instructed, pushing Sitwell’s face against the headlight with his palm on his head as Steve made his way over, “Hope he didn’t give you any trouble?” He asked Natasha, never taking his eyes off the coward in Bucky’s grip.
“Rumlow’s coming for you, Captain. I’m just the one who’s pulling the trigger, he’s the bullet.” Pierce bit out.
He studied his best friend then, the dark circles under his eyes and the messy bun that his hair was in. He was still in a t-shirt and dark grey joggers and Steve wondered if he had even been to bed yet or if he was up all night waiting for him to come home. Bucky always felt like it was his responsibility to look out for Steve and he knew it was a responsibility he took seriously. He had been doing it since they were boys and Steve lost his mother to pneumonia after a harsh Brooklyn winter where they couldn’t afford heating in their tiny apartment.
"Whatever you're going to do, do it fast." He told Steve with a grim face, "Something is happening down there."
The door opened with a creak that made Tony jump and Ross strode in through the doorway, shoulders hunched. He looked even more imposing in the small space and Tony almost wanted to press himself up against the wall to put more distance between them.
Those eyes were on him again, hands already curling up the paper when he realised Tony was more lucid than before.
"No, you're not." Natasha cut in, "You keep telling us that all you want is to protect us. You gave us a home and a family, Steve. You found us, every single one of us and you chose us to be a part of this empire you wanted to build. Why can't you believe that we chose you too? That we'd want to protect you just as much as you want to protect us?"
“Sounds like Steve.” Natasha sighed, “We’ve got cops on our payroll. Apparently, Ross hasn’t even interviewed him yet. He’s waiting for something. Trying to break him before he puts him in an interview room. I don’t know.”
Ross laughed, “You? You’re not a mob boss, Mr Stark. You’re barely a gang member. I bet you’ve never even fired a gun before? Or used a knife?”
Tony sighed, “Feels like it is. I don’t want to be the guy that comes between a family. Especially with everything you guys have going on.”
They had done a good thing tonight. They had got the bombs off the streets and stopped Rumlow’s reign of terror in its tracks. Didn’t that count for something? Steve might have killed him, but he was a bad guy, surely that was a point in his favour. Rumlow was a cop killer and a tyrant. He’d killed Tony’s father.
As it turned out, Tony found him. Steve had just walked back inside when he spotted Tony walking towards him. He slowed down in front of him, suddenly shy which caused Steve to frown. Had Tony seen?
Tony was back to his work, “Nope. Well, my dad’s a dick so I left home at eighteen and never looked back. So now I’m a mechanic, no press, no pressure.”
Thor was right, the darkness in him that just wouldn’t let go. The numbness that washed over him. They were men of action. Rumlow had been the same.
Steve huffed, pressing his knees against the sides of the tub as Tony made him way over. He stepped into the water without an invitation, settling himself between Steve’s legs with his back resting against his chest.
Or would he try and explain what it was that drew him to Steve like a forest fire despite knowing he’d only get burned? How could Tony put into words the way Steve made him feel. The way Steve saw him for who he was as well as everything he was trying to be. Rhodey was great, he was Tony’s biggest cheerleader for turning his life around, but Rhodey only ever focused on the potential of Tony Stark. On everything Tony could become if he tried.
Bucky had been pulled off Sitwell by another goon and they were currently going fist to fist. Bucky was brutal. Steve had sparred with him enough to know. Bucky lodged a right hook into his opponent’s jaw with such a force that it sent him back a few steps, spitting blood before he charged at Bucky again.
Steve started pumping him in time with his thrusts, his own vision blacking out around the edges with his pleasure. He gritted his teeth, doubling his efforts to make Tony come one more time before he did.
So, when Steve arrived at the garage to see Tony with his head under the bonnet of a car and a younger lad he could only guess was Peter flicking through some paperwork with a cat on his lap he wondered whether Tony would be happy to see him.
Tony tried not to let the worry show on his face. How much did this guy know? If he knew who Tony was then did he also know about his connection to Steve? The guy was obviously Hydra, the gang patch on his jacket gave that much away. Had they been following Steve? Maybe they saw Tony leave his place earlier, had seen the kiss Steve had given him before he got into his car.
But to get to him here, with cops on the payroll and in a city they all knew so well they could make it work. It was their best chance and it was the only chance they had.
Thor took up a seat at the table, pushing out the chair next to him which Tony figured was as much of an invitation as he was going to get. He nodded to himself, grabbing his mug and settling into the chair on Thor’s left. He watched curiously as Thor brought the hammer onto the table, setting it down with such care. The metal was rusted, flakes of dried blood from god knows how many victims crusted into the weapon. There was a name carved into the handle.
He was back in the same interview room they had put him in before, the clock still ticking on the wall. They hadn’t processed him yet, instead just cuffed his hands to the table as if to protect themselves from him. That was rich when Ross was Hydra and calling their orders.
He disappeared into the crowd to find Tony, as much as he wanted to have a proper chat with T’Challa and talk about old times he knew this wasn’t the time. T’Challa couldn’t appear to be too friendly with The Captain at his own gala or it might cost him more votes than Steve could win. They needed to appear on talking terms, a silent statement that T’Challa would be able to reason with The Captain if needed but no so friendly as to suggest he was in his back pocket.
Steve kept his pace, hand and hips working in tandem to bring Tony into oblivion. Just a little more, “Come for me, sweetheart.” The name tumbled from his lips before Steve could stop it and Tony was tumbling into his pleasure soon after.
“Exactly, Bucky will warm up to you when he realises you’re here for Steve just like the rest of us.”
It was blaring down in the lower level so it must have been deafening in the upper ones. The message was clear. A criminal had escaped and was on the loose, all units to engage. Steve didn’t have a good feeling about this.
“Yes.” The word sounded hollow and empty in his mouth, “And now it might have been all for nothing.”
He took a large step towards Tony, closing the distance until Tony could feel his heat despite the cold of the night.
A small pool of blood caught Steve’s attention and he made his way over to it, crouching down to take a closer look. It wasn’t enough to be alarming, but it was enough for Steve to know whatever struggle had taken place hadn’t ended well.
Tony let him, stepping out of the rest of his clothes and kicking off his shoes. He stood before Steve, naked and shivering and barely himself.
“That’s just Steve though,” Natasha said wistfully, “In his office upstairs he still has a baseball from a game him and Sam snuck into a week before they shipped out. He took me to a ballet show once for my birthday because he knew I loved it even though he had no idea what was happening, I have the ticket stub on my wall upstairs. Steve keeps his in a box in his desk draw along with Bucky’s army pin and a couple of other bits from the team.”
Steve bit his lip, “I knocked Rhodey out back at the station. He’s fine, slight headache. He caught me trying to escape. I tried talking to him.”
“Listen here,” Ross breathed out, “I will make sure your trial is as public and as long as OJ’s. Everyone will know your name and your face and the things you’ve done. By the time I’m done with you they will be asking to move you to a state that offers the death penalty.”
They held a funeral for Howard three weeks later. Or, Tony held one for him. Steve knew he was doing it out of duty more than anything that even remotely resembled love. He did it because it was the right thing to do, because it was what the press and everyone at Stark Industries was expecting from him.
Bucky nodded sharply and was out of there before Steve could utter another word. He’d go to Sam’s and rant and calm down and when he came back later, he’d be more reasonable, Steve knew. Natasha stayed for a moment, eyes on Steve like she wanted to say more.
“I’d follow you anywhere, you know?” Steve told him, “I meant it when I said nothing means a damn without you.”
The angle had Steve bending down and meant Tony was too high, his erection pressing into Steve’s stomach rather than his crotch, where Steve really wanted to feel him. He growled, hoisting Tony up into his arms, relishing in the feeling of Tony squeezing his legs around him, hands gripping Steve’s shoulders. Steve moved them over to the kitchen table, planting Tony onto the edge and wasting no time in bringing him closer, their erections pressing deliciously against each other.
Steve looked up sharply when Fury walked back in, striding over to unlock the cuffs without looking him in the eye. He was tense and Steve frowned. Something was wrong.
Steve leaned down to place a kiss to his forehead, “I just know. Am I a monster? After all the things I’ve done? The people I’ve killed?”
“I love you.” Steve cut him off and then he was being pulled back and forced to the ground. He watched as Tony was hauled towards one of the police cars, his hands cuffed. He tried to look back but the cop with him forced him forward again.
It was the wrong thing to say. It was something he’d said before. An instant reaction whenever Rumlow would start saying his piece about the world. Steve would always contradict it; he’d always stand up against Rumlow in the army. They’d always come to blows over it.
“Should it? Business is business, right? And you’re paying me double what I’d normally charge for this work. Besides, this bike is a beauty. I can see why you wanted her fixed rather than replacing her.” He replied with a flash of white teeth in Steve’s direction.
“It’s a mini arc reactor. Pure energy, I solved the equations when I was 17. It’s an energy source that might be able to run Brooklyn for a year given the right treatment,” Tony replied, “But sure, for now it’s a weapon.”
“Rumlow did this.” Bucky huffed, ignoring Steve’s plea, “Rambling about how this was a common thing in Afghanistan. He said…” Bucky coughed, and Bruce pressed his wound tighter, “He said that I was to be brought back home to give you a message. He wanted me to live long enough to tell you…You played him. He knows.”
Bucky sighed, turning in his seat a little more so his knees were angled towards Tony, “I don’t. I just… I wasn’t sure you were right for Steve. I thought you were messing with his head; we didn’t know anything about you and suddenly Steve is seeing you regularly and staying over. He never does that you know; he doesn’t stay the night. Never goes to the same person twice. It’s too risky for him in this line of work.”
Tony unbuckled the belt holding his trousers in place, releasing his mouth from Steve’s skin so he could work on getting rid of the trousers, his boxers and his shoes. When Tony was done and the clothing was in the growing pile on the floor, he watched as Steve’s cock stood proudly against his stomach, the red patch of skin he’d sucked a bruise into gleaming under the light.
Steve felt uncomfortable, leg tapping under the table, “So, you risk your job just like that? Because you think I’m a semi-decent person?”
“Right.” Tony found himself breathing easily, he grabbed the mug from her hands, letting the steam curl into the air, “So, he thinks he should have talked Steve out of getting involved with me?”
He snapped out of his pacing, the echo of his last name pulling him back into the room like he was a young trainee in the army again. He couldn’t help how his body instantly stilled, standing up a little straighter. He fought the urge to salute.
Steve closed his eyes, “Because I didn’t want to.” He admitted, “Because I like him, more than I should. More than I have any right to allow myself.”
“Okay, you’re handcuffed so I’m calling the shots right now.” Tony told him, stepping closer again, “We have a plan. You’re going to break yourself out, then you’re going to get clear and meet the team outside in the alley. They will have a car waiting.”
“It’s for Tony.” Steve reminded him, “Fury, is there a way to get the body out of here without being seen?”
It was a slow process, but Tony was still fighting and for that Steve would thank whatever God made him that way.
“This is going to hurt.” He warned Bucky, although it was unclear if Bucky was even lucid. Bruce clamped his palm over the wound with a wad of gauze, using his own strength to slow down the blood pooling from the injury. Bucky screamed in agony; eyes suddenly more alert. His other hand reached for Steve, fingers curling into the neck of Steve’s shirt and tugging so hard he almost pulled Steve over.
Before he could talk himself out of it, Steve turned on his heel and headed for the kitchen. He needed a piece of paper or something so he could at least leave Tony a note. He didn’t want Tony to think he regretted their night together or that he was simply using him. Steve didn’t know why he cared but he did, he needed Tony to know that if nothing else.
“Probably.” Steve admitted, taking another large gulp of his drink. He shouldn’t care about what Tony thought about him. He was who he was and it served him well so far. It didn’t matter what a mechanic thought. Even if he did have those eyes that drove Steve crazy and a quick wit that left him reeling.
Steve sighed, he knew T’Challa’s help wouldn’t come without a cost and whilst he had always supported T’Challa’s political campaign and run for office he absolutely hated having to go to his galas and functions to strong arm him some of the more difficult votes. Steve hated public appearances of anything, especially when they involved a tux and a fake interest in other people’s political views.
Tony shook his head, “Not anymore. I’ve been disowned so people would be stupid to try it now. I’m pretty sure Howard would rather just let me get tortured until they get bored. It happened a few times when I was sixteen, seventeen. I was being fitted as the Stark Industries heir back then so I got a lot of unwanted attention.”
He should have known, that gut feeling he told Natasha about was there and never normally wrong. He was worried about a gang war but if Hydra was coming after his team then Steve knew he’d do whatever it took to stop them. Whoever the new leader was, he was smart. Smart enough to know he needed to make Steve weaker before he could attack him directly. The idea was probably to frame The Avengers for the killings, the police would start to round up the other members which would leave Steve missing half his family and vulnerable to attack.
“Why are you here?” Tony asked him softly, keeping pace with him as Steve took another corner. The bodies he had killed minutes before were still decorating the floor of the corridor. Steve barely paid them any attention as he guided Tony through the mess.
“I’m not looking for his approval.” Tony told her honestly, eyes back on Clint as Thor returned with Bruce’s bag.
Tony wasn’t about to draw this out though and his hands were yanking at Steve’s jeans and belt with a fierceness that had Steve standing up and trying to help him before he ripped something. Tony shoved Steve’s jeans down his legs, not bothering to get rid of the belt in his haste and then he was pushing Steve back against the desk, dropping to his knees right there in front of him so he could get his mouth on Steve’s cock.
He was dead in minutes. It was a waste of ambition and stupidity and Steve almost wanted to mourn him.
Steve took that as his chance to back away, he shouldn’t have heard any of that and as much as he wanted to tell Natasha she was wrong, they could have a happy ending, that he’d make sure of it, he knew he couldn’t. It wasn’t his place, it was Bucky’s. They’d come back together on their own, they were complex and intertwined together in a way Steve could only dream of having. To have someone who loved you so unconditionally, so messily and purely and deeply. Wasn’t that what he wanted? Wasn’t that why he encouraged their relationship in the first place? Because if they found hope then maybe he could as well.
As soon as he was at his desk with the list of names up on his laptop, Steve was in full Captain mode. He had a list of just under a hundred names to go through, but he was good at this. He knew army protocols and he knew a fair bit about the man he was looking for. He started off by crossing out anyone who returned home due to injury or medical issues, whoever was running Hydra had to convince them he would be able to take on Steve and win therefore he was probably in peak physical condition. He then removed the women from the list because Sitwell had told him he was a man. That left 61 names to sort through.
Natasha gripped his hands, hers were cold but she held Tony’s fingers firmly, “He isn’t going to jail. We’ll fix it. As a family.”
“I watched Bucky and Nat make so many mistakes, I watched them get weighed down in the hate and anger and fear.” Steve said softly, “they were barely speaking to each other. They wasted so much time and now, we barely have any left.”
When he started moving he did so slowly, wanting to give Tony the chance to get hard so he could come again. Steve knew that teasing him was the best way to rile up Tony’s arousal and Tony seemed to know that was what he was doing, reaching down a hand to his cock to take it gently in hand. He matched Steve’s pace until his cock started filling with blood again, backing away to let himself grow erect properly without the over stimulation.
“I know.” Steve said, “But you got to let me make my own mistakes. I could be happy with him. I am happy with him. I’m not sure where it will go, if anywhere but he knows who I am and he’s still here.”
“Not much of a secret if I go around giving people my full name, is it?” Steve pointed out, “Besides you don’t even know if I gave you my actual first name.”
God, Steve loved his family. He really did. He nodded once, a resolve crumbling and then he left. He didn't trust his voice to speak the words he wanted to say. The gratitude he wanted to express.
The sight that greeted him in the garage wasn’t what Steve was expecting. He nodded to Sam on the stairs, effectively relieving him from his duty and letting him go upstairs for some food. Steve continued down the steps where the sound of rock music was playing, softly enough to not be heard outside this room but loud enough to seem out of place with the rest of the house. Steve spotted the Mechanic instantly, a flash of dark hair bend over his motorbike as he hummed to himself and twisted a spanner around one of the bolts.
Tony nodded, “We’ll have to split up for a bit, Ross will be tracking us so the more people for him to track in different directions the better. Eventually he’ll run out of resources, time and money and the case will be closed by force. Until then, groups of two or three.”
He moved back over to the bed, taking time to look over at Steve. He looked so peaceful when he slept, almost vulnerable. He was on his back, that impressive chest on display with the midnight blue sheets pooling around his waist. Tony could see a hint of the bruise he left on Steve last night peeking from under the sheet on his hip. There was a piece of blonde hair curling over his forehead and Tony resisted the urge to push it back behind Steve’s ear. He didn’t want to wake him.
“I vote yes.” Sam called out with a shrug, “If we’re doing the vote now. Mine’s a yes. If the guy can make you smile, then that’s all the work he needs to do.”
“I’ll put Rhodey on it first thing tomorrow and call you if I find anything.” Fury agreed, “We need to find this guy before he kills again.”
“You had to walk into mine?” Steve finished, turning in his seat to take in those brown eyes that had plagued his mind since their kiss in his garage.
Steve thrust them back into Tony’s warmth, curling them deliciously to press against his prostate. Tony almost whined, cock dripping with precome.
He was also quick, “I’m just getting warmed up. So, then there is the ease at which you kill people. We have you on nearly 20 kills alone, that’s without adding the collective kills of everyone in your gang. Damn, they say you even killed Phillips to take over his gang because you knew you could run it better.”
“Did you know in the war Brooklyn was one of the towns tasked with the job of producing gunpowder?” Steve asked, “They had to turn out so much of it for years after the smell of it clung to the walls of the shipment yards where they made it.”
They were talking to a diplomat and his wife when Steve noticed something out of the corner of his eye that wasn’t quite right. The wife was telling a story about their home décor construction and Tony was responding in all the right places, but Steve’s attention was on the man at the back of the hall, near the exit. He was tall, sandy hair and a pressed grey suit. Pierce. Steve knew that face, he’d been to a meeting with Sitwell before. Hydra. Steve frowned, excusing himself from the conversation with a hand on Tony’s elbow to say he’d be back and then he was moving. Why would Hydra be here? They didn’t normally have a hand in politics. Pierce was definitely mingling though, a phone in his hand as he excused himself from his present company and headed outside, typing on his phone.
This wasn’t their usual spot for meeting, Steve preferred the docks. It was further out of the city and the sound of the waves crashing against the pier always managed to calm him down when Sitwell said something stupid. Hydra’s current front runner had suggested the warehouse district instead and Steve didn’t have a reason to refuse.
“There’s lube and condoms in my toolbox.” Tony told him, hands pulling out of his jeans to start working open the buttons on Steve’s shirt.
“I knew you’d come.” Rumlow replied, “he screamed, you know? When I hacked off his arm. That’s his blood over there.” He motioned to a spot in the corner next to another support beam. Steve had to swallow the bile in his throat at the sight of Bucky’s blood pooled around it, hacksaw slick with it and left abandoned in the mess.
Steve’s face flashed in Tony’s mind, the way he looked so helpless and guilty as the police hauled him away from Tony at the shipment yard. Beard and cheeks smattered with blood, blue eyes so full of emotion Tony wanted to choke.
Tony closed the door behind them softly, glancing around Steve’s room with eager eyes. It was the first time he’d stayed over. Normally they stayed at Tony’s place, less people there. Steve was glad they were here though, if Rumlow was coming after him then he wanted Tony to be protected.
Steve leaned back on the balls of his feet, “I can do this all day, but I would much rather be killing your boss so why don’t you tell me where I can find him?” Steve asked, his voice barely above a whisper.
Steve shoved him to the ground, there was something satisfying about watching Pierce snivel around in the dirt. He leaned down, pulling the knife out of his shoe, Natasha had made him bring it when he refused to take a gun to T’Challa’s party. He was grateful she had.
Worried eyes of confusion tracked his movements as Steve paced in front of them. They were all crowded into the small space, taking up the couch and the armrests like a united front. In any other situation Steve could believe they had all gathered for a movie night or a night to simply enjoy each other’s company.
He was getting blood on his face, but he didn’t care, his body heaving with the weight of his sobs. He tried to be silent, to force the sounds to die in this throat. Ross was still staring at him, glassy eyed and pale.
He was so tired he felt it in his bones, having been up early that morning to scout the new meeting spot as a favour for Steve. He’d forgotten to have his morning coffee fix as well so he was running on no caffeine. It was his own fault; he had heard sobs coming from Natasha’s room – which was next to his – and Clint was up like a shot. It was a nightmare that had her calling out in a way she never would have done if she were conscious. Natasha prided herself on her thick skin and Clint knew if it had been anyone else but him that had gone to check on her, she would have been mortified.
He whipped the door open quickly, barrel of the gun level with a solid chest and a familiar looking jacket.
Then his fingers were pushing down both jeans and boxers until Tony had no choice but to step out of them before he ended up tripping over. He did eagerly, kicking them out the way so he stood in front of Steve naked, erect and beautiful.
Steve’s eyes flashed to the small smattering of scars across Tony’s left shoulder blade, a series of roundish dots, about five in total that almost looked like freckles. He filed the information away because now definitely wasn’t the time to ask and it wasn’t his business. Everyone had scars after all, Steve himself was covered in them. A jagged edge of a knife wound on his right thigh. A graze of raised skin near his ribs from an old bullet wound. He pushed those thoughts aside, Tony stopping him when he had reached the foot of the bed.
“This is my fucking house and I can fucking swear as much as I fucking WANT!” the only reason he screamed the last word was because he found out how hard the door was when in contact with a foot.
“Why didn’t you tell me you wanted to go to the bathroom as soon as you felt like to?” Steve couldn’t help scolding, frustrated because the buckles refused to be unfasten and it was obvious that Clint wouldn’t be able to hold it anymore.
Steve crossed the living room in a few strides, and he got a bad feeling when he couldn’t spot Clint as soon as he stepped into the kitchen. Had Clint gone away? Where? He wasn’t supposed to leave the room by himself when he was little without the permission of Phil or him. Unfortunately, little Clint wasn’t very good at following rules, so Steve wouldn’t be surprised at all if he had indeed left.
Steve tilted his head, a motion that indicated he hadn’t understood anything. “What? I seriously couldn’t get any of what you just said,” he confessed.
Four updates in a row, yay! XD I can't even believe it myself. Buuut... I'm gonna have a lot of work the next following weeks and also, Kingdom Hearts III was just released this week (any fans here?) sooo, I might not be able to get around to writing as often as I've been doing this year. I'll try though.
Steve led Tony to the bed and without further delay, he pushed Tony gently until he had his back against the mattress. Knowing what would happen next, Tony hurried to hide his face behind his teddy bear, but did nothing to refrain Steve from diapering him.
Seeing Clint on Steve’s lap had been too much. Besides the fact that Steve hadn’t seemed to notice Tony’s presence because of that until the incident happened, having to soothe Clint was something Tony found terribly outrageous. Steve was the one who had gotten injured, why did he have to be comforting Clint? If anything, Steve should’ve been the one who needed reassuring. Yes, Clint had clearly been Little, and considering how attached his Little self was to Steve, it’d been perfectly normal for him to get that overwhelmed. With or without pain, Steve would never ignore a frantic team member, especially if the person in question was in such vulnerable mindset. None of them had done anything wrong.
Eventually, Tony got tired and let himself lay limp on Steve’s lap, there was no way he could release himself if Steve didn’t want him to. Maybe if he suited up, but giving the circumstances and the way things had been playing out lately, JARVIS would refuse to send him one of his suits without a doubt. Tony was starting to believe Steve was secretly a hacker or something, and he must have changed some of JARVIS’ programming, because if it wasn’t like that, that would mean JARVIS had paired up with Steve on its own accord, and that made Tony feel very troubled and uneasy.
After twenty minutes, concern was eating Steve away to the point that he had decided to knock the door down. Breaking and destroying things wasn’t something he liked to do, though he just couldn’t stand hearing Clint cry on the other side and do nothing to comfort him. Fortunately, the strength he possessed allowed him to simply force the door instead of knocking it down. He stepped into the bathroom and found Clint curled up in the bathtub, sobbing miserably. Feeling sorry for him, Steve rushed towards the bathtub with the intention of cuddling Clint in his arms, but when he leaned forward to put Tony down, Tony hadn’t let him.
Tony kept waddling behind him, keeping a considerable distance between them during all the way. Phil didn’t slow down to be nearer Tony, though he kept a close eye on him so he wasn’t taken by surprised if Tony decided to run away one more time. Thankfully, he didn’t, and Phil was relieved to see that Tony was still behind him when he entered his and Steve’s room.
“I’m sleepy,” Clint complained when they stepped out of the elevator. Phil rubbed his thumbs against the back of his hand in sympathy, but he didn’t stop nor turned around.
Then, there was the matter of the blanket. Every time Steve went back to the nursery, he found creases and wrinkles on it, regardless of the fact that he always straightened it out before leaving – a habit he’d picked up when he was in the army. Or the matter of how the crib bumper pads seemed a bit looser and dented, as if someone had stepped on them or kicked them from inside.
“I know you like cars, that’s why I chose them,” Steve commented as Tony felt how the mattress sunk beside him, irrefutable sign that Steve had sat down, “but if you prefer another design, there are plenty you can choose from,” he proposed.
“Would you stop that already?” Tony demanded, sounding both angry and tired. “Don’t make me downgrade you to a simple personal assistant for phones.”
“Anything?” Tony echoed, turning his head and staring at him, letting him know he wasn’t going to put up with any empty promises.
There was nothing Steve would like more than to let Tony continue sleeping, he had fallen asleep when Steve had gone to the kitchen to prepare a bottle and that only showed how exhausted Tony had been – he hardly ever went to sleep willingly. But Tony’s nap had already lasted two hours, and if Steve allowed him to extend it more, Tony wouldn’t want to go to bed at night. Besides, Tony never got around to drinking the milk, and knowing him as well as he did, Steve was sure the only thing Tony had in his stomach was coffee. Sleeping was important, but so was eating.
“There’s an animated movie I want to see, JARVIS showed me the teaser and it does look fun, I can’t believe you haven’t watched it considering its about robots,” Steve commented, as he pushed him gently at his shoulders, encouraging to lay down. Tony refused.
Tony began to take deep breaths as an attempt to slow his breathing down, but after endless seconds, it became obvious he couldn’t. Something was wrong. After a nightmare, uneasiness was what he usually felt, sometimes anger and disorientation too, depending on what he had dreamed. However, what Tony was feeling now wasn’t any of those things, but fear. That was definitely not right. He couldn’t even remember when the last time he woke up and felt scared was. Perhaps when he was still a kid, or maybe a teenager. And yet, right now, Tony was sure he was frightened.
“So, now that you’re my baby again, there’s something daddy would like to know,” Steve proclaimed as he prevented Tony from taking his thumb closer to his mouth once more. “Why didn’t you want to be my baby anymore?”
“I know it’s difficult kiddo, but you have to try it sometime. It’ll be easier sooner or later. I promise,” Steve guaranteed, still holding the ice with his free hand.
Without minding his injuries and as much as his splinted arm allowed him, Steve pulled his baby into a crushing hug. Tony gave a startled squeak and froze, but soon he breathed a quiet sigh of relief and melted into him. It wouldn’t be a surprise if, regardless of what Steve had assured, Tony had been expecting a totally different reaction, one with more anger involved. But that wasn’t going to happen.
Tony’s stomach clenched. “That’s not possible, he didn’t tell me anything. He never leaves without letting me know he’s going on a mission.”
What would happen if he screwed up this time too? What if Tony never achieved to be as worthy as a kid as Steve was as a daddy? Would Steve get disappointed too? What if someday he slipped into his little headspace while being in a bad mood? Steve would certainly not want to deal with a cranky and bratty kid, would he? Tony needed to find a way to control this, because losing daddy when he could have avoided it was not an option.
“QUIT THAT NOW!” Steve yelled from the kitchen and Tony just froze. It had been his commander voice. Steve never used his commander voice when they weren’t at battle. He never used his commander voice when they were in the tower. And he certainly never used his commander voice when he was with him unless he was losing his patience, which was saying a lot of him.
“Tony, do you want me to be your daddy?” Steve asked bluntly. He could be too straightforward when he wanted to.
“We could do something right now,” Tony suggested, his voice clearly insinuating what he had in mind.
“I’m out of here,” Tony announced as he swung his legs off the bed, not liking Steve’s answer and failing to realize it had been a joke. Steve leaned over and grabbed Tony by the wrist before he could get out of reach, pulling him firmly, but gently, until he was back on the bed.
“I’m just saying, Sir, if Dummy, You or I have to see you pacing back and forth for one more day, there might be a possibility we learn to feel that sensation you call dizziness.”
Steve’s current state and restricted limbs movement hadn’t helped much either. The most effective way to calm down a fussy Tony was, without a doubt, to lift him in his arms and cuddle him – that claim about having a distaste for affectionate contact was nothing but pretense, and Steve knew it. Unfortunately, having an immobilized arm had prevented Steve from being able to pick up Tony, and he found himself with no other choice but to depend on caresses, strokes and soothing words to try to comfort his baby. That had certainly proved to be a much less efficient method.
“I don’t wear diapers!” Clint assured, his face tomato red. Steve raised an eyebrow. “OK, just that time, but it was Phil’s stupid idea! I don’t need diapers! I am a big boy and I am well potty-trained!” he insisted, slamming his hands on the table. It took him just a second to realize how childish he had sounded, and his face turned even redder.
It had been four weeks since the last time Tony and he had shared the bed, and it was just getting unbearable for Steve to wake up in an empty cold bed every single day. It wasn’t like Tony slept with him
“Shhh Tony, it’s OK, I promise we’ll talk tomorrow, but now, just go back to sleep, it’s midnight,” Steve said, rocking both of them back and forth.
“One of your teachers called. She was worried about you. She told me you’ve been seen sneaking these out for a while now. So, would you mind telling me why is that? Why is my twelve-year-old son stealing fucking diapers?” Howard asked, his voice far from polite or calm.
“Well, I bought some cheeseburgers, what if we eat them before you go back to your workshop?” Steve suggested on his way to the kitchen. It would be nice for once not to have to talk Tony into coming upstairs for dinner. “They taste better when they’re not reheated,” he commented, taking the burgers out of the bags.
“JARVIS,” Tony called, his voice sounding way too hoarse. Tony took a hand to his throat and winced when swallow saliva. It hurt.
At first, Steve had planned on simply asking Tony what he wanted to keep doing and what he didn’t, nothing like a straight answer to avoid more misunderstandings. However, the more he thought about it, the less he considered that a good idea. Tony wasn’t the get-to-the-point kind of guy, so expecting him to do that was sort of utopian. Giving him options, on the other hand, could make the whole process easier for him.
