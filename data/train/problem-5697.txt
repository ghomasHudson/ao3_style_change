“If I say no are you going to drop me on my ass on this very expensive tile floor?” Tony dug his fangs into Steve’s ear lobe and
“Yes.” Tony nodded slowly. “The Maria Carbonell attached to at least a dozen charitable organizations was my Mama. The uh-- the curly haired kid at her side in most of the older photos? It’s me. I went everywhere with her since Dad never wanted to be there. It was always me and Mama.”
“I hear your protests and call them invalid.” Clint held up three fingers. “First of all, absolutely yes because you’re wound so tight these days if you don’t get laid soon
His throat jerked as he forced the words past the gagging sympathy in his core. “What the fuck, kiddo. What in the
hadn’t forgotten to pay Tony, and the Omega’s eyes widened as he flipped through the bills and counted twice his usual allowance.
“I was trying to return the watch you bought me so I could buy extra diapers.” Tony said next and Steve just nodded, heart twisting
First it was the jacket that Tony never quite managed to return and Steve wouldn’t have accepted anyway, then it was the pillows. They went out for sushi one night and Tony mentioned loving spring rolls, so the Alpha had all the ingredients delivered for their next date night, and sent Tony home with the tools and extra ingredients to make it again. There was a discussion about sci-fi movies, so Steve ordered collectors edition sets of the Omega’s favorite series, and Tony didn’t dare mention he didn’t have a TV
relationship it was because I wasn’t exactly flush with cash.” Tony hopped up onto the counter to drink his coffee. “I figured it didn’t matter where I worked, just that I obviously didn’t make enough money and uh-- well, it’s sort of embarrassing to admit I work there. I’m sure Bucky told you--”
“You’ve got a splot of paint on your face.” Tony whispered. Steve cursed in surprise and frustration when he caught a look at himself in one of the mirrors, and the Omega laughed quietly. “Bright gold is a good look on you.”
like Sam and Diana and Bucky, they were nearly petite but somehow scary all the same. Even the Omega Scott who joked and teased and hugged Tony right off the bat scented like war and wariness, even the pocket sized Natasha with her bright red hair and jeweled green eyes shuttered
The sound of Steve’s laughter popped the private bubble they’d been sitting in while the game and conversation flowed around them, and when the game paused for halftime Steve’s friends gathered around ready to get to know Tony better.
“Nah nah nah, I’m serious! You can have my money! I’ll just paint all day and you can lay around looking pretty and it’ll be fine.” Steve decided. “It will be fine. We are meant to be together, Omega. You can be my Mona Lisa and I’ll be your Da Vinci.”
“Please don’t call him that, I cringe every time I imagine him bald and sixty.” Tony laughed a little. “But it was really nice. I got uh--” he lowered his voice. “--
“Oh trust me.” Tony’s smile was sad enough to make Steve want to weep right along with him. “This is like, four details and there’s at least four hundred more. Where I live and where I work doesn’t even scratch the surface.”
“Clearly.” Tony swallowed, then swallowed again when he still couldn’t draw a full breath. “I didn’t think I’d run into you in this park either. You never came here once with me and Mama, why are you here now?”
The Omega disappeared into the dining room with his plates then reappeared a minute later to finish his sentence, “...and Dad mode and sexy mode are two
“Then why did you ask about me?” Their milkshakes arrived in to go cups, and Tony took an experimental taste of his before deciding that
Steve didn’t look at Tony’s phone when he brought it back upstairs along with a bottle of water and a glass of wine, and he waited patiently while Tony checked whatever messages needed to be checked and then put it away on the nightstand.
“Hi sweetheart.” Steve’s cart was overflowing with absolute non-essentials, the ball pit and a children’s pool that wouldn’t be usable till the spring, an assortment of toys and what looked like the world’s biggest box of M&M’s, a dozen books, a 32 inch TV and a bluetooth speaker for Peter’s room so they could play his favorite songs from their phones.
“Was-- was it me?” He whispered, not really wanting to know but almost needing the confirmation so he could cry about it later. “Did I mess this up?”
. It had practically been a gift to share so many hours with so sweet a little soul and as Steve turned on the shower and started stripping out of his paint stained clothes, he started making a mental list of what to buy for their

Dinner was forgotten in favor of moving together, the same gorgeous dance as always, Tony’s eyes rolling back when Steve coaxed him to finish once with just his fingers, his mouth falling open with that first deep push as
“Good afternoon, Mr. Rogers. I’m sorry to bother you.” It was the manager from the jewelry store on State Street and they sounded as professionally pissed off as humanly possible. “We have something of a situation. You purchased a watch from us several weeks ago and unfortunately, I have to ask if you are aware of the location of your watch, as we have someone here trying to return it and claiming it is
“I don’t need paid to hang out with my best little bubba.” Clint scoffed, but pulled the money out anyway and nearly shouted, “Ho Ho Holy dollar bills Batman! Is this how much you usually get from Steve?!”
“Hey baby.” Bucky dialed the phone without thinking about it, and when his mate picked up, he started talking immediately. “You aren’t gonna
blankets and what their next steps may or may not be and he had been panicking wondering what Steve would say right up until the Alpha had told him he was pretty and that Steve had missed him and now-- and now--
. A football game watch party was tame compared to what most sugar babies did with their sugar daddy and Tony was lucky this was the first time an event with friends had come up. He’d chosen to show up, he wasn’t obligated to be here, Steve had invited him and it was gonna be fine, no one was going to judge him, he was going to be--
The Omega counted out each dollar, counted it out again and then double checked the amount on the bills and then his math for a third time before rubbing at his eyes and deciding that
“I am happy.” Steve’s kiss was a little less sweet and a little more possessive. “So happy. I don’t need anything else. Especially not dirty movies and wild fantasies.”
Steve had been adorably pouty about not getting to spend the whole day together but the Alpha had been mollified when Tony had trilled and purred over breakfast in bed and then still let Steve order him clothes from one of the boutiques along the Promenade.
, the emotions and fear of the past several hours weighing heavy at his shoulders and tightening steel bands
“Fine.” Steve cleared his throat, then cleared it again. “I like the name Archie. I think it’s cute and old fashioned and I imagine a little red headed boy terrorizing the matrons in church.”
There was a six pack of beer waiting on the dining room table of the Brooklyn apartment, a label Steve remembered from the war, authentically old fashioned and just chilled enough to make sure that first sip went down perfectly smooth.
“You’re so wet.” Steve marveled, crooning sweetly when Tony arched into a tentative lick at his nipples and fastening his mouth over the stiff bud to suckle as he worked a second finger in as far as he could manage, trying to stretch the Omega as gently as he could. Steve was big,
“Okay.” Clint nudged the rest of the burger towards Tony so the little brunette would get at least a
inside, slick and rippling, his body instinctively trying to clench up tighter to keep the Alpha in, and Steve fought for every stitch of his self control and held himself tense, muscles straining as he moved slow slow achingly
“You are delightfully old fashioned to wish that, Mr. Rogers.” Tony whispered. “But I didn’t need rescuing, I just needed some help.”
Tony was visibly shaken, but neither Natasha nor Bucky were watching the Omega. Instead they were watching
parts of Tony’s story came out little by little, quiet conversations after Peter had gone to bed, hesitant questions and uncomfortable answers as Steve tried hard not to pry as he learned more about his Omega and the way life had brought Tony and Peter to this place.
“We really really are, but it's your own damn fault for staying friends with us.” Bucky licked over his fangs and purred teasingly at the exasperated blond. “Seriously though. Enough with the cleaning. The Omega isn’t going to care about how your house looks, you live in Brooklyn Heights for Christ’s sakes. You have a kitchen bigger than most people’s apartments and a bedroom that overlooks the water so you can get romantic and shit to the rhythm of the waves. Is this guy staying the night?”
“I just paid a gross amount of money for a steak, they can judge me however much they want.” Steve’s smile stretched wider as he raised his hand for the check. “Do you want all of this food? I wasn’t aware that a porcini was a mushroom until they handed me the plate and I’m definitely not going to eat it. Mushrooms are horrifying, who picks things out of the ground and tosses them on a plate?”
Steve sniffed, his nose wrinkling as the smell of acrid blossoms burned his senses. “--has you still freaked out like this. A Command is unacceptable.
Another one of those noises like Steve’s brain had failed to compute and Tony tucked his chin, looked up at his boyfriend from beneath his lashes and whispered, “You wanna breed me, Captain? Fill me up real full till I’m spilling over? Might be worth a try…or two.”
Tony only remembered pancakes with his Mama, and those had stopped the year he was thirteen and Maria passed away. A part of the Omega's soul echoed
Tony couldn’t stop laughing, clapped his hands over his mouth and tried not to cackle while his Alpha was
The Omega punctured his fangs right through his lip trying to decide whether to laugh at his stupid boyfriend or clock the giant Alpha over the head, and settled on, “Steve. You’ve gone from stupid swear words to talking like a country bumpkin from the 1920’s who’s never seen a wheel before. Cut it out or I’ll leave you here and make you walk home.”
“But it’s gonna wear on him.” Clint finished. “Always askin’ you and always bein’ told no, especially after not seeing you for a while.”
“Hi.” Tony looked at their cart, looked over at his practical purchases of toiletries and ingredients, then looked up at Steve. “Having fun?”
“...Tash, I just found Steve’s boyfriend working in this nasty diner in the worst part of town and I sorta need’ta know why.”
I found him livin’ like that and knew you would want him out! I was tryna rescue him not tryna scare him! And yeah, I had to use a Command on him to get him into the car but--”
“If I have to take Pete back to Urgent Care cos he gets worse, it will take all of my extra money in my box.” Shoulders slumping defeated, Tony started walking in slow circles again, rubbing at Peter’s back and trying to hide weary tears in the toddlers thick hair. “I’ll be right back to not being sure if I’ll make rent and not being sure if I’ll have enough money to eat. I will never

“Yes sir, one of our one bedroom suites.” She raised her eyebrows expectantly. “Would you like me to have a porter escort you to check in and then you can return here to the lounge if you’d like?”
“Natasha!” Steve shut that question down and the redhead only smirked. “No running names through your wildly sketchy databases!”
“See? You balance me out. Perfect. Such a perfect pretty Omega. When I’m sober I’ll call you again and convince you I mean what I say, alright?”
and Tony laughed softly, dotting a kiss to Steve’s lips. “I thought the stereotype was that Omegas loved shopping and Alpha’s only tolerated it, not that Alpha’s secretly binge shop and Omegas have to sigh and roll their eyes over the excess.”
“I’m gonna take care of you.” Steve’s voice bottomed out in a growl, blue eyes hazing red as he stared down at Tony, each thrust purposeful and shocking hard, the blunt head of the thick cock
His phone rang and Steve’s heart about jumped into his throat. Maybe Tony had been thinking about him as much as he’d been thinking about the Omega…?
. I can’t imagine the public transit system is much better than it used to be when I had to ride it everywhere, and I know the subway doesn’t come this far up. I certainly don’t want you walking so this seems like a good compromise, don’t you think?”
“I um-- I--” Tony was at a loss for words, suddenly seeing the mess as a bonding moment between his son and the Alpha he loved, the hand prints as artwork Steve was happy to have all over his walls, the paint on the floor and broken brushes evidence of a day spent in laughter. This was hours Pete and Steve had spent together, money apparently not an issue as Steve had allowed the toddler to paint all over brand new canvas and had most likely purposefully broken the easel legs so Pete could reach without sitting on a stool. Hours and hours of messy, innocent fun that had left them both worn out and happy.... “I-- I--”
Steve gave up waiting on a message from Tony and put his phone away, but he couldn’t deny the way his thoughts lingered on the Omega, on the honey highlights in the dark eyes and the soft blush when Steve had touched him, fangs so delicate they made Steve wonder if Tony’s
“Gonna make you come and come till your eyes roll back.” Steve panted hotly into Tony’s throat. “Gotta make sure I get you knocked up good, gotta make sure it takes good and deep, you gonna take all of me this time?”

“Tony.” Steve wrapped both arms around the Omega and held him tight as he finished, rocking into the sweet body and groaning through each pulse of his cock. He was half out of his mind with the need to sink his fangs into the porcelain skin and mark Tony like the Omega was so intent on marking him but Steve locked his jaw tight and
. I was already heat drunk and barely lucid but he started touching me here and the pressure never let up and I just--”
“Hi doggie!” Peter didn’t have an ounce of fear in his little body and he swaggered right up to the oversized golden and patted at him vigorously. “Hi!”

“You’ve got me there.” Still reeling from the announcement that the pretty Omega had a genius level intellect but intrigued enough to want to know more, Steve leaned against the bookshelf and motioned for Tony to continue. “Keep going, tell me more about myself and my living room I never use.”
, kept spilling, kept emptying his balls into Tony’s center and Tony cried out once, twice, put a hand to his stomach as he started to feel heavy and
“It’s fine.” Tony was laughing, eyes watering and nose stinging as he coughed up another swallow of water into the napkin. “Oh my god, you just-- you said that out loud and the old lady behind you whipped around real fast and stared at me all funny.”
They were delirious, overwhelmed being so close after so long apart, panting and gasping into each other’s mouths, Steve’s knot aching and the Omega’s hole shivering clenching trying to pull him in deeper. “
Tony didn’t say goodbye, didn’t smile or even wave as he let his mate turn and walk them away down the path, leaving Howard alone in the cold behind them.
“Not an actual Amazon.” Tony pointed at Diana. “Not a redhead who is scary beyond all reason. Not Scott, who acts goofy but I’m almost positive could kill me four different ways. Steve, you’re an
“I want to tell you not to go.” Peggy said softly. “But I know better than most that sometimes we just have to do what we have to do to survive.”
“Come here.” Steve discretely worked the condom off his still sensitive length and tucked it into the ruined scraps of Tony’s panties, pulled his pants up enough to cover himself then picked Tony right up off the floor. He stood in one easy motion and cradled the Omega blanket and all up to his chest bridal style. “I know it’s barely ten o’clock, but I’d rather lay in bed and talk half the night than sit down here half dressed. That okay?”
Tony checked his phone quickly. Peggy had been happy to keep Peter until tonight since Tony had planned on returning the watch and then shopping for a couple of hours before the sale ended, and even with being detained and them calling Steve down to the store he still had some time so maybe….
putting the errands off and in some cases outright refusing to go without offering any excuse besides a hesitant smile and a quick shake of his head.
“Hey, nice towels are absolutely something to spoil me with.” Tony sniffed. “And that’s what I want for my birthday.”
“This isn’t really dating.” Steve cut in. “And I know that. It’s an arrangement and that’s fine but if this was a
“You’ll get used to my friends.” Steve changed the subject as he leaned back into the pillows and rested a big hand at Tony’s bare thigh beneath the covers. “And don’t-- don’t worry about the questions about birthdays and kids and that sort of thing. We haven’t been together all that long, some discussions just haven’t happened yet. Don’t think that anyone holds that against you.”

, rushing to put everything away while keeping a close eye on the baby. “Peter will be fine with some rest and fluid and something to keep the fever broken.”
“Oh oh oh, I’m sorry.” Steve immediately soothed it with a kiss, lingering over the reddened skin and murmuring tender over the blooming bruise. “Baby, I’m so sorry, I didn’t mean to hurt you, I wouldn’t ever hurt you, you know that right?”

senseless too, and there’s just not a whole lot you can do about it.” Steve dropped a quick kiss on Tony’s nose. “Do you want a puppy too? Look at this little blond gal, she’s about as sweet as can be. What about her?”
The steel bands seemed to loosen at his chest and the Omega was able to take a full breath for the first time in what felt like hours, relief washing his scent and leaving him limp.
“Steve, I don’t want you cancelling your birthday plans for us.” Tony said quietly and Steve just said as quietly, “I’ve never had birthday plans better than this, so what’s the issue?”
thinking about me going back to school and roleplaying naughty student and strict teacher things at home?”
“Look at you.” Steve was practically shaking with the effort of holding back as he coaxed Tony’s legs open wider, practically salivating over the sight of lacy panties barely containing Tony’s cock, wiry curls over the edge of the narrow cut thong and a damp stain on the rose gold lingerie where Tony was twitching,
“I just want to take care of you.” Steve repeated, and Tony could barely get the words past the lump in his throat--

A particle board dresser was wedged next to the bed and filling still open drawers and stacked in neat rows on top the dresser-- clothes.
, size of Steve buried in his ass, grinding deep against him without ever pulling out, pushing Tony through every clench and shudder and milky white spasm.
Once they were out of sight around the corner of the walkway, Steve asked softly, “Are you alright, my mate? Did I overstep just now?”
actually smile every once in a while, and when he’d first sent it to Tony’s phone, Tony had only rolled his eyes, but now the picture actually came in handy as he uploaded it to the site.
“It’s beautiful up here.” The Omega looked around the remodeled loft, at the huge windows that caught the afternoon sun and the pristine walls with various canvas and supplies neatly organized along the edge of a uniquely ornate area rug. There were three different easels spread across the far wall where the sunlight fell the longest, a small bar with a gorgeous cedarwood top and a display of Steve’s favorite scotch, bottles of sparkling water and the most recent edition-- a bottle of Tony’s favorite wine.
The high end steakhouse by the water with the view overlooking the city skyline had been Bucky and Natasha’s idea.
“Are you kidding?” Peggy Carter was Tony’s downstairs neighbor, a sweet soul who had taken one look at Tony and Peter the first day they moved in and promptly decided she was going to be
“I have been commissioned before.” Steve felt foolish holding the only menu, but Tony didn’t seem bothered by it, so he kept perusing the list of entrees and trying to make a decision for the both of them. “And I dabble in a little bit of everything, though painting is where my passion lies. I turned the loft of my house into an art studio, and that’s what I do most days, sit up there and paint.”
That was fair of course, working and getting paid was always a better option than flirting with a guy acting maybe a
“Privacy Protocol?” Tony was halfway under one of his cars, but he scooted out when he heard the noise of the lock down filters on the windows. “What’s up, babe? Gonna finally
But Tony shook his head so Steve grinned, bared his teeth and dug his teeth into Tony’s shoulder to rumble, “Take all of me, baby doll. Every last drop. You feel me inside of you, filling you up? You feel me?”
…Steve did the human equivalent of blue screening, expression going slack and eyes blanking out, all motion stopping and mouth falling open as he stared. “Wh–what?
He rolled his hips pointedly and Steve turned his face into Tony’s soft thigh and sighed reverenly. “Damn Omega, who’s to say I don’t intend to spoil the hell out of
“Pretty Omega.” the female Alpha was a solid six inches shorter than him, but she still cupped his chin and stared into his eyes as she asked, “How are you? Is our dumb friend treating you alright? Are you eating enough? Sleeping okay? I would like to see the baby, but I will wait until you’re ready to introduce him to me. Just know I have actual piles of toys in the car for him if that day ever comes.”
“You’re damn--” The Alpha cut his eyes at Peter guiltily then corrected, “You’re gosh darn right couples do that sort of thing all the time
“It didn’t hurt, nothing you ever do hurts.” Tony pushed up into the next kiss at his mouth, wove his fingers into Steve’s hair and pushed the soldier down his body, not letting up until he felt a soft kiss turned
There was Peter’s favorite cereal and Tony’s favorite blend of coffee and the salsa that Steve practically drank on taco nights. Cleaning products since the service only came once every three weeks and the current spray Steve used gave him a headache. Twin sized bed sheets because the Omega knew the race car bed was inevitable, a water proof liner to help with the potty training, and a nightlight for the bedroom since Tony knew he’d end up in Steve’s bedroom full time and he didn’t want Peter to worry about the dark.
“Don’t you worry.” Steve stood all in one motion, swooping Tony into his arms effortlessly and cradling him close as he
would have been taken in by the way an honestly pleased smile had transformed Steve from looking stern to looking almost boyishly excited.
“First we put the milk in, then we add some butter.” Tony sang as he stirred the macaroni and cheese for Peter’s dinner, balancing the toddler on one hip as he cooked. “What do we add next, Bubba?”
“Yeah. He pays me cash to avoid the taxes and that sure makes it difficult to complain about things like cut wages or missing credit card tips.” Tony’s little fangs flashed when he grimaced. “But it was the only way I could guarantee money to pay rent and take care of Pete.”
.” Steve opened the door for the Uber and waited until Tony was in and settled before asking, “Two weeks?”
right off the bat, Steve would ask questions and Tony didn’t want to have to provide those sort of answers.
Tony took the quick break to scroll through any messages on his phone, checking notifications and firing off a quick text to Peggy to check in on Pete. He really did hate everything about how much his life had changed in the last three years but Tony would never--
“That’s alright.” Tony rubbed his forehead into Steve’s heartbeat, calming down with every second the Alpha held him. “I'd rather have a paint stained Alpha instead of that prissy, perfectly dressed Alpha behind the counter any day of the week.”
“No, I’m off shift until Tuesday unless someone calls in sick.” Tony tried not to sound worried, but his apple blossom scent wavered
“There’s no sense lingering on the things that can’t be changed in the past.” Tony answered softly, pragmatically, “But does me being a Stark change anything moving
spoiling Tony’s usual sweet scent. “Peter having a fever has no bearing on how close or how far away you were, and thinking that way will only stress you out.”
.” The Alpha pushed Tony’s hands away and pinned the Omega to the floor with a claiming, almost punishing kiss. Any plea for faster or harder was muffled beneath a shove of tongue, any coaxing mewl or wriggle of impatience silenced by the bloody sting of teeth at his bottom lip and only once Tony squealed and stilled

Then in six months you just pretend to be surprised when we announce we want to lock you down mated.”

“Just for that, you're going to get the lowest tier ambiance available and have to eat spaghetti while watching a movie.” Steve pointed the pasta fork at the Omega faux threateningly. “Go on. Living room. Find a movie and get ready to try and look cute while balancing pasta on your lap and sipping wine without spilling it on my never used couch. Go on.”
“...I’m falling in love with Steve.” Tony whispered, hugging Peter tight and trying not to let his voice crack. “I’m falling in love with him.”
“Right.” Bucky cleared his throat. “And did’ja know he lives in a studio apartment just right up the street from there? Real piece of shit place with mold on the walls and rot in the floors and he can’t afford nothin’ more than that?”
“Heya sweetheart.” Steve twisted around in Tony’s arms so they could kiss, cradling Tony’s face in soapy hands and sealing their mouths together. “
Six minutes after Bucky had slipped out the front door and once again not locked it behind him-- Steve needed to figure out
“Ugh, I’m so much needier than I thought I was.” Tony mentally kicked himself for being ridiculous and readied himself to reply something nice but aloof and

“Pretty Omega.” Steve whispered, nearly crooned and for a terrifying moment Tony thought he would pass out before the Alpha finally eased away and offered him a quick smile. “Anyway, now that I’ve gone and made you self conscious for no reason at all, as my profile stated I’m thirty five, gonna be thirty six this summer. Does that big of an age difference matter to you?”
“–yeah, I need you there.” Steve rocked forward once, twice, helpless to resist the sweet heat of Tony’s body. “Stay
“-- the only that would matter is whether or not you and Peter were okay, even if I wasn’t in the picture.” Steve went back to unwrapping his new utensils. “My friends aren’t always the most tactful but they always have the best of intentions no matter which way they’re coming at a problem. I understand if you’re nervous to see them again, but from what Bucky’s been telling me, Tasha is ready to spoil the hell out of Peter and he knows he owes you an apology, so don’t worry about it.”
A deep breath. “Except I didn’t come out of it fifteen minutes later like they do in those adult films, it took me the better part of a day after my heat broke to have the energy to just
Neither Alpha nor Omega could have said what the movie was. No one cared about the movie when it was honestly difficult not to splatter red sauce on the pristine couch and when the first splatter was from
“Don’t make me wait.” The Omega was surprised at how greedy he was for all this, spreading his legs faster when Steve didn’t open him up quick enough, pushing up into the tentative press at his hole and grabbing at the condom to rip it open, fumbling and trying to help Steve to roll it down towards his knot. “Steve-- Steve come on--”
As they were checking out in the long lines, Steve picked up one of the learning activity books Peter had picked out and wondered, “Tony, do you want to look into preschools for Peter?”

beautiful, Omega. But you’ve got a look in your eye that tells me you’ve seen a lot more of this world than anyone at twenty or twenty one should have ever seen. It makes you seem older when we talk sometimes, that’s all. Based on that alone, I wouldn’t have been surprised if you told me you
Tony’s smaller fangs cut through the Alpha’s skin in a flash of pain, and Steve shouted in release when his cock throbbed again, coming a second time with the burn of fangs and the clench of his mate’s body tight at his knot. “
“Nope, sure don’t.” Bucky agreed immediately. “That’s what I made Tasha on our third date and she ain’t got off my knot
“Sure thing.” Tony scrambled up from the floor, tossing away a wrench and his goggles, wiping grease off his hands onto his holey jeans and immediately jogging over to pucker up for a slightly oil-smelling kiss. “How are you?”
!” Tony wheezed when the Alpha abruptly shoved him back onto the bed and covered him again, Tony’s back curved into an arc and Steve’s cock slotted into his center. “Fuck!”
“Stop.” Steve cut in, and the Omega cringed. It hurt to admit his shortcomings out loud, to confess that he couldn’t feed himself and if Steve was irritated about it….
Omega at that. He was easily over six feet tall towering over Tony, the cut off tank top emphasizing big arms and big hands and though he slouched when he moved there was a good amount of power in that lean frame and Bucky found himself lingering, focusing on the blond instead of keeping his attention on Tony.
“This many.” Two fingers, and Tony had to work the words past the emotion in his throat to clarify, “He’s three in August.”
“I’d love that, thank you.” Tony reached into his apron and pulled out his tips from the day, stuffing them into Clint’s pocket. “Keep those since you’re covering for me.”
The party wound down about an hour after the game finished, the last of the snacks devoured and the various couples calling for rides to find their way home. The brownstone went from overflowing with noise and laughter to nearly somber silent with in a matter of minutes, nothing but the sound of Tasha doing a few dishes in the kitchen and the quiet scrape of furniture as Tony tried to rearrange the chairs and footstools to their normal position.
“That’s good–!” Tony was gasping, drooling, grabbing at the sheets and clutching at the pillows as his body jerked back and forth with each hard push. His cock bobbed unnoticed between his legs as Steve dug bruises at his hips and used them as leverage to yank Tony back again and again onto his length.
“I didn’t know about the car bed, but you’re absolute right, darling.” She went right to work poking around in the cupboards for anything worth saving, anything she might want to add to her own apartment. “You have always tried your best to provide for Peter and that won’t change whether you are living in this shit hole or riding down Fifth Avenue. All that baby knows from you is
“Instead of me just being boring and too busy for you?” Tony offered with a small smile, and the Alpha was quick to croon, “I never thought that, Tony. Just figured you were playing hard to get till you had me tripping all over the place trying to spoil you, wrapped around your finger and damn near begging for kisses.”
“Uh huh, so how are you doin’?” Bucky’s pale eyes softened in concern for his friend. “I was only sorta jokin’ about the sugar baby thing, but what, now you’re talkin’ to that Omega every day and texting all the time and looking all glum and dumb if you can’t see him… what’s up? You guys okay?”
“Mr. Rogers.” the waiters at the steakhouse were all Betas, neutral biologies and bland scents and well trained in the art of catering to wealthy Alphas and their dates. “The wine list, so you can make a decision for yourself and your guest.”
“You can wear whatever color you want at our wedding.” the Alpha repeated calmly. “But I think if you’re going to wear a traditional dress or even a bride-suit, ivory or eggshell would be softer against your skin instead of blinding white. Trust me.” he winked. “I’m an artist, I know all about these sort of things.”
The Sugar Seeking Sugar app hadn’t left much room in the profile for personal information. All the questions had been related to how much money a sugar baby needed or a sugar daddy was willing to spend, openness to sexual encounters, age in relevance to drinking and what their favorite alcohol was.
The phone call distorted into cackling laughter as Tony exploded into giggles at Clint’s nonsense and Clint guffawed a few times at his own shenanigans before the line abruptly disconnected, the blond Omega apparently deciding he’d had enough of listening to Bucky and would rather wipe tables.
“Missed you too.” It was impossible to hide even a little bit when everything was so open, and the words tumbled out raw. “
But last week Tony had come over for their regularly scheduled date and they’d cooked dinner together, talking over easy music and swapping places in the kitchen as they tried to cook seafood linguini and chocolate lava cake dessert. The dessert had been a complete disaster, most of the sea food had been eaten as it cooked and dinner had ended up being
*Gentle reminder not to throw your phone or screech at Bucky, he's doing the best he can with the situation he's been given and is coming at this whole thing from a position of good intentions both for Steve and then for Tony, and sure, maybe he reacts with all the tact of a bulldozer, but we don't call the guy Bronco because he's subtle, okay?*
….Bucky took the Live, Laugh, Love pillow with him when he went, partly because it was a stupid fuckin’ pillow and no self respecting anybody should have one, partly because it was just plump enough to sit up under Tasha’s hips when they were in bed.
“I know what you said.” the Alpha interrupted. “I know what you said, and I’m not trying to call you a liar or accuse you of-- of-- I dunno what I’d even be accusing you of, but I don’t want to do that. It’s just that you’ve never missed a date before and we text every single day even when you’re at work so when you just disappeared for a week…”
The Alpha didn't comment when Tony nearly choked on his wine, but his fangs glinted in a pleased grin when the pretty Omega blushed pink clear to his ears.
as he watched Tony admiring himself in the mirror, and he told the manager, “He’ll wear these out, I’ll take the box and a cleaning set for them as well. Take the price out of the money from the watch and I’ll take the rest back in cash.”
“Yes.” Tony dug his nails in the breadth of Steve’s back, reached low to palm at the Alpha’s thick cock through the front of Steve’s pants. “Yes, Steve. Right here. Please.”
“Thanks for callin’ the diner, this is Clint speaking. I’d read you off today’s specials but they’re all literally terrible. What’s up?”
Not even lingerie had been enough to push Steve into more than just slightly more intense kisses and Tony only had one more trick in his book before he got too carried away and Steve reverted to the always good but always goddamn
“No.” Tony shook his head quickly. “No, he doesn’t even know. By the time I realized the morning after pill hadn’t taken, he was long gone and I had no way to get a hold of him. I never even tried. It’s just us.”
“The roadster?” Steve’s blue eyes flickered curiously. “Really? That’s not what I expected you to say.”
.” the Alpha growled and Tony flushed all over again, anticipation spiking sharp in his scent. “How long will you be out shopping?”
“I kill people, love.” the Alpha said flatly. “I collect data and then use the data to kill them. If we’re being honest about all this other stuff, we might as well be honest about that.”
“Tony.” Steve portioned out half a dozen pancakes and dotted extra chocolate chips on top. “Omega, did you never tell me about all this cos you thought I’d stop seeing you? Or
to promise to stay in contact with me.” Steve murmured, pained. “That’s not what I was trying to make you do, I just can’t shake the feeling that you aren’t telling me something and if it’s none of my business then that’s just fine but I um--”
in Steve’s cedar scent made Tony a hitch anxious and he propped himself up on an elbow so he could see Steve’s expression. “What’s going on?”
as his cheeks were held wider and wider apart so Steve could watch himself disappearing into the tight channel. “God, look at you taking all of me, opening up like this, I wanna fuck you till you can’t even walk, make sure you know I’m the only one that belongs right here.”
“You’re a terrible human being.” Tony scrunched down further and tried to disappear. “Why are we even friends?”
about every dollar creep into his tone. “I feel like that’s a very easy way for you to track my purchases and a very easy way for you to just cut me off all at once if I did something to make you angry.”
“Yeah, honey.” The endearment slipped out unnoticed, Steve’s gaze trained at Tony’s mouth and the porcelain fangs that made an appearance as the Omega smiled again.
?” Clint wondered, and the Alphas looked at each other then at him and stated, “It won’t be the other way around, Omega. We won’t be breaking up with you so…”
“That’s not fair at all.” Tony grumbled, and the other Omega nodded, “Yeah well, it is what it is. I either gotta stay with Barney, figure out some way to afford to live by myself which I can’t since this place only lets me work part time, or I’ve gotta get mated up. Otherwise the state’ll want to put me in one of those Omega homes.”
, the more anxious I get. How do I even bring the topic up? Oh by the way, I’m a Dad and have a two year year old? By the way, I tried to return the watch you bought me to buy diapers? How do I do that?”

“Too late bud, we already saw you grinning like a Goofy Gooberson.” Bucky set two big bag of groceries down on the table, then turned to take the smaller bag from his mate. “Why do you look all stupid like that? You texting that Omega?”
“I just don’t want to feel like I’m being ganged up on in my own home.” he fussed anxiously the night before the party. “Most of your friends were being generically nosy but Bucky and Natasha sort of went for the jugular the first time we met! And then knowing that Bucky was basically stalking me? That he’d already made up his mind that I was
“Thank you.” Tony had set his required monthly allowance on his profile as enough to pay his rent. For most Omegas and every single Alpha on the page, it would seem like a
“Bought and paid for.” Steve confirmed. “But those aren’t why I wanted to eat up here. Didn’t bring you up here to show you what I’m paid to work on, I wanted to show you my favorite personal projects.”
“I know.” Steve finally smiled. “I know you’re not. I’m just saying, Tony. I can handle whatever’s complicated about your life if you ever decide to share it with me.”
, Steve conflicted by what he was saying even as he forced himself to say it, “If you wake up tomorrow morning and decide not to stay, if you decide to take Peter and leave at any point and time, this is

when he saw the size of the plug Tony had thought ahead to bring, whispered quiet pleading praise into his lover’s ear as he slowly carefully pulled himself free of the still clenching heat and worked the plug in instead, watching in absolute awe as the thick base disappeared inside Tony’s twitching hole and lodged into place.
as he sucked his fingers clean. “In fact, you could just finish all the way inside me and I wouldn’t mind being
It was a damn miracle, a fairy tale ending to this part of their story and Tony put a hand to his aching heart as he whispered, “You know, I just might keep you Mr. Rogers.”
“Alright darling.” Peggy patted at Tony’s hand and pretended she didn’t see the uncertainty in Tony’s eyes. “I’ll see you a little bit later tonight.”
“Take it.” Steve was panting, sweat glistening off his muscles and flopping damp hair into his eyes. He kept a firm hold at Tony’s ass so the little brunette couldn’t scoot away and set his other hand at Tony’s navel, pressing hard and groaning when he could feel the bump of
He stood and brought Tony back into the spray of water, smoothing back the wild curls and cupping Tony’s face in both his hands, bending to kiss him and crooning adoringly, “Sweetheart, you’re so good to me. The apartment and the music and the way you dress up for me– letting me fill you up like that, I– I– I never imagined–”
, he’d never done the sugar daddy thing before so maybe asking to see someone more before a certain amount of dates or-- or money just wasn’t the right thing to do?
to whisper but since no one could honestly whisper while drinking, it was still fairly loud. “When I get home we should talk about you moving in, huh? Forget all this sugar baby stuff and just move you right in for real. You can have all my money, I don’t care.”
“Fuck.” Steve pushed his forehead into Tony’s shoulder and exhaled noisily. “Fuck that’s right. Not a drop.”
It had been a long time since the Omega had bought new clothes that weren’t from the Walmart clearance section, and even buying from Walmart had been a few months ago. He’d purchased three different button ups to wear on dates with Steve and of course new underthings, but everything
Steve paused only briefly, “Honey, I want to take care of you and right now this is the only way I can do it. Use the card for what you need and don’t think twice about it. And if you aren’t feeling up to a date on your first day off next week, that’s fine. Maybe just-- maybe just call me? Even if I can’t see you, I’d like to talk to you.”
“God, if I would have known a trip to the park was just an excuse for you to have a long conversation, I would have brought hot chocolate and snacks.” Tony huffed, faux irritated. “Alright Alpha, what else do you want to talk about?”
thing I’m going to do is buy three months of diapers and then clothes in the next size up for Pete.”
“Two weeks.” the Omega confirmed, and then with a smile sweet enough to turn the Alpha into a puddle of mush-- “I can’t wait.”
“That’s my dad.” All the color washed right out of Tony’s face and left the Omega pale, shaking. “That’s-- that’s my
“You’ll call me to babysit Pete every once in a while, won’t you?” she whispered, and Tony whispered back, “Of course. And have you over for dinner-- I’ll pay for the car to come and get you. We won’t just let you go, Peggy. You’re family.”
“But wait, there’s more.” Clint dried his hands on a towel and then put them on his hips. “Tony, why are you holding yourself back from the Golden Giant. That guy clearly loves your peaches, definitely wants to shake that tree--”
suggested that they leave the tip for you if they didn’t want me to call the cops and run them up on charges for blatant sexual harassment. Four Alphas ganging up on one teeny tiny Omega who is put at the distinct disadvantage of being privy to the ‘customer’s always right’ rule? They’d end up in jail for sure.”
“Once Steve got home, things were okay pretty quickly.” Tony tilted his head and trilled at the anxious Alpha so Bucky would no there were no deepset hard feelings. “I was unbalanced for a few hours but I was fine by morning.”
A young couple on the second floor were grateful for the still useable crib for their newest baby and the particle board dresser went into Peggy’s apartment as additional storage for her nicer clothes. The Alpha had a small Army pension that paid enough for her larger apartment and the dresser that had taken up so much room in Tony’s tiny place seemed small in her bedroom.  Any extra soap or cleaning products Peggy kept as well since Tony didn’t want to leave them and he certainly didn’t need them anymore.
Another rock, another shriek of excitement and this time Steve called, “Looks great, Bug! You want to keep that one? I’ll put it in my pocket!”
Tony was still staring at the usually easy going Alpha in shock when Steve came back to put an arm around his waist and ask conversationally, “So. What are we buying today?”
At this time last year he’d been sitting in the huge brownstone all alone, not finding much reason to leave his house or even leave the loft, rain-checking events with his friends because somehow being in a group made him feel even more lonely. But now?
“I kept an eye on your Social Security number after you left, you know.” Howard said abruptly. “I assumed the first thing you would do was register for government help for the pregnancy or at least apply for an abortion at one of the clinics.”
to exchange it, they assumed a waiter couldn’t afford it and instead of thinking it was a gift, they immediately decided you stole it.”
Steve hadn’t heard from Tony in nearly eight days by the the time their scheduled date came and went.
“...I love them.” the Omega paused in replacing a particularly pretty camisole in crystal blue with tiny, embroidered roses at the seams, lingering over the matching shorty cut panties. “How long did it take you to pick everything out?”
“That’s okay.” Tony hid a too big smile behind another tiny sip, and didn’t let himself think just then about why it made him happy Steve didn’t want him dating anyone else. “I’m glad you don’t have anyone else either, even if it’s only because you’re wildly awkward.”
“You just handed me an envelope with what I can only imagine is probably three or four times my usual allowance.” Tony said softly. “You bought me probably a thousand dollars worth of clothes here. The spa certificate is more money than I’ve spent on myself in years, you cook me dinner and take me places, you’re offering to take me on vacation if I have a bad day, giving me your debit card so I can buy groceries anytime I need it.”
“Sleeping like a paint covered angel.” Tony smiled, the tips of his little fangs peeking out from beneath pink lips. “He’ll need a hell of a bath tomorrow.”
“I’ll call you an Uber.” Steve offered after he paid the bill and they got their jackets back on. “This far downtown there’s no parking so we’ll have to walk to the next block to be picked up, is that alright?”
-- that finding a job as an unbonded Omega was difficult, finding a place that would rent to an unbonded Omega with a kid was damn near impossible.
The Alpha’s steps were steady and slow down the stairs, his grip on Peter secure and careful as he took the baby to the bedroom, performed a very quick diaper change on a nearly comatose toddler and tucked him into the bed on a towel, securing the mesh gate that kept Peter from rolling right off the high edge on either side. Lights off except for the bathroom so Tony could see when he came to the bed and Steve turned to tip toe down the hall and get ready for a much needed shower.
“I--” Tony’s first instinct was to to shelter Peter from the soldier with her sharp scent and bristling demeanor but there was something deep in Natasha’s green eyes that felt like trust and
Another one of those smiles that was closer to a grimace. “--he even offered to drive me to get the morning after pill, he admitted that he’d taken the condom off cos it felt too good and that makes him a grade A asshole sure, but he told me he’d help me out with the pill and recovery once he realized how messed up I was. He wasn’t a bad kid, but neither of us really understood the enormity of sharing a heat, much less what it meant to be settled. I’d never been settled before Peggy, I was only seventeen. And he was just--”
? After what I did? C’mon sugar I’d understand if you never trusted me again a minute in your life but--but-- really? I can meet him?”
Peter got tired of waiting for food and changed direction to demanding breakfast cakes and milk, and when Steve stood up the Alpha just brought the baby with him, stuffed bunny and all, to start pulling plates down to serve the food.
He placed a gentle hand on the still dozing toddler. “Which… I guess Bucky told you about where I was living?”
, and as soon as Steve could talk again without snarling he broke away from the flurry of kisses and bent to mouth worship into Tony’s ears and down his throat, “Pretty Omega, such a sweet Omega, that was so good, you are so
she rarely got the chance to show and for a reason the Omega couldn’t quite put his finger on, he nodded and said, “Actually, I’d love for you to meet Peter right now.”
He stopped, cocked his head curiously at the apartment door and the new-ish doorknob on it. “What happened here? Did they already re rent the place?”
“It’s supposed to be a visual representation of the journey from loneliness and grief to hope, Buck.” Steve cut in before the big brunette could offer some off base wildly sarcastic opinion about the painting. “Shades of blue with undertones of grays instead of black, that eventually lighten to whites and violet. It’s a commission for a widow I met at an art show.”
“No, I--” It would never not be Tony’s favorite thing to see Captain America blush. “I mean my fantasy is to-- to get someone pregnant.”
“You made gross amounts of money from playing pro ball, not from practicing your arts and crafts on stupid depressing paintings” the Alpha denied. “And by the way, the whole
“It’s fine, sweetheart.” Steve waited until Tony had wandered over towards the necklace display, then turned on his heel and marched right up to the manager’s desk. She didn’t even have the grace to look ashamed and
And after a moment of thought, Tony added, “And not to be rude, but working my regular job is guaranteed money so I can pay rent. This could be over tonight and then I’d be out the extra money with no way to make it up.”
“Pretty Omega.” Natasha was all fangs when she smiled up at Clint, teeth glinting and eyes sparking in interest when she saw him in the fitted pants and collared shirt. “Good to see you too.”
…he whined in surprise when Steve rolled him back over and placed a couple pillows beneath his hips. “Steve?”
“All I have in this world is my mind, my survival skill and my baby.” The Omega forced himself away from the worst of those thoughts and busied himself getting ready for the date again. “And I’m not about to let anyone take that away from me. But I’m also not going to miss making rent because I’m too much of a prude to try and have sex with the single hottest person I’ve ever met.”
an absolute doofus but he doesn’t deserve to be taken for a ride by some gold digger with pretty eyes.”

behind it. No one understood when an Omega didn’t want to be settled, it was a need central to an Omega’s core biology and if Tony said
The front door to his house closed and Steve hastily shoved his phone in his pocket, trying-- and failing-- to wipe the grin off his face before his guests walked through the door.
“Corn fed, rich, athletic and sensitive in all the artsy fartsy sort of ways. Love all those things for you.” Clint unhooked one of his hearing aids and stuck it into his pocket, turning his head so he could still hear Tony. “Scent markers?”
and he cut through his steak quickly, swiping the tender pieces through the potatoes and stabbing at the vegetables with his fork. “What inspired this one?”
“Could it hurt to ask?”  Bucky asked bluntly. “The worst he can say is no, and frankly I think I should meet the Omega that’s got my best pal all bent outta shape. Ask him.”
“Right here, stay right here.” even the few seconds it took to turn and get towels was agony and the Steve plastered himself to Tony against immediately, toweling through the Omega’s curls and down the slight curves of his body as Tony leaned trusting and pliant against him.
Tony hesitated, but the Alpha was all earnest blue eyes and an engaging smile as he crunched away at a French fry, so finally he admitted, “I feel like there’s
Tony would have been when Peter was born. The kid couldn’t have been more than three and Tony was only barely twenty one which meant Tony should’a been in high school and carrying on with his friends instead of tryna figure out how to be pregnant and alone in a cruel fucking world and that
, and Steve tore his gaze away from the shy toddler to meet Tony’s eyes. “Steve, this is my entire world, right here. The whole reason I even wake up in the morning. It’s
“Maybe it would feel more like you’re home if you were gettin’ shagged to death by Ye Olde Moneybags.” Clint snapped his fingers at the cook and pointed at his plate where he was missing friends for his order. “I mean, you’re sleeping down the hall from the guy. How hard would it be to just walk down there for a little midnight sneaky sneaky between the chee--”
.” the Alpha growled and Tony arched his back into the next thrust, sparks behind his eyes as his body lit up from the inside out and left him blurred. “My Omega,
often that the Omega got emotional enough to ask for help, to ask for his Alpha to be steady and Steve cherished those moments of dependence just like he cherished each and every time Tony allowed himself to be settled.
“Poor Omega.” Steve rumbled into his ear and Tony hiccuped and held him tighter. “Such a sad Omega, it’s okay. It’s okay. I’ve got you. I’m not gonna let anything else happen to you alright? Not a damn thing. You and Pete are mine to hold and mine to protect and we’re gonna be alright. Everything’s alright.”
At Costco, the Alpha pulled not one but two of the almost comically large shopping carts from the bay, plopped Pete in one then turned to inform Tony, “You’re ‘bout knee high to a grasshopper too, babe. You wanna ride in this high falootin’ contraption?”
“I need to go.” Tony shook his head and the Alpha’s smile dipped only a little bit uncertain before he nodded, “Alright, if you’re sure.”
Steve planted one foot up on the bed so he could take Tony harder, reached up and wove his fingers into Tony’s hair to pull his head back and arch that beautiful body into a gorgeous bow. “Jesus fuck that’s so gorgeous, you are fucking beautiful, Tony!”
“I won’t if you don’t want me too.” Steve started slowly. “But I love him, Tony. I love Pete. And if you don’t want him to call me Dad, that’s okay. Or if you don’t want to take my last name because of any future potential Stark inheritance or anything like that, that’s fine. But yes, if you let me, I’d like to adopt Pete.”
judgmental of Alphas since Alphas spend the better part of their day harassing us while we’re working.” Clint threw an arm around Tony’s shoulder and kissed his cheek. “It’s equality, babe. It’s what we deserve.”
“I love this on you.” Steve tilted Tony’s head to the side so he could see the way the curved set sat against his ear, tucking one of the Omega’s errant curls away gently. “But if you don’t like it, we’ll find something else.”
“I love you dearly.” Peggy kissed his cheek, then kissed his other one. “That one’s for our Bug. Give him hugs for me.”
that Tony was procrastinating buying more permanent items for Peter and putting off adding to the grocery list because the Omega really hadn’t been sure about staying, about the permanence of their situation or the stability of the abrupt life change that had landed them here in Brooklyn Heights.
“I love this.” Tony ran his hands gently over the messenger bag, peeking in all the compartments and imagining how it would so well for taking Peter along to the store-- space for a few diapers and wipes, some snackies for the baby and a water bottle and juice box. Steve didn’t know just how good of a gift a sturdy, dependable bag was for a single parent and the Omega clicked his tongue pleased over the design. “This is-- this might be my favorite thing. Thank you.”
“I vaguely insinuated that they’d end up stabbed with a gigantic fork if they didn’t get to steppin’.” Clint shrugged off Tony’s alarmed squeak. “Also
“It took a lot out of me.” Steve admitted. “I enlisted because I thought it was the right thing to do, I didn’t set out to be a super soldier or even a team leader, it just sort of happened. These guys made me a good Captain, but when it was over, I was done. I was done being a soldier and I hope I never have to join up again. I’d much rather paint all day and spend my nights…well, with
“Well...yeah.” Steve waited until the Omega met his eyes hesitantly. “Are you planning on being here?”
“Steve.” This time when they parted Tony was close to tears, fingers trembling as he touched his lips in confusion and awe. “What are you doing?”
“Natasha’s been holding him for the past fifteen minutes.” The Omega informed him, laughing softly when Bucky’s scent
“We didn’t have a date last night.” Tony waved off Clint’s confused expression. “Yeah, I know I said I was busy, but it was busy doing
“That seems very enthusiastic for a dish washing kiss.” The Omega giggled and wiped the suds off his nose. “What was that for?”
Bucky took advantage of the growing chaos in the kitchen and grabbed at Steve’s arm, yanking the big blond out into the living room so they could talk a moment before the game started. “Stevie, how you doing?”
“Steve.” Tony waited until Steve looked up to meet his gaze, then opened his knees a little further, arched his back a little higher and in his best faux innocent tone said, “I did some research on this, and I found out that if you put me on my hands and knees I have a better chance of conceiving.”
and redid into a knot at his navel, but then the tails were too long and fell over the front of his pants which seemed like a direct arrow
The place was tiny, no more than a few hundred square feet of living space altogether, smaller than Bucky’s master suite and only a bit bigger than his living room. The kitchen crammed into the corner had a two burner stove and an oven too small for even a full size cookie sheet, the microwave balanced precariously on the cracked counter would have been barely fit for a college dorm room, much less someone’s full time apartment. The fridge was short and squat but had at least a moderate amount of fresh groceries and the attached freezer was crammed with quick frozen meals, relieving a ball of

biting into Tony’s bonding spot. This was not  the moment to try and spark a bond-- that would come later-- so the Alpha bit Tony at the hinge of his jaw, at the curve where neck met collar bone, the lobe of his ear, the meat of his shoulder, scraped fangs over what he could reach of Tony’s chest, hefted the Omega higher and stroked deeper so he could bite at Tony’s lips and taste
“I think I’m tall enough to handle that.” Steve winked and started pulling out supplies for pancakes. “You wanna help, buddy? You can add the chocolate chips.”
“Oh? Have I really?” Clint grabbed the bottle of barbecue sauce Tony preferred and dumped it on one of the patties still sizzling on the flat top. “There, look, ruined. Damn shame. Sit down and eat, you’re starting to lose your ass and no one wants that to happen.”
“Oh I was so worried about you.” Peggy gasped through a few tears, then the elderly Alpha balled up a tiny fist and slugged Tony hard in the shoulder and shouted, “I was so
“A cup of tea.” Tony attempted a wobbly smile. “Peggy, two different times today, two different strangers looked at me and decided that I wasn’t worth their time or their common courtesy. I’m a single parent, an unbonded Omega and because I don’t have money and don’t have a mate somehow

“My favorite thing about you is how generous you are, even when you didn’t have much.” the Alpha crooned adoringly at his mate, and Tony flushed in pleasure. “I’ll see what I can do. Now if I remember right, didn’t you say something about having to buy a
“Well.” Tony tried to keep himself calm as he gathered Peter in tighter. “Thank you for letting us stay.”
“You need some extra cash?” Clint asked, and Tony countered, “You need every dollar just like I need every dollar, Clint.”
“Fine.” the other Alpha blew out a short breath. “But just so you know? I planned something violent and excellent tonight. You were going to bleed.”
“P-Plug.” Tony gestured weakly to his bag, and Steve grabbed clumsily at it, straining to reach without having to pull out. He was finishing coming but his cock was still throbbing, leaking just a little bit, splashing up Tony’s insides with each shudder. “P-plug me up. Please.”
Even with Natasha stealing away Peter and damn near refusing to give the baby back, with Bucky trying and failing at every turn to charm an increasingly stubborn-- and increasingly flattered,

“Again.” Tony tried hard not to smile quite so goofy. “I love every single word of that. And I don’t mean you have to ‘ask’ me for anything or whatever. I just uh…”
“Dunno about cotton mouthed.” Tony stirred enough to smack his lips a little before settling right back in against his boyfriends heartbeat and sighing in contentment. “Feel like you gave me enough to

Either way it was too late, because Tony hit send on a hastily typed out text then tossed his phone away to focus on rescuing an unfortunate amount of cheesy noodles from the floor as Peter clumsily dug at his plate.

It had been ten almost eleven days since Steve had even seen the gorgeous little brunette. Their last in person conversation had been about the painting Tony had inspired, the first time Steve had slipped up and called Tony

“Hey!” the Alpha automatically smiled, even though he looked confused when Tony came up and kissed him. “What’s going on? Did you forget something?”
Tony wasn’t prepared to be grabbed and yanked, to be flipped right over and pinned onto his stomach. “
“Yep.” Steve thought he’d strangle trying to draw a full breath as Tony pulled out the chair at the head of the table and motioned for him to sit. “Tony, you-- you look beautiful. Incredible.
“Pete! Did you play in bubbles?” Tony faux gasped, and Peter burst into another string of incoherent chatter. “Oh my goodness Bubba! That sounds so fun!”

that Steve was putting the brakes on because of a previously established curfew. Granted, it had been a long time since Tony had been with anyone, but he was fairly certain even the Alphas that were proud of their bedroom prowess could get it up and

“I like everything about this.” Steve dug into the crease at Tony’s hip before moving his hand and starting over again at Tony’s knee, this time lifting the skirt and slipping his fingers up the slick stockings, breath coming faster as Tony wriggled encouragingly on his lap, audibly

The Omega took one of the carts and started back at the beginning of the store, ready to wind his way through each and every aisle and put one of anything and everything he wanted in the basket, trying to distract himself from all the things Steve had said by indulging in the novelty of buying in
Tony snorted a laugh when he saw the sheer disaster, the absolute glee on Peter’s face and the mischief crackling in the toddlers eyes. “Oh my god.” he managed. “Oh my
“It’s the solution to your problems.” Clint tapped at the icon when it was obvious Tony wasn’t going to. “Fill out a profile and see if you get a match.”
“I don’t think getting tossed into bed by Steve and no doubt rogered to within an inch of my life counts as ‘just doing what I have to do’.” Tony flashed his little fangs in a smile and waggled his eyebrows. “Get it?
the Omega strong enough to be almost painful after what they’d shared. “I’ve missed you, Tony. Missed you, sweetheart.”
Tony’s mouth twisted uncertainly, Steve’s insistence that Bucky only had good intentions running through his mind.
“Big words.” Tony laughed quietly. “I think you just want me to dress up in a school girl skirt and knee high socks and call you
“Oh no, I wasn’t gonna comment on how you’re clearly only takin’ commissions that reflect your own sad little heart.” Bucky’s long hair fell forward into his eyes when he shook his head. “I was gonna say somethin’ shitty about how you got this big ass house and spend all your days up here in the attic like a gremlin-hobbit- scrooge.”
“I’m still sorry.” Steve turned his hand over and captured Tony’s, holding on to the slim fingers. “Is this okay?”
“Thank you.” The next unsteady inhale swamped Tony’s senses with too potent Alpha scent, heady, syrupy rosewood and bold cedar, and he stumbled a step when it swam
“Pass.” Clint turned on his heel abruptly and absconded right back to Peggy’s side with Peter held close, muttering. “Oversized mother fucker.” under his breath as he went.
“Well you’re in luck, cos you might be awkward but I actually love mushrooms so...” Tony waved one of his forks in the air and speared one of the mushrooms right off Steve’s plate. “Thank you in advance for all of these.”
“Don’t worry, darling.” Peggy blew Tony a kiss and tucked the little bit of money into her pocket. She wished and wished she could afford to watch Peter for no money at all, but the baby had to eat and Tony didn’t have very much food around so Peggy saved the dollars for snacks for Pete and the occasional walk to the park to get a popsicle on the warm days. “It’s plenty for me. Are you working tomorrow?”
“He knows there are things about my life I don’t share, but I’m sure he thinks those things are like…” Tony blew out a short breath. “...I don’t know. What do normal Omegas stress about? Grades at school? Partying? An outfit for my birthday? Steve has no idea about Peter and the longer we go on doing
The Omega paced back and forth in the tiny apartment, bouncing Peter gently and trying hard to keep his voice even so the toddler cry again. “Four years ago I could have walked into that jewelry store and they would have VIP’d me. Four years ago, I didn’t even know what Urgent Care
