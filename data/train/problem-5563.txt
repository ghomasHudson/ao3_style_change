“I’m sorry about that, I kind of joined recently like just yesterday. I don’t know what to say”, Bruce replied with a sympathetic smile. “What?! Then you got a scholarship too? What is your field of interest?”, he asked getting excited to find a fellow new comer.
Thor came back the next day, bringing good news as he told the rest of the Avengers about Loki’s location on midgard. The team suit up, ready for a fight. Tony also got into his suit and they took off on the quinjet.
“You sure have nerves picking on one of the host club members”, Bucky said, leaning on the gym wall.
“Fooling around”, he bluntly replied making the blonde a bit dejected,” Besides aren’t you my senior?”
“No, we’re not. He just happens to save me when I fell down trying to get in here. He just likes to tease me about that, the annoying bastard”, he denied.
“So seeing me made you have a sudden interest in the grass, huh?”, Steve asked amused making Tony glare at him.
“May I have a word, Steve”, a stoic looking girl asked as she sipped her tea. “I heard that the host club has taken in a kitten with no pedigree”, she continued with a fade smirk.
“Please ignore them, Tony. You’re an amazing kid. Don’t worry about these guys, okay?”, Steve told him with such a kind and understanding smile that made his heartbeat sped up. Geez, Steve is a guy! Stop getting flustered. He thought, shaking his head.
“What’s this? You’re already so wet with just my fingers. What a lewd body”. Steve said to him as the hacker panted loudly under him biting on his hands as he tried to suppress his moans.
It was a pure relief when the loud roar of the Hulk woke up Tony who opened his eyes and looked up at them in shock.
The game got more serious as it went but Rhodey also managed to score one. Tying up the scores. Their opponents were now trying really hard to not make them level up their points. There was barely 5 minutes left in the match.
Tony felt himself blush, “I…I’m Tony. I got a scholarship to study here recently. So, um, yeah, thought I’d drop by?”, he squeaked out.
“What are you talking about, mortal? I cast no such spell on your Ironman”, was Loki’s off handed reply. Steve felt like ripping his head off.
When the goal went in again Tony cheered enthusiastically, jumping around in pure joy. Rhodey had gone over to his seat as Tony jumped over the border to hug the guy and slapping on his back in a proud manner.
Letting out a small sigh he got up from his seat. He did promised Tony he’d make him fall for him again. Better start now. He went over to his former lover’s table and sat down at one of the empty seat.
Tony nodded in understanding. So even he has someone he was serious about before. If it was just another one of his flings I’m sure he won’t react like that.
With that Steve’s face lit up in pleasure and went off, really leaving Tony this time. Tony knocked on the vice principal’s door and got permission to enter. “Hello, I’m To-“
“It’s fine, Bucky. I’ll sort it out with the principal”, Steve told his friend in a calm voice making Bucky arch his eyebrows at the statement. “I’ll even pay it if that’s needed”. Bucky’s eyes widened at that. Steve would really go as far as paying it off himself?... If Steve was okay with that I guess they’ll do that then.
“God, Steve, I love you too but I think that’s enough ‘I love you’ for today”, Tony told him putting a hand on Steve’s face with an amused smile. Steve simply brought their lips together again.
“No…!Not…yet..!Don’t!”. Steve did not stop though, he kept on hitting his pleasure spot time and again making Tony cry out both in ecstasy and pain.
He quickly got up to a sitting position on his bed as he grabbed his phone. Looking down he realized it was a message from Tony. That was fast. He opened and read it:
“Don’t listen to him, Tony. I’m sure you will survive the rest of high school even if we are not there to help you. Maybe this is a good time for you to make new friends”, Pepper told him putting a hand on his shoulder.
“Rogers!”, Tony called out for the blonde who was walking ahead of him with the rest of the gang. But he didn’t seem to hear him.
“How could we not, Tony? You practically give off the aura of pure joy right from first period”, Pepper stated.
“Yeah”, he replied, “This one’s Clint. He almost landed on top of me”, pointing to him, “This one’s Natasha. She had a knife on my throat. That one is Thor. He tried to throw me into the pool. And lastly Barnes. He gives off the feeling of wanting to bite my head off and I kinda dropped my lunch on him. So yeah, hard to forget them with those kinds of first encounters”
He felt like it was going to be a while. But then. “Seriously, Rogers. Don’t answer with your lower region” he retorted to which Steve said “Isn’t this your fault?”.
“He doesn’t need your type of advice, Barton”, Natasha added ending with Clint yelling at her about how mean she was.
Tony did as he was told and stepped out of his Ironman armor to stand infront of Loki. Loki’s hands lit up a yellow glow and hovered it over the brunette’s forehead. After a minute he put his hands down, looking a bit worried.
Tony packed up his now semi wet bag and put on his shoes. “Alright, good night then”, he said heading towards the gate. Steve grabbed on his arm, stopping him. Turning back to look at Steve, Tony tilted his head in confusion.
Steve nodded and did as he was told. One of the workers at the shop, thinking he was trying to run away without paying for it ran after him as fast as he could, worried and horrified . The look on the worker’s face was priceless when Steve simply ran back again into the shop.
“I see you had the privilege of taking the Odinson tour”, Steve said looking at the state of the two newbies, Tony with the leftover yellow pollens on his uniform and Bruce covered in a towel, water dripping down from his hair. “He likes showing the new applicants around and letting them try out things. Don’t mind him, he’s a really good guy. Just wanted to make you feel more comfortable here. I’ll let the teachers know about it”
Thor took them to see the school’s football stadium. Yes, they have a private stadium and making them play a two-against-one match where Thor came out victorious.
“I’m afraid Ironman has been hit with a powerful magic. Magic which steals his memories of the past 5 years. When did this happen?”, Strange asked, concern acing his voice.
Peggy had caught her boyfriend being all cozy with one of the football cheerleaders recently so they were having a fight.
Tony stares back with half lidded eyes. Lips parting slightly as Steve continued to stretch him open.
“Tony!”, Steve shouted as he watched Tony being blasted across the building with Loki’s magic staff that had been deflected by Thor’s hammer. Ironman made no movement, no sound. He just laid there on the concrete floor motionless. A part of his face shown through the cracks of his faceplate. The captain throws his shield at Loki who had taken their distraction as a chance to escape with his beast, making him missed his target. The fight brought to an end.
Tony’s face went red at the comment. “He…! He does not like me. Besides I don’t swing that way!”, he sluttered out, embarrassed.
I have no idea what will happen. I always feel somewhat hopeful at the beginning of each week. But I end up not feeling anything for the other person and we just split up and I repeat this again and again.
“No, but…”, he was about to reply when the classroom started to fill with murmurs and squeals. It was Steve Rogers smiling at him from the doorway.
Steve turned to the two friends and stifles a laugh on seeing one of them crouch down behind the other in an awful attempt of hiding themselves. Please don’t say anything. Just go away. Tony pleaded in his thought, his hands covering his face. “Tony, is that you? What are you doing down there?”, he heard Steve call him out. Why couldn’t he just ignore me for today? He grumpily thought as he stood up, putting on a grin.
Class was finally over for the day. “Tones, wanna drop by McDonalds on the way home? Coach said third years could get the day off”, Rhodey suggested as packed up their belongings.
“What’s with you?”, saying that Tony grabbed his arm and haul him through the crowd and into a popular Shawarma place Rhodey had told him about.
“I’m glad there’s someone here who knows how awesome I am. On a totally different topic, what did you meant by Barnes being not a bad guy?”
Vrooom, a vehicle went passed him in a flash. Thinking it was the pizza guy Tony glanced at the road only to find that it was a red Porsche car.
But when the time came for his confession he had looked forward to for the whole week ended with him finding out things that broke his heart.
“Tony?....Tony, what’s wrong? Talk to me please”, Steve pleaded, putting his hands on Tony’s shoulder to comfort him. What’s happening to Tony now? He was at a lost on what to do.
“If Bucky saw us like this he’ll definitely get the wrong idea”, he told her when she attempted to sit on his lap. He quickly held up the sketch book he was drawing on to avoid scrunching it up.
“He doesn’t even come to practice often. He only comes here once in a while and he just gets into the game”, the other said in a disgusted and annoyed tone.
“….Was that your girlfriend for the week?”, Tony asked cause he was curious. And adding that she looks older than 20. Steve, not getting at it the first time stared at his senior looking lost, not getting it.
Steve sigh then got up and opened the door, sketch book in hand, “Don’t say things you don’t really mean”, he says and walked out of his apartment leaving her alone.
“This is all your fault you dirty commoner!!”, saying that Wanda ran away, tears in her eyes followed by her brother Pietro.
Steve felt that Stark was not honest with himself. Why did he come here? Was it really just on a whim?
Tony put his palm under his chin, shifting his gaze away from Pepper, “Yeah, yeah. I get it”, he replied, not really caring. Crap this is such a bother.
“St-stop!...STOP..!I SAID TO STOP SO HURRY UP AND TAKE IT OUT!”, Tony shouted at him making him froze his action. The hell. Is he seriously backing away after they’ve gotten this far?
After a good hour of fending off and attacking it the beast started to weaken from the combined attack of the team, then Hulk smashed it into the ground. The team had just put down the monster Loki had summoned and were now fully concentrated on the magician when …….
“Oh…”, Tony breathe out, he looked over at Bucky and pointed at him,” Even him?”, asking in a disbelieving voice. An angry vein popped up in Bucky’s head while Steve just let out an amused laugh. “You got a problem with me, punk?”
He was ecstatic to see Tony. Now that his lover was okay he could take him back home. Everything would be like it was again. But everything was not gonna be like it was. When he saw Tony he looked as if he didn’t even know him. He looked so confused and scared. What was wrong?
Everyone had already gone home. There were no lights nearby. Tony’s feet started to feel numb standing in the cold water for so long.
Something was seriously wrong with Tony. It’s like his memories is being wiped out little by little. It worsens as the days went by. Tony would suddenly run out in horror when he finds Steve in the bed with him. Steve would comfort him and calmly explain to him and Tony would remember again after that. It used to happen once a week before but now it seems to occur every morning these days.
“I thought you already went home”, Tony started, when only the sound of rippling water was getting to him.
“Speak of the devil, here he comes”, Barnes said as he eyed at their new errand boy, Tony Stark, who grumpily walked over to them , hands occupied with shopping bags.
Recognizing the voice Tony turned around, squinting his eyes at Steve in annoyance. It doesn’t matter if the guy’s hot, he really gets on his nerves sometimes.
“One word. Rogers”, he mumbled into his arms. Bruce pondered no further about the subject. On a totally different subject, he does want to ask about Tony’s way of dressing. Tony had put on a jumper underneath his coat and didn’t tuck in his shirt as well.
Amongst all the celebration Tony gazed over at Steve and gave him a triumph victory sign, a huge grin plastered on his lips. Steve couldn’t help but do the same. The brunette looked like he was really proud of him.
Steve’s eyes widened in pure surprised at the question. Left him dumfounded. He was about to give a reply when the pizza delivery guy pulled up near the school.
Taking a deep breath Steve mustered up his courage and swung his feet into the air sending the ball flying with it, STRAIGHT TO THE GOAL!
“Tony, are you alright? She didn’t hurt you right?”, Steve asked getting down on one knee to check for any injuries.
“Have fun kid”, the girl quickly ran down the hallway. Hmm, that must be Natasha then. Now he understood why Clint would be hiding from her. She really is scary as fuck.
“You never listen to advice when it’s given to you”, she said with a sigh, “Keep this up and your girlfriend is going to fall out of love with you pretty soon. Maybe even today”, she continued with a small playful smirk.
“Not at all, Barnes. Just speaking out my mind”, the genius said with a mischievous grin. Bucky tried to get up from his desk trying to punch Tony but Steve pulled him back down
These girls, most of them are pampered and sheltered girls who knows nothing about the real world. In comparison with the other co-ed school, these girls sure have unusual impressions regarding guys.
“See you’re enjoying this, Rogers”, Tony says with a sly smile as he rubbed against him a little harder, earning a deep groan from the taller blond. “I came all the way here. So, before my mood changes. Let’s - ”.
He went over to Steve’s place and turned his door knob only to find that the guy hadn’t even locked his door. He went inside looking around for a familiar blond hair. But there was no sign of it. The guy was probably asleep then.
Things went back to like they were. With Tony busying himself in work and Avengers’ business. They went on dates and had a lot of heated sex. Life was good. Everything was going well. Until it wasn’t.
“You have a talent for football. It’s such a waste if you keep skipping it”, he scolded him, crossing his arms in front.
Saying bye to his mom he head off for another day of being a host again. He had folded the coat and put it in his bag running to the station.
“Let’s go on a date, Steve”, he said with a slight grin, gazing up at the taller blonde as clear brown eyes looked straight at baby blue ones. Steve’s heart leaped in his chest. Ba-dump.
“Now that you mentioned it he was really good when he played that practice match. I couldn’t keep my eyes off him that time. I totally forgot he was even part of the school football club. Since I rarely saw him even when I came to see your practice with Pepper. You two close?”
“Stupid Steve. I bet he noticed I was still wearing his coat. Why couldn’t he just tell me? God…this is so embarrassing”, he said to himself.
Tony stood silently in his place. He couldn’t believe his memories were slowly being taken away from him. He doesn’t want to forget. Forget being Ironman; forget about the Avengers and….forget about Steve again…He doesn’t want Steve to suffer because of him. He loves him. Wanted to make him happy, not sad. Ever.
Not giving a reply Steve simply took off his shoes and socks as well. Rolled up the pants and got into the fountain with him. Feeling around the water he asked what they were searching for. Tony had stared at the guy, trying to fend him off but he seemed determined. With a soft voice he replied that it was a black wallet. Steve was such a good guy it kind of pisses him off but he can’t help liking him all the same. Totally as a friend though.
“Rogers, you should lock up even if you have nothing worth stealing”, he said as he peaked inside the bedroom.
Tony stared at her not knowing what she meant. Then it hit him. He quickly took off Steve’s blazer and explained to his mom that a friend had lent it and that he forgot to give it back. Ignoring the rest of her questions Tony ran to his room.
“Shut up, Rogers. That was one time, one time”, he replied annoyed, folded his arm and faced away in an attempt to ignore and make him leave.
He then saw the red haired girl, Natasha sitting on a chair near a bar, tending to her knife. Thor and Clint were playing a game, hitting away at the controls and one guy sleeping on the couch, his face covered by a pillow. This room seems like it’s filled with all the people he didn’t want to meet.
When Tony told his mother about his invitation she was so happy for him that she even cried. Hugging him and how proud she was to have such an amazing son. He wanted to do this for her too. Wanted to achieve great things, excel in his studies and get a good job. He wanted to support her back. She was always working to the bones for him every day. Not really having enough time to give proper care for her son, often getting drunk as well but his mom was all he had. He loved her anyway.
He remembered Stark telling him last night, “I knew it was impossible to train a wild animal”, as he glanced up from the pillow he was clutching, Steve’s dick buried deep inside him as sweat adorned his body. But he felt like that Stark himself was also a stray animal himself. Always skipping around from place to place.
“Just one more room. This place is huge, Bruce. I’m sure that they’ll be atleast one empty room we can call our own”, Tony insisted and Bruce gave a nod.
“I’m glad Anthony is alright. Steven had us worried”, Thor said, smiling with Bruce doing the same. Tony took in his surrounding. All the members of the Avengers Host club had come to his rescue.
The morning light starts to lit up his room as Steve rubbed his eyes and felt around the side next to him. It was empty. Stark wasn’t there anymore. Did he go home already?
“You say that but this part of you is more honest, isn’t it?”, he told him as he pushed his leg up against Steve’s groin and rubbing against his already hard erection. “Bas…tard..!”, Steve managed to say through clenched teeth, trying to suppress a moan.
Pepper’s eyes widened in surprised. She really didn’t think it would be that fast. “….When?”,she asked, her gaze a bit sad.
“Don’t be so confident, I might not fall for you a second time, Rogers”, he stated with a playful smile, tears still flowing out with else. Wiping his tears away, Steve asked what Tony wanted to do. Tony’s lips curved into a smile, gazing up at his super soldier making Steve’s heart beat loudly in his chest. God, he really loved those brown eyes. He never gets tired of gazing into them. Tony finally told him that he wanted to this.
Steve sat across Tony’s table, eyeing him from the corner of his sunglasses. Tony sitting on his usual seat with the sunlight shining down on his features. Damn, he was beautiful. He watched as the waiter brought Tony’s order at the table. The billionaire said his thank you with a smile and Steve was already feeling jealous of the waiter.
Steve’s car was a Mercedes Benz E- class. The inside was great. The seats were very comfortable. The inside of the car was warmer but Tony felt a shiver. He wished that he was home soon; take a warm bath and sleep. Steve noticed the subtle chattering of teeth so he took off his blazer and put it around the smaller boy’s shoulder.
“I am not certain, my friend but I will go back to Asgard and get help from Heimdall. He would know”, was the god’s reply.
“I’m not and I’m not leaving you, ever, okay?”, he assured him wiping away the tears. “Now come over here and give me a kiss, ya big crybaby”, Tony teased making grabby hands at Steve who happily obliged.
Steve was busy gazing at Tony as he continued to chat and entertain the girls. He snapped out it when the girl besides him coughed to get his attention. “Did you forget about me?”, she asked.
“Great, I have a letter for a Mr. Tony Stark. Here you go”, he said handing him a well-sealed letter with a fancy looking stamp seal, giving another small smile he went back to the delivery truck. Tony opened the letter and let out a small gasp as he read it. It says,
Tony shouted in annoyance, he just wants to fucking leave the damn room. Can’t this people understand a simple ‘no’. The commotion they created got the attention of a certain blonde who was working on his laptop. He went out to find two guys being dragged by Clint against their will, while the latter simply let out a laugh in pure joy seeing their reaction.
“Do you know how much we make from one customer? You’d be able to pay off your debt if you could get 50 customers”, Clint piped in.
“Girls should get it in their head that perfect guys like from the TV dramas and books don’t exist. Ever”, saying that he let out a frustrated sigh.
Noticing the loosely held cup with its content almost spilling on the smaller boy’s hand Steve pried it off from his hold and put it down on the nearby cup holder. He then gazed at the figure sleeping calmly on his shoulder. Tony had a peaceful expression.
“What did you expect, Mr. Athlete? We’re nerds. Our field of expertise is not sports”, Tony said catching up his breath, wiping the sweat off his brows.
Looking at Tony’s motionless body lying on the hospital bed, wrapped up and stitches all over his body made Steve want to just curl Tony into a hug. Never letting him get hurt and shield him from everything that could hurt his Tony.
Running over to the blonde he took out some money from his wallet and handed it to him. “Thanks for the help earlier”
It had been the happiest day of his life when he confessed to Tony who had burst out in tears, tackling him into a hug and told him that he also loved him. Sealing their love with a kiss so sweet that had made Steve craving for more. Tony’s kisses were addictive. He couldn’t get enough of it.
Damn, I got treated to lunch by a junior. Well, this is the first time I’ve had a proper conversation with Steve. And surprisingly he’s an even stranger person than I thought. All of a sudden he wants to walk home together and asking for my number.
“Rogers? What are you doing here?... Oh my god, you’re one of them aren’t you?”, Tony said, eyes wide in shock, gaping at Steve.
Steve and Tony waited at the bus stop together. It was already quite late into the day. It had taken a while for the football club and its members to clear up the field. But Tony patiently waited for Steve as the blonde had texted him that he’d like to go home together with him.
Why? Why can’t I be more determined about this? He thought, clenching his fist slightly which Tony noticed.
Tears ran down Tony’s cheeks. This can’t be real. Why did the spell have to wipe away the past 5 year’s memories? Why couldn’t it have been his childhood memories? Or his teenage years in MIT? He definitely won’t mind forgetting those. Why did the fucking spell have to take away the memories of his recent time as ironman, as part of the Avengers, being their friend and the most of all, his memories of Steve?
“Stop joking around, Peggy. You’re drunk. You’re not in the right mi-..”, he was cut off with her pressing her red plum lips to his. He quickly shoves her off him.
“You don’t like it when people just went along with you?”, Steve asked, looking at his untouched plate.
“Why are you so proud of that? He dumped you”, Tony stated narrowing his eyes at her. But she simply replied that it felt like she had hit the jackpot when it happened.
“Nonsense”, saying that Tony reached out to put some of his food on Bruce’s plate. Bruce ran away, blocking his plate from Tony. The boy ran after him, laughing but soon food himself tripping on a leg and dropping his plate. The room was soon filled up with snickers and mocking laughs. Tony realized one of them had intentionally tripped him up. He got up, determined to give them a piece of his mind but then saw his lunch splattered on the floor and to his horrid realization on someone as well. Not just someone but a very angry looking classmate Tony had nicknamed as Metal hand. It was James Buchanan Barnes.
“Yesterday”, the boy simply replied scribbling random formulas in his notebook. He expected Pepper to continue the conversation but she didn’t. There was only silence. He turned to her to see that she just gave him a look, a concerned one.
But as the brunette continued his silent stare he let out a small sigh and says, “I guess I’m a bit troubled”
Steve always causes a stir with that good looking face of his. He thought as he looked at the guy leaning on the walls of the front gate.
“Tell me, tell me, tell me”, Clint repeated again and again, shaking Tony who had his lips shut tight. “Tony just gave me back the blazer I lent”, Steve cut in hoping to stop Clint.
“You read my mind, Rhodey bear”, Tony replied, smiling brightly until, “Wait…I feel like I’m forgetting something…”
Steve quickly ran over to Tony’s side. The rest of the avengers present by his side, all looking worried for their teammate. He crouched down, removing the faceplate. Tony wasn’t breathing. Steve suddenly couldn’t breathe either. Tony can’t be dead. He can’t.
Somehow….everything seems to be progressing too quickly. He thought as he walked back to home, wind blowing gently along the way.
At first it was just things like not remembering watching a movie he had loved, an event he was booked with a month ago, which Pepper had told him. Or the date sites he had already been on.
Tony stared at the guy for a good minute then gave a reluctant okay. He was really cold now that it was mentioned. Steve beamed, taking Tony’s hand and leading him to where his car was parked. Tony blushed at the contact. Unlike his cold hands Steve’s was warm, really warm. He feels like he could hold his hand like this forever.
Twirling a pen in his hand he looked down to see two girls who were waving at him. He looked around to check whether or not the teacher was busy. On finding out he was occupied with reading out boring words from the text Tony waved back at them with a smile, earning a happy squeal from the girls.
“He better not try anything though”, he thought to himself as he felt Stark burying his face in the curve of his neck. He was acting just like a cat. Steve was tired after a long day of work. He needed his sleep. Therefore, he’d like to avoid a fight to the dead with Tony Stark for tonight at least.
Tony glared at him. “I’m waiting for pizza. Just so you know we’re having self study right now so I can do whatever I want”
Somehow, it feels like someone has said that to me before. Although it was in a completely different situation from today’s. I’ve never really had an interest in Steve Rogers but right now I find myself wondering what kind of person he is.
I always thought he looked the most beautiful when he’s concentrating on his work but he’s so much more beautiful when he’s smiling and laughing like this.
“You’re exaggerating, Clint. Sorry about him. He gets too hyper. What are you two doing here?”, Steve said brushing him off.
Steve flopped back onto his back on the bed, sighing as he put an arm over his eyes to hide the light coming from his bedroom window.
“Steve? What’s with the look? Did something happened?”, Tony asked, concerned on the state of his lover. Hearing that Steve crashed their lips together in a heated kiss then brought him into a tight embrace with Steve telling him how much he loved him over and over again.
“I see. I’ve already taken care of most of the task but it would be great if I could leave the rest to you”, Steve replied.
A vein pop up on Tony’s head, “You don’t need to tell me that. I can tell just by looking”, he grumbled. Realizing something he suddenly stood up surprising his friends.
“What kind of person is it this time?”, she asked. Steve could hear her smiling on the other side of the call.
“But this is just Regal Shopping Street..”, Steve said but Tony had long walked away into the crowded street. Eh?
The team decided to get him checked up but they couldn’t find any reasons for it. Nothing was wrong with his brain. It was functioning properly. Steve was at a loss on what to do next. Doctors couldn’t find anything wrong with his lover but he keeps getting worse.
“Yeah, I do. Please make one for me everyday from now on”, the blonde replied making Tony blush who nodded shyly in his place.
“I was single yesterday, so it was okay but now I’m not anymore. I’m not going to meet with you”, he replied with a small sigh.
“Thank you for your patronage~!”, the delivery guy said as he rode away with a gloomy looking Tony in the background.
“The righteous captain is getting angsty”, the dark haired prince said with a smirk. “Alright, fine. I don’t feel like fighting today. Stark, come over here. Out of the armor would be preferable”
“Who, me? Not at all. I was examining your campus grass. I think you need to take better care of them. They seem to be drying up”
”So this is instant coffee. It looks tasty. Let’s all have some”, Steve said taking a cup. The others looked hesitant though.
“What is it? You don’t have to go to the Engineering club anymore right? You said you already finished the assigned projects for the rest of the year and more”
“I’m disappointed in you, Miss Maximoff. And the reason Tony had to look for his stuffs in the water late into the night was because you threw it there”
“I will”, came Steve’s unwavering answer, looking straight at him. Tony’s eyes closed and his body fell forward. Steve caught him halfway and carried his unconscious lover out the room.
“I’m sure you will but before that go change into your uniform”, Coulson said typing away in his laptop.
“But hurry. If this keeps up Ironman will soon lose all his memories and even feelings he had acquired during the time”, Strange added.
What he heard made Steve froze in his place. Past five years memories? Shaking his head Steve spoke up remembering the incident with Loki. “I think it might be a month ago when Loki came to attack earth with his beast. Tony got hit with a blast from him. But when we checked he didn’t have any injuries from that so we thought the suit protected him”
Steve eyed at him for a few seconds then took a bite of Shawarma. Tony had already finished his plate and was asking for seconds. He ate his next servings with the same delight. The two of them ate in silence. Until Steve broke it.
“YESSS! You’re the man, Rhodey bear”, Tony’s face lit up in pure joy. Pulling out the take out menu of a nearby pizza store the three friends sat down to decide which to order, having an argument about which topping was the best.
“It isn’t like that but I like your face. I guess that’s what you mean by ‘type’ ”, Steve replied with a sweet smile.
Pepper bent down to meet his eyes, poking her pen on his cheeks. “It’s because you do unrefined things like yawning out loud with a good looking face like yours that all the girls you’re with always dump you in a flash, you know”, she told him with a serious face.
Was he always the type of person who’d go out of his way to make friends with others? The brunette pondered as he and Steve exchanged phone numbers and e-mail address.
The blonde rubs the back of his head in a flustered manner,“I’m so sorry about that. I just wanted to say welcome to SHIELD. I hope you have a good time here, Tony”
He went to take his seat with the rest of the crowd who had stayed back to support their team. The players came out and greeted their opponents. The whistle blew and the game was on.
On the first half Steve wasn’t able to make any goal as most of his teammates didn’t want to pass him the ball. On the other hand their opposing team scored twice. It was rough. Skipping practice wasn’t such a good thing right now when he’s drenched in sweat and losing.
“I had a really rough childhood but mom and I have managed to somehow make it through just fine”, he added with an innocent smile.
“You seem like someone who’s easy to talk to. I have lots of questions to ask you later”, he said giving him a friendly smile.
“Wait, are you the Tony Stark who recently won the best engineering award in the field of Robotics 2018?”, he asked clearly amazed.
“I’m so sorry, Steve. God, I’m sorry. But it’s alright now. Everything’s fine now, okay? You know I hate to see you like this”, he said cupping his face.
Tony went up to their apartment and knocked on the door. He was greeted was a worried looking Maria Stark who hugged him on the spot. “I came back before my next shift to prepare dinner for you but you weren’t here.  I tried calling but it didn’t connect and since I don’t know anyone from your new school I had no one to ask …I was so worried. What happened?”
After walking around he soon found his locker located at a corner with a Steve Rogers written on the locker beside him which he recognized as the blonde who helped him. Guess they were locker mates. Quickly opening his locker he suit up for class, taking out the school issued bag and some text books and a notebook, shoving his own bag inside the locker. He was on his way to his class when someone suddenly corners him to the wall. He squinted his eyes from the pain and soon found himself face to face with an angry red head with her knife pressed to his throat.
“So what brother told me about common people not having the time to even ground their own coffee was true”, Thor added.
“Oh ho, now we won’t want that to happen would we. Fine, for you Stark I’ll make an exception. You better bring good results though”, saying that Fury sent him out. Tony had a smug look on when he returned to class without any punishment.
“Tony? What are you doing here?”, a voice Tony recognized spoke from behind. Tony hung his head. Of all people why was it him who got to see him like this?
“Clint, I can’t work with you making so much noise and….. what are you doing to them?”, Steve said, letting out a sigh. “If they aren’t interested just leave them be”, he continued as he reached down to lend a hand. He was surprised to see that it was none other than Tony.
Pouring hot water in the last cup and stirring the mix he brought it over in a tray, set it on a table and stood to the side. He felt pretty confident. Making coffee was a special skill of his. Who won’t be when one makes it atleast 5 times everyday? He eagerly watched them, wanting to see their reactions when a voice interrupted.
The brunette got out of the car and took out his bag as well. “Thanks a lot for you know…helping me and dropping me off. You shouldn’t have”
Tony sat in front of the school gate waiting for the pizza guy gazing up at the wide blue sky. His thoughts went back to Rhodey’s words.
“So what should I do? I’m taking my fingers out. Hey, what now? Should I stop?”. He makes a scissor like movement inside him, earning a rough throaty moan. Tony whimpered as he brought his arms to cover his tear stained eyes. Mumbling something.
The couple went home with Happy dropping them off at the Tower. They were soon greeted by their team who seemed equally happy to get back their resident genius and friend. After spending a few hours watching movies with the team the couple went up to their shared room.
“Hmm, Rogers is so warm”, he said to himself as he hugged Steve from behind, nuzzling his head into the fluff of blond hair. Tony felt that Rogers’ hair was quite fluffy to touch. He wondered if this was what a beast’s fur felt like since Rogers really was a kind of beast.
“So, Steve, why were you crying you eyes out at the hospital anyway? You thought I was dying or something?”, Tony asked as he laid on the bed with Steve following him, doing the same.
Boarding the bus Tony tried not to think about the impending horrible events that awaits him at SHIELD. He just has to suck it up, avoid the annoying characters except Bruce and maybe Steve and he’ll be fine. Getting to gate he took out his card and slides it along the panel like a pro.
Karma seems to follow him everywhere. What was a banana peel lying around anyway? He heard someone trying to stifle a laugh and immediately knew that Clint was responsible for that.
“It’s pretty nice, huh? The food here is really good”,Bruce told him as they head over to the buffet table. “I bet. It would surely be alleast a 5 star one if it were a restaurant”, he agreed stuffing his plates with the delicious treats. After filling his plate to the brim he and Bruce went to sit on one of the empty tables. They ate in silence for the first five minutes after which Tony could no longer keep his curiosity under control and started to interrogate poor Bruce .
It wasn’t even after 5 minutes into sleep that his phone rang again. He wondered what Peggy wanted this early in the morning.
I don’t know anything about him. And from the stoicism he possesses when he’s working on a machine, I would never have thought that he could be so interesting and mercurial.
Tony got off from the bus and walked in the direction of his new school, feeling a bit nervous. He soon found himself in front of a huge gate. He tried to open it but found it locked tight. He looked around, not knowing what to do. “Why isn’t there anyone to greet me anyway?”, he said to himself gazing up the sky as if a solution would just drop down. He waited for a good 15 minutes after which he started climbing the gate. If no one is coming to get him he’ll just get there himself. He doesn’t need a damn escort. He was about halfway there when a voice called out from below.
“It was Steve’s idea”, Bucky started as Tony let out a surprised choke. Steve didn’t seem like the type to do that. You really can’t judge a book by its cover after all. “Listen to the whole thing first, idiot. Steve…he wanted to make a group to give out help to people who needed it. But then Clint said he wanted to get girls as well so suggested we start a host club instead. Saying that it would bring smiles to the students here”
Why was the universe so cruel? Why those memories? Maybe it’s to punish him. Punishment for all the things he’d done wrong. The result of being The Merchant of Death. Fate had come back to bite him in the face. I guess I deserve it though. He admitted bitterly burying his eyes in his palms.
After a while the bus came. The two students stepped up and went into the bus, paying for their ride. Taking a seat Tony let out a tired sigh. “I’m so sleepy and hungry”
“Get use to that, Stark. Steve is the club’s mother hen and you’ll be getting a lot of that from now on”, Natasha teased in a calm tone.
It was luck that Tony’s friend, Dr. Stephen Strange also known as the Sorcerer Supreme, a fellow hero had dropped by the tower for a visit. Steve had asked the magician if he could help Tony, telling him about Tony’s strange condition, after which Dr. Strange used his magic on Ironman, agreeing to help. The result shook them to the core.
“We were just leaving”, saying that Tony went for the door but stepped on a banana peel lying at the last step, losing his balance. Tony fell backwards and accidentally knocked down a vase, an expensive vase.
“Tony, are you hungry? Do you want some food?”, Maria asked opening Tony’s room but on seeing her son already deep in slumber she quietly closed the door and got ready for her next shift.
“Oh, I..um, I like biochemistry and nuclear physics. I’m currently fascinated with nuclear physics at the moment. What about you?”
He took his position in front of the goal, letting out a breath of air to calm himself. It had been a while doing this so he was kind of nervous.
“I’m afraid that won’t be happening, Miss Maximoff”, Steve said coming out to stand in between Tony and Wanda.
Steve gave him a look and dropped the topic. The rest of the ride went on in silence. Tony didn’t even feel like breaking it. He feels better in the quietness of the car and the sound of its humming engines. They soon reached Tony’s place.
“Have you seen a stupid looking guy coming down this hallway?”, she asked, a cool icy tone to her voice.
“That’s right. Mom was always busy with her work from morning till night so I also had to learn how to make food and clean up. She taught me in her free time. I’m not good at making food yet but it makes me really happy when I get it right sometimes and see the smile on her face when she eats it”, he said with a sad tone and had all the undying attention of the girls.
Tony went to the destination the note had said and was surprised to find the girl he remembered being quite rude to him before. “Why did you call me?”, he questioned.
He took a sniff but found that it wasn’t really smelly. So this wasn’t it? Then where’s the smell coming from?
If Peggy was drinking that means she hasn’t made up with Bucky yet. She’s always like this. Geez, these two. It’s almost a week now.
A painful throb hit Tony, like an arrow being shot right through his head. What the fuck is this? It hurts as hell. He clutched his head tightly in an attempt to sooth the pain. But it wasn’t going away. Clenching his hands on both side of his head he let out a whimper of pain, earning Steve’s attention.
“That’s not very nice, Tony; and the special classes of SHIELD are called special class for a reason. The ones in here are students gifted in certain fields. Age and sex doesn’t matter here”
“Of course I will. Thank you, my lady”, the blonde replied with a smile, leaving her swooning at him, telling him how dreamy he was.
He went down, took off his shoes and socks. Rolling up his pants he got into the fountain picking up his stuffs. He had found almost all his things except for his wallet. It was getting real late and the sky losing its light making it hard to continue the search. He had to hurry, if he didn’t find it home was a long way to walk on foot and he was tired.
“No, I’ll pay. It will take a while, no, it will take years but I’ll give the compensation myself. You don’t have to do that, Steve. I seriously appreciate your kindness but I have my own pride”, Tony said getting up infront of Steve with a determined look.
“Oh it’s pretty cool I guess, excluding the seriously unnecessary rule of having to wear uniforms. God I really hate the idea of wearing the same clothes for a whole week everyday of the month as if we’re in an army”
“If you think you can do a better job than me why don’t you become a host? Let’s see you taking on some customers”, Bucky challenged.
Once they reach the cafeteria they lined up near the buffet table. Tony stack up his plate to the brim with food, planning to eat away his worries. “I feel a bit sick looking at your plate”
“Wow, so quick. You really have no patience, do you?”. Tony smirked at him. “I might have serviced you if you had pretended to fall asleep a little while longer”.
“And then there’s that face of yours you have whenever you finish a project or solve a difficult problem, which makes you seem like the prince which these naïve girls have been fantasizing. Well, it’s not hard to understand why they would”, she explained.
“Those girls don’t like me as a person”, Tony said as he let out a loud long sleepy yawn after all those all- nighters he had been doing on his machines.
“So, you’re Tony from the special class like Steve and the others?”, one of the three girls who had her long black hair in pig tails asked with a friendly smile. They kept asking him questions with curious glints in their eyes. Tony’s lips twitch in annoyance as he tired to fake a smile. I shouldn’t have agreed to Barnes’ stupid dare. I don’t want to do this. I don’t know what I’m supposed to do. He thought in panic looking at their expecting gazes.
Their bickering on the pizza toppings were interrupted by the girls in their class who were talking about why Steve wasn’t here yet. Tony peeked at them from the side, getting interested. “Maybe he’s not coming to school today. He’s never late before”, one of the girls said with a frown.
He couldn’t wait to give the good news to his best friends, Pepper and Rhodey. It made him forget how tired he was a few minutes ago. Putting his letter inside his bagpack he rushed into the bathroom to get ready for school. Grabbing a piece of bread he head out the door, quickly locking it.
“I’m sorry if it bothered you, Miss Wanda”, he told her and seeing as Tony was handling things just fine he put his attention on his own customers.
“Yeah, I’m worried as well”, the other agreed staring down at the school gate. Seemingly waiting for said person.
“Steve, I don’t want to do this. Please don’t do this”, Tony cried out, clutching tightly on Steve’s uniform. The super soldier wrapped his arms around him, bringing him closer to his chest. “We don’t have any other choice, Tony”, he whispered in his ears as Tony cried harder.
“Tch, don’t apologize”, he tried to brush it off, “Anyway, you were late for practice but I guess you were still really good. You scored two goals”, he said looking up at the ceiling of the bus, his lousy attempt at trying to compliment the guy. Steve smiled at him relief but didn’t give a verbal reply.
They avengers were called out to confront Loki who was causing damage with the creature he had summoned with his magic. It was a dragon like beast. Gliding along the air and breathing out fire. Terrorizing the people.
What I mean is I hate you for waking me up this early in the morning. I only got to bed just an hour ago.
The guy let out a laugh and smirked at him. “Haven’t seen you around here. You’re new right? Otherwise I’m pretty sure I know everybody here”, he said, sizing him up.
Steve let out a grateful smile, holds Tony by the waist and hoisted him up to take him to the medics. Usually Tony would make a lot of excuse and fly off as soon as he could to avoid getting check ups. But this time he looked as if he didn’t know what was happening to him. He simply let Steve guide him to SHIELD’s medical team who took Tony from Cap’s arm and hoisted him onto one of the stretchers. SHIELD’s medic ensured him that they’d take good care of Iron Man and that there seemed to be no major injuries on him. That the hero was just feeling shock from the blast. Hearing that Steve finally gave them the okay as they closed the ambulance door and drove away.
When Tony went to his seat he found a note under his desk. It had asked him to meet during lunch at the back of the gym building. This seems fishy. He should probably ignore it but he was curious. So when lunch time came around he waved off at the others saying he needed to be somewhere and would meet up later.
“I heard today that Steve had taken you home in his car, lending you his blazer and even hugged you this morning”, she said, glaring at him.
If you’re male, liking someone would imply looking at her face first, followed by her legs and then her chest I guess. What else is there to love? Tony thought gazing out of the classroom window besides his seat. He was the senior most in the school being a third year. His classroom was also located on the third floor as well. Talk about coincidence.
“I won’t call it that. His name is Tony. He’s an excellent student even if his background isn’t very good. He is an interesting person to be around”, Steve replied with a kind smile. The girl looked over at him with rather cold eyes completely unnoticed by Steve as he continued to talk about Tony fondly.
“Steve…I’m sorry I left my wallet in the locker. I’ll pay you back later”, Tony told him as they went inside the school building.
Steve felt as if his heart was being ripped apart. It’s too cruel. He doesn’t want to do this either. He’d prefer it if he could spend whatever remaining time he had left with Tony in his arms, who, even a little bit knew him, loved him. But this was for the best. For Tony.
Tony came over to his side and took it. He soon let out a sigh of relief. “Yeah, it is….Thanks, Pres”, he told the blonde who smiled, telling him that he was happy he could help.
“But we do have proof of what you just did then. That’s enough”, Clint said flashing his own high end digital camera.
“I won’t be if I wasn’t detained by the weird students of this place”, he muttered as he made his way to an empty seat between a guy with glasses and a grumpy looking one. He glance to his seatmate and saw that his right hand was made of prosthetic one though he wasn’t sure if its just the hand or the whole arm as it was hidden under the uniform.
“Pepper? Why did you hit me?”, Tony asked with in a grouchy voice. He eyed her searching for something.
Getting into the separate class for the specials Tony let out an annoyed growl. Barnes was waving at him with a smirk plastered on his lips. He really hates that smugness of him. Felt like building a robot to drop the guy off a mountain or something else, something that would hurt. He glared at the guy. But then he noticed the handsome blonde sitting beside him. It was none other than the host club president, Steve Rogers.
“I can’t believe someone like you is spending time with Steve. Don’t think that he really cares about you just because you’re getting some of his attention…”. She went to saying how unworthy he was to be in his presence and that it should be her instead, having the attention of the president.
The game starts again and after 15 minutes into the game Rhodey got the ball and quickly passed it over to Steve who strategically took it without any effort and aimed straight for the goal as he kicked it. Right into the goal.
He went over and sat on his bedside, silently watching the rise and fall of the brunette’s chest. The only indication that he was still alive. Steve misses him already. Miss how Tony would keep on talking his ass off. Never the one to keep quite. He used to hate that, no, not exactly hate. He had been annoyed at first. Of Tony, who never seems to have an off button. Always spouting a bunch of stuffs.
Clint grinned, Natasha let out a sly smirk, Thor looked at him, tilting his head in confusion and Bucky’s brow frowned, a bit annoyed.
He thought back to how Tony had asked him out yesterday. It had really surprised him. That he didn’t have a girlfriend even though he was so popular.
Steve was watching the film quietly in his seat. He was surprised when there was a heavy mass on his shoulder. He looked to his side to find Tony leaning on his shoulder, snoring lightly.
Rhodey let out a nervous smile. “Ah, that reminds me….Pepper you…”, he started but she cut him off, “That’s right. I went out with him for exactly one week in July”, she said showing a peace sign.
“Why is that? The water is marvelous. One needs to experience this in action”, Thor replied trying to reach for him again. Tony made a run towards Bruce to hide behind him but ended up pushing him into the pool. He fell in yelling ’TONY!’.
“Tony. We can’t be your only friends”, they replied in unision. Letting out a small sigh he promised them that he’d atleast try to make new friends. Mostly to make them less worried.
“Not just a host, my dear friends. Steve here is our club leader as well as the school’s president. The no. 1 host with 70% selection. The one and only Steve Rogers!”, Clint introduced him with a grand gesture.
“Seriously… what’s with you?...Why are you still here?”, he said softly, so soft that he was able to hear it just because it was being spoken near his ears. Tony could feel his breath on his skin, leaving a tingling sensation. God, what is Rogers thinking?!
“Another job well done”, he hummed to himself. Now that he had finished the last job for the day he wondered what he should do next. Since it was late it would be a bother to go back to New York so he decided to stay in Brooklyn for the night. But where? He knew a few people who would gladly let him stay over but he could also easily book a room in a five star hotel. Money wasn’t a problem. He
“Good morning, Tony”, Steve greeted, smiling brightly at the brunette who just gaped at him surprised.
He’s really gonna die now isn’t he? There’s no way out of this mess. He thought bitterly. He just stood in his place like a statue. Not knowing what to do. Barnes brushed off the mess on him and got up silently, making his way towards Tony. The smaller brunette shut his eyes waiting for the pain. To everyone’s surprise he walked passed him without even a threat or a punch to the gut.
Bucky was the who had requested not to say anything, not wanting to crush his feelings. He had known Steve’s feelings for their mutual friend Peggy. He had wished that they would be happy together before but things happened and they had ended up going out instead. Feeling guilty he had not want to come out so soon.
“That’s not too far from here. Come on, I’ll show you around, newbie. The name’s Clint Barton. If you ever need any information on anyone here I’m the guy to go to”, Clint offered.
PS - I added Tony's uniform i drew on a whim, its sucks cause i haven't drawn in months but hope you like it
I just have to get 50 customers and the debt will be paid. I know just the story. He smiled making up a story about his life as the host club listened in from the sides.
“We’re so happy for you, Tony”, Pepper said as she brought Tony into a warm hug which the genius happily returned, laughing. Punching playfully at Tony’s shoulder, Rhodey asked when he was gonna join the big leagues. Betting that he must be ecstatic to leave this place.
“My god, you haven’t heard of us? We’re the most popular club in the academy. It’s practically a sin to not know us”, he declared.
Getting desperate one of their visiting team had intentionally knocked over Steve trying to steal the ball to which Steve was given a penalty kick by the referee.
Peggy had told him that she and Bucky have been going out for over three months now. And how they weren’t ready to tell their best friend before because they knew exactly how Steve had felt about her.
Then class went on. Even though he was told that the class had done a lot lessons before he joined Tony found that he didn’t miss much. Everything was pretty clear to him. To be honest they were kind of teaching him stuffs he already knew about. The studies are the easy part, studying with these characters was the hard part. Bruce was the most normal one he met so far.
“…Rogers? What’s wrong? Were you lonely because I wasn’t there when you woke up? Haha”. He said in an attempt to taunt him and get rid of this odd atmosphere but got no reply. The guy continued to hug him silently, his hold getting tighter than before.
“Alright, I’ll do it!”, he agreed thinking he would be able to pay of the debt and quit the club sooner as Steve let out a tired sigh looking over at his friends. He wonders if this was a good idea.
“You can’t really blame them. In your case there’s a huge gap between your personality and your appearance”, she told him. “It’s basically a scam”, she continued earning an annoyed glare from Tony but he didn’t argue on the matter. It was the truth.
Not able to form proper words he shouted a bunch of ‘stupid’ and ‘idiots’ and a ‘go die’ to the blond before he went running to class leaving behind a confused Steve.
Pulling up a chair next to sit near Tony’s desk Rhodey said, “It seems like Rogers hasn’t shown up yet today”
He picked up his phone again and started to push the button down, searching for a certain contact name. Upon coming down on a Tony Stark he select the name and proceeded to send a good morning text to said person.
“Are you an idiot? Hey, you’re an idiot, right?”, Tony said on the other side of the call. He sounded pissed.
On seeing the shock state of his lover Steve took Tony’s hand and guided him to the sofa and sat besides him, rubbing his thumb on top of his hand in circles. Trying to comfort him.
It was supposed to be just another day in the lives of the Avengers. Fighting for the people and protecting lives. Steve wouldn’t have known that the fight with the God of mischief would end up like this. If he did he’d never let Tony took part in it. In that fateful battle.
“I’m not the emotional type but man am I gonna miss you guys. You two are the only reason I even put up being here. I don’t know if I’ll enjoy the new school without you two. Who will nag me to do my chores or take care of me there?”, he said tackling them both into a hug on each side, laughing out loud at their surprised yelp.
“By the way, I wanted to ask..”, Steve started but Tony cut him off telling him not to change the subject.
Standing in front of his classroom he knocked on the door and found it sliding by itself, giving him entrance. “You must be Mr. Tony Stark. Welcome to the school. Take the seat near Barnes.  You’re late by the way”, the teacher, Maria Hill as was shown in the name tag said.
He just wishes Tony would wake up soon. So he could give him a kiss and tell him how much he missed him and loved him. That he would like to take him out on a date again. Until then, he’ll be here, by his side, until he wakes up.
“It makes me feel like a lousy person though. Borrowing stuffs and giving back without cleaning it”, Steve let out a chuckle,” And I bet you totally knew I still had it. You should have told me, idiot Pres”
The reason Steve’s popularity doesn’t drop even when he put an abrupt end to every relationship is because he would sincerely do everything his partner wants in that one week they went out.
“Detention after school for you, Stark”, saying that the mean teacher continued the class leaving Tony in a grumpy mood for the rest of the day.
“If it isn’t the new kid, Tony, right? What brings you to our humble abode? Wait, don’t tell me. You’re here to set up a date with one of the host, right? Feel free to do so, the Avengers Host club at your service. We also take requests, care to make one?”,
Steve didn’t think much of it. He guessed it happens because Tony had hit his head pretty hard during the fight and Tony didn’t seem to think much on it either. Brushing it off. But….
We are happy to give you a scholarship for your astounding works and performance in the field of robotics engineering. All your study materials and lab equipment will be provided for by the school. Therefore we would like you to continue your education here at SHIELD Academy. You can join us whenever you’re ready.
Walking over to the smaller brunette Steve greeted a ‘good morning’ to Tony who returned the gesture with a small smile.
“Told cha it wasn’t a good idea”, the guy said again and Tony could feel the guy smiling as he said it. He soon opened his eyes to meet with a pair of baby blues staring right back at him. Wow, those eyes sure look like they hold the secret to the universe or something. “Hi, I’m Steve Rogers. What are you doing here? Can I help you?”, he said, his earnestness clearly shown in his voice.
“It… doesn’t matter… if I forget ….everything else. Just…not you”, Tony breathe out slowly. He was getting tired, his vision blurry and his mind in a haze. Letting out another sob he fell asleep on Steve’s arms. Steve carried Tony into their room and pulls the sheets on top of him. Instead of getting to bed he continues to gaze at the sad expression on his lover, caressing his cheeks and brushing his fingers in his fluffy hair. God, he loved this man. And he was willing to do anything for him.
When Steve got the notice that Tony had finally woke up, he rushed out of the debriefing room, leaving Fury yelling at him while his team looked over with happy understanding eyes. In his hurry he had bumped into a few hospital staffs on the way, shouting his sorry as he ran on. A wide smile adorning his lips.
“Hey, did you guys forget about the pizza already? Someone’s gotta get them right? I told the delivery man I’d wait for it in front of the school gate. Laterz~”, the brunette replied throwing his pen at him which Rhodey easily caught.
“Tony, don’t worry. I’ll fix this, okay? We’ll find Loki and break the spell. So, just hang in there”, he whispered in a calming tone.
I entered SHIELD academy through my engineering scholarship as dad stated he won’t pay for it unless it’s related to medical studies.
Thinking back on Barnes maybe he wasn’t that bad a guy he seemed to be according to Bruce. You can’t be that bad if you fight for the weak, right? Maybe he’ll try to befriend the guy. While pondering on the thought he ends up slamming into a wall.
Rhodey with a calm smile replied, “Yeah, the day he’ll definitely say ‘YES’. And at the end of the week he’ll tell his partner exactly this..”
“Yep, got it in first guess. I’m a scholarship student joining today. Just heading to find the damn locker area before I get to class”
Eh? It’s okay?....It’s fine I’ll just ask one of the girls for which class he’s in. He told himself as he went to his class and enjoyed the pizza with his friends.
“That’s quite unfortunate. I think they were going to start the bid at 5 million dollars”, came Thor’s voice.
“I didn’t mean it that way. Don’t get angry. I was hoping we could exchange numbers”, Steve explained. Oh.
