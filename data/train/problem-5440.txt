on the rest of us by going after his one true love. Honestly, I’m not sure if I was a Montague or Capulet, so if you get ahold of the dream duo, ask ‘em for me, would ya? In fact, if you want answers period, don’t bother calling me. I’m actually sorry to say that I don’t fucking have them. O’ Captain Your Captain should, though. Why don’t you give him a ring? In the meantime, is there anything else I can help you gentlemen with?”
Those eyes pinned him in place, and Steve wondered, hoped, prayed, that the man with the divine brown eyes and angelic smile was just as struck as he was. A name. A name shouldn’t seem like such a monumental thing to give.
There’d always been a noose of weight around his neck, and he couldn’t yet call the days where he’d felt like he’d been being choked – the air stealing from his lungs – long gone. But every day that he could wake up and pay his rent with a surplus of money left over for food and other necessities, his breaths came in that much easier.
Biting into the cherry peach tart, Steve lurched forward as a molasses spill of custard and honey dribbled down his chin.
It didn’t take long for Tony to pack up his things from around his and Pepper’s Spartan bedroom. He tossed through their sheets in case there was something in the perfectly made bed he might need. Threw perfectly folded clothes over his shoulders onto their vacuumed and steamed carpet until rumpled piles littered on the once empty floor. Knocked over the holder for his toothbrush as he grabbed the thing to shove into a steadily bulging backpack.
They hadn’t been there, though. They didn’t help. So yeah, Tony, as unfair as the logical side of his brain told him it was, partially blamed them as well.
Tony Stark – in the breadth of a second – sparked a raging wildfire in his nervous system, igniting the wicks in a burst of yellowed firelight. It was like color had saturated back into his monochrome life, and Steve was, for the first time since he could be bothered to remember, content.
A sudden wave of homesickness and nostalgia poke at him, and Tony instantly shoos them away. He can’t do much about that now. Starks aren’t ones to dwell on the past, he remembers his father telling him. Ironic at least, hypocritical at best. The past holds no interest for Stark men, no matter how glum and grey the present and future currently look.
There was a movement behind Thor that caught Tony’s eye, and he found himself freezing. He got caught on the figure of a sheepish looking Bruce giving an equally sheepish wave.
Pulling it out, Tony softly thumbed the shiny cover of the metal case. With a smooth caress, he reached to the sides and pressed the latches. There was a hiss as the case cracked opened a small hairline of a fissure after so much time being ignored, but he didn’t push the lid the rest of the way up. Not yet.
Closing and opening his eyes lethargically, Tony looks on dumbly. He doesn’t think that should be there. Not anymore.
“Steve,” Mr. Stark repeated, and Steve knew there was no way to mistake the delicateness in his tone. The way his name came out with breathy awe, said in a low way that made him wonder if anyone else heard it. Heard the way his name seemed to hitch over Mr. Stark’s tongue and roll off in one, fluid motion. Steve wondered how his name tasted. If it was good. If Tony Stark liked saying it as much as Steve liked hearing it because he’d never heard it said quite like that before. Mr. Stark cleared his throat, turning with tentative movements to face the room again. “And if you’ll all be so kind as to show Mr. Rogers the ropes. I…” he coughed, peaking at Steve before he continued. “I hear he’s got more talent and dedication than most.”
looked sprawled across his tablet rather than stacked neatly on her nightstand on the opposite side of their vast California King. Her toothbrush should be placed in his aging holder right next to his instead of in a sparkling silver one placed on the second sink. Their clothes mixed so nicely together all over the floor and strewn along overflowing drawers and hangers, in Tony’s opinion. Much better than when they were separately folded into infuriatingly perfect squares and placed ever so carefully into roomy dressers.
Steve’s skin heated even more, and he knew the blush had to be covering the back of his neck by now. He reached up, rubbing at it. Always so conspicuous, his mind supplied in a voice that sounded like his ma, making Steve’s heart contract.
due for an upgrade. An upgrade Tony put off, kept putting off, for reasons he refused to think about. It was always the quickening of breath and heartbeat, the shaking of his fingers, the pounding darkness trying to pull him into the dimmed parts of his mind where he knew a demon lurked. Stalking, waiting to pull him back under and remind him.
Steve felt heat clamber through his entire face as he closed his mouth with a resounding snap. Well, it resounded in his own skull; he wasn’t sure if it was a mortifying echo to anyone else’s ears.
It’d been a surprise; they had no way of knowing about the incoming bomb. It hadn’t been his fault. That’s what Bucky kept telling him, anyway. The investigations, the hard-hitting interrogations, had a knack of making Steve think otherwise. “How did you manage to be the one person to come back alive?” they wanted to know.
As if they have a mind of their own, Tony’s fingers plunge through the material like an erratic sewing needle on a broken machine, and as soon as he has his grip, he takes it, tearing the spandex as hard as he can. It splits the suit right down the middle. The shoulder seems to cling to him while the rest of the fabric hangs loosely around his gaunt and haggard frame. Waxy, pale skin shines between the ripped edges of fabric making him look like he’s been the victim in some episode of
Taking a wobbling step forward, something in the near distance glimmers, catching his eye. There’s a figure lying on the ground, similar to his own earlier happenstance. Squinting, Tony takes a few more stumbling steps forward, legs feeling slack, almost numb. He watches as a gradual movement stirs itself from the figure and feels an instant wave of relief flood him.
It's what he told himself, anyway, when she buried those looks beneath something else he refused to see because he didn’t deserve it and stepped over the mess to pull him to her chest, rocking him while he tried not to break down.
“Uh,” Bruce said, turning back to the screen. “Yes, right. Well, we need you guys to come to Asgard.”
He found himself wanting to capture those wild wisps on a canvas and blinked. It was a desire he hadn’t had in a long time.
,” she emphasized, removing one arm from where both were tightly crossed at her chest to point directly into the center of his chest, so close that if the arc reactor was still there, she’d be touching it. “Or Iron Man?”
A hand clapped Steve’s shoulder, and he startled at the reminder that there were other people in the room. Bucky was looking at him, eyes darting around Steve’s face.
After some time, Tony slumps forward with a sigh. He struggles to get his legs out from underneath him, but, eventually, he’s rewarded with managing to splay them out in front of him. Tony preens, stretching his neck up to pull at the aching muscles in his arching back, flexing his feet to feel the tug up through his calves and to his hamstrings. When was the last time he’d been this relaxed?
A silence filled the room, and Tony blinked back to himself and the world around him reappeared. FRIDAY’s voice filled the room and Tony found himself inadvertently craning his neck up to watch the ceiling as she spoke. A bad habit he hadn’t gotten around to breaking.
The jarring, forceful slap of an explosion the size of New York City in his face was nothing compared to the expanse of
Letting out a growl, Tony swept a hand over his eyes. He tilted his head to glare accusingly at the suit one last time before wrenching himself back to the red and blue fabric clenched in his hand. He rubbed at the synthesized Kevlar and spandex between his fingers. Rough to the touch, but sturdy and mobile.
Something burned into the side of Steve’s face, and he stuttered his eyes up to find the man staring back at him, phone having gone dark in his hands. Steve felt heat threaten to take over his entire face and forced it back. In a miracle of all miracles, despite Steve’s obvious and invasive checking-out of the man’s everything, he gave Steve a hesitant smile.
He loved Pepper, though, and he knew she loved him. They could make this work. Like any couple, he and Pep had their ups and downs, their make-ups and break-ups, but they always came back to each other. Circled around one another until it was time to swoop down and start their loop all over again.
“Shit,” Tony says in a dazed huff. He’s somehow managed to find himself in the middle of a massive tarpit.
She scoffed, folding her arms and looking anywhere but Tony. He could see her jaw ticking in anger and inwardly flinched. “I’ve heard that one before,” she said through those clenched teeth.
Then Iron Man happened. And a lot of things after that that made him begin to think that maybe, just maybe, the explosion of that bomb had blown life back into him. Given him a hope he never knew he lost until long after the arc reactor was in his chest and he was far from that cave.
He paused before walking further into the room. Tony had to come up with some sort of tactic, a plan of sorts, to broach the subject. A way to tell her he was leaving, yet again, to do the thing she hated most that didn’t involve sneaking to the stairway on the opposite end of the hallway he’d just exited. As much as Tony desperately wanted to do that, and his eyes dipped longingly back to where he’d come, he was trying to be better at this kind of stuff. For her.
His eyes darted toward the buttons, all ninety-three of them, before skimming up to watch the red, digital letters tick off the passing floors like the lightning round at the end of a game. Steve swallowed, sucking in as deep a breath he could to encourage his heart to slow down.
However, Tony’s mature enough now to admit there may have been a little bit of ‘life-lesson-teaching’ in there about drinking and aggressive partying that took the form of Rhodey-shaped karma – something that was apparently Rhodey’s way of protecting a young, naïve sheep from much older wolves. Tony never understood the why of this, but he has never been one to look a foundation of friendship in the mouth.
Steve wanted to reach forward and run his fingertips over it; find the ridges where the scar ended. He craved to know if there was a way to soothe the skin there and make any lasting pain go away.
To his left, Steve heard Bucky begin to shuffle his weight, the scrit-scratching of his shoe on the Berber carpet like the sound of a car gearing up and revving its engine.
A part of him, a large part if he was so inclined to acknowledge, wanted to start laughing maniacally. Because
Tony severely hoped the need never would arise, but the twitching nervousness died down whenever he thought about the metal soaking in its acidic solution.
With the vow set in his mind, Tony became resolute in his actions. The promise of having Pepper back in his life was worth any sacrifice.
Reaching back into the recesses of his mind, Tony pulls the bleary images forward. He twitches slightly as the sensations overwhelm him. Like some sort of interactive play through.
It was a little disconcerting to feel the amount of discomfort he did at the thought. Because Tony didn’t want anyone to know him. Not really. He couldn’t fight his own demons that stalked his mind; no use asking someone else to.
“Talk about the express route,” he gasped out, placing his hand on his chest, gripping for the arc reactor and stopping when his grasp fell flat.
Sure, he’d etched out a doodle here or a sketch there in a waiting room, while studying ranks and general orders, or during briefings, but it was no more than that. A simple exercise to preoccupy the mind.
Tony watched, in his mind’s eye, as that fragile bridge shattered in his tired hands yet again. He swallowed thickly, letting himself surrender to the fatigue and the inevitable, and opened his too dry mouth to answer her.
A grin tugged lightly at his lips. Not enough to do much more than bring him a ghost of a smile, but enough for his heart to beat just a bit faster. Explosions weren’t so bad.
Steve opened his mouth to say something that he wanted to follow the lines of suave and reassuring when Bucky cut in. “You some bigshot?” he asked, avoiding Steve’s well-aimed elbow shot to his torso.
Steve was enraptured with the sudden need to capture Tony Stark in a moment. Every sighting became twice as monumental than they had been before. A fleeting breath of earthen locks and tanned skin outside Steve’s office window, a lithe body walking up a flight of stairs, a sloppy smile in S.I.’s café as Mr. Stark carried a bagel between impish sharp teeth and a cup of coffee held aloft in one hand while the other was busy in a wild dance on the keypad of his phone.
“Preparation for shipping out,” he’d tell Tony on a constant basis sounding more than a little apathetic to Tony’s hungover and tired-as-all-fucking-hell plight.
Steve swiped back the stringy hair falling into his eyes; he needed a haircut. Pinning the note to the back of his mind, he swooped his pen towards the paper in clear threat.
Sending another shy grin the man’s way, Steve looked back down because the carpet was very interesting with its blue and black pattern and whatnot. It was fascinating.
He seemed to eye Bucky with curiosity, too, roving over Bucky’s body with quick, darting movements. “I suppose that would be up to whom you ask. Are you some bigshot?” he retorted, tone low and smooth like silken sheets.
With a gagging intake of breath, Tony snaps his eyes open. He hadn’t even realized he’d closed them.
When he does manage to get his feet under him, his legs continue to wobble, making his first few attempted steps unsteady. Tony stares down at his feet, watching his vision pull apart into two before smashing back together. He realizes he has no idea how long he’s been out.
Steve suspected he was more obvious than he’d first thought if one conversation with Bruce Banner had the man rolling his eyes and muttering about hopeless admirers under his breath. When Steve invited Bruce to join him and Bucky for lunch, he’d regretted it almost as soon as they’d sat down. Bucky had taken one look at the project before bursting into fits of laughter and informing their newest companion of what he liked to call, “Steve’s little obsession.”
For a moment, he’s taken back to the sunsets that used to paint the Malibu house. How the sleek, smoothed surfaces, curved of titanium and glass, reflected the burning yellows, reds, and oranges like a mirage upon every surface as the sun sank beneath the ocean. The image is inescapable and utterly seared into his brain.
Craning his neck back, Tony searches the skies. Nothing. It’s like the entire thing is some domed ceiling with screens emitting one harmonious image like one of those God awful flat Earth models or
Meeting her eyes, filled with something all too familiar, Tony made his decision. Firm and unmoving. This was it. After this fight, Tony was going to be done. He would put the gauntlet down and destroy the damn thing like he should have after that goddam bastard drove a shield into his already battered heart. Like he should have before Pepper first broke up with him and let his eyes wander from her for the briefest of moments, but it had been long enough.
Tony always had. This was the first time he’d felt cold up here, but this was also the first time he’d come up alone.
Following their lead, he glanced back, watching the man strut out, raising his head like a cat prancing about. He skipped past them, giving Bucky a saccharine smirk.
He’d been sitting in his lab, and by the aches in his back, he’d been sitting there tinkering for far too long. With a groan, Tony placed his hands in the curve of his lower back, pressing in and pushing himself forward into an arching stretch. A few pops rattled the bones, and he rolled his shoulders, tilting his head from side to side. Aches or no, he still had suits to work on.
Every time he got started, though, he always did something. Made some kind of error in his calculations. Because the damn bridge always snapped, leaving him with the ruins, trying to start all over again.
A wariness settled in his gut, something new in his older, post-twenties age. An unknown number lived and breathed trouble, and he’d been a very good boy for Pepper. Had promised and fulfilled that promise of staying out of said trouble.
“What do you mean?” Bruce questioned, and Tony’s eyes snapped back to the screen. The two faces in front of him looked confused and he had to hold himself back from bursting into laughter. Or something worse.
He stared with bare awe, catching himself when Mr. Stark let out a huff of a laugh, shoulders hunching as he began to lean forward. Slender fingers cupped the right of his mouth as if he were about to share a secret. Without thinking, Steve leaned towards him, like being pulled in by a massive force of gravity. Pleasant amusement swayed in the depths of Mr. Stark’s pupils. He reached his other hand forward and tapped a single melodic note under Steve’s chin.
“What do you mean?” she demanded, features hard as she searched his face in that intimate way. The one that meant she was preparing for him to disappoint her again. “What’s going on?”
Tony doesn't seem to be much in a hurry either, but after a while he reaches down and pulls on his rock hard cock, his cries becoming more urgent, his movement more erratic, and before Steve knows it, Tony's gone, warmth coating their bellies in slow pulses. Steve is so far beyond the ability to withstand the sheer sensuality of it, that he takes only a few more thrusts to reach completion too. It's a full body experience, so much more intense than when he does it on his own, and he rolls with it, leaning heavily on Tony afterwards.
"Coffee?" Steve offers when the silence had stretched long enough. Tony fidgets in his place, rocks onto his toes, then slides his weight back to his heels. He twists his lips and then gives a quick nod of the head. Steve turns from him and heads for the kitchen. If Tony wants to, he can follow, and if not, he can stay by the door. Steve sets his jaw and reminds himself that they are nothing more than acquaintances.
Tony lifts an eyebrow, then leans back to study his face with the benefit of some distance. The dimness of the room isn't helping Steve's nerves. Seeing the shadows fall and play on Tony's face makes him itch for a pencil. "I don't hate you."
Tony's hands are on his back, but they migrate to his face soon after, cupping his cheeks and forcing him to look back into those browns. "You're so… so good…" he praises, and Steve can't look away from those eyes, those lips, that intoxicated smile. When he's finally seated all the way inside, he takes a long moment to regain some semblance of control, both of his body and his emotions. His hands are set on Tony's hips, and when he jerks his pelvis forward, Tony groans again, bliss written on his face. "Yeah baby… Just like… that…"
"I’m fine. We’re both fine," Tony tells him, and it looks like he's ready to say more, but he closes his mouth before any more can come out.
"She doesn't want to know, to be honest, but, no. She doesn't mind it." Steve turns to look at him and sees silent hope in his eyes, a tentative lean forward as he shifts his weight to his toes. Steve thinks
"Wouldn't blame you," Tony continues after a beat. "I mean, even I can admit I was a little flaky--"
"I don't believe you," Tony says in a slightly slurred tone after Steve withdraws from his body and disposes of the condom. He pauses on his way to retrieve tissues, and turns a questioning glance at Tony, who pulls himself onto his elbows to follow him around the room. "That can't possibly have been your first time."
When they meet for the first time, Steve can't get a good read on Tony Stark. Sure, he's read the files, but no paper can convey a personality, and the suit of armor leaves much to be desired. They don't get along well at first, but that's nothing new for Steve. He has a way of making bad first impressions, and with how much he's been struggling since he came out of the ice, he's surprised things aren't even worse.
drifts through Steve's mind. He pushes those words down along with anything that goes with them and concentrates on what he's doing. Tony doesn't answer his question, only reaches for him when he's done, like a drowning man.
These words have an unexpected effect on Tony, who stops squirming for a moment, melts against Steve's sheets with a low, relieved sound that verges on… on something Steve doesn't know how to name. The moment is gone within seconds, however, and the writhing comes back tenfold. Steve licks up Tony's neck towards his ear and starts up a steady, quick pace. Following his instincts seems like the way to go--it feels fantastic, and Tony's moans are like music to his ears.
A beat of silence is followed by a breathy "Aye Captain," which makes Steve a little dizzy. Sure, in the end Tony had accepted his leadership on the battlefield, but in this context it feels completely different.
When he looks up, Tony is smirking. "Oh. You liked that one." It's not a question, so Steve doesn't grace it with an answer. He simply pulls at the shirt once more, and Tony finally relents, lets him get it off.
Tony takes a long moment to process this, and then nods his head against Steve's skin. "I don't deserve this," he admits, sounding wrecked, and Steve realizes maybe Tony just needs to say this, even though it's impossibly hard, so he waits it out. "I just didn't know where to go… I couldn't…" He takes a short breath. "I couldn't face sleeping alone another night."
Steve thinks he might know where this is going. He hasn't been around this new century very long. Sure, where he comes from, the world he lived in two weeks ago, people did what they needed to do to keep themselves reasonably sane, too. They just didn't talk about it. What Tony is talking about sounds absurd. "An arrangement?"
That gets Steve's attention, but he figures it wouldn't do any good to question it, and just nods his head, letting his chin rub against the top of Tony's head. "Thank you, too."
"Hey," Tony sounds tired when he says it, even as he puts considerable force into it. He leans forward, his hand flat on the table. "I never said it was going to be more than a one time thing."
Steve thinks, not for the first time, that the pizza delivery guy really ought to get the addresses right, and stop knocking at ungodly hours of the night. He opens the door, ready to ward off the intrusion, and then he's reduced to staring. It's only after a long moment that he remembers himself and moves out of the way, letting Tony into his humble apartment and closing the door behind him.
Steve rolls his eyes, then tugs on the shirt once more. "I don't care what it looks like. We do this, we do it naked."
A sound escapes Tony as they kiss, maybe relief, maybe something else. Steve doesn't ask. He reaches for Tony, letting his hands rest on his flanks, not entirely touching him, before Tony wraps his arms around his shoulders and
It's really not as bad as Tony seems to think it is. Even in the dimness Steve can see the scarring, but it's all healed over, tender slivers of lighter shaded skin, barely noticeable. In the center, the arc reactor hums, drawing Steve's eyes. He doesn't reach for it, just stares. He can't imagine what having this kind of contraption lodged into the chest cavity feels like. Tony says nothing and the silence lingers.
"Never." Tony's tone is flippant, but when Steve looks at him again--and when had he lowered his gaze?--his expression is still sealed off, ready for criticism. Steve just stares.
Tony makes the sweetest noises and his hips rock in time with Steve's motions. He doesn't reciprocate for the time being, but Steve isn't really paying attention to that anyway. Instead, he wonders if Tony's like this with Pepper, then shoves the thought down ruthlessly. Tony is clearly not
"Shh…" Steve stops him when he feels him start to shake, rubbing a soothing palm along Tony's back. "I don't regret it. I don't know why you chose to come here, but I don't regret it, and neither should you, okay?"
"Could've fooled me," Steve retorts, but his tone is soft, lacking venom. He remembers those few intense glances Tony had directed at him, and feels his heart beating a bit faster. "And don't you have a girlfriend?"
They didn’t get along much and Steve is the first to admit that. But there’s something there… in Tony’s eyes, in the way he holds himself, Steve just doesn’t know what to make of it.
"Fuck… That was…" Tony mumbles, lips pressed against the hollow of Steve's shoulder. A moment later, he straightens and glances between them. Steve wishes he'd have finished that sentence, but when Tony looks at him next, he's grinning languidly. "Your turn."
Tony winces and Steve knows he hit the mark. When Tony lifts his gaze again, hesitant, he knows he can't refuse him. It's not even a matter of pity, or any warm and fuzzy emotion. He'd done this for Tony once, and even if it hadn't been a very thorough experience, it had left its mark. He'd do it if Tony'd need him to. There was only one thing to it, then.
At some point, Tony offhandedly remarks that the Tower's structural integrity is sound, and if anyone wants it, there's plenty of rooms to crash in for the night. So eventually, they let Tony usher them to the massive building.
They wash off the evidence and then dry off quickly. Steve feels changed, but he's not sure in what way. He follows Tony to the bedroom and they wear whatever they find in the cupboard. Steve doesn't ask Tony about the clothes, seeing as the place had been supposedly uninhabited, and simply puts them on.
"Uh…" Steve leans back as Tony leans in closer. He can't be reading this right. Tony's got a girlfriend and he's probably exhausted and…
He thinks, for a crazy moment, that this must be the slowest anyone's ever gone with Tony, then shoves the thought out of his mind.
Steve isn't sure what to say to that. He inclines his head a little and then resumes his motions. "That's good," he replies at last, turning Tony gently to stand under the spray of water to help rinse off the soap. Tony's eyes are closed when Steve catches a glimpse of his face. Words like
"Right," Tony finally says when the silence has grown so large that Steve isn't sure how to break it. "You wanna shower first? Not that I’d mind being filthy for this..."
Remembering himself a little, Steve presses deeper, twisting his fingers slowly, and it drives more delicious sounds out of Tony. He's tight, but there's plenty of give, and before long Tony's breathing, "More… Steve, more."
If the statement surprises Tony, he doesn't let it show. He shrugs and looks at Steve's coffee machine. He lifts the mug to his lips and drinks without looking down. Steve hasn't even taken a single sip, but now he can't even think about it. Tony finally glances at him with a rueful smile. "I can work with that… I was kinda hoping you'd top, anyway."
They drift off to sleep like this, and in the morning Tony wakes him up with a hand on his dick. Steve doesn't ask himself why, but he goes along with it anyway, and when he ushers Tony out of his apartment later, he's proud about the slight stall in Tony's step and the marks on his neck.
"You'll tell me?" he asks, letting his free hand caress along Tony's chest and side, unconsciously sidestepping where the arc reactor used to sit. Tony nods his head, looks amused and relieved in equal parts.
Tony chews on his lower lip, contemplating the mug in front of him. "S'been a rough week," he finally says, defeated. "I need… I need…"
"Let me help you out of this," Steve says against Tony's lips, his hands reaching for Tony's shirt to start working it open. Finally, hands rest on his side, and Steve pulls a little back to offer a small smile. "Okay?" he asks as he pushes his hands under the shirt, reaching for his shoulders to slide the item off. Tony cooperates, sends him a wavering smile back and doesn't mention the disappearance of the blue circle from his chest. Steve doesn't comment on it either. He'd been curious, but a small part of him is relieved to see it gone.
The breath all but bursts out of Tony in a gust, and he leans his forehead against Steve's shoulder. The hand not currently holding him intimately rests on Steve's bicep and squeezes lightly. "Yeah…."
"I don't…" Steve glances over, and Tony is standing closer than he'd expected. Steve doesn't step back. "I'm not used to this… uh…" God, he's nervous. Why is he nervous?
"Yeah?" Steve feels heat creeping down his nape and over his cheeks. He tries to remind himself that Tony had left him out of the loop for days--weeks, really. He’d let him worry and wallow in grief, but Steve can't hold onto that anger when Tony's looking so desperate. No amount of flippant demeanour can hide that he's teetering on an edge. Tony bites his lip, and Steve sighs. There was never really any hope for him to reject Tony. He gets to his feet and waits for Tony to do the same.
When he gets Tony off, he's surprised at the stillness of it, the silence. Tony chokes back any sound he might've made, biting his lip and moving in light spasms against him. Steve himself tends to be quiet too, but he'd imagined Tony'd be a lot more extravagant about it. He wonders what kind of noise Tony would've made if he didn't insist on holding it back.
"We do whatever with whoever, so long as we stay safe and keep it out of the public's eye. It's worked so far." Tony shrugs, but it's a stiff motion, like he's waiting for the blow.
"I've never done anything like this," Steve says on a choked breath. "That was the third time anyone's ever kissed me." He feels his face warming but stands his ground. "Trust me, you don't want me."
"You're angry," Tony says by way of starting the conversation he clearly doesn't want to have. He steps around the table and sits down, and when Steve looks at him, he sees it. This is the last thing Tony needs right now, one more person he’ll have to apologize to. If Steve were a better person, perhaps he would've let it slide, but he still feels the burn of Tony’s absence in the back of his throat and he sips the coffee to forestall having to answer.
Time sort of loses meaning for a while after that. All that matters is motion and sensation. The way Tony kneads Steve's ass, his soft little sounds, the smell of his sweat. Their bodies move like they were meant to fit like this, and Steve doesn't want it to end.
Tony's hands are at the fastenings of Steve's uniform, and Steve dutifully helps him get the outer layer off. He's not particularly self conscious about his body, but this feels different. It's intimate and the intent is hugely different from what he's used to. He still feels grimy from the battle, but remains silent about it as he moves to take off his undershirt in one smooth motion.
In the morning, Tony's phone rings, waking them up. Pepper has arrived in New York and is looking for Tony. She's probably worried sick, Steve thinks, and tries to figure out the complex set of Tony's expression as he talks to her.
Tony sucks in a breath, and Steve feels himself flushing with strange satisfaction. It's not often that he gets naked in the presence of others, and he likes that he can affect Tony like this. When he reaches for Tony's shirt, though, two firm grips at his wrists stop him, and Tony gives him a pointed stare. Steve just casts him a quizzical look in return.
They part ways then, as Tony goes to see Pepper, and Steve goes to check up on the rest of their team. He tries not to look too closely at the new aching feeling in his chest, a feeling that is now nestled next to everything else Steve already carries.
Pushing his emotions aside, Steve focuses on the battle at hand. They find the Tesseract, and they find Loki, and then they find a full alien army to fight. The mess escalates. They nearly lose the entire population of Manhattan, and then they nearly lose Tony. Steve had been moments from doing CPR when the Hulk roared and brought him back to life.
he needs. Steve really wouldn't know either way, of course. He hasn't had the chance to spend much time with him. All he has to go by is that look and the utter desperation Tony had approached him with.
"Comfort?" Tony offers, a cheeky smile on his face that wavers a little. Steve wonders how Tony can even be smiling right now. He'd nearly died, out in space, alone, only a handful of hours ago. Steve gulps because Tony is now even closer, and he realizes he'd been in this situation before. An all too vivid memory of a secretary cornering him, offering to thank him in the name of all those wives…
They get rid of the rest of their clothes pretty quickly. Steve notes a twinge in his ribs and wonders if they're bruised or fractured, but then ignores it. He's healing. It'll pass soon and the water will help. When his eyes settle on Tony's body, it gives him pause. Sure he'd seen men naked before, but now the context is different, and he's not sure where to even start. Tony saves him the trouble and grins at him before turning to get the shower started.
Tony shows up at the kitchen door a minute later and leans against the doorframe. He's not looking at Steve. Steve isn't looking directly at him, either. He pours out the coffee and turns to hand one mug to Tony before settling at the kitchen table.
"Steve…" Tony's voice is hushed when Steve settles between his parted thighs, contemplating the packets of lube. "I can take care of this part--" He drops the sentence when Steve shoots him a look. He's never shied from a challenge before, and he's not going to start now. He gives a small smile then, lowering his gaze to Tony's groin.
gone. He'd only let the whole world think so, including Steve. The news of his return had been a sigh of relief, but now Steve can't help but wonder, briefly and painfully, if there had been even a moment when Tony had thought about calling him for help.
"No," Steve cuts in immediately. "You don't really want me to." And judging by the smoothing at the corners of Tony's eyes and his forehead, the lose of that pinched look, it's the right call. Maybe… Maybe some day Tony would trust him enough for that, but there's no point in pushing any unnecessary boundaries. "Let me…" he says then, sliding his hands along Tony's sides, his thumbs mapping out the outline of Tony's body until he reaches his hips again. He lets his right hand trail inwards along the lower abdomen before wrapping his fingers around Tony's hardened cock.
Well, whatever Tony's expecting, Steve hopes this is enough supplies. Tony makes a low humming sound under his breath, and Steve turns to him. The nerves play under his ribcage but he knows he can do it--Tony needs him to.
"I can do it," he asserts, and Tony nods his head and makes himself comfortable, sprawling loose limbed before him. Steve swallows thickly and sets the supplies aside, letting his hands slide from Tony's abdomen and down his thighs, tracing along the inner thighs towards the center, but not touching him intimately yet. Instead, he pushes his hands lower, cupping Tony's ass. He watches his own hands, sees everything in the dim light. The hang of Tony's balls, the tightening at the base of his hardening cock, the trembling, tight ring of muscles. He slides his thumb gently from under Tony's balls towards the back, and Tony makes an obscene noise, drops his head on the bed.
Steve doesn't look at him to see what kind of expression is on his face. It doesn't matter how Tony looks at him now. Tomorrow they'll be just associates again. There's no need to get overly attached.
single, Steve does remember all the stuff he'd read about him in the files. Emotional investment sure wasn't in there.
"Look at you…” Tony breathes. He takes the sponge from Steve and lets it drop to the floor. “All slippery muscles in my shower…"
Tony's eyes are lowered when Steve turns his gaze on him. He helps Tony get the sleep shirt off and lets it drop beside him. Tony feasts his eyes on the sight of him and Steve gets that now-familiar warmth in his belly at being so appreciated.
"Okay," Steve answers, breathless, and leans down to trace kisses along Tony's neck. "I've got you."
"Don’t you want to touch me, too?" Tony coaxes gently, then. The tenderness he finds in Tony's face when he finally
Tony, in turn, lets out a breath of his own, and it's a fragile thing. Even as he speaks, a knot between Tony's brows tells Steve the truth. "You can touch that, too, but just--"
. Steve isn't even sure what to do when tongues come into play, but Tony patiently shows him, and he's always been quick to learn new things, even more so since the serum. He feels hot all over, like he's overdressed and drenched in boiling water, and it all gets so much headier when Tony rubs himself against Steve's body fully. The uniform doesn't allow much sensation, but just the pressure, the heat of it is maddening, and it's already making him crave more.
When Tony's hand starts moving on him, Steve realizes just how turned on he is by the whole thing. He's as hard as he can ever remember himself being, and Tony's warm, calloused hands handle him just right. When he finally comes undone, he can feel Tony's eyes on him, and it only enhances the flush of completion. He sags a little against Tony after, distantly impressed that Tony is able to keep them upright.
He kneels down and cups Tony's face carefully. Asking what Tony wants hasn't yielded any results, and Steve doesn't think asking again would have a different effect. So instead, he leans in to kiss him, a light touch of lips intended mostly to bring Tony back to the present. It seems to work, as Tony lets out a slow breath through his nose. Those eyes close, and the atmosphere shifts slightly. Steve thinks he can do this if it's Tony. He can give him whatever comfort he needs.
Steve snorts at that and pulls back to look at him. His heart is racing half in excitement half in dread, and he lets his eyes roam Tony's body as he settles on his heels. How is he ever going to live up to Tony's expectations? His breathing is shallow as he palms Tony's dick in slow, fluid motions and Tony arches a little off the bed, thrusting into his loose fist. "You're sure you wanna do this with…" Tony gives him a dazed look, but he has a raised eyebrow in obvious question. "With a virgin…?"
For some reason, Steve is the last to have a place assigned. They keep a tentative silence between them as they head for where Steve assumes is his designated guest-room for the night. When they finally get there, Tony stands back, watching him take in the room. It's lush and expensive, even after the ruin in the top floors. Some stuff is knocked over and there's dust settled where it probably shouldn't be, but it all looks pretty much intact.
"I shouldn't be here," Tony says eventually. And as if to dispute this, his arms tighten around Steve's middle. "Just…" He tilts his head, pressing his forehead to Steve's chest with a little too much force. "Just… I…"
Steve considers adding another finger, and glancing at Tony, he realizes he can't really ask him. Tony's twisting the bedsheets in his hands and pressing his cheek to the cool mattress, so Steve just goes for it. It's a tighter fit, and Tony momentarily squeezes in surprise, his eyes snapping open and zooming on Steve, but the smile smeared on his face is welcoming, so he assumes that's answer enough. "Alright?" Steve asks despite himself, and Tony doesn't dignify that with a verbal answer, only gives a low groan when Steve crooks his fingers just so.
"Steve?" Tony asks, his voice quiet, as Steve feels himself drifting off. He gives a questioning hum. "Thank you."
They get out of the rest of their clothes in short order, resettling on Steve's bed, and he lowers himself on top of Tony, lets their bodies slot against one another enticingly. He wants to savor this for as long as he can have it, but Tony soon starts writhing beneath him
Steve pulls back abruptly, hands falling on Tony's shoulders. His heart is racing as are his thoughts. What the hell is going on here? Nothing at all had indicated this was going to happen and to be honest, Steve had been under the impression that Tony couldn't even stand him and--
"That. I told you not to do that," Tony says, almost scolding, but he doesn't step back. He makes no move to kiss him again, for which Steve is grateful. He watches Tony's face closely for… anything, really, but all he can see is exhaustion, a tightness around the eyes.
Tony approaches him, hesitates, and then reaches out a hand to grasp at Steve's sleep shirt. It's a careful motion, slow but constant, like he's waiting for Steve to pull back, but he stands his ground. A breath stutters out of Tony when he finally gets a good hold, his knuckles brushing against Steve's side through the material of the shirt.
"More than," Tony finally manages on a pant, eyes lighting on Steve's hardness. "Mind getting that in me?" he asks, wiggling against Steve's hand, and Steve feels a twitch of anticipation down his spine and at the base of his cock. He nods his head and withdraws his fingers, reaching for a condom with his clean hand. He rips the foil open with his teeth and draws out the rubber, then rolls it on. Adding lube, Steve reaches for Tony again.
Repeating the motion, Steve smiles. With a bit of his confidence restored, he reaches for a pack of lube and tears it open over his fingers, coats them with the slick, then reaches down to slide one against Tony's hole. A glance at his face and a short pause make Tony return the look. God, he's so tense… A jerky little nod of the head is all Steve needs before he presses his finger more firmly against him.
Tony kept that up until Steve hissed out a breath and his skin was a bright red. The brunette kissed every inch of tormented skin, licking at the warm, delicate rim as a kind of balm to that now crimson colored opening.
Steve chuckled softly, finally opening his eyes. Tony giggled too, kissing his lover’s shoulder. Nothing was said for a while between the couple, Steve lifting his head and finding Tony’s lips and kissing him unhurriedly.
The story of Brayan and Ferris was something I made up. I found the names to be of Irish/Scottish origin. And since Steve's family is of Irish descent, I figured it would be a nod to his roots.
“We woulda saved them even if you didn’t catapult yourself into that alien beast’s mouth,” Tony snapped, fiddling with the black under suit he was wearing. “We had a strategy and you went against it because you had to be some big hero or whatever.”
They held one another in that shrouded haven after, the sweat cooling on their skin, their release that sprinkled their bodies a result of both desire and loving affection. Tony held Steve close, and in turn Steve rested his head on Tony's chest, pressing a lazy kiss to the glowing arc reactor. He traced his hand over the one sinewy bicep of his soulmate, breathing easy.
“What’s this?” Tony asked in interest, lifting the garment up completely to reveal Steve’s lingerie panties. “Well what do we have here?” The brunette took in how the purple silky fabric strained from Steve’s growing erection, a damp spot forming from the leaking head. “Aren’t you just full of surprises tonight,” Tony said with a wink, tracing a finger over the curve of the man’s aroused penis still hidden under the fabric. Steve gasped, hips stuttering forward for more friction. “I think you should keep this slip on while I fuck you tonight,” Tony stated, looking up at Steve. “Would you like that?”
Even though it took him a while to wake up, Steve did like that the tower was rather quiet, letting him have some time to himself before the hustle and bustle of the day had become overwhelming.
After Steve’s novice strip tease, the genius could finally see the glimpse of the lingerie cloth. And when Steve’s sweats fell to his ankles, Tony nearly dropped his wine glass at the sight of his beloved in his pure, intimate garments. The shimmering panties were of the same navy color, with a chiffon overlay on top, giving the lingerie an almost iridescent sheen.
“Those civilians were in danger, I had to do something,” Steve started before Thor dropped down, shaking the ground with his landing as well as disrupting his teammates’ inevitable argument.
“Is this it?” Steve asked, and Tony reluctantly turned to see the oil canister in the super soldier’s grasp. Tony’s eyes typically betrayed him as he immediately looked back to Steve’s bare shoulders and glorious torso. Why the hell was the man still shirtless?! Couldn’t he see Tony’s discomfort?
Steve had gone back to the Tower a week after the injury, Tony constantly by his side, tending to him more than was probably necessary, Steve figured.
“Really, I’ve slept on the cold dead earth in the war. The couch will still be like a cloud. Plus, sometimes I am rather restless and move a lot,” Steve admitted. “I don’t want to disturb you if I was in the bed as well.” Sometimes Steve had nightmares of Bucky falling from that train, or of himself going down in the plane. And even more recent missions, like of Tony falling out of the portal during the Chitauri attack.
“I don’t know,” Tony replied, mouth pressed against the creamy skin close to Steve’s groin. “Kinda wanna see how desperate I can make you before I take you.” He worried against the firm skin with his teeth, swiping the facial hair on his cheek against it, driving Steve wild beneath him.
Tony hadn’t realized he had been holding his breath the entire time Steve spoke so lecherously to him. The genius licked his lips as his mind ran wild with visages of his blonde lover under him, moaning as Tony fucked him senseless beneath the moonlit sky.
“You’re beautiful, Tony,” Steve breathed, a look of awe on his face, as his eyes glided back up to rest on Tony’s arc reactor. He could hear its faint hum and Steve tentatively placed a hand on it, watching Tony’s expression to make sure he was alright with him touching it.
With Steve, Tony was home. And now he and Steve would be able to make a loving, sweet home that was all their own.
“Steve?” Tony called once he grounded himself. He gave a courtesy knock before letting himself in. Quickly, he shut the door behind him, turning then to search for Steve. Tony nearly dropped the box in his hand when his eyes fell upon Steve, who was sitting on his bed in a breathtaking lingerie piece, his hands tied together at the wrists with a deep crimson, silk ribbon.
Hearing Tony’s dulcet voice say such a gentle command put Steve on the edge of succumbing to a monumental and pleasurable fall. Especially with the brunette’s digits hooking deeply inside of him, hitting that sensitive sweet spot, all the while thumbing at the slit of Steve’s penis which dripped with prerelease.
“How ya doin’, Cap?” Tony said, looking at the blonde expectantly. It made sense, Steve figured. He never came down here, so Tony probably just thought he needed something.
Steve peered at him from over his shoulder, arms crossed under his chin. “Please, Tony,” Steve breathed out, arching back and into Tony’s hands, relishing in the brunette’s ass play.
Eventually their friendship grew into a romantic relationship. It was a little awkward for both of them, neither of them being with a man before and Steve not being well versed in the bedroom in general. They stumbled like any new relationship, but made it work. They were still learning things about each other, what made the other tick. And boy did Tony know how to get him all hot and bothered. It was a problem for Steve, it was as if he was heightened to everything surrounding Tony. The way he would casually smile at Steve, or gently touch his shoulder or bicep as he walked past him. It was the little things that made the blonde ache for his boyfriend. Or, Tony would out of the blue pin Steve against a wall and delve in for a hot and passionate kiss, his tongue searching inside the blonde’s mouth while his hand reached around to squeeze at Steve’s bum. Then, when Steve would try to pull away and ask for them to head to one of their bedroom’s Tony would back off, give him a playful grin and walk away, leaving Steve gasping for air, an uncomfortable tightness in his pants.
“Mmm, you take it so good, baby,” Tony cooed, hooking his finger deeply into Steve, his other hand finding its way under the man’s groin, only to rub small gentle circles into the blonde’s perineum.
The last of twilight fell over the vast expansion of the Atlantic Ocean, the stars fading into the velvety sky. They sparkled and shimmered, their light flickering in the glow of the moon, reflecting on the water beneath like gentle kisses.
Underneath the title was a grainy image of Tony and a beautiful buxom woman leaving a luxury apartment.
“Nothing major,” Steve said simply. “So, can I help you at all with your car? I’ve done some maintenance on old cars and bikes in the Army.
“I guess so,” the blonde woman said, looking up at him. “Speaking of trust, and honesty, I’ll admit my name isn’t Kate,” she chuckled then, extending her hand. “My name is Sharon, Sharon Carter.” Steve went to shake her hand with a warm smile. Her last name struck him then, and he paused their handshake midway.
After he made his bed and used the bathroom, Steve decided to go see Tony in his bedroom. Even though he was awake and should begin his morning routine, Steve wanted to go see his love, maybe cuddle the man until he woke up. Plus, being in his lingerie nightie, one Tony had never seen, might be an extra treat for the brunette.
“You’re to good to me,” Tony breathed, eyes falling shut. The blonde replied with a kiss to Tony’s soft lips before he resumed his position, his head now nuzzled under Tony’s scruffy jaw.
Walking back up to the truck, Tony wrapped an arm around Steve’s shoulders, shaking him lightly. “Alright let’s get some food and then get some sleep.”
Slowly, Tony slipped Steve’s knees off his shoulders, unfolding the man from the intimate position carefully. When Tony’s softened penis exited Steve’s body, the blonde squirmed a bit from the sudden loss, his hole winking around emptiness. Tony tenderly pushed two fingers inside his love, caressing the muscle as it relaxed. Steve hummed pleasantly, appreciating how Tony would do such things without any prompting, the man just knowing Steve well enough to do such a loving, sweet act for him.
“Yes, love?” Tony huffed out, eyes wide and moving from one part of Steve to the other. Tony began stroking himself quicker, falling into rhythm with the now two fingers Steve pumped into himself. The rim was taut, the pink skin gleaming with excess lube as the super soldier scissored himself, tugging at his entrance a little forcefully. The blonde dropped his hand from his chest to one of his inner thighs, rubbing at the fair skin and muscle, kindling an immense sensation of arousal in his lower belly.
“Having you here with me,” Steve confessed, looking at the genius through his lashes. Romantic feelings aside, Steve truly cherished their time together. He wanted Tony to know that all of it was perfect, and that he had done more than enough for Steve. Even when it came to friendships, the brunette needed to be reminded that he was indeed good enough. Steve understood why though, not only did Tony have high expectations for himself, but so did the world.
Steve had the best station in his opinion. He painted little Christmas and other holiday pictures on the kids’ chubby chapped cheeks. Seeing their faces light up when they looked at their painted cheek in the hand held mirror made Steve’s heart swell. They’d hug him goodbye, holding onto their parent’s hand and waving to Steve as they walked away. Steve would give them a soldier’s salute before security let the next child take a seat and picking out the image they wanted done.
“Don’t need to tell me twice,” Tony said, eyes black and hungry. He grabbed Steve by the hips and shoved him down onto his lap, causing Steve to huff out a breath in surprise. He pushed in against his love, kissing the man ravenously, without haste. He wanted Tony to taste the chocolate that lingered in Steve’s mouth, knowing where that sweet sauce had been. Tony pulled away, only to bite at Steve’s square jaw, teasing the skin there before traveling lower, kneading his teeth against the blonde’s creamy neck.
“Go ahead, Steve. Come,” Tony whispered in his ear as he hooked his two digits deep inside the blonde, spreading them wide within Steve’s entrance. Steve looked at himself in the mirror, watching as he fucked himself on Tony’s fingers relentlessly, wanting only to be filled up completely. It was that explicit image displayed before him, with Tony staring at him in the reflection, that pushed him over the edge.
The blonde pushed their breakfast plates and mugs away, bracing his palms on the shiny, dark stained wood table as Tony hugged him from behind, his cheek and chin nuzzling between Steve’s scapulae.
“Well, I want you to be able to see what I see,” Tony remarked, slowly getting off of the man and pulling him up by the hands. “Let me show you what I mean.”
The couple stayed that way for a few sweet, unhurried moments, the pain of Steve’s engorged erection nothing but minute as he reveled and cossetted in Tony’s embrace. When Steve pulled away for a breather, Tony took that opportunity to slip a hand down to Steve’s length, giving it a few heavy strokes and enjoying how it took his boyfriend by surprise. The blonde moaned and bucked his hips into Tony’s tight fist, his body overcome with sensations.
Tony slowly, and as quietly as he could, opened his bedroom door of Avengers Tower. He instantly smiled wildly upon seeing Steve nestled under those soft sheets of his bed, strong arms wrapped securely around one of Tony’s pillows. That made the genius’s heart pinch a little, knowing Steve was missing Tony as much as Tony was missing him. Tony wasn’t able to really get ahold of Steve much while he was away, the place where he was not having any reception do to classification purposes.
“Just wanted to scout the terrain tonight. Don’t want to let my guard down…not for a second,” Steve explained while Natasha pulled herself up next to him. “I don’t think I could live with loosing another one of our own,” he continued. Natasha looked down at her hands, pursing her lips in thought. She knew what Steve was referencing.
“God, I wish I had an artistic talent,” Tony said, biting his lower lip while watching his blonde boyfriend. “I would draw you just like this, Stevie. Though I don’t believe Michelangelo or Leonardo could equate your beauty on paper or in marble,” Tony praised, slipping Steve’s legs over his hips.
They watched each other a moment, wishing that they were not separated by distance or computer screens. It was Steve who made the first move though, gently caressing his inner thigh, muscles flexing under his touch before he trailed light touches up his penis. Steve let out a surprised gasp, as if he had no idea it would feel so good to touch himself intimately. Tony watched as the man’s fingertips skirted up and down the underside of his erection, teasing the head more and more with each swipe up.
Tony assured himself this would all pass, and everything would be fine. This was merely just a bump in the road of his pothole filled, ‘roadwork ahead’ life.
“Well, I must let you rest, good merman,” Tony started, turning for the door. “I shall be back to check in on you, as well as send a meal for you.”
“Oh, yeah. Well, I wasn’t planning on coming, but there is going to be a tribute and speech to Peggy.” Steve shrugged and smirked. “Didn’t want to miss something else with her.”
“Uhn, T-Tony,” Steve moaned sweetly, his free hand moving to pinch and pluck at one of his pert nipples, his fingernail scraping the bud, making the blonde bite his lip.
am the luckiest guy in the world,” he continued, his eyes looking Steve over. “Because I have you, Steve, and I’m never gonna let you go,” he grinned, burying his head underneath the blonde’s chin.
“Damn, Steve. Love your mouth.” Tony breathed, a hand lowering to one of Steve’s biceps, his thumb brushing along the ridge of where his tricep and bicep meet.
“Oh, Tony,” Pepper started, folding her arms across her chest. “I ended things because you couldn’t give me your heart. Because you don’t see where your heart truly lies, where it will always lie,” she reiterated from their last conversation. “Don’t you dare try to turn the tables on me.” She stared him down, her blue eyes fierce.
“If at any point, you are uncomfortable, I’m sure you could easily tear out of that ribbon,” Tony said, leaning back and grasping the hem of his shirt and pulling it over his head. Steve watched, entranced by the revealing of his boyfriend’s naked skin. Even though he saw Tony shirtless, (and naked for that matter) all the time, he still found the man to be a sight to behold. Oh, how he wished to paint the man one day.
“Yes,” Tony said, taking off his sunglasses. Steve was secretly happy about that, he hated when Tony wore those tinted glasses inside, because then Steve couldn’t see the man’s striking eyes. “One room under Stark.” Tony said, taking out one of his credit cards.
It was the next morning that Steve had a knock on his apartment door. He was in the middle of sifting through the documents he made copies of at SHIELD. It took a lot of coaxing for them to let him have copies, but once Nick Fury gave direct permission, the director of archives reluctantly gave Steve the documents.
That part of their lives was over. “Finish it,” Tony had said, laying on his back with the arc reactor exposed, and Steve almost did. The scene played over and over in his dreams and nightmares and whenever he closed his eyes.
“Tony.” Pepper said gently. She reached across the table and laid a hand on his arm. Right over the soul mark. He wondered if she remembered.
“Right.” Tony said. He faked a smile, mostly for himself. Pepper and Rhodey could see right through it, he knew, but neither of them said anything. “Big, terrifying alien spaceship looming overhead. And a planet’s worth of Asgardian refugees.”
The world never gave Tony much time to wallow. It was good, really, to keep busy. It was… Better, if he was preoccupied. Better to worry about alien invasions and magic rocks than to think about the empty space in his bed. And at the table. And on the couch in his workshop. And–
They both moved at once, Tony flying quicker than was probably safe with a single working repulsor. He and Steve stopped a few feet away from each other.
Suddenly there was a commotion outside. Steve looked out into the hall to see a group of warriors rushing into the armory and quickly running back out again. He saw T’challa and stepped in front of him.
The disposable phone sat, untouched, on a table in Tony’s workshop. He was supposed to be working, but he couldn’t remember what he was working on. Maybe a new armor. Maybe the exoskeleton he was making Rhodey. Maybe the Pepper or the board had given him some pressing deadline.
It was a peaceful moment, quiet, and neither of them talked. Steve hadn’t told Bucky about Tony yet. He wasn’t sure how. “That was my soulmate we nearly killed back there
Tony would have loved it. Steve hardly understood any of the technology around them, which meant Tony would have been amazed, if not floored. He would have wanted to reverse engineer every part of it– the flying cars, the healing chambers, the supercomputers, probably even the wiring in the walls, just to see how it was different. He would have spent all day huddled over something in his workshop, or on the floor if he got too excited. His face would light up and he would tell Steve about every detail he discovered, every new trick, and how he was going to use it.
“You know the answer to that one, honey bear.” Tony said. “We’re calling the–” He stopped. Avengers didn’t feel right, not without Steve. “We’re calling the team.”
Tony had thought, long ago, that having a soul mate would fix everything. As a kid he had relied on it. He needed to believe that somewhere out there was someone would love him unconditionally.
