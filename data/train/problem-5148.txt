Cathy eyed Natasha as Tony awaited her answer. She grimaced but answered, “The doctors will update you. I haven’t been in the room to work with Captain Rogers. I’m sorry.” She glanced at Thor and Tony glimpsed a slight intimidation on the nurse’s part. Thor recognized it as well. The demigod gestured for her to lead the way as he started to tell a story about his childhood.
He knocks the big oaf away. “Stop. Gotta- gotta ca-catch my -.” He stops as his lung rebel. Blu pushes him down to lean forward and then gently and rhythmically licks his back. Tony follows the rhythm and his lung and diaphragm relax. He can take a breath. It still hurts just not as bad. He waves Blu away. “Good. I got this now. Thanks.”
Tony snickers and slaps Steve on the back. He points to the microwave. “We’ll bring the popcorn. Get dressed and I’ll meet you in the living room in 15 minutes.”  He doesn’t give Steve long to get ready because the thought of him changing his mind tightens Tony’s chest, and causes his palms to get sweaty. Unfortunately, that also means Tony’s left with only a short time to get beautiful.
Loki lowers the staff. “And why not? You lose time, dear Captain. Time ticks onward. At any moment you may very well lose your life, or he may lose his. And here you hide away, what’s dearest in your heart.”
Steve jerks his head in a nod. It has occurred to him. “Could be.” He squints as he surveys the snowy wilderness around them. Spotting a rocky rise he points. “Do you think we could find shelter in that area?”
“I like to tinker, invent stuff. I know it’s not my station in life. That’s for betas, but for me it’s relaxing,” Tony says and welcomes Steven to his workshop. Steven touches the main workbench and slides his hands over the tabletop. He picks up some of the different pieces of tech that Tony’s working on. “I call that the arc oscillator. It will revolutionize the whole industry.”
“Not far. Not with this armor. It’s not complete and doesn’t have all the instructions it needs. I haven’t finished the coding. The basics-.” He stops as a gust steals his breath. Once it dies down, he continues, “The nanotechnology I based this on, I was able to do all the math so I could conjure it. I don’t have all the abilities interfaced or calculated. Nanotech is a horse of a different color than routine fabrication.”
Steve rounded up the usual suspects of drunk and disorderly including Thor and his brother and locked them up for the night. Thor spent an inordinate amount of time singing in a foreign language while Loki begged him to shut up. Sadly, Steve had to admit he sided with Loki as the hours wore on. Eventually, he scooted them out of the jail and hoped for some peace last night.
He’d ventured down the wrong path, the path toward damnation and everyone in his life will suffer because of it.  He needs to tell Tony to leave, but he can't. He's indebted to him, Doctor Banner is here because of Tony. He steels his resolve and brings his lowered gaze up to meet Tony's eyes. The sorrow and pain etched there tell a different story, a story that Steve cannot fathom. He's seen that look before, he knows that look down deep in the hollow of his bones. It's a part of him, sings out in the night like a terrible phantom, a ghost in his memories to haunt his nights and his days. As he's about to question Tony, another screech of pain splits the air like the crack and flash of a lightning bolt, and Steve glances up to the stairwell and the upper room where the doctor works.
“I get that, had enough of that in my day. But somehow with Tony, you got past that pretty quickly. Pepper and I have been by his side for years now and we – well, we didn’t get there,” Rhodes admits. “Well, until recently.”
The topic change eased Pepper’s tension and he saw her shoulders relax a degree. Pepper answered for Tony. “Yes, probably in his laboratory. The man is a hermit. Do you need him for something?”
“Where are they?” Steve said as he nodded. He got to his feet and thought the room might do a loop but it stayed surprisingly still.
“Wh-why?” Steve says and his throat feels raw like he’s been screaming for days over the sounds of a battle.
He rubs at his eyes. It’s one of his go to mental knots – thinking he’s not worth it. It might be the reason he always went to the extremes. Maybe also part of the reason he agreed on Project Rebirth in the first place. His life detoured from reality a long time ago. When he walked down that long hallway with Peggy towering over him. Yet did he ever think he would have to chance or the ability to shed the fake façade and find someone he desired.
Stopping at the half bath, he washes his hands and then catches sight of himself in the mirror. He hasn’t showered in over a day and his hair style competes for best bed head. He really should take some time for personal hygiene, but when he enters the kitchen, he hears popcorn popping in the microwave and finds Steve kneading dough.
Steve hadn’t been privy to those machinations of the V-Corps. “I wouldn’t doubt it. Their plan wouldn’t be to let the zombies live.”
“It looks fairly close to the truth though,” Maria said. She clutched a tablet in her hand and went directly to Tony. She placed it on the table in front of him and then took a seat to the side and not in the main circle.
The half-smile graces the prince’s face. He narrows his eyes at Steve and points at him. “I think Steve Rogers that there’s more to you than meets the eye.”
Tony’s once pale skin blossoms with color as he gags and chokes. He rolls to his side again and his whole body quakes. He groans and paws at the mud.
Steve thinks about it, about how Tony said something about exclusivity early on, but never brought it up again. “I don’t know. It really hasn’t come up. I’m not trying to push it. I still have like 5 days left including today.” He really should dig for more information on Loki and Thor. Tony needs it especially since the Conclave is desperate for strong allies. “Are Thor and Loki leaving?”
“You’re doing a lot,” Steve said as he stepped away, letting Natasha work. For a second, he thought about it, but he didn’t ruminate on his next action. Instead he stuck out his wrist and showed it to Sam. “You see this?”
“Thanks, Pep.” He grasps her hand for a second, just a slight touch – a connection she knows he needs and allows it. He blows out a heavy breath. “Okay, let’s get this over with.”
“That’s the story I always told you, that your mother told you. But the truth of it is, that the lion still roams.”
“Well, we put a man on the moon with your help, I’m pretty sure we can figure this out,” Tony said, and Howard clapped him on the back.
“We can schedule the pick-up.” Tony examines Blu. “But I need a copter big enough for a large animal.”
“I don’t think that’s going to happen, Tony.” Strange goes to the counter where there’s a computer set up and he starts to type in his password. “Your latest scan shows considerable inflammation in the area. You’re playing with fire. I can’t ethically do this-.”
“I know.” Tony kept tracing Steve's cheekbone with his thumb until Steve looked up at him. “I'm so sorry, Steve.”
“Yeah,” Steve rasped, already sounding a lot happier, and Tony chuckled, grinning when Steve's breath caught as he shifted his legs for better leverage.
Tony almost swallowed his tongue when Steve put a hand to his cheek, his thumb stroking just under his eye.
“I'm –” Steve cut himself off with a grunt and Tony held on for dear life as Steve fucked him so hard that he was shaking the bed. “Tony –“
Steve swallowed past the sudden lump in his throat, his heart pounding as he straddled the doll, sitting right in its lap. He felt a twinge in his oversensitive cock when his thigh made contact with a matching hardness in the doll's pants, his throat suddenly dry.
Steve slipped his hand underneath the waistband to scratch his fingers through his pubic hair before he reached down further, pressing down on the base of his cock. That simple touch alone was enough to make him shiver, and he kept his grip purposely light when he finally wrapped his hand around his cock, just holding it for now.
For a second Tony almost thought he'd misheard him. But when Steve just kept looking at him Tony felt a heavy weight lift off his chest. “Wait, really?”
“Mr. Stark,” Charles said as soon as they approached the table, standing up to shake his hand. “We'd started to wonder if you would ever show up.”
“Hate to spoil your fun but the therapists who work with the Avengers aren't actually employed by –“
.” He barely felt Tony's hand on his arm and the knowledge of how abnormal that was made the tears finally flow over. Tony's grip tightened immediately, and Steve took a shaky breath at the faint pressure. “Hey, it's okay. Look at me.”
When the shrapnel hit, her breasts had taken the worst of the damage, especially the right one where her nipple had been almost completely blown off. The doctors had reconstructed them the best they could, but Toni still bore the scars of captivity, and not all of them were as pretty as the arc reactor.
Steve was probably making noise, but there was a loud buzzing in his ears that made it impossible to tell. His fingers were digging into Tony's shoulders so hard it probably hurt, but Tony's grip on him never wavered, lowering him steadily down onto his massive cock that was – oh,
“Tony,” Steve said a little helplessly and Tony grabbed the bottle from him as he sat up, shoving at Steve’s shoulder.
“You think?” Steve asked, a distinct note of hope in his voice, and Tony grinned, still feeling that simmering curl of arousal low in his stomach.
Tony glanced up as Natasha folded herself into the armchair next to him with the grace of a cat, her eyes twinkling with barely concealed humor. He sighed. “Am I about to get trolled?”
Steve was pretty sure he tore the buttons clean off as he shoved his pants down his legs, just far enough that his cock bounced up against his stomach, and Tony's eyes went dark.
Steve's adam's apple jumped when Tony burrowed his nose into his neck, taking a deep sniff that made his fingers tingle, the same way he remembered from when he first met Steve.
“Good man.” Bucky clapped him on the shoulder. “Now. Wanna see how far I can throw a brick with my new arm?”
“You said,” Tony gasped out through his tears, leaning into Steve's touch when gentle hands wiped the moisture off his cheeks. “I want to suck you. Let me, Steve, please.”
“Wait, Bu-“ Steve stared at his phone as the dial tone rang in his ears, ending the call with a sigh. So much for that.
“There are more Winter Soldiers,” Bucky said curtly and Tony blinked, looking honestly taken off guard for a moment.
"I think I'll shave it anyway. It's a fun change though." Tony made a forlorn noise and Steve laughed, twisting his head for another kiss. "Maybe I'll keep it for a couple more days."
She looked down to see his thighs trembling where he knelt, his hand digging into the skin right beside his cock like he was barely keeping himself from touching. His cock twitched when she looked at it, dark red and so hard that it looked almost painful, the vein on its underside throbbing in time with his heartbeat.
“Oh look, presents.” Tony picked up the basket, holding it tight to his chest. “Those are going right in here.” He opened the drum and poured the tickets in, making sure to drop a few so he could bend over to pick them up. “Ten gift coins for a ticket, boys. Who wants a chance to play with me?”
, his hips rutting forward desperately as he chased the feeling, a boiling pressure building and building in his gut until –
“Not good enough.” Steve turned to watch Natasha walk up to Tony, standing next to him with her arms crossed. “You understand how guilty this makes you look, right? Running away with all these accusations still up in the air –“
“Good day?” Natasha asked, and Tony allowed himself to sink deeper into the couch as Steve moved his arm just enough to grab the back of his neck, holding on without any pressure. It still made Tony's stomach coil with anticipation.
Bucky exchanged a meaningful glance with Clint before he snorted. “Why did you jump straight to kidnapping? Maybe we bought you a giant teddy bear.”
“Alright,” Steve said as he shouldered his way back through the door, a stack of papers in his hands. “I've got your receipt right here, since your alpha has already paid for the treatment. If you don't have any more questions or concerns I'll walk you back to the front desk.”
Tony turned to look at the man approaching him, clocking his military uniform as he gave him a polite smile. “In the flesh. I’m sorry, I don’t think we’ve met?”
“We'll cross that bridge when we get to it,” Steve said cryptically, and Tony bit down on his lips, a happy glow lighting up in his chest because he wouldn't be opposed to that. Wow, when did that happen? “Anyway, what are you doing? Any plans for tonight?”
“Okay.” Steve turned away from the door, wrapping his free arm around his waist. “I can’t believe you did this.”
“I've wanted to ask you for a long time,” Steve said quickly, like he needed to explain himself. “I thought it – well, before Clint said... what he said. I never thought you would be... interested,” Steve said carefully, looking at her from under his eyelashes and – ah, shit.
through him, zinging through his body and gathering low in his gut. He was quickly getting wet, his cock a firm line against his thigh, and Steve could probably smell it by now, his eyes dark when he looked up at Tony, still licking at his leaking nipple.
A meeting with Mr. Stark as the Avengers' representative will be arranged shortly. In the meantime please update us on any and all findings.
“You look beautiful,” Steve said, his voice weirdly quiet and subdued as though he wasn't sure if he should even say it.
“He is not your bond mate,” Ignacio said, a frown marring his otherwise flawless face. “You have laid no claim on him.”
“Well done, Mr. Stark,” Steve said from what sounded like miles away as Tony tried to find his way back to himself after his soul had clearly left his body for a few moments. “You'll be feeling fatigue, perhaps a bit of soreness, but that's nothing out of the ordinary. Just relax and let your body recover from the paroxysm.”
Steve shuddered so hard that the motion shook through Tony's back before Steve's first thrust knocked him flat on the bed. He didn't manage to get his bearings before Steve did it again, pushing Tony down until Steve was pinning him with his entire body weight, pressing him into the mattress. Tony grunted at the sudden friction on his cock.
Steve blinked, suddenly realizing that Mr. Stark was looking at him expectantly. "Uh, sorry. What was that?"
Steve's erection had waned a little on their way down here, but that thought brought it back with a vengeance, making him ache in the best kind of way. “Oh fuck. Please.”
“It wasn't hard to guess.” Tony sat up a little straighter, inclining his head. “For what it's worth, I am incredibly sorry for your loss.”
Tony stepped forward, pulling off his shirt with a small smirk. “We should go at the same time, right? Make the most of it?”
“Ding ding ding ding!” Bucky said as he mimed ringing a bell. “You wanna go home, you have to play Ross' game. And that terrifies you.”
“You're about to be even fuller,” Tony mumbled, but he still took his time stretching Steve out until he could barely feel the strain anymore, his muscles pleasantly loose and relaxed. Steve took a shuddering breath when Tony pulled his fingers out and grabbed his hips with both hands to lift him higher, shuffling his legs until Steve could feel the head of Tony's cock sliding against his ass.
Steve blanched. “You can't be seri–” He broke off when the plant suddenly hoisted Tony's arms further up, enough to force his spine into a backwards bend and put his tan chest on display. “Jesus Christ.”
“No idea. Probably not eggs. More like seeds.” Tony grabbed for Steve's arms, patting them weakly. “Help me up?”
“The usual stuff. It doesn’t matter.” Tony shook his head, closing his eyes for a moment before he looked up at Steve. “I’m sorry for being a dick. You didn’t deserve that.”
– bringing them skin to skin. Steve’s cock was so hard already, a hot red line against Tony’s stomach, and Tony couldn’t resist getting his hand around it, squeezing down just to hear Steve gasp.
"Yeah, I got him," Tony answered for Steve and the woman nodded one more time before she said something in Wakandan and walked back inside the jet. It took off barely a minute later and they both watched it go, Tony still perched on Steve's hips.
Steve's breathing slowly evened out as they lay together, his hands tracing circles into Tony's back. Tony had his eyes closed, just enjoying the feeling of Steve's body against his as he drifted dangerously close to sleep. Fuck, he felt like he hadn't slept properly since Steve left.
Steve moaned, grabbing Tony around the waist as they kissed desperately, clutching at each other as if they might up and disappear at any moment. Tony's tongue was in Steve's mouth, but despite the heat building between them it didn't quite tip into lust, more like he was proclaiming a sense of belonging. Steve's hands clenched on his waist, shaking so hard Tony could feel it as their kiss slowly gentled into something more calm, more settled.
The vibration stopped, and Tony huffed a sigh of relief as he let himself melt into the table, losing all strength in his limbs. Holy shit.
“If I can't go over it with a black light without uncovering a Jackson Pollock I will castrate both of you.”
“If you're serious,” Tony said quietly, his voice barely more than a rumble that made the hair on the back of Steve's neck stand on end. “Then touch me.”
“Tony Stark, manufacturer of Beyond Toys,” the man said with a wink, giving Steve an amused smile. “The dolls were my idea. Couldn't resist immortalizing myself in one of them once I figured out that I could. Not a design that we'll put into mass production, but we had this one lying around, might as well test it. I guess you were the lucky draw.”
Steve gulped, his fingers curling as they hesitated on their path down to where they ached to touch...
“You're used to drinking human blood.” When Tony just looked at him incredulously Steve nodded towards the fridge in the corner. “I can smell it.”
Steve made a small noise and Tony didn't even protest when Steve stopped thrusting to hold him close. He sank into the hug, laying his head on Steve's shoulder as they both breathed each other in, his eyes prickling with tears.
T'Challa blinked and Tony felt a hint of satisfaction at catching him off guard. “Well,” the prince said. “Perhaps you are a better man than I thought.”
“Calm down, the trial hasn't even started,” Tony said absentmindedly, typing out his most recent email to Ross with a little more force than necessary. “He's gonna be on my ass all day if I don't –“
“I –“ Tony jolted, the next hit taking him by surprise so much that he almost lost his balance, but Steve held him tight. “Ah, thirteen! Oh fuck, please –”
“Thank you,” Steve said quietly as she handed him the letter back. He marveled at the sleek design of the elevator on his way up, feeling severely underdressed in light of all the other people he could see hurrying in and out, all of them dressed in bespoke suits. Steve just wanted to go home.
Steve couldn't help it. It bubbled up inside him like a tidal wave until he broke down laughing, holding a hand in front of his mouth until he realized it was pointless and he just flung his head back and laughed and laughed until his stomach hurt.
“So the reason you haven't been to one of those meetings is because no human ever wanted to go with you?”
Tony let Steve keep it chaste for a while, close-mouthed kisses that made their lips slide together and pull apart like a tease of what was to come, and Tony could feel that familiar tingle of anticipation zing down his spine. The drag of skin on skin made Tony's mouth tingle, their lips sticking together just a little until Steve's tongue darted out and made the glide smooth again.
“It’s a good compromise.” Tony leaned into Steve, grinning when he felt Steve’s lips against his temple. “At least it’ll keep you busy. Can’t risk you getting bored.”
Tony meant to say no, he really did, but he was encased in armor, still riding the adrenaline high of a successful mission, and maybe feeling just a little bit reckless. Which was how he found himself sitting at a restaurant table across from Steve and questioning his entire life’s choices.
“That’s good,” Steve said hoarsely as he watched the muscles in Tony’s ass contract when he clenched down, his throat suddenly dry. He only looked up when he heard Tony chuckle.
Tony thought back to the times when Steve was in DC, to those lonely nights when he'd looked at pictures of him and Steve and wished – “A couple times. Never when you were with me in the building though.”
There was a soft, glowing warmth in his chest that spread with every gentle touch of Steve's lips on his, and Tony couldn't get enough of it. He shifted a little closer, smiling into the kiss when he felt Steve's hands sliding down to his tailbone before they hooked under his ass and pulled him flush against Steve's crotch.
Tony smiled, his limbs still pleasantly sore in the afterglow as he reached up to put his hands on Steve's chest. “Just that? Nothing dirty?”
A part of Steve couldn't believed he'd just asked that, but Tony's shoulders shook with laughter as he lowered his head.
Steve looked around, his eyes catching on the way Natasha was leaning onto the table, her legs crossed and cleavage on full display as she hung on to Vision's every word. Which, as far as Steve could tell, were highly complicated ways of complimenting Bruce's skin and hands and – character? Whatever 'solivagant nature' was supposed to mean.
He took a deep breath that emerged as a satisfied sigh as he sunk into the sheets, pressing his forehead into Steve's chest when he pulled Tony on top of him, wrapping him up in his arms. Tony twitched when Steve squeezed him, groaning when the motion put pressure on his oversensitive cock.
Tony arched off the bed, slamming his hands down to clutch at the sheets, needing something to hold on to as pleasure
“I know. SHIELD fucked all of us over.” Tony grabbed his fork, twirling it in his hand. “And I know it's hard to trust an organization when you don't know the people behind it, but I've done my research. I approve of eighty-three percent of the current UN board members.”
Steve did, feeling like a complete and utter failure, but Tony gave him a gentle smile, not even a hint of tension in it, and grabbed both of his hands.
He ushered Bucky off stage as the sounds of camera shutters faded behind the closed doors. Pepper was on them immediately.
Toni waved him off. “Nonsense. You guys rake in probably a third of the cash we raise. If anything I should be thanking
“Something we have in common then,” Toni said, pretending that she couldn't feel Steve's eyes boring into the side of her face. “Still. I don't do that anymore. I'm too old for that kind of shit.”
“Thank you.” The honest relief in her voice made Tony's stomach twist with guilt. “Anything else I can do for you today?”
Steve breathed in heavily and Tony rubbed a slow circle into his back. Then kept going when Steve didn't stop him.
And then Tony came, screaming wordlessly as the plant milked him mercilessly, stroking his cock until he was a shivering, babbling mess, and Steve –
The comments were blowing up with excitement, and Tony took his time crawling towards the camera, sitting down and leaning back on his arms to best showcase the harness he was still wearing.
He could really feel it now, the tight pull of his heat that was twisting his stomach until it burned like fire, gathering at the base of his cock and building up pressure in his balls. His fingers were clenching uncontrollably in Steve's hair, but Steve didn't seem to mind, judging by the deep groan he muffled against Tony's skin, making him shiver.
“You get it, right?” Tony asked again, his tone sending shivers down Steve's spine. “Like this I wouldn't even have to pretend I'm not touching you in the backseat. Or under the table. Or in the restroom.”
“I'll fill in for you,” she said with a knowing twinkle in her eyes that Toni wasn't sure she appreciated. “Bring us some drinks while you're gone.”
“What do you think?” Tony groaned when Steve started fucking the fleshlight again, and Steve watched as he reached down to pump his cock, hips twitching in that way that told Steve he was getting close. “Fuck, come on. Almost there.”
“Well.” Steve glanced back inside the stall, nodding at the clean floor. “Good thing your come's invisible t– hey!”
In your first draft you recommended Natasha Romanoff as the Avengers' ambassador. In this finalized version you changed it to Anthony Stark.
He was aware of the hush that had fallen over the room as Charles gestured at the two empty chairs on his right. Tony sat down, purposely relaxing into the chair as to not let on how nervous he was. Luckily he didn't have a heartbeat to give him away anymore. “Nice place you got here.”
“If it does not deviate from his biological clock Captain Rogers' next rut will commence exactly twenty-three days from now, Sir.”
it,” Steve said, not in the least bit mocking, and something uneasy in Tony's chest uncoiled. "It's just... Doesn't this kind of defeat the purpose of me not being in the field?"
He knew in that moment that he loved him, that he wanted to be with him in every way, and to his surprise he still didn’t manage to say it first. So Tony retaliated by asking Steve to move in with him, not surprised when Steve took him up on it with an enthusiastic yes.
“I'm not used to it, okay? Back in my day the best you could hope for was a quick fuck in a back alley behind the local bar, and we couldn't – I mean, it wasn't –“ He swallowed hard, his hands clenching into fists. “I know it's okay now, but back then... I mean...”
“Wher'y goin'?” Steve mumbled, and Tony shushed him with a gentle kiss across Steve's brow that made the tiny lines there smooth out.
"Excellent." Mr. Stark abruptly got out of his chair, gesturing towards the door with a charming grin. "We'll continue this another time then. My assistant will call you about that interview.”
“Do you want to see the set?” Tony asked, gesturing further into the studio, and Steve seemed to blink back to life, sucking in a breath as his eyes darted around the room.
So the solution was simple. Stop sleeping with alphas and don’t dwell on what he was missing. It was a perfectly logical plan.
“No,” Tony said firmly, hugging Steve tighter as he grimaced, rubbing his face against Steve's shoulder. “No. I refuse to be a fucking feedback loop of sadness. Just no.”
“I've never liked Say Yes To The Dress. And anyone who does is a mouth-breathing idiot who's clearly never seen a good show in their lives.”
Steve rutted up against the fake tissue, biting down on a groan at the friction. His cock was still wet enough with spit that the glide felt smooth, and moving closer pushed his cock up until it was squished firmly between his stomach and the doll’s hip, rubbing up and down in the tight space. He was breathing heavily, his hands trembling when he wrapped his arms around the doll and pushed himself up until he had enough leverage to really hump its hip, the hot slide of it making his toes curl.
For a second Steve felt relieved. Then he felt guilty. “No, it’s – fuck.” He rubbed a hand across his eyes. “No, I’ll do it. I just –“
need backup. And if they could save the others from being thrown into prison like this – “Fine. If everyone agrees to your terms I won't stand in the way of things.”
Steve sucked in a breath through his nose as he swallowed Tony deeper, probably to get him to shut up. Tony smirked.
“You know, you're involved in a lot of these 'crazy stories',” Tony said once they both stopped laughing after a retelling of how Bucky and Clint had lost the keys to Clint's apartment while bar-hopping and tried to break into their own home. Unfortunately they'd picked the wrong window and almost gotten arrested. “Sounds like your life is a lot more interesting than you make it out to be.”
And if the next morning he missed several meetings trying unsuccessfully to get Steve to let him leave the bed, well. Tony didn't have any complaints.
Hello, everyone! (does anyone else hear Peter's voice in their head when they read that sentence or is it just me?) Anyway, hope you have a great day and that you enjoy this chapter!
Steve stared at him for a second longer before he huffed a laugh and shook his head. “You know, if you weren't so goddamn competent in everything you do I'd call bullshit.”
Tony looked around the room, noting that there was a giant, lush bed and a table filled with water and chocolate for some reason. “Come on. Let's get you horizontal.”
“Of course I would. But I don't think you're fucking any pastries to get off, so how would I know.” Steve's surprised snort broke the tension a little, which was exactly what Tony wanted. “I don't really know what to tell you. It feels good, obviously. Better when it's still warm.”
“So,” Tony said when they were finally seated on the couch. “Here we are. Can I get you anything? A drink maybe?”
Tony was pretty sure that he wasn’t supposed to know this. If anything Steve went out of his way not to show it in front of anyone, and Tony probably wouldn’t have noticed it either if he and Steve weren’t… well. Fucking.
Before Steve could retort Tony pushed another finger in alongside the first, barely giving Steve a moment to adjust before he crooked them upwards and –
“Holy fuck,” Steve gasped and Tony laughed breathlessly, the movement making his ass flex around the tube and oh god, why was that so hot –
“No!” Tony yelped, jerking forward to stop him – and groaning when the motion made him grind against the vibrating metal again, his cock sliding along its warm surface. His entire groin felt rubbed raw, sensitive and throbbing and – fuck, he didn't know if he could stand it. But he didn't want it to stop. “I'm still –“
Steve rolled his eyes, pushing Clint off him so he could be a protective wall between his friends. “Stop that. We’re watching Top Gun and that’s final.”
“You were in full rut, practically foaming at the mouth, and the first thing you did when you saw me was hand me your jacket because you thought I was cold.” Tony smiled. “You won’t hurt me, Steve.”
It came out a lot more breathless than he’d meant it to, but Tony didn’t even blink, his eyes twinkling with mirth.
,” Toni whined, grabbing a pillow to hug to her chest. “Have you seen him? He's like, eternally young and shit. And even if I could, he's not gonna want an elderly woman.”
Tony groaned, bracing his shoulders on the mattress so he could raise his hips and make room for Steve who immediately took him up on the silent invitation. Steve made quick work of what little clothes they were wearing before he laid down on top of him, the friction of their cocks sliding together drawing twin moans from both of them.
He heard a soft inhale before there was a gentle pressure at his temple, and Steve's voice made his lips twitch into a smile.
Wanda turned to Bucky and, cool as a cucumber, said, “Your hair is stupid and those shirts make you look like a hobo.”
He looked down at his cock as his hand slid over it, his fingers overlapping at the tip, and – and –
They talked well into the night, and by the time Steve hung up Tony had almost forgotten about what Steve had said earlier. It only came back to him as he was rifling through the fridge and saw a piece of half-eaten pastry that he'd left there after lunch. There was no way that it was big enough for him use in any way, but after a moment's hesitation Tony shrugged and grabbed it anyway, placing it on the counter so it could warm up to room temperature.
Sorry for not uploading yesterday, I'm moving right now, so real life has been very busy. My upload schedule might be inconsistent over the next couple of days but don't worry, I'm fine :) I just have other stuff going on. Thank you so much for reading and I hope you enjoy this one!
“You are the hottest fucking thing,” Tony panted against his lips and Steve moaned, pressing his forehead into Tony’s shoulder as he hoisted his hips higher.
“I'm gonna fuck you again.” Steve's hot breath along with the words sent shivers down Tony's spine, his cock jerking in Steve's hand. “Do you want to come now? Or do you want to hold out?”
“Maybe you can show me?” Tony asked gently and Steve let out a heavy breath when Tony let go of his hands and sat back on his heels. “Just – you know. So I have a ballpark of what kind of pressure you need.”
“Tony,” Steve whined, and Tony's throat went dry when Steve's hips hitched forward into nothing, humping the air like he couldn't help it. “Oh, fuck – oh, it's so –“
There was a moment where they just stared at each other, the air crackling with potential, before Steve looked down at his hand and took a deep breath. Tony was warm, his chest rising and falling in a soothing rhythm that made Steve's palm follow the course of his breathing. Underneath that he could feel the pounding of Tony's heart, strong and steady and – Steve gulped.
“I think it's cooled off enough. What do you think?” Tony raised an eyebrow, and Steve scowled. “What? You're the expert.”
But Steve would feel even better in the afterglow. And besides, Tony's cock was starting to complain about the lack of action, and he wasn't above being a little selfish here.
"Take your time." Yeah, Steve was definitely laughing at him now, and Tony couldn't even fault him for it. "If it really bothers you I can shave it off ri-"
He flinched, his heart pounding with adrenaline when Tony groaned loudly, but the sound cut off abruptly as Tony's thighs stiffened on either side of Steve's hips. Shit.
“No, no. It was this actually.” Bruce held up a small vial filled with a blueish liquid. “We've been working on a solution to help with stealth operations. It works, obviously, but we haven't figured out a way to instantly reverse the effect. Tony broke one of the vials.”
Natasha smiled as Clint walked over to stand next to her, followed almost directly by Wanda. Sam hesitated for a moment but after a quick nod from Steve he joined them too. Tony cocked his head at Scott who was still standing at Steve's side.
Tony sniffed. “One, I never said that. And two, you can't show me your scrapbook of G-rated fantasies and not expect me to make a comment, okay? I'm a simple man.”
"Boo," Tony said and Steve shook his head with a laugh, wrapping an arm around Tony’s waist to pull him in and press a kiss to his cheek.
“Mhm,” Tony hummed, his cheek rubbing against Steve's as he leaned into a proper kiss. With his eyes closed it felt exactly the same as normal. What wasn't normal was the hand he could feel slipping down the back of his pants to grab his ass.
But the arc had also taken things from him that he hadn’t even known he would miss until they were gone. Things that he’d always taken for granted. Rarely every thought about really.
“Okay. Yeah, I get that.” Bucky tapped his spoon against the side of the bowl. “So what are you going to do?”
Tony glanced over at the stool, broad enough that it might just be able to hold both of them with the pie in the middle. Steve followed his gaze, his eyes narrowing in thought before he nodded.
Instead he gave himself a push and walked towards the meeting room, knocking on the door. A quiet “Come in” prompted him to open it and step inside, giving his interviewer a hopefully charming smile –
"No." Bucky's eyes flared but Tony didn't stand down, crossing his arms over his chest. "I want to talk."
“Oh god. I'm sorry, I didn't – I mean, I know I'm a client and you were obligated to do this, I – shit.” Steve rubbed a hand through his hair, looking seriously distressed. “Oh god, I'm such a creep, I'm sorry, Dave, I'll –“
Steve shrugged, and Tony could see his lips twitching as he suppressed a smile. “Have to balance out the superhero life somehow, right?”
Steve laughed while Tony tore at his clothes, cursing under his breath as he fumbled with the buttons. “Calm down, Tony, we have all the time in the –
In the case that the Avengers fail to retrieve the aforementioned individuals in the given time frame the UN will be forced to issue an arrest warrant and hand the case over to the authorities. In light of the threat assessment that the UN has placed on James Buchanan Barnes this warrant will include orders to shoot on sight.
“Steve?” he asked, and the arms around him tightened as he felt a shuddering breath against his neck. “Hey, what's wrong?”
“Hey,” Tony croaked out, and Steve looked up at him with slightly wet eyes, crinkling at the corners.
“Sure you are,” Bucky sighed, leaning back against the couch as he took a sip from his beer. “Aren’t we all?”
“You guys are so mean,” he whined, but obediently brought the paddle down with more force this time. “Ah! Ow. My ass is gonna be so sore after this. Do you think I can make it stay red?”
New format, yay! Sorry, but I couldn't figure out how to make it look good on a phone screen, so you might have to turn off Creator's style if you're reading this on your phone. It'll still look weird but at least it'll be readable.
He didn't know how long they stayed like that, with Steve pressed against Tony's chest as he slowly but surely calmed down, but he knew that he never wanted it to end. Tony had started rubbing circles into the back of his neck with pointed fingers so even Steve could feel it, and it was so soothing that Steve couldn't help but relax into his touch, putting his worries on the back burner for the moment.
“I think I'll take my chances,” Tony said roughly, and Steve squeezed his cock hard enough to make him gasp, hips thrusting up involuntarily.
If any of the Avengers should have additional information on this matter please report back to me immediately. Find Nomad's case file and other details in the document attached.
Tony thought as he laid back down, rolling onto his side when Steve's arms automatically came up to pull him close. Now he could only wait.
, Pep,” Tony said, dipping his can-cheese nachos in garlic powder. “And it doesn't fit my aesthetic. We've talked about this.”
“You drew all of these?” Tony asked incredulously, looking up at Steve with an indiscernible look in his eyes. “Why?”
"Yes, dear?" Steve asked sweetly, and Tony huffed, grabbing Steve's hair with both hands to tug on it in reprimand.
“I can't fucking believe this,” he mumbled under his breath as he took another step forward, carefully slow this time. The plant seemed to bristle in response, wrapping its tendrils even tighter around Tony in a possessive hold.
“Be gentle,” she warned him, and he nodded, his lower lip caught between his teeth as he touched her again, trailing the tips of his fingers over her pussy. Toni spread her legs wider, touching the back of his hand to guide it a little further down. “Feel that? You can push right in there if you want. One finger.”
a choice,” Steve said with an edge in his tone. “We could've just as easily taken a united stand against the Accords!“
He gave another thrust against Tony, both of them still wearing their pants, and Tony couldn't hold back a laugh.
Tony chuckled, leaning his head against Steve's chest, and Steve flushed with pride at the show of trust when Tony said, “Alright. You're the boss.”
.” Steve squeezed his eyes shut, his hips jerking as his cock throbbed so hard that Tony could see it. “I
Bucky's lips twisted into a frown for a split second before his face smoothed out again. “I know what I have done. And I wouldn't be sitting here if there was even the slightest chance of me going down that path again. You have my word on that.”
“I think you do, Mr. Stark.” The general's face had lost all traces of friendliness now, his eyes cold and calculating. “You may believe yourself to be above the law, but I assure you, in the end justice always catches up to those trying to evade it.”
Steve's head snapped up and he felt his skin tingle with heat when he saw Tony wearing that exact same smile, carefree and radiant. He took a deep breath as he brought his hands up to Tony's waist, squeezing him gently.
Steve took a shuddering breath, his hand clenching around the fleshlight as he slowly pulled out. His cock was so hard it almost hurt, the head almost absurdly red against the pale flesh color of the toy. “I don’t think I’ll last long.”
“I do,” he said, the look in his eyes making Tony's heart sing. Then he frowned. “That's not permission for you to keep being reckless in combat.”
He only hoped that the plant would keep its promise in the end. Which was a sentence he never thought he would think.
“Oh,” she gasped, rocking up against his mouth while holding him still with the firm grip on his hair, grinding her pussy into his face as his tongue kept sliding wetly across her skin, curling and slipping in all the right places –
“Right here.” Steve grabbed the tiny jar before he led Tony to their bedroom and laid him out on the bed, kneeling at his side. Tony buried his face in his arms, moaning at the first touch of Steve's cool fingers on his ass. The salve was a home-brew that Bruce had originally developed as a medical aid for Avengers business, but since Tony had found out how well it worked for this kind of play both he and Steve always stowed a little extra in their bathrooms, for situations just as this.
“Your wish is my command, Assmaster,” Tony said with a wink at the camera before he brought the paddle down on his right cheek, making sure that it gave an audible slap. “Ah, one.” He spanked the other cheek, arching his back so he could reach it comfortably. “Two!”
Thank you again for your visit. I hope that you enjoyed our hospitality as much as we enjoyed your company.
“I came so fucking hard,” Steve said, his words seemingly catching up to him a moment later because the tips of his ears went bright red as he stiffened. “Um.”
"Okay." Tony took a step further into the room, keeping himself between Bucky and the door. The gesture didn't go unnoticed if the narrowing of Bucky's eyes was anything to go by. "I know this seems bad. But if you leave now it won't make anything better."
Steve stopped short, cursing internally at the whine of repulsors only seconds before Tony landed in front of them with a loud crack. Bucky winced.
“Has he been cleared for that by someone other than an Avengers therapist?” someone shouted and Tony forced a smile.
Hey ho, everyone! We're steadily getting closer to the end. I'm excited for the big reveal, let's see how it goes ;) Thanks for reading and I hope you enjoy it!
“Go for it,” he gasped, and Steve tugged his panties to the side, wrapping his hand around Tony's cock and stroking it once –
Tiny, padded cells and straitjackets aren't the worst of it though. Our sources inform us that this prison – referred to by inside workers as “The Raft” – is located several miles off the coast of any accessible land or island. Meaning that it falls under no government's jurisdiction and was supposedly meant to operate strictly under its own rules and regulations. We shudder to think of what kind of fate might have befallen those unlucky enough to be imprisoned there.
“Mmh, I like the sound of that,” Tony said, his words vibrating against Steve's lips. “Gotta say, I like boyfriends even more though. How about you?”
Steve got with the program blessedly quickly, hoisting him up into his arms as they kept kissing, the feeling of long hair between his fingers dragging a deep groan from Tony. He ground down against Steve with what little leverage he had, grinning when Steve moaned quietly in response, gripping Tony's thighs even tighter. Tony couldn't stop touching the beard, and Steve's breathing hitched every time he scratched his fingers through it which - fuck, why weren't they naked already?
Steve said and Tony gave up all pretenses, mashing their lips together with no intent of stopping anytime soon. He had no idea how Steve got them inside but he must’ve managed it somehow because before he knew it Steve was setting him down on a hard surface, fingers tangling in his shirt as he –
“Be nice,” she hissed, so quietly that Steve wasn't sure if he was supposed to hear it, before she hurried out of the room. The door fell shut with an ominous clang, and Steve turned back towards Mr. Stark, trying to keep his nerves off his face as their eyes met.
It is doooone! I'm so happy, but a little sad at the same time. Despite the hiccup near the end there I had an absolute blast writing this fic and I'm so glad to see that a lot of you are still here. Thank you so so so much for all of the comments and kudos, they're what motivated me to keep writing.
So, since the other chapter was so short I thought I'd post this one right along with it. Thanks for reading and I hope you enjoy it <3
“Look at me,” Tony coaxed gently, and Steve shook his head, panting so loudly that it was jostling his cock inside Tony.
“So you want to – what. Take a ride on the Stark train? Get the VIP experience?” She didn't know where the sudden anger came from, but it hurt unexpectedly to have Steve proposition her for sex like this when – when – fuck, she didn't even know. “Well guess what, dickwad, I'm not –“
But he hadn't found the right people to fund his private projects yet, so until then he had to rely on his stream money and the generous donations from people who wanted to fuck him. Honestly, it was getting a little tiring.
“I'm going to want you again later,” Steve mumbled, sounding utterly fucked out, but when he looked up at Tony there was a burning desire there, like the beast inside Steve was only resting for the moment, ready to pounce the first chance it got. Tony hummed, hiding his smile as he buried his face in Steve's chest.
“Poked them,” Tony said unrepentantly. “Anyway, can we talk about that after you get me down from here, please?”
“I want to,” Steve said, trying to catch his eyes, and Tony wanted to tell him not to touch, that it was inappropriate –
“Yeah.” Steve pulled away, looking at his hand, then down at his cock with a grimace. “We need a shower.”
He choked on his protest when Steve fucked into the pie hard enough to move it along Tony's cock, shoving it even deeper inside. The top layer was already a crumbly mess, but the slick glide of his cock head along the bottom crust still felt amazing, and Tony couldn't help the way his hips kicked forward, meeting Steve's thrust with his own.
“And no matter what happens with the... with everything.” Tony felt the pit that had made its home at the bottom of his stomach start to gape open, his heart picking up speed. “That won't change. I love you no matter what. Okay?”
“I'd like to say I've never gotten that desperate, but it pays really well, so...” He shrugged, and Tony found that he didn't even have to force the chuckle that bubbled up in his throat.
Steve swallowed hard, settling back down in his chair, his cock rubbing against the fabric. He wanted to touch himself, relieve some of the pressure, but – that wouldn't be right. Would it?
“Thanks for saying that, Groggy, I'm glad you're enjoying the stream,” he said, smirking when he read the next one. “My ass
“He's been subscribed to you for almost three years.” Ah, so Pep was already doing the background check. Nice. “Never donated until now though. He didn't have a premium subscription before today.”
“I can take care of it,” Tony ground out, but Steve tilted his head up with a firm grip on his neck as he slid off the bed and onto his knees in front of Tony.
"Do it again. Please." Even he could hear the desperation in his voice, and Steve clearly picked up on it because he stared at Tony for a long moment before he grabbed his cock and guided it back towards his mouth. Instead of swallowing it down he tapped it against his chin, letting the glans catch on the hair framing his upper lip. Tony's vision whited out for a second.
“You're going to regret this,” Toni said, not sure if she way speaking to him or herself, but Steve's face lit up with a brilliant smile as he grabbed her hand and lifted it up to his mouth, pressing a kiss to her knuckles.
Obie seemed to misinterpret his relief as something else because he chuckled, patting Tony's arm. “That's my boy. Don't worry, we'll find you a nice alpha. You'll see.”
“I know I don't deserve – I don't have the right to ask anything of you. It's probably selfish of me to tell you how I feel now, but I can't let you stand there and tell me that my feelings for you aren't real. They are and they have been for the past five years.”
Steve's cheeks went a little red, but Toni blamed that on the alcohol. “Yeah. It's a great party, Toni. Thanks for inviting us.”
“Failed experiment. Well, I say failed, but really it just had an unexpected outcome.” He showed Steve the silicone, sticking a finger in – oh, it was hollow. It barely took a second for Steve to connect the dots as he looked at what Tony had brought out, and he felt his cheeks heat so fast that he had to be bright red in the face.
“Well, I've been working on a tranquilizer that – what, not a fan of drugs? That's cool. We could have a monitoring system, y'know, JARVIS and medical on standby.” Tony shrugged. “Or I could just tie you down and have my way with you. Take it out of your hands.”
Tony snorted. “Red light, yellow light. I remember the lecture.” Steve felt an arm wrap around his waist. “Lucky for me, this is my boyfriend we're talking about here. We do way worse on a daily basis.”
Thank you so much to everyone who reached out to me, it means a lot that you wanted to make sure I was okay. I AM okay, just struggling with some things that are taking up a lot of my time and mental capacities. I hope you guys are doing okay and that you're getting through these times a little better than I am!
Tony sighed, shuffling his feet as Clint took an unnecessarily loud bite of his apple. “We do. I've just never stayed the night.”
“See? Totally soundproof. I oversaw all of the construction. As long as we're in here no one can hear us.”
It wasn't that Toni gave much of a shit about how old she was, usually. Sure, she'd thought she wouldn't even make it to twenty-five at some point, and yeah, imagining the number 50 attached to her face in the tabloids made her want to punch something. But she was fit and healthy in all the ways that counted, so it wasn't like she was worried about getting old. Much.
“Okay?” Steve asked with feigned confusion, stepping out to make space for the officer who poked his head into the stall before crouching down to look through the gap connecting it to the other stalls.
Tony raised an eyebrow at Clint who looked at him as if Tony was a complete moron. Which, coming from Clint, was less than flattering.
“No,” Steve said simply, lining himself up and pushing in with one smooth slide. “Is – god, Tony, please say this is okay, please –“
“Not so hard. Keep it – yeah,” she sighed when he gentled his grip, his slick fingers sliding easily over her clit in a mimicry of what she'd done earlier. “Yeah, that's good.”
Tony hooked an arm over his shoulders to pull him closer, licking a line up the tendon on the side of his neck, and Steve's hips stuttered, his breath hitching as Tony found that spot right in the hollow of his throat that sent spikes of pure pleasure directly to his cock.
“Tony.” He couldn't look up at Steve, shame still curdling like something sour in his gut, but Steve wouldn't judge him, he knew that. It was just –
Tony shoved the nachos in his mouth. “I'll find someone else. Hell, I'll pull up grindr right now –“
“Yeah,” Steve said weakly, and Tony nuzzled the side of his neck, pressing a kiss just under his jaw.
Tony sighed, rolling his eyes at the ceiling. “It's like a conglomerate of all New York vampires. They want me to join their secret boy band.”
He was shivering when it finally abated, slowly, like someone was gently rocking him to sleep. The tension rushed out of his muscles like his body was made of water as he dropped forward against Tony's chest, his cock somehow still pulsing between them. He felt like someone was holding his balls in a vice grip and squeezing them over and over again, prolonging his pleasure as he came and came and came until he had no idea how there was still anything left in him to give –
“Go team,” Steve said dryly and Tony laughed, pressing a kiss to his collarbone. His chest thrummed with warmth when Steve kissed the top of his head in turn, lingering for a good few seconds. “You smell really good.”
“Yeah.” Steve's chest expanded with a sigh, the arm still wrapped around Tony suddenly tense. "So when are they picking me up?"
overcome him, love and joy and relief all tangled up into one messy gut punch that made him bite back a sob even as his cock throbbed for release.
“Yeah?” Toni couldn't have kept the sappy smile of her face if she'd tried. “Well, you're a winner, baby. Congratulations.”
“Still got a couple years in me, platypus. As for you, don't think I didn't notice the grey hairs. You should do something about that.”
“Just wanted to see what was keeping you,” Tony mumbled, and Steve turned in his arms, taking a moment to look at the slight frown of concern on Tony's face before he smoothed it out with his thumbs.
“Sorry,” Steve moaned, tumbling them gracelessly onto their sides with his cock still buried deep inside him, keeping his hips pressed tightly against Tony's ass. Tony shuffled a little to get comfortable, chuckling at the feeling of Steve's nose nudging his scent gland.
Steve didn't make much noise, but Tony could still feel the wet spots on his shoulder where Steve let his tears fall, his heart twinging with every hitch of Steve's breath. He hated feeling so helpless, but all he could do was keep rubbing soothing circles into Steve's back and hope that Steve would tell him what was wrong so he could fix it.
Tony signed off, putting his phone down next to him as he ignored Pepper's eyes boring into the side of his face.
Steve pulled down his shirt to hopefully hide the bulge as he hurried from the car, just slowly enough that Tony could keep pace without pulling his shirt tight. He made a beeline for the closest restroom, which was blessedly empty, and grabbed Tony around the waist to pull him into the last stall and lock the door with a decisive click.
Tony thought about it for a second before he shrugged. “I like a lot of filling, I guess. That's always the best part to fuck into.”
Steve raised his head with enormous effort to meet Tony's eyes and the warm acceptance there made his skin prickle with relief.
“Just – lay it out for me. No holds barred.” Tony spread his arms. “What can I do to make them better? I'd like to hear your opinion.”
Steve’s hair felt like silk between his fingers as he twined it around his fingers, scratching Steve’s scalp when his lips caught on all the right spots. He could feel Steve’s moan more than he heard it and Tony forced his eyes open to watch as Steve took him even deeper, his tongue gliding just under the head.
Steve didn't rut during the two weeks they spent in the cabin. It wasn't a slight against Tony's ego exactly, but in some ways it confirmed the underlying fear that he'd harbored since the moment he decided to screw common sense and give Steve and him a chance.
Tony nodded. "Those are acceptable terms." He ran his fingers along Steve's jawline, smirking when it made Steve shiver. "I reserve the right to sit on it ninety percent of that time."
- Tony sends Steve a dick pic on accident and what starts as slightly uncomfortable attempts at texting soon turns into a friendship that leads to a relationship
They both looked up at Steve who was leaning in the doorway, his arms crossed over his chest in a way that made his shirt pull taut across his shoulders. Tony had long since stopped believing that it wasn't deliberate.
It was weird. He shouldn't enjoy the knowledge that this being that could probably seduce anyone if it wanted to, chose to approach
When Tony was satisfied with the minimal space he'd left between the two sheets he moved over to the right and cranked the second vice, evening out the lopsided pressure. Steve had to take several deep breaths to keep calm as the sheets squeezed his cock in between, only protected by the thin layer of silicone that felt soft and slippery and
, Pep,” Toni lamented, dropping back onto her bed with all of her limbs splayed out. “He's twenty-eight, for fuck's sake. How the hell can I fuck someone in their twenties? It's wrong on so many levels!”
“You're the best, Pep.” He kissed her on the cheek before he grabbed his wallet and stepped out into the glorified foyer of their tiny studio. It was mostly just a table and a couch, but Pepper had dressed it up to make the room look almost professional. Tony didn't know how she did it.
“Green doesn't look good on you, Barnes,” Tony said haughtily and Bucky flipped him off. “Also, just for the record, Ross was not tracking my phone. I triple checked that shit.”
Steve's heart lurched, settling into a fast rhythm as he glanced over the rock hiding him from view, and barely held in a surprised gasp. The man at the other end of the pond... wasn't a man. At least judging by the thick fur covering its weirdly bent legs and the horns on its head.
with amendments and slides it over to my lawyers like I'm not even there,” Tony seethed as he kicked the door shut behind him, loosening his tie with a rough jerk of his hand. “Fucking prick. He didn't even give me a notice, just waltzed in there and fucked over three months of planning. I swear to god, I'm going to wipe the floor with his face.”
“I don't know what you mean,” she said just as quietly, tilting her head to let her hair tumble over her shoulder and reveal the spot on her neck that Steve loved to kiss. “No idea at all.” Steve's grip on her waist tightened.
Toni clicked her tongue. “You're doing tricks for some petty cash? Does 'dance, monkey, dance' work on you too?”
It was like a curtain had been lifted, and suddenly Toni could see the nervousness that Steve had somehow managed to hide from her all evening, his fingers fiddling with his tie as he cleared his throat and swallowed.
“I haven't even said yes yet,” Tony said haughtily but broke into a grin when Steve pinched him in the side. “Where are you going to take me?”
Tony sighed long-sufferingly. “I guess I'll take that.” He stretched out his legs, twitching when he accidentally bumped into Steve's before he rubbed his feet against them more deliberately. “What do you say we finish dinner and watch a movie, hm?”
“Nope, I was promised caffeine,” Tony said cheekily, kicking off his shoes before he plopped down on Steve's couch, making himself at home. Steve couldn't help but give him a quick once over. It really was unfair how good Tony looked without even trying. “You don't go back on your word, do you, Rogers?”
“Yeah,” Steve said with no small amount of relief, and Tony watched as some of the tension drained out of his shoulders. It was a very good look on him. “Pizza sounds – Yeah, that'd be great.”
“Deep breath,” Tony said, and Steve obeyed, looking down at Tony who was giving him a rather serious look. “If it hurts, tell me to stop.”
“Oh, you know...” Steve waved at the waitress who smiled and held up two fingers, heading to the kitchen as soon as Steve nodded. “I missed the nice weather.”
Mr. President, the last time Tony Stark felt guilty for something he built a flying metal suit. I believe he will dedicate himself fully to our cause.
Steve hummed, settling back down on the bed, and Tony snuggled up to him, taking deep breaths through his nose. Steve's scent was still weak, nothing like the hormonal assault he remembered, but that would come in due time. And this time he could actually
“Probably yours,” Steve said as he pushed the button to call the elevator. “I know that Rhodey keeps count of the gray hairs you give him.”
"Must've been hard, those first few weeks. Still is, of course, but... I mean, I know what it's like to wake up and lose years." He shook his head. "But that's different. Never woke up knowing exactly what I lost. I don't think I could've taken it."
“No,” he said on reflex, but even he could hear the wobble in his voice, and Steve just kept looking at him, his eyes remaining utterly calm.
Tony cursed as he pulled his fingers out with a wince, grabbing Steve’s cock and shuffling forward on his knees.
"Tony -" was as far as Steve got before his mouth dropped open in a silent moan as his cock spurted in Tony's hand, most of it landing on Tony's crotch and stomach as Tony milked him dry. Steve dropped heavily onto the bed - and subsequently Tony - when he was done, squishing him into the mattress until Tony groaned in protest, prompting him to roll them over until they were both lying on their backs, staring at the ceiling and panting heavily.
Tony was struck silent for a moment before he turned away, busying his hands with the blowtorch he'd left on the table. “Fine.”
He wanted to call it off, tried to tell himself that it wasn’t worth the eventual pain, but when he came into the kitchen the next morning and Steve looked at him with the sweetest, slightly self-conscious smile that wasn’t meant to belong on any alpha – Tony knew that he couldn’t.
He looked up to find the doll staring up at the ceiling, its eyes unseeing, and suddenly Steve couldn’t do it. This felt way too realistic and too plastic at once, smack dab in the uncanny valley, and it was freaking him out. Steve tossed his spare blanket over the doll as his heart pounded so hard he could feel it in his throat, hiding it from view. He didn’t really have anywhere else to put it, so he kept it where it was as he lay down on the other end of his bed, wrapping his own blanket tightly around his shoulders.
Steve carried the pie over to the couch, and Tony watched him arrange it on the stool, then rearrange it. When he reached out to turn the tray again, Tony tapped him on the shoulder.
“Fuck,” he ground out as he came in messy stripes all over Steve's stomach, and Steve made a gut-punched sound, wiping a hand through the mess before bringing it up to his face.
“You, uh. You like baseball, right? Is that on? I mean, is a game on? Cause we could watch that if you want.”
“Okay.” Tony laid back down, pillowing his head on Rhodey’s leg. “Now keep petting my hair. I’m cold.”
“Okay,” Steve choked out and Tony chuckled, his hand just barely ghosting over where Steve was already straining in his pants.
, Tony,” she said firmly, giving his arm one last squeeze before she looked at the clock and gathered their documents for the shareholders meeting. “Just think about it, okay? Maybe you could give him a chance.”
He could see the tears threatening to well up in Steve's eyes again but Steve blinked them away, taking a shaky breath. “It's –“ His face crumpled. Tony's heart twinged at the pained wheeze Steve made. “She was still – she was all I had left when –“
Steve's eyes were probably wide, but he could barely feel his face as he nodded. “That –“ He swallowed hard. “That sounds good.”
“Okay, I'm ready, let's go,” he said, and Steve pulled his fingers out, wiped them on his stomach and reached for the lube to slick up his cock. Tony watched him with hooded eyes as Steve shuffled closer and positioned himself before he pushed in with one smooth stroke, closing his eyes at the sudden heat clenching around him. Fuck, that was –
normal,” Tony said emphatically, squeezing Steve hard enough that Steve could see the strain in Tony's muscles. It felt incredible, and Steve wished he would keep doing it forever, but after a moment Tony relaxed again, making up for it by digging his nails into the base of Steve's scalp. Steve felt a shiver run down his spine. “This is gonna be epic. Just you wait.”
“Well, you should.” She pulled her arm out of his grip. “Let's be reasonable here, okay? You should look for a girl your own age, not someone who could be your goddamn
He could feel Steve's hands clench where they were holding him up by the hips and Tony followed the silent command by wrapping his legs around Steve's waist, humming when Steve's hands wandered down to his ass and squeezed.
“Hello. Hi. I'm Steve Rogers, I'm supposed to – um.“ He dug out the letter and handed it to her. “I was invited? For an interview. About, uh...”
“Of course not,” another vampire said with a hint of disgust. “An untimely death would sully the festivities of your joining.”
“Sure I'm sure.” He patted Steve's hands, twisting just enough to press a quick kiss to his cheek. “It's gonna work, I promise.”
“I didn't mean it as criticism. I'm just saying you're used to it so you're not going to lose control.”
The leaves swayed for a moment as though considering his offer before one of the vines lowered to just barely ghost over Tony's fingers. Tony grinned.
"Hi," Steve eventually mumbled and Tony laughed, happiness bubbling up in his chest until he felt warm inside and out.
“How do I make you feel good?” Steve asked, still in that same hushed voice, and Jesus Christ, Toni wanted to
“I was thinking that you’re in desperate need to get laid and as long as you’re not ready to go and put yourself back out there this might be a good compromise.”
Still, the first step of getting over something was accepting it. And Tony couldn't deny that he felt... an attraction. Towards Steve. Maybe a little more than that.
“It's okay,” Steve said gently, pulling Tony closer until they were pressed chest to chest, and Tony hissed when he felt Steve's hand slide between them, wrapping around both of their cocks. “We'll do it just like this. Nice and gentle, okay?”
Steve was blinking rapidly, his chest hitching with an unsteady breath. "I – really?" His voice sounded very small and Tony hugged him even tighter, resting his chin on Steve's chest.
"Alright," Steve said a little dazedly, letting Mr. Stark lead him out of the room. It still felt surreal to see him, so familiar and yet a total stranger. Steve didn't really know how to feel as he watched Mr. Stark from the corner of his eye, nodding along to whatever he was saying because he couldn't hear him over the ringing in his ears. One thing was crystal clear to him though.
“You'd love that, wouldn't you?” he panted, and Tony turned his head just enough to give him a sweaty grin.
“No strippers,” Clint and Bucky said in synchrony, and Steve tried to tell himself that it made him feel better. But.
“Let's see what you got there for me, hm?” Tony asked, smiling when Steve gulped as he slid Steve's underwear down to his ankles –
Toni smiled, closing her eyes to just bask in the moment for a second before she put a hand on his thigh and looked up at him, their faces only inches apart.
“Hey, you still awake?” Tony asked quietly and Steve mumbled something unintelligible, burrowing his face deeper into Tony's neck. He sounded really content. Maybe they should just go to sleep...
Tony knew that at one and a half inches his penis was a little bigger than other omegas' but he'd never thought that it could feel like
“Hgnn,” Tony said eloquently, turning his face into Steve's touch as he slowly blinked his eyes open, awareness clearing away the post-orgasmic haze. “Wow.”
“Expert in pie-fucking. Yup, sounds like me.” Despite his teasing he stuck a finger into the pie, licking his lips as he tested the temperature. “Feels about right. So how are we doing this?”
“But either way I believe Mr Barnes would be better off in a correctional facility. Or a mental hospital.”
Steve smiled, as if knowing that Tony was from New York too genuinely made him happy. Which was – something. “I
Steve faltered at the stunned disbelief that looked a little too much like pain on Tony's face, but quickly caught himself. He'd get this out if it killed him.
Needless to say Steve caught him before he ever got to the shower to get his revenge. And if Tony's lips were sore enough that night that he actually made use of Natasha's trolling lip balm, well.
“Oh.” Tony smiled, but Steve couldn't help but think it looked a little sad. “It's the least I can do.”
He looked a little overwhelmed, and Tony suddenly realized just how strange this must be for him, having to perform in front of a camera and all. Sure, it was only a photo, not a video, but still, if you weren't used to it –
Tony closed his eyes and took a calming breath. He knew that Pepper was right. He really hadn't been focussing on his streams and it showed in their turnout this month. But still, they weren't doing so badly that they needed to rely on assholes who didn't know how to warn someone before they came in their mouths.
"We're gonna be okay," Tony repeated and for the first time in weeks he found that he actually believed it.
Steve tugged him forward into a kiss that was almost chaste until Tony wrapped his arms around Steve’s neck and tumbled them back onto the bed. They both laughed and Tony felt lightheaded with joy when Steve nuzzled his nose against his.
Steve shook his head, the ghost of a laugh trapped in his throat. “You know, I miss the days when I could actually lie to you.”
"I love you so much," he eventually said, interrupting Tony mid-sentence. "I don't even know how to put it into words, but you're everything, Tony. There's so much – Fuck, you just make everything so much easier. I don't know where I would be without you."
“Yeah, I know,” Steve said, surprising Tony yet again. “But wanting a choice isn't the same as wanting to be independent either.”
“Must've.” Tony looked him up and down before he nodded decisively, swinging his legs out of bed. “JARVIS, can you give me the audio feed from the hallway, please? Crank it up to max.”
“I'll put you over my knee,” Steve said evenly, and Tony's stomach lurched with excitement and apprehension alike. “And I'll give you twenty. Then you're going to suck me off, and if you're good I'll let you come. Do you understand?”
"It is." Tony squeezed another strand between his fingers, straightening it before he cut it off. "But not less important."
Tony slumped down on top of Steve as the waves cresting through him slowly ebbed into the sweet ache of aftershocks, trying to catch his breath. Steve kept twitching underneath him as he rode through his orgasm, his knot pulsing so hard that Tony could feel it in his ass, but eventually his body relaxed all at once, and Tony hummed as he pressed his face against Steve's neck, breathing him in.
They both gasped when Steve started to come in pulses that Tony felt like tiny electro shocks to his core, wet warmth spreading inside him and soothing the slight burn of the initial stretch. Steve groaned halfway through, wrapping his arms around Tony as he shook through the tail end of his orgasm, and Tony grunted at the added weight on his back.
Steve gave him an innocent look that made Tony’s grip tighten in his hair, using it to pull him closer. His cock was throbbing with the pressure when Steve didn’t let up, only took him down into his throat and
“Oh,” Tony said faintly, and Steve couldn't even look at him. He realized distantly that he was shaking, his arm trembling with the strain even as he finally felt some sensation on his cock that went beyond a blatant tease. For a second he felt sick.
Tony rolled his eyes. “It’s not magic. They use the same tech as VR, but they’ve perfected the sensory input so it’s –“
Toni stared at her for a long moment before she swooned, clutching her chest with both hands. “Ms. Potts, you are too good to me.”
“What?” Tony looked over and audibly snapped his mouth shut. “Okay, that's... creepy.” His face turned a little green. “Oh god, I hope it didn't lay eggs in me.”
“T–“ Steve bit down on his admonishment, crossing his arms over his chest to hopefully hide the fact that his hands were trembling. It wasn't even that good, not nearly enough stimulation to get him off under any other circumstances, but coupled with the awareness of the people nearby who could look up and catch the flush on his cheeks at any second –
Toni took great pleasure in bringing Steve's darker side to the surface, cutting through his polite, misogynistic bullshit and going straight for the jugular. Their first fight was white-hot, and Toni could feel the tingling itch in her fingers to grab his hair and yank him to his knees, make him
“It’s my choice. I just don’t want –“ Tony sighed, running a hand through his hair. “I’m just – done. I don’t want heat partners or comfort alphas or – whatever. I won’t need it anyway now that my heats are gone.”
Obviously he could’ve done without the impromptu heart surgery in a desert, but Tony could see the good that had come out of it. The arc was a constant reminder that he had changed, that he wasn’t the same man he was in his late thirties. Tony liked to drum his fingers across the glass surface and remember that he had fallen and rebuilt himself from the ground up. That he had come out on top and survived.
“Well, we can't have that, can we.” Tony heard shuffling on Steve's end. He was probably getting comfortable on his couch, and Tony had no trouble imagining the way his shirt would be pulling tight across his chest, his thighs spread to create the perfect space for Tony to sit on. His cheeks felt a little hot as he took a sip of milk. “Four more days tops. We only have clean-up and a bunch of post-mission briefings, and I promised Sam I'd come along to meet his mother over the weekend.”
The UN believes that the implementation of the Sokovia Accords is the most effective way to reinstate the Avengers as a peace-keeping force and to strengthen the bond between our member nations, more of which are expected to sign the Accords in the following days. A press conference will be scheduled at earliest convenience as soon as all relevant signatures have been gathered.
“Well, this was fun,” Tony said, and Steve's eyes snapped up to his, full of something that Tony was hesitant to put a name to.
Steve stared up at the gigantic, intimidating skyscraper in front of him, wondering how exactly this stainless-steel-and-glass building translated to seedy-sex-toy-factory. He looked back at the letter to double check the address, but yeah, this was the place. Not quite the outback warehouse he'd expected, but considering the quality of the doll he probably should've guessed that it was a high-class establishment.
Bucky's face twisted into a grimace for a split second before it smoothed out into a blank mask. “The king died, did you hear? Right there on the scene. How do you think his son felt watching that?”
NEW FORMAT!! I'm so excited to share this one with you guys! This is the first formatting that I programmed completely from scratch and I love how it turned out. I hope you enjoy it too! Anyway, on to the fic!
“Two minutes,” Pepper said from next to them, looking at her pager with a frown. “Do you both have your cue cards?”
Tony grabbed Steve's hair to tilt his neck further, pulling him close, and Steve followed without struggle, his body going lax under Tony's hands as Tony drank and drank, feeling a warmth tingling under his skin that he hadn't in
“I hoped,” Steve whispered, and he didn't have to say what they both knew, that neither of them had been certain if they would ever get this back. “It's much better than the fantasy though.”
“I just want to go home, okay?” Steve snapped, immediately reining it in when he saw the waitress flinch. “Fuck. Sorry, I just –“
“Hey. You okay?” Steve asked as he wrapped his arms around Tony from behind, hooking his chin over his shoulder. Tony could feel the way he stiffened for a moment when he caught sight of the bottle in Tony’s hand before he relaxed again, fiddling with the hem of Tony’s shirt. “We don’t have to do this, you know?” If you –“
“Huh?” The way Steve seemed to physically drag his eyes away from Tony's body was more than a little gratifying. “Sorry, I – yeah. You look beautiful, Dave.”
"You're not hiding, you live here." Snip. "And they can't throw you in jail." Tony paused when Bucky snorted, frowning at the back of his head. "They can't. I bailed you out. The only way they'll have a reason to take you in is if you run. Don't be stupid, Bucky."
“That's good.” Her voice sounded rough even to her own ears, and Steve took it as the encouragement that it was, licking her clit with little hesitation. Toni wound her hands through his hair to pull him closer –
Steve groaned, and Tony swallowed hard because Steve looked like an absolute vision. His head was tilted back, mouth open and chest heaving with every breath as he stared unseeingly up at the ceiling. After a moment his eyes rolled down to meet Tony's with such awe and
Dr. Yinsen leaned forward in his seat, giving him a serious look. “Yes. But I'd like to hear about it from you.”
“Do you want to eat first?” Tony finally asked once they were in the foyer again, and Steve raised an eyebrow at him with a smile.
Tony read through the paper, trying to find the catch – but there was one. At least none he could see.
“Promise?” Steve's voice sounded small, and Tony hugged him tight, his chest clenching when Steve breathed out shakily against his neck, holding him as if he was afraid Tony would disappear at any moment.
“I'm a genius,” Tony said, hoping that he sounded more confident than he felt. “I'll think of something.”
“Trust me,” Tony said in a low voice as another set of vines came up to brush the hair back from his face. His eyes flicked down to Steve's crotch, and he smirked. “Who knows, this might end up being fun for both of us."
He flicked his tongue out against Steve's already swollen bottom lip, dragging it between his teeth for a second before he licked his way back inside Steve's mouth. His right hand slid down to stroke the side of Steve's neck where he could feel his pulse thundering under the skin, and he swore his own heartbeat rose to match it. Steve shivered at the touch, turning his head just enough to draw a line of kisses down Tony's jaw, and Tony held as still as he could even though he wanted squirm at the feeling of Steve's hot breath on his skin.
“Holy shit,” he said, and Steve laughed breathlessly, his eyes twinkling with something Tony would almost call fondness.
It still feels a little weird to be writing T'Challa after what happened last year. So here's to Chadwick, I have so many fond memories of him, not just in the Marvel fandom, and he will be missed dearly <3 Thanks for reading and I hope you enjoyed this chapter!
Later, when he cuddled up to the doll for the night, he told himself that starting tomorrow he would listen to Bucky's advice and actually try to go out and meet people. Reconnect with society the way he should've done months ago. He could absolutely do that.
"Welcome home," Tony said, and Steve laughed, turning onto his side to press a kiss to Tony's cheek.
"Sorry." Steve pulled away a little, but Tony shook his head, trying to keep him right there because that was - fuck, that was -
Pepper slid the basket over to him, and Tony made a show of picking it up, rolling his back in a sinuous wave as he stood to walk over to the machine. He stuffed the tickets in – the drum was filled to bursting at this point – and closed it up with a definitive click.
“We just finished,” Steve said, but still pulled Tony back on top of him. “And that's not what I meant. I thought about us. What we are to each other.”
"Okay," Bucky said hoarsely, squeezing his wrist once before he let it go. His eyes were very bright when he looked at Tony. "Thank you." They both knew it wasn't for the razor.
“I think our defense did an excellent job,” he said, tipping his head at Bucky. “And Mr Barnes got to say his piece. We'll just have to see how things develop from here.”
Tony whined, teeth clenched as he shook his head, pressing his hips down onto the sphere to get closer, get
“Would you let me finish?” Tony snapped, realizing a second too late that he had just raised his voice at a superior. He could feel the color drain from his face as he instinctively bowed his head. “I –“ His apology got stuck in his throat when a sudden rush of anger made his hands clench into fists, his rational thinking warring with the instinct that Howard had drilled into him. Damn it, Tony was his own person, he was allowed to say what he thought. He'd
The walk to the subway station was a haze through all the thoughts tumbling over each other in Steve's head, one more inappropriate than the other. He couldn't believe this was actually happening, his feet tapping a nervous rhythm as he stood on the platform, waiting for the subway to arrive.
“You've got to be kidding me,” Steve breathed, watching the plant as it tried to pull Tony's pants down, dumbstruck. “Holy shit...”
The creature's voice was deep in a way that carried across the water as if it was speaking directly in Steve's ear. He froze, not quite sure if that feeling in his chest was excitement or fear as he tried to listen for movement to find out what the creature was doing. But with the waterfall right next to him it was impossible to make out anything over the sound of rushing water.
Tony stroked his hair all the way through, then kept doing it when Steve fell back onto the bed, bringing Tony down with him. They slowly caught their breaths as Tony listened to the rapid beat of Steve's heart, his head comfortably pillowed on Steve's chest. He hummed when Steve's hands found his back, pulling him even closer.
He looked up when Pepper put a hand on his arm, prompting him to meet her serious gaze. “Look, I've seen how you are with him, okay? He makes you happy. And I think you could make him happy too. This doesn't have to be a bad thing.”
of every part of him. He was writhing in ecstasy, his muscles spasming completely out of his control, and halfway through he started laughing, like a knot of tension that he hadn't even known was there suddenly released all at once.
He turned to leave, but Steve caught his wrist, stopping him in his tracks. Tony raised an eyebrow, and Steve tried to look calm even though he could feel his cheeks heat up already.
“I promise,” Tony said firmly and Clint eyed him for a second longer before he sighed, snapping his bow shut.
“Yup.” Tony tugged on Steve's arm, slowly pulling him away from the crowd of vampires that suddenly looked a lot more hostile. “Sorry, but I'm just gonna take my bond mate and get out of your hair. See you neve–“
“Well, that's a lie,” Steve said, but the smile he gave Tony was utterly fond as he nodded towards the doorway. “Come on. Shower.”
“Okay,” he said quietly, and before Tony could even begin to wonder about his subdued tone he was out like a light.
Clint opened his mouth, clearly about to make a crass remark, when Natasha stood up and led him away with a tight grip on his arm.
Pepper rolled her eyes. “You're fifty-two, not dead.” She looked over at Toni, raising an eyebrow. “And it's not like you're the paragon of maturity.”
“Closest room,” Steve mumbled and Tony only laughed louder when Steve pulled away to glare at him, the effect ruined by his beet-red face. “You said we were alone.”
And Steve moaned, his body jolting as she tugged on his roots, eyes snapping open in honest surprise. He glanced up at her, his mouth still on her pussy, and Toni could feel a smirk spreading on her lips.
“You can fuck me, you know?” he said and Steve shuddered hard, mouth dropping open on a moan. “I'm loose enough. Gonna fill me up? Get me all–“
He blinked his eyes open when Tony pushed something into his hands, looking at the bottle of lube before he met Tony's eyes. Tony was grinning, his face a little flushed, and Steve felt his cock twitch because
“Well, you're gone, so.” Tony plopped down on the couch, putting his feet up on the table. “Not much to do that can't be done in bed. I'm going to be my own evening's entertainment, if you know what I mean.”
Tony didn't answer, hoping against hope that Steve would take the hint and go away, but as always that wasn't the case. He felt more than he heard Steve step up behind him, and Tony's shoulders bunched up, rage boiling up hot and sharp because he just wanted to be
Steve kissed the top of his head. “Yeah. I can do that.” They caught their breath in silence for a moment. “You realize that your dick isn't small, right?”
The implications of it didn't really sink in until their first outing as a group, when Toni invited all of the Avengers to her mother's annual charity ball. Toni was wearing a low-cut evening gown that accentuated her curves and that the paps would probably call scandalously revealing for her age, and while all of the Avengers made comments, some more complimentary than others, it was Steve's reaction that stuck out to her the most.
“Alright. Here,” he said, then hesitated with his hand halfway outstretched towards Steve. He pulled a pen from his other pocket and scribbled a string of digits – presumably his personal number – on the card before reaching forward and tucking it in Steve’s shirt pocket, patting his chest with a wink. “There you go. Hit me up whenever you want. I know a great Greek restaurant.”
Steve quickly turned away, his heart pounding as he grappled with the image he'd just seen. He hadn't known a penis could grow to that size. Perhaps satyrs were made different.
SHIELD usually enforced this rule on all first time contractors during the first two years of their employment, with a little more leeway once they'd passed that trial period. For Steve it had been different, what with them immediately making him captain of his own team, which meant his contract stated that he was obligated to take suppressant for his first
“Okay, let's get this straight,” Tony said, rubbing his temples as if he had a headache. “Who's everyone feeling hot fuzzies for? Let's go in a circle.” He pointed at Clint with a sour look. “I'm feeling all types of ways about this fucker.”
“I wanted to ask you something,” he said, and Toni raised an eyebrow, gesturing at the room around them.
Steve's eyes locked on his, widening for a moment before they softened, crinkling at the corners. “Does tomorrow at six work for you?”
“Oh.” Tony watched as a tentative smile stretched across Steve's face, and he swore it was like watching the sun rise. Jesus, how did he have it this bad already? “Tony. It suits you.”
They had been together for almost two years when Tony suggested forgoing the scent blockers on their upcoming vacation.
Charles sighed, crossing his arms as he tilted his head to the side. “It is a very old tradition. Perhaps Mr. Stark wasn't aware –“
Tony only felt self-conscious for half a second before he raised an eyebrow at Steve, a smirk dancing over his lips. “You like me being all domestic?”
Toni shook her head. “Yeah, no. No quick fuck is worth the tabloid headlines. Not even when I can bounce quarters off that ass.”
Steve darted forward, trying to get a grip on Tony's legs, but the plant reared up, several vines forming a tight knot that punched Steve right in the chest, hurtling him across the room.
T'Challa's eyes were so cold his gaze sent a shiver down Tony's spine. “I see. I assume you could not have foreseen what happened in Vienna, otherwise you would not be so ready to defend him.”
Steve could feel a headache throbbing in his temples. “The ones I explicitly told you not to touch?”
In the end it wasn't really a fair fight because Steve ended the kiss by getting his hands on Tony's crotch, which meant Tony's mouth dropped open on a moan and gave Steve ample opportunity to press his advantage by licking his way inside. Tony let him enjoy the victory for a minute before he pulled away, resting his forehead against Steve's cheek as they both panted for breath.
“Too heavy?” Steve panted, and Tony shook his head, turning it sideways so he could breathe. It hadn't taken him long to accept how much he loved it when Steve didn't hold back on him, when he used his sheer mass to overpower Tony. But when Steve did
“Holy shit, really?” At least he sounded genuinely surprised. “I thought they’d send you a questionnaire or something.”
It wasn't until Steve started returning the favor and Tony looked down at the huge hand wrapped around his cock that the memory hit him. He shuddered hard, something in him throbbing with need at just the
“Blah blah some bullshit time constraint excuse.” Tony rolled his eyes. “I've been trying to get through to other members of the council but if that doesn't work I'll try to work something out with the President. We might have to go country to country to establish emergency guidelines but it's worth a try.”
Tony pushed his head back into the pillows, baring his neck to Steve who leaned down and buried his face in Tony's neck, sucking in a deep breath. Tony frowned when Steve froze a second later, his whole body suddenly stiff. “Steve? What's wrong?”
Steve didn't look up but his shoulders stiffened when Tony sat down next to him. He didn't shrug off the arm Tony put around him which was already more than Tony had expected. For a long moment they just sat in silence.
And orgasm crashed into Steve like a freight train, punching the air out of him as he curled in on himself, his knees buckling underneath him. It was only Tony's grip on his waist that kept him upright as his cock spurted inside the tube, adding to the mess already in there while Steve tried his hardest just to stay conscious, his vision whitening out.
“Dilation is good,” Steve mumbled to himself before he straightened his back and gave Tony a grin. “That means we're done! Great job, Tony. Take a couple of minutes to catch your breath, then you can get off the table.”
“I'm gonna fuck you so hard,” he mumbled, and Steve laughed, pulling Tony closer as they snuggled down into the sheets.
“Do as he says, no running,” Obie hissed right before the door fell shut between them, and Tony had to follow Dr. Yinsen down the corridor to another room that looked just like the first one, if not for the giant table in the middle of it which was stood on an apparatus that Tony couldn't even try to guess the use of.
“You ruin all my fun, Pep,” Tony said with a giant grin that Pepper must've heard because she heaved another sigh.
They all knew it was bullshit. Tony and Clint had the strangest form of sibling energy out of all of them, the kind of love that emerged in sharp insults and spamming memes in the group chat. But to Steve's surprise Tony reeled back like he'd been struck, not even trying to conceal the genuine hurt on his face.
“Yes.” The sound had barely left his lips before Tony was covering them with his own, pulling him closer as he all but bent Steve backwards over his arm with a hunger that took Steve's breath away. He'd never been kissed like this, like there was a drought and his lips bore the taste of fresh water in a desert. Tony's tongue was hot, claiming Steve's mouth like it belonged there, and Steve let himself get swept away in the moment, relaxing into Tony's hold as he gave back as good as he got.
“Ah, you're all set, wonderful,” Steve said cheerfully, and Tony tried not to stare as Steve rolled up his sleeves, revealing attractively tan forearms. Jesus Christ, he needed to get a grip. “Let's get you in position, then I can start the machine.”
Steve's body was tense against his, trembling under his hands, and it couldn't have been a minute before he heard Steve's groan of release, his arms tightening around Tony as he sped up at last, thrusting into Tony to milk himself dry. Tony swore he came again, or maybe he was still coming, or maybe it just felt like he was. Either way he was floating, his body feeling like an exposed wire that kept sending shocks of pure feeling all the way to the tips of his toes, his cock throbbing with the aftermath of what was probably one of the best orgasms he'd ever had.
Tony only released his grip once the couple sat down, and Steve let out a slow breath, trying to regain his equilibrium – which Tony immediately shattered by placing both of his hands on Steve's crotch and slowly rubbing up and down.
He startled when Bucky grabbed his wrist as he was about to put his razor back in the bag. Bucky swallowed hard when Tony gave him a questioning look.
This time Tony used his nails to scratch at him, the sensation dulled by the thick fabric into something way too fucking good, and to his horror Steve could feel a sudden tension in his balls, his stomach tightening with the low coiling heat.
“Tell me what Tony did.” Steve frowned but Bucky just rolled his eyes, waving a hand at him. “You only get that kicked puppy look when it's about him. Now spill.”
I am writing to inform you that the United Nations General Assembly has come to a decision regarding the Sokovia Accords. Find attached the finalized draft, signed by President Ellis and 91 member nations, that is awaiting your and your team members' signatures.
I'd like to respectfully ask that you or one of your staff arrange a meeting at the Avengers Compound to ensure comprehensive and transparent communication regarding the current state of affairs. A definite response is expected by the time that the UN meets to ratify the Accords in Vienna five days from now. I regret to inform you that in the event that such a time frame cannot be met the UN reserves the right to retire any and all members of the Avengers that have not agreed to adhere to their terms.
“I'm not signing until we have a guarantee that they'll let us help people even without their say so. And not before Bucky's trial is through.”
They caught their breaths for a few moments of comfortable silence. Tony's eyes slipped closed when Steve started stroking the back of his neck, digging his fingers into all the right spots. It felt so good that he was almost afraid he'd drop off to sleep immediately.
"Fuck," he groaned and felt more than he saw Steve's smile against his cock. Steve turned his head left and right, rubbing his beard over Tony's cock before he finally opened his mouth and guided him back inside. The contrast of tight, wet heat to the coarse friction of his hair was making Tony's head spin.
“Thank you,” T'Challa said, his eyes boring into Tony's. “I hope you understand that if Mr Barnes wasn't currently under the protection of the law I wouldn't be sitting in this stand.”
“I'm going to ruin you for other men,” Tony rumbled, possessively, and Steve arched into his touch, hips hitching forward to rub his cock against Tony's.
"Thought you said no sex in the workshop," Tony mumbled against Steve's lips and to his chagrin Steve sighed and pulled away, a lovely flush on his cheeks.
“Well,” Tony said, his warm breath on Steve's neck making him shiver. “Guess we just have to make sure we don't, hm?”
For a second Bucky looked like Wanda had just slapped him in the mouth. Then he blinked once, twice, before grabbing her hand and shaking it with a solemn look in his eyes. “Thank you.”
“Okay,” Steve said, and Tony grabbed his hand to drag him across the hallway and into the bathroom, shutting the door tightly behind them. It should've probably felt awkward, being in Steve's space now that they'd both gotten off, but somehow it felt completely natural to wipe first Steve and then himself clean with a moist towel, scrubbing Steve's come off his face with a strangely wistful feeling in his gut.
Steve whirled around to see the creature standing behind him, leaning on one of the rocks and watching Steve with a wide grin. Apparently not at all self-conscious about the fact that its cock was still fully on display.
“Serghh,” Tony garbled around the vine in his mouth, spit dripping down his chin, and Steve watched as Tony's back arched, his hips twisting desperately in the vines' hold, like he didn't know whether to get away or get closer –
Tony's cock now, pressing and releasing in a rippling motion that Steve could never hope to emulate, but that had to feel
“No,” Steve said immediately, then bit his lips. “But it's... my body. When you woke up and – I smelled... it felt wrong. I don't know.”
“Not if you keep messing up the schedule,” Pepper snapped before she huffed a breath, probably trying to calm herself down. “Just – let me post this one, okay? I don't know why you're saying I can't.”
it, couldn't get enough of everything Steve and he were doing. But now that he'd become accustomed to Steve's weight and girth in his grip –
Steve wanted to protest, but as soon as he opened his mouth he found that he couldn't. “I don't trust him,” he said eventually and Bucky nodded.
Toni was pretty sure her mouth was hanging open rather unattractively as she stared at him. “What the hell are you – Are you
Steve looked at him for a long moment, and Tony was just thinking he might have overstepped his boundaries when Steve lowered his head and laughed quietly. “You're not wrong. I mean, my buddy and I, we... We used to get into some scrapes when we were younger. He's my roommate.” His eyes twinkled as he looked up at Tony. “And unlike me he never grew out of that phase.”
Tony raised his head defiantly, meeting Dr. Yinsen's eyes head on, and to his surprise the doctor looked pleased, like he'd gotten exactly what he was looking for.
“You didn't bring it with you, did you?” Bucky asked and Tony glared at him. “Just asking! There's always room for human error, no offense.”
"Besides, I've seen how he is with you." Bucky smiled. "Never seen him so happy. I'm glad you were there when I wasn't."
“Duly noted.” Tony saluted, and she quirked a smile as she closed the door behind her, leaving them alone in the room. He barely had the time to say hello before Steve was already pulling him into his lap until Tony was straddling him, his hands tangling in Steve's hair.
And then Tony kissed him, licking inside Steve's mouth like he had something to prove, and Steve twitched, his hands clenching on Tony's shoulders in surprise, and suddenly there were four fingers inside him and – fuck.
under her breath, but he was far too busy watching Steve's muscles work as he walked up to them to care. Steve plopped down on the couch next to him with a sigh, his arm wrapping around Tony's shoulders as he pressed a chaste kiss against his cheek.
Bucky was silent for a long moment before Steve heard him sigh over the phone. “Look, if it really bothers you I’ll go, okay? I’m sorry, I didn’t think they’d require you to go there.”
“Come on,” Tony goaded, and Steve felt hot all over with the challenge, like he was burning up. His hands clenched on Tony's waist as he tried to push himself closer, deeper, fuck Tony with everything he had. And when he hoisted Tony's hips up even higher, wrapping his free hand around Tony's cock, Tony arched off the bed and came between them with a guttural groan that went straight to Steve's dick.
It took an embarrassingly short time for him to feel that familiar tension building in his gut, a low thrumming heat that threatened to spill over as Steve swallowed around him, letting Tony sink all the way into his throat. Tony was clawing at the sheets to try and get a grip, but he could feel his control slipping, hips hitching up of their own accord to fuck deeper into Steve's mouth, and Steve
Tony hummed, turning in Steve's arms to press a kiss to his naked chest as Steve's hands found his hair, stroking it gently. “What did you think about?”
"Yes, please," Steve whispered, the pressure in his chest instantly getting lighter when Tony started telling him about his day, about that time Clint accidentally set fire to the toaster and got sprayed by DUM-E for his efforts, about team dinners and familiar names and faces that settled Steve's nerves like nothing else did.
So it seems that my muse has returned, hallelujah! If all goes well I'll be back on my every other day update schedule but if I have gap days somewhere in there, don't be alarmed. I'm alright :) Thanks for reading and I hope you enjoy this chapter!
Tony had missed Steve’s voice more than he could say, but he found that he’d missed their comfortable silences just as much.
Steve pressed a kiss to where he thought his temple was and landed on his ear. Close enough. “You know I do.”
“Ah, I – I do work on the internet,” Steve said with a bashful smile in his direction. “I'm an artist. I mostly work on commission.”
“You get it now, don't you?” Tony asked cheekily, squeezing Steve's ass until Steve couldn't suppress a quiet noise. “I can do whatever I want to you and nobody will know. Just you and me.”
Steve watched him go, and suddenly he realized what that feeling was. What made him want to ask Tony to stay, just a little longer, because – because –
Still, his friends had paid good money for the doll and Steve wasn’t enough of an asshole to not appreciate the gesture, as misguided as it was. The least he could do was give it a shot.
“Last hangar on the left,” Sam said, leading them out onto the tarmac. “Should be a jet prepared for us there.”
Clint made a mock gagging noise as he turned and walked towards the door. “Alright, that's my cue. Have fun with your circle jerk, losers!”
Toni hummed. “You can go a little deeper. Crook your finger like this.” She demonstrated, and Steve nodded solemnly as if she'd given him an order as he turned his hand palm-side up.
Tony's brow creased in a tiny frown, a little irritated at being so blatantly interrupted. “I think that you can find enjoyment in everything if you just –“
“Please, Steve,” Tony said, his breath hitching in his throat as he clenched down around Steve's cock and sat up to get it even deeper, arching his back as it shifted inside him. “Just –
For a second Steve was so overcome with affection that he barely reined in his impulse to kiss Tony stupid. Then he did it anyway.
Steve rubbed the salve into his skin, almost instantly soothing away the sting and just leaving that warm feeling of being pleasantly worked over behind. Tony sank into the mattress with a sigh, humming to himself when he felt Steve's lips trailing kisses over his shoulder blades.
“Right.” Pepper eyed him for a moment longer before she leaned into his side and rested her head on his shoulder. Tony wrapped an arm around her and tried to ignore the lump in his throat as it suddenly started to sink in that he was going to meet this guy – and probably suck him off – in two weeks time.
“Yeah, about that,” Tony said evasively. "What's your stance on a second secret identity?" Steve gave him a look and Tony snorted. "Nah, this one's remote controlled. You couldn't fit in it if you tried." FRIDAY obligingly opened the face plate to show the machinery that made up its arsenal. "Got a lot more firepower that way. Even more than War Machine."
He kept his hand tight around the base as he gave tiny kitten licks to the head, reaching down with the other to gently roll Steve's balls in his palm, just feeling out what kind of stimulation he might enjoy. Steve responded beautifully to the touch, arching into Tony's hands as he threw his head back and panted.
“I liked it,” Steve said, tapping his fingers on the elevator rail as he smiled at Tony. “We should try it again sometime.”
"How would you know? Maybe I've programmed in a matrix that counts how many times you..." Tony trailed off when he felt Steve's hand on his chin, tilting it up until they were kissing again, his eyes slipping shut as he wrapped his arms around Steve.
Tony led the way to the elevator, pushing the button and leaning against the wall next to Steve as JARVIS took them up. For a long moment neither of them said anything.
Steve blinked, finally dragging his eyes over to the woman who was standing with her hand outstretched and one immaculate eyebrow raised. “Ah, excuse me,” Steve stammered, shaking her hand quickly even though his eyes drifted back over to the man – who was grinning at him now. Jesus fucking Christ.
“I can see that you’re not fucking me.” Steve looked up to meet Tony’s eyes, swallowing at the lazy smirk on his lips. “Come on. Give it to me.”
Tony nodded, grabbing the gown as Steve left the room, closing the door behind him. He tugged off his clothes at record speed, debating for a moment whether or not he should keep his underwear on, but if the procedure was about massaging his pelvis he probably wanted as little fabric lines as possible there. Tony slipped on the gown before he tucked his underwear underneath the rest of his clothes and walked back over to the table, trying to figure out the best way to gracefully lie down on it. But before he could follow through the door opened and Steve came back inside.
Steve didn't resist as Tony carried him over to the bed, but as soon as Tony tried to untangle their limbs Steve whined and pulled Tony back on top of him, his hips hitching up against Tony's thigh.
“Just – look!” Steve opened the book to its first page and started flipping through it until he found what he wanted. “I kept drawing you. In exile, when we were – I drew you all the time.”
“You can – go harder,” he forced out, and Tony smirked, bringing his other hand up to push down on Steve's cock with all of his body weight and – oh,
In addition we have received multiple reports of a vigilante in Sudan who goes by the name of 'Nomad'. He may be connected to local crime syndicates or working on his own. Since Sudan has not signed the Sokovia Accords the UN has decided against Avengers involvement in this case, however we are asking you to keep an eye out for future sightings to pass on to the Sudanese local forces. Reports suggest that we may be dealing with an enhanced individual.
“I had fun tonight, Tony,” Steve interrupted him before he could really start rambling and had to suppress a grin when Tony visibly tried to hide a proud smile. “Thanks for dinner.”
“There wasn't anyone else,” Tony said, and Steve averted his eyes, biting his lip hard enough that the skin turned white. “I promise. Steve –“
“Well, then you better figure it out soon. Because if you lead that poor guy on for too long it's going to be really awkward working with him in the future.”
And then Tony came with a guttural groan, pumping his come deep inside Steve, filling him with a boiling heat that matched the fire under his skin –
“Never.” Bucky smirked. “You're transparent as shit, Stevie. So why do you look like I pissed in your porridge?”
In addition to this discovery it seems that Secretary Ross has been involved in many other dubious operations over the last decade. Proof of illegal arms deals in the Middle East as well as decades of tax-evasion keep surfacing in different corners of the web, along with receipts of bank statements detailing the amount of dirty money Ross seems to have accumulated
Steve trailed off, a sudden tension in his voice that Tony couldn't place, and Tony frowned. “What?”
Steve groaned but trailed off into a laugh that brought a smirk to Tony's lips. “I don't like you just for your ass, Tony.”
“That'll be all, Ms Potts.” Toni slashed the air to make JARVIS close the call before she curled up on her side, hugging the pillow to her chest. Damn it, she hated this.
“I'll get the quinjet ready,” Natasha said and Tony nodded at her as he joined Bucky and Steve's side while the others cleared the airport behind them.
He looked up at the doll, panting as he pressed his forehead against its cheek, staring at the line of its jaw before his eyes traveled up to its mouth, catching on the way its bottom lip jiggled in time with his thrusts. He could push his cock in there, fuck its throat the way he couldn’t with a real person, just go for it and –
“I'm leaking! Holy fuck, Steve, look at this! Come on, wake up!” Tony nudged Steve's shoulder until Steve followed his silent command and sat up, his disgruntled frown melting into genuine amazement when he looked at Tony's swollen nipples that were still sluggishly dripping onto his chest.
Still, they hadn't done more than over the clothes touching yet, and even that had seemed to be a novelty for Steve. So she didn't regret her decision. But if their patience finally ran out tonight, well...
“I'll be right back,” Tony said quietly, and Steve made a muffled noise of agreement as he buried his face in Tony's pillow and promptly started snoring. Tony didn't bother hiding his sappy smile behind a hand as he scooted towards the edge of the bed and reached for the nondescript bottle he'd placed there before.
“There you go, sweetheart,” Tony whispered soothingly, and Steve sagged in his arms, his eyes falling shut as Tony petted him, stroking his hair so gently that it made Steve's skin prickle with goosebumps. “You were amazing. So brave. Took it all for me, hm? Shh.”
Tony really wanted to make a joke about what other parts of The_Captain might be up for it, but he refrained. This guy seemed like a bit of a nervous nilly, and Tony wasn't about to make that worse.
The truth was, he’d almost had a panic attack when the doctor told him he’d never have a heat again. Lactating was one thing, but being completely unable to bond with anyone was a punch in the gut. And Tony had always been prone to fall hard and fast. He couldn’t afford letting an alpha into his life only to have them find out that they were courting damaged goods. He’d rather spare himself the hurt.
Steve gave Tony a slightly panicked look as he stood up, and Tony tried to look as reassuring as possible as he waved him along. He wasn't quite sure that he succeeded.
“If you could just sign this form stating that you are aware that your evaluation of our product will be used for further research and development at our company, we can commence with the interview. Don't worry, all of your answers will be stored anonymously. We won't keep your personal data without your express permission.”
“Wonderful.” Tony clapped his hands, grabbing his jacket and patting down its pockets to check if he had his wallet and keys. Then he turned towards the back room and shouted, “We're going to Luigi's, you want anything?”
Tony's stomach twisted with shame that prickled down his spine and left goosebumps in its wake, lighting his whole body up with arousal. He stared at his cock, watching as it slid up along Steve's, kept in place by the hand Steve had loosely wrapped around both of them at the base.
“I'm coming with you,” Tony said with a hint of a challenge, taking a step forward. “On one condition.”
He ignored the circus behind him as he walked towards Tony, clearly the only sane person left in the room since he was tapping away on his phone instead of joining the madness. Tony didn't look up, even when Steve came to a stop right next to him, and somewhere deep in Steve's gut was that same knot of anxiety that always clouded his interactions with Tony now. They still hadn't found an equilibrium after what happened in Siberia two years ago, but Steve liked to think that they were getting better. At least they were talking to each other again.
, and he couldn't hold back the groan that tore from his throat, his breathing heavy enough that it seemed to echo throughout the room. Tony sighed happily, and Steve's hips jerked forward once, twice more before he was spent, letting himself drop down on top of Tony, mindful to keep his weight off of him with his elbows.
“Yeah well, I don't have all the patience in the world,” Tony said, grinning smugly at the sound Steve made when he fondled his balls. Steve wordlessly pushed his pants down to give him better access and Tony took full advantage of it, taking Steve's cock in hand and watching hungrily as a bead of pre-come sluiced over the head.
“It's too dangerous,” Steve said, looking more weary than Tony had ever seen him. Which was yet another reason why Tony should – “You can't be in the room when it hits. If I hurt you – Tony, how am I supposed to live with that?”
He was distantly aware that he should stop, and so he did, pulling his teeth out of Steve with a groan, instinctively licking the wound to seal it shut. Steve's taste lingered on his tongue, making his skin buzz with a restless energy that prompted him to bite him again, on the other side of his neck this time. The sound Steve made at that was like music in his ears, and as he drank Tony suddenly noticed that he was hard, almost unbearably so, his arms clenching tight around Steve's shivering body.
Steve shrugged, making an awkward gesture with his hand. “Same way you do, I guess. I just – squeeze harder.”
Toni turned onto her stomach, staring at the lines in the fabric of her couch. This was so stupid. She was a fifty-two year old woman; she didn't need this kind of juvenile drama in her life. And yet she couldn't stop thinking about Steve and all the ways she wanted to ruin him. It was awful.
Steve realized suddenly that he was whimpering under his breath, pushing up into Tony's touch, and Tony shushed him, wrapping Steve up tightly in his arms.
“Okay. You want me.” Steve nodded, relieved that Tony still believed him. “But there's something bothering you, right? You can tell me. I won't get mad.”
“Well, he can suit himself,” Bucky said, stretching his arms over his head before he crossed them behind his neck, throwing his muscles into sharp relief. Wanda didn't even spare him a glance, too busy making googly eyes at Natasha, but Steve saw Sam turn away to repeatedly slap his face with both hands.
Tony braced his hands on Steve's abs and pushed himself up, his mouth dropping open at the drag of Steve's huge cock inside him. It always felt good, but there was something special about how much Steve seemed to love it right now, his hands practically ripping the mattress apart where he was holding on to the bed, head turned away and his eyes squeezed tightly shut as if he was trying desperately to stay in control.
It took about two hours before they reached the ten thousand dollar mark, and that last thousand was completely covered by AssMaster69, BabyMilkMilk and Peek-At-Chu. Tony clapped his hands, grinning as Pepper rounded up the last of the tickets, her pen moving furiously over the papers.
Steve was looking up at him with a softness in his eyes that made Tony want to squeeze him as he ran his thumbs under Steve's eyes to wipe away the evidence of his tears.
"Steve," he ground out, and Steve clearly knew what he meant, doubling his efforts to apparently suck Tony's soul out through his dick, his beard glistening with spit and pre-come, and Tony -
Tony watched the jet land from thirty feet away, walking towards it as soon as it touched down. The hatch had barely opened when Steve came walking down the ramp, shaking hands with a woman clad in red and black. Their eyes met and Tony started running, arms outstretched so he could hold on when Steve immediately picked him up and spun them around in a circle, a broad grin on his face.
“Looking forward to it.” Tony plopped down next to her, pulling out his phone so he could make first contact with The_Captain. “Do you know this guy? I don't think I've seen him in my streams.”
With all due respect, the Sokovia Accords do not give you the authority to call us in for investigations based on speculation. Unless you can provide us with definite proof to support your claims I regret to inform you that we and our legal team have decided not to answer your call to action.
“Nope. Just a spritz before you go to bed after is enough.” Clint grinned. “Actually, you might want to try doing it when he's already asleep.”
Hey guys! Sorry this chapter took so long, I haven't had as much time to write as I would've liked these past few days. But if all goes well I'll post tomorrow as well as the day after that :) Thanks so much for reading and I hope you enjoy it!
“What if it's me?” he asked when they were lying together on the bed after another round of – in his humble opinion – spectacular sex. “Maybe your body knows I can't go into heat, so it's just –
“I won't, Sir,” Steve said in his best butter-wouldn't-melt tone. The door had barely closed when he felt a punch in his side.
it.” Tony twitched when he felt Steve's fingers card through his hair before he let himself melt into it, his shoulders slumping as Steve scratched at his scalp. “You got upset over things that aren't true, Tony. And it pains me to know that you believe those kinds of things about yourself.”
Tony grunted when his cock slid up in a way that pressed its head firmly against the sphere, massaging a spot that felt white hot even through the fabric of the gown, and Tony tried to hold still, to keep up the angle, but his hips hitched forward anyway and –
Tony retracted his teeth, completely out of breath as he kept nuzzling at Steve's throat. Steve whimpered with every touch, his whole body jerking when Tony licked his neck to suck up the last traces of Steve's blood. There was an overwhelming buzzing in Tony's ears that only seemed to get louder when he pulled Steve fully into his arms so he could –
Tony slammed the bottle onto the bar, making the glasses on it rattle as he whipped around towards Steve. “Don’t tell me what to do!”
“That's good. Nice job.” Tony's voice was rough, and that, coupled with the praise, made Steve's stomach swoop with a warmth that spread all the way to the tips of his fingers as he gripped the edge of the table to steady himself. Tony walked over to the left vice, wrapping his hand around the crank that stuck out of its side. “Ready?”
Tony couldn't argue with that. He sunk back into their nest, letting soft kisses and even softer words lull him to sleep.
“He spent ten bucks. That one donation you for some reason decided to call attention to.” Pepper huffed. “Thanks for that, by the way. I'll have to make sure this whole thing doesn't look like a set-up now.”
“I... I don't know,” Tony said uneasily, trying to pry off a vine that was starting to creep underneath his shirt. “Uh... Okay, that's - wait -”
He tossed his phone to the side after she hung up, sinking down into the couch as he pulled up Netflix for a nice, relaxing evening, his fingers trailing down to scratch his balls.
Tony grimaced, feeling that familiar curl of defiance creeping up in his chest – and sagged with relief when he realized that it was still there. The procedure hadn't changed him.
make him moan and lower his head, watching through the gap between Steve's legs as a line of pre-come dripped from his cock onto the floor. God, he wanted to touch himself so badly. Better yet, have
“Definitely,” Tony said in a tone that said 'probably not', and Steve's heart sank unexpectedly. “Take care of yourself – um...”
Steve watched helplessly as Tony wriggled around, looking for purchase on one of the vines holding him. The plant only responded by gripping him tighter, its leaves bristling when Steve carefully tried to inch closer. Steve frowned.
Steve bit his lip as he nodded, his mind whirling with despair. He couldn't do this. If Tony saw – he would –
Charles frowned for a moment before he smiled and patted Tony on the shoulder. “Business calls, huh? Well, we won't keep you long, Mr. Stark.” The man next to Charles slid a paper across the table, and Tony looked down at it, quirking an eyebrow because it was... surprisingly short? “Just sign your name here and register your status as a Council member. Ignacio will handle the rest.”
Tony would've loved to shove the guy's mic up his ass. Instead he smirked. “This press conference has been scheduled for over a month. We moved it up a few days due to the trial but we never meant to keep Mr Barnes a secret forever. In fact we are hoping for him to return to active duty by the end of the year.”
“Oh, come on, we both know that’s bullshit,” the general scoffed. “You built War Machine, didn’t you?”
Steve tried hard to keep a straight face, but he had a feeling the warmth in his cheeks was still visible. “It's okay.”
Steve waved a hand at nothing, suddenly unsure if his assumption might offend Tony. “I heard... I mean, you're supposed to –“
Tony didn't give them time to adjust before he pushed himself up, both of them grunting as Steve's cock slid out of him until only the head remained inside. He lowered himself back down just as slowly, reveling in the tightly controlled tension he could feel in Steve's body as he held himself entirely still.
“Here you go. Happy now?” he asked when he plopped back down, crossing his legs as he read the donation messages that kept trickling in now that he was sitting down and reading them. “Aww, The_Captain thinks I'm beautiful,” Tony said with a smile even though a ten-dollar donation usually didn't warrant him answering it. But sometimes he liked to encourage smaller donations, especially when they were sweet. “Ten gift coins for a ticket, people. We're drawing lots at ten thousand to see who wins the meet-and-greet. Might even lead to happy ending if you're lucky.”
And then Steve came, pumping his come into Tony with a shout, and it only took a couple of strokes for Tony to follow him over the edge, his whole body twitching with pleasure as Steve kept dragging his knot along Tony's walls with every jerky thrust.
Then he got up, threw away the used tissues and stepped into the shower to wash off the dirty feeling that lingered under his skin. The afterglow had long since faded, and Steve resigned himself to the feeling of dismay that kept building in his chest and would probably follow him to sleep.
“How’s that?” Tony asked and Steve moaned, grabbing one cheek to watch his fingers dig into the flesh as his other hand spasmed on the fleshlight, squeezing it to make it even tighter – “You want to come inside?”
“It is,” Steve said, and Tony's grin widened, his eyes crinkling at the corners. Steve was struck with the sudden thought that Tony was beautiful, like he shone from the inside.
“Oh. Okay, thank you,” Steve said, trying not to stare at Mr. Stark's body too obviously, now that he could see it in its full glory. Christ, he needed to get a grip. Luckily Mr. Stark kept smiling at him.
“You're so beautiful,” Steve said, and Tony jolted, his eyes rolling back into his head when Steve pinched his other nipple next, another gush of milk spilling out over his fingers. It was a lot less than Tony was used to, but it was enough. It was
“You want to get up right now?” Steve asked as he shifted so their legs were tangled together, pressing his cock fully against Tony's – and, fuck, Steve had a point. This wasn't going to take long anyway.
The panel thanks you for your suggestions regarding the emergency clauses of the Sokovia Accords. We have studied them with interest and gauged their pertinence in cooperation with other UN officials.
Anyway, can you believe it's been 121 chapters since we last had a dick pic in the dick pic verse? Unbelievable. Anyway, this felt like just the right time to bring them back so here you go, some NSFW goodness. Please enjoy!
“You heard it here first, folks. The Avengers are proud to say that Sergeant Barnes will be joining our ranks in the very near future. And we're happy to have him!”
Tony grabbed Steve's other arm, tugging him a little closer, but the vampire didn't take the hint, staring up at Steve with huge, hungry eyes. Dread sank like a stone into Tony's gut. “He's coming with me,” Tony said, but one of the older vampires huffed, giving him a stern look.
“Good boy.” Tony shivered, eyes dropping closed as Steve ran a hand through his hair. “What do you need?”
“Okay,” Tony croaked, his head dropping heavily onto Steve's shoulder as Steve started stroking them, his grip tight enough to make Tony's toes curl. It didn't take long at all before Tony was trying to thrust up into his fist, his ass throbbing with every move, pulsing warmth all along the length of his spine as the pain made his blood sing with sweet, sweet agony. Tony was panting, his thighs shaking because he could feel it deep in his gut, that pressure that was lying in wait to push him over the edge once he couldn't take any more.
Tony froze for a second before he relaxed, running his hands down Steve's back until he was gripping his waist and holding on tight.
Something about this felt... weird. A satyr telling him to put his clothes on, when all the stories he'd heard said... well, the opposite. Wasn't the –
“Can I make it better?” Steve asked, and Toni looked down at him, at his eyes that were shining with the desperate need to please –
"And here we are," Mr. Stark said, stopping in the foyer to shake Steve's hand, putting his free hand on his shoulder. Steve had to suppress a shiver at the feeling of Mr. Stark's skin against his. "We'll call you as soon as we -"
Steve didn't hesitate. He swung the door open right away, coming face to face with a decorated officer.
There is something very wrong. It is bigger than Tony thought. It is more than what the abolitionists fight for, it is the very soul of humanity. He cannot swallow down the bonding gland elixir. Instead he gags and shivers, but then Steven’s arms come up and around him, holding him. It feels familiar and right. Every part of him wants Steven to feel something more, something that’s not about subjugation, not about their roles. Steven strokes his hair, buries his face in the crown of Tony’s head. It feels almost as if he enjoys the closeness, the embrace as well.
He stumbles to his couch and flails a little as he sits down. His mind scrambles in his head to make sense of it. This morning he managed, he did. Nothing was amiss. Other than the fact he woke up in a stranger’s arms, but if he was truthful with himself that is more common than he likes to admit. Everything was fine, he handled everything well. Shit, he even assisted Steve when he got sick. Though that’s something Tony’s pretty familiar with himself. He watched as Steve disrobed and stepped into the bath.
She drops her hands and glares at him. “Cut the bullshit, Steve. You’ve fallen hard for him, and something happen that upset you and now you want out.”
When Steve climbed his way to consciousness, the first things he noticed were the music and Sam sitting close by. He spoke and Sam smiled. It should have been all that Steve needed to feel grounded again, but the dissonance running like an undercurrent in his core caused him to flinch. He shifted awkwardly in the bed and Sam jumped up and placed a hand on his shoulder.
As a boy, Tony owned a small stuffed lion. He received it for his fifth birthday – a gift from his mother. His father only scoffed at the toy and instead offered him an erector set. He loved them all the same, though he always hid the stuff toy from his father’s sight. Sometimes, late at night when Tony couldn’t sleep, he snuggled down under the covers and Blu (that was the lion’s name) would take him on adventures.
“You need time for yourself as well. I know, Tony.” Steve approaches him and holds out his hand. “Listen, I don’t condemn you for wanting time for yourself just because you hold a position of power. Everyone needs that. Plus, you are trying to make a difference. God, you’re working to save us from this war.” Steve brushes a hand down Tony’s still bare chest. “If you want, and if you could find a proper place to hide me, I can warm your cock the entire time you meet with Obie.”
In seconds both Natasha and Thor were at the door to the master bedroom suite. Tony steered Steve back into the bed and Natasha hooked up another bag of the synthetic blood. She scowled at Tony but something soft and forgiving crossed her face when she gazed at Steve and then back at him again. “I understand where you’re coming from. Don’t mistake me. But this is dangerous. You have to know that. It will only cause you heartache and pain when he’s gone.”
“Your heart won’t take it anymore. If you go in there, you’ll very likely go into cardiac arrest,” Cho replies. “Captain Rogers has a much better chance of surviving than you do.”
Tony inwardly shivered, , and then turned back to Natasha. “Tell me what the hell is going on? I get a cryptic phone call from Ste-.” He paused because he never called Rogers “Steve”.  Not in front of anyone. Not now. Not like this. Their relationship didn’t work that way. “Cap,.I get this weird phone call from Cap telling me to get safe. And then he hangs up. Thank fuck, I’d been working on new armor. It barely got me here, but I fucking found him and flew him in. JARVIS about had an AI seizure trying to get me here.”
“No one works for SHIELD because they want to, Cap,” Tony said and sighed. He took the phone from Steve and dialed back on what Steve thought was his sales pitch. “I guess we’re not doing this.”
“You don’t want me to. You don’t want me,” Tony says. The man wanted to die. When Tony first took him, he wanted to die, hoped to die. The man loved another.
Tony stumbled back from the kiss, a look of pure excitement and astonishment on his face. “You really go for something when you decide, don’t you?”
“You act like the viewing box is ours. It’s not, it’s for all the Conclave to use.” Steve notices that Tony doesn’t shrug off Obie’s touch. “What exactly are we trying to prove here?”
Tony opens his eyes for a moment, and stares at Steve. His focus looks blurry to Steve, he’s slipping downward, right where he needs to be.
He had cried as Blu lay dying in his arms and his mind ached with thoughts of complete loss. He could not fathom leaving Blu behind, he could not fathom the idea of Blu dying. Blu had taken care of him, had fed him, watched over him in the night, and led him to safety. Blu understood him when nightmares racked his sleep and he needed to nest further into the big animal’s fur.
Steve grabs Tony’s arms holding them steady as a brace as he fucks into Tony, over and over. Letting the sensations become his wave to ride it. He bites his inner cheek, holding on, just a bit longer, just toward the tip of pain. He fucks and then says, “Baby, come for me. Come for your Captain.”
Steve closed his eyes, not wanting to confront the truth. Hiding from the truth only brought pain and suffering later. He clamped his mouth shut as his Second in Command walked around him and stood not five feet from him.
“Good God, man,” Tony says and seizes Steve up from his ministrations. He pummels Steve’s mouth and then Steve shares the pre-come taste with Tony. “We need the oil.”
With a glance toward Hill and then one to the triage bay where he had last seen Steve, Tony went with Bruce. Waves radiated off of Bruce oscillating between calm and rage. Tony tried to wall them off, tried to get a grip on where his feelings ended and Bruce’s began.  Bruce led them to the  hospital café and they order coffee (burnt) and muffins (stale).  Bruce didn’t seem to mind the culinary state of the food or drink. He gobbled it up without pause. Tony only sipped his coffee.
He keeps his shirt on because taking it off yesterday strained his ribs too much. Today he’ll keep it on, but he can toss the pants and socks and shoes. He carefully makes it down to the edge of the water. It isn’t deep. He knows that from yesterday. He gingerly picks his path down to the waters. As soon as he touches the trickle near the edge of the shore, he hisses. Colder than he would have guessed, but then again it probably originates from the mountains. He walks into the water and, at first, it’s only around his ankles. As he gets used to the temperature, he wades a little deeper. Finally, it’s around his knees and he sinks down into the water to bathe. The current isn’t fast but just strong enough to swirl around him like a Jacuzzi tub. He dunks his head and scrubs at his hair. With no shampoo available this will have to do. His poor beard is going to look rough by the time they get out of this.
Steve takes it and with a groan, stands. “I’m beginning to think that Schmidt might have planned things this way.”
“The opportunity to live freely. It’s a sad state of affairs when a nation built on the idea of individual’s freedom doesn’t actually live up to its perfect union idea.”
“He nearly drained you. He was dead,” she said. She looked at him then. Her eyes that smoky green that Steve learned long ago meant that she saw things around him, the shadows and dimensions of other worlds, other times hanging close by. “He’d been crucified on the roof of the Triskelion, from what he told me. He doesn’t want you to know. I think you should know. You should know all of it. He said you went through too much, though. What they did to you, the scars they left.”
Steve accepts the bowl and then eases down on the edge of the bed. Stirring the stew with the course spoon, he keeps his eyes fixed on the stew. “I’m sorry.”
“Good, good.” Tony goes to his knees, feels for the blanket and then sits down on it. “Glad you talked me into the hoodie. It’s chilly up here.”
“To another Steve,” Tony says and throws the paper on the table. He glares at Logan and then at Bruce. “Realities don’t work that way. This reality.” He points at the table with all of the drawings. “isn’t my reality. It isn’t our reality. Steve- our Steve shouldn’t be here with me, chasing after this.” It hurts like a son a of a bitch to say it, but it’s fucking true. “Because this – these drawings are just a fantasy. He’s supposed to be with you.”
“Well, it’s not planned so it’s just like a lottery, only we rigged it.” Tony winks at him and Rhodes wanders over. He stands to the side as if adding a solid wall of protection for Tony. Steve doesn’t know where Happy and Pepper disappeared.
Once seated, Steve drops his head back and allows the feeling to wash over him. Shudders throb through him and his ass clenches involuntarily. Tony moans and grips Steve along his flank and then slides his hands up his sides. His hands are large against Steve’s small frame and his skin tones darker – stronger than the pale of Steve’s own skin. The strength and power Tony represents sends a shockwaves right to Steve’s groin and his cock drips and twitches.
Shaking his head, he replies, “No. The doctor said that it’s not repairing-.” He stops before he says uteri. “It’s not working. The damage is just getting worse.” His damaged angel is dying. “They need to-.” He sobs and puts his head in his hands. “How could I not -.” How could he not know? How could he be such an awful mate. “He’s dying, Nat. I didn’t even ask to see him before they brought him to surgery.”
When Tony walks back into the room with a tray laden with food and a steaming mug, Steve’s sitting on the side of the bed, staring down at his bare feet.
Tony rolls his eyes. Why did he program this AI to be overly sassy. “I apologize to your electrons. Tell me what’s the scoop.”
“Then bring Strange here,” Tony says and taps his fingers on his thigh. “I don’t need to go anywhere.”
Stane’s large paw lands on Tony’s shoulder. “Power corrupts, Tony. You know that, I know that. Don’t you think it’s already corrupted you? I mean look at you with your little whore who happens to be hiding in the other room.” Steve hides again, cursing himself for being found out. “You think hiring a hooker is something someone of virtue would do? You’re not a knight in shining armor Tony. It’s about time you come to realize you’re ruthless like your father, like me. We raised you right. You know what to do. We make the final strike at the end of the week.” He pats Tony’s shoulder and then calls out, “You can come out now and suck his dick or whatever it is he wants you to do. Just remember your place.”
“You bastard Steve Rogers,” Tony replies but it has no heat to it. “I don’t regret it. I don’t regret having Morgan and finding that happiness.”
“But he survived it,” Steve said. The conviction in his voice might have partly been for her, but mainly it was for himself. He wanted to believe that the hell of what happened on the roof with Tony would be something they could put behind them. Just like Steve planned on putting what happened in that dark, little room with those nameless vampires away. He would close it away, gather up all the misfortune and pain and lock it, imprison it as it tried to imprison him. His fists clenched, and he forced himself to relax, to open his hands. Even the small motion ate away at what energy he had.
“You like it when you can’t move, when I can do whatever I want to you. You give yourself over to me so completely, my sweet heart. I can’t believe I deserve you,” Tony said and licked at the wound on his throat again, releasing him from the frozen state.
“I know enough that you invited him into our little pack, didn’t you?” Sam said and turned over Steve’s wrist to display two new marks. One of them connected to the wrist band and wove down but stayed separate from the others. The other one tangled through Steve’s wrist mark and shot through all of the others and continued up Steve’s arm. He peered at it and then realized it didn’t stop on his arm.
“There’s extra toothbrushes in the bathroom.” Tony points. “I sometimes drop them in the toilet and so I need extra. Top left drawer of the vanity. Hope you like spearmint toothpaste.”
Biting his lip, Steve follows as the despair dissipates and the hope and happiness take root again. He should tear those emotions out, rip them to shreds, but he cannot deny how wonderful it makes him feel. Steeling himself, Steve enters the prince’s quarters and searches around for him. After a moment, he calls out, “Tony?”
