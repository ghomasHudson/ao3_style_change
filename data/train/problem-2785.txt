“What the hell is the Shadow?”
Anyway, I hope you guys are ready for the rescue on Friday!!!

Castiel remained frozen where he was, barely breathing.
Dean could see his eyes growing distant, how he flinched at the echo of his own screams, how he looked ready to curl in on himself or bolt back to the fantasy he had created for himself. Anything to feel safe, anything to get away from this memory.
When Dean and Miracle got back to the Bunker, Jack was there, sitting still as a statue in a chair in the library.
Dean kissed him in equal regard, gently and with all the love in his body, letting them both savor it. They had time now, all the time in the world.
“Jack?”
“You don’t have to, if you don’t want to, it’s just—”
Major work done Jan 01-06, Jan 13
“Sam? Sammy?”
Sam was silent for a long moment before he said, “God is a woman.”
“But I couldn’t see myself with a dog before her either. I guess it was more… She needed someone. And I think we needed—
“Dammit, you scared me.”
Love him. Love him
Dean felt a rush of relief and affection and pure giddiness course through his veins as he ran the short distance to Castiel. He stopped a few places short, just to be certain that his eyes weren’t playing tricks on him. Castiel was here on the ground, mere steps away. His face was slack and his eyes were closed, but when Dean finally built up the nerve to touch him, he was solid and real.
Once again, Dean had the striking feeling that he was running out of time. What if he couldn’t wake Cas?
He gave Dean a smile, happy and sad at the same time but overwhelmingly warm. Almost beatific. He looked so much like Castiel in that moment that it took everything to keep from sobbing, to bury the raw emotion until it was safe to feel again.
slip up and be blatantly in love. Sooner or later, Dean will be uncomfortable with that and reject him. Castiel would rather leave of his own accord than wait to be pushed away. He doesn't think he'll be asked to stay, but maybe it's better that way. They can be friends still. He can love at a distance, just as he always has.]
, he was sure, and Dean couldn’t interact with him? He still couldn’t be heard? He still couldn’t change anything?
“Dammit, Cas, no.”
Dean went back to his room to start making space for Miracle’s things only to see himself in his mirror and freeze. There was a handprint on his shoulder, marked in blood. Slowly, Dean slotted his hand over the mark, aligning the fingers with his own.
“How long did you know? That you… Were you ever going to tell me?”
Jack is back, and the boys figure out a way to bring Castiel back, but is the cost too high?
“What about when
“Maybe,” Cas admitted, “but he’ll always be our little boy.”
Castiel started to cry and Dean wanted nothing more than to close the distance between them and wipe the tears away with the pad of his thumb. So, he did. Soon enough, Castiel was enveloped in his arms, holding him as though he would drown otherwise. Dean held him tighter.
“Dean isn’t answering,” he both spoke and signed.
“Like a brother, I know.”
“He’s probably just getting used to being human,” Sam tried to explain. “It’s a big change, and there’s nothing wrong with him wanting to figure himself out a little. Besides, he’s always been a little come-and-go.”
I hate it too but hey it's Monday so things can only get better, yeah?
Dean looked over and saw his brother very still, eyes still glued to the screen.
something!”
“Come on, Cas, I’ll get you some fresh clothes.”
Dean started worrying again.
Jack didn’t need to be told twice. Sam set down the dish he was drying in favor of starting the popcorn.
“Just…” he tossed the remote to Sam and picked up the empty popcorn bowl. “Pick a damn movie.”
“That he did,” other Dean said, walking by with bags in his hands on his way to the kitchen. “And he bought seven dollars worth of nougat.”
“It’s a nice place you have here,” he started. Castiel kept milling around, ignoring him, but Dean didn’t mind. He had time now, all the time in the world to say what he needed to.
“It scares me, how fast it’s going,” Castiel admitted when he found his words. “I remember when he first started to crawl, and his first word, and now look at him, running around and talking whenever he isn’t asleep. He’s already growing up so fast.”
“I’m not letting him rot in there another day if I can help it.”
It's done!!! I hope you enjoyed this!!!
“Yeah, course.” Sam whistled and after a final lick Miracle followed him out of the room.
In the future, I plan on adding to this as
“And that fixes things?”
“Please be careful, Dean,” Jack mumbled.
“’M comfy here, Momma.”
“He needs to come back.”
“I think Sam was right,” Jack said abruptly.
Jan 09 11:10 to Jan 18 05:21
With Sam in Hell, Dean and Jack spend some time together. Dean realizes that losing Cas left a bigger impact than he thought.
Dean hesitated even more at Cas’ clipped tone. This wasn’t how he expected their first conversation to go, now that Cas was back.
“I was talking to Sam and…” Jack stepped in and put the tray on the table by Dean. “He told me that you and Cas have a profound bond.” Jack perched himself on the corner of the bed, knees drawn up to his chest. “And I was there when Cas made his deal, to…to save me. He made me promise not to tell you, or Sam. He didn’t want you to worry, or me.”
“Good,” Dean parroted back. Castiel nodded somberly and turned back to the wall, and Dean let the façade crumble. Maybe family was all they were ever meant to be.
, Sam.”
“Then I was right. You do everything for love.”
Before long, Castiel nodded off, and not long after, Dean fell asleep embraced by his angel.
Dean hummed a response. He knew what this was like, how it had to be for Cas. “Do you want to talk about it? The, uh…”
“Cas, you gotta talk to me, or this isn’t going to work.”
The next memory was dark. Dean could feel rain kissing his skin and looked up. It was night, and he was in a cold alleyway among apartments. He turned, looking for someone he knew had to be here somewhere and his breath stopped.
“You got up early,” Dean commented as he slid into a seat across from Cas. “Missed you.”
“We’ll be back in a little bit,” Sam promised Castiel. “Tell Dean not to wait up for dinner.”
“Son of a bitch,” he breathed after a moment. Jack looked up and Dean confirmed, “It
“Of course.” He stood and stretched his arms upwards and Dean watched his t-shirt ride up above his hip bones. “But first, I’m going to shower.”
“He’s always done it before. Come hell or high water, no matter what he has to do, Cas always manages. I trust him to fight. To come back.”
“No.” Jack shifted, his gaze sharpening as though he would stare into Dean’s very soul. “Do you think that?”
“Oh. Yes, I thought it might be a nice change.”
“It’s not
It didn’t take Jack long to transcribe it. He set his pencil down and pushed the message back over to Dean.
would it really be destiel fanfiction if there wasn't just a little man pain and "you're like family"??? no.
“Another!”
happened, and the jacket smelled heavily of the cedar dresser, but Dean couldn’t help but feel calmer in it as he headed down to the dungeon.
Dean looked at it again in thought. “What if the capital and lowercase letters are the As and Bs? Maybe he wrote it out so that A was lowercase, and capital was B?”
“No, thank you.”
Dean’s confusion grew exponentially. “I told you that I needed you, Cas. That you could have me.”
[more softness, but their kid is *god* so he has to give the tough truth]
“I speak or read nearly everything,” Castiel replied easily, setting the book down. “Human languages are simple.”
“She just wanted freedom and peace, like you and Sam,” Jack explained. “She trusted you, but you were willing to kill her, and it hurt. She wanted to trust Chuck, but he was the same.”
Castiel was wrong. He hadn’t done everything out of love. If he had, he never would have pushed Cas away.
Jack turned back to Castiel and told Dean, “Go eat. I’ll still be here.”
“Are you sure you want to do that?” Jack asked, hands frozen in the act of preparing cereal.
Ahead, Dean made out a faint, dark figure and froze. It didn’t move, didn’t make a sound, and but it looked familiar. He drew closer and the prone figure became recognizable even before he could make out the tan of the trenchcoat.
Sam was on the phone in the library, but upon seeing his brother put an end to his conversation. Dean didn’t know what he expected: to be chastised, perhaps, or to be forced through a heart-to-heart. Worse, to have Sam look at him with pity without saying a damn thing. Instead, his brother wrapped him in a brief hug.
Thank you to
“He is very cute,” Cas agreed, letting his gaze linger fondly.
Dean decides to take a big step in their relationship.
“How’d you sleep?” he asked Castiel, who, no longer in conversation with Eileen, was nursing his coffee. He turned slowly, obviously still in need of another cup.
back,” Dean snarled. Why was that? Why did Satan himself deserve to come back again and again and
Cas turned back at Dean’s soft voice and suddenly felt the tears brimming in his eyes. Quickly, he wiped them away.
Dean flipped the channel just in time to catch the start of a Looney Tunes episode. Remembering Castiel’s past interest in the cartoons, he left it there.
“Are you sure, Cas? I mean—”
“Maybe you can decode them today. Not much to do while Sam’s downstairs.”
Jack nodded in agreement as Dean shook his head.
“’S ‘kay,” Cas assured him, mindlessly patting Dean’s hand, oblivious to the blood still seeping through.
Castiel reached across the table and ran his fingers through Dean’s hair. Dean swore he could still feel the crackles of grace in his touch.
“You know you can add to it, right? You don’t have to drink it black.”
“I want you to keep it.”
“He hurt someone close to us,” he replied. “We had… His name was Jack.”
“Maybe not. But you make a very good human.”
“I like feeling your heartbeat,” he’d said once. “It’s steady. Calming.”
“If Cas was human, he wouldn’t go to the Empty when he died. It wouldn’t have a claim on him because he wouldn’t belong there anymore.”
“We’re engaged,” Sam announced, and the room filled with congratulations, even from Castiel himself.
Sam and Jack were still waiting on the other side of the door and rushed towards them as Dean stumbled through the doorway, Jack quickly closing it behind them. Sam lifted the invisibility spell on him as Dean laid Castiel on the table, and Jack pressed his fingers against Cas’ temples.
“You’re not real.”
Dean felt guilt wash over him, unbearably heavy, and walked away. The Great Fall? That had to have been years ago, when Sam was doing the trials and the angels were cast out. He and Sam had hardly been there for Cas; Dean had kicked Castiel out, for fuck’s sake. What the hell had he told Jack?
“You haven’t gotten to solve that one either?”
“What? Why?”
“Cas always has been,” Dean said gently, rising from his chair and pulling Jack in for a one-armed hug. “As soon as he met you, he said you’d be good.”
and that’s not okay. You don’t deserve that; you’ve
“It’s a little too…”
[Miscommunication? >:) maybe Cas backtracks]
want?” Dean asked after a beat. “I mean, you didn’t want to be human, or stuck like this. Even with me and Sam and Jack, this can’t be something you wanted.”
“Your…your confession. You told me all that and then you friggin’
Jack’s smile was broad, hopeful. Dean couldn’t help himself from returning it.
“Are you angry with me? For making you human?”
Dean stumbled backwards, horrified. The darkness consumed him once again, almost soothingly. It was better than whatever he had just seen. What had it—Was it a memory? That…that had been Castiel—
It didn’t take long for Sam to call Rowena and get some things together. She agreed to teach Sam as much witchcraft as he needed to know and invited him to stay down in Hell while he was learning. “
“I don’t know,” Jack said truthfully. “I’m new at this, Dean, but we’re running out of time to find other ways to save him. I don’t even think he could pass through my rift as an angel—Amara said that rifts have rules. Especially in places like that.”
Also, I feel so bad to have killed a woman from Supernatural, and I did it to reveal a male villain to and further a male storyline which makes it even worse, I'm so sorry please forgive me I promise there's some saileen content next chapter to help make up for it
He sank into the chair next to Castiel, the same arrangement they had when they shared a drink together, and watched at the other him came back in with Jack. Was time different here?
“You don’t have to do it alone this time. We’re all here for you.”
Dean slid into the seat across from him at breakfast and thought about bringing it up when Cas beat him to it.
“Kid, I think you’re doing enough good even without bringing her back. Cas said she was happy—”
Jack mournfully shook his head. “All I did was wake him up. Castiel fought to get out all on his own.”
The rest of the day was uneventful, with Castiel basically avoiding him. Late in the night, Dean woke fresh from a nightmare and heard voices. Castiel. Maybe Cas was in the same situation, maybe he too wanted a distraction from dreaming. The light spilling out from under his door seemed to suggest that. Against his better judgement, he came to a stop outside of Cas’ room instead of continuing towards the DeanCave.
,” Castiel said dryly, peeling off his blazer in turn, and hanging all of the wet garments at the top of the steps. Even at a distance, Dean could see water dripping off the dress shirt.
“Jack, uh, how about you go get dressed. We can do something today.”
“So, where’s this other code you were talking about?”
“What’s wrong with him?” Dean asked impatiently as Jack’s golden glow vanished, his own stress starting to rise.
He wandered out into the library, looking for Miracle and pointedly ignoring everything else when he stopped.
“You’re sure there’s no other way?”
“What? No.”
A lie.
“What?”
Jack nodded and Dean realized where Sam was going with a sinking feeling.
“You’re being sent back. They’re going to help you. Restore your faith. Then, maybe, you can return to us.”
[Memories sequentially]
Bacon. It’s a Baconian cipher.”
for telling me I should go through with the codes!
Castiel didn’t stir, and Dean buried his face among the blankets alongside him and sobbed.
“You do, too, you know. You deserve to be saved. You deserve to be happy, and cared for, and alive, and loved.”
Dean flinched at the harshness of his tone, but he knew something wasn't right. “Cas?”
Sam let out a shaky breath when Jack was gone, and Dean saw the tear treads running down his brother’s face. Down both of their faces. He pulled Sam into a hug, though even he wasn’t sure who it was meant to comfort.
“Then you see the problem. The monsters aren’t monsters like we thought – they’re just people put in circumstances beyond their control. They still have souls and I think we should let them rest like we do with the humans. Rowena agrees. She says that the only real monsters are the people who turn themselves into one. Those are the people who will go to Hell.”
“The figures. Silhouettes,” Dean said, but Castiel shook his head.
Unfortunately, I cannot find screenshots so this is guesstimation
“Sam said you hadn’t been getting enough lately,” Jack said without looking up. “I thought it’d be best.”
He had a lot to make up for.
“This is yours,” Dean said, taking off the necklace and holding it out.
Dean swallowed thickly as emotion rose within him, but managed to keep pushing it down, holding it back. He would deal with it later, once he was alone in his room and sure that Sam wouldn’t walk in. He finished cooking up the burgers and took a few steps over to where he had already laid out the plates and hamburger buns.
(See the end of the chapter for
Castiel groaned at the pressure on his chest, eyes fluttering open.
“What?”
“How could Akobel have betrayed Heaven in such a manner? Fathering a nephil is forbidden. How could he know and still disobey?” the woman in a green dress asked.
“I know. But I want a chance to be…a family.”
A spark caught in Jack’s eye and he shifted into a cross-legged position before continuing. “Cas was happy enough, before. None of this takes away from our memories with him. But confessing to you, that was being honest and true to himself. He was able to be accept himself and be happy
The first day was the hardest.
Cas' eyes were huge and uncertain, seeing nothing and everything. He wasn’t just hugging back; he was clinging to Jack with an expression Dean recognized: he was overwhelmed, lost. Given the circumstances, who wouldn’t be?
choice to begin with. It should be Cas’ and he wouldn’t want this.”
The words didn’t even echo. It was like they were absorbed by the air itself. Everything was empty. There was no sensation. No light, no sound, no motion. Dean could barely tell if there was an up or a down, or if the floor he walked on was real. Maybe Sam had been right about doing more research, but this was a place where one could go mad.
Dean’s heart dropped as Jack’s gaze fell on him. He looked so much like Cas, and now it seemed that they both saw through him with ease. It wasn’t too long ago he remembered Castiel saying the same exact thing.
with him so can you blame him for backtracking a little
A few lines down, there was a second of a similar nature.
would happen if we decided to survive more? To love harder?
[Jack convo. Cas is the best fucking dad. Maybe Dean makes smiley pancakes because fuck canon]
His smile grew wider and infected the other two even as Sam groaned. “I think we can figure something out.”
His family, immortalized in the wood of the table. His fingers traced his mother’s initials absently in thought. Family didn’t end in blood, and the Bunker had been a home to far more than just the Winchesters. They deserved to have their legacy remembered, too.
“We know the Empty is like the asphodel meadows, right?”
“Yeah!”
“Which one are you on?”
“Come on, Cas,” Dean breathed. “You made it through this before, remember? Waking up should be the easy part.”
Castiel was in here, somewhere, and Dean wasn’t going to leave without him.
Castiel looked deep into his mug as though it held all of the answers. Softly, he offered, “I'm afraid I might not have been truthful, when I said we were like family. I was worried about what it would be like, what
Dean looked down at the paper. Jack’s scrawl was messy, but he could clearly make sense of what had once been nonsense.
Dean was stunned. “All the misery you went through, and you think it was good? Seriously?”
Dean and Cas both looked up, only to see…Dean.
Dean made a thin slice on Castiel’s neck, wincing even though Cas didn’t stir. The grace went easily into a simple little vial on a chain, and it struck Dean how simple it was to make an angel fall. The loss of grace, that bright little spark of energy, was truly all that set angels and humans apart, in a sense. Without it, Castiel bled, and Dean wiped a smear of it away before bandaging the cut. The necklace he slipped over his head and tucked under his shirt. He was surprised he could feel its power through the vial. Grace was a strange sensation: a warm buzz tingling throughout his skin, much like being sated or tipsy. A comfort. He had taken that from Castiel, even if there was no other choice.
“Sure, buddy. Go for it.”
“Cas? Come on, man. Please hear me.”
“How the fuck could you do that to me?”
When they got back, Sam seemed just as disturbed as Dean felt. The world had fundamentally changed, and it was like it hadn’t. The world went on, every moment passed as though there wasn’t a throbbing ache in Dean’s chest. They had lost their son and best friend. They were alone all over again, just like those first few lonely years when they had been looking for John.
“No, I—”
With that, his body went limp, his hand falling away limply. Dean pulled him close, desperate to keep his angel with him as his body lit up one final time.
“Hey guys!” Sam entered quickly and pulled a yogurt out of the refrigerator, clearly just back from his morning run with Miracle hot on his heels. Dean could have killed him.
“Jack, he was never under Chuck’s control,” Dean said, softly.
“Purgatory wasn’t… It never was a heaven. It was cruel. People who were turned, who never had a chance, just got stuck there. It wasn’t fair to them.”
“Miracle.”
Dean could never get him to stay, and why would he now that they were all free to live as they wanted? Why would Castiel stick around when he had a whole new world to explore?
“Hey, Sammy?” Sam looked up from his research. “What do you say we add some names?”
“I need you. Cas, please. Come back to me.”
At first, Dean thought he was alone. Standing up at the top of the stairwell, looking down into the library below, he saw nothing. The halls were empty and cold, so he stepped forwards into the library. Each shelf of books was just like they were in real life, and each little nook between them was empty except—
“Are you ready?” he asked, face still full of concern.
“Do it. He’ll love them.”
“Pancakes sound good to you?”
It didn’t.
All codes done Feb 7-8
“A nephil,” Jack corrected.
First thing finished, no blocking notes
Dean nodded, staring at it intently. There was something, some pattern to the madness on the paper, but he couldn’t figure out what he saw until it clicked.
“It’s okay,” Dean murmured, ushering some calm into Cas’ eyes. “It’ll come back to you. Just focus on me, alright?”
Dean slid a hand on Cas’ knee, and Cas placed his own on top until they pulled into the garage of the Bunker.
as a starting point if you're interested!!!
Dean nodded, even knowing Castiel couldn’t see it.
Castiel gave him his trademark squinty eyes, illuminated by the light of his own grace and the soft yellow tones of a lamp by the bed.
“Goodbye.”
Sam helped him to his room and stayed with him until he fell asleep, listening and shushing him in equal regard. With his eyes bleary and full of unshed tears, Dean thought the silhouette of Sam in the extra chair looked almost like Castiel, and he took comfort in that for a few minutes.
“Bullshit.”
“The others will stay behind to return the bodies to Heaven,” the man promised, and the women nodded. Dean’s brow furrowed. Heaven? So, they were angels, but how did he know that voice?
“You’re finally free. That’s what you wanted, isn’t it? You can…do whatever you want, like sleep in or have an…apple pie life.” He said the words carefully, as though he didn’t know what they meant. It was a strange mix of childlike innocence and cosmic omniscience.
“Bring him back,” he choked. “Please, Jack. Bring Cas back.”
“That’s where you’re wrong, Sammy.” Dean grinned, feeling more certain with every moment. “We have a witch in training, the new God, and a guy who’s been to the Empty and back.”
Cas’ face paled, almost as if that would be preferable.
“Yeah!”
Dean got out the frying pan and started cooking.
you give it to me?”
Dean felt an emptiness settle inside of him. That did sound like Cas.
Look, we are not unspectacular things.
“Alright.”
They owed the kid some normalcy, especially after everything.
“He would want you to make a deal instead?” Sam cut in.
Dean nodded and stretched his stiff, half-numb legs before standing. Cas’ grace bounced against his chest and for a second he thought about giving it to Castiel.
“So, you saved her.”
“’S mine?”
“Maybe he just needs to rest?” Sam suggested, ever level-headed. Dean could see the fear lingering in his eyes as well, but he also kept it hidden for Jack’s sake. “Losing his grace had to have taken a toll, right? Maybe he’ll just sleep it off, and in the meantime, we can look for ways to wake him.”
Something must have gone through, or maybe he just wanted it badly enough, because Dean felt a pull in his chest. He didn’t know how much longer he kept walking, but the pull grew with every step.
Cas’ voice was so soft that Dean couldn’t quite make out what was said, and he was about to knock before someone replied.
“Cas?” he tried again, still to no result.
Castiel looked unwell, with a pallid face and wide eyes. His chest rose and fell too rapidly for the restfulness of sleep, but the deep furrow of his brow softened in the warm amber.
“I would like to come back,” Jack added suddenly. “With you and Sam and…”
“If that was what you wanted.”
“The being in the Empty,” Jack explained. “It’s not going to give him up willingly, you’re going to have to sneak him out.”
“Cas?” It was barely even a whisper, laden with both hope and fear.
The day passed quickly and Dean could feel excitement bursting in his chest.
“But… It’s not in As and Bs…”
“Yes. I think a place of my own would…”
“It’s not that I don’t want to… I’m not sure I have the words.”
“You said what you had to in order to get me back.”
“Alright, we had Crowley for me, that British woman for Mom, and Cas for you. We’re already batting zero here.”
Dean nodded. He could only imagine the stress of running Heaven, the burden placed on a child before Amara had stepped up. He needed to thank her for that, for allowing Jack to come home and be a child for a little while.
“Here’s what you asked for,” Jack said, holding out a silver vial on a chain.
Dec 11 00:05-03:53
Jack gave a small smile and looked to the ground. “We talked before I left, Dean. She doesn’t trust me fully, but giving her space will help.” Proudly, he added, “We’re getting to know each other. Now that this is all over.”
The memory collapsed and Dean found himself in the dark, alone. Was this how Cas had felt when he left the Bunker? This nagging, out-of-place feeling... Dean knew where to go, he could see it, but he didn’t have the power to make it there. He was afraid of what he would find and how he would be received. After everything Dean had seen,
“Look, I get it, Jack. You’re a kid, and you’ve grown up too fast, but…” Dean exhaled slowly, trying to pick his words carefully. What would he have told himself thirty years ago? “I know what it’s like, to be pinned down by destiny and expectations. I know you didn’t ask for this, and that this is a lot, but you’re a good kid. You care so much about everyone and everything.
“I can take the necklace off, if you’d like.”
“Uh, I don’t know if you’ve heard, but Jack’s kinda the new God.” Dean let out a breathless chuckle. “Who would have thought? Us parenting God. But, uh, turns out you were right. About him, and his destiny.”
“Would you like some?”
“I wouldn’t have given it to you if I didn’t. It’s a piece of me, yes, but it’s hardly my whole life… I’m still me.”
“Cas? Hey, it’s just a memory.”
, which is what started this all.
“Cas?” he whispered. “Castiel?”
Castiel shrugged, clearly not about to change his mind.
“What? No.”
When they stayed in the Bunker, Castiel had a habit of resting the hand usually on Dean’s shoulder by his grace instead, where it rested on Dean’s chest. At first, Dean had thought it was regret, that Cas was considering taking back his grace in spite of the risks, but as soon as he voiced that fear, Castiel was quick to dissuade him.
Eileen looked up from her conversation to smile at Dean, and only a minute later directed that same smile but brighter at Sam as he slid her a plate with a waffle before taking the seat beside her.
“Right.” Dean looked between the two of them and Miracle still sitting in her chair. “I need a drink.”
Neither Castiel nor Jack showed up.
“Is that…something you want?”
Like clockwork, the door at the top of the stairs swung open and in walked Cas, Jack, and Miracle, all soaked and muddy.
“Ready?”
“I know, sweetheart.”
“I’m sorry, but we can’t bring back Mary.”
“That’s not quite how that works…”
[Drunk and thinky thoughts. Process your grief dude. Ugly, breathless sobs. We’re going all out. We pass the entire night with him; he leaves his room come morning, still a little fucked and hungover. He hasn’t bothered to shave or change.]
“Was that your true form then?”
He wandered through the memory of a movie night just as quickly. He was there for it, every moment, even though he hadn’t noticed Castiel slipping a coded message into Jack’s hand. Dean didn’t have the time to see it all again. He could feel himself getting closer to the center of this labyrinth, and he wanted to get Cas out.
***Not a Chapter!***
Dean stopped walking, and Miracle plopped herself down and whimpered, eager to continue their walk.
“We’ll be back,” other Dean promised as he and Jack headed to the garage.
After seeing Sam off, Dean walked into the kitchen and found Jack sitting there with a bowl of Krunch Cookie Crunch.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Hey.” Cas turned and squinted at him, eyes tired and unfocused. “Wanna hit the hay?”
“No, Cas, I mean…
In the dark, everything was stripped away. Suddenly, Dean was hyperaware of how he was sharing a bed for the first time in years. More than that, as minutes ticked by, he grew more aware of how tense Castiel was. At first, he thought it was just nerves, the same trepidation that bubbled under his own skin, but he came to realize there was more to it. Dean could feel every shift of Cas’ body as though it was his own.
They had burgers that night. Well, burgers and that weird fake chicken soy patty that Sam had picked up at the store. They made small talk as they ate. Sam talked about Eileen, Jack talked about Heaven and all that he’d seen, Dean talked about Miracle and some of the tricks he’d taught her.
Jack stared down at the decoded message, worrying his lip. “Do you think he knows how much I love him?”
“Absolutely.”
Castiel frowned deeply. “I don’t… I don’t remember very well, but we were ordered to kill innocents and I refused. At least then. You know what happened to May Sunder.” He kicked at a drift of sand and watched it collapse and disappear. “They took me away when they realized I wouldn’t do it and hurt me after that. I think it was the first time I saw Naomi, but I… I can’t be sure.”
Dean wrapped Castiel in a hug one final time within the safety of his mind. Then he sent a silent prayer to Jack and felt Castiel disappear within his arms before he himself followed suit. He came back to himself slowly, his whole body consumed by pins and needles that eventually retreated. He could feel Sam’s hand on his shoulder.
Jack buried his face in the rough twill of Dean’s jacket, which still bore the imprint of Castiel’s final farewell, before Sam’s hand fell on his shoulder and he let go.

Dean rubbed at the back of his neck and was about to step out to let Cas get changed when he felt the chain of the grace necklace. It was Castiel’s, and he wanted to return it.
“Always,” Jack said with a nod. “He always knew what was going on in my head…what to say.”
“What?”
“Alright, I’ll bite. How?” Dean asked, stepping forward.
Castiel—and the others that had killed Lily Sunder’s daughter. It
“Of course,” he replied, but his voice was strained.
“Cas, what the hell. Don’t you want to get out of here?”
Dean heard the sound of wings and looked back to see that Jack was gone.
Dec 15 10:47 to Jan 3 01:32
Things didn’t get easier. With every day that went by, Dean could practically feel the gap between himself and Castiel widen. It was maddening, yet there was no way to express it. It was about more than feelings; Dean could keep going on repressing his feelings like he had for most of his life. What he couldn't do was lose his best friend yet again.
“Not today,” Castiel replied, finishing his mug and staring at the dregs. “I was going to decode Jack’s messages.”
he reminded himself.
“No,” Jack said, looking about as ill as Dean felt. “Sam’s right.”
Dean shrugged, not willing to admit that it might have been the other way around.
“Don’t you?” Dean shot back. “I got your dad killed. My best friend.”
“Can you wake him again? Or open a door, or whatever?” Dean hated how desperate he sounded but if Jack could do it…
with me. Share a room.”
As soon as they got back to the Bunker, Dean started making a home for Miracle. He gathered some spare blankets before having an epiphany: she could just sleep with him. She would love the bed, and he would love having her there with him.
The next day, Dean slept until almost noon. When he stuck his head in to check on Cas, he saw that Jack was still there, no longer in pajamas, and that Miracle had curled up by Cas’ legs and was sleeping soundly.
Castiel, on the other hand, looked blissfully happy. He outstretched his hand to Dean’s own and his long, deft fingers curled around Dean’s.
“Alright, you guys gotta get her cleaned up before you do anything else.”
Dean – was at a loss. He didn’t remember this at all. Hell, he didn’t know that Castiel knew what ciphers were, let alone wrote them, until a few weeks ago. This couldn’t be a memory, but then what was it? It wasn't real.
He started to pass figures. All were slumped on the floor in various states of disarray. Some writhed in the throes of nightmares while others remained as still as marble sculptures decorating a sepulcher. All were unconscious.
, which I am ashamed to say I didn’t know before.
Sam seemed to realize what he had walked into and made himself scarce, and dammit was Dean grateful for that as he kissed Cas’ the way he had been wanting to, felt Cas’ fingers creep up into the hair at the nape of his neck. The grace around Dean’s neck was warm and bright and thrumming with love and for the first time in a long time, Dean felt happy.

For a while, Castiel
“Morning!” Sam greeted brightly. “She got in about an hour ago. Working a case not far from here, thought she’d stop by.”
“No… It’s been busy. Upstairs.”
Jack looked anything but disappointed to hear that.
“It’s
“Cas, hey, look at me.
Probably Jan 13 to Feb 17
They went down to Dean’s room first, and Dean quickly pulled together a few outfits, enough to last Cas a few days until they went shopping. Then they crossed the hall to Cas’ room, where he started putting them away.
[make a spooning joke you gotta]
“The day he died.”
It wasn’t always bad, but tonight, only a few days after the grace discussion, Dean’s thoughts were far too loud. Though Castiel was nearly asleep beside him, memories of black goo and blood and solitude were bursting from his head, begging to be spoken.
There was his angel.
Castiel’s mug hit the table with a resounding thud and his eyes went wide. At last, he understood.
Castiel looked beautiful in that moment, scruffy and on his second cup of coffee, with wild hair and bright eyes. He wore Dean’s pajama’s still, even though they had gone on a shopping trip to get him a whole wardrobe a week ago. Maybe that was why Dean was finally able to ask him the question that had been on the tip of his tongue for days.
quirks.
“You do,” Castiel said, shifting onto his side.
Dean was surprised that there was a list of messages on the page but was grateful that they weren’t encrypted yet.
“No, there has to be a way. There’s
side for once.” Dean turned to Jack, who looked uncomfortable, prompting Dean to ask, “What?”
“Okay,” Jack sighed, sounding far more exasperated than a child should be able to.
Dean had forced Jack to be more than a child. At first, he’d thought it was the right thing. He remembered pride swelling in his small chest whenever John had treated him like an adult. While his peers were in the Boy Scouts, Dean earned his badges of merit practicing his shooting, caring for Sam, hustling pool, all to get a contented slap on the shoulder if he was lucky. He had been content with that and had longed (at first) to be more like the man he was expected to be.
“Cas, wake up!” He was silent for a long minute to ensure his noise was the only noise, but Castiel didn’t stir. He tried again. “Hey! Cas!”
“What?”
“Cas?” He slapped at his cheek a little, feeling dread rise within him as Castiel kept sleeping. Dean didn’t want to be the one to do this; he didn’t want to be the one to remove Cas’ grace and drag him back down to humanity. It should be Castiel’s choice, his own conscious decision instead of an action taken by necessity. There was nothing else to do though: Jack had made it clear that the Empty would never stop coming for Castiel as an angel. He couldn’t even pass through the portal. That knowledge didn’t make it any easier.
“Good.”
cry, unlike Sam and Jack. No, he just had something in his eyes. A lot of something. He left for a few minutes to get more popcorn only to find Jack inconsolable.
“As long as he’s an angel, he will always go back to the Empty and it will always have a claim on him.”
Castiel was cold in Dean’s arms when it was over, though maybe it was because his chest was smoldering still. He could still feel that heat as he watched Cas burn a day later. He could still feel the heaviness of him, how hard he’d fought to keep him in his arms and how he’d longed to crawl into the pyre and burn with him.
Alright, so this is going to be a bit of a mess, I’m going to split it up by chapter!
“So, no more monster heaven?”
Castiel didn’t respond well to the cold, dark,
that he is
Jack nodded thoughtfully. “Then I want to write him some messages. Like he does for me.”
The glow of grace faded as Dean stepped through the doorway and back into the bright bunker. Cas’ grace, though safe around Dean’s neck, was gone. He was human, maybe permanently, unless they could find another way to keep him safe. Dean grieved for a moment for how Castiel had been. He grieved the choice that Castiel hadn’t gotten to make. It was a steep price to pay, but he hoped that Cas understood. He hoped Cas could forgive them.
Castiel let out a world-weary sigh. “I know.”
“Do you still blame me for the first time he went to the Empty? When I was born?”
, Dean. And when he wakes up, he’ll be able to finally live however he wants. He’ll be free, just like you.”
“Exactly.”
from the
For a little while, he dared to hope that by flooring it on the open road, with music blasting from the radio, Dean might be able to escape his grief. They could go anywhere, do anything. He and Sam had earned the right to a fresh start after at least three apocalypses, but Dean didn’t know if that was what he wanted. How could he start over if his best friend was dead and their kid was gone? He might still have Sam, but what about the rest of his family? Didn’t they all deserve the chance to begin again?
Sam made sure Jack came with him to research. Better to keep the kid occupied than let him worry. Dean took Castiel to room 15 on his own. He set him on his bed, made sure he would be comfortable, draped a blanket over him. For all intents and purposes, it looked like Castiel was just taking a nap, yet it set Dean on edge. He didn’t know what it was, but something felt off. Wrong.
Dean turned away and bit his lip, hard. Tasting blood, he took his utility jacket off and folded it neatly before putting it in a drawer out of sight. He was too sober for this.
“I can’t… I can’t hear your yearning anymore,” Castiel said, almost nonchalantly, but Dean could hear the sadness and uncertainty there. “You’re going to have to tell me what you’re feeling.”
—gave a final wave with that little smile still on his face. He faded away into light, true to his word about being everywhere, but Dean saw him mouth
As if on cue, Jack appeared in the Bunker right by Miracle, who barked in surprise.
“Last time I was human… The biggest issue was the loneliness. I didn’t have anyone I could trust or talk to. My brothers and sisters resented me. I didn’t have a home. I didn’t quite know who I was, didn’t have a mission or a purpose... It was jarring, to say the least. Overwhelming.” Castiel paused in thought for a moment. “But it was different. A good different.”
Two chapters left!!!
Dean – the
“A little bit,” Castiel confessed without looking up. “But my... my grace was failing already. I knew I would end up like this, if I survived. So, I guess... I guess I’m not angry with you. I’m glad to be alive. To get more time with Jack, and you, and Sam... I just... I wish I had a choice in what happened.”
a way. You were a law student, aren’t agreements like this right up your alley?”
“It’s not,” Dean answered quickly, and he heard Cas’ dry laugh in response.
Dean’s mind ran rampant. Of everything he had worried about, in all of his nightmares, this had never come up. “I’m real.
The days passed slowly. Sam reached out to their friends one by one, finding with relief that everyone was back, alive and safe. Sam had damn near cried when Eileen answered a video call, voice bright and face beaming. Charlie confirmed that her girlfriend Stevie was back. Garth and his family were okay, too. Everyone they could think to contact was back, Heaven seemed to be in order, and Rowena confirmed that Hell was back in business. Only one person was still gone.
Miracle whimpered and Dean rubbed at her head to soothe the both of them.
“Days? Weeks? Sam, it’s already been two months.”
“I know you don’t like it. I don’t like it either. I know how it feels to lose your grace, to suddenly be completely human, and I hate knowing we have to do that to Cas but…”
He went to his room and slid the vial into his jacket, the one still marked by Castiel’s handprint.
“I still haven’t figured out one. He apologized for making it harder and wanted to help, but I said I would get it.” Jack hesitated for a moment before adding, “He gave me another the day he…”
In Chapter 8, I asked if anyone would be interested in seeing some of my notes / etc so here they are!
“Sam.” He looked up to his brother and discretely nodded towards Cas. He saw comprehension flit across his face before nodding to the dog still in his lap. “Wanna help me get her out of here?”
“Yeah,” Castiel replied, swallowing and tugging at his tie to loosen it. “I know… I…”
Dean tore his eyes up to Cas’ face, still slack and sleepy.
He couldn’t breathe. It was like the whole world had dropped out from under him. Cas was… No, no he couldn’t be. Not like this. Even with the triangular wound that Dean knew went all the way through. Even with his eyes still smarting from the heavenly white light that had spilled from Cas’ eyes and mouth and chest.
“Got it. See?”
Leave it to Cas to understand. Without a word, he gracefully took a pause, let Dean think about that.
Jack turned again and grinned widely. “You are?”
[Dean wants to return the grace. He can feel the thrumming of it, how warm and comforting it is. He can feel the guilt hanging over him like a cloud: He made Castiel fall in every sense, and here he is keeping the grace as though that is something he is allowed to do. It's not right. He cannot keep this from Castiel, even though part of him fears that Castiel will take it back in both senses and become an angel again. He remembers last time Castiel was human, how hard it was for him, and he wouldn't blame Cas for taking his grace back, but what if he gets himself killed? What if he spreads his broken wings and leaves one last time?]
“The way I see it, Dean, you didn’t kill him. You saved him.”
Hell, maybe this was why Castiel watched him sleep and dream for all these years. In dreams, the good ones at least, that was what he did. He let himself simply
Miracle helped a little bit when she found her way in. She curled up at Dean’s feet and begged to have her belly scratched, which was a fairly good distraction. Still, she left when Jack called her for a walk, and Dean instead occupied his hands by holding Cas’. They were solid and Dean squeezed one.
Castiel smiled at that, barely visible in the flickering light of a torch. It was a touch sad to acknowledge aloud but there was a glimmer of hope in Cas’ expression as well. Maybe now he would finally find his place.
Castiel’s eyes were blank, tears streaming down his face. His breaths came in gasps: ragged, haggard gasps that shook his body violently.
(as a disclaimer, the second code was much
“We are, and it will take time,” Jack admitted. “But it’s important. It’s like what you and Sam and Cas taught me.”
“Is he okay now?” Eileen asked, her eyes betraying that she knew, deep down, where this was going.
Sam came out from the hallway looking ready to have a heart to heart and Dean couldn’t take it.
A slow smile slipped on his kid’s face, and Jack left the room speaking brightly to Miracle. Dean didn’t know who was more excited for their walk.
It was six at night and Dean had yet to see Castiel since bringing him back. Jack was still in with him, Sam was updating their friends and thanking Rowena again, and Dean was… Well, Dean didn’t know what to do.
and you’re

“I love you, too, Cas. You can have me. You always could have.” Dean paused to draw a breath. “Please come back. Stay with me.”
in-between after that.
A little too quiet. A little too dark. A little too all-enveloping. A little too much like it was swallowing every sound they could make. A little too much like...
“Would you like to help me?”
“They corrupt us,” the man continued, pointedly stopping and turning to face the woman in green. “Human emotions are a weakness. They were not meant for us to experience.”
“They’re… they’re jus'… gone,” he mumbled into Sam’s shoulder. “Jack… ‘nd C— Cas…”
“According to Jack, I slept for almost three days after I was brought back. I didn’t particularly feel the need to sleep more.” Jack turned at the mention of his name but Miracle vied for his attention as well, and ultimately she won out.
“I’ll do it,” Jack said, scooping Miracle up in his arms and darting down the steps. It was almost comedic, how she kept licking his face and how big she looked in Jack’s arms. Cas followed behind them, shivering lightly. All Dean could think of was Castiel alone and drenched in that alleyway.
There was a silence, so heavy that Dean almost didn’t break it. In a rough voice, he managed to say, “To everyone that we lost along the way.” He clinked his beer against Sam’s and took a swig, ending it abruptly. He needed something stronger. Vodka, maybe, or bourbon, though he wasn’t sure if they had either of those in the Bunker anymore. He had already gone through a fair amount after Cas was taken, and then even more when it was the whole world. Still, maybe he had missed a bottle somewhere. He was about to stand to search when Sam started to speak.
Castiel scoffed. “You’ve said that before. I’m not going to fall for it again.”
“It’s warm, familiar…. Safe…. I get why you’re here, man. It’s a whole lot nicer than anything the Empty. Hell, it’s better than the memories I’ve seen. But you’ve gotta know it’s not real.”
“I can’t perform this spell. Not yet at least.”
Dean left. He knew how this ended, and it ended with Cas dead, hands tied behind a chair. He didn’t need to see it happen again.
Dean nodded and said, “I guess,” before seeing Sam’s smile. “What?”
Jack looked away.
Castiel stared at him, head tilted in that familiar way, and Dean ran a hand across his own jawline.
“Better?” Dean asked as Castiel took a long sip.
“I like TV,” Castiel said quietly after a few minutes. Dean nodded and looked over to him, watching the bright colors reflect from his blank face.
“I’ll adjust. I’ve done it before.”
“What are you up to? Ya’know, upstairs.”
“Why does your friend owe you?”
“Cas?!”
“Wings,” he whispered, falling still as he realized Dean intended to stay. “Going t’ burn.”
In seconds, Dean had pulled him upright and slid behind him to get pressure on his wounds, especially the one on his back. Dammit, he had a chance, he had a fighting chance.
“Cas and Jack are gone.”
“She is.”
“I had a job. I experienced a multitude of new things. I learned more about humanity and emotion. And myself. What I wanted.” He nuzzled his face back against Dean’s shoulder. “All things considered, I don’t think it turned out too poorly. We’re here, together.”
“Like how the portal in purgatory was only good for me because I was human, not a monster?”
Edits on Dec 27-28
Castiel threw a look back over his shoulder and felt a pang. It was true. Jack was growing up, whether Cas wanted him to or not. There would come a day when he didn’t sleep with his bee, a day when he wouldn’t want to snuggle on the couch, a day he would have his heart broken, a day when he would decide he wanted to go his own way. Worse, there would be a day when Cas would have to let go. He wouldn’t always be there to comfort him, to protect him from the world as best as he could. Cas wouldn’t see him every day, would miss that sweet laugh, his crooked smile, the gentleness of his soul.
doesn’t get in the way of our working relationship.” Castiel turned to face him, obviously speaking carefully. “You’re… like family to me.”
“Cas?” Nothing. “No, no, no.”
To distract himself, Dean tore his eyes from the newly added names and caught himself thinking about adding more. Who else was family, who else had they neglected to include?
Dean could feel the warm thrum of happiness in his chest when he saw his brother with Eileen, Jack playing with Miracle, Castiel watching him with a soft smile. This was how it was meant to be. This was their happy ending.
“Dean...”
“There’s a burger in the kitchen for you. I’ll heat it up while you get changed.”
Dean pulled on his jacket as he made his way to the library, where Sam was working on creating a better cataloguing and tagging system. His burger was on the table by him.
He put chocolate chips in one pancake and a smiley face of whipped cream on the other before sliding the plate in front of Jack with a smile.
“You love me,” he said again. It was definite, factual, and proud. He had that spark in his eye, that bright excited expression Dean hadn’t seen in at least a year, not since Jack had come back to life.
“C’mere, kid.” Dean opened his arms and instantly Jack was in them, clinging to him. He had already lost one dad; Dean wasn’t going to let him lose another. “Don’t worry, I’ll bring him home.”
“We’re doing away with Purgatory as well.”
Dean glared at him, but Castiel just smiled.
“We will get him back. As soon as we can, we’ll save him,” Sam promised after a few minutes, when they had broken apart, but both leaned against the Impala, far too overwhelmed to start the drive home. Was it a home, without Castiel and Jack?
“I’ll stay with him.”
“Going out!” he shouted over his shoulder a few heartbeats later, running up the stairway and out the door before Sam could stop him.
Unlike the Empty, Cas’ mind felt somber. There had been something predatory about the former, but the latter was someplace Dean might have felt safe if not for the circumstances. He kept walking in the same direction, feeling something warm in his gut, a sensation he could trust.
would be like, and I thought maybe we could go back to how we had been before I said... but I know things have changed. Maybe it would be better if I moved on.”
Dean felt desperation and anger and sadness rise up in him. “So, we just pop his batteries out and he can never have them back? We force him to live as a human for the rest of his life?”
“Just wish you were here to see it.”
Dean’s breath stopped in his throat. His brain didn’t know how to process, let alone respond.
“Cas!”
It was only now, alone in the library, that Castiel sighed and closed his book, placing it on the table beside him before standing and starting to put away a short stack of pulled books on the table.
“Come on, I have an image to maintain.”
[Jack and Dean bonding because their relationship is a hot mess. Something having to do with Castiel]
Castiel was already in the room when Dean got there, wearing a pair of long plaid pajama pants that Dean knew with certainty were his. He was sitting in his chair by the wall reading one of the dusty tomes from the library, or at least that was what Dean thought at first.
This was Cas. This was the
and let him love you.
“Bacon?”
Dean wasn’t sure prayer worked in the Empty. He could feel its hunger. Just as purgatory had wanted to reveal your true self, just at hell wanted to break you, this place wanted nothing more than to gag and eat you. It swallowed everything else, it seemed. What would stop it from taking on prayer next?
Dean shifted himself a little more towards the center of the bed and felt as Cas’ arm drape across his body, hand landing on his shoulder where a scar used to be. Dean shivered at the spark of it but the weight grounded him. It was warm, and the softness of Cas’ hair was nice against his jaw. If he were so inclined, he could plant a kiss there, so he did.
“I got her killed,” Castiel said softly, speaking for the first time since Naomi. His gaze was caught on the body of his female vessel, bloodstained and abandoned in the grass. “My questions…my doubts…”
When Dean finally caught up, Castiel was asleep once more. He risked a quick glance at his watch—only a few hours left. If Castiel took off again or if anything happened, the spell would fall and they would never get out in time.
(See the end of the chapter for
“With the talking dog?”
she said. Dean opted to stay above ground with Jack and Miracle.
It was like a play, Dean realized. Everything was made up of scenes and everyone simply jumped to the next one. Everyone except Cas, watching it all with fondness. In this story, he had cast himself as the audience, content to watch forever.
Dean felt his stomach twist and said a gruff “Morning” as he entered the small room. Cas looked away guiltily and Jack frowned into the cereal box.
“You’ve done more than that, Dean,” the younger man replied, and Dean felt himself stiffen in preparation for a new wave of guilt.
“I know, kid, I know. He’s always leaving for somewhere new, getting caught up in things. But Cas always comes back. Every time, no matter what happens. He finds his way back.”
“Yeah?” Dean asked, feeling the familiar ache in his chest grow. “Nice messages?”
“Hey, I talked to Jody. She and the girls are okay, and she says Donna is, too.”
Dean pulled out his pocketknife, the same one Castiel had used, back in the dungeon. Slowly, carefully, he dug it into the wood and painstakingly added two names: Jack and Castiel. They always should have been there. They should have known that they belonged. It was Dean’s fault for not including them enough, not helping them to feel seen. Maybe if he had, they wouldn’t have left. With a heavy heart, Dean remembered standing in this same library, shouting that Jack wasn’t family. He remembered nearly killing him and blaming him for things beyond his control. Just as bad was the memory of Castiel at this same table, sitting and eating a burrito and being content, happy even, just before Dean had kicked him out. That wasn’t even the worst, was it? No, he had done so much worse to Castiel, even just in the library.
The warm lighting of the Bunker washed over Dean. He was…he was

Dean didn’t know what to say, but Cas shifted his position and continued.
“Yes. Because we don’t have another choice.”
Castiel turned on his heel before freezing and Dean breathed a sigh of relief. So, Cas
He felt his brother’s arms close tighter around him and somehow felt worse, like he didn’t deserve it.
As Castiel took the nougat, the other Dean came back, somehow now without the bags, and took a seat at the library table. Jack was quick to follow, and he slid into his seat just as the door opened to reveal Sam and Eileen, still bright and happy.
“I found a lead,” Jack offered, getting straight to business. “A way to bring Cas back.”
uncomfortable.”
“Then that’s good enough for me.” He offered Jack a sad smile. “I’ll see her in a few years anyway, right?”
“Maybe.”
for the first time in… ever. You helped him to get there.”
And then he’d gotten upset. He made a mistake. He killed someone he loved; someone they all loved.
Dean pulled the scrap paper over to him and made short work of the code.
“He gave it to me after I came back from the Empty. Just after Mrs. Butters.”
Had that…creature been Castiel too? Now that he thought about it, the sand, the blood, the screaming, and angels…that had been Egypt, hadn’t it? The plagues, death of the firstborn. Castiel had been there.
They shared a quick loving glance.
“I don’t know about
“I think I’m going to have to shave today,” Castiel said, mostly to his coffee. “It’s rather itchy.”
No longer hungry, Dean made his way to his room.
He thought it was a cruel trick at first when he saw that chest rise, only to see it fall and rise again. The buzzing in his ears turned into groans and he sprang up, grabbed the trenchcoat by the lapels and peered into his face, desperately looking for anything, a single sign that Castiel was alive.
Jack nodded carefully. Dean hadn’t missed how he had flinched at the mention of Mary, but now wasn’t the time to address that.
“Yeah, I guess I was more focused on other things.” Castiel nodded and stared into his mug for a few moments before Dean retorted, “Anyways, you’re one to talk.”
Castiel closed Dean’s fingers around the vial and smiled sadly.
Castiel breathlessly mouthed his name again, eyes wide with suddenly clarity but still deeply fearful.
Dean could understand his interest in watching. It was nice to not be involved in the messiness of life for a little while, and he himself enjoyed this…fantasy where things were, well, damn near perfect. Everyone was free to just be, with no conflict or worry.
“Now, now Mirabel,” the man offered. “Weakness is to blame as well. If one is not careful, they are as much a danger to us as we are to them.”
Dean circled Castiel and tried to catch his eyes, unsuccessfully. Dean hesitated for a moment. He had his difficulties coming to terms with Castiel’s confession, with the difference between a human and an angel, but the more he thought about it, the more he realized there was no difference. Castiel spoke from his heart, he always had. He was earnest and true and said what he felt with no qualms. And if he could speak his truth, so could Dean.
“No, I mean it, Sam. Cas is family, we’re not going to give up on him!”
“He made a choice,” Sam echoed.
was too much like a Hallmark movie.
Dean screamed, unsure if it was from the burning or the knowledge that Castiel was gone, but it didn’t much matter.
“I never get enough, no reason to start sleeping in now.”
How do you guys write? Do you have a writing schedule and plan it out or do you just sort of go for it like I do?
wasn’t quite what Dean had expected.
A few nights later, Dean found himself in the same situation as before: he couldn’t sleep, even with Miracle warm beside him. He left her in bed and roamed the halls instead.
“Well, yeah. He died saving me. And you said it yourself, he thought he would have longer. It was my idea to come back here. Billie came after me. And Cas… I couldn’t stop it, Jack. The Empty just came out of nowhere and…”
even in this land of no memory,
With that, Jack left to talk to Sam and Dean, after processing everything Jack had said, went to the kitchen to start dinner.
They ended up in the DeanCave on the couch Dean had just gotten a few weeks before Cas had been taken. Cas had put himself at a small distance: far enough that they didn’t touch but close enough that they could.
Note on Cas' pronouns for the female vessel: I rationalized it as 12x10 "Benjamin is an angel, his vessel is a woman" and kept male pronouns for Cas since he's been shown to use them. Sorry if they read as a little jarring :(
Feelings were different. They were part of that universal human experience Sam had talked about for some high school book report. They couldn’t be defined by words, only by living them.
Dean could feel the hair on the back of his neck prick up. Whatever it was, it was behind him.
“I know,” Jack replied with ease. “You don’t need to apologize.”
Come back come back come back. Come back because I need you so. And you do not need me and why should you come back... Only because I want you and need you…
Dean made a face. “How about I look up types of codes and ciphers and we look to see if any are food?”
“This is for your own good,” Ishim promised, cradling Cas’ terrified face with both hands. Benjamin and Mirabel held Cas in place as they chanted what Dean recognized as Enochian until light burst forth from the vessel. Dean watched as Castiel broke one arm free and drew an angel blade. He raised it against Ishim, but as it came down, the Enochian took effect, and he was removed from his vessel in a burst of white light. Ishim wrenched the blade down and into the woman’s torso. She screamed for a moment, no longer possessed as her blood stained the green dress.
“What, so I would go in and get him and not be able to take him with me?”
Sam’s face filled with understanding and his own grief. “I’ll tell her we can’t make it.”
(See the end of the chapter for
The “What the fuck was that/How could you do that to me” was the first thing written, probably on Jan 13
“Dean?”
“Everything is off by a few letters, so you spin the ring and try each combination until it decodes.” Jack looked back to the paper and grabbed a pencil so he could write it on a separate sheet. “Cas likes to shift everything by one letter because of my initials.”
“Okay!”
