Holmes pressed an urgent finger to his lips and the maid fell silent, her eyes huge and watery. “The good dying young from a simple lack of wealth is a crime, Mrs Andrews. Please take us to your husband.”
Sherlock straightens and looks at John, and something wonderful happens in his eyes, to his face, when he sees John’s expression, a sort of magic trick that is dependent on the light and makes John feel as though he is luminescent. Sherlock steps immediately closer, into John’s space, drawn forward.
Holmes leaned forward conspiratorially, left his arm in Watson’s grip. “I have already said, dear woman, that we are here to help you. My friend here is Doctor Watson.
Watson blinked blearily at the dark stretch of wall hiding Holmes and waited, familiar with this game of pause and play. He was aware even in his befuddled state that Holmes would somehow know the precise instant Watson opened his mouth to continue and would consequently begin playing again.
“Why has this so caught your interest?” Watson inquired, the carriage bumping along the dusty roads and knocking against cobblestone. The smog was ample outside, too thick to spy through and the sunlight too early to cut through it, and so Watson settled himself to watch his companion. Holmes was little more than a shadow on the seat, a vibrating bundle of coats and the sharp angle of ceaselessly shifting hands, and Watson’s gaze was arrested helplessly. “You generally fancy your endeavours to be a trifle more… perilous. The details you have described for me paint a picture of Scotland Yard saving the young one. Is this not merely-”
John had once again felt an almost physical pain when he didn’t allow himself to explain to Sherlock why he was still living with Mary. The pain had not exactly become any less when Sherlock had proceeded to give not the Baker Street address, but one near Hyde Park instead.
”Again, I’m so sorry for this, I don’t know where it came from, I, er. I think I’m just very stressed right now and a bit off balance with this whole moving thing and, yeah. So. I hope that I didn’t upset you too much, I didn’t mean to- Yeah. I’m sorry. For everything.”
”I’ll tell you,” Sherlock whispered, so very quietly, into his ear. “I would like to suck that big dick of yours, John. Suck it until you come.”
The emotions came slamming down like a full frontal collision with a double decker bus. To his utter horror, he started to sob.
But on all the other days, it’s not unusual for John to come home around seven o’clock in the morning after a night shift to find Sherlock still awake, busy with his microscope in the kitchen or in the midst of papers and documents scattered all over the floor.
John clears his throat, finishes his tea. Didn’t plan to say all that. Sherlock is sitting still and quiet, blinking a bit too fast. Was a bit much, maybe, and it’s late and Sherlock has certainly had his emotional quota filled a long time ago this evening. ”Sorry,” John says. ”Didn’t mean to lay all that upon you.” John stands, grabs his mug as well as Sherlock’s. ”I think we’d better get some sleep now.”
Maybe it was the champagne, maybe the release of laughter, but it felt like that barrier was gone, and John’s heart soared. Sherlock was holding John’s gaze, meeting him with warm, smiling, sparkling eyes, and it was just the way that it had used to be, before, the two of them laughing together.
”Sherlock, please. I’m sorry if I made you uncomfortable, I didn’t mean to put you in the spotlight like that. I just- I don’t want to lie, or hide. I feel I have no reason to.”
It had been a grey and chilly November weekend, and it was the second time that they'd gratefully accepted Janine's offer to borrow the cottage.
Returning from Afghanistan, lonely and broken, he hadn’t had a life. After losing Sherlock, he didn’t even want one. Sherlock’s return from the dead had also been John’s.
”Sherlock, please don’t do this. I’lI willingly admit, I’ve made so many mistakes I’ve lost count, but I don’t think it’s really fair to lay all of this on me. To be honest, I think I wanted you from the first day we met, but you know what Sherlock?”
They grind against each other, cocks sliding in the slippery wetness. Then John suddenly stops, sits up to take off the trousers and pants that’s been wrapped around his thighs. When he’s back, he takes them both in his hand, holds their cocks together as they keep moving.
Round tables were placed around a dance floor that occupied the middle of the outdoor space, a few people were dancing.
”Had any good cases lately?” John tried to get a conversation going, but it felt weird, having to ask about the things he used to be so tightly interwoven in, and Sherlock was politely answering his questions, but not providing anything more.
He wanted to tell Sherlock everything. That was his strongest impulse. Tell him that he’d followed through with the divorce, explain that he was going to move out. Tell him how intensely he still missed him, and how he’d do anything for a second chance to make it right again.
John was looking at him like - well, like he loved him. Which he said he did, said it every day, but it sure felt good, seeing it shine through John’s eyes like this.
Outside, a car came to a halt. He leaped to the window, looked out. It was a taxi but it wasn't John.
And even though Sherlock was in no way a stranger, it was, after all, their first interaction after the, eh, activities of last night. The moment where they had to look into each others' eyes and make normal conversation, unprotected by the softness of the night.
to happen, at this point. Even if he managed to get that bloke out of the picture (which he was fairly certain he would) - then what about Mary? And what about his daughter? Divorce? Part time Dad? Concepts too strange to take in right now.
«John I'm sorry I can't be quiet, I can't be quiet!» he's murmuring frantically, scared voice wet of tears. «They always hear me, they alway do.» he shakes his head and close his eyes again.
John's engine rumbling in his blond head, metal gears picking out the words he desperately wants to ask. This was going to happen. He tried hard to be invisible. Maybe he tried too hard. He didn't mean to drawn attention.
«Sarah? She's nice, I see why he would get a crush on her, I mean i have a crush on her too so it's not lik- »
But his thoughts get shaken out of his brain by the violent shaking of his head that keeps saying no to every single molecule of this place Right and left right and left no
He knows he's hurting his body, but he can't feel the pain. Is he in pain at all? When he was younger, Mycroft believed he didn't. Once he pulled his hair so much that when he fell asleep still crying and Mummy came to put him to bed, thin locks of hair were stuck in between his fingers.
Sherlock felt like he was going to go mad with desire. This was really happening. He heard himself make a desperate sound of some kind.
”No, I’m sorry Sherlock. I can’t. I realise that I’m popping up out from nowhere and all and I’m sorry, but I really, really don’t think you should be alone.” John realises he sounds worked up, tries to soften his voice. ”Please let me follow you home tonight.”
Side by side. Sherlock’s leg between John’s. John’s arm around him, squeezing him tight against him.
Sherlock was taken aback by the wording, as well as the blunt statement of the fact he knew to be true.
And he remembered that he had actually fallen off his chair a bit, and grabbed Sherlock’s knee, and even said something that.. well. No point in
He checks his respiration, then finds a stethoscope, holds Sherlock still with a hand on his arm as he leans forward, moves it around to listen to Sherlock’s heart. Strong, even beats - as John listens, he is flooded with sudden memories of the night Sherlock was shot.
”Yes.” For a moment, Sherlock just looks down. He desperately tries to think of something funny to say, in order to preempt the humiliation surely about to come. But John doesn’t laugh. Instead, he just keeps looking at Sherlock with those soft eyes.
Greg has immediately been whisked off to the ambulance for a checkup, John wonders if he should go over there to assist when Sherlock’s legs suddenly appear to give way, he sits down kneeling, supporting himself with his hands on the ground.
Sherlock waited, but John did not volunteer anything else. He had resumed stroking Sherlock across his shoulder and arm. Sherlock needed to know.
Sherlock just kept staring at him. John seemed to be picking up steam now, there was undisguised anger in his voice as he kept on.
Sherlock swallows. ”John, I’ve never talked to anyone about this. It concerns events that took place a long time ago. Ghosts of the past, that… set me on a certain course, in more ways than one.”
He sighs, rolls his eyes for dramatic effect. ”It’s impossible to answer that question because the measurement lacks defined reference points. Also, establishing reliability and validity in a scale usually requires a minimum of three items per factor. With a single-item scale like the one you’re proposing, there’s no way to compute, for example, internal consistency reliability. The question of validity is also problematic, and would need to be established through examination of convergent validity, preferably with a physiological measure such as-”
It was not what he had expected from this elegant, fragile-looking woman, and John thought it was nice to be surprised in a positive direction for once.
John had tried, albeit half-heartedly, to be honest with himself about these realities, but it was as if his brain couldn’t sustain the difficult thoughts for long enough to reach some kind of conclusion.
Always when this would come up, Sherlock would feel like he was waiting for a disaster to happen, like standing at the beach and seeing a tsunami approaching, knowing that you couldn’t outrun the wave.
“Oh, Sherlock, god, I'm going to come,” he managed to get out, and then, his body tensed up as he felt it happening. He felt the blissful nothingness of release take over him as he came so hard, came inside of Sherlock. From a distant place, he heard Sherlock say something.
”I bet you’ve seen it too, mate! This one is bad with the ladies, always was. We used to call him Three Continents Watson, for all his conquests around the globe!”
”Saved a great many soldiers from bleeding out in Vietnam, you know. Press here.” John guides Sherlock’s hand to press on the flanell.
John smiles. ”Never been more sure in my life.” He's finally pulling Sherlock close to his body again. Hands skimming over Sherlock’s back, finding their way to his buttocks, and that is enough to make Sherlock’s cock begin to fill again.
”I just never imagined that I would be having a dick up my arse on my wedding night, that’s all,” he managed to say, before again breaking out in uncontrollable laughter.
Sherlock rolls over to his side, begins to place small kisses on John’s neck, just below his left ear.
“I'd say yes,” John kept speaking with that soft, low voice. “As a doctor, no, hell, as a man – no. As a living, breathing person to another, I'd say of course you do. But then...” his voice trailed off, he kept looking at Sherlock, considering.
Whenever he was away from home or work, he would constantly keep an eye out for dark curls or a swirling coat. Many times, he had thought it had been him. Every time, his heart had jumped, his breathing had stopped. But it was never Sherlock, no, why would it be. What were the odds.
Life was indeed a complex matter and never like in the fairy tales. But here he was, standing in the kitchen of 221B Baker Street, with his arms around the man that he was so fully devoted to; loved without reservation.
”He terrifies me, always has. Sherlock had the scariest big brother of everyone, even back then. He used to joke about it, call him his archenemy. I don't think Mycroft was too happy about that.”
John frantically dialed the familiar number. It went straight to voice mail. He hung up, dialed again, then remembered Sherlock would think it was Mary calling him.
Now Sherlock jolted alive. ”We can’t, we absolutely can’t. I’m terribly sorry, most unfortunate timing, would have been lovely, but as a matter of fact, we were
”Yes… just like that, perfect… God you’re good with your-” John stops talking, and instead, lets out a throaty moan as Sherlock quickly slides down to take him into his mouth.
”I know you’re not,” Sherlock says. ”Far too disorganised, just look at the wrinkles on your uniform, not ironed properly - you wouldn’t last a day in that profession. Hurry up now, make it quick, we don’t have all night.”
Oh how that thought hurt. Ripped right through him, like that bullet had. Just in a different kind of way.
For a brief moment, the music is drowned by the scraping sounds of people rising in the benches around him. He stands, shuts his eyes and lets the music carry him far back in time and place.
This guy didn't actually seem to mind. On the contrary, he looked like he quite liked it. He was starting to make small sounds now to as well, a sort of humming, while not losing focus from his task at hand.
She watched him, guardedly, then moved a bit closer. John tried to stifle a big sigh of relief when she finally slumped down next to him.
John lowers his head to let his tongue taste the salty skin of Sherlock’s left supraclavicular fossa; inhales the rich scent of him.
Beeping from a monitor. He forced his eyes open just enough to made out the numbers on the screen. Blood pressure acceptable. Normal sinus rhythm. Oxygen saturation excellent at 99%.
John was still holding Sherlock’s face with one hand, and he had moved the other around Sherlock’s back, he was using it to press Sherlock’s body tighter against him.
John was still standing by the bar, astonished, when Mary found him there and said it was time to go home.
Always one to want to please his lovers, John smiled. He’d seen the response his words had triggered in Sherlock. He understood what he was after, and he wasn’t really surprised by it either, no, he had already sort of figured out that that kind of stuff would probably be a turn on for Sherlock. John did not plan to disappoint.
At this, John broke out in a loud laugh, and Sherlock shortly followed, his eyes lighting up with sparkles.
The unrest in Sherlock’s stomach is getting worse; is beginning to spread to his chest and to his throat, restricting his airways just a little bit. This is not at all going the way he was intending, and he has to do something to turn it around.
“Just because I don't care for the effects that love and sexual relations have on most people, and rarely find anyone attractive - it doesn't mean that I don't suffer under the same basic hormonal influences as everyone else.”
And when John had fallen asleep, Sherlock lay still for a long time, listening to John’s heartbeats reverberating through the mattress.
”Mike, I need to ask you something. You know, I sort of get the feeling that Sherlock is avoiding me. It’s like I’ve done something that pissed him off, but I just can’t figure out what. You see him now and then at Bart’s, don’t you?”
”I love you,” John said. His eyes were sparkling. ”You are everything to me. I love you to the moon and back, Sherlock.”
What could possibly have changed? He did a rapid scan of every interaction he’d had with John since their last meeting, but came up short. This was beginning to feel a bit like a case, he thought, frustrated to not understand. Maybe he should accept John’s next request to meet up, gather some more information.
”Oh just stop it. Act like a goddamn adult, for once. Let me ask you this. What the hell do you intend to do when you’re, say, sixty-five? Because I guarantee you, by then, even you will be too old to keep this up! What are your plans for when that time comes?”
Sherlock’s clenching his fists together so hard the knuckles are getting white. John can’t be fucking serious. From what Sherlock could gather from the texts, they haven’t known each other for more than a couple of months, at most.
John walked up next to Sherlock, and used his body weight and left shoulder to carve out a space for himself at the jammed bar.
”Lazy git,” John replied. ”Maybe I’ll ask your father for help. He could do well with some time away from home, I think.”
For every second now, Sherlock felt more and more certain that this, what they had right now, might never return.
John smiles, wipes a pearl of sweat away from Sherlock’s temple. Cups his stubbly cheek in his hand. Leans forward to kiss him, softly, on the lips. ”Just so you know,” he says, quietly. ”I’ve always been.”
John’s heart had gone into overdrive, although he tried to tell himself there was no reason for that, no reason at all.
”But then I got a case outside of London, and I had to leave in a rush. And I happened to forget I had left it there-”
”I want to be with you,” John said softly. ”I want to be with you every single second that I can. I think about you constantly when we’re apart, you know. I love you, Sherlock, you know I do.” John was stroking his back.
Mary saved him from himself, back when they met. He’s not sure if he’d still been alive if he hadn’t met her. At the same time, he can’t help but wonder how things had turned out, otherwise, had he still been there when Sherlock came back.
John had experienced panic attacks before, but only ever related to his post traumatic nightmares. Now, however, he was praying that his body wouldn’t launch him into one right there at the table. He felt the all too familiar symptoms coming on: racing heart, tunnel vision, a feeling of constriction in his chest. He reminded himself that these were normal and completely harmless sensations, tried to not let anxiety spiral into full blown panic.
John smiled. It very much appeared like he was going to reach out, touch him. A memory flashed by, of John, putting his arms around him in by the kitchen counter at Baker Street.
Sherlock was jolted out of his thoughts when Gabriel stirred, turned around, then opened his eyes, squinting to the light.
Sherlock suddenly got very worried to do something that would put John off. He tried to be as still as he could, even though his entire body was desperate to move.
Sherlock could see the way John was looking at him. Not much to doubt, there, really. Sherlock could see it, he could feel it. He could even feel it deep within himself, in that intuitive way that he was just beginning to discover.
”Of course I forgive you, John,” he said in a small voice, only meeting John’s eyes for brief, scattered moments. ”Did that a long time ago. And I hope that if it’s not too much to ask, you can find it in you to forgive me. I’m so sorry I couldn’t… The timing, er-
”Up,” he says, breathless, and Sherlock obliges, raises his upper body so that John can free his arms from the shirt. Lies down side by side again, kisses along Sherlock’s throat. Licks his earlobe, then sucks it into his mouth, hears Sherlock breathe heavily.
He comes in long hard pulses, deep inside of him, and then watches transfixed as Sherlock throws his head back, eyes squeezed shut as he comes, white ejaculate painting stripes across his chest and stomach.
“What about it? As I said, it was a big mistake, but I didn't realize it at that time. Perhaps you are immune to making mistakes, Mycroft, but most of us ordinary humans aren't, you know. That doesn't make someone a horrible person, or mean that one can't try to repair it.”
“Yes..?” John felt confused now, and he hoped Sherlock would be able to clear it up. After a silence that felt like it'd stretched out for far too long, Sherlock replied in a near whisper.
As he lay dozing off, stretched out on the sofa, he kept seeing that little girl’s face before him. It had been a strange experience, the entire day, even though it had been so much better than expected. Come to think of it, maybe that was the strangest part of it all? The fact that he hadn’t minded more.
It’s like they’ve done this, together, a thousand times before. Effortless, the way their bodies fit together. John is burning.
Squatting down next to the girl, he pointed, making sure to keep his gestures slow and his voice hushed, to not disturb the enormous insect sitting on a branch not far away. He estimated it’s wingspan to be close to nine inches.
“Sherlock, I don't think that's a good idea. We've both had far too much to drink tonight, and since you've, er – you've never-”
Before he could change his mind, he dialed the familiar number, finding a small pleasure in typing in the numbers rather than using the speed dial.
At the reception desk, he was greeted, if one could call it that, by a very beautiful and very snarky young woman. She looked him up and down, clearly judging his casual state of dress, and raised her eyebrows slightly.
It was all so very, very complicated. All he knew for certain was the mad desire, the overwhelming need to be with Sherlock. He could not stop thinking about him, it had taken priority over all other thoughts and emotions. Perhaps if he could only see him, everything else would just naturally fall into place?
”Victor was the only one I got to know there, and that was only because of an accident - his bull terrier freezed on my ankle one morning as I was on my way to something.”
”I’m the lucky one here,” said Sherlock, and John had to pull him in for a hug. He buried his nose in his neck and inhaled the familiar scent, felt the soft curls tickle his face.
No obsessive thoughts about Sherlock, nor about his own sexual identity. No fantasies about being out solving crimes with a consulting detective in a long coat. In fact, Sherlock hadn’t even entered his mind, up until now. It was just nice, being out, making new friends, having a good time. Maybe this whole thing was temporary, some sort of mid-life crisis?
Red and blue lights bathed the area, it was stylishly decorated with large exotic trees in containers, plush black pillows were scattered out on the chairs and benches.
”Alright,” John said, still just standing there. Sherlock swept his hand in the direction of John’s bedroom which got him moving. John took a few quick steps past Sherlock, but then suddenly turned around, came back.
”You’re a horrible person,” Sherlock said, but he was fighting the laughter, too. ”I got a big bruise actually,” and he pulled down his robe to reveal a bluish mark on his shoulder. ”Must have hit the nightstand.”
”Oh, gosh, I’m sorry to hear that.” Chris looked uncomfortable, having been forced into serious conversation all of a sudden. ”But knowing you, I’m sure you already have a long queue of pretty ladies lined up!” He laughed and before John could say something, the man turned to Sherlock.
“Come here.” He stretched out his arms for John, made him stop, pulled him down to lie next to him on the bed.
Sherlock raises the megaphone again. ”It’s from McDonald’s, ’urry up la, the burgers are gettin’ cold. Is proper baltic out ’ere.”
”Yes, I know, I know, I’m an idiot, what can I say.” He forced a short laugh. ”Really bloody embarrassing, my age, to get hammered like a teenager. It was Nigel’s shots that did me in. And then I just walked around to sober up before I went home. Didn’t want you to have two babies to look after.”
”You know Sherls, it feels like I’ve known you forever, but sometimes I remember that there were twelve long years when we didn’t keep in touch. Don’t get me wrong here, but I can’t help to wonder-”
”Forgive me Sherlock, I’m just stunned, that’s all. This is- I’m- this is amazing. Absolutely amazing. She’ll love it. Love it! I love it. It’s-”
”What the hell is this, Sherlock, hm. You bring me back here, after a year and a half of silence, and you strip naked and we have sex and now you’re just going to throw me out! Well that’s-” John’s voice cracked, he inhaled sharply through his nostrils, ”That’s really so fucked up I can’t even-”
But he did care, a great deal, of course he did. It was impossible to stop thinking about this. John, jealous? Maybe not actually being mad about the secretly-gay-thing, but instead - jealous? But jealous as a friend - or as a lover? Gabe had certainly seen it the latter way. Sherlock added this potential piece of the puzzle to the rest.
For the first time ever, Sherlock found himself wondering what his child - the one he planned to never have, but still - what would his child look like? Be like?
Sherlock now had both his hands on John's arse, as John was leaning over him in the chair. It turned the kisses more frantic. Still kissing, John got up on his feet and struggled to free himself from his jeans. He decided to leave the pants on for now, not wanting to overwhelm Sherlock in any way.
They'd been drinking for a substantial amount of time now. Far too long. Far too much. John's head was spinning. He hazily wondered how Sherlock was faring. He had proven before to have a much lower tolerance to alcohol than John, and as far as he knew, they'd been holding a fairly even pace throughout the evening.
Sherlock was still speaking in that strangely articular, upbeat voice, it reminded John of they way people spoke in movies from the fifties.
Sherlock slowly raises his head until they are face to face. Impossibly close, breath intermingling.
Flicks open the lid and then returns. This time, he pushes his thumb just inside, proceeds to press it down against the ring of muscles. Sherlock moans, loudly, the sound traveling straight to John’s cock, making it twitch.
That evening, in his quiet flat, John had really thought about it, long and hard. Eventually, he’d made up his mind. Mike was right. It was time to start getting back on track.
”Just tell me Sherlock, no lying, no fibbing. I’m a big boy, I promise I can take it, but I need to know. Did you use to fuck? Yes or no, please.”
He drags Sherlock the short distance to the second ambulance, sits him down inside. John looks around but doesn’t see any of the staff, so he grabs one of the orange foil blankets and wraps it tightly around Sherlock.
Sherlock grabs a police blanket from the nearest car, spreads it out on the ground just in front the entrance and sits down on it, crossed-legged. John thinks that his legs would break if he tried that now. Sherlock has kept a burger for himself - the one without onions, John smiles when he notices. Trust Sherlock to be picky with his food even in situations like this.
John tries to replace the image with something else but instead, the emerging panic just grows stronger in his chest.
This whole day, nothing but waiting. He had dragged himself out of bed at noon, after many sleepless hours spent underneath the covers.
For a moment, he could see a bit of hesitation flicker in her otherwise steely cold eyes. Good, he was on the right track then.
”No, I mean,” Sherlock’s stumbling over his words. ”I mean, yes. Yes. It’s just-” His voice is thick. ”It’s just that I’ve waited a fucking decade to hear you say that.”
Eventually, they manage to make their way from the hard tiles of the bathroom floor to Sherlock’s bed.
”Do you want me to finish you off right now? With my mouth?” John murmurs, and there’s that tongue again, darting out to wet his lips.
Gabriel was standing behind them, looking quite drunk. He was swaying, and proceeded to stabilize himself with a heavy hand on each of John’s and Sherlock’s shoulder.
“She has actually told me a lot about her past now, so I'd say I know her fairly well. Look Mycroft, the only thing that matters-”
At this point, John had almost entirely quit thinking about the gay or straight thing. He wasn’t getting anywhere with those thoughts, really, and all he knew was that he wanted to be with Sherlock. Be with him in every sense of those words. And whatever that made him, he had decided to not waste more effort worrying about.
It was an odd experience, to go from casually interacting with your best friend, to suddenly not being able to look at him without imagining some sexually tinged scenario.
”Danny, hi, ta for pick’n up,” Sherlock says into the headset. John notices that the conversation is transmitted to a computer inside one of the cars, he steps a bit closer to be able to hear it.
There had been some new detective series that Mary had wanted them to watch, but thankfully she had fallen asleep on the sofa just fifteen minutes in. John spread a blanket over her, turned the telly off, and made his way upstairs. He took a quick look to see that Anna was doing alright in her crib, and then went into the upstairs bathroom, locking the door behind him.
Sherlock was awakened by his phone chiming. He squinted his eyes to the bright morning light, fumbled to get the phone from his bedside table. John?
”…we can do that too, but not tonight.” He let out a short, breathy laugh and John felt the furious arousal building up even stronger within him.
She kept talking about treatments and statistics and what the latest research suggested, but John found himself unable to pay attention, his mind constantly drifting off to the last couple of months and the very uncomfortable feeling in his stomach.
He followed Sherlock with his gaze as he made his way towards the door to the flat. Sherlock opened it but didn't close it behind him. It occurred to John that this was a really thoughtful gesture on Sherlock's part, allowing John to hear the interaction.
Flickers through images in his mind - the way their bodies had moved together- the taste of John’s skin - the overload of all his senses when John had taken him into his mouth- John’s come on his hand, his chest-
He was pushing down his hand, and suddenly, John found himself holding it flat over Sherlock’s cock. Over his decidedly hard cock, and John couldn’t stop himself from gasping at the sensation.
Did he overwhelm Sherlock? Or did Sherlock, in fact, feel that John had taken advantage of his drunken state - maybe he’d been much worse off than it had seemed?
”The police will want to take your statements, but it will probably take them a while to get here on a night like this. I’m afraid you’re not allowed to leave the scene before then.” She made an apologetic gesture.
But then he had met Mary, and she had smiled at him with intelligent, sparkling eyes, and for the first time in a year and a half, John had felt a small glimpse of hope. She’d been his salvation.
He felt like crying but was too tired to actually do so. The second he closed his eyes, he was falling backwards, tumbling into a dreamless state of unconsciousness.
However, Sherlock noticed how they were both meticulously avoiding to touch on anything sensitive. Mary, Gabe, last night, or the questions about the drugs that he knew John was itching to pose. Even the baby was off limits, apparently, confirming Sherlock’s suspicion that he was not the only one indulging in pretense play this evening.
The days and nights had clearer borders now, were more defined, instead of seamlessly slipping into and out of each other like they had used to, before.
”Yeah?” he mumbles into Sherlock’s mouth. John is supporting his weight on his right arm, while holding himself in his left hand. He's slick with lube and precome, and already brushing against Sherlock’s carefully prepared ring of muscles.
Sherlock had not once looked at him, he kept his eyes either down to the phone or on Gabriel. John broke out in a big grin, and started to type.
John sighed, and reluctantly accepted he would have to wait until later. At least now he knew Sherlock was going to be okay, and that was all that really mattered at this point.
,” he whispers, the words stuttered, as Sherlock’s warm, wet mouth slides down the length of his cock. Sherlock pushes John’s thighs apart, then gets down on his stomach in between them, bracing on his elbows.
”I want to, more than anything. But you know I can’t. I will deal with this Sherlock, I promise you. I’ll fix this.”
Sherlock must think he had just ditched him. What if he had tried to get in touch, called or texted John and gotten no reply.
John’s entire upper body was heaving, he was still sort of sitting in between Sherlock’s legs, his dick still inside him.
“So... what about you then, Mister Sherlock Holmes...” He stared into Sherlock's eyes, putting all his effort into not smiling. Sherlock blinked a few times, a surefire sign he was feeling insecure. It made John very pleased with himself.
Sherlock moaned at John's touch, his grip around John faltering. Although John was absolutely aching to come by now, it still felt worth it. Worth seeing Sherlock in this state, completely undone, sweaty and tousled and panting.
”Sherlock, can you come with me? Come with me-” and then John lifted his hips up a bit, shifted his weight to one arm, and reached down in between them, put his hand around Sherlock’s. Sherlock could feel John’s fingers, occasionally brushing against his bare skin when their hands moved.
As the thought came to mind, Sherlock went from happily relaxed to sharply apprehensive in no time at all.
John thinks that he will probably not be able to see Mycroft as quite so intimidating again, not after these pictures. Because whatever will come, John will always remember the young Mycroft: a bit on the heavy side, looking miserable and out of place somehow compared to his cute little brother in the pirate hat.
”A mistake?!” John had gotten out of the bed, was standing behind him, now he grabbed his arm, forced him to turn around.
Sherlock pushes John backwards until the back of his knees hit the bed and he sits down. Stands between his spread legs, hands on his shoulders. Bends down to kiss him. There is nothing soft about the kisses now; Sherlock has waited long enough and the floodgates are wide open. He pushes his tongue deep inside John’s mouth, bites his lips, grasps at his hair.
. And then John got angry and they fought about it, and John rambled on about how the money was good (which was true, incidentally. They swam in money now, in a way that they had never, before) and how he needed to have a meaningful occupation, and blah blah blah.
As he moved his hips, he came in contact with Sherlock's groin and was pleasantly surprised to notice he was already hard again. John reached down a hand and put it on top of him. As he touched him, Sherlock's cock immediately grew harder in his hand, making them both groan. It was amazing, being so intimately close to Sherlock.
Sherlock’s face goes burning hot, he’s glad John can’t see it. His very first thought is that John’s mocking him, but as usual, he tries to remind himself that John’s not.. like that. So why, then, why bring it up when-
”You’re insane, Mary. If you think you can stop me from seeing Sherlock, you’re badly mistaken.” He was shaking now, controlled rage bubbling up to the surface.
”Ouch, my head,” he complained, putting his hands to his temples. ”Those waiters just kept refilling my glass. How’s anyone supposed to be able to track their alcohol consumption when they do that?"
”No, no you don’t understand. I don’t want to hear it for the sake of it, I just wish you would WANT to say it to me.”
Feeling love and feeling loved; it had transformed him. He’d never known the power of it, if it hadn’t been for John. And wasn’t that the ultimate irony? The thing that had led up to this situation, was also what made it unbearable now.
”Er, what is it that you want, then?” he asked. ”What do you want in your life that is currently missing?” Yes. That seemed like the appropriate thing to ask. Sherlock felt secretly pleased with himself. Great question. Caring, open ended.
John had made his way down to Sherlock's belly now, and he was nipping at the skin with his lips. It actually tickled quite a bit, causing Sherlock to giggle. John looked up and chuckled.
When doing his internship at an ER, John had gotten to witness his share of teared sphincters, often accompanied by condescending sniggers and jokes from the staff behind the poor patient's back. It had left a deeply planted fear in John, both for anal sex in general and also – unfortunately - for gay sex in particular. Several years later, a night out with an open bar and a new found, free spirited girlfriend had been what had helped him get over it enough to start experimenting with that particular region. But now, he got worried. He stilled.
. That fact makes Sherlock stand up taller. John, who is a genius with people and who knows how to do these things, the small talk and mingling things. Is there because of Sherlock.
Sherlock grew quiet for a few seconds, it felt like five minutes to John but he decided to wait him out. When he spoke, it was in his normal voice, and for that, John was grateful.
John got a mental image of what it would be like if he, some day, didn’t wear a condom and got to come in this position. How his cum would shoot right down Sherlock’s throat.
He found himself strongly hoping so. He leaned forward to kiss him, they both shivered when their tongues met again. John pulled away.
The Commander is silent for a long moment, they all stand still just watching him. Then he sighs, heavily. ”God help me. Alright.”
Once again, Sherlock acted without thinking. He reached down and placed his palm over John’s cock, felt it hard and hot under his jeans.
But John didn’t seem to be anywhere close to being put off. On the contrary, he was still smiling, and now he was beginning to move his hand over the fabric, tracing the contours underneath.
John sighed again, then buried his face in Sherlock’s hair. He felt John’s hot breath hit his scalp. John mumbled to his hair.
“Oh, where he always ends up after disasters like this – back home with Mummy. Probably already wrapped in blankets in front of the fire place and being force fed pudding. And tomorrow I'm sure Daddy will make him listen for hours on end to his latest plans for the kitchen garden. A fair punishment, I must say. An eye for an eye, and all that.”
Sherlock keeps looking at John’s hand. Smaller than his own. But stronger. Not a tremble. Because John thrives on danger, just like he does.
John can’t help but smile, feeling worry turn into a warm sense of - well, pride, actually. Pride over this brilliant man in front of him, now the sole center of everybody’s attention.
John cups his hands over his hipbones, and then greatly surprises Sherlock again by leaning forward to drag his lips over his cock, breathes hot air through the white cotton of his boxer briefs.
John feels dizzy, he notices that he’s so tense he’s trembling, his hands have gone icy cold. In the pit of his stomach, a very strange sensation, a jumble of panic and hope and confusion and anger and-
He closes his fist around Sherlock’s cock, works him until he’s fully hard again, then quickly presses a flat thumb against his hole. Sherlock’s breathy moan goes straight to John’s neglected cock.
A client, from years ago. Her brother in law had turned out to have been scheming to lay his hands on the family fortune, and it had been a very close call that he'd managed to finish off his entire extended family when this woman had stumbled upon his plans. He’d solved it in less than twenty-four hours.
Sherlock has gone outside again to smoke, and perhaps John should be concerned but in the light of Sherlock’s previous vices, this one doesn’t seem worth the fight.
John wondered while making his way around the area. He had no idea how Sherlock would even be reacting by now. John knew the odds were strongly leaning to Sherlock avoiding him again, but it felt impossible to leave without seeing him one final time tonight.
He never imagined Mycroft could cry. Hadn’t ever considered the possibility. Ridiculous! His brother was made of steel, was far above mushy sentiment. Which just made this so much more horrible.
He decided to give in to the impulse, and for the first time, allowed his hands to travel further down along Sherlock’s long, pale torso. He made a little pause at his navel, got a flashback from when he had been kissing him there, on that night a long time ago. It was unbelievable that he now got the chance to do it again.
Sherlock’s face was hovering just over John’s erection, sending shivers through his body as Sherlock breathed hot air over him. His hands were back on the inside of John’s thighs, squeezing and caressing, and John tried hard to not start to move his hips in anticipation.
John was taking off his clothes as well, and he, too, seemed to be somewhat more affected this time. Then John came closer, put his hands on his hips.
“Oh, God. Sherlock, if this is one of your games, so help me,” John sighed. Sherlock backtracks rapidly,
“We’re not actually going to discuss this, are we?” Mycroft sniggered before turning to a shell-shocked Lestrade. “I’m sorry, Detective inspector, you’re a fine man in many respects.” Lestrade looks up anger flashing in his eyes. Mycroft turns back to Sherlock, “Make your goodbyes and shoot him.” Sherlock just stared at Mycroft, the same slightly puzzled expression on his face. Mycroft sighed impatiently and points at Lestrade. “Shoot him!” Lestrade stared incredulously at the man calling for his death.
“Ignore everything he just said. He’s being kind. He’s trying to make it easy for me to kill him.” Lestrade stared at the floor, unable to meet his eyes.
“P.S,” Mary said, shifting slightly in her seat.  “I know you two; and if I’m gone, I know what you could become.” Sherlock turned to John, who was smiling at the screen, tears in his eyes.
“I’ll go speak with him,” Lestrade suddenly got up and started to walk away when Sherlock grabbed his arm and whispers,
inside me.” He looked down and straightened his tie. “I don’t imagine it’s much of a target but…” Sherlock’s face, still stained with tears, twists in anguish for a moment. “Why don’t we try for that?”
“I am not an experiment, Sherlock!” John yelled, a bit too loudly, his voice cracking. Sherlock’s eyes widen, panic evident.
“Five minutes. It took her just five minutes to do all of this to us.” Sherlock said through clenched teeth. He turned to Lestrade, who was staring at Mycroft, with a mix of emotions. Sherlock turned to his brother as well, who stared unblinkingly back at him. Sherlock presses his lips together for a moment before lowering the gun and turned away.
“Look at him. What is he?” Mycroft kept his eyes fixed on Sherlock, seemingly unable to look at the detective. “Nothing more than a distraction; a little scrap of ordinariness for us to impress, to dazzle with our cleverness. We’ll find another.”
Lestrade picked his way across the minefield of wood, moving to the shaking, huddled form of the youngest Holmes. Sherlock hadn’t stopped shaking, staring at the floor in the fetal position, breath still shaky, occasionally choking out a sob. Mycroft watched Sherlock, unsure of how to help his brother. Lestrade stopped a few paces from the shaking form.
“Final thirty seconds.” The timer onscreen read 00:31. Mycroft lifted his head, intending to help, but no words find him. Shaking his head, he stepped toward his brother letting out a puff of air, and just move back to Lestrade. Sherlock still faced the screen, his eyes closed. Taking a breath, he found the courage to say those words he hadn’t allowed himself to even think about John.  John closes his eyes, fighting tears threatening to spill over. He steadies himself, before waiting for Sherlock to say the words he had wanted to hear four years ago at the pool.
“Yes,” Sherlock’s voice cuts off Lestrade. Lestrade slowly turns to the lid leaning against the wall.
“How-” his voice breaks. He took a deep breath and tried again. “How am I supposed to respond to that, Sherlock?” Sherlock looked away, suddenly unable to meet John’s eyes.
John was obviously not willing to play along with whatever game he thinks Sherlock has created. The timer was at 01:08.
Mycroft frowned at Lestrade, who sighed and rubbed the bridge of his nose. Eurus’ glee was evident in her voice. “It’s an elimination round. You choose one and kill the other. You have to choose family or friend. Mycroft or Lestrade?” Sherlock closed his eyes and slowly turned to Mycroft and Lestrade. Lestrade ran his hand over his mouth, realizing what Eurus implied. Moriarty flashed behind Sherlock, ticking with a crazed smile as if he could see them.
Sherlock finds some of his cigarettes, somehow survived the explosion. He takes one out of the packaging.
Mycroft glanced at his brother, “This is all about you. Everything here.” Sherlock slowly puts his hands where the heart would be if there were a body in the coffin. “So, brother dear, who loves you? I’m assuming it’s not a long list.” Sherlock’s face paled as does Mycroft's. Lestrade walked to his side while Mycroft leaned the lid against the wall.
“John,”  Sherlock said, monotone. Lestrade’s face goes white as if he’s seen a ghost. They all know he’s right. Eurus, seemingly pleased, leans toward the camera.
“You don’t know about Redbeard yet!” Eurus exclaimed. Sherlock lowered one hand and continued to hold the gun to his chin.
“Hey, hold on now!” Lestrade interjected, “Do I get a say in this?” Mycroft turned to the detective.
“Tick-tock, tick-tock, tick-tock, tick-tock, tick-tock, tick-tock.” The flat reappears, John looks annoyed.
“John?” The countdown read 00:13. John brought the phone back to his ear, eyes screwing shut, fighting the tears spilling down his face. Sherlock stepped closer to the screen, eyes wide.
Sherlock throws the whole carton away and turned to John, who was asleep in his chair, Rosie in his arms.
Lestrade stood up straight, took a deep breath, and faced Sherlock. Sherlock closed his eyes and looked away. Mycroft chuckled,
“Not in the face, though, please. I’ve promised my brain to the Royal Society.”  Sherlock closed his eyes, his hand shaking.
Sherlock looked up at him, before nodding. Lestrade reached his hand out, offering it to the broken man who had once was accused of having no heart. Sherlock took Lestrade’s hand, standing up. Sherlock sniffed and picked the pistol out of the splinters. Straightening, the three men walked through the door. The light flashes blood-red,
“A child’s coffin would be more expensive. This is a lower price range, although still seems as though there is care put into choosing it.” Sherlock’s brows knitted together, “Almost a military style.”
“I don’t know,” he said again. “I thought she would have killed you. Please, all I’m asking is for you to understand I thought I had no choice.”
“I’m remembering the governor.” Grasping the pistol in both hands, and as calm as if he were taking a stroll in the park, lifted the muzzle and pressed it under his chin..
Sherlock returned to huddling in his blanket but looked at John. John was watching Eurus being loaded inside a reinforced cell inside one of the police vans. Sherlock’s eyes try to catch John's before quietly saying,
my Lady Bracknell,” He chuckled. Lestrade seemed to break out of his reverie and stared up at Sherlock.
I'm going back through and fixing errors and holy cow are there a lot. I'm so sorry, why did you put up with this?
Sherlock sighed, giving the coffin a once over. “Well, allowing for the entirely pointless courtesy of headroom, I’d say this coffin is intended for someone of about five foot six. Makes it more likely to be a man. Fit, regular exercise.”
“Eurus, I won. I won.” Sherlock said, attempting to hide the emotion in his face. Eurus remained silent. “Come on, play fair!” His voice breaks, “the girl on the plane: I need to talk to her.” Eurus still makes no sound.
“No, I know you’re not an experiment. You’re my,” he scrambled for the right word, “…. Friend,” He winced. “We’re friends. But…. Please. Just... Say those words for me.”
“Sherlock, don’t do this. Not right now, Sherlock.” John’s voice cracked again on the last word. A tear falls from his eye.
“You’re a good man, Sherlock,” Lestrade ran his hand over his mouth before continuing. “But, today, you’ve got to be heartless. Don’t let her use this against you.”
When Sherlock comes in the room, John was holding a DVD with the words “MISS YOU” written on it. Sherlock sat on the nearest sofa while John set up the DVD. Starting the disk, John sat next to Sherlock, tension thick enough to cut with the harpoon on the wall. Mary was smiling on the television. Both John and Sherlock were in a state of shock.
“Well, not on my watch,” Sherlock said. Mycroft’s face twisted in confusion. Lestrade looked to Sherlock.
“Five minutes’ conversation,” Mycroft started before Sherlock chuckles without humor. “Unsupervised.” Lestrade stared at Mycroft in shock before looking back and forth between the two brothers. He steps away, still looking at them. Sherlock sighed and gripped the pistol with both hands before aiming the gun at his brother. Mycroft straightened up and looked at Sherlock. “Goodbye, brother mine. No flowers,” He rested his hands behind his back, “by request.” Sherlock shifted his grip on the gun and took aim. Eurus’ eyes widened, breathlessly staring at Sherlock.
“Well,” John sniffs, “on, with it then.” Sherlock blinked rapidly and bit his lips. John sighed, exasperated. “Sherlock, I have things to do. Quickly, please? What is it?” 221B was replaced by Moriarty’s red-tinted face.
John spray paints the familiar smiley face before stepping back to look at Sherlock, who raises a pistol.
“And here we are, at the end of the line. Homes killing Holmes.” Mycroft shifted uncomfortably ever so slightly while Sherlock continued to stare at his brother, determination in his narrowing eyes.
Thank you all so much for sticking with me through my unreliable updates! I love you all so much for all of your positivity about my writing. Thank you so much! <3
The next chapter will be the next challenge they faced (duh), but instead of John and Mycroft, it'll be Lestrade and Mycroft. Also, the "ID" is a Freudian idea, that is the animalistic side of your "persona."
calling,” Sherlock said, growing more agitated. John lowered the paper to look at his phone again. The clock reaches 02:27 as his voicemail starts.
“What happened to him?” Lestrade asked, speaking for the first time since he was pulled from the well.
Sherlock, Lestrade, and Mycroft walked into a room. There was a small wooden coffin in the middle of the room. Eurus's face appeared on a wall next to the open door.
“It’s very important. I can’t say why, but I promise you it is.” Sherlock agitatedly tapped the gun to his thigh.
“Say it. Say it like you mean it.” Running his hand over his mouth, Sherlock glanced at Mycroft who is still in shock, Lestrade seems to be in a similar state.
“Please, I swear you just have to listen to me!” Sherlock was doing a very poor job of trying to be calm.
“Come on, John, answer the damn phone,” Lestrade said tightly. When Sherlock heard John answer, he looked up.
Mycroft frowned and walked over to the lid of the coffin, leaning against a wall. Sherlock’s eyes started flicking from side to side, organizing invisible data.
The lovely “a-ship-in-every-port (lathir)” asked if I could write a chapter with Sherlock and John meeting after “The Final Problem” and I’m happy to oblige!
“In your own time.” Eurus’s face was replaced by the storm outside. Sherlock picked up the lid robotically and walked toward the coffin. Mycroft and Lestrade had started toward the door, but stopped, seeing Sherlock not following. He placed the lid on the coffin and lowers his eyes. His breath caught and a sob choked out.
Sherlock’s voice was quiet and urgent. “John, I just want you to do something very easy for me, and not ask why.”
Sherlock gasped, looking like the weight of the world has been lifted from his shoulders. Both Lestrade and Mycroft let out a sigh of relief. Sherlock buried his head in his hands, crouching down.  The countdown stopped at 00:02. The screen showed John, face hidden from the camera, body shaking in silent sobs. Mycroft reached out, in an attempt to console his brother, but Sherlock straightened up, tears still on his face.
“I love you.” John quietly sighed, letting a small smile appear on his ashen face. Sherlock looked up at John, softly repeating the words, “I love you.”  John took the phone from his ear and looks at the screen for a moment. Sherlock was almost hyperventilating, thinking he’s going to hang up.
“Sherlock?” Lestrade stepped warily toward the figure crumpled over the coffin. Sherlock stood up and unbuttoned his jacket.
“Make it swift,” Mycroft says, looking away from Lestrade. “No need to prolong his agony. Get it over with, and we can get to work.”
The three men walked to a large white and gray room. Sherlock glanced around, there’s no windows or decorations.
“Sherlock,” John took in a quick breath before pushing forward. “I understand.” He glanced at Lestrade before continuing “Lestrade explained. Everything, I mean.”
"Coffin. Problem: someone is about to die. It will be- as I understand it- a tragedy." Sherlock stared at the coffin, rubbing the thumb of his gun hand over his brow. "So many days not lived, so many words unsaid. Et cetera, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera." Eurus's face morphed from a poor excuse of sadness to sarcasm in a matter of words.
“Which is why this is going to be so much harder.” Sherlock faced Mycroft, aiming the gun at him. Eurus seemed to almost show a true smile. Mycroft smiled ruefully at Sherlock.
Lestrade shook his head, shifting his weight, “No, obviously, it isn’t, otherwise I wouldn’t have asked-”
“Yes, but why isn’t he answering his phone?” Sherlock's eyes flit back and forth from John to the timer.
“Sherlock, stop that at once!” A dart flew out of a hole in the wall and hit Sherlock in the back of his head. He reached up and pulled it out with his left hand.
“All those complicated little emotions. I lost count. Emotional context, Sherlock. It destroys you every time.” Eurus continued to stare at Sherlock. He walked past the coffin to the lid, dropping the pistol. Eurus sits back in her chair,
“Oh, one important restriction:" Eurus smiled. "You’re not allowed to mention, in any way at all that his life is in danger.” Sherlock grimaced. He faced the screen. “You may not – at any point- suggest that there is any form of crisis. If you do, I will end this session and his life. Are we clear?” Sherlock nodded, mechanically, and stepped closer to the screen, the speed dial ringing in their ear
“Now, please pull yourself together. I need you at peak efficiency. The next one isn’t going to be so easy.” A door slid open; Mycroft turned to look at the noise. Lestrade took a step toward Sherlock, opening his mouth, but closes it and drops his head.
“He is perfectly safe, for the moment.” Eurus makes the screen change to the flat of 221B, a countdown reading 3:00 in the top right corner. “Your flat is rigged to explode in approximately three minutes,” Sherlock had not moved from where he was standing by the coffin, his eyes fixed on the screen. On John. “Unless I hear the release code from his lips. I’m calling him on your phone, Sherlock. Make him say it.”
“Sherlock, I can’t have any idea what you’re going through. You’re being tortured. But, you’ve got to keep it together. That sister of yours? She’ll use that against you, more than she already has.” Lestrade’s voice strong, but quiet. Sherlock doesn’t lift his head as he speaks.
“Yes, very good, Sherlock,"  Mycroft interrupted "or we could just look at the name on the lid.” The brass shined off the dim light in the room, reflecting Sherlock’s annoyance. “Only it isn’t a name.” The brass plate reads “I love you”
“Two…” He slowly falls backward, eyes close, pistol falling out of his grip. He lands in a pool of thick black oil that seems to reach out for him and pulls him under the viscous liquid.
Sherlock stares at a strange collection of “dancing men” figures on a chalkboard. John, by his side, on his laptop.
“Pardon?” Dark brown eyes meet azure ones, for a second, there seemed to be a twinge of sadness in Mycroft’s eyes before it was replaced with his stoic expression. Turning to his brother, Mycroft said “Shoot Detective Gregory Lestrade. There’s no question who has to continue from here. It’s us; you and me. Whatever lies ahead requires brainpower, Sherlock, not sentiment. Don’t prolong his agony; shoot him.”
The lights turn red, Jim appears on the screen, Sherlock screws up his eyes, raked his hands through his hair before looking back up at Jim. The light changes back to normal.
Eurus was led away from the house by two police officers, tears still sparkling in her eyes. Police vehicles were parked all around, the faint sound of a helicopter nearby. Sherlock just watched. Lestrade stood beside him, wrapped in a grey blanket. John walked over to the two men.
“He’s reading the news,” Mycroft answered. He composed himself behind his brother. Sherlock glanced at the timer, it reads 02:39.
Sherlock is pacing in front of a client, John is diligently writing down details, neither seem bothered by the fact that the client is an old-fashioned ventriloquist’s dummy.
“You never answer yours, I assume, or is that privilege only for me,” Mycroft said, grimacing at his brother.
“I.. I can’t say that to you, Sherlock. I can’t” John’s voice was quiet and vulnerable. Sherlock, on the other hand, was incredulous.
“No. No.” He muttered. His normally inexpressive face twisted in rage. He brought his right hand back and crashed it down on the lid of the coffin, splintering it.  The scene became animalistic, Sherlock giving himself to his ID, smashing, destroying the coffin in hope that the ghost it held would be gone. He was no longer a man, he was a cornered animal, screaming in anguish, trembling on the shattered remains of the coffin. Tears of grief, rage, and pure frustration fall like the rain outside.
“John, please, without asking why just say these words.”  John, seeming intrigued, Sherlock almost never said please.
John stood in their living room, looking through the mail when he saw a white padded envelope with “Special Delivery” stamped on it. John called for Sherlock, opening the letter.
The flat has been restored, looking almost the same as when John first stepped foot into 221B. John sits on the sofa, Sherlock is next to him. He reaches his hand out to hold John’s.
Eurus replaced John’s shaking form with her own face. She made a withering sound and asked, “Saved him? From what?” She chuckled. “Oh do be sensible. There were no explosives in your flat. Why would I be so clumsy? You
“Oh fuck, Sherlock-” he had to pause to lick his lips, his throat felt dry. “God, I would really want that too, you know. I... I'm just worried it might be too much. Something you'll regret. Or that I might hurt you. This is so perfect, just like it is. I don't need anything more, I hope you know that?”
It was dangerously close to being too much. John put his phone down on the table again, closed his eyes. He thought that he would probably never be able to sleep again, but somehow, eventually, he was. There were no dreams and no nightmares.
John runs his hands over Sherlock’s stomach, arms, sides, pecs. Pinches his nipples, hard, both at the same time.
He’s getting ridiculously hard again, pants tenting just below John’s face. Could have been embarrassing but isn’t. Maybe that’s because it’s John, he thinks fleetingly.
”It’s not enough that we took our shoes and socks off in a restaurant; now you think I should put my dirty feet up on their radiator?” John said, so happy the easy mood had returned again.
“I don't know the answer to this question,” Dr. Riyat had continued, back to his normal, gentle manners again. “Every thing I could say would be a guess. The only way for you to find out, is to ask him directly. But if you do, I want you to be certain you are strong enough to handle all potential answers, okay?”
John held it by the collar and coaxed it out of the door. His experience with dogs amounted to exactly zero, but he figured the same principles should apply as for humans.
Sherlock sighed, got up again, opened the door slightly. The dog barged in through the narrow crack, jumped up in the bed again, laid down with a heavy thump.
When John comes in, it takes Sherlock about a tenth of a second to see that it was a mistake to allow John time by himself. He’s still fully dressed. He’s blinking more frequently than when in a relaxed (or aroused) state, and he’s not immediately coming up to Sherlock even though he’s standing there, ready, waiting.
”What?” John said, not really believing this last piece of information. ”To the classical station I take it? Was it Wagner?”
As a part of his military training, he had been taught both theory and practice of how to deal with psychological threats. He tried to bring to mind the basics of what he'd learned.
Sherlock didn’t even see it coming, didn’t even know exactly how it had happened, but suddenly John was bent over him, holding Sherlock’s wrists in an iron grip over his head, pressing them down into the mattress.
Without thinking, John finds himself reaching out to touch Sherlock’s cheek. This time, Sherlock doesn’t flinch.
Sherlock doesn't understand what he means, but really doesn't want to hear more, anyway. Tries to push away the uncomfortable feeling inside.
”Well actually,” John says to the aunt, ”physical activity can often be the best medicine for arthritis pain. But the effects won’t come overnight, I’m afraid. You need to try to stick with it, find a routine that works for you.”
”So, how about that hobby detective work you were doing before?” Richard, one of the other doctors, had a slight smirk on his face.
”John!” Sherlock stuttered out, and when John started to move his hand, Sherlock threw his head back into the pillow. He stroked him slowly, gently, and Sherlock whimpered. He smiled at Sherlock’s response, felt his own dick fill and get even harder.
”I’m gonna come,” he stutters, slamming hard into Sherlock, the hard slapping sound from skin on skin filling the room before he stills, tips over.
”It’s hard, I know,” Caroline says. Another pause. ”Any chance that the two of you might patch it up?”
He had a hard time acting normal around Mary. He worried, irrationally, that she would be able to read his thoughts just by looking at him, just like Sherlock would have, and John tried to stay away from her as much as he could. But on Saturday evening, there was no escape from sitting down together to have dinner, Anna at long last asleep in her crib.
It reminded John of how difficult it would often be for Sherlock to navigate muddy, interpersonal waters. Perhaps John just needed to understand the reason behind Sherlock’s retreat. He made a promise to himself to try to calm down.
Deletes the last message. Continuous effort to school his breathing, to keep the anxiety from escalating into panic. Inhales, then holds his breath. Exhales.
”Boys, stop it!” Mummy is looking angrily first at him, then at Mycroft. Then she seems to calm down again, turns to John.
”You must be insane,” Sherlock panted. ”If you don’t fuck me tonight, I swear I’m going to kill you.”
John looks at him; up, down, up again. Appears surprised - embarrassed? Sherlock will not let himself be dragged into it.
That was the color of John in Sherlock's mind. Turquoise green before his eyes, when he closed them.
”Him,” she corrected. ”His name is Doctor Kumar Riyat. He’s been with us for three years now, and he’s very good at what he does.”
”Sweetie, come here.” He sits down on his knees, stretches his arms out and she runs up to him, squeezes him as hard as her tiny arms can manage.
Or maybe he’d just crawled down under the duvet, kissed his way along John’s body, pushed his pants aside and swallowed him down. Sucked him languidly, because there had been no rush. The taste of John on his tongue…
”There’s so much stuff. Hmm. That I should say. That I have been meaning to say to you, for a long time now, but. Never did. And now there’s no time and I wanted to see you before today and you could’ve picked up the goddamn phone but-”
The rhythm of their hips, their cocks, thrusting into his hand in synchrony. The noises John made and that Sherlock found himself responding to so strongly that he sometimes was afraid he’d come.
John caught himself with his mouth gaping open. He could not think of a single thing to reply. He needn't, though, because Sherlock apparently had more to say. He had scooted forward in his chair, was sitting on the edge of it now, closely observing John.
”Sherlock,” John spoke gently. He was still a little bit out of breath, his voice was hoarse. ’Look at me.”
And Sherlock remembered his analysis of John, from years ago, their very first night, when John had shot the serial killer cabbie.
The mess he’d seen before was completely gone, not a single paper in sight. The walls had been repainted in a soft yellow hue, and the roof was a dark blue, with small plastic stars scattered all over, it looked like the kind that glows in the dark. His old bed had a new, smaller duvet and new pillows, and was made up in an adorable bed set with a butterfly motif. The bedside table had been painted white, and on top of it was a lamp in the shape of a rabbit. The carpet was replaced; the new one looked so clean and fluffy that John hardly wanted to step on it, and new curtains were up in the window.
