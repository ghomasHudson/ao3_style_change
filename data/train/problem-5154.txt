Jack disappeared pretty quick after patching Dean up, mentioning something about rebuilding Heaven. Dean guessed that had been what the kid meant by the afterlife not being ready for him.
“Why is that…important right now?” He choked, his jeans tight and his lips pounding with his heartbeat.
“They’re not working alone, are they?” Dean asked sharply. Chuck or not, hunts were still stupid to do alone. Although, under that logic, that would make Dean stupid too, but he could be a hypocrite about this.
Dean groaned in protest as Jody’s laughter erupted over the phone. He stared miserably at the sword on the table, feeling the sudden urge to smack his head into it.
“These are healthier and they treat their chickens better.” Cas snapped. “We are getting these.”
“Okay.” He choked out. His voice was suddenly raspy and gritty. “Yeah, we can…we can do that.”
“Thanks, Dean.” Jody’s laugh trickled down into a voice filled with smile. “Anywho, that’s not why I called.”
“Dunno. He’s been ducking out for a few hours every week or so. Just assumed he was seeing some chick.” Dean grunted. That only made Jack frown deeper.
the things you
“Hutch’s?” Cas asked expectantly when they both slid into the car. Sam kneed the back of the bench rather aggressively.
There was a loud thud, a crash of breaking glass, and Sam swearing loudly. Cas leapt to his feet. Dean hadn’t even processed what had happened yet.
Hutch’s was moderately busy when they got there, so they managed to snag a corner booth. Dean had been scanning faces in the crowd and saw no glimpse of the waitress. It released some tension from his shoulders.
care but not like
It took him nearly an hour to force away that gaping hole in his chest as he berated himself for thinking he owed Cas or something. But in the end, where Dean always seemed to end up, he landed on anger. The pitiful ache morphed into annoyance that Cas couldn’t seem to last a month without fleeing away from Dean. He hated that Cas had such terrible taste in women that he thought Miss. Bouncy was a good candidate. She didn’t deserve Cas—he was a fucking
“You never call this early in the morning.” He said sheepishly.
“Wanna help me out here?”
With Sam, Dean had lost his little brother, his kid. He had lost all sense of responsibility, wallowing in his failure to protect him from harm. Who was Dean Winchester without his lanky, gigantor nerd brother?
“That isn’t a fair match. Your legs are unusually longer than the average human’s—“
“What the hell makes you think I don’t want you?” He demanded quietly between the space their breathes shared. He glowered right into Cas’ watery blue eyes, begging him to see through him like he always did and believe he was telling the truth. “How could you think I’d be better off without you in my life, you goddamn idiot?”
Sam ranted on about the new Bunker operation and how he and Eileen were going to spend a few months getting hunters settled in before getting a place of their own. The place had already been cleared out of anything dangerous that unknowing hunters might stumble across and they had finally relocated the last of Cas’ garden. It had been completely fleshed out, leaving the dangerous items to live in Dean and Cas’ attic. The rest of the Men of Letters’ resources stayed, available to hunters for research. Sam was still rambling about a security spell he put on the Bunker that stopped people from taking items outside the premises, but Dean was distracted by an aching familiar feeling in his chest.
“What about you, handsome?”
—doesn’t mean you get to just fuck off and not go with hunts anymore.”
“Damnit, Jack. Quit popping in like that.” He brushed roughly through the wet beer spot on his jeans, only to find it had disappeared a moment later with a shimmer of God mojo.
“Not like I was looking for it.” Dean said somewhat indignantly. Sam’s lips twitched and he was blinking rather rapidly. “Alright, sasquatch. C’mon.”
There was a throaty hitch deep in Cas’ chest when Dean’s hands rose to cup his face. His eyelids were trembling as unshed tears wobbled right on the edge, and Dean couldn’t stand it. He had never seen Cas cry before, not like this, vulnerable and hopeless. He
The house still lacked the warm, lived-in feeling that only came with time, but now that they finally had everything tied up and squared away, Dean knew it was only a matter of time before the house got that feeling again.
with the effort not to smash their lips together. “How…how the fuck am I supposed to top that?”
Dean thought fondly.
Dean slid a plate of bacon and eggs in front of Cas, who grunted in thanks.
He’d never admit it to a goddamn soul, but Dean Winchester was getting soft. He knew this and chose to ignore it. Sure, Sam had caught him wearing those comfy socks with pizza patterns on them and everyone in the Bunker knew his love for wearing the Dead Guy robe all day and cooking in the kitchen. He was sure Cas had noticed there was only ever coffee in the pot because Dean woke up before him and Sam to brew it and when he couldn’t be found he was either giving Baby a wash or watching comfort movies in the Dean cave. In his core, he was a homebody. His life has just never allowed for it before.
Cas had a thing with that waitress. He had found someone else.
“Having sex in the Impala has been very high on my wish list.” Cas informed him in that rumbling, gravely voice of his that had no business being so sexy. That damn thumb kept brushing feather light over his lips and it was driving him nuts.
“Thought you were in Arkansas.” He grunted instead, collapsing in the chair next to Cas as Sam disappeared for the shower. He always let Sam go first.
he was supposed to work out? His internalized gender and daddy issues? There had probably been a lot of shit Dean said without realizing he was just echoing his father’s mentality.
“When are you not going to greet me like that?” Eileen’s amused voice, tinny from the speakers, replied. Dean grinned when Sam flushed.
“There is it.” Cas whispered, turning his head slightly to gaze at the scarlet-orange fireball peeking over the forest canopy. “Look.”
Something about those words didn’t make sense. Bobby’s place, the scrapyard and farmhouse and the closest place to a home Dean and Sam had almost their entire lives up for sale? Up for someone else buying it,
“It doesn’t matter. It’s over. The Empty is no longer a threat.” He said flatly.
“They
It was a daunting task to take on, but what else was he gonna do? Less and less of his time was spent hunting, and if he bought Bobby’s place…it could be his ticket out for good. He was tired of hunting, of constantly putting his life at risk. He was getting too old for it too. Sooner or later he was gonna throw out his back on a case and get murked.
The waitress smiled extra big at that and winked. Dean figured Cas was only acting casual because he still hadn’t told him and Sam about his little fling.
“Damn well will be.” Dean grunted, hearing the water shut off and standing to take his turn in the shower. He opened his mouth to say something like
“No.” Cas said sweetly.
Dean didn’t want to look up and see the embarrassed flush on Cas’ face on being found out. He didn’t want to hear him say all matter-of-factly that he already knew her
, how the hell did you even summon the Empty in the first place? I’ve watched the security footage, Cas,
“I’ve been going to a nursery.”
“And, uh…w-what are the things you want, Cas?”
in his head with Cas not around to fluster him, but the case in Indiana turned out to be more eventful than he had expected. It was a tag team comprising of a ghoul and shifter working together, and both brothers had been kept up practically day and night as victims disappeared left and right. It was just one of those cases, the bad ones that left a clammy pit of failure in Dean’s chest. Both he and Sam were tired and miserable when they finally made it back home.
That made Dean’s head jerk up. He stared at Cas, confused out of his goddamn mind.
Dean made burgers that night, and Sam didn’t even complain about the lack of vegetables.
When the waitress came back with their drinks, Dean noticed Cas’ was topped off with an apple slice.
With power solely in Jack’s hands now, both of the backseat passengers turned their attention to him.
Cas was leaving for a few hours and wouldn’t tell Dean where he was going. Had he picked up on his dislike for the waitress and was hiding the fact that he was going to see her because of it?
once, he didn’t exactly have a leg to stand on. So what if Jack wanted to wear dresses? He was
“I did. But it is much more enjoyable to fight over little things like this when the world is safe and I’m free to pursue the things I want.”
Dean felt dizzy with relief. Cas was fine. He wasn’t missing or kidnapped or anything—
“Ah.” Cas said delicately, suddenly very interested in his coffee. “Yes, she did.”
Cas squinted at him.
“He was…his desperation rung louder than any prayer I was hearing at the time. His anguish and fear were like those big speakers Sam has in the gym. Made his prayer loud.”
Was the next thought.
What if none of that was the problem, but he just couldn’t find Cas after all? What if something had happened to him?
“Hey! Watch it, dude!” He snapped, whipping his hands back just in time. Dean didn’t even hear him. He just clenched his jaw and glared at the empty space. Vaguely, he heard Sam let out an exasperated huff and lumber further into the Bunker.
A dark flare burned brightly in Cas’ eyes, clearly reliving of their activities the night before. Dean was still pleasantly sore.
“Don’t—just forget I—it doesn’t matter.” He growled. “Doesn’t change that y’did it, so forget it.”
He put the trench coat back, but Dean couldn’t help but eye it critically as he passed. He didn’t have a flannel in that pattern, did he?
So the lack of hunts didn’t bother him. There was plenty to do around here anyways—prank Sam, hang out with Cas since they were two old farts with nothing better to do, have some Alone Time in his room because hey, erectile dysfunction could happen to anyone and Dean wanted to get his dues before it potentially happened to him.
leaving him—
“He likes it.” He mumbled. “‘Should get what he wants.”
that way. So if he hadn’t been leaving the Bunker to see June, where the hell was he going? Where could he be going that he had to keep a secret from Dean?
There was no apple in Cas’ cider this time, and “handsome” was out of June’s vocabulary. She spent the rest of the evening pointedly
“I knew Chuck was closing in on me. I was the one wild card and he needed to wipe me out. I went alone because if you had come with me, I would have made the same choice.”
, Dean Winchester, more than stardust and cosmos and starlight. You deserve every good thing that has come your way and every good thing you wish you could have.”
wanted to leave given the choice—“
“I don’t think he’d want to be interrupted.” Dean mumbled.
“Jesus Christ, Cas.” Dean choked, his entire body
“Y-Yeah.” He said, swallowing harshly. “D-d-don’t do that again.”
Dean hadn’t noticed the rebar until it was too late.
Honestly? Dean had been expecting a lot more.
He decided he hated it. He has gotten pretty comfy being able to look around and find the ex angel nearby, and he had caught himself opening his mouth to tell Cas something only to remind himself that he wasn’t there.
Dean bit down hard on his tongue to stop all these thoughts from spilling out. As Jack jabbered away enthusiastically with Cas about the dress, Dean realized something very important—
. Instead of the usual cold drop in his stomach and wave of self loathing, his blood immediately began to boil. He glared at the empty space where Cas parked his truck, almost slamming Baby’s trunk on Sam’s fingers.
“Take us home, Dean.”
“Have you ever had guacamole?” Dean asked.
Dean felt his cheeks burn under the attention and gratitude for something that wasn’t a big deal.
you back there but you decided to be
The thrift store owner clearly favored John’s views and had opened his mouth to give his unwanted opinion, but three burly tall men death-glaring from behind a cheery, doe-eyed kid had evidently changed his mind. He clammed up and scanned the price tag.
The first thing he did when he got off the phone was grab Sam’s laptop and look up the listing. He winced at the photos the website offered—the ashy remains of Bobby’s house had basically crumbled to rubble. The scrapyard was filled with the same cars but ten years rustier, and the backyard was overgrown and wild. It was more than a fixer upper, there was basically nothing to fix. He’d have to start from the ground up.
“Without my powers—“
“I came to say hello.” Jack said simply, sitting down with his hands resting on his knees. A very Cas-like gesture. “I have some free time between reconstruction, and I wanted to spend it here. At home.”
Dean cut him off with a murderous glare before fixing his eyes back on the road, his shoulders hunched.
“You didn’t put on sunscreen? You can tan all you want, Cas, but skin cancer’s a real thing for you now.” He wanted Cas to look after himself. He was vulnerable as a human, in more ways than one. It would be total bullshit for Cas to survive death so many times just to succumb to something as human as melanoma.
also came to mind.
They headed out, Cas beside Dean as Sam walked unnaturally fast for the exit. The hosts big them goodnight and Dean was about to tell Cas there was some pie waiting back at the Bunker when two things happened.
They busted into the abandoned barn to find a group of five vamps wearing skeleton masks inside.
“Can I get drinks for y’all?” She asked in a Tennessee accent, not even taking her stark gray eyes off Cas. Dean felt his fingers twitch from where they rested on the tabletop.
“Don’t say shit like that, man. You’ll have me thinking I’m somethin’ special.”
“Too bad this ain’t my table.” She pouted.
. The joy I felt in telling Chuck my happiness,” Dean glanced over to see Cas’ eyes had closed, a small smile playing on his lips like he was reliving a wonderful memory. “—paired with the satisfaction that it was the ultimate rebellion against his story, it was unlike anything I’d ever felt before.”
“Well,” Dean spat. “while you were out h
“I imagine it was not what you were expecting, but I am grateful you didn’t say anything about humanity’s gender expectations in regards to apparel.”
Dean lurked around the Bunker for the next hour, stewing silently in annoyance and self pity. Sam, who had undoubtedly sensed his turbulent mood, had sequestered himself in some far off corner of the Bunker so Dean couldn’t find him and pick a fight. God, he was itching for one too.
The next morning, Dean was feeling better. He had spent the rest of the night repressing his newfound discovery as he had been doing with his emotions since he was a kid. He wasn’t sure he wouldn’t glitch out if he saw Cas, but at least he forced himself to go and make breakfast as usual so no one would get suspicious.
Cas disappeared from the Bunker a few days later, as did his car. No warning, no “I’m going on another errand I won’t tell you about”, just gone.
Dean raised an eyebrow.
from across the parking lot and Cas’ head swiveled as someone behind him tapped his shoulder.
“Because I am not, nor have ever been, romantically or physically interested in women.”
buys the place.” Jody chuckled. “I’ll bring Donna and the girls to help fix it up.”
Jesus, he really was Cas’ kid, wasn’t he?
, for Christ’s sake.”
“Yeah?” He needled, his lips quirking into a teasing smirk, wanting to see that pink darken. Cas was pointedly
“What the
“Yes, it is quite nice to be back here.”
Cas squinted at him.
“I have not been leaving to meet June.” He said flatly. “Regardless, even before that—“
“Bring the car here, I’ll patch her up.” He offered, although it was more of an order. “Shop’ll do the work all day and pay you twice as much. Sam can take the tow truck and meet you.”
A flicker of something flitted across Cas’ face, but it was smoothed over before Dean could even begin to process it. The corners of his mouth ticked up.
“I could do that, but I fear I would be wasting my time.” Cas said as casually as a summer breeze. What the hell did that mean? Were they just fuck buddies? Did June not want to know Cas more, and if not, why
“I am your father.” Cas rumbled over him like some kind of competitive Darth Vader. Dean gleefully listened to the drama unfold as he drove them to Hutch’s.
“How could you think I didn’t want you?” He whispered.
“No.”
Sam attempted to pull him into another conversation, but Dean just snapped at him. That earned him a glare from across the booth and paired with Cas’ stony coldness from beside him, it turned out to be a pretty miserable outing.
Dean clammed up with the self-deprecating and let the gratefulness exist between them.
“See you around, Dean.”
whatever her name was.” Dean flapped a hand dismissively before returning it right back to Cas’ cheek like a magnet. “Y’kept leaving all the time after the diner and since she gave you here number, I…I thought you were…”
“Oh.” Cas breathed, his body relaxing against him again. “My garden—“
“I think she’s good.” Dean called, and Cas shut off the car again and ducked out. He dropped the keys back in his hand, and Dean tried not to focus on the tingle he felt where Cas’ fingers brushed his palm.
The more Cas claimed shotgun, the more the questions burned in the back of Dean’s throat. He never actually got around to figuring out that twisty, ugly feeling he had when Cas first came back, but ever since there had been this little niggle in the back of his mind that there was something he needed to figure out. Something that had probably always been there and wasn’t going to let Dean’s excellent repression skills paralyze it anymore. There was
“It’s nothing important.” Cas deflected yet again. “Just an errand.”
The voice sneered.
There was an ugly, twisting feeling rising up in his chest that Dean couldn’t quite identify and before he could look at in in detail, bright blue eyes were suddenly boring into his.
“Okay then.” They fell into a mostly comfortable silence. Cas leaned against Baby’s side while he watched Dean fiddle with the engine and tighten some bolts. He got landed with turning the car on and off when Dean told him to, frowning down at the maze of metal and tubes and listening for any more wheezing.
It had been a few weeks since Cas came back, and since that time he’d stopped giving a shit about
cooler than that thing.” He protested. Cas quirked an eyebrow, eyes twinkling with amusement. But he didn’t say anything, just turned and smiled to Jack.
“A quiet day, then.”
The door swung open with a soft screech, and Dean blinked at Cas, his hand still raised dumbly between them for the handle that wasn’t there anymore.
“Oh yeah, apart from the massive bruise and cracked rib!” Dean snapped. “Just peachy!”
“See you in an hour, Sam!” She chirped, and hung up before Dean got a chance to call her out on her con.
Or was he? Dean had been making an awful lot of assumptions about all this. Maybe it was just a coffee date. Or maybe a different girl altogether. Cas was too classy to put out on the first date, and since this was the first “errand” he could only assume so.
“Thank you?”
“I could locate him, if you wanted.” Jack offered.
Dean stared at his burger for probably five minutes before he felt Sam kick him under the table. He jumped, nearly crushing his burger in his hands, before finally managing to get his head on straight and act like a normal fucking person. So what if their legs were touching? If Cas wasn’t making a big deal out of it, neither was he.
At first, it was just a dry press of lips, still awesome in its own right, and Cas let out this broken little sound in the back of his throat, his fingers clutching Dean’s so hard it was like he were afraid he’d disappear. Both of them seemed frozen in place, shocked that neither one of them were yanking away.
He berated himself silently. Instead, he just shoved his hands in his pockets and scowled from behind Cas.
They went to a thrift store at Sam and Cas’ insistence (something about being better for the environment), but really Dean had pulled into the parking lot because thrift stores were what he was used to. He bought all of his and Sammy’s clothes from second hand shops growing up. They were easy, cheap, and the people were usually nice. Retail stores always seemed too fancy for him.
He didn’t dare look at Cas, an instinct telling him any movement would discourage Cas from whatever he was building himself up to saying.
Before he could talk himself out of it, Dean pressed his lips quick to the top of Jack’s dirt blonde head, feeling the kid’s smile grow wider. When they finally broke apart, Cas was looking at him with a soft expression on his face. His eyes were shining with something that looked like gratitude and pride and…something else.
Dean didn’t want to go to Hutch’s. But seeing how Sam’s glower intensified the moment slight hesitation crossed his face, he decided against going somewhere else.
Not even ten minutes into waiting for their food did Dean feel the startling press of Cas’ warm thigh against his—just like last time. He nearly jumped out of the booth at the contact, but he managed to dial it down to a slight twitch. Cas wasn’t even paying attention, almost absentmindedly tying the paper wrapper of his straw into a knot and pulling on both ends, all while talking to Sam about something nerdy.
but the words that came barreling for his lips were
The inaction was rewarded a moment later when Cas’ voice murmured, so quietly he almost couldn’t hear him over Baby’s rumble.
Dean flinched at the loud noise before rolling his eyes, his hands still balled into fists from his reaction. He glared ahead as Sam and Cas bickered on either side of him, walking across the parking lot towards Baby. People passing by where giving them weird looks—two grown ass men fighting over the passenger seat? ‘Course they were getting weird looks.
“It was my fault.” Cas said quietly. “That you got hurt. That you almost
“You big, fat, pants-on-fire liar.” His indignant tone didn’t quite land with the amused smile tugging his lips up. Cas just shot him a sly grin.
“Shit, where’s the witch hazel—?!”
Jack appeared again one day over lunch, announcing he would like to go clothes shopping. Dean wondered why the kid couldn’t just conjure whatever he wanted, but he seemed more interested in the experience than actually buying anything.
, had he realized their legs had been touching? Was he pissed at Dean for not moving quickly enough, not trying to put space between them sooner?
“Hello, Dean.”
Dean swore, jerking and spilling the bottle of the beer resting against his propped up legs. His boots hit the floor with a loud smack as he caught himself before he could fall out of the goddamn chair. Dean looked up to see Jack standing nearby, and plunked his bottle down with a loud thud.
Dean raised an eyebrow at him.
“That’s what I’m asking.” Dean mumbled.
Cas practically bellowed, his rumbling voice echoing down the Bunker’s corridors so powerfully that Dean could hear him from the garage. They were heading out for dinner tonight. Dean wasn’t in the mood to cook and it was bottomless steak fries night at the Hutch’s diner.
, and Dean needed to figure out what. He was already miserable and sulky that Cas was getting laid, that he
Dean felt his heart skip and a warm glow filled his chest.
“Good.” Dean grunted, kicking out a chair for Jack to sit. “What’re you doin’ here, kid?”
, so whatever romance we may have had was constructed purely on her part.”
“If y’gonna phrase it like that, Sammy, it’s a case.”
Cas’ hands suddenly gripped his wrists. His fingers twitched.
Sam’s argument got interrupted by a phone call, and Cas slid into the passenger seat before he could stop him. Glowering, his brother ducked into the backseat again.
Dean shook his head.
“When you stop doubting your self worth.” Cas bargained. His warm hands trailed blazes as they traveled up to clutch Dean’s hands against his face. “You are worth
“Of all the ways I was shown your death.” Cas said, so quiet that Dean figured he was talking to himself. “I doubt it could have ever imagined up something like this.”
He said vehemently, tugging him impossibly closer before he could get the wrong idea in his head and pull back. “I mean, yeah at some point but…’was gonna—“
It was just before sunrise when Dean woke up to find the pillow next to him empty. He was tired—after the emotional talk with Cas, the sex, the drive back, explaining everything to Sam and Eileen, the sex—Dean pretty much conked out afterwards with his arms and legs wound around Cas like a goddamn octopus.
anyway, he probably gets all sorts of unintentional prayers while people are going at it.
“Why?”
Gripping Cas’ face tightly but gently between his hands, Dean glared at him through every frustrated word he uttered.
Cas sat in the passenger seat on the drive home. Dean’s hands are sticky with pistachio and mint chocolate chip ice cream. He had to eat what Jack didn’t finish, and to the kid’s credit, it didn’t taste half bad. Maybe going by favorite color had been a good choice.
“You prayed to Jack to come fix me.”
The case was at the Daphne Orleans Hotel, and it didn’t take long for Dean to piece together why they were the ones taking this case instead of another hunter. Sam was a nerd on a good day, but he went full-on Einstein about this place. The hotel had been famously haunted for decades, there were stories for miles about how the ghosts came to haunt the place.
“And you, handsome?”
Dean almost physically shook his head to shake away the odd thoughts. Why did he care again? He didn’t, that’s why. It was just him adjusting to Cas’ new style after twelve-some-odd years of his holy tax accountant getup.
He hadn’t been a good enough friend to realize just how much Cas had been mourning the loss of his wings, but he was gonna try now.
“S’just omelets, Cas.” He mumbled. When he got the courage to look up again, Cas was giving him another soft smile. And
Dean ducked his head as his face grew hot.
nearly had him at full mast on the spot. He let out a desperate noise, twelve years of holding back manifesting in sheer need, and started rolling his hips.
“Um, hello.” Cas shifted, much more awkward than he had been before, probably trying not to give her the wrong idea. Dean took comfort in noticing how he held his hand a little tighter.
“What are you talking about, boy?” my father snarls, turning to me.
My vision starts to break apart, a feeling rising up through my stomach, up to my chest, pressing against my ribcage. My hips shudder forward at the same time my head is thrown even further back, I’m so close, so fucking—
“Yeah.” Dean half-chuckles. “I know what you mean.”
“I’m fine!” he replied, trying to smile despite his visible fear.
-Cas moved to New York after graduating university.
“Because I’ve got you. That makes me happy all the time.”
“Yeah. Sounds beautiful,” Dean replies distractedly. “Just something I was thinking about. I'm used to the stars. I miss ‘em sometimes, is all. Stupid, right?”
“What for?”
“I don’t know. I was bored.”
“No, no,” says Kendall. “Yeah they knew the old God or whatever, but my friend says that they defeated him, and their kid is the new God.”
Eager to be included, Rick has joined in with his own anecdote. He’s still green, but so was Claire not so very long ago—he may be a lot older than her, but they all respect each other here. She steals the rest of Alex’s fries and texts Jody that the hunt went well as she listens and waits for her order to arrive. She'll clean the grease off her phone later.
Cas fiddles with a hangnail. “Yes, of course. Well, I told you about coming out to my extended family, but I’ve come out before that, obviously. It's ongoing.”
“Huh.”
Chuck laughs awkwardly. “Sure. Look, it’s always nice to meet fans. I think I have some posters inside.” He moves to close the door, but Dean grabs ahold of the edge.
Dean gets waffles and bacon, Cas some pastry swirl. Well, he only orders the pastry, but then he steals half of Dean’s breakfast, too, though Dean can't bring himself to mind.
When Dean goes in, she doesn't watch him go.
"Alone, Dean," I sigh.
"Yeah?" I shout back.
“Sorry,” I say eventually, pulling it away and shoving it into my pocket. Jesus, it’s hot.
He coughs. “You caught me exercising. What’s so important?”
I stayed, pressed against the wall, breathing shallowly, until I finally gathered myself, convincing little Cas to open the bedroom door.
I sigh and grab him by the arm, pulling him into the room. Crap. He’s a lot heavier than I expected.
Deans heart skips a beat. “Wait, really?”
It was partially welcomed, but, hell, her quarantine lasted so long! She was an active lady, and sitting still for so long did no one any good. So, when Dean finally pulled back her cover, she breathed a sigh of relief along with the fresh air. She’d wondered what had happened since she'd been out of the game, and now she'd get a chance to have her questions answered.
, Trench admitted quietly.
“I like her,” Cas states, feeding his cash to the machine and picking out a granola bar. “Though I do feel like she’s been not-so-subtly begging me to come out for the past hour.”
“Dean, I don’t understand th—”
“You on acid?” he asks, putting a pint glass under the tap.
The closer they’d gotten, the tenser Cas had gotten, and, despite Dean’s frankly hilarious stories, they’d drifted into silence for the last few miles.
I watch them for a while, considering pretending to be a cop just to freak them out. It’s not like I’ve got anything better to.
“Well, I probably can’t help you a whole lot on that.” He adjusts his hands on the wheel. “What do you imagine he’ll be like?”
Having sat down last, Dean is the first back up. He loiters as everyone files out of the booth, and Cas waits with him, then as Dean turns to follow the group— “Let’s wait for them to order, it’ll take forever.”
After they drop Cas off on his date, (what? what did she miss when she zoned out?) Baby waits for Dean outside a thrift shop. She feels him slide onto her driver’s side and put a bag in the back. Just as she’s about to ready herself to start up, she registers what’s in the plastic bag and her breath catches.
“Well, honorable or not, he would’ve seen it differently. Probably would’ve kicked me out for half a dozen things I’ve chosen, least of all my degree,” Dean jokes. “Not fitting for his man of a son.”
“How soon the young folk forget,” Bruce grumbles, but he lays off. He turns. “Let this be a lesson, Andy—“
“I don’t know what happened, I just— I just freaked out on her.”
"Who do you think I am? Some sort of lying whore? You'd know a lot about them, wouldn't you, Charles? Considering you've slept with your share!" Through my tiny crack of vision into the room, I saw my mother grabbing a vase- blue with floral designs- and swiftly swing it across the room at my father. He ducked quickly, and it shattered on the wall behind him. I held my breath.
Castiel goes wide-eyed and reaches for his coat on the automan.
"Oh. I forgot."
Normally Dean would wait, hoping the silence was welcoming if the person wanted to continue. But he knows Cas can win any silence contest, so instead he prods, “What’s got you so upset?”
Im sorry
Cas just looks, and looks. “How glad?”
"Are you sure you want this?" he asks, to which I reply by groaning, nodding, and rolling my hips involuntarily all at once.
"Nursing. Looks like we're adjacent."
The question, though muffled, is sharp, and Dean can feel it hit him like a blow. He's ready for it, but it still throws him a bit. Cas turns back toward him, leaning against the counter. He’s almost close enough to touch, because it’s a small apartment, but he seems very far away.
"So, Cas. What's your major?”
PROJECT PATERNITY DEETS!
Halfway through his second one, he realizes his lighter is still heavy in his hand, and looks down at it. He eyes at the engraving, running his thumb over the name.
Dean looks back at it. He’s right, both of the showdown hands are horrible. Either they’re really bad at poker or trying to lose. He glares at Ash.
Cas' eyes are all the way open, after what seems like ages. He turns his head to Dean and shit, he caught him looking... but Dean really doesn't feel bad about it. He gives a lazy smile and then looks over at the fire. And if they lean into each other, if they are the only two mumbling into each other's personal space about Cas' theory on the edges of the sky and
Hannah nods. She knows what I mean.
Most of his professors are approachable, but there's something about Prof MacLeod that intimidates his students. Dean's asked him a few questions during office hours and he actually seems like a nice enough guy, (if not snarky as hell), but he causes intense speculation and fear among many of Dean's classmates.
Dean laughs. “Yeah, that’s Charlie. It’s either a personality trait or else she’s been hyped up on sugar and caffeine since I met her.” He retrieves a bottle of water from the machine’s slot.
, Baby tried to reassure herself. But… what are the chances that God-lightning strikes the same place twice?
Dean laughs, again. He can't seem to stop laughing in Cas' company. "A fallen angel and a cowboy."
“I didn’t realize we were playing two truths and a lie,” Benny shoots over his shoulder.
“School’s been weird without you. No one knows what happened to you.” We’re speaking in short sentences, attempting to cut ourselves off because we don’t know what to say. What is there to say? The last time I saw her, she was the view from the back of a police car. The last time I saw her, I pulled a gun.
Meg tsks. She turns and looks Dean straight in the face, and says with drunken directness, "Cas' parents want him to be a hotshot doctor, and he's too much of a doormat to say fuck 'em and take his own path."
Instead, he climbs off of me.
Slowly, they start talking. It's practically inevitable.
Hannah didn't tell them either.
Oh God.
"Oh." This is where I expect Dean to awkwardly climb off of me, and ask me if I could go back downstairs and if we could never talk about this.
Hannah bit her lip, deciding whether or not to take on the dare. Where we were swimming, the bottom was a good 8 or 9 feet down.
“Who are you?” I ask.
She’s Meg, and I’m Cas, and it’ll always be like that.
"Dean?" I call out, as I stroll through the hallway, poking my head into the living room. Sam's lying on the couch, scruffy long hair poking out in every direction. Most of his face is obscured by the book he's holding up in front of it, intently reading, but I see his eyes flicker up to meet mine.
Baby just stews for a second, but tries not to let it show. If she has Ove captive, she might as well get some answers. It’s been a long time, but his association with Trench still prickles a little.
"Hey! Dean-o! Move your ass!"
Dean looks up at me and immediately stops dead in his tracks, scanning me, his eyes going over my body from my head to my toes.
The "nah" is on his lips until Cas steps forward and offers Dean a hand up.
Gasping.
I watch a girl dancing. Whenever her long, blonde hair flips, streaks of color fly out into the air, whirring out of control before dissolving.
Dean chuckles. "Yeah, if you're 21. Are you 21 yet, Cas?"
Annoyance. Dean hears a text alert, then another, but he ignores them both, deepening the kiss. Cas responds in kind, hands moving to Dean’s sides; he runs his fingers down Dean’s flanks—
Dean had parked her in the dark, tarped, for what felt like forever. Baby partially welcomed the silence; the standoff against Lucifer was a lot to process, and she did so as she rested comfortably under her blanket.
“Three!” He jumps and runs up to Dean, who picks him up and puts him in his lap. “That’s right buddy,” he says.
"I'm Meg, obviously," she says, bringing one hand up to tap her chest, where her fingertips linger longer than necessary. "And this here is my errant Castiel, who was
I’m growing up to be very handsome, indeed.
With that, Castiel stepped out and Trench was gone.
"Oh my-" Hannah cut herself off by diving into the water, splashing, ducking into the darkness to find him.
"Hey, Sammy." Meg salutes him.
“Nope. Tell me the correct amount of normal trinucleotide repeats in the FMR1 gene, Dean.”
"Sure."
I stare up at the John Bonham poster on his ceiling, not moving, still in shock from what just happened.
I swallow. "Yeah, I'm fine. Just tripped up in the hallway." I feel bad lying to him, but I would feel even worse having to tell him that his own dad keeps a gun in his bedside drawer.
. This is a well-worn story, and they all nod.
“Your hand was better than mine, but you folded. That means you gotta strip, too.”
"Okay, okay, no more 'would you rather'! I get it!" Gabe laughs, nearly stumbling off of his bar stool.
I look around, only to see Gabe proudly drain his cup, slam it down onto the table, stand up, and raise his fist up into the air.
"By that he meant ‘drink responsibly and respect women.’" Meg gives a sweet smile, ignoring Gabe's whimpers.
That nearly had Dean’s heart stop.
—and not knowing why he felt that way was starting to piss him off.
“Very partial.”
“Thank you. Is it custom to not call for shotgun after your turn?” Jack asked, smoothing the linen skirt of his dress as they swept out of the garage and down the road.
“No, the girls’ve been hogging those up like crazy. It’s about Bobby’s old place.”
“When Jack died, I made a deal.” Cas told him, talking smoothly over Dean’s internal panicking. “The Empty was after him and I told it to take me instead.”
I called shotgun, I still get shotgun.”
“C’mon, man.” He complained, trying to grab Cas and haul him back in. But he stayed just out of reach.
“I thought I might go for a walk. There’s a field of wildflowers only a mile or so from here, and I wanted to watch the bees. What about you?”
Seconds turned into minutes. Dean started fiddling with the handle of his spoon.
“You comin’, Jack?”
He rolled out of bed, yanking on the dead guy robe and padding up the back staircase for the rooftop. The cold metal ached against his bare feet and he nearly met his demise tripping on the top step. He went to push open the door when he froze.
“Do you wear whatever you want to?”
“Thanks, Jack.” Sam said weakly, crushing their son in a hug. Dean rose to his feet unsteadily, noticing how Cas immediately moved to help despite knowing he had been healed. Jack smiled up at Sam before turning to Dean and Cas.
looking at Cas or Dean, much to his satisfaction.
“Coming right up, sugar.” The waitress chirped, and Dean felt his menu—which had been clutched in his free hand—get tugged out of his grip. Startled, he jerked back to life in time to see Cas tuck their menus back into the rack, which thankfully gave him an excuse to wrench his pinkie from where it was trapped.
Another sharp smack. Dean hadn’t even realized his eyes were closed.
Codependency wasn’t anything to freak out about, right? It certainly didn’t have anything to do with why his brain turned into mush whenever Cas touched him.
The ex-angel didn’t meet his gaze.
“I wasn’t aware my limited abilities were needed.” He murmured. “After the vampire hunt…”
“My knees are gonna kill me.”
“S’just a room, Cas.”
“So,” the word trembled, vulnerable and wary, in the space between them. “you wanna live with my traumatized ass?”
. Sam nearly got brained through the eye and you were over here ‘
Dean wondered if he got a last-minute text from the waitress asking for a meet up and he had to book it. He hated that that was probably the case.
Then he was gone again, leaving Dean to stare down at his soggy bowl of cereal.
“I’ll distract you.”
So. Cas dying again. Coming back. Not knowing what he said to summon his deal.
“I called it first!”
He was in love with Cas.
“Bull-fucking-shit and you know it.” He plowed further. “What is it?”
Dean just shook his head as he moved around to the driver’s side of the Impala.
to grow? I mean, I don’t know much about trees, but doesn’t it take a while to get big like these?”
He clamped his mouth shut before the words could spill out. It was too vulnerable, too close to that
“It hasn’t been a popular site, from what I’ve seen. They’re selling it pretty cheap. The scrapyard too. Just thought I’d oughta let you know.”
But most important in my list of impossible things that I could do: I could sit on this roof until I float off into the color-changing sky, into space.
I open the door to his room, cautiously. It's the only room in Dean's house that I don't know well. Hell, I've even spent hours in Sam's room, because it's where they keep the Atari.
"Don't be scared! Never be scared of anything, Cas!"
All of this until he’s here, with Cas asleep at his side. It’s not a big bed, and the warmth of a body is close to him. He’s promised himself to be a good friend, though, (even if that's mostly failed), so he just watches Cas breathe slowly and makes sure none of their limbs are touching before he falls asleep himself.
"I think I am, really. I think I'm fuckin' terrified of what they're tellin' us. It makes me never wanna leave the safety of the suburbs."
Nothing is okay, nothing—
I've been wanting to write this for a while now. It's not exactly a diary, so don't expect the whole "Dear Diary" thing. It's more of... A memoir. It's a way to record my life and the events in it, not that my life is thrilling.
“I’m not a cop,” I eventually decide. “What are you taking?”
He realizes Cas has paused with his facts, and it’s Dean’s turn to respond.
Baby splutters.
The coat twisted out.
It’s strange to have what feels like their first fight as a couple when they’re not even a couple. He’s made sure of that, Dean thinks bitterly. Good job.
"Like what?"
We sit there in silence for half an hour, maybe more.
Baby’s never too worried about when Cas disappears— he always comes back, with Trench. If one of them’s okay, the other has to be as well. That’s just a law of the universe, in Baby’s mind. Every time she’s thought Trench will never return, they end up proving her wrong. By now she’s gotten over the anxiety every time Trench leaves, for she trusts Cas to bring them back; she can rest easy.
“See, the problem is solved,” says my mother, planting a kiss on my father’s cheek. “She’ll just get an abortion.”
Suddenly a thought occurs to me:  my life was never going to work out how I planned it. The world is not neat enough for me to be blessed with a PhD, a wife, and three kids, all wrapped up cleanly, with a bow on top. Apparently, as it turns out, my life has been slapped together with duct tape and leftover Christmas wrapping paper.
“Oh,” Dean stalls. He guesses he shouldn’t’ve assumed Cas would want him to come, anyway. This is a personal thing, and they’re not more than study friends. Good friends. Friends that occasionally make out. “I guess you’re all set to go, then.”
I just grin.
"I do envy you for being able to following your calling."
It was just like Mary's death: a blur of people and questions and not knowing any answers.
"Well, thanks for the beer," he says as he wrangles himself out of the sinking chair. Meg's mouth quirks slightly, and Dean counts that as her answer. He takes his beer and Cas' unopened can and heads off in the same direction.
"And Gabe?"
Meg still looks on the warpath, but she also hasn’t left yet, so Dean struggles to clarify. Charlie does the same, overlapping him as they both try to pacify Meg.
When the door to Dean's room shuts behind me, I glance around the seemingly empty bedroom.
Gabe sits down in shame.
"It's worse than you can imagine. If he keeps pretending he doesn't understand his homework to get her to help, she's going to think he's actually dumb."
“Now, normally, he moves on at lightning speed, but…” She waves her hand. “I don't know how you broke things off but it's really messing with him so it must've been immature. So what I need to know is, are you ready to stow the bullshit and actually talk to Cas like an adult, or is this just a fun game?”
-Gabe has an earring throughout all of this. Googling ‘young Richard Spleight Jr’ will give you an idea of what I was going for. DOES HE NOT ALSO LOOK WEIRDLY LIKE BO BURNHAM IN SOME OF THEM THOUGH.
Except for Dean, that is, who has gingerly taken a sip of his beer. I join him in taking a drink.
"So, what are you kids up to tonight?" he asks, shoving his free hand into a front pocket of his jeans.
My face crumples in humiliation at the surprise in his, closing my eyes to avoid looking into his pupils.
Jo’s head snaps back up to look at the brunette, brows furrowed in anger. “Why do you have to be such an asshole to everyone all the time? No one finds it cute, or funny, you’re just being a piece of shit!”
“Didn’t he move away, like, a month later?”
“Well, what I wanted to say hinged on the fact that you were actually into Cas, but since you’ve clearly moved on…”
Cas looks away again, up to the sky.
She puts on a cheeky tone to lighten the mood.
Trench nodded, as much as a fabric could nod.
Benny stares back, eyebrows questioning.
We watched as Adam scampered up the pile, his shaking visible even from where we were, jumping a little every time a rusty pipe moved out of place slightly. The pile was unstable, and, whether or not our child brains wanted to admit it, damn dangerous.
He's silent again for a few more minutes, before standing up and straightening out his clothes.
“Sorry to call, but I figured this was important.” Dean can hear the excitement in her voice and tries to compose himself. “Dang, why are you so out of breath?”
“Thank you for the last-minute invite,” Cas responds, and oh wow, Dean had forgotten about his voice.
The gun I found in his bedside drawer two weeks ago probably doesn't do anything in his favor, either.
Hannah managed to crawl onto the pier, extending a hand to tug me up with her.
I try to recall the face to match Tommy’s name in my mind.
Eventually, as I continue my walk, I hear a voice. A voice that I recognize.
"You're not alone. I'm sure my old man would be very concerned with my choice of degree too."
The personal insults started, in stage whispers and direct confrontation, and Cas had had enough. He got his stuff and was headed out when something stuck in his ear.
“It’s not like that,” Dean says with a glare.
“And your mom never knew until now?”
"Look, it's Superman! Cas, care to tell us if you knew, too?" My father spots me and stomps up to me immediately, raising his eyebrows at me as if he's scrutinizing me.
, the coat said.
But. But when Cas sits down in the back, something's wrong. She holds out hope when Dean goes around her, but he only puts weapons back in her trunk before he shuts it.
"Biology, vaguely," Cas waves his hand.
“The name came from her; we would talk about my stupid ideas and brainstorm together… who would've thought that she'd name you the same name as my character.” The man chuckles. “I'm published now, so I have a few crazy fans who track me down.” He looks at them. “Sorry about all that.”
Well, the looks Dean and Cas keep sharing certainly sweetens the pot. It’s funny that after everything they’ve been through, everything Baby and Trench have tried, they only succeeded in their matchmaking once Dean and Cas’ love became secondary to their own.
“And how will you work? You’ve always wanted to be a working woman, Hannah, but you can’t do that on your own and with a baby.”
But Kevin is always studying and Benny is with Andrea, so currently Charlie is the one cuddled up on the couch, watching
Dean reaches over and yanks it out of his hand, crumpling it up and then throwing it at Cas. Cas smooths the paper out, puts it in back of the pile, keeping eye contact, and picks up the next card to read. Cas is still grinning, that infuriating idiot, and Dean is no better; he can feel the open-mouthed smile on his face.
Now that was a low blow. Baby tenses, creaking. This is not what she wanted, goddammit, she just wanted to lay it to rest, not blow it up. Trench seems to sense they’ve gone a bridge too far, and tries to backpedal.
“Oh. So you’re gay?”
Eventually, I manage to find something we all like, shoving the cassette into the player and slumping back into my seat. As soon as the first tinny notes ring out in the car, Meg’s hand goes to the player, holding down the fast forward. Jumbled sounds rush past until she hits the second song on the track.
"What the Hell, man? I was in there, and you just had to go and mess it up for me," he whines. I open the bathroom door, to see that it's almost empty, aside from a firefighter at a urinal and one of the stalls being occupied. I pull him into an empty one, as close the door behind us. The stall is surrounded by walls, instead of panels that have gaps near the ceiling and show your feet, and the doors are actual wooden doors; probably the reason for the soundproof reputation.
“Meg hates me,” I declare, before he can even say hello. This is also the first time I’ve seen either of them since November. The doctors didn’t want me to come into contact with anyone involved in the incident, or maybe my mother bribed them. She probably thinks they’re bad influences, the druggie and the queer kid. Now it appears that I am both.
, Trench whispered over the distance, and Baby laughed.
He intends to lie there and let Benny get it, since he’s not expecting anyone, but then he remembers Benny’s with Andrea for Thanksgiving. Sighing, he leaves the bed and walks to the door. He clicks on the intercom.
Lisa. Baby reflected on the past few calls, and the ones that had gone to voicemail. The way they were both trying, hard, to keep a handle on their relationship in the face of the supernatural.
Charlie almost chokes on her popcorn, barking out, “You told me you didn’t watch that movie!”
“Didn't you ever do anything stupid because coming out was too hard? Work with me here,” Dean says into the silence.
Meg was right. You think you know people.
Dean turns, spell burst, trying to reassemble his frazzled brain. He assesses the newcomer, who heads straight for Cas.
"Research and academia are obviously useless as a career path. How alternative," Cas continues snidely.
I know exactly what she means.
"You're hilarious," she deadpans, "How was your night?"
“Alright.” She looks at his expression and shakes her head. “Do I need to spell it out? Get off your ass and apologize. Go resolve things so I can have some peace. Label it, break up decisively— I don’t care. Just talk.”
“Y’know… I just wanted to… talk,” he stutters, and his eyes continue boring into me.
It’s a little anticlimactic. The beach is visible even before they get to it, and is obviously their destination. Still, Cas gets out without hesitation, and Dean even sees a small smile before he turns and starts walking away from Dean.
“I assume she’s always like that, and it’s not really the fault of the sugar?” Castiel asks once they’re at the vending machine. Charlie’s already departed, snack in hand.
"Okay, me next. Never have I ever... smoked weed," Dean says, and he, Meg, and Gabe all sip their drinks. Jo and I glance at each other, knowing that neither of us smoking extended to marijuana, as well. Even though I know it's because of my own choices that I haven't, I can't help but feel excluded as the three high five, chattering over each other about the winter ball last year.
"Cas, help me!" She screamed, sobbing, throwing herself back under the water.
"Very."
"I knew I'd find you out here, you antisocial fuck," is the first thing out of her mouth.
Gasping.
, the coat said quietly.
“Oh,” Meg says. She sits down on the stairs, all of a sudden looking so much smaller than usual.
No, no, no, no, no, no—
“Hello?” Cas offers up.
“Plus, that way I have time to borrow Benny’s car.”
Black.
“I think I love you, too,” I reply, and Napoleon rips a blade of dead grass from the hard ground.
“May I?”
I met Meg Masters when I was fourteen years old. I remember every minute of that first exchange.  It started with a bus, or rather, a lack thereof.
"Do you think that it's working?" I asked, squeezing my nose harder.
“Dean,” Cas replies, faux-surprised, “are you asking me on a date?”
Castiel stands up as well, rolling his neck. Across the table, Charlie shoots Dean a significant look and a smile.
Eventually, I turn to her again. "Are you okay, Hannah?"
“I just told my mom and brother. Before I came up. I'm trying, I am.”
Nothing.
"Will do." I assume John isn't home, since he's rarely ever home in the evenings. The empty tv dinners on the dining table further prove my point. He's probably out drinking, and won't be home until the early hours of the morning.
“Oh, I knew you could take care of it,” Dean grins, lopsided. “We just wanted an excuse for you to meet our son.”
, she replied.
"Cas! Get your ass up here!" a voice calls from upstairs, presumably my all-too-excited-about-Halloween best friend.
"You starin' at my ass, Novak?" She stood up and turned to face me, a smirk playing on her lips.
"Yes?"
"You're insane! I'm your wife, why don't you trust me!" She screamed, and I heard her stomping around the room, her heels scraping the carpet.
"Aw, someone has a crush!" I poke at her, teasing.
“Thanks, mom.” They take a few breaths together through the phone. “Hey, I'll call back later, okay? I have something to do. Could you pass me to Sammy first, though?”
He knocks softly, then harder when there’s no answer. A shuffling behind the door and Dean can feel Cas assaying him through the peephole. When he finally opens the door, it’s not all the way, just enough to peek around it. His hair is on end and he’s wrapped in a blanket, and he looks ragged. Still attractive as ever, though, Dean thinks. He’s just happy to see him again.
Blood in his wet hair.
“We’ve decided it’s food time. Hopefully I’ll hear from Madison by the time we’re done.”
It's night and, after Dean raced from her to deal with the commotion inside, it's quiet. They've both made their way back to her, and are sitting, silently, in the front.
"Fantastic." Meg spits sarcastically.
Trench sounds weary, on the edge of pleading.
I know I shouldn’t do that to Meg, and every bone in my body is screaming, begging me not to make her part of Dean’s game. I continue with this begging and screaming as I walk over to her, pull her off of the couch, and kiss her. She gives a small gasp of shock, breathing in quickly before leaning into the kiss, into me. Her lips taste like cherry; like mint and everything else I ever imagined they would taste like. I carefully open my eyes to look past Meg and her beautiful face, to the corner of my vision. Dean’s hands have dropped by his sides, and he ignores the schoolgirl on his lap, favoring staring at me kissing Meg, a sort of shock in his eyes. I grin to myself, knowing that I’ve beat him.
Gasping.
Waves collapse next to us and dust forms in the air as we throw ourselves onto the sand. Meg's fallen to her knees in front of me, a truly picturesque moment:  her dark hair and arched eyebrows, breathing heavily, with the sea as her background. One of the straps of her tight, black dress hangs around her shoulder, and she's grinning at me and my half-untucked shirt and wild hair.
“Yeah, you really fucked me up, man. And when you kissed me on Halloween? That was a really shitty thing to do.” Meg sniffs, pulling her arms tighter around herself in the cold.
When we part again, Dean just stares at me.
The road in front of me is dark, the lights of Boardwalk behind me, and the lights of the suburbs far ahead. I get a glance at my watch. 00:24.
So he pulls himself together. He's got to at least try. At least for the chance to apologize, regardless of if Cas forgives him or not, if Cas wants him or not. He deserves an apology, at least.
A woman's death became gossip, because enough people were bored and talked a lot.
They stroll, examining the tide pools they find, Cas bending down often to collect a shell or rock.
“Yeah, I saw their asses,” I mumble to myself, feeling bitter and abandoned as I tug my pants back up. “The zombie was flat.”
The happy glow of talking to his family floats him to the door. Still, it doesn’t protect him from the anxiety that starts worming in his chest once he gets there. A couple is coming out of the building as he crests the steps, so he hurries in before the door closes, thankful he doesn’t have to ring up and convince Cas to let him in.
Alex is already here after her shift, and she waves Claire over. They’re at a table in the corner, a prized spot in any hunting establishment. Yes, Claire’s staying closer to home now, but that doesn’t mean she has to give up all the creature comforts of life on the road, namely greasy food, a few beers outside the watchful eyes of her moms, and some bad conversation. As she crosses the room she takes in the amazing, disgusting smells of potatoes deep-frying and burgers sizzling. Yummy. Smells like kentucky fried rawhead.
Get numb.
"Going to have to agree with my partner over there." I gesture to Meg, who places her hand over her heart in faux gratitude.
“She called me last night. Told me that she was angry at you. I don’t think she hates you. I don’t think she can hate you.” He shakes his head.
—doesn’t get a chance to say anything, as she’s teleported in an instant.
“Happy Thanksgiving, Dean.”
“You okay?”
“Ask Charlie, hacker extraordinaire.”
“I’m the queen of dares!” She grinned.
Baby spits.
But Baby won’t know what the truth is, because at that moment Dean, Cas, and Trench disappear.
“Okay, piss break, smoke break, water break,” Dean shoots back, standing up. “Take your pick.
“Shut up.” I grab the speaker—Dean—and slam him against the wall with me, covering his mouth with my hand.
Cas slumps back down and nods, uncertainly. “I guess so.”
“Who even are you, Cas? It’s like all of a sudden you’ve decided to be all sexy and stuff.” He looks at me quizzically.
She laughs.
, Baby says, hard.
God, what has he just done?
“I thought I was meeting you guys at your house,” I tell Dean as he peels away from the sidewalk and starts driving towards the Boardwalk.
She hadn’t been sure what to expect from her first angel. Well, honestly, she had never really expected there to be one in her seats. Why would they ever use car travel? But Anna, though subdued, had fit into her idea of how an angel might act. Quiet, sitting up tall, observing everything.
He replies by pulling me close to him and kissing me slowly, his clothes soft against my bare skin.
“That is where a lot of my preliminary information came from, yes. Although I spent a lot time on Washington state’s Parks website reading up on Fort Worden, and on the Center’s website, too.”
My yard's empty, since it's a cold Fall and we're too old for any purpose that it served before. I remember, when I was younger, Dean and I would spray each other with water pistols, while Sam begged to join in, and Hannah, who was having a "rebellious" phase, sat with a magazine and refused, then shouted at us whenever she got sprayed.
Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck—
Dean’s eyes grow wide. “You know?” He turns to me, alarmed. “She knows?”
Baby says
"Certainly." Cas' voice is quieter and calmer this time, melding with the surroundings.
Trench sat still but for a slight twiddle of their collar.
“I don’t know. I think I just always wanted to.” I shrug.
Cas nods again, with conviction. “That sounds agreeable. Thanks, Dean.”
Dean just looks at her, not wanting to believe what he thinks she's saying.
Bruce sprays beer over half the table. Claire groans as she wipes her face, and Bruce goes, belligerently, “Which one of them had the kid?? Riddle me that!”
Baby snorted, exhaust bubbling.
So maybe I like boys.
Cas looks stormy. “What do you want?”
“Hi, Hannah! Hi, Cas!” a high-pitched voice called from the beginning of the pier, diverting our attention away from the splash fight.
"Sorry, Jo, just so hard to stop myself when I'm with such a hot girl." He grabs the nurse's ass and Jo reddens. "We're just gonna go... to the bathroom." He smirks and they hurry off together, giggling.
Have you ever tried taking a walk? Sometimes when it’s all too much, all you’ve got to do is take a walk.
“Well I’m shit at internet searches too, but I don’t think Google is really going to help us here.”
“Hey, Novak.”
He describes Naomi as a “squawking mess” as he gets back into the story, and Dean can’t stop from chuckling a little at that image.
Dean is happy, grudgingly pushing aside his hurts and confusion, he's happy; she can tell by the easy way he treats the clutch, the relaxed posture in her seat. But Baby is no such thing. She doesn’t know when she ever will be again.
Rick looks a little put off his rhythm, and Andy is looking at her a little too doe-eyed. Kendall, on the other hand, is grinning like a shark. Claire scoffs and rolls her eyes to Alex.
As he stands to answer it he looks over at Charlie, whose expression is half confusion and half trepidation. He knows they’re both wondering the same thing— is it Cas? Dean’s stomach rolls as he approaches the door, Charlie a few steps behind him. He braces himself, then opens it.
Cas says quietly, “I thought, after I saw her there, it would help me get over you too.”
They tried to put me in therapy; who wouldn't?
Ove laughs again, his voice light.
The car rumbled.
Dean gives a smile and shrugs. "I don't know. I was bored. You live close."
“You think you know a girl.”
11:38.
The car descends into the darkness of the highway to the Boardwalk as Dean turns a corner, away from the suburbs.
That had, obviously, not gone over as well. What was he supposed to do with that degree? Research, he replied. Most likely grad school or further. Teaching, maybe.
Suddenly I'm jerking and twitching, feeling the pressure build up inside of me like a volcano.
“Lay off, I wouldn’t have messed up if you hadn’t sabotaged me!” I spluttered.
And then it's over, as quick as it started, and all I want is for him to do it again.
“I’ll do it,” said a little voice; Adam. “I’m not a chicken.”
It’s not as easy as all that, though. Dean’s here, at Cas’ building, but he can’t bring himself to ring the bell. He sits on the steps up to the front door, concrete cold through his pants. He shivers.
So maybe I’m behind in school. So maybe my sister is pregnant and hasn’t made up her mind about it. So maybe my parents are talking to their divorce lawyers. So maybe it’s not the drugs’ fault that I freaked out, and it was inevitable.
"Mom?" Dean called into the seemingly empty house.
“Nuh-uh! I totally can, watch!” Hannah stepped towards the edge of the small wooden pier. She carefully leant forward, calculating her moves in her head, before turning around, grinning at me, and jumping off of it. She spun in the air, doing a—slightly clumsy—backflip before landing in the water with a splash and spraying me with foam.
“Yeah,” Dean says, looking into Cas’ eyes as they catch only the faintest glimmer of reflected light. “Mostly I did.”
Baby stirs.
“Be quiet, Cas.” She continues her assault on Hannah. “And what about school? Do you want to be a high school dropout?”
Dean puts a cigarette between his lips and moves for the lighter once it's produced, but Cas ignores his efforts. Instead he reaches up and flicks the lighter near Dean's jaw, leaning in to light it for him. Dean's eyes track the flame, and he inhales— but Cas' face is so close and Dean makes the mistake of looking up. They lock eyes and Dean almost chokes on the smoke in his chest. Thankfully, Cas leans back just as he leaned in—expression unaffected—and Dean can function properly again.
I consider my words very carefully, debating their responses in my head. In all honesty, it's something I've never spoken to any of them about it ever, even Dean.
"No."
"My eyes glimmer with mischief?" He asks, quoting the writing.
Of course, they told my parents everything. About Mary and Adam, the acid, the bathroom stall in The Blue Velvet.
Meg still doesn’t look me in the eye, hair hanging over her face, hiding her from me.
Michael, Hannah's boyfriend, is driving, one hand on the wheel, the other dangling a cigarette out of the window. Five others, who I don't recognise, are squashed into the back, one leaning against the backs of the seats, the others sitting and shouting, laughing loudly. Music booms through the car's radio; it's some song by an up-and-coming girl group, and Hannah rushes past me as they honk at the house. She's wearing a tight purple dress that our dad probably wouldn't approve of, and her hair is teased up enough to add another foot to her height. She teeters towards the car, barely keeping her balance in impossibly high heels.
Dean's struck dumb in response. It's Sunglasses Dude—he recognizes his voice now—but he's not wearing sunglasses anymore. Nope, instead he's endangering the public: allowing the light to fall directly on his face, letting it throw sparkles into his uncovered eyes, recklessly blinding Dean with bright, bright blue—
“Hey, Samsquatch.”

“Maybe I can help him later.”
“Well, you got to be divorced. You didn’t need to see him anymore. It was easy for you to be separate, but… he’s still Sam and my’s dad. We can’t divorce out of that one.” He tries for a laugh, but it doesn’t quite make it.
He sighs. “My friends have all known since I knew. My cousin Hannah was fine with it when I told her. But I did pretend to date one of my friends for over two years, for my mother's sake.”
I told them that Dean had entered the kitchen first, I hadn't really seen her, I was fine. They bought it. I just pawned my trauma off onto Dean, who was more than willing to take it.
I shake my head in faux disappointment. "An elephant never forgets, Harvelle."
It was my fault.
“Did I know what?” I ask carefully. I need to tread cautiously around this situation. Mess up one word and this whole thing could blow up.
Baby swerved a little, and Dean forcefully held her steering wheel straight.
Hannah gives a small laugh. “Yeah, that would go down well. ‘Hey, Mike, remember when we had unprotected sex and figured nothing bad would happen because your friends told you that everyone does it? Turns out, your friends are liars and now you’re going to be a daddy! Do you want a summer or fall wedding?’”
Kevin explains their format as Castiel listens seriously. Dean is enjoying just watching his profile, but then Charlie catches his gaze and mouths, “This is going to be so much fun.”
With effort, (as she’d rather focus her attention elsewhere right now), Baby indents her front seat. Dean and Castiel are caught off balance and slide down towards the middle— their hands touch, their eyes meet, and everything is back to working as it should.
The coat seems pleased with himself, readjusting against her leather seats.
. A rare, full grin on Trench’s lapels.
I shoot.
Well, sort of. He went to the occasional party and kickback at home, hanging out in his friends’ basements in high school or going to a birthday party that got rowdy. But he tried to keep up on his studies and set a good example for Sam, so those experiences were over several scattered weekends. In college back home, it was all he could do to study his ass off in addition to working. Sure, he’s no recluse, but since moving to a campus he feels like he can officially be a college student. It makes him grin.
★♡♛✰Bradburn✰♛♡★: Coolio!!
“Never,” Castiel replies lazily, sincerely. “You're genuine, just quiet. Quiet can be good. I just wondered.”
“No,” Mary replies immediately. “You’re our son, Dean. Neither of us could ever hate you.”
They roll up at an empty warehouse.
The silence returns and I keep my thoughts to myself.
"What, I'm just asking!" he protests.
T’s lapels huffed a sigh.
I chuckle under my breath, almost as shocked as Dean. Gabe—whose motivations in life are so base he might as well just be a dick—and Jo, who’s repulsed by his every action.
“I dare Hannah to… Grab a handful of sand from the bottom!”
"It was like a support beam or something.”
“Oh, fuck off.”
Baby prompts, when the silence stretches too long.
During the course of Cas’ story it had become clear that he needs a friend, not some creep who crushes on him from up close, so Dean’s resolved to be just a friend. And what a friend needs right now is a distraction. But then he worries that is verging into date territory, and pulls back.
Says the announcer in my head.
“Because you fuck with people, Dean! You fuck with everyone and you don’t care who you hurt!” He seems taken aback by my anger, concern building in what little of his facial features I can see.
"Honey, she's going to put his dick in her mouth," Meg replies. "Apparently the stalls are like, soundproof or something, so you never know what anyone's doing in there."
, Dean'll chalk it up to the cold. He forgot his jacket at home, after all. He needs to sit close.
“So,” Chuck sighs deeply, “what’s all this about Castiel? I know he had a huge fan response but—”
“I asked first.”
“I guess now I go take my shot at getting him back.”
It’s not that she’s not exhilarated to be racing towards the action, or that she begrudges being helpful in times of crisis, but… it had been a perfect time to speak up, and she hadn’t said anything.
“I swear to God, you little bastard…” he says under his breath, barely audible to me, let alone Hannah and my mother.
"Oh," Cas looks at him too intensely. "That must be hard, I'm sorry for bringing it up."
I glance at the packaging, squinting in the darkness, "Bubblegum or cherry?"
The car falls silent again, as our chuckles die out. It's not an awkward silence, though, this time. It's a nice silence, because nothing needs to be said.
She doesn’t even say goodbye.
And now, for our fourth kiss, with his hands on my waist and my door locked, I can finally just let it happen.
They’re practically giggling. It’s undignified, but what the hell, Trench makes her laugh. The whole situation is silly.
Pushing open the door, he's greeted with a refreshing burst of cold air and a view of the alley. Not very picturesque, but the twinkle of the cars and shopping mall below gives the night an airy quality, much better than the stuffy, over-vaped interior he's stepping out of.
Smooth, Dean, real smooth. Crunchy-peanut-butter smooth.
“And how exactly did I do that?”
Like vomit.
“I’ll figure something out-“
I clutch the steering wheel as I speed off, the pounding of the footsteps still audible behind me. I make a sharp turn, hearing people yell curses at me as they jump out of the way, but I don’t care. I’ve hit the highway.
“Hey, Dean!” a voice calls out and Dean rips himself from me, breaking away and stumbling back onto the sand, eyes darting around, looking for the owner of the voice like a rabbit caught in headlights.
“Woah, tiger. That doesn’t mean you have to go right now.” Dean chuckles. “I have class this afternoon. Shouldn’t we wait a few days and make this a weekend thing?”
You see, the Boardwalk is where every teenager within a five mile radius of my house goes to. It's a flashing, crazy, uncontrollable, hub of activity. And everyone goes, every single Friday night.
He sees Cas’ shoulders hunch up, but he doesn't reply. Finally, he looks up at Dean, and Dean can see the emotion threatening to spill over. As if approaching a skittish animal, he walks towards the counter and gingerly leans next to Cas.
“No, you’re right. As you said, you have class later, and it will take several hours of driving both ways. We could make it a weekend ‘thing’, if you can get off work?”
Dean turns to me as the car settles in a parking lot.
The boys leave in a rush, a fumble of clothing, and finally, finally, Baby and Trench are alone.
s. Next he brings up Facebook and does another futile search. Dean can feel his restless energy next to him, and isn’t surprised when Cas removes the laptop from his lap and abandons it beside him in frustration.
All of a sudden, he's sitting on the toilet seat, with me standing before him, pressed against both the door and his shoulders since the stall is so cramped. He pulls down my superman tights, knowing that I've already got an aching boner, and I can't help but laugh in my head about the fact that Batman is about to give Superman head.
She stopped suddenly. Shuddering, she slowly looked up at me, removing her hands from her face.
"I... I don't know." Dean and I say in sync, looking up at each other.
All of a sudden, my father, whose existence I’d almost forgotten about, breaks the silence.
In a daze, he follows his impulse and scrolls down to Lydia’s number. Perfect.
She greets the table and slides into the booth, saying hi to Alex and the other hunters who she’s at least friendly with. Tonight there’s Kendall, a 20-30-something firecracker who Claire thinks is the coolest bitch ever to exist and who probably lights fires in her free time; Rick and Andy, a father-son duo who look like they’d be just as comfortable at a golf course as at this dump; and Bruce, who’s 50 going on 80 but tells the best hunting stories, even better than the Winchesters’. In fact, the Winchesters are often the topic of his stories, and Claire loves to listen to them and catalogue all the inaccuracies in her head, or argue them outloud when she’s had a drink. Half fact half fiction, like all hunters.
“It’s not like she has to know any details. I can just ask her to find this guy, and not tell her anything else.”
He pulls his phone from his pocket as he walks across campus, making sure that it's her lunch time in Kansas and then scrolling to his mother's contact to hit the phone icon.
Dean hears a muffled, “It’s Sam,” and smiles.
Cas smiles back, a rare full smile. He grips Dean’s chin and guides Dean to look him in the eyes.
"What's working?"
"What?" I'm taken aback in surprise.
Napoleon is only one of the many changes that have occurred since what happened in November. Everything kind of went to Hell for a while there.
Baby waits, as she does. The boys come back out, plus Kevin, and Baby is happy to see the happy ending to this. There’s bad mojo in this place, and they may have won the battle, but she still wants to leave as soon as Dean gets in the car.
“Hm?”
"Cas, I think-" Hannah's voice broke again. "I think he's- I think-" she stuttered.
"I'm a hobbit." He pronounces the words slowly, like Gabe's braindead, which, let's face it, he might be.
First off, I would like to thank the Academy for this award.
"What's going on with us, Dean?" I say, slumping down to sit on the closed lid of the toilet, while Dean leans against the door.
Jump.
They're not really leaning against each other, but Dean’s close enough to feel Cas’ body heat. It makes him feel safe.
Last year, she decided that she was bored of her life. She was bored of her goodie two shoes friends, Lisa and Jess, and so she ditched them. She chose new ones, with cool haircuts and loud voices, and now they're rolling up on our driveway, in a red convertible.
There’s the sound of shuffling, and Jo lets out a sob.
Meg stands up and leaves, just like that.
And then her slyness returns. I can only be a spectator as I know that I’ll soon be watching her manipulate Hannah, because she’s a housewife, and that’s what she does best.
“But,” she continues, “I know that you don’t like me. You like Dean.”
They sink back into silence as Dean parks and opens her trunk.
After three invitations, Cas seemed to give up. That’s why when he asks the fourth time, three weeks after the first party, Dean says yes on impulse. He feels the worry in his stomach start, until he sees how happy Cas’ eyes are, and decides it’s worth it. He doesn’t know why he’s been so distant, anyway. Cas has become his friend, and it’s not like he’s not going to judge Dean for getting drunk at a party he’s invited him to. That’s college, and Cas’ scene.
Surprisingly, Cas follows him with an “I’ll come.”
“You okay?” the bartender asks, his voice echoing, playing in different frequencies in my head.
“I don’t know, Ash, a game or something.”
Adam was skinny, with mousy brown hair, and a few inches shorter than me. That was saying something, considering I was pretty short as a kid. He was wearing dark green swimming trunks.
Golden Gardens is really neither of those two descriptors. Dean is disappointed to learn, as they finally reach the bottom of the hill in the minivan, that "Golden Gardens" should really be called "Dark and Dreary Beach Park." He can't see much, but the parking lot borders a field and some trees. And
She had started quiet and slow, but as she recounted her gears grew stronger.
One of the guys notices my look. They’re about my age, probably a little younger, both skinny and covered in acne.
Are contact highs real? Cause this room is not well-ventilated, and Dean is feeling something or other— less heady than the cigarette, something in the area of his chest. Cas’ eyes are back on him, and the light from the TV makes them shine…
She breathes in deeply, opens her mouth, closes it again, breathes out. It's like she's calculating in her head what she should reply.
Lydia sets up camp next to Dean, leaning into him slightly. He turns instead to the left, towards Cas.
They can be friends, right? This is how people make friends.
Cas catches it when Ash tosses the deck in the direction of the group.
(“Rowena?” Andy asks his dad. “No freaken clue.” Rick responds.)
Alright, so they weren’t in the lead. But Dean barely notices or cares, because Cas has a hand on his shoulder and is moving him away from the table. Well, maybe he’s supporting him more than leading him, but either way…
After that, the day passed in a blur. I went from moving in slow motion to speeding through everything that comes after a suicide. Dean called the police, and they called my parents. I went home, and my mom made burgers, which I didn't eat. And then I went to bed. I heard Dean's father, John, telling my dad that Dean refused to go into the kitchen for two months.
Dean laughs. “Well, save a piece for me!”
Get numb?
"I can do it!" Adam clenched his fists, seeming more terrified than determined, his whole body quivering as he leant over a little to glance into the black water.
That doesn't happen, though.
They slide in the backseat with Cas.
Before Cas can answer or Dean can reclaim some dignity, the door opens behind them. A bubble of noise slips out—laughing, high-pitched rambling, frenetic baseline—and then muffles again as the door closes.
"That's scary, man."
They stand hesitantly for a second too long before Chuck jumps into action. “Oh, here, I’ll introduce you to some people.”
Dean has an irrational urge to say "we could share" since he doesn't really want a whole smoke anyway, but instead he dutifully taps one out and hands it to Cas. Cas takes it gingerly, leans forward and cups his hand to light it, his face thrown into sharp light by the flame.
"No." Replying so bluntly is probably rude, but Jo won't take it to heart. She knows me well enough to understand that I'm not trying to be rude, I'm just being straight.
Castiel stops fiddling with the pull tab. "She's not my
Baby rocks as Dean shuts her trunk violently. She's still a bit sore from being flipped a few weeks ago, but she takes it. He walks along her side and slides into the front seat, taking a second of silence as everyone else piles in. Then he rolls her engine over and drives her the hell away from the reservoir.
I remove the gun from my head and look at it, then him, then it, before holding it up. His eyes widen in fear as I hold him at gunpoint, and he stumbles back, away from me. Meg puts her hands up.
Benny turns around, eyebrow raised and holding a pile of clothes. “Here, take this, Mr. I-don’t-own-a-sweater.”
Before Dean can ask what he's doing out here with a lighter but nothing to smoke, the guy brings to chest level a small pipe that catches the light. He fiddles once more with the contents, brings the glass to face-level. and lights the bowl.
Something changes.
"We- we- I don't know what we do," Hannah mumbled.
Dean gives a final laugh before pulling on a dark green shirt. It looks good on him.
“Hey! Cas!”
No matter what happens between Dean and Cas; no matter how often, or not, Trench is in the backseat or how many other Objects they talk to; no matter where this path leads; Baby is happy because she knows that this is real. She knows that Trench will always find their way back to her.
“You sucked me off and then went after some random girls. You led me on and then just abandoned me.”
"I didn't go into the kitchen for three months. You wrote two."
“You didn't get out. So whose fault was it?” Dean is manhandling her trunk much more than necessary.
“Oh, I fuck with people? Care to talk me through what just happened with Meg back there? ‘Cause it seems like you used her to get back at me."
Baby felt the jugs of blood wobble in the trunk, their liquid sloshing with her motion, and felt sick.
The guy obviously hears Dean laughing, because he props his head up on his hand and slowly turns to face the noise, his mouth a scowl. It would look more intimidating if the dude's eyes were also angry, but Dean can only imagine them scrunched up against the light behind his glasses, and he can't help but laugh again. Sighing, Sunglasses goes back to his face-down-on-the-probably-very-dirty-table pose. Dean would wonder why he's sitting in the front and not the way way back, but it looks like it took all of his energy just to stumble into the first chair he could find.
“Sounds like you memorized the Wikipedia article for this place.”
“It's not true.”
“No, I hope not. I just figured I should tell you”—ripping the bandaid off is easier the second time—“I like dudes.”
“I’m waiting outside my friend’s house. Could we talk?” Wow, Dean. Finesse and segue are definitely your strong suits.
That, in itself, is an answer.
Finally, finally, Castiel flew into her backseat.
The other guy walks over and shakes it heartily, replying with only slight slurring, "I'm Gabriel! Gabe. Welcome to our humble bonfire."
As if to remind Dean, Cas still invites him to parties. So far Dean has declined them all. Something had come up every time, either he had a paper due to next day or he was supposed to call his mom or he was really tired— all excuses. He knows that he either shuts down or gets emotional while drunk, and neither of those are particularly fun to imagine in Castiel’s presence. He’s still vaguely embarrassed when he thinks about their interaction at the bonfire. Instead, he sees Cas at study group and sometimes for lunch, and keeps him at a friendly distance.
Dean smiles. “Sure, let me get on video chat.”
When I reach the Impala, I dig through the jacket’s pockets, searching for the keys, tossing handfuls of sand out of every pocket I stick my fingers into. Eventually I find them, seizing the metal and unlocking the car, shoving them into the ignition. I dump the jacket out of the window; it’s nothing more than a puddle now.
Carefully making my way to the kitchen, where the fight seems to be going down, I notice that Hannah and my mother and seated at the breakfast table, whilst my father storms around the room, opening and closing cabinets, ranting.
." She sits next to him on the step, behind Cas. Cas turns forward and leans back against her legs, and Meg rests her hands on his shoulders. Her eyes roam over Dean.
Dean sits back down, feeling like he’s in whack-a-mole. “I already ate, anyway.”
Baby is barely listening, though. She’s smiling softly in Trench’s direction instead.
"You coming or not?"
I wait.
“Bye, Mom.”
The look on Castiel’s face puts the sun to shame. He comes back in for another kiss, deep and claiming.
(“Crowley?” Andy asks his dad, quietly. “King of Hell, at some point,” he replies.)
"What the Hell are you doing? Cas! Cas!" Hannah desperately pleaded with me, spitting out the mouthfuls of water every time she came up, gasping for air.
Nothing?
"Cas," she starts, "You can't even drive."
He can hear the smile in her voice when she speaks. "The usual: glorious, wheat-y..." They laugh, and Dean chances a few solid strides across the wet plaza. "The yard needs weeded after work and I'm really missin' your extra pair of hands right about now."
She was bent over, peering into one of the cabinets, digging around various probably outdated medicines. I turned away quickly, trying to avoid looking at her butt, which was more than visible in her Levis.
Jody chuckled with entirely too much mirth.
“But you’re gonna use the doors around here, got it?” Dean added. “Knock before opening if it’s closed. It’s polite.”
—for his companionship, his closeness, his touch…everything. But Dean couldn’t have it. Cas was, and still is, this unattainable being so far out of his league Dean would never be worthy of him. Cas had been what demon blood was to Sam, addictive and enticing. Dean had wanted more, more,
The waitress probably wasn’t even working tonight. Food service gave their employees days off, right? She wouldn’t even be there.
“That ain’t the question, Cas. You said
Dean was having a hard time trying not to glower at the waitress, who was raking her eyes all over Cas. She was his girl after all, she had a right to. And, judging by how frequent his trips out have been, it was safe to say Dean might have to start getting used to her.
Buzz. Buzz. Tap, tap.
“I was already forming the correct pronunciation before you even took a breath!”
Next to Jack and across from Cas, Dean felt his entire body go rigid. He clutched his fork in his hand, feeling the metal bite into his skin.
There was a sharp knock on his door, interrupting the headspace he had accidentally wandered into. Dean jumped, instinctively slapping the lid of his laptop closed like he’d been watching porn instead of a medical drama.
“Good to have you back, Cas.”
came to mind.
With Cas…Dean lost
“Now? It’s only a few hours from here. Her friend wants it out of their place asap, so…”
“She’s working under you?”
“Man, you don’t even know your girlfriend at all.”
“I capiche.” He replied a moment later.
hit him over the head with a solid
“No. I have other motivations than seating arrangements, Dean.” He only sounded mildly insulted.
“Should I answer them in the order you presented them—?”
“Not planning on it.”
“Just out for a drive.” Cas said cautiously, undoubtedly trying to figure out what the fuck Dean’s problem with him was.
“My legs are uncomfortable back here.” Sam insisted, leaning forward to tap on Jack’s shoulder. “It’s gonna mess up my knees and it’ll
“Sounds good. You should sear some of these peppers and onions for them too.” Sam nodded.
“—you got it on the ride here, it’s only fair that
Sam brightened immediately upon entering the kitchen, eagerly pulling his plate towards him (Dean had even made his freaky egg-white omelet and used the extra yolk in Cas’).
“You wanna tell me what it is?”
“Yes, Dean.” Cas glanced up at him with another one of those indulgent smiles. “I will be more careful in the future.”
, you ass!” Cas suddenly yelled, his blue eyes flashing furiously. His voice echoed into the woods by the road. “My happiness is the fact that I’ve been in love with you my entire existence and I
“The sun will be up soon.” Cas said suddenly, and he was dragging him off again, towards the east side of the roof where Dean could see the clouds were painted pink and orange and lavender, just minutes away from displaying the sun.
“What I want…is something I know I can’t have. So…I am content with the things I need.”
“I want a burger. Bite me.”
“Did you find him?”
“Water is fine for me.” Sam said.
“Well hey there, handsome. Haven’t seen you in a minute.” She drawled, dragging her eyes up and down Cas’ seated form, apparently not seeing how their hands were still clasped on the bench.
“Let’s keep looking, Jack. You might find something you like even more.”
But downtime with nothing better to do meant there were few distractions to keep him from inspecting that itchy
His heart sank even further and he basically curled over the table, his slumped shoulders and back almost hovering over his plate. He didn’t speak for the rest of the meal.
“Keep in touch.” Cas reminded him.
“Yes.” God, Dean would never get tired of that smile. “I like watching the sunrise up here. It’s beautiful.”
“Twenty five grand.”
“Where’s Cas?”
“Of course, Dean.” Cas said indulgently. He was pretty indulgent with Dean’s strange declarations these days, as long as they didn’t involve Cas doing the dishes or telling him to stop stealing his clothes. At this point, it would probably be weird if Cas wore his own clothes rather than Dean’s. He didn’t even blink an eye when he walked into his room to see Cas rummaging through his drawers like he belonged there. He was always indulgent in letting Cas go through his things.
“The hell we are! No one wants your frouffy ASPCA eggs!”
Jack was already carving a decent chunk out of his ice cream, apparently not minding the mix of tastes. Dean’s was pretty good, just vanilla with cinnamon added. It kinda made him want pie (more than usual, anyway). Maybe he would make one when they got home.
“Men, I know.”
“Ah.” Cas said, and then didn’t say anything else. He just ducked behind his menu. Dean caught Sam’s eye, who grinned and shook his head in amusement. Surely Cas didn’t have a thing for the waitress too? He could only hope his best friend had better taste than Miss. Pep In My Step.
Damn this ex angel and his stubbornness. Dean turned to glare at Sam.
familiar flat squares. His chest clenched and his hackles rose.
“They’re usually much more rectangular. I bought mini packs because—“ Cas’ tan cheeks flushed, and Dean felt a thrill go up his spine as he remembered that pink hue. Cas had been
“It’s not…it’s complicated, Jack.” He sighed, reaching over to catch dribble of Jack’s ice cream before it could hit his hand. “Sometimes people think it’s wrong for people to wear some things.”
“Oh.” Jack looked slightly saddened at the idea that Cas wouldn’t want to see him.
What should have been a 30 minute trip to the grocery store turned into almost an hour and a half. Everything Dean threw in the cart, Cas complained and offered a healthier option. Wheat bread instead of white. Organic over processed. Dean had yet to put anything in the cart that Cas didn’t have a healthier alternative for.
Jesus Christ with the goddamn air quotes.
“I was damn well close.” Dean grunted, picking with the hem of a fur coat and pinching the hairs between his fingers. “But it was my dad talkin’, not me. I…I don’t really care what the kid wears. Never really cared what anyone wore, to be honest.”
“Can we put chocolate chips in?” Jack asked hopefully, already on his second juice box.
. Capiche?” He glared at him. Cas just blinked.
“Y’know, the rules are you can’t call shotgun until you actually
Cas was there, his blue eyes burning with fury and precision, but the next moment his machete clattered to the ground. He crowded into Dean’s space, cupping his face in his hands and his eyes soft now.
“So why’re you really here?” He side-eyed Cas as he poured bright blue liquid into the coolant tank. “Wouldn’t happen to do with wanting to call shotgun?”
Desperation. Anguish. Fear.
“Damnit Cas, you know what I mean.” Dean shot at him. “What the hell do you mean, what you want is something you can’t have? And what about all those trips you’ve been taking if you haven’t been out banging Miss. Bouncy? Where the hell have you been goin’? Or—or that shit you were saying about watching me die and not being able to stop it? And
The voice suggested, and his mind helpfully reminded him of that flirty waitress at Hutch’s. Something cold dropped to the pit of his stomach. No. Cas wouldn’t…
“Yeah…” Dean mumbled. His brain couldn’t fathom some stranger living there without paying homage to the man who had owed it before. It didn’t seem right. “How…how much s’it goin’ for?”
No matter how much Sam pestered him, Cas refused to go into detail about what the deal had been and what he had done to summon it. Cas had just been dumped rather unceremoniously onto the dungeon floor after Jack, the new God (Chuck’s powers were expelled before the Empty took him, and they latched onto the only being powerful enough to contain them, which of course happened to be a four year old with an obsession with Legos) managed to convince the Empty to let him go.
“Ohh, I like this one!” From one of the racks, Jack took out a white dress with balloon sleeves and little cloth buttons that ran down the front. It was patterned with artistic gold-orange butterflies and flowers, and there was a leather belt that Dean assumed was buckled around the waist.
Because he was feeling a little nicer, he actually ended up using the peppers, onions and avocados to make omelets for Sam and Cas, and made blueberry pancakes with the little bowl of berries in the fridge.
It took him a solid minute to realize that Cas had no intention of moving his leg. It remained pressed against his own while he and Sam started talking, like the contact wasn’t currently melting Dean’s brain. He stared blankly at a spot above Sam’s shoulder, his mind zeroed in on the solid line of heat pressed against his thigh. At least his pinkie wasn’t pinned between them anymore.
“Does this mean I get exclusive shotgun privileges?”
—plaid trenchcoat. “It’s like your coat and Dean’s shirts!”
“Then no.” Dean said resolutely. “Avocados are good only as guacamole and eaten on chips.”
So he shifted his leg away, trying to be casual about it and disguising the move under the pretense of leaning over to put the menus back.
The lust was fading from his mind as he tried to make sense of what he was saying.
“I can hear everyone, Dean.” He reminded him quietly. “It’s easy to tune out when I want to, but…why did he call me a freak?” Jack turned his wide blue eyes on him, eyes so much like Cas that it made Dean’s heart ache.
Dean hadn’t even realized he started thinking about it until he was twenty minutes into Dr. Sexy MD and not listening to a word of it.
Before his brain could get too far along that train of thought, a realization struck him—maybe Cas didn’t notice his thigh was up against Dean’s. It was an intimate touch, and he was seeing June. Touches like these were meant for June, not Dean—no matter how much he wished he had permission.
Dean recognized the weird act immediately—it was a funny superstition he’s heard around bars and pubs that by tying a knot with your straw wrapper and pulling until the paper ripped, if the knot stayed someone was thinking about you.
Cas embraced their son too, murmuring something quietly into his ear. Sam sort of collapsed onto a nearby chair, so Dean moved over to him.
Twenty minutes later found Dean glowering as he watched Sam and Cas squabble over the passenger seat again. He wasn’t even in the car yet, just watching them bicker and shoot arguments back and forth.
—neat rows of pots and planter boxes bursting with green leaves and brightly colored produce that just barely made room for the narrow paths between plants. It seemed never ending, the variety of colors, heights, and scents so diverse that Dean couldn’t focus on one plant alone.
still poking at the back of his head. What was the point in figuring it out anyway? Whatever it was probably wasn’t a big deal.
Cas sat shotgun with his hand resting on Dean’s thigh, absentmindedly rubbing his thumb up and down the denim. They dropped Sam off at the Bunker and Jack said goodbye before disappearing. There was a five hour drive ahead of them, and Dean turned to Cas.
Before Sam could started arguing with
, I want
Instead, with loud music as a filler for the quiet, a million new questions were running through Dean’s brain. The events of the last few months and all the questions he had shoved down for Cas’ sake were hitting him all at once, crowding his brain and making him itch to blurt them out.
“No, thanks.” Jack smiled. “I was only going to stay for breakfast anyway.”
“How come you looked so surprised Cas wasn’t attracted to women?”
home too.
It was supposed to be a cut and dry vampire hunt, just a week after their last one. Cas was with them this time since they figured the killings had been done by a nest. The more the better, and Dean didn’t really want to spend another three days away from him again. Sam was terrible company sometimes.
The only reason he’d woken up at all was because of the coldness next to him. Cas had snuck out a while ago, apparently.
“If you wanna be polite. Cas and Sam just fight over it anyway because they’re rude.” Dean shrugged, which earned him two kicks from the back.
Ever since his revelation in the thrift store and his talk with Jack, Dean was determined to figure out the

on his face how heartbroken he was when he first saw Cas with Daphne?
without Cas.
Their squabbling was soon out of Dean’s earshot. Jack was already bouncing in place, his eyes eagerly scanning the different flavors.
“It’s just an errand, Dean. I’ll be back in a few hours.”
“Yeah, yeah, that’ll work.” Sam agreed hurriedly, already fumbling to get the keys out of Dean’s pocket. He was more distracted by Cas’ hands suddenly clamping on his shoulders to notice.
Was this another
Buzz. Tap, tap, tap.
“Dean.” He said in surprise. “I thought you and Sam weren’t going to be back for another hour.”
Now wasn’t that a loaded question. Dean had only just made the revelation that his own thoughts were manufactured by John, so who’s the say what he liked to wear wasn’t a byproduct of him either?
Dean’s feet were moving before his conscious thought caught him. He was storming around Baby, boots clomping angrily against the blacktop as he rounded on Cas. The ex-angel didn’t step back, he just kept shouting at Dean as his eyes shone with wetness, turning his body to keep facing him.
Dean nodded in agreement.
“About an hour north of you?”
this time, the latter cut him off.
Dean’s hand twitched again from where it rested on his thigh, and his pinkie brushed against the soft denim of Cas’ jeans. A jolt of electricity ran up his arm, and he nearly twitched again. The twitch almost turned into a full-on jump when he felt Cas shift his thigh until it was pressed right up against his, trapping his pinkie between both pairs of denim. Cas had moved to turn and face the waitress fully while he spoke, leaving Dean helplessly torn between tearing his pinkie away from Cas’ warmth and not wanting to in case the contact was an accident and moving would draw attention. He barely heard what Cas ordered, a loud ringing filling his head and erasing all other thoughts.
Dean just nodded dumbly, starstruck by how Cas’ gaze still seemed to penetrate right through him despite being human.
“‘Course, Jack. Door’s always open.”
“Didn’t want to assume.” He shrugged, blinking at him blearily. “You good?”
Cas’ eyebrows furrowed and his mouth ticked down.
Jack nodded slowly.
“‘Was gonna make guacamole tonight out of ‘em.” He said. “Make tacos.”
“I think I will enjoy living at Bobby’s.” Cas mused a few quiet moments later. “I remember enjoying the way the sun rose over the wild grass fields. And I am partial to watching you work on cars.”
“—and one I never made with the desire to leave you.”
“You will
that needed to be learned, but he just didn’t know what yet.
“Spy? I thought that was a bad thing.”
Dean just nodded and flashed Cas an awkward smile before all but fleeing from the room before he embarrassed himself any further.
New Orleans in general were very aware of ghost activity, which made their jobs easier and harder. Some folk didn’t bat an eye when Sam told them they were looking for ghost, even helped them with ways to contact them. Others only believed it was a tourist trap and laughed at them.
“We don’t need the dumb fancy ones, Cas! They all taste the same!”
“Wow.” He said, awed.
“Until Sam demands to implement this rule, I will abuse his ignorance.” Cas replied, smiling too. He had been quick enough to claim shotgun a few times since the war started, and every time, Dean felt that itchy bundle of questions pressing in his throat. Why did Cas suddenly cared about seating arrangements? He had never bothered before, he just sat in the back because there was never any room in the front.
“Yes.” Cas breathed.
Sam’s eyebrows rose and Eileen was the one looking sheepish this time.
“I have flowers lined all around the outside to attract butterflies and bees.” Cas continued, eyes shining like he was in his element. “I hooked up a hose long enough to reach the outer edges so I can water each plant myself. And I collect busted fruit for the forest wildlife. They seem to appreciate it.”
this. The furthest they had allowed themselves to touch was an occasional shoulder clap and an even rarer hug. Unless one of them were injured or at a point of death, they didn’t indulge in casual touches.
“I messed up with him.” Dean said, gaining steam now. “I was shitty to him and he didn’t deserve it. M’ just…trying to do better ‘cause he deserves better. I know I’ve been doing a bad job at it. Dunno why the kid still likes me, but I’m…trying.”
It took Dean a few days to reorient himself under the mindset that he had been obliviously in love with Cas since Hell, basically. He completely forgot that Cas wasn’t even in the Bunker amidst this revelation, so it took a lot of internal coaxing to make himself leave the safety of his room to make dinner. He couldn’t face Cas, not so soon after discovering all this.
“What’re you doing hanging out here?” He asked instead. “You hate cars.”
“You have never
“Oops.” He said hoarsely. The sounds of fighting were gone. Sam came rushing into his already blurring vision.
“Okay.”
Dean found his free hand drifting towards the newly healed leaf, stroking the soft greenery with his thumb.
Dean throat suddenly had a hard time swallowing the lump forming there.
“Got back early.” He grunted, lifting his eyes. He saw Cas’ hand suddenly dart behind his back to tuck whatever he had into his pocket, but it was too late. Dean caught a flash of
“I don’t
that wasn’t going to go away but demanded his attention. There was something to this, something about how Dean didn’t pull away or feel that flash of fear at any physical contact that wasn’t intended to hurt.
“Yes.” Jack sighed. “But, um, he spotted me.” He looked embarrassed. “I’m sorry, Dean. I tried really hard.”
“Why didn’t you say anything?”
“And for you, sir?”
“Good.” Dean spun on his heel and marched away. He was still pissed that Cas had been using his free time to fuck the waitress, but he figured the ex-angel had gone through enough emotional turbulence for one night.
“This kind of spying’s harmless.” Dean assured him. “Just fly over to wherever he is and see what he’s doing. But don’t let him see you, got it? Then fly back.”
In the privacy of his room, Dean thought about
Sam glared at him, but didn’t protest when Cas ducked into the passenger seat with a smug smile. Dean just raised his hands in surrender when Sam turned his glare to him.
, exactly. They felt like the way Dean used to talk as a kid, echoing phrases and words to sound important, more grownup, more—like John.
“Anywhere else?” He croaked helplessly. The last thing he wanted was to go back to that place and get served by the girl who caught the man he’d been in love with for the past twelve years.
“Got a place in mind for tonight?” He asked instead, mindlessly rubbing the tingle away.
He felt that nostalgic sense of a chapter closing, similar to how he felt when he and Sam went back to their childhood home for a case all those years ago. The Bunker had been their home for years, memories were embedded in those walls that no one else could know or learn. It would be a bittersweet goodbye, leaving behind one era for another. He already knew some days he’d miss it, the first place he’d called home in all of his adult life.
Clutching his dress, Jack just about bolted towards the cart. Dean followed at a much slower pace, ambling by Cas and Sam while they argued, completely ignoring him.
He didn’t even notice when Cas’ face turned to him because now he was too busy admiring the rest of his features. He just stared, helplessly, happily, drowning in a sea of adoration and awe.
Dean hadn’t been doing great since Cas died for what felt like the fifteenth time in a row. He had stumbled across the security tapes to the dungeon while going through the Bunker’s mainframe and watched the soundless recording on loop while drinking himself into a blurry, slurring mess.
shit figured out enough for this conversation?
“The garden looks incredible when the sun rises.” Cas told him, swinging his feet lazily and munching on a strawberry. “I often watch it and read a book.”
“Nice move, kid.” He said, clapping Jack on the shoulder and chuckling.
It was only right. Dean couldn’t stand the thought of someone else living in the closest place his kid self had had to home.
“I’ll be going out for a few hours.” He announced around a mouthful. “I’ll be taking the truck.”
Dean, on the other hand, couldn’t even find his voice to speak, but his crazy urge to hit Cas square in the jaw getting stronger by the second. He’d probably leave a bruise this time, instead of that last time he’d tried and just hurt his own hand. But he just stared at Cas, stared at the face that had blood splattered on it the last time he had seen him, a bloodied body he had watched over and over so many times that he could probably get a Sharpie and retrace every single red stain. What had made him smile that wide, so wide his nose had crinkled? What had made his eyes shine with tears and happiness, what had made him glow with such joy?
“Can I get two scoops?”
Sam was up and hugging Dean tightly before he could even finish his sentence. He chuckled, but held on just as strong.
