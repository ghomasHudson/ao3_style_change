Dean finally stood from the table and placed his mug in the sink.  “I’m gonna go pack real quick.  Cas will be here in a few hours.”
Sam and Bobby dropped their food immediately and looked at him with wide eyes.  Sam immediately began scanning the skies for a silhouette and Dean cringed at the eager expression on his face.  Was Cas going to just pop up in front of them?  Would he actually fly over their heads?  He still didn’t know how the dimensional rift flight thing worked and doubted he ever would. Dean’s nerves traveled from his brain and into his hands as they began to shake uncontrollably.
“Alright, sweet cheeks, here's the bad.”  Pam started in her best no nonsense tone.  “You’ve got an infection in your lungs.  It’s a nasty one because it’s gone untreated for so long.  Which means that you’ve been hiding symptoms from your brother.”  She looked at Sam sternly, it wasn’t often that she got that hard look in her eye but it was intimidating when it did come out.  “We’ve discussed this and you CANNOT do that. You know what your prognosis is, hon… You know these infections are getting worse every time you come in and you’ve got to take better care of yourself.  Your years are winding down… You’ve gotta make sure that you aren’t ending them prematurely.”
There was silence for a long time.  Dean sipped his scalding coffee and pretended that he wasn’t bothered in the least by the tension in the room.  He refused to meet anyone’s eyes, it was a little childish, but he only had so much strength, and he’d spent a lot of it last night.
Several hours later found Bobby and Dean both sitting in the waiting room of the ICU upstairs. Dean had called Bobby as he parked the Impala in the hospital's lot and even though it was almost eleven at night, Bobby answered on the third ring. The man might be a grouch but he was devoted to Dean and Sam and Dean never had to wonder if Bobby would be there for them.
There weren’t even any doors anywhere.  All the rooms had the same arched opening but not a single one had a door.  There wouldn’t be many secrets between the two of them if this was how the whole place looked.  Occasionally, they would pass a window, and a warm stream of sunlight would dance across Dean’s arms.  It felt nice.  He was used to the climate of the Pacific Northwest, cool and wet.  It was warm here, almost suffocating, and dry.  He could almost feel the moisture leaving his skin as they walked.  But the heat was comforting in a surprising way.
The bird did not reply to that and Dean was again left in silence to consider his rapidly changing life circumstances.  The longer they went, the more Dean seemed to notice that the snapshots of the planet below were changing rapidly from the familiar forests of the North to the dry and sparse deserts of the South.  He had no idea where they were going but apparently it was far enough that he couldn’t run away back to home if the option presented itself.
Dean startled at the sound of the bird speaking to him.  He’d been lost in his own thoughts and hadn’t been paying much attention.  He hunched his shoulders towards his ears in irritation with himself for forgetting his surroundings.  Was he afraid?  He frowned in thought.  No, not really.  This was strange and new and he had a feeling that he was about to be a sex slave to Big Bird but he had healed Sam and honestly… that was the only thing that mattered.
The trees seemed to shudder as the sound of flapping shook their leaves. Dean frowned at that. A bird? The sound grew steadily louder until the air was moving around him in a whirlwind. Dirt and twigs swirled around his legs and he had to squint his eyes to be able to see. What the fuck?
John, for the most part, was silent.  He would work on the Impala from time to time, grouching often that it was going to become unusable if it wasn’t maintained and driven more.  He listened and he watched his sons and all the while Dean couldn’t shake the feeling that he was planning something.  John hadn’t ever been much a conversationalist, but this stillness around him now… felt threatening.  He ignored it as best he could and steered clear of John whenever possible.  He did notice as the time progressed that his father seemed to be attempting to single him out, get him alone.
Dean startled a little at the sudden voice in his head.  He was halfway through his burger and another bite was paused midway to his mouth.  He cleared his throat gruffly and set the burger back on his plate.  He wiped greasy fingers on his jeans and looked upwards with a frown.  There was no way this was going to go smoothly.  He shot a look at his dad from the corner of his eye and was disturbed to note that his father was watching him thoughtfully.
Mr. DinoDNA and I just received some pretty awful news so I apologize if this chapter is a little lackluster.  I'm doing what I can!
Irritation made an appearance on Sam’s face now.  “Don’t be an ass!  I thought you’d left again, or I’d dreamt you were here or something.”
“It’s Sam actually!”  Sam interrupted quickly.  Of the three of them, he’d seemed to recover the fastest.  His surprise had been replaced with a kind of child-like wonder at the creature before him.
Castiel frowned at him but didn’t seem to understand that Dean hadn’t meant that seriously.  To his credit, the large bird plowed on regardless of Dean’s little pity party.
The feathers on Castiel's chest puffed upwards and it stuck its chest outwards importantly. Apparently, Dean had struck a nerve.
Dean paused in his stirring but didn’t turn around.  “Well, buddy, I’m sorry but the feeling isn’t exactly mutual.”
Sam eyebrows raised in disbelief at that statement.  “Responsible?  You think talking to a giant BIRD in the middle of the FOREST about healing your brother with an incurable disease is responsible?!  If I didn’t know better I would think that you were on drugs!  I mean, Jesus, Dean!  How could you even think this was a good idea?”
Dean felt his eyes widen and his muscles tense at the sound of a voice speaking both in his head and on the wind.
Castiel had to admit that the plot of the movie was preposterous.  A group of men called “The Lone Rangers” breaking into a building to have their music played?  It seemed ridiculous to him.  How could there be more than one ranger when the word “lone” implies a solitary figure?  He was doing his best to do as Dean had suggested and enjoy it for what it was, but he was having a difficult time understanding some of the references and motivations.  Dean had chattered at him a few times to explain certains points but for the most part he had simply grinned like a loon and laughed uproariously at the jokes.  Castiel caught him mouthing along to the lines a few times silently, so it was apparent Dean had seen this more than a few times.
He watched in awe as the creature sailed up, up, up and over the treetops. It was gone from sight before Dean even remembered to close his mouth. He blinked slowly a few times before looking around himself in confusion.
Cas had called the film sacrilegious and Dean had found that absolutely hilarious.  Surely, Cas wasn’t out to harm anyone.  Dean hadn’t ever gotten that vibe from him.  In fact, Dean even sort of missed the bird.  But… John could be right, fooling him would be an easy way to get at his family and all the Hunters across North America.
The brothers settled back into silence.  Both were lost to their own thoughts while outside the sky slowly began to lighten.
Cas was silent for a time, he seemed to be weighing his words carefully before responding to that.  He levelled Dean with a firm stare and Dean did his best to apologize to him telepathically.  Dean could tell Cas had come to a decision by the flicker of steel in his eyes.  Cas stood taller and his large chest swelled, making him even larger than before.
“Home a day and already expecting to be waited on!”  Bobby groused but he was already rising from his seat at the table.  “Better let me tend to you there, princess.  If we let this one cook,” here he gestured in irritation at Sam, “he’s liable to just go get some grass clippings from outside and call it gourmet.”  Bobby overemphasized the word “gourmet” until it was almost a different word altogether.
There was a pause, almost as if the air around him was considering his question.  Dean inched himself slowly towards the trunk of the Impala while he waited.  Nothing sounded like it was close enough to pounce on him unawares but he didn’t want to startle a physical reaction out of whatever it was yet.
He felt his shoulders hitch upwards against his neck and he grit his teeth against the sound.  The ringing was so loud now that Dean was worried he was going to blow out both of his eardrums if it didn’t stop soon.  A scream ripped through his throat as the sound became unbearable.  He felt himself fall forwards and knew that he’d scrapped the shit out of his face on the gravel but that was a secondary concern.  His brain felt like it was fucking melting inside of his head and WHAT THE FUCK WAS THAT FUCKING SOUND!
He had put his foot down during a conversation with Sam's main physician before his care had been transferred to Pam. Dean had gotten a black eye and a split lip for it later on in the night from an angry John, but he had held his ground. Ever since then, Dean was always included in the conversations with the doctors and after Pam had come on board, Sam was too.
“I raised you to be a Hunter, to use your head.  Now, we both know that that hasn’t ever been your strong suit, but I expected better from you than this.  Who knows what this creature is!  And you’ve been living with it for months, it could be doing anything to you.  Hell, it could have its hands on you while you sleep and you’d never even know!”  John continued, his voice rising slightly.
“Long time no see, Feathers.”  Dean said with a half-grin.  He was attempting to break some tension by teasing the bird.
Dean watched in fascination as Sam’s breathing changed from halting and difficult to smooth and clear.  He’d gotten so used to seeing Sam’s chest labor so heavily that watching it’s movement even and shallow out was a shock to his system.  The air flowed smoothly in and out of his nose and Dean felt tears roll slowly down his cheeks.  This was the best Sam’s breathing had ever sounded.  Ever.
The creature had slowly lifted a wing while Dean had been distracted by his hand. Dean crouched lower and held the knife before him easily.
“What do you want?”  Dean yelled aloud to the quiet of the forest.  Better get this over with.  He didn’t relish the idea of some supernatural creature toying with him.
The bird that Dean had almost convinced himself he’d made up was standing in the doorway.  It was larger than he even remembered and he recoiled slightly in surprise.  The bird lowered it’s head to peer at him through the door and Dean met its eyes levelly.  A strange sense of calm washed over him and he trembled slightly.
He grumbled to himself impatiently and turned out of the room.  He should try to meditate to calm his nerves.
He thought in dismay.  He continued to lay on the ground and waited to see if it came again.  There was silence around him and he frowned upwards.
“I get it!”  Dean snapped at him.  Tensions were rising again and Dean’s temper flared unexpectedly.  “I get it, okay!  You think spending six months alone in a fucking dirt castle has been fun?  No!  I’ve been losing my mind!”  He pointed to his face, where a full beard had grown in.  “Does this look like I’m living it up?”  He grabbed a hold of the extra flab that he’d accumulated from his lack of exercise.  “Does this?  You think I’ve been convalescing at some retirement home in Beverly Hills and loving it?”
The two of them regarded one another silently.  Castiel seemed curious and unconcerned that he was staring at Dean like a specimen in a microscope.  Dean could feel his frustration mounting this morning and he frowned at the large bird in the doorway.
Castiel nodded to him in parting before stepping back into the hallway and hobbling off to parts unknown.  Dean watched after him in silence.  He doubted he needed to follow since Cas hadn’t said anything.  He didn’t really WANT to follow him at the moment.  He hated to admit that his heart was still racing after that little power move he’d just pulled, but here he was.
“I-I want to see you do it.  I want to see you heal Sam before we go.”  This was going to be non-negotiable for Dean.  He would go willingly, but not for nothing.  He wanted assurances that Sam was really going to be okay when he was gone.
Dean smiled sadly and squeezed the man a little tighter.  “I’m sorry, Bobby.”  He said quietly.  And he WAS sorry.  He hadn’t anticipated all of this, which had been stupid of him.  But, he’d been so single-mindedly focused on getting Sam healthy that he hadn’t even thought about anything else.  Bobby had said even John was looking for him, that surprised him.
The air around and above him was almost black and Dean doubted that they were flying like a normal bird would.  He had no idea what Castiel was, but he knew that if he possessed the kind of powers that could cure an incurable illness then he could likely be capable of anything.  Maybe they were travelling interdimensionally?  Dean immediately stopped that train of thought.  He knew he wasn’t smart enough to be even considering possibilities like these.
Dean gave him a bewildered look.  He hadn’t seen his dad for months prior to his leaving with Cas in the first place.  The chances that John would even be around during the month that Dean was there were slim to none.  If that was Cas’s only request, that wasn’t a problem.  Dean shrugged good naturedly and smiled.
Dean continued to stand awkwardly for another minute before he finally decided to make a move.  “Ok, look, we need to talk.”  He said before taking a seat in the armchair adjacent to the couch.
Dean, who was used to seeing the bird, smiled at him.  He had missed his feathered captor and that thought wasn’t as strange as it had been a few days ago.  It was good to see the large piercing eyes and curious head tilt that he’d grown so accustomed to over the last few months.
Dean watched him disappear into the darkness of the building.  Dean reached down to grab the duffel that Castiel had left at his feet.  He squared his shoulders and put a resolved expression on his face.  This was it, his new life.  He had no idea what lay inside, a house of horrors?  A sex dungeon?  Some kind of horrifying nest covered in bones?  It could be anything.  But, he DID know what lay back home.
He was feeling better today.  His headache was gone and he’d slept fairly well.  And now he felt shame at how he’d treated Cas yesterday.  What he had said had been true for the most part, but he hadn’t been forced to come here.  He’d chosen this and he would do it again.  It would just take some getting used too.
Dean cried and he raged for hours.  He broke several frames with pictures of his parents in them, smashed the wooden chair that had sat under his window, tore his curtains, and ripped his drawers from his dresser.  After he’d expended all of his energy, he sat heavily in the center of his floor, surrounded by the remnants of his fury.  He toyed idly with the frayed edge of a sock as he ignored the headache that was consuming him.
Dean nodded and blew some warm air onto his hands.  “Yeah, I think so.  He’s uh… a lot to take in, so just… I don’t know, be nice?”
The two of them tried to talk over one another for a few more minutes before the sound of the back door clanging open drew their attention.  Heavy boots and the wrinkling of bags could be heard from the kitchen and Dean and Sam looked towards the sound.
He sighed before opening his door.  The sound of it creaking open and closing sounded loud in the stillness of the air around him.  He stuffed his hands in the sweatpants he was still wearing and leaned back against the cool metal of the door.  He looked upwards and watched the scattering of stars in the sky as they twinkled happily down at him.  He was still too close to the city to see too many of them, but he was grateful for the few that managed to force their way into visibility.
The sounds of the forest had stilled and only the echo of the bullet piercing the air came to his ears. He watched with a frown as the thing in front of him cocked its head curiously before looking down at its chest, where it SHOULD have a large bullet hole. Dean was dismayed to note however, that nothing marred the feathered breast of the damn thing.
He finally lifted his head and met his brother’s warm hazel eyes.  This was more emotion than the two of them had shown one another in years and it was painfully obvious that both of them weren’t ready for it.
To his credit, Sam didn’t pitch a fit.  Didn’t make a face or even say anything really.  He simply closed his laptop and set it on the coffee table and turned to face Dean fully.  Now that he was looking his younger brother in the face he realized that ok, maybe he hadn’t planned enough for this conversation.  Maybe Sam would just accept what he was saying and it would be cool?
He continued to lay on the ground.  Whatever that had been had shaken him badly.  And whether it was real or in his head, he didn’t know.  He rested his hands on his chest and felt the air entering and leaving his lungs.  He must have had a flip out, nothing was happening out here.  His fucking brain was cracking into pieces, he needed to get it together or they’d be throwing him into a padded room.
Dean threw the Impala into park and leaned back in his seat.  He wasn’t sure how long he’d been driving.  He wasn’t even sure where he was or how he’d gotten here.  He took a moment to castigate himself for driving in that frame of mind, it had been dangerous and he knew better.  But, he hadn’t been able to THINK.  He’d just needed to go.
This one is shorter, I know, I'm sorry!  It was either have this be short or wait another week or two to get a larger one put out.  But, this felt like an okay place for a chapter break.  Our boys are moving forward slowly!
He was easing the lid of the trunk open slowly when the voice came again. A note of confusion in it's tone.
“Why don’t you tell me everything?  From the very beginning.”  Bobby asked in an attempt to keep the peace.
Bobby eyed him critically for a moment before sipping his coffee.  “You know damn well that man never answers his phone.  Left him a message.”
He took a few more minutes to familiarize himself with the kitchen before he poked his head out of the room to look up and down the hallway beyond.  Well, Dean Winchester was nothing if not a Hunter at heart.  He needed to get a feel for the layout of this place first and foremost.  Since it looked like Big Bird had left him for the moment, now was as good a time as any.
“He.”  Dean finally snapped.  “He told me his name.”  Though Dean had technically given him the nickname, but Sam didn’t need to know anymore than he already did.
Castiel stood patiently in the doorway of his room.  Seemingly unperturbed by speaking to Dean while he was naked and in a bathtub.  Dean felt his cheeks heat immediately and made an attempt to cover himself, though he doubted it was necessary.
Dean grinned and opened the can.  He peered over Bobby’s shoulder and sure enough, there were fat, juicy hamburger patties sizzling on the small grill.  And something that looked suspiciously like a mushroom that was probably for Sam.  Dean stomped his feet a little to try and warm them and went to sit at the picnic table with his brother.  Both Sam and Bobby were wearing heavy coats and Dean felt a pang in his chest seeing them there.  They weren’t happy, and they didn’t approve of his decision to leave again, but they were supporting him and trusting his judgement.  He fucking loved these two.
Sam perked up noticeably at the question and Dean smirked to himself at his brother’s excitement.  Little shit LOVED school, Dean couldn’t ever figure out why, Lord knew he hadn’t enjoyed it.
Dean was about two seconds from griping at Castiel about their destination, when the large bird stopped.  In front of Castiel was a room, larger than the ones Dean had seen so far.  And surprisingly, this one WAS furnished.  Though, that may be a stretch of the term.
He still hadn’t decided what he was going to do about Cas.  It felt as if he changed his mind every minute on how to proceed.  First it sounded like John in his head telling him to gank the son of a bitch, then a voice that sounded like Sam would remind him of everything that Cas had done for him and his family.  Dean didn’t like all of this morally grey, decision-making bullshit.  It was so much easier to just see a monster and kill it.  Now, because of Cas, he was starting to question if every monster they’d hunted had deserved it.  What made a monster a monster?
Cas had insisted that he’d eat something before turning in for bed and he had to admit it had been a good idea.  Cas had even stuck around to listen to Dean go over and over what had happened.  He felt like a little kid, but he was happy!  Truly happy for the first time since he’d come here.  Maybe they could work out some kind of system, hopefully this wasn’t a one-off, where Dean could go out and still be here for whatever it was that Cas needed.
Sam and Bobby were in the backyard and Dean moved quickly through the kitchen and out the back door to them.  On his way he snagged a jacket by the door, because it was almost March in Canada.  Dean was surprised to see their old and busted picnic table covered in a cheap tablecloth.  Bobby was at the grill and waved a spatula at him over his shoulder.  He looked incredulously at his brother who gave him a toothy smile.
Sam smiled at him weakly and gave him a thumbs up.  “Should be back… in fighting shape soon… coach!”
I'm awful at updating.  I can't keep to a schedule to save my life.  There aren't excuses I'm just like this.  Hopefully you guys are still with me here haha.
There was something standing in front of him. He could sense it even with his eyes closed. Whatever this thing was, it was right in front of him and he was completely vulnerable to an attack like an amateur.
He shifted so he could turn his back against the side of the car.  That would provide him at least some protection from whatever was out there.
The creature pulled its wing back in a jerking motion before continuing its movement from before. Dean hacked and slashed upwards feverishly, once or twice he knew he came into contact with the meat of the things arm but it never reacted beyond a tilt of its head. Was this thing fucking immortal? What the hell!
Dean rubbed an anxious hand against the back of his head.  “Your condition, I think I have a way to… ya know, cure you?”
Cas’s pop culture education, as Dean called it, was progressing slowly.  He had no frame of reference for jokes or material and most, if not all, of it had to be explained to him.  Since watching the movie Airheads, Cas had been introduced to a number of movies from Dean’s teenage years as well as some of his favorite music.  Putting aside the historical inaccuracies of Encino Man, and the scientific impossibility of something like Biodome, Cas found that he was enjoying himself.  Dean seemed to enjoy the older slapstick style comedies, with simple plots and dirty jokes.  They weren’t difficult to follow and once Cas understood that he was supposed to just ENJOY them for what they were and not point out their inaccuracies, he decided he liked them too.
The smell of coffee teased his nostrils and he found it almost too easy to allow it to pull him from his musty bedroom and down the stairs.  He didn’t worry about changing, he was in boxers and a plain t-shirt, definitely presentable enough for breakfast in his own home he reasoned.  Bobby was rummaging around in the cabinets for something when Dean entered the kitchen.
He paused and shifted his wings against his back.  He shook out his great feathered head and shuffled on his large taloned feet.  He was getting more uncomfortable in this skin as each day wore on.  He wondered though, if he even remembered what it felt like to be in his true form.  He sighed sadly, a human gesture, and continued his vigil from the treetops.
Dean Winchester didn’t run away, he was a man, tough as nails, and a Hunter.  But, he could get on the hot foot out of a sticky situation if necessary.  He scooted around the inside perimeter of the building and leapt over a fallen beam.  He’d lost his pipe and so was without a weapon for the moment.
Dean looked at the forest in front of him suspiciously before slowly leveraging himself upright and to his feet.  He wasn’t dressed appropriately for a fight.  He was in a t-shirt and sweatpants for God’s sake.  At least he had on his work boots, so if he needed to hoof it anywhere that wouldn’t be an issue.  Why hadn’t he grabbed a gun earlier!?  He’d even thought to himself that he needed to move one from the trunk, but he’d gotten distracted.  Fuck, it was a rookie mistake and one that was likely to get him killed now.
“Bobby, I don’t think that’s-”  Sam began only to be interrupted by a sharp look from the older man.  Sam sighed heavily and apologized under his breath to his brother.
Another pause in the air.  What the hell was this thing playing at?  Dean was slowly running through the catalogue of supernatural creatures he had in his head.  He was drawing a blank at the moment.  It wasn’t run of the mill, not a werewolf or vampire.  Could be a witch he supposed.  It wouldn’t be hard for them to make it seem like he was hearing things.
Bobby eyed the two brothers silently for a moment before throwing his hands in the air in defeat.  “Fine, fine, but if he turns into a lizard and eats you in the middle of the night, I don’ wanna hear about it!”
Cas said firmly.  John was looking positively mutinous but it was obvious Cas had done something to prevent him from moving or speaking.
Dean took the stairs two at a time and landed on the first floor with a thunk of his heavy boots.  A large shadow was cast on the wall from the window set into the front door.
“Yer doin' your best ta make sure this old ticker is workin’ still, boy. This rate I'll need a pacemaker with the grief you two cause me on a damn near permanent basis.” Bobby said from the chair next to Sam's bed.
The voice came again.  Dean felt himself tense again at hearing it.  He was hearing it in his head but he was sure that the sound of it was superimposed against the wind around him.  He couldn’t tell where it was coming from.  But, there wasn’t anything more fucking suspicious than a mysterious voice telling you not to be afraid.
Dean hummed in acknowledgement.  Sam had wanted to work in law pretty much since he was still in diapers.  When he’d been in elementary school, while he was still able to attend school full-time, he had had a little First Nations girl in his class that he’d been completely smitten with.  They had bonded because they both had holes in their shoes and shirts that were too big for them.  Sam had been thrilled to meet someone who dressed in hand-me-downs like him.
Dean wasn’t quite sure what to do to expend all of this excited energy inside of him.  He jumped up in excitement once and then gave Cas another brief hug.  “This is great!  When can we go?!  I need to pack!”
“Dean!  Son, where have you been?!”  John asked desperately as he pulled away from his oldest.  His large hands had a tight grip on Dean’s shoulders and his face was stained with tears.
But… that was where the excitement really ended.  The place was completely empty.  No, furniture, no knick knacks, not even the nest Dean had been expecting.  There was nothing here to indicate that anyone had ever lived here.  He shot a sideways glance at Castiel as they continued walking.  He had no idea what their destination was, and he doubted that it mattered considering how their surroundings looked.  He doubted a fully furnished penthouse was laying just beyond the next bend.
Cas had given him the barest amount of info about the case, which was likely so that Dean could actually WORK the case and not just salt and burn the ghost. He appreciated the thought.  Cas had told him that he wouldn’t be far if Dean needed him.  Dean had rolled his eyes at that, but Cas had insisted that Dean call out to him if he was in danger. Dean had promised with his fingers crossed behind his back. He was a Hunter! He didn’t need Big Bird as backup.
The room got silent at that, Dean shifted uneasily on his feet. Normally, they could joke about Sam's condition, but right now… it felt different this time. Sam looked worse, there were more machines, Tessa hadn't really smiled…
Silently, a large pair of blue eyes shifted into view between the boughs of a tall tree. They had stepped out of sight as soon as the attractive young man had tensed in the parking lot. The creature they belonged to shifted once to settle itself. Then they peered unblinking through the still of the warm night, and waited.
He heard his father’s weight shift forward and he glanced at the man anxiously.  John was sitting on the edge of his seat and watching Dean with calculating eyes.  He laced his fingers together and rested his chin on them.  Dean swallowed convulsively.
“Uh, not much… Catching up on some homework.”  Sam said.  He was still eyeing Dean suspiciously but went back to typing on his keyboard.
He shook his head and frowned at himself.  He was being dramatic.  Who gave a shit if someone could walk in here and say that he’d slept here?  He lived in the memories of his loved ones and that was a more important place to have left his mark than a childhood bedroom.  He yawned loudly and began smacking out the pillows and bedspread to try and rid them of their accumulated dust.  It was a little musty in here and he would likely be sneezing in a few minutes but that was okay.  He was comfortable here and he was really looking forward to sleeping in his bed again.
He shook his head at himself.  He could feel the beginnings of a headache forming behind his eyes.  It was irritating him, and the fact that he couldn’t figure out Cas’s game was really pissing him off.
Dean had put on some weight, likely from eating so well and so often with nothing to do to rid himself of the excess calories.  But, he looked happy more or less.  There was a ghost of pain in his eyes from time to time, a shadow of sadness when he was alone in the evenings and a wistfulness to his expression when he looked out the windows of the mansion.  He missed his brother, he’d sacrificed a lot to come here for Castiel.  Maybe he could do something for him?
Dean sat up abruptly, spilling water over the sides of the tub.  He must have fallen asleep in the water.  So much for Hunter reflexes!  He whipped his head to the side, looking at Cas in confusion.
Dean rubbed a hand against the back of his head and searched for the right words to say.  “I uh, I’m not going back to the garage…”
Dean gave him a boyish grin.  “Guess I never was too good at counting!”  He chuckled a little at his joke and went back to running his hands along Cas’s joints.
“Oh, give it a rest already!”  Sam had puffed up, he was considerably larger than John now, taller and broader, and it was a fairly intimidating display.  “You’re not going to bully him anymore, alright?  Christ, you’re something else, you know that?  Your son just told you he gave up his life and his freedom to heal me of an incurable disease and you want to fucking fight him?”
Dean had never let Sam see him like this. This was a weakness that Dean only indulged when he knew he wasn't under any watchful eyes. He had to be strong for Sam, he was the rock of the family. Sam had it hard enough, he didn't need to worry about Dean too. He let the air in his lungs out in one long push. He was ok.
“I don’t know… I guess… I wasn’t.”  Sam answered.  He wasn’t willing to meet Dean’s eye and that was fine.
Castiel continued with his odd hobbling steps, undeterred by Dean’s questions now.  There was silence for a moment before Castiel responded quietly.
Dean grimaced.  That was basically the long and short of it, though it sounded ridiculous from Bobby’s mouth.  He shrugged awkwardly.  “I mean, that’s basically right.  I did get to go on a hunt the other day… a salt and burn.”
Cas was unused to physical contact, especially as much as he was getting right now.  But, the feeling of Dean wrapped around him, his warmth pressed close to his chest and joy radiating off of him seemed to crack something solid in his chest.  He blinked a few times before he nervously leaned forward to rub his head against the side of Dean’s.  It was something he’d never done before but it felt so right that he couldn’t believe he hadn’t done it before.
“Yeah, well, just don’t forget I’m here.  I’m not hanging out just for the Hell of it, I’m here because of you.  I don’t wanna starve to death or lose my marbles because I’m locked in solitary, ya know?”  Dean said angrily to the sink.  He still hadn’t turned back around.
Castiel nodded to him and lifted a wing upwards.  This time, Dean stepped against the side of the bird without prompting and in another blinding flash of light, they were gone.
Dean rolled his eyes again. Was he really having this conversation with Big Bird right now? Jesus, he’d lost his fucking mind. “Sex slave then?”
“Motherfucker.”  Dean said quietly.  “Sammy, try to calm down, ok?  I’m gonna get some things together, we gotta go to the hospital.”  Dean ran a hand through his brother’s hair and took a calming breath himself.
Dean opened his mouth to ask “where” but the creature had already spread it’s enormous wings. He was startled at their absolute vastness. They had to be at least fifteen feet across and Dean felt immediately cowed by their size. They pumped up and down a few times before the damn thing actually lifted from the ground. Dean used an arm to shield himself from the debris that was being kicked up by the amount of wind that was being generated.
A quiet shuffling echoed behind him and he started to turn around only to be stopped by large hands wrapping around his waist.  Dean froze in surprise, facing the sink.  Behind him, Sam had creeped up to wrap himself around his older brother and was squeezing him gently.  Dean almost cracked a wise comment, until he noticed the slight tremor in Sam’s arms.  He frowned and hung his head slightly.
“Is that a nickname?  Short for something?  Did you give it that name?”  Sam peppered him with questions and Dean scrubbed a hand across his face in anger.
Castiel responded negatively and Dean spent the rest of the walk discussing the merits of movies that Castiel had never seen or heard of.  Dean was apparently a “pop-culture buff” though he’d made Castiel swear not to tell anyone.  The entire conversation was confusing to him, but he was just happy to be included in Dean’s plans.
But for right now, he would just listen to the trees and he would look at the stars and he would breathe.
Dean worked his tongue against one of his back molars to remove something that had gotten stuck back there.  “What is it?”
The day after he’d met her, he had asked Dean if her Dad was a hunter too.  Dean, who had been around twelve at the time, had had a hard time explaining to Sam that no, her dad wasn’t a hunter.  But, because she was First Nations, people treated her family badly and it could be hard for her parents to find work.  It wasn’t an elegant description of racism, he was only a child himself, but Sam had eventually understood.  He’d been incensed immediately and was still angry about it to this day, 14 years later.
Cas was silent for a time.  Dean knew that he’d heard him, it was a thoughtful and considering silence.  The longer Cas took to answer though, the greater the sinking feeling in his stomach grew.  Cas leaned his large head over and used his sharp beak to pluck at Dean’s hair delicately.  Cas ran his beak against the side of Dean’s head gently.  It was a gesture meant to give comfort and Dean was surprised to note that it felt nice in a foreign way.
Now though, he needed to sleep.  It had been a long day and his head was still killing him.  Once he entered his room he spared a glance to the copper tub in the corner.  That was going to be an adventure for tomorrow.  He didn’t have the wherewithal to deal with it now.  Dean paused as he entered his adjoining bathroom.
His eyes zeroed in on the matches that he’d dropped.  They were about fifteen feet away from him at the moment and he needed to get back to them as quickly as possible.  He didn’t want to drag this out longer than necessary, especially if that rosary wasn’t her tie to the world.  He eyed the ghost of the woman as she hovered in front of him in mid-air.
Dean thought. He knew that he had blood flowing down his hand and across his arm to drop off of him at his elbow. He must have cut himself worse than he had thought. He could worry about stitches later. Right now, he nee-
Dean smiled and sent Cas an image of himself doing a thumbs up.  Hopefully, he got that image.  Though whether he did or didn’t, Cas didn’t say.  But, he was silent after that so Dean assumed their conversation was over.
. Dean thought with a laugh.  That would certainly surprise his brother.  Though, despite the fact that he’d been weak his whole life, he had still been trained as a Hunter.  No, plopping down in the middle of the house would likely get him shot.
Sam had gotten up a while ago to go on another of his psychotic runs around the property and Bobby was likely still snoring in the armchair downstairs.  Dean had made the mistake of assuming his dad would be asleep as well, or working on the Impala as he’d been doing recently, and so his guard was down that morning.  He realized his mistake just as soon as he stepped into his room.
He leaned forwards and gently scooped his brother’s thin frame away from the bed and against his own chest.  Sam’s frail arms wrapped around his shoulders and the two embraced tightly for the first time in what felt like years.  Tears fell slowly from their eyes and both felt the heartbeat of the other against their ribs.
Dean was a man of honor and so Castiel wasn’t worried about him returning.  He had given his word and he would keep it; such was the type of soul he possessed.  Even with the certainty that Dean would return to him today, Castiel couldn’t deny his nerves.  He hadn’t seen the man in a month and while he was ecstatic to have his presence here again, he knew that Dean wouldn’t be happy.
John’s eyes narrowed dangerously.  “You’re telling me you made a- a DEAL with some supernatural fucking BIRD!  You have no idea what it is, no idea what could have happened, and you just waltzed out without so much as a by your leave?  Do you have ANY idea how worried we’ve been!  We’ve been looking for you for MONTHS!  You selfish, ungrateful, little shit!”
He glanced at Bobby while they waited on Pam to finish reviewing the information in Sam's paperwork. No, he wasn't ashamed, in fact, he was damn fucking proud to be a Singer too.
Dean gave a short fist pump at that before making a “gimme” gesture at the older man.  Bobby chuckled at him and passed the bag across Sam’s bed to Dean’s eager hands.
Dean gave that a moment to sink in.  Over the course of his entire life, no one had ever been able to control John, except maybe Dean’s mother.  The closest they could ever get though was Bobby, John respected the man enough to at least listen to what he had to say.  Hell, he’d basically dumped his kids with the man and let Bobby raise them for the most part.  If Bobby had had a “nice long talk” with John, then Dean trusted that John would at least settle down a bit.
Dean had managed to avoid him so far, and John had been unsuccessful, but Dean had a feeling his father would find a way eventually.  He would likely become more persistent as Dean’s time with them drew closer to an end.  It made him nervous and even more so with Cas’s warning still ringing loudly in his ears.
Dean shrugged to himself before entering Sam's ICU room. They should get membership cards to this place, it felt like a second home at this point since they were here almost monthly.
He rushed upstairs to his room to grab his cell where it was plugged into a wall charger.  And finally, Sammy.  He hurried back into Sam’s room and was happy to note that Sam hadn't gotten any worse.  This was likely just another lung attack, he had them every month or two, but Dean never took any chances.
Dean could cry tears of relief at that. Fucking bless Bobby and his ability to handle a difficult situation with ease. Dean was struggling with his composure at the moment.
As it was, Dean was laying in almost total silence.  The only sound was his own breathing and the rushing of blood in his ears.  There was a quiet shuffle, a gentle disturbance of the mattress and then nothing.  Dean’s muscles were tensed for an attack.  Castiel had told him to ignore any strange sounds, but did that extend to physical disturbances?  Had something crawled into bed with him?  The thought terrified him.  He waited for several minutes, but nothing seemed to be happening.  Maybe he had imagined it?  Fuck, he wished he had a light to check this out.  He didn’t want to go blindly groping around in the dark with God knew what around.
Dean blinked stupidly at the creature. What had it done? He glanced down and did a quick inventory of his body. Feet, check. Legs, check. Stomach and chest, check and check. He flexed his fingers and noted absently that his finger didn't hurt anymore. He spared a look at the arm that had been covered in blood only moments before. Only… there was no blood now. And in fact, the deep gouge in his finger was gone as well.  Actually, the cuts across his face felt like they had disappeared as well.
“Yes, Sam, go back.  It was part of the agreement.  I could visit for a month, then I have to go back.”  Dean snapped.  He wasn’t angry, he was just so fucking tired of all of this drama.  His homecoming was supposed to be easy smiles, laughter and lots of junk food.  Not all of this melodrama.
“Ever since your mom… Ever since we lost your mom, I’ve done everything in my power to take care of you and your brother.  It may not have looked like it all the time, but I tried.  I’m not a perfect man, but I did my best to raise you to be a man.”
“Why am I here, Cas?  What on Earth could you possibly need me for?”  Dean asked in exasperation.  The question had been burning through him for weeks and though he doubted the bird had a satisfactory answer, it couldn’t hurt to ask.
Dean had no idea what Cas did when he wasn’t around, he couldn’t even begin to speculate what a giant bird could have to do to keep himself busy but there must have been something.  Other than mealtimes, he didn’t see him too much.  Occasionally, he would ask Cas to recharge his computer so he could continue to watch the movies he’d saved to his external harddrive and play the games he could play offline.  Cas had been interested in what Dean did on his computer, but he was polite enough not to pry.
“I’m not going to ruin someone else’s life because I can’t be realistic about my condition.  She’s nice and she’s funny and way smarter than she has any right to be.  Let me pretend that I could ask her out.  That I could take her on a date, and probably embarrass myself but that she would find it endearing.  Let me pretend that we could fall in love and have the wedding of our dreams.  That a few years from now we could have kids, a little girl with my hair and a little boy with her eyes.  Let me pretend that I could be a lawyer and we could grow old together.  Let me… let me pretend that I could be happy for a really, really long time and that I would die as an old man who was proud of his life and what he had accomplished.  Just… Just let me pretend, Dean.  Let me pretend, but don’t tell me I could ask her out, please.”
Cas inclined his head towards the man, but didn’t respond other than that.  Dean glanced briefly upwards and was surprised to notice that the sky was beginning to clear of the storm that had been brewing, apparently that HAD been Cas’s doing.  Sam stepped away and stood alongside Bobby again.  He nudged the older man in the ribs gently and Bobby finally snapped out of his solo staring contest with Castiel.
Castiel looked surprised at the tone of his voice and blinked at him a few times.  He seemed to consider his options for a moment before shuffling back a few steps and further into the hallway.
Dean made a decision that night.  If that bird, Castiel, hadn’t been a fever dream, then he would agree to his terms.  Whatever they were.  Dean’s life was nothing compared to Sam’s.  Sam deserved the world, Dean was just a glorified caretaker.  And if Sam was healed, well then, he wouldn’t really need Dean anymore.  It was a depressing thought, but it was the truth.  Who knew, maybe Castiel would still let him hunt or something?
“Oh yeah?”  Dean asked with mock arrogance.  “What do you wanna help with?”  He had almost made it around the car and to the trunk.  Now, he just needed to figure out how to open it casually.
Dean had been wondering that himself.  How could he answer Sam without giving him too much hope but also not completely dashing that same hope?  He could hear Bobby turn towards them from his position at the grill.  “Honestly, Sammy… I don’t know.  I think so, truthfully, I think so.  But, there are weird… rules to this whole thing and I’m not really sure what they are.  And it doesn’t seem like Cas knows for sure either.”
“Don’t ‘Bobby’ me, boy!  Do you have any idea how worried we’ve been?  I thought you were dead!  Then your brother here has been talking about giant miracle birds with healing powers, what was I supposed to make of any of this?  You didn’t tell me anything except to watch after Sam, as if that was ever even a question! I-”
Dean nodded to his surrogate father sadly.  He clapped Bobby’s shoulder in response a few times before letting his hand drop.  There was pain in his expression for all of a moment before he bounced back.
They reminisced on things from their childhood and Sam shyly told Dean about the beautiful blonde he’d started seeing from school.  Dean managed to keep his teasing about the whole affair to a minimum.  He was truly happy beyond belief that Sam had finally gotten the courage to ask Jess out after pining away for her for so long.  It was a loud and joyful dinner and Dean’s heart felt lighter than it had in months just being back around his family.  A distant part of his mind tried to remind him that this was only temporary but he buried that for now.  He wasn’t going to let that ruin these new memories he was making.
It had taken Dean a long time to realize that John was a bad father.  He had believed in John’s mission, had been raised to believe that the creature that killed his mother deserved retribution.  He still did to some degree, but… But, there was Sam.  Small, sick Sam.  How could dad have just bailed on his sons?  Dean had raised Sam, he’d been his father and his mother.  Dean hadn’t ever really gotten to be the brother he’d always wanted to be.  He had to be something more for Sam.  He didn’t regret it, he didn’t blame Sam for it, Dean had done everything he could for his brother, he always would.  Sam deserved it, he’d gotten a shitty deal in life and the least Dean could do was make it easier for him.
“You shut your mouth, boy. God willing I'll be in the grave before that and the two of you can wear veils and cry at my funeral. Now, enough of the morbid boo-hoos.” Bobby said in his usual no nonsense tone.
Dean shook his head and pinched the bridge of his nose.  He was being maudlin.  He still had work to do before Castiel came.  Dean grabbed an old hunting bag from the bottom of his closet and began to systematically fill it up with his traveling essentials.  Who knew if Castiel would even let him take this, but it gave him something to do with his hands.
“Of course!  His oldest son has been missing for months but he can’t be bothered to answer his phone.  Makes total sense!”  Sam griped.
Dean paused in the doorway and placed his fists on his hips.  “Mmhmm…”  He replied giving Sam a stern look.  Sam’s face couldn’t look guiltier and Dean pursed his lips in irritation.  “I thought we went over this when you were like 14.  No porn in the living room.”
“Whatever.”  Dean said over his shoulder.  Apparently, he should have mentioned he was thinking about going before.  Clearly, springing this on the man hadn’t been a good idea.  He would know for the future.
He could tell by the defiant look in both of their eyes that the conversation was far from over, but they chose to let this battle end for now.  It was late and they were all tired.  The look on Sam’s face was absolutely murderous, his lips had thinned into such a tight line that they almost disappeared all together.  Silently, Sam grabbed the broom and dustpan and began cleaning up the glass on the floor.  Bobby silently stormed into the living room to sit in “his” chair and Dean rested his head against the kitchen table, weariness falling over him like a fog.
“So! After Bobby and I realized that you hadn’t like, died in a car crash or gone on a bender or been killed by a shifter or something, I started researching what you’d told me.  You know, after I got over the fact that you were literally missing and I was like Arnold Schwarzenegger overnight.”
After he’d settled, Dean focused on the direction they were heading.  He had missed this hallway when he’d first set out and while he wasn’t sure how that had been possible, he could tell now that it was just two more turns until he was back where he had started.
He had rounded the corner of the doorway and was a few steps down the hall when Dean’s quiet voice carried over to him from the kitchen.
Dean gave his brother another stern look before he began pulling things from the bags and setting them on the counter.  Sam didn’t normally neglect his treatments like that, Dean wondered what could have distracted him.  He kept his peace for now though, Sam looked a little too weak to be dealing with an Inquisition at the moment, but he would be bringing it up later for sure.
“I live here, bitch!”  Dean snapped back.  He had been worried about his homecoming, but apparently he just needed to pass a creature test and get punched in the face and all was good.
The tremor in Dean’s hands became more pronounced and Dean clasped his hands together tightly between his knees in an attempt to hide them.
Sam looked down at himself nervously and ran a hand across his stomach.  “Yeah, it’s me.”  Sam gave him a boyish grin.  “At least I think so, I find it hard to believe when I look in the mirror every morning.”
“You hadn’t given me a ton to go on, and to be honest I was so angry with you at the time that I didn’t really focus too much on what you were saying.  Sorry.”  He looked sheepish now.  “But!  Giant bird in the forest was somewhere to start!  Obviously, the first place to start was with the thunderbird legends.”
The brothers looked pensive for a moment before Bobby interrupted them with a gruff, “And what am I, chopped liver?”
Dean startled and looked around himself in confusion.  His heart pounded furiously and he tensed as he scanned the room critically.  He’d just heard Cas’s voice but judging by Bobby and Sam’s reaction, they hadn’t.  <>Fuck, I hope you’re talking to me and I’m not going bonkers.. Dean thought cautiously.
He stood slowly and carefully turned in a slow circle, watching the area with shrewd eyes. He had weapons in the trunk if he needed them, though he may not have time to reach them he realized angrily. He'd grown lax in recent years apparently. He turned another slow circle.
Bobby sighed in exhaustion.  The fact that these boys hadn’t been the death of him years ago was a small miracle.  He watched as Sam crashed around the corner of the kitchen to chase after Dean for some sort of slap fight.  He rolled his eyes Heavenward and rubbed tiredly at a spot under his cap.
Cas rolled his eyes but selfishly, he was enjoying the attention.  How long had it been since someone touched him for pleasure?  Touched him with the intent to heal and not to harm?  He couldn’t even remember.  And from what he COULD remember, it didn’t feel like this.  It didn’t feel like large warm hands soothing the aches of his body and his mind.  He allowed his eyes to close for a moment to try and memorize the sensation.
And all at once, it stopped.  Dean almost didn’t realize it at first, his head still felt like it was ringing.  After a time though, he discovered that the ringing in his head was only his ears remembering the sound.  He rolled onto his back experimentally and looked upwards at the stars.  Nothing seemed out of place now.  He slowly removed his hands from over his ears and listened experimentally to the air around him.  Only the soft sounds of the forest came to him and he frowned.  What the hell had that been?
Dean was too excited to even notice the passage of time, only that it was taking forever!  He couldn’t believe he was being allowed to see Sam and Bobby.  He had all but resigned himself to living in that clay Hell for the rest of his miserable life.  But, if Cas was willing to let him out for playdates!  Well, maybe it wouldn’t be so bad after all.  Hopefully this wasn’t a one time thing.  He refused to even consider that actually.  Cas wasn’t so cruel hearted.  Actually, despite being a little odd, Cas was really tender hearted.  Dean had grown to like him and the evenings they spent together despite himself.
The Hunter in him encouraged him to wear his clothes, including his boots.  If he needed to scamp away in a hurry that would be the easiest way to do so.  The Couch Potato in him was telling him to go with the pj’s though.  If he needed to scamp away, he reasoned, where the fuck was he going to go?  It’s not like he could hop in Baby and tear off down the road.
“Certainly got that idjits attitude.”  Bobby grumbled to himself.  “Well then, yah know the drill.  Arm out.  Sam, hold him.”
“The good news is that we’ll be able to treat the infection.”  Pam continued in a cheerier voice.  “This won’t be your last visit with us, and frankly I’m glad for that.  How else am I gonna flirt with your brother and Bobby here if you suddenly up and keel over unexpectedly?”  She winked at Sam but Dean noticed her smile was a little sad.
Dean left his bag in the room.  He doubted he had much to worry about here.  The worst they were likely to get in here were other large birds, though not as large as Castiel he hoped.  He had a thought then.  His boots thunked loudly in the hallway as he followed after Castiel.  This place was HUGE.  And yeah, he’d only ever seen Castiel, but that didn’t mean there weren’t other creatures here.  Fuck, was there like a whole bird colony living in this thing?  Was he about to stumble across a bunch of them nesting or something?  Just because he doubted that Castiel would eat him, didn’t mean any other creatures would treat him the same way.
“Okay, Sammy.”  Dean nodded to him jerkily.  “Okay.”  And with that, he turned towards the stairs and up to his room.  He slumped on the edge of his bed and allowed himself to break apart again.
Dean woke the next morning with gritty eyes and a fuzzy head.  He had assumed he’d sleep like the dead here, wrapped in the feeling of home and happiness but… well, that hadn’t really been the case.  He’d tossed and turned for a large portion of the night, unable to get comfortable.  There was some sort of… presence?  Feeling?  Impression?  He wasn’t sure what to call it, but there was something about sleeping in the clay mansion that just settled him.  He’d wondered before if something had been getting into bed with him but surely that wouldn’t have relaxed him.  He definitely would have noticed Cas’s giant feathered ass if he was crawling under the sheets with him every night, right?  Regardless of what it was though, he’d apparently grown used to it over the months.  He rubbed a knuckle against one crusted eyelid uncomfortably.
The ensuing screaming from Bobby and Sam was one for the record books.  Though this time, Dean wasn’t much of a participant.  He did his best to explain and to calm them down, even offered false promises that he would be able to visit again, which he hoped was true but wasn’t certain.  Bobby and Sam stormed around the house, a glass and two plates ended up smashing against the floor.  Bobby had sworn to hunt Cas down to exterminate him if he tried to take Dean from them again.  Sam absolutely refused to even believe it was a possibility.  It took over an hour for them to wear themselves out, and by the time they had, Dean could feel the bags under his eyes as if they were fresh bruises.
The creature repeated its words from earlier though they didn't calm Dean any more now than they did before. “Sorry Big Bird, not gonna happen.” Dean said as he crouched lower with the knife held in front of him.
Dean continued to sip his coffee and let Sam speak.  Dean didn’t really know what Cas was, but he could hazard a guess that whatever he was, it was something more ancient than a thunderbird.  He wasn’t sure why he felt that way, but something about the look in Cas’s large eyes spoke of a creature that had seen millenia come and go.  Dean let Sam ramble on and on, nodding occasionally to encourage him to continue.  It took about thirty minutes for Sam to wrap up his lecture on thunderbirds.
Dean looked around the room as if looking for more people.  “Well, probably because I wasn’t in it?”
“Yeah, night Bobby.”  Dean croaked out as he stood stiffly from the chair he’d been in for the last few hours.
He knew Sam often felt bad that Dean was expected to do so much for him.  Not that Dean had ever once complained.  Taking care of Sam was his job and it was one he had taken on willingly.  But, Sam wouldn’t be a Winchester if he didn’t take on the burden of responsibility for something he had no control over.  Dean knew that from personal experience.  Was Sam trying to protect him?  That seemed like a disgustingly self-sacrificing thing that he would do.
out of whack and it left him with a fuzzy head and cottonmouth.  He yawned and rubbed his fists against his crusty eyes.  He’d gotten too used to a regular sleep schedule while here and he was struggling because of it.
They stayed like that for a long time.  There weren’t any words that could comfort them, there wasn’t anything else to be said.  They were both dying, and it wouldn’t ever get any better.
Sam wrapped his arms tightly around Dean’s upper body to hold him in place.  His grip was strong enough that it caused Dean to cough in discomfort until he loosened his hold slightly.  Dean was pleased, despite the fact that he couldn’t breathe, to know that Cas had gone above and beyond to heal his brother.
Dean could feel himself shaking.  However he had expected this conversation with Sam to go, this wasn’t anywhere close to it.  He didn’t have any words to respond.  What the fuck could he even say?!  “Cheer up!  Sure you can ask her out!  It’s not so bad!”  Those were fucking lies!  What the fuck did he tell his baby brother to make him feel better?  Dean felt bile rise in his throat and he swallowed to try and urge it back down.
“Don’t be a bitch, put some hustle on it.”  Dean snapped back as they angled their way down the stairs.
There was a long silence between the two of them before Dean broke it with a soft request.  “Promise you’ll take care of him.”
Dean’s mouth tightened into a thin line.  He knew he wasn’t likely to get a straight answer, but he still wasn’t happy about it.  His hands were still buried in the large secondary feathers of Cas’s wings and he made no attempt to remove them.  “Well?”  Dean prompted when Cas fell silent again.
“I don’t speak Spanish!”  He yelled back at her.  He dove to the side and away from her, but into a fallen wooden beam.  He groaned in pain and gripped the beam with one hand and the floor with the other.  His hand came into contact with a degraded rosary on the floor and he lifted it in confusion.
He nabbed the salt from his bag and dumped it on top of the rosary.  He fumbled awkwardly with the matches in his hand but before he was able to light one, the ghost of the nun was back.  She knocked into him from behind and he dropped his pipe and the matches in his hand.  He staggered forward but managed to keep his feet under him.
“You hungry, old timer?  I’m making burgers tonight!”  Dean said, a casual smirk on his face.  The change in him was sudden and it made Bobby more suspicious than ever.  He didn’t comment on Dean’s behavior though.  One of Bobby’s best and worst traits was that he didn’t harass you for information.  So, Dean marked another box off his to-do list and they ate a final dinner together as a family.
He waited a moment, but no attack came. He gulped nervously before lowering his arms from his face. The sound of shuffling feathers came to his ears. A fucking bird?!
They lapsed into silence for a bit, only the sounds of the wind and Bobby turning patties in the air.
The two of them hugged one another tightly for a moment before Dean jumped back in excitement, his joy still evident on his face.
Dean was startled at the man’s reaction, even more so when John crossed the space between them in several large strides and pulled him into a crushing hug.  He was still for all of a moment before he allowed himself to hug the man back.  He’d always wanted this type of affection from his father, but it had been hard to come by when he was younger.  Guess all he needed to do for John’s love was go missing and be presumed dead for a while, who knew?
Dean used a large knife to cut all of his vegetables and the chicken into bite-sized pieces.  It took a few attempts of trial and error before he was able to figure out how to work the “ovens”.  One was larger than the other and had an open face, presumably to function like a stovetop.  It took a little working, and Castiel had to light the fire for him, which was embarrassing, but he managed eventually.
Secondly, Cas's design is based on a harpy eagle.  It's a large carnivore that is native to Central and South America.  They generally aren't more than 4 feet tall, but Cas is obviously much, much larger for story purposes.
A reader kindly asked me on the last chapter a couple of questions that I had apparently forgotten to address!
Sam made an attempt to intercept his father before he was able to approach Cas to closely but was brushed off by a furious swipe from John.
“You know that everything I do is for you boys.  Now, I shouldn’t have raised my voice before, but I was worried Dean.  You make me worry and that causes me to get a little heated.  You’re so strong-headed and stubborn that it drives me to fits sometimes.  I know you did what you did to try and help your brother and that was good, that was real good Dean.  But…”
Castiel looked at him placidly, as if he hadn’t just caused Dean to nearly piss himself in terror.  Dean blinked at the large bird a few times before he straightened his posture.
Instead, he turned to look at his brother, who was still lying peacefully on his bed.  Dean exhaled loudly and watched in trepidation as Castiel extended that same long primary feather towards his sleeping brother.  Dean almost stepped forward to stop him, but held himself back through sheer force of will.  He had asked for this he had to remind himself.
Bobby gave him a strange look but put his hand comfortingly on Dean’s shoulder.  “Of course I will, Dean.  I’ll take care of both of you, always.”
It hurt Castiel to keep Dean from his family, and he longed to tell Dean that it was only temporary.  He was bound by the terms of his curse though and he physically COULDN’T tell Dean that his confinement would be over in another six months.  He could only hope that they both could manage until that time.
Dean all but shouted in his head.  He stood quickly to get himself more water and nearly slammed the glass back on the table once he returned.  He still had yet to look at Cas, but he could feel the bird’s bizarre blue eyes on him the entire time.  He refused to look up though.  He’d wrapped his anger around himself like a familiar coat and now that it was on, it wouldn’t come off for a while.
He stood furiously and pointed an accusatory finger at his brother.  “I wasn’t allowed to leave and I wasn’t allowed to contact you!  There were rules and conditions to this healing thing.  And you know what, I did this for you, you little shit!  I had no idea what I was walking into, I was sure I was going to be some sex slave for Big Bird.  I’d resigned myself to that because he’d promised to heal you.  And you know what, I’d agree to it again!  Seeing you now, I don’t feel bad AT ALL!  So sorry your feelings got hurt, but you can use your fucking dinner plate sized hands and Hulk Hogan arms to wipe away your tears!”
Sam, like a coward, didn’t offer further explanation.  He simply stepped aside to reveal Dean’s smaller form from behind him.  Dean shot an angry side eye at his brother before offering a sheepish wave to his surrogate father.  “Hey, Bobby.”  He said weakly.
