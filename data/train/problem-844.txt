He slung his calf over the taller man’s leg, hooking their knees together. John looked down at his love, head in his hand, wounded shoulder supporting his weight. He knew he wouldn't last in this position for long, but he savored the moments that physio and therapy had bought him. Paid for with a new patience for the limits of his own form, somehow loaned to him by the single most impulsive person he knew.
"Nonsense, Sherlock. You've entertained her for.." John checked his phone and practically leapt out of the chair. "hours! I'm so sorry." He scooped the youngster out of Sherlock's hold. "I'll feed her and after lunch she and I can take a little lie down together."
“Do you play anything, Dada?”
Watson sighed. Sherlock nodded. He was ready.
They arrived at their door, and the family left the soft darkness for the warmth and light they knew would greet them above. Together.
Sherlock drank in the sight of the man. That amber hair appearing platinum-gold to Sherlock's eyes in the noon-touched air.  The lips that parted into a smile. The eyes lit up with gratitude and promise. The hands opening, effortlessly gifting Sherlock's own
A knocking at the window startled him. Wild black curls, wide bright eyes. His limber flatmate leaned palms against the car, bowing his height to peer in at John.
“She’s not sleeping, she’s here.”
"Are you two fighting?"
"He can sing, dear. Perhaps we can come to him. Let's think about a piece we could play to accompany his voice." She nodded sleepily. John beside them smiled, the warmth in his heart slowing his steps to encourage this moment to last.
He ached for an opportunity to correct some misapprehensions, while trying desperately not to think about more.
Martha made a valiant attempt to not beam at the man. The bloom of crimson that took the place of the pleasant pink flush on John's cheeks and neck told her she'd likely not quite succeeded. "Oh. A quiet night together. The two of you."
"Anything," John gasped.
He'd deflected their concern with contempt and even made it through the harrowing process of making the Best Man's Speech by a mixture of speaking the plain truth as he saw it and dipping into unvarnished sentiment. He'd fulfilled their inexplicable desire to feel sad at what they all went to such pains to say was a happy occasion. None had seen the true depths of his fear and anxiety.
John. Awkward John. Perfectly able to do it, he'd said. I don't need your help.
The girl was lying on her back, breathing in and out evenly and gently.
John turned to face Sherlock, folding his right leg up on the couch between them. Sherlock was pleased to see that he did not drop his hand. "Okay, I think we need some ground rules here. No deflecting by talking about past relationships."
Sherlock hesitated. John waited.
"And also, Bee, he's extremely intelligent."
John realized that he was looking at the two people most dear to him in the world. His treasure unhidden, laid bare by the press of fear in his veins. The hand of night drew the veil back from what he could never admit to himself fully in the light of day.
Saturday 19:32
John stood, clunking the glass down. He shook his head again and stumbled around the square table. Sherlock came to meet him. John's hands grasped the musician's upper arms. His eyes beseeching. His voice strangely dry and hoarse.
Then John was abruptly awake. His leg fallen off the bed. His body tangled in sheets. His body covered in cold sweat.
sSerlock, you are not allwed to leave
"John?" Sherlock hovered at the doorway to the kitchen. His voice was as uncertain as John could remember hearing it. An unfamiliar note. "Are you all right? I can...I can put the lights up. I can call Mrs. Hudson if you'd rather."
"Lasho, Timișoara?" Holmes recalled that Tawni had a Swabian girlfriend, Ecaterina, and asked her to translate his request.
Sherlock gave a grateful nod and snuggled Rosie closer. The girl peered out beyond him and smiled brightly.
As he walked home after dinner with Mrs. Hudson, the pulse of each step tempted him to take the turn to John's sturdy little house. To climb up his steps, to beat on his door, to beg him to listen. To lay his head on the man's lap and tell him how he'd missed hearing the sound of his breath. Tell him how he couldn't himself breathe thinking he might never see John's eyes light up again with mischievous glee. How he woke most nights gripping the sheets
And Mary. But her because of me.
Sherlock had escaped the affluent suffocation of his parents' country home only to get mired with a parade of antagonists and bystanders at University.  Strangely the active abuses he'd suffered at the hands of his peers had mellowed in memory to a wan scar, visible but painless. Lessons learned. But recollections of passive witness to his repeated humiliations continued to rankle. From pitying to blase to gleeful, but free from guilt or blame in their own minds. Infuriating. Chance contact with these wounds burned still.
“You’re leaving me alone?” Some fear entered her voice.
"Mmmmm. Yes. Huh?"
A lightning strike of adrenaline pulsed through the ex-soldier. He scrambled to his feet, grabbing at his sandals and pulling Sherlock up behind him. They hurled themselves at the water’s edge, just in time to see the group meet the line where the seamless inky water became dappled with spots of light. Ghostly blue tumbling and floating beyond. The night illumined by a galaxy of submerged silver-teal stars. Piers limned by bobbing lanterns of gold. John and Sherlock called out, but their words were drowned by the splashing of their footsteps in the deepening flow.
But Sherlock wasn't done. "John..." John stopped on the stair and turned to face Sherlock. The detective stood, looking grave, hands clasped. Looking down at her, John judged that Rosie was well out on his shoulder already. This was as good a time for them to get some discussion in as any. There was still so much more to work out.
Two violinists stood in the center of the ring of musicians. A tall bass plucked to a steady rhythm underlay the sharp staccato refrain of accordion keys. Sherlock recognized a cimbalom, similar to the hammered dulcimer, played by a seated man.  A vast flock of bright twinned chimes shook free beneath his hands. As Holmes watched, the violinists caught afire. Heads close, eyes locked, they interwove swift flying notes. One wearing a dark cap looked through half-lidded eyes and swiveled his head slightly in time, his shoulders loosening even as the bow in his hand seemed to swoop faster of its own accord. A feral grin lit on the other violinist's face as he followed in the wake of his partner, pacing this ascent with gliding counterpoint. His eyes found those of the other band members and as one they stilled. The entranced violinist punched through this window and carried the whole room straight up to the the stratosphere.
"Sigur? Will? How did the class go?" Mummy's flowing voice spills out from the living room. Will wipes a tear from his cheek and stays silent. He stealthily heads away from her direction, entering the kitchen and making for a door that backs onto the garden and woodlands beyond. He pelts out into the sunshine. The feel of grass beneath his feet relieves some of the pounding tension in his chest immediately.
He runs on, entering the woods. Crisp leaves crunch underfoot. The rich smell of humus enters his nose. The sound of water rushing comes to him and his footsteps lead unthinking and unerringly to the streamside. Not breaking his stride he leaps, his hands catching hold on a branch.  He pulls himself upwards, wriggling first one leg then both and then his whole body up onto the sturdy branch. The tree shakes as he clambers higher. He settles on a wide level bough. A black and white flag crossed with skull and bones hangs from a branch beside him. It flutters in a light breeze that tagged along with him beneath the canopy.
Mrs. Hudson stuck her head through the door. No such luck. She knew that would have been too good to be true.
next to Regent's Park in London. [
It is several weeks later. The violin has lain on the bench long enough to get in Mycroft's way. When Will sullenly refuses to answer questions about whether he is going to use it again, it is placed in the hall closet along with skis, a fishing pole and a set of jigsaw puzzles that only appear during the most rainy of summer days.
“Bias?”
“You’re not, dear one. Well, we all are. Hm. Let’s set that question aside for a time when we can talk about that with your Dada as well. Let me summarize. What we’ve done already is to explore the observation you had today: 'Dada does not read music.' Your investigatory question is, ‘Why?’ Now let’s look at the assumptions you’ve made. This will help us supply an example for you to learn the methods from.”
But with Rosie there, nights were different for Sherlock. John thought he found a purpose in it. On nights when John woke and joined them, he noticed a fullness that though mundane was somehow more substantial than the adrenaline-laced intensity of days past. Something different fed his detective's hungers now. Gentler. But to John it seemed as engrossing of Sherlock's attention. He had become a bottomless well of curiosity and care.
"This isn't going to be like after your wedding again is it?"
"Seduction through that giant brain of yours. Poor Molly never had a chance."

The Banat is a divided region, spanning Romania, Hungary and Serbia. Founded in the 9th century (CE) as a frontier province of the Bulgarian Empire ruled by a military governer or "Ban." Later controlled by the Ottoman Empire, then Austro-Hungarian Empire and briefly had independence (for two whole weeks!) after World War I ended. The unofficial capital is the largest city, Timișoara in Romanian. [
Some agonizing
disgust out with a mouthful of toothpaste. He piled on layers of armor against regret for the friendship his thoughtless desire had discarded, with each button fastened, and each brushstroke in his hair.
"You wanted to play something tonight. I'm sorry I scuppered your plans," the doctor said, helping his daughter get a good grip on the bottle.
“Thank you for being here, John. Thank you for everything.” His eyes swept across the flat, took in the paperwork they’d filled out together.
Sherlock lifted John's hand to his lips and kissed a stray knuckle. Then settled his chin back down, closing his eyes.
Back to the inventory. Second, John Watson took up space. Despite arriving first to the flat and intentionally spreading his belongings as far and as wide as he could manage, Sherlock had still left corners and places where John made his presence felt.
John started breathing again. "Amazing. Of course, Bee. She did." Rosie lit up.
Mrs. Hudson smiled at the dreamy little face. “Yes, dear, something like that.”
Medical reference texts and lurid adventure novels shouldered their way into the bookshelf stacks amidst Sherlock's chemistry tomes and notebooks. John's laptop had several habitual resting places now, migrating from coffee table to kitchen to chair seat. John's medical kit enjoyed pride of place near the door to the hall. Polished and ready for action. Its gleam reflecting (Sherlock was convinced, evidence free) a sparkle newly re-lit in its owner's eye.
"No," John said heatedly from his place on the ground, his shirt half unbuttoned, his legs akimbo and abruptly kicking for freedom. "No, you do not get to laugh at me after the day I've had."
Sherlock smiled, not looking. "Of course. More than that. Wherever you are, the knowing that we've found the solution. We've cracked the code on some small part of the greater evil in the world. And even more than that, John." He opened his eyes and gazed at his friend. "I've done this for longer than I've known you. And alone at times even then." He shook away the wisps of pain. Old frost stood to melt in the light of a new day. "But the joy I've experienced in sharing it with you. And now, having Watson be part of that world we're defending." His eyes slipped closed in a mixture of feelings both painful and sweet. Then he sat up straight in the chair and looked fondly over at the two of them, and continued, "I'd no idea about her at the time, when first I heard the song I wished to play for you tonight. As I said earlier, it touched me. There were two violinists and their rapport reminded me of ours." He made a gesture connecting the two of them. "It was transcendent." One shoulder shrugged. "It wouldn't be the same, but still I wanted to bring you there somehow."
The exception had been the waltz. The damn music. His heart was too entwined in it. He could never lie to John with music. All he could do was obfuscate and deflect, so he'd done that masterfully. Approach, not retreat. He had to give him the waltz. Then he had to teach John to dance.
Sherlock stood, holding Rosie. Taking the bag from Mrs Hudson he said, "On New Year's Eve, I want to play for John. I want to let him know how I feel." She nodded up at him in response and he continued. "Would you mind watching Watson that night, down here?"
"Wait, you've had past relationships?"
"But I don't want to be treated like a child. Playing stupid games because I don't know any better."
we've spent so long apart, Sherlock. i you have to come back now and enjoy this n ight with us. i need you here sherlock.
Young Sherlock and his violin.
The group reaches a pause. Some stragglers clap a few beats behind. Others not following the written pattern continue until they realize the class has stopped. Will's hand shoots up into the air.
Sherlock undressed unthinking. Letting shirt and trousers fall where they would. He curled up naked under the sheets, feeling tender points on his neck and breast. Touching his sensitive lips, allowing himself to be dazed and bemused. His confidence before John was more than partly show. The rapture of the full reveal of John's emotions, and the glory of his touch had far surpassed his greatest hopes for the evening. Care, and esteem, and love, and even desire. How could he contain the joy. How could he believe that John loved him in every way he might have longed for.
She touched his cheek softly. "Dear boy. You know you're the only son I'll ever have, don't you?" She lingered in silence for a moment, then slapped him with no heat. "So stop this rubbish. Tell me what you're planning for your young man up there. I'm happy to watch sweet Rosie whenever you need." She stood up and began gathering up Rosie's things for him to take up stairs. "But do it quick, before John starts to worry that we're conspiring with you staying down here so long."
"That is a possibility."
The talking inside the room remained low. She heard laughter once or twice.
Sherlock opened CCTV stills from outside the Baker Street flat. In one Mrs Hudson sweeps the walk. Another shows John sitting at a table in front of Speedy's with an attractive woman his age. (
Sherlock’s eyes lingered on the dear girl. “And she’s lost her Nanna.” Sherlock looked up at John with fresh heartbreak in his eyes. “Having you move back in was selfish. You’ve both already lost so much.”
"Oh, yes, let me fill in that picture. Your
"I'll be along. Just a moment more."
John looked a bit stunned. "You're asking..."
Pulling the blonde man roughly against him, Sherlock ruthlessly plundered his mouth. He felt John's hands rove across his arse and was encouraged to do as his urges led. He moved off John's lap, scooching back along the couch and landing between John's legs. A guttural sound from John--expressing his disapproval at the increased distance between them--was cut off abruptly as Sherlock laid his hand on the buckle of John's belt.
What the violin couldn't say.
"And you came to that yourself, my dear," he said as he set her back down. "Now, you have your lists. But I have one more question to ask you before we move on. This will require to you to consult your own experience again. And I’m happy to provide supporting information if you’d like. The question is: can your Dada read music?"
Reaching the small grey wooden structure, Andreea shouldered the basket containing apples, cheese, bread and milk. And a package marked Wilhelm Sigorescu which her guest had been awaiting.  He would surely be on his way again soon. She spared a thought to send a prayer winging skyward on his behalf. That he might find his fortune, and his heart find ease.
John was putting another layer of Rosie’s thick winter socks on. They’d planned to take an early walk and let her run about in the snowy park. He stopped his cheerful greeting at the sight of Sherlock’s expression. Eyes wide and forehead soft with concern, he wordlessly questioned his friend.
Golden points twinkled, reflected in the lustrous wood. Lamps lit as the day dimmed to dusk and darkness. Eager hands had transformed the reception hall. Rolling aside tables where the guests had sat, first in delight, then suspense and on through deep embarrassment as he'd wrested control of the narrative to navigate through the fatefully eventful day.
A bow knocks into the back of Will's head. He turns and sees the dark haired girl with braids still behind him. She is looking at the teacher. He resumes his pretend bowing and gets bumped in the back of the head once more. Soft snickering comes from nearby throats. Will does not turn again, but instead moves a step forward hoping to be out of reach.
"Good, little Bee. All breaks are there to help you get what you need. Maybe it's a breath, or to start a new note. Sometimes it's so that you are quiet while someone else is playing or singing. Sometimes it's so that everyone will listen better to what they just heard. And sometimes, Bee, sometimes, it's so that you and everyone else you are playing with will start again, together. Sometimes we have to stop what we are doing, to start again, in the right way. Does that make sense, little Bee?"
When John spoke, it was with a lilt of affectionate humor in his voice. “This far enough away from your brother now, love?”
Sherlock spoke up. “Watson is exploring her knowledge of musicians in the family.”
“No, Rosie. She did try, when she was at Uni. She was actually in a punk band, singing. She tried to pick up the bass, but it just didn’t take. Why?”
is not here." He came close and laid a gentle hand on John's arm. John could only imagine what expression must be on his own face.
"There is a secret about all pauses. Can I tell you now? Will you remember?" Little limbs shifted and a head shook itself awake, her hair batting lightly against his own.
He raced into the open, bent low making as small a target as possible. Pulling up behind an overturned cart he could finally see them. Three ISAF
John started up the film again. He reluctantly put his hand back into his lap. Sherlock's feet squirmed a moment, digging deeper beneath John's leg. The man pulled his silky dressing gown closer about him. Not looking directly over at his flatmate, John pulled down the afghan they had folded on the back of the sofa and tossed half over to Sherlock, keeping one end on his lap.
"These are the ones I know, Papa!" John sat in his chair, touching one she'd placed nearby to him with a single finger. The faint smile on his lips belied the deep gleam of satisfaction in his eyes.  Sherlock remained silent. Waiting.
"You all ready to play?"
Swabians are historical German inhabitants of Eastern Europe who were recruited to colonize the region during the 17th century to strengthen Austrian foothold in war-torn former Turkish-held regions. Variously fought for both sides in the WWII, with communities and individuals participating in as well as objecting to atrocities. Expelled from Romania under Communist rule. Descendants return to this region as economic factors allow. Fluent in German, Sherlock is using this background as a plausible cover. [
The look Sherlock gave to Rosie at this moment made John rethink all his assumptions about Sherlock and expression of feeling. A spectrum of love and fear and tenderness and determination were all on display. John closed his own eyes momentarily at the well of feeling this brought up in him in return. Sherlock took a breath and his face cleared. If he'd not seen it himself, John would never have guessed this was more than an idle conversation.
Sherlock turned abruptly, his elbows now balanced on the rail behind him. John gazed at his dark silhouette. The unearthly light of the jellies gave him a broken, shifting halo.
“Uncle My didn’t have music when we played.
, Sherlock texted to John along with some other choice exchanges with Anderson from the briefing. But so far he'd gotten only the barest of responses. Sherlock tried not to be too demanding of a partner, god knew John had put up with several lifetimes worth of too much in their time together. But the detective still found himself getting anxious when he knew John was potentially in danger—when he couldn't be beside him. Despite the fact that the last place Sherlock should be was the busy A&E ward that John had been assigned as his station during the all hands on deck call for first responders, he felt a constant pull. Sherlock's perfect recall informed him that his heart rate had been lower when John stood beside him wrapped in a vest full of semtex, than in the long moments between sending his text that evening and when the laconic laughing face emoji and "xx" came in return.
Martha was up on her feet by the time she heard the sound of John's sturdy, measured step upon the treads. When a polite yet insistent knock sounded on her own door she was close enough to open it before the last rap had sounded. Her startled tenant stood there with his adorable daughter strapped to his chest. John Watson withdrew his hand from the air awkwardly. The other held a brightly colored animal-themed baby travel bag Molly had gifted to him.
"Sherlock." The detective set John's shoes aside and was now yanking at his trousers as though they had offended him. "Sherlock," John repeated.
John moved his hand to stroke Sherlock's hair once more, ghosting it down his brow and cheek now and again. Eventually he spoke.
“Anything else you need to know now?”
sautillé
"So, John. You, as I recall, had wanted us to talk, this evening?" Sherlock played lazily with John's hair. His beloved friend's face was buried in his chest. Clothing sorted, they now lay with bodies fully entangled across Sherlock's side of the couch. John's blistering climax had surprised them both with its volume and emotional impact. Sherlock blinked away the remnants of tears as he held John's finally calmed body in his arms.
“Who?”
John shook his head lightly, listening.
“Exactly.”
John is moving back to 221B Baker Street, with Rosie. Mary is gone. He is adapting to single parenthood. His relationship with Sherlock is healing. And things are actually better than they've ever been. But John has some catching up to do.
“Anyone else?”
You are inebriated. The guests have begun leaving, but there are still 42 members of the party who are not likely to depart for another three hours, John. And the majority of them are under 50 like yourself and Mary, so you have plenty of people to share in the festivities with. By my calculations, you'll be well engaged until at least 23:00 hours, after which you and Mary can begin the customary sex holiday you've been planning on celebrating.
Mrs. Hudson saw a look of yearning cross John’s face.
"Come, Watson. Give us your thoughts. Remember what I said. You're plenty strong." At that, John gave his detective a look askance, but his daughter giggled and started speaking.
"And you can join a smaller group of students if you'd like. Find learners at your level so you can look to them for support and you can help them. Being there with little kids and big kids seemed to confuse you. You weren't sure quite how to interact with either group."
The men shared a glance. Sherlock pointed with his chin and John nodded affirmation. They shifted and switched places, the taller man edging as close as he dared to the ring of jellies. The short solid soldier followed and grasped his beloved firmly by the waist. Anchoring his hands to the fine leather belt there, its smooth black surface mottled and ruined by the brackish water.
On nights most bitter and most sweet, John woke. A kaleidoscope of emotions: surprise, hazy confusion, concern, relief, calm. This occurred just often enough to send the detective's heart beating fast when he heard a deeply intaken breath. This could signal waking. Seeing John's eyes open brought answering warmth to Sherlock's chest. Even, delight. But the goal was for the man to rest. This outcome was to be avoided. Yet the insatiable pull the lethargic soldier's sleep-loose body held over Sherlock's own was magnified by the intimacy of the hour.
He woke to the smell of toasted cheese sandwiches and tomato soup. The fire had been tended. A fresh glass of water sat on the table near him. He heard quiet chatting, burbles and the occasional childish yet distinct syllable. She'd be talking before she could crawl if things kept going this way.
John was sorely tempted to chuck a bog roll at Sherlock's head.
But still, this moment's openness meant even more than the hours spent building furniture and adapting the flat. John locked it away as a treasured memory. With quiet nights between cases. With sharing the stars. With learning to dance in his arms.
Enjoy your party. You don't need me. - SH
Intense blue-green eyes meet the older man's at last. "But they were so good!" he bursts out. "They could just play, and I screeched horribly." He reaches out and grabs the teacher's sleeve, bow still in hand. "I can do much better than that. I practiced so hard to get ready for that class. But then I was so bad, and none of it made sense. And you said I should go away."
They play the Schubert together. Then a piece by Bach. Will asks Mr Shadid to teach him a song from his home. The cadence is different than what he's played before. There is a longing in the music that speaks to the young man.
Sherlock had jumped at the first crash. He was now kneeling on the bed, his face ashen. By the time the books hit the floor, John had called out and was running towards the door. After he stepped through, Mrs. Hudson left the teetering frame and hurried to the door.
John shuddered, "You are merciless." Then he pulled his friend into a fierce kiss. "Don't you dare stop."
The raw lust in John's eyes made a verbal response unnecessary. But the detective found himself pinking with gratification at John's harshly breathed, "Brilliant," nonetheless.
Sufficiently healed for travel. - SH
Leaving was easier than she'd thought it might be. But there was just one more thing that needed doing.
John lifted his head just enough to give Sherlock a look. "My gorgeous bastard." He flopped down heavily again and nestled in closer. "You talk," came through, a bit muffled.
"Ah. And I put you off."
A deduction unlocked by a certain look in his flatmate's eyes. When John handed Watson over for a very unromantic nappy change. It was complete trust. Complete contentment.
you know what i mean. i only get to have you in my life now for cases, and mad races to the NSY, and rescuing you from hospital when you get shot because you didn't bother to tell me you were going somewhere dangerous.
"What am I missing out on, little one?" John asked his daughter. She reached out to touch her father's nose. He steadied the bottle for her.
"Yes! Exactly." Putting his arms around her, he gave the girl a hug and lifted her off her feet, swinging her in a circle gently. Rosie laughed in delight.
“And he’s not watching over me, now?”
Mrs. Hudson had seen Sherlock in many moods: obsessed, intrigued, remote, distraught, strung out. Even affectionate, as he was with her and so few else, she knew. But the solid excitement and bounce he'd shown since this young doctor had stepped into his life was new.
Oh! You mean when you taught me to dance? That barely counts.
Sherlock thought.
He began to play the piece again. This would be the last run through before he played it for John. Watson's eyes were drooping. Soon he would return her upstairs and Sherlock himself would retire. The flat would return to the sweet embrace of a full, loving silence.
A year on and the spell Sherlock’s touch still spun made John wonder at the truth of it all. Shifting his body to relieve his shoulder, his lower hand snaked around Sherlock’s neck. He came to rest leaning on the man’s slim chest. Running a hand up Sherlock's bicep, John arched his neck. Lazily planting a string of kisses down that cheek to the line of dark curls. He bit lightly at Sherlock’s ear, smiling to himself as he felt the warm body shudder beneath him. “John,” Sherlock moaned, louder now.
"Sherlock, so you want Rosie to be as good as you are at the violin?"
Arrangements for transport may be difficult to make discretely.
Sherlock wants to share his feelings with John. How else but through music? John has other ideas.
A slow pulse in the afternoon. The depths of green dark and deep are broken by the curl of lace, and patient slip of living, molten glass. The swell above, wind tossed and ancient. The hush below, pregnant and layered.
John placed his hand under Sherlock's arm, between back and couch. Sherlock touched John's neck, his fingers fluttering down then clutching. John rested his other hand lightly on Sherlock's cheek. Thumb stroking chin as John clung to Sherlock's gaze. The detective's free hand came to rest on John's chest. Faces grew nearer, jaws relaxed and lips opened. John closed his eyes, homing to Sherlock's mouth. Sherlock's eyes remained open. Taking in each singular shade, each glimmering hair, each vulnerable line. Only closing when their lips touched. His fingers rose and gripped John's shirt, pulling him closer. His lips applied more pressure, then opened. Welcoming the traveler home at last.
John looked about to ask for more details, but stopped at the slight shake of the head Sherlock gave him. Instead the doctor launched into a tale of skinny dipping in the reservoir near his secondary school, which involved an enthusiastic German shepherd and an explanation of the dangers of climbing pine trees while naked. John enjoyed the laughter of his friends as well as the pleased and grateful glance his lover shot him for changing the subject.
They broke into the hamper and soon were consoled with salads, fruit and chicken enough for all. Sherlock plucked out a hard boiled egg, removing the shell meticulously.  The midday call to prayer from the nearby London Central Mosque rang out as they ate and rested.
It all became more than John could process. He closed his eyes and leaned in to the hand that Sherlock had left resting on his upper arm. The burden of the past came rushing in. The relief so strong. Sherlock continued talking, reassuring John, explaining himself. John couldn't open his eyes or make the effort to speak. He just felt the warm hand on his arm and felt whole for the first time in forever.
"Yes. Correct."
Harry play an instrument?”
“Thank you, Little Bee. And you as well, though it is still developing. I can add information that is not available to you. I know for a fact that Chief Inspector Lestrade cannot read music.”
Martha, leaned against the stove, weakly turning the heat off and wiping her eyes. "Oh Sherlock. John was just telling me about your case. I just can't--"
"But I can't play as well as the older kids. I'm..bad at it." Will wipes off silent tears.
He glanced at the clock and calculations rushed unbidden to his mind. One hundred seventeen hours and forty-seven minutes since he had last seen John. Through a haze of bees, backing away with that travesty of a smile on his face. Apologizing to Sherlock for bothering him. Practically tripping in his haste to get away. Ignoring the increasingly frantic pleas Sherlock made for John to listen to him, to let him explain.
All week he'd been dreaming about Sherlock's birthday. Thinking out how it would go, what he would do, what he would say. Imagining the first moment he touched Sherlock's hand with intent. Imagining what it might feel like to have his arms around the man and know he didn't have to let go. Seeing those eyes closer than ever before. Feeling his breath warm in the darkness. Feeling the skin of their chests meet for the first time. Tasting the salt of him.
"I'm not sure I'm ready to move on yet." John captured Sherlock's lips again with his and gave a long leisurely wordless argument against whatever it was Sherlock was about to do. The detective's body found this argument quite convincing, and he pulled John close once more. He gave a guttural sigh as John's hand threaded into dark curls. Sherlock devoured, his tongue invading and enticing in turn.
Suddenly John had to speak. Urgently. He raised himself on an elbow, ignoring twinges of pain, and peered over at Sherlock.
The day after Christmas dawned cheerfully at 221A Baker Street. Martha Hudson woke with the light. She rolled over and dreamily watched drifts of snow accumulate on the sash. Stretching luxuriously under the duvet, she smiled to herself.
Gracious. She brought him a gift! That lipstick.. He's not going to say something - oh crumbs.
Sherlock nodded over the instrument. He paused a moment.
Lifting the instrument he placed it on his shoulder. With a gentle, professional grip, Sherlock clung to the life raft that was the neck of his violin.
The music in this chapter was inspired by the Romanian band Taraf de Haïdouks. This whole story was basically inspired by a scene from the French film Latcho Drom, about the immigration of Romani people from India to Europe over many centuries. The film consists of musical vignettes, including this heart wrenching song about the dictator Nicolae Ceaușescu by the world renowned violinist Nicolae Neacșu:
“Sweetheart. That’s an almost never used notation. You don’t have to worry about playing that fraction of a note now, or perhaps ever.” He put his own instrument back into its case. Turned to his daughter and tugged the violin gently from her hands. She resisted for a moment, the ghost of a full Watson huff clouding her eyes briefly. Then a tired little girl looked out of the familiar blue. He pulled her up into his arms and brought them both over to his chair by the fireplace. He sat down and settled her on his lap. She leaned against him, his arms around her. He felt the focused energy that had brought her and him through the long, early morning begin to dissipate, and her slight frame melted cozily against his own.
Twin furrowed brows and expressive frowns told John he might have made a mistake.  The affronted cry of his child and an aggressive lean out of his arms in the direction of his flatmate made sure he understood the degree of his crime. He attempted to juggle Rosie for a moment, shushing her and trying to comfort. Then he realized it was a lost cause and surrendered her to the now ever so slightly smirking detective.
John settled Rosie amidst the chunky black white and gold bumblebees decorating the bouncy chair they had purchased for Mrs Hudson's convenience.  The girl's sky blue eyes peered around at the familiar surroundings. John gave her a fond smile and tousled her short golden waves with his hand. "No, I sent him on to secure a car, and make some other arrangements, while I asked you for a favor--"
Sherlock watched his daughter as he sought words to address the many challenges this small person took on, all the winding paths and dead ends he saw before her. As well as open roads and vast horizons. In true Watson fashion, she surprised him before he could begin.
"This isn't the right time to be chatty, little bee. Don't grow up to be like your Uncle Sherlock," the detective chided the girl with a voice full of affection. He rose to warm a bottle for her.
Now John hesitated. "It's not personal for you, is it?"
"Very well. Now let me get these pants off you."
"He really doesn't belong here," says Mr. Shadid quietly.
"What was that?"
John had no idea where he stood, no precedent to help him navigate this relationship, no map to help him have any idea where crossing this boundary might land him. Back in the trash heap of abandonment and despair he'd been in before he met Sherlock. A bare year separated the energized, challenged, typically overwhelmed but always fascinated self that now walked the streets of London, from the husk of a man he'd been. Clutching his anger in one hand and his revolver in the other. Each day a question not even so much of how he would make it, but more when would his tenuous hold break. When would he let it go?
Oh! There he's back. And now they're off together. Thick as thieves.
“Correct. He can read chords, and he can play by ear.” A quizzical expression. "He listens and can reproduce melodies but without using notes on the stave." He watched her taking that in, nodded and went on, "So here we have that second form of investigation, Bee. You take an assumption about the world and apply it to individuals that seem to relate. But what does it tell you if you are wrong about the individuals whom you’ve made these assumptions about?"
, which made Sherlock smile thinking of the pleasure this would have brought to his own teacher.
heartbeat back to him with an easy gesture of welcome.
By habit, he counted John's footsteps sounding a path with Watson up to their room. The tread was a bit slow. At least he knew John was as reluctant to let the night end as he was.
played the oboe when he was younger, but lost the habit and doesn’t own an instrument. However, he retains the knowledge."
"What is it John?"
Her eyes went wide. "You. And Dada." She looked at John, her eyes taking on the thousand mile stare he'd seen so many times on his husband's face. "You and
She leaned back and looked up at her silver-haired parent. "You cannot read music. But you wanted to help me learn. And so you learned enough to make those blocks. And now, you don't play, or sing with music, but you remember what you learned. Like
"You think so? We know it's likely not a serious interest, but it had seemed that he'd shown a little promise."
John ate some more popcorn. He felt Sherlock watching him. Alan Rickman made his entrance. John stopped focusing on what Sherlock was doing, or thinking about.
"Well, thanks."
"Now, now, John. No deflection with insults was your rule."
"Of course."
John closed his eyes, shaking his head in regret and shame. "So much time wasted." He felt Sherlock's finger on his lips. Capturing it and biting gently, he opened his eyes to see Sherlock's eyelids lower full and sated.  John ran his mouth down the line of the index finger and planted a kiss on the center of his detective's palm. He felt Sherlock's limbs melt against his own.

For a moment, she heard the world through his ears, and saw the room from his eyes. The smell of shampoo and rosin rang like a bell. Sherlock’s pale skin glimmered like a beacon. John’s heart pulsed with fear and hope.
Sherlock's eyes were full of pride, but he said, "Careful, Bee. Watch the assumptions. I played violin for you at night, but my mother never did that."
“Don’t forget ‘gives mind-blowing head,’” Sherlock added cheekily, despite his crimson face and wry grin.
Moving Rosie carefully and deliberately, they re-occupied the couch. She rested between them. Sherlock's arm went up along the couch back, around John.
"You know what I mean. It's a mercy you are taking this time off. If you hadn't I was considering one of those, interventions on your behalf."
"With our Waltz?"
Bed springs? Were they sitting down together? Something more? A bit speedy for them if so. Would they make her (and each other) wait all this time, then get on with the shagging two seconds after someone trapped them alone together?
John licked his lips and his eyes met Sherlock's. "Yes?"
John's eyes leapt up to meet Sherlock's. Such an admission was not strictly unprecedented, but was passing rare. John looked bowled over by the words, but seemed to be willing to press his luck.
His father leans down and says in his ear, "Best see the lie of the land before piping up, my boy."
Being out walking had oddly cheered him. He looked up at the light of the moon and smiled to feel the sharp bite of the wind. He was out on this dark night, but even for such an unwanted trip as this, he couldn't stay angry long. Not when he had his child and family (y
“Demisemihemidemisemiquaver,”
John said, "I take it she has heard it already?" indicating Rosie. This provoked a smile out of Sherlock.
"That thing, what I say. You know."
"Not complaining," said Sherlock. He sat down on his chair.
But somehow, they do. A stack of tiny, proto moon jellies form on the aunty midwife polyp. Expand and grow and one day burst away from their tether. A pile, like puppies erupting, wild and wheeling. Eyeless and silent, sensing the light, their prey, the cold all in one. And eat, and grow and touch and shudder muted in the coursing mother sea.
making assumptions, make yourself aware of them as much as you can be—accept help doing so—and then critically examine those assumptions. Find external counsel you trust to help you. And you will be right much more than you would be otherwise. And perhaps much more than you are wrong."
Several years on. Summer holidays begin. Someone is busy.
Sherlock scoffed and headed out. John turned to Mrs Hudson and she was surprised by the urgency she saw on his face. It clearly was not about the bird, missing diamond or no.

They stilled at last, foreheads resting together. They exchanged words of love then. Quiet, simple and earnest.
Sherlock's room was much darker, naturally. Quieter, too. And those poncey sheets!
"Yes, all I'd done to him. And it nearly broke him." His voice was quiet. Martha saw his usual guards shifting back into place. She came to sit next to them on the couch and placed her hand on his where it lay on his lap. But she said nothing.
Your silence was troubling.
Auld lang syne flooded the airways. The song drifted out on the roadway, stuttering in and out of sync as they heard it from kitchen windows and car radios driving past. The sound of cheering and fireworks exploded in the distance. John and Sherlock shifted their bodies to fit together. Awkwardly trying to jostle spaces carefully misaligned for so long, to come into contact and merge. Geometries of emotion embattled with long practiced distance, and fear.
Sherlock continued to observe. He felt the texture of John's chest against his cheek. Watson was quiet in the monitor. But from the quality of the light in the window and the movements the child was beginning to make, Sherlock knew soon they would need to rise and attend. He welcomed it all.
An elaborate shaving table they'd been given as a quirky wedding present by Mycroft made the cut. It sat by the door holding keys and coins, never used to purpose. John almost abandoned it too, until he realized that the dark wood and Victorian styling would be just at home on Baker Street. It had never fit in among the fawn, cream and khaki snare of beige that was their family flat.
"If I must." Sherlock's eyes carried their own mischievous glimmer.
Am I safe?
Despite himself, Will's curiousity is piqued. "How?"
She gave John a level stare across the couch. "John, you don't have to mince words with me."
Small hands assembled and arranged the worn wooden blocks. Each a different pastel shade, the cubes' sides were decorated with hand-painted notes and other music-related symbols and whimsical adornments. They'd been covered with a once-glossy, clear lacquer that had been polished impossibly smooth from repeated use in some spots. In others it was crackled and split from one too many falls from atop a tower. She went through each side in turn, making a small mark on the chart next to those represented on the blocks.
Not only taking up physical space, but mental and emotional as well. Precious processing time each day was being dedicated to analyzing Watson's demeanor. Overall trends: improving. John took pride in insisting that the detective eat regularly. And so he ate, too. Sherlock provided expected, as well as truthful, resistance to this campaign but noted the bloom of color that visited and remained in his flatmate's cheeks. Sunken hollows evening out. Spare flesh filling in. A membership flyer for a local gym which Sherlock left oh so casually in a stack of advertisements on the coffee table was retrieved, considered and submitted. Sherlock's own regimen of fencing, rowing and running was uninterrupted but amended by shared weekend jogs that quickly became a staple of their easy interactions.
"But you can already read music, Bee." John's statement was a question.
"I'm sorry, John. It was my suggestion. Bee's trying to get her plans straight for learning musical notation and I thought this would be a good opportunity to do some more brainstorming."
"Is all forgiven now?" John asked, feeling calm retake his partner’s body and taking a chance that the deeper issues they’d skirted all evening could be broached at last.
"So, you want to help with Rosie, when she wakes?"
And then all that collapsed with his injury. Along with his prospects, his hope for love or pretty much anything. The independence he thought he'd built was a sham. His life was emptier than before.  He admitted the wreck he'd been when he met Sherlock. Not long for the world and not arsed to care.  All changed by an introduction, a deduction, an invitation and the crack of a gun.
Sherlock hooded his eyes in a curiously feline gesture of satisfaction. "What did she tell me, John?" he rumbled.
"Shhh.. I'm not done yet." She rolled her eyes, and both men chuckled. She glared at them until they stilled.
"Yes, you bloody well must. Now you were going to tell me when you realized you were in love with me, right?"
Along with the memories came a feeling of happiness. Connection. Scents and smells that reminded her of them. The roses in her mother’s garden. The expensive cigars her husband had loved when they were young and wild together. The gardenia scented perfume her sweetie in high school had worn.
He knew Sherlock would regret it when young Watson grew older and his late night stints were no longer necessary. He saw a shift in his friend. Nights had often been a time when Sherlock battled his darkest fears and strongest foes. John regretted that he could only follow so far. His own bodily needs, transport or otherwise, could not be denied. Despite his training as a soldier and a doctor, John skipped sleep begrudgingly, and when there was no other choice. But Sherlock seemed only to fall when he could hold off sleep no more. And then happily go without for days in the delight of a challenging case.
John reached the stranded child first, staggering through the thigh-high water. His arms wheeled as he stopped his forward momentum. He felt Sherlock’s hands on his shoulders, stabilizing him. The child whined in fear, holding their hurt hand to their chest. Encircled now entirely by the glowing beings.
John shook his head. He buried his face in Sherlock’s neck. Sherlock stroked his hair.
"Plus, you know I'm too dense to deduce it all. Please, humor this idiot and talk to me."
"Excellent, Watson. And let me ask you something else: why doesn't your Dada read music? You may not know exactly why, but you have some information here that may allow you to draw some well-informed conclusions about this as well."
They were not shagging. Not even snogging. But they were sitting on the bed together. Quite close together. And Sherlock was talking. And..
Sherlock huffed in response and rolled his eyes. The look in them still distant, his mouth a harsh line interrupted by teeth worrying that lush lower lip. John leaned down to steal a kiss and capture his lover’s attention. A moment’s care brought a puff of breath released, fluttering eyelids and a softening of lip and jaw. “John,” Sherlock whispered into his mouth.
"I'm sorry my prediction proved to be true," Sherlock said consolingly to his husband and child as they came back later, deflated, with kite and string in hand. "I rather wish I had been wrong."
First, there was a man living in his home. His home. A hard fought harbor of quiet in a life assailed by misunderstanding and vitriol.
"Who cares what they think. I still think you should eliminate that job and work full time with me."
"Just you."
“And you know he’s not been your doctor for years now. He’s just yours.”
"It's all right, Dada," said Rosie. "Papa is helping me to be stronger." Sherlock nodded. John looked at both of them, confused. Then his brow cleared. He put his arm around Rosie, and reached out to his husband.
"John."
It lingered in John's mind as he gathered their things in the low light. A candidate for perfect moments. Rosie happy, in her element. Finding old friends and making new acquaintances in a large group of children hopping from swing to slide. The timber fort, a series of wooden platforms and walkways, became frigate and brig in battles that left their Rosie flushed and excitably full of stories of derring do by her and her crew.
“Hey,” John waited until Sherlock met his eyes. “I wouldn’t be anywhere else. We wouldn’t be. We both loved her too and,” he hesitated, “what are friends for?” He smiled.
“It doesn’t matter. He’s an idiot.” But the warm arm pulled away. Sherlock leaned heavily against the rail. Bit his lower lip.
And, selfishly, as surrendering John to Mary's tender mercies was the sole path open to him, Sherlock aimed to eke out a place in his friend's life. Even if he was simply remembered as that odd housemate in time. John might say, "Sherlock may have been shite at feelings and nearly killed himself to spite villains despite knowing I'd never have agreed to let him head off into the hinterlands all alone, but he did do a good job as Best Man. He made sure we had a bang up wedding. Wonder what he's up to these days?"
"Geniuses can be idiots sometimes, too." Sherlock gave him a sharp look, his eyes narrowed in defense and surprise. John shook his head. "Not you." He gave a rueful grin, eyes following the curve formed where the slender calf met the long, graceful foot beneath his hand. "I mean, 'Mycroft' and 'Sherlock?' What on earth would they have done with a girl?"
But John stayed in the chair. Brushing the salt tears away, and began the first of many calls.
"Oh." Sherlock's eyes widened fractionally. "I'm so sorry. I never thought you would wake. You had collapsed. I was..trying something."
A nod.
“In this case, your experience is that he does not read music, but you cannot make a conclusion based on the evidence. Now, you could ask your Dada (or I could tell you for that matter), but for the purposes of your education, I hope you won’t mind if we let you figure this out. I have full confidence that you can, Watson. Or at the minimum, you can learn a great deal about the process of inquiry by trying.”
But when Sherlock appeared to claim her while John made arrangements for their supper, Martha was grateful to be able to pass along the child.
Mrs. Hudson spent more of her time resting, then more time sleeping. She let them take her to hospital to be treated when it was clearly needed.
As they ready to play again the teacher asks, “What did you notice about playing this way, Will? Or do you prefer William?”
caught between heartache with wonder at the chance he'd had to comfort John from waking nightmare, to plunging into despair at the prospect of never seeing his sleep heavy eyes sharpen with desire. How he rolled back over, weighed down with bitterness and contrition. Seeking the annihilation of sleep, his thoughts tangling with bittersweet gratitude and excruciating hope that he might yet be forgiven.
At last, a wheeling squadron of jellies poke and bump. Spinning, urged by the changing light and warmth. They merge with a drifting battalion of marshmallow moons. Soft floating wing as far as the eye can see. The siren song of distant seas calls them home. And they follow.
“All right, Watson. This is plenty of data." Sherlock lifted Rosie off his lap and they returned to the music stands together. Sounds of life were increasing outside. The friendly lilt of Mrs Hudson chatting with a neighbor came up to them from below. A car passing by backfired. Sherlock noted his own internal moment of alarm, but showed nothing externally. He was pleased to see that his child had no reaction to the noise.
“I had my doctor to watch over me.”
She recalled the pungent scent of fir as she listened to Sherlock's violin, circling every moment with a promise of magic. Like a green refrain to a song punctuated by verses of pain and misery, lumbering into notes of redemption but settled now into an air of courage and hope. One that beckoned the singer forward into a different world where they could finally breathe free.
“Consult your memory. Any other informative details?”
John's embarrassment tipped over into mortification, and he immediately did all he could to extricate himself from the conversation. "Well, can't keep him waiting. We can talk about details later. Thank you!"
"Dada sings, but doesn't play. We can ignore this. It doesn't tell us at all whether he can read music, since people can do both or one or neither. I've never
Up in 221B, Sherlock and John had settled back on the couch together. The rest of the anisette-flavoured biscuits had migrated near. Glasses were refilled with champagne. They sat close. Sherlock's left hand was linked with John's right. John's face was flushed. His lips were reddened and glistening still. The detective was fighting to maintain a calm, relaxed air. But he couldn't subdue the smile in his eyes and it kept breaking free across his mouth as well. A warm feeling was lodged in his chest.
Mr Shadid struggles to keep several emotions from crossing his face. "The boy is six years old."
“Oh, she looked fine to me. I think I was able to get all the stingers out. They took her over to hospital for observation. If she has an allergic reaction it can be quite dangerous.” Sherlock’s arm tightened briefly around his waist. “There were no signs of it I could see. But I encouraged the parents to be cautious.” He took a sip of tea, then rested his head on Sherlock’s shoulder. “Is this common?”
That is troubling.
After a nip to the bud of the nipple that had the detective gasping for breath and biting his lip to keep quiet, John's mouth gentled. His grip grew less desperate. He released Sherlock and almost bashfully rebuttoned his shirt to a modest extent. "I'm sorry. I got carried away. It's just." John brought the tip of his tongue to his lips and bit it gently. "It's been a torment not being able to touch you."
"You look to the director or the conductor to tell you if you should pause, and for how long, and when it is 'safe' to cross the tracks and start going again. That's when you play." He felt her thoughtful nod. Rosie nestled her head against his neck and he felt her body grow slack and relaxed. "Are you still awake, Bee?"

Sherlock rose from bed and mechanically went about his morning routine in the dove grey twilight of dawn. He tried to rinse the taste of his own self
Sherlock came to the top of the stair. He looked down, and though she knew he couldn’t see her, she felt he was speaking right to her.
His eyes were red. His normal pallor was even another shade more wan. He pulled the dressing gown tightly across his chest as he sat at the table. As if he couldn’t get warm.
she began muttering the phrase under her breath. Sherlock rolled his eyes and glanced towards the kitchen.
"I can't think straight, much less talk after that."
Sherlock put up with this liberty, and John felt a slight pressure returned. Sherlock's arms around him. He blanked his mind and soaked it in until young Watson broke the moment. She made a snuffling sound that was the typical start to her wake-up routine.
Do not ignore me, Sherlock. I've been drinking water and am sobering up. You cannot go home. I know you're skulking about somewhere on the grounds having a cigarette
Sherlock went on, more quietly. "Exactly. There are plenty of boring cases we could take. Most of those are much more lucrative than the truly engaging ones."
"Sherlock." Sherlock snapped back to the present and was surprised into giving a genuine smile to his friend.
John’s eyes blinked appreciatively. He responded to the change. He placed a hand on the paper strewn table, across from where Sherlock’s hands sat with fingers woven together.
i mean it
"Sherlock, you don't have to like it. But I need to unwind. Do what you want, but I'm entitled to use this space, too."
Well, that went about as well as it could have been expected to. In other words, a royal cock up of a perfectly good friendship. Poor girl. Probably for the best, really. Her gaydar needs adjusting.
John whistled, then hummed in pleasure as Sherlock closed the distance between them and pulled him close with an arm wrapped around his shoulders.
"Yes?"
John’s eyes dropped to the floor. She saw his cheeks color. Saw him bite his lip in longing and - embarrassment?
Plus, it had fit his curricula for Watson's exposure to world traditions to a veritable 'T.' And though he only played on nights when Watson woke, it was time that they two so often shared alone in the world. The music could be wholly new to John.
Martha Hudson returned to her living room, finding Rosie beginning to fuss. She pulled her out and united the child with her bottle, calming the girl.
John grinned, remembering his own heartfelt plunges into sentiment at that age. “Still pretty understandable.”
Martha thought of the times she'd helped Mycroft retrieve Sherlock from relapse. She thought of the danger nights when she'd helped John stand vigil. And she thought of the day she thought they'd interred her dear friend in the ground. The shock she'd felt later when he returned, miraculously. She saw again the blank desperation that had taken hold of John after Sherlock fell. And the roiling anger that had taken residence in him after the detective returned. And the incredible relief that had been able to bloom once they had come to terms before the wedding. She thought of the life she saw in John's eyes again with Sherlock at his side. The joy she'd seen in them both these past months. The new man Sherlock seemed to be with Rosie and John with him. She tried to think of words. To tell him what it meant and that it would all be worth it some day.
Sherlock paused in his regimen with the instrument. Checking the tuning (A-string had dropped a hair less than a quarter tone since he'd tuned it while the caterers were arriving), tightening the bow (a new wooden bow he was still adjusting to, not one soul had thought to check the tension during the almost two years he was gone, another reminder that some things could not be repaired once broken), stretching and loosening his own sinews, and bringing himself to the centering of body and mind that would allow the music to flow (utterly impossible).
"John, no moment with you has ever been wasted."
Sigur Holmes waves Will to go wait outside. He hangs back after the class to talk with the older man who had skillfully shepherded this shifting mass of youthful energy into what seemed a lively, productive group lesson. Sigur is impressed with the way Mr. Shadid had helped the older students' greater focus and ability inspire the younger students. They offered a model, while not taxing the limited attention spans of the rambunctious youngsters. The younger children had spent the second half of the lesson playing tag games to the sounds of Mozart and Vivaldi, while the older students further practiced songs. He recalled seeing something in the literature for the group saying that although children could start at any time, parents were encouraged to begin a child's relationship with the music as soon as possible. Beethoven in the birthing room and all that.
