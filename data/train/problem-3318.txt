Cas straightens and turns, trembling with rage from head to toe and blocking Dean with his body where he sits back on his heels and catches his breath.
If John leaves tonight, like he said he plans to, he’d make it there with plenty of time to spare before the game.
Finally, Dean meets her eye. It’s a challenging stare that he levels her with, his own anger difficult to hold back. Her question all but answered, her mouth twists with sympathy. A sharp pang beneath Dean’s ribs makes his breath catch, but he does everything he can to ignore it.
“Jesus, Cas,” Dean says with a shake of his head. Cas studies him from where he stands in the middle of Dean’s bedroom. “You scared the shit out of me.”
In the alley, Ash and Andy veer right and Jo, Cas and Dean follow until they make it back to Coastal Highway. Once they hit the sidewalk, they pull up, all of them breathless with adrenaline despite the fact there was no one chasing them.
“Thank you for lending me clothes,” Cas looks down at himself, at the new t-shirt and jeans Dean gave him. “Would you mind if I left Shelley here?”
There’s no way it’d be possible. For starters, he wouldn’t be able to convince his dad to allow it. He doubts he could afford even the crappiest apartment off campus. Orientation is at the end of next week, how could he possibly be prepared to leave by then?
Pushing at Cas’s hips, Dean crowds in close, herding him backwards towards the bed. When Cas’s heels hit the mattress, he drops down onto it and pulls Dean along with two handfuls of his t-shirt. Dean takes a second to breathe while Cas shuffles backwards up the bed, but then follows.
Trying to tamp down his disappointment, Dean walks Castiel out and says goodbye to him. It’s not like they have to spend every waking moment together. Cas wants to explore the town, and Dean’s sure he’ll come back later. And if he doesn’t, so what, the guy can do what he wants.
“Let’s just say these hot dates are very impressed with the ‘programming’ of the jacuzzi jets.” Gabriel uses finger quotes for the word ‘programming’ and flashes a suggestive smirk at Dean, who grimaces. “If you know what I mean - ”
“Me and you, we had an agreement,” John says lowly, pointing at the floor between them for emphasis. “I’ve been counting on having you around here to depend on - ”
Leaning into the car, his sneakers scraping for purchase on the asphalt, Dean jerks his head when he catches an elbow to his jaw. Taking advantage of that split second, drunk and in close quarters John still manages to get a palm on Dean’s chin and he shoves his head up towards the ceiling.
They get through Ocean Pines and out onto Route 50 and Dean hits the gas. The residential area gives way to corn fields on either side and Dean hasn’t felt the open road like this in a long time. It feels good, and the three of them roll down their windows and let the breeze in, the salty smell of the ocean falling behind them.
After a quick shower, Dean throws on clean clothes and spends some time straightening up his room. It’s never been this messy before Cas came around. But while he grumbles and rolls his eyes as he picks up a few t-shirts that he knows Cas wore last, he finds that he actually doesn’t mind too much.
“Am I your boyfriend?” Cas asks again, as casual as anything. Dean can hear Sam failing to control his snickering to his right, and he resists to urge to stomp on his foot. “Todd asked me if I was, and I wasn’t sure.”
Undeterred, Dean shakes his head. “We’ll stay along the Chesapeake. We won’t be far from water, and we’ll find somewhere for you to swim.”
Eyebrows pulling down, Dean opens his mouth to argue but John speaks over him before he has the chance.
Dean frowns. “My dad’s always had enough of his own shit to worry about. Really, Cas, it’s not a big deal - ”
He’s just about there when Cas’s head snaps up, but it’s not to look in Dean’s direction. Cas looks up sharply, but he’s staring out to Dean’s right, past where Dean can see what he’s looking at, and Dean freezes. He stops before he reaches the doorway, at an angle out of view from the outside. He watches Cas straighten, and the color drain from his face, and his stomach pitches.
He doesn’t know how long he stays in there but he assumes it’s a while. When he finally comes out, steam billowing around him to escape into the hallway, the apartment is quiet. He goes to his room and dresses slowly.
“Rufus,” Dean says, heading over to the other side of the pool. “Is there anything else you need me to do out here?”
“We just gotta be kinda quiet,” he murmurs. “I don’t know who’s working the night shift, but we don’t want them to hear us. I just shut off the motion light.”
The room has been completely rearranged. The mismatched couch and armchair have been pulled away from the walls and towards one another, and draped over them are more blankets than Dean even knew they owned.
“He’s meeting us down there,” Jo says. “He wanted to win Bela a stuffed animal or something, I don’t know.” She rolls her eyes.
“Um, well,” Cassie says, “there’s a game of Kings starting inside, if you guys wanna join? Tessa and I were just heading in.”
There’s no way John feels awesome this morning, considering how he looked last night, but the man’s always done a decent job at hiding his hangovers. He doesn’t say anything about coming home completely tanked at two in the morning, and Dean sure as shit doesn’t mention it, either.
The words come out of his mouth sounding like Cas isn’t the only one he’s trying to convince, and Dean hates himself for it. Finally, he looks at Cas, who’s watching him somberly.
“Yeah, not after meeting you and your brother, that’s for sure.” Bobby mumbles, and he peers under the hood. “How’s she lookin’?”
It’s obvious Jo is doing her best to strike up conversation, but every one of her attempts falls flat. Cas is trying to be nice, smiling and responding politely, but Dean’s brooding presence beside them has an effect on the atmosphere.
They get a few weird looks getting off the ride, and Dean wonders if he looks about as smacked as he feels all of a sudden. He’s obviously not the only one, as he has to grab at the back of Cas’s shirt as he trips going up the curb, keeping him from falling on his face.
He knew he would find Cas sitting on the edge of his mattress when he got back to his room, but he still startles a little when he does. He shuts the door quietly.
“All your daddy’s gotta know is that you’re workin’ for me, same as always. And if you’ve got a few extra hours between runnin’ my errands you might as well see what you can do with this junker, right?”
He was told to never ever ever put a blanket over Sammy’s head, because he’s too little to get it off and he could get hurt. But Dean figured if he’s under here with him, and he’s the one carefully holding it away from his face, it’ll be okay.
Sam chatters excitedly as they get on and the operator checks that they’re secure, but Castiel stays quiet. Dean wonders if he’s nervous, and leans to see him over Sam’s head between them, catching his eye. He offers him a smile and a nod, trying to look reassuring, and Castiel smiles softly back.
The game starts, and Dean goes over the rules with Cas as they play, and it’s actually… not bad. Cas is on his left, and Cassie’s just a few people to his right, and Jo’s across the table, and as much as he expected this to be terribly uncomfortable, it’s really not.
Groaning in pain, Dean tries to blink away the fireworks erupting in front of his vision as Alastair twists both fists in the front of Dean’s t-shirt. Dean is lifted half off the concrete, and through the pain that radiates all the way up to his teeth, real panic starts to set in.
There’s about one large hit left to the thing, and Cas casts Dean a glance before taking it like a champ. Dean’s kinda lost track of how many the guy’s had, and thinks briefly about whether or not he might be getting him too high his first time.
“Dean.” His dad’s voice is sharp, now, a tone that Dean feels himself react to despite the words being caught in his throat.
“Hey!” A voice calls, and Dean turns to find the girl from the other team at his elbow. “Nice game, guys.”
John trudges into the kitchen, glancing at his boys with a gruff greeting as he makes for the fridge.
Dean strips down and he gets in the shower. The water is scalding hot but he doesn’t care, just lets his head hang so it beats down on his shoulders until the tension seeps away.
“Do you care if I drop you and the groceries off at the apartment?” Dean asks, cranking his window down as he steers the Impala onto the street.
Bobby hesitates at that, and though Dean doesn’t look at his face, his silence feels a bit bewildered at Dean’s tone. Wanting nothing less than to elaborate on that, Dean flashes Bobby a cheap and unconvincing smile.
When there’s nothing possibly left to wipe down or put away, Dean hovers in the doorway of the living room. The credits are rolling on the TV - he missed the entire movie. Sam looks at him from the couch, and Dean is struck with a pang of guilt.
Cas tilts his head down the beach in indication, gives a tiny smile that’s equally cautious and hopeful.
He couldn’t be back here. Oh hell, oh Father, he could not be back in this place. He tried to lift his arms and wrap them around himself, but the chains wouldn’t let him move, too short for him to do any more than thrash his wrists.
After the plants, the fungi, and the other animals, Jack needed to make spaces for the humans. He kept plenty of places natural, of course, preserving the beauty of the newborn Earthly Heaven. But in other spaces, he designed glowing cities, sprawling pastures, sweet suburbs, beachside villas, mountain cabins, and roads to connect them all.
“You disgust me,” Sam hissed in Gabriel’s ear. He punctuated his words with fire. “Look at you, can’t take a little heat?”
“I knew that would get your attention.” He leaned closer and his voice dropped to a whisper. “Sam Winchester is responsible for your downfall, just as he is mine. Why should he survive while we were forced to die? Why should he succeed when we had to fail--by his hand. We had a mission, and he took that from us.”
His favorite thing about Earth’s design had to be the diversity. All of the different terrains, from hills to valleys, from mountains to seas, from forests to deserts, and bursting full of life. Trillions of living things, all interconnected in their ecosystems, reliant on each other for their survival, a divine display of grand cooperation.
The filth in his feathers and the scrape of Asmodeus’s fingers over his wing sent a shudder skittering up his spine.
“If you two are done fooling around, our demon friend delivered the necessary information.” He held up a slip of paper. “I’ve got an address. Abaddon’s taken over a ritzy place in Vegas, quite brilliant on her part, everyone’ll be too wasted to notice demonic activity right under their noses--” Crowley cleared his throat. “Not that I support her actions or anything.”
He just… he couldn’t tell anymore. He prayed they were nightmares. Normally his premonitions showed him things that hadn’t happened yet, not things that he’d already done. Had he done those things? It would explain why blood always coated his hands when he woke up, though when he looked himself over this time, he didn’t just see blood. Dark soot and white ash dusted his skin and clothes, and when he dared inhale, he noted the reeking odor of burnt flesh.
The demon gestured at the water bottle, and Dean picked it up, only to nearly drop it in surprise. “What the hell?” He stuck his finger into the bottle and fished out a glistening chain covered in droplets. “What is this?”
He got lucky with generous humans as well, some offering him a ride if he was willing to hitchhike a few miles. He was.
As they dragged Bobby, still fuming, from the room, Crowley called, “Bye bye, Singer, I’ll call you when I find anything!”
Alastair chuckled. “Haven’t you figured it out yet, Dean? I am torturing you. I’ve already broken you with pain, that’s nothing new. Been there, done that. But if I torture your angel while you’re helpless to stop it? Now that’s something I’ve yet to do. I kill two birds with one stone, break you both together, and there’s not a damn thing you can do about it.”
“No, but you have to know.” Sam picked at his left palm with his nail. “It, um, it concerns you. At first I wrote it off completely as just some nightmare, but then you came back, and now with what you’ve said about Asmodeus possibly being back…”
Rowena arrived on a barren street with Miracle beside her, shaking his head and whining. If Miracle could actually understand speech, she would’ve warned him that teleporting could make one a bit dizzy.
He wasn’t alone in the room. A dark shape huddled in the corner of the room, smothered by shadows, oozing blood from too many wounds. Sam edged towards the figure, as close as he could get without breaking his ankles on the shackles.
He traumatized Sam, forced him into a Groundhog Day time loop to watch Dean die about a hundred times, repeating the same day over and over again till he begged for release. He pushed and pressured, shoved Sam into his pre-destined role even though he’d run from his own. Sam went to Hell, and he could have done something about it, or at least tried. He could have tried to do something about it instead of nudging Sam over the edge. He could have fought his brothers, could’ve tried. Could’ve tried, could’ve died, did die, still should’ve tried.
They said nothing for the next minute, Ruby taking a moment to drink and catch her breath. She’d been… dead? And now she wasn’t? As she remembered the moment of her death, her fist tightened till brown glass cracked beneath her white fingers. How dare he? After all the power she gave him, how dare he?
Why the hell would he do that? All he’d done was cripple himself so it would be harder to actually do his job when the ruse fell apart.
A remark about personal space died in Dean’s throat before it was born. “Still tired?” Dean asked him instead.
The cell door shut and locked, and Dean sat on the stained floor with his arms wrapped around Cas for two days.
Then he wouldn’t spend every waking hour with his ear against the wall, passing fleeting conversation with Cas or screaming at Alastair or listening to the gut-wrenching sound of Cas panting and whimpering and groaning, trying so hard to hold in a scream, but he always gave in eventually. Afterwards, when he could be sure they were both alone, Dean would ramble nonsense, talk about anything and everything he could think of as a distraction.
Dangling from the ceiling, his feet barely brushed the floor, weaponizing his own weight against him. He tried to stand on the tips of his toes, but even when he could get them under himself, they slipped on the floor, slick with blood leaking from his wings and wrists.
“You’d have to ask him yourself,” he said between sips of his drink. “The boy won’t talk with me nearby.” Asmodeus chuckled to himself. “I made damn good sure of that. Now… What is it you’re planning, Ruby?”
Even charred and bloody, they felt oddly soft, just like a bird, and in other circumstances he wouldn’t have been able to resist burying his fingers into them.
It took him a moment to realize that the knocking sound didn’t come from his own mind, it came from somewhere else. The knocking sounded again, and Miracle barked, trotting towards the stairs. Sam groaned and pushed himself to his feet, gripping the counter for balance.
“Oh Miracle,” Rowena called to the shaggy dog sleeping in the corner, “How would you like to go on a little walk to, ehm,” she reached out to the presence once more, pinpointing a location, “to Ohio.”
Gabriel tried to scramble back, but the chains on his wrists clanked and held him still. Sam pinned him, ignoring stuttering sobs and whines. He set the planks into place. The spikes slashed against Gabriel’s skin and he yelped, but when he tried to lurch back, he just dug the points in deeper, cutting under the skin.
She folded her arms. “I assume you’re the angel little Sammy’s been hanging around with, then? I’ve heard you could be a whiny bitch.”
He got out just in time to say goodbye to Jody, Donna, and their daughters, and then he’d retreated to his room again.
They’d hurt during the Fall, when they’d burned up like comets, and they’d ached for some time after, but he really felt it now, with cold air blowing right into the open wounds, stinging exposed flesh and bone. Unhealed burns and cuts covered his wings, littered in between with bits of ash, debris, and broken feathers that needed to be plucked.
If Alastair heard Dean, he ignored him.Cas’s breaths came in gasps, failing to conceal the low whine in his throat.
Hot crimson fountained from gaping wounds in his back, pouring to the floor. Cas wailed and slouched forward with a sob, and when he moved his head down, Sam saw Dean, clinging to Cas’s bare shoulders with trembling hands.
Cas cracked a smile. “Not at all, Dean. I’m glad to know that I’ve helped you recognize that there’s more to you than killing.”
But Miracle didn’t seem to mind his mistakes. He looked at Dean with reverence, with love, never expecting anything back. He gave freely, and dammit had Dean needed that love. The day after they’d saved the world, when the weight of everything that had happened slammed into Dean with the force of a truck, he collapsed in bed and didn’t move.
“This should be similar to how the angel’s wings burned up in the fall, but not an exact replica. It’s the best we can do without the angel tablet,” Asmodeus explained and handed him a blowtorch. “It’s designed to burn with hellfire, not regular fire, so it’ll do some real damage if you hold it in place long enough.”
“I’m fine,” he insisted, but didn’t pull away. If anything, he leaned closer, soaking up the warmth of Cas’s fingers against his hand and the intensity of his stare, a piercing gaze that Dean knew how to look beneath to excavate the emotions trapped behind it. “I’m fine,” Dean repeated. “It’s fine, I’ll be fine.”
Dean had to admit that talking about what happened with Sam did help him to cope with it. So instead of hiding away in his room, he talked to Sam, and it helped him get his thoughts straight, but it still didn’t ease the grief.
Cas sighed, failed to cover a smile, and took a glass from Sam, who’d been holding it out expectantly for him, waiting for Dean to convince him to take it.
“If he has something to say he’ll say it,” he snapped. Then he sighed and forced his hands to unclench. “Look, Michael prefers to be left alone. He’ll talk to me, but that’s about it. He doesn’t like to come out unless he has to. So just…” He waved his hand. “Just tell me what you need to tell me. If he has anything to say, he’ll tell me, and I’ll tell you, or maybe he’ll even ask to come out. So tell me?”
He had spent days (or maybe weeks) waking up with lingering, alien satisfaction that didn’t feel like his own infecting the back of his mind.
Rowena ignored him and bent to scratch the mutt on the ears. He wagged his tail and licked her hands, sniffing her perfumed palms. What a traitor. Crowley had rescued him from his lonesomeness, and here he was, covering Crowley’s mother in kisses.
He’d forgotten who he was before. He’d forgotten why he’d been put on this earth. But he would never forget again. He had a life to return to now, he had hope, and maybe he didn’t have a fate or a destiny anymore but he had something better, something he’d fought to the death to hold onto.
“I’m not quite sure what happened, but I woke up in the ocean, by the shores of California. I came here as soon as I could, I know it’s been a few days. I’m truly sorry, I should’ve called, but I was afraid you might not be alive to answer, and then I’ve been worried that maybe you wouldn't want to speak to me after what I confessed to you, so I understand if my presence makes you uncomfortable and you’d prefer if I left--”
Alastair’s mouth split into a wide, toothy smile. “Yeah it is. You know, most people will train their pets not to make so much noise, but you just let yours yammer away all the damn time. Don’t you ever get tired of the sound of his voice?” He waved off a response before Dean could give it. “I sure did. This’ll train your bitch real fast.”
Gabriel must’ve guessed by the crease in Sam’s brow and the unease in his voice that Sam had seen something unpleasant. “Do I want to know?”
He croaked out two words, no more than breaths, so quiet he didn’t think Sam would be able to hear him. “I’m sorry.” The words came out with a sob and wheezing ache in his chest that came from something deeper than physical pain.
Dean growled low in his throat, but stepped back, and made no move to keep struggling. Cas released his grip, but Dean didn’t pull away from Cas’s hands. Taking that as permission to continue physical contact, Cas slid an arm around Dean’s shoulders.
They spent a little longer talking through the night before, around one in the morning, Miracle opened his mouth and let out a massive yawn. The shaggy dog shook himself out, stretched, and padded towards Dean’s room.
If it weren’t Cas he’d laugh at the irony. Two pronged bits of sharpened metal, shaped like forks, hence the name. One stuck into the sternum, the other stuck under the jaw, rendering head movement and speech nearly impossible, with a tight band of stiff leather strapped around the throat to keep the forks in place, secured in a way that made even swallowing difficult.
'I think our glory days are still to come,' Castiel countered, 'but I'm up for a sexy nostalgia trip. Press play.'
'No, I'm fine. Let's keep going.' They exchanged a few comfort kisses, and Dean pulled Cas under his arm before heading back to the road. The rest of the drive was quiet, the silence only filled by the radio quietly playing classic rock.
‘Yeah?’ Dean’s hands ran up and down Cas’s arms, on his neck, his face, in his hair. It was like Dean couldn’t stop touching him now that he had the chance, and Cas was more than happy to let him.
'Well, that too. But I knew you weren't, and defended you vigorously on that point.' Dean just grunted, so Cas turned to look at him. 'I told her that we had already discussed a pre-nup. Eventually she dropped that argument, but I couldn't really make us any older or extend how long we'd known each other. I had never been in love before, and she convinced me that if our love was real, it would survive the distance and be stronger for it. But I went about it all wrong, I fucked everything up, and I lost you.' The tears he'd been fighting for months finally began to flow.
‘I want it all, Cas.’ Dean cradled Cas’s face in his hands, so gently it made Cas want to cry. ‘I want you.’
There was a sharp gasp from the desk, followed by the sound of clattering, a thump, and a muffled swear. They looked over to see Dean getting up from the floor, scowling and rubbing his head.
But hey, that bitterness had served him well. Without anyone at home to distract him, he had served with distinction in a glittering- if shorter than expected- military career. Rather than just a normal sailor, he'd decided to go for the full SEAL career path and passed with flying colours. After a blazing display of heroics (many details of which he was not allowed to discuss due to the classified nature of his mission) that earned him a Navy Cross and medical retirement, he had been offered lucrative contracts as a consultant for Hollywood blockbusters, and even appeared as an extra in one of the movies. Cas and Naomi could suck on that.
Cas grabbed at Dean’s t-shirt, pulling it over his head and tossing it aside before doing the same with his own. His hands went to Dean’s belt next, not even bothering to pull it out of the loops, just undoing it and his jeans and pushing them down. The wet spot on Dean’s straining boxer briefs betrayed his excitement at proceedings.
'I just about died when Sam told me the name. He thought it was this funny coincidence that would amaze me, but I had to lock myself in the bathroom to stop freaking out. I couldn't figure out why you'd do that, so I just repressed it with everything else.' He reached out into the seat between them and Cas offered his hand, like he had done so many times before. Dean gave it a squeeze before bringing it to his lips. 'I was kinda surprised. Didn't think you'd want the constant reminder.'
‘Shoes, Cas,’ Dean sighed as Cas paused to run his hands over Dean’s chest and kiss his neck. ‘Can’t get my pants off with shoes on.’
'I lost my nerve when I came back here, and then I thought maybe it would be better to try and, I don’t know, seduce you properly or something instead of just throwing all that onto you out of nowhere. I was building up to it when you went to San Francisco. Then I talked to Sam and Jess and they told me to go for it too. The bachelor party looked like it was going to be my chance, but that Mick guy was obviously into you, and he seemed like a good catch. I didn't want to get in the way if you were interested. Lisa had told me that you hadn't really dated since, um, since Inias.'
‘I hate shoes,’ Cas grumbled, but dropped to his knees to untie Dean’s laces. Unsurprisingly, he got a bit distracted by the view down there and started nuzzling against the outline of Dean’s erection. ‘But I love this.’
‘Not soon enough.’ Cas pulled the boxer-briefs down and took Dean’s cock in his hand, a flood of memories overtaking him as he ran his fist over the silky sin. ‘Can I?’
Cas obliged, and his skill in that department had not abated with the recent lack of practice. When Dean panted his warning, Cas pulled back only enough for Dean’s come to land on his tongue and lips, and after swallowing, he licked Dean clean until the oversensitivity became too much.
‘You may have missed the subtext of my conversation with Garth, but I was basically saying that I never stopped loving you and never would.’
‘Dude, it was so awkward. It took like a week for me to stop getting a boner every time I walked in the door. I just kept picturing what we used to do on this bed back in the day.’ Cas laughed, and Dean added more shyly, ‘I even dragged out that sex tape we made, where I was tied up on it. I don’t know if you remember.’
‘I watched it the day you arrived,’ Cas admitted. ‘I hadn’t watched it for years, but I felt like wallowing in self-pity that day.’
Garth nodded. 'I feel ya. Well, whatever the case is with Benny, I guess I'm just happy he's happy again. Lisa seems like a nice girl. I hope it works out for 'em.' He sighed and gave Cas a hug. 'I'd better get going. Dean, I'm just gonna take mine and Benny's bags out to my car, can you meet me there with the stuff I need to take?'
'Sounds like a plan!' Garth agreed cheerfully. Cas went to the office to switch on the geriatric computer equipment while Benny finished getting his stuff together. He gave them all hugs before running out the door to his ride.
'OK, yeah, it was pretty awesome,' Dean grinned back. 'But it was just a one-time thing in his trailer.'
'You'd probably be doing my dad a favour, but with the rush that Benny's in, it's probably better this way.'
Cas raised his eyebrows. 'Uh, Garth, it's already past noon. It'll take him at least twenty minutes to get to the venue, and I'm guessing he'll want a shower.'
'But you weren't going to say anything until you heard me talking to Garth?' Cas asked, tilting his head in question.
'Maybe expressing his feelings so openly made them easier to let go,' Cas said. 'So many people go shouting their love off rooftops, but how many of those relationships really last?' He sighed, allowing himself a peek at Dean out of the corner of his eye. He remained at the computer, reading punctuated by typing, and not paying them the least bit of attention. Still, Cas lowered his voice a bit. 'I've often been told that I'm not very expressive with my emotions despite feeling them strongly. My mother always said that I had too much heart, but people didn't understand that because I didn't wear it on my sleeve. They mistook composure for coldness, but I still feel the humiliation of a childhood bully calling me a robot, the sadness of losing Mom… My first love still makes my heart beat.'
Castiel rolled his eyes, but didn't look away from the mirror where he was doing his hair. 'Yes, Naomi, I'm absolutely certain. There's nothing anyone could say to persuade me otherwise, especially not today. I'm going to marry Dean in a few minutes, end of story.'
'Cool, I'll wait downstairs. See ya, Cas. Thanks again for the hospitality.' Garth left with a wave, but Dean continued to type fiercely as the printer finished churning out pages. He collected them all and returned to the computer. Cas’s eyes were, as always, drawn to him, so he noticed when Dean looked at him with a pleading expression at the same time as he clicked the mouse.
‘I’ll accept your professional opinion on the matter,’ Cas agreed with mock seriousness. ‘We should probably start right away.’
'I almost died of a heart attack the first time because I wasn't expecting it, after that I spent the whole movie anticipating it and left right after. I pre-ordered the DVD.'
Cas laughed. ‘Sounds like a plan. It’s been a while, though, we should probably do some rehearsing first.’
Cas chuckled and kissed Naomi's forehead. 'We're getting married on a beach in SoCal in July. I don't want my fiancé to die of heatstroke before he can become my husband.' He took a final glance in the mirror and nodded in approval. Despite Naomi's comparison to Gabriel's tastes, Cas thought his wedding shirt was relatively subtle. Gabriel's choices were always loud, bright pinks and oranges with sometimes inappropriate patterns; Cas and Dean had chosen
Instead, Dean had to cling to Cas while he cried and try uselessly to comfort him while chopping off his wings. Dean picked the knife back up, and with a wet crunch that hurt him almost as much as it must’ve hurt Cas, Dean sawed his wing away, through the feathers, under oozing flesh, tendon by tendon.
So Dean had taken Cas by both hands and assured him he’d be fine before Crowley finished the summoning spell, unleashing a bright red light and a black cloud materializing into the shape of a brunette woman giving him the stereotypical ‘I won’t talk.’
Dark. Cold. Silent. Nothingness stretched out, noiseless and infinite, a liquid blackness, with no life, no breath, sinking deeper, like the final stages of drowning, where there is no more struggle, no more pain, only drifting, lulled by the waves.
Dean shrugged. “It’s still fun, though.” He nudged Cas in the ribs with his elbow. “C’mon, human tradition. If it takes a whole liquor store to get you hungover, one glass isn’t gonna hurt you.”
As Sam walked down the hall to his room, he saw, in the corner of his eye, the edge of Cas’s trench coat vanishing into Dean’s room before the door shut.
No… No, that couldn’t be. He was an angel, he was supposed to have wings, even if they’d been burned black by hellfire and scorched to ash in the Fall and nearly ripped from his shoulders on the rack, they were still there, still his, still part of him that he couldn’t give up.
The demon’s hands around Cas’s neck felt sickening, as if Alastair’s vessel were oozing slime, when he clamped a collar in place. Alastair tightened it much more than necessary, so that it pinched his skin and hurt to breathe.
“What,” Sam snarled, “nothing to say?” He glanced back at Asmodeus and realization dawned on his face. “Oh, right. You’re a fucking coward. You can’t even give me a simple ‘I’m sorry?’ You fucked up and fucked me over and you can’t apologize?” His voice raised with every word. Gabriel flinched.
Rowena raised a brow. “Is that really why you’re trying to help, or have you gained a little bit of a soft spot for them?”
“This is why you’re afraid of the water,” Cas finally says, and his voice is mournful and it makes Dean’s heart ache dully.
When he’s gone, Dean collapses into the desk chair with a sigh. A glance at the upper corner of the computer screen tells him it’s past two o’clock. He rubs his eyes.
,” Dean insists, casting a furtive glance around for any nearby renters. It must still be early enough that no one’s out of their rooms.
Dean shoots him a glare, but he can’t quite bite back the smile on his face. “You’re never gonna let me live that down, huh?” he says, and he jabs an elbow at Cas.
Cassie smiles, and it’s warm and genuine and Dean feels a little caught off guard but he and Cas follow the girls back towards the house.
Thanks to Charli, who let me bounce some ideas off of her, I'm pretty sure I've got the rest of this story mapped out. <3
“Jellyfish are the least compelling creatures I know,” Cas deadpans, and it makes Sam laugh and Dean crack a smile.
“Hey, Cassie,” he says, and he can’t help but feel uncomfortable when she looks to Cas standing beside him.
John unscrews the cap from his beer, tosses it aside to bounce and skid across the counter. Without taking his eyes from his oldest son, he says, “Go to your room, Sam.”
Something lodges in Dean’s throat and he’s choked off, unable to go on for a long moment. He stares up at the ceiling, throat working, and avoids looking at Cas, but he can feel his gaze on the side of his face.
He hoots in excitement when the engine turns over, successfully stuttering to life. Cas and Frazier both startle and look over from where they’re sitting together on the ground.
Mostly, he took them from Chuck’s designs, the creatures of Earth, but he added in a few more mystical things. Jack had always wished unicorns existed, and still remembered his disappointment when Sam told him otherwise. So he added a few to their Heaven.
But after today, he’d never be able to comfort Cas in that way again. He just chopped Cas’s wing off. A piece of his true form, something that had always been a part of him, gone.
Sam tightened the screws. He took his time, waiting each time for Gabriel to get used to the pain. Sam had been tortured too, he knew how it went. When you spend centuries under the knife, you start to get used to the pain, or maybe you learn how to block it. But every time that pain got worse, he'd lose his concentration and it would hit him again full force. So he did the same to Gabriel, allowing him a minute or two between tightenings to get used to the pain.
He knew how to stop himself now, though. He’d break his hands over and over, and his feet too if he had to, just to keep his body under control. This time, when Sam sat back on his cot, though he shook and wept, he felt no fear, because this time, there was no possible way he could hurt Gabriel, and considering the circumstances, that was the best one could get in Hell.
“Much better.” Asmodeus walked past Sam, giving his presence no acknowledgement, and stood over Gabriel. “No big, brave hunter to protect you this time.”
“It’s alright, Dean,” Cas groaned. He nestled his head under Dean’s chin. “I know you’d never choose to hurt me of your own free will.”
“You don’t wanna see me like that,” Dean grumbled. “You don’t wanna see me with Alastair telling me what to do. You don’t wanna feel the things he’s made me capable of.”
“Yeah, I could’ve. I should’ve. I guess a part of me was ashamed of it, or afraid of it. I only really let myself think about it when I could be sure there were no consequences. Like in Purgatory. Remember Benny?”
“God,” Asmodeus interrupted. “Or Chuck as he calls himself now, for some reason. He ripped open the Empty to resurrect Lucifer, who proceeded to die again but hasn’t come back for round two with the rest of us. It seems that this rip Chuck made hasn’t quite healed, and that’s why we were able to slip through.”
Rowena furrowed her brow. Michael didn’t sound interested in anything more than sinking back into cover inside Adam’s mind, but she still didn’t want to risk angering him. The archangels didn’t get along, the Cage was proof of that, but maybe Michael had a soft spot for Gabriel. He’d have to know the truth, that Gabriel was alive but had been abducted, and could very well be suffering.
“We will,” he promised, and ducked into the garage where Dean started up the Impala to drive out, leaving Sam alone in the bunker.
“Gabe, it’s okay, you don’t have to be scared of me,” Sam whispered as Gabriel struggled to escape. “Don’t deny yourself comfort because of me. Please.”
As satisfying as it would’ve been to cover Ruby in vomit, he didn’t wanna puke inside his own body. That would probably kill him, or at least screw him up.
His wing shook from the strain of staying spread open. He wanted to fold them both in, tight against his back, and wait till he was alone before letting them open again so he could try cleaning them off, though he doubted he’d get far. It wouldn’t be easy to get sticky, clotting blood from his clumped feathers, especially with a lack of both water and range of mobility.
Eyelids scrunched, then cracked open, heavy and crusted. Sam cringed at the low light and drew his hands up to his face, covering his eyes. He sniffled, rubbed at his nose, and drew his hand away bloody.
Blood soaked Sam to the skin, hot and reeking, thick enough to look black in the low light. He tried to wipe his hands on the ground, on his clothes, on something, but blood drenched every surface around him to the point that he couldn’t tell what exactly was around him other than blurred shades of crimson.
“She’s been fighting me on this for years, trying to get me to tell you guys. She knew how unfair it was that you didn’t know, and I kept promising her I’d tell you but I didn’t - I never had the guts.”
When they finally get back, Dean fumbles with the keys to the apartment enough times that Cas takes over, sliding his hand over Dean’s and taking them from him.
Despite having told the kid to go get ready for bed, Dean finds Sam waiting for him in the hallway. He hasn’t even got the door shut behind himself before Sam starts on him.
Eventually, the two of them head inside. The truck isn’t outside the apartment, and Dean doesn’t bother thinking about John sitting at the bar at the Roadhouse. Sam’s still awake, which is surprising even though it’s Saturday. Though he says he just wasn’t tired yet, Dean thinks it’s more likely he was waiting for Dean and Cas to get home before going to bed.
Giving Dean’s shoulder one last squeeze, he stands. Pushing himself up from the mattress, he grunts softly as his knee pops. Dean’s eyes follow him across the room.
“I want to go. I know you know that. And I’m glad I’m going, I’m - I’m proud of myself for doing it, for having the guts. But - ” Chewing his lip, Dean shakes his head.
“You’re okay, kid,” Bobby says, his arms around Dean’s chest and Dean doesn’t have the energy to fight against him. “Shh, I know - ”
Dean glances behind him once to make sure that the door to the motel room is still clearly in his sight before he steps onto the wood and pads towards the end. He keeps his feet light, careful of splinters.
“I don’t have direct communication with them, anymore, but I, uh - I still hear things. If something makes a splash, gets them riled up, radio comms come through sometimes. And you, kid…” Dean sees Gabriel shake his head in his peripheral vision. “You made quite a splash.”
For a long moment Dean stands there, in the middle of the room in his t-shirt and boxers, trying to get his thoughts together and ignoring the angry turmoil in his belly.
Dean doesn’t speak again until the walk back, that rock inside him still massive but getting easier to ignore the more he lets his anger grow to outweigh it. He tells Cas that he’ll set up room one for him when they get back. Sam and Castiel both turn to look at him, surprised, and Dean doesn’t want to see either of their faces so he keeps his own eyes ahead.
Cas suddenly turns to him, and his face splits into a smile. “Yes,” he says, but it comes several beats too late and Dean doesn’t believe him for a second.
“That got your attention, didn’t it?” Alastair murmurs, the smirk audible in his voice. It makes goosebumps rise up Dean’s neck.
Alastair gets a fistful of his t-shirt and tries to drag him backwards, but Dean is ready. He uses the momentum to shift back onto his heels and he twists, fast, lifting his elbow and driving it into the side of Alastair’s head. Alastair stumbles back, and Dean uses the opportunity to spring to his feet and dodge away.
“Can’t believe you’re letting him go to nerd camp,” Dean mutters when Sam dashes off towards the sink with the dishes, and John cracks half a smile.
After laying the final dish out to dry, Dean leans against the counter to text Jo, a quick message that he’ll meet them at the boardwalk tonight. Her response comes in seconds and has too many capital letters for Dean to deal with. With a shake of his head, he shoves his phone in his pocket just as the front door of the apartment opens down the hall.
Dean’s gaze trails the rest of the way around the half-circle, until it finally lands on Cas. He’s on the other side of Jo, and he’s not paying the ponies any attention. His eyes are on Dean, and his expression is soft and it’s lost and it makes Dean’s stomach ache. He drops his eyes before Cas does.
Cas does as he’s told, and they kiss. When Cas’s fingertips graze again over one of Dean’s nipples, Dean gasps into his mouth before he can stop himself. Intrigued, Cas pauses before doing it again, and Dean nips at his lower lip and at the same time can’t help but flex his hips up into Cas’s in response. Cas makes a pleasantly surprised noise in his chest.
Dean also gets a solid amount of work done on the Roadrunner, and it’s Thursday afternoon when he gets her to start for the first time.
“I remember inhaling water. And sinking. It felt like it lasted forever. And I remember how scared I was, how panicked, and then - ” Dean swallows. “And then I was on shore.”
“Your legs,” Cas murmurs, and his head tips just slightly to the side, “they’re curved. Mine don’t look like this.”
Finally, he steps forward. The water is cold where it comes just up to his ankles before pulling away again. Dean’s feet sink a little into the wet sand and he lets the ocean eddy around him. He speaks aloud.
“Well, there’s only one left on your bed,” Cas says sheepishly. “And Sam took all of them from your father’s.”
Cas’s eyes search his face, and there’s a soft sadness in them that makes Dean’s chest feel tight. Rolling to his side, Cas slides his hand up Dean’s neck to rest under his jaw. Gently, he brushes his thumb across Dean’s lower lip, his eyes following the movement before meeting Dean’s gaze.
Head snapping back with a shout, Dean reaches up instinctively to get a hand around Alastair’s wrist. Dean twists, trying to break out of his grip, a piercing ache shooting up through his knees where they press into the dock, when he hears the unmistakable
When Cas comes back with jeans on, they settle in front of the TV with their breakfast, with Cas and Dean on the couch and Sam sitting on the floor at the cheap coffee table. Cas is pretty intrigued by cartoons, but is still dubious of Spongebob.
Sorry for the wait - these chapters just keep getting longer and longer, I hope you guys don't mind!
Cas gasps, his body curving towards Dean, and when Dean pulls back an inch to look at him, it’s to see Cas with wide eyes.
They lie next to each other, breathing in opposite rhythms, and though Dean usually finds comfort in the sound he can’t seem to keep his mind focused on anything.
They were too big to just bandage, so Dean stitched the wounds closed. Pulling the thread had an odd sense of finality to it, like closing the wounds was the last step in declaring Cas wingless, and now Dean had no way to fix them.
Gabriel found it easier than he expected to slip into old habits. Keep his head down, keep his mouth shut, do what he’s told when he’s told. React to the pain, because Asmodeus liked that and might stop a little sooner if he was satisfied, but Gabriel couldn’t react too much, lest he become annoying. Don’t talk, ever, especially to beg for it to stop.
Cas swallowed, declined the offer, and spent the rest of the drive in silence, praying to whoever was out there to hear him that his family had survived, too afraid to check until he reached the Bunker in the middle of the night.
Sam had stayed on the cell floor for hours, torching every single feather till it twisted and crumbled. Many, he burnt off, but some he just left to hang, red and black and broken, still bleeding from the shafts. By the time he’d finished, the wing looked sickeningly similar to Cas’s wings, damaged beyond all function and repair.
Rather than becoming angry or violent, Michael closed off entirely, and sank back into Adam. Adam whispered too low for Rowena to hear, no doubt speaking to Michael.
Cas, Jack’s father, needed help. He’d been captured by demons. All of Jack’s dads had, and their uncle too.
“I mean, not really, but I am wearing clothes if that’s the type of ‘decent’ you were referring to.”
“You son of a bitch,” Dean snarled. “Cas, I’m right here, man. I’ll get us out of here and I’ll leave Alastair’s entrails behind, alright?” He had no idea how he would accomplish that, but Cas didn’t need hopelessness. “It’s gonna hurt like a bitch, alright, but I’m right here. I’ll get us out,” he promised.
A low laugh answered. “Oh, you can hear us? That’s perfect. I thought I’d have to have your boyfriend screaming before you heard anything. Humans have such weak ears, I can never tell what’s enough for you to pick up on.”
He didn’t have to go in. He could go back to his own bunker, or maybe back to Hell, say hello to his mother and congratulate her on the promotion, or he could even go on a vacation, spend a month in Costa Rica or Hawaii or somewhere else tropical, with powdery beaches, drinks served in coconut shells, and all the swimsuit-clad eye candy he could dream of.
The demon beside her laughed. He waved over the bartender and ordered her a beer, then one for himself, without bothering to ask Ruby her taste in alcohol. But at this point, taste meant nothing to her; she could drink rubbing alcohol and not care, as long as it dulled the edge of the pain cutting under her skin like a dagger. She twisted off the top of her beer bottle and drank half of it in one swallow.
A heard a gasp, a groan, and a pop that Dean recognized from his years in Hell as the sound of someone’s joints slowly pulling, one by one, out of the sockets. He couldn’t stop himself wondering which joint it had been. Shoulder? Knee? Hip?
His silence didn’t help much. Sam resumed his pace, carving his markings. Another wave of pain rippled inside him, and for the first time he realized how wrong it felt. Unnatural. His guts curdled at the feeling and he wanted nothing more than to recoil away, but he couldn’t escape something already inside him.
They sloped hills down from snowy mountain foothills and carved rivers and canyons through the valleys. He flattened the hills into plains, and dried the grass to sand to form cactus-spotted red deserts, with a few tweaks to keep the temperatures from becoming uncomfortable. They sloped the sand downwards to create plunging basins; Jack filled them with salt water, then plankton and kelp and coral and marine life. He created pines, deciduous woods, rainforests, marshes, tundras, boreal forests, taigas, plateaus, and islands, then filled them with creatures.
For a brief second, the ghost of a smile flicked over Gabriel’s face, and Gabriel opened his mouth to speak, a familiar glint of mischief in his eyes, and Sam realized too late that he'd given Gabriel an open door to make a dirty joke. Luckily, Gabriel decided against it.
Food done, Dean cleaned Cas’s wounds with a cloth soaked in rubbing alcohol. Cas clenched his jaw and squeezed Dean’s hand to fight off the pain, and he tried his hardest not to groan. Dean focused on the gaping wounds on Cas’s shoulders first, mopping out grit and dried blood. The wounds smelled sour, so he used the antibiotic spray as well, for good measure.
He couldn’t respond to Dean without spitting out blood, so he kept quiet and still, closing his eyes and trying his damndest to black out, but sleep evaded him. Cas didn’t know how much time passed before some of the pain subsided, or maybe he just got used to it long enough to move more than an inch at a time. Cas shifted, lifting his head and sliding his arms back to brace himself on his elbows.
And now, clinging to Dean with thankfully restored strength, a light went off in Cas’s mind, and he finally figured out what Crowley meant. Sex, Cas realized. He was talking about sex. Which Cas and Dean had not had yet. Dean’s reaction made sense now, and if they didn’t have bigger problems to deal with, Cas might’ve cracked a grin and let go so he could watch Crowley scurry away as Dean attempted to murder him.
A closer inspection told him it had been. He recognized this knife. The blade extended as long as his forearm, sharpened enough to shave with, and it had serrations snarling off the lower half of the edge, with the upper half smooth and clean, perfect for more elegant, precise cutting. Alastair gave him this knife in the Pit the day he got off the rack. He stared at his blurred reflection in the blade. Dean had mangled, maimed, and slaughtered with this knife.
“I’m so sorry, Cas.” Dean lowered his head to Castiel’s shoulder. “This never should’ve happened. I should be able to protect you. I’ve already failed you too much.” He flicked a few tears off Cas’s cheek with his thumb. “You’ve saved me so many times. From Hell, man, you saved me. And here I am, always failing you. Purgatory, the Fall, the Empty… I should be able to save you the same way you’ve saved me.”
“You won’t look so calm while I’m carving out your kidney.” Ruby slashed the knife through his shirt to expose his skin. His hairs stood on end at the sudden chill, but Sam managed not to shudder or shiver.
Cas’s other limbs weren’t nearly as expressive. He kept his legs tucked under him, and his arms, he crossed over his chest, fingernails digging into his upper arms. Dean shifted his arm so he could take one of Cas’s hands in his and squeeze it.
After those two days, the cell door opened, and an unfamiliar demon came inside, holding a bowl of some sort of gray-brown gruel balanced on a tray beside a bottle of water. In the demon’s other hand, Dean saw a first aid kit.
He really shouldn’t stare at them, considering that he’d royally screwed them up beyond repair, but he couldn’t resist looking. Even ragged and damaged and filthy, they had a beauty to them, something magnetic pulling his eyes toward their glossy, gilded sheen.
They’d left Sam alone for hours to stew in his own false guilt, under the impression that he’d been the one to torture the angel, head stuffed full of fabricated premonitions to watch his own hands beat and break. He hadn’t been taking it well. He’d vomited in a bucket, punched a wall a few times, paced circles around the room, and cried for about an hour straight before dropping on the cot and laying there till he fell asleep.
He tried to count the passing seconds and got to around 43,137, almost twelve hours, before the cell door cracked open.
Sam shuffled towards the cell door and examined the locks. Heavily warded, even with Gabriel on low power. If they weren’t in Hell, he should’ve fully recovered the use of his grace by now. If Gabriel had access to his powers, they’d be able to escape without much problem, even if Gabriel couldn’t fly.
A nightmare. That’s all it was, just another damn nightmare. Gabriel didn’t sleep anymore because of them, other than blacking out in Sam’s arms and sleeping in the Bunker, which he hadn’t meant to do. But he didn’t need to sleep, archangels didn’t need to sleep. He’d only done it in the past to pass the time, but after his years in Hell, he couldn’t.
He eased off the ground and edged closer to the white wall. The whole room looked white, over-bright from the buzzing fluorescents overhead. White walls, white lights, wight floors, no windows, and one door at the front of the room (not white; glossy, polished metal, pale enough to almost be white.)
Where the hell… where in hell… Hell? This had to be Hell, didn’t it? It didn’t look like the Cage (he knew those walls better than he knew his own bedroom) but it had to be somewhere in Hell.
He cleaned the other gashes and lacerations on Cas’s torso, then sealed them. He saved the stitches for bigger or deeper wounds, and used the butterfly strips on the smaller ones. He even used a few of the bandaids. After that, Dean mended Cas’s arms, moving with tender care from shoulder to fingertips, and repeated his nursing for Cas’s legs. He wrapped bandages where necessary, using up most of his supply on Cas’s back wounds.
“I do. You’re not the only one who was tortured in Hell, remember? You’re not the only one who’s torturer has come back to haunt you. So yes, I do know what you’re feeling, because I’ve lived through the exact same thing, so trust me when I say that panicking won’t help you or anyone.”
“Cas, did he hurt your wings?” Concern drenched Dean’s words, and Cas swallowed the coppery tang in his mouth. “Cas?”
“You ran off during the damn apocalypse to get yourself fucked in Monte Carlo, you asshole. I could have failed. Dean and I could have messed up or I could have lost control and then the world as we know it would all have been destroyed, and where would you have been?”
His whole back ached, too excruciating for him to think about moving, so he kept his eyes shut and prayed to anyone and everyone who might hear him that he’d fall back asleep, lost in a state where pain couldn’t reach him.
He winced as he stared at his own blood smeared on his hand. “Where are you?” Sam mumbled to someone other than Gabriel. “Where the hell… Gabriel?”
If Gabriel had known that being carried to Sam’s bed, given dry clothes, and being fed were the last moments of kindness he’d feel from Sam, he would’ve reveled in them a little longer, really taken a moment to appreciate it.
So he didn’t pull away when Sam grabbed him by the shoulders, spun him around, and shoved him up against the wall. He flinched, because how else could he react, but he leaned back, soaking in the warmth of Sam’s strong hands, alive with blood and pulse and heat beneath the skin.
Crowley coughed louder than necessary to get Cas and Dean’s attention. They both flushed crimson and broke away from each other’s kiss, shuffling on the couch.
“And if we gave a damn we would have asked for it,” Asmodeus sassed back. “Now go outside, and just stand there and look pretty till we need you. You’ll get to flambé some angel wings this time.”
She shrugged. “I died and went to Hell during the Renaissance, lots of people were obsessed with the Greeks. But you don’t care about my name, you care about what I could tell you. Could, but won’t.”
Once on land, traveling became a little easier, but exhaustion pulled on him, dragging him down to an agonizingly slow pace. Gabriel hadn’t felt exhaustion in a while, not since Asmodues--nope. Nope, he was not going to think about that.
Asmodeus rolled his yellow eyes. “Really, Gabriel, you used to last so much longer. I thought I trained you to handle pain so much better than this? Oh well, I’ll be back when you wake up.”
He had to. He knew he had to. Sam deserved his apology and so much more, so he had to force the words out. He couldn’t keep using his fear as an excuse, he just had to say something, say something dammit, but his mouth hung open, tongue still, and he couldn’t seem to make it move. Why couldn’t he just speak?
“It’s too early for guessing, Crowley,” Sam grumbled as he swallowed a gulp of his coffee. “Who is it?”
“To be honest, I didn’t think about it till he confessed to me. I didn’t let myself think about it. But I guess I started to think about it when we were in that barn, remember, with the spear?” He waited for Sam’s nod before he went on. “He said ‘I love you’ then too, and he looked right at me. I didn’t know what kind of love he meant. I should’ve asked, son of a bitch I should’ve asked.”
With a few locator spells, Rowena had been able to pinpoint a large supply of power somewhere in the American midwest.
Metal scraped against Cas’s skin, rubbing back layer by layer, stripping his flesh to the bone. The spikes didn’t help, lining the inside of the shackles encircling his wrists. Each point speared him, too tight and too sharp and stabbing him with pain. He couldn’t move, or he might dig the spikes in deeper, so Cas held still, forcing his breaths to come out even so he wouldn’t tremble.
“... me instead?” That sounded like Alastair. Another jumble of whispers, too tangled for Cas to unravel, until his voice raised, and his next words came out clear and sharp. “You agreed before. You’ll do it again.”
Dean had more experience with rack torture than he wanted to think back on, and no way in hell would he let those asshats do the same to Cas.
He’d lost Cas before, many times, but this time was final, and no amount of talking it out or holding Miracle close at night and crying into his fur would change that.
Gabriel’s wings folded tighter, crammed partly out of sight behind his back but too big to hide. The feathers rustled as he shook.
Sure, he had to get up eventually, but then he’d be an asshole for waking a sleeping dog and a sleeping angel. He hadn’t seen Cas sleep much, even in all the years of knowing him, but now that Dean laid beside him, arm draped over Cas’s side, he could watch, unashamed, as Cas’s chest rose and fell in slow breaths. For a dangerous, powerful angelic warrior, Dean couldn’t help but find him adorable.
Dean left, and once Sam was alone, he sucked in a deep breath and rubbed his fingers against his temples in a fruitless attempt to ease his swelling headache, but it didn’t fade away, it just kept pushing against his skull. Maybe he should take painkillers, or cold medicine.
Instinct won out, and he sat immobile, trying his hardest not to flinch when he felt fingers digging into his wings and pulling them open. Gabriel whined, unable to keep himself completely mute.
Dean showed Cas the screen, where three sixes showed as the caller ID. “Get Sam,” he said as he answered. “He’ll probably wanna hear this.”
Eventually Miracle got him up by yawning and standing up in bed, stretching his paws out. His claws scraped against Dean’s leg before he jumped off the bed to scratch at the door.
In some ways it did, because he could no longer be punished for struggling if he didn’t struggle. But Asmodeus got bored easily, and Gabriel would always end up as his prime target. Asmodeus took any excuse to beat him down, no matter how hard Gabriel tried not to antagonize him. Total silence, total stillness. Not a word, static as a stone, deathlike. He closed his eyes so he wouldn’t blink, and at some point he stopped breathing.
Bruises and blood splattered them both. Cas’s face twisted in agny and he shuddered, gasping, grace-lit blue and red blood leaked from his mouth, nose, ears, and eyes. A cold spike of fear buried itself in Sam’s heart. Sam didn’t need a more obvious telling that they were in danger. He had to find them, figure out where they were and what happened to them, but he could only see feathers.
“Right here,” an unfamiliar voice directed, drawing lines across Gabriel’s back with his fingernail.
“DEAN!” Cas rushed as close as he could get to the flames without them touching him, heat searing all around him. If his vessel could sweat, he’d be drenched in it.
But he had to get to Dean in order to have that embrace, or even just a comforting hand on his back, something to anchor him and prove he wasn’t alone. At this point, he’d take anything. A glimpse, a brush of their fingers together, anything. Anything at all.
And Sam watched himself kneel down behind Gabriel, who’s wings had both been chained and spread as far as they could go in the cramped space. He picked the left wing at random, and turned on the blowtorch, exposing a beam of blue flame reeking of sulfur.
He wanted to apologize, but he’d have to speak for that, and he couldn’t, not with Asmodeus staring straight through him. He weighed his fears against each other, and his fear of punishment won once more.
She should start at the beginning here. “How aware are you about what’s been happening with the Empty?”
Rowena nodded, though the way Michael’s vessel seemed so determined to hide him away didn’t seem like a good omen. Michael even had to ask permission from his vessel to come out, when normally an entity would just shove their vessel’s mind aside and take over. He had plenty of power inside him, but how willing would he be to use it?
“Dean, you can kill him later.” He ignored Crowley’s look of betrayal. “We have to deal with Abaddon first.”
“Yeah,” he said instead. “Between seawater and the thunderstorm I got stuck in the middle of. Speaking of which, damp isn’t exactly comfortable. Got anything I can change into?”
He didn’t expect to enjoy it. He didn’t think he should enjoy it. After all, what kind of person liked torturing people? He never took joy in hurting or killing, even monsters. He did it, of course, because someone had to, and he’d had the life forced on him before he was born, but he didn’t like it. He tried his damndest to get out, only for fate to intervene and drag him back in.
But in this place, collared and locked away, Cas had to be hyper-vigilant, aware of his every movement and sound, or he’d just hurt himself.
He managed his legs well enough, but one of his wings bent under his weight and he gasped, stunned still by a spike of pain.
The voice startled him, filling him with the energy to actually sit up. Oh, just Sam, sitting at the foot of the bed. Wait… had Sam brought Gabriel to lay in his own bed? When he was a little more aware and a little less dizzy, Gabriel could tease him for that.
His mind and memories stitched together scenes of suffering that he knew had never happened, but somehow felt real anyway.
Cas rolled his eyes. Of course that’s what interested Dean the most. Not the knight of Hell trying to conquer all of demonkind so she could destroy humanity, not the fact that even if they were on the same side Crowley was in no way trustworthy. The drinks, the gambling, all of Earth’s greatest temptations in one place. Cas had never been there himself, and had no desire to, but the whole ‘demon trying to kill everyone’ problem was more important than personal preference.
The hunters, of course, reunited their communities, even though they had no monsters to slay. Many of the older angels avoided them, but the newer ones Jack made didn’t have any problems mingling with anyone and everyone they could meet, and Jack thought that this must’ve been the true intention for angels. To love and protect humanity, just as Jack loved them. Something had gone wrong along the way, but Jack granted forgiveness to the ones who asked.
“You can’t just expect to get away with that.” She lifted her hand, flashing a knife in her face. “Did you honestly think I would be content watching you cry and hurt yourself? No, I want to get my hands dirty.”
Dean hefted Cas up and draped him over his shoulder, straining under his weight. Though oddly enough, he felt lighter somehow, even with two new limbs. He didn’t necessarily look thinner though. Cas didn’t need to eat anything, so going all this time unfed and immobile wouldn’t drop his weight.
She didn’t just cut it out, because that would be too kind. No, Ruby stabbed him in the kidney, repeatedly, until she had him thrashing and gasping, ghostly pale with beads of sweat dripping off his skin.
“I said no, of course,” Dean assured him, “and Alastair asked if I’d rather he do it instead, and, a-and… Fuck, why can’t I save you? He wants me to torture you, Cas. Me or him. Why can’t I save you from this? We saved the world, you saved the world. Don’t you deserve peace now? And I can’t seem to give it to you.”
“Assuming Crowley actually went to Sam. How much you wanna bet that he’s suntanning in Sri Lanka right now?”
“If you two are done bickering like an old married couple, can we get on with it?” Crowley gestured to the doors of a towering resort, guarded by demons in disguise.
The dream faded alongside the headache, and after a few minutes, Sam couldn’t recall what he’d dreamed about in the first place. Once the images faded away, out of sight out of mind, Sam closed his red-rimmed eyes. He sank back, falling into a deep sleep, no longer burdened by a headache, and he slept through the rest of the night without having any more nightmares.
The pain left him pale and breathless, with sweat dripping down his forehead, his whole body overcome with intermittent shakes and twitches. Some of the feathers still attached to his wings stood on end, shaking in their displeasure. But the worst pain had been the silence. Cas didn’t have any way to alert Dean that he was still there without electrocuting himself, and Dean, probably thinking Cas had fallen unconscious, didn’t say a word, leaving him completely alone until he heard the crack of Dean’s cell door opening and low voices.
“My name is Rowena, and I’m the queen of Hell,” she introduced. She kept her voice cheery, but low enough that no one else would hear. “And I take it by all of that angelic power radiating off of you, you would be the archangel Michael, or at least his vessel. I must say, I thought you’d be taller.”
“Unfortunately,” he replied, voice raw and croaky. Gabriel coughed till he could speak a little better. “So ah, surprise, I’m not dead. This time I wasn’t faking though, I actually did die, but now I’m back. And wow, I feel like shit. I didn’t have anywhere else to go so I figured I’d just crash here for a while.”
Alastair doing the torturing would, of course, be much worse than if Dean did it, because Dean could control himself. If he had the knife in his hand, he could choose where and how deep to cut. Logically, Cas would feel much less pain if Dean said yes, but that only covered physical pain. What would it feel like to Cas for the man he loved, the man he lived and died and sacrificed everything for, to hurt him?
That’s how they communicated through the ordeal. All Dean could make himself say was “I’m sorry,” and Cas said nothing at all, just whined and cried and groaned, and sometimes he lost control of himself and screamed, and then his whole body would thrash in agony from electrocution. Dean swore he could see faint wisps of smoke rising from the collar. If Alastair weren’t watching, Dean would chop the damn thing off.
“You got a name?” Dean asked as he examined a row of knives, tone almost conversational, as if he wasn’t about to flay a demon to the bone.
Maybe Sam could do that again. But his powers did have a tendency to respond best when juiced up on demon blood, and Sam wouldn’t be going down that path ever again. Just looking at Ruby, who’d weaponized her blood against him, reminded him of withdrawals.
He couldn’t figure out the location other than Hell, so he moved on to checking himself over physically. Other than the chains on his ankles rubbing his skin raw, he had no injuries. So where had all this blood come from, why did he have so much blood all around him, on his hands, matted in his hair, up his nose, down his throat, if it wasn’t his blood, then who’s blood could it possibly--
‘We have plenty of time, and I want this. Will you let me, Dean?’ He looked up at Dean with pleading blue eyes, Dean’s cock resting against his cheek, and it wasn’t like Dean could refuse a request that was presented so temptingly.
missed it?’ Dean huffed. ‘My dick’s never had it so good.’ He pulled Cas up to his feet and quickly worked open his pants. ‘My turn.’
Cas was always very precise with the words he used, so Dean understood that it wasn’t so much asking for permission as an enquiry about the safety of an unprotected blowjob. ‘Yeah, I’ve been tested.’
'I wasn't really trying to get with either of them, I want you to know that. They just seemed the flirty type, and I didn't think they'd take it seriously. It wasn't until we were all in the hospital that I realised everyone thought Lisa and I had hooked up. I panicked, man. I knew the baby wasn't mine, I never so much as kissed her, but it made me wonder if Lisa also assumed we were gonna get together, and I felt really shitty about leading her on like that. That's why I bailed afterwards, I needed to clear my head and figure some shit out.'
That voice, that damned voice, froze Gabriel’s blood in his veins. His breath quickened, whistling in and out through his nose. As much as his body wanted to suck in full, deep gasps, he wouldn’t--couldn’t--open his mouth, couldn’t risk uttering a word, or he’d lose his voice again, and Gabriel couldn’t go through that another time. He just couldn’t.
