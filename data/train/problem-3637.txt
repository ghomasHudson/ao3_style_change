Dean laughed, and winked at him, causing a comfortable tremor in Castiel.
You are the one, my love for you is true
Gentleness? Dean definitely didn’t deserve to be looked at with any kind of goodwill, let alone affection - certainly not by Cas. Still Cas said nothing, just sat there, as stoic as he was used to, but his face, his face was not that of the emotionless angel he had known then.
"I liked mom’s scented candles so much, wanted to see that funny flicker again and also wanted to give her a treat when she got home. She had worked so hard all week, actually all month. And I didn’t like seeing her so drained. I just wanted to be good to her, ya know? But mom had put all the lighters and matches at the top of the kitchen cabinet, as well as the knives. I couldn’t reach 'em.
Castiel’s lips had taken on a life of their own. They were as drawn to Dean as his entire body, addicted to his kisses. To his softly whispered words when they let go of each other for a few moments. The familiar tingling sensation that he had grown accustomed to with Rambler/Dean set in, and he imagined quite a few happy hormones making their way through his body. Whenever they looked at each other, Castiel sank into Dean’s gaze.
Your short message from last night has never left me. I keep thinking of your words, even wrote the sentences down on paper.
No, not today, Dean told himself. For a few minutes he calmed himself, singing
After a short breakfast Dean and Cas were lying on the sofa in the TV room, watching Christmas movies. Dean made them cocoa with whipped cream and waffles, and although Cas said he could only taste something "every third bite“ and "every five sips,“ it pleased Dean a lot.
"This might be not your best day, I presume?“ the guy said, his gravelly voice giving Dean goosebumps. The trench coat man smiled, and Dean could have pounced on him immediately for that comment, so Dean probably would have come to rest on the floor, on top of the guy’s chest, currently hidden under a white shirt.
Dean sighed and started typing a short reply, barely able to form a clear thought. Unfortunately, he couldn’t even blame this condition on the alcohol because he hadn’t drunk that much, no, it was just his damn brain that just wouldn’t give him a break.
Dean growled so loudly that Castiel’s body shivered. Suddenly, he was pushed against the wall. Dean pressed his body into his, roughly, but not violently, until his legs touched his and his arms were placed on the wall beside his head. Dean smelled good. His scent was a mixture between freshly showered, leather, pine and something very Dean-like.
Castiel was fascinated by this, as he had experienced Dean as impulsive and quick-witted above all. Certainly, he had also witnessed his profound nature, especially after their dances in the bar. Nevertheless. The fact that he also dealt in this way with more or less strangers touched him.
The kiss was calm and sensual. Cas tasted like nothing he’d ever experienced. So pure. So irresistible. Kissing him for real felt so much more fantastic than all his little fantasies at night hours or his dreams. Feelings of happiness flooded through Dean’s body, triggering an unprecedented pull of ecstasy in him.
Dean perceived every touch, every stir and every sound so acute that his mind whirred. How Cas reacted to him turned him on, threw his head and heart in a turmoil as untamable and powerful as a hurricane. That and only that was how kissing was supposed to feel. Cas‘ hands grasped his cheeks, his thumbs gently stroked his skin. The longer the kisses lasted, the hotter they became. Dean’s whole body blazed. Their tongues played together, the kisses became more heatedly by the second.
I couldn’t say it, couldn’t tell you how I really felt
And then he heard them. A group of men next to them, clearly talking about them. Great, that was all he needed. Assholes. At first they were making catty comments, just talking in generalities about how gays were way too open about their sexuality and how, yes, one couldn’t watch that. He wanted to throw up on the spot.
Castiel wanted to watch the movies his correspondent had mentioned because they had sounded enjoyable. Entertaining movies would lighten his mood, he was sure of it. Right here on his cozy leather armchair, Castiel could not think about anything else anymore. His heart had been warm while reading, so warm. And his soul and mind had felt understood.
At her confused expression, Dean laughed and shook his head. The adrenaline made him talkative again, more talkative than usual.
Castiel chuckled as he remembered their dances in Gabriel’s club and the bar. "Certainly, it was a different kind of dancing there. Line-dancing was practically required. Other than that the moves were often very chaotic and wild and emotion-driven. I enjoyed it although I felt a bit lost at first. These days belong to my favorite memories. But- I presume it’s not wise to dwell in the past too much and to stay so nostalgic.“
And now he finally knew what he would give Cas for Christmas. With a contented smile on his lips, he fell asleep peacefully.
Not purely sexual desire, though Cas had honestly been making him frigging fuzzy-headed and stirred up all day - no, it was this overwhelming urge to have him with him and be good to him.
"You’re very good at this. Did ya often give massages in the past?“
Then he stood up, stopping in front of Castiel. "Don’t do this, Cas.“
"No worries, I’m not here to get into your pants although I could see why one would. You must have a way with the guys, probably have them swallowing your tongue and licking that full lips of yours after the second drink.“
"You have to walk carefully in this weather, the forest is unpredictable.“
Later, Cas remarked that he’d like to watch "Love Actually“ because he had read in an article how beautifully the pre-Christmas season and interpersonal relationships were portrayed in the movie. For the umpteenth time, Dean wondered where Cas always found these articles, and more importantly, what he was searching for to come across such results in the first place.
"There will also be our other ride,“ Cas said. "You wanted to show me a place.“
His eyes scanned him once from top to bottom, finally lingering on his face. "Dude, you have flour in your face. You’re a lifelike painting of falling snow. How’d you manage to achieve that, huh?“ Before Castiel could say something or even blink, he felt Dean’s thumb on forehead, his cheeks and then on his nose.
Now had happened what he had no longer dared to hope for. Why did he hope at all? Maybe the other person wrote to him only to rebuke him, to ask him if he had gone completely crazy, to send him such a long message out of nowhere. Castiel didn’t want to admit it but he was quite excited – and started reading.
(See the end of the chapter for
Dean smirked and stopped his smiling as soon as she was back on her seat, now showing the book they were reading. Gordon gave Pamela a long look and a grin appeared on his face. Oh! They were fucking - or at least almost fucking if Dean’s perception didn’t betray him which happened seldom. Way to go, Gordon, she’s a pistol, he thought to himself and concentrated on Pamela’s words.
It was also peculiar that Cas was also out of town, and that he seemed to be abroad when Dean could believe Gabriel’s explanations from the day before. These coincidences were getting out of hand.
However, he took a closer look at the profile photo. Pictured was a man with brown hair who could only be seen from behind. Castiel noticed that this man had a very attractive back with muscles showing through the T-shirt, broad shoulders and upper arms that gave him goosebumps. He was probably sitting on the hood of a car because the horizon and, very prominently, a road were visible in the background.
Dean furrowed his eyebrows, checked the phone because he had nothing better to do than drowning in alcohol and thoughts anyway. No, it wasn’t Charlie.
“I broke up with him.“ Then she looked at him sweetly, putting her hand on his left upper arm. He didn’t like this situation. Somehow the conversation developed rapidly in a very intimate direction. Why did that bother him so much?
Dammit. He didn’t get any further that way. Screw this. He picked up his cell phone and tried calling Cas 10 times. He didn’t pick up. Dean scoffed. This wasn’t good. He threw his pride overboard and texted Cas.
Yeah, he understood what Angel had meant. The song was perfect for his situation. All the lyrics fit so well, all of them.
The final scenes played, the resolution, and suddenly, it was all too much. Frodo’s departure always made him feel so melancholic, and he had to turn his head away because there was the traitorous tear again. It got even worse, as soon as he saw Samwise who had his family and was able to tell his own stories in the future and write them down in the book. He identified with that.
“I'm happy that you aren’t mad at Dean anymore,” one of the children observed.
“Dean,” Cas softly interrupted him. “I’m sure your brother wouldn’t have thought you were a failure, even if you didn’t choose to go to college… College isn’t the only way to succeed in life, or to be happy.”
And indeed, Dean got caught up in it, enthusiastically commenting on the habits and rituals of the animals described in the first episode. Cas watched his reactions fondly; he had already seen the documentary, anyway. And he was tired. So tired. And watching documentaries always relaxed him, and Dean was also making him relaxed, and he fell asleep without even noticing it.
"I had many things in mind, the keys for example. In the end, I figured there was only one thing I could give you. Only one thing that matters.“ As Cas looked at him, absorbing every word he said with so much sincerity and love, Dean gulped.
"Stop it with your nonsense. You told me you were happy.“ Dean wanted to scream that he was happy, until Cas had showed signs to abandon him again.
He told Cas this little anecdote and the angel seemed to be downright entertained by it. As a matter of fact he laughed so sweetly, Dean had to hold away the phone for a moment because his heart was so full of endorphins. How was it that this simple, wonderful conversation thrilled and mesmerized him so much more than any meaningless sex he could’ve had today?
He reached into his pocket, slamming a few dollar bills on the counter before downing the drink.
As he studied what felt like 50 different bottles this store offered, Dean noted how incredibly good his mood was by now.
Not everything was "normal“ again, but this special familiarity between the two had instantly re-established itself. And that did him a world of good. He smiled slightly.
So Dean did what he always thought he could do best: He tried to seduce Cas into kissing. For starters, he put his arm around Cas’ shoulders and leaned against him, and Cas, the innocent dude, just asked if he needed another cushion.
We made out after that. And I felt so confident. I mean, I usually am, but I was still in the absolute trial-and-error-phase back then (hell, still am). Oh, he was hot. Well, anyway. I wasn’t gonna tell you details about that stuff. We only smooched, by the way.
"Right. Sorry 'bout that.“
"Honestly, I don’t know what to say. And I don’t want to fight.“
Hiring a roofer would have cost him quite a bit of money after all, plus the next possible deadline was still far in the future. Fortunately, the whole roof did not have to be redone, although there were many tiles to be replaced or installed at all. Garth lay on his stomach and tried to clear off broken tiles.
He had rattled all this off so quickly that he feared the boy had not understood him. He put the plate on the table, still feeling strange. He was used to caring, but he really couldn’t handle going into a happy family situation and disrupting it.
"With your daughter?“ inquired Hanna curiously.
Only his instinct told him what he had to do next. Their tongues carried out a real game. They kissed and kissed each other. With each meeting of their tongue tips, his belly contracted wonderfully, he thought he must burst.
"Yeah, that’s the right spirit. I was thinking you suddenly lost your euphoria. I mean, you were the one who wanted to make it as Christmassy as possible. Since Cas will celebrate with us,“ Sam reminded Dean. Oh, Sam was such a little piece of shit, sometimes. He knew exactly how to tease him.
Dean just stared at Bobby and frowned. "I’m not sure I’m following.“
"Yes?“ Castiel replied, unable to follow her train of thought.
"Castiel,“ Castiel called out to Dean, but his voice was completely lost in the volume of the music and the people singing and shouting. Faced with the cheering crowd, the song now played another time, and people only sang louder.
Dean grinned. "You’re something else, ya know that?“ Dean shook his head.
Maybe it had not been the best idea to work on the 65 Chevy Corvette Stingray until 4 a.m. last night. However, she was such a beauty, and he just loved working on her so much. When the owner had brought the car into the workshop, Dean had been baffled. For two minutes he had stroked the long hood and inspected the windsplit. Smiling dreamily at the memory, he threw Charlie a glance who finally decided to interrupt her dramatic pause.
Dean could barely swallow. His throat hurt like hell, and he was feeling as if he had a small razor blade in his throat. Something was fucking wrong here, and he would find out what it was. He tried a different approach.
Although Electra was at times a morally difficult character worthy of discussion, Castiel understood what Rambler was trying to tell him. That he also undertook a vendetta against his adversaries. In his own way, Rambler was often enough a dork himself, he thought to himself.
Castiel laughed, and suddenly, he burst into a fit of laughter. This conversation, the talk about the last happy memory with his foster sister, had turned into this absurd dialogue which amused him so much that he wanted to kiss Dean on the spot.
"Because you like women?“ Castiel asked, feeling horrible once more.
And Castiel was convinced that fate existed, at least as far as they were concerned. Dean’s inner beauty shone in every fiber of his being, showed in his every reaction, action, and expression.
"That’s the geekiest drinking game I’ve ever heard of. You sure it’s real? Sounds like you’ve invented it for the both of us.“
Again Cas kissed him. Dean was already shaky on his feet in the face of his passion. Then Dean just looked at him for a long time.
At the same moment he received the message, “
"I’ll never get used to your gorgeous eyes. Could never live without the sight,“ he consequently admitted. Cas tilted his head, smiling broadly. "Well, it is a good thing you don’t have to then.“
At the car Dean smiled and congratulated Cas for his choice. Then he approached him, took his hand again and intertwined their fingers once more. "We’re not out there anymore, and we already got our hot drinks,“ Cas remarked.
"I was jealous earlier,“ Dean whispered into the silence.
"Don’t fall!“ Dean shouted after him, grinning to himself. Contentedly, he threw himself back into the big cushions of the sofa, and put his feet down on the leather stool.
At that moment, his heart ached so much, longed for Rambler so much, that he felt dizzy. In order to do something meaningful, he made himself a late dinner. For indeed he had not eaten since early afternoon. Of course, as he cooked in the middle of the night, he reflected on Rambler’s cooking tips and recipes that he had sent him on so many occasions.
This man, who seemed to enjoy swearing a lot, captivated Castiel immensely. He was honest, not at a loss for words, and had to be incredibly smart. He seemed to know the library very well, memorized the positions of books because Castiel was sure that the author of this wonderful note had known the position by heart. Good memory, analytical thinking - Castiel was intrigued. He had to learn more, and so he continued to pursue this scavenger hunt.
“The problem isn’t that you weren’t interested in her, it’s that she basically forced you, which is absolutely not okay. And frankly, this advice your coworkers gave you? They are the worst!”
“What are you looking at so intensely, Cas? See something you like?”
“It’ll come with time,” a guy assured. “Remember when you first came to one of our meetings a few months ago, you didn’t even know you were gay, you were just questioning… And look at you now, being out and proud, coming out to your best friends! You’ve come a long way!”
He winked and Cas felt himself blushing furiously.
Cas smiled lightly. He wasn’t feeling
DEAN: “Is that your way of asking me on a date ? 😉”
How the situation had changed, a few months later! Cas had been so shy, so ill-at-ease that first day, not knowing how to interact with that very handsome but very unknown stranger that had seemed so confident, as if he could achieve anything, while Cas was hidden in his room, freaking out about the first information meeting for the volunteering program.
He winked, and once again, Cas realized how close to him Dean was. What was happening? Was he flirting with him? Flustered, he pointed at the bread.
7 am. He parked Baby in front of the bunker. Opened the trunk to grab what he bought and gasped when he saw a bag that he didn’t put there himself. It was a bag with two matching Christmas sweaters from Walmart. Dean realized that Cas must have bought them the day before and forget them in Baby. He smiled: this was perfect!
“Okay, hello everyone! My name’s Dean, and here is my partner, Cas. We will be in charge of this group for the entire school year. You can drop off your children by 1:45 pm, but we will only start the activities at 2, until 4. Cas and I would like to offer a little snack at the end of each session; we’ll be getting in touch with the CLCP organization to implement that. Basically, every week we’ll help the children with their homework for about one hour, and then we’ll offer them some activities: sports, creative workshops, board games… We’ll change activities every week so that every kid can do something they enjoy! Of course, we’ll adapt according to the childrens’ preferences. Does anyone have any questions?”
“It was just a matter of time. When Cas became human, I assumed the two of you would finally figure out your feelings quicker, actually.”
Now, Dean sounded shocked and disappointed, and even a little bit hurt.
Dean was looking at his feet, but he could feel the intensity of Cas’s stare. He hesitated for a moment before answering, unsure :
“Well, maybe you could… If you’re not in a hurry, of course… And if you’d like to give it to him yourself… Come inside and wait for him?”
“No problem,” Charlie repeated. “Just feel free to intervene at any moment of the discussion, or to even interrupt me to ask a question if there’s something you don’t understand. We might use some vocabulary that you won’t know, but you can find the definitions of all those words on our website. I can send you the link, if you want.”
"Yeah, why not."
His strategy was working until, on Sunday morning, he ran into Balthazar in the kitchen.
However, now, Cas was human, and Cas was apparently interested in dating… And moreover, interested in dating men. Could Dean actually have a chance?
Cas burst out laughing as he opened the door. "I saw you two interacting last week at the bar, and far be it from me to turn my living room into a war zone, don't worry!”
“Oh, I’m not worried. But here’s a little piece of advice: maybe try to sleep more. You look terrible!”
Cas nodded. The woman smiled. “It’s the right room, come in!”
him? At least, it was a possibility. A new hopeful sensation started to slowly grow into Dean’s chest.
“Sorry Ben, all good things must come to an end! But we'll see you next week, so don't forget to bring your school stuff and homework! Otherwise, Cas won’t be happy!” He winked, giving Cas a sidelong glance.
CAS: “Does that qualify as a date?”
Cas nodded and followed him outside.
“So? What do you think?”
Cas winced. Of course. Not everyone was lucky to have wealthy parents like him. Dean would probably think he was just a daddy’s boy who didn’t have any sense of reality, to assume that everyone could afford a beautiful private fully equipped kitchen like the one he was sharing with Balthazar.
“Okay Dean, I’ll take care of Jack, maybe you can go back inside with the other kids and maybe give them some board games or put some cartoons on TV or something? We don’t want them to start panicking. And since we don’t know how bad Jack is hurt yet, no need to call anyone for now. It probably isn’t very bad, and Jack is probably just scared.”
Cas looked at him, his eyes sparkling. It wasn't a date, and he couldn't be that emotional. Even when Dean made him feel like he was the hero of a romantic comedy.
“What?” Dean asked.
“What? Me? No, no, of course not,” Cas choked.
Dean to Sam: “I don’t know what gift-giving to Cas! Can’t find anything meaningful at the convenience store!”
“Your boyfriend?” Balthazar asked suspiciously, looking alternately between Dean and Cas, slowly connecting the dots.
"The deal?" repeated Cas, tilting his head slightly.
Dean quickly noted down the ingredients he needed to do the cooking, cleaned the kitchen and shook Cas’s coat to remove the flour that was on it. Thirty minutes later, he met Cas, who was only wearing a black tee-shirt.
Balthazar’s entrance into the kitchen broke the moment.
“That’s so Dean of you, Dean. By the time you get your diploma, half of the university will have visited your dorm!” she joked.
The kids enthusiastically expressed their agreement, and Cas watched them walk away. He couldn’t believe that a few minutes ago, Dean was on the verge of panicking, and that right now he was so confidently and strongly taking care of the kids. It was impressive.
“What? But what are we…?”
Cas had been smiling, half-joking with his last sentence, however, as he crossed Charlie’s gaze, instead of reading in her eyes the confirmation that his secret was safe, he saw her eyes widen and her expression freeze. Cas immediately understood that something was wrong. He felt the first signs of a wave of panic starting to rise.
“Um...Do you need some help?” he offered, hoping he wasn’t being too invasive.
“Leave your coat here, I’ll take care of it”.
“You won’t look ridiculous, Cas. This tie enhances your eyes. But I’ll help you wear it casually. Don’t wear the suit pants, but black jeans instead, and… You can take the jacket if you’re afraid of being cold, but don’t keep it on during the party. And don’t tighten your tie too much!”
Cas instantly switched back to “professional mode”, a little bit embarrassed to have been caught joking with Dean by a parent.
“Sorry, I’m late,” said a voice that sounded familiar to Cas.
He attached a picture of the apple pie. It really looked good, but Cas wasn’t a pie expert, and no matter the photo he would have received, he would have thought it looked nice, because Dean had been the one baking it.
“I’m in no hurry,” Cas answered, echoing Dean’s words from a few hours ago.
“You’re not mad at me?”
Cas smiled, relieved.
He looked at Charlie, because of course, that last sentence was for her. He wasn’t an idiot, and Charlie wasn’t an idiot either, and there was no way she didn’t know he was talking about Dean. However, even though she was one of Dean’s closest friends, Cas trusted her to not tell him what she heard. He only had to hope that she wasn’t the kind of person to get chatty once she was drinking alcohol…
“Hey, Cas”, he answered, finishing his drink, getting ready to leave.
“Maybe Balthazar referred to me as ‘Cas’? That’s what my friends call me.”
Cas rolled his eyes. “I was asking whether you could help me to shave again. This morning? If you’re not busy.” He took his eyes off Dean to look in the mirror, feeling his cheeks for the rough hairs that were growing back. If Dean was completely honest, he liked Cas' three-day-old beard -- maybe a little too much, in fact -- but Cas preferred his skin smooth. That was how he used to be
Dean cleared his throat, lowering his gaze as if on cue, before staring at him again. As if just confirming his statement, they held eye contact again. It was long and intense, indeed.
“Okay, that’s awesome,“ he muttered, forcing himself to stay calm. "You want some coffee?“ Cas didn’t answer, instead he took a cup out of the kitchen cabinet and filled it with coffee.
“Testing?” Dean couldn’t help but ask after all.
“ Castiel fell into a fit of laughter after reading this one.
"Do you want me to breathe with you?“
Had she just said Cassia? Dean’s heart contracted painfully because, of course, with the name resemblance and the plot overall he had to think of Cas.
Dean finally makes a move on Cas – and they kiss. :)
He went to a park and walked for a while. His cell phone vibrated. He was expecting another message from Bobby who seemed especially concerned about him today.
M’kay, confession time. Ya remember what I told ya about me not liking streaming services? Yeah, my point still stands. Duh. But I might have made myself a playlist the other day. It’s called "Top Angel traxx“. (To be honest, that’s just the official name. Wanna know the secret one? ;-))
"Yeah, same goes for you, cowboy.“ Dean cleared his throat again, turned down the volume. "So- She still hasn’t contacted you again after her harsh text?“
Sam eyed him strangely when Dean could no longer sit still. Every few seconds he would get up from the chair, move to the next chair, settle down. Then he walked through the hallways and rooms again, stopping in the middle of the room.
The more symbolic the pictures became, the more he felt. The pictures became more colorful, more chaotic, and at the same time more captivating. All of them told a story.
“Okay. Let’s try.” Cas sighed. Then he sighed again and reached for his hand.
Dean grinned widely and purred. Dammit, now he couldn’t back away anymore.
Dean and Sam go on a hunt. After the hunt Dean enjoys texting and phoning with Cas. Also he realizes some things - concerning the little surprises he gets and his feelings.
When "Life For Rent“ by Dido came on, Dean winced and changed the radio station. All the memories that he tried to not think about all the time in everyday life, were now settling in him like burdocks.
"Good teachers tend to rub off on people from time to time,“ Cas answered. That had to be a reference to his text the other day, it had to be. Cas remembered everything.
There were so many things he wanted to write, so many aspects he had thought of in the last hour alone that he felt the urge to immediately write all his musings down. Moreover, he wanted to look for the TVs since RambleOnIm67 had actually sent him suggestions in a second message. He was a man true to his word, a fact Castiel liked a lot.
"You don’t say.“ Then Dean lowered his head and whispered, "Just follow my lead. We’re getting the best tree they have.“
Dean sighed, apparently considering his next words. "Naah, of course it ain’t wrong. I guess I was just under the impression you like women, if anyone at all.“
"Me, too. We’ll continue next time. I’ll bring your flannel along.“
Dean moaned into his mouth, and it was a sound that made all of Castiel’s hairs stand up. He felt warmth inside him, so much warmth, and he knew nothing would ever come close to those feelings. So he kissed him more feverishly, wanted to show Dean which emotions he caused in him.
"And I know frontal ones for emergencies.“ Demonstratively, Castiel sent a glance to the other’s groin, then nodded toward his shoes. Defense was ultimately the only response Castiel had internalized and mastered in his sleep.
Instead, he turned back again, unable to find the strength to go to the library that day. He knew the faculty libraries, had loved moving between them then, finding new knowledge everywhere. But today, today he didn’t want to think.
Castiel also thought about the blue moon as such since it didn’t often occur and therefore was associated with rarity.
Fortunately, apart from the aforementioned articles, which the other would hopefully not mourn for too long, nothing had happened. Except for Dean’s shock, which was still far too deep. Blood had rushed to his cheeks as fast as a rocket, and he took a (perhaps more extended) look at the man.
"But...“, Castiel continued, not understanding the meaning of Dean’s words. "You wanted to kiss me too, didn’t you?“ It became apparent that he had no real experience with kissing.
Dean led them to a table which looked cozy enough, and they sat down. They ordered burgers, the biggest ones the diner had to offer.
Cas laughed into the kiss, and Dean snorted. “How long have you been awake, you traitor?”
He got exactly that, medical bills for the treatments and all the check-ups (many, many of 'em) were expensive, but I figured he would be better. And he was better, for a while. Then, all out of a sudden, it got worse again. Doctor said the only way to actually save him was surgery. He meant that literally cause without the surgery my brother would die.
What also warmed my heart was your anecdote from your vacation. It’s nice that you still think back fondly on that memory, that it was a reason to embrace your sexuality. I thought I’d do the same, tell you a few things about it.
Castiel’s body tingled with each breath that caressed his skin, and he let himself sink deep into the other’s arms. "I’m Dean, by the way,“ he murmured in his ear from behind, and Castiel automatically slid Dean’s fingers to his stomach. Dean. It could mean leader or valley. A grounded person. He liked that name.
Real life obligations can be very exhausting at times, and writing always helps me to relax. :) Therefore, your encouragement means a lot to me, all your lovely reactions and comments made my week. Thank you so much for the support! :)
"I’m an idiot, okay? Was so glad you called. So thrilled,“ Dean whispered. "I left the bunker right away, dropped everything. I wanted to see you, needed to see you. It’s true, I’d do it again, send you away. But because I have to, not because I want to. That’s a huge difference, Cas.“
"I should call your parents,“ he said as she sipped her cocoa. Her expression darkened. "No way.“ Dean groaned, massaging his temples. He should have guessed, a runaway. "You ran away from home.“
"Your date. The- I didn’t like the thought. I thought I had to - you know, make you smile. And I fucking failed at that. And I know I’m a mess and an ass. I know. I am so sorry, Cas. You gotta believe me.“ Dean sniffled and made an annoyed noise. Castiel moved out of the embrace, propping himself up on his arm so he could look at Dean. "I believe you,“ Castiel said.
Apropos fascinating: I have to learn more stuff about you, dork. You have some great hair, there, as far as I can see that. I’d love tousling through it while kissing. Um, that came out wrong. Your profile is also attractive. Mm. Can you tell me more about you?
A few days later Dean and Sam came back to the bunker, and somehow everything was different. They spent time together, but Dean behaved weirdly, was even more silent about his inner state than usual.
“Is that good or bad?“
Urgently, he knocked at Dean’s door.
That night I felt so free. I mean, if there hadn’t been those two mind-blowing and magical nights this year (which really were a whole other level of freedom, believe me), I would’ve considered it the freest state I’ve ever felt. Well, it’s still in the top 5, though.
And so he took the pen and opened the notebook Bobby had given him. He chewed on the pen and paused. Then he wrote without once setting it down. He wrote and wrote, the pen flying over the paper and quickly filling half a page. A whole page. Two pages.
"You look tired, Dean.” Cas looked at him, but Dean just lifted his hand.
"I understand,“ Castiel said because he hadn’t expected such a response. Usually people like Balthazar merely criticized his outfit choices, or eyed him strangely when he appeared anywhere wearing them. He had never understood those reactions because he really liked the coat and it was a part of him.
Cas looked up again and somehow their eyes met. He tilted his head the way he always did, then he smiled and nodded at him. That was nice. They looked at each other for a few more seconds before Cas studied the pages in front of him again, apparently searching for the next part he wanted to read.
He returned with his western guitar he’d bought two years back to practice in secret. Furthermore, he had written this thing down in the notebook - Cas‘ surprise from early December.
She seemed a bit shy, but had a very friendly demeanor.
"I wasn’t in a magazine. I was simply in my car, I told you that. Another angel might be able to put me into this "fashion magazine" setting – like Gabriel did for instance. But I assure you, that was not the case this morning. I would have told you about such an experience immediately. You have to believe...“
There will be more real-life-chaos next time. :)
They swayed back and forth as Green Eyes hummed to the sounds of the chorus. Deep, warm and honey-like, his voice sounded against Castiel’s skin. In doing so, his nose always brushed his neck and chin.
"You know- You didn’t have to get me anything for Christmas. Nothing at all. And the surprises this month, they were great, hell, more than great. But you being here with me? That’s the only thing I need. It’s the only damn thing I want for myself in this world.“
“You know I support him. I’m doing the best-“
Despite all the stress, Castiel felt good. He wasn’t as agitated because he knew Rambler was still there. With him. Of course he worried about his conversation partner, his hē kalḗ pneuma, but the other seemed much more at peace with himself. He seemed so strong, so tranquil because he stood up to his father. Castiel felt so much pride and warmth and happiness.
Life wasn’t life without you any longer
Dean spent the morning with (unnecessarily) sharpening the knife and practicing his throwing techniques on a tree outside the bunker.
"Fuck, feels so good,“ Dean muttered between two kisses. "Kissing. Closeness. You.“
They pulled apart, only smiling, staring again, because yeah, that was still their thing, apparently, even or especially after all those years.
No answer. Castiel closed his eyes, not knowing what the right response was. "Do you want me to leave?“
"I enjoyed that too. A lot. I don’t understand why you would...“
Suddenly, Dean seemed changed, as his entire posture relaxed and just invited Castiel in. He wore that mischievous laugh on his lips again, the one that made Castiel’s lips tingle irrevocably. Dean dried his hands, grinned broadly at him one more time, and pulled him into a hug. His body was warm and he smelled good.
Cas squinted his eyes. "Dean, you told me Baby is the most valuable thing you own. Why would I harm her?“ The moment Cas referred to Baby as "her“ and personified her like Dean always did was too much for him. It was all too overwhelming.
"I am aware. But you will get used to it.“
All the time he smelled him, more clearly than ever. There was the familiar scent, lemon balm and pine, but also some hints of sweat, a musky tone and remaining tones of his shower foam. Castiel felt, and smelled and heard so much in his mind, in this room and with his heart he suppressed the urge to chuckle and cry simultaneously.
"Of course, Dean,“ Castiel said and out of reflex laid his hand on Dean’s.
Back in the motel Dean couldn’t sleep at first. He went outside and called Cas who picked up after two rings.
Sure, they’d gotten along pretty well, quickly lapsing into easy talks and gushing and heated discussions about all sorts of different cars. That had been fun, but Dean had thought Gabriel would be like that with everyone, not that he actually liked Dean more than other persons. That was unexpected.
What was wrong with him?
I was thinking about what movie I could name you that has made a lasting impression on my mind. In fact, there are a few that maybe we could rediscover together as well. One would certainly be "A Single Man".
Here comes part 12. :) Writing this chapter made me very emotional. The rollercoaster which is their love, I gotta tell you...
"Sorry for that,“ Dean grumbled as they walked to the kitchen. Because of local conditions, only a few inches separated them, and again Castiel grew nervous.
He pulled away from Cas for a moment and studied his face in no time at all. Cas‘ eyes were closed, his mouth slightly opened. Rash breaths came out, a sound Dean had never expected to hear from the angel. And his lips, his lips looked even more plushy than usual. His features were completely relaxed, and Dean couldn’t believe he was the one responsible for this sight.
"Next time it’s your turn, Cas,“ he mumbled, and Castiel could hear the smile in his voice. He really was determined to make him feel good on this road trip, it was heart-warming and wonderful.
Layered in his favorite (slack and worn out) flannel, he sat on the sofa, inspecting his cozy surroundings which were getting even more homey with every day. He loved his little cottage more than anything, and still couldn’t believe that Bobby had just let him have the cottage he had inherited from his wife because, by Bobby’s admission, he already owned a great house. Of course, Dean was aware Bobby also had tried to not think about his wife too much at that point in the past.
Although he was looking forward to the upcoming appointments, he was a little dreading all the days he wouldn’t be home. The rest of November would keep him busy, especially on the weekends and sometimes during the week as well.
"I feel splendid. I am adapting well to the cirumstances. And I feel everything. You, always you.“ Cas sighed contentedly.
"Wishing (If I Had A Photograph Of You)“ by A Flock Of Seagulls (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opkzgLMH5MA)
Suddenly, the interior darkened. A short time later, all that could be seen were small candles and lanterns that had been placed and lit all around. Dean’s eyes roamed, admiring the impressive ceiling beams, made even more captivating by the magical lighting. Cas shifted in his seat, apparently also touched by the change of atmosphere. Then the concert began and Dean lost himself. Forgetting all the bad, he felt only the moment and thought of Cas, realizing that he was really sitting here with his angel.
Many of the guy’s answers sounded somewhat similar since this man seemed to know nothing about fan culture. For example, for the part of his "house“, meaning his Hogwarts house, he had written, "
"Come again?“ Sam asked with a grin as Dean sat down.
"Perfect,“ Dean remarked after taking a few steps up and down. He turned in a circle, looking at himself in front of the mirror.
Then he recited the first excerpt, and Dean listened spellbound to his words. Immediately he found himself in the plot he had followed so many times by now. By the second excerpt, he was getting so emotional again.
A smile spread on his lips. "Come home, sunshine. We gotta talk in person, you and I. About us.“
"Yeah. I know that. Thanks. Otherwise I wouldn’t have told you. Anyway. I didn’t just tell you this for selfish reasons. I mean, yeah, I wanted you to know, so you would understand me better.“
"I’m not a philanderer. And as I just mentioned, my "love life" is nonexistent right now.“ Castiel would have had a few opportunities for uninhibited nights out in recent months. A couple of men had hit on him aggressively after evening events, but he had been rather turned off, having since gotten over his short-lived one-night-stand phase after coming out.
A message from AngelMuses.
"Is everything alright with you?“ Cas asked.
holy shit, we’re doing this whole "Dear“-salutation-used-for-actual-letters-thing now, huh? Not gonna lie, this made my stomach flutter in the best way. But yeah, "dear“ is obviously more personal and intimate, kinda the thing we’re going for here. :-)
"A bottle of Cuban rum?“ Castiel replied dryly. He counted the seconds, knowing what was coming now.
"The Way To Your Heart" by Soulsister (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzyKYekdKBk)
Dean’s heartbeat quickened, and for a moment he forgot the anger he had felt so acutely in the dream. Cas looked at him, as intensely and curiously as ever, but Dean also recognized something else in his expression, in his whole attitude: caution. Great, now he was already scaring an Angel of the Lord. Dean had come a long way in his miserable life.
“Do you- do you think about your parents right now? And about Meg? I mean- since we’re driving to Boston.”
And so Dean checked in and strolled around town on foot. In fact, he even went out to eat and treated himself to a good meal. A delicious steak with fries and salad, the dressing of which he could’ve easily drank because it was so tasty.
In retrospect, it had been so damn obvious.
"Nah. Have been wanting to invite you for dinner for such a long time. Just lemme take care of you, 'kay?“
"Have a look,“ Dean said, feeling so nervous he shortly thought about running out of the cave again.
Unwillingly, Dean broke away from him, locked eyes with Cas the way they always did and almost sank to the floor when he drank in Cas’s appearance. Cas’s eyes sparkled, his face glowed like a light in a field of darkness. He swallowed. Cas’s cheeks carried a lovely red. His lips were swollen, and Dean grinned like a Cheshire cat because he was responsible for that sight.
And yes, Castiel knew that he had fallen for Dean, that he had never felt like this in the presence of another person. It was his essence that made him forget everything else, while their physical intimacy amplified that sensation. Every kiss between them triggered an unimagined tingling in his body, every touch ignited an unprecedented fire in him.
Was the fact Cas wrote this book the reason he felt so comfortable with Cas since the very beginning? The reason he felt like he knew him?
Normally, his tougher side that was so deeply ingrained in him would have loathed himself for these schmaltzy associations, but frankly he didn’t care at all.
"Your research funds for next semester have been approved, by the way.“
Now he already heard Balthazar in his thoughts. The imaginary Balthazar was right, as he often was. He had been able to finish his crime novel, he just needed enough rest and inspiration to inspire him again.
“Benny,“ Dean threatened. “Please don’t embarrass me, I really don’t need that right now.“
He wasn’t sure how he was supposed to interpret this surprise. This one seemed to be more intimate, more personal – and he liked it. A lot. Son of a bitch, he felt vulnerable and soft, and he was somehow convinced that was the exact thing Cas had wanted him to feel.
Right now he felt free, enjoyed the cool breeze on his face and watched nature around him with fascination.
Anyway. I went down again after a few songs. And then he stood right in front of me, told me his shift was over, said some cute compliments. And then we just danced. There were those songs in the background I can never forget. "On The Floor" and stuff like that. Oh fuck. It was hot dancing. Mmm. Never danced that dirtily in my entire life.
We’ll have another glimpse at Castiel’s life (and at Gabriel ;)) – and of course, you’ll read Dean’s (pretty long) reply.
Oh damn.
The quote Cas mentions in the end is from the book "The Prophet".
"Oh. When was that?“ Dean inquired softly.
Castiel also told Dean more about Gabriel. About his many attempts to gain success, always trying out new things until he had decided to open "Loki’s Den“. The interieur, the music choices, his staff and his entire strategy had worked out so well that he had opened a cafe as well. Furthermore, Castiel told Dean about Balthazar and the many hours they had spent discussing and bickering about trivial topics like a new shop around the corner, always using the deepest argumentation to convince the other of being right. This had led to many absurd outcomes.
As they moved back and forth and the song played over and over, as they never stopping moving toward and into each other, Dean felt pure bliss. Happy at last.
And yes, I chose the cheesy song in the chapter's beginning on purpose. We're climbing the "blissway" after all :D
All made sense which had happened in the past
Grumbling, Dean made the second cocoa, checked to make sure the milk was hot enough. "Not today.“ He couldn’t keep making Sam with these excuses forever, he knew that, but on this day he wasn’t in the mood for draining discussions.
“That’s amazing, Aaron, we’re so proud of you! How did they react?”
Cas nodded, trying to look calm and collected when both his heart and his mind were racing. He repeated to himself that it wasn’t a date. It wasn’t a date. It was just two friends going to a basketball game together. Those kinds of things happened all the time. Plus, Dean’s other friends would be there. It would be full of Dean’s friends. Cas was just another friend among all of Dean’s friends, and Dean had a lot of friends. How many of them would be there?
"Uh, well, I don't know if you noticed, Cas, but normal humans don't do that."
“I just wanted to say, to follow up on last week’s conversations… I finally decided to come out as gay to my friends.”
Of course. As if Cas was going to bother Dean with his ridiculous questions and worries...
Dean nodded. “Yeah, sounds good. I don’t think I can drive, though.”
Which was true, and there was no point in Dean denying it, so he preferred to remain silent. This lack of response surprised Cas, and the two men stared at each other for a long time, before Cas finally started again.
Dean kept staring at him for a few seconds – which seemed interminable to Cas – almost in a challenging way, before moving back slightly, shaking his head and breaking the eye contact.
Unluckily, when he turned off the shower after rinsing, he heard that someone else was in the bathroom. He had a 50/50 chance. It was either Sam or Cas. After waiting a few seconds to see if the person would leave, he resigned himself to open the door... Only to find Cas' piercing blue eyes - the same ones in the app photo - looking back at him through the bathroom mirror.
He stopped talking when he saw that Dean was staring at him, smiling widely.
For asexuality, it was different. He didn’t know any other asexuals in real life. And it seemed way more complicated than being gay. He knew for a fact that he preferred boys to girls, he never had any doubt about that. But was he experiencing sexual attraction? How could he know that? If he never experienced it, how could he know if he didn’t? Sure, sometimes he felt horny and masturbated. It was actually great stress and anxiety relief, and it felt good. But he couldn’t identify what made him “horny”. He never felt the urge to masturbate in reaction to seeing a “hot” guy, even half-naked in a movie. He never really watched porn; he didn’t see the appeal of it. And even with the guys he had crushes on, he never pictured himself having sex with them, never wanted to.
, Cas thought bitterly, but he said nothing.
“I like tea, it’s relaxing!” Cas defended himself.
Dean came into the room as Cas was making Jack choose what kind of design he wanted on the band-aid.
Forty-five minutes later, after his stomach gurgled for the fourth time in ten minutes, he finally decided to look away from his phone and to get up. He took a deep breath and opened the door, ready to face the crowd waiting for him outside his room. He was surprised to see that the corridor was dark, and by the relative feeling of quietness in it. He could hear people talking in the living room, but no one was actually shouting or singing. It wasn’t a big party. Luckily, he didn’t need to go through the living room to get to the kitchen. He crossed the corridor and walked past the open door of the room where the gathering was taking place. He glanced into the room: four students, including Balthazar, were sitting around the table, in the middle of a poker game. Around them, two girls were carefully watching the game with beers in their hands. Finally, a boy and a girl - probably a couple, given their proximity - were sharing the leftover pizzas, sitting on the couch. No one seemed to notice Cas, so he dashed to the kitchen, relieved that he wouldn’t have to socialize. He opened one of the high cupboards, looking for bread to prepare a sandwich.
Cautiously, he glanced to the side. Judging by Cas’s facial expression, he was pleased with this choice. Shortly after, the other told him how he had attended a congress in the city a few months ago and had immediately taken a liking to the architecture. With much enthusiasm, Cas described to him how much he had enjoyed exploring the city on foot in his free hours, immersing himself in the maritime atmosphere as well. The longer Cas talked, the more Dean found he just couldn’t get enough of his tales.
Instead, he felt arms, Castiel’s arms wrapping around his upper body, and Dean sank into the embrace. Still only sensing, hearing, smelling, but feeling so damn much. "Cas,“ he breathed again, pressing himself closer to the angel. "Cas.“ He mumbled his name over and over, repeated it like a mantra, like he sometimes did in his prayers when Cas was gone for such a long time his yearning self could not bear it anymore. "Amazing angel. You’re. Cas. Save- preserving my self,“ he mumbled in a delirium of joy.
And then Dean pulled him into another embrace, and held him so tightly as if he didn’t want to let him go.
A few seconds passed. The silence that had now fallen was familiar to Castiel. Moments like this always occurred when he spoke quite directly. Most of the time people couldn’t do anything with his absolute depth, just another reason why he appreciated RambleOnIm67 so much.
Here comes chapter 12 - more rambling from RambleOnIm67. :)
“This here is kinda awesome,“ he muttered, before pulling Cas closer.
Wanna tell you more about this stuff, but let’s wait with the rest. Don’t wanna make this all dark. :-)
Dean laughed. "Pal, you’re always very quick with your direct responses.“
After an eternity, they separated, smiling at each other and gasping.
It was ridiculous Dean reflected on this before they had even defined their relationship – still, he couldn’t stop it. He had to ignore his rattling mind, just for now. This had been such an outstanding day so far, Dean couldn’t destroy the mood. Hence, he swallowed his growing panic, and continued commenting on the people standing outside their cars.
"Night, Cas,“ Dean answered, stressing his name so sweetly Castiel’s heart ached.
Therefore, he longed to know more about what Cas was trying to accomplish here. He wanted to be the one person to whom Cas confided such things. "It’s a sugar beet.“ As soon as Cas started talking again, Dean glanced at him from the side.
In the past, he had never cared. He had willfully upheld the injunction their dad had put in place in earlier years.
Breathing was getting harder by the second. He panicked.
He read the other parts quickly until he paused at the favorite show passage.
Armed with fresh clothes and an extra blanket, he went to bed. He pulled the blanket up to his nose and tried to make himself as comfortable as possible in his bedroom. Every time he was about to fall asleep, something would startle him again. It was unbearable!
Dean sighed, rolling back to the surface. "Well, there’s condensate dripping out. Gotta fix this, a broken aircon can cause tons of other problems.“
...“ she burst out. She sounded so incredulous at that, still trying to control her voice.
A few minutes later, he stepped back into the main room looking relatively clean and much neater.
However, there would never be THE perfect time to meet, and every meeting with RambleOnIm67 would be magical and beautiful since it was him Castiel would see. Castiel was sure of it.
*Meaning:
At last, Cas appeared in front of him – as always – and again, he laid on the floor in front of Dean. Dean punched him right in the face, again and again and again, and couldn’t stop. And Cas didn’t fight back, he didn’t fight back. He said something – what?
"I see different works, all telling an unique story. Some captivate with their compelling and complex characters, some are visually and linguistically powerful, others seem confusing at first glance until the hidden motifs reveal themselves. Some works tell of the past, some seek to paint a future, whether realistic or dystopian or dreamlike. Some works are just introspection, some are biographical. Then there are the numerous nonfiction books that try to explain the world in its diversity, always picking out specific aspects.“
Fuck, fuck, fuck. Cas loved him. He didn’t just have any romantic feelings for him. He LOVED him. His angel loved him, Dean Winchester. His heart was beating up to his neck. He had his tongue tied in a knot. He had to reply, had to say something.
Unbelievable, his mind could get so sappy sometimes. In any case, Blue Eyes had a crazy speed on him, almost as if he was flying, had meanwhile arrived at the top of the queue.
In the background Sam was laughing, clearly amused about their bickering. Demonstratively, Cas kept more space between them which was a pity, really. Dean showed Cas how to properly roll the pastry. "You should use your hands, too, from time to time. Some pressure, not too much, and knead it a bit.“
“Laughter is known to be extremely healthy. Wanna share?“
Dean could see how proud his father was of his son and almost started crying. He wrote Angel a short message, letting him know that he would need a few minutes to compose himself. To be able to throw himself back into the tasks with full vigor.
And I agree with you: we are definitely not strangers anymore. In fact, I feel so incredibly close to you - like you’re sitting next to me on my sofa right now. While I have my arms wrapped around you, of course. :-)
Why would AngelMuses even do that? The most probable answer was that he had accidentally found Dean’s profile and thought he was interesting. But why him? That didn’t make any sense, one couldn’t even recognize him in the photo.
Never was there more happiness
He’d always liked Vonnegut’s novel, but now he appreciated the message even more. Free Will, well it was something he’d earned for himself.
Dean caressed his lips tenderly, then wildly, then tenderly again while pressing Cas closer to him. Cas, thereby, returned his kisses feverishly, sighing and moaning in his mouth.
Then he kissed Cas and put all his love and passion into the kiss. With his lips he tonelessly told Cas "I love you“ over and over – the rehearsal, before he would finally say it out loud.
Afterwards, they cleaned the dishes together and talked about this and that. Dean was in a much better mood than last time, but Castiel didn’t dare ask if his family situation had improved meanwhile.
→ I also enjoy this John Mayer live version a lot, it’s beautiful, but it’s more for the quiet hours, not for the club scene I had in mind for this fic :) (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20Ov0cDPZy8)
In the middle he’d put tons of blankets and cushions. Besides, there was the sappiest thing he’d ever done in his life, and he had to make Cas swear to never tell Sam. His brother would never shut up about it, and Dean couldn’t bear this level of annoyance. Out of lametta Dean had constructed a very clumsy, yet definable heart.
"Yes, I liked it. Thank you, man. You’re the best. I’m glad you’re my angel. Can always count on you.“
"Son, is this a particular close friend? Somebody who would not only like to lead conversations with you?“ his mother asked, and Dean snorted at this idiotic choice of words.
"Into the fire,“ he muttered, only now noticing the rest of his surroundings. Again and again, people of all different ages were walking around. Men, women, young people, children, everyone had come together. Castiel quickly made out the reason for this large crowd.
The guy, whose full name Dean still didn’t know, looked at him with concern. Back in the club, he had only understood the beginning of the name. Cas.
"Hey, it’s a thing. If I remember correctly, and trust me I do, there was this awesome guy who invited me for coffee in the middle of the night a while back. I figured coffee would or should be our code word when comfort seems appropriate.“ Dean grinned again, and now Castiel could only return his laughter.
Apparently, somebody had already turned on the radio since music was audible everywhere. In the living room he met Anna again, who shook her head in amusement. Maybe a little flirting would do him some good, he needed to get his mind off things. Dean poked her lightly in the side, whereupon she flinched briefly, but then actually poked back. Facebook in real life. Terrific.
"This is a '67 Chevy Impala?“ Castiel asked, while his heart was beating up to his neck. That was a coincidence. A coincidence. A coincidence?
"The little sounds Cas made distracted him. His humming when he discovered something interesting. The snorts when he found mistakes in the Enochian translations. The frustrated sighs Dean could never quite explain. Every few seconds Dean lifted his head, sneaked a peek at Cas and lowered his eyes again. Getting nervous in his best friend’s presence didn’t alarm Dean. At least, that’s what he spends most days convincing his mind of."
"My last road trip was with Hannah, I think,“ Castiel muttered, not knowing where this sentiment came from.
He thought of all that he had swallowed down and buried deep inside. He thought of the fallen angels, of his time as a human, of his failures. He thought of Dean, of all the memories they had built together, of the fun.
A bit like lime with sweet notes, but also woodsy and fresh. Dean felt overwhelmed by it, this scent aroused him and made him happier than pie. Cas‘ hand felt smoother than expected. There were some rough spots, sure, especially on his knuckles, but other than that Cas’ skin was so soft. He stroked the hand slowly, tried to internalize all parts of it.
Finally, they made it and heaved themselves up the rock, panting. Still out of breath, they rolled onto their backs and stared up at the sky. Apart from the chirping of a few birds, nothing could be heard. The fresh air rushed through Dean, reminding him of the feeling of sticking his head out just after a light rain and instantly taking in the pure, clear air.
She shouldn't think he was watching her change or some sick crap like that. Disgusted, he shook himself, and was set about putting milk on the stove. Soon he heard the hum of the hair dryer in the distance and grinned.
"I know another man who competes with me.“ Now Cas winked at him and laughed smugly, and Dean felt so flustered that he had to look away. He looked at one of the outbuildings of the Gothic Revival church, vehemently studying the English-looking doors, the characteristic stained glass and the wooden floors and stairs that were a real eye-catcher. Jeez, he must be dreaming. So much happiness couldn’t be real. No, he corrected himself, no, Cas actually was better than any dream.
At this moment, he thought that maybe Cas wanted the same as him after all. That Dean maybe didn’t deserve much in life, but he deserved Cas. Because they knew the worst of each other, and they accepted it or learned how to handle it at least. Because they took the imperfections and decided there existed nothing better. Maybe they really were on the same wavelength here, he thought. Maybe.
When he heard these lines, he immediately thought of Rambler, who had long since won his heart over, and for whom he only had to fight his way back to reality. After breakfast, he picked up his luggage and checked out. Lost in thought, he walked through the lobby, which seemed uninviting due to the old wallpaper, tasteless furniture and cold light. It was time he got home.
The next day, when he bumped into Balthazar in the kitchen at lunch, he warned him that Dean would be coming by the next day.
Cas grabbed the bag full of the drinks he prepared and walked towards the car.
Cas nodded. “I will. Thanks!”
“That’s one of the reasons, yes. But it’s not the only one. I come from a rich family, I never had any financial problems, never had to suffer from it when I was a child, but I know that’s not the case for everyone. So it only seems fair to help kids who weren’t as lucky as me. So yes, a way of feeling useful, of helping others. And also a way to challenge me, to get out of my comfort zone. If I only listened to myself, I would spend my evenings and weekends locked in my room to avoid seeing people, because it’s easier and less scary. But… I know I can’t do that forever. That’s not how life is. Sooner or later, I’ll have to face the world, I can’t hide in my room forever, so…”
Cas was abruptly brought back to reality, and his heart tightened. He tried not to look too disappointed. The barista was very beautiful, and she and Dean seemed to get along well. They were probably dating, or would be soon, given how flirty they were. Cas shouldn’t be that disappointed. He barely knew Dean, after all, and it was not as if he would have had any chance with him anyway. Dean probably wasn’t even gay, and he seemed to be so confident, he probably had a lot of experience in relationships. Cas was shy, socially awkward, and he had never had a boyfriend before. Besides, flirty guys like Dean were usually guys who liked to have one-night stands, or even to have sex at all. Cas was not like that. Sure, he would like to have a boyfriend, a cute and nice boy who he could talk to and do romantic things with, like stargazing, going for walks, holding hands, drinking tea, and having cozy dates. He was craving romantic interactions like that, but it obviously wasn't the kind of thing he could expect from Dean. Especially with that sentence about Cas being able to be ruffled
Mrs. Kline, Jack’s mother, just arrived in the corridor when Cas and Jack got out of the kitchen. Jack ran towards her, hugging her.
A wave of cheerful “welcome” echoed Charlie’s voice. Cas smiled shyly.
“Just hurry up, Cas. I’ll clean the kitchen”
Cas gently smiled. “Of course, Dean, we're good!” And Dean's beam was the best answer he could have received.
“Don’t worry, I have your coat and your bag in my car. Your keys will be there, I guess?”
Time flew by very quickly. Each time a batch was baking, Dean would prepare the dough for the next batch, being unexpectedly organized about the process – he was probably used to it. After putting the third – and final – batch in the oven, Dean turned to Cas.
“Thanks, Cas. It means a lot. And…I am completely okay to never have sex again if I can keep being with you”.
And Dean didn't know he was asexual and was uncomfortable talking about sex. Everyone else laughed at his dirty jokes; Cas was the one being weird, and making the situation weird, and Dean didn't deserve that. Dean always had been great and friendly with him, and he had never hidden that he liked flirting with everyone. So really, it was entirely Cas' fault.
“Good.”
Wow. Had Dean really just given him a gift? And something quite personal, not just some random item he just bought. He had given Cas a scarf that belonged to him, that he had already worn before. And he had told Cas it looked good on him – a compliment, once again! Cas’ thoughts were racing, and he wasn’t paying attention to the game anymore. He was replaying Dean calling him “my favorite basketball referee” again and again, when he heard the scream. He jumped, startled, trying to understand what had happened.
Okay so the guy wasn’t even trying to seduce him anymore? It was almost offensive to Dean at this point. That said, it didn't really surprise him: of course he couldn't compete with Cas. Dean couldn't blame Tom. Besides, he wasn't even interested in him. Sure, Tom was attractive, and the idea of finally being able to openly flirt with a man was very appealing to Dean, but...something was holding him back, and he couldn't explain what. Tom had probably understood that Dean was not in the mood, and that is why he was trying to get more information about Cas.
“Dean, it’s alright. I forgive you”
Cas raised an eyebrow. “I’m not so sure of that, Dean…”
“Well played, Dean!”
“Good night, see you tomorrow.”
Cas rolled his eyes and scanned the group. Everyone seemed very interested in the conversation. Only Raphael was acting more distant, obviously annoyed. Cas discreetly decided to join him, not wanting to hear more about Dean’s sexual history, which only reminded him how he could never be with Dean – considering that sex wasn’t what he was looking for in a relationship and it was obvious that it was something that Dean enjoyed.
“Because, you know I love you, and I really like Dean, too, he's a great guy, but... I'm not sure you're both looking for the same things, in a relationship... I mean, I don't know, I don't know him that much, and never asked him, but... Just be careful, Cas, okay?”
"You've been avoiding me, Dean," Cas asserted.
“It’s not completely official… yet.” Meg blushed.
“Oh, yes, sorry Cas, I didn’t even explain the basics to you!” he realized, a little embarrassed. “But don’t worry, by the end of the game, you’ll be an expert! So, basketball 101: there are two teams, five players on the court and the goal is to score by throwing the ball into the basket…”
Usually, Cas would have laughed at the situation. A party, in a bar, only with people he didn't know? Balthazar himself knew that Cas would never come. However, for the first time, he didn't deny the proposition immediately.
The other people were still busy with the chairs. After hesitating a few seconds, Cas took a step.
Cas wasn’t understanding. Did he say something wrong? What did he do? He re-read the texts he sent, not getting what had shocked Dean.
“Yes, I’m studying biology, but next year I hope to join the pre-med program.”
“So we have the peanut butter ones, the almond ones, and, your favorite, the chocolate ones, right?” Dean summed up, once they had tasted all the cookies.
“I don’t need him to “take care” of me!” Cas exclaimed. “I already told you, I’m not interested in sex. And you said yourself that Dean was not the kind of guy to date the same person more than three times. We’re not looking for the same thing!”
"I really want to learn, Dean," Cas protested.
“Oh, no, Dean, I have my credit card, I can totally…”
“See? It’s already over,” Cas said, removing the gauze. He looked at the wound – now that it was clean, he could see it was really superficial. There was still a little bit of blood, so he decided to put on a band-aid.
“Charlie?”
“Have a good day.”
“If you found him interesting back then, then I’m glad I interrupted you so that you could see Raphael’s real face.”
Cas finished his bite before talking, thinking about what he was going to answer.
"No, I don't... This is the first time I've ever been to a game," Cas confessed.
“The whole outfit, actually, and the attitude, too,” Dean kept going. “Neat and tidy and all…”
Cas took a moment to inspect Dean. He couldn’t see perfectly, the only source of light being a dilapidated old neon sign on the front of the bar, but Dean didn’t seem different than usual.
“Don’t waste your time, Raphael. I already offered to teach him, but he doesn’t seem to be really interested.”
Dean smiled. “First, tea can be cool. I like this black one, by the way, and I will definitely be asking you for more recommendations."
“Well, our kitchen will be free. And… It would be fun for me to learn how to bake cookies!”
In his life, Dean had fallen asleep more often thanks to alcohol than to herbal teas, but he preferred not to pick up on Cas' remark.
“We’ll take my car! I rarely get a chance to use her since I live on campus, so I’m happy to be able to take a ride with her. I’m sure you’re gonna like her."
Cas’ eyes widened. Did he hear what he thought he’d heard? Was Dean still joking? Dean took one more step, and now they were really close to each other, and Cas scanned Dean's face, trying to find a sign that he was joking.
“Cas, I… You…” he began to stammer.
“Yeah, you’re probably right… But don’t change the subject: what is going on between you and Dean?”
“Sorry for…all of that,” he said, waving his hand. “I spend a lot of time here, so I know a lot of students.”
“Yeah, Cassie. But Lisa and he were still on good terms, so I don’t really know.”
“Maybe you should sit down, then,” Cas suggested, very matter-of-factly.
She just nodded, and Cas understood that this was her way of expressing her gratitude. The fact that she didn’t leave him on a sarcastic note proved that she cared about that soccer player.
Cas didn’t understand what was so funny about the situation, but Dean was glowing. Happiness looked good on him, and Cas felt a hint of tenderness, along with the determination to try and make Dean laugh as much as he could, even if he didn’t know how. Apparently, just being himself seemed to be enough to entertain Dean. Cas wasn’t going to complain about that. It felt good to be able to just be himself, and he was starting to realize that Dean was one of these rare people with whom he wasn’t afraid to act natural. With Dean, he didn’t have to play a role.
Cas stood up and firmly walked towards the door.
She rolled her eyes. “Of course! And I’m sure you’d find them useful too, if you would only try…”
“What is going on? You look like you just saw a ghost!”
“And you’re with… Meg, right?” Dean asked, looking at Meg.
The afternoon was going great. The kids were excited when Dean had announced that they would play basketball after their homework, and it motivated them to quickly do all their school tasks.
“It means that at least he’s a little more civilized than you and your friends. His only conversation topic isn’t the list of people he’s had sex with!”
"But...?"
Cas already read that list, while researching the society before coming to the meeting, but he didn’t mention it and simply nodded.
Dean almost choked and decided to stop Cas (who was apparently still typing) before he kept going.
Ultimately, Dean ended up joining him in eating the cookies, and it was great. Cas commented according to his preferences, and Dean explained the differences between each recipe.
Dean looked alternatively between Charlie and Cas, not understanding what was happening. Charlie’s gaze lingered on Dean and Cas’ hands, still intertwined.
Luckily, his week was quite busy, with a lot of assignments due, which allowed him to focus on something else, even though he found it especially hard to not think about this “date.” Dean texted him on Thursday to confirm the time, and somehow, even though it wasn’t rational because Cas knew he hadn’t dreamt the invitation, he felt reassured to have written “proof” that this was real. He was really supposed to meet Dean for the basketball game.
Cas glanced at the other students who were all looking at him, their faces full of curiosity and expectation. He blushed. That was too much. Coming here was already a big step. Talking about very personal topics in front of fifteen strangers was another step he wasn’t ready to take yet. He shook his head.
“These were made for 10-year old children, Dean. It’s a good thing that a third-year science student was able to solve them,” Cas laughed.
Cas shifted on the couch, feeling a little bit uncomfortable.
Dean burst into laughter. “Hey, Cas, relax, I’m joking! So… Can I come in?”
Once he was in his room, Cas took off his shoes, put on some comfortable clothes, and laid down on his bed. He closed his eyes and let his thoughts drift. Without realizing it, he fell asleep.
“You could almost believe that you're the ideal son-in-law, all classy like that…”
Cas decided that copying Jody’s slides down in his notebook was the best way to stay focused on what she was saying, and that carefully looking at the board would prevent him from sneaking glances at Dean. He couldn’t believe this was happening. That the gorgeous boy that almost
Cas’ blood froze as he sensed the panic in Dean’s voice. He quickly reached the group. Jack Kline, one of the youngest kids, was holding his knee, sobbing.
“What?” Dean asked, noticing Cas staring at him carefully.
“Yes,” Cas nodded, “Just a little bit tired, that’s all. I had a busy week.”
The day Sam left, Dean didn’t even see Cas. He stayed in his room, only getting out twice to grab something to it back in his room. He even wondered if that was how the full week was going to go. However, on the second day, Cas knocked at his door in the morning. Dean sighed.
"A... a beer is fine," Dean stammered, a little taken by surprise.
Dean stopped talking, because his voice was too broken, because he was too tired, and because he knew he was on the verge of tears. Actually, he was already crying. He was feeling vulnerable, exposed, and he was perfectly  aware that they had reached a point of no return. Things would never be the same as before again after those revelations. For both of them. But the situation was already wasted, so he assumed he had nothing left to lose. He was staring at a point on the wall behind Cas, his vision blurred because of tears. He didn’t hear Cas approaching, and grabbing him tight, pulling him into a hug.
He forced himself not to blush. He had tried to sound casual, but internally his thoughts were racing and he felt a wave of embarrassment washing through him. He had suggested that he and Dean take the bus together to go to the Center. For him, it felt like a big move. But he knew that, objectively, it wasn’t. There was nothing weird about suggesting that they go there together. They were partners, after all. It was in Dean’s interest that Cas didn't get lost while traveling to the center. It was a completely normal thing to say. Dean would not think he had a crush on him just because he had suggested that.
Dean beamed. "I’m proud of you. You’re getting really good at the whole irony thing, ya know?“
While I’m writing the next part of the message, I’m listening to the song you recommended, by the way. I am also cuddled under my favorite blanket, almost naked. (Gotcha! Shut your cakehole. Only a bare chest and boxers. Jeez. I just had a nice shower after running. I’m not gonna write you erotica, pal. ;-) Yet.)
All he cared about was the incomparable feel of Cas‘ bare skin against his. Cas‘ chest alone, rising and falling rapidly, and his lust-filled eyes aroused him immensely.
We spent a passionate weekend together. It was very, very physical, and ultimately, our views of life were too different. Nevertheless. They were happy days. Exciting, adventurous, passionate. I had to process these experiences for a long time. And in a way, they changed everything. They opened new roads for me. The best ones.
Then he stopped in front of Drea’s friend. “Hi, I’m Dean.“ He extended his hand to her, liking her soft skin. “Congratulations, you’re right in the middle of insanity.“
“There you go.” Cas patted his shoulder triumphantly, which was rather funny to watch given the stoic demeanor that he usually displayed. At that moment, Dean could well imagine a younger Cas getting into sibling squabbles with Hannah.
He would have liked to know which cliché he and Cas would have fitted into.
"It’s "I’ll Take Care of You“ by Beth Hart and Joe Bonamassa. She has a wonderful voice.“
"You’re very sweet, my rambler.“
Enjoy and let me know what you think! :)
He tried hard to find explanations for Cas‘ radio silence. Perhaps Dean had expressed himself stupidly, had not been able to clearly convey what was going on inside him. The more he thought about it, the more he panicked. Would Cas really be back for Christmas? Why had he run away in the first place?
Inside the church they looked for a place on the balcony, since from there one could both overlook the audience and had a clear view of the stage. Dean enjoyed seeing the rows in front of him, which would soon be full of people. He would be able to recognize individual faces that reflected a wide variety of emotions. Most importantly, up here one had the best acoustics, would hear everything, every little detail echoing off the mighty walls. Another factor was the quiet, slight seclusion. There were usually scarcely any people sitting up here, as most preferred to be as close to the center of the action as possible.
"I’m glad. Thank you for stepping by and for your support.“ That was obviously a standard phrase he gave every fan at the end, but his look said something else. Gratitude, yes, but also - emotion? Huh.
"I don’t know what to say,“ Cas admitted after a minute. Dean looked up again, seeing tears in Cas‘ eyes.
"I’m not a believer, Cas,“ Dean breathed, another smile tugging at his lips. Castiel’s body tingled, especially his cheek, which Dean kept caressing with so much tenderness.
"I told him to send my greetings to our enemies,“ Dean answered quietly.
Side note: Their messages will not entirely vanish.
"Hello? Help, can anyone hear me?“ Someone was calling. It was rare for anyone to get lost in this part of the forest. Despite the proximity to the lake, the bushes were too thick, posing a constant danger when jogging or hiking with their numerous thorns.
Then events came thick and fast, and Mr. Adork landed on earth, illustrated by a hole that opened in the sky, showing a kind of tube into which another stairway was placed. A stairway that wound around a chute.
Of course, they had written exactly that to each other numerous times, more or less directly. To receive this message so directly after they had met in real life was still different. Dean set to reply several times, wanting to write to him that Cas didn’t have to solve his problems on his own, that Dean would continue to watch over him, just as Cas did. That there was nothing that would deter him. That he missed him even after those few minutes.
Just looking at his full lips, Castiel felt different. Dean was a beautiful man, he possessed many attractive body parts, that was common knowledge. What had become clear to him, however, at the latest now as a human, was that he also found Dean attractive. And his soul was another level of beauty anyhow.
Thing is I kinda ditched a very great guy 'cause of you (FOR you). Zero regrets, though.
Although he had last read the work years ago, he quickly found his way back into the plot and better understood what it was about in the course of the two-hour meeting. In the end, it was decided to talk about the first-person narrator at the next meeting, which would again take place the upcoming week at 7 p.m.
Nausea overcame him, and he tucked his head between his legs.
"What about you?“ Dean asked while Castiel placed another plate on the high tower he had built by now. With thoroughness, Dean cleaned the next plate, leaving no spot unattended.
To distract himself, he inspected Baby first. His beauty looked battered. Each new spot where he discovered damage felt like a knife cut. He clenched his fists, kicked a few hard against the front tires. He would have liked to punch the damn windshield so he wouldn’t have to endure this sullying anymore. His cell phone vibrated. A message from Cas.
"You are more active in the evening than in the morning,“ Cas began hesitantly. His voice sounded particularly deep and smoky. "You appreciate silence, you don’t necessarily have to draw attention to yourself. Of course, you have a quick tongue, as we all often experience first-hand. Besides, you are often stubborn and headstrong, and above all you know how to defend yourself.“
"Our recognition coins? I was really attached to that club as a kid. What’s the story about Morse code and uncovering conspiracy theories in the neighborhood?“
"Hello? I’m not even talking about a relationship. But to meet a new guy, would do you quite good. If you could then exchange a few blowjobs and fuck, it would help everyone. You need someone riding you on a regular basis, or the other way around. Anyway, no details, please.“
"Can I ask you one more favor?“
He continued with his perusal.
In the taxi, at 6 a.m., “Wishing (If I Had A Photograph Of You)“ by A Flock Of Seagulls played, and Dean sighed exasperatedly because he had so many feelings.
"Cas?“ he asked, not trusting himself. He could collapse on the spot, any second.
The little thoughts, the curiosity, that stuck into his head, could not be pushed away or forgotten although everything in himself told him he was wrong for feeling this way. Being alone with these doubts and fears, suffering until finally freeing himself and accepting.
While the rain comes pouring inside
Once in a while he stroked the hood and whispered "Sorry, Baby, I’m not gonna neglect you again, you hear me? Last weeks just’ve been a bit tough, ya know. Gonna make you look practically new again, alright, beautiful?“ Once Baby was clean again, he used the car wax Cas had given him.
My dad is blaming me for my brother’s sickness, can you imagine? It’s all so fucked up. God, my dad really is an asshole for so many reasons. Still, I do the same thing, actually, blaming me. Could’ve been prevented, this thing. I should’ve done something, should’ve saved him. Couldn’t. Always want to help, always end up being miserable. Not trying to be a downer here, that’s just kinda how my life went.
"Hey Sammy?“ Dean yelled after him.
Dean has (romantic) surprises for Cas. Dean and Cas go on a ride to one of Dean’s favorite spots.
At that moment, he wished he knew more about cars, but to him, cars were mysterious; he didn’t know different models, let alone could philosophize about any specifics. Gabriel certainly could have given him a leg up here, but his brother wasn’t here.
"You’re absolutely right. I almost forgot. Mom, dad. It was wonderful to see you today. We should fix our date for dinner, soon. I will come by after the book tour, alright?“
“ Dean cursed under his breath, deleting the message again. Yeah, sure, that didn’t sound desperate and pathetic at all. No, that was the wrong approach.
"Sometimes it’s so- just so much. I mean, Bobby knows how mom died and that dad blames me. He witnessed some of his outbursts. But he still doesn’t know know. Not the details. I could never talk about this with anybody and I just- Sometimes I just wish I could’ve done that, and then again, I feel so ashamed. So guilty.
Since Dean didn’t yell at her or look at her disapprovingly, she dared to let her guard down. Suspiciously, she looked at him. "You’re not laughing at all.“
"Endearing?“ asked Castiel, reflexively touching Dean’s shoulder. "It’s okay. I like her a lot.“
"My name is Hanna,“ she whispered and closed her eyes, panting, a tear running down her cheek. Dean sighed. Despite her confident demeanor, this was still just a girl lost alone in the woods. This was not an everyday experience for such a young girl.
"You gotta be kidding me. Are you trying to lighten my mood or attempting to make me feel even more like a piece of shit?“ Dean barked and kicked his blanket away. Immediately, he felt cold, but he didn’t care either, because he was still sweating, his damn T-shirt sticking to his torso.
"Do you want to- are you going to sleep here? Or are you about to hit me over the head with a book and drag my unconscious body behind the garbage cans?“ Castiel smirked. Dean’s humor still appealed to him, maybe. Definitely.
But he had a funny premonition, and so he ran away as if stung by a tarantula. He ran and ran and ran until his lungs hurt. In front of him was a building. Nondescript, old, probably more than a hundred years old.
"Hey Cas, what’re ya doing here?“ And once more Cas tilted his head and stared at him.
Every morning I had a message from you in my inbox, every morning I was able to give you some thoughts to take with you. Every noon you sent me a few short snippets of thoughts that made me laugh so hard during lunch breaks that my colleagues suspected I was having a caffeine overdose.
Now Green Eyes carefully tousled through Castiel’s hair, very gently, as if he was afraid Castiel would reject him, and considering the unexpected tenderness Castiel felt a shiver all over his body. "And you think I’m all right, at least.“ He winked at him. "Shall we not make peace?“
"She still hates me.“
The song Benny has sung and Anna refers to: "Rewrite the Stars" from The Greatest Showman (performed by Zach Efron and Zendaya) (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO28Z5_Eyls)
Dean furrowed his forehead. He was so interested in the reasons why Emmanuel – no Cas – had rewritten the entire thing even if it had been only a few chapters back then, and he was still working on the work at the moment. Had it something to do with the man he had met? Probably.
Something was off. Why had Cas looked so afraid? And why did these people know that they were in town? It was so strange. Maybe he should try to find Hannah. On the other hand, he didn’t know her at all and he didn’t want to come across as a nuisance. He wanted to be happy about Cas’s kind words. His heart beat faster as soon as he stared at the message again.
On the other hand, Charlie looked at him so hopefully, he was fighting an internal battle with himself. He knew that even months later, Charlie was still reeling from her breakup. Her ex-girlfriend had cheated on her, which had pulled the rug out from under Charlie. Often enough, Charlie had to work long hours (she worked as a programmer in a major company in town), and Dean knew she could use a distraction.
Naturally, Dean ordered a bacon cheeseburger and to his surprise Sam did the same (besides his rabbit food, of course). Their orders arrived, and he gave the waitress one of his best smirks. The burger vanished within minutes.
"You enjoyed that, huh?“ Dean interrupted him angrily, getting louder by the second. "That’s awesome, really, 'cause at least I didn’t imagine things. All the making out, the intimacy. I’m full of the joys of spring, man. Two days ago, the reading and stuff, I was never happier in my whole life. And I wanted to... I wanted to tell you that I... But the next morning you were just gone.“
"You’re a good guy, ya know that?“ Dean looked at him, all serious and penetrating, and Castiel really couldn’t explain if this intensity he felt between them was merely due to his lack of sleep or if the air really tingled like that. Maybe it was this unusual situation, yes it had to be. Castiel didn’t know what to say back to Dean’s honest comment.
Cas had turned on some song in the background. It was tranquil, beautiful.
Love was fighting and yelling at each other from time to time. Love was laughter, silly comments. Letting oneself fall.
"You’re kidding, Cas,“ Dean replied, although he felt relieved. "Son of a bitch, you’re a guy with many talents,“ he mumbled. Cas hummed and continued with more pressure. Dean could feel Cas applied more strength now. His neck and back were indeed sore, and so this was the perfect treatment right now. A small moan escaped him and fuck, this was the best massage ever.
A flash of panic passed through Castiel's eyes, very briefly, but Charlie probably saw it, because she quickly added: "But of course you don't have to. No pressure. You can just keep listening. But just know that if you want to express yourself... Here is a safe place to do it. No one is going to judge you. We've all been there, we all know it's not easy to start opening up when you're new. But you'll see, the hardest thing is to begin, and once you've talked once, it'll be easier the next time. And I'm sure you'll soon find out that you can trust us here. We are all in the same boat, and we are here to help each other.”
“No, but we're all going to a party at a bar together tonight, though. With all the folks from the poker circle, like Dean, and everyone. As always, feel free to join us!”
Dean also had finished cleaning the kitchen before leaving.
Dean looked a little bit surprised. “You’re sure?”
, Cas thought. So many things had changed in just a few months!
“I was… I was wondering… Today’s Christmas Eve, and I was wondering if you were going to do anything special for the holiday?”.
But, once again, Dean surprised him. "It's okay, I'm in no hurry!"
“I had to pick up some parts for the Impala. Old stuff that you can't find just anywhere, I had to drive six hours to get them in a garage I found on the internet,” Dean lied.
"Hey, calm down! I'm Tom!" he said, as if it was explaining everything.
However, Charlie wasn’t looking at him. She was looking at something – or someone – behind Cas.
“And I can’t wait to teach you how to bake,” Dean winked. And that wink almost finished Cas. He was feeling overwhelmed, and his heart was beating fast, but overall he was feeling so good, so great, better than ever. Dean looked adorable; Cas could already picture the two of them in his kitchen, and suddenly he wished it was already Friday. Dean was so soft, so kind, so caring. And suddenly, the fact that he liked partying, and having one-night stands, and everything else, everything that was holding Cas back until that moment, didn’t seem to matter anymore.
“Oh yeah, that explains the bedhead.”
Cas blushed. Dean leaned in.
“No, Cas, really. I’m telling you: this is your calling. Trust me, you don’t have to doubt it. You’re awesome, and you’ll be an awesome doctor. You have to believe in yourself, man. Because I believe in you.”
It was good for him to get his mind off things. After two games and a few more beers, he was feeling better. The group of friends who had asked him to join them made no comments and asked no questions, which Dean appreciated. He showed them his best pool moves. He was interrupted a few hours later by his phone ringing. It was a message from Sam, asking if everything was okay. He hurried to answer, their dispute the day before still fresh in his mind. While he was answering, the man who had offered to play tapped him on the shoulder to let him know that their group was leaving, they had a bit of a drive home. Dean nodded, answering he would be home soon himself. After he sent his message to Sam, his eyes were drawn to a notification on his phone from the previous morning: "It's a match! Tom sent you a message on 'Date me'". A wave of curiosity swept over him as he stared at the notification. He wanted to see what Tom's profile looked like, and why Cas had swiped right. But he was struck again by Cas' profile picture as soon as he clicked on the app to open it, since he still hadn't swiped left or right.
“Nah Sam, Cas just wanted to celebrate Christmas… As a human…”
“Really? Well, today’s your lucky day. If you want, I can teach you. You know, to make up for potentially causing you a head injury!”
“Ouch!” he winced.
“Maybe Jack will even lose his leg!” one girl said.
“Goodbye Mrs. Kline, Jack…”
“Yes. It… It sounds good,” Cas answered simply.
“Animal documentary? Really? Sorry, you know that’s not my jam. I’ll be in my room if you need me!”
Focusing on the cards and their meanings and memorizing all the combinations wasn’t easy when Dean was so close to him.
“That’s more than expected,” Cas commented.
“You’re thinking too much, Cas,” he spoke to himself, shaking his head to make his thoughts go away, and focused on his readings.
Cas startled, bumping his head on the door of the cupboard that was still open.
"No, no, it's just that Balt told me about the poker game tonight, and I thought you might want to get there as soon as possible, once the cookie "obligation" was over..."
Did Cas only swipe right on his profile because he knew Dean and thought it was a funny coincidence, or did he not know how the app worked and the implications behind his gesture, or was he really interested in Dean? Should Dean answer on the app? He decided to go home and confront him about it directly, since now he couldn’t ignore the situation anymore, now that they both knew that they were both on the app (and that they were both aware of it).
“‘‘Cas’ sounds right,” the guy nodded. “I’m Dean, by the way. Dean Winchester. Nice to meet you!”
“What… What the hell are you doing, Cas?”
Cas hesitated. Charlie gave him an encouraging smile. He really liked her, she seemed to be a very nice person, but… no, Cas didn’t feel ready yet.
“And that’s why you were waiting outside?”
“How are you feeling? Where does it hurt?”
"Is... it not good?"
“But we did! Benny, this is…”
She was still regularly looking at the person behind Cas; but Cas didn’t want to turn around and have the confirmation that
Cas’s smiled. Not only with his mouth, but also with this eyes, and with his entire face. He was beaming with joy. He squeezed Dean’s hand. In the background, a cheesy love Christmas song was playing. And the moment was perfect, and couldn’t be more perfect. Dean felt so much joy that he thought his heart wouldn’t take it anymore and would explode. And moreover, he felt relief. The guilt was suddenly gone for the moment, and he finally felt at peace. Holding Cas’s hand, looking at him, feeling his warmth, his presence, it was just feeling right.
Cas hadn’t planned to ask him that. It was one of his deepest worries, one that he didn’t share easily, but he had been so mesmerized by Dean’s speech, and talking to him felt so easy, that it just slipped out of his mouth. He had said that while staring at his eyes intensely, and his voice sounded almost broken. He felt vulnerable, and he knew that Dean could sense his distress, the hours he spent wondering whether that path was the right one for him, the hours he spent making up thousands of scenarios in his mind of what he could do instead if he decided to drop the program – even though deep down he knew he was too rational to suddenly just stop it. However, for some reason, he didn’t feel ashamed of appearing so weak in front of Dean; he even felt relieved to let it out. He felt safe with Dean, as if he could tell him anything, trust him with his deepest worries. Even though he didn’t really know him yet.
“Here you go,” Dean said, handing him a cup. “I would have liked to make some hot comfort food, but I didn’t know whether I’d have time and didn’t want to intrude, so I just made you a peanut butter sandwich.”
Dean looked surprised. “Well of course it was? I thought it was pretty clear?”
“Don’t be silly, Meg. We’re volunteering together for a community program, that’s how I know him.”
“Still, I wish I could be more like you.”
“See you next week then!” Charlie said, while locking the door of the room.
The man was personable, in a good mood. He punctuated his suggestion with a charming little smile. Was he really hitting on Dean, there, like that, in that bar? It was the first time it had happened. How had he known that Dean could potentially be interested in him?
“Good idea, Dean," Donna approved. “Do you agree, Castiel?”
Cas laughed. “I think I could live with it.”
“Dean? What is going on?”
Dean grinned, gesturing at the box with his hand. “Be my guest!”
Dean grinned. “Okay, Cas. You coming?”
was he supposed to answer? It would be more polite to answer. He had to. But if he answered too quickly, Dean would think he had nothing else to do on a Friday evening and that his life was boring. On the other hand, Dean probably already knew that he wasn’t doing anything special. And he didn’t know Dean enough to text him too late on a Friday night, so he shouldn’t wait too long. He began to think about his answer, before realizing that he shouldn’t care that much. Dean was only a friend, and what he thought about Cas didn’t matter. Cas wasn’t trying to seduce him or anything. He should act with him the same way he acted with his other friends. Except that he didn’t really have many friends… Anyway, he shouldn’t overthink this. He grabbed his phone.
“I’m looking forward to it,” he said. “Maybe we can go to check the kitchen now to see whether I have all the baking tools you’ll need?”
“Yes, I… My head’s okay.”
“Yes, thanks again! And sorry we couldn’t finish the game because of me!”
“I’m sure I’ll be fine." Cas smiled. “Goodbye, Mrs. Mills.”
“I’ll just… go back to my room”, Dean stuttered before leaving – or more like fleeing – the kitchen, awkwardly walking backward until he reached the door and then turning away and quickly walking back to his room.
anyway, he already had Dean for that! That statement silenced  Tom, which was no small feat.
Cas winced. This was a nightmare. Was he condemned to be stuck next to Dean, listening to him describe how he was having sex with the entire campus, because sex was probably so important for him? The other players seemed to be used to this kind of conversation, and were enthusiastically cheering him on. Cas sighed. If he had to hear another dirty joke, he would be sick.
“Well, there are 10 kids…”
“Proof that anything can happen,” Meg sarcastically answered. “Besides, this is a beautiful message of hope for you: if I can take the initiative to organize some schoolwork, maybe you will be able to take some initiative for your love life and finally get laid before the end of the year!”
“Dean, there’s nothing you can’t fix. I bet that Cas can forgive you. Dean, Christmas is the perfect day for you to try to make things better. It’s about hope and forgiveness, and love.”
Cas rolled his eyes. “Or coffee, if you prefer…”
Dean grinned.
Usually, he was the one who had this role!
“It’s… locked,” Cas said, and it was the first thing he said since he had run away from the meeting. His voice sounded weird, his throat was dry. He blinked, almost surprised that he was able to talk.
Cas nodded. It wasn’t a lot, but he hadn’t really had any expectations before coming. Progressively, students began to come in, joining them at the center of the room. No one seemed to be surprised that he, a guy that they never saw before, was present and casually eating cookies with the president of the society.
And Dean helped him to put the sweater on. Then, the two men looked into each other’s eyes. For a long time. Like they used to do before. They were really, really close. And then, Dean didn’t know what came over him, but he instinctively took Cas’s hand and led him into the main room. The angel’s eyes widened in surprise as he discovered the decoration.
“Same time. Have a good week, Cas, and feel free to text me anytime if you have any questions or feel anxious about the program… Or anything else actually!”
They didn’t stop on their way to pick up Dean’s other friends, so Cas thought they would meet them at the restaurant. However, once they arrived at the Roadhouse, Dean didn’t even look for them in the restaurant, choosing a table with only two seats.
Meg’s eyes widened, surprised. “But… What is the point, then?”
“I… I wasn’t…” Cas stammered.
He had never been in such a situation. A very handsome guy like Dean acting so flirty with him? He was probably imagining things and overanalyzing the situation. He ate his sandwich, trying to listen to the voices that were coming from the living room, then stood up to head back to his room. Walking by the living room door, he had a moment of hesitation. But the door was closed, and he had already been through a lot of emotions for the day. The next day would also be busy and stressful with his first volunteer meeting, so he decided to stick to his initial plan and go back to his room to relax.
“How do I know her?” Dean laughed. “She’s one of my best friends, we met on our first day of university, in freshman year! Well, now she’s specializing in computer engineering while I chose mechanical engineering, but we still have some classes together from time to time. And what about you?”
“How are the other kids?” Cas asked.
The stranger let out a small laugh and raised both his hands in a gesture of appeasement.
“If you want to, yeah.”
“Hm, I think I’m gonna go with a chai latte.”
“I don't know, why not? I never tried attending that kind of gathering. Can't say I don't like it if I never tried! I'll probably decide not to go, though,” Cas shrugged.
“If you really don’t have any problem with it, why don’t you want to come to one of the meetings?”
“It’s okay that you don’t want to… to have sex with these people, Cas. It’s okay that you tried to find out what you like. I get it now, but you have to be careful. You just
“Come on, you’re the biggest child of all of them, Dean!”
fully himself. Everything was just happening so fast and he felt as if he wasn’t in control of anything. Probably because he wasn’t. Dean was the one controlling the situation. He was the one who knew the process. Cas didn’t really know what to think about it, but in a way, it was reassuring, knowing that he wouldn’t be alone in this new and unknown situation.
“You know what, Cas? I’m hesitating between advising you to wear something really casual, to blend in, like I think you’d like, or suggesting that you wear something that fits you, that you like, and that looks good on you… But then people would notice, which you may not like.”
Did Cas really just text him on a dating app?
“Wow, you’re good at this, Cas,” Dean whistled after Cas found out the answers to the questions he prepared very quickly.
“Wow. You’re literally the only person I know on this campus who’d say no to that. You’re weird, Clarence.”
“My shirt and my jacket were dirty”, explained the angel.
“Um, not really. He was going with his friends first, but invited me to join them because we’re organizing a basketball game with the kids we’re tutoring next Saturday. So yeah, it is more an out-of-convenience offer…”
“Come on, do you really have something better than that?” Balthazar asked impatiently.
“Great idea!” Dean immediately accepted.
Cas quickly scanned through the list. Dean was in the “activities” group while Cas was in the “tutoring” group. A very, very silly idea came to Cas’ mind, but he immediately pushed it away. There was no point in hoping that he and Dean wouldbe on the same team. Dean had volunteered the year before, so he probably already had friends in the program, who he would want to be paired up with, and…
“He’s my roommate,” Dean suddenly blurted out, to make him stop talking. Now, he didn’t want to picture what Cas could do with Tom. Cas didn’t need an instructor
Clearly, Dean was surprised. He gave him an interrogative look.
Dean had hoped they could indeed share his bed, but he didn't want to scare Cas.
Of course, he didn’t dare to talk himself. But listening to others was already very therapeutic and satisfying on its own. When the meeting ended two hours later, Cas hadn’t seen the time fly, and as he left the room, waving to the other students, he already knew he would come back next week.
He knew it wasn’t a big thing. The other members of the society talked about their experiences every week in a very spontaneous way. He had had time to prepare: to get used to the idea and to think about what he would say. He was more ready than the students who usually spoke. He was ready. Besides, he wasn’t risking anything. Worst case scenario, if he couldn’t finish talking and had to just stop, no one would blame him for that. He didn’t have to worry about anything. It could only help him, to finally talk about his feelings freely.
Dean clenched his fist.
“So, what are your preferences?” Dean asked, turning to Cas.
“Uh… I don’t really have an opinion on that topic, as I said, I don’t know how to play poker…”
“So, we were here to talk about the volunteering program…” Cas suddenly started, in a neutral tone. He felt that he needed to regain some control over the situation. Talking about a neutral topic, something that he could focus on, would help him to pull himself together.
“Hum… Dean…”
In situations like this, he liked talking to himself out loud. It helped him to process his thoughts and break the heavy silence.
Cas suddenly felt someone grip his shoulder. He almost jumped and quickly turned his head in the direction of the person who was touching him.
“Okay,” Dean repeated. “I’ll put some cartoons on so that I can be available if you need any help.”
“Are you feeling better, Dean?” he asked, concerned. “Maybe I can try to use some grace on you?”.
A host of questions raced through Dean's mind, and he didn't even know where to begin. Looking around, he finally decided to sit down, on the other side of the couch where Cas was sitting. Cas carefully watched him settle in without a word. After a few moments, Dean found the courage to break the awkward silence.
“No,” he said. “No, no, no,” he repeated, feeling the panic growing and growing.
“Okay, ready to go Cas? Dean, Lisa, good night!”
"I'm sorry, I didn't mean to push him, I was running, and I couldn't stop," Ben, one of the children, intervened in a very small voice that didn't sound like him at all.
Cas took a sip from his tea. Dean was really excited about the program, and his enthusiasm was infectious. He was starting to look forward to meeting the children, and wasn’t as anxious as before.
“Perfect.”
“Though your hair doesn’t look as messy as the first time we met,” Dean smiled, slowly raising a hand again. He stopped himself only centimeters away from Cas’ forehead, silently asking him permission to keep going with his eyes. Cas nodded once, very lightly, not able to look away from Dean’s eyes, which were definitely very close. Five minutes ago, he had thought he could never look at Dean again, and here he was, hypnotized by him. He almost caught his breath, wondering what Dean would do.
“Works for me." Dean nodded.
He came to the bunker  late, well past dinnertime. He had driven the entire day, without a specific destination, ignoring Sam’s calls, just texting him he was okay. Cas had texted him, too, asking what he would make for dinner. Dean just told him he wouldn’t make it back in time for dinner and that Cas shouldn’t wait for him. He felt guilty to let Cas down. It was the first time he wouldn’t cook for Cas and they wouldn’t eat dinner together since Cas became human, but after all, Sam could prepare the meal, or Cas could make sandwiches. He knew how to make those, and he liked them.
Dean followed all of Sam’s instructions. He drank some water and slept a few hours in his car to sober up. Then, when he woke up around 5, feeling better, he looked at the list of stores opened 24 hours a day, opened on Christmas in the area. By chance, there was one on his way between the bar and the bunker, 40 minutes away from where he was. Of course, the convenience store he found didn’t have all the things he wanted, but it was still better than nothing. Seeing the ugly Christmas sweater the cashier was wearing, Dean got a pinch in his heart. He remembered how Cas had looked at the sweaters at Walmart, and regretted not buying him one. It was too late, now. He actually couldn’t find any gifts in the small shop. And he really needed to wrap something. He texted Sam at 6. His brother just woke up.
“So those were the basics about asexuality, but I believe that someone here can add to what I said by sharing his personal experience?”
“It’s not on campus?” Cas asked, surprised.
“Hi, Dean! How are you today?” interrupted the barista, a girl with long blonde hair and a big smile.
“And you said you were interested in men?”
“Sounds good,” Cas agreed. “I don’t know basketball rules, though.”
Dean looked a little relieved. “Okay,” he said after a few seconds. “So we're good, right?”
Cas blushed even more and looked at his feet.
“Who is Benny?” Cas asked, curious. He never heard this name before.
“What? No, everything’s fine, don’t worry.”
“I think I definitely feel romantic attraction towards Dean,” Cas announced, thinking out loud.
“Yes, I registered my son…”
“Balt, I swear I’m perfectly happy with how my life is right now. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I still have some readings to do for Wednesday.”
“Anyway, when I first heard about asexuality, I had prejudices about it, and immediately thought “no that’s not me, how could it be me?” But the more I read about it, the more I thought about it, the more I realized that it answered a lot of my questions. It was the explanation for why I wasn’t as interested in sex as my friends. But I already have a lot of issues to deal with – I’m shy, and very very anxious, and I’m gay, and it’s already a lot to manage, and I didn’t want to add something more, and back then, it didn’t seem very relevant, as I was still single anyway, and I wasn’t interested in anyone, and therefore, I didn’t feel the need to think about it. I preferred burying it, pretending I had never heard about it, as if ignoring it could make it less real. And I almost succeeded! Until… Until…”
“Anyway, let’s go,” he said, shaking his head in disbelief but internally amused, opening the door of the car.
It is only when he reached the door of his house that he realized he had left without his coat. And that his keys were in his coat. It was a Sunday afternoon. Would Balthazar be home? What did he have planned that day? Cas had been so focused on the fact that he was going to speak at the meeting that he hadn’t paid attention to what his roommate had told him the day before. He banged at the door, desperately calling Balthazar’s name – even though he didn’t need his friend, but more the access to his room, so he could throw himself on his bed and hide under his pillow.
He walked in Cas’ direction, stopping when he was only two steps away from him.
They arrived late for class.
On their way back to campus, Dean didn't bring up the topic again, and Cas was relieved. He didn't want to lie to him, because so far both of them had a friendship based on truth. But he couldn't tell him the truth either. Luckily, they had decided to organize a scavenger hunt next week, and they had a lot to talk about to plan it. So much to talk about that they didn't finish, and decided to meet on the next Wednesday to finalize the organization.
He eventually received a call from Sam.
"Oh yeah, that's a great idea," Cas agreed, excited to spend some extra time with Dean.
Cas almost spilled the bottle. Did Balthazar know? Did he guess? Had he been too obvious? He turned to his roommate to check his expression. Apparently, Balthazar was only joking. Cas sighed, relieved.
A regular black coffee? Cas snorted. Who was the one being boring, now? Dean met his gaze and looked at him questioningly for a few seconds before he probably understood what Cas was thinking. He smiled a little and looked back at the barista.
to him. So Cas really
Dean blinked. The situation was weird, but he was making it even weirder. It was quite clear that Cas had no idea that Dean had just come across his profile. However, if Dean didn’t stop acting so awkwardly, Cas would know something was wrong, get suspicious, and he would probably end up thinking about the app. Especially if he already saw Dean’s profile – but maybe he hadn’t? Otherwise, he would have acted strange, like Dean was acting right now. He couldn’t have seen Dean’s profile and kept acting as usual. Dean definitely couldn’t.
“So, can I buy another one, or shall we get something lighter for a start? A beer maybe? That would probably keep the conversation going longer... Unless I have to catch up with you first?"
“Stop that, now, Meg!” Cas told her, starting to get anxious that Dean would hear them. The coffee shop wasn’t that big, and there weren’t a lot of customers, and Meg was talking loudly… However, she kept going, provocatively wiggling her eyebrows.
Looking at the mirror in the bathroom, Cas was pretty happy with how he looked. He usually didn’t really find himself “good-looking,” but he had to say, he was feeling good, and confident. He liked wearing the white shirt, and he had been waiting for an occasion to wear that blue tie for a few months. He ruffled his hair a little, because Dean already told him he looked good like that.
“I spent the entire evening reminding myself that no, it wasn’t a date, and that I shouldn’t have any expectations or any hopes about it and…”
“Yeah, it’s a lot,” Dean said, swinging his arm behind Cas’ shoulders to pull him to him and hug him tenderly, “and you see, you can’t say that 1% of humans are flawed. Which means that asexual humans exist, and you’re not less of a human because you don’t feel sexual attraction or whatever. It doesn’t matter. Not to me, at least. As long as you’re happy and comfortable”.
“Is Dean Winchester your friend?” Raphael asked.
Cas waited a few seconds for Dean to say anything, then grabbed the door to close it, realizing that the hunter wasn’t going to talk.
Meg followed his gaze and whistled. “Well, it seems that Dean Winchester already got a new girl? That guy is a real womanizer. He, for sure, doesn’t have the same problem that you, he gets laid often enough!” she giggled.
“Yeah?” Dean encouraged him.
“Though, I have to say, I’m a little bit worried…”
“Absolutely, I’ll pick you up at your place around one. The ride only takes less than twenty minutes, but that way I’ll have time to show you around and we will be able to prepare the ice breaker games, if that’s okay with you.”
He knew that asexuality was a real thing. When he had researched it a few months before, he had gone through a lot of accounts from other people who felt the same way he did. But those people were all anonymous strangers on the Internet. He couldn’t see them in real life, he couldn’t be sure they really existed. On the Internet, it was easy to lie. Maybe he was just inventing it. Here, the word was physically written, printed in purple on this black poster. Asexual. It was written. It was a thing.
"Uh... Guys? I'm still here!"
The door of the bar opened, and Balthazar and Lisa came out.
“‘Cause I got plenty of ideas,” Dean insisted suggestively, looking straight into Cas’ eyes.
He hadn’t been hurt at all by what his friend had said. He knew he was weird. He just wasn’t sure how high his level of weirdness was.
“Dean… Does it always feel this way?”
Cas still seemed uncomfortable, and Dean remembered that he was probably still thinking Dean could get angry at him because of what he was saying.
It was late, and Sam was probably already sleeping. Cas too, since he was human now and therefore needed to sleep. However, Dean noticed that there was light in the kitchen. From the corridor, he couldn’t see who was inside, so he paused for a minute. He couldn’t hear any noise coming from the room, though, which probably meant that the kitchen was empty, and someone just forgot to switch off the light. Relieved, he entered it, walking directly to the fridge to get a fresh beer. He was grabbing one when suddenly a voice he knew very well called him.
His hand was warm in Cas’. There was still a crowd all around them, people talking loudly, but Cas felt as if there was only Dean and him. Only the two of them mattered. Holding Dean’s hand to navigate in the crowd was easy, as if the people were walking away when they approached, to clear the way for them, as if them walking together, hand in hand, was the only right thing. Of course, it wasn’t, but it was a nice feeling that Cas had never experienced before – and hadn’t actually expected to experience.
“Okay, that doesn’t look too bad. There is disinfectant and bandages inside. Do you think you can get up so that we can go clean the wound?”
“Wh- What, I…” Cas began, not knowing what to answer.
As soon as Baby was parked in the garage, he rushed out of the car to practically run to the Dean Cave.
Dean was in the kitchen.
Wow. Tom definitely didn’t waste his time, directly setting up a date with Cas after leaving Dean!
“Cas, I swear it’s okay, we can…” Charlie kept talking.
Cas crossed his gaze, and he seemed more confident now. He smiled at Dean.
At the end of the class, he quickly glanced at the poster in the corridor, but didn’t linger there, since he was with Meg.
Still laughing, Dean joined him in the car, and Cas thought that he really liked Dean’s laugh. He began to smile fondly.
As if to prove his point, Tom pulled out his phone and opened the dating app. He scrolled through his conversations quickly, until he reached the one with Dean:
“Oh no, completely free… But I’m afraid, you’re not really his type… And I’m not talking about hair color, here, if you see what I mean…”
Charlie remained silent, nodding at Cas to make him understand he could choose whether he wanted to tell Dean or not.
“Come on, Cas, I don’t forbid you to bake ! I’m just … surprised that you wanna do something Christmas related. You know, after Chuck’s big reveal, and everything…”
Of course, if Balthazar preferred Dean not come over, or if he had planned to use the kitchen that day, Cas would cancel his plans, but he sincerely hoped that he wouldn’t have to. It wasn’t really a “date,” not a romantic one at least, but he was really looking forward to it.
Despite his gloomy thoughts, he found the will to smile. That was exactly what he needed. “You are not alone.” He hoped it was true, that he would find other students like him, and that he wouldn’t be disappointed once again. He wasn’t sure he could take another disappointment right now.
“I guess you don’t play poker, Cas?”
“Just go take a shower, change your clothes, and meet him outside in thirty minutes. It’s okay, Cas”.
Of course, it wasn’t enough to make up for it, but Cas didn’t know what else to say. He was afraid he would make things worse and the situation even weirder.
“No,” Dean smiled warmly, trying to be as convincing as he could. Cas smiled back.
"Yeah, that’s what I thought," Dean smiled. "So I brought a scarf for you, too, I had two."
“Don’t you want to take the opportunity of Christmas to fix your relationship? Dean, come on!”
“A cup of tea?” she repeated, skeptically.
“I’m asexual,” he repeated, almost hesitantly, trying to test how it sounded. It sounded right. “I’m ace, but I’m not aromantic. I’m homoromantic, and for years, I thought I was just a “regular gay,” except that I wasn’t really interested in sex. At first, I thought everyone else was like me, and was exaggerating when they said how much they wanted to have sex, or how “hot” a person was. But the more I grew up, the more I realized that no, people were serious about that. For years, I wondered what was wrong with me until I discovered what asexuality was. At first, I was confused, because as I said, I am homoromantic. I wanted – and still want – to have romantic interactions. I want to have a special someone, a boyfriend, I want to hold his hand, to hug him, to snuggle against him, to kiss him on the cheek – on the lips, even! – I want to hear him telling me he loves me, and to tell him I love him back and that I’ll always be there with him. I want a real romantic relationship. I’ve had some crushes on boys. I’ve fallen in love before, and all those boys, I always found them beautiful. I had felt some urge, at some point, to hold them tight, to feel their heartbeats, to hide my face in their shoulders… But I never, never felt the urge, or the need to have sex with them. Even when I was in love with someone, and picturing myself in a relationship with him… I was imagining all the kind of interactions – romantic interactions – we could have, but never sex.”
“Yes, I'd like some, thanks.”
With a nonchalant step, Dean moved to the fridge, opening it and scanning it for his plate under Cas' piercing gaze. Was the former angel planning to stand there and watch him eat his entire meal?
“Well, it seems like you really needed those,” said a man behind his back. Dean almost jumped. How cliché was this? Was he really going to talk about his feelings with a random stranger at a bar? He shrugged.
Cas blushed. “I’m not really… I just…”
Dean blushed furiously and abruptly let Cas’ hand go. “Shut up, Charlie!”
. Dean's heart, which had started to beat faster as Cas listed all the couple activities they could do, missed a beat. He could have pictured everything,spending hours with him, driving, listening to music, watching movies, or even just talking - activities they were already doing a lot - and more: holding his hand, kissing his cheek, kissing his lips? But having sex with him? Cas was a very attractive man, and to be honest, he wouldn’t have said no to the idea, but it almost seemed secondary with Cas. Which was funny, given that in his previous relationships, sex always had been extremely important.
« What do you want us to be, Dean ? »
“No, I’m sure you’ll do good without me. I’m going for a drive, anyway.”
“Saying that I was interested in men?”
He didn’t know. He had no idea. He didn’t want to think! Though the choice wasn’t so crucial, so he heard himself answering “hot chocolate.”
The next day would be mentally exhausting, so he planned to spend the evening calmly reading in his room or maybe watching some animal documentaries, an activity he found very soothing, and to go to bed early, to be fully rested the next day. The meeting was at 2 pm, but he knew that it would be difficult for him to fall asleep.
« I don’t know what we are exactly. But, Cas, I really want us to be something. »
“Hum...” he said, lost in his thoughts. “I'll think about it. What time are you leaving?”
"Like... Like what?”
“A physical activity including no clothes and a lot of pleasure…”
The child smiled and ran to his mother. While she was helping him put on his coat, Dean, who hadn’t stopped laughing, suddenly put a hand on Cas’ shoulder.
“Very funny…”
Cas felt very disappointed, sad, and he even suddenly wished he was far away from there. But it wouldn’t be fair to Dean to react that way. Dean hadn’t asked for anything, he hadn’t promised him anything, and he had every right to date whoever he wanted. Cas barely knew him! So why did witnessing Dean plan his date and flirt with the barista hurt him so much?
“Well… Seems like it’s only you and me now, Cas…”
He paused for a second. It was so strange to say it out loud, in front of ten other students – even though he wasn’t directly facing them, he was more than aware of their presence – strange, but good. He felt relieved, in a way, and was surprised to actually feel happy, and proud. He had said it, out loud, in front of an audience, finally! He couldn’t help but let a small nervous laugh escape. It felt really good, as if something that had used to be very heavy was leaving his chest.
He hated it when he got like that. The day had started fine, why did he have to ruin it like that? He was mad at himself.
A woman suddenly interrupted them. “Excuse me? Sorry to interrupt, but I’m here to pick up Jack?”
“It’s fine, I didn’t expect to fall asleep. I guess I just had a very exhausting week! I would have had to wake up to eat at some point anyway.”
Benny moved away, and Cas recognized…
He waved at Donna, who was still busy with the last unpaired students, and then turned to Cas. “Okay, we have to get organized to prepare for next week. We’re out of this meeting earlier than expected, so I assume that you’re still free?”
Dean had prepared a cup for himself too, and they sat in silence for a few moments, drinking.
“Yes, I… I can see that”.
“Just sit down, Dean," the sheriff sighed.
Without giving himself time to change his mind or to overthink it, Cas pressed “send". And immediately regretted it. Did he go too far with that message? “Don’t stay out too late." Who was he to say that to him? Dean was a grown-up, he was able to handle himself! “I’ll need you." That was pathetic!
“Listen, let's not talk about it here, okay? I was feeling a little down last weekend, but I'm good now. It was nothing, really, sorry I seemed to be distant," Cas explained, trying to be convincing.
Great, now Dean probably felt bad because of a mistake Cas made!
“Wasn’t that Dean’s car?” he asked, curious.
“I’m a scientific person, too, Dean,” Cas answered, smiling.
Dean frowned. “Yes, you know, where you hit it, yesterday…”
“It’s 11 pm on Christmas Eve, and I’m drunk, one hour away from the bunker. It’s too late, Sam…”
“Come on, Clarence, don’t be blind! He said you were beautiful, winked at you, and told you he couldn’t wait to see you on Saturday… What more do you need, a proposal? And for your information, Cassie’s not his girlfriend.”
“Cas, I’m sorry”, started Dean, realizing it was the first time he was telling his friend that he was sorry. “I know I will never apologize enough for what I said to you, for what I’ve done to you. You don’t have to forgive me if you can’t, I’d understand. It’s entirely my fault and I don’t deserve you. That’s why I ran yesterday, but instead it only made things worse. I’m sorry Cas, you deserve better, so much better. I know you wanted a Christmas, so… I tried my best to give you one. It won’t be perfect, because everything was closed at 5 am this morning, so I did as I could and… Just come, please…”
“Pretty well. To be honest, they weren’t really surprised.”
He arrived in front of the building 25 minutes early, but didn’t try to go in; the people from the program would probably find it weird that he was there so early. He saw a few students going into the building while he paced in front of the entrance. Ten minutes before the meeting, he went in to find the room. He had planned to wait five more minutes in front of the door, but a woman with long blond hair noticed him sneaking glances inside.
He dramatically left the kitchen, slamming the door, and Dean sighed, pushing his plate away to grab his head and rest his elbows on the table. Suddenly, he wasn’t hungry anymore. Why couldn’t he act like an adult? Why did he always have to ruin everything? They’d had a good dynamic before this. He was teaching Cas to be human, and it was nice. Cas had never stayed with them so long before, and it was really good to have him here.
“Of course I want to see you again,” Cas smiled sadly. “You heard me, didn’t you?”
“Um… What happened?”
“Yeah?” Charlie encouraged him. “Is there a specific topic you’d like to hear about?”
“You’re still as enthusiastic as last year, I see, Dean," Jody noted.
Cas mentally chastised himself. Saying that to Dean, who made a string of dirty jokes last week, wasn't necessarily the best thing to do. The wording of his sentence was confusing, and Dean probably wouldn't pass up the opportunity to pick up on the innuendo. And to suggest his own idea for a twenty-minute activity - which would probably be quite different from the one Cas had in mind!
“Okay, I think we’re gonna start. Hello everybody! For those who don’t know me, I’m Jody Mills, from the sheriff’s office, and this is my partner, Donna Hanscum. We created the CLCP…”
“Very tiring, I’m glad I’m finally home and that I’ll be able to relax this evening. But what are you doing? I thought it was my week to clean?”
“Perfect. I wrote that down. Same place as last year, Dean, I’ll trust you to show Castiel where the building is?”
“Just like us”
Dean put his hands on Cas’ shoulders, looking at him solemnly.
“The reward?” Cas repeated, confused.
“Yeah, I did.”
“Yes, I remember! I had no idea he was volunteering there, too. I’m not surprised, though. Dean’s such a nice guy, it fits his character!”
“Thanks,” Balthazar answered, before resuming sweeping.
Dean let out a heartfelt laugh. “Oh, believe me, I have my own insecurities. No one’s perfect, everyone has their flaws. And I can tell you, I have my fair share of them! You’ll find out soon enough.”
to people on there, but if you had met them in real life, maybe they would have been more insistent on trying to convince you to do things you didn’t want to.”
As if it wouldn’t be okay for Cas to arrive early! “Perfect. Thanks again for the information, for the ride, and for the tea.”
This time, the living room door was ajar. He pushed it a little, just so that he could see better without having to go into the room. This time, there were six players around the table, all of them so focused on the game that they wouldn't have noticed him anyway. Balthazar had his back turned to him and was looking at the other players with interest, trying to read their faces. Next to him, the girl who had been sitting next to Dean earlier was sorting her cards. And, directly in front of him, Dean was rolling a chip through his fingers, seemingly thinking intensely. He took a look at his cards and frowned a little.
“Nothing! Nothing at all,” Cas blurted. “He plays poker with Balt, my roommate, and we discovered, the day after we met, that we were volunteering for the same program. We’re supervising a group of children together every Saturday now. But that’s all. We’re very different, and I don’t think we’re looking for the same things at all… I guess we’re just not compatible, so you don’t need to start imagining things, because nothing will happen between us!”
Cas nodded. “Fair enough. Do you need some help with anything or with the cleaning?”
Several times during the week, he sat down at his desk and tried to write something, to plan what he would say. He was anxious: planning was what he did best! He eventually ended up with a text he was happy with.
He met Cas’ distraught gaze, and was torn between the need to go and comfort him and the intense feeling of shame and guilt that overwhelmed him. Sam threw him an irritated look, and Dean decided to retreat. The damage was done,  and Cas was not alone. Sam seemed to be in control of the situation, anyway.
And he just left, again. Running away from his feeling of guilt.
“Yeah, really. It looks good on you. And I wouldn’t want my favorite basketball referee to get cold!”
However, as soon as he got in the car and closer to Dean, he got a flashback.
"I did," Cas confirmed. "So, shall we start?"
“You know, I like being the cool grown-up for the children, not the one who's annoying them with boring stuff like homework!”
“Hm, why not? That sounds good, but I’ll have to ask my boyfriend first, I’ve been trying to teach him poker recently, and I think he might be interested in joining us?”
Cas stayed silent. No, there wasn't, although... He wished there was.
They stared at each other in a comfortable silence. Cas was almost about to ask him whether Dean wanted to come with him, when Dean cleared his throat.
“Of course,” Dean said. “It was nice seeing you today! I’ll say “hi” to Benny from you, if you want, Meg!”
Cas’ throat tightened. That was so not where he thought he would have led the conversation! He had no intentions of talking about Dean, and yet… He was about to do it. But he felt that he needed it. He desperately needed to let out his thoughts, his worries, his disappointments, his pain.
Cas kept talking, but Dean’s brain had frozen after the “because it was mainly about you” part and the implications behind it. So, in the end, perhaps Cas didn’t just like Dean’s profile because he didn’t know how the app worked, or just to be polite, or out of surprise, or because he knew Dean… But because he really
“To be fair, I wasn’t 100% sure of Cas’ feelings,” Sam admitted.
“Thank you, Dean,” he said, very sincerely.
Dean would probably be surprised to see Cas there. The idea made Cas smile, and was the final argument that definitely convinced him.
Cas shook her hand. “Castiel Novak. I’m a third-year biology student, it’s my first time volunteering."
“Let me recap: you find Dean handsome. Yet, if tonight he knocks at your door and offers you to spend the night with him, you say no?”
“To watch every single episode of Doctor Sexy that is available!”
“You’ve been dreaming about me?” Dean teased.
“Together?” Cas asked, not letting go of Dean’s hand.
“Good choice,” Dean approved.
The hunter didn’t answer and just started the car. The drive back home was completely silent, Cas taking a few looks at Dean, trying to figure out what he’d done wrong.
“Oh, yes, my head, of course!”. Cas felt ridiculous. He instinctively felt his skull for a few moments, pensive, before realizing that Dean was waiting for his answer. "It's okay, I’m fine," he hastened to answer, smiling timidly to convince him.
“I figured that. I know it won’t help, but you really don’t have to worry. The kids are great, and even though some of them will argue about doing their homework, they're usually happy to come, because they know they’ll do super cool activities afterwards. And some of them come from very poor families where life isn’t really easy, and… it’s good for them to have a break from that, even if it’s just for two hours. I would have liked to have had that opportunity, as a kid.”
Under the rainbow, there was a short paragraph:
“Cas, I swear I had no idea that he would come today. I swear!”
“There are also awesome documentaries available!” Cas protested. “Especially animal documentaries.”
“Are you sure you’re okay?”
« Then, why are you rejecting me ? »
Cas grinned. “Yes of course! On Netflix you can start with
“Perfect, then I’ll say goodbye to my friends, and we can leave! You can wait for me here, if you want!”
Dean nodded. “Three queens, and you can make one pair of aces thanks to the one on the board…Not bad, not bad…” He stopped and looked at all the players, one by one.
“Really, Balt, I don’t mind. Playing cards is less noisy than a party with music and dancing.”
He left the room before meeting Cas’ eyes and having to face the hint of disappointment he knew would be in them. Running away was something he always managed to do well. He had nothing special to do, but he couldn’t stand to keep bumping into Cas. He was feeling too embarrassed by the idea that he probably saw he was on this app; he didn’t know how to act towards him, now. He knew his reaction wasn’t mature, but he didn’t feel brave enough to just broach the subject, and it seemed obvious now that he wouldn't be able to pretend that he hadn't seen Cas' profile.
“Listen, Cas… Obviously, we’ll have to talk about all of this later… But for today… I just wanna spend this special day with you… Spend this special day with a special person… Enjoy it… You can just open your gifts, and then, we could finally bake those Christmas cookies… And then, spend the afternoon watching Christmas movies while drinking eggnog and eating cookies. What do you think about that?”
“Yeah?”
“I only behave this way because that’s how people expect me to behave. I thought everyone was pretending, too? And that all the sex jokes weren’t serious? I heard the end of Stevie’s presentation about… asexuality today, and… I’ve never heard about that before. About the difference between romantic attraction and sexual attraction, I didn’t even know sexual attraction was really a thing? I’m not saying that I’m… like you, I never thought about it…. And clearly, I’m pretty curious about sex, and I definitely want to try at some point, because everyone seems to think that it’s great… And if I had to choose someone to try it with, it would be you, Cas… I hope this doesn’t freak you out, but you’re actually the first person I’ve actually thought about having sex with… I’ve never felt this way before, and…”
"Yes, Benny? Yes, we just parked. We're on our way! We're coming, I'm telling you. In two minutes we'll be there. Yes, before the game starts! See you in a minute!"
"Pick a movie while I get the cookies," Dean said as he stood up.
“It’s funny, I never noticed you here. Yet I come regularly.”
After everything Dean had done for Cas in just one week, saying that he was a very nice guy was the least he could do. Dean had been super welcoming and kind with him, very patient, answering his questions about the program, making sure he wouldn’t unnecessarily stress about it. After an afternoon like the one they had just spent, his “only friends, not falling in love with Dean” rule was very difficult to keep in mind.
“It feels really good. As if I had something off my chest. I felt as if I had been lying to them for years… I feel more valid now, too. Saying it out loud to my closest friends, and not to strangers on the Internet or members of this society here is very different. The next step will be to tell my family, I guess, or at least my parents and my sister, but… I don’t think I’m ready yet.”
Without waiting for Cas’ answer, he walked back to the front door of his car, when Cas suddenly remembered something he wanted to ask him.
“Come here,” Charlie said to Cas, pointing at the seat next to her.
“What noise?”
“Come on Cas, of course it’s on me, I’m the one who invited you after all! Besides, I get a discount since I know Ellen.”
“What is wrong with animal documentaries?”
“Thanks for the ride. Do you think you can also pick me up next week?”
Dean didn’t answer for a few minutes, and Cas stared at his phone, hesitating, before finally setting his mind on a last message.
“A sixty-seven Chevrolet Impala. My father gave it to me when I decided to go to college to study mechanical engineering.”
The sound of the slamming door broke the moment.
Cas opened the door. Balthazar was lying in his bed, reading a book.
His stomach gurgled again. Dean chuckled and opened the box. “Thanks. But come on, now, try them before you die from hunger!”
“Please, Cas?” Jack asked.
“I’ve never heard those words before”, his partner said.
He didn’t add anything else for the moment, clearly not wanting to rush Cas. On one hand, Cas was grateful for that, but on the other hand, he knew that it couldn’t last. At some point, what happened needed to be addressed. Ignoring the problem wouldn’t make it disappear, and he knew the more he waited, the more anxious he would get about it.
He stood up, and lightly tapped on Dean’s shoulder to make him stand up too. He dragged him a little out of the way so the children wouldn't hear them talking.
Dean grabbed both cups. “Thanks, Jo, and good luck with the end of your shift! Are you still coming over tonight?”
“Yes I am, actually, I’m wondering whether I’m dreaming because… Even in my dreams, I couldn’t have hoped for a better outcome, and reality is so much better than my dreams, but…”
“Anyway, it was nice meeting you guys, but we have class in 15 minutes, we should probably get going.”
Was Cas’ mind playing with him, or was Dean suddenly listening to the conversation with interest?
“Do you want me to grab some pizza for you? I think there are some slices left. Might be a little cold by now, though,” Dean offered.
“Come on, Balthazar, you know I’m the friendliest person around here!” he defended himself, amused.
“Yes, Dean? Do you have anything to add?” he said, dryly.
“I’m sure you’d be a great player, though,” Balthazar observed. “I really like your style, I could totally see you bluffing. You never tried to play?”
But neither Dean nor Cas paid attention to him.
“Plus the two of us. So I’d say, if you could make one of each flavor for everyone, it might be great… But maybe that’s too much?”
“Cas!” Dean called, slightly panicked.
“What do you mean, “why”?”
They entered the building. Dean slowed down, but was still holding Cas’ hand. He scanned the room, looking for his friends, before suddenly striding again, dragging Cas behind him. He climbed some stairs, before stopping. A big guy stood up and waved at them.
“So, I see that I only need to introduce you to Garth, who is over there,” Dean started. “Since apparently, you already know Charlie…”
“I don’t!” answered Cas, maybe a little bit too quickly.
He had missed the meeting that had taken place the day before, and he had to wait the entire week for the next one. However, the prospect of going to the event made him feel a little better, and a little more lighthearted.
Dean smiled. He put on his jacket before grabbing his phone to type an answer.
Dean put a reassuring hand on his shoulder and Cas’ heart skipped a beat. "Hey, it's okay, Cas, calm down. I was just kidding! But I'll take your word for it, and if next time we end up having a full meal instead of coffees…well, too bad for you!”
Later, in his room, while he was trying to fall asleep, Cas thought a lot about the conversation he had with Meg.
Cas looked at his feet, embarrassed. Dean probably thought he was weird and antisocial. The opposite of Dean, who was literally the definition of cool.
On his way, he stopped in the forest that was next to the bunker; of course, he couldn’t find a proper Christmas tree, but still manage to find some pine branches. Better than nothing.
“Oh, he’s my roommate,” Dean answered.
“Dean, Dean… It’s even better! It’s perfect! It’s better than any Christmas movie, because it is real”.
, Cas thought, but he stayed quiet.
He ordered a black tea and sat with Meg next to one of the windows. It was the beginning of autumn, and the leaves were starting to get red and orange on the trees, not falling yet. Cas always had liked this season, even though it was making him quite melancholy.
“Oh, really? Well, I heard he bats for both teams, maybe he could volunteer to help you to relax? Given his reputation, I’m sure he wouldn’t mind.”
He was a new Cas. A confident Cas, that went to parties, wore a tie because he wanted to. He was a new Cas that wouldn’t be afraid to casually talk to Dean. He was a new Cas that would stop being afraid of everything.
“Well, if everything goes well, that’s the plan, but of course a lot of things could go wrong, and…” Cas started babbling. He wasn’t even sure that he wanted to be a doctor. It was what his father had suggested, sure, but was it what he really wanted?
“Maybe I am,” Cas conceded.
Cas blushed and ran a hand through his hair, looking at his feet, suddenly aware of his sleeping outfit: an old, worn shirt, plain sweatpants, and bare feet. He usually liked to wear button-down shirts, fancy crew-neck pullovers, or nice polo shirts, even when he was with his friends, and he almost felt naked. In comparison, the guy was wearing a casual outfit, nothing fancy, but it made him look cool and at ease: blue jeans with an open plaid shirt over a dark t-shirt. He had a metal pendant hanging from a leather string, and Cas wondered briefly what it represented.
Friday seemed to be a long day for Cas, who found it hard to concentrate. Even Meg noticed: "Cas, please be more attentive. Your notes won't be complete and I won't be able to copy them.” Cas rolled his eyes and snapped back, "Maybe this could be a good opportunity for you to take some notes yourself, for once!” She dismissed the idea with a laugh, as if he had said something particularly funny. Frankly, her, taking notes in class? What an idea! Still, she was right, and Cas decided to turn his attention to the microbiology teacher. Perhaps focusing would help him pass the time more quickly.
But Dean’s shoulder, where Cas’s head was resting, was becoming wet, proof that Cas was crying as well.
“So, I guess we’re just not compatible. We want different things in a relationship. We can’t be together. But he’s so great, and I feel so good when we’re together, as if all my worries were gone, as if I was invincible, I have more confidence in myself and it just feels good to spend time with him… That hurts even more, to know we’ll never be able to be together. I often wish I wasn’t like this. Asexual, I mean. But the truth is that even if I was allosexual – you know, allosexuals are people who aren’t ace – I would still want a romantic relationship. So I can’t blame the situation on my asexuality. It’s just not fair. However, I realize now that burying my asexuality, trying to ignore it, to not think about it, to not talk about it, wasn’t the right thing to do, because it didn’t make it go away. My attraction – or my lack of attraction – didn’t change. There was no point in ignoring it.”
“We have many things to try together,” Cas agreed. “But enough new experiences for today,” he said as he stood up, grabbing Dean’s hand – because now, he could just hold Dean’s hand like that, for no reason! – and dragged him to the living-room. “Let’s have your dream night tonight, now that I know it doesn’t involve any nudity… Let’s order some pie and begin season 12 of Doctor Sexy!”
“It was,” Cas nodded.
“Why did you hide him all this time?” the girl said. “I’ve never seen someone with eyes so blue!”
“It’s been a long time,” Cas agreed after considering the question for a few moments.
The guy frowned. “Castiel?”
“Hey Cas, I didn’t see you yesterday! Your meeting went well?”
When the parents left, Cas let Dean lead the ice breaker games he had prepared, observing the children, trying to memorize their names. Dean regularly looked at him, to see how he was doing, and every time their eyes met, Dean grinned at him, which was making Cas feel more confident in his ability to interact with the kids.
“I love Jo so much,” Dean kept talking, and Cas’ face darkened. “She’s my oldest friend. We grew up together. She’s like the sister I never had – well, as I told you, I have a little brother, Sammy, but yeah. Jo’s like my sister.”
“Yeah, though…”
“Well…” Dean seemed hesitant, which was unusual for him. Cas patiently waited.
Sullen, Dean struggled to fall asleep. He couldn’t help but to feel guilty about his behavior during the day. He knew he couldn’t run away from Cas forever. Besides, it was probably making things worse. Maybe if he had simply acted casually, as if it wasn’t a big deal, he could have made Cas believe it was a joke, or a mistake. Now, given his reaction, it wasn’t possible anymore, there was no way Cas would buy it.
The problem was that “later” came too quickly. The next morning, when Dean woke up, he wondered for a minute whether he had dreamt last night’s events or not. He glanced at his phone, hesitating for a few seconds before unlocking it. The dating app was still open, and Cas still stared at him through the picture of his profile. Dean put the phone back on his bedside table before rubbing his face with both hands. All right, then. He was going to need coffee to face the day.
“Why?”
Cas simply grinned, but it was a special grin. A particularly sincere and wide grin. Dean grinned back, his eyes sparkling, and resumed forming dough balls again, which he then placed on a baking sheet.
“I’m… I’m sorry Dean, I’ll clean everything, I…”
“Perfect,” Dean grinned. “What’s your name, buddy?”
“Wait until I become a real doctor, one day you’ll come back home, and I’ll be baking pie for you, and you won’t even need Doctor Sexy anymore.”
“Don’t apologize. I liked it. Besides…you still have your hair disheveled, which keeps you from looking too uptight – which, believe me, is a compliment, especially coming from me. By the way, how's your head?” he asked, gesturing at his own head.
“No, no, it’s fine, don’t worry.”
« Dean. I’m here, okay ? I’m so glad you finally talked to me… Now, we can fix the situation… »
Dean frowned. Too bothered by the fact he was seeing Cas just after finding his profile on a dating app, he didn’t even question the fact that his now human friend was awake at 3 am. If Cas was waking up in the middle of the night, as he just told Dean, it probably meant he was having nightmares. Dean wasn’t surprised about it, but of course he would have preferred for Cas to not have to experience that. Getting used to a "classic" human life was probably enough of a challenge for the ex-angel, he should not have to deal with the more negative aspects of being human in addition to it.
“Well, we have a poker night at Raphael’s tomorrow. That’s why I won’t be here. And I’m surprised that Dean would miss it.”
He turned in the direction of the voice at the same time as Jody commented, “Hello, Dean, very punctual.”
The student nodded, switching on the projector.
Dean dragged them to Café-in, one of the coffee shops on the campus. They said nothing while they were in line. Cas tried to calm down by pretending to read the menu – even though this was one of his favorite coffee shops and he already knew what he was going to order. He couldn’t believe what was happening. He was going to have coffee with Dean. It was the closest thing to a date he had ever had. And it was with this gorgeous guy. Maybe the other customers would even think that they were having a date. Wow!
“I bet you’re a science major. To be that passionate about space and animals and documentaries…?”
Dean raised an eyebrow and looked back at Cas.
“This is Cas, my roommate,” Balthazar introduced him.
“Okay so you ready to go?”
Charlie and Dean immediately stopped arguing to refocus on the game. Cas cleared his throat.
Cas nodded, and started filling his glass with orange juice. But Balthazar suddenly added, “Who knows, maybe soon you’ll accept Dean’s offer and become addicted to poker and join us!”
Dean stopped.
Dean forced himself to smile. “It’s fine Ben, I saw it was an accident.” Then he turned to Cas to quickly explain the situation: “Ben was dribbling around to try to reach the basket, and he didn’t see Jack and ran into him. Jack fell, apparently his knee is hurt, but I don’t know how bad it is, should we call his mother? An ambulance? What should we do?”
"Ouch," he grunted before quickly turning around.
“Uh, I don’t know Cas. Maybe ask Sam if he has some time? I have to… go run some errands. I’ll see you later”.
“Okay. And he… He often goes back with girls, after parties like that?” Cas asked in a strangled voice. He didn’t even realize he was on the verge of tears; he didn’t even know why. He shouldn’t be that affected by the idea of Dean sleeping with another girl. But it was probably the addition of several factors: the newness of the situation – going to a bar for the first time! – the fact that he, an introvert, had to socialize for two hours, the tiredness he had accumulated over the week, and of course, Dean.
Dean looked at him straight in the eyes - again! - with a gentle, soothing look and Cas immediately felt reassured. He made a slight, shy smile, and in return, Dean beamed. He could still feel Dean's hand resting on his shoulder, almost burning him, and while a minute earlier his heart had been pounding and his thoughts racing, he felt strangely calm. Tea was not the only relaxing thing here: Dean was far more effective.
“Hm… Okay, yeah. Thanks. I’ll – I’ll think about it,” he promised.
“What? Cas, what are you talking about? You don’t want to see me ever again?”
Dean caught a glimpse of hope in Cas’s eye. He still had his hand in his. So he held his gaze and whispered very softly :
“Yeah,” he ended up saying, “you could say that. We’re friends, I guess.”
“Well, I’m no more experienced than you are… So I’m not going to give you any useful advice, but still… I guess the most important thing is that you don’t put pressure on yourself, and focus on enjoying the moments you spend with him, for now. You’ll make things official soon enough.”
Cas couldn’t help but smile. What great timing! He had been on the verge of having an anxiety attack, and Dean’s texts had arrived just in time. Was he supposed to answer? What was he supposed to answer? And
“What? Why?”
“Maybe I can take a look. I’m not an expert with computers, but maybe a fresh pair of eyes will help," he suggested.
Back then, Cas never could have imagined that such a situation could really happen. The idea that Dean could be interested in him had seemed ridiculous. Yet, now, it was almost worse. Because now he knew that Dean wouldn’t reject him. Dean wouldn’t say no to a night with him. The problem wasn’t Dean. It was Cas. “
« We are. »
“But,” she quickly added, probably remembering his initial hesitation when she met him in the corridor, in front of the poster, a few weeks ago, “you don’t have to talk if you don’t want to. You can just stay here and listen to the others. Talking is usually the best way to feel better, but sometimes even just listening, knowing that you’re not alone experiencing some of the feelings you’re experiencing, can help. No one will judge you for who you are or what you say. But in return, of course, you have to respect all the other members of the society, not laugh at them, not criticize them… And another important rule: everything that happens here, stays here. Our meetings are based on trust, so don’t repeat what someone said outside of this room.”
Cas was exhausted. It had been a very long week, and a very long day, and he couldn’t wait to finally get home, lie down in his bed, and try to relax. His weekend would be busy: he had his microbiology lab to prepare for next Monday, some readings to do before Wednesday, and Saturday was his first meeting for the volunteer program he had committed to.
“Oh, there you are! We were looking for you,” Balthazar said. “I was thinking that maybe we could go home soon, Cas? For a first time at the bar, a couple of hours may be enough!”
“Am I… Am I interrupting something?” he asked hesitantly.
He threw his food away and went back to the garage, even though he wasn’t in the mood to just enthusiastically work on his car. After a few hours spent under the hood of the Impala, Dean decided he could make a move in Cas’ direction. After all, everything was his fault. He could start by making dinner and pretending nothing happened. Cas wasn’t a resentful person, if he saw Dean take a step toward him, he probably wouldn't push him away. Proud of his resolve, he stood up, rubbing his hands on his jeans. He was covered in grease, so he decided to take a shower before going to ask Cas what he wanted to eat.
« I know about the deal with the Empty, Cas. Jack told me. And I thought that maybe, if I were treating you harshly, you wouldn’t be happy, and therefore wouldn’t be taken by the Empty… At the beginning, it was easy, because I needed to blame someone for everything… But I can’t bear looking you so devasted anymore, Cas. And, I…. I… You… You seem so sincere when you say you love me. But… I don’t deserve it. Cas, you’re an angel, and I’m so flawed ! I know I’m acting like a fool with you. See, it’s the proof of how imperfect I am. And you’re a perfect being. You literally can’t love me. I wish you could. And, I think that’s also why… I think that’s also why I want to blame you for everything. Because, in that way, you seem less perfect… More… Affordable ? I mean, I’m not perfect. And deep inside, a part of me can’t stop thinking « maybe if he’s not perfect, then we can be equal and maybe, there’s a slight chance that you can actually really love me. But I know it’s not your fault. I know you always tried your best. I know you’ll always be way better than me, and that I’ll never deserve you. So, you know, it’s just better if you hate me for a reason, because of the way I act, and not because of who I am. This way, I can control it. And I can still think that maybe, if I stop acting like a fool, you may love me. The fact is, Cas, that I love you more than I ever loved anybody, and I know that I don’t deserve you. I know I’m not worthy of you. And it hurts so much, that being so harsh with you is a way to protect me… I know it’s selfish, but it’s the only way to cope I found… »
Dean had done a great job at reassuring him last week, but now that it was getting closer, Cas was starting to worry again. What if he couldn’t handle the kids? What if they didn’t like him? His negative thoughts started to accumulate, and soon he wasn’t paying attention to the bees on the screen anymore. So many things could go wrong! What if one of the kids got injured? What if two of the kids fought with each other? How would he react? What was he supposed to do? Why didn’t Jody and Donna provide a complete training to all the volunteers? What if…
CAS: “If it does, it means we have been going on dates every day for five weeks”
“Wait, you mean… That sports guy you’ve been talking to me about… is Dean’s roommate?”
“Yes,” Ben agreed, joining the conversation. “Is it because he won at FIFA against you? It's okay, Cas, he had more time to practice and he got the best controller. Next time you could switch!”
Dean hadn’t promised him anything; he hadn't even known that Cas would come to that party! And sure, he had winked at him and joked with him in a flirty way a few times, but it was his classic behaviour with everyone. Cas wasn't special to him.
“Close your eyes,” Dean whispered.
“You know that with the life we’re living, we can’t afford to just leave like that without any explanation. I thought you got yourself into some trouble.”
“That being said, I’m not sex-repulsed,” he resumed. “I’m not against the idea of having sex, if it’s something that my future boyfriend desires. A metaphor I found online said that you don’t have to be hungry to eat. You can even like what you eat, and want to eat it, even if you don’t feel the need to. I’m telling you this, because at first I was really confused, and didn’t get why I could be curious about sex, and as I said, I’m not absolutely against it… I do have a libido, I do… sometimes, I…”
“It does help, what you’re saying,” he said. “Even though the children will probably like you more than me. Especially if we go with the bad cop/good cop strategy you suggested…”
Knowing that he would soon be able to “deal with" this question, Cas felt lighter. His Saturday afternoon with Dean and the children went way better than the week before. Cas had been angry, but not really angry at Dean, mostly angry at himself, because he had let himself hope for nothing, and because he had buried his asexuality, thinking that ignoring it would make it less real and would make him more
. But was he really too worried? Was he worrying enough to bother Dean?
“Well, if you say that you consider homework to be 'boring' in front of them, I’m sure they think you’re cool." Cas smiled.
Dean was so focused on the baking that he didn’t notice Cas’ internal debate. He looked adorable. The entire situation was so domestic… Cas thought for a few minutes, deciding to contemplate Dean instead… And, as it often did with him, Dean’s magic worked: within a few minutes, he felt considerably better, more relaxed, more grounded. Ready to enjoy the moment, and to not overthink it. Dean probably felt Cas’ gaze on him, because he turned in his direction.
Lisa rolled her eyes. “Not what you should have taken away from my proposition, Dean. So what do you think? You want me to come back to your place with you? I could take care of you…”
“He wasn't mad at you, but you were obviously angry at him, but Ben and I couldn't understand why.”
Dean leaned in even closer. “Hey, Cas,” he said.
"Yes, of course. Thanks for thinking of me, Dean."
Dean simply nodded. “And what are you drinking?”
“I did…”
“Oh, I’ve seen him at parties before. And we have a common friend,” she answered evasively. “But I don’t know him personally. Why, are you interested?” she smirked.
Cas nodded. “Yes, I did.”
“I look forward to seeing that next week,” Cas replied, not convinced.
“You know how to make a man happy,” Dean joked. “And as for nudity… It will actually depend which episode we’re watching!”
Dean came back with a chocolate cookie - Cas' favorite, Dean had remembered! - still warm. He froze for a moment when he saw Cas' choice, before bursting into laughter.
“See you on Friday, Dean!”
It was probably the weirdest love confession Dean ever heard, but after the discussion they just had, he appreciated it.
Cas checked the projector. It was switched on. The wire seemed to be connected in the right way…He tried to unplug and reconnect the wire, but nothing changed. Then he checked the computer settings.
Dean whistled. “Oooh, a future doctor, eh?”
“Until I met someone, a few months ago. I didn’t expect it at all, but it just happened. We met, and this guy was so great that I fell in love with him. The problem is that he is my complete opposite. He’s cool, and relaxed, and easy-going, and beautiful, so beautiful, and nice, and caring, and everyone knows him and likes him, and he likes being surrounded by people, and he’s very good at it, actually! We couldn’t be more different. But, the worst part is that he likes to flirt. I knew he had the reputation of being a womanizer, but I also witnessed it. I saw him making sex jokes, flirting, talking about bringing girls back home… I also learned that he’s bisexual, so I should have been happy; he even told me, one day when he was drunk, that he thought I was “hot.” The thing is, we both want different things. He apparently likes to have casual sex, with no strings attached. But what I’m interested in is a relationship,precisely those strings. And the sex is what I’m not interested in. So…”
“If I do that… Won’t I look ridiculous?”
Cas shrugged back at him and just leaned over him to grab the remote and press the “play” button.
It was too late to back down now. Not to mention, he was hungry.
« I lost mom. I lost Jack. I lost everything I thought I had, everything I believed in. The only things I have left are Sam and you. I’m afraid to lose you, Cas, because I’ve already lost you before, and I couldn’t bear losing you again. I can’t go through everything without you ! »
“No Cas. I can’t blame you for… Just go prepare yourself, please. We’ll fix this”.
"I think he's waiting downstairs for you to watch your movie, by the way."
Cas squinted, and Dean gave him a questioning look. Cas just smiled, and Dean smiled back, and they stayed like that, settling into a comfortable silence, for a while. Until Cas’ stomach started gurgling, breaking the moment.
Every other player followed them and put two red chips on the table. Then a guy turned over one of the cards that was displayed next to the chips. The girl next to Balthazar gasped a little.
Cas wasn’t sure he liked the turn the conversation was taking. He scowled.
“Thank you for liking my profile, Dean. But wouldn’t it be more convenient to talk in person?”
A new question arose in Dean’s mind: what should he do now? Should he just close the app and pretend nothing happened? Could he see Cas again, talk to him, look at him in the eyes, pretending he didn’t know Cas was a) on a dating app, b) attracted to men? Besides, if Dean had seen Cas’ profile, it meant Cas probably had seen Dean’s. If it was the case, why didn’t he mention it? Dean tried to remember whether Cas’ behavior towards him had changed recently. He didn’t think so. Cas didn’t seem to be more uncomfortable than usual when they were together. It probably meant that Cas hadn’t seen Dean’s profile yet. Should Dean ignore the situation and wait for Cas to mention it when he inevitably found Dean’s profile? Was it too late to completely delete his profile to make sure Cas wouldn’t find it?
“Is it going to be a problem?” He looked at his watch. “I can still call everyone to reschedule…”
“Cas? You can come in?” Balthazar’s surprised voice answered.
“With you, I am.”
Cas rolled his eyes.
