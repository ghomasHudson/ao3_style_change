James came over to Clint’s side of the couch, greeting Tony with a smile but quickly turning his gaze back onto his sleeping fella, running his fingers through his hair and then leaning to press a few featherlight kisses to his forehead.
Tony looked at the door, hoping that they would bring more food any minute now. Or at least water. He was parched.
“Yes.” Benni nodded and Tony agreed, already trying to figure out what he could do together with his brother on a day like that.
Steve and James, in turn, would take over control of Bakuto’s finances and his business. Effective immediately, they shut down his minor trafficking rings and quickly ordered the execution of all of his men that they could find. There was no telling exactly how far Bakuto’s control reached—just like how Steve had minor operations around Ireland and James in Russia—so there would always be those they missed. However, they were hoping that their quite public and unnecessarily violent ways of handling those they had captured would send a strong enough message to anyone looking to try something.
“You’re looking better,” Steve said from where he sat in a chair that was slightly too small for him, in his relaxing clothes—just a pair of high-waisted black trousers with a white t-shirt tucked in and socks—a contented look on his face.
“So here’s my thinking,” Clint said, lowering his voice even more and not fighting any of Tony’s worries because they were justified. “They haven’t come to get you yet. I think this man wants something from Steve
“Mr Romanov is on his way,” Phil said and honestly, Clint felt the tightening in his chest loosen up a little.
“No,” Clint protested softly and James pulled away immediately, terrified that he had hurt Clint more.
“I’m angry all the time. Just can’t seem to hit hard enough,” he said, running his thumb over the knuckles of his hand that were still bruised from the sandbag and now from their morning visit. Steve ran his tongue over his teeth in irritation. “Killing Bakuto… I don’t even feel any better.”
“Then we’ll do that together.” James snorted lightly and Steve looked away from his muffin over to him. “What?”
Before they got inside, James clocked the sound of two more bodies hitting the snow and then Steve and Dugan rounded the corner to slip inside with them.
There was a knock and then Phil entered carrying everything he had been asked for. He sat it all down on the desk and then returned to the door, looking at James, a question on his face.
“Fine.” Rhodey motioned for him to follow but Tony stopped in front of Steve. “Tony,” Rhodey nearly hissed. Tony considered inviting Steve on the tour to keep things civil—in other words, to stop Rhodey from choking him and throwing him out—but he figured Rhodey was angry enough for the time being.
“Yeah,” he mumbled, trying to regain some composure if he even had such a thing to begin with. “You said bring back anything I deemed worthy. Thought we might as well use the food that’s still useable.” He pointed to the wheel of cheese the men were unpacking. “It’s more than enough.”
He trailed off and James waited, holding his breath, for a solid minute to see if he would say more. Clint was asleep, snoring now, and James released the breath, feeling cold all over. Clint thought he was going to die. Did he think James had given up on him? Or traded him for what Bakuto wanted?
, he thought to himself. Never again would he put Tony in a position to relive or remember what had happened if Steve could help it. He would even keep his own gun out of sight in case it might trigger him.
James held up the folder Dmitri had given him, shaking it lightly. “Anything in here worth reading?” Loki nodded. “And do you know anywhere Bakuto does business?” It wasn’t like he ever invited Steve or James for coffee.
James hated so much that the brightest, purest bit of sunshine in this world was in so much pain and there wasn’t a goddamn thing he could do about it. At least no more than he already was. It was infuriating and depressing but now wasn’t the time to dwell on how he felt, Clint’s feelings were priority number one now and always. He also made a mental note to call the doctor as soon as possible about getting Clint’s cast removed.
Steve shook his head. “230. 234 is the next block down,” he said, pointing out the window in the direction the man would need to go.
He looked over his notes from the whole evening. So the Chinese were running heroin and opium, laundering money and counterfeiting it and other valuables. The Italians had most of the police force under their control and high-up political connections, keeping elections rigged and things right where they all wanted them. No goody-two-shoes mayor was going to come in and try to clean up the crime in the city. That’s what these meetings were for, to keep the crime organized and stamp out what wasn’t. If there was anything happening or that had been witnessed and the activity did not belong to one of the six groups there, it was eliminated and that’s why James had asked his follow-up questions at the end.
“I just already wasn’t having the best morning when it happened,” he admitted, his voice low. “It reminded me of
Tony hesitated and swallowed dryly. Why would he ask that? He had to clear his throat slightly and answered just as quietly, “This morning when he saw my brother sharing the bed with me.”
They talked a bit longer about this and that, staying away from the topics of Steve and James for the moment and when it got later, they headed upstairs together. Sarah wished Tony goodnight and went to check on Steve, trying to open the door but it was locked. She didn’t knock. She knew that meant he didn’t want any company and she’d respect that. For now.
“Okay,” Steve said, and he pulled his hand away, angling himself better and slowly, snail-speed slow, sliding in just a little. He knew it was different and he stopped, his self-control off the charts at this point, to ask Tony again if he was okay. “If you can’t talk, just nod or shake your head.”
He looked around the room, feeling a stinging pain behind his eyes. The room was dark and for the moment he was grateful because of the pounding he felt in his skull but he knew that darkness was intentional. He wondered if he was somewhere surrounded by other buildings that blocked out the light because he could see a tiny barred window at the very top of the back wall with very little light coming through.
“He’s fine. Malnourished and dehydrated, like you, a few bruises and a fractured rib too but otherwise fine.”
He wouldn’t ask him that. It wouldn’t be very wise of him. Instead he nodded at James, gave him a polite smile and said “Thank you. Once again.”
like him, which made Tony wonder when he had managed to actually smell him. And who did that anyway? What was wrong with him lately?
“I promise you, love,” he said, kissing up his side, “I’m alright. Doc cleared me.” He couldn’t get enough of Tony, every spot he kissed was hot and perfect and every sound made and reaction he had just made things even better. He had wanted this for way too long and now to finally be getting it? Steve couldn’t imagine it any better than it was.
fucking hair is out of place on either of their heads,” Steve began, holding up a finger, “just know that we’ll be holding you personally responsible. Whatever happens to them, happens to you.”
Tony hummed, enjoying Steve’s hands on his body. He moved his hands over Steve’s back. He had no idea what he was supposed to do or what would make Steve happy but that was a worry for another day. He would ask him.
“Believe it or not, that doesn’t really bring me much comfort to think waking at four in the morning is more sleep than usual,” he said, his tone half-worried, half-teasing. He dragged a hand down his face and moved to sit on the side of Tony’s bed, done standing for now. “I’m okay. I’ll probably just shower, have a kip and head to the gym,” he told him, running a hand through his hair and messing it up. It was a habit he had when he was tired, to mess with his hair, but he didn’t want to sleep.
Their mob bosses went one way and Tony guided Clint the other. The tapping of a dog’s paws on the floor was new and would take some getting used to.
Clint stopped talking and Tony started. Sarah hadn’t seen him carry on conversation since he’d come home. She sneaked away as quietly as possible and made her way downstairs to the basement, stopping at the door, knocking, and when she heard her son tell her to come in, she opened it and closed it again behind her.
First they did Benni’s homework. He didn’t need Tony’s help and when Tony went over it, he couldn’t find a single mistake, which filled him with even more pride.
Luckily Benni wasn’t awake yet when Tony entered his room to wake the boy and get him ready as well. He knew that Benni was capable of taking care of himself but he also wanted to make sure the boy knew that Tony was still always there for him.
He chose a book of crime short stories and settled on one of the couches to read the first one. It wasn’t a very interesting or long one but it took Tony a long time to relax and focus on the words he was reading. Why did he feel like Steve was watching him? He did allow Tony to come here and read. Only his bedroom was off limits. Right?
Dmitri took the Patek first. It was beautifully made, lightweight and sleek. The face was large and the leather band was soft against his fingertips. The face displayed the time, day of the week, and the month. It had a very simplistic elegance about it that Dmitri personally felt could very easily sum up Clint. While Clint seemed rough around the edges, Dmitri had seen him shoot downstairs in the range and knew that Clint had a precision and elegance about him that rivaled James, he just chose not to showcase it.
“I don’t know yet but it doesn’t look good,” James told her. “He lost a lot of blood and I lost him once on the ride over.”
“Guess I’m done,” Steve said bitterly, tossing the book onto the table beside the bed. “What is it?”
He hummed a melody while getting a towel and fresh underwear for himself. After his shower he’d go and find his Steve to make sure he was alright. Not that he didn’t believe him, but Steve had a tendency to keep everything to himself despite his promise not to do that anymore.
Dmitri went and picked up the ambulance, deciding that they would still use it for the element of surprise and because it would most likely be the best way to bring Clint and Tony back judging by the state of them in those photos.
“Queens. Hm.” James turned to look at Steve who raised one questioning eyebrow as he spoke. “Queens is a big place. You positive he didn’t say anything else?”
She smiled. “Lots to talk about. Thought we needed a bit longer than a few quick words after dinner.” He nodded. “You busy?”
Tony kept his arms around Steve, wanting him close. “Like the best little brother in the world,” he said with a smile. “He thinks kissing is disgusting though.”
As for his own name… Tony wasn’t quite sure. That is, until he simply decided to do what his gut told him to. He wrote down the name he had gone by ever since his life had begun anew.
James glared at Steve and then finally gave in to the small smile. He stood up straighter, breathing in and out deeply. “Alright.” He cracked his neck and said, “Grab anything important and let’s go.”
He gave Sarah a smile. “Painful. But it’s actually not that bad,” he lied and tried a piece of the cake instead of focusing on his aching and tired body. It was very sweet but not too sweet and it was delicious. The others continued to talk to each other while Tony enjoyed his dessert and listened.
“Just some water, please,” he said, still trying to remember everything he said. When Tony returned, Steve spoke again. “I’m still sorry. I shouldn’t have done that in the first place.”
“That was terrible and you should be ashamed.” Tony had to laugh about it, simply because it made it easier. He waved goodbye to everyone on their way out.
Clint hadn’t quite realized just how easily he accepted the things James told and asked of him. Of course there was the occasional push back but only when he felt like teasing him or trying to ruin a surprise but the majority of the time, Clint’s answer was a simple ‘yes.’ He’d never been one to just ‘follow instructions’ or ‘do as he was told.’ Especially not when they came from other people.
“I should’ve killed you when I had the chance,” James said, and Loki noticed the knife that was in his hands now, his knuckles white with how tightly he was gripping the handle. Beside him Steve wasn’t doing any better. He wanted to grab Loki by his greasy hair and toss him off the Brooklyn Bridge.
For a second he thought about talking to James and asking him what he could do. But then his stubbornness and pride kicked in, even if it wasn’t the right time or place. He wanted to be there for Steve. Without anyone’s help or advice. It was the least he could do for him.
Tony sat up straight, regretting what he had said. Did he give away precious information to the last person he should have trusted?
“I, uh… well, first off, I’m not as interesting as you might think,” he admitted, trying to prepare himself for the worst. He rubbed a hand across the back of his neck, feeling how hot the skin was there and hoping the blush wouldn’t spread to his face like it always did.
Feeling the warmth of the house, Tony managed to calm himself and look directly at Steve. “Where’s Howard? Where… do you keep him?”
but he also knew those negative thoughts and feelings weren’t gone just yet. Even now he wanted to ask Tony if anything Steve had done had hurt him but he didn’t want to ruin the mood and, more importantly, Tony’s mood. “Feeling sleepy now.”
“The living room is not an area of the house that falls under the system’s rules,” Steve argued, Tony beside him not sure whether he should laugh or grimace. They were all adults but they were also very good at proving that statement wrong.
“It’s so lovely to see you all together,” Sarah said, a warm smile on her face. She had suggested Clint and James stay so that he and Tony could help one another, but she was also just tired of the people she cared for being hurt and so far away. She just wanted a period of peace and closeness with her family.
“I’m okay, it’s okay, baby,” Steve said, holding out his arm for Tony to hug him. Tony stood, leaning down carefully to hug him and then he pressed a kiss to Steve’s jaw, then his chin and finally his lips.
James got off on the fifth floor, said there was something he needed to do, didn’t give specifics, and left them, his men following him out of the elevator. That left Steve, Dugan and Tony heading down to the ground floor.
Steve shrugged. “If it helps Tony and Clint, I’m on board with anything. We just need to find out if
Steve nodded, his way of saying thanks, and then he stood, kissed Sarah’s cheek, the top of Benni’s head, and then squeezed James’ shoulder, offering Clint a nod. He took Tony’s hand and they disappeared around the corner heading for the stairs.
“Dancing?” He asked surprised. “I never learned how to dance. Pepper took me to a dance once but I refused to ask anyone to dance.” How often did he have to say that word? It was embarrassing.
“W-What?” He asked utterly confused, not having expected Steve to follow him. “Leave you? I’d only ever leave if you asked me to,” he answered truthfully.
“You got everything?” Steve asked, looking at the two suitcases sitting at the front door. They hadn’t packed much and occasionally James would go back home to bring something either of them wanted anyway.
“Alright,” James said, not confident in Tony’s ability but trusting his determination at least. “Yes.”
He moved to stand, removing his arm from Tony’s shoulders and lifting Benni easily to drop him beside his brother. Steve stretched and everything ached from sleeping upright, all his joints cracking. How did he manage to make his late twenties feel so old? “I’m going to shower,” he told them, and headed out.
James shrugged. “Is either better than the other? Either they thought we had abandoned them or they thought we couldn’t protect them in the first place.”
“So you wanted to talk to me?” Tony asked. He was nervous. He wasn’t sure if this was going to be a good or bad talk and he couldn’t help but notice how good Steve looked in full gear. His blond hair a little matted to his forehead from wearing the helmet and his slim waist and broad shoulders highlighted by the suspenders.
He heard a door slam and looked up. It was nearby which meant they would come for him any second now. Tony pressed a kiss to the metal and put it under the cot in a way that kept it out of plain sight. Steve would be looking. He would find it. He would know that Tony was waiting for him.
“What happened?” Sarah asked, frowning. She’d always waited for Steve to come out and tell her about himself and his relationship with James and when he never did, she didn’t want to intrude on him and his life by asking him about it. Now she could and she’d always wanted to know why they didn’t keep it up.
Clint watched his mouth carefully. He noticed Tony was over-enunciating for his benefit and appreciated the effort. His eyes widened at that information. That hadn’t even occurred to him and he didn’t know why. Maybe because he couldn’t hear if the men were frantic or not. He just knew they were angry and then they had moved.
It occurred to Steve in that moment that he didn’t have on a shirt either. Sam at least was wearing boxers and a tank top. Steve was the one to shake his head in response to Tony’s question.
long yet. He knew James wasn’t the same as him, but was that really all the time he needed or did he really see this meeting as being important enough to have to deal with seeing Steve for a few hours.
He came into the kitchen, not quite fully awake and made his way to the coffee pot, turning it on when a noise caught his attention and he turned to see a man asleep on their couch.
Steve nodded towards his book. “Whatcha reading?” Tony’s new clothes also hadn’t escaped his notice but he figured getting into a conversation over Sarah buying him wardrobes worth of expensive clothing would just be more tiring. They could have that talk tomorrow.
He laughed and shook his head, quickly wiping his eyes. “I’m sorry. It’s just…” He trailed off and shrugged. It’s just what? That he couldn’t quite handle the thought of not getting out of there? Of dying sickly thin, bruised, filthy and in torn clothes?
He led him over to the globe that was standing beside one of the bookshelves and he turned it so Ireland was front and center. He pointed to the northernmost tip, so far north it was nearly Scotland and honestly, if Tony didn’t mind, Steve might just plan a little ferry trip to Islay and pick himself up some scotch.
James’ wrath—but if she were to get caught in the crossfire of an attempt on his life, he’d never forgive himself.
“Me too,” Clint said with a soft smile. “It’s called Hawkeye after my nickname during the war. It’s in Midtown. It’s a cool place. Very… accepting, if you know what I mean.”
“So, Tony,” James said, and he seemed to be the real talker though his public persona was much like Steve’s—quiet, concise, angry. “How would you have done it? Caught the bird’s notice?”
He came further into the living room and over to them both, bending first to press a kiss to Natalia’s cheek and then one to Clint’s forehead. James
He pulled away again and finished his coffee, standing and bending once more to press a kiss to Tony’s hair.
The man yelped, moving away again, but quickly coming for Clint again who was ready this time, raising his arm and pushing the knife into his neck. The man continued another half-step in Clint’s direction, reaching up to feel the knife but not having the strength to pull it out. He fell to his knees and then onto his back and Clint watched until he stopped breathing, his heart racing and head still spinning. He reached up and felt blood on the back of his head. It was nothing major but it would definitely earn him a scolding from James later when—
As Clint had suspected, James was able to get him an appointment for that afternoon. Dr Reyes was as polite and efficient as ever, giving Clint a quick once-over while James stood at the back of the room. Clint was silently impressed with Dr Reyes’ cool under such close and intense observation from James but she did what needed to be done without a mistake or too long of a pause.
“You’ve never been the quiet one. That was always Steve,” she said. Dmitri left them alone. James turned, his face blank.
“Welcome,” Tony greeted her, poking his eggs. With Sarah there he needed to eat, not wanting to worry her when there was nothing to worry about. He could feel himself closing up again like he did yesterday after what happened. And then there was Steve's question. When he finished his eggs he watched Steve get his seconds and looked him up and down. No. Not a brother.
The anger in his voice made Tony take a step back instinctively. How he really didn’t want to answer the question. At the same time he couldn’t think of an excuse. Every second he didn’t answer made him more nervous. He simply couldn’t reply.
“I understood,” he told him a little sheepishly. “I’ve been trying to learn a few words.” He felt the blush but continued talking. “Talking to you about these things
“It’s absolutely beautiful,” Tony answered his question. Benni was sitting at the table silently and Tony was proud that he showed he had good manners. There wasn’t much else Tony could have taught him over the years. “I might need a map to find my way around.” He smiled and rested a hand on the silver knife, his fingers running over the cold and beautiful metal.
He hummed into the kiss. It was so simple and yet everything he had missed. “Alright. I just… I’ll need a nap. And maybe a little more water?” He knew that there was food in front of him but for some unknown reason he was hesitant to actually eat. There was so much going on in his body and head that he couldn’t focus on one thing.
Sarah was already in the kitchen when Tony and Benni got there. The room was filled with delicious and mouth-watering smells and the dining table was absolutely beautiful and enormous compared to what Tony had seen.
She waited a moment in the foyer, knowing the way but just in case there was business going on that she should remain oblivious to, she decided against showing herself to the office.
“A-are you finally going to k-kill me? T-took you long enough,” Bakuto managed, which James was sure had been incredibly painful seeing as Steve had broken four of his ribs the last time they were there and James had bruised his windpipe. “You’re w-weak.”
“If he wants to be. Ask him, wouldja? And bring me an Irish coffee please,” he said, finishing his coffee and handing him the mug.
James nodded, kissed him, and disappeared. Clint turned to Natalia, intertwining their fingers and she raised his hand to kiss the back of it, talking to him while they waited for James to return.
“Just text him, Tony. I realize I can’t stop you,” he sighed, helping himself to more pasta and an unnecessary amount of parmesan.
“You come to me asking a favor, Romanov? That’s very unusual of you,” Madame Linda Gao said the next day, coming over to sit at the table with James, leaning her cane against the arm of her chair.
“Have I been known to be less of one and more of the other or is this just an observation you’re making?” James chuckled, coming over to stand in front of him. He was shirtless, only in his trousers, just as many scars and marks on him as Steve. He reached down and put a hand on Steve’s shoulder, and then it snaked up his neck until he was cradling his face.
For the duration of the drive he focused all his energy and thoughts on Steve. It was either that or panic about a situation he couldn’t change. Steve would find him. He would get him out no matter where it was they were taking him. That was all he could think of and that was all that mattered.
Clint nodded. That was the name he remembered and it made him feel better about the guy sitting beside him.
“No.” He smiled and nuzzled back against him. “You’re a good leader.” It was true. Tony had no idea what he was doing. Following Steve’s lead was easy though.
Clint didn’t like to open up and talk about his feelings. James had noticed that this applied to both positive and negative emotions. Clint just wasn’t very open about them. He liked to mask how he felt with a joke and a smile, any attempt to distract really but he was quite fond of humor.
It wasn’t that he worried about anyone having anything to say, he just didn’t want to be bothered with it.
“Understood,” Natalia said, glancing at Maria. “Looks like we’ll be getting a holiday as well, my dear.”
Steve didn’t even say anything besides moaning. He got up and easily lifted Tony to turn him onto his stomach, pressing kisses down his neck, his back, across his ass, all the way down to the back of his knees and up again.
“I know,” Steve replied, his voice a strange mix of pain, fear and disgust. “It looks just like when Howard got to him. It makes me
“You know, I really wanted to go on vacation with Steve somewhere far away one day. It’s a shame we didn’t do it when we could have.”
“Come, there’s something I want to talk to you about,” he said and went to his room with Benni. He took his time to look at his brother and really see the changes from before. Even the way the boy walked had changed. No longer slouching or taking small, anxious steps.
They made sure to visit every animal they could, walking around and taking their sweet time. They even had overpriced and stale sandwiches and Tony absolutely loved it.
For now it was a relief to see signs that it had been there for a few hours now. No one had come into the building and there were only so many people that could fit into one car. That would be useful information for Steve and James and that thought made Tony smile ever so slightly.
When the fluttering in his heart and stomach got to be too much he looked away, still smiling. “Apart from my arm I’m all healed.” It was a lie, of course it was, but he wanted it to be true.
“We,” Jones said, snapping his fingers to pull Howard’s attention back to him and away from Steve, “are not here to collect. Consider this a house-call.”
Clint nodded, Sarah pressed another kiss to his forehead, and then she was gone. James was making Clint a bowl of the soup when Clint turned to him and said, “Thank you.”
James lifted the piece of fruit to his mouth and took a bite, chewing slowly as he looked at the map. Steve came over and stood on his other side, also eating his snack.
Clint and Tony knew the basics of the trips but Steve and James left out details to surprise them with. Nothing that might backfire, just simple luxuries and safeties that they both would enjoy.
Steve had a mini-snore that woke him but only barely and he caught the end of Tony’s sentence. “Wanna talk. Wanna talk to ya, Tony,” he agreed, his eyes shutting again but he knew in his sleep-clouded mind that he
He worked on the things he had planned for the day and organized a few files that needed some sorting.
,” James said, kissing Sarah’s cheek and she kissed his back. She lifted her eyebrows, asking him a silent question and he nodded. She made an impressed face and he chuckled.
Steve kept his voice low so it wouldn’t travel any farther than Tony, not even to Dugan and Jones. He was grinding his jaw, his eyes on Tony. “When was the last time?” The question did come out whispered but strained, between gritted teeth.
He put a hand on either side of Tony’s face, gently tipping it up and catching his lips in a kiss. Tony tasted like coffee and he smelled like apples. It was enough to drive a man with less control crazy. Steve let out his third sigh in less than five minutes and pulled away from Tony’s lips, staring into his eyes.
“Knock knock,” Sarah said as she entered the office, closing the door behind her. “Hate to interrupt but I’ve brought food.”
truth. “And giving dog tags isn’t something you expect a gift in return for. These dog tags around your neck mean you’re mine and that is enough of a gift for me.”
Clint smiled at her. “It’s not just love that makes me do the things I do. I trust him. I know he wouldn’t ask me to do anything that would hurt me.”
It was two days later that they both had a bit more energy from the increase in food and were chatting quietly with one another. It had been a quiet day. One silent food delivery and that was it. They didn’t let their guard down but they did find themselves having more desire to talk.
Tony melted against Steve. He was so close to ignoring everyone else, locking the door and letting Steve have his way with him then and there. Instead he took a few deep breaths and nodded. If that was what he wanted, he would get it.
“That is not his name,” his father growled and let go of Tony. “Now prepare the food! Everything needs to be perfect.”
Benni out of there without ever having to lift a hand to anyone. I didn’t do that. I’m not better than you in any way. I told you last night, I
“No. I’m not needed tomorrow.” He might’ve been but he would not be going. And in all truth, a lot of what he’d handled lately did not warrant his presence normally but he was sending a message. With the business he and James had handled this morning, the message had been sent loud and clear. Now Steve could sit back a little and hand back over to Dugan, Jones and Falsworth the work they already normally did.
They needed one that was out of business but the phones still worked. Obviously Bakuto had bought it out and was keeping Clint and Tony at the location, using the company van to decrease chances of anyone thinking anything weird about it being parked around the city and more than likely, it was the location from which Bakuto called them.
Tony didn’t have to tell Benni to help the others clear the table and once again he was quite proud of his brother. He hadn’t realized how grown he really was and that he didn’t need constant reminders for everything.
dinner courtesy of Sarah, which I appreciate since she was a very Catholic woman,” James explained. “I think the idea that her son is considered an abomination has made her a little less devout though.”
“Rude, but true. Just tell me. Single? Straight? Recovering from the tragic death of the love of his life and emotionally closed off, just waiting for the perfect guy to come along and mend his broken, muscled heart?”
“I wasn’t sure what you’d want to do once you were better. You know I’d have provided you someplace else to stay until you got back on your feet but I wanted to make sure that in the near future, you’d be more than secure. If I couldn’t keep you, I’d make sure you were alright wherever you went.” He was giving Tony a small smile. He loved the expressions going across Tony’s face.
Tony stared at Clint when he protected him. Steve protecting and looking out for him was one thing but to have another tall blond guy doing the same thing was just funny to him.
Someone was moving towards a door and said something Tony couldn’t understand. His time to rest was probably over now. Slowly he turned to look around and was honestly surprised he recognized a hospital room of sorts. Not that Tony had ever seen a room like that. It was almost as big as their apartment, way more spacious, brighter, and definitely cleaner.
Tony remained in bed even after Steve had gotten up again. He didn’t want to make him feel bad and pretended to sleep. That was until he heard hushed voices and quiet steps on the stairs and in the hallway. When Steve finally came back and Tony was comfortable again, he decided to say something. “Love you more.”
Dmitri snapped his fingers excitedly as an idea came to him, all heads turning in his direction. “Your cars are dead giveaways. Just like Bakuto’s was,” he said and James made a circular motion with his hand, indicating that Dmitri should expand on his thought. “So we need something unremarkable.”
Sadly no one was looking to sell a Russian-American billionaire an airplane. So now he was in the process of buying up the first eight seats on the airplane. If they had to fly with others, they at least weren’t going to be surrounded by them.
His little brother caught his attention and he brought him back upstairs to their apartment, taking a few snacks for Peter with him. Tony also used the chance to check his looks in the mirror, which he regretted deeply. He quickly combed through his hair and tried to fix it, rolling up the other sleeve as well and getting a clean apron.
“The reservation’s under Stark. Tony Stark.” She checked her tablet and then guided him inside to where Tony was already sitting.
“Worse. Am I dying?” James asked and Clint snorted, pressing a kiss to his dark hair. “Thank you,” he said quietly, closing his eyes. James often forgot that he needed this. It had been so long since he had had someone in his life to provide it. Sarah rose to the occasion sometimes but she wasn’t always around and she had a son. Before he’d gone off to war, it had been Steve and before Steve it had been Anna, James’ sister.
Since Steve had been back home, things had gone back to something Tony was willing to call normal, despite how foreign parts of it still felt. He had a job that didn’t strain him physically and he enjoyed three meals a day thanks to Sarah and her delicious cooking. She was still upset that Tony ate as little as he did but she accepted it, for now at least. Tony got to sleep next to Steve every night in his bed and his arms. Benni was doing great in school, was smiling, and had grown a lot.
“Right in front of you is dinner,” Tony answered without looking at him. “And you’ve still got enough to drink in that bottle.” He scoffed and looked at the water that was obviously now hot enough to do the dishes with.
“No, I want you to go eat dinner and be a good boy,” Tony said more firmly. He was running out of energy again. Benni gave him a small kiss and headed downstairs. Once he was gone Tony laid back down and closed his eyes again, hoping he could sleep some more. Of course he couldn’t, but giving his body rest also helped. Not with his feelings or the things he saw and remembered. But it was something. Probably.
Bucky shrugged, leaning his chair back. “You’ve been having a dry spell lately. I mean, there was that girl from Human Resources—Lilian or whatever—but that barely lasted a month. Before that was, uh… damn, a while ago, huh? I can’t even remember.”
Steve’s eyes had fallen to Tony’s lips while he spoke and then flashed back up as he heard his words. “Yes,” he said, carefully holding back the way he
The cold hurt him all around, which was terrible but made it a little easier to get used to it as he pressed against the wall of the building and peeked around the corner to see if there were guards there. He couldn’t hear anything but the wind. It was eerie silent here, which he wasn’t used to.
“Did you hear that? C’mon, we’re eating now,” Benni said and tried to unwrap Tony’s arms from around his legs.
They hugged briefly and then Steve left to peek into the boys’ room and make sure all was still well, saying he would be back down to walk James all the way out. Sarah walked James down into the basement, reaching out to link her arm with his as they descended the stairs.
“Anything for mama Rogers,” he said, turning to acknowledge her and Steve did too, love on his face for his mother.
Clint was nursing a pretty painful black eye. In an attempt to keep his plans from seeming suspicious, he had been antagonizing the guards all day—yelling, banging on the door, asking for a pillow had all been on the to-do list so far and for whatever reason, they had only bothered to come in once and shut him up. Maybe they were as tired of being stuck in that building as Clint and Tony were.
He waited for Tony to nod and then continued. “All the rooms are individual beds, so sharing shouldn’t raise any suspicion but we will dine occasionally in the dining hall. Room service is an option, though, I’d rather not raise attention by never leaving our rooms, alright?”
Steve moved around to sit on the other side of his desk, right in front of Tony, his hands together in his lap. He ran his tongue along the inside of his cheek, trying to calm himself before he spoke, his eyes on Tony who wouldn’t look up.
Steve thought about laughing and making things light but it seemed like this question came from somewhere deep down, something more than a light inquiry. “Nothing. There’s nothing you could ever do to make me not want you around, Tony.”
With all of that in mind, Steve shrugged and said, “I don’t think we need it. At this point, we’re just being greedy.”
Feeling warm and all things positive from what Steve said, Tony smiled back at him until he heard him say those words.
Tony almost laughed at it and pressed the letter above his heart. Mr Rogers was threatening his father over what he had done to him.
When the door was shut and the things deposited—most going to the living room where there was a small kitchenette—Steve stood and went over to inspect the machine but really he just wanted to stand close to Tony so he could whisper to him.
Instinctively, Tony curled his fingers around Clint’s. He tried to say something, or at least move his lips for Clint to read, but he didn’t have an ounce of strength left and passed out again.
They’d explored a few spots in the station and then Tony was bored and had had enough. He was behaving so well—Rhodey should be proud—but for real now, he wanted to talk to Steve.
Steve found the note after showering and immediately called Jones who was more than happy to get a free lunch courtesy of Steve in exchange for keeping an eye on Tony and Benni from a distance.
“Speaking of… well, nothing I just wanna ask how the tour with Stark and Rhodes went,” Bucky said and Steve rolled his eyes.
“I... really don’t want you to turn me on,” he said and bit his own lower lip. “Or touch me. Stop touching me,” he joked weakly. “Steve, just use me, please.”
“What’s it to you?” he asked. The past weeks he hadn’t had anyone to talk to. It felt awkward to talk now, almost like he forgot how it worked.
When he spoke, his voice was eerily calm. “There’s a good chance that had you told me this earlier, they would still be here. So just know that what Rogers will do and what I will do will be two separate punishments. I don’t know if you’re religious but if I were you, I’d start praying Bakuto doesn’t lay a hand on them.”
“I do,” Clint said, seeming to question it himself. “Being around Tony, talking to him—it helps but—”
There was also the option that Clint had been out for a couple hours and it was dark now but he didn’t much like that option. He wasn’t ready to not know the day and time just yet. Or maybe that was better. Maybe it would keep him focused on escaping rather than how much time had passed.
“Steve!” Tony said carefully, as if saying that name out loud might wake him from this beautiful dream.
“I’m fine,” Tony confirmed with a smile. “Perfect even,” he added with his voice barely more than a whisper. The next song was even slower, so they were swaying softly. Tony was very aware of every little thing and at the same time his mind was empty and there was only Steve.
“It’s that kid you wanted to see,” he explained. Cap nodded, a grim smile on his face and opened his drawer. There she was, old faithful—his semi-automatic pistol. He motioned for him to come in and Dugan moved back enough to put a hand on the kid’s back and shove him in.
The other three glanced between them, wondering who would win. Would they go or keep searching? It was an unusual circumstance because it was Steve talking James out of spontaneity for once. Dmitri focused on James, narrowing his eyes because his boss never acted without a plan, even a half-concocted one.
When Bakuto sent the latest photos of Clint and Tony, he had done so via messenger. He always had, they assumed, but this one wasn’t so successful at making a stealthy delivery. Dugan had spotted him and Dmitri had taken him down with a single knife to the leg. Now the poor unfortunate soul was theirs to play with until he gave them what they wanted.
Dugan came and grabbed the supplies, carrying them for Tony who was obviously very injured. He opened the car door for him back on the street now and waited for Tony to carefully slide in before shutting it. He liked the kid: he was punctual, polite and quiet.
Tony nodded and smiled, still sleepy but determined to stay awake because he was alone with Steve in his favorite room of their house. “This right now is especially nice.” He stretched but flinched and inhaled sharply when he felt pain in his side. Healing took time, he knew that from experience. However, that didn’t mean that he didn’t hate the process.
“Actually,” he said, thinking about Bucky's suggestion, “swing a right here on Bedford, Romanoff. There’s a good place at the end of the street. Saves us the extra travel.” It wasn’t a lie but if he had an ulterior motive too, well, that was his business.
“If you’re feeling up to it, you can start washing those potatoes for me,” she told him. “Steve and James, you two can set the table. Benni, can you read me the recipes?” Sarah was firing out orders like a drill sergeant. Definitely the nicest drill sergeant ever but still.
They took James’ offer to heart and ordered steak, all of them. Steak and sides and bread and when the champagne ran out, James ordered them a very expensive red wine that went nicely with their steaks. They were seated at a round table, Clint to James’ left and Maria to his right so that it looked like the husbands had simply seated their wives together to talk about “womanly things” so they could talk about “manly things,” whatever the hell either of those things meant.
Before Clint could say anything, the guards brought them their daily ration of food. It didn’t escape Tony’s attention that they came in with two additional guards who both carried guns. It was probably to intimidate Tony and Clint and make them think twice about trying anything again.
Clint sighed. Maybe this wasn’t such a good idea after all. At least at home he could speak freely and not worry about it freaking anyone out.
It was a while back. Maybe a week or two after he’d first moved in and James had suggested taking a shower together, which quickly became a lot more than a shower but then James had washed Clint’s hair after everything was over, James’ fingers scratching his scalp and making his knees go weaker than than he had a moment ago. If Clint wasn’t already in love, he was then.
Despite his sprinting thoughts, he steeled himself and knocked on the door. It swung open and before Tony could even take in all six feet of Steve Rogers, he was hit with a smell so delicious his mouth instantly watered and he realized that while worrying about his date, he’d forgotten to have lunch.
“You can always return should you change your mind,” Monet told him, retrieving the box for the ring and then the box that box went into.
He had spent the last couple of weeks stepping in and out of jewelry stores in between the time he spent handling some last minute business. James had given him the addresses of a few places he knew of as well and Steve was taking some time here and there to inspect them.
Clint all but collapsed on the ground beside Tony, his movements graceless but he was sure Natalia would forgive him. He wasn’t even sure why he was thinking about that. Maybe he just missed her.
Tony couldn’t help but notice the cold tone when it came to Clint. Now was not the time to talk about it and he would check up on Clint in a minute himself. That didn’t mean he wouldn’t keep it in mind to ask Steve about it.
you want. So maybe snatch a spare outfit from here and we’ll see what happens.” Because he would be home. There was no other way this would go. Soon enough they’d be back together at home.
“No, don’t go! Please!” Tony reached out to take Steve’s hand and clung to it. The thought of not having Steve around him was scary. Or did he
“Told you, downhill. And no, just my pride.” His eyes went to the door and when nothing happened he said, “Listen, I know you’re not a fan of the escape idea but what if I had a fairly solid plan?”
People were waving from the docks as well as on the ship. Some were crying, others cheering. After this second of distraction Tony looked back to the statue, craning his neck since it was rather close now. He watched it get smaller and smaller the further away the ship took them out. He stayed there until he couldn’t see it anymore and it disappeared. Somehow it relaxed him.
Steve wanted Tony to travel and see the world, even if to just one place for now. He wanted to get him out of New York for sure, away from the noise and chaos, away from all the bad memories connected to the city and into a new surrounding where the two of them could form all brand new memories that were theirs and theirs alone. He wanted to give Tony a honeymoon even if he couldn’t give him a wedding.
James sat his glass down and ran his hands through his hair, sighing deeply though it came out jagged and strained. Steve downed his drink and poured another.
Steve had a stalker. Someone he had slept with months ago. It was a couple of weeks after the act in that he began popping up, standing on street corners staring at the building, appearing where he knew Steve frequented, spending his nights at James’ brothel hoping to be chosen by Steve again but Steve had rules: never the same person twice, man or woman. He didn’t want anyone getting attached and he saw now that that was inevitable.
“Stay here?” James repeated, surprised. “Do you really think that would be for the best? It’s not going to be too many people? Overwhelm Tony?” Steve had been explaining to James to take it slow with Tony when they went back upstairs just like James had explained to not to touch Clint near his head.
“I’m sure James can arrange things but on your first day after a concussion it wouldn’t be a good idea.” He leaned against the bed and shrugged. “I’m okay. He’s lying there and I’ll be there when he wakes up.”
James laughed. “You’d kill me if I tried.” He turned to leave again but then stopped to add one more thing. “But then again, I also wouldn’t try.”
When dinner was over, they talked for a minute, no more, and then Steve had Tony pressed against his bedroom wall. Sarah had knowingly said she’d stay downstairs with Benni and read a couple more hours and take care of the boy.
When he caught those brown eyes, he didn’t care how much work he’d been doing. He didn’t care how tired he was or how his muscles ached. Those eyes and the person attached to them being safe and sound—Benni as well—made it all worth it.
He sat up, running his hands through his hair and taking deep breaths, trying to keep them quiet so he wouldn’t wake Tony if he was asleep.
“Yes,” was all he managed to say, lying on his stomach and trying to catch his breath. He was sore but absolutely satisfied and happy that he was able to give Steve that. If his body allowed he’d continue but even Steve seemed to have reached his limits. He loved to see him exhausted like that, the sweat rolling down his chest and his forehead. There was nothing more beautiful to Tony. “Steve?” He smiled. “I love you.”
Tony pushed himself off the table he was leaning against and walked to Steve who was still grinning at him. Not too sure of how much pain he’d still be in, Tony hugged him carefully until Steve wrapped his arms tightly around him. “It’s so good to see you up and in a suit again,” he said softly, taking a deep breath. There was still the lingering scent of hospital and sanitizer but there was also Steve’s cologne and his soap. It took him some effort and convincing himself to pull away and take a step back. Steve was back. And he was wearing too much.
“I’m okay,” Clint said, giving Tony his usual thumbs up and cheeky grin despite how much the left side of his face ached. He would wait to see what would happen first before he spoke, before he shared with Tony everything he had just learned but in the meantime he repeated fifty-left-twenty-left-down-thirty so he wouldn’t forget.
“Nah, just waiting for someone worth my time,” Clint retorted. The man sneered and bent down to be in Clint’s space.
? And then he noticed the window that led out to the fire escape was open, pushed up, but why would anyone climb three stories and break in to sleep on their couch?
the Irish kept tipping him. He couldn’t depend on that. Every cent was better than nothing and he was grateful for it.
“Should still be having lunch with Jones and Falsworth.” They’d taken Tony out with them seeing as Steve wanted him to be able to be productive without getting caught up in Steve’s bad mood.
“Coffee sounds great and I’ve been dying to try yours. Sarah was telling me all about it the other day,” Clint said. The comfort he felt there with Tony was almost making him want to nap. “And yeah, finally got myself all cleaned up.”
Clint was leaning back against James’ chest, a photo album in his hands that James was pointing to as he explained what Clint was seeing in each one.
Dmitri nodded and left out and James was immediately back in his head, not focused on the present, as he thought of something else he could do for Clint. Maybe he needed some company. He would run it by—
“Hey,” he said and Carol threw herself at him, pressing kisses all over his face that made him smile. Sam and Tony watched on from a distance. “I’m alive, honey.”
Steve chuckled. “You just said the same thing twice. James being an asshole and James speaking his mind, there’s no difference.” But it didn’t take long for the mood to drop. He didn’t want to die and leave Tony with unanswered questions or doubts but Tony didn’t want to talk about it so Steve dropped it. “Okay,” he said, pulling Tony into his arms.
The door opened and it surprised both Steve and Dugan to see Dmitri. He looked stoic and deadly as ever, the corner of his mouth twitching upward ever so slightly when he locked eyes with Dugan and then Steve.
But he also got bored easily, so he headed into the back to the storeroom and started cleaning it out, taking boxes and crates out to the back alley to be picked up by the sanitation workers.
“And what makes you so sure it’s not some unknown opponent?” she countered, wanting to cover all bases.
“Steve,” James barked and Steve cursed and pulled away, Howard gasping for breath now that his neck had been released. He coughed and let his head drop.
James pondered it for a minute, tapping the knife to his own chin, his forearm pushed painfully hard against Howard’s neck. “You know what, I don’t think any, Steve.”
When they finally got into bed, Clint could barely keep his eyes open. He was clean and his body felt better and less battered than it had in a long while. His head was on James’ chest and James was playing with his hair, making sleep seem like the only option.
When the car pulled up in front of Delmonico’s, Clint felt his stomach churn nervously. He wasn’t even sure why. Honestly there were so many reasons but none of them really mattered when he thought about it. He wasn’t going in there as a gay man in a gay relationship. He was entering as a straight-passing man alongside his legal straight-passing wife. They had the rings to prove it.
“You look tired,” he observed, worried about the damp strands of hair falling on Steve’s forehead even though Tony kept combing them back. “Eat a little, hm? I’m right here.” It wasn’t a lot he could offer but he knew that Steve, not unlike him, needed as much physical contact as he could get.
“Alright.” He took the fountain pen Steve had given him and with Tony’s help he wrote his name on the paper.
“I have eaten but I will eat again and there’s nothing anyone can do to stop me,” Dugan said, patting his stomach. Steve chuckled.
It was definitely quieter without Benni chasing Lucky around and Lucky seemed to miss the kid too, sometimes going upstairs in search of him, whining when he didn’t find him. And Clint missed Sarah a lot more than he thought he would. He hadn’t expected her to take to him as well as she did or for him to respond to it so well but she was an absolutely lovely person and Clint looked forward to seeing her again.
Natalia and James exchanged a look when Maria finally made it over to the couch beside Natalia. “Sorry, I’ve just never been inside a mob boss’ office.”
“What’ve you done?” She asked, narrowing her eyes. He chuckled. “The last time you were this nice, you’d thrown that brick through Mr Reynold’s window.”
“I’m sorry I didn’t come visit. Every time I wanted to go outside, I froze.” He looked into the cup.
The table was set and they took their seats, Steve holding Sarah and Tony’s hands for grace. Steve ate like there was no tomorrow. The hospital food was ugh and even though Sarah had brought home cooking and other delicious treats, there was nothing like eating at your own table in your own house with it hot and fresh.
Clint nodded, gave Tony a small smile, and took a sip, closing his eyes at the feeling of water washing down his throat. He was so thirsty and what he wouldn’t give for a bath.
When he didn’t see anything else, he whistled and in came a young woman with a medical kit. Steve instructed Tony to sit while she looked him over.
“Falsworth and Jones don’t know anything about this part of my life. Dugan does but let me ease him into the idea of you and me. You know we’re safe in the house and my office when we’re alone but anywhere outside? Never.” Steve wasn’t even planning on taking Tony with him on business outings, only family outings. “Anything else you
“Expensive suit, well built, Asian. Wait,” she paused and James heard the receiver set down on something as Natalia moved closer to inspect the body. She pushed up a sleeve and saw a tattoo. “James?”
He couldn’t pinpoint the exact moment he’d fallen for Tony but he also couldn’t remember what it was like before he felt this way, and, more importantly, he couldn’t imagine a life without him.
With half the orange in his mouth he leaned in to kiss Steve. At first it was a small kiss but before he could pull away Steve was already holding him in place to deepen the kiss hungrily. Tony gave in and kissed him back just the same. The longing, the relief, the confidence—it all mixed together and he poured it all into the kiss.
He sat down on the chair left of James and Sarah and stared at the painting on the wall. A flower bouquet on a table next to a cup of coffee and a candle on the small table as well. He would be fine. Soon someone would come in and tell them that the operation went well and they could see Steve, who would be out of here in a matter of days tops. And while Tony stared at the picture, he waited for that someone to come and tell them exactly that.
Steve thought about it for a while. Thought about the times during the drinks every so often when he and James would talk about it. “So far,” he began, slowly, “it hasn’t gone away. But again, I’ve had a bit more exposure than you. But it gets… easier? Well, you learn to manage it. To live with it most days rather than in fear of it.” He didn’t want Tony to know what this felt like. That’s why he never wanted to send him on out of office work. When he’d told him about Howard and where they were keeping him, when he’d explained the reason why he was still alive, Steve had hoped against hope that Tony would tell him to take care of it. Tell him he never wanted to see Howard again and Steve would’ve gone and done the job before he could change his mind. He didn’t want Tony to know what this felt like but Steve and James were never getting their innocence back, it didn’t matter. “I had hoped you’d say you didn’t want to do it.”
Tony didn’t let the beautiful decoration and interior distract him and he went down the hall to the kitchen and from there to the dining area in the back of the living room. Two men were in the living room, sitting in complete silence. It was a beautiful and warm room, expensive looking all over. Once again Tony found himself reminded of how poorly he must look. For a moment he hesitated, not knowing which table was meant but seeing as they sat there Tony moved to the desk and set the plate with sandwiches down and started unwrapping it carefully.
He was cursing up a storm as he felt the telltale signs that he was close, never taking his eyes off Tony under him. He slapped his thigh again and seconds later he came, nearly doubling over, his forehead on Tony’s chest, his hips still moving, twitching, but slowing. Another few seconds and Tony came a second time.
“Hello?” he called out, suddenly realizing he had no idea where to go. Rhodey had never invited him for a tour due to their rule about ‘quiet zones’.
, as if he’d been born to wear that suit. Sarah had even styled his hair. Steve had grown to love Tony’s usual looks, but now seeing him in that brown tweed three-piece with nicely accompanying dark blue tie and light blue shirt, Steve was very impressed.
“My men are coming with the ambulance,” James said reassuringly, dropping his tough-as-hell facade when only in the presence of his friend. “You know he will get the best possible care.”
“I am,” he told him, turning to Tony and Steve. “Besides, Lucky doesn’t like the car. He’ll need someone to hold him and he can’t do that
Tony wrapped his arms around Steve and almost fell asleep right then and there. “Wait. Clint, do you need anything?” Everything in him demanded warmth and rest but at the same time he couldn’t just leave Clint there.
“Mary, stop, back off,” Steve barked and moved to Tony, squatting down in front of him. Something he never did. Steve never let himself be lower than others, look up to them. He hesitantly reached out to Tony, a hand on his knee. “What if I do it?”
“You gonna introduce me to your new friends?” He asked, noticing the kiss mark on James’ neck. Rarely did James let one-nighters leave marks on him so that meant this was more than a one time thing.
Now he stared up at them through one good eye, the other swollen shut from one of the punches James had thrown out a short time ago.
“I’ll do what I damn well please but thanks a bunch for the update,” James said coldly, flipping through a book. There were no guards at Steve’s door, he’d sent them away, knowing what kinds of things were likely to come from Steve’s mouth and he wouldn’t be letting anyone hear that. Steve’s private life was just that—private.
Slowly, very slowly, Tony lifted his shirt. Unable to pull it off by himself, Mr Rogers helped him. There he was, in his undershirt in front of a man he didn’t even know on a first name basis. His heart was beating out of his chest and he couldn’t keep his eyes open as the undershirt was stripped from his upper body as well.
“James. You heard him. You heard his voice, you heard him get hit. You spend a lot of time reassuring me and comforting me and—“
“Two fractures and the rest are just bruised. You’ll be able to laugh at your own jokes soon enough,” James reassured him with a gentle smile, his fingers still on Clint’s face just in case James blinked too long and he disappeared. He needed the constant contact to convince himself Clint was back and real.
. “I just got home. I just wanted to check on you before I turned in.” He hoped that telling the truth would earn him some good karma points and not come back to haunt him.
Loki immediately turned the gun around and handed it to Dmitri who unloaded it, tossing the bullets out into the hallway and the gun he threw behind him into Loki’s bedroom.
“They’re here,” Steve said, getting up so he could go help with their things, offering his hand to Tony.
Tony sighed and rubbed his sweaty hands on his legs. “How would you even test a theory like that?” he asked, confused. Where did he come up with these things? “Why don’t you want to stay here? This one star accommodation not good enough?” he joked weakly.
He knew they meant well and that they wanted to comfort him but those words meant nothing to Tony. He was the one to blame. His best hadn’t been good enough after all. “I should bring him to bed,” Tony said and got up slowly. Since Benni had been eating a lot more he also got heavier but Tony refused to not carry his brother to bed. He wouldn’t fail him again.
Clint looked at Tony quickly, taking in his posture and facial expressions. He had probably missed Steve as much as Clint had missed James. Even when they were stuck together, the only topic that calmed Tony seemed to be Steve.
“You all are a bunch of animals! Settle down,” Steve told them but he was smiling. He was standing at the head of the table in the firehouse kitchen with his hands raised trying to get his kooky work family to quiet down.
Tony whined, refusing to move away from the comfortable warmth. He nuzzled against Clint again, promising himself only five more minutes.
Just when he opened the door to go downstairs and do the chores for her, Steve came up the stairs together with Sarah. He looked more miserable than before and still managed to give Tony a quiet “Good night.” Again he reminded himself that it wasn’t his place to ask what might have happened. There was nothing he could do for him.
“Hear that? I grew on him,” Clint said, grinning over at Natalia who was sitting at the end of the bed by his good foot.
He pressed a soft kiss to Tony’s forehead and decided to close his eyes for a while longer until Tony woke or Sarah came to get them for breakfast.
“Aren’t we all?” Steve said, walking again on his way to Chief Fury’s office. Bucky came from the bathrooms and joined them on their walk, a lieutenant flanking Steve on either side. “Perfect, I was just about to come look for you,” Steve told Bucky, “that diner fire we put out yesterday was flagged by OFI. They found a timer embedded near the exposed wiring. I need you too, Rhodes.”
“Well,” Steve said, blushing, “Sam helped me with the bread.” Tony’s eyes went to the bread on the table. He figured it was just freshly bought from a bakery but Steve had
“Really?” Steve asked, excited like a small child became when told they were going to get the thing they loved. “Tony.” He kissed him again. “I’ve wanted this for so long…
Finally finished with all of his gift shopping (for now), James and Dmitri headed out of the department store and back to the car. The watch would be ready for pickup in two days. James hoped Clint would like it. He wanted to get him something that could be for Clint what the dog tags were for James—a reminder of his love, that he was there for him even when he couldn’t physically be, that they were always connected even when apart.
When Steve got the call his blood ran cold and then hot less than a second later. He grabbed his jacket and his guns.
Tony immediately thought of ten different occasions when he was hurt all over, tired, and hungry and still had to do everything around the house and the deli. What difference did a few cuts make? He could feel how bitter those thoughts made him.
“And I’ve never been able to get them to stop,” Pinky said, his accent thick and it was like music to Steve’s ears. Dugan and Jones had gotten a bit Americanized and listening to Pinky was a bittersweet reminder of how much of Steve’s own accent had been sacrificed to that Brooklynization. “Pleasure to meet ya, lad. Good to see you, Cap.”
“Hello, love,” Steve said, sitting the briefcase down on the floor. He came over to wrap his arms around Tony’s waist from behind and press kisses to his neck. “Just had a nice chat with Benni. He told me he’s going to miss me.” Steve smiled into the next kiss he pressed onto Tony’s neck, still feeling warmed by Benni’s obvious affection for him.
Steve plopped onto the couch across from Tony with a sigh, his head back and arms stretched along the back of the couch. He unbuttoned his overshirt and pulled his shirt untucked. He was tired of suits and he just wanted to be home in his comfortable clothes. After a moment he lifted his head enough to look at Tony, his own eyes barely open. The last couple weeks had been… a
When they got out, he helped him towel off, Clint sitting on a soft bench James had purchased for this very reason. He helped him to moisturize as well, the last thing he wanted was for his healing injuries to get dry or his skin to crack in the cold January weather.
He didn’t let James’ identity stop him from getting to know James or from flirting. He didn’t let getting chased that night stop him from walking home. He didn’t let all the things Bakuto and his men had done to him stop him from calling Bakuto a stupid fuck
“What does this mean for you now? You said only Dugan knows. Will you even be okay with your own men?” Tony was scared, yes, but he also needed to know. “And... what if… you’re not? Will you fight them?”
,” Sarah teased James, “so I don’t think you have to worry about being too loud for Tony. Plus, Clint seems to be in better spirits as well with Tony there.”
Dugan and Dmitri had been promoted, in a sense, and now handled a lot more than before, so Jones and Vitaly took on protection detail for Steve and James.
As quietly as possible he headed out to the room in which Dugan was resting. After knocking, Tony entered without waiting for an answer.
“If I adopt you and Benni, not only can you choose which name will officially be yours but you will also be part of our family officially.”
“What’s that?” Cap asked, sipping his drink and eyeing the neck of his companion. There was a bruise. “I don’t believe someone got a lick in on
Bucky raised an eyebrow. “Actual food or…?” He made a gesture that made Steve blush and clear his throat.
“Yes and yes. The entire house is at your disposal. Though, I do ask that you stay out of our bedroom and my office.”
“July is hot.” Tony swallowed a bit when he said that, his mind automatically going to a sleeping, half-naked Steve with bedhead. Yes, Steve was
It was almost two hours later that Steve and James returned, blood spattered and drained. The moment they walked in, Natalia was rounding the corner for them, still pissed that she hadn’t been allowed to join.
“Always, dumbass. Always means always.” He ducked his head, unable to look at Steve’s face any longer. He knew enough about his face to know exactly what he saw there. “Since we were teenagers. I just… you didn’t—“
“No. I like being needed. I like helping. Gives me purpose.” He sat up a little more so he could look at James properly. “Maybe, since you can’t seem to agree that you’ve improved my life in so many ways already, it’s still to come. Maybe it’ll happen next week. Next month. When we finally go to France.
And Steve had been busy. It had been the busiest two days of the summer so far and that was really saying something when he factored in the possibility of them having stumbled upon a serial arsonist targeting diners in Brooklyn and Queens.
“Because it’s something for Steve and me only. We’ll all go on a vacation with Sarah and you when it’s summer and we have time for you,” Tony said, his legs crossed under him. He didn’t want to take any of the blankets. He knew that if he made himself too comfortable and warm, he’d have a hard time heading back home.
Tony nodded, rubbing his tired, burning eyes. He gave Clint’s hand another squeeze before letting it go and Steve wheeled him back into his room. The relief he felt over Clint being okay and able to hear again helped Tony to relax a little more.
He finished his food, having no real memory of even eating it, and they all headed to the living room to sit in front of the fire with their dessert. Steve was forcing himself to be with them because he knew it was the right thing to do. Socialize, interact, be with those he cared about and who cared about him. It was hard but he could do this much and then he would shower and crawl back into bed.
They spoke some more until it was time to start preparing dinner. Benni was helping out tonight. He was always happy to see Pepper, especially now that he knew that he was still attending the wedding with Sarah.
“I’ve told you before I’d do anything for you. Moving in here for a while barely even counts, especially, like Steve said, if it helps you. Both of you,” James told him, briefly touching Clint’s cheek and then dropping his hand again.
Clint walked over to the door, standing by it and closing his eyes as he counted to ten and then loudly shouted, “Hey!”
From behind him he heard Steve snoring softly and his heart nearly skipped a beat. He snored. Steve Rogers, head of the Irish mob
“Alright!” Benni jumped off Tony’s lap and followed Sarah back into the kitchen. Once again Tony was reminded of how lucky he was that Sarah took such great care of his little brother and that she left nothing for Tony to worry about.
It was a poorly lit room and the little barred window did nothing to help. Tony decided to sit down on the cot in the corner for now to try and sort his thoughts. He didn’t know where he was or how long they had been driving. The only thing he heard on their way there were freighter horns, which meant they were either close to or had crossed a bridge at one point.
Clint. This was no one’s fault except for whatever idiot had taken them and that was what Natalia had reminded them both, pressing herself in between them in a display of courage that not even Dugan and Dmitri were willing to show and forcefully pushing them apart.
It was a bomb. A timer, just like the other ones their serial arsonist had used. Only this time a different method. They could only assume he was behind the fire, knowing it would lead Steve and Bucky, who he knew had chased him that day, right where he wanted them but Bucky didn’t go in. He wasn’t needed.
“I was trying to help her with her pirouettes and I guess she’d eaten a pretty big breakfast before lessons. As she whipped her little head back around to me, I was covered.”
“So don’t make me move too much. Steve, come on. You can’t just say those things and then behave!” Even though he was frustrated that things weren’t happening, he couldn’t help but fall even more for this considerate and caring person that Steve was for him. “
Tony pulled out the gun, aimed at Howard’s forehead and said, “Go to hell, Howard,” before pulling the trigger.
“Hm,” he hummed. “I’m sorry for your loss,” he added after a moment of thought. “Well, next time your father is sure to be out for the whole day, call this number,” he told him, reaching into his jacket pocket and pulling out a nice, expensive-looking silver pen. He jotted down a number and slid it across to Tony. “That’s this phone right here.” He pointed to the one sat on his desk.
Maintaining a certain image through their deli Tony managed to keep everything going, despite how little sleep he got or how cold their apartment was in order to keep the heating costs at bare minimum. Pepper came to help him, even though he couldn’t always pay her on time. He made sure to have enough money for the Irish when they came to collect every two weeks. When and where Howard managed to spend all their money he wondered but he couldn’t find an answer.
Steve closed his hand around Tony’s and scooted closer until he had Tony right up against him, still holding his hand. He reached with his free hand and put it around Tony’s shoulders, pulling him into his side. “This okay?” he asked, not holding him tightly so Tony could move away if he wanted or needed.
Clint took a bite of the food, chewing happily, and then he shook his head. “No, I was just surprised,” he said with a shrug, plain and simple. He hadn’t really had any thoughts about it either negative or positive. “Has this really been bothering you ever since then? If so, I’m sorry.”
“So you’re just giving me these and telling me you have business to take care of?” Tony put the papers down and walked over to press a very loving kiss on his lips. “Better make it a quick call and come home to me soon, okay?” He combed through Steve’s hair and pressed another kiss on his forehead.
A month went by and Tony was back to taking each day as it came, facing it with less and less strength. The medicine Mr Rogers—Steve—had given him had helped a lot with the blisters and wounds, as well as any new wounds that were inflicted upon him. With Howard drinking more and more Tony had to use the saved and stolen money to pay for necessities and with each dollar he took, his heart broke a little more. Every dollar less was slimming his chances of ever getting away from Howard, from this life.
“Well then, find someplace you like and take me there. I’m free again this Friday, if that works for you.”
.” He slid his hands into Steve’s shirt as much as he could from this angle, his hands resting on Steve’s tense shoulders.
He flexed to pull Tony in closer to him so he could nuzzle his nose into his hair, closing his eyes and inhaling deeply. He didn’t ever want to forget that smell.
Benni thought about it while he put everything away neatly and then turned to Tony and shrugged. “I just like learning.”
“Any suggestions? I’m definitely open to suggestions,” Clint said because if there was a way to find out how many men were keeping watch at night that
“Oh god, don’t remind me,” Bucky groaned, finally happy with the coffee, pouring a cup for everyone in the room.
Tony watched the men leave and smiled when he noticed how a passerby reacted to seeing them, then looked at the deli and quickly moved on. Another man stopped walking and greeted Mr Rogers. Tony couldn’t help but wonder what having that much power must feel like.
He’d spent the majority of his morning in his room with the door closed, just lying on his bed deep in thought. What on earth was he thinking last night? Or rather, this morning.
“Course I do, Rhodey-boo,” he said and then recited the schedule off by heart much to Rhodey’s apparent surprise. “See? I’ve been listening and also noticing,” he told him, stabbing his fork at him and then down into the tortellini on his plate. “I just thought the ranks might change things up.”
“Just talking to Tony today about marriage, is all.” That melancholy note was still there in his tone, in the soft way he formed his words.
Clint was at the table, his hands raised and mouth opened as though he were paused in the middle of telling a story, which he was, and Tony was at the table with him, a cup of coffee in front of him while he listened to another of Clint’s shenanigans.
As silently as possible he moved out of the room and to his. He could hear the others talking downstairs but he didn’t want to intrude more than he already had. He went to the bathroom and washed himself as much as he could with one hand, brushed his teeth and got dressed in his usual sleeping clothes that made him feel even more out of place. All the money he had was probably still on the floor in his room. Thinking back to that night made him shudder.
Benni agreed to stay and yawned in the middle of his sentence which made Steve chuckle. When Benni sent a look his way for laughing, Steve pretended like he was coughing and took another cookie.
“Firstly, I have a contact at Bergdorf Goodman who has a ring you might be interested in,” James said, eating something as he spoke. “When you go in, ask for Monet St. Croix and tell her Winter sent you. She’s holding a few items for you that she thinks you might like. I told her what you were looking for.”
“Steve told me about you and your situation a long time ago, kept me updated. One of your previous neighbors, Sergei, is one of my men, he also reported back. I was meeting with Sergei
It was so quiet that it made his ears ring. No cars, no yelling, no loud machines. Just the sound of waves crashing in the distance and the wind blowing. It was peaceful but borderline eerie.
“You’ve packed plenty and, yes, I do plan to buy a few things there for the both of us,” he said, stifling a yawn. He was tired and though it wasn’t that late yet, he wanted to sleep. He’d already done his packing earlier and now he was ready for a shower and a solid eight hours for once.
Before heading out into the cold Steve wrapped Tony in his coat and Dugan opened the car door for him. It was nice to not be exposed to the icy wind.
Together they finished doing the dishes, putting everything away and Sarah put the finishing touches on the table which was now covered under a beautiful table cloth. Tony changed the water in the vase and put the flowers back into it. Somehow he knew that Steve had gotten his mother those flowers.
“Going out?” The man asked and Tony nodded. “Do you need a ride?” Tony wanted to be polite and decline but then he realized that there was no reason to do so. He nodded and was led to a nearby car. James would know. He probably already knew where Tony was going. It made no difference if he took a car or not.
Tony looked carefully at Steve. Once he had figured out what to look out for—the way he clenched his jaw, the position of his shoulders and the way he looked at him—he could tell when Steve’s mood was shifting. His face didn’t give it away but the smaller details did.
They pulled up around back and went inside, James’ right hand man, Dmitri opening the back exit for them and greeting them both. Steve ate his apple as they made their way to the fifth floor where there was a permanently closed wing. It had been closed since the start of the Great Depression and World War Two hadn’t seen it in operation either. James tended to use it for unsavory business. Now it was being used for just one person.
Tony considered going back downstairs but Sarah would notice that something was up. He needed to sort his thoughts before he could go back to them. He headed for his bathroom and locked the door behind him.
Clint and James exchanged a look while Benni continued to explain about the moon and how it was different from the planets. Sarah listened attentively, James nodded as though he was listening and he was, kind of, but he was also focused on Clint.
“It’s because I care that I’m telling you one more time to come downstairs and eat with us.” He nodded and got up. She took his hand and he let her, leading him down to the table where he saw Benni only waiting patiently, staring at the cooked duck in front of him sending a heavenly smell his way.
James chuckled and motioned for Clint to come over. He walked around the desk and plopped himself down in James’ lap gracelessly, his hands on James’ chest. James tilted his head back, gazing up at Clint lovingly. He ran his hands down Clint’s shoulders to his biceps and then the rest of the way along his arms until he could wrap his hands around Clint’s wrists.
“Oh my god,” Clint said, lifting his leg and rolling his ankle around. “I will never take having two unobstructed legs for granted ever again. Everything is better without it.”
Clint followed him, Lucky at his heels, and James got him set up in his favorite seat at the table, made him another warm drink, and got started on a nice, filling comfort meal. He decided to make Clint’s favorite—just baked chicken and mashed potatoes with a mushroom cream sauce, some vegetables on the side and another homemade bread Sarah had dropped off yesterday.
She nudged his side with her elbow playfully but Clint heard the sad note to her voice and he wrapped his arm around her and pulled her in even closer. They stayed like that for a minute, maybe longer. Their pizzas and drinks were forgotten and Natalia rested her head on Clint’s shoulder, closing her eyes.
She hummed her understanding, nodded. She still felt like there was more she could have done to let him know how safe he was with her, how much she loved him no matter what. She squeezed his hands and he pressed a kiss into her hair.
“Okay,” Benni agreed happily, leaning up a little to look at Clint. “Do you speak another language?” Benni seemed very interested in the chance to learn as much as he could.
“No, sadly we have to have meat and vegetables for dinner but we can have more cookies for dessert,” Sarah compromised. She didn’t mind spoiling him and ruining his appetite today. He needed it.
“You and me both,” Steve said, eating the food but not really tasting it. His mind had since moved on to other things. Well, moved
No one used that knife but James. The most anyone else got to touch that knife was either when it was stuck in their body or Dmitri was taking it to clean it off afterwards.
“Alright,” Clint said, and James helped him stand, hooking Clint’s arm around his shoulder and sliding the crutches under his arms. “I’ll take a glass of milk.”
Steve went back to work on Monday but only spent half the day in the actual office building and the first half in his room at home at his desk, going over new recruit files to get back to Jones by the end of the day.
Clint smiled. “The head of the Russian mob makes me pancakes with blueberry smiles in them,” Clint said, chuckling. “I wonder if they even know just how much we love them. You ever just hang out in Steve’s office and watch him? I think James has finally gotten used to my stalker tendencies.”
It was so bright. Too bright to handle after weeks in dim light and darkness. He covered his eyes and recognized the smell of alcohol and disinfectant, which was so very different from the stuffy, airless room he had been locked in with Clint.
Steve’s mouth pulled up in the most satisfied smirk the world had ever seen. “I’m his Captain. At the firehouse.”
“Just about forty minutes or so.” He nodded and looked over at the food. She brought one tray over for him and he took the bread roll and ate it slowly while she talked. “So this is him?” Another nod. “I guess this isn’t you trying to give me full grown grandchildren, right?”
“These past weeks you kept him safe, stayed by his side and found the people who were a threat. That’s not nothing, Dugan.” Tony said sincerely. Though he knew where this came from, Tony wanted him to know that he did everything he could. “Winter is Winter. But you’re you. And there’s a reason I asked you,” he said, looking around the room. It was a nice room not that he expected any less of James.
“But you know that there’s no one on this planet I’d rather spend my life with, right?” Clint asked and he could see the way James reacted to his serious tone, his expression troubled, questioning.
“Of course. Thank you,” Tony said and Benni went right in to unpack his things. James was leaving again already. “James?” Tony asked and the man stopped but didn’t turn to look at him. “Thank you. Really.” Sarah had hinted that James was helping with whatever was going on. Not that Tony didn’t expect that but it was always nice to have some confirmation.
At the hospital he was led straight to Steve’s room and no one followed him in. It was quite the service to be treated like that, though Tony preferred to do things his way and not be followed everywhere he went.
This went on for four days before any of them saw him again. It wasn’t that he didn’t want to see them, he just didn’t want to talk about it. About how he was feeling or what he was thinking or how much he missed James already. It wasn’t because four days had passed without his presence but because he knew these four days were only the beginning. There was a good chance he wouldn’t see James again for weeks. Months maybe.
“Alright,” James said, visibly incredibly tired. He rubbed a hand across his forehead, sliding it down to pinch the bridge of his nose and sigh as his eyes shut, willing away a headache. “You know your job. Let’s call it a night, go over it again in the morning.”
Steve stared into his eyes, trying to understand why he wanted to see him. He didn’t seem ready in Steve’s opinion but perhaps he was. He was just so worried about doing more damage and also what would Tony think when he saw him, knowing he’d been tortured and more than likely figuring out that James and Steve had been the torturers?
“At least with you, the danger I find myself in has some variety. It’s not just ‘oh the neighbors want to beat us for being deviants.’ Where’s the fun? Where’s the pizzazz?”
Tony closed his eyes, feeling Steve’s breath on his face. He still felt heavy and sad that Steve thought he wouldn’t make it but something about the way he kissed him told Tony that he had not given up yet. And that was the part Tony would keep alive.
“I just remembered how you and I were talking about being in love and what it feels like. Now look at you. You’re going on a vacation to a foreign country and you’re not anxious at all.”
Rhodey snorted. “Nope. No way. Nuh-uh. You know work is off-limits. I love you and everything but that firehouse is my break from you and your garage is yours from me.”
“She’d be even happier if she heard from the both of us,” Tony said and went to the phone on the side table. The cable was long enough to reach to Steve’s bed.
“Don’t remember inviting your kind here,” Steve teased and James scoffed, sipping the drink Sarah poured him.
much better. Still not your coffee but…” he trailed off, turning slowly to look at Tony and Falsworth. “If it’s alright, why don’t the two of you go and pick it up? And bring back anything else you deem worthy,” he instructed them, looking at Tony as he spoke.
“Well, I don’t know what to say about the James thing because I’d never hurt him and as for the other,  just because I like small brunets doesn’t mean I want
“Parker? No, he called bright and early this morning and said, and I quote, ‘please Miss Potts tell Mr Stark I can’t work today I’ve got algebra.’” When she finished the sentence, she looked up at Tony with an amused smile. “He’s adorable, Tony, really.”
As silently as possible he closed the door behind him and looked around. This had to be the back entrance, or well, exit in his case. He saw lights around the corner where the street must have been. Good, he could use the light to show him the way.
Steve turned to Tony, reading the anxiousness in his features. He pressed a gentle kiss to Tony’s cheek and then turned to the rest of the table, clearing his throat to briefly interrupt the conversation between Sarah, James, and Clint.
Clint and Tony had gained back the majority of their weight, the worst of their bruises and injuries had healed, save for Clint’s leg that still had a couple weeks before the cast could come off. But all in all they were doing a lot better. Everyone was.
“Steve, you wanna grab a bite to eat sometime?” Tony asked, interrupting Rhodey once again and if he could, Rhodey would have strangled Tony but instead he just prepared his speech for later, glaring so hard it was giving Tony a headache.
“Get them home. Now.” He heard Steve say ‘okay’ before he hung up but he couldn’t focus on that. All he could think about was the fact that Clint was gone. James had not done enough and Clint was taken. He never should have let him argue his way out of security.
Tony chuckled and leaned in to kiss Steve sweetly. “Now go back to resting. Everything’s taken care of and you’re paler than a glass of milk.” He was honestly worried about him. Not his safety but his well-being.
Sometimes it hit him. It always happened at the strangest moments too with seemingly no trigger other than Clint’s very existence. That horrible, nauseating dread that he had felt when he first realized Clint was taken. The same awful feeling that had kept him up at night during the hours when he was reminded of Bakuto’s insanity and found himself praying that Bakuto not kill them, not his Clint. Not Tony either but, dammit, not his Clint.
“Hungry?” he asked Clint who was wearing his hearing aids despite having been asleep. He refused to remove them.
When he had no tears left, a wave of exhaustion came over him. “Is it… do I have to stay here long?” he asked, with what little strength he had left. He didn’t want to sleep again. He needed to see Clint and make sure that he was okay.
“Yeah.” He put his cup away and reached his hand out for Clint to take. He still needed the contact. “I don’t want to tell him. He feels bad and I don’t want that.” He leaned his head against Clint’s shoulder but sat up, thinking Clint still needed to read his lips for them to have a conversation.
“None taken,” Tony said, tapping away on his phone, irritated that he didn’t have coffee anymore, even if Bucky had been right about the taste.
Tony smiled brightly, his nose wrinkling as he did. “You sound so surprised,” he laughed softly, one hand back to combing through Steve’s hair. “He admires you and your strength. He keeps asking Dugan and Jones to tell him stories about your time in the war.”
“Listen, love,” Steve began, holding Tony’s hand in his, “I know you know this, but I just want to go over it officially. We’re going to have to remember that as long as we are in the public eye on this ship, no touching. Treat me how you would Benni. I know it’s odd but it has to be, alright?”
“Nice to see you,” James told her, reaching down to inspect what was left in the pizza boxes. He took a slice from Natalia’s box, taking a bite, and then said, walking away with it as she pretended to protest, “I’ll change and be back down soon.”
Steve’s eyes dropped to Tony’s hand on top of his and then back to Tony’s eyes, trying to read them, figure out if it was the truth. Tony wasn’t someone who went around hurting people—oh no, that was Steve’s job, he thought bitterly— so why wouldn’t it be the truth?
He wasn’t trying to take Steve down out of jealousy or hatred—he was pissed off because he was in love with Steve but Steve did not return his feelings. He just wanted Steve to notice him, to take him as a “mate”, his words not Steve’s.
The way Sarah spoke with Tony made him smile brightly. He loved her so much he almost felt bad for his late mother. He thought about the wish he had made
Downstairs he could hear Sarah and Steve talk and it made Tony tense. When he entered Steve looked ready to head out which meant he’d leave Sarah, Tony and Benni alone at breakfast. Steve turned around and greeted them as he always did, winking at Tony quickly and leaving the kitchen with big and fast steps.
What if Steve was already trying to tell him he wanted more out of this? What if Tony wasn’t ready to handle whatever it was that Steve wanted? Tony licked his lips and swallowed to hide his sudden flurry of nerves.
He pulled out another list from the front of the first folder that had every local business and other person/entity that paid Steve and the mob along with their due amounts.
before?” He remembered very clearly hearing his mother and himself tell Tony something similar when he was recovering. He just—like with most of his own advice—didn’t apply it to himself.
. Your food is delicious. I eat a lot but in small portions.” That wasn’t entirely true but eating a little every now and then was easier for him than eating three big meals.
“The difference is that you like what you’re doing. You like the responsibility and going out there, which is why you’re missing it. For me it was a force of habit. Right now there isn’t a lot to do apart from the things Dugan, Jones and I are covering. And you know this, Steve.”
Steve sighed into the kiss, one of his hands on the back of Tony’s head and the other on his back, sliding down quickly to the waistline of his trousers. Steve’s lips left Tony’s and moved to his neck, a light nip here and there with his teeth, a nibble on his earlobe.
for me, okay? You’ll need to give her lots of hugs and help her around the house but I know you can do it.”
It was going on day—or rather night—eight before Steve was spotted longer than a few minutes or just in passing. Everyone was asleep, or so he thought. He’d come home around 3am. He didn’t even have any work to do. He just sat in his office as he did most nights. He told Dugan to go home around ten and after that he just sat with his thoughts.
Clint shook his head. There were many voices that piped up when James asked him that question, all with conflicting reasons for saying no and then one small voice at the back being drowned out as it cried ‘yes!’ but was ignored.
He came around the corner loosening his tie and Clint’s eyes swept him from top to bottom three times before he even spoke. His hair was slightly disheveled, his sleeves rolled up to his elbows, and waistcoat unbuttoned, and now his tie hung around his neck loosely. He leaned against the doorframe and smiled in at them, his hands sliding into his pockets. Clint smiled back until he
