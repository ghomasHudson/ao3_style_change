“He’s beautiful, Tony. I can already tell what an amazing job you’ve done with him. I can’t wait to get to know him. And get to know you again.”
I said. I’m never going to stop hating myself for hurting you like that. Every time I close my eyes, I can see that devastated look on your face. Tony, I’ve missed you every minute of the last fifteen years.”
They stay like that for a few minutes, Steve basking in the warm, comfortable scent of happy and content omega. This was more than he ever could have hoped for. When he requested the assignment to SI as the army liaison, he had only dared to hope that Tony would talk to him. Never could he guess that he would have Tony curled up against him like this, especially not after his initial reaction to seeing Steve after so long. And now, he thinks there’s only one thing that could make this better.
“Because,” he faltered momentarily, searching for a sane argument.  He found one, sort of, “because it’s alliterative!  I mean, who outside of Big Bird has two of the same initial?”
“That tub of glorified icing you bought?  Yes.  So you’ve gone from wanting liquid grass clippings to pure sugar in less than ten seconds?  I feel like that says something about the grass clippings.”
Which was how he had ended up here, lips slathered in Ruby Woo, watching Captain America hyperventilating on the floor of an elevator, and realizing, with a dawning horror, that he had royally, majorly, seriously fucked up.
Steve kicked the door shut.  The shoe went into a box of Christmas ornaments on top of the armoire where Tony would need a chair to retrieve it.  And, speaking of Tony, there he was, tearing open the bedroom door, wearing just one sneaker and starting to go red in the face.
“This your transcript?” Howard said, pulling over the piece of paper, “Hey, ‘A’ in computer science, not that I’d expect any less,” he smiled at Tony over the transcript, “And an ‘A’ in chemistry,” his eyes slid down the paper.  The smile faded.
“Well, I’m not sure what happened in English, but the rest is very good,” Maria laid the transcript on the starched tablecloth, smiling, “I’m proud of you, honey.  But do remember, my degree is in English, darling, so I do wish you’d try just a bit harder.”
Steve closed his eyes and concentrated hard on sheep, but his mind kept slipping inexorably backwards to that once-upon-a-time exhibition at MoMA and a taxidermied parrot wearing an artificial limb.
When Steve got back from his run around ten, Tony was still comatose, sleeping soundly in the drawn-curtain twilight.  He didn’t even twitch when Steve came into the bedroom to shower and change into fresh clothes.  Now showered, shaved, and dressed, Steve stood at the foot of the bed, toweling his hair, and considered the sleeping Tony.  He looked like a Raggedy-Ann doll dropped face-down from great height, arms and legs splayed haphazardly beneath the sheets, claiming most of the available real estate.  Tony slept on his stomach, always, even though he claimed it caused wrinkles.  This was okay with Steve, since he actually liked Tony’s laugh lines, not that he would ever,
“Tony, how many times are we gonna do this?  The answer had better not be ‘every Friday night for the next three years.’”  Tony cracked open one eye.  Rhodey loomed over him, disapproval writ over every inch of his face, and looking weary.  Tony felt a pang of guilt; eighteen-year-olds weren’t supposed to look weary.  Rhodey reached down a hand, but Tony just shook his head, and Rhodey sighed, resigned, and then settled himself heavily on the grass beside Tony.  In silence, they gazed upward at the handful of dim stars visible through the light pollution.
“I figured. As they say in the Scouts, ‘Be Prepared,’” Tony agreed.  “Did they even have scouts yet?  When you were a lad?  In approximately 1856? Too bad, ‘cause I bet you would’ve had all the badges. Hey, Steve--” and Tony kissed him.  This time, Tony tasted faintly like toothpaste instead of liquor.  Tony straddled Steve’s lap, sliding a hand into Steve’s hair.  The kiss was long and deep, and Tony was making delicious, little, happy noises in the back of his throat.  When Tony finally came up for air, he was grinning like the Cheshire cat.
to, okay?  Because every time I introduce myself, I want people to know who my family is.  My family now.  Because I want everyone to know that
There was a crash from below and the sound of breaking glass.  Bruce tensed, but Steve placed a steadying hand on his forearm.  “It’s alright.  Volstagg just smashed a glass,” Steve pointed to the group of roaring Asgardians.  “I should get a broom before someone steps on the pieces.”  But before Steve could make a move towards the stairs, a second glass, this one lobbed by Sif, exploded against the wall.
A woman took the stage, sweeping the microphone out of the stand with a grin and a wink.  She was small and trim, with loose waves of dark hair and a swipe of bright lipstick.  Steve wasn’t sure about her costume: Charlie Chaplin maybe, only without the bowler and cane.  Whatever it was, it looked incomplete, as though she had shed some of its pieces over the course of the night.  Now, she was down to a vest, baggy trousers, and a shirt with the sleeves rolled up to her elbows, exposing her fragile-looking wrists and forearms.  Actually, she was sort of small and fragile-looking all over, but she controlled the stage masterfully: strutting up and down, kicking up a flirty heel here and there, reaching down a slim hand towards the crowd.  When she began to sing, her voice was controlled, but high and breathy.
Tony tipped up his chin to meet Steve’s warm blue gaze.  He was wearing his beat leather jacket and his Brooklyn Dodgers cap and that ridiculous blonde beard, and Tony loved him so much it made his heart hurt.
But Howard wasn’t listening.  His eyes had moved from Maria to Tony, as if realizing for the first time he had yet to address his only child. He cleared his throat, “So, Tony, how’d school go?”
“Steve,” he said irritably, “I can do math.  And that does not add up to fifteen uninterrupted hours.”  He pulled the sheet up over his face.
“I did.  Just me and my little flowered apron.  Also, could you stand back, please?  I have a knife.”
Tony grinned.  It was the best start to the holiday he could have hoped for, Howard away on business and a mostly suitable transcript to present to his mother.
She took him to the front door, holding his hand as they went outside to sit together on the brownstone’s stoop.  She looked at him from beneath her long lashes, her blue eyes bright and sly, then leaned forward and kissed him lustfully, her fingernails grazing his scalp.  She pulled back with a satisfied smack.
“Nevermind.  Stupid question.  I know you did, and I bet it has fifteen layers.”  Steve frowned ever-so-slightly, as if he were considering whether or not his feelings were hurt. Tony changed tack, “And I’m sure,” he added as sincerely as he knew how, “that it will be
“Fine,” Tony assented grudgingly, and threw off the bedclothes.  In typical Morning Tony fashion, he did not comment on the fact that Steve had retrieved his pajamas from the living room floor and folded them neatly across the foot of the bed.  Normally, Steve would have prodded him for a ‘thank you,’ but the large and livid bruise blooming on the side of Tony’s neck eyed him accusingly, and he didn’t.
“I told you,” Tony’s head was thrown back against Steve’s shoulder, and he panted in his ear, “You love it.”  And it was true: he did.  In answer, Steve bit down hard on the juncture of Tony’s throat and shoulder, sucking the tender skin against his teeth hard enough to elicit a gasp.  It would bruise; he wanted it to.
“Steve--” Tony began and then stopped, unsure what he even meant to say.  If he asked Steve not to be angry, Steve would say he wasn’t angry.  If he asked for forgiveness, Steve would say there was nothing to forgive.  “Shit,” he said instead.
"That‘s why I didn't ask.“ Steve turned away from Tony and started the familiar routine of making coffee.
Tony looked at him; he was all soft confusion and strange insecurity, deep shadows underneath those blue eyes. He shrugged, but at the same time he pulled his feet under himself, making space for him.
Tony reached out and rested a hand on Steve‘s wrist. He had always been terrible at comforting people, it was all he could do.
“I need you, Cap. And you need me. We need each other. As much as I wished I could stay on my own, I can‘t. So, this is me, holding out an olive branch to you. I will not apologize for what I've said to you, cause it‘s true. But I will also accept, that you and me are very different people, very stubborn, very stupid sometimes. But we're also very capable men, we get stuff done if we stick together. I can work with that. Question is, can you?“
Tony understood immediately. They'd been through rough times, each and every one of them, and they all had lost too much. And even though the threat was gone and the world was safe, there was still that sense of urgency in all of them. Tony felt it himself: the need to grasp at everything that meant something and hold it tight, not wanting to lose what little was left.
He felt Steve‘s eyes on him every now and then, but eventually he stopped, staring out into the night, sipping his coffee.
"The kid's the worst. He had no clue what he's gotten himself into." He could hear the guilt and the pain in his own voice. He didn't care. Not anymore. He knew Steve wouldn't judge him. He also knew none of the others would have either. But he couldn't live with the pity he knew would be on their faces.
"So we meet again," Tony muttered with a sinister cackle as he turned the chair in a poor villain imitation. Steve glared wordlessly at him, hand over his racing heart.
"Hush, that‘s a secret,“ Tony smirked, refilling the kettle and clicking it on. He leaned against the counter, dark eyes on Steve.
Tony made a sympathetic noise, not knowing what to say. Birthdays weren't really a thing anymore. Just another day to mark that they made it another year.
Steve captured his lips in a slow deep kiss, drawing it out as he started moving his hips, dragging his throbbing erection against Tony‘s. It wasn't perfect, the angle was wrong, but he was too far gone to stop and get the lube. Tony didn't seem to mind. He met everyone of Steve‘s moves enthusiastically, harsh moans filling the air around them.
"Maybe,“ he grumbled, pressing harder against Steve, setting his skin on fire with every desperate touch. "Are you going to do something about this-“ he bucked his hips, pressing his erection against Steve‘s, "-or is this a one man show after all?“
Steve‘s body was solid and warm; Tony felt his racing heart slow down, his erratic breathing return to normal. Hesitantly he let his hands slide over Steve‘s hips; his back was too wide to wrap his arms around, but he tried anyway.
Tony stared down, Steve's hand still covering whatever it was. Slowly Steve pulled his hand back. Tony gasped. His heart. Right there in his shaking hand. He swallowed, cleared his mind.
"What the fuck am I supposed to do?" he yelled at some point during his nightly walks. Rhodey had gently nudged him into getting back to his workshop, had hoped that being on familiar grounds would help him.
Every once in a while he managed a few hours of sleep. More often than not though, he spent his nights in the large common areas, needing the spacious rooms around him to keep the panic at bay. Locked doors made him anxious, enclosed spaces caused terror.
Steve's mouth quirked into a joyless grin. "It took him ten minutes to get to the point, but yeah, that's what he'd like to happen."
Tony muttered something unintelligible which probably translated to the same. Steve laughed, and Tony made a questioning sound.
Tony hummed, clearly not believing him. Steve didn't care. Tony was warm and willing, and for a while he forgot words altogether.
One night Tony shot up in bed. It wasn't a nightmare that woke him; the dream was already dissolving, but he still felt a gentle warmth coursing through his body. He listened into the darkness of his room. Everything was quiet. And yet something was disturbing the silence of the compound.
At first he declined; he wasn't in the state of mind to concentrate long enough to focus on anything for an extended amount of time. Yet he caught himself starting to sketch ideas on a piece of paper someone had left in the common rooms. At first it was just doodles, mainly to keep his hands occupied. After three nights he noticed the constant shaking was receding; holding a pen, drawing schematics onto the back of a SHIELD report stopped the tremors that made him avoid everyone and kept him awake at night.
"Do you have any idea how impossible you are?" he asked gently. "You're right with one thing. Arguing with you was easier. Growing closer after all these years? Finally being allowed to see the man behind the mask, getting to know the real you? It's driving me crazy to be close to you and not being able to tell you-, show you how much I want you. I never thought you'd ever return my feelings, so I kept them in check." Steve said, thumb caressing Tony's cheek. "And then you started opening up, letting me in. And I thought-, I hoped-", he shrugged helplessly. His expression wavered, and Tony saw a million different emotions flicker over his face, insecurity and doubt the strongest of them all.
He walked around aimlessly, touched unfinished projects, ran his fingers over cool surfaces, slowly inhaled the smell of oil and metal.
"Shit, that's brisk," he muttered, wrapping his arms around himself. Nonetheless he took a few controlled breaths, letting the deep sense of calm wash over him that always came with being out in the open at night.
They were all such damaged people. Each had their own misery, suffered their own terrible losses, and yet they still kept moving, kept at least trying to function normally.
"Steve,“ Tony whined, "stop teasing and touch me.“ Tony‘s voice had the desperate tinge to it, that Steve hadn't learned to withstand yet.
Tony instinctively eyed his own mug, which was almost empty. He shrugged and held it up.Steve walked over, poured him another cup. His hand was shaking slightly.
Not that there was much. The world was settling. It was tough, painful, sometimes impossible. But that's what people did - they moved on, kept going, tried to get their life back on track.
They stood like that for a long time. Somewhere in the depths of the compound a shower started. Steve flinched a little and loosened his hold.
He slowly turned it in his hand, feeling the nanites shift inside. For a very long time his life had been defined by this. And yet he had lived the past months without them, contently so even.
Steve's mouth on his surprised him, but he easily melted into the kiss, letting Steve’s warm lips and gentle tongue soothe the painful honestly of his last words.
He looked up and met Tony's eyes. For a long moment they just stared at each other, neither of them able to say anything.
But Tony almost instantly spotted Steve‘s curled up form in one of the reading chairs by the dark fireplace. Clearing his throat to not scare the other man, Tony walked closer.
Now . . . he didn’t feel that way, not exactly.  There were still days he wanted to be someone else, when he wanted a break from himself and the myriad anxieties and neuroses, from the mania and the million thoughts that flashed past his consciousness at lightning speed.  But now, unlike when he was fifteen, he had good days, too.  He had friends and meaningful work and, most of all, he had Steve.
“If you say so,” Steve said, and set his empty bowl and spoon on a bedside table.  He sighed and began to tug off his shoes, shaking his head ruefully.  Here he was, voluntarily taking off his very comfortable loafers so he could clomp around the apartment all night in hiking boots.  At least Tony was mollified.  Steve stood up to pull on the suspenders.
“Take us there.  And then page an Asgardian and send them down pronto.”  There was a pregnant pause.  “Jarvis?” Steve asked warily.
.  With Dana Howard.  Saw it with some of the boys on leave.”  From the corner of his eye, Steve could see Tony lift his head, watching closely, searching Steve’s face for some sign of the nameless ache that mention of his own time engendered.  But Steve wasn’t sad, not now; he was content in this moment, in this time, and with Tony.  He turned his head just enough to drop a kiss in Tony’s hair, and Tony subsided back against his shoulder.
“Oh, it’s true,” Tony said, just as fervently, “it’s just less true than it used to be.  Anyway, point is, I’m not going to let you be another bellhop hauling around the Stark-family baggage.”
“Hey,” Steve whispered, acknowledging Tony’s return.  And there was a lump in Tony’s throat, one that made him bite the inside of his lip against the sudden upwelling of unhappiness.  He scrubbed at his face with his hands.
Steve sat heavily on the big sofa, peeled off his hat, ran a hand through his hat hair, and then aggressively tugged off his boots, dropping them to the floor with a thud.  Tony edged towards the sofa, trying to catch Steve’s expression in the darkness, but Steve wouldn’t look at him, instead punching at a throw pillow harder than strictly necessary to make an indent for his head.  He stretched full-length along the couch, staring fixedly at the ceiling.
“Would you wait here a second,” she asked instead, “while I talk with my roommate?  Then maybe you’d walk me back to my dorm?”  Her eyes raked him up and down with lascivious promise.  He could practically feel the condoms burning in his wallet.
“What about you?”  Tony looked impeccable in his black three-piece suit, but his only obvious nod to the occasion was a pocket square patterned with tiny bats.
“Tell Steve to--” he trailed off.  Tell Steve to, to what?  Bring an aspirin?  A glass of water?  He could see Steve’s face on the elevator, stricken with anger and fear.  A hangover seemed preferable to asking for Steve’s help.  Hell, more than that--a hangover seemed like the least penance he deserved for upsetting Steve.  In the tilting darkness, Tony shut his eyes tight and waited, alone, to fall asleep.  In the morning, he knew, he would be sick and repentant, but Steve would see how pitiful he was and, following a protracted lecture about personal risk, all would be forgiven.  It would be fine, Tony told himself, as he drifted off.  It would all be fine.
next week, and Graham would ask him this very fucking question, guaranteed.  And, of course, he’d already told his publicist he wasn’t going to do any pre-interview, thank you very much, and that he didn’t give a shit what they asked him as long as they had single-malt scotch.  The smile on the newly-minted Mrs. Smith was starting to falter in the face of his protracted silence, and his brain, usually so reliable in these situations, was
“You seem to be having some trouble,” he remarked casually, sidling over, “I brought you a drink since it looks like you might be here awhile.”
, particularly when Tony looked at Steve from under his lashes with big, soft, bedroom eyes.  Steve itched to reach out the last few inches towards Tony’s body and run his hands along the sculpted muscles and sinew, but, at this stage, touching felt verboten.  It were as though he was back in art school, trailing along behind his anatomy classmates in the Met’s classical gallery, staring up at the fabulous, forbidden marble bodies.  Plinth or no plinth, Tony was positively reeking exhibition, and Steve did not want to interrupt the show.
“Well, I--gee,” he took Tony’s hand, “I’d be honored for you to take my name, Tony.  Truly.”  This, coming from a man with a Purple Heart and a Medal of Honor.  And damn if it didn’t look like Steve’s eyes had started to water.
He could also, if he wanted, spend an additional six hours staring at the top of his desk.  It was his reward for good planning.
“Honey, I’m home,” Tony yelled, then slammed the door for emphasis.  He had already begun his opening monologue even as he toed his sneakers off in the foyer, “The flight was
.   He could see it on his driver’s license, hear Pepper saying it aloud as she introduced him to a group of investors, feel the way his hand moved as he signed it on a cheque.  He wanted to be Tony Rogers, and it felt . . . right.  It felt easy.  Because of Stark Industries, he would publically carry his surname’s tangled legacy forever, but in his private life?  In his private life, he could want something different for himself, something better, saner, happier.  He could be a goddamn Rogers.  He felt his mouth twist in a private smile.
“No, really?” Steve puffed, sounding like he’d just run a marathon.  It was ridiculously gratifying.
“Nope,” said Tony abruptly, pushing his chair away from the table with a scrape, “Hey, do you want a drink?  ‘Cause I’m having one.”  He snatched his rocks glass from the table as he strode out.
Tony tugged off Steve’s undershirt and then moved his hands to the elastic of Steve’s boxer shorts.  Steve lifted an obliging ass so Tony could pull them down around his ankles.  Free of the cotton, Steve’s cock was already standing at attention, and Tony hadn’t even touched it yet.
Tony jiggled his foot, and then jiggled it some more, consulting his number for the hundredth time.  It was still 147, same as it had been when he’d ripped it from the ticket dispenser two hours ago.  To add insult to injury, he’d left his phone in the glove-box, and now he was so bored, his eyes had started to cross.
locked down Captain America.  Because I think that ‘Anthony Edward Rogers’ sounds fly, and I want it on my driver’s license.  Because names are symbols, and I want the one that stands for goodness and fidelity and sanity and, and--I’ve made up my mind about this, and it’s either going to be Tony Rogers or Mrs. Captain America.  I’ll let you choose.”
As the elevator once again stirred to life,  Steve’s eyes remained fixed on the ceiling tiles, looking determinedly not at Tony, and they descended smoothly downward in silence.  The doors hissed open on a dark apartment.  Tony extended a hand down to Steve on the floor, but Steve pointedly ignored it, standing on his own and then striding wordlessly into the shadowy living room, leaving Tony to trail after.
Feeling somehow comforted, Steve pressed the button on his phone to darken the screen.  Surprising himself, he stroked Tony’s hair as he rose from the bed, then shuffled his way back into the living room.
“Yeah.  I’m sure that’s what’s been holding everybody back.  It definitely has nothing to do with being the famous boy-genius freak.  Jesus, Rhodey, after this humiliation, I think I’m just going to have to change my name.”
“Middleton,” Steve answered promptly, “But, Tony, why do you want to?”  Steve looked . . . suspicious was the wrong word.  He looked concerned, maybe, like Tony had recently experienced head trauma, and now Steve wasn’t sure he should make major life decisions.  It hurt Tony’s feelings. Everyone always assumed his more generous decisions were impulsive, as if, once he bothered to think them through, he would inevitably do something selfish.  Well, the joke was on Steve.  This decision was entirely selfish . . . well, 65% selfish, anyway.
“The awesome powers of Captain America never cease to amaze.  But now,” Tony leaned forward over the table with sudden, rapt purpose, “it’s time for dessert.”
More than anything, Steve just wanted to fall asleep, skip over the current tortuous period of uncertainty, and wake up with Tony back to normal, or at least as back to normal as Tony ever came.  He’d accept Tony’s apology graciously then, make an apology of his own.  But sleep was impossible, even though he felt exhausted, and he gave up.
Without comment, Happy popped the glovebox and produced half a pint of bourbon.  He held it back over his shoulder.
to stop and interject.  “Wait, wait, wait,” his glee was ill-contained, “You’re admitting that Steve Rogers likes them
“Hey, Grizzly Adams,” Tony said blithely.  Liquor fumes were positively pouring off of him; the stuff was eking from his pores, but, Tony being Tony and a champion drunk, his alien voice was marked only by the subtlest slur.  “I was pretty good, right?” It was clear from Tony’s tone that it wasn’t really a question.  “It’s amazing, isn’t it?  The way you remember the songs from when you were a kid?  I still knew all the words, and I didn’t even--hey!”
“I figured. As they say in the Scouts, ‘Be Prepared.’  Did they even have scouts yet?  When you were a lad?  In approximately 1856?” Tony shot back.  “Too bad, ‘cause I bet you would’ve had all the badges. Hey, Steve--” and Tony kissed him.  Steve’s mouth was deliciously hot, and when their tongues touched, Tony felt an electric thrill.  As he pulled away, he caught Steve’s full lower lip between his teeth and released it with a satisfyingly wet
“Big mistake.  Never speak with Clint.  Clint gives people dangerous ideas,” Tony quipped, but he could feel himself smiling, too.
“The Asgardians are . . . no longer here, Captain,” Jarvis almost sounded apologetic, “It seems they have departed for an unknown location.  I will inform you should I receive any indication as to their whereabouts.  Shall I still take you to the guest suite, Captain?”
Tony tried to stand up; he really did.  Or maybe he just tried to try?  In any event, nothing happened; his ass remained firmly planted on the drafting stool.  Pepper and Rhodey exchanged a look over his head, and then, each taking one arm, they hauled him upright.  He looked down at their fingers, locked around his elbows, as they marched him up the stairs.  Pepper and Rhodey pulling him uphill: it was his entire adult life in a nutshell.
Steve nodded politely, assuming that ‘Madonna,’ in this context, must be something other than “Virgin Mary, Mother of Christ,” and placed the name in his ever-expanding mental file of twentieth century pop-culture.
Tony had gotten himself up, shaved, put on a suit.  He’d even picked out a watch.  Today was nothing but damage control.  It was just keeping up appearances. He didn’t need Pepper or Rhodey to dress him, and he could make it to Pasadena on his own.  He might even drive himself.  Yes, sure, he had gotten dressed at 2 am, and, yes, it had taken a good thirty minutes to pick socks, but fashion was serious business, and the church would be crawling with press.  If he couldn’t show them grief, he could damn well show them style. Besides, since Tony had started dressing nine hours ahead of the funeral, he could spend as long as he wanted staring into the abyss of the sock drawer.
“Hello, dear,” Maria said brightly, “isn’t this a nice surprise?” She cut her eyes at Tony as Howard bent to kiss her cheek, “We didn’t expect you until Wednesday.  Have you had dinner?  Should I ring for Sidney or--?”  She asked as Howard settled into a chair.
“Tony,” she said, wonderingly, as she pulled it free from the paper, “Where did you find this?”  She ran a hand over the faded label:
“Pep’s real name is Virginia,” Tony broke in, finger raised, “And don’t say Happy because that’s not his real name either.  Oh shit, but it
“Steve,” Tony murmured, his eyes slipping shut.  He felt Steve’s arm tighten around him.  Soon, he was asleep.
Tony rolled his eyes, “No, Steve.  Get with the program.  Vampires don’t wear capes.  They haven’t worn capes in decades.  Vampires are now strictly sexy.  And occasionally sparkly.”
Then what?  Stupid stuff, flashes here and there: Rhodey’s bony knee alongside his as they sat on the pew.  The itch of Pepper’s wool skirt against the back of his hand.  The mirror-shine on Rhodey’s shoes.  Pepper staggering against him when her heel sank into the ground.  The smell of turned earth.  The sound of dirt as it hit the casket.
The next song started: driving drums and frothy synthesizer.  The crowd erupted in laughter and catcalls as the singer took the stage.
He wanted, more than anything, for it to be okay, for Steve to say that everything was alright and, for once, to actually believe it.  But if it had been Steve who had pulled that shit earlier?  If Tony had asked to take Steve’s name and gotten some weird, lame-ass ‘no’ in response? A. His ego would never have recovered, and B. he wouldn’t have stopped pestering Steve until he had gotten a true and coherent explanation.  With Tony in the driver’s seat, the whole episode would probably have devolved into a shouting match, whereas Steve simply had too much self-control.  Now the whole name thing was just out there, festering, waiting to . . .
Tony was right; he was hyperventilating, and, suddenly, he also felt like he might pass out or vomit or both.  Steve doubled over with his hands on his knees and squeezed his eyes shut.
“Tell me to stop,” Steve took the shoe from Tony’s largely unresisting grip and dropped it to the floor as he popped the last shirt buttons, “and I’ll stop.”  His hands moved to Tony’s hips, anchoring him in place as he trailed his mouth across Tony’s bare stomach.  He could feel the muscles tense under the contact, and glanced up just in time to see Tony bite his lower lip.
“Christ, Steve,” Tony snorted, “are you trying to make me feel like an asshole for bitching about dear old Howard? Mission accomplished.”
Steve tried to interrupt, but Tony held up a hand, “Let me finish.  I don’t wanna drag it around either.  Which is why--drumroll, please--I’m taking
“Happy,” he croaked, and he pulled his forehead away from the window.  A profound hush fell over the car; it was literally the first thing he’d said in hours.  “Happy, please tell me there is liquor in this vehicle.”
Steve hung the damp towel back up in the bathroom, threw back the curtains to let in the daylight, and then eased down to sit on the edge of the bed.  He was sure--well, pretty sure--that everything was okay now, and he smoothed a hand tenderly across Tony’s tousled hair and then down his sandpaper cheek.  Tony’s single visible eye (the other was smashed down into the pillow) opened one pained crack.
“Yeah,” Steve said calmly, “pretty sure.”  Reaching up, he wrapped his hand around Tony’s clenched fingers.  When Tony tried to pull away, Steve just turned the fist gently in his grip, placing one soft kiss on Tony’s upturned wrist, “But maybe you’re right, Tony.  Reasonable discussion sure isn’t going well.  Maybe it’s time to get physical,” he said.  Almost imperceptibly, Tony’s clenched fist loosened, and Steve allowed himself a fraction of a smile.  He let go of Tony’s hand, reaching instead for the blazer buttons right at eye-level.
As the last verse began, Steve made it to the short flight of stairs on stage right to wait for Tony’s exit.  He willed himself to be calm, to relax his balled fists.  He recognized the almost overwhelming urge to grab Tony by the shoulders and shake him (her?), but he wouldn’t give in to it.  Steve took a deep breath, exhaling noisily through his gritted teeth as the song bounced towards its conclusion.
“Oh, no.  They’d invented it, alright.  Only, back then,” Steve’s head was thrown back, and he was panting, “they called it ‘self-abuse,’ and you had to confess it to a priest.”
The ride out to Pasadena he remembered, though he wished he didn’t.  It had been an hour of exquisite hell, stuck in the back of the town car between a fidgety Pepper and a taciturn Rhodey.  He could also remember their arrival: the mass of press staked out in the churchyard like a gang of vultures, Happy leaning into the back seat with a pair of dark glasses.  Tony had stared at his reflection in the black lenses but didn’t take them.  He didn’t need sunglasses because he wasn’t going to cry.  He was pretty fucking sure you didn’t cry at the funeral of the man who stabbed you in the back--in the back metaphorically, anyway.  In reality, Obie had stabbed him in the
Tony narrowed his eyes, “You do remember that you already proposed, right?  And that I already said ‘yes?’  Steve, you don’t have early-onset dementia, do you?”
“Thanks,” she smiled back, accepting the drink, “and, look, how nice.  The hunch punch matches my dress.”
“Are you sure?”  Steve scrubbed at the back of his neck, “I mean, really sure?  What about your company?  You’re not worried about, I don’t know, name recognition or something?”
Finally pushing his plate away, Tony sunk down in his chair, folding his hands across his very full stomach.
Well, folks, sorry for the wait.  School started again; I do so hate it when real work gets in the way of my fan-girling.  You may also notice that what was originally supposed to be two chapters has now been pushed to three.  (The sex scene went on longer than its originally allotted pages.  Yeah?)  Anyway, I promise that three will ACTUALLY be it for this one, and the third is mostly written already.
Steve crushed his mouth to Tony’s, swallowing the sound.  He knew for a fact that the little old lady in the rent-controlled apartment next door was both nosy and a light sleeper, and he did not relish the thought of answering questions if he ran into her in the hallway.  But Tony--damn Tony--was kissing back ferociously, moaning into Steve’s mouth, and digging his heels into Steve’s back.  The vulnerability of Tony’s desperation, the trust implicit in his abandon . . . Steve was wholly overcome by it, better judgement and all.  Breaking away from Tony’s mouth, he pushed a hand between their bodies, finding Tony’s cock and stroking it in time with the motion of his hips.  He began to thrust with powerful strokes, sliding against Tony’s prostate with each plunge.  Tony’s wail of pleasure was now hitting decibels far outside the range of propriety, and he came with a shout, covering both their chests and stomachs in a pulse of sticky fluid.  Steve made just two more ragged thrusts before he came as well, at a volume only slightly lower than Tony’s.
Back in his pajamas, Tony slouched to the kitchen after Steve, making malcontent growling noises like a bear prematurely roused from hibernation.  He sat down heavily at the tiny kitchen table, burying his face in his crossed arms until Steve brought him coffee, followed shortly thereafter by toast, thickly spread with chocolate.  Steve sat down, too, with his own mug and a copy of the
“Tony, I remember proposing to you very well,” he pulled on an oven mitt and pulled out the roast to check the meat thermometer, “and it’s is not that kind of question.”  Evidently satisfied, he set the roast on the counter.
“Hey, Tony,” the workshop door opened again, and there was Rhodey in his dress blues.  “There’s a box of donuts in the kitchen.  You want one?”  He didn’t.  He really, really didn’t.  “You want something else?  Eggs, maybe?”
“Eight,” but even that recollection wasn’t enough to make Tony feel better.  “Shit, Rhodey, do you know how many actual friends I have here?  Like, hang-out-with-pizza-on-a-Tuesday friends?”
“And I just used it to cancel your ride,” Steve said matter-of-factly, dropping the phone into his own shirt pocket, “You can have it back,  just as soon as you tell me that you aren’t leaving because of the name thing.”
Steve took one more deep breath and held it while he turned the knob, creeping from the dark of the living room into the deeper dark of the bedroom.  He eased the door almost shut behind himself and walked gingerly towards the bed.  Tony was sleeping face down, as he usually did, despite his claim that it caused wrinkles.  The sheets were pulled all the way up over Tony’s shoulders, but the coverage did not allow Steve to fool himself for even a second that things were as they should be.  The shoulders were too narrow, the overall figure in the bed much too small.  Moving slowly, as if he were underwater, Steve sat onto the edge of the bed, right beside the sleeping figure.
“I can see that.” In fact, Tony could see that the apron in question was covered in pink cabbage roses.  “But you’re still wearing a suit. And cooking.  And I would like to know why that might be.” Steve pulled the saucepan off the stove, ladling its contents into a waiting gravy boat.
mine.  It’s great that being a fatherless newsie turned you into Captain America, but all I turned into was a piping hot mess.”
“This was one of my mom’s favorites,” Tony said quietly, his eyes fixed to the screen.  “We had this cranky old 16 mm projector, and we would watch movies when Howard was out of town, stuff she liked from when she was young.  We made popcorn on the stove, and she let me change the reels.  She would always let me stay up until the end, even on school nights.”
.  Do not pass go; do not collect two-hundred dollars. Everybody at MIT knew about Tony Stark, weirdo genius, top-of-the-class, and only fifteen fucking years old.  From personal experience, he knew that coeds would not continue to grope you once they knew you weren’t legally old enough to drive.
Steve changed tactics, “Alright, how’s this for incentive?  If you get up now, the coffee will still be hot, and I’ll make you breakfast.”  The sheet descended slowly, revealing a narrow-eyed Tony, clearly weighing his options.
“Thank you,” and she was blushing just a little under her make-up, the flush of color spreading alluringly down her throat to tinge the tops of her breasts.  “Listen,” she said, laying a manicured hand on his arm, “you don’t want to dance, do you?”
“Come on, Tony,” Steve cajoled, “I haven’t seen you for two weeks.  Don’t tell me I just bought you a brand new toothbrush for nothing.  Cost a buck seventy-five.”  Steve did not miss the fact that Tony had yet to meet his eyes, even on the laugh line.
Tony remained unconvinced, “Do you want a hamster?  Because I don’t do rodents, not even ones in little plastic balls--”
“No,” Steve said firmly, turning towards Tony in the dark.  He reached across the sofa and found Tony’s hand, twining their fingers. “I’m not saying this to make you feel guilty.  I had it tough when I was a kid, sure, but so did you.  I know you did.  What I’m saying is, even though I wished for a different life, I wouldn’t be the man I am today without my experiences.   And I wouldn’t have met you, so I’ve had to stop wishing.   I can’t wish away my past when all of my wishes for the future are about the life I want with you.”
“Hi, Tony,” she said, grinning, “Listen, would you--” It didn’t matter what she said next because Tony would agree no matter what.
.  But maybe, since the waiting is starting to give me indigestion, we could have question time first?”
“Take off your shirt and jacket,” Steve directed, shucking off his own suit in something like record time.  Tony complied, managing only the vaguest show of reluctance--a single, put-upon eye-roll.
?  That’s cute, but my girl here forgot her harem pants.”  Therese practically threw Tony’s hand back at him when she released his crushed fingers.
Steve finally snapped, grabbing Tony’s narrow shoulders, just as he promised himself he wouldn’t do,  “Tony, listen to me.  There is nothing,
“Well,” a big square hand landed on his shoulder, “Tony told me he was either going to be Tony Rogers or Mrs. Captain America.  I told him I liked ‘Mrs. Captain America,’ but now Tony won’t put his money where his mouth is.  Here, Tony.”  A large Styrofoam coffee cup appeared in front of Tony’s face.  “Sorry it took so long.  The coffee machine in the lobby ate my dollar, and I had to go to that place down the street.  If I’ve learned anything being married to Tony, it’s that you do
“I wanted us to have a nice dinner, and--oops,” he paused, wiping up some sauce he had glopped on the counter, “and there was something I wanted to ask you.”
Steve, as calmly as he knew how, snatched up Tony’s other sneaker off the parquet.  It was one of the worst shoes he had ever seen, and Steve knew bad shoes.  He had spent much of World War II wearing scarlet booties like, as Tony once put it, “some sort of gay pirate.”
Steve grabbed Tony’s elbow--an elbow that felt very small and fragile in his hand--and dragged him towards the elevator. Steve shoved him in, stabbing blindly at the button for some lower level.  They descended a floor or two before Steve slammed the red emergency stop with his fist.  “What have you
“Steve?” Tony, or at least what passed for Tony these days, placed a small, tentative hand onto his shoulder, “I-- you okay?”
Tony watched him, mind blessedly blank. As Steve set two mugs on the counter, Tony sat down. Steve sat next to him, pushing the full mug in his direction.
"Yes, for you,“ Steve murmured, "not that it makes any difference." His head thudded against the stone, resignation showing in his every feature.
Steve ignored him as he pulled a mug from the shelf; Tony pushed the tea bags still sitting on the counter towards him. The kettle clicked off and Tony stepped closer, filling Steve‘s mug. A warmth filled Steve as he watched Tony reach for the sugar.
Trying no to think, he kept wandering between the stones, brushing his hand over some of them. His heart was heavy; he felt the ghosts of those engraved all around him. But the longer he walked, the lighter his step became, a quiet peace settling over him.
Tony absently watched him go through the process of adding coffee into the machine, filling it with water and pushing the button. He then reached for the cupboard, picking a mug from the vast variety they had added through the years.
Instead of pushing for it, he only nodded his thanks and settled in front of the fire. He had the feeling that Steve somehow knew how cold he often was. Much more than before.
When the sun came up behind the hills, he sat on the ground, leaning against the stone in his back, allowing himself to grief. It didn't hurt as much as it used to.
"Don't," Tony spat out, instinctively moving away from him. He knew if he'd touched him, he'd shatter. He wasn't ready for that. Maybe never would be. Right now he was still in shock, his brain was still trying to process everything. Their failure, their defeat. But mostly his own losses. Pepper. Peter. Those hurt the most - losing the very few people he came to call family over the past 10 years. He still had Rhodey and Happy, and he knew he should be grateful for that.
"Shut it, Rogers, just stop talking!“ Tony‘s anger welled up; it broke free as Steve reached out to hold him back. He turned around, crowding into Steve‘s space, pushing him away. He didn't really expect a reaction. But Steve stumbled, surprised at Tony's action, his back hitting one of the stones. Tony glared at him, hands pressing into Steve's chest.
Tony leaned back, letting his gaze run over Steve, whose eyes were screwed shut. There were dark shadows under his eyes, and his mouth was pressed tightly together. He looked older than he was.
The silence settling around them was thick, but for the very first time, Tony thought of it as somewhat comfortable.
He knew he was unfair. None of those left behind had chosen to be here, it had been a cruel game of chance. Still, seeing Steve's face while he was still mourning didn't help to grow more friendly towards him.
A sound escaped Steve, low and pained. And suddenly Tony realized that he was just as touch-starved as he was. He pushed himself up, holding Steve tighter. He allowed himself to stop thinking. Steve‘s shoulders slumped and he curled himself around Tony, fingers digging almost painfully in his back.
He didn't read any of the names, knowing full well he'd only go and find any relatives to help them out financially if they let him.
As soon as the weather -and his condition- allowed it, he started to take walks in the vast grounds of the compound. At first Rhodey insisted on coming along. Tony let him, hoped his company would help.
Steve reached out a hand, probably not even thinking about it. Must've been second nature to him by this point.
The fire was dying down, and the cold settled further around them. Tony got up, stretching out the kinks in his back.
"Same difference,“ Tony said, watching with an odd fascination how Steve efficiently build a fire and lit it.
"Wanna go back to bed, Captain?“ Tony muttered between kisses. Steve felt his erection pressing against his own. "I have a few ideas how to keep nightmares at bay.“
"That's my man," Tony whispered, licking against the closed seam of Steve's mouth. "A bit more participation wouldn't go amiss," he teased, ignoring the wavering of his voice.
"Sometimes it's as if I can feel when someone has nightmares," Steve whispered. "Even if I myself don't have any, I wake up, sensing... something, I think." He shuffled, clearly uncomfortable. "Mostly I'm right." He tilted his head, gaze flitting over Tony before returning to the fire.
Friday was tracking everyone's routines so that he didn't run into anyone. He couldn't be around people for long these days. He knew that being on his own wasn't good for him, but he wasn't able to endure anyone of the team for longer than a few minutes. Rhodey and Happy kept checking in on him, wanting to keep him updated on everything.
Steve felt Tony‘s breath hitch as he gently applied pressure with the hand on his back, leaving barely any space between their bodies.
"It wasn't your fault,“ he admitted once his voice was steady enough. As soon as he said it, his shoulders slumped and he exhaled heavily.
"Breathe, you idiot," Tony murmured against his lips, losing himself in the feeling of soft, warm skin.
He spent more time with the people around him. He still needed space, but he started to enjoy the weekly Sunday night dinners Natasha had started, if only so he and Steve could tease her mercilessly. She let them, with a twinkle in her too-sad eyes.
"I miss 'em." Tony blurted out, making Steve jump in his seat. But his face softened a little, and Tony continued. A warm relief filled him as he talked.
He leaned back, exhaling. Telling Steve all this, basically vomiting his emotions into the man‘s lap, had left him exhausted. The silence stretched, Steve‘s face was still as stone.
He rolled off Tony to not crush him, his body shaking helplessly in the aftermath. Tony recovered faster and he curled around Steve, resting his cheek against Steve‘s chest. He felt gentle fingers run over his thigh, his stomach, before stopping over his heart.
Tony wrapped his arms around him, and Steve slumped against him, breathing in deeply. Tony always smelled different. Tonight it was his ridiculous expensive shower gel and the faint iron smell of metal. But underneath it all was the warm scent of skin and salt which always calmed Steve. He nuzzled against the side of Tony‘s neck, making him huff a laugh. Steve pulled back enough to look at him. His hair was a mess, and there was a smear of something dark next to his ear. He looked tired, and yet his eyes were shining with something deep and warm as he easily caught Steve's eyes.
"Want me to stop?“ Steve asked, voice cracking. He didn't loosen his embrace. He was trembling. Only slightly, but Tony felt it.
"But do you know what‘s even better?“ Tony asked, leaning closer to speak right into Steve‘s ear. "The shivers you get when I call you
He had seen the glances Rhodey had cast his way, worried and pained. But as long as Tony took his meds, ate what was put in front of him and went to bed at a reasonable time, he left him alone. He knew he had issues, but he didn't need anyone to tell him that.
And when everyone was there for a change, chatting, laughing, Tony pretended that all was right with the world.
Steve stood there for another moment, his uncertainty as clear as day. Eventually he straightened his back and headed towards the coffee maker.
Steve seemed to sense it. Holding up his hands in surrender he sat back, purposely looking out the window.
Tony whimpered, his fingers scrambling for a hold. His eyes were squeezed shut, and there were small creases across his forehead. Then those beautiful brown eyes flew open and instantly locked with Steve‘s.
He shook his head. "Not now, Rogers,“ he muttered, torn between reaching for the liquor cabinet and leaving again. He wanted a drink very badly, but he also knew he wouldn't be able to do so under Steve‘s scrutinizing gaze.
Steve ducked his head, but didn't stop Tony as his fingers danced over his skin, leaving goosebumps in their wake. He held his breath as Tony scraped his nails gently over his stomach, making his erection jump.
Steve looked at him questioningly, blue eyes for a moment unguarded. Something in the air around them shifted, a thickening of a thought, an idea maybe, before it vanished again.
Steve was different. He'd been where Tony was. There had never been pity for anyone on him. If anything, he understood. The darkness around them helped. He didn't have to look at him, and he was pretty sure, Steve wasn't watching him at all.
Tony sank against him, grateful for the darkness around them. It had been too long since he‘d touched anyone, let alone hug. Rhodey had tried, when he first came back. He hadn’t been able to handle his hand on his shoulder back then, let alone a full body contact. He had made that very clear to Rhodey.  He hadn't offered again. And Tony never asked.
* wouldn't want to be around me. You never complained, you never gave up on me. You always had my back. Of course I want you. How can I not? You've kept me sane. You've kept me alive. I wouldn't know where I'd be without you, Steve." He squeezed his eyes shut, inhaling deeply.
"Nothing," Steve said, caressing Tony's face, "you're just so-" He didn't dare say 'sweet' even though he was. He settled for: "So not Tony-like when you just woke."
Steve chuckled again, more genuine this time, and something in Tony'S heart loosened at the sound of it.
His entire body language was hesitant, something Tony hadn't seen in him in all those years. He'd always been secure, always known what to do and how to behave. Captain America - the culmination of honor and American values.
"Steve, you are driving me crazy. Not in the way you'd hoped, probably." Steve shrank back, but Tony tutted him, pulling him close again. "Not back then. You made my blood boil like nobody else. Your righteousness made my stomach turn, and more often than not I wanted to punch you in your perfect teeth. But that was before I came back. And you were still there, with all your golden boy attitude and your stupid goodness. Then you went off to chase the purple madman across the universe. Despite the quite astonishingly high chance of getting killed, you went out there, idiotically fearless, trying to save us, and you came back alive. And the longer I thought about it -which I certainly didn't-," he grinned as Steve snorted, "the more I realized something. I kept telling myself that I couldn't possibly want someone who drives me up the wall basically every day. But then you made me coffee in the middle of the night, and breakfast in the morning, and you kept me company during a time when even *
"For everything,“ Steve said. "For not being able to prevent this. Even more so for not being able to reverse it. But most of all, I'm sorry for not saving them.“ Steve‘s blue eyes were sad.
"I used to hate you," he growled through gritted teeth. "For exactly that reason: righteous till the very end, always obeying orders, yet never taking no for an answer. Do you have any idea how annoying that is for me?“
"Face still intact,“ he muttered, more to himself than to Steve. He heard him anyways and his hands went to his face.
Steve didn't reply. He pulled Tony closer, one hand cradling the side of his face. The grin faded, and he straightened his back so they were eye to eye.
Time went by. The world kept turning. Routine established, inside the compound and outside. Tony kept building: robots mostly, self-sustaining energy-cells, water filtration systems, anything that was needed to rebuild the world.
Without a word Steve hitched Tony up, who instantly wrapped his legs around Steve‘s waist. Still kissing, he stumbled back to their room where they fell on the bed.
Steve sat down opposite, still eyeing Tony carefully. As Tony stared back, he nodded briefly and looked away. Tony took a deep breath. They were still adjusting to their fragile friendship, but Tony had made it abundantly clear that he wouldn't allow Steve to patronize him, no matter how well he meant.
"Yes, sir,“ he said mockingly. Tony made a strangled sound and Steve felt his erection harden some more. Steve groaned, the feeling of Tony‘s body against his own no longer to be ignored.
"Oh Tony." His smile was incredibly soft, the expression in his eyes so painfully honest and hopeful, Tony almost averted his eyes. Almost.
"Why look at that,“ he muttered as he kissed down Tony‘s neck, leaving soft bites along his shoulder, "another kink I can use for my advantage."
"You know," he said conversationally, ignoring the pitch in his voice, "I wished I could keep hating you." He took a step towards Steve, dizzy with his scent. "Would make lots of things much easier."
Steve woke slowly, which was rare. The room was still dark, but he could see a sliver of light outside the windows. He shifted, enjoying the warmth of the bed. The soft snuffling next to him made him smile. Carefully he rolled on his side. Tony was still asleep, which didn't happen very often. Steve settled, just watching him.
"I'm pretty sure we can just skip all the formalities. We've been dancing around each other for too long. Plus-," a deep sadness settled on his face, and Tony instantly reached out for his hand. "I don't wanna waste any more time," Steve said quietly.
He slept better, sometimes up to five hours a night, which was a huge step up. He ate regularly, either forced by Friday who cut the power if he didn't stop on his own, or by one of the team. He got used to being around people again; and every once in a while he managed to have dinner with Rhodey and Happy.
"Thanks," he murmured, distracted by the warmth the garment was giving off. He took a deep breath, faintly noticing Steve's cologne in it.
Tony sighed, shaking his head. "Stop it right there, Cap. I told you and everyone who wants to hear it. I am done. I do what I can from my workshop. That's all they get."
Steve gently took the pot, and filled up his mug. But instead of putting it back, he turned towards Tony, holding up the pot in a mute question.
One day they came to Tony, reluctantly asking for help: a simple robot that could help lifting heavy debris to start clearing out collapsed building sites around the state.
“Good morning indeed,” he murmured, before he grabbed Steve’s hand, tangling their fingers tightly together as they wandered into the kitchen.
Faintly Steve noticed that he was whispering Tony‘s name over and over, making the man beneath him tremble harder every time. He was shaking as well, trying to keep his rhythm. Tony‘s hands slipped free and instantly went to Steve‘s ass, pressing him closer as they rutted against each other faster and faster.
Tony froze, his gaze locking with Steve‘s. "Wriggling stopped,“ he said, eyes sparkling with mischief.
He usually didn't remember the nightmares that woke him, but this one was still lingering. Knowing he wouldn't be able to go back to sleep, he pulled on some sweatpants and left his room.
One week later Tony stumbled into the common room, desperately trying to shake another nightmare. He was still breathing hard, cold sweat soaking his shirt.
"You‘re good, you‘d feel it when your eyebrows get singed off,“ Tony grinned, shuffling a bit closer to the fire.
"My subroutine is just fine, thank you for asking," Friday said cooly, making them burst into laughter once again.
The wood had been laying around for a very long time and was dry as hay. It started with a sharp ‚woof‘ and they both jumped away, landing on their backs.
He swayed, steadying himself against Steve‘s chest. Which was a mistake. He could smell him: a hint of cologne but mostly warm, salty skin.
Snapshots of the past weeks flashed behind his eyes. All those nights, keeping him company when he couldn't sleep. Steve's understanding behavior, his support of Tony's work, his general change in attitude. At first he had thought, it was just that they were all too worn out, too exhausted to argue. But even though they still didn’t agree on everything, they had managed to discuss things like adults, without shouting or insulting each other.
"No," he said roughly, taking Steve's hand. "You keep it." He closed Steve's fingers around it. He wanted to say 'I don't need it anymore', but somehow the words were stuck in his throat. "Keep it safe," he croaked instead.
"Pepper was strong. She knew what she‘s gotten herself into. After all those years-,“ he stopped, the pain in his chest somehow less now that he was talking about it. "She went knowingly. The kid didn't. He was too young.“
reels out of the box and then continued to root through the tissue.  “Alright, Mom, bag’s empty.  Don’t get greedy.  Santa’s bringing you the other two.  You gotta have something to unwrap on Christmas morning.”
“Gosh, Tony, that’s really sweet.  I hope Mr. Smith is as sweet to you as Mr. Rogers here is to me,” said Steve, giving the girl a wink.  Mrs. Smith was looking distinctly star-struck.  Tony didn’t blame her; Captain America winking at you did tend to have that effect.  “Hey, Tony,” Steve said suddenly, pointing to the big red-lettered screen on the other side of the waiting room, “aren’t you 147?”
“Well, I mean, I would, but Asia is, what? A 13 hour difference? And my circadian rhythm is kind of whack.  I’m gonna need, like, fifteen uninterrupted hours of sleep to function tomorrow.”
“Yes, yes, and no.  Yes, I am totally, 100% sure.  Yes, I am really, totally, 100% sure.  And, Steve, name recognition?  Seriously?  Captain America and Iron Man are getting married.  It’s going to be bigger than the royal wedding.  We’re going to be front-page news in every paper.  Everyone will still know who I am afterwards.  I mean, you still know Kate’s maiden name, right?”  Steve had an unhealthy love for the royal wedding.  Tony was pretty sure the PBS broadcast was still floating around the DVR.
She was young, twenty-five at the outside, and she folded like a house of cards in the face of his mild rebuke.  Her face turned instantaneously pink, “Oh, God.  I know it was. I’m so sorry.  I’ll delete it,” she pulled the phone from her bag, unlocking the screen, “it was just so, so . . . you know?  You, with the magazine, and you, again, on the cover of the magazine--I couldn’t help it,” she held up the phone for his inspection.  It was a good picture, funny.
It was almost midnight, on a Friday no less, and Tony wasn’t totally shit-faced.  Honestly, he felt sort of proud of himself.  He wasn’t sober or anything, but this time last week he’d been heaving into some random flower bush while Rhodey patted his back and told him to “let it all out, man.”  He’d decided then and there that grain alcohol was not his friend.
Tony obligingly swept aside for Steve and his roast.  “So,” Tony said, trading his scotch glass for a plate to serve himself from the sideboard, “you gonna tell me what you want to talk about now?”
“Oh, hey.  I know you,” she said, with a note of recognition, “you’re in my machine vision class.”  And then she put the face with the name, and her smile abruptly fell away, “Tony Nelson, huh?” Her handshake tightened painfully and deliberately around his fingers.  “Isn’t that Larry Hagman’s character from
Steve shook his head, “Yeah, I don't believe you.”  Tony, still standing on the dining room chair, looked mutinous. “Tony,” Steve asked, “do you think I’m angry with you?”
“No,” Steve said finally, letting the phone fall back into his pocket, “sorry.  You need to stay until we work this out.”
“Geez, Steve,” Tony spit in his palm and then ran his slick hand over the head, “If I didn’t know any better, I’d say you were happy to see me.”
“Hey, what can I say?  ‘C’s get degrees,” Tony remarked preemptively, shrugging his shoulders,” I mean, good enough, right?”
So, tonight, he had stuck with beer, in more or less reasonable quantities, and the gods were now smiling on him for his virtue.  Lo, they had sent him a vision.  She was poured into an electric blue mini dress at least one size too small and wobbling gently on her patent stilettos.  Her hair, an outsized mane of red curls, was snagged on the rack of a taxidermied deer.
“Well, hello, Stark Family,” Howard said expansively as he came into the dining room.  He seemed to be in a good mood, but that only meant he’d been drinking. Tony felt his face settle into a neutral mask.
“Could ‘sometime’ be now?” Steve asked hopefully, then amended, “Not that it has to be, of course.  I know you’re jet-lagged.”
“Steve,” Tony said carefully, the first faint note of doubt creeping into his high, unfamiliar voice, “Steve, you’re hyperventilating.”
“You mean you would,” Steve replied mildly, hands still caressing, “if you didn’t think I was angry with you.  Because of the name thing.  Which, by the way, I’m still not.”
“Tony,” Steve said, pulling back to unzip Tony’s fly, “for the last time: I’m not angry with you. Say it.”
“I know,” Steve put a hand to his brow, trying hard not to lose it, “that you didn’t just suggest we--because that would be . . . I can’t even--”
The shiver was accompanied by a second sensation, something entirely new, subtle and alien, a blossom of heat spreading inexorably in all directions from some place between Tony’s thighs.  He could feel it now in his chest as a tremulous excitement, in his limbs as a delicious tingle.  He felt pleasantly light-headed, and there was a low-level buzz of white noise in his ears.  And, most of all, there was his growing awareness of a dull but pleasurable ache somewhere deep inside him, an unaccountable need to be filled. It was weird.  It was hot.  And holy shit, his panties were wet--well, his boxer-briefs, anyway.
“Yeah, why not?  I mean, there’s a picture of me Frenching Steve right here on page 27.  They cropped it out, but I’m pretty sure my hand is on his ass, too.”  He held up the magazine, tapping the photo with his finger.
“Oh, yeah,” Tony smiled, watching his mother as she rooted through the tissue.  He knew when she touched the first film canister because her whole face lit up.
“Fuck,” Tony hissed, and Steve wasn’t sure if it were due to the hickey or the inexorable up-and-down movement of his fist.
Tony was weeping, very quietly, into Rhodey’s shoulder.  He was 38 years old, no spouse, no children, and now no parents.  He didn’t even have a dog.  What he had instead were an undiagnosed case of PTSD, a foundering company, and the crippling weight of a family name that he now bore alone.
“No,” Bruce agreed, “I guess not.  Think they’d do that to me if I gave them a paper plate?--Oh. Uh oh.”
Steve wordlessly pulled the covers back for both of them and switched out the lamp. Tony, in the darkness, and almost despite himself, pressed against Steve’s broad chest, nestling his cheek against the great, beating heart, clinging to the reassuring physical comfort.  Steve wrapped around him tenderly, resting his chin on top of his head and his arm around his waist.
“Hiya.  It was so loud in there; I hope you don’t mind.  We haven’t been formally introduced,” she said, an ironic little quirk to her mouth as she stuck out her hand.  “I’m Kimberly Baxter.  Everyone calls me Kimmy.”  Tony felt himself smiling back and took her slim fingers, giving them a firm shake.
“Tony, if you will leave this kitchen for the next five minutes, I promise I will not ask you for anything alive for the next five
that I am so curious about that I would willingly drink magic potion at a Halloween party.  I can’t believe you--”
Pepper nodded, her mouth pressed into a tight line, and scurried out, probably to deal with some other disaster.  Steve suspected that Pepper did not actually enjoy their parties.  He didn’t blame her.  Even though Tony was the team’s official party planner, he was, by his own admission, more of an “ideas man” than an executor.  Meaning, of course, that Tony spit-balled suggestions and Pepper did all the actual work.
girl.  Always crossed her ankles when she sat down.  Didn’t cross ‘em any other time, but, hey.  You know,” Tony laughed, “your attraction to me suddenly makes a
Kimmy was looking back and forth between them; she wasn’t smiling anymore, either.  Was there such a thing as a reverse boner?  If so, Tony had one.  Therese now had Kimmy by the arm, and she was hissing in her ear.  Kimmy’s blue eyes widened in shock, then narrowed in fury, her face now just about as red as her hair.
Tony jerked back to the present with a shock.  Steve’s hot mouth on his neck, the hand sliding across his chest, had come to a halt.  His erection had wilted to the point of non-existence. When had that happened exactly?  And now Steve was leaning over him with the saddest, most endearing expression on his face, one hand softly combing through Tony’s hair.
“I guess they don’t have plastic cups in Asgard,” Steve commented, watching as they hoisted Tony up onto their shoulders.
when Steve’s lips wrapped around his cock.  Through the denim, Steve mouthed at the outline of Tony’s growing erection. When Steve glanced up from beneath his lashes, Tony was looking back with an expression of wonder, mouth open but wordless, one hand pressed to the wall and the other in a fist on top of the armoire.
--“Thank you, Happy,” Pepper had said gently, taking the glasses and fitting them to Tony’s face as if he were a child.
“Could ‘sometime’ be now?” Steve looked almost pitifully hopeful, and Tony felt Steve’s dick twitch optimistically against his groin.  Steve added, embarrassed, “Not that it has to be, of course.  I know you’re jet-lagged.”
