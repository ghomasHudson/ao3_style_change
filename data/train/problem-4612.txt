“Hey..hey it’s okay Cassie,” turning his head Castiel sees Gabriel sitting in his recliner watching the TV.
Letting out a happy squeal, Sam took the dog from his brother. Feeling the soft fur Sam smiled to his brother. This was specially from Dean! It was the best gift in the world.
Walking back into the living room, Gabriel smiled when he saw Dean cuddled up with Michael while drinking his bottle.
Seeing his baby’s eyes locked on the screen he noticed Dean’s milk starting to dribble down the side of his mouth. Picking up the cloth, he wiped away the stream.
“It's not time to make a change, Just relax, take it easy, You're still young, that's not your fault,
Sam could not believe what was happening to him. Not only was he out of what he considered hell, but he had been adopted and he was going to see Dean again after such a long time. He was super excited to see his big brother, but a small part of him was questioning and making him worry. What if Dean didn’t want to see him and hated him? Dean would probably be mad at him for not stopping their Dad from beating and kicking Dean out of their home. At the time Sam was still a kid and his Dad scared him badly. He just hoped Dean wouldn’t blame him for everything.
Letting Meg change his wet diaper, Dean drops into his head trying to ignore the horrible feeling of a stranger touching him. He tried thinking of his Daddy and Uncle Gabe. He just wished he could see them, even if it was just for a moment, he really missed them.
“Michael?” Castiel looked over to his eldest brother with a frown, holding Dean close. Castiel didn’t really know why Michael was here, but he was starting to think he had something to do with this. “Why! Why did you do this?”
“Good, I think I know something that you’ll enjoy more,” Dean looked at him, a little confused. “We need to get Uncle Gabe back for his mean joke, don’t we?” Castiel smirked. “No one messes with my baby boy and gets away with it.”
Doing up the last button Castiel smiled down at his tired boy. “Lets get comfy and cuddle on the rocker baby.” Picking Dean up, Castiel handed Dean his  bee before moving over to sit in the rocking sofa by the window., Looking out, Castiel and Dean could see the stars shining brightly above them. Pushing his foot on the floor Castiel started to rock his baby slowly. Enjoying the peace Castiel gazed at Dean, he could feel his heart skip, he loved his baby so much he just hoped Dean could see that. Dean looked so small in his arms he didn’t want to move from this moment and just stay like this forever.
Holding the spoon up Castiel tried again, only for Dean to turn away. “Please Dean, can you try for Daddy?”
“Can you give Uncle Mickey a cuddle for me buddy, just while Daddy gets ready? I think he likes your cuddles just as much as I do.”
“He’ll be okay Cassie, Dean’s back with you now. No one will ever take him away from you.” Kissing Castiel’s crown Gabriel notice Michael looking glum towards them feeling guilty and a little left out. Letting out a playful sigh Gabriel needed to cheer up his brothers.
Walking into the Little’s clothes store, Gabriel and Sam wondered around together while Michael was busy looking at different types of shoes.
Once Gabriel had got all he needed for the company’s storage rooms, both he and Castiel drove down to the church in Gabriel’s landrover.
“All I’m saying Casey is that you should get a car. It would be a lot easier with having a new baby.”
“So, what have you and Uncle Michael been up to this morning?” Gabriel asked, turning his attention to Michael.
Castiel stood, looking at the front door in shock. He couldn’t believe his brother baled on him. “Your uncle is a bit of a scaredy-cat when babies cry, isn’t he Deany,” he chuckled, looking to his boy. Dean still cried as Castiel talked to him. He wasn’t really listening. Unsure of what to do, Castiel walked back to the sofa. Sitting down, he cradled his upset boy. Silently, Castiel watched his baby. Even though Dean looked blotchy and upset Castiel still thought he was the most beautiful thing he had ever seen. Holding Dean closer, Castiel starts to hum a tune as he brings his hand up to stroke his thumb along the boy’s forehead.
“Hello gentlemen, my name is Meg. We meet earlier,” the girl smiled, smugly looking Michael up and down.
“Shh It’s okay Deany, Daddy’s just cleaning you up baby,” Castiel said while wiping Dean’s soft, smooth skin. Once Castiel finished he pulled the messy diaper way and placed it next to him as he moved a clean one under his baby’s bum.
“Anyway... on a different subject, how’s Dean?” Gabriel asked giving his older brother a worrying glance before looking towards Castiel.
Sam started to feel anxious, Dean was just staring at him not saying anything, maybe Dean wasn’t happy to see him.
“..No..No.” Dean screamed in the man’s face looking angry. Castiel looked at his boy in shock. He hadn’t see his boy look so angry before, not even after waking up from being kidnapped.
Gabriel let of a sigh “It didn’t. Most all chose prison, so the head of the A.B office asked our company to come up with a better idea,” Gabriel stopped to pass Castiel the file. “And our beloved big brother Michael had decided to take the homeless.”
“He’s more than that, but he means nothing now, we’re going to give Sam and Dean a better life then that bastard ever did.”
“Okay, okay we’ll go now. Honestly Gabe, are we shopping for Dean or you? Let’s go pay,” Castiel said, walking up to counter.
The only people he cared about were his brothers, which was why he was confused. If Lilith came back with that either Castiel or Gabriel have adopted a Little then they went behind his back to do it.
Gabriel clean him up quickly. He really didn’t want the new baby to have another tantrum. Placing a clean, thicker diaper under the boy’s bum, Gabriel rubbed diaper cream around Deans small hole and between his legs. Dean’s skin looked a little red and sore. When his brother had told him about Dean he didn’t want to believe that the young boy sold himself for money.
“Yeah Daddy,” said Sam, smiling at his Daddy. He just hoped Dean was going to be happy to see him as much as he was. His Daddy kept telling him that Dean didn’t hate him, but a small part of him just couldn’t shake the feeling.
“Stop being a brat or you’re going to be in big trouble mister,” Meg said, sternly grabbing at Dean’s legs. But Dean wasn’t listening, as he kicked and screamed he felt his tears run down his cheeks. He just wanted to go home.
“You two have been busy, but I had hoped to take my little man out to the mall and get some things,” Gabriel said. He didn’t want to just buy everything online like most people did, he wanted to take Sam out to pick his toys and clothes, like he did with Castiel and Dean.
“What!” Castiel expressed looking dumbfounded. “Gabriel, I can not buy two cars, what will I do with two cars?”
With all the noise he was making Dean soon heard footsteps. As they got louder he saw a shadowy figure standing above his head.
“We have been told that the documents you have are forged and we have being given orders to take the Little.”
Michael looked at Gabriel in shock. “Gabriel, come into my office please,” he said holding his hands up in surrender, “Please...”
“Give him time Michael, Cassy didn’t mean what he said,” Gabriel said, putting his arm around his older brother. He was shocked their little brother would reacted the way he did, it wasn’t like Castiel, but he did kind of understand. When they walked in with Dean, the look on Castiel’s face just broke his heart.
Dean watched his Daddy move away from him and Gabriel to make a bottle. Why had he given him to Gabriel? The man didn’t like him any more after what happened to Daddy. Feeling tears in his eyes again Dean tried to hold it in so he didn’t upset Gabriel again.
Finishing up the last parts of making Dean legally Castiel’s little, Gabriel heard a knock on his door. “I’m a bit busy right now, can you come back later?” he said, not taking his eyes off the screen.
Dean wasn’t sure how he felt about being kissed by his kidnapper, he should be screaming and fighting back, but when Castiel talked to him he felt kinda relaxed and calm. Maybe Gabriel gave him something else to make him that way.
Feeling the metal crib start to move, Dean closed his eyes, he had never been so afraid in his whole life. As Meg moved him down the glum hallway, Dean silently preyed that someone would save him.
Sitting up, Castiel picked up the cloths from the floor. Unfolding the onesie, Castiel sat Dean up to pop his head and arms through the neck and arm holes before laying him down on his back.
“Yeah, I got a few for you to pick from,” getting up, Gabriel went to pick up the bags from the hall. Coming back he put the bags down in front of his feet. “Okay, here’s the first,” opening a bag he pulled out a pink flowery dress.
The man looked at Gabriel raising an eyebrow, “I’ll have a look on the database, what is the Little’s name?”
“No...no nothing like that Gabe, it’s a strange feeling I have. I feel like I want to look after him...like Dean is mine.”
“Now stop, there is no need for that,” Meg said as she pushes down the rail of the crib, “I’m just going to check your diaper little man.”
“Yeah Daddy.” Smiling towards his Daddy, Sam leaned up towards Michael, “Come Unc Mickey.” Grabbing at Michael’s hands Sam tugged until his Uncle stood up.
“Don’t thank me Cas. I was wrong and I know I said that I’d have spanked him, but even as mad as I was I don’t think I would have. We’ve made him a baby so he should be treated as such. I’m just glad he is okay with me.”
Sam smiled as he woke. He had had an amazing dream. He had been adopted and he was going to see Dean again. He had dreams like that before but they never felt as real as this one did. Snuggling into his covers, he realised he was very comfortable and warm. The covers at the hospital were thin and itchy, he never felt so cosy when he woke in the morning.
“You can trust me Casey. I didn’t think when those women came up to us. I got distracted…. and I am sorry. I would never do anything to put Dean in danger, you know that. Please, I am sorry.” Gabriel looked like he might have started to cry, but Castiel knew his brother wasn’t about to. But he did look sorry.
Castiel was watching Dean, his boy had his eyes fixed on the last car. Walking up closer he hears Dean breathing hitch. “Do you like this one baby?” he asked. Dean didn’t give him an answer, his boy had become very quiet. Cupping his baby’s cheek, Castiel turned Dean to face him.
“Hmm? What’s wrong my Deany?” Taking the bottle away Castiel helped his boy up and started to rub his baby’s back. Maybe he needed burping early.
Still crying, Dean let go of his Daddy’s shirt. He knew Daddy wasn’t going far but he couldn’t stop feeling anxious and scared that he was going to disappear.
“Its for you De!” Sam yelled, pulling the box from Michael’s hand Sam stumbled dropping the box at his Daddy’s feet.
I've always loved the song I used, my granddad use to sing the original 60's version, but i have to say Disturbed version is beautiful :-)
Laying Sam down on the bed, Gabriel made quick work getting his boy dressed. Putting on the last trainer, Gabriel stood admiring how cute Sam looked. “My handsome little man, you could break girl’s hearts being so cute.”
“Please Unc Mick,” Sam nodded his head, giving Michael puppy eyes. He liked his new Uncle, he had been really nice to him since he woke up. The man had changed him, feed him and showed him his cool laptop.
Getting up from his chair he grabbed his jacket before picking up the files, including Dean’s, on his desk. Heading to his door Michael followed behind. “I’ll see you later Mickey.”
Michael looks on as his brother comforted the young boy in his arms. Though Dean looked red and a mess as he cried, Michael could see that the boy was very beautiful, he could see why Castiel had chosen him as his baby. He felt so bad for what had happened, he just hoped his family would forgive him and that he would be allowed to get to know his littlest brother’s baby.
“Thank you Sammy,” Castiel smiled handing Dean Rosie, seeing his baby smile behind his bottle, Castiel looked back at his nephew to see tears run down his cheeks.
Michael watched the interactions between his brother and Sam. It was nice to see his brother so happy and content. Growing up with his brother he always thought Gabriel was a bit of a lose canon, he could be reckless, but to see him playing with his new son, it was good to see the responsible side to his middle brother.
“Fifteen!” Michael bellowed, “What is a child doing here,” Michael stared in anger with his ice cold eyes.
Before Castiel could answer Gabriel combed his hand through Sam’s long hair, “Not right now Baba, it’s nearly time for dinner and you still need to drink your bottle Uncle Cas made you.”
Gabriel sighed when he sees his little brother’s sad looking face. “Cassie, you shouldn’t worry so much about some homeless guy. You’ve only meet him once and you didn’t even talk to him. What you did was kind but you did your good deed for the mouth, so you need to forget and move on.”
Dean’s mouth dropped. They can’t be serious, there was no way he was going to let them put him in a dress.
“Don’t be a tight-ass Daddy. Our boy has been looking forward to this I bet, so I wanted to spoil him,” Gabriel said, winking down at Dean. Picking up the spoon he scooped a small amount.
Castiel had a closer look at the stroller. It was one of the top brands, in a nice shade of scarlet. The hood was lit up with silver stars hanging above his baby’s head. Raising his eyebrow Castiel turned to look at Gabriel.
“I’ll be fine Gabe, I can do it myself,” Castiel turned to face his brother holding his baby. Seeing the tears silently falling down Dean’s cheek he just wanted to pluck his boy up into a hug, he could tell Dean wasn’t crying because of his tantrum any more, his boy was upset and afraid.
Feeling Castiel’s hand, Dean found himself leaning into his touch, “...air...ed” he mumbled shaking his head.
“No...Da..diee..no!” Castiel sighed at hearing Dean call him Daddy, his little boy had called him Dada and he loved it, but Dean had only called him Daddy one. Hearing it again made him want to do cartwheels. He just hoped Dean wouldn’t figure out that calling him Daddy was Castiel’s now greatest weakness.
“What’s the matter sweetheart, are you feeling okay?” Castiel lowered his hand on top of his baby’s head. He doesn’t feel warm, he thought. Lowering the rail, pulling Dean’s covers back he soon smells what’s wrong. Hearing Dean start to cry quietly he picked him up out of his crib. “Oh Deany, it’s okay baby. Shh Daddy’ll fix it.”
“Cassie, you never ever need to apologise to me.” Placing his free hand onto his little brother’s cheek, Michael waited for Castiel to look at him. “I truly didn’t know what Lilith had done. If I had known she would go behind my back, I would have stopped her. I’m just so sorry you felt you had to hide from me. I’ve been a poor big brother to you. Can you ever forgive me?”
Dean sighed to himself he thought he had heard his name but he knew he was imagining it. Closing his eyes he tried to ignore it when he heard it again.
“Yeah, Mama said I have to go,”Charlie pouted as she rested her head on Castiel’s shoulder. “But I wanted to wait with you for Dean.”
Nodding, Dean sighed heavily. This was a lot to take in, he couldn’t believe what had happened to Sam. How could John do that to him? If only he had known, he could have done something.
As he walked up the stair Castiel turned to see Michael following close behind. “What are you doing Michael?”
“Would you like one Baba,” Gabriel asked. Sam looked from his Daddy to Dean. Seeing Dean smiling at him, he nodded.
“Of course he’s nice Baba. he’s the nicest person you’ll ever meet, why do you ask?” Gabriel asked, confused at his baby’s question.
“I think Dean likes your cooking,” Castiel chuckled as he picks up another bit. Dean groaned in agreement. He might think Gabriel was a dick, but the man made awesome pancakes.
Closing the door behind him, Castiel sat down at the dining table. Placing Dean on his lap, he cuddled his baby close. He was never letting go of his boy ever again.
Dean had always wanted a tattoo, but could never get the money or the courage to do it, and now that he was Castiel’s baby, he knew that was never going to happen if his Daddy had anything to say about it. The ones Castiel had was very beautiful, Dean loved the wings that filled his whole back. He wondered if they had any meaning or if Castiel just got them to have them.
“Yeah, he was in the hospital Dean was taken to. Their dick of a father tried to sell Sam to the AB program and just left him there.”
And was he sitting eating his body size of creamy goodness? Nope, he was sitting in a waiting room of a doctor’s surgery on his Daddy’s lap. He wasn’t impressed that Daddy had failed to tell him that they were doing this first.
Feeling an idea come to his mind, Castiel glance to Michael, “Mic, could you grab one of big blankets from the nursery please?”
“Alright you two, that’s enough now. Come on baby girl, we need to get going home.” Hannah held out her hands to a pouting Charlie, who wrapped her arms around Gabriel’s neck. Rolling her eyes Hannah went to pick up her child. “We’ll come back soon honey, we can even get Dean a present for next time.”
Seeing his Daddy rub at his head Dean grabbed at Castiel’s sleeve. He didn’t like seeing his Daddy in pain. He wished he could do something to make it better. Maybe kissing it would help.
“Silly baby, don’t you want to see your new home?” Patting Dean’s bum. Castiel tried to encourage his boy.
Giving Michael one last glance, Lilith smirked, picking up her phone. Well, if he can’t find it in himself to do it, she was going to have to deal with it herself.
“Bee..” Sam groaned into his Uncles chest. He just wanted to hold Dean’s bee for a little longer, why couldn’t Dean let him?
After about a minute of swaying Castiel could hear Dean’s crying start to calm into light groans and hiccups.
Dean looked at the bowl still screaming his head off. He didn’t want this, he wanted to go back in the living room, but Daddy was being mean and not listening. Feeling his anger build up soon as Daddy turned to get his own bowl, Dean used all his strength he had to knock his own bowl on the floor.
“Yea Daddy, Deany loves cars,” Sam said shyly, he might not have seen Dean in forever but he always remembered that his big brother loved cars. “It that okay Daddy?”
“I will be sure to be careful Castiel, the AB program is not the only investment our company is working on,” Michael said with a twinkle in his eye thinking over his plan.
Giving Michael a not-so-happy glare, Dean groaned before bring his hand to his mouth. Why was he sitting on Michael he wasn’t his Dada, where was his Dada. The last thing he remembered was cuddling with Sammy. Looking around as he chewed away on his fingers, Dean finds his Daddy sitting on the floor. “Da..”
A short while later Sam came back smiling, with arms full of different clothes. “Daddy...Daddy can we get these?”
Sam frowned in confusion, Dean was a little? He never remembered Dean ever being a little, his big brother was always the one that was responsible and looked after him when they lived together.
“Take your finger out of your mouth. What came up that was so important? Dean’s okay, he’s a bit shook up and hasn’t left my side till now. I’ve managed to get him down for a nap, but he’s been asking for you. I needed you.” Castiel sounded really upset with him.
Standing up Castiel walked over to the baby rocking swing that had been set up yesterday by the decorators. Pulling it over he set it up in front of the television. Gently lowering Dean into the seat Castiel placed Dean’s arms and legs into the straps before clicking them together. Picking up Rosie he lay Dean’s bee next to him. He pressed a small button on the side and the swing slowly started to rock his baby. “Alright baby, I’m going to go clean up the kitchen and get stuff ready for lunch. You enjoy your cartoons till I come get you.”
Dean wasn’t fully asleep yet, he was happily dozing listening to his Daddy’s heartbeat. He couldn’t believe how much has happened in such a short length of time, it wasn’t even really a day since he was cold and homeless, now he was safe and warm. Dean wouldn’t say he was completely happy with what has happened, he got kidnapped for god sake! He never dreamed he would be laying on another man’s lap drinking from bottles, wearing diapers and sucking pacifiers. But even though Castiel had gone about getting him in the wrong way, he has been nothing but kind and caring towards him, the man had be more loving to him in one day than anyone has his whole life.
“Shh...baby it’s okay. Such a tried baby...come on calm down.” Gabriel slowly bounced Dean, which made it worse because Dean knew that was what parents did to their crying babies. Feeling anger build up, Dean turned his head into Gabriel’s shoulder. Without even thinking he bit hard into the man’s skin.
“Hey what’s the matter with my baby boy?” Dean looked up with watery eyes, blinking back his tears as he soon saw a different face looking down at him. The new face was on a smiling man. He looked around the same age as Gabriel, his black hair hug over his bright blue eyes. Dean couldn’t help but stare the man. He was very good looking, even with a goofyish smile.
“I called the bouncers,” she said looking away from her boss. “I was just doing what I thought you would want.”
Hannah sighed to herself, she didn’t know what to tell her, but she knew Charlie wouldn’t stop asking if she didn’t get an answer.
As they walked down the street, Dean let out a small yawn. Snuggling into Rosie, he closed his eyes, enjoying the feel of the stroller moving he relaxed into a light sleep.
Patting Dean’s diaper, Castiel walked around the room shushing his baby,trying to calm him down. After Dean having his shots and so much ice-cream, he knew there was going to be some kind of meltdown.
Feeling the diaper being placed under his bum, Dean’s face scrunched up, unsure if he liked the feel of the towel soft fabric. But if Daddy said it was better he wasn’t going to complain. As Daddy pulled up the front up Dean soon realised he really couldn’t close his legs with the bulkiness. Letting out a displeased groan, Dean looked down as Daddy pulled up the pastille blue plastic pants over the diaper.
“I’m here baby, I’m sorry I took so long, come give Daddy a cuddle.” Holding his arms out, Gabriel held in a sigh when he saw Sam’s red, tear stained face. He never thought of himself as a softy, but seeing his baby so sad was really starting to get to him.
Smacking his hand on the back of her chair, Michael heard Lilith let out a gasp as he pulls her back to face him. “What did you do?” he said coldly glaring at her with his ice like eyes.
Gabriel fell silent, he was starting to regret not doing at he was told, but he wasn’t going to let Castiel be so smug. “Alright Deano, let’s go upstairs and leave your meany Daddy to clean up,” standing from the sofa Gabriel turned his nose up to his brother, walking up the stairs.
All the adults chuckled, Charlie was a sweet kid but she could be very abrupt at saying what she thinks.
“Ahhh!” Dean cried. He didn’t like it. He knew he had had worse pain than this, but he didn’t like the fact that no one, especially Daddy, had warned him that they were going to give him shots.
“Good thinking batman,” Gabriel grinned when he saw his brother give him a funny look. “Are you going to come with us?”
“I was just thinking you might like to get your baby something special from his Daddy, you go have a look round and I’ll take Dean with me.”
Dean let out a small squeal as Castiel tickled him all over. “Does that tickle baby boy? How about this?” Dean looked down with watery eyes to see Castiel place his lips on his belly. Suddenly he felt the man blow a loud raspberry into his skin, making it tingle. Feeling tears run down his face, Dean shrieked with laughter. He couldn’t remember the last time he laughed so much but it was amazing.
“Is that good baby?” Castiel asked, giving him a light bounce as he glared at his brother. Dean nodded quickly as he opened his mouth for more. Taking the spoon from Gabriel, Castiel started to feed his baby small amounts.
“For letting Sammy see Dean. I know you’ve had a hard time and just want some time with Dean but I am so grateful. I hated seeing Sam so sad. He thought he might not have been able to see his brother, it was breaking my heart.”
As Castiel walked into the kitchen he found Gabriel and Hannah sitting at his table drinking coffee.
“No you’re not, big bro,” Gabriel laughed, turning away from Michael as fast as he could. He loved his big brother but he wasn’t exactly the easiest to be around. Heading to the elevator, Gabriel waited for the doors to close to let out a long sigh. He looked down at the files in his hand, enjoying the silence. He tried to clear his mind, he couldn’t wait to tell Castiel that Dean was his baby. He knew Cas wouldn’t really care; Dean was his baby with or without the legal stuff, but it was good to have so no one could take Dean away.
Walking up to the front door, Castiel carried Dean in on his hip with his boy’s head resting on his shoulder. He couldn’t believe how light Dean was. He was going to feed his baby lots to get him to a good weight.
Dean was watching his little brother, he could tell Sam was embarrassed. He understood, but it did surprise him that Sam didn’t want him to see he was a baby. He was feeling the same, but Daddy said it was okay, they didn’t have to be embarrassed with being little around each other. He need to do something to show Sam it was okay. Feeling his belly gurgle, Dean came up with an idea.
Dean could definitely say he was very comfortable when he woke up, with the softness of the mattress under him and his covers over him he could have stayed in his sandwich of warmth all day. Wiggling into his covers more his felt something cold and heavy between his legs.
hi, sorry for the wait ive been so busy, ive had no free time to write, finally got a chapter finished I hope you like it xxxx
I promise this time, I used spell and grammar check, but please tell me if its still bad, I found a website to help me but you cant always trust them xxxx
“Oh, poor baby.” Moving in front of his brother, Gabriel undid the straps to the stroller. Lifting his nephew into his arms he hugged Dean close. “Was Daddy mean taking you to the doctor Deany?”
Dean still couldn’t tell where he was because as they moved the blue blanket shielded his vision. All he could see was Gabriel’s face and the lights above, making the man look like he had a halo.
Waiting for the others to leave, Gabriel moved to sit in front of Sam. Picking up a doll he pretended to make it walk around. “Sammy, do you remember anything form before coming here?”
“We’ll leave Cas out of it for now, I’ll just go tell him that I’m taking you home.” Nodding in agreement Michael left to get back into the car.
Castiel’s breath hitched. His baby said he loved him. Kissing the top of Dean’s head, Castiel hugged his baby close, rocking slowly.
Clamming off of Castiel lap Sam wrapped his arms around Dean’s neck. He had the best big brother in the whole world.
“Yes, you do” Gabriel said grinned before turning to Crowley, “Crowley we will take the Q3 and the Impala.”
“It’s going to be okay Castiel. Gabriel will find him.” Castiel could hear Hannah talking to him as she cleaned the blood from his forehead. She had been with him since Gabriel had left him with her, but he just couldn’t find it in himself to talk to her.
Standing, staring for a while, Castiel jumped when the brown haired boy coughed even louder than before. He really didn’t sound well. Pulling out all the bills in his wallet, Castiel crept closer. Trying his best not to wake the boy he folds the bills and places them close to the boy’s head so he could find them.
Dean hiccupped as he listened Castiel sing to him. The man’s voice was gruff but soft at the same time, he actually found it soothing. Looking up, Dean leaned into the man’s hand as he thumbed his brow. He knew he shouldn’t give in but he was so tried he just wanted to sleep. And though he would never admit it, this was the most comfortable he had been in a good while. Closing his eyes, Dean drifted into sleep listening to Castiel sing.
“He’s in that,” Gabriel said, pointing down by Castiel’s feet. Turning away from his brother, Castiel saw a beautiful stroller next to his feet by the sofa. Standing up he walked over to it to find Dean sleeping soundly. Castiel smiled. His boy he looked so comfortable with his blue blanket laying across him.
“Please, its urgent that we find the Little. He came in today not that long ago,” Gabriel said, trying not to sound despite.
Suddenly Dean hears something that sounds like a screeching banshee. Turning his head back into Gabriel he saw two women coming up to them, smiling.
Finally being able to see his body, Dean noticed he was naked apart from something white below his belly. Moving his leg against it Dean heard it crinkle lightly. It didn’t feel uncomfortable, if anything it felt soft and slightly warm. Coming out of his thoughts Dean watched Gabriel move down to his lower half.
Looking over to Gabriel, Michael shrugged his shoulders, not sure of what to do with the little boy.
“It’s your own fault Gabe, you should have give him a small ice-cream like I asked. Now you can deal with his tantrum,” Castiel grinned, loving every minute. This would teach his brother to listen to him.
Shit! Gabriel thought. He needed to come up with something to tell him fast. “I can come with you Michael, but Cas has taken his month’s holiday from work. I’m sure Hannah is more than capable of filling in.”
“You’re right,” Michael said, letting go of Lilith’s chair. “I want you gone by the time I come back,”
“That’s it, forget the scabby horse. I’m going to eat baby Dean instead.” Rolling Dean onto his back again Castiel tickled his baby’s sides before blowing loud raspberry into Dean’s belly.
Dean ignored him. Feeling Gabriel’s fingers run across his sensitive skin covered him in goosebumps.  For someone who had kidnapped him, Gabriel was surprisingly gentle as he worked.
Feeling the heaviness of the cloth diaper, he started to walk into Dean’s nursery. Moving over to the changing table, he tried to lay Dean down on the matt, but Dean was having none it. Letting out another loud squeal Dean tightened his hold around his Daddy’s neck.
Stiring his sleep, Dean slowly opened his eyes when he heard his Daddy humming. He had missed hearing his Daddy’s voice, he had missed everything about the man he truly cared for more than anything.
Closing the door behind him, Michael turned to face his brother. “Gabriel..please what has happened?”
“It’s okay baby, Dean. You’ll be able to talk again soon. It’s all part of the process of getting you ready,” The man smiled down at him as he started to undo the blanket. “My name is Gabriel. I’m here to get you all sorted for your new daddy, baby boy.”
Standing up with Dean, Gabriel followed Castiel. Taking a seat in Castiel’s recliner he got himself and Dean comfortable before holding the bottle to Dean’s lips.
Seeing Gabriel’s face fall, Castiel stood from the sofa. Placing himself on the arm of the recliner he wrapped his arms around his brother and baby. “Gabe it’s okay, it’s over with, Dean is fine.”
Dean sat quietly on his Daddy’s lap. Everyone was talking about stuff he really didn’t care about. He remembered hearing Daddy tell the lady Hannah about how he had come to be with Daddy and how Gabriel had made him the way he was, but he really didn’t want to re-live that, so he blocked them out by playing with Daddy’s fingers. Plus, he was feeling kinda hungry, he hoped they were going to eat soon.
“Da...ddie..orry...I..I..sorry..no cry please.” Wailing into the man’s shoulder, he wrapped his arms tightly around his neck.
Castiel burst out laughing at the look on Dean’s face “Okay, I’ll agree nothing can beat Gabriel’s pancakes.”
“Dean, I know me making you my baby was something you didn’t have a choice in, but I knew the night I first saw you that I felt something for you, and every day since I just wanted to look after you,” he stopped again when Dean let out a small sigh. Bringing his hand up, Castiel started to rub his finger along the boy’s cheek. “Dean, you are so beautiful and special to me and I know you must hate me right now but I hope that soon you will see that all I want to do is show you the love you deserve, baby.” Feeling a tear in his eye Castiel quickly wiped it away with his thumb.
“You are a big boy sweetpea, but it’s okay if you’re a bit overwhelmed with the crowed. It doesn’t stop you being my big brave boy.” Gabriel watched at Sam thought it over before nodding.
“It’s so nice to meet you Sammy, Dean is super excited that you’re here,” Castiel said as he rubbed his hand along Sam’s back.
Dean watched anxiously as Castiel walked round to his side of the car. Opening the door he leaned half his body in coming close to the boy.
Dean cried into his uncle’s shoulder, gripping his shirt with all the strength he had. He was really here, he had come for him.
“It’ll soon be just us baby, and we’ll go cuddle like I promised, but first let’s change that diaper and get you dressed for bed,” Castiel said, patting Dean’s diaper.
“Please Castiel, I can explain..” Michael said, walking in closer to his family, but Castiel backed from him holding Dean tighter.
Gabriel sighed to himself, he couldn’t really ask Castiel to help. He needed to be with Dean and Gabriel didn’t want Dean to know what he was up to until he was sure if what he was thinking was true.
Following his boy’s hand Gabriel spotted what Sam was looking at. “That is Rosie, she’s Dean’s bee from his Daddy,” he explained as he picked Sam up into his arms. Walking over to the crib he picked the bee up and handed it to his boy.
“Yes Sam is a Little now. John tried to sell him to the AB Program a few years ago and left him there, so the program kept him.”
Giving a slight nod, Gabriel shook his head in disapproval. It was one thing to take people against their will, that wasn’t so bad to him, especially when he thinks they’ll have a better life, but to take their minds from them was a step too far.
Castiel looked up to his brother with a smile before turning back to Dean. “Yeah we’re ready, shall we go get you some new things Deany?”
“Okay. We just need to wait for him to fall asleep then I’ll go by myself and inject him with this.” Gabriel pulled out a syringe out of his pocket.
“Aww Sammy, of course you can,” Gabriel grinned wider, he couldn’t believe how shy his little boy was. “Baby, you can have whatever you want.”
“You can’t be serious Casey. The boy had a tantrum because you stopped him watching tv and then threw his lunch on the floor, if he was my boy he would….”
“You can’t hold it baby. it’s not healthy, plus you wouldn’t be able to hold it for much longer, so it’s best to do it now.”
Gabriel felt his heart sink, he couldn’t believe Sam just did that. Looking to his brothers he could see they were just as surprised. He really didn’t know what to do, he didn’t want to tell Sam off. He didn’t want his baby to hate him after only one day, but if he didn’t Sam wouldn’t learn how he was behaving was very rude.
“Yay! Way to go, Dean. Next, we need to work on convincing your Daddy that he needs to stop wearing that dreadful trench-coat,” Gabriel smirked, poking Castiel in his arm.
Dean watched as Sam held onto his Rosie, it was nice to see that his little brother liking his bee but Rosie was his, Sammy can’t have her, she was his best friend. “Ro...” he mumbled making grabby hands towards his toy.
Castiel tightened his hold on his boy when he felt Dean wriggling. Shushing him quietly, he gently bounced his baby while turning his attention to the women.  “Hello Hannah, how are you?”
Living on the street was miserable and lonely, each day was harder then the next trying to find a way to stay alive. But what got to Dean the most was that he was alone, with no one there to care about him. Not even his own family wanted him. Even though he was nineteen and was suppose to be a man now, he still wanted someone to love him.
Castiel startled when Dean started to scream. His baby was trembling in his arm with tears running down his red, scrunched up face. “Oh baby shhh….shhh it’s okay I know this is all scary and a lot to take in, but I’m going to look after you baby.” Dean continued to cry as Castiel walked around bouncing him gently. Looking to his brother for help, Gabriel just shook his head.
Quickly grabbing it before it hit the ground, Gabriel held it up to his boys lips. Turning his face away Sam shook his head. He didn’t want it if Dean thought it was weird.
“No, no kiddo, you don’t have to be sorry. If anyone should be sorry it’s me. Your Daddy was right, it was an accident. You shouldn’t have thrown your lunch on the floor, that was bad, but I did overreact and I am sorry.”
Stepping into the family bathroom, Castiel lay Dean down on the changing table. Dean watched a bit confused, his diaper was still dry.
Castiel looked back at Dean again, he looked a lot happier. “Does that sound like a good idea baby? You want to help Daddy get a car?” he asked, smiling.
“I think it’s time for this naughty little boy to go for a nap,” Gabriel stated walking up behind Castiel. “Upstairs now Casey, I’ll be in to sort you out once I’ve put the little monster to bed.”
“What is Dean going to do with a car, he’s a baby,” Castiel said, baffled, his brother had seriously lost it.
“Yeah right, were you? That would mean putting your baby down, and I knew that wasn’t going to happen, was it?”
“Are you laughing at Daddy?” Castiel grinned as he tickled Dean under his chin. Dean tilted his head into Castiel’s fingers giggling at the feeling. “You’re too cute sweetheart,” Castiel added, moving his hand to comb Dean’s hair back. Dean sighed, grinning behind his pacifier. He really liked it when Castiel touched his face. Closing his eyes he leaning into the man’s touch. “My beautiful boy.”
When Castiel went silent again Gabriel knew his little brother was debating what to do. He just hoped it was good news.
Dean was in hysterics watching his Daddy. The look on his face when he ran to the sink was the funniest thing Dean had ever seen. Feeling his sides starting to hurt Dean leaned back in his high-chair, giggling as he started to calm down.
“Yes, he was a bold little angel,” she said through her teeth, “Had to give him a little spank when he was misbehaving.”
“Okay sweetheart, you can help Daddy,” Patting Dean’s diaper bum Castiel hears Dean sigh happily. Standing at the sink Castiel turned on the radio sitting on the window ledge. Hearing the music start Castiel walked over to the fridge, “Let’s see what we can have, hmm?” Opening the door they look inside to find one of the shelves full of the AB meals. Turning his nose up Dean hoped Daddy wasn’t going to try and feed him that again.
“Don’t be so dramatic Gabriel,” Castiel said, rolling his eyes his brother. “I was going to come and help you.”
“Did my baby miss me?” Castiel smiled, picking him up into his arms. Nodding Dean cuddled into Castiel’s shirt. “My special boy,” Castiel murmured, kissing Dean’s hair.
Gabriel could see she was about to start the waterworks, but he knew she was just putting it on. Last time he had to deal with Lilith she had tried to make him sleep with her, but girls trying to “Work their way up the ladder” were really not his type. So he fired her, but she had other plans. Guess it was a lot harder trying to get into Michael’s pants if she’s only his receptionist.
“Hello, Dr Bailey. Yes, I just recently became Dean’s caregiver and I just want to make sure he’s all okay. Isn’t that right baby?” Castiel looked down at his hiding boy.
Gabriel scoffed to himself. It was funny hearing his brother, he was starting to sound like a proper Daddy now.
Sam looked around, amazed at all the different toys. He had never seen so many different toys before. He never really had toys before, his dad never got him or Dean any. He remembered once when he was really little Dean had bought him a small brown teddy for him to play with when he had to be alone. He loved that bear, it was all he had of Dean after he was kicked out. It wasn’t long after John had found his bear and throw it into a fire yelling at him that he was too old for toys and that he needed to grow up.
Hearing a light noise coming from the room next to the one he was in, Sam peeked his head in to find Gabriel fast asleep, snoring.
Castiel’s eyes widened. Did Dean just call him Daddy? That’s what it sounded like. Tears fell as he kissed his baby’s forehead.  “I love you baby, you make me so happy.”  Taking his boy’s hand he kissed each finger. “My beautiful baby.”
“I...I sorry Daddy...De..De..he crying in his sleep...an he wouldn’t stop..it..it was scary Daddy….so I try bring him..to..you..I’m..orry.” Sam explained before starting to cry harder.
“It’ll be fine, if you’re worried about people looking at you or judging you, you don’t have to be...do you want to know why?”
Frowning Castiel knew what Dean meant. Dean didn’t want to be a baby anymore. “Dean, you don’t want to be my baby?” he asked, sounding heartbroken.
Castiel looked to Gabriel confused, Dean had never called him Dad, he always said Dada or Daddy. Unless it wasn’t him Dean meant. Castiel never really gave Dean’s first family much thought, he just figured they were dead or just didn’t care that their son was living on the street. If they did care they would have tried to find Dean. Castiel knew if Dean ever went missing, he would move heaven and earth to find his baby.
Gabriel stared at his brother, he couldn’t believe it. He thought they were taken to a high tech hospital, but this was awful, there was rubbish everywhere and the building itself looked like it would fall at any moment. “Michael,” he whispered, he couldn’t say much more than that, he was truly in shock.
Feeling something rubber brush against his lips Dean turned away from the screen to see Daddy holding the bottle to his lips. Opening his mouth Dean let the nipple in, sucking lightly he turned back to watch the cartoons.
“Okay Sammy, would you like me to carry you or would you like to walk?” Hearing his brother, Michael come out of his thought’s to hear Sam say he would walk.
Looking down he noticed Gabriel was smirking at him from the sofa. Glaring at him, Castiel throw the bottle at him hitting Gabriel’s chest.
Gabriel tilted his head looking confused, “Do you not like pink?” he really thought his boy might have wanted this, especially since Sam kept staring at it.
“I try Daddy..no one came..” Sam mumbled wiping his nose into Gabriel’s shirt. “I sorry, I not mean to hurt De.”
Dean let out a low groan into his pillow. He had pooped in his sleep again, why was that happening? Frowning at himself Dean felt disgusted. Feeling tears in his eyes he let out another groan.
He walked around Castiel’s kitchen. His brother had gone upstairs to check on the baby a good hour ago. Making use of himself Gabriel decided to clean up the mess and remake lunch. As he turned a cheese omelette over he heard footsteps coming down the stairs.
“I’ll set up for one of my men to drop the Impala off at your address Castiel. You can take the Q3 today,” Crowley said, handing over a set of keys into Castiel’s hand. Dean turned to look at them, why are they not taking his car? “..Dada..I..ar.”
“Oh Sammy, why so sad?” Plucking the boy out of his brothers arms, Castiel cuddled the sad Little close. His new nephew was so cute, it hurt to see him so sad.
“Didn’t think you knew how to do that,” Castiel chuckled as he placed one of the bottles down before sitting on the sofa closer to his big brother. Turning Dean to be cradled in his arms, Castiel looked up to see Michael frown looking away from them. He could tell he was still blaming himself for what happened to Dean.
“Do you like it baby? it's our house, and hopefully when we go in your room will be all ready for you.” Studying Dean’s face. Castiel could have sworn Dean looked a bit shell shocked. “It’ll be okay baby.” Kissing Dean’s hair, Castiel made his way up to the front door.
Chucking into his cup Castiel notices Gabriel give him a confused look. “What’s so funny?” he asks frowning when he sees Michael smiling too.
Taking hold of his other nephew’s hand Michael lowered himself off the recliner to be kneeling in front of Castiel’s legs.
Hearing the phone hang up Gabriel put his phone back into his pocket and ran back into the store to find his baby.
Feeling his cheeks warm, Sam shakes his head, burying his face into Gabriel’s neck he groaned into the man’s skin. He was a bit embarrassed that his new Daddy noticed he had a diaper on.
Dean looked at his little brother, seeing his face looking very pink he could tell Sam was feeling embarrassed at Gabriel making it obvious that Sam had used his diaper. Scoffing in his head at how silly the “adults” were, Dean just gave Sam a reassuring smile to show him it didn’t bother him.
Dean laughed hysterically at his Daddy’s face, with the stick in his mouth. He looked in shock at the way Dr Bailey was treating him like he was a child.
Chuckling, Castiel watched with joy as Dean started to suck on his fingers like he would his pacifiers. If it had been any other time he would have swapped for a pacifier, sucking fingers wasn’t very hygienic to him, but it was such a babyish thing for Dean to do that he wasn’t going to stop him, plus he was enjoying being close with his boy.
Castiel frowned at the apologies. Lifting Dean’s head off his shoulder Castiel waited till his baby was looking at him before speaking “Shh..shh its okay baby, I know you are. Daddy is not mad with you, you don’t need to keep saying sorry.” Slowly bouncing his baby Castiel walked over to the rocking chair. Lying Dean across his lap Castiel started to rock as Dean sank into his hold.
Looking down Castiel smiles seeing Dean playing with his hand. He was happy his boy wasn’t paying attention to the grown up talk. He didn’t want his baby have to worry about these things, he just wants Dean to be his happy little boy. Placing a kiss on the boy’s forehead, he soon saw those beautiful green eyes that he loved looking up at him. “Hey baby, you okay?”
“Your bouncers came and took Dean from Cas. They came in knocked Cas to the ground, held him down and took Dean,” Gabriel could feel the tears in his eyes again but he wasn’t going to let his so talked big brother see him cry.
“You’re a messy boy,” he whispered, chuckling to himself when he sees Dean quickly glance up at him before turning back to his show. “Sorry baby, Daddy’s interrupting your cartoon.”
“Thank you.” Taking the bottle, Castiel popped the lid off. Holding it to Dean’s lips he smiled when he sees his baby latch on.
“Come on Cas, the kid’s probably used your money to fund a bad habit or god knows what, and didn’t you say you saw him getting out of a car with cash? There’s a reason he’s living on the street.”
Gabriel looked at his brother in shock, he couldn’t believe Michael had done this for him. “I don’t know what to say, thank you Mikey.”
“Get Out!!” Castiel yelled towards his brother, making Dean whimpering into his chest. He had never heard his Daddy yell before.
Hearing the small noise Cas slowly rocked his baby. “Hey...baby you’re okay. You are Daddy’s special little man,” Castiel continued to rock. Hearing the boy let out a sigh, he lifted his baby up. Castiel gently placed a kiss on Deans crease brow.
Dean silently took in what his Daddy said. What did he mean Sam was there? He couldn’t have been there. Sam wasn’t a little, Sam was with John wasn’t he? That’s where he was meant to be. Sam was only fifteen, John was meant to be looking after him.
Castiel sighed happily, leaning into Gabriel. It was good to know his baby was really happy and settled. Looking down at his sleeping boy, Castiel could feel a weight being lifted. He didn’t think his day could be ruined by anything, knowing that his baby loved him.
“What!” Gabriel said, acting shocked, “How could you Sammy? Daddy’s hurt.” Pretending to cry, Gabriel put his free hand over his face to hid his smile.
Realising what Sam was thinking, Gabriel sighed looking sympathetic at his little boy. “Oh baby, Dean doesn’t hate you, he could never hate you. I’ll bet you anything he’s going to be so happy to see you.”
“Ow...Christ Gabe are you nearly gone?” Castiel was trying to stop himself from howling. Gabriel was digging the tweezers in deep get the glass out.
“Alrighty then, let’s go see what they have,” Gabriel said, opening his door. Climbing out he opened the door on his side to help Dean out. “Are you ready kiddo?” Gabriel asked as he tried to undo the straps of the car seat.
“I’m sorry Hannah. You know me and my brothers wouldn’t do anything to upset you or Charlie. I will fix this, I promise.”
Michael opened the car door without saying a word, moving around the car to meet Gabriel. He looked at his little brother with shame. “This is where the homeless are taken to become Littles.”
At hearing Castiel’s question Dean felt his stomach rumble. Castiel must have heard it too when Dean hears him laugh. Without even thinking, Dean nodded his head. He couldn’t remember the last time he ate.
“Wow Deany, look at your room. It’s wonderful! Look at the ceiling,” Castiel said, tilting his head up. Dean copied his Daddy, looking up he see stars covering every part of the ceiling. “I think they might glow when you go to bed. We’ll have to see later, won’t we?” Castiel grinned at his boy. His brother had chosen well the room was perfect for his baby.
Soon he spots Gabriel coming towards him caring Dean in his arms. Quickly opening the door Castiel held out his arms to take the boy.
Castiel smiled down at his baby. Dean looked exhausted with his eyes red and puffy. “Hey baby, I thought you might want Rosie.” Seeing Daddy hold up his bee, Dean’s heart sank. Shaking his head he kept his arms up. “Wan...Dada..want Dada...orry.”
Gabriel came up behind his brother looking at Dean’s sad, combing his hand through Dean’s blonde hair he kissed his nephew's forehead.
Rubbing his hands over his face, Gabriel let out a small groan. “Okay baby, I can’t promise anything but! I will call Cas and see what he thinks.”
“Now baby, we can’t stay in bed all day.” Though he would love nothing more to do so, he knew the sooner things got back to normal the sooner they can forget everything that had happened.
“Cas! That’s a type of stalking I think,” his brother laughed making him blush more. Seeing Castiel’s face Gabriel placed his hand on the man’s shoulder. “Cas, do you think you might like this guy?” Castiel frown up at him, “I mean like like him.”
“I don’t care, just….” Castiel turned away, closing his eyes he rubbed his face into Dean’s soft hair. “Just stay away from us.”
“..ank..ou.” he whispered. He wanted to say so much more to the man that had done so much for him, he had given him the best Daddy and saved him from the hell hospital and now Gabriel had saved his little brother. He truly was a good man.
Sam nodded, looking at the man nervously. He remembered him from last night, he was Gabriel’s brother Michael.
“I know its a lot to asked Cassy, but Sam needs this. He thinks Dean will hate him. I can’t watch my baby be so upset, its breaking my heart, please Cas, please!”
Lilith looked at her boss in shock. She had never seen him look so conflicted. She could see he was struggling to do what need to be done. “I’ll call him sir, and have him come here.” Seeing Michael nodded weakly, she turned to leave.
Laying Dean down on his bed, Castiel moved his main pillows to place around his baby. He knew Dean wasn’t likely to fall, but he rather know his boy was safe.
“..I...orry...ow..” Dean cried making his voice hitch. He wanted to say sorry, he really did feel bad, he just hoped Daddy didn’t hate him now.
“What?” Gabriel said, but before he could protest anymore, Castiel lowered his crying boy into his brother’s arms. Cradling Dean close Gabriel looked up at Castiel, a bit shell shocked.
“No, I’m just watching him. He’s my brothers little,” Gabriel said grinning, checking out the ladies. Having Dean had its benefits, he thought.
“I couldn’t,” Michael shock his head looking upset. “Believe me or not Gabriel but I do love both you and Castiel, it upset me that you hid this from me.”
Smiling down at the boy’s Castiel watched them for a moment as they cuddle in close to one another. Seeing the boys smiling he knew that this was what the boys really needed. Seeing Michael walk back in with the blanket, Castiel took it and lay it around the boys. Leaning over he kissed both on the forehead. “We’ll just be in the kitchen my angels, call if you need anything okay.”
Dean scoffed. This man did sound funny. Sucking on his pacifier, Dean lifted his head to see his Daddy and Gabriel not looking very impressed at being called ladies.
“You don’t know that for sure. He might just be having a hard time.” Castiel didn’t really what to think of what Gabriel said as true, but he knew his brother might have been right.
“Sorry baby, he’s back with his Daddy,” Gabriel nearly felt like crying when he saw Sam’s face fall, he didn’t want to upset him. He couldn’t imagine how Sam was feeling, he knew if he had been away from his brothers for so long he would be devastated not to see them. “Would you like to see him?”
Castiel worryingly looked up the stairs. How was he going to tell Dean? He just knew this wasn’t going to go well when he tells Dean that his little brother is also a little as well.
“Shhh..it’s okay Dean, Daddy’s here, Daddy’s here.” Changing Dean with tears in his eyes, Castiel felt lost at what to do, nothing he was doing was working to calm his baby down.
While enjoying the peacefulness, the three bother jumped when they hear a loud thud and a scream coming from the living-room. Quickly getting up Castiel ran into the room to find Dean wailing on the floor with Sam standing over him.
Moving back to the end of the changing table, Castiel got to work cleaning his boy up. Undoing the snaps Castiel started to remove Dean’s sleeper, leaving Dean in just his diaper. Feeling a lot happier, Dean watched his Daddy. The man worked fast to clean up the mess. Holding Dean’s legs up to his chest Castiel folded up the old diaper placing it in the diaper bin, sliding a new thick diaper under his boy’s bum he used his free hand to shake the baby powder. Lowering Dean’s legs down, Castiel pulled up the front and did up the tapes.
Dean started to calm hearing his Daddy talk to him. Seeing what was in the bowl Dean pulled a face at the strange brownish goo. Daddy could not be serious. He had seen nicer looking food in garbage bins he had searched through.
Lifting his head up to look over Gabriel’s shoulder, Dean thought he had seen his Daddy, only to realise it wasn’t him. The man standing his distance looked just like Castiel, but he was a lot taller and more smartly dressed in a suit and tie.
“I have….. clearly they have pulled a few strings and have tried to hid this from me,” Michael couldn’t believe this had happened. Why would they do this and not tell him? His brothers must have known he would find out eventually.
Walking into the nursery, Castiel walked up to the crib. Smiling down at his boy, Castiel gently stroked the back of his fingers along Dean’s warm check.
Closing the car door, Castiel turned to find Gabriel pushing the stroller to him. “All okay Casey?” he asked,  nodding his head towards Dean.
Picking up the stuffy, Castiel handed it to his little boy. “It’s a perfect name for her sweetheart. We can’t leave Rosie behind, can we?”
Castiel watched both boys cuddled against him, seeing tears running down the boys cheeks, he knew he needed to do something to make it right between them.
Feeling tears start to fall, Dean knew he didn’t have much choice. His belly was really starting to hurt. Trying to relax, he felt his diaper start to become heavy as he pee’d. Still feeling cramps, Dean looked up at his Daddy, “...Can’t..”
Still, with Dean roaring into his shoulder, Castiel patted lightly on Dean’s diaper feeling it was heavy in his hand.
“Ahh...Casey...I don’t I think I can..” Gabriel mumbled as he moved Dean to be more comfortable in his arms. Dean let out a small moan at being moved.
Enjoying the peacefulness, Castiel relaxed watching his baby. It was how it should be. No drama, no sadness. Just him and his boy together like he wanted. He just hoped nothing more happened to disturb their peace.
“No Casey, that it. Believe me, I dug deep to find what I did. There is no record of hospital visits or jobs he’s had, It's like he’s only known the street since he turned sixteen.”
“Cas...CAS! Look at me, you have done nothing wrong.” Holding Castiel’s face in his hands he placed a hard kiss onto his brother’s forehead, not caring if he got blood on himself. “You have done nothing wrong,” he whispered, pulling Castiel into him.
“It’s okay Deany, I’m right here. I’m not going anywhere baby. Daddy’s just going to make you something to eat,” Castiel tried to de-tangle Dean’s fingers, but the little boy had a death grip on his shirt.
“Okay baby, shall we go call Gabriel? He being waiting for us to call.” Standing up with Dean in his arms, Castiel made his way towards the door.
“Sorry baby. I said when lunch was ready it was time to turn the tv off,” Castiel said as he undid Dean’s straps.
“Hey, just thought you would like to give Dean a bit extra since he didn’t eat a lot earlier,” Gabriel whispered, walking up to the rocking chair.
Gabriel watched his brother’s face. He really did look like he was telling the truth. “You really didn’t send them, did you.”
Laughing hysterically, Dean’s eyes water. Wiggling, trying to get away from Castiel’s hands, Dean felt himself pee into his diaper a little.
Picking the bottle up, Gabriel looked up at him confused. Smirking back Castiel turned to his baby. “Okay baby, Uncle Gabe is going to give you your bottle.”
Leaning his back into Castiel’s chest Dean relaxed into his Daddy’s hold, it helped him forget about the awful time at the doctors. He knew deep down that Daddy only took him because he cared and wanted to make sure he was healthy. He still didn’t like that he had to go and that Daddy didn’t tell him. But it was over with and Daddy kept his promise and he was going to have ice cream for the first time in ages.
Nodding, Dean cuddled into his Daddy to breathe in his scent. He had no plan on letting Daddy go today, so sitting watching cartoons sounded great to him.
Dean couldn’t believe it, Gabriel had got him a car, his first car, this was without a doubt the best day in his whole life. While his Daddy and Uncle sorted the paperwork, Dean looked on at his new car. He couldn’t wait for Daddy to take him out for a drive.
“Cas,” Feeling a warm hand on his shoulder Castiel sees Michael looking at him worried. “May I try something,” he asked, bring his other hand to Castiel’s face he rubbed his thumb along his cheek.
Dean could feel his face redden at hearing his Daddy tell Gabriel. He didn’t need to say it so loudly.
“Charlie..this Dean he’s Uncle Cas’s baby. Do you want to say hi? Now, you have to be gentle because Dean is a little baby.”
Dean sighed when he tasted the warm vanilla milk, sucking greedily he enjoyed the warmth of his belly being full.
“This is my son, Dean,” Castiel said, rubbing his hand along his baby’s back. Feeling his Daddy’s touch Dean turned to face him. Letting out a small whimper Dean stretched his arms out to his Daddy. He wanted Daddy now, it was starting to feel like forever since he cuddled his Daddy, he knew he was safe there.
“Thank you Hannah. Thank you for all your help. I will give you a call about Charlie’s birthday party.” Castiel walked with Hannah to the front door, slowly rocking Dean.
“In restless dreams I walked alone, Narrow streets of cobblestone, Neath the halo of the street lamp I turned my collar to the cold and damp.”
Don’t get him wrong, he was still feeling pretty terrified at Sam seeing him like this. He knew he would have felt the same if his Daddy had done that to him, but he just knew if he acted like everything was fine and normal it would make his little brother feel more comfortable.
Dean nodded his head quickly. He had always loved cars. His dad was a mechanic, so he had grown up around them. His dad wouldn’t let Dean near the cars he worked on, which did upset the boy because he would have loved to learned to fix the beautiful machines, but his dad had kicked him out before he could go to school to learn how to. He even didn’t get the chance to learn to drive, and he didn’t have money to pay to learn. Hearing Gabriel ask him to help get Castiel a car, it kinda made him feel important.
Sitting together in silence, Castiel could feel himself start to nod off again. Shaking his head, he removed his fingers from Dean’s mouth making Dean groan as he stretched his arms.
“Okay, Daddy’s back baby. Look what I have!” Putting on a smile, Castiel placed the bowl on the tray in front of his boy.
“You think that was funny do you?” Castiel said, struggling to keep a straight face. He decided to have a bit of fun with his baby. Walking up to Dean he folds his arms, looking down at his little boy.
Walking through the glass doors, Gabriel and Castiel chuckled at hearing Dean’s gasp. The warehouse was full of cars. From classic to new, there were all different makes and models filling the massive space. Dean couldn’t believe it, he had never seen so many classic cars in his life.
“Uncle Cas is upset Baby, he’s hurt his head and he’s missing Dean,” Surprising Hannah, Charlie didn’t ask any more questions. She just looked at her Uncle with a small sad frown. Watching her girl nervously, Hannah looked on as Charlie climbed onto Castiel’s lap.
Walking into the room Gabriel stopped in the doorway, shocked at what he finds. “What is going on in here?”
While waiting for the takeaway, Castiel took Dean up for his bath. As the bath filled he removed Deans clothes and wet diaper. Checking Dean’s skin he could see small patches of red starting to form around Dean’s genitals.
“Don’t sound too surprised. Yes, I changed him and feed him, I found him wondering around this morning, thank you for letting me stay by the way.”
“Sammy thought you might like to have Rosie, Deano,” Gabriel explained as he lay Sam to be cradled in his arm. Seeing Sam cuddle the bee close Gabriel wondered if he was going to give Dean his stuffy. “Sammy, can you pass Dean his bee please?”
Watching Michael rise to his feet, Gabriel soon followed as he opened his office door and marched over to his receptionist.
“You all done baby?” Nodding, Dean wiggled trying to make himself more comfortable, he knew he needed to pee and maybe poop, but he was trying so hard to hold it. He really didn’t want to use his diaper in public.
“Now, as for Dean, there are a few things that need to be seen to. Physically Dean is okay, it looks like he’s had previous broken bones but they have healed well. He is underweight but I’m sure you’re feeding him good food and he’ll put some weight on. I will prescribe a specialised formula that will help with that. He has a small diaper rash as you know, and it looks like a has a small abdominal tear. It’s healing, but I will give you cream to help it if it reopens.”
Dean frowned. His Daddy was looking at him very seriously, he wasn’t sure he was going to like this news.
Sam sucked on his pacifier faster, he didn’t really want to remember about his life before, he had been through some things he would rather forget, but he didn’t want to make this man mad. If he made Meg do as she was told, Sam felt he wasn’t someone to mess around with.
“Okay, we’ll head home then. Call me if you need anything, you hear me?” Hannah said, giving Castiel a stern look.
“We’ll be fine. I think with some sleep and a very very long cuddle, myself and my Bumblebee will be back to normal, wont we baby?” Castiel said towards Dean, asleep in his arms. Dean had slept the whole car ride home. His little boy looked exhausted from the moment Gabriel handed him over. Castiel couldn’t help but think he looked almost as bad as the day he first saw Dean laying in the church archway.
Stepping in he finds his little brother sitting at the dining table, quietly cradling his baby close. Dean looked to be asleep, holding his Daddy’s shirt.
“Yeah, just got a little nervous,” he said, patting Dean’s diaper bum. Giving it a slight squeeze it still felt dry. Shrugging, Castiel didn’t want to make a big thing out of it, his boy was nervous enough. He didn’t want to make Dean feel uncomfortable with him, but he was worried Dean hadn’t gone since he woke up.
Placing Dean down onto the floor, Castiel smiled as he watched his boy tried to get closer to Sam. Seeing Dean struggling he lifted Dean back up and sat on the floor with him on his lap. “Wow Sammy, that looks like a fun race track. You are very kind to get that for your brother.”
When Castiel finished, Dean nodded again with a smirk. Acting normal, Castiel stood with Dean in his arms and turned to his brother, “The pancakes were amazing Gabriel. Dean absolutely loved them, didn’t you baby?” Dean nodded, giving a little smile.
He had been startled awake at Dean’s body jumping next to him. Seeing his baby so upset and broken really was breaking his own heart. He never want this for his baby. He took Dean to give him love and a family, but after everything, he felt like he hadn’t done his job as a Daddy very well.
“Sammy, can you look at me please?” Waiting, he soon saw two big bright eyes looking up at him, “Baby, what your old Dad told you was wrong. Boys can like pink, pink is not just a girls colour, just like blue isn’t a boys colour. I know you like it, don’t you?” Seeing Sam nod shyly Gabriel decided to continue. “Well, then if you like this I will get it for you. I never want you to feel like you can’t have something just because others are to pig headed to let you. If you like something then nothing and no one can stop you from liking it, do you understand Baby?”
Castiel grinned as his baby leaned into him, he hadn’t thought Dean would be ready to do that. Rubbing his hand along his boy’s back he felt the bumps of Dean’s ribs. He couldn’t believe how thin his baby was. Frowning to himself, Castiel kissed Dean’s shoulder before slowly pushing the boy head up to see his face, “Are you hungry baby?”
Dean looked at Castiel. No one had ever talked to him the way Castiel does, everything the man has said and done so far had be kind and gentle. Maybe he really did care.
“Na, don’t get mushy with me Cassie,” Gabriel pulled out of the hug. “Oh, by the way, your baby smells.”
“Sammy, I have something important to tell you,” Gabriel stopped when he sees Sam lift his head from his shoulder. The boy had such beautiful eyes, Gabriel felt butterflies in his stomach has he looked into them, “Sammy, your brother Dean, he’s my nephew. My little brother is his Daddy, Dean is a little just like you.”
Calming down slowly, Sam relaxed, breathing in his Daddy’s scent. He didn’t know why it bothered him so much, he knew Daddy was coming back, he said he was. But John use to say the same thing but never did. After Dean was kicked out, his real Dad always left him alone for a very long time.
Seeing the boy’s face Gabriel burst out laughing. “I’m only joking kid, you should see your face though!” he continued to laugh as he put the dress back in the bag.
Seeing tears forming in the young girl’s eyes Gabriel got up from his chair. “Hey pretty girl, come give Uncle Gabe a cuddle. I’ve missed my special girl’s hugs.” Standing in front Hannah he plucked Charlie from her arms to give the girl a big hug. “Don’t be sad flower, do you remember how tried you were on your first night with mommy?” Seeing the girl nod her head Gabriel continued. “Dean has had a long tiring day and he’ll have to go to bed soon, and look at Uncle Cas! It takes a lot of beauty sleep to look that pretty,” hearing Charlie giggle Gabriel tickled her cheek, making her giggle more.
“No!” Dean frowned holding his arms out to Gabriel, he wanted to stay up and play. Seeing the man shake his head, he knew Gabriel wasn’t going to pick him up, he dropped his arms in a huff he let out a loud howl.
Dean let out a small whine, he could feel his skin starting to itch. He couldn’t remember using his diaper. Out of everything, Dean really didn’t like having to wear the diapers. It made him feel icky knowing he was sitting in his own pee and poop.
“God knows, knowing Cas he’ll probably sit in front of his TV watching Netflix the whole time. I might have to go check if he’s still alive before he is due to come back.”
Dean looked into Gabriel’s eyes. He really looked angry with him. He could understand why, he had hurt Daddy, Gabriel’s brother, all because he wanted to watch the tv. It was a stupid reason to have a fit, the man kindly let him do what he wanted and he threw it back in his face like a jackass.
“Oh Sammy, shh, it’s okay. Thank you for apologising,” Gabriel said, pulling his boy onto his lap. “I know you just want to play with Dean, but Daddy said no and sticking your tongue out at me was very rude.”
“That does sound like something he would do. Have you finished the reports on the new AB’s we have acquired this week Gabriel?” Michael asked.
Dean looked to his Daddy. The man was playfully pouting at him, making Dean giggle. His Daddy did look funny. Shaking his head, Dean looked away. He wasn’t going to let Daddy win. The bowl of mush looked gross, and he could swear it was moving.
“Let me just bring up your files. I think we’ll start with Dean first,” Dr Bailey said, bring up the files on her computer. “Dean Winchester Novak, it looks like he hasn’t had any appointments since he was four years old. I think we better update his file. Can you remove the baby’s clothes leaving just his diaper?”
Castiel watched his baby, he really did look adorable while drinking his bottle, he couldn’t believe how well Dean had taken to being his baby. He was expecting some kinda fight to come from the boy, but he seemed to be content.
Dean nodded happy, he stop listening when he heard Daddy say okay, he was just excited to get the chance to do something he wanted to do.
Gabriel pulled Castiel’s arm closer to him “Castiel, you’ve got glass in your arm and you’re bleeding.”
Sighing, Castiel looked over to Dr Bailey. Seeing her smile with sympathy she turned to her computer to bring up Castiel’s file.
Walking across the hall into his room, Castiel pulled back the bed covers and lay Dean down on one side of his bed.
“They’re fine, we’ve left them snuggled up together on the recliner.” taking a seat Castiel picked up one of the cups. Seeing his brothers do the same Castiel smiled into his cup, it had been a very long time since the three of them had been at a table together that didn’t involve work.
“I’m afraid Mr Novak can’t be your Daddy any more, but don’t worry we’ll find you a new family soon.”
“Your humour is turning into Gabriel’s, I won’t hesitate to put you in the corner Angel.” standing from the rocking chair, Michael stood with Dean in his arms. “I think your Daddy is being too bold, what do you think Dean, stall I put him into the corner.”
“I know. I heard it all,” Hannah said, sounding very unimpressed as she walked down the stairs. “Charlie could hear it to. She’s worried about her uncles, Gabriel. I don’t want my little girl upset.”
“You’re welcome sweetheart. I’m glad you like it.” Smiling, Castiel combed his hand through Dean’s hair. Hearing his boy hum again, he started to push his happy baby.
Dean looked at the creamy looking milk in the bottle. It definitely looked nicer than the first thing Daddy, but he still wasn’t sure about it.
Holding on to his Daddy, Sam looked on nervously. Why were they going into the kitchen? When they entered Sam’s eyes widened at what he saw. Swaying around the kitchen with big grins on their faces, Castiel was dancing with Dean on his hip making him giggle by blowing raspberries into his neck.
Dean’s eyes looked red with tears. what could have upset his boy so much? “Deany, baby, what’s wrong tell Daddy?”
“If I may. If it is okay with Dean, I will have his car specially cleaned and polished with a special wax I use for all of my classics, then when I drop it off, it will look beautiful,” Crowley said, hoping to satisfy the little.
Seeing his baby so happy, Castiel rolled his eyes, he knew there was no way he would say no to his beautiful boy.
Heading home Dean kept trying to look out the window to see if he could see Daddy. They had decided to leave Dean’s car-seat in Gabriel’s car till they got home to save time on fiddling with it to get it in Castiel’s car. Dean wasn’t too happy not being with his Daddy, but he didn’t say anything encase he upset them and they took his new car away.
“I know, but it’s not your fault,” Castiel said as he stroked Dean’s face. “I know you would have done something if you had known, but you were going through a hard time yourself.”
Laying a whining Dean down on in his stroller, Castiel kissed his cheek before standing to remove his shirt.
“Maybe we’ll start with you first Mr Novak,” she said, turning back looking at Dean. “If it’s okay with Mr Dean, I will check your Daddy first, then after, I will have a look at you.”
“Good choice kiddo. Let’s get the ball pool to go with those, daddy might enjoy playing with these with you.”
Feeling a hand take a hold of his, Dean looked down at Hannah, “Daddy will be back in just a minute Dean, you didn’t tell me what your bee’s name is.” Dean pulled his hand away, he wanted his Daddy not Hannah, why was she getting in the way. Letting tears fall he started to cry, he was tired and hungry, he just wanted to cuddle like Daddy said they would.
“Deany, you don’t need to be big, Sam knows you’re a little,” Castiel told him, understanding what Dean meant. “He’s looking forward to playing with you.”
“Your Uncle can be a bit of an asshole sometimes, but he can be fun,” Castiel said, placing another kiss on Dean’s cheek. Hearing Dean scoff, Castiel lay him down on his back before tickling his babies belly, “Do you agree with Daddy hmm? You think it’s funny don’t ya?”
Huffing back a quiet laugh Castiel snuggled the sad little boy close, he knew what would cheer him up.
Opening his mouth, Dean let his Daddy put the nipple in. If Daddy said it was good then he would give it a try. Feeling the warm liquid hit his tongue Dean hummed happily. It tasted of vanilla and coconut and was one of the best thing he had ever tasted next to Gabriel’s pancakes, of course. Sucking on the nipple he drank his bottle quickly. Enjoying the feel of his belly being warm and full, Dean closed his eyes.
Dean shook his head. He didn’t want Daddy to put him down, if Daddy let’s go he’ll be taken again, he was not letting Daddy go. “No! Dada!”
Reluctantly, Castiel passed Dean over. Having Dean out of his arms he felt like grabbing him back, but he knew he’d have his boy back soon. Watching Gabriel walk down the hall, Castiel stood looking at the closed door for a while.
Gabriel sighed. He felt like a shit! He felt bad at how he treated Dean. He had been a bit of a jerk to the poor boy. He didn’t mean to be so harsh, but seeing his baby brother on the floor bleeding, he just saw red and took it out on Dean. The boy looked so scared, Gabriel couldn’t get Dean’s teary face out of his mind.
Feeling his cheeks warm, Dean buried his face into Gabriel neck. He didn’t like them all looking at him.
Looking into the stroller Castiel smiled seeing Dean close to sleep, hugging his bee close to his face.
Gripping his Daddy’s shirt Dean hid his eyes into Castiel’s shoulder. He didn’t want Daddy to think he was rude, but Dean still didn’t feel comfortable around new people. Feeling a soft pat on his diaper bum, Dean peaked up at his Daddy, hoping he wasn’t mad.
Gabriel just smiled at his brother. He loved it when he made his little brother confused.  Without asking Gabriel lifted Dean out of Castiel’s arms into his own. “What do you think Deany? Daddy can get the Q3 for himself for everyday use and I can get you the Impala just for you, and you can get me or Daddy to drive you wherever you want. It’ll be like you’re a prince and me and Daddy are your chauffeurs.”
Nodding his head, Sam watched his Daddy leave the room. Hearing the shower start up, he tried to relax. He knew Daddy was coming back, wasn’t he?  He didn’t like being on his own. Feeling anxious, he started to feel tears run down his cheeks.
Hearing Gabriel’s voice, Michael smiled when he saw his brother walk back in with Sam dressed in only his diaper.
Dean watched Castiel. Seeing that he had messed in a diaper he felt like crying. He felt so humiliated. He hadn’t had an accident in years, not since he lived with his dad. And these men were making him do it in a diaper.
Walking onto the office floor, he ignored all the onlookers and whispers around him. There was only one person he was here to see.
“Okay, thanks Gabe,” Castiel said, placing the folders next to him. Looking at it was just pissing him off. What kind of father didn’t make sure his children were taken care of? This John Winchester, by the sound of him, was an asshole. Now that he had a name for the man Castiel knew if he ever meet him, he would punch him in the face.
“Yeah, I think we should head back,” (Cas might come over) he mouthed so Sam didn’t hear. If Gabriel was honest he was surprised Sam hadn’t asked about Dean, guess not having his Daddy really did upset him.
Castiel grinned at his boy. “Alright then, if it makes my Deany happy I’ll get a car,” he said, glaring back to Gabriel.
Dean looked up at jumper the man held up. It was bright yellow with a brown teddy bear on the front. Was Castiel serious? That thing was ugly. He really hoped the man was messing with him.
Laying Dean’s head back in the crock of his arm Castiel picked up the large blue pacifier and placed it inside his baby’s mouth. Dean scrunched up his nose. He still wasn’t sure about the pacifier but he remembered what Gabriel had said before and decided to keep it in.
After what felt like an hour of non-stop cuddles, Castiel decided it was time to move. Though he would have loved stay there all day, his arms were starting to hurt.
Hearing the others laugh Gabriel bit his lip trying not to laugh himself.  “You cheeky monkey, what are you implying?” Sitting in his chair, Gabriel started to tickle the curly haired girl more. “And its Gabriel not Gabrielle, you silly bean.”
“No,” Castiel sighed, turning away from the window. “I’m not mad with you Gabe, I just panicked when I saw my baby so upset….it’s just...Christ Gabriel, Dean hasn’t been a baby a whole day yet and you used him to flirt with women…. I trusted you with him..if I can’t trust you who can I trust?”
Dean felt his breathing start to hitch, hot tears ran down the sides of his face he started to cry loudly.
Sighing, Castiel realized he wasn’t going to be able to do much without Dean having a mega meltdown. It was clear that the trauma of yesterday had made Dean regress.
“Hey little man,” Gabriel grinned, holding out his arms for the boy. Soon as Sam reached him, he picked Sam up into the air making his baby giggle. “What are you doing up so early?”
Castiel nodded as Dr Bailey talked. His boy was so small, he knew Dean need to put on some much needed weight. He knew it wasn’t going to have a problem getting Dean to eat since his boy loved his and Gabriel’s cooking.
Castiel made quick work of cleaning up Dean’s wet diaper. He just wanted to have his baby back in his arms. Picking Dean up, he was shocked when Dean tried to push him away. He went to sit on the bench in the corner. Cradling his boy Castiel watched his baby. He look so sad and tired. He thought Dean had started to warm to him, maybe he was just imaging it. He started to think maybe he should really explain to Dean why he had taken him. Taking a deep breath, Castiel nodded his head to himself.
“Daddy has to take his car baby. Gabriel has to drive his car home so Crowley is going to bring yours home for us,” Castiel said, hoping his boy understood.
Closing his eyes, trying to stop them falling, Dean soon felt a warm hand stroking his belly. Opening his eyes he saw his Daddy standing over him. He blinked a few time to make sure he wasn’t imagining what he saw. “..Dad..ie..” he choked out, lifting his hands up.
Gabriel sighed to himself as he waited outside the ice-cream store. He hadn’t been there long, but after another boring board meeting with Michael and Hannah, he couldn’t wait to meet up with Castiel and Dean for some much needed down time.
Dean couldn’t help but roll his eyes, he knew he couldn’t touch them. Even if he could, he wouldn’t, they were too special. Dean knew if he owned any of these cars he wouldn’t want people breathing on them, let alone touch them.
“It’s okay baby Daddy will clean you up. I think a bath will make my boy feel good.” Smiling to his baby, Castiel turned to walk up the stairs. “How does that sound baby? A nice warm bath, then we’ll have cuddles before bed.”
Stepping into the littles clothes store, Gabriel decided to wander off, leaving Castiel to look around with Dean. Going down each aisle, Castiel pick up clothes he liked. So far he had seven onesies, four rompers, and three pairs of elastic jeans.
Feeling Daddy smother his face in kisses Dean cried loudly. He was going to get lots and lots of ice cream after Daddy made him go through this.
Seeing his Daddy’s face, Dean felt his heart sink. He didn’t mean to hurt Daddy’s feelings, but he needed to be big for Sam.
Dean felt his heart stop. What did she mean Castiel wasn’t his Daddy,? He didn’t want a new family, he liked the one he had. “No...No..Dada..I wan..Dada..” he cried, slamming his fists on the hard plastic.
Feeling Gabriel pull him into his side Castiel quickly wiped the tears away as he lay his head on his brother’s shoulder.
Dean could feel his heart ache. He couldn’t believe what he had done. He just hoped Daddy would forgive him. Or would he get rid of him? He didn’t want to go back on the streets. Looking up at the stars shining above him Dean quietly sniffled as tears continued down the sides of his face, he really hoped Daddy was okay.
As he lay by himself, he just kept thinking of his Daddy, He couldn’t get the image out of his head of his Daddy laying on the floor with blood coming from his forehead and a large man pinning him down. Daddy was hurt, that’s why he couldn’t stop them right? The question kept going through his mind, if Daddy wasn’t hurt he would have done something to stop those mean men from taking him.
Dean felt butterflies in his stomach. He tried to keep distracting himself, watching the world though the car window, but the tingling kept rolling around his insides. This shopping trip would be the perfect chance to escape from his kidnappers. He could scream to get people’s attention try and tell them he was taken against his will. But as he thought about it, it made him feel sick and nervous. If he tried anything and failed Castiel might change the way he treating him, the man could start being mean or decide to punish him by hurting him.
“There we go, this is nice hmm?” Gabriel said, holding the bottle to Dean’s lips with one hand he used his other to hold his head up so he could see his favourite boy.
Gabriel watched as Dean started to drift off. Feeling his own eyes become heavy, he removed the half empty bottle from the baby’s mouth and replaced it with the pacifier. Watching the paci bobbing under Dean’s nose, Gabriel lay his head close to Dean’s, placing his hand lightly onto the boy’s belly before closing his eyes happily falling asleep.
Gabriel sighed, leaning against the wall he slid down till he was sat on the floor. “I’m sorry Michael. Castiel found Dean himself. I just wanted to help him, so I convinced him to have Dean become his little and because of your rule on couples only, we were worried you would think Castiel cheated you of profit.”
Blinking, Michael looked at his little brother with a slight blush on his cheeks. “Sorry Castiel, I was daydreaming.”
Gabriel burst out laughing, making Dean and Castiel jump, “You’ve been a Daddy what, five minutes? And you’re already wrapped round his finger. The little bugger bit me when I tried changing his diaper.”
Sam sighed, clutching Gabriel. He hasn’t known his new Daddy very long but he could tell that Gabriel wasn’t anything like John, no one could ever be as bad as him.
Jumping, Castiel looked down to see Dean holding up a chocolate covered hand on his face. Hearing Gabriel laugh, Castiel burst out laughing, licking away the cream on his lips. His baby was just so cute.
“That’s not your job to decide. Your job is to answer phone and get me coffee that’s all you’re really good for,” Gabriel watched on as Michael leaned over the blond women, his face was pure anger. He’s never seen Michael so angry before. It was kind of scary, but he wasn’t going to stop him. “And now because of your stupidity my little brother is distraught from having his baby taken. I might be, as you all say, a cold hearted asshole, but no one messes with my family. Do you understand? No One!” he yelled, making Lilith jump in her skin.
“We will get to the toys, be patient Uncle Gabriel. I swear Dean, I’m starting to wonder who’s the kid here,” Castiel looked down at Dean, rolling his eyes playfully, making Dean scoff behind his pacifier. Castiel laughed, feeling Gabriel elbow him in the arm.
“By whom? You’re not taking my son,” Castiel screamed as he tried to close the door. But the men were stronger than him and storm into his house. “NO!! you can’t take him….Gabriel!!” as he screamed up the stairs, the next thing he knew he was hit the ground. Hitting his head all he could just see drips of blood falling above his eyebrow. His body numb, he didn’t feel a weight sitting on top of him. With blurred vision, Castiel watched as one of the men ran up the stairs. Trying with all his strength to move, the weight on top of him was so heavy. He had to stop them, he needed to get to Dean, he had to get to his baby. The next thing he heard makes his heartbreak, he could hear his Dean cry loudly for his Daddy as they came down the stairs.
“Meh… I see it as a win-win thing. The homeless get a home and the Mommies and Daddies get their babies. Can’t complain really. Right, let’s go get your baby boy.” Gabriel stretched his arm around Castiel’s shoulders. Castiel relaxed into his brother. Maybe what Gabriel said was right, this would be a good thing for Dean.
Dean watched his Daddy. Seeing him start to undo his shirt buttons Dean felt his cheeks turn red when Castiel removed his shirt, exposing his back to him. Dean eyes widened when he noticed the large tattoo of wings filled Castiel’s back. Looking at the design of the wings, Dean could see a lot of detail had been put into every feather. Each one shaded in black and grey with a hint of dark blue, making them look like they were alive.
“No mama, I want to stay with Uncle Casey,” Charlie frowned at her mommy. She didn’t want to go home.
Dean felt his check warm. The man seemed to know what to say and do to make him confused with his feelings. There was something about Castiel that made Dean feel strangely relaxed.
“Mickey, this wasn’t your fault. I believe you when you said you didn’t do this. This was all Lilith, she was the one that called to have Dean taken, you just have shit taste in receptionists. You didn’t know she was going to do this and when we tell our little brother he’ll understand.”
“Oh well, guess we’ll have to get you new things, won’t we Uncle Mikey?” Gabriel said winking up at his brother.
“When you looked up the name we gave you, you said the was two Winchesters, who was the other one?” Gabriel asked.
Nodding his head Dean, turned to look out the window. They were going through a town. He wondered where they were going. Turning back, Dean looked to his Daddy, confused.
“Work?” Gabriel whispered, not taking his eyes off of Dean. “Work was fine...Oh, I have the paperwork, you are officially Daddy to a Mr. Dean Winchester?”
As he got closer to Michael’s office he found his big brother standing, reading papers in his hand. Seeing the man’s perfect face Gabriel could feel anger fill his body.
“Up we go. Let’s have a nice bath, then we’ll put on our PJ’s and snuggle on the sofa with Uncle Gabriel till bedtime. How does that sound? Good?” Castiel asked. Nodding, Dean let out a relaxed sigh at being lowered into the warm water.
Castiel wasn’t falling for it. He could see Dean was struggling to control himself. “Gabriel, I’m just going to use the restroom, we’ll be back in a moment.”
Flicking though the pages Castiel started to wonder if he could do this with Dean. He always wanted to be a Daddy. Maybe he could be Dean’s Daddy.
Nodding not knowing what else to do Castiel watched as Michael carefully pick his baby up from the table.
“Would you like me to care you for a while, Samuel?” Michael asked, holding his arms out, “I’m quiet tall so you’ll be higher the everyone else, even Daddy,” smirking to Gabriel, Michael grinned when Sam giggled jumping into his arms.
“No...Sammy..No!” Dean said sternly tightening his hold around his brother, he didn’t want to hear his baby brother apologies, nothing was his fault. “Love..ou..”
Sighing, Dean watched as Sam’s face fell. He didn’t want Sam upset with him, but he wasn’t going to let him get away with being a little monster.
“Sure, I’ll get us a beer while I’m at it,” he said, walking into the kitchen. After a minute or two Gabriel walked back in with a warm bottle and two cold beers.
Castiel stood in shock. His baby had kissed him. He couldn’t fully say how he was feeling at that point, all he could say was he felt like he was on cloud nine. Looking into Dean’s bright green eye’s, Castiel smiled, giving his baby kiss on the nose. “I love you baby.”
When the boys nodded lazily Castiel smiled, once he knew they were all comfortable, he turned on the TV putting on a Disney movie.
Dean sucked on his paci looking up at Charlie then to his Daddy, giving a small smile behind his pacifier. He didn’t really know what to do. Charlie seemed nice, but right at that moment it was to much for him, he just wanted to cuddle with his Daddy.  Snuggling into Castiel’s body and holding his bee close, Dean closed his eyes, hoping Daddy would get the hint.
“Mr Novak, I never thought I’d see the main bosses down here, it is a pleasure,” the man said, looked at Michael in amazement he held out his hand.
As they held their boys as they cuddled, Castiel glanced at the doorway to see Michael standing there looking sheepish. Seeing his oldest brother dressed in jeans and t-shirt Castiel smirked at how normal he looked apart from the sad pouting face. He really did look like a kicked puppy.
“Let’s get you out of that wet diaper hmm,” Gabriel said, patting his hand on the white plastic and making it crinkle loader.
“Uncle Cas!” Before she could get close to him and Dean, Hannah grabbed the girl under her arms lifting her up in the air.
“I think Dean doesn't want you apologising Cas,” Gabriel said, coming up next to his little brother.
Castiel stared into Dean’s green eyes, hoping that what he was saying was sinking in. His boy was clearly conflicted in his mind, but he didn’t want to overthink this. “Dean, listen to me baby.” he waited till he knew he had Dean’s attention to continue. “Sweetheart, what has happened has happened and now we move on. If we dwell on things then life will be very boring. Now I know you got angry because Daddy said ‘no more tv’, and I’m guessing because you have not had the chance to experience that, have you?” Dean shakes his head. “Hmm, well baby I will tell you now, Daddy is happy with you watching the tv but you can’t watch it all day, so when I say no more it’s time to do something else. It doesn’t mean I’m taking it away.”
at how happy the little boy was with his finds. Without saying a word Gabriel took the clothes to check they were the right size and placed them with the rest.
Stroking his fingers along Dean’s spine, Castiel smiled when he felt Dean’s skin shiver under his fingertips. Dean hummed at his touch, it felt nice having his back stroked by Daddy’s soft hand.
Smirking to himself Gabriel patted Sam diaper, “You are a big boy Sammy, but some big boys need diapers too, and besides, they just make you look even cuter then you already are.” Tickling behind Sam’s knee, Gabriel laughed when he hears his boy let out a babyish giggle.
“Hey, what’s the matter with my baby boy?” Sitting down on the sofa, Castiel held his arms out for his child. Gabriel lowered the bundle into Castiel’s arms. Finally seeing Deans face, Castiel couldn’t help but smile. Dean was looking up at him with big green watery eyes, his soft smooth pink cheek stood out behind the large blue pacifier bobbing in his small mouth.
Everything inside him was numb, his mind only showing him the image of his baby’s terrified little face, over and over again, like something evil was pressing a rewind button, loving making him relive every tormenting moment. He did know what to think. He knew only one thing, and that was that he was a failure. He failed to protect Dean, his baby was gone and he had done nothing.
“Are you okay Deano?” Seeing Gabriel looking at him with concern, Dean must have been looking uncomfortable. Nodding, he put on a smile, hoping they wouldn’t ask any more questions.
“Dean..I...” Sam tried to talk but crying took over, moving his arms around Dean, he hugged his big brother tightly. He had his Dean back.
“Just checking in. I’m having a meeting with the neighbouring states council to discuss an agreement to let the Bouncers to go and take their homeless. I want you and Castiel to come with me.”
“You did so well Dean. You can dress him now,” Dr Bailey smiled. Patting Dean’s hair, she sat in her chair as Castiel stood up to re-diaper his baby.
“I’m glad. I don’t like my favourite bro and nephew mad at me,” Gabriel said, pouting down at Dean making him giggle around the folk in his mouth.
“What is it?” he asked, taking the file from her. Reading it through he couldn’t stop the sigh leaving his throat. “Castiel has adopted a little with the help of Gabriel.”
“He does, but he needs time Michael,” Seeing his big brother nod, Gabriel smiled with a sigh when he sees Michael smile to himself. He knew his family was hurting, but they’ll be back to normal soon, maybe even better than before.
Dean pouted towards his brother, he was happy his Sammy wasn’t crying anymore, but seeing big sad hazily eyes looking at him made him feel so guilty for telling his little brother off. He hadn’t seen Sam in forever and he’s been mean to him already.
Gabriel stopped tickling his boy and shook his head. His boy was stubborn and he loved it, “Well you might think that, but you’re still a baby to me.” he said, kissing Sam’s forehead. Holding Sam close, Gabriel let Sam cuddle into his chest.
Walking around the toddler aisles all three picked up toys that looked fun. Picking up large blocks like the ones Dean had Gabriel placed them into the cart, he could just see his and Castiel’s little boys happily playing with them together.
“I’m just going to get changed baby, you stay there.” Leaning over, Castiel places a kiss on Dean’s forehead before moving to his wardrobe.
“You’re welcome. I also took the liberty to order some cloths for Samuel, he himself has picked most of them.”
He was just walking home from a night out with Gabriel when he passed the closed church. He heard a loud coughing from the archway. Quietly glancing in he found a shivering young man curled up in a ball in a damp, torn up sleeping bag. Seeing the boy’s face, Castiel felt his heart stop. The boy was beautiful.
Snuggling in close, Dean buried himself into the man’s warmth. Feeling his Daddy tighten his hold around him, Dean hears Castiel lightly hum to him.
“It’ll be fine baby, Daddy won’t be long, he just need to go find something. You can pick whatever you want, within reason. You’ll have fun with uncle Gabe.  Just don’t let him go to crazy okay baby?” Castiel kissed his boy’s cheek before turning to Gabriel. “You look after him and remember you’re looking for toys for Dean, not you Gabriel.”
Dean had stop crying when he noticed Gabriel laying him down onto Daddy’s bed. Blinking back his tears he watched as Gabriel moved Daddy’s pillows down one side of his body. Feeling the bed dip on one side, he turned his head to is Gabriel lay next to him.
“Dean’s in the living room, Sweets.” Turning away from his family, Castiel moved back into the living room.
Gabriel picked up his remote to turn the TV off. “I did. I wanted to get you something so I popped into the company’s warehouse, Michael gave me a key,” he smiled. “While I was there I went on the computer and made an order for your nursery to be set up while we’re out shopping today. It should be all ready for your boy when you get home. I also called Hannah to be at your’s to let the decorators in to your house.”
Hearing a little knock, Castiel turned his head to see Gabriel standing in the doorway. Looking closely he sees his brother with one of the smaller bottles in his hand.
Moving as fast as he could Castiel lifted Dean into his arms. “Shhh..it’s okay baby..oh my bumblebee it’s okay,” Castiel whispered into his baby’s ear as he walked the room swaying trying to calm Dean down.
Oh, Castiel thought. Turning back to the stroller he pushed down the hood. Carefully picking up his baby, Castiel held his naked boy up, causing the blanket to fall.  Seeing Gabriel come back, Castiel held Dean close as he moved to lay him down on the floor.
Soon as he said Sam’s name Castiel could have sworn Dean had stopped breathing. The colour from his baby’s face had completely drained. “Dean honey, Sam is a little.”
“Dean, it’s okay, Daddy’s just wants to change your diaper, then we can go get some breakfast, hmm? How does that sound?”
“Hey….Hey baby,” Castiel smiled, feeling his throat tighten. Looking into Dean’s beautiful green eyes he could see his Dean was back. “I missed you my Bumblebee, you made Daddy worry so, so much.”
“And just so you know, If I wanted a baby girl I would have had one. But I wanted you and you’ll always be my baby boy.”
After an a few hours of non-stop cartoons, Castiel looked down to see his baby lightly dozing agent his chest. Checking his phone again, Gabriel still had not called or text him. He thought his brother would have called by now.
“Are you okay Sammy?” Gabriel asked as he taped a new diaper on. His little boy hadn’t spoke to him since they came up the stairs. Laying on the changing table Sam was looking around the room not paying any attention to the man standing over him. A part of Gabriel kept thinking he must have done something to annoy his baby, but for the life of him he couldn’t think of what it could be.
Walking up the stairs with Dean, Castiel walked along the landing to the door with a blue car shaped sign with Dean’s name painted across it. Dean’s nursery had been put in the room opposite his, which was good for him to get to Dean. Happily, Castiel opened the door.
