“Low blow man.” Dean fakes his offense, placing his hand on the side of his bump for emphasis. They both share a chuckle at that.
Cas pipes up from behind Dean’s shoulder, “Are we sure this is the best course of action? She hasn’t done us much good before.” His grip on the hunter’s shoulder tightening.
Dean huffs, turning to face her with a grunt, “Look we’re not here to sit and chat, okay? I’m on baby lockdown.”
“Thank you Dean...For everything” Is his simple response. But it was enough to make something ignite in the pit of the hunter’s chest.
“Unfortunately, you will be experiencing symptoms of any normal pregnancy, that means that this will last at least another month.” Sam offers weakly, as he peers over his laptop to a now, even grumpier than before Dean.
Dean thinks over it for a moment. Over the last few days, he had felt the need to get everything ready in the bunker. Despite there being no real jobs left to do. The nursery was done, it had been for weeks. Sam had gone out and gotten the needed extra supplies for the baby, like bottles and diapers. But who could blame him? Having a baby is a big deal. And it took him long enough to accept that he was actually pregnant, let alone having to get ready to have one.
Cas bridges the gap between them further with his lips. They’re slow, soft and considerate. Something ignites in the pit of Dean’s stomach. Every time feels like the first time they had kissed, he feels a rush of helplessness, the surging tide of warmth that leaves him limp. If he wasn’t trying so hard to be upright, his legs would buckle, but Dean stays strong. Still encased in the kiss, Cas carefully pushes Dean against the counter. Hungrily, the angel deepens the connection between them, cradling the back of Dean’s head to pull him in closer. Closer. They
If Dean found out his efforts to seek Cas’ help, he can only imagine the strife he’d be in. But, he had researched all the witch lore he could find and none of it suggested that a spell had the power to work after the witch was dead. Let alone a curse that had lasted this long. But maybe something else was happening and Sam just couldn’t find it. God if only Dean talked to him. Or if he could reach Cas.
He had been driving for almost an hour. The sun has started to retreat below the horizon line, causing an orange glow to dance along the black tar of the road. But Dean hadn’t noticed it. Usually, he would revel in the fleeting sunlight, watching closely as its rays hid carefully behind the mountains. But now, he was too wrapped up in his own thoughts. They caused a lump to form in his throat, making it hard to breathe. The low hum of Baby’s engine couldn’t calm him down and neither could Metallica.
Sam throws a cautious glance to Cas as they reach the closed door. Sam opens it first and peers into the doorway, only to be greeted with his sour-faced brother. His nose deep in a book. Sam clears his throat awkwardly to get his attention.
“No. No we didn’t.” He takes a beat, the anger that has been boiling now becoming more prevalent. “Because you stole my memories and you threatened to “tear me apart”. And you made me repeatedly act out Dean Winchester’s murder.” His voice is starting to rise, so he lowers it, stepping closer to her. The two angels now only inches apart, “And you killed many, many people.”
“What Cas? Every time one of your soldiers comes barging in here, I’m just supposed to suck in? Look at me, I look like friggin Juno over here man, come on!” Dean’s voice is raised, but not at Cas.
“Well.” He represses a pained grunt, “Funny story. I wasn’t watching Dr Sexy, well not when I called. I’ve been working a case.” He can sense the bitchface that Sam is giving. Dean waits a beat for a retort or outburst, but worryingly the line is quiet. A silent Sammy is worse than a lecturing one. “A ghost was haunting a shipping warehouse. Was, past tense, cause I ganked the sucker.” The line is forced, the humour obviously falling on deaf ears.
The hunter’s stomach is in knots, he sighs against the touch, “It- it’s -uh- fine Cas always happy to help.” He offers weakly, stuttering.
“Dean.” Cas speaks first, eyes narrow towards the hunter. Dean sighs, standing from his bed, but as he does, his vision swims and he subtly tries to steady himself on the bedside table.
Dean being himself dismisses the comment with a wave of his hand, “Nah Cas it’s alright, you keep watching. I’ve gotta pee.”
That night, although blurry, still flashes harshly in his mind and only made him dizzy when he thought about it. Did he like Cas? Sure, he was Dean’s best friend, and they know each other better than anyone. But the feelings that bloom in his chest when thinking about Cas are.
In the bathroom, he tries to focus on the voices. He still can’t quite make out the second, seemingly more on edge, voice.
“Dean? Are you alright?” Dean doesn’t answer as Cas’ grip loosens and he is free to run to the bathroom. He kneels over the toilet seat and heaves what little food he has had in the last 24 hours. Moments pass and he hears a set of footsteps approaching. The footsteps stop as a figure silently kneels beside him. Cas rubs circles on the small of Dean’s back and hums lowly.
My vision for this fic is constantly shifting and changing, so the tags will probably shift and change to accomodate for that. Just a warning for people who are confused as to why they change/are added on to.
Dean shakes his head, “This is your fault.” His head drooping slightly as he mumbles. Cas only furrows his brow at that.
After another awkward moment, Dean meets with their knowing gazes. He can feel their stares, “Are you two gonna say something or what?”
Before Dean can register what’s going on, his body collides heavily against the opposite wall. Bracing himself, he falls to the ground with a loud thud. A blinding pain grips his stomach, he lets out a surprised gasp. The wind is suddenly knocked from his chest. A blind hand paws at his belly with a wince. The ghost chants and screams, but they are dulled as the swift ache pains him again. His stomach is throbbing, deep cramps coming at him in waves, “Damn it.” Dean lets out a guttural groan as a sharp pain radiates from the base of his stomach.
Sam groans, the newly made tea only doing so much to calm him down. He’s not going to fall asleep with
In his trench of thought, Dean stirs in Cas’ lap. “Ugh.” He grimaces, pressing a hand against his lower back.
The older Winchester huffs, and despite himself takes in a few deep breaths before speaking. “What did you say about a birthing ball?”
“Do you think I’ve got everything?” Cas chirps. Dean pulls his head up and looks over to his angel, fussing about with the suits in his duffle. Well, Dean’s duffle, but he was given permission to borrow it when on hunts. Dean just nods silently with a lopsided smile. Cas creases his brows, noticing his distance from his question, a hand still resting on his bump.
“Yep.” Dean rubs his small bump with a lopsided grin and pulls a chocolate cake out of the fridge. He sets it on the table carefully. After making sure the confectionary is in place, he grabs a fork from one of the drawers. As Sam watches the scene unfold in front of him, he pinches the bridge of his nose and shakes his head. Dean throws him a murderous glance as he points the fork dangerously towards his brother, “If you tell Cas about this, you’re dead.” He then plunges said fork into the middle cake with a childish grin.
A silence falls over the both of them, it has been happening more than Sam would like at the moment. He would have thought that after 8 years of friendship, they could be a little less quiet with one another. Granted the silence isn’t uncomfortable – the both of them just exist in the same room – but it would be nice to talk more often.
“And?” Is the sour reply, not drawing his attention away from looking through the fridge, “I wanted to be comfy today, is that a crime?”
“The- oh god.” Sam pinches the bridge of his nose as he silently regrets this call for help, “So you’re only helping us because there is a spell book involved?”
Dean told Sam about Naomi. But, as promised, not after his massage and restful nap with Cas by his side.
“And if we accept it, is there a price?” Cas pipes up, causing Dean to throw him a death stare. ‘WHAT?’ the older hunter mouths.
The pair settle in to sleep and Dean is on the verge of drifting off when Cas’ voice cuts into the darkness, “Dean.”
Dean walks into the kitchen slowly, the dizziness of his previous battle against his stomach still making his vision swim. Sam squints at the older Winchester brother, he looks pale and clammy as he slowly brews his coffee.
So, the angel found himself at a park in the deep recesses of suburbia. Surrounded by the constant bustle of the everyday human. It served as a background noise or deference to his spiral of doubt and disorientation.
Sam had bristled at the mention of the angel, and a flood of questions were thrown at the two of them. None that Dean could really answer. Cas tried, but his answers didn’t give Sam much confidence. Then, the younger Winchester came up with a solution. He had looked Dean in the eyes, and said, “We could always call Rowena?”
time that day, Dean gets into Baby – thanking God that Sam prefers the other cars in the garage for long trips – and starts his own trip. Lexington is a short 2-hour drive. With one stop for lunch, he will be there by the early afternoon, tracking him to be in the bunker later that night or, at the latest, the following morning. With a simple routine case like this, it doesn’t take much to complete, and she should be good to go.
Sam looks up from his laptop, at the couple opposite him. Cas is reading a baby book titled, “Your Newborn and You.” While Dean looks down at his phone, probably watching dog videos again. Just the other day he was bawling over a particularly cute one.
“Hey, I’ve gotta keep researching this warding. I’ll leave you two to it.” Both Cas and Dean nod in his direction and watch as the younger Winchester leaves.
“Hello Dean.” The angel responds fondly, as he stirs what he’s cooking on the stove. It smells amazing.
The Devil rolls his eyes, “No. This.” He opens his palm and it in unfurls a Talisman. A leather cord with an inscribed metal spherical pendant.
“Heaven is secured. They don’t know the whereabouts of the Nephilim.” The angel triumphs with a smile, which falls quickly as he looks between the Winchester brothers. “I have missed something.” He concludes flatly.
“I gotta take a break,” He leans back his very uncomfortable chair, trying to shift the tension in his lower back, “And a beer.”
Dean pales, his face falling. Sam’s words hang in the thick tension between them. Dean sucks in a breath. His jaw clenching before he opens his mouth to speak. But before he can, he is interrupted by the faint flapping of wings.
“Forget it.” Dean deflates, a hand bracing against his back. “We can figure something out. We always do. For now, though, you owe me a back massage.” Cas beams a smile, “I’ll tell Sam about this after that.”
Cas peppers Dean’s neck with kisses. The urgency of the kisses, making Dean flush with excitement himself. However exciting, it doesn’t override his exhaustion. He grabs Cas’ hand and kisses his knuckles one by one.
“Not anything new, or at least what Cas hadn’t already told us.” Sam starts factually, not looking away from his notes, “However, there was one thing that some archaic lore described as a ‘soul bond’. “For a Nephilim to be conceived an intricate bond must be formed between the human and their angelic counterpart”.” Sam reads aloud. He tears away his gaze away from the pages and looks up to Cas touching Dean’s shoulder delicately. “Which I guess you two are already mending.” He mumbles under his breath.
while out with Cas. The returning panic from before rises in his chest. Cas, picking up on the discomfort,  quickly notices the hardening of Dean’s features and comes up behind him. A warm hand soothes over the hunter’s shoulder, causing him to melt at his touch.
“I think I got hexed or something when we took down that coven a couple of weeks ago.” Dean replies, not looking away from his coffee as it brews.
Dean lets out a small chuckle at that, Sam continues, “You are going to be ten times better than dad. You know why?” Dean shakes his head hesitantly, “Because you have been the best parent for me my whole life. You just need to stop getting in your head about hunting. Read a book or learn to knit, I don’t know. But, you can’t go on a rampage while you’re the size of a house-“
we had a falling out.” Cas states factually, his thumb now rubbing harder at the tensing of Dean’s shoulder.
adjusting to the hormonal changes of this pregnancy as evidenced in the tenderness.” Cas states factually, “It’s completely normal at this stage-“
Cas lowers his hand to Dean’s abdomen; it begins to emit the same yellow light as yesterday. Cas screws his eyes closed and focuses on the angelic soul. The same blinding light greets his gaze, the vague form of the Nephilim making themselves known. After searching for a few more seconds, he hears it.
A figure, who looks all too familiar, has his back to Sam obscuring the true view of who it is. The younger Winchester takes a few steps towards the entrance, still trying to keep his distance. The figure turns around, clearly taking notice to the shifting behind him. Sam’s jaw tightens. The figure's eyes flash red before crinkling into a knowing glare.
“Sam said I was nesting today when he came over.” Dean voices quietly into their shared silence. This makes Cas quirk a brow. “I was totally not nesting.” He has to add to his statement - the classic Dean ‘I’m totally a macho man’ Winchester tone creeping into his voice.
“Yeah, I’m starting to think so too.” He hunter tenses, a thought dawning on him, “But I’m way too early, right? The kid isn’t due for
“Yes. That is common.” Cas nods, “It will hopefully ease over time. This will all become easier. I promise.”
“Dean.” Cas steps towards him, his right hand stretches forward, ready to hold Dean’s arm and try to reason with the hunter. But Dean doesn’t want the contact. He doesn’t think before he reacts. On instinct he recoils from the touch and throws Cas a glare. The angel looks hurt, but pauses himself, a pained look in his eyes.
“What do you mean?” Dean snaps, “Like I said, I’m peachy.” He plasters a fake smile for good measure.
Dean falls into a deep, snoring sleep quickly after that. Feeling hot with Cas’ warmth and his bump, he has shifted away from the angel’s embrace. Still alighted with excitement, Cas looks over at his sleeping form, watching his lover’s chest rise and fall with sleep. Their child is healthy, wriggling safely in Dean’s false womb.
Cas nods in understanding, but his face never changes, “To partake in sexual intercourse, one must be undressed Dean. You of all people should know.” His tone is measured and factual, as usual, but it still leaves Dean’s jaw slacked. Too many thoughts run through his head. Why is Cas so calm? They – did he just?
Unpacking doesn’t take long. Cas releases Dean, leaving his back feelings cold at the sudden absence of body heat. They face one another, Cas beaming with a sweet smile that spreads to Dean’s face.
Cas calculates Lucifer, his face falling into its signature squint. Normally, the familiar look would cause Dean to hold back a smile. But Cas is thinking about something. Probably nothing good. “So, this “insurance”-“
Later, Sam storms into Dean and Cas’ room, his eyes landing on the two of them in bed. Dean leaning with back against Cas’ chest eyes closed. While Cas rubs circles on Dean’s bare abdomen. At the shift in the room, Dean’s eyes fly open.
4 weeks of Dean avoiding any questions relating to the morning that Cas left. 4 weeks of Sam worrying over where Cas is and Dean seeming to become more and more distant because of it.
“Just a little dizzy.” Dean breathes. The air around him tightens, he inhales sharply before squinting his eyes shut. His grip loosens on the table, and his weight is thrown onto Cas who catches him with gentle hands.
Still sitting on the bed, Dean glances down to his exposed stomach. His shirt is folded to sit just above the swell. The bump is small - it could be explained as a bloat or a minor beer gut -  as it peeks over the waistband of his boxers. But it’s still
Sam’s knuckles whiten on the handle of his gun, resisting the urge to shoot. Lucifer’s an Archangel sure, a bullet would only cause a flesh wound. But God does he want to lodge a bullet in that son of a bitch’s skull. Lucifer stays still, as Sam’s mind rushes with questions, too many to materialise in his mouth.
The younger hunter then holds back a yawn, “Alright, I am going to get my 4 hours. Do whatever you want but meet me back here in the morning.” Cas nods.
God, Dean is really in deeper than he ever thought he would be. Not that getting pregnant with his and Cas’ kid was ever on his bucket list.
Lucifer shrugs, “Call it a little insurance. Anyone worth anything wants a favour owed from the Winchesters, call me greedy, but I want one too. So, take the talisman and owe me one.” He turns to face Dean, “Or don’t and have Heaven’s robots hunt you and your little monster down for all eternity. And I saw what they did to the Nephilim a millennium ago and trust me pal it aint pretty.”
Sam freezes. Dean stops dead in his tracks and meets Sam’s gaze with a wild look. He’s wearing nothing but boxers, bedhead, and a scattering of fresh, red hickeys. A lax hand is resting on top of the, very noticeable curve of his stomach.
“Sammy! Finally, I thought that the welcome party was never going to come.”  Lucifer cracks coy smile.
Dean stands for a minute, temporarily distracted by the mess of research scattered over the table. His brows crease as his eyes trace over the mountain of work. “And you’re sure that this thing is a wisp?” He cuts into the silence.
“I gotta tap a kidney first and then I’ll help. Kid’s jacking up my bladder.” Dean grumbles, getting up with a wince.  Sam cringes in sympathy as he watches his brother walk – well, it’s evolving into a heavy plod - out the entrance. “Don’t have too much fun without me!” He calls out behind him.
“Hello?” A voice booms from the entrance of the bunker, stopping Sam in his tracks. The voice too eerily familiar for his comfort. He stays silent in the hallway for a moment, clutching at the gun in his back pocket. Dean and Cas continue to talk, their quiet chattering undisturbed. Sam slinks around the corner and peeks into the main entrance. The cool metal of his pistol melds with his grip.
Lazily throwing on his t-shirt, boxers and pants, that were thrown on the floor, his mind races. Automatically his hands rake through his hair as he tries to piece together what
Sam’s brows cease, “Anyway, we were wondering if we could have a look at the husbands’ bodies? The registrar at the morgue said we needed to be approved first, since this isn’t our jurisdiction.” The rehearsed lines made going undercover that much easier. Sam could lie his heart out and get away with anything.
. Thank you, Cas.” He says, greedily taking the popcorn and ketchup. Sam cringes as he watches Dean squirt the condiment liberally into the bowl.
“Yeah, I’m going to work on that one. I think Dean needs rest first though.” Sam chuckles as he looks to his brother. Dean’s relaxed body slumps slightly against the back of the chair, eyes drawled with tiredness.
“I enjoy watching you.” He says, practically growling in Dean’s ear. Dean fumbles with the chip packet in his hands and almost drops the bag.
“Most of these are nutrient-based snacks,” Sam reports, “but I also grabbed some vitamins, iron supplements and calcium tablets.” The younger Winchester proudly places them out on the counter for his paling brother.
The spell doesn’t take too long with Sam helping and the large array of supplies on offer in the bunker.
“Missed you.” Dean mumbles and wraps his arms around Cas’ waist. He stops as he can’t push against him all the way. The small swell of their baby is blocking them. The hunter frowns down at his stomach, “Hey.”
After shucking off his sweats and shirt, Dean eases himself onto the bed slowly. He settles on his side – the only comfortable position now - and almost instantly, he can feel his whole body relax. Dean’s memory foam mattress was definitely calling his name.
There is a silence between the three of them. Dean’s gaze darts anywhere but their conversation, that familiar, heavy guilt returning. They had talked it over and gotten past it on the drive. What happened is in the past, but his heart still aches that he had hurt Cas.
“No dude,” Sam chuckles, “A water birth is when you can choose to labour or deliver in a bath or inflatable pool. You can choose to labour in the water and then deliver outside of it, or just do the whole thing while in there. The hot water is meant to be relaxing.” He says, like this is the most normal conversation to have between three men.
“There was nothing out of the ordinary on those bodies Dean. I’m telling you; this might be a cross-roads demon collecting souls.” Sam rakes a hand through hair, pushing it back from his eyes.
That comment takes Cas by surprise. He considers Dean for a moment as they gaze into each other’s eyes. He calculates Dean’s calmed features. He isn’t cowering away or defending himself. He holds an honest sincerity that catches Cas for a loop. The angel cocks his head to the side, prompting Dean to warm into a genuine smile. One that Cas hasn’t seen in what feels like a millennium.
Dean pulls Sam aside before he can walk away. Glaring him down, “I’m not going to be babysat by the wicked witch of the west.” He says through clenched teeth.
Sam pinches the bridge of his nose, “Yeah. That.” He sighs, “Because Cas pulled you up from hell, you already have one. Thus, it was so easy to -uh-
We're getting close to the end! The next chapter will be the long awaited arrival of the baby, so this one is short filler in the meantime. Thank you all so much for the support on this fic!
What Dean doesn’t see as he storms off is Cas following after him. The angel taking a few steps before a gentle hand falls on his shoulder, “Don’t” Sam chokes. Cas closes his eyes and nods, listening as Dean storms out to the garage.
“Did you find anything worth reporting?” Dean breaks the tense silence that had fallen upon the three of them.
Which is a good and somewhat disappointing sign. It is dark and an arm is snaked around his waist, holding him close. After recognising it, he relaxes into the familiar warmth. Cas’ arms are protective over him, a lax hand rests against his chest and their ankles are locked together.
Dean shakes off the haze he hadn’t realized he lulled into. He knew Cas said something, but he didn’t catch it, “Huh?”
The younger Winchester can sense the heavy tone behind his voice, “Well, at least you’ll be able to help me sift through these books now that you’re back?” He flashes those infamous puppy dog eyes, which only earns a deep groan.
The title of this chapter is a reference to the bible verse where *ahem* gabriel comes to mary bearing good news...take with that what you will.
“It takes pretty damn good too.” Dean muses, after taking a spoonful to his lips. Sam shakes his head with a small chuckle. “But -uh- what kinda case are you looking at?”
Cas strides into the room, holding two bowls of popcorn and a bottle of ketchup, “I have acquired the snacks for tonight.” He announces, handing one bowl of popcorn to Sam.
Air. Dean needs air. But right now, that is the last thing he wants to think about. Cas’s mouth is too good, too soft, too warm. He can’t get enough. Both his hands fly to Cas’ cheeks, interlocking them together. He thumbs Cas' stumble and deepens their connection.
“Of course! You’ve got such precious cargo on board!” She moves towards Dean, cooing at his belly, he steps back jaw tightening.
Satisfied with his creation, Dean plants himself in front of Sam. “If you must know, I felt like some yogurt.” He flashes a fake smile, “With peanut butter and banana.”
Dean waves off the hand with apprehension, “I’m peachy.” He chuckles, that joy returning in his eyes, “Let’s go check in with Sam.”
“My reliable sources have told me of your occasional visits back. So, you were obviously aware. But, we have yet to find a connection to track down the Nephilim’s presence. All of heaven’s limited staff have been on high alert-”
Dean perks up more at that, his sore eyes squinting at the screen briefly, “Sounds pretty witchy.” He reasons, nodding his head.
“I guessed that.” Dean chuckles, looking at it as well. He then looks out to them again, “This is- wow, it’s amazing. I love it.”
“Well, you can plan it to a degree,” Sam elaborates, “It’s really just meant for me and Cas to figure out how you’d like to do it. Like who you want there with you, the pain relief you’d like and where you want to do it.” He sounds chillingly clinical. Like he’s actually
He clears his throat, “Like I said at the beginning of the pregnancy, when angelic grace is involved the gender of the carrier doesn’t matter-“
“I always am with you around.” And with that, Cas places a light kiss to Dean’s lips, making him blush.
“I understand that this situation has been very stressful Dean.” Cas replies, a soft look about his face. His hand cups Dean’s cheek, “But you’re handing all of this incredibly well. You’re so strong.”
“I’m turning into Dad.” Dean concludes solemnly, breaking the blanketing silence. Sam tips his head in confusion, brows creasing. Dean shakes his head, “I went on a hunt instead of thinking of my kid.”
“Is that why you left?” Sam suddenly says, his words falling quickly from his lips, “Because of Dean?”
“Oh dear Dean, there a whole lot of crap those books won’t tell you.” He inspects the talisman in his hand, rolling the pendant between his fingers, “Hell, I don’t even know some of these Sigils. Call them… Biblical.”
Cas stops his humming as soon as he hears Dean’s voice. A flash of panic crosses his face at the interruption before it’s replaced with a slight frown. Sometimes Dean wonders if concern is Cas’ default expression now.
“No.” Dean pales again and kneels over the toilet seat. Cas nods in understanding, as he only vomits bile. Once the hunter is finished, he rests his head against the cool porcelain. “This is terrible. I’ve officially thrown up everything I’ve ever eaten since 2005.”
“Hey Dean.” Sam scoffs, not looking up, “I thought you’d never get up. It’s almost 10.” He lets out a chuckle.
Sam’s contact lights up on Dean’s cracked cell. At some point, between being thrown against the wall and crawling halfway across the room his cell had flown out of his pocket. Thankfully, it’s still working, or he’d really be screwed. Guilt and embarrassment rise to suffocate him, making it hard to pant through the stabbing cramps wracking his stomach. He lets the phone ring, too weak to reach out and pick up his cell. Hot tears fall down his cheeks as he lets out a loud groan.
“Also you did great with interviewing the spouses today.” Sam suddenly pipes up, causing the angel to fight his blush at the compliment.
Dean turns his head to look at Cas, only to find the angel staring back at him. He had hoped to see something in Cas’ eyes, anything, that could tell him he wasn’t serious; that what he had said was a joke or prank or something. Anything. But instead he finds a guilt and panic in Cas’ eyes, outright fear that doesn’t suit his features. The sincerity of those emotions on the angel’s face should be confirmation enough, but it isn’t. It couldn’t be happening. This is crazy, too surreal even for the Winchesters. The words ache in his head, and he sits silently in disbelief.
Cas is done with this conversation, “I will not partake in this fruitless effort to purify the reputation of a corrupted Heaven.” He takes a beat, “You should leave.” The cool metal of his angel blade materialises in his palm. He hides it beneath his trenchcoat.
Rowena perks up, “Only if I can take the black grimoire home with me?” She reasons, a devilish grin warming to her face.
Waving him off, she lets out a light chuckle, “Lord no. His belongings were thrown out years ago. I didn’t want to keep his musty old things. Sorry deary.” Smiling sweetly, she places a gentle hand to Dean’s bicep. He flashes a fake smile in response.
Sam sets himself comfortably on his recliner in the ‘Dean cave’. While Dean props himself up on the larger couch beside him. Once Dean got too big for his own recliner, they opted to get a bigger option, much to the hunter’s chagrin. But it turns out it’s better for him and Cas to cuddle on together anyway.
Dean’s brain takes a few seconds to catch up, “So, this is the kid’s way of telling me it’s almost time? I could have told you that myself. Much less painfully.” He lays a hand on his bump, scolding his unborn child.
Cas and Dean come back to the bunker and are met with Sam researching. He isn't bearing good news, but sometimes bad news can lead to something ultimately good.
“But you felt it Cas.” Dean interjects quickly, his voice cracking unexpectedly, “You felt ‘em. And you
Cas breaks his gaze with Dean and turns to Sam with a measured expression, “It’s not impossible.” The two brothers just look to him, dumbfounded, “The humans that bore Nephilim a millennia ago were both male and female. Your body makes no difference when angelic grace is involved-“
Sam nods and promptly heads out of the room, noticing the longing looks being exchanged, “I’m gonna go check on where Rowena’s at.” He adds weakly as he walks out the door.
Two hunters and an angel try to comprehend the immaculate conception of the Nephilim. It all seems too much for Dean, until things turn out better than he thought.
Dean smiles weakly shaking his head, “I’m always tired.” He sighs, “I’ve just been doing laundry all morning.”
“I’m gonna puke.” Dean says weakly, gesturing for the trash can. Cas nods and quickly hands the metal trash can over to Dean. He takes it slowly in his hands before throwing up what bile is left from his previous run in with the toilet that morning.
And at the harsh words, Lucifer disappears. In his wake, the faint Whoosh of his wings. Dean gazes down at the talisman in his palm. He lifts it over his head, the pendant sitting at his sternum. Dean examines the various Sigils and symbols inscribed on the cool metal sphere. His fingers trace along the raised surface. Some of the symbols he can recognise, but others he's never seen before. Cas leans into Dean, his eyes landing on the talisman as well.
“Agent. I think we better get a move on to the morgue.” Sam quickly interjects, clapping Cas’ back. “Thank you so much for your time Sheriff.” The two of them get up from their chairs. The sheriff nods them off. “And congratulations by the way!” He calls out awkwardly over his shoulder.
Dean never knows how long he is hunched over the porcelain. It feels like an eternity. His skin has grown clammy, breath shallow and his face has lost all colour. Cas just sits silently beside him, rubbing and patting his back slowly. Dean lifts his head, and he meets with the angel. Cas looks adorable, wearing one of Dean’s baggy old band shirts with his hair tossed with sleep.
“Yeah I guess that wouldn’t be good,” Dean jokes, “I’m already on thin ice with him about all this.” He gestures to his stomach vaguely.
Deciding against trying to squeeze into more of his jeans; Dean slips into an old pair of sweatpants. They look ridiculous with his flannel and undershirt, but they’re comfortable.
His eyes are washed with an uncharacteristic serene. But his mouth his pressed into a firm line. He looks calmed. Shoulders relaxed and posture slouches only slightly. Dean searches for any clues on the angel’s face but finds nothing.
“I was wondering when you two would emerge.” Sam smirks over his laptop, but his coy demeanour dampens as he sees Dean’s pale face. “You alright?”
“It’s impossible!” Sam blurts out, breaking the heavy silence that had fallen between the three of them,  “You two- dean – he’s a guy!” He throws wild gestures between them.
“What Sam?” He snaps, putting down the book he was reading on Ancient Witchcraft and Wiccan Ritual, “I’m fine, I don’t need-“
“A lot of things apparently Cas, but you’re my best friend man. I never thought that-“ Dean’s throat suddenly feels tight and his head starts to spin. He wets his lips and continues, “I can’t believe we did that. This is all too much.” He speaks his mind out loud, his hands going to rake through his hair again.
“I’ve been researching a case.” Sam replies as Dean carefully slices his banana. The younger Winchester squints, “What are you making?”
“We are willing to give you a favour, in return for the talisman.” Cas announces, his hand already raising to meet with the necklace.
“How about, you get him over here and I’ll give it to him myself huh?” Lucifer’s gives a knowing look that urges the hunter to move.
About an hour in, Dean’s phone buzzes on his centre console. Checking the road is clear, he picks it up and brings it to his ear.
This chapter is kind of like my take on 12x11 'Regarding Dean', i took a bit of inspiration from the episode in regards to Rowena's and Dean's relationship and to the vague "plot" of this chapter.
“Anger isn’t good for the baby Dean; you should know that.” He quickly interjects, gesturing to Dean stomach. The action only fuelling his rage. Dean’s nostrils flare and Cas stares daggers. Lucifer puts his hands up in defence, “Woah there, I come in peace. I don’t want to hurt the offspring of Heaven’s finest failure-“
“No.” Sam sterns, “Hunting is too dangerous! I don’t want to put you in harm’s way.” Frustration is clearly boiling to the surface. “You can’t just be the reckless hunter you used to be. There is another person you need to think about. Not just yourself.” The words fall out of his mouth before he realises they’ve been said. Guilt grips at his chest. His tone was hard and laced with sincerity.
Dean slowly walks back into the kitchen and is met with a confused Sam, “What was that about? Where’s Cas?”
The younger Winchester pales at that. Lucifer is an archangel, of course he heard it over angel radio. But they don’t know who the Nephilim’s parents are. Not yet. So how the hell does he know?
Fear bests him as Sam calls for the second time. It takes everything to will his aching body to move. A panic ebbs as he reaches his phone and picks it up.
Now that they are warded against heaven, life can resume to some semblance of normal. Dean has to adjust to not being able to hunt, and to the changes happening to him.
Still in shock, Dean wets his lips slowly, “uh- divine intervention?” He rasps, going pale at the thought.
pregnant there man.” He says, gesturing a pen towards Dean’s growing stomach. Dean narrows his eyes dangerously.
“Come on!” Dean quickly interrupts, “I’m getting cagey in here man. If I have to stay cooped up in this bunker any longer so help me-”
Not letting either of them help him up, he struggles a little to his feet. Swaying as he stands upright, before finding his balance and plodding his way towards the door. Grumbling some profanity under his breath, he crosses the room. As he gets to the door, he stands there for a moment and looks to Cas. He lets out a guttural sound resembling something of a groan, “You comin’ Cas?”
“Peaceful?” Dean repeats, his voice raising, “You think that pushing out your fat kid’s head for hours on end is going to be peaceful?!” The urge to run away from this embarrassing and frankly enraging conversation is almost too much to handle. Almost, being the key word. Because if Dean wasn’t the size of a house with swollen feet and a backache, he’d already be storming off.
They share an awkward beat of silence before Sam continues, “Thank you for coming to take a look at Dean. I -uh- know you’ve busy doing whatever angelic crap needs doing.” His ramblings are quick again, and gauging by Cas’ furrowed brow, he slows himself down, “I’m worried about how sick Dean has been this past month. When he’s not throwing up, he’s mostly in his room.” At that Sam holds a heavy tone.
“I’m glad.” Cas’ sincerity makes Dean’s stomach drop a little. The same sinking feeling when he would sneak out at night and John would ask questions about where he had been. His cheeks flush hot before Cas speaks again, “What are you doing?”
While Sam mumbles his awkward one-sided conversation, Dean turns to look over at Cas, a small grin playing at his lips. Cas looks nervous, his eyes a little wilder than usual.
“The same coffee we always get?” Sam says slowly, Dean squints at him, confused. Sam’s mind races with questions, his confusion boils into a mild annoyance, “Wait you’ve felt sick? And you didn’t tell me?”
Dean nods him off and turns to face Cas. The angel still wears his warm grin. Dean closes the space between them with a kiss, it’s quick. Cas letting out a low whine when he pulls away.
Dean sighs happily at that, but still his mind is in a crazy whirlwind of thought. Both Cas and Sam seem to be adjusting pretty well to the idea of
Dean walks far enough away from the kitchen that he is sure that Sam can’t hear the two of them. His hands bawl into tight fists and he pants, trying to conjure the words. Cas’ eyes squint, calculating.
Dean turns to the coffee machine again and yep, no coffee ground left. He grumbles something under his breath and sits heavily down at the map table opposite Sam. His head falls into his hands. Sam just shakes his head and returns to his laptop. A nagging question sits behind his lips, but he chooses to bite it back, Dean doesn’t seem in the mood to talk.
While Sam is milling about in the kitchen, Dean is hunched over the cool porcelain of the toilet seat, like he has been for the past 3 mornings. He doesn’t know how long he’s been there; his skin has become clammy, and hair has slicked against his forehead with sweat. He woke with a start this morning, the burning feeling of bile rising in his throat as he stirred, making him run to the bathroom.
There is something about the way Cas beams down at his stomach, his cheeks flushed with excitement, even in the dim light, that makes Dean melt. “Yes. I felt our child moving.” Is the factual confirmation. The angel’s voice is hushed as if not to disturb the peace.
“Of course, guys -uh- take your time.” Sam nods awkwardly, ducking out of the room. “I definitely should’ve knocked.” He scolds himself as he walks out to the entrance.
When comfortably positioned on the bed. Cas looks over Dean, finding nothing out of the ordinary, he turns to Rowena. After being asked some rather embarrassing questions, the witch chuckles lowly, making Dean’s eyes grow wide.
“What are you upset about?” The angel leans in cautiously – Dean looks like he's 2 seconds away from going nuclear.
And with that, the phone goes dead. He and Cas aren’t really the type of couple to talk over the phone for hours on end. Before everything happened, phone calls were only in the case of emergency. His partner is an angel for God’s sake. When you’ve got someone who can fly, you don’t need to be using up your minutes.
“Good news, not a demon. Bad news it’s a vengeful poltergeist!” Sam pants quickly, ducking as the therapist’s vase is thrown past his head.
He dramatically quirks a brow, “Well you see, I didn’t hear wrong.” His tone is cold, “Archangels have pretty good ears when it comes to this sort of stuff.” He breaks into a beaming smile and looks around the entrance of the bunker, “So, where is the mommy-to-be huh? I’ve even brought a gift for the baby shower!”
His body reacts before he can, and he bridges the small gap between them with a kiss. It takes Cas by surprise at first, but he quickly melts into Dean, his hands going to the hunter’s cheeks. Dean is surprised by how welcoming the kiss is, it is familiar – he guesses from his previous drunken run with the angel.
Sam huffs, loosening his grip on Rowena’s shoulder, “You and Rowena will stay back here. I can’t have you put in danger.” He faces Rowena again, his eyes narrowing, “Or, Rowena running off.”
Dean is only getting closer to his due date, meaning that their Winchester luck is kicking back in with a vengeance. But first, a pregnant Dean has to have a few cute moments.
“1 minute and 9 seconds.” Cas reports robotically. “However, you have been coming in and out of consciousness since then.” Sam nods mutely.
Dean swallows his guilt and continues driving, there is less than an hour left of the trip. This hunt will be quick – just something for him to do so he doesn’t go crazy. Yeah, it’ll be fine.
“Because we already share a profound bond Dean.” Cas pipes up, his warm smile still present on his features. Seeing Cas smile as much as he is, makes Dean’s heart skip.
Dean, choosing to sleep instead of going on their little adventure, wakes two hours later, to the sound of Sam and Cas walking through the hallway. He groggily gets up, and heads into the kitchen, following after them.
Cas leans forward and places a gentle hand over Dean’s abdomen. His fingers trace light patterns over its surface, “You and the baby both need rest, and you know it. I can join you if you want?”
Sam sits at the map table in the kitchen with his phone by his side, Cas’ number glowing on the screen. He had called him countless times in the past month, every one of them going to voicemail. Something was going on, but Sam couldn’t voice this without getting his head bitten off or Dean retreating to his room in a huff.
Dean wakes with a start and carefully surveys his surroundings. He feels groggy, his mind in fragments as he starts to focus on where he is. His stomach feels off, it churns unhappily as he begins to fully wake up. He is in his own room.
“We were given false information!” Naomi lets out a mirthless laugh, “This Nephilim will ruin the balance of this world. The mere existence of this child could rupture Heaven and Earth!”
Later, satisfied that his work is done, Dean waddles to the kitchen. Cas is humming something that he can hear from down the hallway. He never usually hums unless he thinks no one is listening. Dean thinks its adorable.
Cas nods from behind Dean and attempts shifts the hunter to a more upright position. The action only earning a groan, “Thank you for notifying us Sam. We’ll be out in a minute.”
“No, it’s my fault that I almost did more damage than a bit of stress. You deserve to go on hunts with Sammy. Someone has to cover for me God- Ah-“  Dean winces and curls over his bump.
Sam now paces the library, his phone held firmly in his right hand while his left rakes the hair out of his eyes, “How should I tell her?”
Sam can’t help but smile at the weird family that they’ve become. With Dean so close to his due date, it won’t just be the three of them soon. They will have a baby to look after. Sam can picture a little version of both Dean and Cas running wildly around the bunker. Although, they haven’t found out the gender of the child, Sam hopes it’s a little girl. Then they would really have the whole ‘three men and a baby’ vibe going on. But, whatever those two dorks have he’ll be happy. Happy to be an uncle to his niece or nephew and definitely spoil them rotten.
“Well, at least you’re keeping yourself occupied. Thank you for letting me on this case, I know it’s difficult for you, but I think that if I hunt a bit now then there is less to do later.” There’s that pang of guilt again, it’s sharp and stabs Dean right in the chest. Cas sounds so hopeful and sweet. Hunting has helped him feel more useful around the bunker, given him a purpose outside protecting Dean. And yet, Dean is being selfish and going out on a hunt by himself and lying about it.
The phone rings three times, “Hello Sam.” A sour tone answers. Cas. Sam’s eyes widen, but he focuses on Cas’ voice. He sounds mildly annoyed, or bored? Sam really can’t tell.
The bed sheets have been strewn away on the empty side of the bed. His mind fragments as he tries to remember how he got here. The previous night flashes harshly behind his eyes; talking with Sam, way too much booze and Cas. His bright blue eyes glazed with lust and desire sear into Dean’s memory, and he sits straight up in the empty bed, despite the protest of his aching body.
Cas finally wills himself closer to her cautiously. Each step taking a monumental effort. Her gaze seems to be boring deeply into him. Like she can see right through his grace. As if she can
it.” Tears threaten to spill, but Dean holds them expertly back, “All I get is to puke everything I’ve ever eaten and sleep for a week.” He adds quietly, pulling his hand away and darting his gaze away.
The two of them leave the bathroom (after Dean has brushed his teeth and cleaned up a little more) and head for the kitchen.
Dean looks to Sam, hoping that his Stanford-educated brother finally has some sense knocked into him.
They enter the bunker’s library – Sam had texted them he’d be there – and they meet with a pile of books and papers scattered across the table. There are so many, barely any table is showing, causing Dean to quirk a brow.
Dean picks up after 2 rings, sounding gruff, did he just wake up? “Sammy? Are you alright?” Dean hears Cas’s yell and something smash in the background. “What the hell is going on?!”
“A list of preferences that you would like established before you go into labour to keep you comfortable. Likely, when labour starts, you’ll be distracted, and your attention will be otherwise occupied.” Cas says casually, without looking up from his book. He then sets it down and faces Sam, “And I believe we haven’t talked about it yet, but now would probably be an appropriate time.”
He exhales angrily, his palms scrubbing across his face. Sighing in defeat, he looks over to his clock. 2:15am. Great. Sitting up slowly - his body creaking with the movement - Sam stretches and heads for the kitchen. Maybe some tea will help.
Thankfully, Sam’s patience with Dean has grown tenfold to preserve him from getting another split lip, “I know Dean, but I’ve looked through every piece of information on angel lore, warding material and masking spells in the bunker and I can’t find anything that’ll help us.” He lowers his voice slightly, carefully gauging the response his older brother will give.
The atmosphere is disturbed as a quiet ‘whoosh’ comes from beside him. Cas knits his brows, eyes softening as he lowers to Dean’s level. His hands are firm against Dean’s shoulder, “Dean.” His tone is surprisingly gentle. Dean can’t look at him, shame weighs his gaze to the dull floor. He winces, biting back a groan as the pain once again creeps up his back and to his stomach.
Cas perches his head on Dean shoulder, trying to grow closer, “Be patient.” His voice is small. Dean’s eyes travel down to his stomach, against which Cas holds his palm, fingers stretched wide to cover as much surface area as possible. They wait, the sleepy hunter growing more impatient. After a few seconds, there is an undeniable flutter beneath Cas’ fingertips. The definite wriggle of life.
“And THAT is another thing.” Sam starts, but his mind is racing too fast for any words to come forward. He just looks between Cas and Dean hopelessly.
“As long as I am, I want no judgement for this absolute masterpiece.” He declares, making a disturbing sound of pleasure as he shovels a handful into his mouth.
No matter how many times that word echoes inside Dean’s head it seems to be devoid of meaning. He can’t even begin to comprehend it.
Dean plasters on a dumb smile and playfully taps Sam’s arm, “So it’s sounding like a simple salt and burn case that I could-“
Rowena and Dean have been sitting in silence for the past twenty minutes. In that time Dean has been plotting the witch’s slow, painful death in his head.
“Mostly.” Dean replies simply, his attention focusing on a stray book page. It wasn’t entirely true, some things still set him off but that is an improvement to puking his guts out at the drop of a hat. He promptly changes the topic, “So, so far we’ve found nothing?”
“Hey.” Dean frowns, “He’s -uh - getting more groceries. We ran out of pie.” A red tint dances across his cheeks as he darts his eyes away from their conversation.
“Are you okay Sammy? A vengeful poltergeist aint a walk in the park.” Dean’s big brother instincts are kicking into high gear. Sam waves him off with a smile.
“I’m fine man. We’ve dealt with worse.” Sam shares a look with Cas. The angel then settles his gaze on Dean, beaming. They walk quickly down the stairs, Sam brushing past Dean.
The angel practically runs down the bunker’s steps. Sam follows slowly behind with a grin. Cas, holding Dean’s duffle carefully in his hands, peers into their room. It’s empty. He furrows his brows slightly but sets down his duffle anyway. Cas walks out into the hallway and meets with Sam’s wide eyes.
“If you’d like, we could go to bed? I can give you a massage.” Cas’ tone is a little disappointed, considering that would mean watching the movie another day.
Sam and Cas arrive back to the bunker in record time. Sam sporting the start of a bruise on his cheek. While Cas tends to Dean, Sam looks through the black grimoire with Rowena. The two of them collect the ingredients required for the spell and get to work.
The following morning is spent slowly as Dean helps Cas pack for the next hunt that he and Sam are going on. They are leaving in a couple of hours, because apparently the two of them are becoming Turner & Hooch - much to Dean’s annoyance. The case is also a little further away, a day’s drive to Burr Oak, Michigan. Meaning that Dean will have to be stuck in the bunker alone again for just shy of a week. That thought makes him want to scream, or cry, or hit something. But all he can do is encourage Cas and be supportive.
Cas hangs up the phone and looks longingly out to the playground, he can’t keep his distance any longer.
He hadn’t known how long he stayed stationary at the park, watching as days fled into nights. Time is felt differently when one’s purpose is shifted.
Dean shakes his head and looks to Cas, “I don’t need space, I – just – I don’t know maybe a guide book?” A sour tone starts to creep up in his voice, but he fights it back and sighs heavily, “Just tired is all. Like I always am.” He adds with a groan and lifts his head. Meeting with a sympathetic smile from Sam.
“Cut the crap Dean!” Sam’s sudden outburst startles Dean. He winces and cowers back, feeling Sam’s gaze bore into him, “I have tried to help you these past couple of weeks, but you refused help. So, I finally got Cas.” The air becomes stale around his words as all eyes are on the younger hunter, he turns to Cas, “Can you check him over?”
The angel shakes his head. Reasoning with a hormonal, stubborn hunter will get him nowhere. He looks to Sam, “Sam, I will work the case with you.” Dean squirms under the stare thrown his way, “Dean, I want you to stay here until we get back. We can shop together when I return.”
“It’s been a month Sam and we haven’t found anything!” Dean’s anger bubbles to the surface uncontrollably as he paces the bunker’s library.
“Lucifer was right, these Sigils and wardings are of ancient decent.” Cas reports, “if anything were to ward off Heaven directly, it would be these.”
“Tombstone!” Dean declares, grabbing the remote from beside him, “Because it is a crime that my baby daddy has never seen it.” He adds, again turning Sam off his popcorn.
Dean wakes with a start. His eyes shooting open as his hunter instincts send a strong twinge of adrenaline down his spine. A headache begins to cluster behind his eyes as they strain to recognise his surroundings. The room is familiar, but it isn’t his. In the dim light, Dean can make out the dull furnishings of one of the Men Of Letters bunker rooms, devoid of his own personal touches. He stays still, not daring to move as a groggy feeling starts to creep up on his sore muscles. His
The room falls silent. The two hunters and an angel of the lord staring blankly at the Devil. Dean and Cas wordlessly glance at one another, sharing concerned looks. While Sam stares at the talisman, swinging precariously in Lucifer’s hand.
Cas is left speechless. They both stand in the hallway, staring into one another’s eyes intensely. Dean’s mind separates from him. He can’t catch a single one of the flying thoughts that reel through his head. It’s like he is looking at a conversation unfold between two strangers. But it’s not two strangers. He and Cas had sex. And he wasn’t sober enough to stop it. Hell, Cas said he
“Are you alright?” The question hangs in the air between them for a moment before Dean pinches the bridge of his nose.
“If you say, “in your condition” so help me, I will kick your feathery ass.” Dean spits. But his words lose some of their intensity as Cas’ hardened glare sends signals elsewhere.
“Hey! Woah. Slow your roll there, Web M.D.” Dean interjects quickly, throwing his hands up in defence, “I am
Lucifer and you guys are just totally okay with this?” Dean’s statement meets with two blank stares.
“Shut up. Don’t call me that.” The older hunter grits and turns back to folding the shirt. It’s one of Cas’ polos that he rarely wears. A light blue that complements his eyes. Gently, he places it in the basket closest to him. After a few moments he can still feel Sam staring, “Get. Out.” Dean doesn’t bother to turn around and can sense Sam tense up as he leaves out into the hallway.
“Sorry to stop you there, but could we all sit down? I’m getting a little sick of standing.” She cuts Sam off. The Sheriff puffs, obviously pained as she digs a knuckle into her lower back.
“But if I’m going to help you boys, I’ll need something.” She pauses, with an incredulous look to Sam, “The black grimoire.”
A steady thumping. It’s a strong, repetitive sound that vibrates throughout his whole being. The thumping rings in his ears, a wave of calm pouring over Cas in its wake. An amazing force of power radiates from the light. It takes over Cas’ entire body, both calming him and keeping him readily alert.
“So I will be unable to surrender my grace.” Cas concludes, interrupting Dean’s train of spiralling thoughts.
Sam and Cas take up most of the morning and early afternoon assembling the changing table that was delivered some weeks ago. Adding the final touch to the nursery. An empty bedroom in the bunker, right next to Dean and Cas’. The only room which Dean hasn’t been allowed into, because the two dorks wanted it to be a surprise. Excitement bubbles through the older hunter as Cas comes into the kitchen, a big smile on his face.
Cas sits beside Dean and places his hand on top of Dean’s in reassurance, “I understand this is difficult Dean. Adjusting to Nephilim’s presence was something that took me by surprise as well-“
“I might get some cabin fever, but I’ll manage.” Dean reassures, he then wriggles closer to Cas, “Just come back.” Dean warns.
As he walks down the hallway, his grace is alerted of a presence in the entrance of the bunker. The strange shift in his angelic being prompts him to head towards the entry with apprehension.
A low grumble comes from the other end of the line, “What kinda friggin demon is collecting their bounty through possession? And wearing a shrink? They’re creative suckers sure, but they aint that creative.” Dean sighs, “I’m doing great by the way, thanks for asking. Although, I am starting to feel like Bobby, held in this empty bunker getting information for you two schmucks.” He pauses for a beat, “How’s Cas?”
Dean watches over Cas, yellow light emitting from his palm onto his stomach. It’s slightly uncomfortable making him cringe, but nothing is really happening. A few moments pass and Dean is beginning to grow impatient. He shifts under the yellow light as a strong thumping rings in his ears.
“Did he leave any of his things behind at the warehouse? Any of his old suits or gloves left there?”
Sam thinks. His jaw clenches, “Well, thanks for your “visit”, now close the door on the way out.” He spits poisonously, gun still at the ready.
Surprisingly, they talked down a new Rugaru and avoid a lot of carnage. The two of them able to get back to the bunker by late nightfall, 3 days earlier than planned. Sam wanted to surprise Dean out of his stay-at-home funk, by choosing not to tell him about their early arrival. Cas had been ecstatic the entire drive home at the thought.
something. Being holed up in the bunker makes me feel useless.” His words are weak. “I just- I needed to hunt.”
find the angel that caused this earthly disruption Castiel?” Naomi warns, “Or has your time here clouded your judgement?”
“I just want the both of us safe. Sue me if I don’t use our personal witch-lifeline every once in a while.” He’s trying to be playful. Adding a hand on the side of his bump for emphasis. Cas rolls his eyes. His whole body moving with the gesture.
“Yes. Agreed.” Cas nods and feels prompted to continue on, “The conception of a Nephilim does not require a gender, angelic grace will alter any gendered body to accommodate for the child’s gestation, whether that is male or female.”
Dean groans, his temper wearing thin, “Your clothes were filthy Sam, I wanted them clean.” When Sam doesn’t answer, but conceals his chuckle with a cough, Dean sighs, “And then, I saw the other piles of dirty laundry and thought I should get them ready before everything happens.” He adds sheepishly, shying away his gaze. Suddenly, the floor is the most interesting part of this conversation.
Cas places a hand on Dean’s and they both share a silent moment in each other’s eyes. That is until Cas’ crinkle into a grin. The baby kicks their hands from within. Even the kid is on Dean’s side.
“Oh, well I’m glad you two are -uh- you know – okay again.” Sam stutters slightly but settles on those words.
After another few mushy moments of staring. Cas peppers a chaste kiss against Dean’s lips. Dean tries to fight the rush of heat that goes to his cheeks. Ultimately losing, he turns to Sam, who lowers his phone and looks between them.
Cas stays silent for a few moments, causing Sam to bite his lip. “Okay.” Cas finalises his answer simply, truly the only word that could materialise in his mouth at that moment as he considers his next answer. After another few beats of silence, he speaks again, “I will take a look at dean.”
Not only his stomach churned but his mind is constantly reeling with reminders of the words he left Cas with. He’s been gone so long that he secretly fears the angel will never come back. That thought alone wretches at his heart, making it sink to the depth of his chest. It’s been sitting there for far too long.
I'm too excited with this story! So I'm posting another chapter! Don't expect this kind of upload schedule for the rest of the fic, but I'll try the best I can. I'm really enjoying writing this and I hope y'all enjoy this chapter! (because I had a lot of fun writing it!) :)
Upon entering the kitchen Dean meets with a pair of beaming blue eyes. Cas puts down the cook book he was apparently reading and looks between the two brothers expectantly. The fragments of the previous night flash in his mind, almost dizzying him as Dean steps through the doorway. He stands in the centre of the room, his bones cementing him to the floor.
Before finishing his sentence, a dark figure materialises in front of him. Gripping the gun in his back pocket, Dean fires 2 salt bullets. The ghost evaporates quickly, leaving a short window of opportunity. Grabbing the gas and salt, Dean swiftly doses the entire pile of abandoned equipment – there isn’t time to sift through everything, so why be thorough?
Sam laughs, a genuine deep laugh that lights up his whole face, “Either way, you are going to be a great dad, you just need to think about yourself for a change.” He claps Dean gentle on the shoulder, earning a nod from his older brother.
“You won this time.” Dean sighs, a smile playing on his lips. Almost in response, his stomach gurgles loudly. “And your prize is getting something to eat.”
Sam walks past the closed bathroom door and cringes as he hears Dean gag. He huffs a long sigh. His phone weights in his right hand. A familiar guilt creeps up his chest as he clicks Cas contact on his phone.
“We just want to give you a labour experience that makes it easier on you. Not harder.” Cas adds, cautioning a hand to Dean’s tensing shoulder.
“Yeah -uh- thanks Cas. It’s just all too much for me. This is just all kinds of crazy that I can’t wrap my freaking head around.” His head falls to his hands.
As he opens his mouth to speak, another ache – which can now identify as a definitive cramp – rolls through his abdomen. This one is much sharper and more painful than the last causing him to let out a low groan, “Son of a bitch!” He moans, both hands on the sides of his bump.
Dean scours the fridge and cabinets for anything he can stand, not finding anything that doesn’t make his stomach churn. Cas turns to Dean, “Apparently when one experiences morning sickness, it’s good to try bland, solid foods. Like saltines.” He states robotically, with a small smile.
Naomi takes a step back, scoffing, “Well forgive me for taking a few years to put my thoughts back in my skull!” Cas winces at the volume, “And after all that time recovering, I come to during a heaven-shattering revelation.” She starts to pace around her former garrison-mate, eyes narrowing, “That a Nephilim has been conceived on earth.”
Cas’ warm lips press against the softness that he had yearned for 2 months to have back. He revels in the kiss, moving his mouth with Dean’s in sync. He yearns for more and opens his mouth ever so slightly. Dean mirrors his movements. Cas drinks in Dean mouth, praying that he can explore him while this lasts. His licks Dean’s bottom lip playfully, asking for his entrance. Dean silently agrees and Cas is free to trail every inch of the hunter’s mouth. At first, the kiss is serene, and they both move slowly with one another. But a hunger blooms within the angel, craving for more. The kiss deepens, their tongues entangling one another in a dizzying embrace.
The younger Winchester stands, hearing his back crack in at least three different places and heads for the kitchen. Walking down the hallway, Sam can hear Dean and Cas chattering in the distance. He notes that knocking before entering is probably best – to avoid what happened the last time he walked straight in without warning. A shutter goes down his spine at the thought. There are many things he knows about Dean, but whatever
He carefully parks Baby and gets out of the car, almost slamming the door on his way. Spotting a nearby log, he sits himself down and sobs. Loud, uncontrollable sobs that rack through his body. Each intake causing a shudder down his back. His shoulders shaking. He lets his tears flow freely down his cheeks, not caring as they fall. “God damn it Cas!” He lets out a hopeless cry into the night. Not caring that the words crack in his throat, he continues in between heaving sobs, “It was so stupid to think that anything could go right with us!” Another loud sob breaks his yelling into a whisper, “But I was stupid enough to tell you-“ the tears falling down his chin stop him again, looking down he tries once more, “And now this? What the hell?” He lets out a mirthless laugh at that. A chilling sound that scares even him as it echoes, “It’s just – I just- I-“
“Stop askin me that!” He snaps. Cas’ face falls and Dean sudden feels guilt grip at his chest. Annoyingly, he remembers Rowena’s words from earlier, “A little achy, but that’s fine, right?” Dean backtracks, making it more of a whisper-shout than whisper.
They cradle one another for moment. Hands holding the other's face and eyes locking. Cas retreats his hands to flatten out the wrinkles in his trenchcoat nervously.
Sam straightens at that, his body becoming ridged at the words. “ What are you talking about?” He defends, his weak façade not fooling anyone, let alone the Devil.
Sam’s stomach drops slightly. Ten years? Could that something? Maybe they are going about this all the wrong –
The drive back to the bunker had been serene, the hunter and the angel sharing in light conversation the whole way. They talked almost the entire way home, not only on the new addition to their friendship – which Dean couldn’t really call it a “friendship” anymore – but also about the memories they have shared. Dean still can't believe how everything seemed so normal, so comfortable, considering the circumstances. Cas held himself with pride, beaming at Dean as he talked.
“And…A bottle of ketchup?” Sam dares to question, but by the hungry look in Dean’s eye he already has his answer.
“You’re nothing like Dad.” He says, biting back the chuckle that sits behind his lips. It’s Dean’s turn to crease his brows.
Sam’s mouth opens and closes multiple times as a silence blankets over them. Cas shifts his weight from the balls of his feet to his heels. His gaze darting around the room rapidly.
Sam feels useless as he has only become more worried about Dean as the weeks pass. He is constantly lethargic and moping around his room listening to Led Zeppelin when he isn’t puking any of the food he tries to keep down. Sam tried calling Cas a couple more times, but ultimately decided he couldn’t bare hearing that voicemail again.
“Here,” Cas shifts, so he is facing Dean, the hunter’s eyes widen, and brows fly up in shock. Cas then hovers his hand over Dean’s abdomen, it is quickly battered away.
“I haven’t tried to hide my love from you Dean. I thought you had known, hence the advancing of our relationship 2 months ago. I consented.” He faces Dean fully, his voice holding the same tone as always, but a smile is present on his features.
Cas snarls, “I will not be blindly dragged into another one of Heaven’s tortuous tasks. Do you not recall what happened to the Nephilim a millennia ago? And Lily Sunder’s child was not a Nephilim, yet we were tasked to kill an innocent. Or did you forget?”
“What am I chopped liver? I can lift a couple of books.”  Dean huffs, as he and Cas enter the storage unit of the bunker. He throws a sour look to the angel, and then turns his attention to Sam, “We got the books on wisp folklore.” He beams, holding the stack of books high in his hands for emphasis.
“That would probably be for the best, especially for the future.” The comment earns a groan as Dean nuzzles further into Cas’ chest. Cas lets out a soft chuckle, “I do have to check up on Heaven.”
“I won’t argue with that.” Dean inhales sharply and gets up with a small groan. His body aches and a headache has started to once again clustered behind his eyes.
“Saltines huh? And you’re sure it’ll help?.” The angel nods, prompting Dean to look for the saltines in their cupboard – which seems to be quite empty. After grabbing the packet, he and Cas sit down opposite Sam at the map table.
A little too fast, but strong nonetheless. An overwhelming feeling grips around his throat, causing Dean to gasp.
“Hey Cas.” Dean mutters back, originally wanting to mock him, but it wavers shakily as his grip tightens on the table. ”Long time, no see I guess. You went radio silent for a while there.”  the attempt to keep his composed façade wavers. He sways a little as he stands, making both Cas and Sam look to him with concerned expressions.
They exchange a look that expresses more words than either of them can muster. Cas’ eyes are glossy as he looks at Dean. A familiar feeling wells up amidst the chaos of pain. Failure. The same feeling that he would get when John would find out he had backed out of a case. Or, when he had left his post beside Sam. Dean had been selfish, ignorance and denial clouding his judgement. He’s almost 5 months pregnant God damn it.
The last weeks, Cas and Dean have grown impossibly closer. They share a bedroom – Dean reasoning that they sleep in the same room anyway, so why not just share? – and now more than ever, they are joined at the hip and constantly around one another. It’s a little sickening to Sam if he’s really honest, but it was time those two clowns sorted everything out, so he leaves them be. Busing himself with meaningless hunts in between researching to leave them to the “catch up” time that they need.
“No, it’s fine.” Dean interjects far too quickly, making Sam’s brow furrow. Dean ignores the look and continues, “If it aint witches, I’m probably coming down with a stomach bug or something.” He concludes, his eyes darting to the floor.
was a good idea?” He scoffs. The words flowing from his mouth are sour, he knows that. But couldn’t Cas have had the decency to at least let them know? Hell, an answer to their problem would have been helpful 3 weeks ago-
Cas pauses for a moment, his heart wrenching at the thought of Dean alone in the bunker. He’s taken aback for a beat, before quickly radiating into a forced smile, “Not yet. But my boy-"
“Ye-well -uh- no Cas.” Dean almost lets out a chuckle but bites it back, “I had too much to drink last night, and I guess it got out of hand.” There is a tense silence between them before Dean backtracks, “No, I don’t mean- Cas, buddy. It’s just - I’m not gay.” He blurts out, regretting the statement as soon as it is made. The air becomes stale around the words.
“Oh, you know, watching Dr Sexy reruns.” His response is awkward, maybe a little too forced. But Cas hums his agreement.
Then, the innocent soul brushes his grace ever so slightly. Flushing Cas with a rush of warmth and safety. Like the being has recognised his presence.
“I have to admit, I was relieved to hear you were dead.” Cas stands his ground, despite the urge to summon his angel blade.
Hey y'all I hope that you guys are enjoying this fic so far, it's been a really good write. I'm going away for a little bit soon, so my upload schedule may be a little slow, but I'll try to upload when I can!
“Thank you so much for coming Rowena. We just need a little extra protection and figured you could help.” Sam starts, awkwardly rushing his words.
The large pile of equipment slumps against the back wall, all sorts of gear has been thrown on top it. Including Brian’s gloves. His small grin still present on his features, Dean rubs the side of his bump, “See, easy as pie-“
The silence in the room continues as both Sam and Cas try to egg the other on to say something. With the recent souring moods of his brother, Sam is scared that if he says anything he might pay for it. It seems Cas is the same.
“We need that Talisman Dean. It’s taken a month to get us nothing, we can’t waste any more time.” Sam’s eyes fall. Dean curses his puppy dog eyes.
Cas’ stance narrows into Dean’s frame, he places a hand on his abdomen silently. Propping his hunter up on the wall, Cas makes sure he is safe. There is an element of softness and calm to his movements. Eyes closing and light emitting from his palm. He moves them closer together by cupping the back of Dean’s head to touch their foreheads. Dean leans into the familiar warmth of skin. He pants heavily, tears feely flowing down his cheeks. It takes a beat, but Dean realises that he can
Thus, Dean concludes that being on house arrest is officially the worst. He’s trapped inside with his thoughts. But he must make himself comfortable because he will be confined to the bunker for a little while. To make the best out of a bad situation, Dean aims to set himself up in his room. Maybe some Dr Sexy MD reruns and pizza will help?
Cas’ brows furrow even deeper into his squinted eyes (if that is even possible), “But Dean you said-“
“And what is the movie you two decided on?” Cas says as he slots himself beside Dean. Because despite the size of the couch, Dean takes up almost all of it.
In the past weeks, this has been happening more than Dean would like to admit. Luckily, his nausea has eased, but in its place are a whole new list of…oddities. Cas had very lovingly suggested that he was experiencing “mood swings” after he couldn’t stop crying when they watched Tombstone together. The comment was met with a death stare and the silent treatment – that lasted a grand total of 2 minutes before Dean broke down in a teary apology.
The three of them converge in the entry, Dean having put on a shirt, and meet with Rowena’s smiling face.
Cas grabs at Dean chin and pulls his gaze to look up at him. “Your weight increase is a sign that the Nephilim is progressing. They are healthy, as are you.” A chase kiss presses to Dean’s lips, causing a deep crimson to spread across his cheeks.
The angel focuses his grace on Dean. He moves from his head, down to his shoulders, chest, the angelic grace healing any abrasions or injuries obtained from previous hunts. There were many untreated wounds. Then he falters on Dean’s abdomen, his own stomach dropping as he sees it. A pure white light. It’s so bright it almost blinds him. At first, he cowers from the light. It holds such a power, and influence over him it’s overwhelming.
“Hello.” Cas replies, his smile can be heard over the line, “Just checking in. How are you holding up?”
After saying their goodbyes, Cas and Sam leave for Michigan. Dean waves them off as they go, and it takes everything in his being to restrain his jealousy.
“Of course.” Sam says, gesturing for Cas to sit beside him. There is a pause as the Sheriff settles down into her seat.
“Well Cas, that’s the thing. Dean is sick and it’s been going on for weeks. I don’t know what’s wrong with him, but he thinks he might have been hexed by the witches we came up against a couple months back.” Sam pauses, realising that his nervous ramblings are very fast and slows himself down, “I want you to take a look at him."
Cas has his duffle, so Dean packs light with the spare backpack he keeps in case of emergencies. Or, if they just need an extra bag on long hunts – never hurts to be safe right? He packs for a 2-day trip. Hopefully, he can get the hunt done in one. Then, he will be back to tidy up the bunker before Cas and Sam get back.
bit of a filler chapter before the next one, but here we are! A bit of destiel getting closer ;) and hormonal dean to soften what is going to go down in the next chapter
“I thought I’d make some chilli for lunch.” He beams, turning to face Dean fully. His face falls slightly, at the forlorn look on the older hunter’s face. Seemingly distracted, Dean looks off to the distance with a slight grimace. He looks exhausted. Cas hesitates before asking the inevitable, “Are you alright?”
“That should do it!” She exclaims proudly, “No more unwanted angels pestering you boys.” She adds. With the spell finished, Rowena decides to take to the road again.
“Let’s just get going with the movie, shall we?” Sam desperately tries to take the attention away from whatever is happening over there.
As his coffee brews, Dean gets a whiff of it, his nose screws up and he has to hold back a gag with the back of his hand. He pours the coffee quickly down the drain as Sam watches, expectantly waiting for an explanation with a slacked jaw. “Yeah.” Dean finally says after he catches his breath. “I’ve felt like I’ve had the worst hangover for the past couple of days.” He then pauses and gestures to the coffee machine, “What coffee is this? It smells like ass.”
“Nothing too much, just that now the Nephilim is…progressing,” Sam shoots a quick glance down to Dean’s stomach, “The soul bond and angelic grace are an integral for the development of the -uh- Nephilim.”
Thankfully, the couple’s therapist wasn’t a cross-roads demon. Which lifted a gigantic weight off of both of the hunter and angel’s chests. That also meant that both Sam and Cas were entirely unprepared for the following proceedings of their scheduled “appointment”. Doctor Halen was an actual Doctor, she had transferred to Arrow Rock a month prior to complete a research paper. She was then promptly possessed by a very vengeful and angry poltergeist. The poltergeist in question has been spending the past month possessing the wives who sit in the sessions, recreating her own death.
the baby’s heartbeat clearly in his ears. It’s rapid, stressed and on edge but it’s there. As he realises it, there is an overwhelming sense of joy as he focuses on the thudding sound. It shifts slightly, slowing down as a flutter causes Dean to look down to his stomach. An evidence of life.
“Yes ma’am.” Sam starts, “Would you be able to tell us more about the case? While interrogating both Mrs Fletcher and Mrs Browne they explained they had the same couple’s therapist. Could you tell us more about her?” He pulls out the notepad in his pocket and a pen.
them. The presence of an angelic soul is too vague in its early stages to detect with sight. But I could hear it’s presence.”
“Oh-uh- nothing. Cas had to go do something angelic. He doesn’t know when he’ll be back.” He tries to be noncommittal with his answer, but it comes out sour and pointed. Sam throws him a weary glance that Dean ignores. The words he had said ring in his mind as he searches the fridge for a beer. He needs one right about now.
Cas sighs heavily, and pulls Dean from drowning in the sea of his unending thoughts, “I am going to leave you be Dean. I apologise.” And before the hunter can say anything in response, Cas leaves abruptly, leaving the hallway echoing the flap of his wings.
Sam nods his surprise and continues, “I think we should head over today. It’s less than an hour away and we still have time to interview witnesses and hopefully find this coven before they do anything too drastic.”
After what feels like an eternity, Dean breaks the kiss to breathe. His chest heaving as he pants. “Geez Cas.” Is all he can manage, breathlessly trying to regain full consciousness.
He grips his lighter, striking it a couple of times, a flame appears. Dean blows out a breath, “Thank God-“
His eyes are tiring, making concentrating near impossible. Sam is definitively getting too old for this.
. That thought scares him. Inside of him is a small thing. A person. A being. A kid who would have to depend on him.
He is standing in the mirror, frowning down at his belly. His stomach pokes over the top of his hot-dog pyjama pants. It sticks out a little awkwardly, a silver of skin poking out the bottom of his shirt. His bump may be small, but it’s still there
Hell for my reappearance.” He gestures to his body, his old vessel Nick, “Good old Crowley fixed up this old thing after I was left to jump from vessel to vessel for a minute there – Thank you for that by the way. But here I am, good as new. I knew you’d like seeing a familiar face.”
Dean stalls, the comment temporarily stunning him. He dares to caution a look to the 3 full baskets of folded clothes, and frowns. That is a lot of laundry, he had spent the entire morning washing and folding it. Loosening his grip on the shirt, he returns his gaze to his gigantic brother. Staying stern, Dean stares him down for a moment, but to no avail, “So?” He says, a touch more desperate than he’d like.
Satisfied that Dean will continue to sleep soundly, Cas creeps out into the hallway after to help Sam in the storage unit.
Sam nods and tries to play along, “Banning?” his façade isn’t strong, but he attempts keep himself rational, if not for them, for his own sanity “Aren’t Heaven and the angels going to be tipped off?”
“Morning.” Sam dulls, not looking up from his laptop on the map table. Dean just hums in response and opens up the fridge.
Sam chuckles, despite his brother’s whining, “Don’t worry man, you can still have pie. We bought some apple, for when you’re feeling up to it.”
It takes Dean a moment to process the new information. He slows his breathing down as the claustrophobia from earlier seeps into his bones. Cas’ touch only does so much to ground him. But trying to get used to this “new normal” is a big task, even for Dean Freaking Winchester. But eventually it clicks in his mind. If he has to be warded from angels, but can’t-
Cas nods, “The baby reacted to the large amount of stress you caused, giving you pains. They should subside after you have rested.” He spits the last word sharply.
“WHAT?” Sam yells down the phone line, making Dean wince, “What the hell are you doing in Nebraska?! Earlier today you said you were watching TV.”
Sam blinks a little wildly and looks up, “yeah, I think so? I’m not 100% sure yet. Hence, I needed some more information.” He works over the mess of papers and reaches for the books Dean and Cas had brought in, “How was the library today? Sorry I couldn’t get to it; I just wanted to organise
“I may not have been Dad’s favourite, but he made some fun trinkets I’ll give him that.” A cold chuckle leaves his lips, “And you could say, I thought I’d store this one away until someone desperate needed my help.”
Dean’s lips part, wanting more. Craving the suffocating feeling. Cas licks his bottom lip; he throws in a playful bite just to hear the hunter stifle a moan. Cas grins into the kiss before locking them together again. Both of Dean’s hands gravitate towards Cas’s hair. Softly gripping and pulling at the raven strands to try and ground him.
. His stomach flutters at every subtle touch, and his body melts into his embrace. Every time Cas utters his name he has to hold back a smile or fight the flush that tries to spread across his cheeks. His eyes, his hands, his
Her bright red lips curl upwards and she sighs blissfully, “It’s current residence in at the McLoughlin household.” There is a sour edge as she mentions the name, but quickly she brushes past it, “They live in Blue Hill, about an hour’s drive from where we are.” Sam furrows his brows, “Don’t scour at me Samuel. I’ll talk you through the directions on the way.”
“I choose to fall into an unconscious or sleep-like state to stay by Dean’s side at night.” He muses, his usually pursed lips curving upwards at the thought. He makes a gesture to the room, “But no, as an angel I don’t sleep. Therefore, the extra bed is unnecessary.”
“God damn it.” Dean huffs, pulling his shirt down, “I’ve found a case.” He says to the empty room. His thoughts are fractured, torn between whether he should go on the case he had found that morning. A string of disappearances after multiple people reporting a ghost at a shipping warehouse in Lexington, Nebraska. It’s a simple case: find the body, salt, and burn it. Dean would be in and out of the warehouse by the end of the day. But that’s why he is standing in the mirror in the first place. To persuade himself to
After the initial shock and insanity of it all blew over somewhat, Sam had started to pace the length of the infirmary. Mumbling his incoherent thoughts under his breath while pinching the bridge of his nose.
“I’m glad.” The angel says sheepishly, taking another long look around them, “I thought that you might not like the yellow.”
“Peachy!” Is the sour response, “Just enjoying the “joys of pregnancy”!” Cas smiles at the use of his earlier reference.
“Yes. A Nephilim is a being that will attract a lot of attention from the angels, although the gestation period is still early, the angels were able to detect the presence of another angelic soul.” Cas pauses, peering at the paled faces of both brothers.
Not even twenty minutes into the movie, Dean is snoring soundly in Cas’ lap, while the angel is intently watching the film. By the look of things, he’s genuinely interested in the plot. Or maybe he’s trying to figure out why Dean loves the movie so much. None the less, while watching he combs his fingers through Dean’s hair.
“I’m a very old witch Samuel, I know more than you boys might think.” She offers him a wink. Everyone’s attention is drawn back to Dean as winces again, including Rowena’s. “And to get rid of these Braxton hicks, try to take a walk or rest if you’ve been active. A bath helps, and so does drinking water.” Dean nods weakly. She then turns to the room. “As enthralling as this might be, I’ve got some pressing matters with a coven not too far from here. But, I’ve left some aiding spells and instructions in the library. Take care of yourself darlin’.” She cups Dean’s cheek sweetly with her hand
“And because this will run like a normal pregnancy, you are going to have to make some changes.” Sam adds, failing to hide his smirk.
Nowadays, Dean’s brow usually has a light glistening of sweat as burdened by lumbering around an extra the 20 pounds strapped to his middle. But as he pants a little more than he usually does as he sits. Cas notices that he’s
Rowena looks to Cas, “Castiel, would you like the pleasure of telling him?” Her face curling cheekily as the angel turns a shade of red.
“Yeah, just a back pain.” His words are slurred with sleep, “There isn’t enough room left for the kid to move around.” He lets out of a small groan as he tries to reposition.
Sam had stayed quiet. But as the room grows more tense he has to voice the question nagging at him, “What does that mean for Dean going forward if the angels already know? Are they going to hunt us down?”
“Uh,” Dean really doesn’t have an answer for that one. His silence is telling enough for the conversation to continue.
In retrospect, it might be because of his body’s adjustment to sleeping like a hunter. Relying on only 4 hours, most nights, in dingy motel rooms can really mess with you. Sam usually expects that going to sleep will be difficult…but Jesus, can’t he have one restful night?
“Hey, can we -uh – take five?” Dean interrupts Cas’ train of thought and flashes a fake smile. He glares at Cas and Sam. Gestures to the library, he grits his teeth, “Over there. Now.”
“Yeah you have.” Dean deadpans, sounding more irritated than he’d like. But he can’t shake Sam’s words out of his head.
Slightly shorter chapter than usual, because the plot has to thicken. But here's Lucifer in all his douchey glory!
being normal?” Cas offers Dean a sympathetic look and places a hand on his shoulder. The sudden outburst dampens into a whimper. Dean clutches the counter, “None of this is normal Cas!” He tries to sound angry, but the statement comes out as more of a shaky yelp.
“Son of a bitch.” Dean grumbles, taking a small bite of his saltine. Surprisingly, it doesn’t make him want to run back to the bathroom. So, he takes another.
The Sheriff considers their offer for a moment, shifting uncomfortably in her chair. She then nods, “Sure thing boys. As long as you two can figure this thing out. We haven’t had trouble like this in what, ten years or so?” She let out a breathy chuckle at that.
Naomi’s features warm into a chilling grin, “Those were simpler times.” She takes a beat, looking around the bunker, “Where is the aforementioned Winchester?” She dares to ask.
Sam looks over to Lucifer, and then back to Dean with a sigh, “We can find a loop hole Dean, we always have. We have a chance to keep you safe and Cas won’t have to go. It’s a win at least for now.”
After he’s sure that the ghost is gone, Dean rolls onto his back, a hand helplessly rubbing as pain travels from his back to his lower stomach. “This better not be what I think it is.” He moans, the gravelly mumbling not doing anything to sooth him. His breath catches in his throat, reducing to pants to help subside the pain.
Cas nods in understanding, “Then are there any positions you’d want to try? Like on all fours – a very popular suggestion – or laying down in your own bed? Maybe we could get a birthing ball for you?”
Later, after a tense car ride and Sam hurrying to Dean’s side panicking like he was going into labour, Dean is settled in bed. Sam sits awkwardly at the end of his bed, as instructed by Cas while he gets Dean some ginger tea.
Dean immediately squares himself up to protest but he is quickly shut up as a chilling look is directed at him. A warm tingling sensation blooms, dulling his previous anger. Why does Cas have to look so
Sam and cas arrive at the bunker and meet with Dean at the bottom of the stairs. Despite them being gone for the last two and a half days, he is still wearing the same sweatpants. He has a wash of concern as he looks to Sam.
Sam winces, “Dude, you should take a load off. Maybe get some rest?” He tenses his shoulders in preparation for the berating of a lifetime.
“What?” She fanes her offence, placing a dramatic hand against her chest, “Well I never! I came to help you poor souls.” She tuts, “But, to do that, I need the black grimoire.”
“Yep. Witches, maybe a coven in Andover. Some crap about old witch lore. I get the gist.” He grumbles.
Dean needs coffee and quickly. His head pounds as he paces, his hangover mixed with the flashing memories that continue to plague him. He is met with Sam’s face buried in his laptop, not noticing Dean at first as he stumbles into the kitchen. He surveys the kitchen quickly, scanning for Cas, but when he can’t find him he curses. They need to talk. Now.
“I can’t fit in these jeans.” He growls and throws a gesture down to the button on the floor. A grin plays on Cas’ lips as he sinks beside Dean.
Cas grumbled his protest. But, to both Cas and Sam’s surprise, Dean wasn’t shocked or outraged by the suggestions. Simply he had responded, while leaning against the kitchen counter, “If she can get rid of our regular visitors, I’m all ears.”
Cas! Lucifer is bad news for both me and the Nephilim If this favour ends up endangering us.” Dean pleads, trying to be the voice of reason.
The heartbeat only lasts a few seconds before Cas pulls away and looks to Dean. The hunter’s mouth is slightly agape, and his eyes are teary.
, Dean mentally corrects himself. And despite the clear divide between them, Cas reaches over and cups the back of Dean’s neck and deepens their connection. He pulls away slowly, the smile on his face growing impossibly larger.
As calm as he can, Sam pulls out his phone to press Dean’s contact. With Cas’ curious gaze, Sam rings Dean.
Sam perks up from his current book to look at Dean. The pregnant hunter’s eyes are heavy, and his face is contorted in pain. He keeps shifting in his seat and fussing. Sam sighs, setting down his book on a pile of papers. Sam shares a quick glance with Cas – who had come back from making lunch some time ago – whose eyebrows continue to knit together the longer he looks over at Dean. The angel has apparently also been aware of him.
“Thanks.” Dean smiles widely and almost runs out of the library. Clearly not worried about hiding his excitement.
The angel is actually sitting on a bench at a park, watching as children play on the equipment in front of him. Warm sunlight peppers his cheeks, and he was, until he was rudely interrupted, enjoying the serene calm of the day. Drinking in the vastness of the rolling green hills as children laughed and played. He found comfort in these moments, they reminded him of heaven. The stillness of the trees echoing the sounds of laughter filled him with a keen sense of joy.
“Well, the angel wardings in here seem to need recharging,” Cas bristles at that, “don’t worry tweetiepie. The warding shouldn’t affect you. Only angels trying to locate or enter the bunker.” He visibly relaxes as she continues talking, “The black grimoire is capable of many things. Last I checked, albeit it many moons ago, there is a spell that should charge up these Sigils.”
Cas and Sam sigh in unison, “That isn’t much of a ‘plan’ Dean.” Cas drones, clearly over his attitude, “Sam and I would both like to support you to the best of our ability. And ensure you and the baby will have a peaceful delivery.”
So sorry for the whacky upload schedule but I'm back at work and it's getting a little bit difficult. Anyway, these chapters keep getting longer and longer! At this rate, I don't really know how many words this fic will end up being.
They set out drive out to Arrow Rock later that day, figuring they can try and do what they can before sundown. The drive was quiet. The two friends only engaging in light conversation to pass the time. When they got there, they made sure to go over the basics of going undercover. Cause Cas hasn’t pretended to be an agent for a couple of years. The FBI song and dance is fairly simple, interviewing two of the wives and getting authorisation to review the bodies at the morgue. The morgue would have to be dealt with tomorrow, because they need to have a briefing with the sheriff during opening hours. A clear routine. It all seems like a blur to Sam now that he’s done it so many times.
Dean’s lips form a straight line, his jaw clenching and unclenching, “And you think we’re just going to trust you? After everything you’ve pulled on us?”
“I’m so glad you’re not going to be pregnant soon Dean, cause that’s gross.” Sam crinkles his nose up, as his popcorn suddenly doesn’t look as appetising.
“Friggin witches Sammy. Have I told you how much I hate them?” He pants, a hand rubbing against his rib as he speaks.
Before Dean has a chance to finish his sentence, Cas emerges from behind the door. He can hear his heart in his ears as he watches the angel, awkwardly fidgeting with the wood on the door. Dean’s mind tears, Cas is right there in front of him.
A knot tightens in Sam’s back as he hunches over the piles of paper. It feels like he’s studying for the SATs again. But that was back then he was a lot younger, and his back didn’t ache from the strain of sitting too long. Sifting through book after book and coming up with nothing. Searching for an answer seems to be harder than expected. Sam has spent weeks going through the same things. Wardings. Sigils. Amulets. Spells-
He draws small patterns on his stomach with his fingers, his eyes focused intently as he does. It’s not a big change, just a little swell that seems to keep growing by the day. It’s strange to get used to, a bit of extra weight that’s gathering around his middle. Cas has reassured him that at 18 weeks he looks great, Dean doesn’t think as much. But his growing stomach is holding something important. The small bulge is housing a baby.
The steady thumping fills his ears and he projects the angelic grace outwards, attempting to transmit the sound onto Dean’s interlocking soul.
Before he can finish the sentence, Cas crashes their lips together. It’s messy and Cas has to strain his neck forward to reach Dean’s lips over his bump. It still sends flutters of excitement none the less. Dean whimpers weakly against Cas’ lips.
“Dean. If he is right, then this is our last chance at warding off heaven. We don’t have time to find an alternative.” Cas adorns a forlorn look, that makes Dean heart wrench a little. But not enough. This is freaking Lucifer they’re talking about.
Dean speaks before he can think, “But I do love you.” He can’t swallow them back. They have been said and Cas’ face lights up as he considers them.
Sam lets out a mirthless laugh, “We thought we might come up against a cross-roads demon Dean! We’ve got squat for the ritual!” He yells, before getting thrashed against the wall.
“Sam!” Dean snaps, embarrassment warming his cheeks. He tries to cover up his exposed stomach. Failing he goes to rest his hands on the top of it, “Learn to knock man. Come on!”
She shakes her head, “Nothing. It’s just, unfortunately darlin’, this was just a practice round of contractions. They’re called Braxton Hicks contractions. The pains are too close together and sporadic for you to be in labour.” Rowena’s tone doesn’t have a trace of mockery, but genuine sympathy.
“Thank you so much for your help ma’am.” Dean promptly nods her off and heads out the door with a huff.
“I was, but I had to take a leak. Oh, and listen to Naomi lecture you!” His words are a little harsher than he’d like. Cas nods his silent understanding. Dean’s face softens, “So, what was she doin’ here?”
Rowena looks to him for a moment, quirking her brow as if waiting for more. She then leans back in her chair, “I’ll need a better answer than that Dean.”
He stares her down, “How are you alive?” His voice is stern and low, keenly aware of Dean still sleeping close by.
Cas leans down closer to Dean, “You alright?” He whispers against his temple, as not to disturb Sam and Rowena’s chattering.
Dean lets out a weak chuckle, “About that.” He bites back a laugh, laughing might do more damage than good, and lowers his voice, “I need one of you to haul your ass over here.” The plea is urgent, undercut with Dean’s usual gruff, laidback tone. He supresses another groan as blinding pain builds in his abdomen. A worried hand rubs the underside of his bump.
“We don’t. But I can fall into a sleep-like state if I choose to. And I chose to sleep by your side.” Cas offers a lopsided smile that ignites a warmth in Dean’s chest. “Can you stand?”
“God. Cas I’m so sorry- it’s just- I’m so- shit Cas.” Dean stutters, letting out a sigh. The sigh is cut back with a grumble. The deep ache still pulsates through his belly, “Why does it still feel wrong? Are you sure the kid’s, okay?”
Dean smiles, “Yeah, the kid’s movin’ all the time now.” He rubs a hand on the underside of his bump.
After the birthing plan discussion, that left Dean pretty testy and on edge, Cas and Sam decided that they needed to keep the rest of the day lowkey. At least until the baby arrived, they want to ensure that everyone is calm. Thus, Sam suggested they have a movie night together.
“It’s just routine questioning, I apologise ma’am.” Dean mentally scolds himself for expecting an easy find. No matter, remains are still a thing, “Do you have anything that belonged to Brian still in your house?” He winces and discretely braces a hand to his back; he’s been standing a little too long.
“Hello Dean.” The angel coos softly, meeting with Dean’s eyes. They’re drawled with tiredness, his face a little paler than usual. Cas’ brows furrow slightly, “You seem tired.” He adds attentively.
Dean’s unusually high pitch makes Rowena turn around, she looks over to Dean with a furrow of her brow, “Dean? What’s wrong darlin’?”
“Oh, yeah.” Sam grins, waving a finger vaguely in the direction of a specific pile of papers, “Just put them over there, gimme a sec and I’ll look through them.”
“Hello Sheriff, I’m agent Morrison and this,” He gestures to Cas who is very still, his eyes squinting, “is agent Seger.”
“I-uh-“Dean stalls, a knuckle digging into the pulsing twinge of his back. His throat tightens and he chokes on his words, “I got hurt. I think something’s wrong with the baby.” Sam flusters on the other end of the phone, Dean can hear the faint murmurers from Cas.
Cas tilts his head to the side, “There is no need to have a room with two beds Sam. I don’t need sleep.” He explains factually.
He potters about in the dark kitchen, fumbling for a mug and tea bag. Successful in his findings, he shuffles to the kettle and gets it boiling. His hands move around the countertops with ease, not needing any light. As he waits for his tea to steep, the atmosphere shifts suddenly. Groggy in the wee hours of the morning, Sam tries to squint in the darkness, at the impending noise. Faint footsteps plod their way into the kitchen.
As quickly as the voices had entered, they fled. Leaving the angel defenceless on a park bench. He sighed heavily, “Damn it.”
“Oh,” The Sheriff chuckles, “Soon now. Only a few more weeks to go.” Her smile is warm, but it’s cut back a little as she grimaces. “You -uh- got any kids?” She adds.
Later that day, Cas finds himself at the bunker’s entrance. The small doorway is daunting. There is only a small set of stairs, but he can’t seem to will himself to move toward them. He hesitates for a moment, eyeing down the door to the bunker for far too long before forcing his legs to move.
Sam’s wild gaze falls on Cas, who only offers a lost look, “Cas, you can’t go around telling people about Dean!” He pinches the bridge of his nose, “At least lie about his gender next time?”
“Skip the oscar speech and give me the damn necklace.” Dean deadpans, clearly sick of the charade. And frankly, Lucifer’s annoying voice. He sighs and nods mutely, handing Dean the talisman.
“But nothing Dean.” Sam starts, wriggles a little closer to him, “Not once had Dad regretted going out on a hunt and leaving us.” Dean opens his mouth, but is stopped, “Not once had Dad made sure that he was doing the best for us. Not once did he try to be there for us.” Sam’s statements grow in intensity as he speaks, as if the words he is saying have been held back for a long time. “You’re trying to do the best that you can for you and Cas’ kid. Even if that means breaking old habits.” He smiles and makes a pointed gesture to Dean’s stomach, “Hell, you’re carrying the damn thing and still having doubts about if you’re a good parent or not.”
Cas wades down the bunker steps carefully and meets with Sam’s overenthusiastic gaze. He flashes a quick smile in return, his brows quickly returning to their deep quizzical furrow. Seeing the familiar face welcoming him back to the bunker warms him only slightly. A foreign nervousness blooming in his chest.
Bracing a hand to her back, the Sheriff takes in a sharp breath, “Doctor Halen?” Sam nods, “Doctor Halen is one of the most successful couple’s therapists in Missouri, she transferred here about a month ago.” She holds an apprehensive tone.
Sam attempts to bat Cas away, swatting his hands around wildly, “Enough of the gross lovey dovey stuff.” He pretends to crinkle his nose in disgust, “What are you thinking we are huntin’?”
