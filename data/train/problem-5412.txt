He doubts Natasha will be on her way to see Steve Rogers for now. She has a good head on her shoulders, and with any luck Rogers will at least wait for the initial heat to die down before doing something monumentally
Steve couldn't explain why he stopped mid-stride into the room at the sight but he just kind of did because Tony had that same determined glint in his eyes and looked a little flushed, his lips moving with the lyrics of the song (
Peter’s working with Jarvis an hour after the two Avengers went missing, trying to find a basis for finding Amora. Steve is stuck simply waiting; pacing about the mission room and waiting for a sign, for any show of the villainess’ visage to reappear.
Loki personally knows the feeling, the feeling of the Tesseract running through your veins, tugging at your muscles, your mind. It’s a rush of adrenaline and crippling fear, to have so much power, so much
When the person that’s holding Tony put him down and run their fingers through Tony’s hair, well, it’d be a lie to say it’s what sends Tony back to sleep. Technically he wasn’t fully awake in the first place.
A blinding white light flashed brightly for a few seconds before shattering in a myriad of colors. The fading particles of dazzling lights were dimming against the abysmal backwash of absolute darkness, overshadowed by the furrows of violet and orange; stars and galaxies within reach and yet light-years away. The air is still with the presence of the cosmos, thick with untapped power that electrifies the air like static electricity.
“You said that you were spoken to in a dream, and you’re psychic, and there’s a Valkyrie about…” Tony recaps and Missouri hums her agreement. “But there’s something else..?” Tony ventures and Missouri closes her eyes and nods. “About me?”
“Or we give the location of the rogue Avengers,” Vision says solemnly, staring at Tony. “This is assuming we… know their location, to begin with.” Rhodey looks at Vision oddly, then looks at Tony, at the slight tremble in his left arm that clenches the armrest.
is leading the charge behind this breakout. I mean,” Ross straightens his back, raises his hands with a shrug, “who
Steve is always left breathless with the reality that he was chosen, he is lucky enough to be let in, to see the malleable, fragile parts of Tony hidden behind snark and left handed remarks.
The critical look that Loki gives him is all serious, the kind of look Steve recognizes. It’s the look of a soldier marching out to a battle they may not win, for a cause worth dying for.
, “so if you could please remove yourself from our residence we will not need to call the police or lawyers and this won’t have to see the light of day. Or Youtube.”
She’d imagined a giant quarantine, had heard Clint’s tale of how long it had taken before they were able to quarantine Thor’s hammer over in New Mexico. A few people were able to try to take a stab at trying to lift it before they had managed to set up. But this—this wasn’t even an attempt.
Erik Selvig is a kind man, Steve knows, and after the Loki fiasco he had become an almost permanent fixture both in the Tower and Thor's conversation. Steve respected him.
—and plunge back down, slow, so slowly, like his body wants to taste Steve, the girth and feel of him, and never let go. Steve groans long and loud, like he can’t even control himself anymore, but his hands tighten on Tony’s thighs where he left them before Tony commanded Jarvis to shut off the lights.
“He was… sitting. In the conference room, the one Ross used when he told us about… the Accords…” Wanda trails off. It seemed so long ago, when she had seen it, and it boggles her even now to know it hasn’t even been months, only a few weeks. “But it was only Stark, and Rhodes, and Ross was there, too. But it was like they were… paused? Frozen in place.
Loki’s body disappears and the shard of the Tesseract goes flying into the wall. Thor grunts as his body hits the ground again and Loki is there I a blink, his clone long  in the air. “Brother?” Thor rumbles and Loki grins.
“Tony, calm down.” Steve puts a hand on Tony’s uninjured shoulder and pushes him down gently. “Thor isn’t going anywhere and we won’t send him to Asgard for no reason at all; the woman--”
“C’mon,” Clint says, walking towards Sam and Scott huddled together in front of Steve’s hunched from towards the front of the Quinjet. Wanda follows silently, still not quite all-there.
you tell me?” Tony starts and the psychic ushers him to sit. She sits across from him silently, simply watching him with those dark eyes.
It turns out to be a lot easier to find the giant mass than Natasha had thought. Three truck stops later, she’d met a man that wrote for an online blog on different
“—just, look up these coordinates for me, yeah?” Darcy looks up at the yellow square Jane holds up and starts tapping away at her phone. “Let me know what you get, we may need to re-do some of the wiring.”
Tony’s waiting for Thor to return from SHIELD in the basement lab of Stark Tower. With Jarvis running scans on the different bits of fibers Tony brought back and the image of the tree, Tony is left with only his thoughts and a bunch of searches to work with on his own, Tony sighs and leans back in his chair. He hates this, idle work and research, but it's something so he flips over to the next tab, opens a new window in mid-air and opens all live feeds in Laurence.
“So we have golden thread, a wolf and a tree.” Tony bobs his head and taps his fingers on the counter. “Not too shabby. Is our friendly neighborhood Asgardian-pseudo-norse-god expert here yet?”
Hope figures her father has made his own fair share of mistakes. Could he really fault her for potentially making one on her own?
It’s them. Tony and Steve sitting on the hard hospital bed, Tony’s helmet on his lap and Steve’s hands are on his shoulder. Even in his mind, Tony can feel the dull ache of the chemical agent; no form of acid, for sure, and the burns are superficial. Must have been made to specifically go through his armor, then; the scald is just a product of the compound’s exothermic reaction with the armor.
cheapskates" Tony groans and he sounds tired as hell./ "I mean--where did I go wrong, since when was stopping death machines a
Tony is ogling at something on the work table, an uncharacteristically animated, chipper Bruce beside him. The two are so close their shoulders are bumping, their elbows keep jostling and bright laughter echoes in the grand room, drowning out the usual whirling-clicking-humming of the machines. Bruce nervously runs a hand through his hair and huffs out a little laugh as Tony quirks a grin. The two seem awfully calm and chummy, completely oblivious to the frozen Super-Soldier that's standing in the doorway.
There’s something inexplicably odd in the air this late morning, something out of place that doesn’t belong. Steve sighs as he clenches the edge of the sink, muscles pulled taut and tense across the broad expanse of his back. The cotton white shirt is stretched to the seams, the fabric stretched to its limits. Steve runs a still damp hand through his hair and tilts his head back, exasperated.
Tony walked over the doorway, over the last remnants of the glass doors, and made his way to the main lobby, eying the concession stands and the two branching hallways. He smirked and followed the dark passage with the glimmering webbing hanging from the archway. He kept going further down, his suit seeing through the thick darkness, following the web residue left behind by Peter’s canisters.
Clint blinks, looks worried. His eyes are normal. Wanda lets out a breath, and then gives him a hesitant, watery smile. "Sorry," she says raspily, "just getting lost in thought. Is there something else?"
And the photo had been bad, admittedly so, but there was something hauntingly familiar about the giant mass’s glow that she couldn’t shake off.
and you do not hold a cure. The answers. I am not a killer nor a spy. I have nothing to give you and you have nothing to give
“I can’t just—Tony! Tony!” Steve shouts and watches in horror as Tony looks up and their eyes meet, so worried, so sad and determined that Steve can’t blink or he knows he’s going to miss something.
“I’m not offering you a quick morning fuck.” Tony takes a deep breath and swallows the need to laugh this off, pretend it was all part of a game but he’s gone too far to want to come back. He needs this. He wants it.
“Like what?” Scott asks, slightly hesitant. Nakia turns to him but it is T’Challa that speaks up instead.
“—hasn’t been satisfied, but I’m not too sure if he’s done yet or not. This took… meticulous planning. Something that he could do day-to-day and perhaps even just wait out for. We can’t be too sure, but FRIDAY was trying to follow his progress and there are too many holes we can’t account for that I’m not too keen on finding out.”
"Is this you, getting your hands dirty?" Pepper clarifies, breaking Fury from his impending reverie. "Because, I gotta say, its maybe four of five years a little too late for you to start taking
Steve blush, really—and something in Tony’s mind, or chest, gets a little warm and fuzzy and for a moment he thinks it might be a stroke but it’s much, much worse. He pushes that aside and focuses on more important topics, like the throbbing pain in his shoulder and the strange illusions that plague his every moment.
Steve’s trying to pull the metal clasps riveted to the floor when Tony’s eyes snap open and the gauntlets unlock.
. There are a few topics never broached, never thought twice about and the Thor-Loki pseudo incestuous love-hate relationship is probably somewhere on the top five. Sadly, the list is fairly extensive.
There’s the glow of the arc reactor, though, giving them a dim glow, painting Steve in an almost ethereal light. Tony shudders and digs his nails into Steve’s shoulder, closing his eyes.
Clint doesn’t try to scare anyone from the rafters.  Jan is strangely sullen, and hardly ever utters a word except to Hank when he comes out of his labs to drag her away every few hours or so. (They all pretend to not notice how each time she returns her eyes are red rimmed and she’s sniffling too loudly to be allergies.)
Somewhere in his mind he can hear the voice come back, whisper into the air her ancient wisdom and the prophetic words that have haunted him.
“And Loki?” Tony asks, trying to press on. He figured Loki helping out there was a pretty important fact.
In London, shoved beneath a pile of blankets in a spare room in Jane Foster’s apartment, Dr. Erik Selvig sneezes a whopping four times in a row. He looks around in a daze, but the light from outside shows no dust floating in any break of darkness from the blinds. Nothing but the falling mist of his sneezes.
So it’s not really a cup half-full or half-empty situation. More of a “I’m thirsty and you have water. Can I have it?” sort of things.
"Here, in this home," Pepper continues, "you have no footholds. You have no leverage. I am not Tony Stark. I am not... not a kidnapped man. Not a weapons maker. I am not a
"This is the man that singlehandedly began to dismantle the groups Stane had been selling weapons to. The man that broke several laws to bring weapons with his name, his
But that had been it. He was getting ready to tell them about—Siberia, Buck’s choice, T’Challa, and then Wanda had gone to rest and hadn’t woken up for longer than a few minutes
For some inexplicable reason, Tony wakes up from the hallucination in the exact position he was before he spaced out. It’s sure as hell a move up from spontaneous collapsing, though so who is he to complain? Not a lot of time has passed, either; the time of the videos still playing is only about five to six minutes ahead of where he had left off.
God, he can feel his own heart breaking. He can feel everything just slamming into him, months of denial and friendship so intertwined it was hard to try, too risky but Steve isn’t running away or punching him in the face so things are going good so far.
you’re sifting through all those files?” Rhodey continues blandly, looking up at the three projections FRIDAY has shifted forward once more. “Do you think there will be traces of Zemo’s methodology in there somewhere?”
Physical labor helped, somewhat. At least he was so tired he had to sleep at the end of the day. But it was the… the urge to keep moving. To not stay in one place. He didn’t want to leave Wanda, hell no, not after everything but… he didn’t want to
Blend in. Can’t be caught. She watches as families eat together, as travelers sit and soothe the heat with some horchata and Pepsi. They call her order so she smiles at the middle aged woman sitting next to her. With a nod towards her bag, the woman smiles back. When Natasha gets up to retrieve her order, she’s mapping a three-am hike to the mound perhaps between a light pole and the corner store’s camera, if she calculated correctly there would be a two-foot blind spot. The front door opens with a light bell ring.
mythology, to be frank,” Tony shrugs, leans forward, “this other world, though, Asgard, I have a battle buddy from there.” Tony grins as he props his head on his hand. “I think I’ll ask him. The Valkyrie, though, that’s an interesting point there. Swan-women that would take the souls of fallen warriors. Sveid was the Valkyrie associated with vibrations, so that’s the earthquakes,” Tony stops, thinks about the information given.
“And changed me?” Tony grins and Steve just huffs a breath and crosses his arms across his bare chest (oh, hello there) and tries to look indignant about this while failing miserably.
“No,” Wanda whispers, rubbing her eyes, “although sometimes I find that I may not understand my own powers, sometimes. Maybe I do.”
: married to Odin, step-mother to Thor and his bro's. Frigg means the “beloved one”, Frigg was associated with love, marriage, fertility, and motherhood. She was exceptional important to married woman. She had the power of prophecy yet she does not reveal what she knows. Frigg was the only one other than Odin who is permitted to sit on his high seat, and look out over the universe. The name of her house was Fensalir, the name means “marsh hall”. The woman would often go close to the wet marsh lands to worship Frigg.
Tony knew the destructive capacity he could unleash. Had he really wanted Bares dead? Could he really see his fury reflected on Steve’s face when he lowered the shied, when they’d both gouged at tge reactor on his chest and beat him between the two of them?
A burst of static erupts from the audio port of the Quinjet. Steve, standing beside Scott, startles. Scott raises an eyebrow at Steve, takes a swig of his water. It is late evening, almost night now; Wanda’s fever has abated at last, and they wait for any sign of lucidness before attempting to get her to eat a little, to rehydrate.
“T—y there’s something…. You to nee-- to see, it’s—I don’t…. I don’t know what it could….” The voice would blurt out through the tumult and commotion. It sounded a little like Peter, though much more hysterical; there was a loud crash in the background downing out the next few words until, suddenly, all the noises died down.
“No, yeah, it’s the best time, couldn’t have been a better time because Spiderman needs my help, called in, too, and you shouldn’t have left me it the tower, what kind of a—anyway, I’m on my way to Spidey’s signal and I just really need the 4-1-1 on what the hell is going on, since some mother hen decided that my place is in the home. Thank you for that. Really.” Tony rolls his eyes, can see the smoke rising in the distance and swallows a little thickly.
“Jar-Jarvis, what time is it?” Tony mumbles, pressing back into the comfortable heat and turning to face the open space beyond his bed, eyes still shut.
“Wait,” the young man instructs, raising his palm in the same motion. The young man paused for a second before reaching behind them over the center console to pull out a large black shirt. He tosses it at her without a word and then shifts to shuffle among the garbage and random items on the floor of the back seats. “Alright, look, if you want to hear what these people say you’re gonna have to change. It’s not your size but ‘dirty hitchhiker’ is not the kind of person that gets people to talk to them about stuff like this.”
Then, almost, the sound of… wings? Natasha looks up quickly, unfurling from where she was curled around her bag, sleeping.
Remember how Ross was a hard-ass at the beginning of Infinity War with Rhodey? I actually liked that. I'm keeping that.
Tony nods in affirmation and finishes his cup, refills it and makes his way back to the lab downstairs. “Lights at sixty three percent” he orders smoothly, making his way past chrome fixtures. The lights brighten and Tony deposits his cup on one of the emptier counters, licks his lips of all residues and makes his way to the main workbench.
"Force of...habit." Tony grinds out between clenched teeth, looking up at the sky rather than at Steve,
No one answers Steve. He hadn’t expected anyone to, anyway. Months of asking himself the same questions have never lead to any answers, anyway.
“You weren’t the first to contact me.” Tony states and Idonae flushes slightly, eyes trained on the golden apple between her thighs.
One hand on the steering wheel, Natasha thinks, but the car is driving off the cliff. There is no control, is there, only the illusion of it? Her eyes track the last tear as it travels down the woman’s wrinkled cheek. She imagines Charlie Spencer’s mom looked the same, too.
Pepper huffs, "with, what was it, a taunt? 'Tony Stark not recommended'." She rolls her eyes. "You're actually lucky I have directives in case you did appear. Otherwise, had it been up to me..."
“It. Yeah, yeah, that’s probably for the best.” Tony looks at Rhodey’s incredulous expression before giving an affronted look, “first of all, I need sleep, and a shower, and to never,
thing, stupid pompous pricks." Tony growls out and Steve hears the thud of his head hitting the door frame.
retaliation for that idiot’s actions, and we don’t know if they’re just another loon looking for some fancy tech to weaponize. You don’t go out there to meet whoever’s been lurking in the peripherals. There must be a reason why they’re not approaching, anyway. Hell, they might just
“A hero is not a winner; not the victor of a battle,” The voice points out. “A legacy does not make a hero; the situation does. I know you, Young Stark. In my arms are the souls of a million soldiers lost at war and they are not all heroes. A hero does not have to be heroic, nor honest; not all martyrs are heroes.”
After a second, Tony moves; feels the harsh drag of Steve inside of him and plunges down again, moaning against Steve’s lips. Tony’s name escapes Steve like a blessing, a benediction and Tony closes his eyes to the image of Steve staring at him with so much
She moves slowly to press their foreheads together. Steve’s mind is still reeling, he can’t grasp her meaning, can’t—
“Steve,” Tony whispers numbly, bloodied hand clenching on the small, broken cube. “I’m sorry.” Tony’s steady hand moves slowly, skims along the hem of his musky shirt and begins to slide up the plains of his stomach. “I am so sorry, Steve” Tony repeats and Steve is silent and alarmed, completely thrown off.
“We,” Wanda croaks and sets off a set of coughs that make startle the two other men. “We need to go.” Wanda is sitting up slowly, weak by fatigue and dehydration. She reaches for the bottle by her side and downs it; the warm water is like heaven to her dry throat.
They meet eyes, Steve taking in the swirl of emotions in those expressive dark eyes before grinding out," please, stay." The man hesitates for a heart wrenching moment before nodding and taking Steves hand in his.
So of course they clash. More often than not when they're together, they're fighting and when they're fighting their typically across each other, face to face, eye to eye and spiting venom at each other like one of those vipers that slipped through one fo those experimental portals to Asgard Jane is so fond of opening. Tony gets this glint in his eyes that's fierce and strong that shows what kind of a man he really is (under that 'tough guy, fast cars hard brandy' exterior everyone is blind sighted by). He's determined and wiser and tactful, he knows just what to do, what words to say and he won't back down from a challenge.
She sounds so soft, so warm, like a cool summer day, like a bed of flowers, a cloud. Otherworldly; ethereal. Her name is at the tip of his tongue. He cannot speak, though; Tony is trapped in this cocoon of warmth and darkness.
was a goddess who guarded the apples of youth. Idun had long golden hair and was the goddess of spring and eternal youth. She supplied the gods with the apples of youth, to keep them forever young.
Tony wraps his arms around himself, and doesn’t listen as FRIDAY raises the temperature in the room, reminds him to call Pepper, Spider-Man, reminds him of the growing folders on his server. Ant-Man. The Pym-Van Dynes. SHIELD Dump folders. Peter’s updates. Amendments to the Accords. A list of the things the UN and the US are prodding for. A message from T’Challa.
an IV line had been connected to him. The itch of the punctures was incorrigible. He aches to get back to the facility.
“Thank you” Steve breathed out, trying his hardest not to smile. Hank gave him a little nod and a look, the same look Pepper would give him whenever he tried to make Tony remember that he was human and that billionaire-playboy-philanthropist-body of his had basic needs. It made Steve want to squirm but his soldier instincts battled the impulse down and he turned away, a sigh heavy on his lips.
remain. And now, because of their antics, the world has tightened it’s hold on the powered-population.”
By the time Steve finds the attention to come back to the predicament Tony sighs and closes his eyes, the sight of them turning back into their natural color from the strange concoction of sapphire and emerald from before is comforting and frightening all in one. Tony’s body slumps forward and Steve remains still, shell-shocked and confused.
and Steve’s shouting at Tony but he only distantly hears it over the rush of blood in his ears and the painful
The next page he took from what he dubbed the “not useless trash” pile was a little more lucid.  It had a pattern, almost an exact duplicate of the one on the illustration of the cube, and some notes beneath the intricate drawing. “Wishes come true, though the very fabric of reality is altered. The complexities of granting a single desire may lead to the unraveling of the universe itself, causing an inter-dimensional ripple through time, space, matter and energy. This, however, is one of the safety features of the ––––––––– is to make the desire come true without necessarily unraveling the cosmos, thus some input may not be followed through in its entirety.”
“If it’s the one that you want then endear; it’s the final pleasure before the end that final level you must ascend. Valhalla nears with each breath; a final treat before death.”
“I have a question…” Tony trails off, scanning the area for heat signatures. The cold spots are the spirit things… Landvættirs or what-not, and there’s no heat signature on the fallen tree.
Fury looks over the chart, eying the symptoms Tony had listed while conscious. Looks over the medical notes: small hairline fractures, splints of false sternum, arm pain and numbness. Eying some of the small notes, Fury sees that someone had made some footnotes on their own: nightmares. Paranoia. Anxiety attacks. Feeling of being watched paired with misremembered events. Trouble keeping thoughts in line. Forgetting what he was saying as he spoke and moving onto tangents without noticing. Confusion.
He shouldn’t have come alone. He should have brought someone to help, although considering their ranks he would be doing the heavier lifting anyway.
“Yes, positive. None of the guards were severely hurt and there has yet to be an official APV within the states for the fugitive Avengers. It seems Ross is trying to play this close to his chest.” Tony keeps his head tilted back, groans, and waits a few more seconds.
Silence fills the room. Rhodey bites his tongue to swallow the questions he wants to ask, but Ross. Ross smirks. Grins. Nods.
Tags will be updated as they go, and yes that relationship tag is slow burn. Also, this is compliant to all movies except, you know, actual Avengers: Infinity Wars Part I.
There are four guards and two people waiting at the landing pad, and although Steve recognizes T’Challa’s form, he notes that Shuri is not the one with him but another young woman. As the Quinjet lands, Steve takes the moment everyone starts to rush their exit to take a breath for himself, steel his shoulders and raise his chin.
“No duro, entiende, ese material se quebra fácilmente,” the woman warns and Natasha knows then. “Mi sobrino lo obtuvo durante esos primeros días, mientras que muchos se los estaban llevaron por sí mismos.”
“Okay, you know what this deserves a talk, a nice long talk but I can’t do this from here and maybe a few coffees would help and my mind isn’t too far into the gutter because I kind of just want to crawl into bed or let you crawl over me and do unspeakable, maybe illegal things but I can’t function properly when it’s so early so can you give me a hand because I may have possibly broken my spine” Tony grumbles and Steve’s face would be priceless, really, if Tony had more brain cells to spare right now.
The first sheet of paper is just a few equations; the rate of change of the explosive level of some sort of strange element he can’t even make out—the molecular structure drawn is completely surreal. The next sheet is blank but crumpled nonetheless, and almost all the sheets are just as this one, he realizes, bunching them into two separate piles.
He hadn’t looked at the cellphone in his torn jean pockets since the morning when he first left a few hours ago, had seen the battery wink at him with only 17% left, and decided that it would need all the juice it could store for the foreseeable future. He doesn’t want to think about the past. Like the Valkyrie, like Bucky, it was something to leave, frozen and stagnant in his past.
The sidewalk leading up to the bulbous mound was paved with photos of missing loved ones assumed to be within the mass. Flowers and old candles take up most of the sidewalk, so the street had been closed in a single to two block radius where people walked.
Ross looks at the three men sitting around the table for a few moments. Vision, sitting across from Tony, does not react to their eyes meeting. Tony and Rhodey, sitting next to each other to Ross’s right-hand side, are sitting slightly back with their hands on the table, waiting.
“I’ll be fine. Go up ahead; need to, uh… restore the system for the armor so that I can walk out of here in more than a torn up shirt and some old jeans, looks bad for team publicity.” Tony mutters as he sits up, clicking the gauntlets back into place. Steve nods, replaces his cowl and sluggishly steps to the gaping doorway and into the hall.
It’s as if they’ve become absorbed in some kind of vacuum: the hum of the electric systems mutes, and the sound of their breathing is gone; the lights all flicker and fail at the same time.
“The Tesseract is more than power,” Loki hisses as they rattle in the Quinjet. “It’s more or less the equivalent of a genie in a bottle; it sees your wishes, your wants and desires and warps the world around them. Your conviction must be as strong as iron and unbendable like the mountains. If your wish is possible then the Tesseract can make it true, will bend the cosmos to your will. It is energy and truth.”
“The most temperamental, emotional response for… the members would be to go somewhere to regroup. The construction of the country is still underway, with spots around considered inhospitable to citizens. Anonymity. Without their Avengers identity, the citizens may not even know who they are.” Vision has not looked away, but Tony has closed his eyes. Ross nods, says a few parting words in thanks and leaves with his cell phone attached to his ear, barking out orders even as he leaves.
“—yeah, sure, lets go with that, I’ll let you slide this once,” Rhodey points at Tony and then at Vision, who startles at being at the end of such an angry, menacing finger, “but don’t
He’d fought them. Had turned and smacked Steve across he face, taken Barnes and… but he’d tried to stop Steve. And—Steve, with three punches, had disabled his flight ability, had chosen Barnes—
Tony mumbles something under his breath. It sounds suspiciously like the ‘thank you’ he hadn’t meant to let slip, and –oh, there’s the snaky little hand that fell atop of Steve’s reassuring hold on his good shoulder. His head is bowed down, heavy with sleeplessness, the weight of the medication and the soothing alleviation from the balm is forcing his senses to surrender to the darkness. Surrender to the visions.
“The town’s news channel is bustling with reports of light creatures and small quakes despite being told that the seismograph has recorded nothing alarming nor over the norm. I do believe this is a sign of magical interference in the natural order of the city. Would you like me to get your suit ready for travel, sir?”
He spoke like he was enamored with the eccentric genius despite a handful of meetings and awkward greetings\confrontations. Things between himself and the enigmatic CEO had become stranger after that, knowing now that he had practically spilled his heart out to Tony while in disguise made the whole situation make sense but at the time it all just seemed incredibly connected yet not connected at all.
“—or call us cautious, but the point remains that someone capable of making and maintaining a suit like Scott Lang’s being unaccounted for is stressing some people that don’t like to be stressed. The Accords are international, yes, but this is pushing some people to make their moves to create something at home.”
Clint and Sam are in the hangar while Wanda tries to come up with a way to explain herself. She can’t tell them that Vision warned her—in a dream, no less, but it’s the closest explanation she can come up with herself. She’s bundled in the same ratty old blanket she’d had in the bed as Scott leans back, allowing himself to be her leaning pillar.
They've gotten to the only wall still left standing. Fury hears it, then, the sound of machines slowly beeping. The whirr of electric lungs. The smell of sterilized air is stronger, more pungent. He has a suspicion, now, but the distance between Point A and Point B is a long one, and he needs the information before he can surrender to his gut instinct.
you, that what you want the most belongs to me,” Loki grins, tongue pressing against his front teeth, head cocked slightly to the right, towards Thor. “And you will never gain it, and it will never be yours because
The morning comes in with slow observations and sensory information; there are no lights in the room other than the ever present dull, white-blue shine of the arc reactor. Just below eye level, a furnace wrapped tightly across his back and a distinct lack of blankets that leaves him just this side of chilly.
Tony’s body feels icy, a painful sort of numb that intensifies with each movement. “Protect them, protect him,” Tony thinks like a mantra, a creed. He places the reactor down, ejects the functioning core and shoves the Tesseract in with the final vestiges of his strength. A bloody hand wraps around the core and Tony looks up for the briefest of moments to look into Steve’s wide blue eyes.
Before he stops himself, Steve says "call me Steve". There's a terse moment of silence between them before Tony's lips quirk into a small smile.
“Maybe there is just more to what people do than standard patterns and common sense,” Rhodey muses, “after all, no one would have expected what—"
Peter was on the ceiling, in his more modern black and white costume, slowly edging towards the two. The woman, thankfully, had her back against the two; she was tall, like most Asgadians, with long blonde hair billowing behind her, outstretched hands aimed towards the torn screen, a swirling portal right in the epicenter. She grunted, made a loud cry and pushed forward with her palms forward and
“Not so,” Vision nods, but looks pensive. Tony looks at him and then thumps his head once more on the wall.
happens,” Tony says, “you let me know immediately. Viz, I’m expecting updates, sir, because we may be able to do something so for now I’m not touching anything related to them.” No one mentions that Tony hasn’t actually said their names the entire conversation long. Tony feels his infinite love for these two incomparable beings grow slightly. “Before you go, though, I’m going to fix whatever god-awful sound your braces are making, and we’re going to look at your current gauntlet watches that

“Top left corner, forty-five degree angle,” Hope says, and knows when the man looks because of the faint curse they hear from across the door. “As a tip, you’re supposed to show your badge or you’re entrapping, and my father is far too old and too incapacitated to understand what is going on or what you’re asking of him. Great, we have a sign warning that the premises are under surveillance—” no doubt she had the ants on it before even stepping up to the threshold because
“You want to understand why… why Lang just came. Why the same guy that robbed the facility and made Sam look like an idiot would just pop into your suit and try to take you down.”
, and then ran off on a mission of his own. The past and the future. Somewhere there’s a whisper of a memory, of Steve standing with the ruins of Tony’s betrayal, promising
"No...'thank you'?" Tony teases. "No, don't worry I fully understand." Tony Mock-pouts through the pain.
Tony feels a little more than human when he finally returns to the basement workshop. He’d managed to wash off without wetting or irritating his chest and changed into warmer clothes before finally relenting and returning. Rhodey is already there, talking to Friday with three wrist watches projected next to him.
“There was a call for the Avengers but, since you didn’t come to the hangar, they sent me to find you. Imagine my surprise when I found you collapsed.” Steve’s following chuckle was dry and forced; Tony winced and sighed.
But it begs him every night, and the more he tries to remember what he sees and hears but the more he remembers the more he forgets.
...She hands him a golden apple. Silence spreads as the blue skies begin to bleed across the graying fields.
Fury agrees. Nothing makes people scared than being scared shitless by those sworn to protect them suddenly accepting
Tony opens his eyes. His head hurts and his eyes sting; the principle attack to the back of his head and temple throb and (what Tony assumes is) blood runs down his forehead and into his eyes. His arms are shackled and connected to the floor by a two-foot long chain heavier than Tony can lift. His body is slightly curled inwards, arms bracketed together and extended further from his body. He hears someone in the near vicinity but it’s too dark to see and his head is aching, throbbing, hurting.
See? A pattern. Easy: climb up, find things, hide them away in your heart; be disheartened. Let down. Freeze. Throw it all away. Thaw. Repeat.
had on the brains of soldiers. I'm not the man that sought out mentally unstable assassins and spies and tried to keep them to a single-minded loyalty. I'm not the man whose agency was infiltrated by their worse enemies. Neither am I the man that would allow dangerous and completely insufficiently researched agents remain on the field. I'm not the man that figured a couple hundred dead agents meant nothing as long as the truth would be revealed.
. Wanda doesn’t wait around to hear their next exchange, mind looping through the thought of family. She wonders why her mind strays from Pietro into a shorter cut of shocking white hair. A jaw squared with age, and that same name repeating over the pain of Pietro leaving her.
What the hell do you mean ‘figure out what we’ll do next’ because I have parole, you know, and a daughter.” Sam relents and releases a sound somewhere between a question mark and an exclamation. He sounds pained.
him, though, and half of the Avengers are here already, watching them or looking away. Tony realizes quite suddenly what’s going to happen, and in clear picture too.
an irritating voice that sounds like He-Who-Will-Not-Be-Named says in the back of Tony’s mind, and Tony chokes on what he was going to actually say.
century; the man that gave him a home when home was 70 years in the past; the man that infuriated him, challenged him. Tony was the man that was too familiar, a slice of the past dipped in gold and cherry-red; Tony was the past mixed with the present, like a strange mixture of Howard’s brains, Peggy’s resilience and bravery, Bucky’s self-sacrificing, martyr ways and just—
“I came in and you were collapsed on the ground, so I’m guessing that you don’t know how that happened.” Steve looks a little less wary and more annoyed now. Tony grunts and nods, trying to sit up. Steve helps by placing his other hand on Tony’s shoulder and hefting him up by the shoulders, aiding Tony until the other man is sitting up, albeit leaning on Steve more than relying on his own strength.
Steve looks at the clock. Knowing Tony, and how forgetful the man can be, he pads barefoot into the kitchen to prepare something to eat to take to the eccentric billionaire.
--but remembered the last used page of Tony in a disheveled tuxedo, looking quite downcast yet equally serene and blushed so hard his face felt on fire before hightailing it completely.
The night paints a different but still beautiful picture of Wakanda. The stars that set the night sky ablaze bring a fierce parallel to the blend of technology and nature of the country. Everyone gives some remark when they pass through the barrier, and Steve had almost forgotten just how striking the city looked and took a moment, too, to let his gaze follow the lights of the nightlife shine against the sky, gleam against the leaves.
It should appear that the Avengers had already quarantined the city before the actual fight. Most of the buildings are already broken down and decayed beyond reasonable living. The sidewalks where cracked where tree roots had breached the surface and weeds where growing in the asphalt. A few more steps and he’d be in the scrambler zone.
“—akanda, I told you,” Steve says with a heavy sigh, slumped forward with his elbows braced on his knees. Sam throws his hands up in frustration and turns around. Scott looks thoughtful as he looks between the two. Wanda wonders just how in the world she slept through whatever got them to this point. Scott spares her a glance before he looks back at Steve with a growing look of wonder on his face.
"Yes," Pepper answers simply, and continues to walk with the clear intention of having Fury follow her. Fury, both a little amazed and worried at the sudden changes in demeanor, follows silently, knowing that no immediate threat follows.
Tony and Steve laughing together on the third floor entertainment room while they try to catch him up on movies and culture.
, I know just how you are and you’ll always need to hear it. I’ll tell you in the mornings when you wake up and can’t think without  your twelve cups of coffee; I’ll tell you when you call me out for being too overbearing and I’ll tell you in the nights when it’s just us two.”
have, and then Stark and SHIELD just gouged away at him until he was left the, apparently, “unfriendly, cranky, asshole” of an old man he was now.
When the woman turns to Natasha, Natasha clears her throat. “Puedo ver?” she asks, motioning to the items. The woman gives an affirmative and Natasha slides off her stool to look at the trinkets better and with a finer eye for details.
“Good, I have no idea what the hell is going on but Asgardian versus Asgardian never ends well; it’s like reading Superman verses Wonder Woman: terrifying, hot, but destructive nonetheless.” Peter whines, using his infinite wisdom of fictional graphic novels as the perfect leeway.
, and the arm that reaches for the door is trembling slightly. The bones are mostly healed, aching like crazy.
They’re somewhere on the outskirts of a small, New York city. The people in the town number somewhere in the thousands, all knowing of their neighbors in such an enclosed, small space.
, you let us know,” Clint took a step closer, placed his hand on the crook of Steve’s arm. Steve looked up and they met eyes. “Anything, Steve. We deserve to know.”
"You think someone is going to read the signatures and follow them here," Pepper surmises after a brief pause. Fury sighs.
unhappy to be carting around Fury of all people, but when Pepper had nodded her head he had dipped his in response and they were off.
. “Look man, if it’ll make you feel better then I’m all game, but your shaggy lookin’ ass is going to have to get some rest before we start looking—”
“Tony!” Someone shouts and Tony jumps, has a little moment where he’s suspended in a violent, defensive mind-set before realizing that a) he’s not in bed, b) he’s in his lab, no longer looking over this desolate landscape and c) Steve is looking fretful and fearful,  kneeling beside Tony’s head with a warm hand on his shoulder.
He also knows how useless and destructive waking Tony up can be so Steve grabs a hold of the clenched fist, runs a hand through Tony’s sweat-matted hair and sighs.
"Ma'am," He says softly, keeping his head bowed. The woman laughs and the hall seems to lighten with her cheerful mirth.
“Is this a meeting,” Tony says after a second, “or is this an inquiry? I was told by the Accords Council that my actions in Siberia were going to be held as my statement and that no repercussions would come of my impromptu investigation. You, Secretary Ross, are not in control of the Accords Council, nor are you privy to information that belongs to the UN.”
This time, When Idonae hands Tony the golden fruit, he raises it to his lips and bites, the indentation of teeth giving way to the exposed cream-white interior of the fruit.  A question plays on his lips, a silent inquiry his companion answers with a smile and a tear.
But this isn't what he's expecting, to be honest, and being caught blindsided by a lack of information is starting to grate on him.
“…nah,” Tony says at least, putting the pin between his lips to shift another fragment of the brace. “I juss wunna no wha ails iss au-dere.” He slots the pin back into a different slot. “All of this information was just…. Out there. And Zemo may have had a single-minded purpose to find whatever he needed, but he is not the only one.”
Fantastic. People don’t just throw around “genius” for no reason, anyway; Tony’s good at thinking up plans. If he needs Thor to return for more than the God will be none the wiser—he wouldn’t see through Tony’s ruse.
“But that’s it, right, that’s the worse of it all?” Tony mumbles, rubbing the arc reactor through the sweater. The cold sting of the zipper centers him, if only for a few more moments. “No countries on fire, no new disasters?”
So, you know, no biggie. Only Tony had no idea what the hell the thing actually did other than contain a vast wealth of limitless energy. So far, it seemed as if Asgardian materials worked well when it came to holding the cube but, according to Steve, the Tesseract had eroded the steel of the aircraft. So, something resilient and otherworldly?
“I swear it’s not--” Tony starts and Steve’s incredulous huff throws him off. “I don’t know.” He pauses. “Is that what you want to hear? I don’t know. Hank doesn’t know—he says that the only change in my physical reactions is a little disorientation. I don’t know what the hell is going on with me.” Tony’s teeth are gritting and he straightens up, fists clenched and shaking at his sides.
“Tony,” Steve pants, feels Tony’s ass press down against him, the throbbing heat tense and relax. “Tony, turn on the lights, bring ‘em back on.”
“There was something found in the electronic surveillance,” Ross starts, “we never lost visuals, of course, but the audio became warped. Odd, you see, and who should be in the room but Tony Stark, showing something to Sam Wilson. Now, without audio feeds, we don’t
"So is that what this is?" Pepper asks at last, her gaze just this side of sharp, too keen to be ignorant of... of what? It irks Fury, not knowing.
“I never thought I could make it on time, though.” Frigga continues. “Amora’s intentions and all the omens I saw, they left me weak. I do heartily apologize for the worry I caused you when I would speak to Antony.” Frigga pauses, and continues, slightly bitter, “I knew he was the one, though, and I do not have any regrets. Quite the smart boy, I admit, and it pains me to admit that the visions I
It had clearly been assimilated into the city, at least, with vendors lined over the smoothed mound of what looked like… igneous rock, like a volcano erupted in the middle of the city, encasing a good maybe block or block and a half.
Steve huffs as he throws himself on the ground, the last slab of concrete sliding off into a pile where the rest he had moved were stacked. At least some of the, or what he assumed to be, supermarket was somewhat intact beneath the mixed crushed remains of the other three quarters. He stayed like that for a second, just breathing.
“The first noted change in your psyche, according to my analysis of your behavioral traits, attitude, gestures, norms; quirks, gesticulations, and idiosyncrasies occurs at nineteen-oh-five; there are a total of forty-seven strange incidences in physical manifestation, eighteen audio incongruities that are being evaluated and secured for better listening; it appears that you had collapsed at twenty-seventeen and hadn’t woken until Captain Rogers entered the lab.”
“I choose you because you are a hero. You will sacrifice yourself for others, and in doing so you are selfless and noble. A lifetime does not define you; a situation does. And what is life but the careful management of a succession of situations?”
He stood for a moment, inexplicably nervous, a sinking feeling growing in his stomach and the words that came to his mind where far-off, like from a distant memory or a half-remembered dream.
“What do you care?” Amora spits out, staggering to the door heading into the other room. “All these times you’ve come to linger in Midgard, you have never once tried to
“Tony! You’re awa--” And Tony can’t help but feel a wave of relief when Steve’s face drops into something more akin to confused, then panic and finally closes off completely. “Who are you? What did you do to Tony!” Steve commands, his grasp tightening on Tony’s wrist.
“I may be able to help with this,” A new voice says over the speakers. Wanda and Steve both recoil while Scott looks up in wonder.
Steve gets up quickly, dusting off his hands on his pants. There hadn’t been too much they could take before T’Challa had swapped into silence, but at least the few amenities had been worthwhile. He climbs down to where a few scattered bottles of water are littered with rotting chips and stale food. The smell is somewhere between rot and destruction.
” Tony finally voices, not stepping near the illusion. The silence across the link is very reassuring.
“I haven’t seen anything like it,” Sam says, “well, not, I mean.” He huffs out a breath, the weight of the past few weeks weighing on him harder. He doesn’t even know who is at the door, only knows that it opened and shut and, besides a step or two behind him, nothing.
The chunk of wood is thrown of its rusting rusted hinges and Tony curses when the tell-tale shine of emerald body armor glints in the blaring hot afternoon sunlight. He looks up into her hazy green eyes and thinks, not for the first time, that he was too late.
“Uh, no that will… no thank you, Jarvis,” Steve stammers and Tony would find the energy to chortle at that if he hadn’t just been, you know, sort of rubbing himself all up on the guy like a lazy cat in the sun. Mortification will come later, though, because Tony knows himself and if there is something more important to him than feeling embarrassed it’s his curiosity.
It was one last thing to see. And then she could focus all her energy on dodging Ross and keeping herself busy.
When Thor grabs him and forces him onto the platform and Selvig shouts," I hope this works!" as they're engulfed in a bright blue light, well, Steve thinks he might have to reconsider his thoughts on the scientist.
One hour turns to three. Then five, and then Peter is switching off with Steve, telling him that Jarvis is running over a thousand video scans and all he needs to wait for is an alert.
The available Avengers are all assembled in SHIELD HQ within half an hour of Jarvis sounding the alarm. With most agents and Avengers out doing damage control, Steve and Peter are the only two available agents to find Thor and Tony. Fury, though understanding, is adamant that they work on finding the two as soon as possible with their available resources.
No, seriously, he was. Ask Jan; it was life and his bountiful years of living it that began to wear down the bit of patience he
“Then you grab whoever is nearest to you,” Pepper says slowly, “and you beat it into their heads so nicely they can’t help but spread the word. Tony will be taking an… administrative role, for a while, in order to stop rumors of his new suit from getting out too fast. We need to get a hold of the narrative while we can and rewrite the script entirely. Of course, your merry band of idiots made that a whole lot harder than it
“Sorry…” Steve mumbles, hand still extended towards the burn. “You just have to take the shirt off, then, since you’re being a baby about me trying to examine the burn--”
They fade away into oblivion. All that exists in this moment, for right now is Steve’s warmth, the hot, slick kisses and the explosive pleasure crackling up their spines, exploding as fireworks in their mind.
“This is great in one respect, and saddening in another; to leave a love behind and still unite two lovers.” Idonae looks genuinely saddened at this and casts her eyes down to her apples. Tony smiles bitterly and sits cross-legged and clad in the gauntlets ad boots of his armor; his worn-out jeans rustle when he sits and his Black Sabbath tee scrunches a bit.
“I can, can we do this later?” Tony whispers, still sore and aching. “Not trying to be so dismissive but my shoulder feels like it wants to expulse the bone through the muscle and skin and, yeah,
FRIDAY was having trouble listing out the order in which Zemo had found them. The timeline to his revenge was sketchy at best and there seemed no traces of the information gathering Zemo had done to get
For a moment, it’s all Tony can do to stand there without panicking but the tranquility remains within him despite the morose words and the nightmarish surroundings. The apple winks up at him and he stares at it in return, unsure but still unafraid.
“That’s an Accords issue, this is a United States Government issue. You see, the Raft was a SHIELD stronghold, and when SHIELD fell, it became property of the Department of Defense.” Ross places both hands flat on the table, staring gravely at Tony, then Vision. “Enemies of the State were kept in that prison; people with powers that have attacked innocent cities that were lost in the hub-bub of more global threats. I can tell you right now, Senator Kelly
“Yes, sir. I understand your request. I will have a complete time table ready in a few minutes, sir.”
“What, what the hell are you doing in my bed?” Tony stammers and, hell, he’s classier than this. It must be a morning thing, if anything at all. Steve is all rumpled nervousness and blushing cheeks and bright blue eyes like woah-and-damn because he’s a damn boy-scout and Tony is sprawled across the soft beige carpet like a cheap porno bottom, legs spread open, shirt hiked up and sweatpants (oh my god he wasn’t wearing these last night what even is Steve, honestly) too low on his hips.
His eyes are drawn to the older woman sitting on a seat amongst other women to the side of the room. She looks weary, hair flowing loose and curled down the expanse of her shoulders. Her dress is white, long and flowing down past her feet with a single golden hemline wrapped around her waist and trailing down further than the bottom of her dress. She looks inelegant in comparison to the other women beside her and even those dining and milling about.
“I’ve, I mean, not intimately, or anything, but I think I’ve seen something like this before,” Scott says after a few seconds. He walks closer to Sam and becomes a light presence by his side. Sam thinks he can smell him getting closer and sighs again.
“Tony!” Steve grins, but the smile falters when Tony mutters a low ‘sorry’ and moves the cuff quickly, the chains rattling obscenely in the ensuing silence only to click into place.
“Captain, may I suggest you keep identities under wraps?” Came Natasha’s cold, clinical voice over the brief silence. “Ironman said that he was entering the scrambled zone so he won’t hear you, anyway.” Natasha reminds blandly. “I met up with Thor, we’re nearing the theatre Ironman and Spiderman entered, we’re behind you, and so you can go ahead and get to him.”
A pause, and then Steve continues. “Is… is it presumptuous? To think that you’ll keep wanting me, actually
Amora shares that look now, of unbridled rage and fear and hatred. The cube lies on the ground a few feet away where it’s been uncloaked. Her hand shakes, bruises and burns running up the long expanse of her arms. Her lip is busted, bleeding a steady stream down her chin and there’s the faint blossom of bruises on her neck and clavicle where Loki had his hand wrapped firmly in a strangle.
—gone. And she knew she had no reason, shouldn’t have had the audacity to ask but she had to. She let Fury know through whatever channels she could. So here she was, awaiting a response to reach her before she got out of state.
Besides, it was probably nothing anyway. Just her own way of making an excuse to stay around as long as she possibly could.
Maybe it’s worse than death, remaining to walk across the charred remains of pastures; the rubble of large cities or the scrapped remains of a once great civilization have become the mass graves of humanity. Nature is either running rampant or completely obliterated in areas and roses and vines rise in reparation, like flowers on a grave, through old sidewalks and crawl up high, abandoned skyscrapers.
“I am… a delivery girl, for now.” The voice says with slight hesitation. “I have to recede, but I know you’ll know when you see it.”
They look almost ice-blue. In her mind, she hears Strucker's last words and can almost imagine them on Clint's tongue something like
,” Hank starts, and chooses to ignore Hope’s smirk as she walks past him to the hallway. He knows it’s because she wants to speak securely, maybe check to make sure that the agent did leave. He huffs but follows after a few seconds pause—he is
. But the words had taken a second to translate and she didn’t think before reacting facially, at least.
“I do not owe them anything,” Vision begins, eyes darting forward once more. “Just as they felt no need to think about who they hurt or lied to. I do not owe my allegiance to… them.” Tony swallows, taps a little faster. They begin their trek to the conference room once more, slower. “I understand that it may be strange for you to hear this, but you have been… incapacitated for some time, and for you the Accords and Siberia were only days ago. Colonel Rhodes and I have had more time to deal with this, and the council. If something takes you off guard, we can take over.”
The only odd thing is how, whenever mentioned, Thor vehemently protests the announcement of his death and the passing of the company officially to Pepper. No one understands his reasoning and they tend to let him rant as he pleases but it’s been a week.
Steve gives Tony a pointed look that’s more hurt than anything and any retort is swallowed by the look, “and although I know you’re the kind of guy that doesn’t want to bother others with his own problems, or you’d rather ignore them until they pass but this, this that’s going on right now, this isn’t something you can just sit out. It’s affecting you and it’s affecting the missions--”
Tony snorts and Rhodey feels his breathing get a little lighter. It had been tough holding the fort, keeping Vision busy, Ross busy, Pepper focused, and trying to focus on his own physical therapy while ignoring how he woke up from nightmares in cold sweat and the swoop in his stomach of
“Nah, I’ll go see him myself.” Tony gets up, stretches his shoulders and cracks his back. “I hate sitting around, anyway. Thanks, Jarvis”
” Steve asks when he enters because it’s black and white and there’s a man crying with books surrounding him. Peter murmurs something that should be a title and Steve, as it turns out, is too tired for this too so he nudges the younger Avenger and plops down between Tony and Peter with a huff.
“Loki--” Amora starts and turns towards Loki, unbeknownst to the arachnid-man that is cautiously approaching her and unseeing of Ironman coming down the left isle.
is going to die to save the world isn’t the bitterest pill Tony has to swallow. It’s the idea that he would do it,
“And if he finds them?” Rhodey argues back, “if he comes back with some hint of Siberia, it won’t be so easy to try to fix.”
Captain?” Pepper scoffs, pulls back her shoulders. Here, now, her voice does not waver. She’s returning to her persona, hardening her skin.
“Is that why you have an ever-growing list of information on… Scott Lang and the Pyms-Van Dynes? Because no offence, but that doesn’t fall in line at all with what you’re saying.”
"Is that all your Agent told you?" Pepper inquires. She seems less sardonic, more curious now. Fury shrugs.
Natasha begins to reach out her hand to feel the ashy surface, the uneven cut of each hand made rosary bead. And this woman, her nephew had just taken a piece, maybe a few pieces during the first few days when no one knew who to send and so no one was there.
—and then he makes his way back to the surveillance room. Hope is sitting in front of a monitor, her hands still wrapped from where she was working out in another room. She looks a little weary, and Hank still needs to give Scott one good licking before he can even see Hope for the far-off look to her eyes.
“Steven,” She greets. “Raise your head, young man.” Steve does what he is told and finds the woman kneeled before him as well, eyes searching his gaze for something. He doesn’t officially know who this woman is, though, is acting on basic instinct and so far it’s working.
“I could only surmise,” Vision cuts in before the situation escalates. Tony sits back and lets Vision take over this one. He closes his eyes and promises to stay awake during this bit. “It is simple, James,” Vision only smiles when Rhodey mouths ‘James’ like it is another odd nickname, “Ross gets to look like he is, as it is said, ‘on their tail’, and will separate himself from us for some time while he follows whatever trail he can scrape up.”
“I’ll tell you what,” a new voice chimes in, “you can leave my father’s front porch, or I can start sending this video to every person’s newsfeed and you
illegally. Weapons manufacturing is a morally ambiguous market; a market that, Tony realized, did more harm than good. He checked himself, his own company, and took all those weapons out of everyone's hands.
and that would be the worse part of it all, wouldn’t it? Steve will know how Tony’s really heartless, see the scars and know that the guilt that falls on Tony’s shoulders is etched in his skin. He’s going to shy away, he’s going to look away and pretend to have not seen a thing because the scars are testament to how cold and
“She enchanted them, or something,” Tony rasps, looking down. “I think you need to leave, she might--” the sounds of shouting and fighting reach them from across the thin wooden panels of a wall. “--
count as spoilers. I think this is actually even just mentioned in the trailer and then re-imagined here.
The air smells like ozone and amaranths. Steve feels like throwing up. Peter is saying something to him, pressing a hand against the already healing burn marks on Steve’s wrist.
Having someone in your mind, fiddling about isn’t as odd as Tony would like to think. When she let’s go of his hands, he realizes just how lonely a busy mind can feel.
The hallway is empty, save for a few framed sketches and charcoal drawings that are framed and hanging off the eggshell-white walls. The lights are off and all that resounds and reverberates though the vacancy is the
“Idonae,” Tony whispers, feels it on his lips and tongue like something sweet, like fragrant apples. The maiden smiles and raises her arms back into their original position; she freezes, pale skin shifting into a gray-white flow that starts at her chest and spreads through her body like an infection. Her eyes are kind, though, filled with something akin to yearning and a touch of familiarity as they turn blue then harden with the same substance flirting with marble but smoother, milkier.
them, it’s for Sokovia. For Vienna. For New York, and London. Its for that little city that didn’t get its ten minutes on the news. It’s for—"
“Esta bien si lo toco?” Natasha asks and the woman chews on the question before responding. Natasha needs to feel the material, find out if this woman
“Is this some kind of imprinting, you think?” Tony asks, and despite the somewhat cavalier choice of words, Vision thinks he understands. “You and her, uh, you did have an-uh,
“It seemed to me an appropriate location for Stark to return to, considering the Compound.” Fury admits, leaning back into the plush chair. “Although I am surprised to find you instead, Miss Potts.”
"Tony had planned for the changes," Pepper starts and Fury worries that his face is too easily read, and by another
No promises, then. Vision is still carefully watching Tony, though, and when Tony notices he puts both hands on the table, subtly shakes his head.
“I should kill you right here, right now for your vanity knows no bounds; in fact…” Loki trails off, a completely demented grin spreading grimly across his face as Amora gasps; the curtain is constricting tighter; a normal man’s ribs would be broken by now, their lungs compressed past the level of  breathing; a mortal man would be dead by now but, no, Amora is living, her lips moving without speaking.
“That doesn’t make sense.” Steve growls and he grabs the other limp wrist to push the not-Tony further into the cushions. “Now I’m going to ask you a question and you’re damn well going to answer me honestly or I’ll get Agent Widow and she knows a thousand ways to knock a man out and more ways to make it painful, understand?” Apparently receiving his answer Steve barreled on. “Good. What did you do to Tony?”
She is blinded by blue-white light and a heat that sets her mind on fire. They are shaking her now, here, on the Quinjet, and when she opens her eyes in her dream the man is screaming a silent supplication to the concrete, eyes almost impossibly wide. His skin begins to tear from his body and turn to ash around him, revealing the lean lines of his muscle, fatty tissues and tendons. She screams with him, horrified, and the soldier begins to reach for her even as his muscles begin to drip away to bone, and the bones are decaying with him.
“Then don’t leave me,” Tony whispers, and they’re not kissing, they’re not even touching more than to hold and to pull, to push and to leave but there’s a charge in the air. The silence is smoldering now and Tony wants to open his eyes, wants to say something else but the air is being stolen from his lungs by Steve’s warm breath across his lips.
But Steve is human (modified but still human) and it's that mortality that gives him the right to lie sometimes, even when it's to himself.
Steve’s silent, though, watching with this enraptured look of… something else, like he’s trying to figure out what the hell is going on but his brain is drawing a blank. Tony bets he doesn’t look any better than Steve, though, and feels the bruises on his neck and chest throb as the electrified blue eyes scan his now exposed body. The gaze is almost like a physical touch, like another tongue licking down his body, down the expanse of his chest where the reactor ends and the puckered scars tapper off into Tony’s chest, abdomen, the bobbing erection that dribbles a little more pre-cum at the attention.
“It’s not of this world, that’s for sure. Sure as hell ain’t no ghost, either.” Missouri sighs and sits further back in her loveseat. “A being of another world came to me in a dream: Snotra, or something, and said that this would happen. That there would be death and scattered about would be the Valkyrie, sort of like reapers of souls but of the other world.” Missouri picks up the mug that was on the table and takes a sip of its contents, studying Tony. “Now, what do
” Amora hisses as she sends some sort of sparks towards the scarlet serpent; her hands move forward to throw the incantation just as Peter shoots a web and her hands lurch forward with the force of the webbing; she topples forward and the curtain wraps itself around her body, lifting her up with pressure alone.
“We were just planning on retiring for the night when the alert came through,” Nakia continues, “you all must be tired and in need of good food and good rest. Go, and tomorrow, we will speak on important manners.”
“Tony? Tony!” Steve shouted through the intercom, running through the newly abandoned streets at full speed, trying to get back to the Main Street and, most importantly, Tony. He still didn’t think that Tony was okay like he had made himself seem, and the fact that he had simply went into some strange theater with an
In the room of a somewhat-destroyed home in Sokovia, Sam Wilson places a damp towel on Wanda’s forehead. She has been delirious and feverish for some time now. In another room, Clint sits with Scott as they discuss the materials they’ve scavenged and how to continue building without Wanda’s telekinesis. Steve is out still gathering what he can from ruins, taking note of what areas are being cleared for hospitable housing.
Tony finds that, unfortunately, the world kept rolling forward while he was out. If he could pinpoint how other people would react, life would be a lot easier. Isn't there a law out there about how the only thing that is certain is uncertainty?
“They want… an act of good faith…” Tony says, eyes drifting somewhere to Ross’s left. “Something to appease the more… zealous supporters, to satisfy the more moderate. Shift the conversation, so to speak.”
know how to find them?” Steve presses, seeing an opportunity literally knocking on their door. “You said he seemed to have an aversion to Enchantress, and actually fought against her. Now that she’s taken Thor and Tony, maybe it’s enough to have him help us.”
“What connection does Yggdrasil have with golden thread?” Tony asks Thor and the god pauses for a moment and raps his knuckles against the chain-links of his armor before shrugging.
He looks down, chocking on his own words, his own breath and the air is scorching, he’s burning up but no one notices, no one can see that he’s
“Why are you standing there!” Steve grunts as the power of the seals digs into his wrist. “Get me out, let’s
no less, but Pepper isn't even looking at him. Her hand is braced on the rail of Tony's bed, her eyes stuck to Tony's slack expression. "But, maybe a day after his return, after putting off Ross for another twenty-four hours, he collapsed. Hadn't really been to medical, considering..."
The world is black and white and gray. The golden apple that rolls between them in the light-slate grass begins to decay. Only a single, boney-white core remains.
“We owe nothing to them,” Vision says, “and certainly not loyalty, where they have proven they do not deserve it. However, I do not take kindly to thinly veiled threats.”
“There are the Norns at the well of Urd, based on the root in my home of Asgard,” Thor replies hesitantly, as if pondering his own answer. “Your mortal equivalent of Fates, I suppose, three crones that would spin the thread of life of each living thing—plants, people, animals and the likes. Battle brother,” Thor boomed, “why do you ask?”
says, and Steve looks at their connected hands before turning back to face the ceiling, and for once it feels like he can breath again.
A woman opens the door, kind looking and a little plump, mahogany skin and all-knowing eyes. She sighs and takes a step back, widens the door space and motions with her head. “I know what you’re thinkin’, Mister Stark, and if you’re gonna be here in my little city, well, it’s good to know what we’re dealin’ with. I think you’ll probably have more answers for me than answers I will have for you.” The woman beckons again. “Names Missouri, now get your behind in here so we can get my city settled. We don’t like no disturbances, ya’ hear, and I’m tired of these loud beings taking up my airspace.”
She’s standing there for a moment, gun smoking in her hand and in the next she’s falling, bleeding, side splitting open. She screams, something blood-curdling, something thirsty for vengeance, and fumbles about with a bloodied hand. Tony takes a deep breath, hobbles forward, ignores the sound of chains behind him, Steve shouting at him to stop.
Steve hasn’t entered Tony’s room since the Warehouse Incident. It’s here that he finds himself upon return from Asgard.
“Looks like I caught a stray,” Amora teases, “oh, well. Maybe you can be a witness to my greatness; you can be in the front row of my spectacular show and,” her heel digs into Tony’s chest, forces him to turn over while simultaneously dislocating Tony’s wrist with the force of her shove, “Midgardian, it will be
“Yes, sir. The video will be directly uplinked into any motor you so desire; Coffee is already heated and waiting for your consumption in the kitchen,” comes Jarvis’ crisp mechanical voice. “Is that all, sir?”
And, yeah, maybe this has been the start of a few of Tony’s fantasies—heat-of-the-battle, amidst rubble, adrenaline pumping sex; Steve’s trying to
“Ooh then they haven’t played the ‘Private World of Darkness’ episode yet, then.” Peter jumps onto the beck rest of the couch in his typical arachnid squat, a little rigid in his blue jeans and black t-shirt but comfortable nonetheless. “This pleases me. Also, you weren’t at debriefing. Fury got, er,
: the trees root that reached Asgard contains the well of Urd, and this was the tree where the Norns (Fates) lived . Their names were Urd “past”, Verdani “present” and Skuld “future” The three Norns was the goddesses of fate. They spent most of their time spinning the threads of life, deciding the fate of every human, animal and every god.
Steve pointedly ignores Tony's eyes until the ambulance arrives. He joins Tony in the small compartment, leaves his hand on Tony's uninjured shoulder and leaves it there. He can't come up with words to comfort, but the small gesture is enough.
Suddenly he blinks and Tony isn't in the lab anymore. There are golden apples and a frail looking blonde woman holding her arms out like branches, the green sheer fabric draped over her arms moves and rustles like the leaves; she's naked besides the transparent cloth but Tony can't pull his gaze away from her inhuman violet-sapphire eyes.
if he is to believe the time Jarvis has on display for him. He’s still going over his surprisingly articulate notes and diagnosing two weeks worth of lucid mad-rambling. It’s entertaining, sometimes, when he catches himself doing something fully-cogent Tony would do while being fully asleep (Jarvis has been processing brainwaves since week one, apparently) and the introduction or REM sleep while still being conscious is some seriously scary shit.
She spilled the contents and her wrist lit up: videos, schematics, and notes all neatly organized into a single file called B.A.R.F. Other files began to stack, more videos, images; a report she could only briefly see, note-worthy for the signature on the bottom.
Tony’s draped across half of the couch in the living room, clad only in sweatpants and an old worn band t-shirt. His entire guise leaks nonchalance, a dispassionate timidity that somehow whispers “overlooked, unnoticed, disregarded” yet Tony is simply a man that demands to be seen, to be listened and respected; his presence demands attention.
It’s maybe a day, maybe two hours; Tony can never keep track of time when he’s avoiding people, when he’s busy working on being an awesome genius that is totally not in love with his pseudo-leader-slash-best friend. So yes, a good amount of time must have gone by and it certainly wasn’t a few hours. Judging by the amount of people that have tried to come down and the three overrides he’s had to bark out before someone walked into his lab when he clearly doesn’t want any company, well, it’s pretty safe to say that Steve is still trying to get him to talk and has gained allies in his oh-so-
Ross shrugs. “Depending on the information, and what it leads to. The government and its people, I’m afraid, will still be keeping a close eye on vigilantism and the Accords are, of course, still in effect. The government might just slow a bit in pushing for stricter revisions. Perhaps the whole issue of registration may just dwindle off if the shift is good.”
