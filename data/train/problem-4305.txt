Gabriel spoke up again, effectively breaking the silence. “Cas, uhm, I know this is a lot…But uh, you and Dean…What happened between you two? He was frantic trying to find you at the party, last I remember.”
Sam chuckled, a smirk tugging at his lips. “His room’s right there Cas.” He indicated to the closed door at the end of the short hall.
“So what have you been up to Dean?” She asked as she popped a bottle and slid it across the bar to him.
It was unfortunate that these quick little bio entries weren’t a whole lot to go on, but one thing was for certain, Castiel was instantly drawn to his first match, Sam Winchester.
“What, are you kidding? This is my costume. No one knows who I am anyway, so they’ll just think I’m some random dude dressed as a classic redneck.” Well, he had a point.
This was unbelievable. He couldn’t wrap his mind around what was unfolding before him, he was positive the universe was playing some cruel joke on him. It made no sense! Why would the universe wait all these years until he was in a much better place to then plop this mess in his lap. He wasn’t ready to deal with it, he didn’t even want it!
“Oh good. Okay, thank you.” He signed the papers quickly and took a seat in a corner chair in the adjacent waiting area, preferring to see the whole room in front of him. He waited for all of ten minutes before a woman dressed in a grey suit with her hair pulled back in a neat bun opened a side door and called for him.
“You slept with my sister!” He advanced on Dean but Anna blocked him, her hands and the spatula pressed against his chest.
It was all Dean could say the whole morning following his night out at the bar. Holy shit. Despite having been mostly sober by the end of the night, he still couldn’t believe he had tried making a move on Castiel, twice! How stupid could he have been? The dude didn’t like Dean in that way.
“Oh, I wouldn’t say party animal exactly.” Castiel laughed, the look in his eyes softening as he regarded Dean. He sighed quietly, a part of him in disbelief at what he was about to admit. “I feel like I can be a little bit more like myself when I’m around you, Dean. When I allow myself to let go of my worries, even for a moment, I’m happy.”
“Hello Dean.” He response was fairly monotone, as it generally was, but this was different. It was flat, cold in a way where it had no feeling. Not angry and nowhere near calm either. Dean decided he didn’t like.
Castiel looked back up at Dean and smiled. “I’d like that Dean. Sure, I’ll stay.” He conceded with a smile.
Posse_Magnet67[9:51AM]: Hey it’s okay. Trust me, I know you’ve got some stuff going on and I really don’t mind being someone you can vent to.
Jo returned then with their order of garlic knots with a trio of assorted dipping sauces. “Have you boys decided on a main course?” She asked as she set the platter down between them.
The voice sent chills down his spine and he grew hot all over as he turned to see Posse Magnet standing right there in front of him, in the flesh, a wide grin plastered on his face. He still couldn’t make out his features exactly, his hood was still up and with all the lights flashing different colors and creating strange shadows, his features were a bit obscure. Castiel didn’t care though, he was finally here.
“We’ll figure this out, one way or another.” She wiped his cheeks dry and planted a kiss on his forehead.
“Well, Castiel.” Naomi started once their hour was up. “I wish you the best of luck on your new journey and if you need to speak with me at all, you can always call me during office hours and we will set something up.” She opened the door for him and Castiel smiled, walking through it.
Castiel sat up straighter, purposefully avoiding the urge to glance over at all the excited commotion going on with Dean and his two friends at the pool tables. “Uhm, yeah, yeah. I uh…Attentiveness is always important. He’s gotta be considerate, have a sense of humor, smart..Uhm.”
Naomi smiled, jotting down a couple things in her notepad. “Leaving friends and family behind is always tough when you’re moving out of state. But I assume they are in support of you?”
“I…Well, okay. Fine, yes, I do. But we’re just friends. So there’s no point in pining over him. I do have a life to live.”
Castiel watched Dean climb into the truck once both cars were rigged up and waved goodbye before they pulled out onto the road. Once he was alone, he sagged against the wall of the antique store, the crushing weight of guilt and humiliation washing over him. Fuck…Gabriel needed to hurry up.
“Cassie!” Gabriel, much to Castiel’s disappointment, sidled in next to him on the bench. “How’s my favorite little brother?”
Curious to see if what his friends said held any truth, Castiel turned his attention back to Dean. He observed the man carefully, taking note of how confident he appeared taking each shot. The way his eyes scanned for his best options, calculating the right moves. Hell, he even showcased a bit of flare to his moves for added affect. Maybe his friends were right in some capacity. But then again, maybe it was just wishful thinking.
“Yes! I’m dead serious! Ask any of the regulars here. Wish I had gotten video of it. It’d have posted it everywhere.” Dean slurred, a bite of his burger still in his mouth.
At one point, while the trio was on the way back upstairs for drinks, Castiel pulled open his phone to see if he had any messages from Posse Magnet. And sure enough there were.
Castiel snorted, startled by the randomness of the question. It was quite the change in subject. “I’m sure I only smell like booze.”
“I don’t know what you’re talking about Anna.” Dean began after taking his shot. He slouched in his seat. “I’m just fine.”
“Of course! Do it now even.” He struck the white ball and it too hit a couple balls into a pocket. “What better time to do than while you’re drunk?” He laughed.
Castiel couldn’t hold back his laughter at the comment. Dean couldn’t be serious; he was just drunk. There was no way him or anyone else thought him so. He used this moment to crawl out of the bed, albeit a little reluctantly. “I’m going to get you that water, drunky.”
“I mean it Cas.” He set his credit card down in the tray with the bill and pushed it to the end of the table.
Castiel turned to him then, a smile playing at his lips. He certainly wasn’t expecting him to say that. “I don’t believe that was a question.” Did Dean mean to ask him out? The idea sounded preposterous, if a little bit scary. Wasn’t the man straight? Castiel wasn’t sure he believed that any more if the night’s events were anything to go by. Before Dean could clarify, Cas spoke again. “Of course we should hang out more often.”
Benny nodded in agreement. “Dean would be heart broken if you left.” Dean fixed him with a threatening glare in response.
“No can-do Cas, I’m buying you a drink and you’re gonna play a couple rounds of pool with us.” Dean insisted with the added pointing of his index finger.
“No, you don’t know. Castiel has been through some serious shit in the past. He told me everything, called me after things went down. He was a mess Dean, an absolute mess and if you knew what happened to him, you’d…” Charlie took a deep breath to try and compose herself, her emotions starting to get the best of her. “Castiel is a very dear friend of mind, and you’re – “
Dean let out a laugh and shook his head. Now would probably be a good time to put the poor guy out of his misery. One shouldn’t tease an omega too much, especially Castiel. He was far too enchanting being this bashful and Dean’s inner alpha was itching to touch, to see just how the other man may react to it. Something in the air told Dean that he wouldn’t jerk away in the opposite direction. How encouraging. “Hey, it’s no pressure, really. I uh…Well, actually, it’s just, there’s this really dumb movie I was hoping to catch soon and I don’t really have anyone to go with.” He shrugged one shoulder and kicked at some loose rocks at his feet. “But uh, if you and Sam
I wanted to add a warning to this chapter in case anyone has any adverse reactions. There are mentions of religious punishment, of certain "therapy" practices that Castiel had gone through in the past. So if that triggers anyone in anyway I do want to apologize in advance and you can skim over that part or click out if you'd like.
A few moments later, his phone chimed with the arrival of a picture message. His heart thudded wildly in his chest as he reached for the phone. Would Posse Magnet be as attractive as he often imagined?
God damnit, she was no help. He cursed under his breath and stalked off to another section of the house where he found Becky. “Becky! Please tell me you’ve seen Cas.”
Dean knew how he was when it came to having serious discussions. They were always difficult for him which was why he always tried to laugh things off and make jokes just so he could feel better, to ease off the anxiety and the weight of seriousness crushing his shoulders. They’d have to touch the subject eventually.
But! I could let you all down. Writing this fic keeps my mind busy, keeps me going. Its an escape and i have wayy too much fun.
CasaNova36[12:59PM]: It’ll only be amusing so long as you’re not catfishing me…Lol We may have passed each other on campus. Gabe is the one with all the friends though, not me.
CasaNova36[11:20PM]: Why must we keep our identities a secret?...I would really enjoy your company right now. The things I’d let you do…
His brother scoffed at the comment. “You don’t look like a zombie, just an extremely beat up angel. If anyone asks, just tell them they should see the other guy.” He laughed as though it were the funniest thing ever.
She scooted closer to him and snuggled up against his side, her fingers dancing along his chest. Dean grinned as he turned to gaze at her but was suddenly struck by a pair of eyes so blue that they reminded him so much of Castiel’s. It was like a punch to the gut and it infuriated him to think that after such an encounter he was still plagued by reminders of the man and everything he represented.
Not to worry though, happier times are coming and with this chapter comes a new beginning! Hope you all enjoy :D
Desperate, Dean trudged onwards and followed Castiel and his brother outside, his inner alpha pretty much dictating how this afternoon encounter was going to go. Which was fine, Dean was down, no problem. “So uh, you wanna go see her?” He asked when he caught up beside Cas where they waited for the Lincoln to be brought back around.
It wasn’t fair though because being with Dean filled Castiel with so many emotions, so many wants and needs. He had thought talking to Charlie would help, but he was almost certain he was left with many more questions that prior to speaking with her.
“Hey, I’m just saying, car accidents will do that to ya.” How could he have forgotten about the jokes? They were never funny and they almost always bordered on insulting. He continued on. “You know, when I got the call from your brother, I was quite shocked, surprised really. I couldn’t believe it, our very own Castiel at a frat party, living it up as today’s youth does.” He shook his head. “He told me you’d been in a car accident, passenger to another frat boy. I couldn’t help but wonder what my youngest nephew had been up to, what the plan had been.”
“Ash! Ash! He replied!” Charlie’s excitement was through the roof. She honestly didn’t think that he ever would reply to her and that they would be stuck in here in limbo, wondering who the hell this guy was, even though they were pretty positive it had to be Dean. How the hell else could it be?
He raced to campus and as soon as he parked the Impala, he sent a quick text to Castiel, letting him know he just parked. His heart hammered in his chest as he made his way to the courtyard, the pit in his stomach uncomfortable and unlike anything he’s ever felt before.
“I know Dean.” Castiel nodded and glanced down at his feet. “I understand. I’d never expect you to wait for me. I just don’t know how long it’ll take or if I’ll ever be okay again.”
Posse_Magnet67[11:31AM]: Well idk, I’ve thought about it. We’ll both wear masks with our costumes so it’s not like any rules would be broken. Lol
“I happen to agree with Gabriel here. You need to get better.” She watched all the conflicting emotions flit across his face, saw the tears fill his eyes. “I know it sounds hard, but once you take that first leap in finding happiness in yourself you’ll feel so much better.”
We had to read the bible three times a day and memorize certain passages for later testing. Alistair, he uh, he took a special liking to me…He deemed me in the most need of help.” Castiel shrugged. “He seemed to get some sort of sick pleasure out of handling me…The things he did, they did. If I so much as looked at another boy, even a glance, I was struck.
He really needed to choose; he can’t continue to string both along like he has been. But damn was it hard to resist Castiel’s big blue eyes and the way they seemed to peer right into him, to his soul, as though he were really seeing him, the real Dean. Sure, it made him feel vulnerable and open, but for whatever reason he didn’t mind it with Castiel.
Understanding dawned on Sam then and his moue of confusion slowly stretched out into a grin. “Ohh, so you were the quote ‘hot omega’ that hit his baby.”
That was indeed the real question. They could easily try to be friends again and Dean felt like they were off to a fairly good start. But Benny was right, they had history, and nearly five years of distance between them. There was no doubt that being around Cas stirred old emotions he had previously thought were long gone and a part of him wondered if Castiel felt the same sort of emotions.
Sam’s face lit up at that and he sat back down. “Right, of course.” They divided everything up and once it seemed appropriate, Sam spoke again. “So how have you been?”
“The guy came into the Roadhouse last night, bummed and I don’t know, confused I guess. Look, I tried to help, told him he didn’t have to worry about you…But I don’t know, didn’t seem to help.”
Dean grinned and followed the sound of his brother’s voice down the hall to the bathroom where he found Sam brushing his teeth. He leaned against the doorframe and crossed his arms over his chest. “So how did your date go?” He slurred.
“Sam, I appreciate your concern but I’m a big boy now, I can handle myself.” Dean chuckled, however he did take Sam’s concern to heart. He had felt bad for putting all of his shit on his brother, for crying into his chest like a girl, but damnit, Castiel broke his heart. Those emotions, though uncontrollable, they were still valid. He just vowed to never allow someone to make him feel that way ever again.
“You will come back to visit, right?” Charlie asked him pointedly as she poured a series of shots for each of them.
“Yeah of course!” Dean scoffed and fished his keys out of his pocket and made his way around to the driver side. “You know me.”
CasaNova36[8:43PM]: I am. I keep looking around waiting to see you in the crowd. There are a lot of people here! More than the last party I went to.
This wasn’t right, Dean wasn’t supposed to feel things for men, let alone Castiel. Not especially after all this time. He was supposed to have let all that go, was supposed to find solace and pleasure with soft flesh and well-manicured fingers, not…Not…
And sure enough, the rest of the night became a bit of a blur. He played countless rounds of beer pong with Gabriel, his friend Benny, and a skinny kid named Garth. Plenty others joined in but he was too drunk to remember any names. More drinks were passed around, the music was turned up even louder and he could barely recall making out with someone…Lisa Braeden?
“No.” Castiel shook his head, finishing off his beer in one fail swoop in hopes to rid himself of the horrible aftertaste. “I do not. Hey, don’t laugh at me.”
In the middle of Gabe dotting his trench coat with droplets of fake blood, there came a knocking on Castiel’s door. Gabriel paused what he was doing to answer the door.
No, Cas wasn’t going to dwell on his involvement here, he couldn’t. That only lead him down a dark, self-loathing path.
With Sam gone Dean could finally breathe a sigh of relief. He grabbed a beer for himself and plopped down beside Castiel. “So, I don’t look so bad now huh?” He said after taking a swig.
He didn’t know why, its not like they truly knew each other or anything. Castiel was Dean’s tutor, and sure, they developed a sort of friendship over the past month. But Dean, God help him, he wanted more than that.
“Ow!” Sam laughed, rubbing his arm. “Okay, I’m sorry. Anyways, Castiel, Dean here happens to be my very obnoxious older brother.”
Charlie took his hand and gave it a squeeze. God how she felt for him. She wished nothing more than to be able to take away his pain no matter what was needed of her. “Why would…Why would Alistair choose now to come to you?”
Dean feigned injury at the attempted insult. Despite the implication of what Anna just said, Castiel still laughed as he watched the two bicker. “If I didn’t know any better I would assume you two were an old married couple.”
He downed the remainder of his drink and tossed it into a nearby trashcan before weaving his way through the throng of people, a sense of impatience coming over him when people just wouldn’t move out of his way. But at last, he made it to back deck. He scanned the backyard and spotted a tall figure standing underneath the willow tree there, pacing back and forth.
“Why didn’t you tell me? Why not before the party? Before I spent the whole night whisked away, happy, before it was all ripped from under my feet.” His voiced shook with disbelief.
“Its not a problem, we both have our personal lives outside of this app, things happen. Though, to be totally honest, I’d be lying if I said it wasn’t a little bit jealous. I mean, from your photos – wow! – you’re pretty hot. Whoever your friend was, he’s certainly luck to have had the opportunity.”
“No, Nuh uh.” Dean protested, reaching for his wallet. It was too much work for him though he soon found out, the liquor flowing through his veins was just too much for him to really concentrate.
Posse_Magnet67[11:42PM]: I could and so much more. God Casanova, I’m so close. Just the thought of you, wherever you are, touching yourself because of me.
Dean groaned and held the phone a little bit further away from his ear. “Too loud…Why are you calling so early?”
Although, in the midst of their arguing, they didn’t notice the figure walking right over to their table until whoever it was spoke. “Hello Dean.”
Castiel glanced back over at Dean and watched as he laughed and joked with the other patrons and his fellow coworkers. He was quite the fine specimen, what with his dark blonde hair, the three day old scruff lining his jaw and – holy shit – that ass…
It took some work with the heavy liquor clouding his brain, but Dean managed to shrug out of his leather jacket and his plaid overshirt which left him in a loose grey T-shirt. He toed off his boots and scooted up to the head of the bed. Castiel, not wanting to gawk, took the discarded closed and walked over to set them on the dresser. He glanced over at Dean to see him lying there with his eyes closed and he decided then it would be a good idea to leave.
Morning came fairly quickly, Castiel’s alarm going off at nine. He didn’t have to be at work until four that evening and honestly he could have just slept in later except he tended to enjoy his mornings before having to go into work.
Despite Gabriel being a good friend, Dean wasn’t sure if their conversation helped at all in any way. He was still left fixating on Castiel and now Gabe’s cryptic messages. It was enough to drive a person mad.
So Castiel turned on his hazard lights and stepped out of his car on shaky legs to assess whatever damage he caused. His front bumper was trashed, his headlights shattered. The car he hit was no better. His bumper was smashed to bits, the trunk had popped open at an odd angle and his taillights were also shattered, leaving glass all over the pavement below. “I…I’m so sorry, I – “
Their afternoon together was comfortable, relaxing and full of laughs too. Dean had teased Cas a bit when he laughed at something Michael said or something Dwight did and he was promptly met with an exaggerated eye roll. Castiel may have refused to admit he was actually digging the show, but it was clear in his relaxed posture and his attention that he liked it on some level.
“Hey.” He grumbled in greeting. He was a gruff looking older gentleman, a man who most likely didn’t hold a lot of patience even on a good day. He wore an old ball cap and what must be his best flannel T-shirt, though it was rather dirty and rough around the edges. “Welcome, what can I do for you?”
CasaNova36[4:00PM]: I do apologize for that. Hey…Did you end up passing that test you were worried about?
It had been a few hours since Castiel heard from Posse Magnet, their conversation earlier in the morning having been quite enjoyable and it did the trick. It distracted him just enough to keep a smile on his face. He just started his shift at the Starbucks when his phone buzzed in his back pocket. It wasn’t until his break two hours later that he was able to look at it. And thank god no one else was in the break room too because what Posse Magnet had sent him was a half nude photo of himself. Okay, so partially nude. The dude was standing in front of a bathroom mirror, all dirty and oily. He held up the hem of his dirty tank top just enough to give Cas a good view of his impeccable abs. His face was unfortunately covered by yet another emoji, but Castiel was pretty sure the guy was grinning from ear to ear. But God damn…
“Well, I’m afraid you don’t have any choice in the matter.” The line was moving again, leaving only one more person waiting in front of them.
“Hey-a Cas! I didn’t see ya there.” Sure, Dean was a little nervous too, but he consumed enough liquor to feel confident now. Benny simply sat back and watched, grinning.
I’m currently single, as my life doesn’t really afford me enough time to devote to a relationship, so I volunteer to help other omegas (and the occasional alpha) in their time of need.
Okay. I am so sorry that this chapter took me fucking ages to finally get out! And I can certainly explain. Anyone else a huge fan of Hannibal? Well, once Netflix decided to be home to the series I was done for. Me and my best friend fell down the rabbit hole that is Hannigram. Like, ugh, its so beautiful!!!
CasaNova36[3:12PM]: I’d like to hear your voice too. But what if we recognize each other? I mean…That’d ruin the big surprise
“Thanks Dean.” It was quiet, as though Castiel wasn’t quite sure what to do with what just happened. Dean was a nice guy, he had to repay the favor somehow.
“I’m sorry Dean.” Cas wanted to say more, wanted to apologize for everything but he couldn’t quite get the words out. He just hoped he conveyed all he felt with just a look.
“Oh, that’s okay. School work is important.” He smiled to himself. Thank god he had some liquor in his system, otherwise he wouldn’t at all be brave enough to even think about flirting with this man. He shouldn’t where Alistair was concerned. But Cas couldn’t feel him right now, as though he checked out of the building for the time being. The liquor helped, he reminded himself, for now.
“Psh, well!” Dean slammed his hand down on the bar’s surface for dramatic effect. “You get him angry enough he will. Lord knows he’s laid me out a few times.”
Dean gulped a bit nervously, heart pounding in his chest. It was too close, much too close; everything seemed to line almost perfectly with what happened between him and Cas. But was that just his suspicion? Was it all just coincidence?
“Shit..” Castiel glanced at his dashboard and sure enough, the needle on the temperature gauge was all the way in the red. Fuck…A wave of panic came over him and settled uncomfortably in his stomach. Quickly, he pulled over onto the shoulder of the highway and cut the engine.
“Oh! Uh, h-hello Dean.” Castiel flushed, caught off guard and totally not prepared to see Dean again. Stating the obvious – like a fool – he added, “You must work here.”
Mathew eventually turned and walked away uninterested, leaving Castiel to fend for himself; not that he was expecting anyone to come to his immediate rescue or anything.
So, when early morning came, Castiel left silently back to his own room. He thought about Dean still; as he had all night, desperate to know how he was feeling. Even though he was sure he already knew.
“Well,” Sam sighed. “He’s able to breathe more or less on his own now…His left lung was punctured in the accident and he had to be intubated. The good news is that he no longer needs the tube down his throat, just the respirator. Hopefully soon he won’t even need that.”
But then there were the moans and the audible gasping coming from the man himself. It was deep, breathy and it pushed Castiel that much closer to the edge. He stroked himself in time with the video, the speed growing faster and faster. Castiel was getting closer, liquid heat pooling low in his belly, the pleasure from his ministrations overwhelming his senses.
“Just give me until the party okay!” He demanded, his fingers gripped the steering wheel until his knuckles turned white. “We already made it plan to reveal ourselves at the party anyway, well before we spoke on the phone.”
Dean made eye contact with Castiel at one point and if his heart could beat any faster, well, it did. He thought for sure he was staring right though him, stripping him away until there was nothing left. The music moved him, Dean moved him and it saddened Castiel that he had given this up so long ago. He could sit here and say that it wasn’t fair, but he was the one that made the choice to leave. Regret was certainly a cruel son of a bitch.
Castiel spit on his hand and went back to it, the motions much easier this time, wetter, wave after wave of pleasure washing over him. “I’m not gonna last – ah – for much longer if you keep talking like that.”
“Oh, h-hello Dean.” Castiel’s blue eyes were wide with shock. He quickly averted them and returned his attention back on their professor, waiting for the days’ lecture.
Vivid memories of what transpired in the past 32 hours replayed over and over. It still amazed Castiel how quickly things could change in such a short amount of time.
“I haven’t the slightest idea, except work per usual. Why, what’s up?” Dean plopped down in a chair and pulled out a boring ham and cheese sandwich with a side of equally boring potato chips.
The song’s intro began to play, the sounds of the guitar filling the room. One quick glance around showed that everyone’s attention was on Dean, who’s demeanor had changed, as though he was completely absorbed by the music in the way he swayed to it.
“Well, good morning to you too.” Dean grumbled. It wasn’t lost on Castiel when Dean allowed his own gaze to roam over him; taking in his business-like appearance with…Was that interest..? Castiel flushed at the ridiculous thought.
“Naww, think you got it.” He booped Castiel on the nose with his index finger. They both laughed and they finally managed to get the door open. The pair stumbled inside, greeted by a sleepy and confused Sam standing outside his bedroom door.
Posse_Magnet67[1:02PM]: I can promise I’m not catfishing you. Though I can see why that would be hard to believe considering my rules…
However, it seemed Becky and Ash had other ideas. “Whoa! Hey!” The pair said in unison; which happened to surprise them both. Becky spoke first. “I know you’re angry, but maybe calm down a minute? You can’t go confront him like this.”
Dean had a few theories he wanted to test out which will most likely include paying zero attention to the day’s lesson.
Castiel nodded as he chewed on the bit of pastry, shoulder slumping a little. “Yeah I suppose so. It’s not like I have much of an option.”
“Yeah! The more the merrier. We were only talking about Dean’s love – life! Ow.” Benny winced at the obvious kick in the shin from Dean.
A wide smile broke out on Dean’s face, an unfamiliar warmth spreading through out his chest. He looked at Castiel, his smile softening. Yeah, he could get used to this. “A man after my own heart. I’ll have to cook for you next time.” Dean hadn’t realized he said the words until after they left his mouth, recognizing that they held a potential weight to them.
The first bite was heaven. Cas moaned in satisfaction, eyes closed as he chewed thoughtfully. “This is…” He started around a second bite. “This is really good Dean…Wow.”
Castiel had planned on taking a walk to ease the anger and calm down, but he was still in his pajamas and he was sure he probably looked like a bum. So he sat down on the front steps and stewed.
Gabriel gave him a pointed look, even more impatient than he had been moment before. Damnit, okay, there wasn’t any way Castiel could avoid the conversation. It was pointless considering the subject matter. He sighed in defeat, ducking his head to gather his thoughts. “He told me it was about time I put a stop to my suppressants, consider going through a full heat or two to avoid potential damage from prolonged use.”
CasaNova36[4:51PM]: Don’t be so modest. Gotta admit, lack of alcohol and everything, I can’t wait to see you at the party.
Whenever he had the chance between shifts and on the weekend he’s work on her. She had needed extensive repairs too and since insurance had it totaled he just took the money and put it towards the repairs himself. Bobby argued that he should just get a new car, but Dean of course refused despite the huge laundry list of things Baby needed.
“Good thinking. How about my place tonight if you’re not too busy later?” It probably wasn’t the best idea, considering how any time they were alone together Dean was always tempted to make a move on Cas. They should go somewhere public, maybe back to Ruby’s Diner where he wouldn’t be so tempted. But, before Dean could change his mind, Castiel agreed with a smile.
Castiel had given up dating, or trying to anyway, for a while. And he was lonely. He wanted someone to come home to, to smile at him like he was their entire world, to laugh at stupid jokes. To feel and touch, hold and kiss; with passion and emotion. And now that he knew how to manage himself with the help of Naomi, he wanted it more than he ever had. He was free, finally, but trying to find someone who made him feel was almost near impossible.
Fuck, this couldn’t be happening, Cas couldn’t possibly be leaving him, not like this, not while Dean was laid up in the hospital. “No, Cas, you can’t leave me.” God, look at him. He was reduced to this begging, pleading mess. He was pathetic, utterly pathetic.
Castiel nearly choked on the water he was drinking when he finally went on break. Well, that was an easy way to lighten his mood.
Castiel chuckled and shook his head. As much as he didn’t mind the occasional eye candy, this wouldn’t exactly be a great time to meet someone. So, Singer Salvage it was then. If his sister’s recommendation was anything to go on, this was his best shot.
Castiel tore his gaze from the bar top and locked eyes with a pair of devastatingly green ones. His eyes widened at just how familiar they were and it wasn’t until he did a double take and processed the bartenders other features that it dawned on him. Green eyes, a smattering of freckles, dark blonde hair and red flannel over a dark T.
From time to time Dean would think back on his college days, back on whatever it was he had with Castiel. He mourned the friendship they had before everything went to shit. Before they both ruined things. It grew toxic pretty quickly and these days Dean was grateful that it had ended, that Castiel left. Though the dude could have been a bit more tactful there.
Dean started up the engine and headed on home, a certain, insane idea swirling around in his mind the entire drive home. One he wasn’t sure Casanova would ever be interested in. But Dean was curious and it wouldn’t hurt to ask. What would it be like if him and Casanova spoke over the phone? What would his mystery friend sound like? The thought alone was exciting and a part of him really hoped Casanova would be alright with it.
“No not really.” Dean laughed dryly. “But I was ambushed by none other than Charlie Bradbury.” He took a sip of his coffee, however it wasn’t quite hot enough, so he got up to put it in the microwave.
“So look,” Dean started after they exited their cars. “How about I get in touch with a guy I know who can fix your car right up?”
Castiel rolled his eyes despite knowing she made a good point. It kind of was a big deal even though he didn’t want to completely admit it. Dean never once paid him any sort of attention and he was generally okay with that. It was safe, there was no obligation to engage the other man and potentially make a fool out of himself. Castiel liked it better that way.
Did she mean…” Charlie knew? How the hell had she known when he didn’t? “For how long did you know before you were going to tell me?” He looked at her hard, frustration boiling in his chest. She knew Dean was Posse Magnet? He recalled her asking him if he wanted her to poke around and ask questions. But he thought she was only joking, at least a little anyway. But, had she really gone behind his back to find out who he really was? He thought he had been clear about not wanting her to do any such thing. When she didn’t say anything, Castiel pressed her again, firmly this time. “How long Charlie?”
Dean shrugged as he leaned up against his car, hands shoved deep in the pockets of his well-worn jeans. “My baby’s been through worse than a simple fender bender. Built her from the ground up after my dad totaled her some years back. This really isn’t that big of a deal, inconvenient for both of us, sure, but – “ He shrugged once more noncommittally. Dean pulled out his phone and made the phone call before the offer could be declined further.
Alistair’s last appearance was the catalyst, as horrible as it was. As terrifying as it felt to not be in control, it showed Castiel that he needed to seek help. He needed to take back his power, work on himself and unlearn old notions. It was going to be a heavy journey, and as much as he wanted Dean to be a part of it, he couldn’t.
“No, it’s not that! Asshole.” He chuckled. “Tryna engage in meaningful conversation here but he’s just not biting.”
“I was wrong though. It was horrible…The things they did to me, the things they taught me. It wasn’t just Father Alistair…There were others. They called themselves Messengers of God and that they were called upon to do his work, to help heal todays ‘tormented youth.’
Oh, but yes, it indeed felt good to get it off his chest and Posse Magnet was so accepting of him and supportive. He felt lighter, happier knowing he had someone special to discuss his secrets with without judgment.
Castiel parked his car behind Dean’s, gathered everything he ordered and walked up the front steps. He carefully pulled open the screen door to knock on the wooden one behind it. While he waited for Dean to answer he looked around at his surroundings. Dean’s home was a fairly good sized farm house, one that was likely quite a few decades old. The paint was old and dirty, some of it chipping away. It certainly needed a brand new coat, or a good washing at least.
But then there were the stories he was told. Casanova having had a falling out with a friend whom he had really liked, a friend who – as it happened – made the first move just as he had with Cas. There were mentions of the conversion therapy Casanova went through, which apparently had to have had something to do with the falling out.
Upon being discharged the following afternoon, Castiel was given quite the laundry list of things to do to aid in his recovery and a prescription for pain meds for his shoulder and bruised ribs. With all the paperwork squared away, Cas was finally able to go home.
Something had stirred within when their eyes locked, something stubborn, there was no doubt about it.
Dean clapped a hand on his shoulder and leaned in close. “Hey there handsome...” His voice, close to Castiel’s ear, was low and deep and it raised goosebumps on the back of his neck. Despite Dean being well under the influence, he still managed to get under his skin. “Come here often?”
With a shaky hand, Castiel reached into his pocket and pulled out his phone. He dialed Charlie’s number and put the phone up to his ear. When she answered, Castiel let out a sigh of relief but the pain resurfaced with a vengeance and he choked on another sob.
Castiel had panicked that day, he suddenly turned into someone he didn’t recognize. Even Gabriel had mentioned Castiel not being himself! It was lining up too perfectly and this was sounding way too much like his and Castiel’s story. Lord help him, but Dean was stuck, stuck between reaching out to Castiel and continuing on with this charade; this horrible charade.
The sight alone brought back all the emotions he felt during and after the wreck: pain, anger, fear, sorrow…
Shit, was Castiel a mushroom kind of guy? Dean didn’t know. Its fine, he can always ask. With the oil heating in the pan, Castiel returned with a smile. “Is there anything I can do to help?” He had asked as he stood behind a chair at the table.
All Dean had wanted to do was go out for a few drinks, immerse himself in the local wildlife and forget about Castiel. He was actually quite annoyed he had to start over in that endeavor and it hadn’t helped that he awoke each morning with Castiel on his mind.
Posse_Magnet67[4:36PM]: Well, lol tell the first that lipstick doesn’t matter at all. No one wants lipstick smeared all over their face after a good make out session.
Dean laughed. “You what?” He turned around to see tears running down Castiel’s cheeks as he tried desperately to cut the onion into strips. Dean laughed even harder at the sight. “Careful man, you’re going to cut yourself.”
A sigh escaped Castiel’s lips as he drew closer to the house that was currently full of students, alcohol and loud, booming music. He wasn’t sure why he agreed to go to this party in the first place as it wasn’t something he ever saw himself enjoying. But he supposed his brother Gabriel’s constant pleading did him in.
Also. If theres anyone out there who loves to do fanart, I wouldnt at all be opposed to see some fanart of my fic XD
Once he found the bathroom and the short line of people leading up to it, Castiel pulled out his phone.
“Hey, if I had an ex I hated that was seeing my sister, I’d be furious as hell and I’d demand it to stop. So, I’m squashing this.”
Castiel looked up at the sudden interruption to see the familiar face of a man walking through the shop door and towards the older gentleman – Bobby. Cas was stunned, his breath caught in his throat…It couldn’t be…The sandy brown hair was styled the same as he always remember it, his eyes were still a beautiful green; crow’s feet just barely making themselves known. And those freckles, oh, they were so much more visible now, the summer sun having had some effect on them. His voice was the same, smooth as honey but deepened with age. He couldn’t be more than 30 years old now.
No matter how many times he told himself he can’t get close, he can’t rebel and feel things for another man, for Dean, it never really stuck. Each time he looked over at Dean or spent any sort of significant time in his presence, he could feel his resolve slipping, his guard dashed away by a smile and a pair of green eyes.
Okay, so maybe stalking him online was actually a lot creepier than anything else. It depended on how someone looked at it. Charlie didn’t really care at this point.
How would Dean feel if he saw Castiel hanging on some other guy in the halls on campus? He was sure it would crush him! Cas couldn’t do that to him. “There’s something else too. a confession of sorts I guess.”
Sure, Sam was handsome, charming as ever, intelligent, strong and capable. Confident. Sam was everything an alpha should be, but maybe Gabriel was on to something the other morning in the kitchen. Sam’s certainly attractive and there’s no doubt in his mind that he chose the right alpha out of the options given to him, but he honestly couldn’t see himself being intimate with him, scenting him and begging for his knot.
Castiel was distracted, which was the understatement of the day. His mind was elsewhere, focused on decidedly more interesting things than what his calculus professor was teaching. It kind of terrified him that a person whom he has never met could have this sort of hold over him, his guard having been blasted away without much of a fight.
“Eh, well, I never had the chance to really know what dorm room life was like. I’m a little curious.” He shrugged his shoulders, hoping he would buy it. Turns out he didn’t.
Dean read the message and paused to look over to gaze at Castiel. He watched him grab his water and chug it before he laid his head back down on his backpack. Cas looked so sick and so unlike himself that the sight alone broke Dean’s heart. He just wished Cas would have accepted his help. Maybe then things wouldn’t be as complicated as they currently were. But that unfortunately wasn’t the case.
Dean wasn’t sure whether it was the alcohol clouding hid mind of what, but he had to admit and agree that yeah, it was exciting. They were in contact again, living in the same town. He remembered a time where he prayed for this late at night before he fell asleep; and he has never been one for praying. But this? He wanted this once upon a time. And perhaps deep down, even as life went on, he had always wanted it. Dare he say he wanted more?
God, Charlie was so right and it fucking sucked to high heaven. Everything was suddenly so complicated and Castiel had no idea how to unfuck any of it. “I…It’s safe.”
Ash shrugged it off and began typing away on his laptop. “It’ll be fine. It’s gonna be a little bit before I can get this thing up and running so think about what you might want to say in your message.” He turned to her then, a grin on his face. “You ready to do some hacking!?”
When Castiel left the counter to take a seat in one of the empty chairs, Dean left to the parking lot where that beat up Lincoln was indeed towed. Sure enough, as Dean sat in the driver’s seat, surrounded by all of Castiel’s belongings, he came to one simply conclusion.
There was a lot that weighed heavily on his mind. Dean was always there, he still felt Alistair’s presence now and again, but he felt as though he had him under control at the moment. For how long though? That was always going to be an issue.
“Yeah. We uh, well, let’s just say it wasn’t a good breakup.” Castiel scratched the back of his neck, his senses acutely aware of the scrubbed mark on his neck. He saw Sam’s gaze flit curiously to the mark, observing it briefly, a look of sympathy in his eyes. He didn’t comment on the mark, thankfully.
“Yeah, I don’t know. We got along, and, well…Fuck, I want to be. I’m just gonna be honest here. I would like to be friends with him again and I don’t know, maybe he does too. He’s the one who gave me his number anyways so…”
He would be a liar though if he said the fantasy of nearly getting caught in the act didn’t excite him. “Awe.” She pouted, giggling a little as she palmed the growing bulge in the front of his jeans. “Well, why don’t we go back to my place then, hm?”
Well that was a new one, the nickname had Cas blushing a little, the corner of his mouth twitching upwards into an awkward smile. There was no denying that he quite liked the nickname and it certainly didn’t have anything to do with it being given by Dean himself, no, of course not.
“I’m going for auto-mechanics. I mean, I already know a bit from personal experience, but it’ll look good on my resume.”
Castiel flushed, stuttering a bit as he answered. “Uhm, Not really I guess. I’m a Sales Auditor at Costco.” He sipped his beer.
With a crooked grin, Castiel skipped down the steps and walked over to Posse Magnet, who, to Castiel’s dismay, was no wearing the full red hood mask. It was ridiculous, it made him look more menacing, which was the whole point. But Cas just wanted to give him one last kiss before they took them off.
Dean sighed and ran a hand through his hair. “If I continue to flunk out then I’ll lose my housing. My younger brother lives with me and I can’t put him in that situation.”
Castiel chuckled and shook his head, taking his time to sip on the second glass. “It’s fine. Sam’s been great.”
His heart hammered in his chest and his mind screamed “Fuck fuck fuck.” Castiel wasn’t necessarily afraid to meet Posse Magnet, it was just, okay, so maybe that was a lie. Seeing him here made everything that much more real; the countless conversations, the sexting that one time and the few times they spoke over the phone. But in person? That was so much more difficult!
Castiel[8:16PM]: He seems fine, could be wrong though…I think he’s playing a game with me…Idk, I’ll get back to you.
Posse_Magnet67[1:42PM]: Hey, so I got this weird message on the chat app. Two, actually, from the same person. I don’t know what to make of it and was hoping I could get your professional opinion. Lol
“You want me to take over?” Dean came around and held out his hand for the knife, a chuckle escaping him as Cas squinted his eyes hard against the stinging venom of the damned vegetable.
Your typical male with the Devil May Care attitude, dressed in his usual leather jacket and worn jeans. He looked every bit the part, right down to the very car he drove, his prized 67 Chevy Impala.
Castiel smiled. “That’s alright.” Sam had the kindest pair of hazel colored eyes and an air about him that indicated he put forth the best of intentions in the things he said and did. Castiel had only just met the guy, but he knew instantly that he liked Sam. His scent was calming, warm, with notes of vanilla and maple that reminded him of cuddling up beside a warm fire on a winter afternoon. He was incredibly handsome too, the type of attractive that would seem intimidating if not for his friendly and empathetic disposition. Sam’s honey-brown hair curled at the nape of his neck, a few strands falling artfully over his forehead. He sported a pair of broad shoulders and a lean torso beneath dark flannel. “It’s good to meet you too.” Castiel added before retaking his seat, Sam sitting in the chair beside him.
“N-no, you’re fine.” Castiel replied, reaching for his belongings, desperately trying to distract himself as well. “We were just studying.” He made it a point not to look at Dean lest he risk turning completely red in the face. At least not now, he needed a moment to calm his racing heart.
Was that why Castiel pushed him away? Told him he had things to work through, serious issues that got in the way of simple living. Assuming Casanova was Castiel, it made sense…And if it were true…?
It wasn’t until after he was finally dropped off at home that the guilt of potentially being inattentive to Sam began to well up within him. Sam was a wonderful guy, intelligent and funny, and here Castiel was, ogling his older brother from across the bar.
The songs changed a few more times, Castiel dancing with Charlie just as he had with Becky until he eventually he felt much more comfortable dancing on his own, with his two best friends beside him. His drink was long forgotten now, the red solo cup empty on a table somewhere. He wasn’t quite sure how long they were dancing for, but in his costume, Cas quickly became too overheated and he needed a break. Becky and Charlie nod but they didn’t follow him to the sidelines.
Castiel nodded thoughtfully, a bit of heat rising to his cheeks. Okay, so maybe his friends were right. He recalled the times him and dean hung out after class, when they walked down the halls together. He remembered sitting under the big oak tree with an excited Dean because he had managed to pass an exam. In fact, their whole friendship consisted of some flirtatious banter accompanied with this crazy tension between them. Even so, Dean was like the sun, and all Cas had ever wanted to do was bask in his presence.
The thought brought more tears to Castiel’s eyes as he gazed up at Dean. “I would have said something, Dean..I wouldn’t have allowed it to go this far…I’m sorry, but I just, I need to go.” He turned to leave and this time Dean didn’t stop him.
“I can’t believe you’re real.” Castiel commented, gazing at Posse Magnet and committing everything to memory. His hood was adjusted back properly over his head. “Your hood is getting in the way of me looking at you.”
Oh, how he missed his friends. Cas wanted to stay in Kansas, he really did. But with his sister growing up and renting her first house he wanted to be a part of it. Besides, he wasn’t that far away really, just a really long day’s drive was all.
The spell broke at the sound of Sam’s voice, Dean turning to look at his brother. “What? Leaving so soon?”
The quick change in subject was a warm welcome; Castiel found himself smiling at the mention of the alpha. “He’s great. He uh, he’s smart, outgoing and attentive. He’s a paramedic too, which seems to fit well for him. Sam eventually wants to become a doctor; he’s in school right now.”
“I was drunk Dean.” Castiel deadpanned, frustrated. Dean recoiled as if struck. “I’ve told you time and time again, alcohol drowns it all out, lowers my inhibitions and in my case it did all that and more. We might have shared something, but I was drunk.”
“Hot damn Cassie!” Gabriel whistled once the picture was finally pulled up on the screen. “Sam’s quite the looker. I’m sure he’ll be able to give you everything you need, right baby bro? Six foot four? I bet.”
Oh, how he wanted to, how every fiber of his being screamed at him to do it, to end the torture and relish in what he knew would feel absolutely amazing, right.
Anna and Castiel both laughed, Cas in disbelief over Sam’s apparent behavior. Oh how he wished he could have witnessed such a stunt. “I imagine security was forced to escort him out.” Cas commented after a sip of his jack and coke.
“Hm, I uh, I think I need a refill.” Castiel left hastily, leaving no time for Gabriel or Dean to protest; for which he was grateful. He wandered into the kitchen where all the booze and snacks were being offered. Squeezing his way through the mingling party-goers, Castiel managed to pour himself a refill. Vodka and orange juice, pretty simple. Afterwards he found himself a somewhat quiet corner in the dining room, hopefully far enough away from anymore interactions with Dean.
“Okay! Remember how Hilary was talking to that guy online who happened to be dating the rude bitch who bullied her? She had no idea who he was and neither did he. What if – “
The rest of that afternoon went by fairly quickly, Castiel incredibly grateful for Bobby’s sudden interruption. Well, almost. Cas had wanted to broach the subject before had to leave, to ask Dean what he had meant by still liking him, but was unfortunately never presented with the right opportunity. Dean never did bring it up again.
So, with all of his things together, Castiel ventured to Dean’s floor and with some guidance from a couple nurses he found the correct room. He spotted Sam first, seated close to Dean’s side, his back to the window.
Hendrickson was heard laughing beside a tool bench. He shook his head. “Man, what’s going on with you? You don’t ever text on the job, hell, not even when you were dating sweet ol Jo.”
Castiel smiled gently, however there was no happiness there, no, it was nothing but gloom. “I’m so glad you are okay.” A tear rolled down his cheek. “But this is goodbye Dean. Please take care of yourself.”
There were things they needed to discuss, serious things that needed to be voiced and addressed. Dean needed to know the reasons why Castiel had left, and not just the reason he gave all those years ago. He knew he was going to seek mental help, but Dean couldn’t help but wonder if there were other reasons behind it. He had triggered something dark inside Cas and Dean had felt partly responsible for it all.
CasaNova36[12:46PM]: He talks about originality. You have to go big for Halloween. But I don’t want to stick out. Don’t think he understands that.
“F-fuck!” Dean growled, fingers digging into her hips as he worked her through her orgasm, his own hitting him with such intensity he nearly lost himself. He groaned as he thrust his way through it before stilling altogether. He collapsed on top of her, exhausted, though he made sure he wasn’t crushing her.
Dean flushed at the accusation which was one hundred percent true. “Oh hush. That was a long time ago. A once in a lifetime opportunity dashed.”
Castiel wasn’t sure if he should reply, though he was highly tempted. But he also wasn’t sure what he should even say. Should he tell him where he was and wait for him, or –
“You think I don’t know that already!? I think about it constantly. I want to tell him and I know I need to but I just can’t, I can’t lose him Charlie…” The thought of losing Castiel forever, of not hearing his voice, seeing him smile that crooked smile, or receiving a message from him was frightening. And it only worsened when he realized just how deep he was in. He didn’t do feelings, ever. Nothing he’s ever felt in the past has felt like this, it was too much. He really did need to tell Castiel the truth, just rip the band aid off.
When Dean didn’t say anything for a moment, the look on his face suggesting he was trying to figure out what he should say, Castiel’s heart broke. That silence, the inability to say anything told him everything he needed to know. When it seemed like Dean really want going to respond, Cas turned to walk away.
“Hey guys!” Sam greeted as the door shut behind him. He looked over at the pair seated awkwardly on the couch. Between Dean hastily trying to distract himself with the remainder of his beer and Castiel’s wide, almost frightful expression, Sam knew something was up. With a grin, he spoke again, a teasing lilt to his voice. “I’m not interrupting anything am I?”
Gabriel grinned widely up at Dean and stepped forward to shake his hand. “Nice to meet you Dean-o. I’ve heard so much about you!” He flashed Dean a wink and received a kick in the ankle from Castiel for it.
“You’re kidding right?” Dean chuckled uncertainly. “And here I thought you were gonna warn me about him like everyone else.”
“Well, aside from that, I was wondering if you had a minute. I wanted to go over those equations you gave me before my auto-shop class. I’m a bit stuck.” He rubbed the back of his neck.
John unfortunately had no desire to listen to any of it, so later that night, Bobby came to Dean and offered for him to move in with him instead. There was no thinking about it either, Dean took the opportunity and ran with it.
Benny laughed. “Hold up one minute there Dean. How and why is Cas living here? That seems a bit coincidental.” He arched a suspicious brow, though his tone suggested he was teasing him.
Dean nodded, his drink poised at his lips. He took a sip and replied. “Yup, sure did. Nothing too exciting, though I did tell him you were up here visiting and that we should all hang out.”
All the more reason to keep Dean at a distance. Which was why Castiel had sat at the back of their class instead of near Dean as he has been accustomed to doing lately. He wasn’t sure he was ever going to be ready to face him after having experienced something so powerful as last nights conversation.
And it didn’t, not really. It still had the power to bring him back to the morning Castiel made Dean breakfast, Dean singing his praises as he dug in. He remembered the looks they shared across the table, Castiel accepting the offer of Dean one day cooking for him with a gentle smile. The knowing looks and secretive little smiles spoke volumes.
He was, if Dean were being completely honest, a strange and intriguing man. They hadn’t interacted a whole lot in the few times they ran into each other, but Dean was, well, intrigued all the same. It had to be the eyes, he had thought on more than one occasion. Those bright blue eyes were hypnotizing, hauntingly so.
Castiel nodded as Charlie took a seat at the edge of the bed. She was speechless, but Cas could see she understood why. “I was…” He took in a steadying breath. “From their perspective I was talking to myself, crying and begging. At some points I was disturbingly silent. I wasn’t in a good place and I’m still not. It’s okay, it was time I sought help anyway. Maybe they can refer me to someone.”
So, for the next two days Castiel did whatever he could to avoid Dean. It was an interesting game of cat and mouse to be sure. If Castiel saw him in the hall he would quickly turn the other way or if they were leaving class, Castiel made sure to make it out before Dean could.
“Cas, calm down. Please, It’s not…Wait..” Her eyes widened when it finally clicked. She glanced at Dean, the back to Castiel. With a thumb pointed in Dean’s direction she asked, “This isn’t the Dean you had a falling out with, is it?”
CasaNova36[2:29PM]: I wasn’t sure what to say to you afterwards. I’ve never done that before, especially with someone whom I’ve never met. As it happens, sending you those photos were a much bigger deal than I had anticipated.
Castiel smiled fondly at them. “Oh, not a whole lot. I’ve been back to work the past couple of days. So that’s been fine. Have my own little office to work from too.”
The short ride was actually pretty eventful too. Becky held on for dear life, giggling the whole way while Charlie tried getting comfortable beneath her boney ass. Ash, well, at one point he weaseled a hand in his pocket and pulled out his flask. He unscrewed the top and took a swig before offering it to Castiel.
It was nice, freeing really, to not have any interruptions from the monster inside him. It was perfectly drowned out, gone. He wondered if this was what it would be like to completely free, to be normal like everyone else. One day, he told himself.
And why the hell did thoughts of Castiel have to flit through his mind during a very private moment with a nice lady? It frustrated him to no end. Wasn’t that the reason he sought her out in the first place? She was a temporary distraction from the bullshit where that man was concerned. Perhaps he thought that he would be cured of all thoughts and desires he had of Castiel if he just buried himself within some pretty thing. That was a fallacy though.
Castiel shrugged his shoulders, the corner of his mouth tugging upwards in a quirky sort of smile. It was a smile he couldn’t quite hide from the girls, especially Charlie.
Castiel smiled, genuinely, even as confused and surprised as he was. He was actually quite glad to see the younger Winchester. “It’s uh; it’s good to see you Sam.” He held the door open, motioning for Sam to come inside. “How did you know where my dorm room was?”
He chuckled. Oh yeah, Cas was cute when he was buzzed. “If you say so.” He waved down their waitress for another round of beers and a second AMF for Castiel.
CasaNova36[1:09PM]: Or, maybe you thought it would be easier to explore your sexuality without judgement.
Later on, when they reached the end of their meal, both taking sips of their second beer of the night, Sam broached the subject about their relationship, as temporary as it was. “So uh, I’m curious.” Sam began.
Food was soon ordered, the pair deciding to share a basket of wings, fries and cheese curds. Dean, not having had anything to eat since noon, was already feeling pretty great. The tequila shot having done its job and warming his entire body. He ordered a few more shots, whiskey this time, and a refill on his and Castiel’s beer.
Benny laughed. “It’s so much fun watching you fumble around there brother. So he gave you his number huh?” He asked as he walked over to the pool table and began setting up a game. He shrugged then. “Text him! You do what you want, you know I’ll back ya.”
“Castiel. I must level with you here. It’s indicated in your health chart and health history that you ah – for lack of better phrasing – went through something pretty traumatic three years ago. Your body was forced into a heat cycle by way of some serious medications and afterwards you were immediately put on heat suppressants. Your reproductive system has been more or less dormant for the past three years, unnaturally so.”
“Listen to that baby purr!” He announced as he ran his fingers lovingly over the hood of the car. He leaned down and reached under the lip of the hood, popping it with minimal effort. He propped the hood up with the metal bar and motioned for Castiel to come near.
Posse_Magnet67[8:52AM]: No, not really. I feel like a lot is riding on this one so I guess I’m just really not looking forward to it.
“You gotta let loose every once in a while, baby bro. I worry about ya.” Gabriel told him earlier that afternoon. Castiel supposed it was true, he had been feeling a bit stretched thin the past month. Working two jobs, tutoring and being a full-time student was starting to take its toll on him. But even though he knew a few drinks might do him some good, Castiel instantly regretted his decision as soon as he reached the front gate. Even more so as he ascended the steps to the desk. There were so many people in attendance, one already puking their guts out into the bushes and it was only 9:30PM. It was going to be a long night.
“No, its fine. I’m moving in with my sister, here, in town.” Maybe he shouldn’t have told him anything. Dean was right, after all, it wasn’t really his place, but Cas didn’t see why he shouldn’t be nice here.
Dean mulled over the question throughout his morning routine before class, Casanova’s voice replaying in his head. It was uncanny how similar the two were, how when they both spoke it sounded like they gargled a bunch of rocks. It was very deep, gravelly. He’d recognize it anywhere, which alone had to say something.
Slamming the door behind him was probably a bit overkill, but it did have the desired effect. Castiel was beyond frustrated at this point and if slamming doors was effective enough to relieve some of that frustration then God damnit; he’ll slam ten more if he had to.
The thought of Sam brought a smile to his face. Castiel had woken up that morning to a pleasant good morning text along with some well wishes for his day ahead. It had been so very long since he’s been on the receiving end of such texts and it just felt good. It didn’t matter that it was temporary, not really anyway, what mattered what that Castiel was happy and comfortable with Sam. And he was.
Tentatively Castiel reached for Posse Magnet’s hood and began to push it down. He was stopped however, a look of alarm on the man’s face. He pulled it back up, just enough and leaned in close to whisper in Castiel’s ear. “Not yet Sunshine.” Instead of pulling back, he angled his head and without a moment’s hesitation he pressed his lips against Castiel’s.
Castiel smiled, incredibly grateful for Dean’s help. If it weren’t for his kindness he wasn’t sure how he would have been able to cope.
“What’s that?” Becky went to stand behind Charlie’s chair, reading over her shoulder as she clicked on the name and began composing a message.
Castiel paused and glanced over at the car, its black paint shining in the late September sun. It was certainly a beautiful car and Castiel was half tempted to take him up on the offer. “Uh, no, its okay. My dorm isn’t far from here. I’ll walk.”
Oh, good Lord. Charlie rolled her eyes. “Dude! I was going to yesterday since you took forever to get back to me, but Cas and Dean had a pretty huge falling out so my priorities shifted.”
There had to be something he could do to be rid of the voice, a way to drown it out. Only one thing really came to mind and that was the emergency stash of whiskey Gabriel had gifted him on his first day of college. Castiel at the time had tried to refuse the bottle, but Gabriel implored him to accept it. He said something about how every college kid needed a secret stash.
Dean chuckled a bit, his jeans really starting to constrict, which was becoming quite the problem. Hearing Castiel – no, Casanova – speak like this was almost too much. He stood and wandered into his room with his beer. He needed the extra privacy even though he was completely alone. One just never knew when Sam might decide to return home and interrupt things. “If you weren’t drinking, would you still flirt shamelessly with me?” Dean asked as he plopped down on his bed.
So all in all, it really wasn’t much of a contest. Arthur Ketch seemed like he might being a bit of a pompous jerk, if the stereotypes of lawyers he had in mind held any sort of merit. His biography was also the shortest and to be honest, he wasn’t interested in being a third partner in anything. No offence to Ketch of course. And Micheal Cohen, well, there wasn’t much about him that stood out at all. Sure, the guy was quite attractive and would probably make for a great heat partner but there just wasn’t anything about the guy that struck Castiel as interesting.
Oh yes, she was perfect. Smooth legs, plump breast – a good handful too – and a firm ass beneath a tight little skirt he could grab onto. They had made it back to the Impala and she was on him in an instant. Lips pressed firmly against his, her hands tugging his hips towards her own. She was just as desperate and needy as he was, her fingers itching to touch bare skin just as his were.
Dean sighed, hands pressed firmly against the countertop. He had to talk to someone about this and Sam had always been there for him, right? They were brothers after all. “I think I fucked up Sam…No, I’m pretty sure I did.”
“I’m serious Dean…I understand you want to be there to help me, but I can’t subject you to these things. I need to do this, alone.”
Posse_Magnet67[4:09PM]: No, of course not. I’ve been okay with it since the beginning, your profile said you were a man lol Though, I’ve never given my sexuality a whole lot of thought. I suppose I’m Bi. What about you?
Dean took notice of the cynical sarcasm and watched Cas take a drink. The light in his blue eyes changed, dimmed in a way. He could sense a story there, hidden deep behind those eyes. Had Castiel suffered at the hands of his own family too? “Well, you’ve got Gabriel. He’s a cool dude.”
Castiel hummed around a bite of food, a memory of the night prior to that morning replaying in his mind. He had been fairly drunk during the call, but he could still clearly recall baring his soul to someone whom he was certain was a near complete stranger.
Castiel rubbed his hands together in defeat, his argument lost when he saw the look on her face. It was one that screamed “I’ve heard this argument before.” “Well…Not long. Three days probably.”
There he was, standing before a full-length mirror on the back of a door, the room full of steam, and a towel resting dangerously low on his hips. The message “Good morning handsome” in heavily edited text covered his face.
When Castiel’s own laughter died down he spoke again. “To answer your question, I’m not dating anyone.” He picked up a lone cheese curd, dipped it in the house sauce and popped it in his mouth.
“Ohh.” Castiel glanced up at the bar wall full of liquor bottles. “Well, there’s Lucien for one. Though most of us call him Lucifer, or Luci, cause’ why not? Then there’s Uriel, another angel, oh and there’s Sammandriel. Though it was much easier just to call him Sam.”
He wasn’t supposed to be pining for the man. Not after nearly five years. Certain things still stung, sure, but it didn’t really hurt anymore, not like it used to. He’d gotten over it, had forgiven Dean and ultimately forgave himself for leaving the way he did, how poorly he handled the situation without really thinking. However, he apparently hadn’t gotten over Dean himself, if the mess he made was anything to go by.
“Yeah yeah, why don’t you two just go get a room already.” The joke was made lightheartedly of course. It wasn’t just Bobby that teased Dean relentlessly about his love for the near fifty-four year old car. God, fifty-four years old and she was still running stronger than ever.
Shit…After his night with Pamela, after the words she had spoken to him, Dean came to the sudden, near unfortunate conclusion that no matter how many women he slept with, he was still painfully attracted to him. He couldn’t deny it, but he just didn’t understand why. Dean had ran into ex’s before and never once did he think about how much he’d love to rekindle something between them, hell no. The most he would have gone was for a quick roll in the hay for old time’s sake, but to repair bridges? Nope.
Castiel grinned, one hand sliding down Dean’s side and back around to grasp a firm hold on his ass. The act surprised him, causing him to jump, his face heating up at the sudden contact. “Well, where’s the fun in that?” Shit, was this a true side of Castiel Dean was viewing? He never thought in a million years Castiel, the socially awkward nerd in the back of the class would ever get up the nerve to openly grope another person, let alone him. But fuck…It was hot. And it was very hard not to give in.
“You know I’m right here, right?” But the other two wouldn’t listen. So with an exasperated sigh, he took the spatula from Anna and tended to the pancakes that were about to burn.
“Yeah, I pegged that one from the start. She always had that bookish charm about her.” Dean laughed.
When the sedation finally wore off, however, he was quiet, eerily so…Even now, it was hard not to think about what ran through his mind during those lonely hours. “They uh, they mentioned something about getting me a psych eval.”
Dean’s alarm the following morning was quite jarring, more than usual. It forcefully pulled him away from the peace that sleep offered and thrust him right into the waking world where all his worries and fears remained, waiting for him, and where everything you did mattered in one way or another.
“A week went by without much incident. I was quiet, did as I was told. Went to school, did my homework; I thought it was over. That all I needed was a stern talking to by our pastor to put me on the right path. But, by the end of the week it turned out it wasn’t enough. Uncle Zach wasn’t the least bit satisfied.
“Yeah, for a few years now.” Jo returned with their beer mugs in hand, grinning as she set them down on the table. Sam smiled up at her in a silent thanks. He had a really kind smile, one that showed absolute sincerity. The alpha seemed to exude kindness from his very being, which was an interesting trait for an alpha, not that alphas didn’t know how to be compassionate or anything. Sam was a gentleman, a man who clearly cared about others no matter their gender which was something Castiel could greatly appreciate. A part of him wondered what Sam’s unique alpha nature looked like; would he still portray a sense of gentleness in his actions, or was there something a bit more…Animalistic beneath the exterior? “Thanks Jo.”
Dean relaxed against the pillows, a sigh of relief escaping him. The nurse worked in taking down his vitals and his oxygen levels. Thank God Cas was okay. The thought of losing him, of never being able to reconcile things with him, it was terrifying. Yet, hearing that he was okay? That was the first hurdle.
Dean snorted as he scrolled through his phone idly in bed, curled up under the blankets. Sam was such an idiot though. Why the hell would he be interested in Castiel?
Green eyes drifted down to Castiel’s lips, the look of desire clear as day written all over Dean’s face. Dean wanted to kiss him; he was going to kiss him. And damn, how a part of him really wanted him to.
Castiel liked Becky, he had found a sort of kinship with her. She was a nerd, quirky. She was always writing and almost always had at least two notebooks on her. She was picked on now and again just as Cas had been in the past, but no matter what, Becky always came out on top. Castiel was grateful to call her a friend.
He was asking for permission and it was all Castiel could do to keep his composure.  He gazed into those green eyes, the pupils blown wide with desire, and he nodded his head. It was small, but it was all Dean needed. He cursed under his breath; which sent another jolt of pleasure through Castiel, and he went to make his move, the gap slowly closing. God this was it, Dean was going to kiss him.
“Nothing happened.” Castiel repeated himself. “At least, I don’t think anything did.” They met up for lunch, him and Charlie. He didn’t quite feel like hunting her down so he sent her a text and suggested they grab a bite to eat and talk about some interesting developments in his life. Charlie was more than excited to hear all about it.
“Dean deserves better than me…As much as I want him in my life, to be around him, to see him smile and to laugh at his stupid jokes…” Castiel smiled, the various memories playing out before him. But that smile eventually faded into that of a frown as he turned to look at Sam. “How can I make someone else happy if I, myself, am not happy?”
But now, with the sky grey and dark and the wind blowing about the dying leaves, his heart ached at the sight of Castiel. He was instantly reminded of how angry he was, of how he was physically pushed away.
Thank God for Sammy though. He may be the biggest health nerd on the planet, and some of the things he preaches about sound like utter bullshit half the time, but his words of advice were spot on when it came to preventing hangovers.
“You okay there brother?” Benny’s question cut through his thoughts, bringing him back to the present.
That only made Dean laugh some more. “Man, you and my brother would get along way too well. Maybe I should set you two up.” Casanova sniggered at that.
Castiel sighed and sat back in his chair, his fingers playing with the fork on his plate. “I saw Mathew.”
Ash scrolled over to view the results and there it was. An email that not only was linked to the chat app, but it was also linked to a Facebook page and an Instagram account. The links to both were right there.
It was as though everything that happened between him and Cas were nothing more than a dark memory he no longer wished to revisit. He had told himself over and over that he hated Castiel until he believed it and it no longer hurt. Low and behold, it actually worked!
“So, they essentially signed you up on a dating site through their clinic?” Gabriel sipped his coffee.
Castiel needed an alpha. Deep down, he knew that. He also knew that it had to be Sam, it just had to, despite his reservations about it. Sam was his best option, his only option. Needless to say, the stress Castiel found himself in lead him to the entrance doors to Harvelle’s Roadhouse that following Thursday night after his shift at Luci’s Used Books. This was honestly saying something because he hardly ever went seeking out the comfort of a dive bar all by his lonesome. But, there he was, taking a seat right up there at one end of the bar, far away from the rowdy group on the opposite side.
CasaNova36[8:53AM]: I don’t think anyone enjoys taking tests, lol So you’re not alone. I think you’ll do fine.
Dean looked up from his lap and gazed at Castiel, unshed tears in his eyes. He shook his head. “No, it wasn’t him. My dad was gone that night.”
“Man, you sure you can’t just do my work for me? I’ll make it worth your while.” Dean winked and laughed at the reaction he got out of Cas. Was the dude blushing? He was only half serious of course. He slouched in his seat and took a sip of the soda that their waitress had brought them just a moment before.
“Yeah,” Sam pulled on his coat and grabbed his keys. “I picked up a few extra hours at the store. Besides, it doesn’t look like you’ll be needing me here.” He teased, glancing between the pair. “See ya guys!”
Castiel’s brows furrowed in a bit of confusion as it took him a moment to understand what Dean was trying to say. But when he did, oh, his eyes widened and his face turned a brilliant shade of red. “Oh! Uh, no. We didn’t.” A nervous chuckle escaped him as he turned off the stove. “But you did hit on me. A few times.”
Dean went through his book bag and pulled out a notebook with a few old assignments placed between the pages. “I’ll be honest, I don’t understand half of this garbage. Here; my notes and some of my assignments I totally bombed.” He plopped the notebook in front of Castiel and they got to work.
For the two days she waited, she had decided to do a bit of investigating herself. On day one she spent most of her time searching around online to see if she could find out anything more about Dean without being creepy and talking to him in person. She didn’t know him that well and she was positive he would grow a little suspicious.
After shutting off the water in his shower, Castiel grabbed the towel and wrapped it low on his hips. With a grin he grabbed his phone and turned on the camera, the idea to get back at Posse Magnet having been on his mind since the night before. He snapped a couple photos of himself in the mirror, ensuring to get just the right angles to show off his own abs, the glass of whiskey he drank before the shower having fueled this idea and brought it to life. Once satisfied with the right photo, he sent it off with a message.
It took Castiel a moment to realize he was looking at Dean’s score on their calculus test. His eyes widened in a bit of disbelief. “You got a B. Dean, that’s great!”
I’m currently single as my job takes up much of my time but I can’t say that I’m not looking. Whatever happens, happens.
One thing was for sure, Castiel needed some serious advice and after a week of contemplating picking up the phone and calling Naomi, he actually did. He thought perhaps he could calm down and relax from the encounter all on his own, but his mind was riddled with questions and his body hummed with a bit of anxiety where Dean was concerned. So Cas gave his therapist a call.
The pleasant phone call eventually ended after a few more minutes, Dean siting that he really needed to focus on finishing his lunch before his break was up. Sam agreed and hung up, which left Dean with the realization that there officially was no longer a point in sending Castiel a photo of his now more than half eaten sandwich and an empty bag of chips. Oh well, it was a stupid idea anyway, he’ll figure it out later. Although, the fact that he was fretting over a simple texting opportunity confused the shit out of him. He and Cas were somewhat friends again; sorta. So he shouldn’t have to worry about whether or not he could text the guy. Cas did give him his number for a reason, so…
Dean wasn’t sure what came over him when he suggested that Castiel stay for the afternoon. He agreed nonetheless, which made him happy. Perhaps Dean was a glutton for punishment, or he was just plain stupid and deliberately ignoring the warning bells going off. Where exactly was the harm though? So what if he wanted to spend the afternoon with the guy and rebuild whatever friendship they once had?
Castiel fidgeted in his seat, the situation suddenly becoming incredibly overwhelming for him. Waves of unease washed over him at the thought of sharing something intimate with Sam crossed his mind. It was strange, uncomfortable even, but that stemmed from the way Naomi discussed it like it were a business transaction. He glanced briefly over at Sam with an uncertain curiosity. Sam noticed and gave him a sheepish sort of grin, his pheromones reaching out to calm Castiel. The warmth of vanilla and maple wrapped around him like a blanket, Sam’s smile telling him he knew just how apprehensive he was about everything. He could get through this, just one step at a time.
CasaNova36[11:20AM]: Now you’re making me think? Lol I don’t know. I’d travel, get out of the country. I’d tell my uncle he can go fuck himself and I’d be half tempted to burn down our Pastor’s church on mere principal. I’d have one year, so what are they gonna do? Imprison me for life? Good luck lol
“I trusted you Dean, even when we weren’t talking in person, I trusted you to respect my wishes. But you broke it.” An angry tear rolled down his cheek, but he quickly wiped it away. He would be damned if he looked weak in front of this asshole. “I’m done.”
“Hey, don’t shoot me for just asking. It’s just not like you to sit alone at the bar with these brooding shoulders of yours.” He slapped him on the shoulder before retrieving his drink and taking a sip. “Besides, a little birdie told me you and my brother are on the outs. Care to tell me what happened?”
Dean wanted him to hang out? Well, of course he did, they were friends. It was just surprising and Castiel was conflicted. He wanted to stay, to hang out, but a part of him felt like he might be overstepping his bounds and intruding on Dean’s space. Besides, why would anyone still want to spend time with the person who brutally abandoned them? “Uhm, I don’t know, Dean…That –“
“Ohh probably. Though if you did it might make things a little easier. A part of me was kind of hoping you would to be honest.” The last statement was only half true, more or less. While, before he made the call, he did hope he was recognized and with that he hoped to move things along. His getting over Castiel bullshit for one.
“We’ll get you set up in the OR as soon as possible.” The doctor began as he disposed of the gloves he used for the examination. “It should be a pretty routine C-section. We’ll get you numbed up real good and you’ll be able to meet your daughter soon.”
“Just peachy!” He sipped his beer and regarded Anna who all but face palmed, exasperated. He could tell she was judging them and clearly trying hard not to laugh at the awkwardness between them. Which, yeah, this was horribly awkward. They could pretend to be friends right? They could be cordial and forget about the elephant in the room.
But fuck he didn’t want to lose this. Whatever shred of connection they may still have, Dean wasn’t ready to let go of any of it. And yet at the same time he was risking it all. He knew deep down that he was going to lose Castiel forever after all was said and done. Dean only wished that by the end of it, Cas would hear him out at least.
“Stuff it Sammy and do your homework.” His phone chimed again and instead of Casanova; it was a text from an unknown number.
Castiel’s companion leaned close then and whispered a hushed “Cassie dear, aren’t you going to introduce me to your new friend?”
Castiel eventually gave in after they couldn’t find anything else. He promised Dean he would at least get through the first three episodes. Needless to say, after the third episode, Castiel agreed to allow the fourth to play.
His family’s pastor, for whatever reason, was haunting him, tormenting him. He could hear him now in fact, laughing through his own sobs. But God, why! Castiel hadn’t seen the horrible man in years. Why was this happening? Why now?
Castiel turned to Dean then, a look of calm seriousness on his face. “I don’t hate you, Dean.” It was the truth. As much as Cas hated what he had done, he couldn’t hate the person. Dean had a good heart, he just made stupid choices. Castiel’s eyebrows furrowed in confusion. “..I wasn’t aware you had a sister.”
Everything happened pretty quickly after that. He was rolled into the operating room with his mate following beside them; a sheet had been pulled up in front of him as soon as he was situated in the room. Thank God, he wasn’t sure how he would be able to handle seeing everything being performed on him no matter how strong the epidural was. Mathew stood by his side, dressed head to toe in those ridiculous scrubs that made Castiel laugh. It was all pretty routine, just as the doctor had said it would be.
Castiel looked up when he noticed Dean and visibly gulped when he made his way over. Did he look nervous? Why would he be nervous? His body language said it all though; the wide eyes, the shifting in his seat and the tugging at his own clothes. How odd.
“I did. Took me three months to win her over, but I eventually won out in the end despite Ellen here.” Dean grinned, feeling quite proud of himself.
“Oh, uhm. Well, he’s here, somewhere.” He grinned sheepishly, glancing around briefly. He still wasn’t anywhere in sight. “We’re uh, supposed to finally meet tonight.”
Dean made his way across the courtyard and when Castiel finally took notice of him he shifted on his feet and pushed away from the tree. He looked nervous, apprehensive. However, he didn’t appear angry and for that Dean was exceptionally grateful.
Dean had wanted to eat, he really did. But his appetite just wasn’t there anymore. He thought back on the last time he had seen Cas, the way in which they parted ways. He had begged for Cas to see reason, begged him to stay. But Cas said he couldn’t trust him anymore, so why would he have stayed?
Posse Magnet nodded. “I am too…You ready?” Without saying another word, they both reached for the fastenings of their own masks. With a deep breath on both their parts, they took them off at the same time.
Yeah, well, patience and Dean didn’t exactly mix well as it happened. He listened to what Gabriel had to say, allowing each word to sink in. But God, he just can’t. He can’t sit on his ass and wait for Cas to ‘come around’ and miss out on other opportunities. Especially when Cas was basically pretending he didn’t exist.
Okay, so who the fuck was this woman? Was she a psychic or something, because it was starting to freak him out a little here. If it weren’t for the buzz he still felt he would have told her to stay the fuck out of his business.
“It’s good to see you again Sam.” Naomi smiled as she opened a file in front of her. “As you know, Sam, Castiel is in need of a partner. His cycle starts in about a month, which gives you two plenty of time to develop a relationship of sorts.”
“I don’t know! I didn’t exactly feel the need to run over there and ask him, I had other important matters to tend to.”
She had hoped to find any sort of incriminating information that may link him to who Castiel has been talking to online. Starting with Facebook, Charlie found him instantly. Although, it appeared he didn’t log on very often, his last post being nearly five months back; something family related. There were some photos though, a few selfies of him and his brother Sam while the rest were of his prized 67 Chevy Impala.
“Becky’s right. Take a day, sit on it. You don’t wanna go in there, guns blazing without a plan first, right?” Ash chuckled lightly in hopes to alleviate the tension in the room.
“Of course.” Naomi nodded. “We can always do a sort of Skype therapy session if you ever need it. We can figure out payment for that later on down the road if that’s something you’re interested in.”
Dean scoffed at the audacity. “You’re giving me the speech. Trust me man, I know how this goes, I’ve given it more times than I can count.”
He spent the next few days thinking about it and weighing his options, all the while discussing further boundaries with Sam through text, or phone calls whenever Sam was available between shifts. Castiel had thought very briefly that maybe he could try out the other two alphas if they were still available, but even that didn’t sit well with him. Besides, if he knew Sam wasn’t going to really work out, being his best option, then the other two definitely weren’t going to work out. Instinct was quite the beast itself when your heat cycle was looming up ahead.
He pulled out his phone again after a few more sips, a huge, perhaps drunken smile on his face as he typed out another message to Posse Magnet.
Castiel nodded. “He threw holy water on me, prodded me with a damn cattle prod. He chanted in Latin over and over, calling on God to tear the demon out of me. But it wasn’t enough. No matter how much I begged and pleaded…” He choked on another sob, the following memories playing out before him.
“Of sure, yeah, that’d be great. Thanks Jo.” He watched her take her leave before sitting back down on the stool.
Dean shut off the water and rushed to dry off the Impala best he could before running across the lot to the main office. He’s done much more thorough jobs in the past when it came to the finer touches of cleaning his car in the past, but, well, lord help him, his inner alpha was itching to be near Castiel.
Castiel [9:36AM]: A little bit? Lol Dean, that’s dangerous. I don’t want you to wind up in the hospital again.
“What’s that supposed to mean? ‘Helping the guy out’?” Dean swayed a little on his feet when Sam shut off the bathroom light, pushed past him and back down the hall. Dean followed of course, pestering Sam about his date, asking all sorts of invasive questions.
Posse_Magnet67[3:18PM]: I could probably use some myself, lol Tell you what, my brother is leaving here in a few hours to do God knows what, I’ll give you a call when he leaves and you can answer or not, I wont be offended.
“Oh, I don’t know. Been on a few dates, nothing has stuck though obviously. I’m honestly too busy right now to even think about finding a nice girl.” He shrugged and glanced back at his menu. “To be honest, I really thought you were going to tell me that you and Jo were getting back together.”
The next couple of days kind of flew by. Him and Castiel haven’t texted since the last time they had and Dean was a little bit hesitant to send him one all on his own. He was still sort of taken aback by what Pamela told him, how he should go after what he wants if he wants to be happy in the end. While the encounter was everything he needed at the time, her words had unfortunately put a bit of a damper on things.
“Oh…God, C-Claire,” Castiel gazed tearfully down at their lifeless little girl. It wasn’t supposed to happen like this, it shouldn’t have happened like this. If he had been a female presenting omega then their pup would have been alive and well, kicking and screaming at the time of birth. “Please cry for Daddy and Papa…Please-!” But she wouldn’t. Her cheeks should have been pink and rosey, her eyes should have been squinting against the bright lights overhead, but no, she was absolutely still, pale and cold in his arms.
“I have not. Not yet.” He shook his head. “I figured I could handle it for the time being. But as luck would have it, the whiskey only helps, well, very little.”
As it turns out, Castiel’s date with Sam a few days later went really well, amazing actually. Sam had picked him up at his house around noon and they grabbed coffee from a small coffee stand before making it to the museum. They bought their tickets and Sam ushered Castiel inside on ahead of him, his hand lightly pressed against the small of his back. He was clearly testing the waters of propriety with a curiosity and a gentlemanly manner Cas had appreciated. It was actually quite nice, having the door held open for him when necessary and hell, even that small touch alone from an alpha was quite pleasant.
For now though, fuck it. He knew what he wanted and with it in front of him, offered like a delicious meal on a silver platter, he wasn’t going to ignore it. Dean wanted Castiel, and he has never really stopped wanting him. While the flirtatious banter honestly scared him, had him fearing that Cas was only here to deliver the worst, Dean still wanted to try all over again. Cas said this was on his terms, right? Then Dean was certainly going to take control of the situation and not swell on the past. He was going to be friends with Cas, they’d do whatever it was friends did together, but he wasn’t going to make the first move. Not unless he knew 100% that Castiel’s intentions were good.
Dean nodded, taking a moment to think and gather what he wanted to say next. He sighed and gazed up at the night sky briefly. “…It’s going to be a while.”
Curious, Benny turned around just in time to see Castiel take a seat with two other girls. The laugh that followed was uncontrollable and the look on Dean’s face? Priceless. “Oh man, you’ve got it bad!”
“I couldn’t agree more. So, what would you like to know? I can tell you now, I’m really not that interesting.”
It wasn’t until they were forced in this predicament that Dean slowly realized how fucked he was. Had he known that Gabe’s brother was drop dead gorgeous in a weird, nerdy sort of way, he probably would have kept his distance. Maybe.
Dean tucked his phone away and clapped Gabriel on the shoulder. “Pretty great party you’re throwing.” He smiled and briefly glanced over at Castiel. He nodded in acknowledgment and Castiel could feel the heat rise up his neck. So, he lifted his cup to his lips and took quite a few large gulps of his meager Screwdriver to distract himself.
Dean waited until Cas was good and seated off to his left a few seats but a row behind them before he answered with a sigh. “It aint good, I can tell you that much.” God he was so screwed. In the midst of all his overthinking he had tried to convince himself that he was just drunk. Being under the influence made a person do crazy things, right? Surely that was the case. But seeing Castiel simply walk through the classroom door seemed to throw all that logic out the window.
Checking his phone, Cas noticed he had a few missed texts and a couple phone calls from Charlie and Becky. He supposed he felt bad for leaving them in the dust, but hey, Charlie knew what he was about. He typed a quick reply to Charlie, letting her know he was fine and pocketed his cell.
“I don’t know, about 90 miles or so last I checked. I can’t drive it like this though, I’m gonna end up blowing the engine if I do and I don’t have any water on me.”
“Uh, yeah…So, we hung out at The Roadhouse the other night with his sister. Totally unplanned by the way.” He took another bite of his sandwich.
Posse_Magnet67[11:36AM]: Trust me, I now exactly what you mean. I’m going through the same thing. Just this past month I have been kinda, idk, exploring other possibilities…It can be scary.
Gabriel blinked once, twice. “Well what the hell is he doing back in town?” He threw up his hands, exasperated. The scent of curiosity soured into something more unforgiving and bitter. Castiel didn’t blame him, especially considering Gabriel has always wanted to teach the alpha a lesson or two for hurting Castiel in the way that he did.
“Cas came over a few days ago. He wouldn’t stop texting and he never texts nonstop like that. So he was obviously talking to you.”
“But if it weren’t for me, s-she would still be alive…Oh God.” More memories of that night returned, flooding his mind. He remembered waking up to the sound of something crashing downstairs and he had felt compelled to go investigate. At the top of the landing he heard her scream and it was the most terrifying sound he had ever heard.
Castiel shook his head. “There’s nothing you can do Dean…” He glanced down at his hands, fingers picking at a loose hangnail. “As difficult as this decision is, its uh…It’s too late for any reconciliation.”
God, the moment was there, Cas could feel it deep in his bones. Dean wanted to kiss him, he could tell by the way he shifted to a more comfortable position – which brought him mere inches away from him – and the way in which he moistened his lips, preparing to close to gap.
Posse_Magnet67[12:47PM]: He doesn’t understand most things, lol It’s funny how we both know him. Makes you seem even more real, like we are closer somehow.
Unable to stop himself, Castiel slid his boxers down over his hips, allowing his leaking cock to spring free. He licked his lips as his fingers wrapped themselves around his length and he gave an experimental tug. He gasped, his hips rolling forward with pleasure. Oh, God, it had been so long since he allowed himself this pleasure. How had he managed to deny himself of it all these years? To abstain? It felt so good. If only Posse Magnet were truly there.
Dean cut him off. “Oh God yes, of course I do.” He wrapped his arm around his waist and pulled him close. “I’m just saying we shouldn’t rush things. And we especially shouldn’t stow away in a closet somewhere.”
“Castiel…”He began as though testing the name on his tongue, giving Castiel a cheeky grin. “Well Castiel, I’m Dean. I’m sorry we couldn’t have met under different circumstances, but here we are. It’ll be fine, we’ll figure it out.” The alpha, Dean, seemed pretty damn confident that everything was going to be fine, even though it didn’t feel like it at all to Castiel. Maybe it would be eventually, but not now.
Both had been pretty good but Castiel, during the night, was still very much distant, lost in that post heartbreak haze with the proverbial psychotic break cherry right on top. His heart ached and all he wanted to do was to take it all back, start over and pretend it never happened.
“Well Jo’s not exactly wrong. I haven’t been on a real date in ages, so it’s nice to go out and spend some time with another person, get to know them.”
Castiel looked just as surprised to see him as Dean was; his hands were visibly shaky as he readied himself to take Dean’s order. If there wasn’t any bad blood between them, Dean would have thought the flustered look was adorable. Hell, who was he kidding? It was adorable. He mentally added another checked box to the growing list of why he was an asshole.
“What?” Castiel clearly heard him. It wasn’t like Gabriel was trying to be sneaky about it. His heart ached at the vague, indirect mention of Dean. “What are you talking about?”
CasaNova36[1:05PM]: Maybe. Do you know a Gabriel Novak? He told about this huge party coming up, and I was just curious to see if it was the same one you mentioned.
So, Charlie told her roommate about the other guy Castiel has also been talking to, much to Becky’s dismay. She was adamantly against anyone getting between Castiel and Dean.
“Nope.” Dean laughed and hit send before pocketing his phone. “Oh come on, what else would I have said to him? A photo of us was my best idea. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I need a stiff drink. You want another beer?”
Dean took it and slumped in his seat, his eyes roaming over the equations on the page. “I can’t believe Castiel is giving me homework.” He grinned over the top of the notebook.
“He’s really worried about you, you know. I’m sure you feel like keeping your distance is a good thing, and hey, maybe it is. But, you made him happy Cas. He’d talk about you sometimes and he’s just light, you know?”
Once Castiel was dressed in his own costume Gabe helped bloody him up just so it looked more authentic. Perhaps Castiel the angel had returned home from battle, as was his brothers reasoning for all the fake blood.
Dean had feelings for Castiel, even though he tried his damnedest to deny it. He had been hurt by the rejection, his deepest feelings having been realized in those moments and though he knew he had to move on he couldn’t help the guilt that flooded him as he flirted with another, with Casanova.
Castiel was in an interesting mood after Sam left. He wasn’t quite upset but neither was he okay. Somewhere between the two. There was no doubt about his appreciation for the gesture of greasy food from Dean and he had been so glad to see Sam. He liked the kid and he wished they could retain a friendship despite what was going on with him and his brother.
Jo nodded and wrote it down in her notepad. “Sure thing, I’ll be right back boys.” She gave a wink before taking her leave to put the order in and retrieve their beers.
“I’m sure the same tactic applies. If you’re interested then go over there brother!” Benny urged. Dean, however, still wanted to debate it no matter how sound his friend’s advise and how tempting it was.
The line was moving and Dean eventually found himself at the counter. He quickly pocketed his phone and looked up to make his order when he was met with a pair of brilliant blue eyes.
“Maybe. There’s a lot of research to be done in order to prove or disprove your theory.” Determination filled Charlie as she signed into her email account. She scrolled through her contacts, shaking her head. “I can’t believe I’m doing this…” It didn’t take her long at all to find the correct name as it was pretty close to the top of the list.
Ash and Becky both sidled on over to her, reading the message over her shoulder briefly. “Okay, it’s show time! Plug your phone into the computer and open the program.”
Their game eventually came to an end and Castiel chose to sit at the table with Becky and Charlie while Benny challenged Dean to a round.
CasaNova36[12:32PM]: I didn’t realize how much I hated costume shopping until now. It was much easier when I was a kid.
“Ignore it, got it.” Dean smiled. “You coming or going?” It was a loaded question and Cas could see that Dean knew it too by the look in his eyes. “I’m sorry, I shouldn’t ask. Not my place.” He cleared his throat.
“He shrugged. “What have I got to lose? Should at least apologize for sleeping with his sister.” He stood from the table and wandered into the living towards the front door when Anna called out to him.
“Eh, well, yeah I might have.” When Cas gave him a look, one that said he really shouldn’t have gone to such great lengths for his car, Dean added. “Look, the thing was dirty and it was high time she got a bath. Besides, I had the spare time so I figured why the hell not?”
Thanks for all the lovely comments ^_^ It's the fuel that drives me to bring you more wonderful chapters
God he couldn’t get enough of this, it was as though Dean was parched, starving even and all that helped was Castiel. But he pulled back and took his hand. “Come with me. Let’s play a few classic Halloween games, dance some more, drink some more. Then I’ll take you to a quiet corner out in the backyard and we can finally take off our masks.”
“I have too much already on my plate. I don’t need anymore stress.” It came out a bit harsher than he intended, but he had to get the point across. Dean, for a moment, looked pissed. But then a smirk broke out on his face.
Okay, he was definitely flirting, had to be right? This conversation wasn’t all that innocent. Even through the haze of liquor, Dean could see the call backs to a time where they were completely okay with each other and the even smaller hints that if you squinted hard enough, you could see he was calling back to times when they weren’t that okay with each other.
Dean missed her terribly, and not just because she was gone on a week and a half long vacation. Naw, they had broken up about ten months ago after dating for a year and a half. Though it was a more or less mutual break up, Dean stilled missed being with her.
Posse_Magnet67[8:14PM]: Well no, lol, Although I’ve been told I have the looks for it. I just really like dressing up, okay? Besides, these photos will be for you, that way you will know who to look for at the party :)
Castiel turned and looked at him scathingly. “I’m listening.” He shook his arm free and crossed them over his chest, closing himself off.
Castiel was happy? Did Dean make him so? The gentle expression on his face and the light in his eyes seemed to suggest so. Dean hummed, aware of the moment presented to him. There was no more cause for hesitation, this was it.
They gazed at each other for a moment, Cas fiddling around with his key. Even though Dean appeared to be relieved that Castiel wasn’t totally freaked out – though he truly was – he still looked like he was struggling with something. As though he wanted to say something else regarding what almost happened. He just couldn’t find the words.
“Ah, lucky and smart.” Dean chuckled. He took a swig of his beer in hopes to calm the rapid beating of his heart. He had been the one to kiss Cas and fuck, it was all adding up so fast. The dude’s voice being identical to Castiel’s, the falling out he had with a friend and how that friend had been the one to make the move. It was all becoming clear, but Dean couldn’t just accuse the guy when he wasn’t 110% positive of his identity.
“It’s a lot.” Dean chuckled. “You’ll want to hear about it over some beers. So, how about The Roadhouse? I’ll meet ya there.”
Castiel took in a deep, steadying breath. “I need to get away from you, from our school, this city. The memories of it alone, I...” He glanced away to compose himself, his chin trembling with the weight of his emotions threatening to spill over.
It suddenly hit him all at once; the party, revealing himself to Castiel, picking him up just to take him home…He shouldn’t have been driving, he knew that. Cas had told him so…Then they were hit…
However, he did move, though not further away to keep distance. No, he shifted closer, his eyes curiously glancing briefly at Dean’s lips. A jolt of awareness shot through him when he saw that Dean was gazing at his too, green eyes lidded with desire.
Dean made his way to the kitchen, the sound of sizzling bacon making his stomach growl. “Whatcha making there Sammy?” He groaned, a hand coming to hold his head as it pounded. Even his own voice aggravated him.
Castiel chuckled and shook his head as he started up the engine. He waved goodbye to Dean before pulling out of the driveway. Dean watched the entire time until the car was gone from view, a grin permanently etched on his face.
She grabbed her purse and car keys from the table by the door and kissed him on the cheek. “I will, don’t worry. I’d invite you out too, but, well, you wouldn’t enjoy being a third wheel. So, how about a rain check? I’ll take you to the Roadhouse in celebration of your move here. What do you say?”
Dean’s heart pounded, completely uncertain of where this was going. All signs seemed to point to something good, yet he was still on edge; apprehensive to even think for a moment that there was hope. “What are you trying to say? Look, don’t get me wrong, I’m glad I’m not delusional in thinking I had actually, rudely, thrown myself at you. But don’t run me around, man. Cas, you shoved me away.”
Shit, maybe Dean was just hallucinating it or something. Maybe his feelings for Cas ran much deeper than he previously thought and he was just projecting onto this guy. He didn’t deserve that. But shit…Dean couldn’t just freak out without any actual proof. Dean had to wait until he had said proof, he must wait until the Halloween party.
“Did Sam really climb on top of the pool table?” Benny asked through his own laughter, a bit skeptical.
At some point when the song began to change and bleed into the next, Dean slowed Castiel down and pressed a kiss to his lips. Savoring the moment, he ran his fingers through Castiel’s semi-damp hair, committing it all to memory. This was it. It was getting late and he needed to rip the band aid off and get this over with. As much as Dean wanted to remain in this fantasy, it needed to be done.
“I was right?” Becky blinked, confused for a moment until it finally clicked in her mind. Her eyes lit up with excitement. “Oh my God, yeah I was! Wow!” She giggled, giving Ash quite the bear hug.
It was strange seeing Castiel like this, slouched in his seat when he normally sat ramrod straight. Most days he was wide awake, glowing.
Every single synapse in Castiel’s brain was firing all at once, each telling him to indulge in this, that he’s wanted this for so long. The temptation was certainly strong, but he just couldn’t. “Let me uh…I’m going to go get you some water, okay? You’re going to need it.”
“I have a younger sister and a lot of cousins. I grew up with most of them. To be honest, they have some pretty unusual names too.”
Dean laughed and tossed his head back. “I’m just kidding! But the look on your face; priceless.” He wandered into the kitchen to grab a couple water bottles. He handed one to Cas and sat back down, lounging comfortably in his spot. “So you work today then huh? What time do you go in?”
Dean sighed and opened the envelope Bobby left that contained some information about Castiel’s car. “You still drive that Lincoln, huh?”
He must have done something wrong to cause the lack in response from Casanova, which therein lies the problem. Dean Winchester just wasn’t good relationship material. Sure, he was attracted to Castiel, wanted him even, but Dean knew he’d only succeed in breaking the man’s heart, even if he was given the opportunity not to screw it up. The same applied to Casanova, Dean, in the back of his mind, was almost certain he’d screw that up too if he hadn’t already.
So, Dean had walked away, a hand running through his hair as he tried to shake off the feeling of utter rejection. It hurt, holy hell did it hurt. But what else was he to expect? Something was bound to pull them apart; someone was bound to get hurt. It never failed.
Dean nodded and took a third shot but missed a few balls. “Thanks man. I hope he has too.” While Benny lined up his shot, Dean pulled out his phone to reply to Cas.
His voice, fuck, it reverberated throughout the whole building, the tone deep and as smooth as honey. It was beautiful…Indescribable. Castiel was enthralled, completely blown away by this hidden talent of his. He sat at the edge of his seat, unable to keep his eyes from Dean, not even to read the lyrics on the screen.
Welcome to chapter 3!! I hope everyone is enjoying so far. I'm gonna try really hard to make my chapters a bit longer, for enjoyment sake. I have future chapters planned out that I imagine are gonna be hella long, so hopefully ya'll will enjoy it.
Dean let out a relieved breath, nodding. “Alright, cool. Well, I should probably get going then. Anna’s likely waiting for ya too.”
“Dean. You were.” Sam laughed, though his demeanor changed shortly after. “It was bad though Dean. The way they described everything to me, and then seeing the aftermath? Dude, you’re incredibly lucky to be alive. If conditions were different, you and Cas would have died. He’ll, you’re lucky enough to survive the brain swelling…I didn’t think you’d wake up…”
The pair both laughed in agreement and got to work. Dean posed a couple times without the full faced mask and a few with it and his gun.
“Oh, already?” Castiel nodded his reply and made for the door. In a hasty, last minute decision, Dean grabbed his leather jacket off the hook and followed. “Here, I’ll walk you out.”
Castiel finished off his drink, the one Dean bought for him. He glanced back over at Dean who was lining up the pool cue on the other side of the table. Their eyes met, bringing on that electric energy again that seemed to tether them together. Dean winked then, the tip of his tongue swiping over his lips before taking the shot. No matter how brief the moment was, the between them was palpably charged.
“Make the Halloween party a night I’ll never forget? Make me forget every little inconvenience disappear?”
Dean rolled his eyes as he worked to remove the wrapping on his burrito. “Yes mom.” He huffed a laugh.
When Dean awoke, he was in a bit of a daze. His heart ached and it irritated him. He never once in his pathetic life allowed someone to make him feel like this. Castiel’s rejection hurt like nothing else, as though he had been stabbed in the gut.
Dean laughed at that and shook his head. “Nope, no we’re not. Good guess though.” He took a swig of his beer when Jo came on by with their shots and Benny’s beer.
“So, what you’re saying is this is it, you’re putting a stop to this before it’s even begun.” Dean was beyond frustrated, every fiber in his being screaming at him to pull Castiel close, to urge him to rethink his decision. But seeing as how Castiel was trying so hard to reign in his emotions, Dean understood just how dire this was for him. He only wished Cas would tell him what was wrong so he could help. How can he just assume that Dean would react badly to it?
Dean shook his head vehemently. “Nope, nuh uh. Sure, he’s hot.” And smells amazing; like how the air smells before a much needed rainstorm. There was an electric sort of quality to it hidden amongst the man’s natural scent and Dean would be a fat fucking liar if he said that alone hadn’t interested him. It was such a peculiar quality in an omega’s scent when many tended to lean a little more on the sweet side. “He’s totally not my type, too much baggage.”
God, being face to face with Dean though, the object of his frustration and anguish from four and a half years ago, it was painful. Seeing Dean with Anna brought back all the emotions he felt when Dean removed his mask. The confusion, the shock and disbelief when it sank in, and oh God, the anger. This time he felt near blind with it and it unsettled him terribly. Castiel didn’t like the reminder that it was. It was dark and unforgiving.
He didn’t receive a reply for another few moments, so he stood there, nursing his drink and people watched. There were so many people here, many of whom he didn’t quite recognize. Most of them were already quite drunk what with the slurring of words and the swaying on their feet.
“Just some lunch. So, uhm, hey, this is Cas. Remember when he came into the shop a while back?” Dean asked his uncle.
Dean waved him off. “Don’t sweat it man, seriously.” He leaned up against the hood, facing Castiel now. His fingers tapped against the metal as though deep in thought. “Look, if you ah…If you really want to make it up to me though, why not come out for a few drinks with me sometime?” And there it was. Super casual, not too much pressure. Easy. Right?
“A B-? Well, that’s better than any other grade I’ve gotten in that class.” He took a seat beside Cas. “Though I’m sure you’re just being overly generous.”
“Ugh, men!” Both girls complained in unison and rolled their eyes. Becky took over the conversation. “Look, Cas, he’s totally showing off right now; the way he’s strutting around the table each time he takes a shot.”
Posse_Magnet67[2:18PM]: Now don’t say that, of course you are! Just slap on some wings and I’ll be sure to get down on my knees and pray
It wasn’t the most exciting thing in the room and he supposed he could have just turned on the television for some sort of entertainment, but it just didn’t hold much appeal to him at all. There was so much going on in his mind, it was loud with wild, scary thoughts, of Alistair laughing as though this had been his plan all along; lead him into a false sense of security.
Casanova’s voice seemed to drop an octave, the deep rumble of it sent delicious shivers down Dean’s spine.
“No, he didn’t. He left the house. It’s fine though, we made up. Me and Anna aren’t going to continue what we had going on…And! Before you butt in, it was Anna’s idea. She didn’t feel comfortable with it anymore so why force it?” Dean knew Sam would have said something if he was given the opportunity. He would have told Dean to screw what Cas says and that he doesn’t control what Dean should and shouldn’t do. For the record, Dean actually happens to agree.
Castiel scrolled through the photos he was given, all of them, his own hand slick with spit, working himself in a nice, steady rhythm. Who was this man? God, how he wanted to know, how he needed to know. What was his name? He had to give him that much, at least.
Becky came over then with a few more shots, enough for the rest of them and handed them out. “Let’s make a toast!” She held out her glass and everyone followed suit. “To…To good friends, good drinks and may tonight be super epic!”
“Of course not! That’s not why I’m here. I know things have been shitty, but I think what you need is a night of letting loose. There’s a Halloween party coming up. A huge party. And you should go. You can dress up, pretend to be someone else for the night and have fun. I think it would do you some good.”
Charlie shook her head and reached for her curly fries. “Nope. Not sure what to say really. Shouldn’t be that hard, right?” She dipped a fry in the ranch and chewed thoughtfully. “I think I’m just worried Cas is going to be mad at me.”
“You don’t have to worry about me saying anything to him. I’m sure he’d understand though.” He took a swig of his beer and put it and his books on the coffee table. To be honest, he could use a bit of a break too. He turned to face Dean, giving him his full attention.
Dean nodded. “Don’t ask me how or why, but there is it.” He tossed back the remainder of his beer. Shit, how much has he had? Maybe he should slow down, if the overwhelming warmth in his body was anything to go on.
Jo rounded back to him, a sweet smile on her face, waiting on his answer. Dean took another swig and shrugged. “Oh, I don’t know if we’ll do that. Not quite sure it would be a good idea.”
Castiel laughed. “Dean, don’t be rude. The story actually seems very interesting. My mother had an affinity for angels. I never did find out why she named me Castiel.”
That brow lifted even higher. “That kind of day huh? You got it.” He nodded and quickly went about pouring him that double whiskey straight, top shelf by the looks of it.
When the thought suddenly occurred to him, Dean quickly swiveled back around and turned his back to the rest of the bar. He downed his beer in a few short gulps and waved for Jo to bring him a shot of something strong. God, he hoped he hadn’t been spotted.
It had been a couple days since Castiel heard from Posse Magnet. He’s sent him a few messages here and there but he hasn’t received any replies, which didn’t exactly sit well with him. He tried to play it off as Posse Magnet being busy with classes and such, however, the other part of him just wished he’d respond.
Castiel’s heart sang at the contact, his heart nearly leaping out of his chest. He smiled against those plump lips and pressed close, deepening the kiss. Posse Magnet’s fingers threaded through his hair and for a moment he wondered why everything felt so perfect. Surely something was bound to ruin it, Alistair probably. There was no way he could get away with kissing another man, none. It should be enough to bring out the monster within.
“So,” Dean started as he stared at the food menu. Chicken wings sounded really good, but then again he also wanted a fat burger…Decisions decisions. “How is life down in the south? Meet any pretty girls?” He grinned.
“Just some woman I met at another bar. Went back to her place, and man, she was, whoo! She was wild and apparently some sort of psychic. Told me I should go after what I want if I wanted to be happy.” He watched Benny take his first shot and after dropping a few balls into a couple pockets, he lined up another. Benny laughed as he took it and shook his head.
Dean [10:14PM]: Oh, well thank you. It’s nothing really lol I suppose you can call it a hidden talent of mine. And yeah! I’ve seen that one. So, you got a Facebook?
Castiel hadn’t been in control of that from what ‘Casanova’ had said…It hadn’t really been the Castiel he grew to know and care for.
“Awe, Benny, you’re a lifesaver.” He quickly popped the Advil and downed over half the water in one go.
“So I should probably prepare myself for all the boring lawyer talk then huh?” Dean laughed, Sam following suit.
“C-Cas?” Oh God, hearing him say his name…Castiel was at a complete loss for words. How, after all these years, was this possible? There was no way, of all the places Castiel could have moved to…He moved here where Dean was. The implication of it all had him flushing and averting his gaze.
“Fuck-!” The man gasped moments before he came, his load shooting all over his chest and oozing down over his fingers, his body shaking and quivering with the intensity of the orgasm.
He opened the message and was immediately knocked breathless. “Fuck…” This wasn’t something he had expected, hell, he didn’t really know what to expect. He stared hard at the shirtless man in the photo, his eyes roaming over the plains of his perfectly defined chest and down his abdomen to the unbuckled jeans at the bottom of the photo. The mystery man held a sign which directly covered his face pretty well, the sign reading: “Hey there CasaNova” And true to his word, there were no real distinguishing features.
Charlie sighed heavily and set her keys back down on her desk. It was a great idea actually, making Dean face reality and owning up to it, to see the look of panic on his face. Oh yeah, she could totally enjoy that. She grinned, scoffing. “How the hell do you come up with these genius ideas?”
Before the kiss could become too deep, too heavy, Posse Magnet pulled back, leaving Cas chasing after his lips. God, the man could kiss and he wanted more. To think he could share this with another man and not freak out was amazing! He didn’t want to stop.
It had been a week since Castiel discovered Dean had slept with his sister the previous night, and as it turned out it wasn’t the only time either. The whole thing was ridiculous and though they sort of made up on the front steps – which was honestly kind of nice – going back inside to eat breakfast with the both of them was still a bit awkward, strange. His sister insisted that everything was fine, that she was totally okay with her and Dean stepping back from each other and it was literally only sex between them. Castiel had covered his ears at that point, refusing to listen to anything else that included Dean, an almost ex of his, and his sister fornicating. It just wasn’t right.
Benny arched a brow, not entirely convinced in the slightest. Sure, a few good shots could make a person feel great, confident even, but in all the years he’s known him, he’s come to learn when something was weighing on his mind. “Look, Dean.”
“So school wasn’t really on your mind.” Oh God, he felt like such shit. Cas may have had mental issue to work though, but Dean, he had a lot going for him. Cas left him in a pivotal moment in their fucked up relationship and there was no doubt that part of the reason why he dropped out was because of him. Castiel was the catalyst.
So Castiel swiped his tongue across Posse Magnet’s lips playfully before pulling away just enough to gaze into the eyes behind that mask.
“Well because no offence to him or to you but he kinda did me dirty last we were really together. I don’t plan on revisiting any of that.”
Dean smiled to himself as he re-read some of the messages between him and Casanova. Whoever this guy was, he was a dork. “Dean, you’re acting like a girl, chill.” Dean looked up to see his brother, Sam, eyeing him curiously. He rolled his eyes.
“Oh! Yeah, no it’s totally fine.” The alpha chuckled. “Well, uh, say you were actively looking for someone to be with, not just because you needed to but because you wanted to; are there certain things you look for in a partner?”
Dean was on his way to grab something for lunch when his phone chimed with a new message. Except it wasn’t from Casanova this time. It was from that weird account from quite a few days back.
CasaNova36[11:25AM]: Yeah, since my parents’ passing when I was young, my uncle had custody of me, my brother and my sister.
Whoever this guy happened to be, he sounded just like Castiel. His voice was deep, gravelly, the sound of it resonated through him, sending chills down his spine. It brought Dean back to better days where him and Cas studied together and they laughed about something horrendously stupid Dean may have said. It brought him visions of a smiling Castiel, the way his eyes crinkled at the corners and how they seemed to sparkle in a weird way he couldn’t quite describe.
Castiel walked right up to the counter, a small smile playing at his lips the moment he spotted Dean. “Hello Dean. I got your voicemail.”
Anna returned then with three shots, each of bourbon. She passed them around and grinned. She raised hers up and waited for Castiel and Dean to do the same. “Okay! So, to Castiel moving across state lines – at the expense of his car breaking down – annnnd to this really weird reunion between you two. May you guys get over whatever this is and be friends again.”
Posse_Magnet67[11:23AM]: Lol sorry. And uh, no reason. I’m just curious about how it all works. So, you’ve never been with someone?
Which was exactly what Dean was doing right now; burying his feelings for Cas and the heartbreak he’s felt after everything. He told himself he’ll be okay, because he always is. Things will get back to normal and he can forget about how he discovered he was actually more bisexual than he previously thought.
Castiel groaned in frustration into his pillow, his cock throbbing for attention in his boxer briefs. He shifted, his hips pressed into the mattress and sheets below him. Fuck, what a horrible way to start the morning. And yet, he couldn’t stop himself, the dream having already taken him beyond the point of no return. He reached beneath himself to palm at the front of his boxers, his cock hard and leaking through the fabric. Yup, shit, this was happening.
CasaNova36[2:20PM]: You didn’t do anything wrong at all. I’m the one who’s kinda, you know, freaking out…lol What we did, I’ve never done that before, nor did I think I’d ever have the opportunity to. I’m sorry for my silence, but I can assure you I don’t wanna part ways.
Posse Magnet laughed, taking a step closer. “Yeah, well I could say the same to you about your mask.” He playfully flicked the edge of it, his eyes drifting down to his lips briefly. Castiel knew what he was about and he grinned. The urge to tell him he could kiss him again if he wanted to was strong. He just couldn’t find a good enough opening to offer.
Posse_Magnet67[4:13PM]: I get that, there’s no rush. Take your time. You don’t regret sending me that photo, do you? Cuz I wasn’t trying to pressure you.
There wasn’t much of a response from Dean, verbally anyway. Naw, he just shrugged and side-glanced at Castiel, that flirtatious grin playing at his lips. Castiel knew that look too. Despite the obvious intent in his gaze, Dean was still hiding, caught red-handed. So he was hitting on him, the thought had Castiel feeling all kinds of warm and fuzzy.
There was a pause in the topic of conversation, Dean opening his mouth as though to further comment something, but it never came. Instead, he reached for his quesadilla, tore a piece out and bit into it.
“I hope I’m not interrupting anything.” Castiel jumped at the sudden deep voice speaking to him. He turned to see the owner of said voice standing there, chuckling. Dean. “Didn’t mean to startle you. Hey, you’re Gabriel’s brother, right?”
Hope everyone enjoys this chapter! There is some sexual content down below, soooo....I'd say beware, but I'm sure you guys have been waiting for some steamy stuff, so I hope you enjoy it! lol
After stepping inside, Dean closed the door behind them and led the way into the living room. The house was a bit dark, the wallpaper a deep red which seemed odd and yet, fitting at the same time. There were books everywhere; some in piles on the floor, plenty others piled on shelves and bookcases. It wasn’t in any way a hoarding sort of situation, as Dean soon explained. “Sorry about the mess. Bobby just really likes his old books. It’s a shame he doesn’t have a full library.” He plopped down on the couch; head tilted backwards, legs spread.
“You certainly bicker like one.” He shrugged and finished his beer. Okay, so maybe Cas was being a good sport about all this. The thought put Dean a little at ease; either that or his judgment was already compromised by the alcohol. “She’s the one calling me a creep!”
When Ash finally did arrive, Charlie almost didn’t recognize him. He pulled her into a tight hug before she could ask who the hell he was and what he was doing at her door. “Hey! Long time no see!”
“But you know I’m right. I’m just saying Cassie, Sam might be great in your opinion but is that enough? You need some spice in your life, some excitement.”
Dean shook his head. “Not really. And I’d like to keep it that way.” He fixed Cas with a pointed look which only succeeded in making him laugh.
Dean nearly stumbles, stubbing his toe on the corner of the counter. “Ow! Jesus! I am not.” He bristled at the idea as he plopped back down in his chair and grasped for his injured foot. He hadn’t expected the idea that he might be interested in the omega, even just a little bit, to be so damn surprising.
“No, actually I’ve gone on multiple dates with a few people but nothing ever stuck or felt right. Being in a relationship and being committed to one person over an extended period of time is something I’ve never had.” And boy, did he want it. However, he couldn’t just go out and search for it anymore. It was too exhausting and he certainly couldn’t expect anything from Dean.
“You want me to tutor you?” Castiel turned to look him in the eye. Dean was only a couple inches taller than him and with him this close he could really see just how green his eyes were… He pushed the thoughts away and mustered up his courage. “I’m afraid I cannot do that.”
The bartender came back with Dean’s drinks and he wandered back over to Benny. “Here’s your whiskey sour.”
“Jerk.” Sam smirked. He grabbed is coat from the rack and shrugged it on. Once retrieving his wallet and keys from the bowl by the door, he turned to his brother again. “Are you – “
“Yeah, well, wanted to surprise ya. And ah, New Orleans has been amazing. You should come visit sometime, meet the family.”
Castiel flushes with embarrassment. “Thank you. Uhm, to be honest, I don’t really know what I want out of our, ah, partnership.”
Dean shook his head vehemently, a hand coming up to rub the back of his neck. “Yeah well, I don’t love Cas.” The blush dusting across his cheeks told Benny otherwise. He sniggered.
Dean breathed a sigh of relief. “Thank God, I knew I could always count on you Sammy…God, I feel like I was run over by a truck.”
“Wow, you really know how to make a bunch of partiers getting drunk, grinding on each other and puking in the bushes sound quite poetic.” They both laughed, sipping their drinks respectively.
Dean was very reluctant to see him leave so soon, so when he parked the Impala, he climbed out along with Cas. “You don’t have to follow me inside Dean.” Castiel chuckled as they made their way to the building.
Moments later Dean and Castiel finally sat down to eat at the table. Dean had fixed the sandwiches, both piled high with cheese, and onions of course. It looked delicious, and it certainly smelled so, despite the almost burning of the meant. “Dig in Cas!” Dean ordered with glee moments before taking a large bite.
Naomi laughed as though she hadn’t heard that one before. “That’s completely understandable; you’re not the first to be a bit apprehensive about it. Anyone whom you or anyone else may match with are generally volunteers. Most anyway. There are some who assist more or less full time and get paid for it. And, believe it or not, omegas aren’t the only ones who come here for help. There is the rare occasion where an alpha will come to us in need of a rut partner.”
Castiel averted his gaze from his brother, willing the heat in his cheeks to go away because God damnit, he hated to admit it, but Gabriel was right. He was definitely attracted to Dean despite his focus on Sam and his current situation. There was just something about the other alpha that felt magnetic, like there had been something between them last night that beckoned Castiel to Dean’s side, to join him in a game of pool, up the stakes a little, winner takes all that the loser is willing to offer. The imaginings conjured in his mind really didn’t help Castiel’s predicament as he had to completely turn away from his brother and fiddle with the dishwasher, starting it when it was only halfway full. “I barely know the guy, Gabe.”
Castiel glanced at him sheepishly, eyes wide as though he were a deer caught in a set of headlights. “Uhm, it’s going okay. You?” He quickly shot his sister a glare that was definitely not lost on Dean.
Dean’s mind was pretty blank, spotty. Most of it was nothing but an inky, black darkness that he floated around in the middle of. Alone, scared at some points but then there were moments where he felt okay, almost at peace, as though he knew this was it and he was okay with that.
Jesus, was he really here to lecture him on the importance to remain chaste in the midst of debauchery and hedonism that runs rampant in today’s school? Seriously? Castiel glared daggers. “Really? You really came in here to give me a fucking lecture? I was just in a car accident!”
CasaNova36[9:56AM]: Remind me again why we have to wait until Halloween before we meet? Lol That sounds like a great idea. I’ll leave after class is through, just another 30 minutes.
Castiel watched Dean plate another pancake before setting the spatula down, the image alone bringing him back to the morning where he made Dean breakfast after a night of binge drinking. He remembered rummaging through the cupboards and the fridge for ingredients, remembered when Dean finally woke up and searched him out. They had flirted constantly with each other all morning and Dean had even promised he would cook for him one day…
“So Dean, how’s Sam doing?” Castiel was a bit hesitant to ask though he was genuinely curious. He liked Sam, they had gotten along until, of course, when they didn’t.
God, the blood, when he finally awoke, it was everywhere. It pooled around his mother’s body and covered the kitchen tile, seeping into the crevices. Her head had been turned towards him, a look of fright in her eyes before the life simply faded away.
“Well you apparently didn’t know who you wanted!” Castiel suddenly shouted, his voice shaking with the pain he felt. “You used my online persona to test out your sexuality, while you flirted with me in real life…We got close Dean, really close and I thought that maybe we had something, but no. You used me Dean!”
“And where are you going? What, got a hot date or something?” He teased, an eyebrow arched suspiciously.
Castiel’s heart skipped a beat at the question. He forgot how much he had mourned the friendship they had, and now he was presented with another chance at it. He had to take it. If things went to shit again at least he could say they gave it a shot. A smile tugged at his lips. “Yes. I think we are.”
Castiel’s body was on fire with this lust, this absolute need to let go. To feel, to touch, to embrace this primal, animalistic need within him. “Are you…I’m-“ Fuck, he could barely talk over his own whimpers and gasps.
Dean sipped his beer, slouching in his spot on the couch to get comfortable. “Well that makes sense, I suppose I’m a little nervous too. And considering you just reminded me of the conversations we had, I probably won’t be able to stop thinking about them during the party.”
He needed to shower and change into something clean that didn’t smell like booze and death. And as much as he didn’t really want to, he would drive Castiel back to his dorm room afterward. Which is exactly what he did.
However, if you stripped everything away, Castiel was left with memories of the simple crush he had on Dean all those years ago, well before he truly got to know the man. Such simpler times…Despite all he knew, all of the limitations put upon him by himself and by others, Castiel still allowed himself this one passing fancy.
It was all his fault, it always was. Whenever something terrible happened it was usually Dean’s fault. If he had been older and stronger, he would have been able to save his mother from the intruder. His father wouldn’t have fallen deep into his cups, wouldn’t have put everything on him as the oldest and struck him whenever he failed. No matter how hard he tried to do the right thing, he always managed to fuck it up in the end. It was his curse.
“Ah.” Was all Dean said, which was more than enough in Castiel’s book. The guy probably thought the same thing as everyone else did whenever they saw his scrubbed mark. Damaged goods. Not worth the effort. His mate probably left him for a good reason.
“Wait,” Dean interrupted again. “Don’t tell me you’re going to give me the ‘it’s not you, it’s me’ speech, are you?”
Dean sighed over exaggeratingly. “Ugh, okay mom!” He stuck his tongue out at her. He returned to his phone once she left to find a message from Cas waiting for him.
“Alright, well, I won’t give you the spiel about what’s good and what’s not so good then.” Sam smiled from across the table, an infectious smile really. It was so kind and easy, it was really no wonder he hasn’t ever received a complaint with the heat clinic. Hell, it was a wonder why he didn’t have a mate of his own. Sam Winchester cut quite a handsome figure dressed in a dark coat and red plaid. His hair was brushed back and styled to stay in place for the evening, the ends curled at the nape of his neck. Castiel couldn’t have picked a better alpha.
