The man smirked again, amusement in his eyes. “No, but I’m fairly sure his status as a wanted criminal will absolve you from any legal responsibility.”
“The medical world despairs your loss, Doctor,” Sherlock replied, emphasising the title. He had a self satisfied little smirk pulling at his lips, and resumed his examination.
throbbing as he finally let himself rest, “Dunno. I had something this morning.” It felt a little intimate to share something like that, and John was annoyed that he had at all, so he added jokingly, “You gonna bring me some dinner, then? Keep me from falling over you? I really just might.”
He dropped into bed sometime near two or three AM, and dozed into loose sleep sometime near four.
He remained in the small, sterile space until the nice older nurse came back around and told him he was set to go. She also reminded him to keep out of trouble and to get the nose checked out again sometime soon, and John nodded dutifully until she retreated.
, he thought. “Will I… see you around?”
“Will I?”
It sounded like a suggestion, or an invitation, and John studied him for a second. “I’m not a charity case.”
Stepping out into the night, John breathed a deep sigh, his exhaustion leisurely morphing into something that could resemble sleepiness, if he had a lie down for a few hours. The iridescent hospital light spilled over the pavement through the glass doors, and a few yards down along the curb a police car idled, its engine humming and headlights on. They, ever so careful, obviously stalling, dragged their feet toward the car.
“I’d be amenable,” Sherlock said, but didn’t elaborate, and John looked up from Sherlock’s mouth to his dawn eyes, and saw that his pupils were gradually pulling away at the color. John’s lips opened limply, parting just a bit in realization.
John replied, only a little regretful now, “I didn’t get the job, if that’s what you’re asking.”
Sherlock gazed right back, equally silent, equally strangely considering, until a young man in scrubs accidentally jostled John on his way by with a mumbled ‘sorry, sorry’. Sherlock’s eyes snapped into detached focus and he spun on his heel, feet light like a dancer’s, and said as John stumbled to catch up, “I’ll walk you out.” Sherlock’s presence beside him was heavy as they passed through the brightly lit hospital halls.
“Something of the sort.”
Grimacing, Sherlock answered, “Social niceties. They should have just told you ‘no’ outright, though I see that you’re under no delusions of follow up.”
The man amended disdainfully, “Which is always.” The police sirens were louder, approaching rapidly.
he sighed,
“A… hypothesis,” John parroted.
John grimaced and glanced at the man apologetically, slowly lowering himself to the ground. He leaned back against the car, and the man immediately sat down beside him, sliding into a criss cross position with the unhuman fluidity of honey. Or a very agile cat. John felt a bit bumbling in comparison, but he figured everybody probably felt a little bit like that around him.
“I wonder what that says about you, doctor,” Sherlock answered idly, but there was a pleased spark in his eye. John watched the golden sunlight chase the glimmer and smiled just a bit. The footsteps and conversations of people passing overtook the tentative silence between them.
John grinned at him. “I’d be amenable.”
“Do you think I’m suicidal?”
“Has it-” John blinked and cocked his head. “I don’t know. I can’t tell. If it has gone, it won’t be for long.” Tonight his limp had the same annoying changeability as a day filled with nomadic clouds: the sun shone, and then five minutes later the blue was replaced with the same thunderstorm gray as an Autumn in London.
John was not especially moved. He avoided looking at her, a little ball of indignation forming in his chest. “Would I?”
“Yes…?” replied Sherlock, and his trail was wandering and endless, his question mark in sore need of a diet. They stared at each other for a few moments, and then both opened their mouths.
“Ah, first impressions,” sighed Sherlock, “people really are so particular about those.”
A twitch of a smirk hovered at the edge of the man’s lips. He strode past John and bent over, picking up the gun shaped lighter.
Strangely enough, the first car to arrive on scene, not 5 minutes later, was not a police car, but another cab. John glanced up once from where he’s bent over, ruining his undershirt with the blood from his nose as he tries to keep it from clogging up his throat. He’s successful, mostly, though his mouth still tasted like when he was a small kid, licking at the ice on light posts; undeniably, unmistakably metallic. His jumper and flannel were in a heap beside him, removed to save them the fate his threadbare undershirt suffered.
But he stood a little straighter all the same. Tightened his grip on his way-too-big jeans and felt like a child, his Da’s angry voice in his ear.
John nodded, his tentative grin pulling back into a slight grimace.
The cabbie stared at John silently.
A dawning understanding flooded his eyes, and a sliver of resigned hindsight twitched in the corner of his tight mouth. “Police?”
“This isn’t charity,” Sherlock answered, and even though distrust swam through his veins and pounded against the walls of his skull, John believed him. Sherlock continued after a beat, “It may also do well to tell you that being around me requires a large deal of patience.”
John chuckled, and the man looked at him in surprise. His lips shuddered between frown and smile for a moment, unsure how to react, before slipping easily into a pleased grin. “Well,” John said wryly, “none of you were very much help this time.”
John greeted, “You were right.”
“I think you’re indifferent,” Sherlock amended. “And if I’m right about that - and, as I’ve said, I always am - then you fought against a man twice your size because you found issues with deaths of strangers that you’ve never met, not because of a desire to survive.”
After a moment he huffed, standing from the crouch, and the expensive looking coat draped down over his lean frame. He was long, like stretched taffy, with a distinct lack of gangly uncertainness. “You’ve given him a concussion,” he stated matter-of-factly. He tugged his phone from one of the deep pockets of his coat and rapidly typed something out, dropping it back into his coat promptly.
John’s cheeks flushed dully at being called out. Not wanting to be thought a fool, he answered, half-kidding, “Maybe I was insulted. Does being insulted count as justification for inflicting bodily harm?”
“Ah, just- that I guess I should get going.”
The man sniffed and his figure straightened, his shoulders squaring and spine snapping to full height. At attention, dripping with absolute pride and self-confidence. “Yes,” he replied, and John usually doesn’t feel this short. “Frankly, I’m
Sherlock stared at him, his sky-eyes traveling all over John’s face, a soft frown tugging at his lips. “I always am.” John grinned a little. Sherlock said, “About what?”
“Said that they’d ‘be in touch’.”
“Right, then,” said John, and Sherlock stared down at him, his hands hovering with uncertainty at his sides. He thought that there were words, somewhere; a ‘do you want to get dinner’, or ‘could I see you again’, or the ever practical ‘I think you’re quite fit,’ but none of them seemed to match into whatever social rules John’s ingrained in his psyche for this situation. Whatever those may be. “Erm.” John glanced at the passenger door. He opened and closed his mouth. “Bye.”
John grabbed the door handle and pulled it open. He paused, fingertips tapping deftly against the metal. He flicked his gaze to Sherlock.
“Really.”
underweight.” John looked at the man’s own body. He could tell, even through all the layers, that the leanness was just this side of healthy. He cringed at what a sorry sight he must make to someone in such good shape, then felt stupid for pitying himself. He’s fine. It’s fine. “Have you developed an eating disorder, or is it the depression? PTSD?”
He hadn’t felt this much laughter bubbling in his chest since before his shoulder, before his leg, before the burning desert sand turned to golden snow beneath his limp body, freezing as dusk dripped to midnight.
So John had. Some good that’d done.
Donovan asked, “Do you know him?”
“Others?” John studied the unmemorable face, the grey hair, the rounded outline of a body turned from muscle to flab. ‘I’ll make you kill yourself,’ he had said. It snapped in place. “Oh, shit. ‘Serial suicides’.”
“He’s a freak,” she told him, the ‘k’ clicking somewhat unpleasantly in the back of her throat. “Gets off on crime, murder - he was beside himself when he found out that the murderer had supposedly been found because he was hell bent on finiding him himself. How he figured that out before the police is really just another point away from him. He’s got no respect for justice.”
“And humble, to boot,” John mumbled without heat.
For a few moments, Sherlock regained that microscope-like focus. “What were you going to say?”
John said quickly, cutting off his own annoyance at his mind’s change in direction, “Are you the best man?”
“-and not a little bit of time spent with me.” He stopped abruptly, and John shut his mouth, too. That felt like a warning, or a preparation, or- something. They stared at one another intensely, stretching the moment like long, long taffy.
The figure started at a brisk jog, slipping from the streetlight and into the night towards John. John sniffed, feeling slightly thankful that his nose was no longer gushing a disconcerting amount of blood down his front.
“Sherlock?” John blinked at him.
“What I’m saying,” said Sherlock, tapping his foot into the air in a slightly anxious way, “is that you most definitely made an impression.”
John felt like there might be something in that sentence that should offend him, but it was all true, and he couldn’t be arsed to complain about honesty. “Mm,” he hummed, “I’m the picture of practicality.” He paused and stared vaguely at the people chewing their lunch at Speedy’s cafe. He’d had an apple in the morning, and was resolute to eat something soon to avoid the whole passing out fiasco of yesterday. That was most definitely not practical. “I don’t think I made a very good impression.”
John stood up from the body, twisting sluggishly but confined enough for the moment. He flipped the cabbie over and rummaged through his pockets, tossing the keys away near the fake gun, followed by a wallet and a cell phone. There were two pill bottles deep in the cabbie’s jacket pocket, and John stared at them quizzically for a moment, then set them down near the rest of the man’s belongings, careful not to break them. That was definitely evidence.
Sherlock grinned at the sky, then turned his attention back towards John through the corners of his eyes. “You’re delightful,” he said, and John blinked, not sure what that meant. It felt like being gawked at, but Sherlock’s eyes were so damn pretty he thought that he wouldn’t mind being gawked at by him. It wasn’t pity. It wasn’t a spectacle. It was appreciation. John’s ears warmed at the tips.
Lestrade - D.I. Gregory Lestrade, he said his name was - tapped his pen against the notepad. “Don’t worry, mate. Sherlock’s got it for you.”
He left the cabbie on his back, his hands wedged between his body and the ground, and pulled out his own cell, his thumb brushing absently over the engraving of Clara and Harry’s names on the back. He dialed the emergency number, told them the situation the best he could -
“Yeah,” John breathed, “it’s amazing. Really.” The right card. The man’s face morphed into a pleasant smile, genuine and fuzzy. Beautiful. There was another pause, and though the man was still studying John’s face, it felt less like being put under a microscope - more like simple appreciation, admiring a particularly skillful or emotional piece of art. Then John felt silly for thinking like that at all, because obviously that was not admiration. Could not be. Obviously.
The cabbie threw himself at John, wringing his large hands around his neck and slamming him back into the car. John winced, choking and gasping, scratching at the knuckles with dull nails as his cane slid from his hand. He kicked his legs out, trying to feel for some solid ground, and jabbed the heel of his foot into the cabbie’s knee.
Sherlock answered, his face sliced through with something that might be a smile, “Unlikely.”
, John thought. His eyes were a pale blue, almost grey, like the halo around the moon, ethereal and otherworldly. A silver lining. Dawn in the distance; morning over the horizon after a sleepless night. A snatch of sky, indeed.
“Limp?”
Sherlock’s eyes flickered toward him, and it was only when their gazes made contact that he turned his head. “The news cycle has most likely caught wind of the arrest by now, including who, exactly, ensured it.” He waved a hand vaguely in John’s direction, and a tantalizing smirk slashed through his sharply handsome features. “You may get your five seconds of fame soon, John Watson.”
The blunt handle landed forcefully on the cabbie’s sternum, and John followed swiftly to put his body between the wheezing cabbie and the car. The thrill of a fight ached in his veins, adrenaline pumping with the steady drum of his heart and shaking with anticipation in his bones. He minutely unclenched his grip on the cane, adjusting it, and tightened it again. His leg twinged a little, and it hurt, but he ignored it. He’d felt worse.
“Problem?” He looked so innocent, again. Golden light and long limbs and a carefully fond expression.
The man continued, a new layer of uneasiness in his expression, “You are also possibly unemployed and…
Sherlock hummed in acknowledgment, or sympathy, and sighed a world-weary sigh. “More's the pity,” he said wisely, “though they’ll rethink it soon.”
The cabbie’s finger shuddered on the trigger, wavering. John stared down the barrel, the primal, instinctive part of his brain screaming out in alarm at the familiar view of black; a short tunnel with a deadly bullet, shooting off in a violent, half-second frenzy and leaving behind nothing but blood splatter and gunsmoke.
John wondered idly if cursing could ever count as prayer. He wished for a distinct lack of killer accomplices, decided this newcomer probably wasn’t one, but stood up anyway. He glanced at his cane and his leg groaned, the forgotten pain - it was gone, he realized, for however shortly - flaring up with a vengeance. He cursed himself a little more and grabbed the cane.
John pinched his lips thinly, barely managing to suppress his laughter. ‘Hah’, he says. John wondered how many times he’s been caught off guard so thoroughly. “On the telly, that inspector said he’s got his ‘best man’ on the case. Are you him?”
John grinned wryly.
The incredulous laughter hummed joyfully in John’s chest. “That’s brilliant,” he said reverently, his mouth pulled into a tilted, disbelieving grin. “You got that just from looking at me?” He stared up at the man’s unconventional face, scanning over the sharp shadows cut by the streetlight, admiring the soft blush that the man was steadfastly ignoring.
Instead, he was enveloped in a tall, warm body, and opened his eyes to find Sherlock’s arm flung out to keep him upright, his head smashed against Sherlock’s chest, right over the charcoal button up. A waft of fading soap seeped from the fabric, something softly floral, like lavender. He glanced up at the detective and flashed him an almost playful smile, even as his cheeks flooded with shame, because he was nothing if not self deprecating. Sherlock grasped his shoulders, his ears a bit too red, and guided John upright onto steady feet.
“On your way home from a pub.” The man leaned in and sniffed, his nose twitching cutely, and John blinked at him, bewildered. “You didn’t drink or eat, though. Go to meet someone, then? Reluctantly. An old friend, I’m guessing.”
Sherlock’s eyes travelled over his form, standing tall and comfortable in its stillness. He adjusted his grip on the cane. “If you walk, will you fall over?”
The cabbie hummed, lowering the not-gun. “None of the others knew their guns.”
His grip tightened almost violently on the lighter, and he swung it towards John’s temple just as he lunged for the front seat. John dodged the attempt, the barrel scraping across his forehead unpleasantly, and he thrust himself from his seat, jabbing the cane out towards the cabbie and knocking him away from the car door.
John considered that for a moment. He decided, “No. It doesn’t.”
John raised both eyebrows and grinned in spite of himself. “How’d you figure that out, genius?”
“Yes, I thought so,” Sherlock murmured, shooting John a teasing expression. His long fingers grasped at the aging bench behind John, arms and legs stretched out like a starfish. The curls continued to flop over his forehead, his head inclined to the side, as loose as a ragdoll. The entire picture he made was so strangely innocent, in complete contrast to the imposing, brilliant man he really was, and John couldn’t help but feel shadowed by comparison. It wasn’t such a difficult feeling to handle, though. You don’t bemoan your lack of power against the sun.
There were a series of closing doors and assertive voices, and John tensed. Sherlock’s smile drained, and he pointed at John’s head. “You didn’t say it aloud,” he said softly, and slowly reached over, pulling John’s hand away from where it was rubbing soothingly at his temple. “You only have exceptionally expressive body language.”
Sherlock replied, “The best.”
He wondered briefly if he had hit his head hard enough to cause a concussion, but he knew what a concussion felt like, having received his fair share of injuries throughout his life. Punishment from his Da, roughhousing with Harry, rugby, ill-advised bar fights, the army… his life was always just a little violent. Even in friendly competition. Maybe especially then.
“Sherlock-”
The man blinked, caught in the headlights, and John watched with no short supply of wonder as a rosy pink replaced the pale white of his skin, high on his cheekbones. He stumbled, “Uh, w-” cleared his throat, obviously irritated at himself, “You have PTSD, recently invalidated. Of course you have a therapist.” He glanced down at John’s leg, seemed to inwardly battle with something, then added before John got a chance to reply, “Your limp is also psychosomatic. Partly, at least.”
A pause. “Hm…” he glanced down at the cabbie, his face twisted in consideration. “More than sufficient in hand-to-hand combat, but not in any specific martial arts or technique. Rather street-like. Resourceful - you used your own belt as a binding, and you hit him with your cane, didn’t you?” he didn’t wait for John to answer, crouching down again to raise the silent cabbie and examine the thorough wrapping around his wrists. “Dexterous, as well. He couldn’t have been out for more than 30 seconds. I’d be shocked if it even made it to that.”
He sighed deeply and gazed into his blue eyes beneath the impersonal light. They were so- him. Just him, John Watson; a dull blue, steady and dimming. Steadily dimming. He thought of Sherlock’s eyes, like a silver-lined horizon, and promptly left the bathroom, cutting off that train of thought. He pulled some frozen vegetables from the freezer and held them to the worst of the bruising, avoiding his nose, and hoped that it would help with the swelling. He knew it wouldn’t, really; not enough. But he needed something to do with his hands, and the frost felt nice on his over-hot cheeks.
“Terrible timing,” whispered John. “I had a job interview tomorrow, you know. As a GP. Guess that’s out the window.” He didn’t know why he was saying all this. Sherlock’s fingers felt like hot iron on his skin.
John thought that he was maybe being too inwardly defensive of a person he’d hardly known for a night. He also found that he really couldn’t be bothered to care, because he - he liked Sherlock, what little he’d seen of him. It’s disconcerting that he could make a decision so quick as that, but he chose not to think about it. He’d learned to be good at that. Keep calm, carry on.
John gazed at him for a moment. “You’re making a few jumps.”
“So, it’ll be an… experiment?”
Panting, John dropped the cane to the ground. He sniffed violently, trying to breath around the globs of blood in his nose, and quickly undid his belt from where it was fastened around his waist on its tightest loop. His pants sagged, falling partway down his legs, and he silently bemoaned the way it chafed against his skin-and-bone hips, but didn’t pay it much mind beyond a fleeting consideration. The few times he had managed to look at himself in the mirror had been time enough to hate what his body had become.
He ambled his way around London, jostled by the crowds of early afternoon. He continued on, even as his leg twinged and squawked and complained, because he felt that he’d taken too far of a tube to turn back so quickly, and grabbing a cab was not only financially unrealistic, but the idea sent a run of shivers up the prominent notches in his spine in a way that was worryingly familiar. He tried not to think about it.
“I don’t mind,” Sherlock said, and John gave him an assessing look as Sherlock’s face twisted like his mouth was stuffed full of lemon. Amusement fizzed up John’s throat like soda bubbles, and it popped his mouth open into another grin.
Upon arriving home, John changed and took a long, hard look at the damage to his face in the mirror above his impeccably clean bathroom sink. He thought for a second about cancelling or even just skipping out on that job interview, but he needed money and he needed something to do more. Cancelling on short notice (he couldn’t call now - he’d need to cancel the
Nodding once, sharply, Sherlock took a step back. “Go on, then.”
John closed his eyes, shaking his head all the while, and laughed out his disbelief. When he opened them, Sherlock was still watching him, a spark of laughter shining in the little scrunch around his eyes, though his face was otherwise impassive. John sighed.
Sherlock’s lips pursed, and he parted them, glancing toward John. “I wanted to… that is-” he stopped and frowned.
The next day, his job interview went predictably bad. The woman working the counter thought he was there for a checkup, and he had to clarify that, no, he’s a doctor, and, yes, I do have a job interview. He then had to stumble his way through an explanation about how he was attacked just yesterday, without giving away who the attacker was, because he had no idea what he was supposed to know or allowed to share. He was overqualified and looked older than he was and he was maybe a bit too distanced, a bit too unfriendly; he was out of practice and a very sorry sight to the pretty doctor interviewing him, and as she told him that they’ll ‘be in touch’, he knew that he’d not gotten the job. He almost wanted to tell her not to bother - keep her calls for people who have a chance, ta - but that would be spiteful (which he definitely is, though he’s the only person in the world to know, and he’d like to keep it that way) and most importantly rude (which he most certainly is
John stared out of the window as she started up the car, pulling slowly across the pavement. Sherlock’s pale face cut a slash in the night, and his dark clothing had a similar impact upon the glaring hospital entrance. Sherlock raised a hand, but didn’t wave, caught between friendly and distant. John quirked a smile and raised his own hand, watching his figure fade into the background until he couldn’t make out the conflicted expression on his face before turning forward.
“Get into fights often?” She asked, pleasant and absently conversational.
The officer beside him, a black woman dressed out of uniform - Donovan - gave him a strange look. She asked to clarify his address, and John told her with an ever-polite “thanks” tacked onto the end.
John stopped and cleared his throat, feeling once again like a child, his heart fluttering nervously in his chest. Get it together, Watson. Get it together. “You first,” he offered.
He took a step with his left foot toward Sherlock. He lifted his right leg, and could feel as the momentum went down that it would not hold, even though it had just a moment ago - he cursed like a sailor as pinpricks of invisible needles shot through his veins, folding the limb beneath him like paper. He shut his eyes away from the rapidly approaching tile of the hospital floor, but blessedly did not disturb the very broken nose he had just had splinted, his fall ended in a much kinder manner.
Whatever John had anticipated for Sherlock to say next, that was not it. His eyes widened, and he moved his hand onto his thigh, grabbing loosely through the too-big jeans. “You what?”
They transported him to the hospital, along with the concussed cabbie. They told him his nose was broken, which he knew, and the older woman on duty stuffed his nose with gauze and splinted it.
John pursed his lips, and suddenly a spark of surprise pushed through the cloud of his headache. He repeated, bewildered, “Army man?”
John replied, nasal, “All the time. I’m a thug. Can’t you tell?” She glanced him over, and they shared a small, joking grin. He was fed subpar hospital food that went down his throat with the consistency of toothpaste, and drank three cups of chilly water that helped to wash it down.
John looked down at his half-complete drawing; He really wanted to finish it but it would seem his art would have to wait.
"Such lovely thighs. I love to straddle them as I look at your edible and enticing cock. Or as you wrap them around my hips and as you hover over and descend your cock inside me; while I hold and command you to come," John said as he drew the rest of Sherlock's legs and feet. Sherlock agonized to stay stationary as he glanced to see John rub his free hand between his own thighs.
"How do you want me?" Sherlock asked.
Sherlock grinned with a groan escaping his lips, teasing John some more. "I enjoy playing with your lust," Sherlock added.
"It has been too long." Holmes wrapped his arms around Watson and lay his head upon his shoulder. Watson stroked the back of Holmes's neck and lay his lips on the divide between his shoulder and his neck.
"Did you know how overwhelming it was to watch the love of your life marry someone else? I would have given anything to switch places with her that day," Sherlock said reluctantly. "That's why I retreated from the wedding early. It was a battle I had no longer a chance of winning." Sherlock had tears in his eyes and so did John; they were both hurting so equally. With a rocky voice Sherlock pressed on, "that night I went back to flat and if it wasn't for Mycroft I would have overdosed. Loving you was the most self-destructive thing I've ever done." Sherlock turned away and shuffled around the floor. "I didn't want to ruin the happiness you had obviously found with Mary." Sherlock hid his face. "Same stands for my exile after killing Magnussen for you, I-I couldn't bare the burden of being wi-without you..."
"Keep your toes still. I know how you love to curl them."
Holmes barely released the words without a stutter. He lifted his finger straight for Watson to forever claim him as if he hadn't already. Watson tried to place the ring on Holmes's finger but alas it wouldn't fit. Watson scoffed and pulled away in pain, wiping his watered eyes on his sleeve. "Of course it doesn't fit," Watson said with anger and utter disbelief in his voice. He kicked the dirt on the ground trying to keep his temper under his thumb.
If Holmes couldn't have him, he was going to make sure that Watson's wedding would be seemingly simple if this was the aspect that was going to make him truly happy. That's all Holmes cared about in the long term of everything, it was Watson's happiness. But it sharply hurt Holmes's heart that he wasn't the cause of his happiness hence forth. What was the point of having a heart if his Watson didn't even want it anymore.
He had drawn him a lot during the years of coping with Sherlock's death, but every time he would finish one he would end up throwing it away or burning it. The memory of his face was too painful to remember but not so easily forgotten.
They both loved each other so much it was ridiculous.
John's stomach tightened with his knees shaking and his head heavy. "I loved you Sherlock and still do," John said sensitively his eyes darting into Sherlock, scared by what he was going to say next.
"What shade are they tonight, love?" John asked picking up a thin paintbrush and dipping it in the glass of water.
"Whenever you want and however you want." John said breathlessly.
"Then I'm going to draw your hands." John was beginning to struggle with the temptation.
"Tomorrow," John agreed.
"I'll have Mycroft send some papers over in the morning so she'll get taken care of." Sherlock's face dropped while he locked eyes with John, "what about the baby?"
Watson smelled how fantastic his scent was; something so familiar and yet so lost in memory. Watson clutched tightly onto Holmes's hand but then released it entirely. "I'm concerned for you and your health. I've neglected to see you in twenty days-"
Holmes hardly believed that he gave in. He closed his eyes and tasted the reviving sensation of Watson on his lips. After such hiatus he had never felt anything so quenching to his thirst.
"There's no reason we can't raise her ourselves."
"Do you take John Watson as your wedded husband?" The minster asked in which Mary agreed.
"If we shall, you will never solve another case again."
A sudden bewitching look flashed in Sherlock's face as his hands moved down his body.
"I am no Holmes without my Watson," Holmes said. Watson turned to him, "You know we mustn't, I married her to keep you safe."
Holmes was silent as he turned away leaning his hand on the wall to catch his tired broken body while pinching the brim of his nose in stress and frustration.
"No time," Sherlock said as he grabbed one of John's hands and placed it on his cock while he grinded his hips against John's growing erection. John kissed Sherlock's shoulders as Sherlock bit his earlobe. John pumped Sherlock's cock in a steady pace.
"Show me. Right now." Sherlock shifted in his stance with that sickly look returning to his expression and his skin turning paler than usual.
"I'm going to c-," Sherlock couldn't finish the sentence.
"It's okay...there's nothing wrong with feeling emotion as terrible as it might sound." They both inhaled. "I've never loved her the way I love you," John said tenderly into Sherlock's ear while raking his fingers finely through his curls.
John nearly dropped the cup in his hand as the heat and blood in his body rushed to his waist. "Yeah I can do that," John said looking Sherlock up and down.
Would Sherlock win the game?
John wondered what that man was doing right now. He again missed him terribly, he wanted to go home right now and take Sherlock as he was. Just to show and reassure him how much John truly loved him. John's shift ended at nine o'clock which meant he'd get home at about nine fifteen. The time didn't slip away fast enough.
"And vow to never let them go again." An image of from Sherlock's fall bolted through his mind. An image of John grabbing one of Sherlock's hands and feeling no pulse. But that was the past and it didn't matter anymore.
John stared at his love a bit longer until he began to get up.
"I won't if you won't. I'll save myself for you," Sherlock bargained.
They were unsure of what the next step was going to be. They were also scared that they wouldn't be able to express sentiment this easy and let alone be together, but for now they were to live in the moment and they were going to ventilate their rekindled love in any way they could.
By the time John was done, his station was a mess. Paint and charcoal all over the floor and all over his hands. John gave his drawing one final look and blew softly at the excess material left over on the canvas.
Not too much longer. He was ready for him as well. Sherlock wanted his hands holding a pencil but John wanted his hands to hold Sherlock's body instead.
"The same hands I have held throughout our time together."
"How about a shower?"
Intimately Sherlock retorted, "for your eyes only," and kissed him tenderly on the lips.
Holmes stood to Watson's side in the ceremony as he watched Watson grip hands with another, making him weak and angry that there was nothing he could do. Watson fabricated a joyous smile the best he could but pain instilled itself in his eyes.
"I care for you so much." John stopped himself, the words exploited and uninvited out of his mouth. But then again everything was on the table there was no holding him back now. The heat surged and boomeranged between the both them. "Seeing you die was harder than the Afgan war. You killed me that day too; for me..." John took off his jacket to cool himself down. "My heartbreak was my own version of death, and I forced to keep living."
"John," Ella said sitting up more intently in her chair. "What's bothering you?"
"John?"
"I need a moment alone with John Watson." Watson looked at Lestrade and nodded at him with a look of such an overwrought, it was then that Lestrade knew their secret but he wouldn't dare tell a single soul.
John's face dropped. He thought carefully about his next question, "Why didn't you tell me you were alive?"
"Huh?" John said getting so lost in Sherlock's eyes but frankly not wanted to find a way out and also growing a smile on his face. "I...am so desperately in love with you and I've always been. I just wanted you to know that, and now that I finally have you, I'll never leave you again."
"I can think of a few good options," Sherlock said with a lift of his eyebrow and gloss to his tone. John raised his eyebrows grabbing onto the back of Sherlock's neck with a more zealous grip and fire in his eyes, "let's start with this one," John said gently meeting his parted lips with Sherlock's for a slow but vehement long awaited kiss.
Watson would lay asleep in Holmes's bed until the dawn would break its way through the curtains forcing him to retire to his own quarters before Mrs. Hudson could see them together.
"Let's get to it then," John said with a lick of his lips.
"You tell me." Sherlock said as he stabbed him more vividly with his stare.
When John turned around, Sherlock had his back facing towards him.
Holmes knew he was instituting a lot of Watson to forgive him of all his wrongs and to love him the way he did once but he never dreamed of Watson having a life after Holmes had passed. He still loved him as much as he did the day he left but he feared his Watson never would again.
A significant amount of time had passed until John looked up at the clock with the night closing in around him.
In John's chair lay a fairly large and brand new sketchbook. "I've been ready for hours," Sherlock remarked.
"Under me," John responded as he lifted his weak body up from his chair grabbing Sherlock by the hips and pushing his bare physique in his chair. Sherlock melted as John fit himself between his legs and as he nipped at his collar bone. Sherlock gripped the back of John's neck moaning in his ear, feeling the blood rush to his crotch.
"What a beautiful chest that is."
For now they were happy and without a care in the world or neither a Moriarty or a Mary to tear them apart. For now it was just Sherlock and John but this time they were together like the universe had intended them to be.
Holmes's lip began to quiver and his eyes swelled pink with hopeless tears. "Of course I will."
"On the table are your choices of mediums," Sherlock said with a gesture of his bow. "Wasn't sure which one you preferred." John cleared his throat as he made his way over to the table. Scanning his array of choices he settled upon a black charcoal pencil and acrylic paint; along with a brush and a glass of water.
"When your body completely indulges and your hips can't control their movements. As you fuck my mouth while my lips and tongue pull up and swirl the head of your cock."
Although they could not publicly display their heated affection in such an open setting, their love for one another still flowered into devoted commitment no matter how much the world would try to prevent them.
"I wish it were you. I wish life wasn't such a trial against people like us," Watson said scratching his fingers up Holmes's arm. Watson looked at Holmes and did something he had wanted to do since the day they first met eyes. He took the ring off his finger and took Holmes by the palm. With a shaky despairing grip he held the ring between his fingers and asked him the question that could never be.
"Oh?"
"You're fantastic," John cupped his face, "I love you," he added just before pulling him under once more.
"Perhaps."
"Only when you pleasure me with your hands, cock, and mouth. Such talented hands you have."
Their tongues played with each other until John broke the kiss touching his forehead to Sherlock's.
Sherlock held onto him longer with a breathtaking grip. "What are we gonna do?" Sherlock asked hopelessly in a faint mumble. John exhaled resentfully, "I guess I'll give Mary a call and tell her we're finished. She'll know why I imagine, she's known it's been coming for a while now and I'll let her know that Ella knows everything."
Sherlock wiped the tears that lay on his warm cheeks off on his sleeve. "...so I supposed if I couldn't have you then this life wasn't worth the effort." John couldn't believe his words. He cried with tears of remorse, they were both immensely at fault. John burned from the inside. Without a hesitation in his step John clung to Sherlock like static on clothing squeezing him securely. John always hated seeing his strong-willed Sherlock cry because he always went through such great lengths to show no emotion at all, so when he did, it was almost alarming but it was also very mundane and reviving to know he was human, which John had never doubted. Sherlock couldn't resist him. He wrapped his arms around his thinned waist pressing his mouth into the crook of John's neck. Their heat was smoldering in between them being ingrained into one another with their rupturing limbs displaying no intention of ceasing the shaking.
Watson waited eagerly in the back room of the church pacing the floor with his hands in pockets of his jacket glaring down the door, for his Holmes was not present yet. Maybe it was a mistake asking him to be his best man at a wedding that would only bring him sorrow. How could he blame him? Watson didn't even want to be there himself.
Ella looked down at her paper and clicked open her pen. "What about Sherlock?" Her eyes watched John's reaction closely. He didn't answer her. He was always a sensitive topic and Ella knew it. He had been spending a lot of time with him the past few months and he was overwhelmingly happy but he had never felt more distant from him.
John didn't like the idea of being away from Sherlock and being alone for so long. He got bored so quickly these days when there was even the slightest lull in the process of solving a case. He was beginning to feel a bit more like Sherlock with every case they'd come up against.
"Not as remarkable as yours," Sherlock implied.
"Choose her?" John finished. "I was low, I thought you were dead I had to move on somehow," John said sweetly lifting his head from Sherlock's shoulder. "What was I supposed to do?"
He thought his ex lover dead until the moment he returned alive and well after two years of grieving. Watson wanted to love Holmes again like he once had but things were different, he wasn't sure if he knew how to love him just the same as before.
"Now for your waist and arse. I could go on and on about them." John made sure to make Sherlock's arse tight and plump.
The men shuffled around in the dirt until Holmes wrapped his arms around Watson from behind, resting his chin upon Watson's shoulder. Watson cupped Holmes's hands under his own, affectionately rubbing his thumbs over the back of his hands. "Run away we should," Holmes said with low purr in Watson's ear.
Sherlock was stiff. He had imagined it being said so many times and in so many different ways, he never dreamed it would be said like that; so heartsick. The words seemed to be as though they had been sitting on a shelf collecting dust, so severely unspoken for years on end. Sherlock felt cumbersome in the legs and his heart thumped out of his extremely tight chest.
Watson put his hand on Holmes's shoulder and graced it delicately down his sleeved arm and stopped at his tense hand, hanging to his side. He had forgotten how strong Holmes was and how beautifully like silk his skin felt. He cleared his throat while he retreated from Holmes's brutal gaze. Holmes put one finger under Watson's chine beckoning their eyes to meet. "John, please. Why did you really come here?"
Sherlock slowly grinded his body against John's, gasping with his breath beginning to hitch. As they made out, John kissed him tenderly tangling one hand in his curls and using the other to caress Sherlock's back. John pulled away for a moment to really memorize Sherlock's details with the taller man's lustful eyes tempting him.
There was nothing left Watson could do now. He was trapped in the eternal bonds of a love for a man that he could sadly never be with. But then again he had vowed to remain my his side since the moment Holmes had deduced him.
They let go with Holmes still pursing his lips and leaning in for more. Watson gave him one more peck then lay a single hand upon his flushed cheek while Holmes laced his fingers around Watson's back and held him in close.
It wasn't till the day of Holmes's Reichenbach Fall that all Watson's feelings seemed to dormant themselves in the back of his mind. Watson tried to believe that his beloved Holmes would return but his patience was wearing thin by each day. Without a silver of hope left to grasp he was forced to move on.
"It's time," Lestrade said from behind the door with pity in his voice. "Be out in a minute," Watson rebutted.
"Do I really look like that?"
That was all the invitation John needed before he picked Sherlock up and slammed him down on his chair. Sherlock straddled his legs around John just like always before he consumed John's lips and unbuttoned his shirt.
With a heavy heart Watson had given Holmes the news about his engagement to Mary Morstan and Holmes's heart completely broke in two. Perhaps it was suppose to be this way because their love could never come to light. Perhaps it was to be that there was no way of stopping such a day as dark as sin and so cruel as the world itself.
As he strolled up the stairs he could hear the quiet undertones of Sherlock's violin grow louder as he ventured further up the incline. He pushed open the door to find Sherlock swaying with his violin in hand while wearing his dressing gown. The rest of the flat was dark while the sitting room was lit with dim light illuminating both of their chairs and with a raging fire crackling in the fireplace.
It was only when they were alone in the seclusion of their flat that they could be together as they pleased. In the pitch black of night without a being awake to hear the moans of what they really felt for each other. And to feel the heat of their skin when they touched and lay with tangled limbs and ruffled linen sheets. Panting with soft breathes hoping no one would catch them. They would lay close to each other with fingers interlaced and Watson's fingers raking slowly through Holmes's curly hair still stiff from hair gel but loose from the innocence of his carelessness.
Holmes observed in agony as he watched Watson kiss that women. He broke down and looked away biting his lip in sheer misery. He hated and loved his Watson all at once. He hated him for the obvious reasons but loved him because he knew all of this wasn't true. Watson still loved him deeply and sacrificed himself for the good of their intimate affair.
For a long while, a tense Holmes would wait eagerly and hopefully for his Watson to waltz through his door and take him to a destination where they could love as they pleased; but Watson hadn't stepped foot in 221B since his announcement. Not until one evening Watson strolled into the flat like nothing had ever changed, with a lightness to his walk so effortless and easy. Watson slipped off his coat putting it in the closet. Holmes watched closely deducing each graceful move as he blew smoke from his crafted pipe.
"I'm sorry." John looked him deeply in the eyes. Sherlock's eyes were glassy and pretentious. John could see right through his lukewarm stance just by the riven and shattered story his eyes explained to him. He was genuine and soft with his words truly meaning them.
"Everybody out," Lestrade shouted leaving the two men alone. Once Holmes could see the door was completely closed he turned in John's direction with his pupils dilating. Watson sashayed over to Holmes grabbing him by the collar. "My God, look at you." Watson fixed Holmes's bow tie and pushed back the slight puff in his hair. "I was about to remark the same to you," Holmes said moving closer to his well dressed lover.
The man with the charcoal hesitated, staring at the man before him. Sherlock looked so gorgeous with the light so flattering to his lineaments making every inch of his robust, skinny body look positively consumable to John's intense sensual thirst. John had to bite his lip and calm his cock so that he wouldn't jump up from his chair again. Resistance wasn't his strong suit when Sherlock looked so appetizing.
Not too much longer now. Fifteen minutes had passed until he heard a ping arrive and light up the inside of his pocket.
At least John got the side with a good view. A distant but beautiful view of Parliament, its brown color and iconic clock tower so pleasing to the eye as always. He had never given it worthy look until now. He was taken by the magnificent structure until there was a ping from his phone; a single text from Sherlock:
Neither had said a word and yet all their actions spoke it all without even their faintest realization.
Sherlock loved risks but this was the biggest risk had ever taken: letting John see him in a different shade of light; vulnerable with emotion he denied so hard to feel.
"Then why-,"
"Anyway you want," John said, getting a sudden tingle that raced its way through his body.
"Mm, you should be," Sherlock said as curled his toes just as John described.
They needed to separate for the sake of the case. They moved in opposite directions; John to the West, and Sherlock to the East. Both of the boys were going to stake out apposing sides of the street in hopes of catching the criminal they were desperately seeking.
"What do you have done so far?" Sherlock asked impatiently.
"Tomorrow?" Sherlock asked as he took a pause to kiss and bite John's neck.
"John. This is beautiful."
He had his legs extended over one arm of the chair, the leg in front at a bend with its foot rested upon the chairs arm. He lifted and arched his hips exposing as much of his arse cheek as he could. He then draped one bicep over the remaining arm of the chair and let his hand go limp. He straightened his back and rested his right palm behind his ear letting it sink into his curls as he reposed his elbow on top of his chair. Lastly, he turned his head in John's direction, his eyes ushering John to commence.
Nevertheless, he still had a glimmer of feelings for him that would never leave the back of his mind. Even if he could find to love him fully again someday, how could he? They would never truly be together.
"God I've missed you Sherlock," Watson whispered, memorizing the eerie outline of Holmes's tall figure.
He just wanted to know that Sherlock was still there. John wondered if he thought about him as much as he thought about Sherlock. John didn't want to be alone anymore. He wasn't getting anywhere with the case and his arms yearned to wrap themselves around Sherlock's thin body.
John scoffed along with a loving smile and with his eyes he agreed to Sherlock's request.
"Nope, you said I had to draw you first," John shot back for some much needed revenge.
Sherlock unhitched himself from his current position and got up to see John's good work. He kneeled down resting his palms on the floor for a moment to strengthen his legs. When he lifted his palms, his hands were littered with charcoal and blemishes of paint. Sherlock took the pad in his hands and covered his mouth, studying it.
"Sher-"
"Will you John?"
"Damn it Sherlock," John said kicking the carpet under his feet feeling sicker than ever and now with a permanent lump in his throat. "Why do you have to put yourself in danger all the bloody time, why couldn't you have just come to me in the first place?" John covered his mouth in case the vomit he felt in the bowels of his stomach suddenly creeped up on him.
"I've always had a natural talent for it, and yes, I used it often during the war as an escape. I'd draw all the time just to make the days go by faster." Sherlock smiled softly at him bringing his face closer to John's, "why didn't you tell me?"
"The same hands that have gripped onto bed sheets and pillows as I thrust into you and make drive you closer to coming." John drew Sherlock's hands thick and powerful like they have always been. He also drew long fingers and strong, arched knuckles.
"For you and only you."
Later on back at the flat, John was at his computer typing away at an entry for his latest case, along with Sherlock hard at work his mindpalace.
"Now for your face." Sherlock turned his head giving John the angle he needed. John started by drawing a light outline of his head slowly filling in the detail. Itemizing his strong jaw line and darkening his defined and chissled cheekbones. With his utensil he plumped Sherlock's thin but full, kissable lips that had absorbed endless amounts of John's moans and orgasms.
He scratched his pencil, "next your chest," he continued.
Watson ran his hand slowly up the back of Holmes's neck and curled his fingers around it. Holmes let out a frustrated groan sensing his heart race at the feel of Watson touching his stiffened body. He leaned in closer hoping this was what Watson was intending to do. Intending to make his knees buckle before him and to send fiery sweat to dampen his soft shirt.
"Almost done," said John. All he had to do was finish painting Sherlock's body, mimicking every low and highlight in his touchable skin.
"How are you with anatomy?" Sherlock challenged as he shed and dropped his gown to the floor exposing his smooth naked body.
His John was an artist.
Not a moment later Holmes swung open the double doors of the room strolling in with much swagger. A smile came across Watson's face, with also a sparkle of appease in his eyes as he licked his lips. Holmes smiled, "did you truly think I would abandon you?"
John smiled tenderly as he put down his pencil to go and kiss the man he loved. Sherlock stretched his arms gripping his fingers onto the back of John's neck as his head fell backwards.
"I know you can do better," Sherlock growled. John tugged faster, hearing Sherlock's hitched breath pant in his ear. Sherlock rubbed John's crotch and slipped his hand in John's trousers.
"Ears," continued John. "Nose." He finished up the detail in face saving the best part for last before he would lightly go over the drawing with watered down paint.
John noticed instantly what he was doing but he didn't care. He was willing to play along and talk dirty. "Your arms, my god they're thin but muscular. I love to see them shake as you struggle to stay above me. As I kiss and lick my tounge down your body," John hissed as he added detailed veins to each arm. John could see Sherlock shiver out of the corner of his eye.
Sherlock's cheeks steamed with shock and legs pinched feeling like television static. "All I needed was one word Sherlock, just one. I would have waited for you forever if need be." John sniffled now, as a tear started to break loose from his eye. "I've told you repeatedly, I don't care how you did it I wanted to know why; why did you bloody do it in the first place, huh?" John turned in his direction and started walking towards the detective slowly cornering him in.
John touched his forehead to Sherlock's, the taller man sliding his forehead slightly lower than the smaller to make it easier to gaze into his pupils and to feel the radiation seeping from his lips. "And when she shot you...that just put me over the edge."
Watson felt as Holmes felt and he knew he shouldn't. He was getting married in a matter of days but being in this state with Holmes made him wish he had bided a little longer.
"Sounds lovely," John said, placing a peck on Sherlock's lips before running off behind him where they would soon be under the warm heat of the water.
Watson bowed his head trying to restrain himself from making any more regretful decisions. He had already made too many. He had to keep reminding himself that this was for Holmes and how it was one of the best ways to protect him.
They would go on with their lives solving cases and jailing criminals like there were no feelings other than platonic. Suspicion arose and they were frightened but handled it well disposing of any theory anyone would drum up upon the subject of their relationship status. But in the most frightening aspect, it was true what they said. They were in love and it was like they knew something that they themselves couldn't believe.
The reception was a beclouded haze to both Holmes and Watson as they let their depression subdue them. Watson stood in interlocked arms with his new wife but all he could notice was Holmes and his beautiful being. It was too much for Watson to bare to not be with him. He walked over to his love and instructed him to join him outside.
"I know you're sorry. And I know that you know that I'm sorry. We don't have to keep apologizing." John couldn't believe he said that. Ever since Sherlock left that's all he ever wanted; but now that he had it, it didn't matter anymore. All that mattered was what he was holding in his arms, a person he would love unconditionally no matter how tough such a love was.
"And your hands," Sherlock ran over and kneeled down to John sitting in his chair taking his hands in his. He massaged his fingers over John's own and felt his palms. "Rough, like an artist." John laughed again squeezing Sherlock's palms tighter.
Sherlock moved uncomfortably, "I've never been one for sentiment and...love but you've, since the moment we've met, you had always corrupted my mind with affection I never knew I needed." These words more earnest than the last. John grabbed on to the cusp of his shirt for a sense of closeness letting out a suddle sigh of relief.
"That was my fault I was being an idiot," Sherlock said with a sharp breath again easing his stress.
"Oi, we both had a part in this, we made our mess now its time to clean it up," John said wiping a tear from under his eye.
Sherlock lifted John's head looking half annoyed and half turned on. "After you draw me."
"As much as you don't like to admit it, your chest contains a heart as well, and I'm so lucky to have it beat for me," John cooed.
"I love gripping yours and sliding my long fingers into it" Sherlock provoked as he curled them.
"And now my favorite part, your beautiful eyes." John looked over at the nude man in the chair as Sherlock's wicked gaze tantalized John to come to him.
The next day John sat at the clinic thinking of nothing other than Sherlock. He couldn't believe the night before he had agreed to draw that beautiful man. Secretly John had drawn Sherlock before; he was an exceedingly frequent muse of his.
"Draw me."
Watson looked away and shook his head in hopes to compose himself. He took a deep breathe, "William Sherlock Scott Holmes, will you marry me?" He asked in the happiest tone he could muster.
"Oh god please do," John said eyeing him up. "So perfect," John whispered in crook of Sherlock's neck before Sherlock came copiously in John's hot hand. John snickered immorality as he tongued the inside Sherlock's open mouth.
"I couldn't tell you," Sherlock continued, "If I did, you'd come after me." He smiled slightly and so did John adding a scoff.
John paced gently around the floor with folded arms. "I would have choked out Mycroft just to find out where you went. I would have wanted to come with you," John said almost to himself.
It was true Watson could never love Holmes as deeply as the past because he had honestly grown feelings for another through that harsh time of Holmes's lose. He knew Holmes still loved him but Watson was nearly sure he didn't love him the same.
"I'm flattered."
"Little anxious are we, Watson?" Lestrade laughed with the other men in the room joining in.
"Tell about my hips John and how they buck from underneath you when you fuck me obscenely."
Sherlock bowed his head slightly and smiled from John's romantic comment. "I plan to hold yours just as firmly." John smiled with a thankful expression.
"Will I what?"
"Oh...she's fine." John took a pause and lightly smiled to himself. "Yeah, lots of crying, noise, and a whole lot of work but she's fine," the man said running his hand stressfully down his face.
"Such gifted hands," Sherlock said as he moved John's palm against his lips. Sherlock leaned over and kissed John's neck wetly, and suddenly in his ear he whispered, "use them on me."
"Sherlock, did you find something?" John asked turning away from the screen in front of him.
"Alright." Sherlock turned around and untucked his shirt, pulling it up only half way revealing a minimal but dreadful portion of the white scars scattered across his back. Sherlock to this day could still feel the sting from the whips and the unrelenting trickle of blood that flowed from them after his beatings.
"Well, it's captivating, it's wonderful. I love it." He smiled up at John and John smiled back as he pinched Sherlock's chin. Sherlock got up and set the painting on the coffee table in the kitchen and when he returned he sat on John's lap.
John rolled his eyes, "yes you do."
John leaned forward in his chair, "all three it looks like." So that's how John painted them; mixing in blue, green, and gold all at once.
"I don't know how to be a father."
"Its only been one," John said with a laugh while taking off his coat.
He scoffed, "Thinks I'm out getting the milk. You know how she feels about our sessions." He trailed off into a distant stare. "She's scared that I'm going to tell you about what she did but... she doesn't know that I've already told you everything." He bit down on his lip staring blankly at the carpet.
"Nonsense John, the eye of an artist is always a sharp one and I am proud to have one all to myself." John licked his lips, "come here," he said pulling his hands away and wrapping them around Sherlock, pulling his body onto his lap. Sherlock always knew how to make him feel speical. Sherlock wrapped his arms around John's shoulders while John pressed his open lips onto Sherlock's.
"I too am sorry," Holmes said with a tear escaping his eye causing him to turn away hoping Watson wouldn't see him weep. They both looked down at the ring Holmes held in his hand. Holmes rested his head on Watson's shoulder while Watson adjusted his head to fit Holmes better and to be able to feel his head safely protected under his.
Watson had tears in his eyes but he shed his tears for someone else. Holmes grabbed him by the shoulder as a sign of forgiveness. He grieved too with Watson's words driving through his heart like bitter poison.
Since his return he hadn't drawn him since. He deeply missed it in all honesty. Darkening the indent of his cheekbones, defining each individual curl with the shading of his pencil, and adding a splash of color to those eyes, the same inconceivable eyes that he would always find himself lost in.
"John, your notebook," Sherlock called out extending out his palm and waiting for John to comply.
"John, you need to let these things out. Something's bothering you, you wouldn't be here if there wasn't a problem," John's therapist Ella confirmed with a pen in her hand and another almost completely filled notebook, with notes from only John's sessions on her lap. John twiddled with his thumbs on his knee trying to get as relaxed as possible but his inner tension was too deep for any type of tranquilly.
Holmes dipped him back and kept him in the flowing motion hoping Watson would feel the electricity that fueled his body at such a heated time as this.
"The first glance you took at me made me fall deeply and I had never found myself to stay away." He took a pause hoping to hold all emotion. "Even when you neglected to be near me I never lost my love and hope that you would come back. And when you did, my heart never had rejoiced so rapidly." Watson couldn't control the unsteadiness of his legs or the sweat moistening his hands. "You have given more adventure in one lifetime than I had ever dreamed possible. I was so abandoned and so alone and I owe you my life." Watson choked up with the few words he had already said. "I will spend the rest of my life making up for my mistakes and will cherish you always, even if we can't be together."
"Precisely," Watson agreed. "I worry and..miss you terribly." Watson looked up at him intently, hoping he didn't step over any boundaries he wasn't prepared to cross. Holmes smiled lovingly at his Watson, "and I you." Watson wasn't affirmative with the tricks Holmes had up his sleeve while the taller man began to touch him intently, slipping a smooth hand around his thinned waist. Holmes started to sway Watson in a dancing motion and Watson let him have his way with him. Soon they fell silent listening to the stings of the violins and the wind from the pipes of the music that filled the flat, playing for them a melancholy melody and found themselves dancing nimbly across the carpet. Watson stopped for a moment and looked up at his Holmes memorizing his face and rationalizing about how much time they had lost together and how easily he had forgotten what true happiness felt like.
They showed affection in stealthy advances as minimal as possible. The touches as simple as helping the other into the carriage, being able to lay a hand upon the others back and slightly gripping a hold of their clothes showing that they were protected. Or when the other would fetch the others pipe, handing it over gently with the opportunity to overlap and feel the sting in their yearning fingers. Or when they walked side by side down Baker Street intentionally swinging their palms a bit too far and having their shoulders a bit too cocked for a second of touch to make sure that their blood still pumped their hearts full of the sentiment that many thought was unjust.
He was finally starting to enjoy himself until he heard a ping again come from his phone and as he watched the sun dip behind the buildings of the city.
There seemed to be an instant tension making itself known as it invaded the room, completely unaware from the mind of Doctor Watson. "I know. Which is why he came here so you have no further choice."
"Perhaps in another life," Holmes said with a sulk in his voice.
"Watson? And why, may I ask, are you here at this late hour?" Holmes asked standing up abruptly from his chair and not bothering to cease the music he was playing softly from his phonograph.
"Everything," he said with a laugh. "Everything I didn't say to him. Everything I've told you and haven't had the guts to tell him." John's expression was bitter. "I wanted to tell him how I felt about the fall, the two years without him, how pissed off I was and still am at him. About Mary and the wedding..." He swallowed harshly, "and how I feel about him..."
Sherlock's words sliced open John's heart making him let go of the shirt he clutched throwing him off balance and causing him to fall back a bit on his feet.
The next two hours were two of the longest hours in John's lifetime. Boring. He resisted the urge to pick up his phone and text Sherlock until the temptation was overwhelming. He didn't want to discuss the case.
"How's the baby?"
Sherlock ran a quaking hand through his curls, "oh John I had no idea," he said in his low baritone voice. John was inching closer to him and thinking to himself how such a smart man as Sherlock could also be so incredibility thick at the same time.
Sherlock loved this. John complementing his body as he engraved him forever in a work of art. He began to move his hand again to his cock as John's words of endearment pleasured his ear.
"Wait until I came back," Sherlock said muffled in John's neck. "Only if you would have told me. I would have waited my entire life if it came to that." John wedged his palm under Sherlock's chin beckoning his eyes to meet his. "Look at me." Sherlock slowly lifted his head, "I've made a horrendous mistake in marrying her. It was a whirlwind thing, I was so sure of it, thought this was it but, being with you again just the two of us against the rest of the world, I couldn't have been more wrong."
"You're ridiculous," John said as he stared into Sherlock's wide galactic eyes being lit by the roaring embers of the fire. John brought his hands to his lips and kissed them.
She folded her hands,"Its time to tell him about everything. You're a good man John and you deserve to be happy."
This wasn't a game anymore. This was John Watson and he wasn't playing any longer. And this time, this time only, Sherlock wasn't either. He was going to give John the closure he needed, as well as what he needed for himself, no matter how much it would put their friendship in danger.
Holmes touched his forehead to Watson's letting out a shaky breath. Watson opened his mouth about to form a sentence but there was a knock at the door.
"You will draw me anyway I want?"
"Alright," John said stretching his arms and throwing down his paintbrush.
John took a pause, unsure of why he had blurted out such a sentimental statement.
There was nothing they could do now. This was life, and they were just losing at it.
"Your arms."
Watson laughed a small chuckle of relieve while running his hand across the flip of his hair.
Letting the sentiment consume them, they became misty-eyed again from something so long overdue and sheltered from time and the events of the past but instantly becoming something so quenching to their lust and yet so therapeutic to their mental wounds that made their suffering worth every crippling blow.
"Neither do I, but you're the great Sherlock Holmes, you'll figure it out," John said grabbing him by the nape of his neck and colliding their foreheads together. John looked into the taller man's magnifying and kaleidoscopic eyes studying him as much as he observed people; he loved this man to an untamed level. Sherlock looked equally fondly down at his blogger seeing the wear and tear marks he had left forever embedded in his soft aging skin. He finally understood what he had gone through and he had never felt such deep penance for his actions. When he said he was sorry, he meant it with all the heart he thought didn't exist before he met John.
Ella scanned his face and body. He looked older and more tired than he had since their last session. The golden brown in his eyes had hollowed, his lips were dry and cracked, and his hand unconsciously grabbed for the cane he had given up the moment he met Sherlock.
"Moriarty had a very complex web, very top secret I had to take care of it myself." John shifted his eyes down letting out a sigh of stress.
Sherlock moved his hand up his thigh with a seductive lift of his eyebrow, leaving a trail of charcoal on his inner thigh from touching the material infested ground. John replied with an eyebrow lift of his own and lay a hand upon Sherlock's cheek, leaving a black hand print. "So beautiful," cooed John. Sherlock slid his palm up John's wrist and caught John's palm, letting their black coated hands mesh together.
“Would-”
Sherlock plowed forth, over his incredulity with the determination of a man to his death, “It involves a lot of adrenaline-”
He grinned, feeling silly, imagining an abandoned warehouse filled with a hundred old cabbie men that dressed worse than he does. He also felt a little woozy. The adrenaline had dwindled, replaced by the unbroken pride of a job well done, an ache in his shoulder that bemoaned of further recovery to come, and a dizzy headache.
The man hummed in acknowledgment, his fingers tapping restlessly where they rested on his thigh, and John shifted uncomfortably, feeling exposed without his layers of shirts. There were old scars on his arms, and his trousers were falling down, only kept up by his tight grip on the fabric, so he couldn’t even rub them to calm the itch that simmered in his bones. He’s cold, he’s tired, and he’s not hungry, but his brain was giving him due warning that if he did not get food in his system right about now he would collapse.
John considered this. “Am I a test subject?”
John stared at him for a beat too long, contemplating the fact that the statement implied that if Sherlock could drive, he would not hesitate to do so for John. The little bubbles shot through his veins, and John giggled. “Of course.”
“Well?” asked Sherlock, eyebrows raised high on his forehead. His curls swept down over them, and John maybe wanted to swipe them away, just a tiny bit. He grasped his cane tightly.
He was ignored. “When did you last eat?”
John furrowed his eyebrows and stared at Sherlock’s profile, who studied the street with calculated (false?) disinterest. “What makes you say that?”
John’s tongue stalled in his mouth, hesitating, then flicked out over his lips. Sherlock watched, and John was sure that his cheeks were burning up because he can’t remember the last time someone looked at him like that. Attraction, maybe. He could barely believe it. He didn’t, really - felt like an imposter, swallowed by clothes two sizes too big and wasting away in his own skin as this modern Adonis of a man looked at him with something other than pity. He again wondered how hard he actually hit his head.
“What do you mean you solved the serial suicides? Are you a cop?”
The next thing I know, he’s standing up—wide palms cupping my arse—and I’ve got my legs wrapped around his slender hips. He takes a step like he intends to carry me to the bedroom, but I fist my hands in his hair—tugging his head back and exposing his throat to my hungry mouth. We crash against the wall, kissing and rutting and tearing at each other’s clothes.
Sherlock couldn't help wrinkling his nose. “That’s. . . disgusting.”
John comes up from behind him, bare feet a quiet slap against the marble floor. He doesn’t say a word, just runs his hands down Sherlock’s back, over his silk dressing gown—new from the market this afternoon, royal blue and so fine it whispers against his skin. John’s hands reach his waist, the loose cinch of his belt, and circle around to the front. He pulls the knot free and tugs, slipping the belt out of it’s loops.
. That is sweet. A hot bloom of pleasure that skirts at the edge of too much.
His whole mouth covers my areola—hot and wet—and I sigh in relief. A cocktail of oxytocin, dopamine, and serotonin sings in my veins, leaving me intoxicated and brimming with pleasure.
“Yes.” John huffed. “Do it.”
Sherlock feels a flush steal across his cheeks and ducks his head. John watches him through lowered lashes. It looks like adoration and makes Sherlock’s want to squirm.
. It meant howling into the pillows as he hammered my prostate. It meant being at his mercy.
“You've seen my torso.” Sherlock skimmed his hand from collar bone to hip. “Even at my most limber, I could just lick the tip.”
John grunted, the coil of pleasure snapping. The first streak landed across the dimple at Sherlock’s sacrum, the next sliding thick and milky down his crack. John pushed his cock against Sherlock’s hole, filling him with three more hot loads.
Sherlock pulled away—still close enough to feel John’s heat, but no leaning into him. He cocked his head in consideration. “Are you typically enthralled by your clients?”
Sherlock's eyes move around the room, taking in the pile of clothes in the corner, the desk covered in textbooks. The bed is directly behind him and he isn't quite sure what to do with that information. Sit perhaps?
"Your sense of humor is beyond reproach," Sherlock deadpanned. "Truly, you're wasted as a detective."
He bites his lip, but doesn't quite manage to hide a smug little smile. Oh. . . This is going to be delicious, making him squirm.
“Oh God, baby,” John says, breath hot against the nape of my neck. His hand slips over my hip, up the swell of my belly and cups gently around my breast. “Christ your tits are huge.”
With a bone-deep groan, John plastered his face between Sherlock’s cheeks. Licking and kissing and sucking until Sherlock’s hole was sopping wet and loose. He kissed down the ridge of him perineum again, letting his tongue slide into the furrow at either side, then sucked one ball firmly into his mouth. Sherlock stiffened and John felt the tips of fingers in his hair—Sherlock petting him as best as the angle would allow.
Enjoy!
I ease my way down, rocking forward and back. The heat makes me sigh, the pressure gives that breath the tiniest bit of voice—a mewl of contentment caught in the back of my throat.
John tugs down the waistband of Sherlock's briefs, bunches everything down to his thighs. He stills, stares, and Sherlock might have felt a twinge of self-consciousness if it weren't for the hunger that darkens John’s eyes.
“Are you hard?”
John wraps his hand around the length, pumps it twice, as if testing, and lets it go. Sherlock whimpers at the loss. He doesn't know how much more of this he can take. But then John is spitting in his palm and suddenly everything is slick and hard and fast.
Sherlock nodded, throat too dry to summon up words.
His hand curls around my skull, his fingers pressing me forward. His cock glides over my tongue, along my soft palate—filling my mouth. I taste tang and brine and musk, the distinct flavor of his arousal. I keep going until I can feel the tickle of golden curls against the tip of my nose. He gasps when I swallow around his thickness, the fingers in my hair spasming. I twist my head, this way and that, eyes never leaving the tiny glinting aperture.
“Would you…” Sherlock lies down next to John, curls the tips of his fingers over the crest of John’s hip. “Would you like to do something like that again?”
"Off with the coat and shoes, I think," John suggested, giving Sherlock a slow once-over.
I rolled on to my back and my breath caught at the sight of John as he knealt above me. He was flushed from exertion—skin rosy pink with a thin sheen of sweat darkening his hairline and limning his shoulders and chest. His eyes smouldered and his smirking mouth glistened with come.
Lestrade frowned. “I didn’t ask. You begged. No cases in a month, you said. Anything I’ve got on, you said.”
“Ahh. . . Fuck yeah. Fuck, fuck, ohh. . . Sherlock. I'm close. Ahh!”
“Fuck, yes,” I whimper into the blanket. I don’t think I’ve ever felt this deliciously slutty.
John’s laughter subsides. “You must be a genius.”
Sherlock slid his hands into his pockets and peered around Lestrade’s shoulder. Between the bustle of officers, he caught a glimpse of two bodies sat next to each other, backs to the brick wall and legs out straight. “What’ve you got?”
Eventually his fingers slacken, card through my hair in apology and praise. I let his softening prick slip from my lips, trailing a string of saliva as it drops. Looking up at him, I make a show of licking my lips—cleaning every warm smear of spit and come.
Underneath me, Sherlock is rolling his hips lazily. His eyes are closed and his cheeks are painted a lovely shade of pink, and if those weren’t good enough clues, the subtle pulsing of his cock tells me all I need to know.
“Glad you approve.” John deadpanned.
“Wouldn't miss it.”
Pleasure pulsed through him like lava, molten hot and sluggish. Devastating. Unstoppable. He cried out, an aching moan of bliss.
John doesn't hesitate. He lowers his head, dropping quick kisses over Sherlock’s chest before closing his lips around Sherlock's other nipple, already peaked in anticipation. He's gentle at first, suckling and flicking his tongue. Then his fingers give a sharp twist and his teeth bite down and Sherlock is howling. He bucks up, finds John’s hard thigh and begins to rut against it.
“Alright.”
The strange discoloration of the corpse and dried pool of vomit staining the threadbare carpet certainly didn't suggest anything as simple as a heart attack.
So I slip the head of his cock between my lips and slide down. I take my time, slowly bobbing, letting the tight seal of my lips ride back and forth over the flaring crown. Then a little more and a little more. His fingers are loosely tunneled into my curls, not demanding even as they twitch and tug. I look up at him, at the camera, with half his cock down my throat, and I plead—a plaintiff keen high in my chest.
Sherlock's mouth went dry. “Jesus.”
“You are very much alive,” Sherlock reassured, stroking his hands down John's legs. “But I do fear you're in no condition for reciprocity.”
John’s hand lingered on Sherlock’s inseam as he pulled away. “Why don't you go upstairs and put on the kettle.”
We leave a trail of clothes in our wake, crossing the threshold to the bedroom just as our pants hit the floor. He crowds me, but I don’t go down easy. I take his cock in a firm grip and stroke him roughly, until the back of my knees hit the mattress and I topple over.
“Yes,” Sherlock croaked.
“That feel good?” John asks, just as breathless as Sherlock.
“Is it good?” I ask, more a scientific curiosity than anything else.
“You seem to have forgotten the tea,” Sherlock noted.
Sherlock. Inside me.
“Yes, John. Come on. Come, John.”
As a couple, they were by no means sexually restrained. They explored each other’s fantasies just as readily as their bodies. Learning each other’s limits, uncovering each other’s secrets, and relishing in everything they shared. In that regard, today was nothing new. But as John’s fingers clawed at the chair, as his face and neck and chest flushed with the intensity of his orgasm, Sherlock felt confident today was truly special. It was there in John’s whimpers, the tremors in his thighs, the way he pushed feebly at Sherlock's head once he’d grown too sensitive.
Slowly, John pulled away. He brought his hand to rest on Sherlock’s thigh and let his cock slip from his mouth as if it were a fragile thing—spun glass rather than steel.
. And I want it all recorded. I want to play it back again and again and remember the time we fucking lost ourselves in a filthy alley behind our second favorite cafe.
He ignores me in favor of shifting closer and rolling the dripping nub, slow and gentle. More milk dribbles out, not enough to qualify as a squirt, but certainly more than before.
John’s moving rougher now, fucking into my mouth with short jerks. I don’t fight it as his blunt nails bite into my scalp. Instead, I rut into my hand and moan around the thickness between my lips.
John runs the pads of his fingers over the exposed length, pinches at the head, and swipes his finger and thumb across the slit. With the camera zoomed in, I can see the clear strand of precome stretch and snap as he tests the tensile strength.
“Right hand. Play with your balls. Keep stroking with the left.”
“Pull up the leg of your shorts,” I whisper, urgent. Desperate even to my own ears.
He fucks Sherlock like he’s making a demonstration to the moon and stars. He fucks Sherlock like the entire plaza is watching.
Without warning, the pleasure peaks. Sherlock feels his balls draw up tight and cries out, voice high and broken. Ecstasy crackles along his nerves and he tenses, dangles over the edge of the precipice for seconds that feel like eons, then falls. Orgasm washes over him, like diving into a warm sapphire sea—an all encompassing rush, then floating weightless until he breaks the surface and gasps for air.
“And he took that bet?”
“I just couldn’t—wait. What?”
“Jesus,” I drawl as his hips churn under me, cock carving up and into my body. “Sherlock. . . fuck. That’s lovely.”
“How’s it feel?” Sherlock, tracing his finger along the edge, where rod met flesh.
“Oh, Christ.” His cock jerks, eager for more. “Christ. Okay.”
It was the work of less than a minute before the throb of pleasure brought him to the precipice—teetering, breathless.
Between breaths and strokes on the page John was beginning to become restless but he wasn't going to ruin his work.
"Unless of course I can go with you."
"Mmh, yes of course. No one can make me writhe like you do," John agreed.
"Don't you dare," John said in a sinister tone as he etched the curve of hips and the thickness of his thighs on the paper. John took his free hand and began to toy with his own cock as Sherlock's deep moans compelled him to do so.
Watson licked his lips while looking into Holmes's kaleidoscopic eyes and holding his hand carefully in dim light on the drafty flat. He was aroused by everything that was happening at this moment. The delicate hand holding, the strong arm holding his back, and how close their lips were from touching and how much he wanted reunite them once again. The sentiment of his hidden love for his Holmes had returned in a full blaze of the passion he thought he forgotten. He had forgiven him in this moment for all the wrong and the sorrow that he had inflicted on him in just a matter of moments.
"We're so dirty," said John examining both their bodies covered in come, charcoal and paint.
He took a deep shaken breath like always before he was about to release something that would change the whole tone in the room. He looked out the window and watched the ominous clouds eat the layer of the hopeful blue sky, replacing it with only a hinted shade of grey; a lot like the grey John felt had consumed his heart.
"Sorry I can't be strong for you," Sherlock blurted out with a deep sulk in voice and reading John's mind like a book he had glanced at a million times over. Sherlock had really turned off his filter and was committed to the whole "laying it all out on the table," portion of the talk.
, John thought. He wasn't helping.
Watson moistened his lips and suddenly his confident stride was broken from him, replaced with uncertainty, as if he had made a miscalculation. "Curious upon the subject of your whereabouts." Watson advanced largely towards Holmes eventually meeting him face to face. Holmes's stance was tense and he had a fine assumption on what Watson's true intentions were but he wanted to hear it clearly from the subject himself.
"Was it just to prove that you're clever, as always? What could have been so BLOODY important that required you to have to do that to me?" John asked the question that had burned him from the inside ever since it happened and had never gotten a proper answer. "Seeing you up on that building while I was standing on the ground so powerless, all I wanted, all I've ever wanted to do was protect you. And not being able to that day? I've never forgiven myself." He took a minute to compose himself. "I buried you Sherlock. I was at your funeral mourning you, thinking of all the things I could've done to save you and never getting the chance to do so." The guilt he felt was still fresh after all these years.
"Stay still," said John. He tried incredibly hard not to touch himself. The faster he'd get the drawing done the faster he could get to Sherlock. In just that little span of time he had sketched out the neck and shoulders. Both places where he had left countless amounts of love bites and kisses; and on John's neck and shoulders, Sherlock had done in return.
"I need Holmes," Watson blurted out, not even giving the statement a second thought. "Be here he will," Lestrade retorted while taking a swig of the glass of whiskey that lay on the table.
"A bit tired but otherwise fine," Irene says, "They kept me in the hospital for two days and I missed my Saturday shift."
"Really? Like you
"What's wrong?" Sherlock asks when there's no one around.
Sherlock shrugs on an apron. He and John settle into a rhythm. Sherlock takes the orders, sometimes guessing them, and John makes the drinks.
She stalks towards the bathroom, trailing wet footprints behind her.
"Hey, Sherlock," he says, not yet seeing Molly.
He stops a few feet in front of the fire and turns to face Sherlock.
Molly and John shake hands.
Indeed it is a mess. The street is covered in a layer of swimming water. Few cars drive past, and the ones that do go at a crawl.
"I live in the apartment above
"Shouldn't we wait until we close to do that?" John asks.
"Sure," John says without hesitation, turning to smile at Sherlock.
As Sherlock bounds across the pavement he pulls a thin metal pipe from his coat pocket.
"You think I'm handsome?" he asks, leaning forward ever so slightly, placing his hand softly on Sherlock's knee.
"I would do it again, take all the pain just to feel you against my lips for the first time all over again," Sherlock said with all seriousness.
"Yes," Sherlock said with slowly closing eyes.
"Sherlock I swear...," John trailed off as he began to sketch while trying to ignore the resurgence of his boner.
"Oh John," Sherlock groaned as he kicked his legs lightly and rolled his hips.
"Anyway I want?"
"And Mary?"
"I guess I'm not the only one who's been dirty," said John as he got up from on top of Sherlock to clean his hands, upper half, and face. Sherlock smiled with a laugh, not denying his statement. Sherlock looked down at his cock coated with come, charcoal and paint. Sherlock rolled over in his chair as he watched John cleanse himself.
"Sorry?" John asked as he sat in his chair, getting himself comfortable and setting down his supplies.
"How could you do that to me?" He was face to face with him now, John's empty eyes penetrating him and choking Sherlock into answering the question without a single touch.
"You really want to run away?" Watson inquired. Holmes looked away not providing him with a proper answer. Watson thought a little longer, maybe some laws were meant to be broken, and his love for Holmes was proof of that.
"In the mean time I'll destract you. My thighs, don't you love to kiss and lick inside them?"
Watson leaned in closer with a bit of hesitation before he gave into the temptation that had pulled him back into the tangled and loving secret that was their relationship. The cold breeze that fluffed the curtains and filled the flat chilled their hot bodies drying their lips as they touched them together after waiting for so long.
Sherlock's eyes flashed up as he broke silently inside himself truly unaware of the pain he had caused him. "How nicely that bullet would have eased my stress and giving me the chance to be with you again. Believe me I've tried."
As he drew, he also began to outline the leather of the chair Sherlock perched in. Then shading it appropriately in correlation to how the light hit it.
Holmes's knuckles turned white as he clenched onto John's collar. "It's time," Holmes said with avoidance of all eye contact. He never thought it would come to this again. He didn't believe that he would have the strength to lose him all over again. "Be strong," he said before his parted lips met Watson's. If he couldn't be strong he knew that Watson would make up for it with being undoubtedly brave. "Only for you my dearest Sherlock," Watson said as he savoured the final kiss he would share with his only true lover so deeply before he was no longer a bachelor.
"I want you in so many," John joked.
"No I meant position."
"And if something would have happened, I would have never forgiven myself," Sherlock said with an impulse to grab John's hand. "How bad did they hurt you?" John pleaded. "...in Serbia." Sherlock seemed to wince at the question. "Doesn't matter, it seems I've hurt you more than they could have ever hurt me."
Sherlock's throat tightened and his mouth thirsted for dilution. His licked his lips fearing the day that he'd have to tell him the truth. Fearing this moment for so long because after this, he would know about everything Sherlock desperately tried to lock away in his mindpalace; hoping that they would never come to light. This moment right here, right now that would make or brake his friendship with his most trusted companion. John had dealt the cards, he laid it all out on the table, all Sherlock had to do was look at his hand.
"Ah," Sherlock stammered over and over as he neared closer to coming. John rolled his thumb across the head of Sherlock's cock, feeling the pre-come ooze out of it. John kissed and bit of his bottom lip giving it a light tug, while Sherlock breathed large gulps of weak air in the mouth of the man draining his adrenaline.
"When did you learn? I assume a pass time during the war?"
John wanted to text more but he decided to let the conversation die. He didn't want to ruin Sherlock's focus.
"Oh those hands," Sherlock said with hips pulsing against John's.
"It shattered me to see you with her. You were all I thought about and all I ever wanted was to get back to you in the years I was away from London. You were my motivation to stay alive." There was bitterness in his voice.
"We should probably wash our hands," John said with a groan, suffocating in Sherlock's hard relentless kiss.
But Sherlock's face turned dark with the flip of a switch, "but you chose her."
"Just your neck and shoulders."
"Good night," Holmes would respond as he lays a hand upon his cheek and graces it down to his neck giving it a loving squeeze. Every night before Watson would leave Holmes's space he would silently apologize telling him that he was sorry that they couldn't be as they wanted. Loving and happy like when they spent nights in the same bed and for those few glorious hours when they were alone and they could be untouched from ridicule and shame as some would call it.
"Us, us safe. Must you always play by the rules Watson?" Holmes looked down at Watson trying to seduce him into pursuing his plan.
"Your hips are so prominent. I love to nibble at them and hold them when I thrust into you and you try to hold them still. But the best thing about your hips is when I take you in my mouth." John licked his lips and made a slight popping sound with them to make sure Sherlock could hear him.
he said to himself.
"My God," John said in a low awestruck whisper before he touched his pencil to the paper. This made Sherlock turn a hinted shade of pink as he winked in John's direction.
"What next?" He asked again.
"Didn't seem very useful to our work."
"Yes," Sherlock said with a laugh in his response while he pulled John closer into him. They sat in silence hugging and swaying for a long while before John spoke gently, "god you're so brilliant and beautiful." He shook he head, "what am I going to do with you?"
