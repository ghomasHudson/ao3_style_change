without you.”
“I missed everybody, fancy Jack being able to bring everybody back.” Sam stopped for a minute and Dean seen the far off look on his face and knew he was thinking about everyone they had lost, even if it was for only a moment, it left a mark that wouldn’t quickly heal.
While Cass disappearing became a bi-weekly occurance. Dean just wished that it wouldn’t happen on
Dean closed his eyes after dropping a few more kisses, trying to will himself to, finally, fall asleep. As much as he wished he could treasure the last twenty minutes he had with the love of his life, he didn’t think he would be able to handle watching Billie take him from him again. He had watched him die far too many times, and the knowledge that this would officially,
“Hell if I know. He fucks off every week or so, then when he comes back, he locks himself in his room and pretends like I don’t exist.” He let out a forced chuckle, shaking his head. He reached behind himself and grabbed his beer from where it was resting against the windshield. “Dude tells me he loves me then wants nothing to do with me when I offer myself up to him on a silver platter. Go figure.”
his son, would send him away again.
Dean shook his hand out of Castiel’s grip, but he didn’t move any further away. “Cass, it’s fine. We can forget anything ever happened.” He felt sick to his stomach. “You’re back. That’s all I need, okay? If you need to go somewhere else to find your happiness, that’s fine. I’m just happy knowing you’re alive.”
Castiel watched Dean cook for a few minutes before standing up and moving to stand next to him, leaning his back against the counter and grabbing Dean’s beer from off the counter. He took a sip before asking, “Where are Jack and Sam?”
Dean shrugged, his jaw tensing. “Don’t know.”
After a few seconds of waiting for Castiel to speak, Castiel cracked. He couldn’t take the silence after those words again, not when every other time Dean “needed to talk” to him led to him feeling alone and unwanted. What if Dean was kicking him out again, and this park was where he was planning on ditching him? “What’s wrong, Dean? Did I . . . did I do something wrong?” He bit his lip.
was the one straddling Castiel’s lap. Castiel tried to catch what Dean said, but he was took quiet. “I’m sorry?”
Dean looked up to see Claire standing next to the Impala, an arm crossed over her stomach and a cigarette between her fingers. She reached into her pocket and pulled out her pack of cigarettes, handing one to Dean.
Sam and Dean had been too busy fighting off the monster's collegues to notice that their friend was missing, and by the time that they had, Castiel's head had gone under water more than once. Jack had managed to pull him out, but he had never been trained in CPR (nor had he ever heard of it, coincidentally), so it had been up to Sam and Dean to save their friend's life.
Claire shrugged. “I’m outside. It’s fine.” She looked around at the trees surrounding the bunker. “Seriously, though, where’s Cass? Jody promised me that he’d be here. Finally give me a chance to kick his ass for not telling me he was back.” She smirked at Dean, sticking her tongue out of the side of her mouth.
Dean didn’t move away, though, lunging forward as soon as he was positive that Castiel wasn’t going to pull away, and once their lips met, Dean could have sworn that Castiel was an angel again, the sparks in the air burning his eyes.
Castiel climbed off the motorcycle on shaky legs, taking the helmet and glasses off and putting them on the seat behind Dean. He lifted his hands and pulled at his hair, running his fingers through the strands and rubbing at his scalp. Dean watched him with a small smile, getting off the bike and putting his own helmet next to Castiel’s.
Castiel only had to think about it for a moment before nodding. “Yes, Dean. I will marry you.” He smiled softly before reaching out and pulling Dean into a gentle kiss. “Besides, I’m human now. I can grow old with you. I can’t imagine anywhere else I’d rather be.”
“Fine, jerk.”
Castiel rubbed his thumb in circles along the back of Dean’s hand, grabbing one of the sandwiches and nibbling on a corner of it as he looked at Dean. Dean’s eyes were glassy and he was not blinking, the hand not holding Castiel’s gripping the sandwich so tightly that the jelly was beginning to ooze over his fingers.
“Mornin dean.” Sam said handing the spoons out the door to eileen who peeked her head in,
“We’ll have to disinfect later.” Cas said scrunching his nose.
“You do.” Sam looked at him for a moment, hoping he’d continue, but when he didnt he asked, “Give me the run down.” Dean thought for a bit, obviously weighing something in his head,
“What happened with the vampire?”
“well there was that one weekend in Manitoba-“
“Love y’all.” Dean said throwing the car into gear,
“Time’s different in heaven but we still can only get so much done, but I’ll be back before you know it.” Cas said nudging Dean’s foot from where he was sitting.
“Thanks dean!” Dean looked at her slightly confused,
“I’ll leave with you for the meeting and then I’ll be gone.”
“Yeah, you know what i like about him is that hes sarcastic but thoughtful and appreciative too-“
Dean spent the next few days sweeping and mopping and reorganizing and re-reorganizing. He helped plan and pack and on Friday morning he said his goodbyes. Jodi packed everyone into thier cars and checked their seat belts, dean made everyone lunches, and rowena would never admit it but she snuck an extra pair of underwear and socks into everyone’s bags. As Sam and Eileen drove off in the old, navy, men of letters car that dean had fixed-not that it needed much- dean waved until they were out of site and went back inside to do god-well who knows what as it had probably already been done a few times.
“If we just sit here we defiantly wont find leads.”
Rowena and Gabriel landed on the bed in The Towers at Lotte Palace Hotel, neither technically needed to breath so they didnt put any space between them for a good long while. Gabriel made a face through the kiss and rowena pulled away. She gave him an offended look,
Eileen Leahy
“No” she said quietly, “And if you dare tell him, I will end you.”
1) I have a couple knew projects I’m working on, maybe a couple more fandoms, stuff like that and
“Magnus cant die and Alec can. Do you know how many times we have to derail that conversation?” Simon answered her,
“Not yet.” Crowley leered, then he sunk into his chair more and exhaustedly scrubbed his face,
“Okay.” Dean said with a sigh and pulled Cas into a hug.
Sam walked out of the kitchen, arms full of candy and cookies Dean had made, and a six pack of beer. What? He was going to be in his room for atleast three days, trying to avoid whatever had happened to his brother and the angel. He walked past deans room on the way to his own and he heard them giggling, yes giggling, like school children. He rolled his eyes and got to his room, turned on the tv and opened a beer. At least now maybe instead of tension they’ll just be sticking thier tongues down thier throats, maybe they’d even let sam get his own car so he wouldn’t have to deal with it anymore. Eh, he thought, i guess some progress is good progress.
“Oh hello! Who are you?” She said cheerily, stepping back to let them in. She rushed to the kitchen and put down a pan of cookies on a messy counter. Dean looked at her a little confused, “Oh, do sit down! Cookies?” She asked waving her hand as the dishes floated into the sink and with a clatter fell in, “Whoopsy! I’ve never been good at cleaning spells. You must be dean winchester and my aren’t you a pretty angel Castiel.” She said walking to them and giving them hugs, both men stood in spot very confused.
“Oh yes-where was I? Oh! Im sorry about my attire, just came back from the gym, then I got a call that the suspect had escaped so naturally I was sent to chase after him. I dont eat as many donuts.” He said with a wink, kaia cringed inwardly but nodded along, “But just as I caught up to him he sort of collapsed and cracked and I could have sworn he was made of twigs or something, but then he got up again and then vanished in a puff of purple dust.”
“We’re dumbasses.”
“I missed you too, I’m sorry.”
“I dont get it.”
“Your favorite.” Jack smiled at him and stole a chocolate chip pancake from the pan just as Dean was about to move it from the pan to the plate. Dean swatted his hand away as he tried to take another one.
They finished up the interviews and knew exactly where the witch was so they broke down the door, shot them in the chest, and burned them.
“You will when I’m done with you.” Rowena said with a smirk,
After many hours of cuddling and kissing and talking, an easy silence fell upon them, only broken when Dean asked,
“Oh god I hope this goes well.”
“Sorry, I’m sorry, its just, its so cute!”
“Hey love.” Dean said groggily into the angels neck,
“And yet here you are.” Bal barely kept the snarl out of his voice so that he wouldn’t get the mom voice again,
“They’ll be at dinner, we can sneak in and get it.” Dean said starting up the car.
“How many times have we died?”
“Wedding?” Sam asked,
“Fine, easy salt and burn, met an interesting witch though.” Dean said throwing the bags on the table.
He exhaled and traced the heart then looked at cas,
“Thats why we’re here.”
“I love you so much Castiel.”
“We both know that’s a lie.” Dean said, Cas looked at him and tilted his head, only slightly offended,
“So you want to get everyone out of the house so that you can’t cas can ‘bone’”
Claire and kaia had rushed from Ohare Airport to the hotel to an Uber, who thankfully didnt care about the arsenal that was clinking around in kaia’s purse, to the Chicago police station. Claire had told jodi that this vacation would be a nice relaxing weekend that wouldn’t endanger anyone, but dean had gotten claire the fancy tickets(of course he spoils his kids a bit) and so she spent the entire time looking through police reports from news articles that looked promising. When she compiled the four cases that were there kaia then did some preliminary research so that she could force claire to go to a couple museums and see some sights on the case. The two of them had changed in the Uber and were standing just inside the station in crisp power suits, complete with combat boots, flashing their fake badges at a couple of policemen, they nodded and one led them into an office where they were met by a small man in sweatpants and a gym t-shirt,
“This is Rowena, she’s a witch.”
“We never got a proper honeymoon so I decided now is as good a time as ever.”
“You’ve never been this clingy, Dean, I’m turning you into something you're not.”
“They hunt half the things in here.” Gabriel answered tapping the bar and getting a ‘girly’ drink and a whiskey, he handed the whiskey to Rowena.
“You expect me to be stuck at home with this one,” he said jabbing his thumb in Sam’s direction, “for a few weeks?!”
“Ive been experimenting a bit, this is healthier, youll be surprised.”
“Good job dean.”
“Dean, somethings wrong here, you can't just be abandoned for months on end.”
“I would suffer a hundred deaths if I even got the chance to be with you again, at the end of the day, the week, the month, years even.”
“Wow.” Dean said, eyes wide, cas smiled and kissed his nose.
~~~~~
“I think so.”
“Hey!” Dean wriggled out of Cas’ grip and hip checked him. Sam rolled his eyes at the display and looked at Jack again,
“How many.” Cas asked concerned and serious,
“Oh my god, we need to get out of here.” Dean scrubbed a hand over his face.
“I’m sorry.”
“I dont know.”
“What happened to all the kids from the broken homes?”
“Cas?” Dean called out to a seemingly empty house, “cas?” He called again, this time cas walked down the stairs and around the corner with two swimsuits, a bottle of whiskey, hand cuffs, and a few pairs of flip flops.
“Nightmares? Restlessness? Mind preoccupied?” Cas said offering to take it all away so he could sleep,
“But you’re leaving me.”
“All red heads know each other.” Clary laughed and ordered a round of drinks.
“Of course I do.” Cas said seriously,
“What dean? Can I just go to bed?”
“Thank you.” Cas breathed into his shoulder. He knew he was shaking and probably quite filthy, as they had been running through a falling apart empty, but he didn’t care, Dean was here with him, Dean had gotten him out.
“You said you were going to come home.”
“Dean, we need to talk.”
He flipped to a page at the end of the notebook, it was blank but in the binding was a picture. It was a picture of him and Cas in their cowboy hats, leaning against one another, roughed up from the hunt, they were smiling. Dean looked at the picture again and noticed how their hands were so close, he noticed how hot Cas looked, he noticed how much time they’d wasted. Dean smiled at the picture as if he had lost the love of his life forever, he thought about the last movie him and Cas had watched about the wife who died of pneumonia. He felt a tear run down the side of his face and he blinked the rest of them away. He huffed a laugh and remembered that Cas wasn't dead, he was just on a work trip. He turned the picture over and written on the bottom were the words-
“No, dean its fine.”
“Cas? You;re home early.”
“Jack still needs his office decorated,” cas said seemingly changing the subject, a hurt look passed over deans features, “then you can come up and see them all. We will join them when our time comes and for now they’re happy, we’re happy, that’s what matters right?”
“Yeah whatever.” Eileen laughed as Dean glared at them both as he and Cas sat at the table. “Got a new job yet?”
“It’ll be fine, come on lets go talk to the mom.” She clapped her hands excitedly, “Oo its my favorite part.” She skipped to the Uber and Kaia flipped through the car rental website before pulling out one of Charlie’s old credit cards and punching in the numbers on her phone,
(See the end of the chapter for
“I love you Cas. I love you Cas. I love you Cas.” Until he had graduated to, practically screaming, “You left me! You left me and I don't know what to do! WHAT DO WE DO?!” He shouted at the room. After more tears, and some more screaming, he caught his breath and quietly said, “amen.”
“You don't want me Dean, I’m a mess, you deserve so much better.”
“What dean is trying to say is that I’m leaving for the week and he wants a weekend alone with me.”
“Bye Jodi! Love you all.” CAs said sincerely,
“Then what were you talking about?”
“Love you too.” Cas said disappearing. This time dean didnt cry, he didnt break things, he didnt even let the small smile creep off his lips, instead he busied around the slightly messy bedroom, picking up clothes and putting them in the hamper, he folded the basket of clean clothes he was too busy to fold, and ran around the room reorganizing.
Dean Winchester
“What?” Cas asked quietly,
“I love you too Dean.”
“Hey Jodi!” Cas said, masking his worry, she was still family,
They walk in as the girls are bickering about which movies to watch and greet the family that had arrived. Most of them were already there, but some weren’t so Dean and Cas got comfy on the couch. Dean cuddled on the couch against Cas, his head on Cas’ shoulder, knees in his lap. Jack had his head in Cas’ lap where Dean’s knees weren’t and sprawled out on the couch, feet curled under Sam’s legs. Sam and Dean were bickering about rom coms with Kaia and Claire who were sitting on the ground together. Jodi walked in and threw containers of popcorn at people and turned on the rom com the boys and Claire and Kaia were bickering about. A few in the group complained, but when it was over everyone was eager to watch another.
“I’m going to go finish making breakfast. I love you.” He calls over the noise of the running water. Dean walked into his bedroom and dried his hair as he picked out a pair of patterned sweats.
Dean had been sleeping for 12 hours straight and even with so many thoughts, cas got bored so he grabbed the pen from the bedside table and started to draw on himself. He drew a henna like design that went from the back of his hand to halfway down his forearm. He felt dean stir and wake up so he quickly miracled it away, knowing it was only a matter of time before dean noticed.
“Hey Dean!” Sam shouted, “Dean, I told you not to interfere.”
“Don't sleep.”
“We both know that’s a lie.” Cas said rolling his eyes. When Dean didn’t respond Cas stayed quiet.
“Garth can't go to purgatory,”
It’d been weeks and cas still had his habit of drawing on himself but he usually remembered to miracle it away in the hopes that dean didn’t notice, but most of the time he did. Sam walked into deans room, the door was open, and found dean staring down at his arm watching as a lacy heart was drawn on his palm, he picked up a sharpie and drew a very small heart on the tip on his thumb and smiled,
“Mhm.”
“That's a good point, Garth and Bess are going to purgatory, that's not fair.” Dean said as he walked in from the kitchen, “We can talk to jack about it tomorrow.”
“Okay, time to hit the hay. You gonna work on that puzzle from the back of the box of cereal?” Jack nodded and slid across the floor and pushed himself up to standing with the wall, he laughed at the looks his family was giving him.
“Move, I’m not sleeping on the couch.”
“God this is going to be a long three weeks.” Eileen said quietly,
“I told you not to interfere.”
Ps. Here’s the update just if anyone’s wondering, and yes this seems to be in letter form and no I dont apologize
“I SaUNTered VAUgley DowNWARDs!” Crowley shouted as he and eileen walked back to them arm in arm, Sam raised an eyebrow,
“Hi.” Cas said fondly
“Hm?” Jack had spread the files out to better organize them,
“4 more hours, its just four more hours.” Eileen said running her fingers over his knee,
“Can you guys all leave for the weekend? Please?”
“One more day of libraries and interviews, I swear, it will be over before you know it.”
“We need to get up,” he said glancing at the clock, “Sam and eileen will be awake by now.” He got up groaning and complaining about his knees and how old he’d gotten as Cas stared, not moving, “Come on, up!” Dean laughed as he made his way to the bathroom.
“Need help?” He asked gruffly. The red head women glared at him before getting ushered away by her boyfreind?husband? Crowley didnt want to find out. He shook his head and instead of going to the brothel as he had planned he turned into a quaint little flower shop.
On thier first wedding anniversary, cas and the family arranged a surprise for dean. He walked into the house and found suitcases packed, copious amounts of sunblock on the counter and more than one floppy sun hat.
“You know what Cas, no, this isn't how it's going to work. We just figured everything out and now you’re gone. You said you’d be home a week ago, you said you’d come back, you said you wouldn’t leave me.” Dean choked out, tears falling freely now.
“We’re leaving on Thursday.”
“Whipped.” Simon said in a singsong voice after him. Rowena took a deep breath before turning back to the three young adults,
“Heaven and hell?”
“I didn’t!” Dean said indignantly then at Sam’s look, “Okay fine, I broke the empty, but you helped!” Sam rolled his eyes and said,
“He’s right, I do love you.”
“I checked it, it’s legit. Donna, Claire, and I went to check it out, seemed like werewolves, luring people out into the woods. Thats normal but with this winter the vics were dying of hypothermia, seemed like something was storing it-“
“Why?”  Dean quickly filled him in,
“While niether can you.” Aziraphale quipped back,
“You okay?”
“Will you-um-uh”
“It says that Jack is going to hear a lot of this conversation.” Gabriel answered with a shit eating grin, rowena smacked his arm and then took back her whiskey glass and sat down.
“Foul.”
“We don’t, but this-right now we all get to be together, even if its fleeting.”
“Dean.” Cas said plaeadingly
Ellen Harvelle
“How long do you think you’ll be gone?” Dean asked Jack who was lying on the floor twirling a pencil in the air with his grace.
“I love it when you call me husband.” Cas said smiling. He went and opened the door, even though it was already unlocked.
“K, then what's the process?”
“I don't care, I haven't been here to kiss you or wake you up or anything, for four weeks.” Dean smiled and pressed a kiss to his forehead,
When they had finally settled around the map table, Jack was at the head, Cas next to him, next to Cas was Dean who fidgeted in his seat and couldn't decide if he was too close or too far away from Cas. On the other side of Jack was rowena, and the rest of the family filled in where they could fit.
“Hello Dean.”
“Where to first?” Bal asked, meg dragged him to a coffee shop she noticed and he followed behind her like a lovesick puppy.
“Why?”
Sam was dean’s next victim. He pulled his brother into the kitchen and started pacing. The party was winding down, the family retreated to their rooms and sam had been ‘resting his eyes’ with his head in Eileen’s lap.
glad that you’re back.” She pulled Castiel into a hug, wrapping her arms tightly around his shoulders.
Castiel kissed Dean’s cheek. “What are you looking at?” He reached down and took one of the honey cookies, shoving most of it in his mouth at once. Dean made a disgusted face before putting his hand on Castiel’s shoulder and rubbing at it gently.
A feeling of warmth rushed through Castiel’s body, and he couldn’t help but smile as he leaned in and gave Dean another kiss before pushing Dean down gently, slouching down next to him and adjusting their positions so that Dean was on his back and Castiel was resting against his chest. “Are you sure it’s safe for us to nap here?” Castiel asked, yawning as his own wave of fatigue washed over him. He let out a content noise as Dean dropped a kiss against the top of his head.
Castiel glanced down at Dean’s lips again, his voice coming out breathy. “On what?”
Castiel froze for several seconds before patting her on the back. “I’m, uh, glad that I’m back, too, Claire.” He looked over her shoulder at Dean. “I’m more glad than you know.” He gave Dean a tight smile.
“I mean you were supposed to—wait, what?” Dean jumped, looking at Castiel. “But, Billie . . . ”
Dean had spent the rest of the night perched on his desk, his eyes locked on Castiel. He kept track of his breaths and the way that he moved, desperately praying that this wasn’t some sort of dream or hallucination. He wouldn’t be able to survive if this wasn’t real.
Dean ignored the way Sam’s brows furrowed at him as he grabbed the spices he needed for the turkey skin. Cass
much.” He kissed him again, letting out a gentle laugh when he felt how much Dan’s hands were trembling when he pressed them against Castiel’s back. “Are you cold, Dean?”
Dean’s stomach tightened as he glanced at Cas, tightening his grip on the food containers. “You look great, Cas,” he said softly, swallowing when one of Castiel’s curls decided to flip up. He resisted the urge to reach out and fix it, quickening his steps so that they would reach the prime picnic spot quicker. Relaxing with Castiel and sharing a meal with him had always been one of his favorite things to do, but Dean had known for weeks that this was going to be the day that he admitted what he really felt, so he was more than just a little bit anxious to get through the meal and see what Castiel had to say.
am having Thanksgiving with our family because you,
Dean moved up to his knees and pulled Castiel’s hands onto his lap. “I’m serious, Cas. If this isn’t a dream and it isn’t because of Billie that you’re back . . .please, Cas. I don’t want to waste anymore time. I love you, and if you love me . . . fuck, Cas, I’ve wanted you basically since I met you, and I want to spend the rest of my life with you. It doesn’t have to be a big thing, hell, we can get Sam to forge some documents so make it legal the night that Jack and he get home, I don’t care. Please.”
“Get some sleep, Cas, and I’ll be here when you wake up,” Dean promised, running his fingers up and down Castiel’s right bicep. “I’ll be here forever. You’re . . . you’re it for me, Cas. I know that might sound scary, but . . . ” he trailed off shaking his head. He lifted the arm that had been over Castiel and used it as a pillow. “I love you.”
“Well um, don’t you think he would be better staying here?” Cas asked
Garth starting leading Castiel to his room, once again reminding him of the rules. No sudden movements, no sudden sounds.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The man was not a doctor or a nurse, he wore a trench coat, and gave Dean things. Books and puzzles.
He smelled fire all of a sudden and heard gun power. He saw some of the other Omegas try to press their ears to the vents, some starting pacing and or curling up on the floor clearly terrified of what was going on.
He must have not been following directions, he would have to be better, show the older man that he was good, he would follow orders, no one needed to drug him, needed to hurt him. He was very good.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(See the end of the chapter for
The older man stuck something in his arm, of course he thought, drugs,. Whenever Dean wouldn't follow  Alastair willingly he just drugged him.
“Well here is the thing, no family equals no insurance so the hospitals going to kick him out as soon as possible  and Clearview is full of pro bono cases, so the next option is a foster situation, I was kinda hoping that’s where you would come in,” Jody said
He wasn’t expecting the loud banging, or the yelling, or how the normal smell of distress and scared omega increased tenfold. He didn’t know what happened but all of a sudden there was a lot of movement and a lot of screaming. Not just from the omegas who were with him but some of the Alphas at the compound he could hear them upstairs.
Castiel still couldn't tell if the man was just perpetually angry or if that was simply his voice.
He composed himself not wanting Dean to see him falter.
“Alright Dean, you are under strict rest orders, so your only job is to go back to sleep is it okay of Castiel comes back tomorrow,” Garth  asked
Dean saw sunlight before he saw the men and women all in the same brown clothing come downstairs, he heard a man yell “clear, just victims”
A nod
Outside? What did Jody mean? He took a look around the house making sure it was at least semi-presentable and did what any reasonable 30 something-year-old alpha male would when someone informs them they are coming over in the middle of the night...make tea. He had just starting seeping the tea bags when he heard the knock. “Hey, Cas it’s me” he heard the Sheriff say. He opened the door and surveyed the situation before him, Jody still in her uniform a layer of sweat clinging to her forehead, if Castiel hadn’t seen her car he would’ve assumed she ran here. He ushered her in and closed the door behind, starting to get a little bit nervous.
“I know that can be an unpleasant feeling,” Cas said “Do you want to try a few bites we can go slow”
“ That’s unfortunate that no family was found, but Clearview is great I mean Ellen and her team do incredible things”
“Oh now listen here you know that not what I was sayi..”
“Cas relax the girls and Donna are fine,” said Jody
Castiel gave a small smile and promised Garth he would not do anything to hurt Dean. Garth then ran  through a list of what he called security questions
Dean nodded
“Thank…” Dean tried to thank the man, but he was thrust into having a coughing fit. He had this cough for a few weeks, Garth told him he had a chest infection.    Dean tried to sit up to get the water on the bed side table, but between the coughing and the chills he couldn't make it. Cas must have seen the struggle, because he immediately sprang into action, pouring the water from the pink plastic pitcher into the cup close by.
“C-Cas? Is it really you?” Dean choked out, his heart skipping beats. He struggled to sit up, his hands trembling and his eyes wide.
Castiel tilted his head, looking even more confused. “What are you talking about? Of course it’s me, Dean, who else would I be? This isn’t just a vessel anymore, remember? Jimmy’s long gone, and I swear that I’m not possessed.” He reached over and grabbed the bottle of Holy Water hanging on the hook next to Dena’s door. He pulled out the stopper and dabbed a bit on his wrist. “See? Not possessed.”
Dean’s heart especially broke forty minutes into the last hour. Castiel and he were lying in Dean’s bed. Castiel had fallen asleep more than an hour earlier, but Dean couldn’t sleep, propping himself up on his forearm and watching the fallen angel, lightly running his fingers over Castiel’s hair and face as the tears began to fall again. “I love you so much,” he whispered, dropping down onto his side and pulling Castiel to his chest, dropping kisses all over his nose, forehead, and hairline.
“You love me . . . like a brother.” Cass sighed. “When I said that I love you, Dean, I meant that I
Dean lifted his head and looked Castiel in the eyes. “I’m in love with you, Cas. I’ve loved you for longer than I can remember.”
“Are you okay?”
Castiel's nostrils flared. "An 'excuse'? Dean, I sacrificed my happiness to a shapeless being, and then when we found a loophole, I sacrificed my entire /being/ for our family. You were going to sacrifice yourself to stop Michael. You /did/ sacrifice yourself to stop Lucifer. How was my decision any worse, today or back then?"
Dean’s eyes shot open at the words, and he stopped breathing when he saw Castiel standing in the doorway with a cup of water and a half-eaten peanut butter and jelly sandwich. His brows were furrowed and Dean’s sweatpants were hanging low on his hips, his bare feet shuffling as he stepped onto the chilly wood of Dean’s floor.
Castiel nodded. Dean gave him a small smile and reached down to grab his hand, interlacing their fingers and pulling Castiel the rest of the way into the bunker. As they walked down the hallway to the bathroom, however, Dean began to feel self-conscious. He wanted to shower with Castiel, both because he didn’t want to be away from him and he needed to make sure that there wasn’t any injuries that would make the end of the day come any sooner, but he knew that Castiel would
The men held each other in silence for several minutes until Castiel pulled back and cupped Dean's face in his hands. "I love you, Dean. I'm sorry for scaring you today. I promise to be more careful in the future." He kissed him softly.
Everything came to a head, especially, on a Thursday afternoon after the boys (plus Sam and Jack) had gotten back from a hunt. It was far from Castiel's first hunt as a human, but there was something different about this one. He had managed to get knocked unconscious by the monster, and had fallen off the edge of a dock into the muddy lake below.
“Bitch.”
Castiel nodded again, silently eating his eggs. Once he had eaten more than half of them, he lowered his plate and pursed his lips, tilting his head. “There’s something you aren’t telling me.”
Castiel noticed Dean’s look, and bite his lip in shame. “I . . . well, I appear to be human again, Dean. I was—”
Part of Dean was still worried that Castiel would disappear on him, but if Castiel was willing to make this relationship work, then Dean was going to fight to the very end to protect him and their relationship. Monsters didn’t stand a chance, and Dean couldn’t have been happier.
Dean’s smile grew. “Of course you can. Baby, you can have whatever you want.”
Castiel, however, didn’t seem to care as he stepped into the bathroom, allowing Dean to undress him before helping Dean out of his clothes. “You’re beautiful, Dean,” he whispered, swallowing thickly before allowing Dean to pull him into the shower.
“But that means . . . ” Dean’s eyes widened. “Cas . . . are you back for good? Like . . . you aren’t dying again?”
“Hello, Dean,” Castiel whispered, lifting his arms and hugging Dean back. He seemed to be crying, as well, the spot where his face was pressed into Dean’s shoulder dampening more and more with every second that ticked by. “I missed you.”
“Try me.” Castiel pressed another kiss against his skin. Dean hesitated before turning around, moving so that
Dean clenched his jaw and put moved the pan of bacon off the heat. “You aren’t going to like it.”
“Okay.” He tried to pull his hand away again, just in case, but Dean wouldn’t let him. He wrapped his other hand around the back of Castiel’s hand and lifted it up to his mouth, pressing a gentle kiss to his knuckles.
Castiel’s eyes widened. “My . . .
Dean’s eyes shot open, and he jumped off the bed, suddenly completely awake. He shoved his phone into his pocket and ran out of his bedroom, desperately praying that Billie had sent Castiel back
Sam pushed himself away from the counter and went over to the stove, grabbing a spoon out of one of the drawers and following his brother’s instructions. “Where is Cass, anyway? I haven’t seen him all day.”
As the day dwindled on, Dean did as many of the things he had dreamed of as he could do without leaving Lebanon. He took Castiel out for lunch, he took him to feed the ducks at a local park, he made them dinner, he went down on him in the library (Castiel had always been stunning when he was wrapped in with research—the face he made when Dean surrounded him like the books surrounded them was far more than Castiel could have ever imaged), he held him as they watched old Western movies . . . it was perfect.
Dean raised his eyebrows, “There’s still monsters out there, but a proper home does sound nice. Somewhere with a yard for the dog to run around, two and a half bedrooms, somewhere where Cas can learn to human properly and I can fix cars in the backyard. A room for Jack, if he wants it.”
for a human… well it was unheard of - until me. I don’t blame you for being blindsided by my confession.”
. Dean cursed himself every second since that fateful moment, he had blue screened for a moment, unsure or
“How?” Dean’s lips moved against Cas’ neck.
Dean hadn’t moved, he’d lost track of time since the Empty has appeared and pulled Cas out from in front of him. His phone had rung, Sam had lost interest in being ignored and returned to find Dean against the wall in the kitchen, surrounded by empty beer bottles. He’d been mad to start with, for being ignored and forgotten but when he’d finally stopped mono logging and actually
“Got one for me?” Sam startled him, Dean was lost in his own head but he smiled softly and held out an unopened bottle. “So it’s nice, ha? Having them home.”
to say how he felt in return because he simply hadn’t
“Dean.” Cas’ voice was rough as he reached out and placed a hand on Dean’s plaid sleeve. “It’s okay to be nervous.”
“Cas,” Dean dropped back down into his seat and rubbed a hand over his face. “That’s not what I meant, I don’t have a problem with you being a man, I just have never
Dean hadn’t known he could hurt so much. Cas’ had ‘died’ before, he’d mourned Cas a plethora of times before now but none had felt quite so real, quite so
His grief was almost palatable, it reached around him and caressed him, gripping him so tightly around the chest that he could barely breathe. His bottle slipped from his hand and into the dirt as he dropped his head into his hands and honest to god prayed.
A small smile touched the corners of the angel’s lips, “Yes Dean.”
Dean could feel Cas’ hard line of arousal against his own and pressed his hips down looking for friction, the noise Cas’ made at the contact sent a thrill right down into Dean’s throbbing cock. Dean reached a hand between them, grunting in effort and tried to work Cas’ belt open with one hand, frustrated at his lack of results he gave up and just shoved his hand down the front of Cas’ pants and his world fell away when there was nothing but Cas’ hot cock under his hand. He’d never wondered what Cas wore under his pants but now he’d never forget that little detail.
with a man before.” Cas wore that clueless look again and a blush spread along Dean’s cheeks and onto his ears as he said, “You know, like sexy times.”
Sam smiled a knowing smile, Dean hadn’t spoken to Sam about Cas’ confession, nor had either of them mentioned the kiss or their declaration of love in the field. It was so tender and new and they just wanted to keep it for themselves for a while longer but Sam’s smile said he knew.
“Cas, you stupid son of a bitch, how could you do this to us? To
Dean had spiraled again when Sam had walked into the room and told him the news. With Chuck out of the picture, Dean had snarled at Sam like a wild animal that Cas would be now stuck in the Empty for good, that without Chuck, there was no hope. Sam had raised his eyebrows and his hands and backed out of the room as his brother picked up the half empty whiskey bottle and brought it to his lips.
It was four weeks from the night Cas was taken from him, Jack and Sam had concocted a plan without him to off God/Chuck. Dean was still elbow deep in whiskey and grief, he had barely spoken to anyone so they had worked around him and their plan had worked. Dean hadn’t been present when they had taken care of him, he hadn’t been present in the lead up nor the execution, Sam and Jack had carried it out on their own, without a hitch.
He watched Castiel fix a mug of hot chocolate and sit down at the table, his nose red and chills still wracking his body from where he had been sucked under the braccish water. He let Castiel take a long sip and express a satisfied sigh before biting out the words that had been bouncing around his skull ever since he saw the grey-blue twinge that Castiel's skin had taken on.
Sure, he came back after a day or so, but Dean was
After a few more soft kisses, Dean pulled back and scanned his eyes over Castiel’s body, taking stock in how he looked. He was filthy, from the dirt that covered his skin down to the bloodstains that dotted his trench coat. Dean furrowed his brows in confusion. Why would Billie return Castiel in such a state?
Castiel’s stomach plummeted, and he rocked back onto his tail bone before removing his hand from Dean’s. Dean looked hurt for a moment before he looked down at his food, clearing his throat.
“Dean, I don’t know what you think happened, but Billie didn’t bring me back. I woke up in the Empty and that caused a God, or Spirit, or
Dean clicked his tongue. “Already called them. Claire is bringing apple pie. Besides, if they want to sleep, fine. God and an angel--they deserve all the rest they can get.” He grabbed another handful of stuffing before nodding at the stove. “Stir the carrots, would ya?”
“I heard you weren’t feeling too good, I’m sorry to hear that,” Cas took another step toward Dean,
(See the end of the chapter for
“Okay.” Dean almost fell again just out of surprise, he shouldn’t be on angel radio, Chuck shouldn’t be able to speak back to him.
“I love you.”
“What?! No, you didn't, it's okay man. I just missed you that's all.” Cas looked at him and had to pull himself from the brink of losing himself in the emerald green eyes. He thought over when he’d done to Dean through the years, what he was doing to him now,
“Yes of course the group of youngins from Toronto, oh they didn’t notice that love was staring them in the face. They were such sweet young things, too bad they died, though i had nothing to do with it, they weren’t even my first test subjects.”
“what is happening here?” He whispered into the empty room. Cas covered up the writing again and mentally sorted through the case again. The writing, the couples, the deaths, was it a witch or was it something worse? Better? For now dean was asleep and would be asleep for the next few hours, best not to bother him.
“Okay okay, the road, road, could you watch the road!” Horns honked around them as dean got back control of the car, god, not only would they kill him with the bickering and the usual tension, along with the new annoyeces but now he’d be run into a telephone pole by them, he thought. He continued to get snippets of information about thier case interspersed through bickering, and after a painstaking car ride they ended up at the bar, finally they were investigating the case, maybe not like normal, maybe with more snide comments, but i guess some sense of normalcy.
“Who were your firsts?”
“Dean you can't kill me.”
“The Family Archives?”
“Continue.” He said raising his hands,
“You doing all right?”
“Its fine Jodi, I’ll put together a group, we’ll be there in a few hours.” Sam said already writing down a list of people he could call for backup,
“I had to deal with years of you and Cas.”
“Dont you dare break up with him and ruin my weekend!” Sam said with a playful smile as he walked out of the kitchen, leaving dean alone with his thoughts. This will be a good week, they said.
“Why did you do it? You owe me that much man.” Dean said almost pleading,
“Nope.” Gabriel said smoothly, ignoring the blush creeping onto his cheeks,
“NO!”
“Are you drunk?” Samandriel asked, cutting him off.
“I guess this would benefit all of us. Man, are you sure youre okay without him for a week?”
“You really like her dont you?”
“I AM! YOU MAKE ME THIS WAY!” Gabriel yelled as he stomped off to the room he was put in last time he was there.
The rest of that day, they spent relaxing and recouping from the hunt. It was one of their last days together so Sam and Eileen left Dean and Cas alone. They of course preferred to stay in Deans-their room.
“I bought you a book and you didnt even read it!” Simon said affronted,
“I love you too dean.” They said it as if it was as normal as anything else they’d said to each other. Dean pulled Cas closer and wrapper both arms around him as he placed his chin in Cas’ hair.
“Just seemed like a splendid idea to have a huge party, invite all our friends, Anathema, Newton, Adam and the Them, and the lot.” Aziraphale answered scooting over in his chair so that Crowley could curl around him,
“Hm, yeah, you know, did you ever think that you may have completely DESTROYED AN ENTIRE REALM FULL OF ANGELS AND DEMONS!” He shouted,
“Sorry.” Kaia squeaked out.
Crowley munched on a shortbread cookie as he walked along the cliff side, the waves crashed against the cliff face below. He looked out at the water, teh way it glistened ever so slightly, the way the green fields on the cliffs looked like they melted into the horizon, he rummaged through one of his shopping bags for another shortbread. He remembered what he had told the little old woman at the shop when she asked if the shortbreads and the little gifts were for his kids,
“You have, multiple times in fact.” Cas said slightly amused, Dean just grumbled and pulled harder on his hand. “Never expected you to be such a cuddler.”
“Then, yes, of course, I’ll marry you.” Cas said, pulling dean into a breathtaking kiss, he tasted like strawberries and chocolate.
“Goodnight, love you.”
“Hey honey, I’m taking you on a vacation.” Cas said stuffing the items into an opened bag,
“Youre going to be my nephew!” Samandriel said quietly but still slightly excited. He flinched at the smack that never came. “Wow you really are off your game.”
“How exactly did you get them all together?”
“You love chick flicks.”
“Thank you sweetheart, so are you, flannel and my sweatpants.” Dean laughed “It suits you.” Dean wrapped his arms around his boyfriend who was indeed wearing deans red plaid button up and his LOTR sweatpants. He kissed him once and then went to the pantry to get out ingredients.
“Its tepid.” Sam made a face at the lukewarm coffee.
I told you I’d tell you why I want to wrap this up so here goes.
“And yet we were able to handle it on our own!”
Everyone was gathered in the war room within 40 minutes and were eating pizza and talking, Jodi and the girls had joined them via FaceTime. Dean wandered away to his room to pack and noticing this, sam followed shortly after.
“Oh cas! Give dean a kiss for me will you?” Jodi said with a small chuckle, cas felt his face go red and looked away from the brothers, dean glaring at sam and the phone, and sam watching cas with a smile.
“Purgatory?”
“Well so far it seems to go away after the two confront their feelings.” She said wigging her eyebrows at dean, who didn’t notice anything amis, because maybe he might like her cookies better than pie, god is that sacrilege?!
“promise?”
- yours truly,
“I dont get it, every couple that died came to you.”
“You want to watch a movie or something?” Dean asked, grabbing the remote to one of the many tvs that were put in the bunker.
“Nope, I took them out, they are asleep in there.” Jack responded to Cas’ worried expression with, “It’s just their souls, they will only remember sleeping for the night, no harm no chicken right?” A small smile played on Cas’ face.
and not somewhere that would require a several hour drive. If Billie was telling the truth then Dean had to make every second count.
Castiel jolted, and this time, he was able to pull out of Dean’s grip. His eyes widened, and his jaw dropped. “You did
For several terrifying, heart-stopping minutes, it seemed like the boys were too late, but then Castiel rolled over to his side and began coughing violently, disloging the liquid from his lungs and filling them back up with air. Dean had fought the urge to pull the other man to his chest and beg him never to do that again, but he fought it, keeping silent until they had reached the bunker.
“Dean?”
Castiel let out a whimper when Dean clipped a curb, tipping the bike until it was nearly parallel with the road. Dean moved his hand to hold on to Castiel’s knee encouragingly. “We’re almost there, Cas. I’m getting off at the next exit. You’ll be fine on side-streets, right? No more panicking?”
Castiel barely returned the sentiment before he was fast asleep.
Dean raced through the bunker towards the door, his heart pounding and his mouth going dry. “Please be close, please be close, please be close,” he murmured, sliding the last few feet in his socks and bending down to grab his shoes from next to the door. He started to slide his feet into them as he yanked open the door.
, Dean reminded himself, the butterflies in his stomach exploding as he reached down into the saddlebag and pulled out all of Castiel’s favorites for lunch: PB&J sandwiches, nacho-cheese Doritos, and German honey cookies that he had made from scratch. He had gotten an assortment of sodas at the grocery store (Castiel’s favorite flavor seemed to vary by the minute) and had even thrown in a few different types of dollar-candies that he had found on their Wendigo hunt in South Dakota a few weeks back.
"You know, man, you'd think after over ten years on this Chuck-forsaken planet you wouldnt be so stupid when it came to being a human."
Before Dean even realized what he was doing, he had spun Castiel around so that his back was against the counter that Dean had been leaning against, and everything he had fought so hard to keep locked behind his anger came spilling out. "I thought you were dead, Cas!" he exclaimed, pressing forward and using his body to hold him in place. "You weren't waking up! We were doing compressions, and giving you air, and you didn't have a pulse! You were gray, and your body was cold, and I can't lose you, Cas, not like that!"
Dean sat down on the Baby’s hood and crossed his forearms over his knees, letting out a loud sigh and looking down at the ground. He lifted a hand and pressed it against the bridge of his nose, closing his eyes and squeezing in an effort to keep the stinging in his eyes at bay.
"Yeah, okay. Because that makes everything just fine and dandy, doesn't it? News flash, Cas, but just because Jack sees you, me, and Sam as some sort of weird incestual father unit doesnt make it true. You know as well as I do that that was just an excuse."
Dean rubbed his face again and rolled over so that he was facing the wall. He clenched his teeth and closed his eyes, thankful that all the sleepless nights he had had since that night seemed to be catching up with him, and he felt himself falling asleep within moments.
Dean had insisted, tapping Castiel gently on the shoulder before reaching down and grabbing his wrist, dragging him over to the bike.
Dean spread his fingers apart and let out a long breath through his nose. “Just . . . come inside when you’re ready, all right? I’m going to go start putting leftovers away. It won’t be as good as it was fresh, but . . . at least you’ll have something to snack on if you get tired in the middle of the night. I made almost a dozen dishes so you can try some of everything.” He took the bag from Castiel. “Thanks for the pie.”
Dean crossed his arms over his chest and blew out a heavy breath through his nose. "Before, I knew you always had my back during a hunt, but now? Cas, I told you to stay where I could see you. Sam and I can't do shit to protect you of you insist on letting every son-of-a-bitch get the jump on you." He shook his head, chuckling dryly. "Hell, you can't even cook a simple meal without burning yourself. Don't know why Sam was so insistent that you keep hunting with us. Clearly you aren't ready."
Dean looked down at the his hand, staring at the oozing mass for a moment before putting it down on the blanket and using a napkin to clean his hand. He gripped Castiel’s hand tightly, grabbing one of the sodas and taking a long gulp before turning back to Castiel. “Uhm, Cas . . . I need to talk to you about something.”
Dean shook his head. “I just didn’t want to go,” he lied, grabbing a plate from the cabinet and sliding the eggs onto it. He grabbed a couple of forks from the drawer and held the plate out to Castiel, taking a bite before letting the other man eat the rest. He moved on to making bacon, the sizzling sound of the grease leaking from the meat making Dean’s mouth water. “The bacon will be ready in a few minutes.”
what he thought of him. Jack became so emotional that he managed to make almost every light in the bunker explode, so Dean grabbed his gun and his keys and took off for the city, stopping by the hardware store to get new bulbs before making his way to a motel for the night.
was leaning against the counter and Castiel was pressed against his chest.
Castiel’s cheeks went up in flames, and all the moisture rushed from Castiel’s mouth when Dean scooted closer towards him. He leaned in slightly, desperately hoping that the kisses Dean was placing on his knuckles was an indication of what Dean wanted. The closer that they moved together, the more desperate Castiel was to kiss him.
Dean choked on his beer and looked past Claire, where he could see Castiel walking toward them, a white plastic bag in his left hand. Claire scoffed and stood up. She walked over to Castiel and stared at him for a moment before throwing her hand out and slapping him across the face, her smirk growing when she saw Castiel’s eyes go wide in shock and the bag fall from his hand. “That’s for not telling me you were back . . . or that you had even died in the first fucking place.”
Dean didn’t answer, letting out an irritated breath through his nose. “I’m not his keeper, Sammy. Dude can go wherever he wants, whenever he wants.” He pushed the last handful of bread in and straightened up, taking off the glove. “He knows dinner is at eight. He’ll be here.”
Dean shook his head, moving to place a few kisses on the hollow of Castiel’s neck. “I’m just happy, sunshine. I’m so, so happy.” He let out a breath, shaking his head. “I had hoped that you loved me back, but I couldn’t be certain.” He sat up fully and glanced at the food around them, suddenly feeling exhausted as the great weight of his feelings fell off his shoulders.
Dean had known for quite some time that there was something more than friendship between Castiel and him, but it wasn’t until he watched the grace burst out of Castiel’s vessel that he realized just how deep his feelings ran. He had been completely heart-broken, unable to eat, sleep, or go on hunts for the solid month in between the end of Castiel’s life and when he came back. He left Sam alone to take care of Jack, and no matter how much Jack tried to prove his innocence and his kindness to Dean (Dean could specifically remember a time when Sam went out for a quick salt-and-burn and left Jack at the bunker, and Jack had tried to make Dean dinner to “cheer him up”), he couldn’t help but hate the boy. Every time he looked at him he saw the outline of Castiel’s wings all along the ground, the way that his body had gone up in smoke on the pyre—it made his chest ache and broke his heart more and more.
“I know, Cass. Me, too.”
After several seconds, Castiel pulled away, resting his forehead against Dean’s. “I’m sorry I missed dinner, Dean. I started imagining spending it with you, like this, and I just couldn’t do it. I couldn’t pretend around our family and our son that I don’t love you.”
Now Castiel’s eyes were widening. “What?”
Castiel froze and stared at the mug in his hands for a moment before looking up at Dean, his bright-blue eyes wide and filled with hurt. "What?"
He leaned forward in his seat, moving his hands up to the top of the steering wheel and dropping his head onto his wrists. He breathed in his nose and out his mouth, trying to keep the tears pressing against the back of his eyes at bay, just as he had done every night since that night. Crying hadn’t done anything to help his grief in the past, and it sure as hell wouldn’t change anything for the future. He had to suck it up and get over it.
Now Dean was the one looking confused. “Why would you being around be uncomfortable? Cass, I love you. I want you here.”
Castiel cleared his throat, his voice coming out in a squeak. “I’m fine,” he said again, gritting his teeth and preparing himself for the descending exit ramp. Flying down the freeway was terrifying, but seeing how the nose of the bike raced towards the base shook him down to his very bones.
Castiel smirked. “Was that your true intention for dragging me out there? I thought it was just another ‘human experience’,” he teased, humming when Dean reached around him and grabbed another blanket out of his pack. He threw it over their bodies and adjusted their position until they were both comfortable.
Dean kept his hand on Castiel’s knee the entire way down. He let go as he turned on the main road. Castiel took a few deep breaths and tried to calm himself down, hesitating before resting his forehead against Dean’s shoulder and wrapping his arms around Dean’s waist, resting his interlaced fingers against Dean’s stomach. As he breathed in through his nose, he was overwhelmed with the strong smell of wood and of Dean’s cologne. His heart began to race again, only this time, it was for an entirely different reason.
“And the turkey? Can I have some of that?”
, decided that you needed to bow out.” He looked over. “I don’t get it, Cass. Before the Empty took you, you told me you love me, then you get back, and its like you want nothing to do with me.” He scoffed. “Do you realize this is the first time we’ve been alone since the night the Empty took you? I thought, when you came back, that--you know what, it doesn’t matter. You made your stance on all of this plenty clear.”
“Oh.” Cass’s eyes widened. “
Dean shook his head and pulled himself back to the present, glancing up at Castiel, who was looking at him with concern. During Dean’s daydream, he managed to get everything spread out on the blanket and had pulled Castiel down next to him, their fingers still interlaced as they began to pick at their food.
“Sorry Cass is a dick.”
Dean turned down the road that led into the park and slid into a spot, stopping the bike and fiddling with the keys until he felt Castiel untangle himself from around Dean’s body. He immediately felt cold and longed to be held again, the teasing ghost of Castiel’s hands zapping the warmth away. Regardless, even just a few seconds of being close to Castiel was worth more than anything.
Dean woke up to his phone vibrating so hard that it was shaking the entire bed. He groaned and grabbed it from next to his feet, jabbing his fingers at it until it answered the call. He lifted it to his ear and sat up slowly, reaching over and pausing the still-playing cassette. “What is it?”
Castiel's eyes widened before he clenched his teeth and broadened his jaw. "I'm not a 'baby in a trenchcoat', Dean," he said, reminding Dean of one of the many awful things he had said the last time that Castiel was human. "I may be human now, but I've spent centuries being an Angel of the Lord. I am more than capable of taking care of myself."
“I annoyed an ancient cosmic being so much that he sent me back.”
coming back.
“What?”
Dean sighed and rubbed his eyes. “What are we doing, Cass?”
Castiel tilted his head to the side. “What do you mean? We’re having Thanksgiving with our family.”
This time it was Castiel who spun them around, effectively silencing Dean as he pressed against him and kissed him. He wrapped his hands around the back of his neck and held him close, chasing after his lips when Dean broke away and pressed their foreheads together. Dean let out a shaky breath and pulled Castiel into a tight hug, pressing kisses against his neck as he simply breathed in Castiel's scent.
Now Castiel looked confused. “Dean, Billie’s dead. I killed her, remember? To save you, and Sam, and Mary.”
“Shit, Dean, did you
to awaken, as well. I refused to go back to sleep and kept pestering him until he sent me back so some field a ways away from here—it took me over two week to get back to you, but I did it. I did it on my own, Dean. Billie had nothing to do with it.”
He couldn’t have asked for more.
Castiel didn’t look away from Dean as he nodded. “We will be inside soon.”
Dean hated to admit it, but he missed Cas, even if he was right there. Ever since Castiel had given up his grace, there was something about him that made Dean constantly feel like a failure and like his was letting down the person who meant the most in his life. Unforunately, like it so often did in his life, that fear came out as frustration and anger.
Dean shook his head. “No. She came back as the new Death—kill a reaper and they move up the totem pole. When I was in the veil, and she asked me what I wanted. I asked for twenty-four more hours with you. Didn’t you see her when she brought you back?”
For just a moment, Dean could see the same angel that he had fallen so desperately in love with so many years ago. Castiel’s eyes were aglow in anger, and the glare he had fixed on Dean was intimidating enough that Dean couldn’t help but cower, his heart hurting at the realization that he very possibly could have messed up his last chance to be happy with Castiel. He didn’t know what he would do if his admission made him lose his last twenty-one hours with the fallen angel.
The hurt in Castiel's eyes turned to anger and he stood up, taking another long drink of his hot chocolate before putting if back down on the table. "You're one to talk about taking care of yourself, Dean. Do you realize how many times you would have drank yourself to death if I hadn't interviened?" He met Dean's eyes for a moment before looking away. "I saw an opportunity, and I took it. It was an unsuccessful risk, but I had to try."
"Yeah, okay. Because your plans have worked out so well in the past. What about when you stole the colt, hmm? Or you offered yourself up to the Empty?"
At least when he was sleeping, he could be with Castiel in his dreams.
Fortunately, it seemed that no matter how angry Castiel was, he wasn’t going anywhere. He maneuvered their positions on the bed until they were sitting side by side. He linked their fingers, using both of his hands to wrap around one of Dean’s. “Start from the beginning. What happened?”
“You were never on a silver platter, Dean. That would be greatly uncomfortable, especially with how cold the bunker gets. You would feel the cold, even through your jeans.”
Dean glanced up at his brother and rolled his eyes before snapping his glove. “Shut it, bitch,” he said, grabbing a handful of stuffing and shoving it into the bird. “It’s Cass’ first Thanksgiving since he came back, man. He needs
Castiel passed out from the pain only a few minutes before Dean got to him, so Jack ignored his father’s wishes and healed him of all his wounds. He helped Dean load Cass into the back of Baby and, once they got back to the bunker, made sure that Castiel was tucked squarely into bed. He woke up two days later and apologized profusely for leaving again . . . which was, you know,
