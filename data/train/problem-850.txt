“Paul. Why must I always remind you to stop erasing so much? Stop questioning every single line you plant down? Gain momentum. Observe the model and REACT. Stop thinking so much. I can hear you thinking. It’s annoying”
Finally being here at Hogwarts, so close to the best friend he’d ever had was just so surreal. He’d thought of this, dreamed of this. He could feel John’s heart beating against his as their chests pressed together, somehow the reality even better than all of his imaginings. And there had been plenty.
Sherlock stretched over to see what it was, and as soon as he caught sight of the red mark he flew out of his chair, almost dropping it and falling over himself in the process. John just sat there, heart thumping almost painfully in his chest, nerves tingling all over his body. He remembered seeing that red seal in an envelope held by his sister all those years ago.
“It's only logical, John. Besides. You wanted him the moment you saw him” he nodded towards the small bird, who was currently inspecting the outside of the shop and his surroundings with avid curiosity.
linger back, taking an unnecessarily long time to pick up his materials and fit all his notes into his shoulder bag. He gave his back to John’s figure, refusing to make notice of the way his heart was beating faster and his throat felt clogged.
He backed away to let her speak but kept his hands resting on her shoulders reassuringly. “What is it, mummy? Please tell me”
Today Sherlock had decided to give John some props from the class to bounce off and contrast the figure. He gave him some white and gold drapery and John had alternated between stretching the sheet with his arms, back and body and just swathing it over himself, letting the silky fabric drop and emphasise the hitches and curves of his figure. The golden stitching on the drapes matched John’s hair almost exactly and Sherlock had found himself having to go to the cafeteria to rehydrate himself. Perhaps, he thought, he was getting sick.
“Mummy,” Sherlock smiled “It’s fine. We still have a few of weeks left of summer.”
“So gorgeous” John murmured. Sherlock looked down, he did his best not to close his eyes despite the tugging need to be consumed in the pleasure. John’s eyes looked black, helplessly aroused and clearly enjoying the view of a disheveled Sherlock above him. Cocky bastard.
For the first time all day, John smiled his beautiful,
Well this took way longer than I said it would hahaa Im so sorry-- work has been a little overbearing, hopefully itll get better soon
Sherlock didn’t even notice time going by until the sharp ringing of his alarm cut through the still concentrated silence of the room. Instantly all the students sighed as they relaxed and began stretching. John’s eyes opened and he wincingly kneeled himself down into a sitting pose again. Sherlock walked back to his desk to turn off the alarm, already planning how to make further conversation with John in this second 10-minute break before the final drawing session before lunch. But before he could think of anything he turned and saw John was already talking to some of his students. All of them clearly having found John’s history in the military service fascinating. Molly, Mike and Mary were huddled around asking him questions enthusiastically. Mary had gone back to curling her hair around her finger, much to Sherlock’s annoyance.
The artist stopped in the middle of the room and sank down on the ground, sitting on the wooden panels and looking up at John, motioning him to do the same. the blonde complied, crossing his legs under himself and leaning down onto his arms stretched behind him. The sunset was finally upon them, its orange, red and yellow hues in stretching beams of light, blending together and draping over both of their figures, casting long lazy shadows into the space behind them.  The soft deep purples in the bottom of the sky slowly loomed over the city. John turned to look at Sherlock bathed in all these lights, looking awe-struck and wondering, and couldn’t help but raise his hand, tuck his fingers beneath the man's chin and tip him down, capturing those pink pillowy lips between his.
“Funny you should call. I was just about to tell you I have a case for-”
“Aha!” Greg hissed happily, effectively snapping John out of his mind and into reality.  “Sorting’s over. Bring on the food!” he rubbed his palms together, turning in his seat and facing the plates eagerly.
“JOHN WATSON HAS CAUGHT THE SNITCH! GRYFFINDOR WINS!” Irene’s voice resounded
Sherlock shrugged “What do you know about teaching art?”
For full seconds John tried his best not to replay as vividly as possible the moments he had felt Sherlock’s lips against his. So soft and full and just as pillowy as they looked from afar.
, she had left them to get dressed and waited for them in Sherlock’s kitchen with a newly made batch of tea and biscuits (now for the both of them). She had proceeded to swoon over how perfect John was for her Sherlock and how wonderful it was that they’d met, pinching the artist’s cheeks and ignoring his murderous glares. John had instantly grown incredibly fond of her.
“Yeah” he nodded, “It’s such an intimate experience... I’d like to share something like that with you. And I-” he pressed a light kiss to the artist’s parted lips, “Would love to stare at you for hours”.
“John.” Sherlock turned to look at him, silently pleading and determined.
Sherlock noted.
(See the end of the chapter for
“I wonder if the effects of such a small Mandrake’s cry really do cause some sort of negative physiological response” Sherlock had wondered out loud and before John could voice his warning they were both instructed to put on their earmuffs. And, as soon as the whole class had begun tearing out mandrakes, Sherlock had snuck a slim finger in between his ear and its covering, allowing some of the shrilling noise inside. The last thing John had seen was Sherlock’s shocked and disturbed expression before he had promptly fallen to the ground in a flurry of limbs.
Not breaking their kiss, they arranged themselves on the couch so that Sherlock was basically draped over John, his legs swung over the Gryffindor’s knees. John held Sherlock tightly in his arms, caressing his back with soft strokes and cupping his neck tenderly.
“Hi” Sherlock whispered, his eyes dropping closed with exhaustion. He gave John the smallest, sweetest smile, probably unaware of how soft and vulnerable it made him look. He looked utterly perfect.
this took long to write so I apologize for the delay <3<3<3 I hope this chapter satisfies those worried about the ending of the last one haha those silly boys <3<3
“Oh, Sherlock… please tell me what’s wrong”, John rose on his tiptoes and laid tiny kisses on Sherlock’s cheeks and closed eyelids, ending with a very chaste brush of lips on lips. Sherlock let out a broken sigh.
Sherlock had realized that maybe… maybe this was a game he could win. Maybe he could get John to fall in love with him. It certainly seemed like a possibility when the blonde was caressing the inside of his thighs with gentle fingers, and murmuring out encouragements as Sherlock came with a whimper onto his tongue. He pictured what it would be like for John to love him. It seemed... pretty close to what he had now. Except John would tell him he was the only one. Sherlock would
John chuckled under his breath. “Come on, let’s go enjoy our second day of winter break”
John nodded, feeling a knot tightening in his stomach. He licked his lips, trying his best to focus on. “You never eat breakfast?” he sounded concerned. “You have to eat something! Most important meal of the day and all that”.
John blinked, his mouth agape “Psychosomatic?”
He hovered over the send button. Hesitating. There was a very high chance that John wouldn’t want to see Sherlock again. If he was embarrassed or disgusted… which were the most probable outcomes in Sherlock’s mind. There was also the chance that he wouldn’t reply at all.
The door opened and John walked in, strutting directly to Sherlock’s desk and leaning over to whisper something. Her professor…giggled? Molly turned sharply to Mike eyebrows risen completely and mouth turning up into a wide grin. “Oh…my god”
He turned to look at Sherlock, who was observing him shyly as if afraid John would disapprove.
known for its random night heat waves”.
Here's the update <3<3
Sherlock shook his head in faux-disapproval, “I’ll take you there sometime after curfew”.
“Sherlock” A quiet voice whispered.
The bell rang, signalling for the ending of the class, incidentally the last class of the day. Since it was Friday, he and John were set to go to the Quidditch field for some practice. Assuming they were still up for it? Sherlock swung his bag across his shoulder and started following John, who still wouldn’t meet his eye, out of the room when Trelawney called them back.
Sherlock’s head turned sharply towards him, a startled look on his face. His cheeks coloured a little as he smiled tentatively, looking back at Angelo who was beaming at them. “Yeth… my friend.”
Sherlock was buzzing with energy, dragging John by the sleeve from store to store to buy the materials on their lists and to explore the ones that had opened in the year they hadn’t been around.
He was just on the way to put his hand back in his pocket, courage freezing over when Sherlock suddenly took him by the wrist and pulled him towards the ice-covered lake. “Come along, John! Do you think the ice is thick enough to support our weight?” Sherlock wondered aloud.
The model groaned around him, which only sent more thrills of pleasure up Sherlock’s spine and made his mind whirl and buzz. He reached down a hand a clutched at his lover’s hair, needing to touch him somehow, feel him. His thighs kept shaking and he couldn’t help the tiny thrusts up into John’s mouth, a little self-conscious but encouraged by the blonde’s reassuring gentle hands on his thighs.
he would be brilliant at everything. With every passing moment Sherlock was getting more and more confident, clearly learning and observing what his partner liked, what made him hum and what made him pull Sherlock’s body against his more desperately.
Sherlock huffed a laugh, shaking his head in dismissal and followed John down the hall and onto the elevator.
“It’s… its good to see you, John” Sherlock whispered.
John took a step forward reaching out for Sherlock. “No. come on. We’ll find something else. Another experiment for you. This... this is too dangerous Sherlock.”
“But Sherlock! WHY not? You’re obviously suffer-”
“I LOVE Pygmy Puffs! I had no idea you were an animal lover like me!” and that was how John found himself trapped for a whole hour in the library, sermoned about the proper care of Pygmy puffs and their habits by an excited Molly Hooper whilst trying to figure out any kind of excuse to leave and find out what Irene and Sherlock were up to.
He had been staring at it for about two hours now without moving a single muscle. The playlist of classical music he had been playing in the background was by now long finished and the daylight streaming through the open blinds no longer draped across the wooden floors and the striped green and white wallpaper.
It was good to be back.
Sherlock did
only. With trembling, excited fingers he turned it over again and broke the wax seal as carefully as he could and finally… pulled out the sheets of paper within the wrapping.
Tick tick
Sherlock divested John of the rest of his clothing (he was already shirtless so it didn’t take too long) and John pulled insistently at the artist’s briefs until those too slithered to the ground once more. They then both stumbled their way upstairs into the artist’s bedroom.
Sherlock’s first solo gallery took place in a reasonably large two floored space with with white walls and dark green marble floors. He’d been receiving quite a lot of attention since his shared gallery almost 9 months ago and had been invited to host a gallery here to show and sell his paintings for 3 a three-month period.
One. Two. Three.
“I ASKED her nicely, how long it’d be-“
“You know how to use spells?” John marvelled. “And… wands and everything?” his eyes widened in amazement.
“I just can’t Irene. I can’t do it.” He heard Sherlock whisper sadly. “And I have never once acted like an animal of any sort” He hissed frowning.
Back again.
“I’m clean” Sherlock assured him “And I know you are too... I just thought... but, If you’d rather..”
“Christ, Sherlock” John tightened his hold on Sherlock’s hips and pulled him closer to meet the thrust of his hips as the latter pulled off his shirt and threw it across the room, flinging himself back into John’s embrace and claiming his mouth over and over again.
“Hello, Mrs. Holmes!” John sounded far too cheery for Sherlock’s taste, but the blonde just continued to ignore his scowl of disapproval and resumed Sherlock’s pacing where the latter had left off as the artist just listened.
Anderson for example, would clearly not pass if he kept up this rate. Sherlock knew, of course, he had only taken the class to warm up to Sally, judging by the fact that he always chose the easel next to hers and even in the dead silence of the room when they drew the model he would always be either whispering comments or flirty attempts at jokes at Sally over his shoulder. Not to mention he kept messing up his drawings because he was busy staring at her neck and behind instead of staring at the model. What bothered Sherlock most about this was not just the fact that Anderson clearly had a girlfriend he planned on cheating on with Sally, or the fact that he was interrupting his classes.. but the fact that Sally was ACTUALLY falling for it. For ANDERSON! Sherlock could not possibly understand the college students of today. Not that he really understood them anyway when he was in college 2 years ago.
They kissed and kissed. Whether it was for minutes or hours they didn’t know, but by the time they pulled away gasping for breath night had enveloped the room around them. The city lights and the moon shone brightly, and slowly they both lied on their backs catching their breath, panting together.
He led them close to the fire where, regrettably, they had to let go of each other’s hands as they divested their soaked coats, gloves, heavy winter boots and scarves. Since they basically had the common room to themselves (no other Gryffindor had stayed behind for the winter break) they just dropped their sodden garments on the floor.
As soon as he thought about not seeing Sherlock, however, he felt a pain of sorrow. True, the professor had been a little overbearing and maybe even rude but he was fascinating, truly talented and intelligent. And that was even without mentioning his undeniable beauty. Sure, he was like no one John had ever seen before, all angles and cheekbones and curls but John had to admit to himself that if he had met Sherlock literally anywhere else other than that classroom the first thing he would’ve done would’ve been to approach him and maybe smooth out a terrible but charming pickup line.
I'll try to be more consistent with the next few updates
John laughed “Hey don’t be cheeky I did just save you from a bludger. I deserve the best treatment!”
“Phil…” one of the other guys, a shorter dark haired boy whispered to Anderson “He’s a Prefect... look at his badge. I think we should-“
“Oh,” Sherlock breathed, sounding like he wasn’t even listening as he focused on the impromptu massage.
As soon as John climbed onto the platform and the robe came off Sherlock began moving him around gently for the morning poses and to find the perfect lighting. He inspected John’s body as inconspicuously as he could, trying to see if he could notice any unfamiliar love bites or faint marks of passionate scratches on his skin, but those he found he had vivid memories of leaving there himself. Good. That lifted up his spirits considerably, knowing that at least this woman had still not laid a hand on his John.
“Wait!” Sherlock called after him again, his voice high and desperate.
“Sherlock…” John started, his face scrunched up in worry. “That could not possibly happen. We’ve managed to remain best friends just seeing each other once a year. And exchanging letters. There’s no way…
The class was dead silent. All completely shocked by the powerful and potent effect the smell of the potion had had on the Ravenclaw. Even Sally stood transfixed staring open mouthed as John knelt beside his friend.
He stood up stretched and walked out of the studio. His fingers and arms felt stiff from drawing for so many hours and he could feel his back already protesting from the night of sleeping over a desk. Sherlock thus resolved to soothe his aching muscles with a hot shower and some breakfast. When was the last time he had eaten? Monday? Sunday?
He looked up and their eyes met. Time stopped for about a second as John tried to convince his heart to stop hammering, convinces Sherlock could feel it through his palm.
John had kissed him. That was a fact.
Sherlock cleared his throat, looking down at his feet momentarily as the cab finally rolled down and stopped beside them. “So umm. See you next week then?” he asked hopefully.
“Oh, that. Yes. My mother made me take lessons when I was a child. My brother took up the cello and I the violin. I never stopped playing. Much to my surprise, my mother was right. It did suit me.”
As soon as he got comfortable, Sherlock reached into his bag and wordlessly passed John a copy of the year 6 potions book. How he’d known John had a quiz tomorrow without a single mention of John, the Gryffindor had no idea. But he just thanked him fondly and took it from Sherlock’s pale fingers.
Sherlock’s hips bucked uncontrollably as he cried out into John's mouth and wrapped his arms around his back tightly. John pressed his lips against Sherlock’s open ones chastely, then peppered kisses all around his face. A stream of breathless ‘John’s’ stuttered out from Sherlock’s lips and into the soft golden hair under his lips.
Sherlock shot him an annoyed glance, he knew exactly what it would smell like. But he decided to humor them and slightly bent forwards towards the pearly white steam coming from the cauldron. He inhaled deeply and instantly became wide eyed and flushed.
He walked into the library, determined to focus his energy on his potions homework and searched for the section on the ‘drought of the living dead’ potion for his three scroll essay. He was just finishing up taking all the books he thought he would e useful from the top shelf when he heard some muttering coming from the other side of the bookshelf. He stepped down and removed some lower books from eye level. Instantly, he spotted none other than Sherlock himself.
There it was. Sherlock braced himself for the inevitable goodbye that would most definitely follow. Sure they’d had a nice greeting. but surely John would want to go back to his shift? Or his life, now that Sherlock was not really a part of it. He couldn’t just expect John to pick up their friendship where Sherlock had left it as if nothing had ever happened. Sure they might “catch up” sometime, but things were most certainly never going to be-
“Of course you know that without even having me tell you” he smiled. “We should play sometime!” He tried not to let it show how shaken Sherlock’s perfect French accent had left him. He should’ve known that Sherlock spoke French of course, given that Beauxbatons was in France... but just hearing his newly deepened voice in that accent… John didn’t really want to think about the skip his heart had given at the rolled 'R’s and the vibration of Sherlock’s voice at the hollow of his throat.
John jumped, startled from his very vivid daydream of the kinds of things they would possibly be doing later that night or tomorrow morning, provided they weren’t interrupted again. “What is it? Did you find something?” he asked, removing his resting head from his hand, which left a warm pink imprint on his cheek from the long time he had spent in the same position. It
Grinning Sherlock typed back.
“Wait wait. So let me get this straight… You knew that she was guilty only because of the paint chips on her coat?”
“Nothing indecorous for sure” John laid a chaste kiss on Sherlock’s lips and pulled back to pick up his bag from the ground and tug the strap above his shoulder. “So how come you have keys from the rest of the school anyway?”
Sherlock pulled his briefs back and on padded silently behind the easel beside the blonde curiously, and promptly chuckled, looking away momentarily. He turned back to the drawing. And once again snickered, raising his hand to try to muffle the sounds. “Oh my god, John” he laughed.
Sherlock opened his mouth, not exactly sure what he wanted to say to that but not expecting him to continue speaking. He did.
It wasn’t long before the pace of his hand sped up around them, John's other hand rubbed soothing circles on the artist’s back in an attempt for him to quiet his high moans and sighs, not because John didn’t like them but because well… they were still in a classroom and the door was not locked. Soon enough, though, the pleasure built up too much as John’s hand roamed down to Sherlock’s arse, squeezing and pulling him even closer onto his lap, Sherlock groaned brokenly, arched against John's chest and with a high sob he spilled onto his lover’s hand, strings of come painting John's chest and the tails of his own shirt, not that he cared in the slightest. John followed with a deep grunt, biting down on Sherlock’s collarbone and hugging the man above him tightly. “God that was brilliant” he exhaled.
“Sorry! Sorry!” John babbled, trying to dry the front of the Beauxbatons uniform with a couple of spells, though his smug grin kind of ruined the effect.
“For god’s sakes, John. Just touch me already” Sherlock growled, his snapping tone dumbed down by the breathless quality of his voice when John lightly bit down on the side of his neck and
John laughed, shaking his head and looking at Sherlock fondly.
John threw himself at him, but instead of feeling the familiar sensation of a fist colliding with his face Sherlock felt the weight of John’s arms around his waist as he was embraced in a bone crushing …hug? After the initial millisecond of frozen shock, Sherlock stopped thinking, and instinctively burrowed his face into John’s neck, throwing his arms around his shoulders…. and sighed.
“John... there are things- things I need to tell you.” Kiss. “Things I’ve kept from you”. Kiss. “I was afraid”. Kiss.
Sherlock was infatuated. So what? He frowned, turning towards the door and almost expecting Mycroft to barge in with a snide comment. But no one came. The room was just as quiet. Sherlock sighed. What to do now?
“I don’t know. But he looks… so unlike himself”
“We definitely have to catch up” John stated. He started walking but stopped when Sherlock just stared at him in confusion.
The Beauxbaton rolled his eyes. “You only won because you cheated. With your 3 meter jumping and all. There’s absolutely no way you could possibly win now.” He had to admit, though, John’s enthusiasm was quite contagious and he found himself beaming back at the Gryffindor.
“Oh... right,” he cleared his throat and looked away avoiding John’s narrowing gaze. The blonde sat next to Sherlock on the white soft duvet of the bed, carefully avoiding to sit on any of Sherlock’s long slim limbs and opened his mouth to yet again ask why Sherlock had not told John he had a girlfriend or to at least assure him that he would not stand in their way and that he shouldn’t feel bad for John’s pathetic pining, he wasn’t sure which he was going to say yet.
“John? Are you alright mate?” Greg asked, yawning, clearly not used to having morning practices yet, standing up and shaking John out of his cyclical mind hoop.
After a few minutes of this, however, the tender touches were no enough and Sherlock’s hips were subconsciously driving up, trying desperately to find friction and relief. John complied, snaking a hand between them and curling his finger’s around the other man’s length.
“10 more minutes, John” he purred. “Then I’ll evaluate”.
Standing up so fast he almost knocked over the desk Sherlock began shoveling all of his materials into his bag, feeling his stomach fluttering with nerves but a hopeful feeling spreading through his chest. He had to remember to thank Irene next time he saw her. Maybe he’d invite her and Kate to lunch.
Her eyebrows rose sharply “You don’t think-“
John covered his face with his hands, elbows resting on his legs and suppressed a groan. He hadn’t even said goodbye to balance his rude behaviour out. Oh, God.
During the break Sherlock was buzzing with the need to talk to John, to somehow confirm what they’d done and what Sherlock hoped they were now to each other. He waited somewhat awkwardly behind his desk, pretending to arrange some papers but sneaking glances at John as he reached for his modesty robe and slipped it on. John hopped off the platform and looked up at Sherlock, smiling mischievously. Sherlock opened his mouth to say something, perhaps invite him to a coffee from the cafeteria but-
John nodded, humming an agreement. “Could I…” he paused, seeming nervous and uncertain “Could I see?” he motioned with his head towards Sherlock’s drawing. Sherlock blinked, surprised that John would show interest in Sherlock’s art at all. No other model had ever asked Sherlock if they could see his drawings, probably presuming that he would write all his deductions about their deepest secrets or afraid that if they saw himself in their drawing they would somehow be able to see them just as clearly too.
Two hours later, most of the guests had left the restaurant but they lingered over a shared plate of Tiramisu and the last sips of their bottle of wine. The artist could’ve sworn the lights in the restaurant had been dimmed, and John in candlelight was absolutely stunning. He wondered how he would paint his eyes in this moment, azure, aqua, midnight, a smidge of brandeis, and in the very center glowing eton. The yellow flame reflected in the center of his dilated pupils flickered as he observed him whilst he spoke. His lips would be traced by a touch of lilac at the seam, rosy pink tinged with blood red in the spots where John licked most recently, a touch ruby blending into his tanned warm beige above his lips.
He still hadn’t seen even the slightest glimpse of the Beauxbatons anywhere but decided that if Sherlock wanted to see him, he would. So he wouldn’t worry about it anymore. Or he would try not to anyway.
“Yes?” John asked innocently, muffled against Sherlock’s hair as he rubbed Sherlock’s quickly peaking nipples through his thin shirt with his fingers.
-Army Doctor
Sherlock licked his lips, turning his gaze to the ground “Well…” he started, nervously “Maybe you… come with me?” he glanced back up at John’s surprised expression.
John, how many times have I reminded you, dear” she’d smiled)  picked John up from his place and Sherlock wasted no time in relating how dull the rest of the year had been without John. John empathised completely.
Sherlock looked up and met John’s eyes. “Yes, John?”
That was enough to spark John into his own climax, moaning freely against Sherlock’s chest and kissing every bit of pale skin he could reach almost worshipfully, whispering his name.
“Right. Well. I have much work to do. It’s been… a pleasure” he rose a brow, turning back to Sherlock and quickly surveying his form once more. “Mr. Holmes” he purred, nodding and licking a slippery pointy tongue to the edge of his teeth. John’s hold on Sherlock’s waist tightened even further.
Greg shrugged, “you just have this faraway look on your face”, he said. He narrowed his eyes suspiciously and then looked towards the bleachers at the far end of the Quidditch field. He smirked, clearly having found what he was looking for. John pulled away from his friend’s triumphant face and looked to where he was looking.
John looked at Sherlock’s retreating figure curiously, before glancing back at his studio’s door. What could he have in there that he couldn’t let John see? It’s not like John hadn’t seen his art before, he’d seen the drawing he had made earlier that very day. Maybe he had drawings or paintings of other nude models and would rather respect their privacy? The thought of someone, male or female, standing in Sherlock’s studio posing naked for solely him made John twinge with envy momentarily. What would it feel like? Modelling for only him? In a room where there weren’t students all around observing him as well. Would Sherlock let down his guard and look at John for hours, his eyes hooding with every passing second. That lovely blush that would sometimes spread through his cheeks reaching his impossibly long neck and pale chest. Would the room grow too hot and he would have to take off his usual blue scarf? Maybe unbutton his shirt just a little-
Sherlock tried to deduce John’s thinking by his posture and facial expression as was the customary process but found nothing. John had a careful, closed expression; revealing nothing and Sherlock’s stomach slowly sunk with confusion.
He leant closer to Sherlock cupping his face with both hands as to avoid him looking anywhere else but directly into John’s eyes. “You are not something temporary to me Sherlock. We are best friends. And we will be best friends forever. You’re amazing. Stop doubting it”.
TEENLOCK!!!!
“That sounds great” the artist smiled. There was something, though, something he kept wondering in the back of his mind. He figured if this… growing thing between John was to keep going then he might as well try his hand at ‘communication’. It’s what successful couples did best no? Well, it
“We were at the prefects meeting” Greg frowned “What do you mea-“
Sherlock thanked the gods that Mrs. Hudson was out of town visiting her sister, or else she might’ve had a heart attack with just the way in which Sherlock and John barged in through the door, mouths attached and hands roaming absolutely everywhere. Sherlock only pulled back long enough to yank the blonde up the stairs and get the door to his apartment open.
term effects. Okay. Let’s go.” He stood up, arms full of ingredients and weird looking jars with questionable things in them. John was sure one of them moved.
He kissed Sherlock one last time lightly before walking away and towards their bedroom
They won.
John bit his lip and nodded slowly, feeling a little out of place. He didn’t know that. He wasn’t even sure if the wands made the magic or the wizards and witches did. He was sure the boy in front of him knew exactly what Quidditch was and suddenly, he felt utterly lost.
...right?
“Excuse me?” John just raised an eyebrow, this guy was just getting more and more ridiculous.
As he walked away John also turned to watch him leave, as if unable to be satisfied until this man is completely out of their sights. Victor’s head was turned, shamelessly staring lustfully after Sherlock’s back and arse.
“Probably, our waiter can’t wait to go back home to watch pornography from his neighbor's wi-fi” Sherlock laughed.
The boy stood straight again, his smile returning “Of courthe not!” he scoffed “I thimply obtherved. Something people often forget to.” He sniffed and pouted his lips slightly before he turned to John again, unsure “You didn’t…. think it wath weird?”
“AHA!” hooted John. “And the Gryffindor scores AGAIN! DOUBLE POINTS! 170 to 80!” he started swinging side to side on his broom with his hips, closing his eyes and pumping his arms in a victory dance.
John opened his mouth again. Perhaps to ask, to understand why Sherlock was looking at him in bemusement, in bewilderment. He leant closer in his search, their noses inches apart. But before he could get out any words-
Sherlock smiled back, so relieved at having his John back. The John he’d left at the Hogwarts train station 5 years ago. But something nagged at the back of his mind, “Why did you do it, John?”
John’s pose didn’t change at all but Sherlock could perfectly distinguish the immediate tension in his back muscles. Sherlock’s students had almost no reaction, clearly used to having their teacher spew out deductions for the model before them. But Sherlock could see them observing John’s scar much more closely.
“I’m fine” John assured him. “They’re just ghost pains now. I’ve had them before... not my first fall in a match I’m ashamed to admit”. He tried to laugh but stopped mid-way with a grimace. “So…How bad was it?”
They suddenly heard frenzied footsteps coming down from the hallway, from far away.
Ill be better with posting schedules i promise!!! <3<3 Thanks for reading!!
John decided to give to poor bloke a break, he didn’t want to overwhelm him… yet. After all, they still had all night ahead of them.
John held him tighter, kissing the side of his neck a couple of times with murmured soothing words and gently pushed him down onto the mattress.
Sherlock’s heart skipped a beat, as it usually did when John looked at him like that. He looked down at his book to hide his blush and hoped John would think it was merely a result from the heat of the fire.
Trelawney nodded grimly, her lips pulled into an ugly scowl “You. Are in grave danger!”
Feeling a thrill of excitement Sherlock reached back into his bag. “A fascinating one, actually” he pulled out a yellow folder, full of files and pictures. “5 serial murders in the span of a week. Every single one linked. All made to look like cases of domestic abuse, all apparently unique. Almost as if they were just coincidentally happening around the same time. Absolutely brilliant!”
John looked absolutely dumbstruck as if the possibility that Sherlock could have thought that had never even crossed his mind “What?” his eyebrows rose. He opened his mouth a couple of times before he rushed out “No! She only gave me restaurant recommendations. Mentioned you are quite fond of Italian- and she… pointed one out for us” his voice softened with every word, trying desperately to understand what was going on in the professors reeling mind.
“Much like yourself, I should think” Sherlock answered, feeling his own face mirroring a smile back.
John looked around as Sherlock reached behind himself and turned the light to the main room of the flat on. His heart beating a little faster with nerves. He was rather messy, now that he looked around his apartment.
Sherlock let out a breathy laugh under his breath, the blonde observed the movement in the artist’s ribs with avid interest, Sherlock’s breath hitched. “Hurry up then,” he winked.
! OF COURSE, I’m happy! Also. I told you so.” She grinned triumphantly.
“Was it?” Sherlock shrugged, his eyes going back to his student's drawings as John’s eyes followed him around the room
“You’re not the seeker!”
The door started banging loudly. “I KNOW YOU'RE IN THERE! JUST YOU WAIT TILL I GET THIS OPEN” Filch screamed.
Sherlock shook his head sadly. “She won't listen to us. Never has. We’ve had a lot of financial troubles since he left. He made sure all his contacts never hired her and spread rumours about her having bad work ethic. It's disgusting. He feels like he owns her. Like he owns us. And my mother. She waits on his hand and foot. He has absolutely destroyed her sense of self-worth and- and. After everything, he’s done. To her. To me. He kept things from me, John. He kept- he… I can’t. I can’t talk about it right now. He… You.” Sherlock swallowed heavily, his eyes blinking rapidly as to avoid any wetness from leaking out. John did the only thing he could think of and pulled Sherlock in by the waist into a hug.
John smiled, blushing furiously and walked out of the locker room followed closely by Sherlock who turned and headed back to the Slytherin booth to join Irene and watch the game.
Sherlock’s smile faded. “Are you…” he spoke softly “Are you alright? I was... I” he bit his lip, unable to get the words out.
“I’m perfectly fine” he snapped, pulling away from the model. If there was one thing he couldn’t handle was John calling him ‘love’ when he was obviously not so. When they were having sex he could handle it, knowing John was obviously just experiencing attachment due to the physical connection and the release of hormones but
Seconds ticked by. He forced himself to turn away again, to walk away from this boy and save himself from the inevitable hurt of Sherlock pushing him away again.
Sherlock had slowly gone from smug to frustrated with every passing goal. And John increasingly amused, as had Sherlock, really, but he was determined not to show it.
Right now, at age 9, John didn’t really expect himself to be a wizard. After two years of spending summers with Sherlock and still not having magic, he knew the chances of
“They think I read their background info on the website?” Sherlock laughed “Of course not”
“Nothing yet,” John said.
“Thank you Hudders. You shouldn’t have” he lightly kissed her cheek and carried over the tray over to his desk, making space by moving his sketchbook currently open to one of his various drawings of John.
Sherlock braced himself for the scolding. There was always scolding to do.
The artist helped John shrug off the paint-stained shirt and watched it slither onto the floor hungrily. He was now straddling John’s legs, kneeling on the floor and severely suspecting his expensive suit pants were also getting their fair share of paint stains but being unable to care at all for the moment.
John raised his gaze to look at Sherlock, who still had his eyes tightly shut. “Sherlock,” John murmured softly, he gently raised to fingers to Sherlock’s chin, tipping it up so he would face him. “ You can talk to me…”
John sighed, dropping off his bag and sitting down heavily on his narrow bed, the springs creaking loudly under his weight, resolving to simply forget about all of this and hope Sherlock did too and he didn’t book him again for a little while so they could both forget about this.
He brewed the tea and as quick as he could went back into the living room where John was sitting in the squashiest chair he owned, the same one he’d sat on when he’s played the violin, right across from his usual one. He looked like he belonged there Sherlock thought with a smirk.
too harmed if anything Sherlock just seemed… upset.
John nodded, lacing his finger’s through the Beauxbatons. “Is there nothing we can do? Or Mycroft perhaps? Maybe we could talk to her”
(See the end of the chapter for
“It was… nice meeting you” John called back. Mycroft only nodded once, watching them leave together into the darkness of the streets.
“Hah. I’ll definitely keep that in mind,” John winked. He could feel his own cheeks bloom with color but he wasn’t about to let Sherlock comment on it. “So… what should we explore first? Forbidden spells? Dark arts? Taboo magical practices and cults?”. The possibilities seemed endless.
“Sherlock. You can’t take all of these” John panted. “They’re not going to fit”.
Hours later the woman had given Harry the letter and had nodded at the family before turning towards the door as Harry jumped up excitedly and the Watson parents left quietly into their own studios.
Sparks
For the rest of that first half hour pose, Sherlock walked around the room silently observing the students.
“Right” John laughed.
“Oh! Who’s this?” Angelo turned to John, smiling kindly.
“Come on, wake up. We need to get up or we’ll be late” the voice said. Contradictorily, however, the strong arms that were surrounding his waist tightened, as if repelling the idea of letting him go to get up and out into the chilly air outside the warm bed and blankets.
Next week.
Unfortunately... this is was important to the story. But it does not end here for John and Sherlock. This was just the beginning. (Yes, I know that doesnt make it better right now. I HATE MYSELF TOO DONT WORRY)
The problem is, he doesn’t know what to do. Or… what to feel, really. So. He likes Sherlock. That is the only rational explanation. There’s no other way to explain his racing heart, the sweating.. his lingering stares. But MERLIN how could he help the staring? When Sherlock had gone from his childhood friend with red chubby cheeks and sizzling lisp to… to this ADONIS carved that looked like a marble sculpture walking. But how to even go about it? When he couldn’t even make himself have a conversation that could potentially be awkward… how could he make a move? Did he even want to make a move? HE was JOHN WATSON. He didn’t date! At least not seriously. He casually flirted and hooked up with people now and then but… he couldn’t see himself doing that with Sherlock.
“Shh… It’s okay. We don’t have to talk about it if you don’t want to. You can tell me later if you like. Or not. But I promise we’ll figure this out okay?”
John had quickly hidden behind the care of magical creatures bookshelf, curious as to what Irene wanted and what Sherlock would do in the face of this clearly romantic approach. He had wondered about his best friend’s sexuality more often than a supposedly straight guy should, but John didn’t like to dwell much upon that. Even if Sherlock were...not straight... John was sure he most certainly wouldn’t be interested in him. John was shorter than the average 16-year-old. He was, although well built, still soft and he hated to admit it… rather cuddly. Sherlock, on the other hand, was the very definition of beauty and grace. With his sharp cheekbones, rosebud of a mouth and those clear gray eyes that changed color with the sunlight and his endless legs and...
“Well, that was the easiest part” Sherlock scoffed, and began his series of deductions. Starting with one case only led to him telling John about another and then another and on and on. The hours passed as Sherlock regaled stories of some of his various cases to an astounded John and a speechless class. He always started by describing the crime scene as he had found it, silently challenging John to think about what had happened for himself, surprisingly John’s comments were oddly insightful about the cases. Even when they were wrong (most of the time) they managed to make Sherlock think back to the cases and wonder if he would have come to the correct conclusion faster if someone had made those comments to him then.
“Of course it was! I’d… never seen someone do that before. That was incredible!”
Anyway... I do want to warn people that this chapter is a tad angsty-- there's an instance of a not-good relationship (NOT between Sherlock and John, obviously)- so if that's triggering please go ahead with caution. Again I promise NOTHING less than a super happy ending :)!
Sherlock tried to walk away but Irene snatched his arm roughly and pulled him back with a firm tug.
The last few weeks of the term flew by.
The woman finally came into view, rushing towards them. She was very tall and slender, with kind green eyes and the same curls Sherlock had falling onto her thin shoulders. “Come, sweetheart, Mycroft had finally finished with his shopping and- Oh”. She suddenly stopped short, spotting John. “Hello,” she smiled, sending a curious and surprised look to the smaller boy next to him.
He stood in front of the store, encouraged that Sherlock’s presence just a foot away from him and feeling his familiar warmth radiate into his side. They stared at the entrance of the small dark brown shop much longer than necessary before the chill of the approaching night sunk into their robes. Gladstone hooted his displeasure at the cool air’s chill.
“Sherlock,” he said. It sounded far away. The roaring still taking over Sherlock’s senses.
“That’s great,” John murmured, creeping closer still until his chest was pressed against Sherlock’s back, moving as if he just meant to peer over his shoulder at whatever progress he was doing with the padlocks. “Looks like you’ve already opened most of them. Quite brilliant”. Sherlock was frozen solid against him, not tense just… shocked. John could almost feel the boy’s rattling breath as he tried to speak, but in wake of his failure, he settled with a single nod.
Molly frowned “But you seem to be getting along pretty well. I thought things were more than fine between you two.”
was staring at him.
John’s triumphant expression only twitched slightly as his eyes enlarged in shock. “Spiders?!”
Sherlock smiled. Every ounce of the self-consciousness he had been feeling vanishing with John Watson’s soft and fond gaze. “You’re welcome” he murmured back.
Sherlock gulped quietly “If a child doesn’t show signs of magic by the tenth year of age chances are they…”. He paused, his breath intake shaky and unsteady “What if.. I don't… What if I’m not…” he stopped, his head falling heavy face first into his hands, hiding his expression from John.
Greg nodded alongside her. “Yeah mate, I was all the way across from the pitch and man… that was a nasty fall. I flew as fast as a could but Sherlock caught you first,” he smiled. “I like that bloke, John. He’s a keeper. I mean. Not literally. Cause y’know. He’s a Seeker. But. Y’know what I mean.”
John’s hands fell from cupping Sherlock’s face as if burned. Sudden embarrassment gripped Sherlock tightly by the chest without knowing the reason. A harsh intake of breath echoed through the room.
“So what if he does? Look. The way I see it you made a connection with someone. Even if you never become anything more, isn’t it enough having someone you click with? Someone that understands you?”
manage to make Sherlock jump, yelp or even fall backwards and topple off a chair in one occasion but alas, no magic burst out of him.
“This year-” McGonagall said loudly, instantly breaking the various whispered conversations that had broken out within the crowd, “will be a little different. Our friends from The Beauxbatons Academy of Magic will be staying with us after their castle suffered an infestation of giant spiders. While this issue is resolved Hogwarts will be welcoming the student body and staff to stay with us for as long as they need. I expect you all to be on your very best behaviour and remember to be good hosts”.
John closed his eyes and sighed. He adjusted Sherlock’s weight on his shoulders so he wouldn’t be completely dragged on the floor (
Mary Morstan was leaning against her easel, delicately holding her pencils in one hand and the other one in her hair, a finger curling one blonde lock around. She was looking at John through her thick eyelashes and smiling. Sherlock felt himself frown.
He had looked down at his hands in wonder and felt warmth flow through him at the thought that maybe he too could someday receive a mysterious visitor. Someone to show him he was not ordinary.
“That was amazing!” John suddenly exclaimed, grinning from ear to ear “How did you know all that?” his eyes widened. “Was that” John looked around as if someone might be eavesdropping on their conversation “Magic? Are you doing magic without permission?” he whispered.
He’d slid out of bed and slipping on his boxer briefs he padded down to Sherlock’s studio, the only source of light in the dark apartment. Squinting against the brightness he had peered into the room. Sherlock had been sitting in front of his newest painting, staring at it intently. It wasn’t the kind of stare that betrayed the artist’s loss at how to continue, how to convey what he most wanted his painting to. It was a dazed stare. The new painting of John was of the day he had moved into 221b, after he had carried all his bags up the long flight of stairs and had collapsed on the couch, shirt open and panting. Now that John recalled it, Sherlock had stared at him for long moments that day, memorizing John’s figure splayed on his couch.
John laughed “What?! As if you knew!”
Sherlock snapped out of it, turning to look at Lestrade “Of course. Come along John!” he called, walking rapidly inside the hotel’s lobby and knowing John would follow right behind him.
“Some, yeah” John shrugged shyly. “Would that be.. okay?”
thought John.
Beaming back, the expression still feeling slightly foreign on his features, Sherlock just shrugged “I told you it was psychosomatic. You just needed to be distracted”
“I still can’t… it's just. You. Magic” Sherlock grinned, the same look he had gotten after he and John had stopped jumping around and screaming with excitement after John’s first sign of magic. “You’ll come to Hogwarts with me” his smile softened.
concluded Sherlock.
John’s heart swelled as he momentarily pulled away from the kiss and watched Sherlock’s debauched face, closed eyes and parted lips in the haze of their kisses and touches, implicitly trusting John fully and completely with everything he is.
“Don’t you dare!” John cried, raising himself on his elbows and staring down at Sherlock.
Sherlock, in turn, was grateful they were still immersed in darkness as he felt the heat crawl up his neck to pool in his cheeks.
Once Sherlock finished dressing himself to the nines he headed down to the school, shoulder bag in hand with his art materials and notebook to make further notes of John if necessary. He also took his sketchbook filled with drawings of John, just in case he decided to draw with his class throughout the day.
Hello <3
“Sherlock there you are! Thank Christ!” he breathed, raising the yellow police tape so Sherlock could walk below it. “We’re stuck here. The man is on the 3
John hadn’t seen much of Sherringford since he’d known the Holmes’s family. He was always away on trips and neither Sherlock nor Mycroft talked much about him. And John didn’t dare ask anything about him judging by the cold atmosphere that took over whenever he was around.
John grinned but looked a bit embarrassed “I didn’t mean to… come on so hard. It’s just... I hated that man. The nerve of him. He actually asked if I was your
“Not my fault. Nobody ever should put an elevator behind the staircase. Beats the point” he giggled. They were now in front of the door, Sherlock, still chuckling under his breath reached inside his bag for the key. He opened the door, motioning John as if they had done this a million times before. But in the back of Sherlock’s mind, the marvel of seeing John Watson walking through the front door to his flat made his heart feel like it was dancing, a warm feeling spreading through his chest.
“Anyway” John sighed, happily “Nice to meet you Sherlock Holmes” and he clutched his cane and walked out of the room.
’ Sherlock blinked. What was wrong with him? ‘
John laughed. “Right. ‘course it is.”
“That’s wonderful Sherl! How about you John? What kind of wand do you have?”
Sherlock nodded, going back to walk around the classroom, surveying the class’ drawings from the corner of his eye. “He was the prime suspect in the murder of his wife. Obviously innocent. But the police
“A freak,” she said again as if having to emphasise how much she didn’t understand him. How could she? John thought. He was the only one who’d ever understood him. Just as he was. “No one likes him,” she continued. “Always saying weird things and getting himself punched. Little weirdo deserves it, to be honest. Practically asks for it.”
They gathered all the spicy ingredients they could find from Eliza’s cupboard as well as the potion ingredients she kept hidden under the kitchen sink and behind some pots and bowls. “Are you sure these are safe to eat Sherlock?” John had asked bemusedly, reading the labels with slight concern.
John stirred, Sherlock didn’t stop sketching but slowed, watching John’s eyes drowsily blink open and look confused for a couple of moments before they caught sight of Sherlock. “Hello, you” he slurred out, voice slow with sleep but coated with honey.
Soon enough, it was just him and John in the room, Sherlock facing away from him as he heard John hobble behind the changing screen and begin changing. A couple minutes passed and Sherlock was now definitely pushing it, placing one pencil at a time carefully onto the zipper in his bag.
? Called his gallery a “show”? John. His.
Sherlock froze, his book fell on his lap and rolled onto the floor with a loud thunk. He stared at John’s retreating figure onto the house, heart thundering in his chest. He felt his neck and cheeks flood with hot heat and his eyes widen. He knew he probably looked absolutely ridiculous; eyes wide and mouth parted in complete shock and complete confusion.
Sherlock straightened up and looked down shyly, his smile still very evident. He walked right up to John and stopped just as their chests touched. “So... are you just going to stare at me? Or are you going to do something about it?”
John’s eyes widened, sitting up straighter and placing down his teacup carefully “That sounds brilliant!”
John had been absolutely ecstatic about the broom and had hugged Sherlock for at least 5 minutes before he had had to push him away and adjust his school robes before John noticed that Sherlock was….physically responding, to put it delicately.
Finally; they let go, the awkward stretch of silence having gone for a beat too long. Sherlock couldn’t tear his eyes off of John, the intensity of his glare mesmerizing. His eyes seemed darker, bordering on a shade of almost black.
John had looked at the floor in disappointment and nodded as the woman bade him goodbye. He had sighed sadly but gone back inside, a spark of hope still fluttering inside him and pride for his sister shining through his ocean blue eyes.
“Yea! I fucking did, you arse, and what does that fucking tell you?”
With his mouth still full of the sticky sweet he grinned like a child. “Chocolate covered honeycombs!” he said in wonder.
“What's it like when you delete them?” Johns voice was weak, stopped up, teary. Sherlock pulled John impossibly closer, the soldier went, curling himself into Sherlock's chest.
“Please,” John breathed.
“No, no John.” He said thickly, after a moment. “I’m not a monster. I’m a sociopath. And
“Do you know your name?” he asked. The girl just blinked at him, a little furrow between her brow.
“I feel ya, mate.” Greg sighed and shook his head, “the wedding planning is a right horror show, it is. I
“Mycroft,” he said grudgingly, “I’m ready.” A voice on the other end of the line sighed in relief.
“Ah, um, during actually. Snagged it out of a box of supplies.” John said sheepishly. Sherlock couldn't fight the probably bit-not-good smile from picturing a much younger John Watson nicking simple office supplies in order to jot down the horrors around him. How perfectly in line with the wonderfully polar man he had the pleasure of seeing every day. A man of true opposition. Beauty and death in one pencil stroke, blood and art seamlessly integrated at John’s hands.
”. Because John was home for Sherlock, just as Sherlock was home for John. Johns' toes curled in delight.
“Is it my room?” She asked, looking around at the cream walls and white sparkly curtains with little fairy lights around the edge, the child sized desk in the corner with a stack of coloring books and art supplies, the low twin sized bed with its teal blue comforter and tall headboard with a rose carved in the center, the lamp on her nightstand along with the monitor, the large bookshelves with puzzles and games and books, the closet which she hadn’t yet checked was full of clothes. They had installed an LED light in the ceiling, when she turned the lights off it would cycle through a soft rainbow pallet and serve as a night light, John didn’t want her to ever feel trapped in the dark again.
But Sherlock was also up, unable to sleep the night before.
” and “
“Won’t you sit?” he motioned to John’s seat. Hesitantly, John sat. Sherlock, thankfully, didn’t hover, just curled up on his own seat, analyzing John’s every move. John, strangely enough, felt a bit comforted by that. It wasn’t often something got Sherlock’s full attention like this. It was flattering in a way John tried to suppress.
“I don’t like people touching you.” Sherlock pouted, pulling roughly on the buttons of John’s shirt.
“Don’t use it,” John ordered. Sherlock obediently sat it down. “Take them off,” John breathed, staring at his husband's hands. John was so wet he ached for it, feeling empty and needy. Sherlock instantly understood and complied, stripping off the rubber gloves. He took John’s hand gently in his own.
Sherlock just watched for a moment before pulling his head back. John didn’t bother to hiss his question again. After a moment, Sherlock pulled something from his massive coat.
is excited,
. Clear as day, painted across you in neon colors. Like a bloody sign on your back. It’s obvious to anyone with working eyes.” Greg eyed him for a minute, but when the boy zoned out, seeming to forget the DS, Greg grudgingly left.
John found that he loved it, that gentle possessiveness, the strange vulnerability of this man, the ice in his gaze, John could see his potential to be cruel. John could see the danger lurking under this man’s skin, this man was going to be difficult, he would be hard to understand, harder still to get close to.
I feel the need to add that the bit about Mycroft tracing words on Sherlock’s back when he couldn’t sleep was something my sister did for me. We’re half sisters, estranged with no relationship to speak of, but I always remember her tracing words and shapes on my back when I woke up from a nightmare.
“I don’t follow,” Sherlock asked blankly. John scrubbed his face.
He hadn’t slept so well since the fall.
“You gonna tell me your name yet, or do I have to guess?” Greg asked in good humor, leaning against the bars. The boy analyzed him for a minute before rolling his shoulders and standing. Greg was surprised to see how tall the lad was when he wasn’t hunched over or sitting. He easily towered over Greg, and probably many other people.
Many of you may remember me before John, brash, cold, a man with a knack for keeping everyone at arm’s length. Since John was introduced into my life, however, things have changed significantly. I’ve now come to call you friends, rather than a group who may simply tolerate me.”
“What is it? What’s wrong?” Greg said sharply, already moving for his coat.
This girl, this tragic, anonymous being with no name, no past, nothing but the ratty clothes on her back. This child, who couldn’t be more than three, or maybe she could, she was obviously malnourished. She needed help, she needed a moment of safety. Just a bit of rest, John was a doctor, a soldier, a protector, and provider. He had a duty to…
“Why… why are they up there?” John asked quietly, Sherlock could see his hands curling into fists.
“I'd take it for you if I could,” John whispered in a rough voice.
“And I told you, I was wrong.”
On the table lay two sterilized and pre-packaged scalpels, two syringes, a vial of… (
“You ought to get some proper supplies. If this is what you can do with notebook paper and a regular pencil, I’d be intrigued to see what you do with the real thing.” Sherlock said, feigning nonchalance as he dropped the notebook back into John's lap.
at me. It’s arousal and amazement and wonder. As if I’m something precious, something treasured, something… something
He stood for a moment, debating fighting the pull, until there was another yank on his young heart, and he hissed in annoyance as he was almost involuntarily swung around. Steeling himself, he raised his eyes. There was a girl sat at a booth, eyeing him strangely, plastic smile still in place. With grim determination John looked over the banner proudly proclaiming the name of a university. Finally, he grudgingly stepped up.
That night found them at a jazz club not far from the hotel. This was one of the only things Sherlock had insisted on so John was more than thrilled to be here with his love. They danced along the floor in a slow swing. Sherlock smiled freely. John felt himself melt, if only for a moment.
“Don’t even know what I was going to say.” He murmured.
They stared at one and other for a long moment, the man, who was
” both Mycroft and John corrected at once in an automatic manner.
Even as he watched all the survivors being shuffled out into the sunlight for the first time in who knows how long, four ambulances looking people over and beginning to transport them, this didn’t feel like a win. He felt hollowed out. This had only been the tip of the iceberg. They didn’t have the people who ran the illicit site, they didn’t have all the users, and there was a stack of receipts inside, humans being bought and sold like cattle. Maybe some of those smaller kids went to unsuspecting parents on black market adoptions, but it was unlikely, and those numbers were slim. These people had been at it for years, at least a decade. There was no telling how many they were too late to save.
Fingers trembling, he clicked on the messages icon.
“Come on. We really have to go. If we wait any longer, we might run into Mrs Norris or the librarian opening up”. Even as he said it though, he didn’t attempt to move his legs from under the warm solid weight of Sherlock’s head.
Sherringford left on yet another business trip. The shouting had at last stopped. At first, John had been relieved, thinking that everything would sink back into their usual summer rhythm. But somehow… everything felt so much worse.
“Your etheth?” John lisped.
“Oh,” John’s smile faded “I’m… booked for another class next week I’m afraid”
“Smell. To be accurate a different smell for everyone who comes into contact with it. The receptor will perceive the potion’s smell as whatever they find most attractive, whether they are aware of it or not.” Sherlock answered clearly uninterested in the points but unable to stop the flow of knowledge passing through his cupid bow lips.
“What was it like? Being there, protecting your people, missing your family..”
Sorry the update took so long-- the chapter is twice as long and i didnt feel like splitting it into two so- <3<3
John wrapped his arms tightly around Sherlock’s waist, creating a sudden safe haven in the midst of the journalists and gallery visitors. Distantly they both heard a couple of snapshots go off behind them from the journalists around them watching them embracing, but they did not care.
“And then when you- haha- ha. I can’t believe you made us break into an apartment building, and run up 15 floors just so you could use the rooftops as running ground. And then we saw the elevator on the top floor after all those goddamn stairs” Sherlock burst into new peals of delighted laughter alongside him, John shaking his head and gasping for breath.
“I missed this,” John sighed as he took a seat, already eagerly waiting for the banquet to being and taste every single dish on the table. He looked longingly at the empty silver plates before them.
The door of the classroom flew open and everyone was startled out of their numbed states and turned towards the door. Professor Septima Vector was standing in the doorway, dragging someone behind her. John strained his neck to look past Mary, trying to see who it was but couldn’t make them out from behind the professor.
“Apparent suicide.” He answered “But he was spotted by the security cameras after his supposed death”
“But?” Sherlock prompted
Sherlock turned towards the unfamiliar voice, steeling himself for yet another pointless interaction but knowing it to be necessary for his profession. He smiled as naturally as he could and answered “Yes. I am Sherlock Holmes”
Sherlock sighed but was comforted by John’s soothing fingertips stroking over his knuckles. “I haven’t answered yet… I’m just not sure what to do. I can’t accept my father back into our lives, no matter how much he apologizes. I just can’t. But the last thing I want to do is alienate my mother. Not after everything she’s been through. I… I don’t know”
Oh my God.
being able to hold the one person that mattered most to him in all this world and know that they were finally where they were supposed to be all along. In each other’s lives. In each other’s hearts. In each other’s arms.
Biting his lip and remembering the soft feeling of John’s lips against his he closed his eyes and pressed the button on the touch screen, heart hammering away at his chest wildly.
“Can you see anything?”
“Yeah, I figured” Molly laughed “So tell me, John... How much more do I have to torture you before you tell me why you were spying on Sherlock hmm?”
In an instant, with some unknown instinct, John reached up for the snitch, jumping as high as he could. His hand rose up and in a moment of glory, his fingers curled around the snitch, the cold metal of the gold searing through his warmth.
I enjoyed writing this so much!!! Im going to miss writing these two <3<3<3 Thank you so much for reading this, it means so much to me! And thank you to all that left such lovely comments- they make me so happy <3!! I hope you liked the story!! <3<3<3!!!! Thank you for commenting and leaving kudos and I'll see you next time!!!!! I think a potterlock is next in line for me!
“I'm Sherlock’s mother, Elizabeth. But you can call me Eliza.” She smiled again, more surely this time. She extended a slender hand and shook John’s warmly. “How-?”
“You are very beautiful to me”
They walked around the castle, catching up for hours. John told Sherlock about the time he fell into the icy waters of the lake during his second year and landed on top of a very unlucky mermaid… she hadn’t been very pleased with him, but luckily the giant squid had come to John’s rescue soon enough. Sherlock told John about the time he had snuck into the care of magical creature’s massive dome at his school, searching for Acromantula venom, and had somehow accidentally released about a couple hundred Demiguises into the castle. Fortunately, he hadn’t been caught. Unfortunately, not all the Demiguises had either. They still roamed around the castle, often pranking students and locking classrooms from the inside.
“Hmm”. the soft sound made both of their heads turn sharply.
The artist sighed in pleasure “Mmmn-no time for this now. we need to…. To uh.. uhh... “
Molly beamed right back, practically jumping out of her skin in excitement. “This is so great, John!”
Lightning. That was the only way Sherlock could have described the second their eyes met again. So intense and so electric they both had to look away. Sherlock to scratching his pencil more ferociously on the page and John onto the ground, both unaware of each other’s reactions and berating themselves alone.
John’s face last night when he sent the note... but Sherlock thought he’d sounded fine. He definitely hadn’t seemed so... forlorn.  Sherlock bit his lip, trying to find something to say. But John beat him to it.
“Sherlock! Wait!”. John rushed up to his friend who, miracles of miracles, had actually stopped at the sound of John’s voice. As soon as he reached him he stepped in front of him, watching him carefully. Sherlock’s eyes were closed tightly, the letter still held firmly in his fist getting more and more crumpled by the second. “Are you alright? What’s going on?”
“Oh. Uh. Thank you. And yes I suppose he could be deemed not physically unappealing” Sherlock answered as neutrally as he could, not meeting her eye.
“Well did you stand there doing nothing as he kissed you? Did you tell him to stay when he left?”
between them but trust and fondness, just like when they were children. Of course, now their gazes held a lot more weight to them..a  lot more sentiment as Sherlock would say.
Sherlock smirked, knowing that even if John made fun of him or didn’t believe him he would at least be distracted enough not to be in pain….For the benefit of the students drawing him that needed him to be perfectly still……obviously.
him. To hold him. To have him….
John started laughing loudly. “Oh, Merlin. You haven’t changed a bit have you?” he looked immensely pleased as he beamed at Sherlock’s sheepish expression. Sherlock could faintly detect the slightest hint of the sadness he had seen there before, lingering in the corners... but just as he tried to assess the expression John seemed to collect himself and went back to beaming.
“Okay. Are you
12 Ramsbury, Marlborough, UK
Well, a faint memory did come to mind. One night in Sherlock’s room where they’d been so close… close and unsure as to what was going on until Sherlock’s father had come barging in. And now, five years later, they were back in that same moment, pressed together chest to chest. Except… except
Said boy was muttering to himself, practically burrowed inside the book he cradled gently in his hands. John smiled, wondering why on earth he’d been worried and climbing down the rest of the steps on the ladder to make his way to him. He sat down next to him, much to the startlement of the Beauxbatons.
John frowned now, even more confused.  “Sherlock” his voice had gone soft “You really don’t know why I did it? Why I couldn’t let you get hurt?”. His gaze on Sherlock’s was so intense the Beauxbatons wanted to look away, but he couldn’t. There was so much in that look. So much unspoken pressure upon them. SO many conversations he knew they still had to have.  Sherlock felt the tension, the one he’d been feeling around John for weeks now. Weeks and weeks of unspoken things shimmering like an electric barrier between them.
“I love you,” Sherlock mumbled.
John looked at Mrs. Hudson, shooting her a telepathic,
At that, Mrs. Hudson gave a funny little giggle. “No, dear. No, but he does live here. On a more permanent basis, I mean. He's across the hall from you, in B. He shouldn’t give you any trouble, but if he does, just let me know, and I’ll have a word with him.”
He pulled Sherlock to him, taking his other hand so that he could squeeze both tight.
Sherlock’s head bumped against John’s shoulder, and he laughed. Clear, bright joy. He held Sherlock tight against his chest, he breathed in the scent of his posh shampoo, and he thanked his lucky stars that he’d be allowed to orbit his own brilliant world forever. So what if it looked ridiculous to the rest of the galaxy, a sun about a planet; he had absolutely no desire to be conventional any longer.
"No. Of course not."
There had been a ruffle of the hair, next, in passing. An act which was hardly necessary or practical. He had been curled up on the sofa, face pressed into the cushions. A week without a case, thoughts spinning, spitting, splitting through the seams. Too much. And then John’s hand had been in his hair. Brief, a second’s worth, perhaps, but enough for Sherlock to blink open his eyes, all thoughts focused suddenly on the touch, the footsteps passing, John, John, John. Far preferable, despite the niggling worry which came with such single-minded focus. He stayed close to him for the rest of the day, and the fog cleared.
“I want to be with you. Of course.”
This is John Watson. From the letter?
"I might like him. Maybe. I... really, I might."
“This is…” A sheepish smile, a glance down at their hands. “This, here, with you. It’s the happiest I’ve ever been.”
“I’m sorry. It’s not that I’m not interested. Just. Slow down a bit, maybe?”
“This will suit nicely,” he said, but it didn’t earn him time alone. Even as he wandered to the window to look out, he could feel Mrs. Hudson hovering in the doorway, as if waiting for something more. “That’s everything sorted, isn’t it?” he asked, deliberately keeping his back turned.
“Well, it’s lovely now.”
“Hang on, the woman inside said that you don’t like showing the bees to her guests.”
“A tour?”
“This choice is not one that you have to make. It would likely be best for you to move on to the next batch of dull women. But I want all the rest of it, if you’re willing to give up the sexual element.”
The bedroom was just large enough not to feel cramped, and the furnishings seemed to come from the same stock as Mrs. Hudson. The bed frame and dresser were heavy wood, and nothing was shy of frills.
Sherlock probably knew he was planning something long before he came out with it, but he was courteous enough not to let on.
"You really don't know how to do this, do you?" asked Harry, and John lost his keyboard privileges.
Sherlock had retreated, had holed himself away and buried himself in blankets. And John knew that he had to make himself clear, because this wouldn’t do at all.
I'd like to deduce you.
John wasn't on the site himself, but Harry was. Asking was a risk, though. Harry was often a wild card. Then again, this whole thing was probably a joke, he reminded himself. The stakes weren't really all that high, and he and Harry could have a bit of fun. Mess with Sherlock a little, and maybe they could find out what truly made him tick.
John was letting go of Sherlock’s hand. Sherlock held firm. John had misunderstood.
And Harry stepped forward, and Harry didn't punch him.
Sherlock butted him in the shoulder, and John laughed, filling the room with summer.
"Dear John Watson... very formal. Is this a break up letter? That's harsh, Johnny."
The spread in the dining room was more elaborate than John had expected, especially considering the absence of a replicator. “We had one growing up,” Mrs. Hudson explained, “but it takes some of the art out of it, I think. Now, my husband didn’t see the difference. But not everything’s meant to be perfect. Sometimes, that just makes it boring… do you know what I mean?”
He regretted it because they were meant to stand together, allies in the battle to make sense of the often uncertain world around them. Or, they had been before. Through everything, through all of the hospital visits and forced therapy sessions and false condolences, through their father's collapse, from which he'd barely risen after the funeral; through all of it, they'd understood each other. They'd stood united. The two of them, together, had been a certainty. And then a letter had come in the mail. A bit better for John than it had been for Harry, that was.
If John was the sun, then the map of the cosmos had been drawn before the days of Copernicus and Galileo. He was lost hopelessly in Sherlock’s orbit. And although he disapproved of the notion that Sherlock Holmes was the center of the world, he’d certainly been quick to take up a position at the center of John’s life.
John combed his fingers into Sherlock’s hair as he waited for the storm clouds to clear up again.
Come on, Sherlock Holmes. You must have come online by now.
“Of the grounds,” Sherlock continued. “I’ll take you on one. Mrs. Hudson, put his dinner in the fridge.”
When all of his 't's were crossed and 'i's dotted, all in neat print, John finally folded up the letter and, after arithmancy, took a trip to the owlry. There, Gladstone, his brown, tawny wonder of an owl lay nestled among the others. It seemed that the weather had been affecting him, too, and it was almost a shame to send him out into the cold. At least the rain had passed, leaving the air crisper and a bit fresher. After a proper greeting, John attached the envelope to his Gladstone's leg.
"No, I think it's a bit... sweet," Harry said, a negligible portion of the sentiment artificial and the rest genuine. "I just wish I had such an easy way to find a date."
“Hm.” Plate full, the man turned and disappeared into the hall.
“However, I can guarantee that I won’t want to be with you in the carnal sense at any point in time. That will not change. It has never been where my interests lie. John, this choice…”
But was John not a part of that work, now? Integrated, integral.
There. He’d gotten it out, managed to put words to the overwhelming feeling that he belonged here, by Sherlock’s side. Not any less whole in himself, but home.
The name had faded from John's palm within three days, but, by that time, his investigation was already thoroughly underway. He'd learned both that no student by such a name had ever attended Hogwarts and that 'Holmes' was not a well-known name in the wizarding world at all. Of course, marriage could always confuse surnames; perhaps this Sherlock was part of some branch of extended family. But, either way, he was not as easy to locate as John had hoped he would be.
Sherlock had gone blank, but he hadn’t shied away, which was good enough for the moment. He looked a bit frightened, and John took his hand, because it wasn’t that sort of talk. It wasn’t anything that should worry him, if John was accurate in his readings.
Harry's eyes were wide and round, and John instantly regretted the outburst, especially when her expression was immediately sheathed in steel. He knew better. Or ought to. He really truly, ought to by now. You egotistical prick!" Yes, Harry had a temper, too, and Harry could also stand and fight. But that wasn't why John regretted what he'd said so deeply.
It took John rather longer than necessary to draft his letter, because, although it would probably never be read, he wanted it to be perfect. The scroll of parchment would be the source of his soulmate's first impression of him. If the letter was delivered successfully, if this name truly belonged to his soulmate, and if John was wasting his time on anything more that a foolish fancy, that was. It was a pleasant dream to dwell on while he whiled away the time between classes, whether there was any substance to it or not.
It was a bit of a silly question.
“No, let me finish. I’ve been doing a lot of thinking. And. I’ve decided that this is where I want to be. Until the end, really. If that’s alright with you. As friends, or… or whatever else, but I want it to be with you.”
Mrs. Hudson was at his shoulder now, making his skin prickle. Harmless as he was sure she was, he liked to keep his personal space his own.
"I didn't mean," John floundered. "You know. You know I didn't mean it like that."
"Sincerely, Sherlock Holmes," she finished. "You pranked someone without me? How could you?"
“I said anything, friends or beyond. It would be my honor, my absolute pleasure, to be your… whatever it is you’re proposing. Your romantic partner. I’m not a sex fiend, alright?”
"Harry...."
Sherlock’s voice had sped up by the end, becoming more clipped as his grip tightened. He waited, expectant, terrified and fully embarrassed of that fact. Now that he had thawed, he wasn’t certain that he could revert to his previous state. The packaging, after all, always advised against refreezing.
, but she was no help. Sherlock’s expression revealed nothing but a slight impatience. With a sigh, John pushed himself all the way up and tottled after the much more graceful Sherlock, glad that the pretense of the meal had, at least, been abandoned.
“No! No. I’m sure you led your crew very well.”
“That’s right, dear. Is that all you have?”
The door swung open before John was through with knocking. That act in itself felt wrong. He’d grown accustomed to automation, but this door didn’t slip away into the walls, and the hinges whined their age. The beaming older woman who’d opened it for him was somewhat less alien to him.
Into bed.
“You’re a very practical man, aren’t you,” Sherlock said with some distaste. “And yet sold on Starfleet’s lofty ideals, is that right?”
After all, John was nothing if not the sun. Warm, welcoming, a source of life. Deadly when focused, yet equally capable of thawing the most stubborn of frost. And Sherlock had fancied himself a glacier.
“You don’t want to see the hives?”
"I just, I don't know. I don't know what I'm doing."
“This is Captain John Watson,” Mrs. Hudson provided helpfully. “I told you he’d be arriving; I'm absolutely certain of it.”
John was pulling him in, taking his other hand.
It had begun gradually, almost imperceptibly. Sherlock hadn’t even realized he was keeping track, although he must have been, even then, at the beginning of it all. It had been a touch on the shoulder for his attention, a brush of fingers as tea changed hands. On top of the medical necessities, of course; aside from the cleansing of wounds, the application of ointments and plasters. But it had grown, somehow, and he had hardly dared to analyze it. It was too fragile a thing, and it pulled at all the wrong heartstrings. To be fair, any tug of his heart was marked wrong, off limits, out of place. Dangerous.
John Watson had found the outdated spell book while exploring the school library on a drizzly Saturday afternoon, a day unsuited for roaming the grounds. Not that a little rain usually had the power to deter him, but this day was particularly cold and this drizzle particularly intrusive, an unpleasant reminder of the approaching winter. Crackling fires and ancient armchairs made for far more comforting an atmosphere. Despite that fact, the library was largely vacant. Once again, John seemed to be the only one unable to get a simple permission slip signed.
"Can't be all that difficult. You're a Watson," John teased, and that was essentially that, for now. John was hopeful about the rest of the holiday. Not full on, foolishly optimistic, but hopeful.
“I’m just taking a few things upstairs,” the man said, seemingly to preempt a reprimand from Mrs. Hudson. “Very busy, can’t stop and chat. Not that I wouldn’t love to…” His eyes landed on John, and he paused, brow furrowing at the change in scenery.
“Oh.” The smile softened into something less concerning.
“Bees?”
“So, I just want you to know that, this is enough. The way we are now, it’s, well, brilliant.”
Sherlock was swaying in closer, so John took him in his arms. He was trembling a bit; he must have expected a different response. Received one in the past, maybe. Although, with Sherlock, even ‘just friends’ could make John feel like he’d been gifted with an entire planet.
“So why is it so heavy on flowers? Why not vegetables, or something?”
His name's Gladstone.
The man seemed far less certain, but, remembering his manners, John extended his hand. “Pleasure to meet you.”
Now, they stood on different continents, practically, with an entire ocean between them. And Harry had been trying. Harry had been reaching out, shifting tectonic plates to give them another moment of together, before John had gone and pushed her away.
It turned out that, at first glance, Sherlock Holmes was odd-looking. Perhaps it was the smile, which really wasn't much of a smile at all. Or that his eyebrows were a bit too light for the dark curls that framed his face, and his cheekbones were high and prominent, stretching his too-pale skin. Maybe it was solely because John hadn't known what to expect, and with Harry beside him, he could hardly describe the boy as pretty.
“John-”
"Sherlock isn't a girl's name, is it?"
John nodded, wondering what sort of trouble Sherlock had given people in the past. He examined his plate again and realized he'd been separating the peas from the chicken like a picky little kid. Funny; he remembered always scarfing down what he was given back when he and Harry were small and Earth-bound. After another stab at the chicken, he cleared his throat, but wasn’t given the chance to excuse himself.
“A few weeks.”
“I love you,” came the muffled voice.
Thank God he'd included a return address out of habit.
The shifts in proximity were sometimes a matter of meters, but were usually better measured in centimeters, millimeters. After John had first chosen a seat of the sofa, invading Sherlock’s space, his territory, and yet in such a way that Sherlock found he didn’t mind, it had decreased to these small increments. A shift closer for a better view into the kitchen. A hand on his knee, once, as they both laughed about a man behind bars. The distance between their knees closing, until.
Sherlock hadn’t intended to fall asleep. And when he had, John rightly should have moved him. Shouldn’t have allowed him to slump against his shoulder, his face pressed into the crook of John’s neck. It was post-case, and several days devoted to the Work had left him frustratingly in need of sleep.
“John-”
He’d tested his boundaries slowly. Sherlock needed caring for, needed someone to remember that he still, in fact, had a body when he was far too engrossed in his calculations and deductions to take note of the fact. John made his tea, coaxed food into him, looked after him in small, unimposing ways. Sherlock rewarded him by letting his skies clear a bit when it was just the two of them, and John learned how to look through his outer atmosphere at the goings on below. He learned how to read his mood in his music, his movements, his habits. He began to piece together what he was at the core.
The girlfriends left, needless to say, and John stopped looking. He had everything he needed right at home. He was finally ready to admit to the fact that he’d be spinning circles around Sherlock for as long as he was permitted, and that nothing would make him happier.
“Thank you, Mrs. Hudson,” John said, with a polite smile meant to rush her on her way, and huffed as he finally sat and stretched. His leg hurt, for whatever nonsense reason it had found to do so, and his heart had decided to try and catch up with his nerves. Trust Starfleet to send him on a bloody beekeeping retreat. Mandatory shore leave had sounded bad to start with, but his superiors had been adamant, and he hadn’t been able to sidestep the orders. He was certain the ship's counselor had played a significant role in the decision as well. Somehow, he still hadn’t thought they’d go so far as to plant him beside a hive mind and call it good for his mental health.
Lips. Pressed into Sherlock’s hair, gentle affection. But it brought to mind what else those lips could do, and Sherlock finally pulled away, retreated. John would want to use them in those ways, would want more than Sherlock could give, if he wanted this at all. And he did seem to want Sherlock close. There had been a pleasing lack of girlfriends lately, an increase in fingers brushed together and pats on the back and “amazing, brilliant, wonderful.” Smiles which spilled rays of light.
"I'm serious. It's private."
There was only one answer to that.
If John went a bit pale, it was likely because of the missed meal.
"No, shut up!" John didn't know why it upset him so much, but the teasing suddenly wasn't very funny anymore, and John was up and moving. He had to get out of this room. He didn't particularly want to be in this house. "I'm not like you. Alright? I'm not. So, just, shut up."
“This choice is not one that you have to make. It would likely be best for you to move on to the next batch of dull women. But I want all the rest of it, if you’re willing to give up the sexual element.”
John watched the cottage for a moment, as if worried it might pounce on him, before taking the first step instead. It was that sort of a place, with vines up the sides and flowers almost overwhelming the walkway up to it. The hint of fairytale conjured up images of witches and wolves along with it, of lurking danger behind a picture perfect façade. The thick smell of the garden made him feel vaguely nauseated. After the sterility of deep space, it was no wonder the place had his senses reeling, and by the time he'd reached the front door, his eyes were watering from a sneezing fit.
John may not have been born to magical parents, but he'd quickly picked up on what was myth and what reality in the wizarding world. Accordingly, he, like any sensible person, didn't believe in the concept of soulmates. Not in the sense that there was one person in all the world who would be his perfect complement, at least. He certainly believed in love, but he'd seen love strip down and destroy as powerfully as it could heal. And yet, still, the spell awakened a spark of curiosity in him, and the effects seemed innocent enough. If performed correctly and if the right conditions were met-- and oh, there seemed to be far too many conditions-- then the name of his supposed soulmate would print itself onto the palm of his hand.
Sherlock had once called John a conductor of light. He’d been focusing on the wrong type. When it came to intellect, Sherlock was certainly a star, but in many other areas, John far outshined him. Perhaps they’d both formed from the same cloud of dust, perfect complements. John excelled at this, being a beacon of comfort, a certainty in a world which was hard to trust.
John had knocked on his door. Incessant, insistent. Sherlock burrowed under his blankets so that when John inevitably opened it, nothing could be seen. He let the moment pass.
It was clear that Sherlock didn't have very many friends, but then, neither did John. And the website didn't explicitly say that he was better than everyone, it just more or less implied it. Which, maybe he was. Maybe the research really was very advanced. For all John knew, he could be a genius. There was only so much that could be inferred from a website and a Facebook page.
His pulse. That had been next, a press of John’s fingers against his vein which had morphed into something else. John’s palm had pressed against his own, fingers curling around his hand, only for a moment. A squeeze, for what… reassurance? That was hardly necessary, as Sherlock was perfectly fine, if perhaps a bit lightheaded. Nothing that biscuits and tea couldn’t cure. Honestly. John was behaving as if he’d collapsed, when the room had only gone a bit grey for a few seconds. Silly.
If you want to be my beta-reader, please let me know! I need someone to assign me deadlines or I won't do anything.
John had said it primarily to be polite, but a bashful duck of Sherlock’s head made him rethink his priorities. He gave to garden another look—a closer one, this time, so that he’d have questions.
“You’ll want to rest,” she sighed, coming to his rescue. She had a fluttery way of moving her hands about that didn’t help him to clear his head of insects. “You've had a long day, I imagine. I’ll call when your tea is ready.”
“It’s amazing that you helped plan this whole garden. I didn’t realize you’d been here that long.”
And all of this, all of the coaxing and cajoling and caring, had somehow taken center stage. The people around them would notice, would point out how thoroughly John had devoted himself to Sherlock, which would bother him, because they didn’t know anything about it. They didn’t know the mournful cadence which signaled a bad day, nor the look in Sherlock’s eyes when everything was too loud and too much and he needed someone close. They didn’t understand that John wasn’t waiting to snog him silly, but rather to hold him in his arms as storms passed around them.
“This is…” John smiled sheepishly and glanced down at their hands. “This, here, with you. It’s the happiest I’ve ever been. And I know you’re married to your work, and all…. But, I just want you to know that, this is enough. The way we are now, it’s, well, brilliant.”
A release of breath. Sherlock’s thumb was stroking John’s hand. He waited, expectant, open, somewhat relieved already.
“That was Sherlock. You’ll have to forgive him. He lives in his own world.”
However, his current search held no weight of obligation, and so, inspired by that first letter he'd received from the magical world, John decided to put his faith in the ingenuity of his owl. His acceptance letter had reached him, after all, with no difficulty, despite the fact that his home had never been visited by an owl before, and he'd heard stories of children recruited from much more peculiar locations. Perhaps something could be accomplished with just a name. Even if the attempt was fruitless, he doubted any harm would be done.
He swallowed, eyes glancing down, then back. He wished that this weren’t necessary. He wished that he could breathe it all to John through a kiss, that he could give him all he wanted and more. John would always want the more.
If the library hadn't been so empty, John wouldn't have dared try it, but, unobserved and seeing little reason to resist, he gave in to his curiosity. Before trying it with his wand, he repeated the incantation under his breath a few times to make sure he had the pronunciation right. After all, he wasn’t ready to throw all caution to the wind. Once he was confident that he could deliver it correctly, he pulled his wand from his pocket and repeated it again, this time swishing the wand as specified.
With the aid of the wildflowers, the garden faded into the adjoining field. Past that was another cottage, then another, spaced well away. A starship full of people had a certain energy to it, constant and invigorating, but, here, insects seemed to be the main form of life. Industrious as they were, it was difficult to draw much inspiration from them.
Sherlock took longer than he normally would have to reply. Unfamiliar territory, John supposed. Still, he couldn’t help worrying. Perhaps he should have taken the previous retreat as more of a warning then he had done.
“I love you, too, you big idiot. That’s the point of this. You really should pay better attention.”
Fortunately, the silence wasn’t long enough for him to turn into a puddle.
“The pleasure’s mine, surely,” the man said in a practiced way. “Will you be staying long?”
”Sherlock,” he moaned quietly when he felt a hand closing around his own. ”Oh Sherlock, that feels so good.”
********************
”I really understand that you feel that way, Mary, and I’m very sorry, but as I said, I can’t help the way I feel,” he had repeated, again and again as she went on.
He thought about John. It was good, to be allowed to think about John without feeling guilty. He wondered what John was doing today. Thought that the world could never be too bad, as long as John Watson was out there somewhere. He smiled.
John tightened his grip through the trousers, pulled up and down as best as the barrier would allow, worked up a slow rhythm.
This very nearly drove Sherlock over the edge, even though the only direct stimulation he was getting was from the friction against the pillow underneath him. The slapping sounds of skin meeting skin filled the room, filled Sherlock’s mind.
”John Watson? What the hell are you doing here, mate? Haven’t seen you in years, you certainly pick your timing, huh!” He laughs. Greg looks surprisingly fine, John thinks, given the circumstances. Yes, he’s gotten a bit older as well - hair greyer than John’s, a few extra comfort pounds around his waistline - but all in all, it’s still the same Greg.
Sherlock’s breath hitched, his body froze. John knew that Sherlock’s mind was racing. His eyes were distant, he looked shocked and, well, scared.
John laughed again. ”I think it would be more accurate to say that you tried, love,” he giggled, causing Sherlock to shove him so hard he almost fell off the garden chair he was sitting in. And that was the thing that completely did John in. He was laughing so much now that it was difficult to breathe.
John’s heart skipped a beat.
Done his best to keep up the illusion of everything being the way it should; pretending that John had just… gone away on a trip or something. Day-to-day life was difficult enough as it was now anyway, without the bliss of a seven percent solution to help him get through.
To allow for the chance to feel love towards another person and to have it reciprocated. The simple act of sharing a bed, waking up together.
it plays on repeat in his head, again and again, as he keeps sorting and rearranging.
And that finally gets John moving. He’s pressing his lips tight together, straightens his back once more.
He had looked into that child’s face and suddenly realized she had John’s eyes. And John’s smile. It was John’s DNA, standing there in front of him. How peculiar it was, this circle of life.
”You’re shivering.” He squinted his eyes to see better in the dusky flat. ”And your lips are blue. God, Sherlock, you need to get out of those wet clothes right now.”
Sherlock felt himself getting absolutely overwhelmed with emotion. He could tell it was only a matter of seconds for both of them, now.
”But why now, though? I don’t get it! You’re married, right, and have a kid! You chose to move away! So why the fuck did you have to come back and ruin everything, just when it was starting to…! John, you have no idea of how much I’ve missed Sherlock, all these years. Can you imagine, what it’s like? To get another chance with someone you thought you had lost forever? Damn it, John, why!”
Both Mrs and Mr Holmes look up at him, at the same time as Sherlock appears in the door opening again. He looks like he’s back to his usual self, and in his hand he’s holding a tea mug.
“Mary,” he began. “I think I know to a great extent what you are capable of. I wouldn't dream of underestimating you. And I think you were right in what you said, about how that's a reason why I fell for you.”
”Alright,” John said, still just standing there. Sherlock swept his hand in the direction of John’s bedroom which got him moving. John took a few quick steps past Sherlock, but then suddenly turned around, came back.
Utterly surprised, the women eventually shuffled away, leaving Sherlock alone with John and the group of researchers. The youngest man in the group turned to Sherlock.
”I’m sure it will all be alright,” he'd said stiffly, cringing at the hollowness. ”You and Mary will, er, work it out, and everything will be alright.”
With every shred of incriminating evidence against Mary gone, surely they would be able to go on. Put the past behind them. Be able to live that ordinary, orderly life that John seemed to crave so bad. Of course he did. After all, who would want to spend the majority of their time in Sherlock’s messed up mess, in his pathetic excuse for a life?
”And then! Then I topped you!” Sherlock exclaimed proudly.
John dared to move his hand, ran it ever so slowly, up and down Sherlock's length, and Sherlock bucked up his hips to the touch, let out a soft groan.
However. He had not forgotten what it had led to, the last time he pushed ahead with his own needs. He’d made a promise, back then, to not be the cause of any more distress for Sherlock.
The Commander’s face turns a dark shade of red, small beads of sweat appearing on his temples, but he actually backs off again, stands there with his arms crossed.
”Earlier today, he was going on and on about how he insisted you get the spare room. And I told him that I would not hear any of it, because really, John. Can I be frank with you?”
And then, Sherlock could feel John’s nose and mouth touching the back of his neck, just below his hair line. Not kissing, just skimming.
”They were inseparable, right from the start. That dog followed him everywhere, slept in his bed. But then, there was the accident…” She pauses briefly.
At times he thinks he’s still not awake, that it’s yet another drug induced hallucination, but then John looks at him and there’s sadness and happiness in his eyes and Sherlock cannot make sense of that.
John relaxes, Sherlock feels the hand on his arm move up to his neck, where it curls beneath his hairline. John's other arm snakes around Sherlock, palm flat against his back. Same gentle rubbing; up, down, up. Fingers brushing through his hair in the back of his neck.
”Oh dear god, don’t even say that, Sherlock. No, of course not!”
”I’m coming-” John holds his breath, Sherlock can feel when he tips over the edge. The sensation of John’s warm semen over Sherlock’s hand and chest makes arousal shoot like electricity through his body again. Keeps slowly stroking as John comes down.
"I'm so terribly sorry for what I said, earlier. It was inexcusable. I hope you know that, ehm, that that's not at all how I think about you."
He tried hard not to think about John.
Sherlock’s eyes lit up. ”It wouldn’t work… but I suppose it couldn’t hurt you to try…” and then he blushed, and John thought it was so adorable he had to pull him down to lie next to him again, drew him into a kiss.
Maybe it was the fact that Sherlock still wasn’t back to his normal capabilities, after the previous night. But suddenly he thought that this young, bearded, trainer-wearing person perhaps wasn’t so bad after all.
John was still kneeling on the floor, nestled in between Sherlock's legs, and although that certainly was a weird position to have a heart-to-heart talk in, he was reluctant to start stirring too much now. No, not when they had this subject out in the open, talking about things they had never, ever touched upon before.
”And it sounds to me,” Dr. Riyat continued, ”like you don’t trust yourself to be able to survive another disappointment, yeah?”
But then there had been Mary. And then there had been Rosie.
From a distant place, John heard himself groan.
John’s knees were too weak to support him any longer, and he slid down against the tiles until he was sitting, shaking all over, gasping for breath, warm water still splashing over his head, and he hoped he hadn’t made any noises that Mary could have heard.
Mycroft tipped his head up, looked to the roof for a few seconds in an exaggerated gesture.
John leaned forward, very close into Sherlock's personal space, causing him to sit back as far as possible in his chair.
Oh God, oh God.
He had been careful to not let John know about this part of his past, though, when he’d suggested - no, ordered - this excursion. No need to let John know that this was actually pretty exciting.
John leans closer to see the details. It’s Sherlock, alright, only a much, much younger version of him. His hair impossibly curly, leaning almost a little bit towards ginger. Face much rounder, softer, but those silvery eyes unmistakable. He’s posing awkwardly in front of the church John recognises from last night. And, just like Mycroft described, he’s dressed in a long white robe with a cardinal red shirt showing underneath. A pleated white collar is sticking up so high it nearly touches his earlobes.
, he thought. Their bodies were connected; their minds too.
Sherlock’s words are flowing out in a rapid stream and to John, they are like water on burning oil, sending flames of overwhelming desire through his body. He puts more force behind each thrust, wants it harder, faster.
”Gorgeous,” John mumbled, as his hands moved over his almost naked body.
”Tread carefully with that heart of yours, brother dear,” he says quietly, making Sherlock finally lose his temper.
John takes off his jacket, hangs it up, then takes another look around the room. Oh Sherlock. How did this happen? John gets that familiar twisting feeling in his stomach again.
Sherlock was silent for a while, and John didn’t really know what to say. He was quite uncomfortable talking about this, but his mind was spinning at the new possibilities. And right now, he was standing next to Sherlock. Next to him, so close their arms touched, and maybe he could even dare to-
A memory pops up: Nine years old. Sitting in a wooden, uncomfortable chair outside the headmaster’s office, making out bits and pieces of his parents’ and teachers’ discussion about
”So,” he tried to keep his tone positive and light, ”I’ve told you about Mary. May I ask why you and-” he actually had a very real problem in even saying the name, ”Gabriel split up?”
The pain and guilt and emptiness he had felt after Sherlock’s death had been worse than anything he had ever experienced. Worse than the war, worse than coming back to civilian life after the war. Worse than when his mother had died.
For every second now, Sherlock felt more and more certain that this, what they had right now, might never return.
”Yes, love,” John groaned. ”That’s it. I love fucking you, you feel so fucking good-”
Having been told the breed, he was able to make a quick estimate of the dog's running speed and hunting pattern. His intimate knowledge of the park's topography made it possible to arrive at a rough approximation of where the dog might be located at this point.
,” Sherlock sighed dramatically, and as he’d hoped, got John to smile again. Addictive, it was, this man’s smile, those blue eyes radiating sunshine in the middle of the night.
He'd never before allowed himself to have sexual thoughts about a man. Sometimes, before the fall, when he still lived at Baker Street, his mind would try to throw Sherlock into his masturbatory fantasies, but John had always pushed those thoughts away with force.
“You're wonderful,” he said instead. “I’m the luckiest man alive.”
“I know it's normal!” John exclaimed, feeling quite annoyed all of a sudden. “I'm a grown man, for fuck's sake, and a doctor! But what's decidedly
They slowly manage to squeeze their way through the masses, past the bright lights and the cosmetics counter with the heavy scent of perfume in the air. Finally make it to the Asian restaurant at the fifth floor. Sit down at an empty table in a corner. John orders food, Sherlock only has a glass of red wine. Impossible to eat anything right now, obviously.
Sherlock felt like he wanted to hit John, shout at him, shake him. Instead, he just turned his back to him, sat on his knees on the mattress. Slowly, he let the open shirt glide down off his shoulders, reached his hands back to free himself from the sleeves, took it all off. He kept his eyes closed.
thought John.
The man had black trousers, similar to the ones Sherlock usually wore. Shiny black leather shoes, John could see the soles, looked like expensive shoes although John was certainly no expert. A city boy, John guessed, a banker, or perhaps a lawyer.
“Oh god, John,” he moaned, and the arousal in his voice made John feel dizzy. “John, yes, yes-”
the message reads.
”Er, no. I believe he’s in Brussels at the moment, but we said maybe next week.”
”Yes?” John’s fingers under the elastic of his pants. Sherlock’s speechless, so he just nods instead, once. Notices that his chest is heaving. In a swift motion, John pulls down his pants, Sherlock shakes them from his feet and then he’s standing there, in front of John, naked.
And once again, that dark and roaring jealousy gripped him. He was surprised by it, not used to feeling this level of possessiveness. Maybe his feelings for Sherlock had been more complicated, all along, than he'd realized?
On Thursday the following week, John texted Mike Stamford to ask if he wanted to meet up for lunch. He was desperate to find out more about what was going on with Sherlock, and Mike would probably have at least some small bit of information. They met at the sandwich place close to the hospital, took their food to go and went to sit down in the park nearby.
