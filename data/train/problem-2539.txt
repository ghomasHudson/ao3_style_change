“Did you mean for this to be a one-off?” John asks, voice tempered.
,” He sits back in the chair. He turns out his palms, smiling. Sherlock can see the crinkles in the corners of his eyes from across the plane of the desk, the crow’s feet. “Who would believe
Sherlock can scarcely breathe.
Sherlock wonders what the
They all look up at Sherlock as he approaches.
“Rider without a name,” he says, “Horse without a name. By his blood.”
Of all the luck and magic that brought them together, the shell intrigues him the most. How did it come to pass that John received it this year? And why? What would Sherlock wish for, if the shell had been gifted to him instead?
“Cat caught your tongue?” She asks, a grin full of teeth contrasting her dark lips.
only if they're made to work for it, to feel the thrill of tearing something apart.
Selfishly, Sherlock longs to try. To spit out the words,
Stopping, he blinks.
Maybe by Lestrade on occasion, but even then, who would Lestrade speak fondly to?
(The green eyeliner and shadow was the key, just like he’d been telling Donovan and Anderson.)
John tempts fate further, like looking a water horse in the mouth. “What is it that you want? It isn’t money.”
, would you stay?”
“Only those who open my case.”
John whistles, low. It's reminiscent of Stamford’s, back in Hawkin’s Tavern, the night Sherlock signed up for the Races. He wonders who took up the habit from whom.
“Throw her back.”
Moreover, it’s not quite a torrid affair. Neither is it a crime of passion. It’s premeditated, and Sherlock adores it.
Sherlock draws in a sharp breath through his nose. Never before has Moriarty articulated this so bluntly, so acutely.
Only marginally offended, Sherlock sits back. “This island has a peculiar sense of humor, then.”
” He tries not to think about the dead sheep in the road.
She widens her eyes, blinks. Her mouth pops open in surprise. She glances left, right, as though someone will overhear them, will know she's talking to a man that will soon be dead.
“It’s - wet,” Sherlock says bluntly, gesturing to his lower half and glancing at John. How else should he phrase it?
John stands suddenly, and dips his hand into his trouser pocket, but Sherlock can see there’s nothing in there. He looks back at Sherlock, a sudden darkness to his eyes. “My… jacket, do you have my jacket?” Sherlock jumps, swirls out of the kitchen and quickly leaps the staircase, taking them two at a time. John is fast behind him, past Mrs Hudson in the sitting room who shouts at Sherlock for flipping up the corners of the carpets from beside the hearth.
One more furtive look to the door.
Watson is silent. Until he isn't. “Lestrade’s got that wicked grey. Comfort. Unconquerable.”
He wonders why he didn't pick up that Watson was a winner of the Races before.
Lestrade steps down on the other side of the rock, greeted by a smaller man with a clap on his back, holding his sliced hand against his abdomen. The next rider steps up onto the mounting rock.
Sherlock crosses his arms over his chest, and tilts his head up, defiantly trying to look not so out of place.
The one on Mary.
“But you’re not close.”
Once, Sherlock thought it was because of his mainland heritage and his champion pride.
Redbeard happens to save him, then, by suddenly bucking his head down from Sherlock’s hold, leaving him scrambling to gain the reins back. The stallion squeals as Hydria and the chestnut prowl close.
He can’t go on because John works a second finger into him, evidently understanding Sherlock without the need for vocalization. It’s more of an intrusion, but the stretch makes his head fall back, and all complaints disappear. He can feel it in his stomach, a gentle tug on his cock, the opposition of the soft pushes inside of him.
The best solution reveals itself a split-second later. Naturally, John will have to accompany him to the crime scene. If John is with him, then, Mycroft wouldn’t be able to come over and collect his data bug, John won’t putter about the flat, and Sherlock will hear ‘outstanding’ again.
John is handling the reins at the front with expertise that comes from many years working with horses, many with this particular one, this particular sort. He does not look at Gladstone softly but with an edge, a warning and a threat.
“You’ve put a shirt back on,” John says.
“Move out of my way,” John demands, and the mainland photographers part for him, bleary-eyed and windswept. No doubt they will attempt to get more photographs of John, Thisby’s champion, bound to make a sixth sweep.
One rider in front of them tries to give his mount more rein, but the second he does, the horse streaks towards the ocean, and the rider wavers, tucking the
Hope’s point turns moot when Gladstone’s sinewy neck snaps towards him, and when his yellow teeth tear out Hope’s throat.
, John, and he’ll make a new plan to torment you. You don’t have to work for the Yard for him to find you. He’s still thinking. Since we met, you’ve been hurt because he was obsessed with me, obsessed over the fact that I cared for you, obsessed over my intellect. In his mind we are the same. You see? He’s
“When I saw Jefferson like that, I don’t know what came over me.”
There is no mistake about it, no backwards way around it. Moriarty knew he would be with John, here, at this hour. Henry was a convenient messenger, but Moriarty knew.
they’re related?” Because it all is theory until Sherlock proclaims it otherwise.
Finally, John smiles broadly, as if glad he managed to shut him up. He takes another drink from his beer, which, with his strong arms and the low light of the pub and the shadows and music from drums outside, make for a very manly picture. “Do you take the treatment from all the other champions?”
John walks straight to Gladstone’s stall, the one absent of iron or charms that work to create prisons for the other
Just as before, John climbs on. Sherlock raises him up to his shoulder, keeping his fingers tightly together lest John get caught in the cracks.
Prickling his skin is the cold, driving needles to his bones, icier as the wind blows, funneling through Skarmouth streets and buffeting them both and throwing John’s hair. It muffles his voice.
The black horse screams, violently twisting his head to snap his teeth against Mary’s.
The helmet-shaped purple blooming flowers by Archie’s wrist when he reaches across the counter to handle change, settled in the little pot that it is already beginning to outgrow.
“That’s…” John shakes his head. The lines appear over his brow as he thinks. His thought patterns are so loud that Sherlock can practically hear them. “That’s, you…”
The ride back to Skarmouth is uneventful. The clouds show no shadows on the grass or road, and whatever animal they had driven over last night has been cleared away, by human or otherwise.
“...Wish you were answering me. You always ask me what's going on and,” the voice softens, “how I worked it out.”
A short, blond man grapples with the giant mare, pulling on her leadrope and her mane, shouting strange words at her amongst the rest of the plainly panicked yelling from other people. The bells rattle loudly, and it's the only sound in the world as she rears again and snaps her head from side to side. Someone screams - the mare has bitten off someone’s fingers in her hungry prancing. A young man’s fingers, Sherlock believes, but then he is being touched.
, a red horse, some duns. No black.
This morning, when he left Sherlock’s house (or, Sherlock’s rented house, or Mrs Hudson’s house, with whom Sherlock was not involved with any more than in a mother and son relationship), the grass had been covered in frost outside. At the Stockyard, due to all the activity before and during the auction, it seemed like the frost had never been there at all. Even the flowerboxes and their plants seemed untouched by temperature, the houses and the stables all warmed for the comfort of American or European buyers.
(See the end of the chapter for
In his memory, Sherlock recalls sitting on the floor, toggling with John’s lead-carved belt.
He’s shouting something else now, something about the history of the island, and Sherlock is mostly not listening. He’s changed his attentions to the crowd, picking up life stories from the way the men - and they are all men, the racers - hold themselves, tilt their heads, or part their hair, and he’s trying to tell himself that he’s not at all looking for that one point of stillness in the crowd. Because he’s not. He sees someone make a cross over their head and shoulders, then do it again, backwards this time. Most gazes are locked on Fletcher.
Can’t you see?” He's desperately pulling at Sherlock's front jacket, shaking him closer. “We’d be amazing together. Unbeatable. Can’t you
Sherlock brings his hands up, and tries to move back.
Sherlock quirks his lips, eyeing the rider. He glances down, then back.
Sherlock rises and whirls to face the door, unable to come up with a valid excuse on the tip of his tongue. Belatedly, he drops the top of the tower to the carpet.
“Of course
“You drank more,” Sherlock accuses him. As much as his heart races for all the new possibilities that John’s letter has instilled in his mind, the cold is beginning to weigh on him. But he deduces that John, while tired, would still break into the station with him at a heartbeat’s notice. Twice in one night.
He makes it seem like they are meant to be hanging around outside the building, and when no one is in sight, Sherlock waves a hand to John. “Keep a lookout,” he says. He turns his back on the cobblestone streets and works open his long, black woven coat. The wind buffets them both, chilling to their bones, raising gooseflesh.
John's lack of modernization is more charming than irritating, presently. He didn't argue against the courtly romance guidelines. Interesting. Reading on the subject will have to be done. "When they need me, which is always. I've already said." Sherlock tucks the stray cat hairs into his pocket, patting it securely down. Will find a bag for that later.
John turns his head, then his body, looking around the flat. Sherlock stands, awkward and apprehensive but strangely concerned about what this tiny man thinks of his living space.
The moment Gladstone rocks forwards, Sherlock yanks back on the reins, instantly doubtful.
“And you don't…
The vein on John’s head tics. He’s angry, now. His whole body angles away from Sherlock. “Why
John grips his upper arms. “I know, Moriarty-- I know--”
“Once more, I know nothing of your brother. My figurine is a stand-in for me in your world - it’s to keep my place. I am real, and
“Uh-huh, thought that was what they were. It was there when I got back, after Hope. I meant to find you before the tavern to tell you.”
“It’s a reasonable solution.” Sherlock rushes, closing the distance between the sink and her chair in only a stride in the cramped space, “Anderson’s too insufferable to live without the cash, I’ll find Mycroft without leaving the island, and you’ll pay off the Stockyard.” He lays an hesitant, gentle hand on her shoulder.
He doesn’t even try to brush it away - although there may be some residual irritation that Sherlock hadn’t told him what had happened with Moriarty earlier, most of his thoughts towards the other man are gentle.
John tells him the rest of his interaction with Moriarty. The haggling for Gladstone, both of them like a common beach monger, the prices, the fairytale stories and the comments about Sherlock’s heart.
“Sherlock,” John says again, “what did he say?”
Sherlock doesn’t bother to pretend he’s annoyed at having been woken up. Doesn’t even act begrudgingly when John tips his head up for a kiss.
after the Virgin Mary. Isn't it funny?”
“Move, man, move!” Someone reaches down, pulling at Sherlock's frozen arm and forcing him to stand, guiding him backwards and away from the leaping horse and the shrill sound of the bells, away from the cliffside and the kelp-covered rocks, back to the sea, but Sherlock's eyes never falter from the mare and the man. There is blood on the white skin round her mouth, and the gold chain that had held her nose to the earth and to the sand and sanity has fallen to the beach.
are steadily being pulled from the scuffle as they become excited at the smell of blood and flesh and the sounds of a fight. He’s fixated on staring at the black stallion. Its long, gaunt face and haunting dark eyes stare right back. Sherlock feels a primal fear slide down his spine. The stallion’s nostrils are long and thin, to keep the sea out. Its eyes are black and slick; like a fish’s. This is what he's been seeing when he carts Redbeard past the Stockyard each morning.
Sherlock tunes in, the door downstairs groans open, and he whips around. His pulse thunders in his ears, white noise rushing around his brain. No, no!
The blonde mare has put him off too much. There's no way to quantify or expect their behaviors, they're too unpredictable.
John nods his head, and Sherlock carefully makes his way up the rocks while John brings the
The earth is still, the roads silent. Down by Skarmouth, the rubbish from the festival remains. Paper lanterns blown down by the wind out to the green pastures, remnants from dinners, plastic pieces around the houses on the outskirts of the town.
There's a list of racers.
How much blood will the sand claim in the morning? John could be taken, Redbeard, safe at home for this last night, could be felled. It’s not a difficult leap to make  - people want John dead. Gamblers, racers, envious islanders. Sherlock curls his fingers into the sheets between their bodies, tracking the lax lines underneath John’s eyes.
From a scientific point of view, he can't discern what it is, and it constantly makes him cross.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Yes, but he isn’t.”
Sherlock recalls Moriarty appearing when Henry Knight had, those weeks ago. How he said he’d read Sherlock’s articles in the paper, his tobacco ash dissertation. “You’ve mentioned,” Sherlock says, careful not to let on how much he remembers. Likely, Moriarty is underestimating him, and it would be in his favor to keep it this way. “Eat my heart out, was it?”
This is… highly improbable.
Finally, abruptly, the Stockyard owner looks up at him. There’s no need for him to squint against the pale sun like he had that day on the beach, after Hope had tried his best at handling Gladstone, and so his gaze is as full of fire as the day that they had first met, face to face, in the stables, with John, and Henry Knight. Even on the beach, there had been Moriarty’s stablehands about, placing charms and flowers and turning the sand, but now. Now, they are entirely alone.
“Yes. But don't tell Molly.”
Sherlock looks up.
John is amazing, brilliant, and true, in body and heart.
John’s hand on his nape massage the edge of his scalp gently, a poor attempt to bring them both back down to earth. His breath is coming in fast. “Sherlock-- Sherlock, I want nothing more, I

John clears his throat, “Your, ah, your—”
“You’re only saying that because your cheating wife ran off there to be married to the Skarmouth gym teacher and you still hold out hope she’ll return…”
Sherlock nods, resolutely calm. “I should, um,” Wonderful, he can already tell this is going to be wonderful, “I should thank you. For what you're doing for me.”
Sherlock digs his heels into Redbeard’s side, and he begins to lengthen his steps, streaking along the dirt roads.
The details jump at him as John fits his key into the lock, the small porch light flickering above. John closes the door behind them, shutting out the cold night and Moriarty’s reach. John does not turn on the overhead, allowing the room to be dimly lit from the softly glowing woodstove and the residual moonlight.
The Stockyard owner stares holes in John.

John takes a long breath. Cobalt eyes in the shadowed cavern connect with Sherlock’s. He replies, “I've been waiting my whole life for this.”
John meets his eyes, surprised. They both look at the cliffs.
push back into John. John pressed his lips against the back of Sherlock’s neck, just under the collar of his coat, before he had dismounted upon reaching their destination.
Sherlock stares at it, suddenly transfixed. It steals all the mystery in the room and exude its strange, soft magic in little pulses. He lifts his head.
His adversary is a dreamy silhouette, backlit by the hazy orange glow of Skarmouth far behind him. Sherlock stands with his back to the cliffs, the high ocean out beyond. The outline of his body shades Moriarty’s face until he comes closer.
The hands become arms, become powerful shoulders, become the man Sherlock knows is John Watson. This man helps him down from Redbeard when rain begins to fall, and Sherlock leans heavily into him, too exhausted to argue. Too exhausted to catalogue the safe feelings in the ivory box, locked in his mind.
That, and the events at the Scorpio festival, and the rider’s parade. He’s begun to form a profile on Watson, both of his history, his present, and most importantly, his personality, as barracuda-like as it may be. There’s a high moral code ingrained in Watson’s heart and face, along with a protective streak. Seeing him with the mare goddess, however… that interaction was more than cryptic, prompting more questions than answers.
“He has the proper resources. He wanted money in exchange for finding my idiotic brother. I can get money.” Sherlock reaches into the crate, withdrawing the small flakes of hay.
“Hold - hold, hang on,” John laughs, tucking his chin.
Sherlock answers, “It was your own horse that mauled you.”
Redbeard
Sherlock manages a dumb nod, eyes wet. “Yes,” he rasps when John doesn’t look to him. John is here, John is here.
If Sherlock hadn’t entered, John would have won Gladstone and the Races. Most definitely. If Sherlock hadn’t gotten involved, Moriarty wouldn’t have pulled the puppeteering strings on John so tightly. John’s working misery was due to Sherlock’s selfish fixation on his employer. He's a danger to John, as long as Moriarty lives.

He draws the reins back so far that Redbeard begins to back up, tripping over his own back legs and gangly rear ankles.
For one horrible moment, Sherlock pictures them tumbling to the sand and being dragged to drown, but Redbeard darts on, quick and small and steady.

“With John? Ha, no, sorry, I’ve known him for a very long time, but I don’t think anyone’s close with
Moriarty smiles again, eyes downcast to pull another, thinner case from his pocket. How benign he had seemed at first. Never more, Sherlock sees the intelligence behind those dark eyes. It rivals his own. It is too bad that Moriarty is insane. He might have, once, been someone to talk to. “I’ll have you stop lurking around my Yard.”
let me know if this pulled on your heart, that was the goal...
“That means the beaches.”
this doesn’t mean what Sherlock thinks it does?
“If he does buy her,” Watson goes on, sitting back on Gladstone, broadening his shoulders, and looking like all the world is there for his taking, “I’m making sure she won't ever be waterfront after this year. She's already killed two men down there.”

It seems louder than the crash of the drums, thrumming loudly a few corners over. It seems louder than anything else in the world. When he’s out of sight, Sherlock turns back to the corner where the conversation took place, but the mare goddess is gone, off to scatter sand and pebbles somewhere else on the island.
Without a word, John approaches the body. One push with a disgusted shoe, and Moriarty slumps forever over the island edge. The splash doesn’t come, distant thunder covering above. Had John planned this, shooting Moriarty? How did John know where he was? Why does John

Sherlock twists his fingers into the bedsheets before him, watching morning turn the sky grey-violet in the beginnings of a breaking sun through the lone window. The room warms in pink slowly, and John stirs behind him.
It was him, Moriarty, looking for Gladstone that night, and instead finding Beryl. It was his dagger that sealed her fate by drawing her blood, his hand that drew the iron line across the inside of her thigh, slicing the perfect weapon with a practiced expertise.
There are men around, chatting with one another. Locals, people born of Thisby, speaking tightly and quietly with crates of capture supplies sitting around: nets, strings of bells, iron-pleated harnesses. They are waiting for water horses.

Above Gladstone’s high shrieks, Sherlock demands, “Who sent you to the cliffs?”
Sherlock is twisting his fingers in Redbeard’s rust-red mane, “Yes.”
“The racing festival? What’s happening when the Races come around?” Molly asks. She takes the basket of stale rolls into the back. Sherlock follows, like he usually does when talking to her, avoiding the swinging back door and the boundaries she's laid out with everyone else. The whole place smells tantalizingly of honey and herbs.
“I've seen old
In doing this, John has dragged himself very close to the reaching waterline, and the effects are written all over Gladstone’s figure. Where once his hooves slapped down without flinching, his legs begin to tremble slightly, and he leans closer to the ocean than he does the cliffs. He’s so far ahead that it doesn’t matter, but the danger of hitting the water and drowning John is present. Was present.

Terror grips Sherlock. “John. Do - do you still… what you said. On the beach.”
in front of them darts closer to the water, and Redbeard sweeps past it, charging hard despite Sherlock pulling desperately on his bit that the leather might snap. White noise is hissing in his ears, the roar of the crowd.
“Change, you prick. I’ll see if I can get the heater going.”
It’s a bloody smear on the beaten path, entrails and insides dragged all the way across the road, littering it with chunks of meat and thick streaks of clotted crimson red.
. It was all over his file. You didn’t notice that?”
John looks at Sherlock over his shoulder, widening his stance and standing defiantly on Sherlock’s hand. He settles his hands on his hips, brushing aside his cloak - waiting. The seconds of alone-time tick by in an unstoppable counter in Sherlock’s head. Sherlock nods a slight apology.
They walk to the side of the cliffs, as close as they dare. The last thing Sherlock needs is for the chalk to crumble below their combined weight and deposit them on the sharp rocks and high tide below them.
Pull up ur bootstraps bc it’s halloween soon, the perfect time to ready this spooky story. I’m also thinking of, when this is soon complete, starting a new fic, although I’m not sure if it should be a new AU or some case-fic!
“What is that?” John asks. He leans out of Sherlock’s scarf, holding onto a fold of fabric for balance as though he’s a sailor rigging lines, coming into Sherlock’s periphery. Sherlock glances at him out of the corner of his eye. So close like this, he can see the expressions on John’s face with greater clarity - curiosity, bewilderment.
John’s foot comes between Sherlock’s. Sherlock follows his bend forwards, watching stiffly as John raises a hand. It hovers in the air between them, a stroke away. “You keep... acting as though he was the end-all-be-all. You’re the most amazing thing to ever happen to me. I’ve never met someone like you, and I’ve met a lot of people.” John hates all the people at the Stockyard. Sherlock’s mouth quirks belatedly up at the corner.
He sees through Sherlock’s mind, just for a moment, as those predestined to each other often do. The back of a cab, before John’s world fell to the pavement with blood streaking beautifully over his haunting face. Moriarty says, in the glitching screen, through his cat eyes and crinkly grin, “But that wasn't the final problem.”
Sherlock blinks. Why?
He pops his collar.
Sherlock had been charmed the first time he met John, back with the blonde mare and the way she’d torn apart the dog. Most importantly, the way Watson had calmed her. He'd bullied her into cooperating, whispered words of the sea and the sand into her demon-like ears. And then he’d used the iron to keep her grounded. He’d been in awe, watching his practiced way of moving through the tavern. The cleft of his chin. The confidence he signed up with.
Perhaps Sherlock should not relax, either. Perhaps it is Jefferson Hope, come to drive him and Redbeard out of the Races for good.
Sherlock is already beginning to hyper-focus on the envelope. Halfheartedly, he replies, “Yes.”
Sherlock turns. Behind him, not in line, is Father Stamford. Seeing

“If you want the dead horse, you’ll have to go fishing.” At this rate, the Ford will rust before he ever gets back to it.

Moriarty is finally starting to get interesting.
The beach smells of dead fish and hot blood. Sherlock wipes at his face, smearing the dog blood across his cheek, and the sand that has stuck to it into the crease of his lips. The salt burns the cut on his lower one. Bells jangle as the bowler hat yanks the blonde mare away, his face purple and angry.
can go.
Wealth and power but no
“Could just be a sleepless night?”
“And you, Inspector.” John shakes it. Sherlock has the sense that they both knew the other, but had never met. Both were fairly well-known figures around Thisby. A name without a face on a very small, cold island.
“Thank Epona for that, huh?” John removes a flat pan from the cabinets, shuts the wooden door with a click that is consumed by the wash of rain, beating at the roof and at the window. At least now the room is warming up, the skin on Sherlock’s bare legs wouldn’t stand the cold. “Gas burner,” John comments absently, putting the pan over such thing. Sherlock listens to the
“Mrs Hudson?” He pushes the door. It's locked, so he takes the key from his pocket and slips inside. “Mrs Hudson?”
Sherlock heaves Redbeard farther inside. Saltwater sprays and the sand whips at his cheeks, magicking everything rough and red and angry. The reins are tough and hard in his grasp with hard salt crystals, and the wind rushes ceaselessly past his ears. He squints, heart hammering as a grey bodied-
John runs an anxious hand through his silver hair. Unsettled, he walks a brisk circle on Sherlock’s palm. Clearly, there is some internal debate waging war through his head.
“You’ve only revealed yourself to the person that opened your box in the past, if that’s true, you’ve hidden from everyone else, and my associate is coming upstairs, so
a mystery?”
What could that man gain from him not wanting to race? He couldn’t consider Sherlock actual competition.
“Epona above,” Lestrade curses, looking to the sky before running a hand over his face. Sherlock scowls again. “You said you’ve solved it?”
“You know. The mare goddess and I.” John’s voice keeps low, hushed, like they are being watched. The barn workers move all around the beach. Sherlock now sees what they are doing, sticking flowers into the chalk cliffs, sprinkling iron shavings and blessed papers into the shallow water. The flying seagulls harshly cry out as they ride the wind above, then move as a flock somewhere back out of sight and towards Skarmouth. They surely feel the sand thrown at their faces just as much as Sherlock and John do on the sand, cold biting at their hands.
Sherlock nods noncommittally. Archie, he likes to think, has always been fond of him. It likely helps that Molly is equally, if not more fond of him, and probably tells Archie nice things about him. Hopefully, he is living up to whoever Molly dreams him to be.
“I could find out where he’s gone, Mister Holmes,” Anderson cuts him off, sneers and leans forward. His breath is sour, has always been sour. “With the right incentive.”
Evermore, Sherlock scowls. John is very funny, but the murder case presses insistently on his mind.
If he looks carefully, into the shade of this night, it’s like Anderson’s shadow is there now, at the edge of the land, face streaked dark in charcoal.
, he’s only saying it under the guise of it being someone else’s words. This is John’s protection. “I’m not staying for very much longer.”
Henry says, “I think I’d like to get off, now.”
He’s got a reserved smile on his face, as if that’s the only way they could ever end up - in love.
stare at you, but that’s for personal reasons.”
Sherlock twists his mouth into a pout. There is nothing appealing in that line of thought. But it does make one thing clear: John cannot remain here unattended. Sherlock could set up his laptop camera and face it towards the courtyard of the castle and video while he’s gone, but he’d be able to do nothing if John manufactured a way to scale the walls.
“John Watson. Isn’t it.” He's admitting to looking. Damn.
The water surges against Sherlock’s abdomen, and he holds up his arms to avoid getting the sleeves of his coat wet as if it matters. The origami gulls have gathered in number, all crying out the famed headlines, fluttering like the paper they are in the wind.
“Do hurry. We’ve not got all night.”
one. The old witch, the poisoned apple, the deep sleep. But I think my favorite part,” Moriarty cracks the book back open, leaning back on his chair. Sherlock glances at an embellished letter opener on his desk.
"I began by stating that your brother was careless. When you observe the lower part of that watch face, you notice that it is not only dented in two places but it is cut and marked all over from the habit of keeping other hard objects, such as coins or keys, in the same pocket, when it was only a pocket watch. Surely it is no great feat to assume that a man who treats an expensive watch so cavalierly must be a careless man. Neither is it a very far-fetched inference that a man who inherits one article of such value is pretty well provided for in other respects.” Sherlock pops the last syllable.
“My mobile
A ruckus across the bar, someone spills a drink, and more ice cold glasses of whisky and scotches are handed out by a waitress in a thinning dress. Sherlock rolls his eyes.
It’s the first time in many years that he’s feared for his own, as well as the stallion’s. Perhaps somewhere, deep and locked and chained down in his mind, his brain has found something interesting, something Sherlock has not yet had a chance to study.
“I’m right. He's not afraid to take back the house once--”
-- and everything freezes in place.
“Who let you into the house? Or did you take it upon yourself to barge in, ever the good officer?” Sherlock is pleased that his voice is as low as usual, though it is a tad rough from sleep. He collapsed into it merely a few hours ago, having been working on a
John holds his ankle gently and works off one shoe at the end of the bed and Sherlock toes the other off for him, growing impatient. Not for a conclusion, but for John to fit nicely on top of him again. John shifts up, kneeling between Sherlock’s legs. Sherlock’s breath goes shaky, ever so slightly out of time with the beat of his heart, when John’s palm brushes over his cock. It’s electric, somehow far dirtier than their literal grinding. John squeezes, pressing the heel of his hand down on his trousers in the parody of a stroke.
“You don't understand. I can't take this. You handed it to me. You've given it to me before.”
“Then you have to promise. You really do.” John opens another cupboard, removing a box of tea. From another, a teacup and saucer. And then an unfashionable mug.
John is nowhere. He was meant to cross the finish line with Sherlock.
Finally, after so long so close, Sherlock takes a step away, “
The house smells like garlic and simmering-something when Sherlock strides in. He listens, shutting the door quietly behind him, silent until he hears the soft radio music from the kitchen downstairs. He will return to his room and retreat into his own head, but first it would do to explain himself to Mrs Hudson, as vaguely as possible.
The concern has always mostly rested on Redbeard’s life.
He shoulders his way through, not stopping short of outright shoving a few slow men that don’t get out of his way quick enough. His heart races as quick as Redbeard had, pounding in his ear as the sea hushes to him.
“How complicated is it?”
He throws the reins over Gladstone’s head as the stallion ducks it, rounding to Gladstone’s massive shoulder to hand them up to Sherlock.
“Oh, you’re seething.”
like rider’s sweat and disappointed, fearful nerves. He knows there's sand in his hair, clothes, and all over his skin, rubbing him raw in all the wrong ways. He knows he smells like the enemy.
Sherlock is stupid, he should’ve recognized the direction they were headed out on the cliffs at sunset. It’s past dusk now, though, and the dark is heavy and tiring, there’s a pull in his heart to submit to it. They must meet Mike Stamford, and then Sherlock must go to Moriarty. Then. His face heats,
He bends at the waist, poking through the storage. Calligraphy ink, aged tin boxes with paper memorabilia, a packet of collected stamps. He pulls open another drawer with a worn handle. "Ah!"
“He’s alright?”
Sherlock’s eyes plummet to a spot behind Redbeard’s ear.
It’s really all he has, these brief moments of touching contact. John offering his arm while they watched Beryl step into the ocean for the last time, John taking his hand during the storm, at the pub. Now, with John’s capable fingers gripping his arm tightly, Sherlock stays down, listening to quiet footsteps.
The man removes another pack of cigarettes from his breast pocket, and slips the end of one between his teeth, holding it there. He lights it with the quick strike of a match, and Sherlock breathes in the smoke. “The boys, we would all say we saw them, down by the cricks. To scare our sisters. Everyone was told never to go to the water alone, a lot like here. But they would be near the water always, nothin’ seasonal like here. There was a farm,” he said, “up on the hill. An older man, a sculptor, lived there - never made anything except horses out of wood. We all knew he'd seen the kelpies, but he never said anything to anyone in the town.
“Doesn't mean you don't need one,” Hope’s grin never leaves his face. The light’s not right, however, so Sherlock can't tell if the expression is born out of sadism or genuine amusement. He stares at the bruise. “A little birdie told me you fancied having a trip to the mainland. Looking for your big brother, then, eh?”
John shakes his head. “Brilliant.”
like Thisby’s horses. Tricks remind him of Mary, hunting reminds him of Gladstone.
Ahead is Moriarty and an unidentified man. Moriarty raises a shotgun to something Sherlock can’t see, past a line of broken fences. The scream pounds in his head. John has to give up his hold on Sherlock in favor of pulling Gladstone into a stop. This is not easy, the water horse is ready to charge away, over cliffs, and into the sea.
Another illusion drawn by Moriarty. As if Thisby isn’t always cold and unwelcoming. Thisby cares nothing for love and only for bravery.
What is
Slipping from John's sleeping embrace is difficult, because John acts like space heater and the rest of the flat is cold, as well as the fact that John has pinned his waist. Sherlock must, sadly, pry him off.
It should settle him, this ease into island life, these sounds of home, but he’s unable to grasp how wrong it is to hear these drums at this time. There’s a mass of unwelcome tourists pouring around him.
a favor for when John came in search of Sherlock and the envelope.
He returns to the castle with a tissue, ripping off a piece and setting it down in the courtyard. He crumples up the rest and tosses it somewhere in the flat.
Purposefully, Moriarty moves, edging his chair nearer to the desk. He waves his fingers in a disinterested manner, a dismissal at him, gesturing to close the door. The door closes behind Sherlock with a click; a wall formed between John and him.
is happening, it… doesn't mean anything else. Sherlock swallows. No. He can't think that right now. He can do that later.
John steps in, an absolute hero and recovering from his earlier miff, “Actually, Mrs Hudson, Sherlock said it was alright if I spent the night here? I did fish him out of the quay.”
Mrs Hudson is downstairs in the kitchen cellar, fumbling around several verdant oranges by the sink. The strings of dried herb bundles dangle precariously over her head, and along all the tops of the walls. There’s too much stuff, and too much tidying. Sherlock sniffs, and makes sure to step on the creaky steps to alert her of his presence. He’s fairly certain she knows he’s here anyway, she’s got that sort of sixth sense all elderly ladies seem to have.
With no more bucking, Sherlock surges forward, and Redbeard gives it everything, head lowering. Sherlock crouches on his back. Curses his long legs, and he presses them ever further into Redbeard's rusted coat, both pressuring the horse to run faster and trying to make himself ass small as possible.
Under his clothes, the bumps of an job done up ugly are visible to those who look closer. And he doesn't use the hand of this arm, either, further proving that something is wrong - only, Sherlock knows the cause is a bullet wound. His boots are covered in wet sand from where he has stepped in the ocean and then again on the beaches, fighting only with half his strength.
“Er - not sure if that’s very clever for tonight.”
John looks at him. It's awkward because they're sitting next to each other. Sherlock pretends there is a stray fiber on the seam of the sofa and rubs it lightly with a finger, avoiding John's searching eyes. They're dark blue in the night-cast shadows of the small sitting room.
Sherlock rearranges himself, fitting John’s front against his spine. John tucks his hand beneath Sherlock’s hip, curling close. They could just as easily turn over, but Sherlock falls restlessly asleep before he starts an argument.
He squints. It's not Adler in the costume. He's unsure of who it
At the thought, he absentmindedly put a few lone pencils and one calligraphy pen into an empty wet teacup. The lip of it was so low that the utensils spilled out. Sherlock didn't replace them. Merely cursed them, and the castle, and Lestrade.
Mike manages, “It’s just, Mr Haverford, I’ve come across something rather… unsavory, you know.”
“Then you wouldn't mind taking a gamble on her.” Sherlock watches the mare, every twitch of her laid-back ears is a tell in the misty day.
"Showmanship
to race with? He has savings, but nothing enough to buy one of those overpriced mounts.
He needs to deal with the figurine-come-alive.
John smiles, “Think you can change your clothes?”
drags him out into the ocean and under the surf.
John is utterly unique to anyone Sherlock has ever met.
There’s never been anything more sickening than what he’s hearing now. The way eyes stare and heads turn. This is it. They’re going to kick him out of the Races. Sherlock’s face sears with heat, his skin three sizes too tight. Fault lines like tectonic plates crack in his skin, he can feel embarrassment seeping out, though his expression holds neutral.
) and goes.
Redbeard is restless in his stall. He’s knocking his velvety nose up against the stall door when Sherlock comes in. Sherlock unlatches it and Redbeard knocks it open with the broad of his chest. His hooves clap on the stone, and Musgrave is nearly crushed. She hisses, and Sherlock frowns at her. “Shut up,” he says, and she sits.
Then the kettle squeals.
The scream is getting closer. Sherlock presses as close to John as he dares - John responds, wonderfully, by sliding one of his arms around Sherlock’s waist, pulling him tighter against him. Sherlock thinks this is for his own benefit before he feels that John’s arm is shaking slightly, and his other is strained against the lead as Gladstone drags them further into the black, veins on the back of his hand prominent even in the low light.
Something wails again.
The grey

As John finishes writing something, which Sherlock spots the words ‘
” John shoves his cloak aside and touches the scabbard by his hip. “This is the size it’s meant to be. In relation to
John sucks in a breath that Sherlock feels against his lips. He returns the pressure, kissing the corner of John’s mouth with a newfound gravity, and the short stubble above John’s lip makes Sherlock’s mouth tickle, dragging lavishly and reddening his pale skin. It makes him feel raw.
Sherlock takes the reins, and is nearly blown away by the power he can feel, bridled inside of them.
“Your watch.” Sherlock answers swiftly. It occurs to him that Watson really doesn’t have any right to ask after his expression, but he’ll humour the man, all the same.
Sherlock turns round, purposely letting his face fall to a neutral expression upon seeing her. If he shows even the slightest emotion, she gets far too excited for his liking.
No. Unrealistic. What is this tiny man? John Watson, the Golden Knight, fine, but certainly not
“Keep to the shoreline, as near as you can be, and you’ll have it.”
“Just having you on, here you go. I prefer scotch, anyways.”
John looks at him, one hand tracing patterns along Gladstone’s rapidly sharpening jawline.
is the word. But that can’t be right, either.
“Do you…” John starts, then trails off. His brows knit into a nervous line, as if his confidence is wavering. He reaches to softly touch the buttons on Sherlock’s coat. With a dexterous, lazy movement, he works them open and pushes the swaths of his coat apart, dipping his thumb into the creases of their holes at Sherlock’s collar. “Let’s… get this off, then.”
He breathes, gently, shakily, without disturbing the peace, as if to try to convey some semblance of any of that, while knowing it is impossible to vocalize, “John.”
“Get out!”
“Sherlock,” John warns. “You don’t understand him. That’s nothing about your cleverness, it’s how he is. He wants to use you.” John shakes his head. “He uses everyone. You already said it was
“Sherlock, what--?”
“I suppose no one will mind when he goes missing,” Sherlock says. He's desperate to get John to say something back.
The whistle comes again, followed by a bark of laughter and, “Ho, Sherlock Holmes!”
Closer up front, to the door, he can hear the sound of John shuffling through papers, but by the continuous sound of it, he hasn’t found anything of note.
Sherlock looks at him, his undersea eyes mere grey in the sickening hospital lights. “Waited for what, John?”
And he remembers the answer he got back two months later. It meant Mycroft had hesitated to put pen to paper, and missed not one, but two monthly deadlines of the ferry that delivered mail to the island.
He kneels, pulling the cover off of one box and setting it aside with a small tap against the flooring, setting himself upon the papers and handwritten folders within. Scowling, he puts the lid back on the first box, because it only held correspondence that dealt with officers themselves, though he does pocket a few of Anderson’s overdue notices, just for fun.
, doesn’t it?”
John throws his hands up, exasperated. “Were you not going to tell me any of this, if I hadn’t asked?”
The face is also carved, not just painted on like some sort of Russian nesting doll. Sherlock can hardly make out the details in the dark. But he sees spots of blue, dry and empty and unfocused for the eyes, a small curve up of black and soft pink for a smirk.
“Yeah. Let’s go.”
Hope is a dangerous sentiment to feel, overwhelms the logical mind, but it’s thrumming under his skin as they overtake another rider together.
Just there, the corner of a faded envelope, and a seal that he cannot make out from the poor quality, save for a glossy, trademarked
He’s seen it a hundred times over in the broken bodies of those young and in love, or bitter and jealous, or old and foolish, or those who simply happened to get in between the wrong two people. Sherlock drums his fingers against the mattress gently to not rouse John, appreciating his tan and the blond of his lashes flitted against his cheeks. Sherlock would hate to see the shape of someone who stepped between him and John.
Finally, strong hands from above find purchase on the fabric over his shoulders, and they drag him up and over the edge. He spits out the papers onto pavement, sure they won’t blow away because they are weighted down just as much as he is by wetness. He hauls himself onto the street completely, using the nearby railing to push up.
“Alright. Christ.” John’s cock slips between his cheeks, applying a light nudge to Sherlock’s hole. Sherlock has the short-lived, sickening thought of John being physically unable to fit inside of him, but something gives and John presses an inch of his cock in. His grip tightens on John’s arms as John blows out a relieved, warm breath over Sherlock’s chest.
It’s quicker this way, he rationalizes a moment later when John taps his stomach to prompt Sherlock to lift his hips, better that John undress the both of them because Sherlock certainly cannot be trusted with anything involving coordination.
Sherlock notices the strands of long brown hair misplaced behind her ear as they approach the counter. Her ponytail is resting lower than usual, swept over one of her shoulders. He bends to one side, hands in his pockets, peering under the counter to get a view of her shoes. Yes, she’s wearing the same socks as yesterday. He draws in a very deep breath through his nose. John looks at him strangely.
He keeps quiet. John meets his eyes for a moment, a lighter wash of blue tide, and they then slip away, focusing instead on the figure walking towards them both.
” She repeats, as though she is in charge of whatever he does. She wipes her hands on her apron, stepping bravely out into the street. “It's dark out— it’s
and John twists his wrist.
He strives to catalog every point of contact between the two of them, John's powerful upper arms, used to holding beasts ten times his size, tucked delicately beneath Sherlock's arms. John's knees resting against Sherlock, on both sides, keeping him where he is. John’s stomach slotted against Sherlock's lower back. John's chin, ducking forwards to rest over Sherlock's slumped shoulder. The last one is a new development. John's soft breath is ghosting over one of Sherlock's ears.
Curious, Sherlock asks, “What other books were there? The names,” and then he feels angry at himself for not demanding an answer very angrily, like he might’ve done of Lestrade. Asking so softly is to shout his feelings for John. His mouth thins, lips twisting begrudgingly into an unbecoming line.
"I’ll have to conduct all of these reports in the morning. Sherlock, and over the next few days,” he adds. Sherlock finally looks away from John, back to being fascinated with his case. “The pictures and the toxicology reports are back at the station, in the notary’s office. I’ll bring them to you first thing in the morning.”
He looks up, and his eyes are caught on the
Sherlock bolts upright. He brushes down his coat that has dusty white patches from the flour in some spots. He’s not afraid of Archie seeing him a little messy and worse for wear from time to time, partly because Archie isn't aware that it's not his usual state. He's always somehow a mess in front of the young boy. But the rest of the island cannot view him like that. To them, he is as cold as the deep waters of the ocean.
up close
It’s such strange magic, Sherlock thinks, how John Watson has been steadily consuming his life, beginning at the moment they met.
Sherlock is starting to think he knows more about Moriarty than he previously thought. Richest man on the island, neck-deep in the most dangerous game.
The old porch creaks under his feet. The pasture grass dotted with morning dew soaks his bare ankles, wet droplets ready to be evaporated by a sun that has not yet risen on the most horrifying day of the year. Gathering clouds stripe across the sky, the stars are more visible out here than they are by Skarmouth. The cold grips him round the middle and nips at his ears.
There is a glint of something shiny covering the pelt on her flank, beneath the burnt emblem of the
“Perhaps a bit tipsy. Maybe then I'll get you to open up.” A pregnant pause, Sherlock's cheeks start to color. John stumbles, losing his composure for the first time in awhile, because his face has dropped. He coughs, “About the Races. About why you're racing.”
Sherlock fumbles for an answer with John’s warm grin stretched so near to his face. “You brought this up entirely just to say that.”
“Where were you?” Sherlock demands the moment John arrives. His long black boots have been cleaned, and his waistcoat conceals the chest of his long-sleeved white shirt. His tanned wrists and face are of great contrast to the white fabric, which only makes him look more strapping.
he wanted. Now, he’s going to get you, he’s going to have you under his hand, if you can’t manage to remember that.”
Everyone in this house is out to get him. Including the cat.
“No, but act like we are, and nothing will happen.”
Sherlock glances to the flat’s door. He hopes he isn't going mad. Perhaps he is. He says to the knight, not loudly, “I'm not a giant. You are very small.” He settles on his knees.
John snorts, hissing under his breath as not to alarm Mike, “An
” The blond man yells, his voice deep and throaty, “Back
“You’re the senior rider with the most fingers left. Would you like a medal?”
Sherlock ignores the bait. “I’ve come to bargain.”
The ride is quiet, and the evening sky is overcast, clouds hanging grey and withholding high above. The ocean must be a mess tonight; the wind won’t leave Sherlock’s hair or Redbeard’s mane alone. It’s a live, starving thing, making shutters flap and slap against house walls, and throwing leaves and twigs across the road.
“Sherlock?” John interjects.
He squints at them anyways, held in frozen fingertips, until they hit another bump in the road, and Sherlock looks to John. John shakes his head,
"What?" John asks. Sherlock slides out a pastel pink day planner, flipping open the slim book. Michaela Shadwell's name is inscribed in the 'if found' section, along with her address and mobile number. Exactly what he was looking for. Sherlock doesn't answer John directly, but the knight seems satisfied with the reveal anyways.
Sherlock grinds his teeth. “She had the sigil drawn on her flank. Same as the mare from last year, the one that ran into you, caused Gladstone to bite. Moriarty arranged to have them both drawn to goad the mares into attacking you. You were -
“Are you afraid of him?”
) drops onto his forehead, and he blinks up to John’s face. Sherlock should’ve recognized the displacement of weight on the floorboards and anticipated this. John drops another kiss on his nose, and swipes an unkempt curl out of Sherlock’s vision. He’s put his pants on, but Sherlock can see the creases where it was crumpled on the floor all night. “You’re posing.”
Sherlock blows in his ear. John smacks him with a pillow. It’s all the most wondrous thing that’s ever happened to Sherlock.
“He has someone inside the officer’s station. He wouldn’t have been able to steal the letter after the photographs were taken any other way.”
,” He spins the pen. Then, he gestures to the chair before him. “You may sit. If you can.”
It's a few moments before Sherlock recognizes that he means
Movement. Sherlock stares.
“Yes, Anderson, I can read.”
This is peculiar, because the line of questioning implies that Moriarty already knows what Sherlock desires, and that Sherlock is the one in the dark.
(See the end of the chapter for
“You are very excited by the prospect of shrugging off your
Sherlock and John are nothing at all, they don’t exist, not while Gladstone is galloping with merely half his might, as if this is nothing more than a walk in the meadow. Redbeard could never match this. He couldn’t dream of it. If Gladstone’s hooves were any sharper, they would pulverize the island below them and turn it into wet mush.
“You’re certain.”
when they have an item they believe he would purchase.”
over and over and over again.
Anderson affixes him with what is surely meant to be a withering stare, but with his cheek twitching so irritably, it comes off as revoltingly insecure. How bad it must feel to have an outside consultant do your job better. Sherlock smiles tightly, self-assured, and crosses into the foyer of the house with Lestrade.
“It’s a good night to be on land,” Someone mumbles, hard to hear around the shouted bouts of conversation and the tinkling of bell charms all around. It's so close to his ear that Sherlock almost mistakes the words as being meant for him. On one of the side streets, some boys are gathered around a small tire that is on fire.
, Sherlock thinks,
He's infuriated by Moriarty. Infuriated the man would take the island priest’s car up to Mrs Hudson’s home and sit down in the cellar with her and Mrs Turner, infuriated he has no connection with Moriarty at all and yet he and the rest of Thisby are unable to escape his influence, leaking into every house and bank account. Infuriated by the nerve, infuriated with Father Stamford for lending it to the man. If he thinks back to the event, he’s sure he caught some of the man’s lingering cologne in the air, heavy and fragrant.
he'd be more frightened. But he can't. He and the
It’s a treasure trove of things that are purely John. His watch is on the counter, stuck forever. Sherlock wonders if he could fix it for him. Possibly, maybe. Water damage can be fixed by substituting pieces inside, it the hands aren’t rusted still. The gears would not be the same, but it would tell the proper time, it would tick and work and function. It would get broken again, with this climate. Sherlock wouldn’t be opposed to fixing it indefinitely.
“But--”
thinks otherwise. Move him, please.”
“Yeah,” John shrugs off his jacket, then peels Sherlock’s coat off with some difficulty, ridding them of clinging cold. Sherlock cringes when he has to bend his elbow to free his arm from its sleeve. Grimy mud and bits of Thisby grass from his struggle with Moriarty cling to the soaked woolen fibers. Mrs Hudson will have a hell of a time washing that. “That
, can you believe it? Which is preposterous, because he's well aware that most users would rather live homeless and have the high than have a house and not.”
His mouth twists. Brutality and force was never a strength of his, but no one can win on will and calculations alone.
Sherlock imagines the shape of the bullet that will explode from the barrel, imagines the shape it would make in a
So will Sherlock.
WELL AFTER TWO AND HALF YEARS I FINALLY GOT TO WRITE THEM DOIN THIS.
Inexplicably, it's the way the island feels today - lonely and wide and flat, cold and salt-smelling - that brings about his revelation.
Sulking, Sherlock holds the sheet of paper closer to his face, decidedly not touching anything put in front of him, no matter how nice it smells. He is busy, and cold.
“That’s… why he changed his mind. Fuck,
“How was the festival, Sherlock?”

he meets. More than just the Yard’s keep, or the superstitious locals and bewildered European tourists. Perhaps it has found and sunk into Sherlock’s very heart, wound around each atrium and ventricle, slipped through his aorta to be pumped to all arteries, back in through every vein, a powerful, constricting black poison that will kill him.
“No one could do that to me,” Sherlock scoffs, but it wouldn’t be difficult. The list is only one name long and he’s spent weeks publicly fawning over the man.
Lestrade had once offered him a job, after Sherlock had Mrs Hudson’s drug dealing husband executed out on the continent. The job Lestrade offered was to find out who’d been stealing money from the gift shop in town. It was too easy - it was the wife of the owner, who was promptly divorced. Sherlock doesn’t know whether or not she still lives on the island. Doesn’t care.
Memories can be corrupted.
“Can I watch?”
could wander into town unseen) begin to quicken their pace, slip indoors, and Sherlock is stuck, his hands frozen to the steering wheel, his breath caught in fascination and dark fear.
Murray’s own horse, Sherlock remembers, is boarded up at the Stockyard. Murray feeds her blood and beef.
Sherlock flattens a piece of the crust under his fork, his tongue tied, and there is a sickly sweet taste in the back of his mouth.
John allows them both a moment to pull on their shoes, Sherlock’s sopping and John’s damp from when he had dragged Sherlock out of the surf.
Watson’s grin pulls Sherlock back to reality. He shakes his head, stupefied. He looks at the ground, then back up, sighing contentedly. “I look at your face, and I wonder, Sherlock Holmes.”
Watson is thinking over the validity of this answer, Sherlock can see it on his face. It's stupid, Sherlock thinks, how the sun catches in the sandy and silver streaks in Watson’s hair.
Curious, but unwilling to risk John’s life for some experiment that he'll never live to record, he stays quiet.
John leans off Gladstone’s side, grinning ridiculously. The water horse turns his face just slightly, regarding his rider. “
Does the tide tire of ebbing? Does the ocean tire of the salt? Sherlock Holmes could never tire of John Watson, not when John Watson is exactly what Sherlock Holmes has always needed. A conductor of light to call him
“Do you believe I could slay dragons if I weren’t?”
Something begins to dawn on him. Of course. Hope is clever, somewhat, but ultimately as stupid as everyone else on this island. He is malicious but would never cross his path with Sherlock’s if manageable on his own.
Gladstone doesn't react. He's still staring at Sherlock. Apparently, Sherlock’s more interesting. He doesn't know if he likes being interesting in a situation like this.
“It’s just, well. Everything on the mainland was empty and gone for me. But I saw something,” John goes on, gesturing to the floor of the cavern. “This giant black horse in the water at high tide, with his mane and tail so bright white I thought I would go blind. It was him and I, until the water went down, me on the ledge and him in the tide. I knew I had to have him. It was ten years before I caught him, with the Yard workers, on the racing beaches during a storm.”
And so Sherlock takes Redbeard to the mill with the pony cart hooked up to him the following morning, dragging along the cobblestone Skarmouth roads and into the north.
go to do with--”
Behind them, a little ways away, Redbeard is happily grazing on the stuffy, weak Thisby grass. A lead rope keeps his halter connected to the conifer Sherlock so loves, the draping one that hangs almost over the edge of the cliff. Although the sounds of the
Neither of them has noticed he came in behind them. To draw attention, Sherlock sweeps across the room, snags a photograph from where John has methodically tried to dry them, and crosses back to sit on a kitchen chair. It’s not very soft, made of wood instead of plush cushion, and so it makes his back ache. He studies the damp photograph anyways.
a rule. You travel with these men? Some don't appear so chivalrous."
Sherlock works open a drawer, John moving out of his way. Old birthday cards, memorial photographs, sympathy letters. A depressing drawer. Why would she keep memories of her dead wife in a place where she often sat, going by the compression in the desk chair's seat? His lips press together, wrestling with the influx of data without purpose.

It’s happening. Finally.
Attempting to look nonchalant, Sherlock takes a peek around the corner, seeing something so startling he's got to sharply inhale, the scent of ale clouding his nose.
This is going to be a wonderful interaction.
,” he lowers his volume as another inspector cruises by him down the hallway, almost bumping Sherlock’s elbow, “It’s bad enough you get in here as much as you do.”
Sherlock raises a quizzical brow, half-amused and feigning offense.
This seems to register with Watson, who extends one arm towards Sherlock, staying straight up in the saddle. It’s a practiced thing. Sherlock crinkles the bridge of his nose. “Why not take it off?” Sherlock asks.
“--I never said his first name, Sherlock!”
The whole rest of the island is cold, but John Watson remains so captivatingly warm.
He remembers the first letter he sent to Mycroft, addressed to a government building on the mainland.
betters.”
It’s not one of Mrs Hudson’s freehand recipe books - it’s John’s blue notebook, where he keeps his racing notes. There it is, right on the coffee table beside the sofa, closed and unassuming. It has secrets inside.
Why would this man need to tell John that? It’s a given that the owner of the Stockyard would protect his priceless horses, as mad as he is.
Sherlock doesn’t need John to tell him that Gladstone will never run again. It doesn’t matter that John will never win Gladstone from Moriarty, because Gladstone is worthless. It doesn’t matter that John will never race Gladstone again, because Gladstone stood here when he didn’t have to. Over his shoulder, Sherlock squints against the wind and the bright cliffs that are slowly clearing of people. Moriarty’s figure is not among them, not that he sees.
John had been very impressed which Sherlock’s deductions about old injuries, both men’s and horse’s, which had definitely warmed the island. Sherlock, in turn, was impressed with John's knowledge of the behavior of the
“It was taken from your figurine by someone. And it was - changed. Then, an indeterminate amount of time later, between 1938 and now, it was sold, possibly through several people, but it ended up in the hands of my murderer. A sword like that’s going to be expensive. Museum-quality.”
John’s flat palm pushes over Sherlock’s calf, manually shifting his leg.
No one gives him any room because Redbeard is an ordinary horse, not a risk to brush against in passing. Sherlock finds himself jealous of the lithe, snake-like
Every shallow slide catches Sherlock somewhere deep, coiling in a red flourish in his groin, but it isn’t until John works his knees halfway under Sherlock that John’s cock catches past on the right spot.
Lestrade is so frustrating. Sherlock takes a deep breath, smells all the different sorts of whiskey that Janine keeps behind the bar, the different polishes of the shoes in the room, and waves it all away with his free hand, dismissing it. “Aconitine is the main toxin the monkshood flower. Wolfsbane is another name for it. But it doesn't grow here, it's not native. A gardener cannot accidentally harvest and eat it because it does not grow here. And it tastes - horrible, he would've known he was eating something bad, but he finished the bite anyways.”
He lets himself be repulsive, sinks deeper into John's comfort. His mouth runs on, still low in volume, hardly a rumble.
John steadies the water horse. “It could be more seeds,” He says. Gladstone snorts saltwater over John’s shoulder.
John turns, the night is gone, the blanket from his shoulders disappears, there are no blinking blue and red lights from the police cars, and he is staring at a wide, shallow river. Never mind how he got here. Someone is breathing in his ear, it sounds like, but as he adjusts to the light, there is no one beside him.

rise on the air.
Moriarty’s knee comes up and he collapses onto Sherlock’s fallen figure, chest-to-chest. Sherlock struggles, pushing back to get out of this crawling, seaweed-breath grasp. It’s impossible to breathe. Moriarty shoves him sideways, digging in with his elbows, and, exhausted and numb, Sherlock clings to Moriarty’s arm.

Sherlock untacks and puts Redbeard away in the second of the two-stall barn. Josephine snorts, like always, but it's more forced this time - a ragged attempt at normality.
Sherlock turns over.
“You can calm him down when I get that noise to stop. He won't be able to stop with this racket!”
Lestrade sighs, sliding a few coins onto the counter beside his few empty glasses. He puts a fist next to his mouth, holding in a belch, stomach tight. He isn’t drunk, just drank too much too quickly, though he certainly couldn’t serve as an officer at the moment.

with them
He descends the stairs with more care than usual.
“It's all that horse,” Hope snarls, looking at John but speaking to his companion, “Nothing to do with the rider.”
It’s probable she thinks he was murdered in town or something, but something about the cleanly state of the foyer and the two-stall-stable tells him she hadn’t worried herself silly.
He wants to crush Jefferson Hope. To shove him from the water horse that dwarfs Redbeard, that stirred him up into madness, that pushed Sherlock nearly over the cusp of sanity and fear. Step and crush his bleeding wound underfoot.
Perplexed for a half a second, and then Sherlock exclaims, his own hand reaching up to grab John’s in retreat, “No! I mean, I meant, yes, I meant,” he shakes his head, making a fool of himself, “I meant, yes, yes, don’t--” This is plain embarrassing, but he could care less about anything besides how to make John kiss him again.
Redbeard turns into his leg, curving away from his shin, barreling through the surf once more. Sherlock cranes his neck, wind roaring in his ears and sea misting his face, stinging sharp in the back of his nose. Among the
John’s forearm shifts lower and Sherlock forgets whatever-the-hell he was thinking of.
A deep, disembodied voice penetrates the surroundings, vibrating inside Sherlock’s shoulders and chest, words indecipherable. Then, thunder. The ground shakes harder.
Abrasively, John tugs on Gladstone’s ear, twisting it and dragging their faces closer together. With his other hand, he shoves the water horse’s mouth away from him. Clearly, John can see what Gladstone has become in the wake of the screaming.
Sherlock draws in a deep breath, surveying the room. It smells of heavy saffron and mainland spices in here, wafting from whatever warm concoction is inside of the steaming, freshly-poured teacup in its painted saucer on Moriarty’s organized desk. Bookshelves are inlaid along the walls, full of old fieldwork journals, atlases, fiction. Glass bottles with curious specimens sit, undusted, on rows of shelves, and there is a Victorian gothic-styled portrait of a horse with some jockey hanging on a wall. Two windows frame Moriarty’s figure, one over each shoulder, Sherlock can spy the shades of darkness outside. Because of the hour, everything is thrown into sharp shadows from the dim lamps on the walls.
Sherlock’s cheeks are on fire again. It’s that little surprised ‘oh?’, somewhere between a tut and a hum, that Watson says that lights him up like the cresting waves at night, under a full moon. He’s pale, it’s going to stick out and make him look stupid, especially in this light, and, christ, why does he even bother talking? He swallows. “Sherlock. It’s my
John nods, finally, and pulls the giant horse away from Sherlock and across the beach, where Gladstone’s heavy plated hooves sink into the substrate, to lead him up the sandy dunes. The fact that the Stockyard owner had had enough power over John still to send him away, a man now not under his employ, without a debate sends a powerful sense of frustration and brevity through Sherlock’s arms and head. It occurs to Sherlock that he and John haven’t made any plans to meet again.
When John says
Lestrade scrubs a hand over his face. “I don’t suppose you have the murderer for the poisoned tourist? You promised me this afternoon.”
Sherlock’s fingers slip over John’s. He can feel each ridge of his fingerprints, the solid, soft warmth that Sherlock exudes when wanting to be gentle. John makes an effort to squeeze or twitch his fingers, but his nerves don’t respond appropriately. A wave of concern washes over him like the black tide from his dream, worry over the drugs that had caused such a dream, but a nurse is heard clicking her heels and John slips back under again.
The waves crest in the water, flashing a kneecap, a head, or a sea-slick shoulder, far out past the breakers and the sandbars, a testament to how close every rider on this beach had been to the unthinkable violence of the Scorpio sea.
“He’s doing all of this for you.” John squeezes.
“We've got the toxicology reports back,” Geoff says.
“I don’t understand.” John shakes his head. He struggles to find words. “It shouldn’t be
Sherlock tilts his face down again, shutting his eyes. He slumps more heavily into the wall, cringing. It occurs to him that his wrists are shaking.
It’s only a matter of time until he must face the sharks in the water.
“It's unprecedented,” the finger-lacking man says loudly in response to something Hope has mentioned, “how can a man hope to win even once?” He tightens the leather cord around Gladstone’s breastplate. The horse keens.
“May I see it?”
When people ask each other where on Thisby they’re from, most say
clacks its blunt teeth together.
But, he supposes, his hair blown by the wind and wisping over his ear and forehead, it wouldn’t have been as beautifully nerve-wracking as them together where they sit now, on the cliff grass, with Gladstone huffing into the salty air somewhere behind them.
The same half-head of a horse, half a cursive M that had been burned onto the white mare’s hide is here, a symbol meant to draw up pictures of cultural wealth and power. Sherlock is so engrossed in studying the paper and its origins that he nearly forgets it may have contents. The top is torn, where John must’ve pulled it open.
“Mike told it to me when I came here. I did say he helped me quite a bit when I immigrated, to be honest, I think he does it with everyone.”
cannot race!’ instead of just yelling at Sherlock, ‘
“Miss it,” Sherlock repeats, hungry for John’s thoughts on the water horses.
Sherlock’s heart hammers. He searches his memory but it all comes up blissfully blank. What could he have let slip while his brain was a puddle? “John, I…”
Carefully, Sherlock takes a step towards the sitting room. He’s had no shortage of attackers come into the flat looking to kill him before he becomes a problem, or for the revenge of him putting a relative, lover, or friend in prison. There was a memorable case involving a diamond that he turned down, and that earned him a swordsman swanning around gracelessly and trying to take off his head. Made for an interesting morning, at least.
They are only separated by a short distance, but Sherlock can recognize the hold, the tightness of John’s hum stuck in his jaw. He is humming, low and raw to the horse. He pictures the curve of John’s face fitting into the cup of his own hand, and again imagines the dusting of short stubble fitting against his throat.
“Yes,” Sherlock bites out. Ugh. Now is not the time to be coarse. He needs to be
But John steps up behind him, hands locking over Sherlock’s hips, chin tapping Sherlock’s arm to peer at the letter, and Sherlock reminds himself that Mycroft wasn’t ever his only goal. His nerves flutter smooth.
“Well, I’m old, now. I was real handsome in my university days. Must've been all the sand.”
excited by the sight and the sound and the smell of an attack.
An accompanying hiss, “Go!”
real.”
IN THIS CHAPTER, we have some more moriarty being suspicious, some crime-solving with our friend mike the priest, and something SCANDALOUS coming next chapter! Can i say how much i love writing Moriarty’s creepy ass? And can you spot the couple of ACD canon quotes thrown into the mix? http://villains.wikia.com/wiki/James_Moriarty  here’s the version of snow white that moriarty has ! https://germanstories.vcu.edu/grimm/schneeeng.html
“Oh!”
long, can they? It's hardly been a day since Sherlock was immersed in old files and information at the station, but already the growing itch of boredom has crept into his brain. He can feel it just under his skin.
“I’m very clever.” Sherlock keeps his voice very quiet, as if shy of the wind, to match John’s volume, neither of them wants to risk spooking Gladstone.
Redbeard’s blood fizzles under the saddle. Sherlock touches his neck, and the horse jumps and whinnies nervously. Sherlock is reminded of the mares and the young fillies and colts at the Stockyard, which reminds him of John Watson, which irks him. He wretches the reins left and pushes his heels into Redbeard’s side, a touch too harshly.
John clears his throat.
At the end of the aisle, Gladstone’s three locks are held in place. The
“John,” Sherlock scoffs. “please--”
There’s no one in the flat. No one behind the sofa, or in either of the armchairs, or crouched in the doorway. For good measure, Sherlock rushes upstairs to the spare bedroom, but it's empty. He double-checks the locks on the windows upstairs, and returns to the sitting room.
Sherlock says quietly, “Worst case scenario, we get restrained and put in the drunk cells until morning. I never get charged,” he smirks, “My intellect is far too valuable.”
“What am I
Held by a thick man with dark hair and patience in his gaze, is a giant black stallion with a striking white mane and tail.
Lestrade puffs out his chest. “Hunch.”
Moriarty smiles, as if he were a water horse. His eyes show no pleasure. “Oh, you’ve been
“That can’t possibly be Sherlock Holmes, can it?”
Unfortunately, racing is now a requirement of him, from the mouth of the spider of Thisby himself. He’s been told to stay away from the Stockyard, but that doesn’t mean that Moriarty can’t seek him out of his own volition. Strangely, Sherlock finds himself hoping he will do so. He won’t tell John this. There is much to uncover about that man in every interaction. So much swimming beneath the surface.
Taking a very gentle tone, Sherlock says, quietly, “I do, I have... I need to do it.”
“Yes. Good.”
“You said you could tell a mainland horse monger by his tie, and an airline pilot by his left thumb.” The water horse’s neck arches back again, once more the proud, champion stallion. It looks like he’s showing off. But for who, or what?
Someone else answers, “That Watson says--” And Sherlock immediately tunes the voice out.
John half-turns the keys and removes them from their place, attempting to click his handle open. Sherlock watches him work and struggle with it for a minute before the champion succeeds, and opens the door.
“Fine,” Sherlock says, “Show me a real horse.”
“Name’s unimportant. I was preoccupied with the toxicology,” Sherlock says. “Either way. In his pocket, you spotted it in the photograph, the letter was sticking out. With Moriarty’s seal. You recognized it because
There’s the wet gleam of an eyeball down by the edge of the path.
Expecting to feel the same warmth that was present in the champion water horse when they rode together out on the cliffs, Sherlock is taken aback when a clammy coolness greets his fingertips. Gladstone’s hide is salty-wet, and his teeth begin to rattle. Sherlock’s hand flinches away.
Struck onto the hind leg of the white mare is a mark - one written in blood. It's unclear whether it’s man or beast blood, like the sheep’s at the rider’s parade. It's messy and the edges are wavering and unorderly, all tells that whoever did this, they did it quickly.
Redbeard swings his face around, nudging his mouth to Sherlock’s shoulder as he adjusts the leather girth for the fifth time this morning. Wanting more attention or perhaps breakfast, Redbeard nudges him again, blowing a hot
Sherlock turns back, eyes all pretty. “Did you?” He asks, sounding vaguely surprised John had been listening.
He turns his head, regarding the area around them. On one side, where they’d come up from the cliffs after the funeral, there’s the quay and the railing, the same area where Sherlock had gone in after the stolen file. There’s a few smokers chatting about something or another by the bicycle racks. Sherlock and John stand at the edge of the Skarmouth town, behind the buildings. Through the alleyways around them, those that lead deeper into town, rhythmic music beats lightly through the chill.
The drums throb in Sherlock’s ears as he shoves his hands into the pockets of his long dark coat. He’s trying not to be seen. He only needs to wait until the rider’s parade. Bicycles lie up propped up against the walls like a pack of coyotes, shoved into and over each other as room had run out. Firelight and yellow hazing circles from the streetlamps cast high shadows against the stone walls. Around the throats of girls that sweep through the streets are necklaces made of punctured shells, and there are jingling bells tied around their wrists and ankles. The noise reminds him of the blonde mare on the beach, the one Watson had wrestled.
The water runs, and shuts off, and John returns with a flannel. Satisfaction curls in Sherlock’s smile, noting the continual lack of any articles of clothing between them.
Mrs Hudson picks this moment to return from whatever vendor she has been since bothering with small-talk. John releases his arm. Sherlock hands her his coat, and she sets her hands on her hips. Sherlock hyper-focuses on the new flour on her blouse collar. “Seems right, Sherlock Holmes, sneak away while I’m talking!”
.” Sherlock throws his arms around John’s neck, hauling him in to kiss. John’s mouth smears messily over Sherlock, who pants out regular sounds of pleasure in time with John’s snapping thrusts. He tastes like seasalt. By pulling him closer, John’s cock sinks better into him, and John grunts. John’s pelvis could mark twin bruises in the skin of Sherlock’s arse and he wouldn’t care.
“But he's not a woman, doesn't even want to be one, he just likes to dress like one occasionally. That's all - he wouldn't put lipstick on before going to Hooper’s. Before going to Hooper’s, he would've taken it off. A shower would’ve gotten rid of it, so he didn’t shower the night before or that morning.”
They both freeze.
“An antique,” Sherlock notes. It shines in the bright light as if only just forged.
But the muscle is gone already; another has it in his capable hands.
The lump is unrecognizable. It’s a ruin. Sherlock clasps a sore, sandy hand over his mouth to prevent a gasp from escaping - blood drips down the side of his face.
The Races are near.
His response came on time the next month, with a few month’s rent along with it. Mycroft was paying Sherlock’s rent forward, like he expected to be gone a very long time somewhere in the future. This should've been the first clue. But Sherlock was upset, and, though he wouldn't admit it, betrayed that Mycroft had left.
Another voice, deep and guttural. Sherlock presses his back closer against the wall and the poster as the Scorpio drummers, driven again by drink rather than skill, crash through his narrow alleyway.
Truthfully, no one had minded Moriarty’s disappearance. It was almost expected. Even those on his payroll transferred wonderfully to the new manager of the Stockyard, William Murray (“
“Yeah. Her wife passed a few years ago, surgery complications.”
“The body of the man was found out back of Hawkin’s Tavern, but there was another body in the same place, a girl, found several days prior. I concluded the woman was methodically stabbed by the butcher’s son in their shop, bled out like the corpse of an animal, and then she was brought to the back of the tavern,” Sherlock says, rattling off quickly. “The butcher’s son had no comments on what he’d done.”
Going by the frequency of creaks as Sherlock strides into the foyer, no one has lived in this house for well over forty years. Dust tickles his nose, floating in streams of light pouring in through the dirty windows, and the faded wallpaper is peeling into curls by the corners of the floor.
“Why was
Sherlock is just wondering how bad the storm will be, if it will strike today, when Jefferson Hope arrives.
If one were going to murder another tourist, at least it should be done by water horse.
“Only because you always run off. Really,” her apron smacks in the air as she shakes off the specks of watery glaze and paint. The light above the front door is on, the last busy flies of the season flitting around in its glow. "I never know if you're off at the station or if you've drowned!"
Noticing that John has been silent since returning the seashell to his hand, Sherlock picks his head up. He’s near enough to brush his lips against John’s ear. He tilts his head to observe John’s face. John’s mouth is knit into a flat grimace, staring at the shell without really looking at it. He’s far off, absorbed in thought, the dimple of his chin tucked to his neck. His curve of astray, flaxen-grey hair obscures a contemplative line over his forehead.
Just how did he end up like this? His heart begins to beat harder, and carefully he wills his breathing to slow. Every muscle and joint is warm and unused now, so it is with great care that he must shift.
You, don't- don't pretend to be polite. Are you trying to buy a water horse?”
He can't imagine he sounded very comforting to whoever was helping him when he was shot.
Sherlock nudges him back, because he doesn't look anything like a racer when he's doing this. He lifts his foot a bit away from Redbeard's side, anyways, just in case it was uncomfortable for the horse.
LMK what you think?
Sherlock swiftly clicks his magnifier lens away and sets his hand beside John wordlessly. John dutifully manages onto it, already practiced at slipping from sight. Sherlock rises to his feet and holds John up to the crook of his neck, feels John’s boot and his weight dip the scarf.
Rubbing his fingers together, bits of sand and a glaze of sweat come away from Gladstone’s pelt. Considering touching Gladstone’s withers is pointless, they're too high up for him to reach, even standing on his toes.
“Oh.”
’, he’d been talking about
“Lestrade will have his pocket contents at the station, if anywhere.” A thought strikes him, and he looks at the paper again, studying its density through flushing anger.
Of course, that’s never going to happen. Not so long as the spider breathes.
“She’s never let me watch the Races before.” Archie says, a touch of sadness in his voice. Ah, then, Molly
Others have the same idea. The ones that sign up tonight will be nervous, or they will be those brave enough to flaunt their involvement with loud voices and mugs of beer. Sherlock hasn't seen this many people about except on nice sunny days, and there are few of those on Thisby. The tourists swarm like a lulling tide, dipping into corner shops and laughing brightly in the cool air, their shoulders piled with windbreaker jackets. It’s a clear night, but the streetlamps on the walk distort the autumn sky and don't let the light of any stars through.
“You said you’d already made your wish,” Sherlock bristles, beating John to it. He tries hard to glare, but it doesn’t do much damage with sweat-dried curls sticking to his forehead. He should have noticed earlier, refused to have been distracted by the man he adores. “You lied.”
Sherlock would rather
Sherlock is taking a moment to look at him, really
He can’t ride one of those things.
He removes his hand from his cock, wiping it on the duvet and placing it to mirror his other arm. John shifts on his knees and his hips stutter, unintentionally giving Sherlock a shock with more of his unending length. Sherlock fails to suppress a whine.
Sherlock’s cheeks smudge with color. He blinks rapidly, losing his train of thought in a sudden, imposingly-thick white fog. His words stumble out from under him and the room has tilted off-kilter.
Oh, no. His stomach drops.
John bumps up on his shoulder. His voice is bright, and for the first time Sherlock’s ever heard it, he laughs. Rugged, full-bodied, absolutely exciting. “Outstanding!”
“Yes, and at that festival, you had a conversation with a woman dressed up in a taxidermy horse’s head over a seashell.” Sherlock allows a smirk to come over his lips, tucking his chin against his neck. “I don’t think either of us are responsible for our festival-induced-actions.”
“He’s never mentioned it to me.”
Sherlock glares over Lestrade’s shoulder, as if he can see Mrs Hudson through the wooden walls. Then he glares at Lestrade. At least he came in with permission.
This presents a peculiar problem. He already announced that John would be coming with him, John had agreed, but he’s not about to put John in any of his pockets. Sherlock runs through a list of ideas (pockets, some-kind-of-bag, different coat, other pocket, trousers-- no!), until the only viable one rears its ugly head.
“What do you want from these Races?” John asks, mouth twisting into a grim guise.
“Yes,” Sherlock says. Without glancing, he adds, “Come along, John, we have places to be.”
Sherlock shivers in the water.
“It’s
“Name, Sherl?” Janine asks, and Sherlock thinks he hates that name she swirls round her tongue. He wants to wipe it from his hands.
The summer horses emerge in daylight hours, then bubble and foam and slip back under the waves.
Sherlock scrunches up his nose. John turns in time to catch the countenance, and laughs breezily.
Sherlock edges his way into the single line of people leading up to where Janine is writing down names on her blackboard with a neat line of chalk. Her script is elegant, and Sherlock knows she hasn't had one thing to drink all evening. He doesn't think she's ever touched the stuff. There is a gap beneath the labels on the blackboard, before the names start, like a spot has been reserved. The board already has a dozen names and horses on it.
And then he scowls.
“Where did you hear this story?” Sherlock asks flatly.
With the low bump of Redbeard’s gait, Sherlock faces forwards and sits up on his heels, not looking to his left and to the whispers and the lull of the ocean. When he was very young, and Redbeard was, too, Mycroft had told him to always look where he wanted Redbeard to go. If he looked forward, Redbeard would go forward. If he spent too much time staring into space, Redbeard would, too, and he’d be a terrible horse to ride.
There are two oil-lamps on the stove that are not lit, and a few light bulbs carefully strung from the low ceiling by wire. John pulls chords and the room brightens slightly. The small window over the sink shows a few paddocks around the back of the main stable, and the pane is now beaten with rain. Sherlock can hear it on the roof, pattering away. John crouches, and pulls open the bottom drawer of the dresser, which knocks against the bottom of the bedframe.
“Are you ready?” Sherlock asks Watson, voice raised over the wind.
“You’ve written
The bowler hat is growing desperate.
“But I haven’t seen
“Sherlock?”
Allowing himself to be pulled from the office, Sherlock risks a last glance over his shoulder. His nerves, frayed, smooth and flatten as John guides him down the shadowed staircase and past the jockey portraits and old island artifacts. If John stopped for a moment, he could take more time to figure their value and why Moriarty possesses them all, but John doesn’t stop until they are pushing through the front door and the Persian carpet disappears from beneath their feet.
“Do you mean to get me drunk, Mister Watson?” Sherlock plays. “She’s the owner.”
Sherlock bolts, springing off across the field. Joyfully, Redbeard is pushed immediately into a gallop, tail snapping in his thrill. He hops over a small mound of grass, a largely unnecessary movement.
A beat.
An ivory stallion adorned in flared, pale blue petals began to jerk its elongated head, snapping with crystal teeth at its rider's leg, turning in a circle like a mutt trying to catch its tail.
Watching the sky, on flat, cold Thisby, only wanting to go home, captured by strange monsters whose beliefs are unknown.
But the
Sherlock glances to the champion, then to the jacket in John’s arms. “If the victim had an identical envelope with identical contents before he was killed, you are likely the target of the next poisoning. But it would’ve been done in the tavern tonight.”
“She’ll confess, too. Didn’t you see how stressed she was at the funeral?”
“‘Crime scene’?”
“Me and the lads, we would go fishing alone in the streams. You could see the colts, sometime, in a body o’ water that small, which never settl’d with me, always made me think. Your
John blows out a breath, now surveying the land like Sherlock, squinting against the bright day and the cold. Nods, as if he’s decided something. “We’ll get some honey bees in the spring.”
There’s no rumble of traffic like there is in Skarmouth, or the bleating of sheep by the farms - that’s only distant here. No bicycles or tourists around. Sherlock could go changing back into his dressing gown and pajamas to sleep, but he’s too lazy, and the gown is more for being dramatic. He doesn’t have a proper audience to be dramatic for.
“And I don't use anything anymore.” Sherlock's voice is not above a whisper. John whuffs a warm sigh over Sherlock, sending shivers over Sherlock's frame. “I promise.” An unnecessary and partially romantic addition.
All I can say is... wow.
, how to shorten the straps and keep your chin tucked, neck protected while you lean forward over the horn of the saddle. John’s seen Sherlock dismount, and he merely leaps off. It should be stupid, but it’s always so graceful.
and Sherlock snaps back to the fight.
“How much can you remember it?” They’re still spinning, the cold ground crunching beneath Sherlock’s shoes, trampled into a circle they trace.
“Yes!” Sherlock exclaims. He fixates on Lestrade. “Yes, Lestrade, where’s the cat? Animal witnesses and all that, where’s the cat?”
Sherlock fidgets. “I am a consulting detective. I solve mysteries, including murder. When the
“I don't--“
don't have any right to go around talking about my horses like you have been! You walk around this island as if it exists only to have you on it!”
“Homesick,” John goes on, “their want for the ocean, they're sick with it. I've had a water horse as big as Beryl get so sick he couldn't move. Only saltwater baths and seaweed wraps on his legs could get him out to the pasture. Even then, he would stand in place and watch the sky.”
FINALLY. sorry guys, started my summer job and have been way too tired to do much! Thankfully, the chapter after this practically writes itself. thank you!
Lestrade broadens and crosses his arms over his chest. “There isn’t a cat.”
Saint Columba’s sits outside of Skarmouth by only a small distance. The giant cross atop the cathedral glows with electric light against the dark island sky, a literal beacon.
Sherlock pretends to look around. Eyes wide, he tips his head. "Is it?"
“I’m not. I don’t.”
“Jesus,” John groans. His voice sounds like it’s been dragged over gravel and rocks, rough and low and frustrated. “Okay - okay, shoes,” he says, almost frantic. He withdraws his arms out from under Sherlock, who sags back down into the mattress.
Why had this never occurred to him before? What’s the matter with him?
Then the rider’s light hair caught the weak light of the grey sun, and Sherlock didn't relax. A water horse wasn't any less deadly because someone was sitting on it, the Races were enough evidence of that.
“Yeah, and we’re both tired. You should get to bed. I should, too.” John says the next sentence with a bit of withheld misery, “Big auction tomorrow morning.”
He focuses on ahead, searching for the riders and their parade. He spots Jefferson Hope, in his cap, meanly withered old face just one of many in the crowd. Sherlock begins to step towards Hope, who is making his way through the wailing of the singers and the thrumming beat of the drums and the fantastical costumes.
When they had raced, the wind had thrown the smell of the ocean at them, and Gladstone had veered to the edge of the land and the grass. Sherlock scrunches his nose, thinking over the delicious power of the champion horse that had tried to overcome him, even as he sat on Redbeard, lengths behind.
It’s an old island funeral, where the body is burned into ashes that the fire flickers over into the wind, and rolls coldly down into the water far below. Meant for those born here, those who always knew they would perish here. The funeral-goers are one massive creature in the night, close together, huddled around the bonfire, and Father Stamford.
Sherlock squirms again. “John. You're still very handsome.” This time, the wriggling movement in his seat was due to him being uncomfortable - not with the fact of what he was saying and having to reassure John that he was, in fact, very handsome, but the fact that he was being needled out into admitting that’s what he honestly saw and believed.
Sherlock says, turning his body slightly, “So, jumping right in, then.”
Lestrade fits a key from his belt into the lock, twists and opens it.
Inside, an enormous shape is rocking, wet fish eyes gleaming against the light in the stable. The iron locks make a faint squealing noise as John undoes them.
Sherlock risks lifting his eyes from the sea towards the sky, where gulls screech questions from above, gliding on the air that funnels, cut by the cliffs. The guillemots in the rocks of the shore make as raucous cries as the terns nesting in the cliff face. Sherlock smells seaweed and fish and the dusky smell of bird feathers and mites.
John sees his hesitation. “Where would the photographs be?” He says quietly, bringing about Sherlock’s attention. He blinks.
“If I’m going to walk you through how I solved this murder, you’re not going to need pictures.”
“The wolfsbane - the aconitine. Henry Knight didn’t know what it was when he gave it to Molly Hooper - the purple flower - but you did.” Sherlock takes a step back when Moriarty swipes again, his grin widening, “The wolfsbane was from you. You wanted me to know about the flowers, you wanted me to see it, to know you had it. That’s why you sent the seeds to John.”
The grey
All forms of relaxation born when Watson laughed are gone. Sherlock is nearly trembling with anger. His hands, white-knuckled and clutching the leather reins so hard that the folds cut into his palms, are shaking. He purposefully lowers them to the horn of the saddle so Watson won't see.
His hand returns, slick and wet with some lubricant from the glass bottle on his bedstand, enveloping the whole of Sherlock’s cock. It’s tight and gripping and
John’s stance tells Sherlock all he needs to know. John will continue to long for racing season, for the danger, for excite. ‘
“Don’t you fix the fence posts?”
They call to him, like he is one of them.
“What about the gravel ones? The rocky ones? On the other side of the island?”
Tourists are passing by, all illuminated by street lamps and the festival lanterns. Many of them stare at Gladstone, growing nervous, and whisper to each other. John sits on top of the water horse, making it a more domesticated picture, but none come close, not even the brave ones. Gladstone watches them all.
Sherlock pulls back.
John’s blue eyes slide away to watch Gladstone. Hope has taken the reins closer to the halter. John is more bothered, it seems, by the scene before him than Sherlock’s lack of a filter.
John grins.
John would do anything.
For the first time in a long while, his thoughts resign themselves to his brother. His hateful brother. His hateful brother, who could not see past what he disliked about Thisby to find something worth its weight.
Unsure, Sherlock tilts his head, staring up at John’s quarter profile. John’s looking out at the ocean, not at the froth of the ocean beating against the rocks going on below. Perhaps he is ignoring it, or allowing his eyes a rest from all the carnage they tend to see. The glints of the waning sunlight off the waves in the water reflect in John’s eyes, turning tidepool blue into light, merry brown. He studies the lines beneath them, the crease over John’s brow as he squints against the shining sun off the ocean.
“I know.”
Did Watson just die for him?
Mycroft had said, “The Races are all Thisby has.”
John fumbles for words. He doesn’t look shaken, not quite, but certainly on edge. Sherlock understands. They hadn’t been expecting this sort of letter from Moriarty -- perhaps another clue, a hint as to the expansive reach Moriarty has over the criminal world, a threat. But not a blatant invitation.
At once, Sherlock is aware of the knight concealed in the folds of his scarf, and cedes room to the DI. He angles away, even when Lestrade glances at him, perplexed. In the past, Sherlock has never cared about trivial concepts such as personal space. To better hide John, Sherlock fusses with his collar and tucks his chin. A small arm elbows against his finger when he brushes up by cold armour, a warning to not get too close.
John reaches for him, gentling over the cut on Sherlock’s lip with his thumb. Like he’s remembered, he pulls away, returning with a handkerchief from his jacket pocket. The revolver gleams at his waistband when he moves, shiny with rain. He dabs carefully through Sherlock’s winces. Sherlock hardly blinks, terrified to miss any micro-expression or imperceptible, nonverbal cue. John's whole form is shining from the street lights somewhere down the next alleyway. His blue eyes glint steel, and his damp hair glistens white.
pool of blood doesn’t reach the old stain, marking at what angle she was propped up, by six point seven centimeters. Big difference, big enough of a difference for the spread of the stain not to be just capillary action - I’ve done a whole set of experiments on the way blood adheres to itself and to varying textures and brands of fabric... Therefor, she wasn’t murdered here,” Sherlock finishes, finally drawing breath again.

He could use this edge, that Watson is giving him. But that leaves more questions in its wake.

worries that have haunted him for weeks.
The tide will bring the water horses and the men of the island will try to capture them. The terns will nest in the sheer rocks, and Redbeard will ride moorland trails instead of a beach. The ocean will hush
They’ve both gone soft, and the duvet is damp under Sherlock’s seat. Sherlock pushes himself up, shuddering when the change in position makes something leak out of him. He winces, something twinging inside of him.
“I am made of flesh and blood. Tell me - what have you done with Rebecca?”
Magnussen, who would have no reason to be at the Yard and cut apart Beryl, despite John’s written questions around that passage.
“‘This one’?” John repeats.
But it’s just Musgrave, her little feline form, tail high, crawling from between the creaking fence posts and then stalking towards them beyond the two-stable barn.
, Sherlock supposes - doesn't even glance to Redbeard. Redbeard, who is still shaking like he's under threat. He may very well be.
The main cavern opens up shockingly wide underneath the island, carved from hard stone, and has high walls that stretch far above Sherlock’s head, far higher than even Gladstone’s neck would reach, were he down here with them. Fitting against the sides of this chamber are smaller, darker spots, black tunnels that run deeper into the island. How far into Thisby’s ground do they go? Sherlock peers curiously into them, unable to see more than a few meters down, and imagines a work of these mazes running beneath Mrs Hudson’s house, under the tavern and Hooper’s Bakery, under the Stockyard, everywhere.
Hungrier.
A new appreciation for the giant horse has settled in Sherlock’s stomach. The sign that kept John from waiting for the water anymore. But a water horse is still a water horse on the outside.
John thrusts again at the same angle. “Yeah?”
“It could've covered the bitterness, but perhaps it wasn't--”
He holds it up to his lens.
Lestrade opens his mouth to counter Sherlock’s snark, but there’s a call from downstairs, “I let him in, Sherlock! Said he wanted to speak with you!”
As expected, John has remained on the coffee table, stalking the edges like a big cat in an empty pen. Given enough time, he could figure a way down and out of the flat, Sherlock is convinced, but why do that when Mycroft is surely going to pick up his spy sometime soon?
So he isn't sure why he climbs out of the car, slams the door, and is briskly making his way through town towards the pull of the water. His hands in his coat pockets, shoulders hunched up against the bite of the wind that tosses his curls.
Sherlock awakens immediately, sitting bolt upright and crowding very near to John’s face. “John, yes,” he answers, all traces of fatigue gone.
"Bears repeating."
“Please.”
“For god’s sake…” Sherlock rolls his eyes.
But the pistol is a comfort, heavy and potent in his hands.
They meet in the light near the stable. There are severe shadows cut over all their faces, thrown straight beneath them to the grass and cobbles.
“Shhhh,” Sherlock pats the stallion’s shoulder, hushing him like the sea. He holds tight to the reins, pulling them over the equine’s head and using them as a lead to guide Redbeard back to the cliffs. They’ve gone pretty far from them. Redbeard’s ears flick towards him, seeking his voice as a comfort.
Sherlock’s dark coat collar is turned up against the thriving wind. John spends an unnatural amount of time staring at his neck.
And probably, the rest of them are his jobs, too.
“He’s a mainland monger now.”
He lets John lead him to the cliff edge anyways, and John looks over past the sea, as if seeing the low angle of the sun for the first time. “I suppose it has been a long while,” He agrees. Sherlock gets the distinct feeling that John is not referencing the time it’s been since he brewed the tea.
“And trousers,” Sherlock manages, muffled by John’s hair.
What sort of things can someone slip a man that would result in this frothy spit, can cause the clearly agonizing signs of his last moments, and the crust and salt of sweat all over his face?
Sherlock should've kept the bit in his mouth to prevent him from eating the bad, scrubby grass - but he's not that cruel. Redbeard was enjoying himself.
The terns are not the same as they had been on that day. And though John has just left his view over the sides of he grassy cliffs, Sherlock fixes his collar and prepares for a talk that he had not had before. His anxiety is through the roof. Nothing to lose.
When Sherlock opens his eyes, John’s there again, in front of him, and that alone is what brings his heart rate back to something that can be nearly called normal. John’s removing his own jacket from Sherlock’s shoulders. Stupid. Stupid.
“I shouldn't have waited for so long.”
. That’s the only important bit.” John glances at Redbeard.
“Me?” Sherlock says, acting incredulous. As if the blame is on him! “Me!”
The comment is so unexpected that it knocks a surprised, nervous laugh out of Sherlock. “Is it not
For a small snatch of time, you can see the ocean before the cliffs rise up and fall down again, crazed water far closer than it is at the racing sand. The waves all smack against each other, whitecaps slapping over and melting back into the high breakwaters. Some groups of mussel-covered rocks have water foaming around them, and one dark spot past the shallows rises up and slips back under, flaring a red-brown spine and a head before it’s gone.
It hasn't been a long time since Sherlock was in Skarmouth after dark. The ghost of his memory plays tricks on him, of that night merely a week ago when he was soaked up to the knees and covered in salt and brine and fear and fleeing a water horse. He instinctively looks towards the sea, recalling the blonde mare on the beach and John Watson's firm grip on her halter. He can't see past all the shops, but he knows just beyond them, in the dark, like this, the black sky will drop over the cliffs like a veil and will match the sea. It will be impossible to tell them apart.
He begins to wonder which he would rather die at the hands of.
looks down as well, suddenly studying its own crystalline hooves. Sherlock has a feeling this is merely a diversion, a distraction before the water horse would strike, if it didn’t have a rider controlling it. It may still lunge, even with Watson on its back.
All these island accents, mashed up together. Old ones, new ones. Sherlock used to mimic the old island accent in the hours before he slept, when he was young, when he still had the lingers of a lisp. It’s something rumbling around the ‘r’ sounds that he could never get right, until he spent literal weeks stalking Skarmouth and listening to conversations. He's very fluid with any island accent, now, as well as multiple languages.
And nothing else happens on Thisby.
Across the road, sheep wander loose over the mossy stone walls, the ones where the dead collie once was, when Sherlock had ridden up this path only days ago. He can still see the gleam of the wet eyeball in his mind. But he chases the image away, staring out at the fields he and Redbeard pass. There is no sign of the piebald that came out of the storm, and he wonders if it’s returned in the wake, or if an unlucky man has gone and caught her. Surely, no one would try racing that giant. She’s no Mary, but she’s no Redbeard. She was horrifying, stinking like the rot of the seabeds, and taken again by the ocean.
Those on the sand ready the poles.
Sherlock scoffs. “You've won the Races the last five years. You're the
It’s naturally Sherlock by his side when he’s able to speak, from a throat that had been stuffed full of oxygen tubing and other work to close a lung.
Fairytales… and pretty grim ones, too. I’ll see you, come the Races. Do be careful. This island can be treacherous.”
The stool is very hard under his backside, and all at once the want for his bed hits him.
John says this plainly, as if it does not shake the very foundations of Baker Street. It’s a miracle Mrs Hudson isn’t tossed out of bed or her kitchen by such a quake. (It’s a miracle she didn’t somehow prevent Lestrade from barging up.)
they’ve killed. They are charmed, magic— wickedly sharp and expert at slicing muscle and water horse hide. John’s blood begins to thrum at the sight of it, and he whispers to himself to quell it all.
He gazes out to the ocean, like a competitor will rise from the wild sea, his hair lifting away from his face and light blue eyes shaded with color against the white-chalk background. He doesn’t see Sherlock, even though it would be impossible to miss a man standing just offshore on the first of November. John’s only a length away from where the waves are rippling the sand hard and firm, the only man daring to be so close to the sea.
“Ah, Holmes,” He says, “You tempt fate. An island pony won't last a second in the Races.”
It’s then that the small book clicks.
“The fantasies,” Sherlock says, “not real?"
bares its blunted teeth. Hydria creeps closer, a gruesome smile befalls Hope’s countenance. Hydria snakes her head. Christ. How do these fiends always know when to become all the more frightening? Do they have an extra sense, for deciding when their rider has malicious intent, and then act upon it? They all know that this is working Redbeard up into a frenzy.
“Two days? How do you know that?”
“You won't race?”
At once, Sherlock is standing back in the ocean with the waves crashing up against him and the rocks and kelp pulling at his feet, desperately watching the Races from the water. Water horses shriek and crash over each other like the waves, all rolling thick like smoke over the sand. But he’s not in his mind palace, and he can’t remove himself from the sea—
“Come on, Redbeard,” He murmurs softly, pulling lightly on the reins and shoving past the photographer.
They are hardly out the front door and down the walk before John turns to him, an itching smile beginning to pull at his lips.
“It’s not that, exactly, except.” Mike opens the book, undoing the leather strap. He flips several pages, the turning of the paper loud in the quiet church. “Except, I heard

Sherlock makes a negative noise in his throat. It works better than shaking his head ‘no’. Shaking his head would dislodge John on his shoulder, and he couldn't imagine ever doing such a thing. “Moriarty would seize the house back. Then where would she go?”
funeral you need to attend?”
“The one with the pony.”
Mrs Hudson watches him go and then turns back to Sherlock, who is shivering even in the raised temperature of the house. She shuts and locks the door.
Sherlock never turns his back to Gladstone until they are started down the rocky slope from the cliff to the beaches. Neither does John. Unaware.
"It doesn't, you're imagining it."
Sherlock goes with the most obvious one. “Why are you telling me this?” He asks, now tasting the salt in the strengthening wind. He wonders if, perhaps, a storm is on its way.
Mrs Hudson holds Musgrave in her arms, tucked under the cat’s forelegs. “But she
Gladstone throws his head back, Sherlock can see the slick eyes reflecting off the last daylight that graces Thisby, and gives a short gleeful shriek. John shouts, “Hey!” In answer, throwing his arms open like he’s about to embrace the huge water horse. Gladstone stomps both front legs down into the packed earth, observing John as the Thisby wind throws his white mane over his twitching withers. If horses could smile, Sherlock would like to think that Gladstone would be.
Although, it does seem silly to preen and wonder over John’s opinion, when John’s real name probably isn’t even
The door to the notary’s office is locked. Sherlock scowls, releases John, and has to pick it again.
His shoes are annoyingly quiet. Portraits of monarchs, reprints of famous Picasso pieces cover the marred wallpaper, unsettling taxidermy mammals on side tables. There's a lamp in the sitting room somehow fashioned out of a rabbit, next to a stack of cornered coasters, and it is hideous. A panel of collectible teaspoons hangs over one of the several stone fireplaces.
“It was. No
“No, come on. Honestly,” John pleads, and Sherlock suddenly wants to be anywhere but here. He doesn’t want to be in the rain anymore. “What happened?”
It can't be well. After all the work that went into training him to not be afraid of the

“You poisoned Beryl, thinking she was Gladstone, and when your mistake didn’t work out quickly enough for you--” Sherlock ducks, “You slashed her legs, had John be rid of the evidence. You killed her.”

“Oh,” she frets, turning to search around them. She cranes her neck. “Oh, Molly wanted to see you off, too. She couldn’t get Archie off her arm!”
There are pages that Sherlock knows are years old, small tables and racing notes about horses that have long since returned to the ocean. He moves forward, past these and to recent events.
John’s arm wraps casually over Sherlock's shoulders, pulling Sherlock closer.
John whispers,

“It’s right in front of the door!”

His scarf brushes softly against his jaw.

“Yeah, just let him do his thing, it’ll only be five minutes,” Lestrade says. When Donovan doesn’t move, he continues, “You don’t want to be here any longer than I do, do you? Sherlock, be professional. I don’t want to see your fingers in a dead person’s mouth
littered with fairytales, back on the mainland?
Against the bright clouds, his ears are pricked and alert. One of them is torn and drooping.
Lestrade tends to become upset when Sherlock runs off, but now, Lestrade has done the running off. He can't give a lecture this time, can he?
“Oh, sorry.”
The Races are near.
mare back to the ocean. Who else could anyone on the island trust with a water horse? She’s not for someone else to take, not to sell by old island standards, and is only the dead boy’s payment for racing. There is more debt required in the Races than the fifty coins to enter.
John ducks below Gladstone’s massive head (never do that, Sherlock distinctly remembers being told, even with an island pony), and laughs at the sight. “I’ve got you,” He laughs, “Wait just a minute.”
“Good-bye,” Sherlock says, already hyper-fixated on the body and the promise of new, unorthodox information.
“Are you going to make him walk home in the dark? In October - really, Sherlock?” She erupts, as upset as if John Watson were her own son and Sherlock were trying to kill him. Sherlock reaches up to scrub the towel over the wet back of his head. Were the wind chill any lower, he’s sure his hair would be glazed with ice.
’? A trick, a rise?
“That’s not the same as--”
implying that Moriarty and him have ever touched. Sherlock’s top lip begins to curl at the rotten memory of Moriarty’s cold hand gripping his on the beach, after Hope’s throat was torn out by Gladstone. His sense of safety is gone.
It’s a few short hours before Sherlock wakes again. Perhaps it's due to the fact that his body is unaccustomed to another's heat, or lingering anxiety, or his erratic sleep schedule.
“That a good enough reason?”
“Well, don’t worry--”
Sherlock stares at the ceiling, speechless. Then his voice comes out ragged, “You swear a
"You--"
John hushes him, low and under his breath, more of an exhale than a real noise.
He lazes around the rest of the morning, fixing tea when Mrs Hudson leaves to visit Mrs Turner next door. He watches her all the way until she’s out of sight with the Ford, and then raids the fridge.
“I mean that, I have no problems, what you do is your business, sweetheart, I just didn’t think I’d ever meet one—”
. “Only you.”
“On the beach— after Hope, what was it you spoke with Moriarty about?”
Like he has said so many times before, John says, this time against Sherlock's lips, “Meet me on the cliffs.”
“Your - your brother?”
“Holmes, there’s never been an island pony running on that beach unless it was running away from a water horse.” The mill worker on the ground says. Sherlock can see his arm’s getting tired. Maybe he’ll drop it, walk away, and go home.
“That it would never walk again.”
“He wasn’t interrupted when he killed her. She was found a day later. This means something.”
Even Henry Knight, with his wide, almost-fearful eyes and light questions, seemed a tad too hungry for information than John could handle. No, he couldn’t sell him a

. I’ll believe you’re real if you come to the crime scene with me.”
He waves a hand, pretending to cooperate, at least for another few minutes, until after Lestrade leaves. Best to not let him in on the plan. Lestrade is always against a few things, one being Sherlock running around in Skarmouth or Tholla after dark, and two being Sherlock sneaking into his offices. After dark, or in the daytime. Anytime, really.
It hits him all at once.
A full sheet of heavy, glossy paper. It’s a shot of the man’s body, lying just as how Sherlock had seen it the other day. On his back, arms outstretched, box of tarts open and cast just slightly to his side. He squints, and there are crumbs over his lips, along with that

muscles shudder with restrained power, while Redbeard’s ears are laying flat and twitch in fear.
“Hello,” John says, half lost to a yawn.
John's capable hands, taut muscle, his knowledge of the
When he scoffs, Redbeard turns his ear back to catch the noise. Sherlock looks out at the ocean far out past the cliffs. He used to fancy he could see the mainland from this spot. Downwards are the racing beaches, with water horses shivering for the water in the wind. He watches the thrall below for several minutes, before pulling one side of the rein and turning Redbeard away from the edge of the world.
up at him. Slowly, the tiny figurine raises the jagged dagger. Sherlock stares, mystified, at the subtle movement, the tiny clench of the knight's hand around his dagger.
No, no. Don’t go creeping around the house with a pistol, he thinks while already heading down the stairs. How many times has Mrs Hudson told him off about sneaking around like that? Too many to count during each racing season. One would think he could get over the childish habit of having nightmares over so many years.
More anxiety-inducing than him, clutching John’s hands during the night of the storm, and more heart-stopping than giving his blood at the rider’s parade, or last night when John gripped him tight. But it seems so natural to say it, so bloody and so real, a valid statement he has let loose into the world and cannot recapture.
This makes the officer’s smile drop, although his tone remains broad and almost upbeat about the whole thing. As Sherlock has long suspected, Lestrade liked the mysteries that his job occasionally provided. Thisby was full of mysteries, but so many of them had been in existence for so long that people forgot to solve them.
“Ah. What year is it for you? It jumps around, down here, for me. How long have I been in my case? I can never tell, anymore. Last I remember, it was 1938 by your standards.”
His mum used to say that every man on the island was in love with Janine Hawkins - she was beautiful, and she could make any man as drunk as a water horse on the November tide.
The father is approaching, now, dim gaze set on their small group.
John whispers into Gladstone’s shoulder. Gladstone’s long head drops within reach, his ears, one torn, drop lazily forward. John’s sturdy hands stutter, the slightest hesitation. He unbuckles the throatlatch of the bridle, carefully drawing the tangled reins and headpiece over Gladstone’s face. The
He had fur on his clothes, and as he fought her--” Sherlock jumps, sliding his hands together as if gripping the hilt of an invisible sword.
“Can you remember the names?”
. It’s what I came to Thisby for.”
Shocked, the man whips around, eyes finding Sherlock in the dimness of the alleyway. Light pours in from behind him, the opening of another street where cars and people are passing by in festivity, all unaware of the scene just meters away.
Mycroft would think very little of him for falling in love. It would not matter that John is unattainable, only that Sherlock had opened himself up enough to feel what he does. Why should he ever have done that? Oh, the berating that he would be subjected to, how he may call Sherlock an idiot, stupid, paling in comparison to himself, a moron who has fallen in love with the idea of Island magic.
Hope turns away from the monster, the horse that is no horse, and jibes once more at John, unable to resist another smart comment to make John look foolish in front of the crowd. Anger rumbles low in Sherlock’s belly.
Sherlock closes his eyes, listening to the drizzle on the stones around them, and suppressing shudders.
“And some have raced more.”
Hope coughs, struggles, then, with a last breath through torn airways and pipes--
Just a moment ago he had been alive. Just a handful of seconds is all it took for the entire scene of the beach to shift, for the white clouds to turn grey, and for the sea to change to choppy black, the water is reaching for the body.
Even next to Hope’s horse, when John shot at the man for Sherlock, the champion
The sigil that had been drawn on her blonde hide makes him realize that there weren’t.
Although there have been several cases which Sherlock was required to go after elderly murderers, Sherlock doubts this will be one of them. Statistical likelihood. Still, it can’t be ruled out. Sherlock makes sure his shoes are tied appropriately, musses his hair artfully in the bathroom, then steps back into the sitting room.
tore down the ferry they were aboard, Sherlock was put off of ever being near the water horses. Most people had similar stories. His parents were idiots. Everyone knows not to be caught out on the frigid waters in October. But on the tiny, craggy island of Thisby, the cold ocean is hard to ignore.
“How long do you think this storm will last?”
She's just coming up the stairs now, wearing an apron covered in flour around her waist. Panic-baking again. She's quiet, then, “Well, now Mrs Turner owes me a pretty penny.”
The sand tilts under his shoed feet, and the land begins a subtle, rumbling shake.
aren’t very good at picking up on things for a detective.”
“We shouldn’t speak here.” Stamford pushes a note into John’s hand, a crumpled old bit of yellowed paper. At once, John unfurls it, and Sherlock leans close to read it, as well, suddenly feeling very vulnerable against the open area and the dark clouds, standing about in the fresh night.
It’s a kelpie trick, one that John does not fall for in his wisdom. In its failure, Gladstone does not lunge like any other
“Mm. Not the baker. No motive.”
final chapters are being super finicky about being written, but they are on their way.... >:)

And she’ll continue for a long time after he dies.
It would be for John. The world comes collapsing back on top of him. They’re lying in bed together, naked, sated, and yet something is still unvoiced.
“Yes.”
Sherlock occasionally drops by to think if Mrs Hudson’s crew of bridge players are over, although he’s been neglecting the building and its resident priest recently on account of the Races and all that the season entails. The night he signed up for the Races, at Hawkins’ Tavern, he ran into Father Stamford, who told Sherlock of his old acquaintanceship with John Watson. ‘
Ten minutes later, they clear off the cracked dirt road to make way for a shiny, red, newly-modeled car ripping by. It throws up dust behind it. Sherlock pulls on the reins to halt Redbeard, who tucks his chin against his long red neck and snorts unhappily. Sherlock pats his neck, turning the stallion to watch the car whiz on. He wonders what someone with that kind of money (evident, wealthy - the model’s new from the mainland, whoever owns that is rich enough to have it shipped in - new tires, no dents) is doing on this side of the island.
“What’re you saying, exactly?” Lestrade asks, voice gruff from drink. John is watching his face and listening intently, ever the loyal, invested companion.
Suddenly, there is a black blur against the reds, duns, whites, and greys, its legs moving faster, flank shifting quicker than the other horses. With a lump of a rider on his back, Gladstone is a pulsing heart, beating his way between other squabbling horses and hot teeth. His neck isn't tucked like that of a practiced island pony, but stretched out far ahead like a striking cobra, head jerking up and down as he flies at a full gallop.
She puts his name right at the top, filling in the gap she was evidently saving for him.
hisses, ears pinned and tail snapping, leaping in front of Redbeard towards the water in search of the salt in the wind. A stray hoof cannons into Redbeard’s nose, but the island horse ploughs on, made faster by fear.
John’s eyes are downcast, not looking to Sherlock’s face. Why isn’t he looking? Panic clogs his mind. John had been so close to forgiving him, although Sherlock hardly apologized and it’s not nearly enough, and John could never be satisfied with him, not after he acted so abhorrently, not after he left John out of the plan--
Redbeard, below him, doesn't like the atmosphere.
Perhaps Sherlock has ripped the barter too wide, given his enemy too many advantages.
Everything is wet, here, the entire world. Horse sweat and saltwater, John's brow is covered with it - but this is much darker. Something sinister is smeared on that mare. She's white, and it stands out against her pelt. Weak light again gleams off the shiny-wet patch on her hide as he turns.
“He’s a good boy,” Mrs Hudson taps Sherlock on the cheek, and Sherlock does not move, instead staring at another paper with no intention of reading. “You know, the pickpockets in Skarmouth are all afraid of him, he loves his cases, and those murders are right up his street.” She is up now and starting to wash a dish she used for baking, some weird circular, sticky piece. “John, if you’ll be needing it, do you mind the sofa? The spare’s all cluttered.”
John shifts, finally regaining some semblance of personal space, to turn a lock over the bright paddock where the half-blood mare plays with an island pony. She is often quiet, this mare, but smart. She knows when food comes and when she’ll be approached with a saddle, and she knows when she is being looked at. Island horse things.
The idea that he can't solve this one immediately and without issue bothers him.
Moriarty throws up his hands, and Sherlock makes sure not to flinch in concern, holding his posture, hands itching for the letter opener. He grins. “That’s what they always say about the rich old man who lives on the hill!” He taps the fairytale’s hardcover, and places it back down on the center of his desk. He straightens it, giving an impression of compulsion, until it is in line with his pens. “The king,
it’s changed.” Sherlock waves the fur at John, who jerks back, stumbling over a ruffle of Shadwell’s blouse.
She is almost more fish than water horse. There is a wide circle around her, men dare not approach, to the disdain of the monger, who must be trying to sell for next year with no luck. The
“Yes, that’s what I was thinking. I’m all for giving the benefit of the doubt,” Mike says, “but I wondered about it. I don’t think anyone noticed me take it.”
A long paper strip pulls away, one side tan-weathered skin and the other covered with the words
A water horse on the beach snaps at the adjacent rider, flicking back hot ears and ocean brine. For a split second, as Sherlock looks up to the cliffsides, watching people’s hats blow off in the strong wind,  he can see himself, very small and frizzy-haired, high up on the edges among the yellow of raincoats and the mud-green of traditional Thisby scarves and coats. He shakes his head. No. These are not those Races. Mycroft and his own younger self disappear.
in the rain, they'll change anywhere--”
The Scorpio drums beat in his chest, a fluttering, deep thing. With every pound against the blood-spattered leather, a baseline makes itself known in Sherlock's lungs.
Sherlock takes it. Last time they’d met, Henry had come off a disappointing ferry and was longing for a cigarette to cover his fatigue. Now, Henry simply appears for all the world like his profession suggests -- hungry for new mounts, new information, new answers, all things that John Watson can provide him with. Sherlock suspects this is the reason that Henry had searched for him. But how did he know that John would be by the racing cliffs this evening?
John’s still a length away from his face, dark-edged eyes searching Sherlock’s expression. A half-smile emerges over his mouth, the one Sherlock had just had his lips upon. He would endure a hundred of Anderson’s sea wishes to keep doing this.
At last, he is untethered, free of everything physical that keeps him on the shore.
“Just. Miss Hooper. May I work for you?”
John is looking at him. His cobalt eyes reflect the muddy yellow of the grass they sit upon as the wind lifts his hair back. It suddenly doesn't feel so overwhelmingly cold. It almost feels like the island has warmed, just in this spot.
“Usually.” Sherlock quips. John stretches, brush a hand across his own cheek, scratching at his stubble. John normally doesn’t let it grow this long, Sherlock can tell. “
Sherlock’s head drops back, eyes falling shut. “
Redbeard is frightened and working harder to streak in front, but Sherlock pulls him up. They cannot leave John here alone - but if they fall any further back, the fray streaking up behind will swallow the three of them. Redbeard throws his head in alarm and his ears flay back, flicking salty sweat and pinning against his skull.
It was well worth it.
A blue light flashes on the road outside the window, catching his eye.
Sherlock's fingers fidget by his side. Her every step was pain.
Didn't hear him come up on that big horse at all. It's terrifying how silent they are. The only thing that gives the pair away, sound wise, as John rides him closer, is John’s hearty giggling. His biceps flex briefly under his shirt, straining the jacket he wears while he dismounts, and suddenly Sherlock's mouth feels wetter than it had a moment ago. He digs into the saddlebag on Gladstone’s haunches and removes a small blue notebook that was in his flat the night Sherlock stayed over.
Sherlock snorts.
“Moriarty. There’s no one here to appreciate your performance,” Sherlock says.
Whoever has broken in has no torch to illuminate their way, and Sherlock momentarily berates himself for not locking the door after their own entrance. It would’ve made the intruder’s work much harder, given him and John more of a time to hide, to find the documents and get out. The way the figure sneaks around the corners of the offices makes it clear that it is not a person who knows the layout of the building.
Inconceivably, the man holds his position, backed up against the iron, hitting bicycles with the back of his legs. “Not today, Sherlock Holmes,” He says, definite, and he throws the papers into the wind over the quay, and he takes off down the street at full speed.
“Where?”
Gladstone, the massive beast, remains in the circle John has drawn for him, out of reach, but watching them. John has taken part of a piece of olive cloth and fashioned it around Gladstone’s big nostrils, so the
“You don’t know me.” Sherlock leans farther over the desk, his upper lip caught in a snarl.
Sherlock snorts at this statement, though he recognizes his own hypocrisy. He would rather have John alive than Gladstone, as much as he is fascinated by the latter, he'd never want anything more than John. He thinks of Moriarty.
I do. You’re
It’s a
“You don’t have to come tomorrow.”
There’s still talk, and Sherlock watches the blackboard, often stopping in the tavern on the nights he’s in Skarmouth after an exhilarating ride on Redbeard around the clifftops. There are the odds next to the names now, little chalk numbers that hold so much power over the islanders.
Sherlock rises early and drags Redbeard from his stall. The stallion puts up a fit. He’s not had a good time of going out lately. Sherlock’s never really brought him outside during November and October before, never had to, never wanted to. He was always scared for the horse’s life, and for his own, because, surely, if Redbeard encountered a water horse, he’d be horrified and leap away from Sherlock.
There’s a dead
The screaming becomes louder. It has not paused, not once.
Oh. Watson shoved Hope. Off the rock.
It is October.
Sherlock knew, and knows, that he loves the water horses. He loves their unfathomable power, their ability, their tremendous, shuddering speed, but he loves it as he loves myths and pirates. As something far away, and detached from him. He loves Redbeard as nothing else, held close to his heart and sheltered from the cricketing winds.
Sherlock nods.
“Jesus,” John rasps, gazing ahead after glancing at Sherlock. “I knew Hank was in custody, but I didn’t read the paper.”
Moriarty’s elegant offices are north of the stables by just a way, holding rooms upon rooms with fans and heaters and posh things that John hates to look at. Even the ornate and fashionable front door seems to stare at him for his lack of wealth, looking over his palm on the handle as if to ask him what his business is here. In all his years employed here, more than ten, he’ll never get used to it.
Sherlock fiddles with a cuff link, and then sweeps to his armchair to collect his coat. It’s the right weight and there are no more cases and no more figurines as he slides it on, popping the collar up.
At the very top is the lowest:
“No,” John commands. “No, it is. This is
clacks brittle teeth by Redbeard’s ear as it comes down the slope behind them. Sherlock lifts the reins to draw Redbeard’s head away just in time, pulse rushing.
Sherlock’s clothes feel tight and rumpled around his body, as if they cling to him in revealing ways. Of course they don’t - no one on the island could tell what he has been up to. The brisk walk here from the Stockyard wasn’t short, but it wasn’t enough to exert him. What has
Sherlock has savings. Meager, meager savings. Not enough to go to the mainland. Not enough for Anderson. Not enough to buy a water horse to race.
“I held suspicions before, but he said so in our meeting. Mr Haverford’s son was a distraction. The tourist, Redding, was a ploy for attention, a show of his influence. I’m willing to bet the female tourist from last week was, too - murdered by the butcher’s son but doubtlessly orchestrated by Moriarty.”
There he stands, up on the very edges for the high cliffs, where the grass and soil bumps up. The pale yellow stems tremble with the wind blowing inward towards him. Moriarty. It’s hard to make out, but it’s him.
Stupid.
“Ho, pretty boy Holmes…!”
Lestrade looks pissed. “So, now I’ve got to do full investigative reports on the fishermen of the island? It’ll take days. And you know how rumors are with those men, if they hear of me looking into their highly lucrative side business, they’ll hide all evidence.”
His knee bumps between Sherlock’s thighs, allowing John to settle his weight on the bed and push it into Sherlock’s groin, grinding into Sherlock’s hard cock. Sherlock gasps, heat sparking all along the inside of his thighs like hot pepperflakes, but John licks the sound away, sucking on Sherlock’s bottom lip and burying his hands in his curls.
Then again, why would John? There isn’t a crying need for an impromptu rescue mission. Not unless Sherlock can get him to break character and turn out Mycroft’s secrets for him, instead of vice versa.
The three of them are in work right now; both companions pull together to place a breastplate-like chain of mail over and around Gladstone's chest and withers, hard bells and iron nails sewn into the material, while Hope whispers to Gladstone from a safe distance. John is always closer to Gladstone’s face, a dance of mislaid trust between the two of them.
he means
“What did you wish for?”
A young tourist is pointing right at Redbeard. Other tourists are staring, backing away. Molly Hooper just emerging from the bakery with a metal pail to refill the trough outside her shop in time for Sherlock, doesn't even look concerned.
The mill’s that way. So’s the Stockyard. Watson must’ve come from there. This must be where he rides his water horse in preparation for the Races. It isn’t a bad spot. There’s light right now and less wind than on the side Sherlock is most often on.
Without moving his hands from Sherlock’s face, John glances over to Gladstone, and from where his forehead is now pressed against John’s cheek, Sherlock can feel the rise of a grin.
John smiles, “Yes, your Sherlock, he’s managed to convince me how my lingering injury was only psychosomatic.”
“Nevermore.”
Henry nods, seeming to parse all this. Has this talent been what Henry has been thinking of since meeting Sherlock?
“Why don’t you get the envelope from Inspector Lestrade tomorrow?” John suggests, setting down his jacket back onto Sherlock’s desk and picking up the things Sherlock tore out of it. “You don’t want to go breaking into the station twice in one night. He’s got to be at home in bed by now, you saw how much he drank. Even you drank a bit.”
At once, Sherlock remembers the night of the storm, of John’s flat, and looking at John’s worried expression. ‘
Belatedly, he hopes that Archie failed to convince Molly to let him watch the Races.
He decides to do none of these things and sulk instead, throwing himself into the sofa and scowling.
Sherlock watches him, ruminating over what the Races would’ve been like for him if he had never met Gladstone. There’s a sense of security, albeit he knows it’s false, thinking that all the horses on the beach will be like Gladstone. Behaved in the hands of their keeper, and uninterested in Sherlock. But Mary, the piebald, Jefferson’s horse and that chestnut, have all shown him the other side of the
A sea wish.
It isn’t what John Watson’s water horse eats.
“But she didn’t just die on her front. The bloodstains don’t go below her waist - her legs were propped up when she was stabbed, like a slaughtered cow. She was purposefully bled out. facedown, as she died, then was dumped here, where she continued to bleed onto the ground. But, as you can clearly see from said staining and said blood on the ground, the
“You’re bringing that back, you hear?” Lestrade points his finger accusingly at Sherlock. John glances to him, as if wondering how many times Sherlock has stolen police evidence.
that his boots make on the painted plywood.
“Mm.”
And a talking figurine?
Moriarty’s words always unnerve him.
Sherlock’s back is against John’s surprisingly soft front… He's having a difficult time stopping his eyes from getting teary again. Or from drooping. He sags, head tipping back and eyes closing. With John's arms still comfortably around him, John trying to resettle the duvet over Sherlock's body, namely his feet, Sherlock goes on.
This is an animatronic. Or a very small, drone-like robot. Controlled by Mycroft, obviously. Or… hm. Those seem to be the only rational options.
He shoves his hands into his pockets and walks, shoes shuffling on the cobblestone roadway.
The blonde mare stops prancing where she stands. Her lips slide back over her bloodied teeth. Her ears droop forward.
Henry baulks. He had never been in danger, but anyone, even Sherlock, that witnesses such a blunt reminder that these horses do not abide by any time schedules, will not wait for a victim to finish a conversation before eating them, is certain to get it through their head. Those crushing teeth had been in Hope’s throat, what seems like only minutes ago.
John’s flat is very small. He could roll over in bed and burn his face on the stove - there’s that, and a sink, so Sherlock could hardly even call it a kitchenette. On the other side, he could slam his face against the dresser, or the tiny metal hearth that must serve as a heater beside it.
Delirious with exhaustion, Sherlock sniffs again, unable to speak. His bottom lip trembles.
Gladstone presses his long face against Hope again, this time harder. Hope pushes him back again.
The notion that this can all disappear like wisps of smoke in an instant, in three days, is disturbing. He reaches, tilts, and presses his mouth to John’s, anyways, the warmth of his lips a profound comfort, which he simmers into with ease, eyes drifting shut. John breathes, short and low, a puff of heat to Sherlock’s bottom lip, and the shiver runs between them both, connecting a wildly electric current.
He flips a few pages forward, over hard lines and a few scrapped sketches or tables or lists.
come ashore. They bring dark magic with them, the kind of magic that can change an entire island.
“Jefferson,” John warns, pushing off the cliffs.
that have plenty of personal space, guided by their prepped and fashionable riders, flashing charmed braids and saddles in Thisby colours, iron bits and flower petals.
“Race?”
“Inside?” John asks, and Sherlock can see his breath fog up in the air. He loves the way John’s eyes fall upon the stained glass doors, loves the way he tilts his head just so, in question. It doesn’t matter what John desires of Sherlock, even if it’s only physical, Sherlock would still treasure him. His heart hurts. He glances away as to not be caught out.
There is something enchanting about the sea at night.
Sherlock sits straight up in the saddle, alert and searching. He snaps his head around, inhales, but there is no smell of salt and vinegar or brine, no red tide, and there is no sound of unearthly wailing.
to ask. You understand this, we can abandon these mores. Does it ever bother you, living on an island? Surrounded by the wolves?” Moriarty taps a pen, one unlucky enough to have found its way into the crux of his fingers, in a beat against his desk. “Three days, until the Races.”
“Hm?” John’s eyes are on the road, reflecting the weak yellow headlights that only pierce several feet ahead in the dark. At least there’s no fog, the car would hardly go anywhere. “No. Do you think I would have? And you were lengths ahead of me, I could barely even recognize you.” Sherlock snorts. John would recognize him anywhere, he’s sure of it.
“Yes.” That’s a particularly old issue, one of the first Sherlock wrote. His personal favorite was categorizing over 240 types of tobacco ash. How far back did Watson look into him? Did he see the tobacco one?
John frowns. “Never. I’ve tried the handles.”

This entire afternoon has been
“Yeah. Can't help it. Keep Redbeard straight,” John thrusts his pencil at the air, making a straight line in nothing, “and you may actually have a chance.”
The mare tosses part of her victim at Sherlock, and the mangled flesh lands before him, matted with fur and sand and blood. Something stringy comes from the joint, waving as if it were an anemone in the crevices in the rocks at low tide.
are no different, turning over the breakers in fast-formed herds that dissolve as quickly as the waves.
Sherlock doesn't not have a water horse, he doesn't have anything to race.
“Christ,” John swears, his breath fanning over Sherlock’s throat. Resounding shivers quake up Sherlock’s chest, making his grip shudder. He tightens his arms around John, the warmth in the room no longer enough. John says, as if hit with the ridiculousness of it all, “You’ve still got your shoes on.”
The stairs to the upper level are dingy but solid, and the wallpaper in the hall here is peeling like the rest of the house. John makes a few comments about replacing it, about fixing the railing on the stairwell, about painting.
with James Moriarty. Why was he here?”
Slowly, his long head turns. Transformation is in progress, his legs wobble and stiffen in slightly bent arcs, flattening themselves. This isn't like Beryl, in her pitiful final moments on the beach. This is strength and power, held back by some feral will. It's incomplete, but Gladstone is changing, all the while seeming to search the company crowds at the finish line.
He can ride bareback - he loves it, powerful muscles beneath him, flexing and mirroring his own exhilaration - but a trip to the town requires a saddle, it's long, and Sherlock doesn't want to risk aches or damages to Redbeard.
Watson, breathing heavy but not panting like Sherlock is trying not to, slaps Gladstone’s wet neck. Sherlock isn’t sure how it got wet. The champion horse isn’t even breathing hard, and yet, has it broken into a sweat? It smells stunningly like salt. This is sea water, dripping from the horse's own pores.
And Sherlock doesn't plan to be out that long. He can only cheat death so much.
There’s something in his eyes tonight. Madness, such that Sherlock has only ever glimpsed before. Gilded insanity, kept secret from mainland mongers and islanders. A sane man can be trusted with power and influence. Letting Sherlock fully see him now is not strategy.
Sherlock knits his brows together. “Who is?”
She’s smiling knowingly. She knows everything. Well, not everything, but somehow, she always has a handle on what’s going through Sherlock’s mind. She lifts a hand to cover one of his, still gripping the magazine, and lowers it to the table, forcing eye contact with a stern motherly gaze.
John squeezes his upper arm.
bite dips into his hand among a mass of shiny scar tissue, the way his other fingers are curled up. The
Afterwards, John falls beside him. His breathing slows. The sweat dries on the back of Sherlock’s neck, an earthly reminder. Tingles shiver under Sherlock’s arm. John faces Sherlock’s profile, silver-blond hair sticking up by his neck, and turns over onto his side.
“Lestrade. Have you opened it, Sherlock?”
Had he known that today was planned to go this way, he would’ve come with John more easily than he already had. The very moment John had arrived at the officer’s station with his mysterious
A flock of white gulls catch the air currents in wide wings and ride the wind along the edges of the cliffs. The ocean laps at Redbeard’s knees,
He walks away, posh shoes dipping the sand as he climbs elegantly back up the hill and out of the cove.
“You got all of that from my watch?”
“The sword,” John says. He pauses. His black boots tickle Sherlock’s skin as he turns around to face Sherlock. Metal armor clinks against John’s strong thighs. “Is that why you sent everyone away? Because I said something about the damned
, either way he has a sizeable collection of fifteenth-century wear, or cutting weapons across the ages. Collectors usually have a time period they prefer and his is obvious. Could be a public collection, could be private. Enough wealth to collect pieces as he sees them. He doesn’t seek them out, the pieces come to him. So, dealers know enough of him to approach
Taken aback, Sherlock forgets the envelope and glances to John from the corner of his eye. Why would John assume he’d spoken to Moriarty at all? Or, is it not an assumption? Had Moriarty changed the parameters of the deal he and Sherlock had struck?
“And you
“Why? Oh, I see, you’re looking for something that pertains to you. No. I did not tell Moriarty all your weaknesses so that he may exploit them. I’m not insane,” back to the envelope, now a little hurt.
They hit the open street, the quay opens up before them, a big gouge out of the island, high as the cliffs, lined with cement and rusted iron railing. Bicycles stack up in between the railing slats, half locked, half unlocked, all pushed up against each other.
“I’m scarlet.”
“What do you mean?”
“Well,” She puts her hands on her hips, the washing towel held in one, “no wonder you’ve never brought anyone home, if your standards are that high, that explains why he’s so handsome, I—”
In that long decade that John worked for Moriarty, never once did he succumb to the spider. It only took Sherlock a month to arrive with no plan, no assistance, and no John Watson.
“You know he has, Anderson. You’ve worked here all your life. You know when the locals leave, and you
No. Not in the Races, not in the middle of them, who would’ve reached over to charm another horse? Who would’ve risked losing an arm, just to hurt another
Before Sherlock can ruminate on that, or even turn back to the DI, Donovan calls out her oh-so-affectionate nickname for him. “Freak,” he hears Sally Donovan’s voice float down the hall. She’s peering into the tall doorway from the corridor, still trying to deal with irritated, pickpocketed, stupid tourists. “You’ve got a visitor.”
The auction weighs on him hard.
“Because I could already see myself losing you, Sherlock,” Moriarty laughs.
“It won’t be - anything. You’ve seen Races before.” Sherlock sits at his usual chair against the table, wondering where John would sit if he were here. Right next to Sherlock, he thinks. He shifts uncomfortably on the chair and crosses his legs under the table.
“I didn’t mean only Jefferson,” John says, shifting his shoulder down. His voice goes low, and Sherlock shivers despite the absence of cold wind. He understands John wants the validation that he is as good for Sherlock as Sherlock thinks John is for him. Maybe it’s not validation, maybe it’s… the feeling of helpfulness.
“Well. I was, you know.” Against the electric street lamps, John’s face is tinged with a pink deeper than that which has been caused by the frigid air. Even in the dark it is visible, framed by the wall of black that Gladstone’s body makes behind him. “If you were, well. I was
Although the night is brisk and the wind spits at them, lifting hair and possibly small dogs away, John’s sleeves are rolled up to the elbow, where his fists are wedged beneath, straining his arms and raising cords of sun-touched muscle.
Now comes his chance. John is not here anymore to advise him against talking to the man who owns half the Island. “Mister Moriarty. I’ve been meaning to have a conversation with you.”
It presses heavily over his shoulders, dense on his back, and his legs and core ache with the riding and fake laughter he’s had to endure all morning. Like the posters say, the Yard is the five-time champion of the Scorpio Races. John’s name has nothing to do with the advertisements. So, how come every buyer, every mainland monger, is here just to see him? To gain his opinion and his knowledge about what-to-do-with-what-jockey? What to bet on? Who will win?
Gladstone raises his head, his lip twitching, little hairs illuminated by the world outside his window.
Mrs Hudson pours the steaming water from the kettle into her meticulously-painted teacups. One, then the other. Sherlock watches her dreg the tea. “And miss it?”
In the sitting room he hears John and his landlady chatting about… whatever ordinary people chat about. The weather, he supposes, or Mrs Hudson is fawning over John’s racing record. Sherlock doesn’t care, so long as Mrs Hudson doesn’t break out some sort of old photo album she must keep under lock and key (not that it couldn’t be picked). He needs to change this horrible clothes.
Hope drawls, “Let me take you for a ride. Let's race…”
Sherlock scoffs, rolls his eyes. John does not look happy about that. Sherlock goes on, rattled, “There isn’t anything he can do to me.” He says. Nothing that Moriarty can do that Sherlock will care about. Mind John.
and men they have felled. They’re almost compelling, as if they are asking to be picked up, to be held, to be used.
“Someone else was here.”
I literally cannot believe I had to add ANOTHER chapter, but an extra showdown scene arrived, which would've placed this chapter WELL ABOVE 25k! but hey, at least now it'll all be tied up by the end. ;) enjoy the last day before the Races - filled with some Moriarty hints and some romance!
leave a comment! :)
“I’ve owned a small house on the west end, it’s got a stable. When you race for that much, you can buy most anything. I live close to Gladstone, though. No use walking two miles in the cold just for work. Figured I would use the place when I retired.”
“Oh,” Sherlock says again. Needs a more intelligent response, “Oh, no. I don't know him.”
” Donovan exclaims. “You’re just going to let the Freak be alone with a crime scene? Without any supervision?”
John smiles fondly at him. Or, rather, Sherlock believes it’s fond, because it’s the same way Sherlock looks at John, when he’s sure the other man isn’t looking. He thinks he may be slipping, ruining his own facade, because the dark ocean far beyond the cliffs and the quay make a lovely background for John, eyes of tidepools and hair of chalk.
Surprised, John glances up at him, then squints. What does this man think he knows about Sherlock? Whatever it is, John knows a lot more. He passes over a few rocks in the paddock, the mare’s hooves trample the sweetgrass. “I don’t think he really ever guesses at all. He’s just brilliantly clever.”
But now, with Watson’s hair slicked back and his clothes soaked and clinging to his bones, there is something swirling in his blue eyes; they hold as much underlying terror as the surface of the November sea. There's red blood on his steady hands, dripping from his wet lips. How could he ever have thought John Watson may not have the heart to race?
For a moment, Sherlock worries that John, moral as he is, may consider sparing Moriarty, truly turning him in to Lestrade. Humane punishment for his unprovable crimes. The anger and grief remains, toiling at what Moriarty has done, what he tried to do to John in the Races. It crushes his mind, his lungs, and his heart.
Sherlock opens his mouth, sucking in a deep breath, and the deductions roll off his tongue, connections crackling with electric sparks as he speaks.
“Because!” Moriarty cries. He wrests Sherlock by the hair back to the ground and Sherlock’s head snaps back, neck throbbing violently. His leg lashes out and he thrusts a foot into Sherlock’s abdomen, blooming bright warm pain. “I am
But the word, “Oh,” is all he can muster. Even that is almost swallowed by the wind that buffets them over the quay.
Moriarty grins, “Neither have I. This changes nothing.” He directs his smile to Sherlock, looking at him up and down.
“Well, that’s what I’m for,” Sherlock says. “Noticing. Haven’t you realized?”
“Two. There’s been a second murder.” Sherlock pulls up the shoulder of his dressing gown, righting it where it has fallen, but doesn’t tie the sash. He wants to give off an air of nonchalance, like he wasn’t a second from disaster all morning. Which he
It is sudden and shocking and instantly, the sky cracks with light for a flashing moment and then is dark again - thunder growls, nearing. But even the rumble cannot cover the piercing noise.
. Sherlock peers at him through his lashes, lips dry and parted, with every part of him that has been kissed flushed red and coarse. He can only imagine what litany of praise will fall from John’s voice should John be inside of him, the closeness that their bodies will afford them, the way their skin will stick together.
Sherlock bites his lip.
want?” Sherlock says, appeased enough by the shell that he leans back down against John’s good shoulder.
s. The suggestion that he should be elsewhere, away from John, is debilitating. Once, if Sherlock had been assured to the destruction of Moriarty, he would cheerfully have accepted his own.
But... Sherlock frowns. Doesn’t quite add up with the image of the man before them all.
“John!” Sherlock exclaims, and they burst into movement, sprinting to cover the man’s tracks and pouring into the lively street, leaping through oncoming cars.
Pleasantly surprised by the lack of any teasing, Sherlock follows Lestrade's lead down the next hallway. Mycroft has been toying with his head all morning. It wasn’t entirely fair to snap at Lestrade - he isn’t the person Sherlock is annoyed with.
Like that, he’s tethered to the island again, unafraid of being swept away by magic.
There are some spectators here above the starting point, and a few racing officials in bright armbands and dreary black waistcoats, but most are quickly traveling away and down the line of the cliffs. They’re headed towards the finish line, where the height of the action will be, no doubt. People get suicidal when they’re nearing the end.
The clean white dog’s collar stands out among his dark robes. Sherlock doesn’t like the way Stamford’s called him out of place. He’d hoped it wasn’t that obvious. Evidently, he’s not that wonderful at disguising himself.
“She did just have her father die,” Lestrade reminded him as he lugged the castle, mounted on a base of thick plywood, very old indeed and splintering in multiple places, up the steps of 221B. His shoulders strained under the material of his jacket. “The least - you could do - was take it--”
”Good. I’ll drive.”
, they’ll
These men are all quiet, going about their chores, and inconsequential.
“You’re not bored now, are you?”
But John clenches his fists over the lead. “Keep out of my way. Keep everyone out of my way.” Klemp hauls open the door and Gladstone jerks at John’s arm, dragging him towards the rain. John drops the hand from his head, which had been tracing veins, in favor of clutching the lead. Brute force does nothing against Gladstone, he pulls John outside.
Although he doesn’t seem to know everything — Sherlock’s actions in favor of John would cause the champion stress, he knows, that overprotective surge within John would push forward, and he could even grow angry with Sherlock — he certainly knows
aren't.”
Finally doing what they came here for, Sherlock delicately plucks the Ford keys off of the ring on the wall. If Mrs Hudson had left them alone where John had put them, they wouldn’t have had to come out and see the cat.
Sherlock risks a glance behind them, enough to see John’s saddle crumple and Mary’s shoulder collide with Gladstone’s. The colors beneath Magnussen’s empty saddle flutter black as Mary hurtles into Gladstone again. The harsh light gleams off a sigil on her hide drawn in sheep’s blood.
Gladstone’s nostrils flare red in the dying afternoon sun, scenting the wind that throws the smell of the ocean towards Sherlock’s clothing, tossing his hair to and fro. His neck keeps arching and then his head dips, and he leans forward, testing John’s patience. John taps Gladstone on the muzzle after the water horse has nosed him, and Gladstone repeals and grunts lowly several times, as though offended.
He groans in relief when Redbeard acquiesces, finally allowing himself to move out of the stall. Sherlock turns Josephine out and into the pasture encircling Mrs Hudson’s property, and saddles up Redbeard after currying off his coat.
“I pick the morning.” Still, he must be difficult.
“Two hundred.”
“Brother,” John points out, quiet. They’re steadily getting closer. Sherlock puts his hand down on the grass between them, so he can balance his weight as he shifts nearer to John. John’s fingers twitch, and he looks down and Sherlock is convinced that John’s going to lay his hand over his. The moment does not come, and it stutters out.
