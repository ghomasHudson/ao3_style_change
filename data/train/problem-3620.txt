Dean managed to convince Sammy to let Dean go solo on this hunt, thank fuck, because he’s 100% certain that if his brother had witnessed the fuckery that went down while Dean was picking out his clothes for the evening he never would have lived down the ensuing hysterics.  First of all,
Completely opposite of what Sam expects, Dean’s face crumples and he looks … scared.  Emotionally scared, not Run Like Hell scared.  He stares at the table and picks at his thumbnail.  Okay, not World Ending Catastrophe, so … oh God, what if something happened to Dean?  What if something happened to Cas?  Dean would never get over it.
"Alright!" Dean turned away from Castiel and picked up the now empty pie container and walked towards the kitchen speaking as he did so "So we know Rowena is looking up Nymph's who can talk to spirits of dead things from Hades. Sounds wonderful." his voice now coming from the kitchen sounded muffled "What is her end game with that trick I wonder"
Letting out his breath slowly, Barachiel was relieved to hear what he had hoped from the young man, but quickly tensed as the young man rushed towards him stopping with his face only a few inches from his own. Anger resonating once again in his voice as he spoke. "I want you to know that if I find out he was dumped in to the Empty after all, I won't give up trying to get him out"
Sitting more upright, his hands clasped around his ears and with shoulders hunched. Dean looked out his side window and then back around the interior of the car. As if he could find the source but he knew he it wouldn't be there. Finally, unable to bear the piercing screech any longer,  Dean grabbed at the handle of the Impala's driver side door and crawled out of the car's interior space and just as Dean's feet hit the soft dirt of the shoulder. Silence. No Seger...road sounds...nothing. Looking around with his body ready to react to any threat, wondering what might be coming his way. Dean continued upwards from the car and when he was fully standing. The pressure that had built up inside his ears caused by the piercing noise seemed to pop and the silence was broken by a gravelly voice that he immediately recognized as coming from his angel and it simply said:
"Dean we need to have this conversation and I need you to focus on what I am about to tell you...and more importantly, about what I am going to ask you to do." Dean looked around the wide open meadow once more looking for a way out and with resignation he turned back to the angel standing beside him and asked "What then? Just tell me what I have to do to save him. You tell me what I have to do to keep him out of the Empty. Because I can tell you if I ever find out that Chuck, Edlund or whatever he wants to call himself sent him there because of the mess HE left behind. I will come looking for him myself and I will do what I need to, to get him out. I killed Death so don't think I won't come after him too" Suddenly, deep inside Dean felt a weariness fill his body. He said the words but he knew deep down that if God had plans to keep Castiel from him there was probably very little he could do about it. Sinking down to his knees and in what sounded to Barachiel defeated softer tone of voice Dean continued "Now tell me so I can get back home, back to..."
As just the song Kashmir began to reach the last refrain, Dean took the opportunity to curl in a little closer to his friend and while nodding his head in time to the music. He softly began to sing along with Page, his eyes never leaving the face that was now hovering a few inches closer to his own.
With something new to focus on Dean sat up straighter in his chair and replied with some sarcasm "Great, Rowena is becoming the Hell-hound Whisperer and is going to get them to sit and roll over. Not to mention: sick'em. Perfect!"
Returning his attention back to the road ahead Dean went to place the figurine on the seat beside him when he felt a slight twinge of his headache returning. Rubbing his forehead with his free hand Dean winced and squeezed his eyes shut just as the headache intensified, like someone was piercing his frontal lobe with nails.
“You see Dean. This opening section of the song, I feel, sums up quite a bit of what I have experienced during my visits here on Earth, the different courses I have taken throughout its early history and because of everything that I have endured as a celestial being and how it has all led me here to this moment- with you. “ At the last word Castiel looked up to meet Dean's eyes.
Dean nodded and felt relief that his brother was not giving up on Castiel. He reflected on the different descriptions he used when defining their relationship with the Angel but the one he always repeated silently to himself was: the one I love. Although he once came clean to Sam about his feelings for Cas years before on a night where both brothers were alone and drinking while sitting on the hood of the Impala.  Dean still could not bring himself to talk openly about his feelings towards Castiel and that they feelings that transcended the term brotherly love. Dean knew his brother would be okay with him being with another man...with Cas. But Dean kept his secret from Cas because it was more to protect himself from being hurt by this very situation. He knew Cas may have to leave one day and he wasn't sure that if he allowed himself to get close and let himself commit, if he would be strong enough to let him go. So he just kept his feelings for Cas buried. But now, in that regard he knew that he wasn't going to be able to just let Cas leave...not with out saying something to Cas first.
They sat in silence a few moments longer each trying to figure out how to break the uncomfortable silence that had settled between them and again it was the Archangel with a small chuckle who broke the silence first.
It made sense because recently, Dean had made it his life’s mission to try and enlighten Cas about music and his favorite shows. Starting with the exciting world of the medical drama: Dr. Sexy, M.D. his brother tried to get the angel as hooked as he was on the drama. From Sam’s perspective things weren’t quite working out the way Dean was intending though.
Even though he had been here on earth living both as angel and human. Cas still did not fully understand relationships or the angst that the humans insisted on placing upon them. In Heaven there wasn't really a male/female dynamic to worry about. Sure, angels tended to express their feelings in a wholly different way with each other if they cared to but Cas had also seen enough during his time here on earth to be confused about how human interaction really was supposed to work. The porn, listening to Dean as he spoke about his time spent with the female of the species. Castiel always felt he could spend another millennium living among the mortals and never come to understand them and their hang ups towards the expression of love and having sex.
They woke up at noon. The last evening had passed them by at a dizzying pace, complete with the sounds of Dean and Ruby constantly teasing each other. After only an hour, Castiel had had enough, but he decided to endure. It didn't pay off for him until three hours later – when Dean was well and truly drunk and all he could talk about was buying red cowboy boots. The kind that Dr. Sexy had. To Castiel, even that seemed preferable to the oppressive clamor between the two grown men. Who would have expected that a man who represented one of the FBI's greatest prides could constantly act like a five-year-old? Yet Castiel loved him. And while he was sometimes able to mutter a quiet ‘Dean, leave me alone. You irritate me’, he still couldn't imagine life without him.
Claire tried to bargain for a while longer, but eventually it dawned on her that Dean was unmoved. When she gave up, she fled to her room. All that could be heard in the background was the sound of her feet hitting the hard floor. As the girl's fathers finished their breakfast and sat at the table, the teenager meanwhile rummaged through her closet. In no time at all, she found a nice, going-out dress and heeled shoes that Charlie, a friend of her parents, had lent her. She changed her clothes and put red lipstick on her lips. Seeing her reflection in the mirror, she smiled triumphantly. She was ready. And even though the club didn't open until nine o'clock, she had already decided to go to her friends. She was willing to do anything to go there. There were going to be a lot of people at the party, and the girl's world was spinning because of them. Determined, Claire put her sneakers on her feet and grabbed her purse and stilettos in her hand. Satisfied with herself, she walked to the window. It was her standard escape route. She was lucky, because there was a fire escape staircase right behind the window sill. However, the smile disappeared from her face as quickly as it had appeared. As Claire tried to lift the window up, she realized one thing – it was locked.
Castiel licked his lips. Without making a sound, he complied with the instructions, making Dean take a moment to demonstrate how much he enjoyed what he was doing. Digging his fingers into the man's exposed skin, he tried not to freak out. He was glad that they were quite a distance from his family. It would be uncomfortable if someone suddenly showed up here and watched Castiel stick two fingers in his ass. For the time being, however, everything was going great. He felt immense pleasure and wanted more. He didn't want to wait, but he knew that he wasn't the one in control here.
"Yes. SInce recently,"he said, sending a smile in the direction of Charlie and Dean. "I moved here a few months ago with my dog and a friend. It is so peaceful here... Completely different from the place we lived in before."
"I hope." A huge smile appeared on Castiel's face. From his perspective, however, Dean saw much more. Towering over the man, he had a perfect view of his face. He watched the man's face with dreamy eyes. The blue eyes, the soft skin, the wrinkles around his eyes that complemented everything. Dean ran his thumb over his husband's lower lip. Slowly, he leaned in and placed a long, sweet kiss on his lips. Claire's comments about how gross they were drowned out their thoughts.
"Is there a favorable one!?" Dean looked at her with annoyance in his eyes, which was quickly replaced by caring once he saw the sadness painted on her face. "Daddy and I love you, kid, but you're sixteen and you need to realize that we're responsible of you. That means we're definitely not going to let you go to some club with shady people. You're a minor, baby. Deal with it."
The man smiled swaggeringly. He couldn't decide if his wanted to watch Castiel's raspberry juicy lips or his innocent eyes. The very idea that he was straight seemed absurd to him, but he saw it as a kind of fun. He felt like changing his preference. To make this man feel powerful and in control. Make him his little toy, with which he could do whatever he wanted. He delighted in the idea and was close to losing control of himself. Because Dean Winchester may have had a slight problem with blood, and maybe - just maybe - he was turned on by the whole incident. However, he didn't want to put it into words. Castiel was just a simple man who only had intercourse with women. He intended to illustrate to him what he was losing.
"Believe it, there's nothing to it." Dean exchanged glances with Charlie. He tried to convey more to her through it than he was able to. However, a certain message got through to her: he wasn't the least bit happy about his brother's plans. Looking at the man, he knew that he was prepared to do anything to thwart his plans. The verdicts of heaven had come down. Castiel had to stay alive. He didn't know why, he didn't know for how long, or if he was going to be useful in the future, but he was going to keep him alive. No matter at what cost.
"Dad, I'm sixteen years old." Claire rolled her eyes. "And now that the conversation has turned to me... I won't be here tonight. I'm going out with some friends."
"No, I'm not going to make up with her." Dean waved his hand. "Last time she called me 'a bitch' because I couldn't tell an alpaca from a camel."
"Why can't she be more like you? The atmosphere at home would be much more relaxing," muttered Dean, kissing the tip of the nose of the man next to him.
Although life on the Red Hill was different from the norm, the nights were spent like normal people. Dean could lie in his bed for hours. Laying on his back, with his hands under his head, he stared at the ceiling and thought incessantly. When finally his eyes grew tired and his body lost strength, he would fall asleep. His dreams were often not the most pleasant. He was visited en masse by memories and illustrated by stories he had heard. However, sometimes something else came up. The same dream over, and over, and over again. A man with cold blue eyes and raspberry lips. Dean was only able to lift his bushy eyebrows up and wait for the young man, riding his bike beside him, and his brother Sam to enter their property. They were in no hurry, which only made him irritated.
"Do you really think that's their intention?" She raised one eyebrow. "They haven't wanted to save anyone for years. They take everyone en masse. There are no extraordinary people, that's why they have no regrets when they get rid of them."
"You clean up nicely," he said when Dean managed to pick up all the pieces of the broken plate on the dustpan without hurting himself in the process.
Silence fell again, which Dean secretly relished. All he wanted was for the birds to sing and the trees to rustle. He didn't want to spend the whole afternoon having another conversation with Charlie about nothing. He had better options. He could sleep, go into town, or watch something on TV. Alternatively, he could take the dog for a walk. That day, he didn't anticipate that his desire to develop a closer relationship with his cousin would surface to any degree. Dean may have been similar to his family, but he felt no desire for their relationship to be flawless.
"Poor guy..." she muttered to Dean as the two disappeared into the threshold of the house.  "He has no idea what awaits him."
"To that new club. They opened it up that week and we want to have some fun there." The girl shrugged her shoulders, then focused her gaze on her phone screen. She was going to do everything she could to get out of this skirmish unscathed.
"What am I supposed to do now?" he whispered directly into Dean's ear, then bit his earlobe. "You want me to fill your ass with my cock? Is that what you want?"
Ignoring Charlie's call, Dean looked at Castiel. The man was sitting next to his cousin - in the armchair he had occupied earlier. He stared intently at the bloodstained stranger and experienced an inner conflict. He did not know how he should behave. He sat, stunned. After a while, when the first shock had passed, Dean dared to hold out his hand towards him. With a gentle smile on his face, he waited for Castiel to grasp his hand and trust him. Although he was a simple, weak man, he had been anointed by the gods. They had entrusted Dean to watch over him, and the man was going to do his duty far better than anyone could have expected.
The three focused back on the show. In this episode, Dr. Sexy was scheduled to perform a risky surgery. No one believed in him except one person – Ellen. For the next forty minutes, the love between the Neurosurgeon and the doctor was shown. By the end of the episode, Dean was crying into Castiel's shirt, mumbling about how perfect they were. Claire merely raised an eyebrow, unmoved. She was used to seeing his emotions win out on average once every two weeks, and Dean liked acting crazy. Castiel embraced Dean and waited patiently for the onslaught of his feelings to pass. What he didn't expect was to have to hold his husband in an embrace for another twenty-five minutes.
"Yes, but they're still just kids." He sighed. Castiel raised his head to look at his husband's face. "I'm really sorry that they were raised like that and that they are this way. I wish I could do something about it, but I can't."
"Sacrifice this kid?" He asked, turning towards his kinsman. "Of course I can! Dean, he will be sacrificed - later this evening. You can't be serious at this point. After all, it was obvious from the beginning that he was going to be executed here! You can't tell me that you feel sorry for him now..."
Dean watched intently as Sam showed the man around the house. All the while he held his forearm in his hand and smiled the most sultry smile Dean had seen in his entire, entire life. It spoke volumes, as he had witnessed obsessive cults and unhealthy loyalty to his gods from an early age. Though he himself had been raised this way, he could not allow their guest to be exterminated. Not this time, when superior forces spoke. Divine intervention was evident to him. He did not know what they had planned, but he intended to follow their path. He was not afraid to take steps forward. He couldn't.
He still understood his purpose, his mission. He was to be a soldier of heaven, defender of mankind, a warrior for God and more importantly, to love humanity as much as he loved God. Castiel had proven himself to be more than proficient in all of his duties. As a proven soldier, he rose through the ranks under Michael's command. Serving with distinction in several battles, some of battles that never made it into mankind's biblical lore but there were some battles that did make it into lore. Chief among them, the battle that was fought between the armies of Heaven and Satan and it was this battle that cast Lucifer from Heaven permanently and put Heaven's most impudent guardian angel on all of the Archangel's radar. His reputation had always been one of being a fierce warrior and had even been known as a brutal one but he never really carried out orders in a way that they were intended. Often times, he would look for ways to minimize any casualties or damage done. He always believed that redemption could be attained through reflection. So, when given an order to punish those who committed acts that were perceived as transgressions against their Father. Castiel would often look for ways to save those who he thought could be redeemed before rushing in and slaughtering in their Father's name. This often flew in the face of Michael or direct his Commander Barachiel and their expectations of Castiel. He could not remember what had caused him to change and he suspected he had Naomi to thank for that. But he began to have doubts about what they did on earth in their Father's name and it didn't help that there were rumors being circulated by the Cherubim, that their Father had not been the one actually giving the orders anymore. The Cherubim hinted that God had decided to take a vacation and that no one knew exactly where he had gone. This all started after his first stint on earth working directly with modern mankind, a boy named David became his first charge as a guardian angel. It was watching this boy grow to manhood and then create a nation that allowed Castiel to see mankind's potential and there fore worth risking everything to save them. So he began to use subtle ways to subvert any orders that were given that conflicted with his new found loyalty to humans. And when the rumors about their Father appeared to be true, that he had in fact left for parts unknown with no instructions, no information nothing...just a huge void. Well, it hit the first order of angels, the Archangels especially hard. For there was no order of angels more tightly connected their Father than the first order. Except for Lucifer, he saw it as an opportunity. And as the length of time grew with no word, that void began to grow even larger and more ominous because the Archangels were left to their own devices and it was Lucifer who began whispering from his cage and he began to find away to fill the void with his own desires, Castiel, had no doubt that Lucifer saw the weakness in his Brothers and began to whisper lies about God and the reasons for his absence to the lesser angels and cherubim. Then as their doubts grew he fed them seditious ideas and when those took hold and it wasn't long before Lucifer got his first visit from his curious Brother: Rafael and it was with that visit. The seeds to take earth back for the angels began to take root in heaven.
Although he never had it easy, Castiel overcame every disadvantage that fate threw at his feet. At the age of nineteen, he learned that his then girlfriend was pregnant. As a poor student carrying the burden of student loans on his shoulders, he could not imagine how his life could have turned out. He was in despair. Neither did Amelia, who made it clear she wasn't going to give up her future for the child of the man. And nine months later she was born – Claire. A ray of his own personal sunshine. Since then, Castiel has done everything he could to provide her with a decent life. Though he had risked many times and lost even more often, in the moment everything was perfect. Just like any other day, he closed the candy shop, on his way he stopped by the poor family living across the street to give them food, then headed home. His dear, warm little house. A smile appeared on his face at the thought of taking off his coat, warming himself by the fireplace, and spending a little time with his family.
"Whatever you plan," he replied, shrugging his shoulders. After a while he bounced off the wall and stood a metre behind his brother. Although he was afraid and had doubts, he looked for support in himself. He told himself that everything would be fine. He would not be haunted by dreams and frightening looks. He believed in his gods and in their will. If they thought Castiel was worthy of committing murder, he wasn't going to back down. The dagger he turned in his hand was going to be used. Sam's blood would coat the blade and become a sign of loyalty to his Lord.
Castiel had been driving home for nearly half an hour. As usual, the streets were crowded, and the snow that covered them didn't make anything easier. During the ride back, Castiel repeatedly buried his head in his hands and sent Dean eight messages in which he wrote the question, 'can I kill myself?'. Unfortunately, Dean didn't think it was the brightest idea in the world. By tapping out a short but firm 'no,' he let his partner know that he needed to get home with his head unshot. When he finally arrived, complaints about the decision he'd made were replaced by hellos.
"In the end you woke me up anyway, but at least I feel much better now," said Castiel, tucking his head into the blond man's flannel shirt. - I slept like a baby."
"Really, Cas. You can be stubborn and you're more awkward than I was when I met your family, but I don't know what I'd do without you."
Dean had been holding Castiel's hand for a long time. Their fingers were intertwined and their hearts were beating fast. The man was still tingling with adrenaline. He felt a thrill that made him extremely excited. His pupils dilated and his mouth craved sweetness. Dean looked intently at the brunet beside him and searched for a way to get close to him in some way. Now that he had done the will of the gods, he felt that he had been given him as a gift for good behavior. He was to become his sweet reward for doing their will. It suited him just fine.
Today, Dean gazes out, breathing calmly. But many years ago, he couldn't control the torrent of tears that flowed from his eyes. Dean had endured this endless battle for his little brother. He knew all too well that if he wasn't strong enough, no one would be for Sammy. That's how he lived until he was eighteen. Then he took his brother and ran far away from the man he hated with every, frayed piece of his heart. It took him many years to put himself back together. And looking back on it from a distance, he knew that Castiel had invested the most in him. The man he was going to spend the rest of his miserable life with.
Sam waved towards his brother, then pulled his companion towards the house. Dean could only stand and survey it all with curiosity on his face. He carefully watched the steps they took. He analysed their pace and the poses they assumed. His focused eyes did not notice when the short man turned towards him and sent him a warm, sincere smile. Charlie saw it too. The woman rose from the chair she was sitting in. She watched as Sam walked inside with the handsome brunet. She licked her lips, instantly sympathising with him. He seemed like a nice, innocent soul who hadn't done anything bad to anyone. She hated it when it fell on just such.
"What I'm trying to say..." he continued, ignoring the man's words, "...that our only job is to make sure that Claire grows up to be a righteous citizen who will be happy, educated and sensible. Nothing else matters and it certainly isn't the responsibility of any of us."
-"And did you by any chance have a fight with Sam recently? Because from what I remember, I put a bag of ice on your face after he hit you."
The man leaned with his back against the armchair. He lifted his head up to look at the red sky towering above them. Although it was obscured by tree branches, he still searched for that colour. He knew that if he just moved his chair a metre forward, he would have a completely different view. However, Dean liked where he sat. He had done this activity for most of his life. This old porch had become his favourite place on the whole hill. He would come here when he was tired, distracted, angry, or happy. In this place he could clear his mind of all unnecessary thoughts, and perhaps that was why he decided to ignore Charlie's presence that day. He only wanted to experience the comfort of silence and the red sky. He did not even care about the presence of his meddlesome cousin, who loved to meddle in other people's affairs and try to make up their stories as she wished.
His nickname. The one that reminded him of the day they met. Dean thought back to that autumn evening more than once. Dean was just coming back from work from himself. The freshly minted FBI agent was sick of the position. He hated the fact that everyone pushed him around. They called him "Ken" because of his flawless beauty, and while he was trying to focus on his duties, there was always someone who wanted to force him to go to the candy store. And that's what happened this time. A man named Garth forced him to run three blocks in the rain, only to encounter a "closed" sign on the door of the FBI's favorite pastry shop. "Oh, seriously!", exclaimed a frustrated Dean, then hit the surface in front of him. He couldn't go back to the office empty-handed. Everyone would kill him and no one would care. After all, it was the damn FBI.
'Screw it!' he thought, then slowly moved his hand towards Dean's zipper. Mixed feelings ran through him, but he knew he wanted to experience this. No - he was desperate. He was breathing heavily and his hands were sweating, but he wasn't going to stop. He ignored the look Dean was giving him. He undid the zipper and two buttons, while giving Dean a bit of space. Taking the initiative, Castiel sat down on his knees and slid his companion's jeans down to mid-thigh. He took a moment to observe his body. A grey vest protruded from under his unbuttoned shirt, which had risen a little so that his belly could be seen. The red boxers were swollen by his erection. His lips were parted and his pupils were wide. Dean looked thirsty, which didn't make his task any easier. Castiel felt a strong need to get what he wanted. Moaning loudly, he grasped the material of his black trousers, then releasing Dean from them. The man, in response, pulled off his shirt and tossed it aside.
The next day Dean was the first to wake up. He sat on the edge of the bed for a long time, watching his sleeping husband. A small smile crept across his face as he carefully studied the silhouette of the man next to him. Dean glided his fingers across the man's chest, tracing every mole and the smallest birthmark, taking pride in its beauty. He was delighted. He didn't know how long it took. As if in a trance he could do nothing else. He felt a strong need for physical contact. That was why he stroked his skin for a long time, until finally – bored – he placed a long kiss on Castiel's lips, thus waking him up.
Dean and Cas spent the rest of the day 'sickening Claire's life', as the teenager put it.  Every now and then, they cuddled, watched weird TV shows, and ate cake. They did the usual things. In the afternoon, Sam called, to which Dean responded by delivering a long monologue about how no witch should judge him because he couldn't tell a camel from an alpaca. And though Cas rolled his eyes more than once as he listened to his husband, he placed a kiss on his cheek when he finished talking. Dean could be a mental child, but Castiel loved him despite everything; nothing could change that and vice versa. They were everything to each other. There were no values greater to them than selfless love and family, and that was all they had with each other. They were happy.
"You do realize that I bloody love you, don't you?" Castiel asked in a tired voice, closing his eyes. He began to listen to the beat of his husband's heart. It was calming him.
"Teenage girl," Dean replied, straining for mischief in his voice. They had done this many times before and it didn't look like they were going to stop anytime soon.
"Ah..." said Castiel, wanting to satisfy Dean with his answer. He didn't really have a clue about the things he was saying, but for his own good, he preferred to nod than end up like Sam. He wasn't going to be murdered right after great sex.
"Oh, dear..." Dean sighed. "Don't worry about it. He threatened you. You don't want to know what his plans were. Believe me, it's better this way."
"No, you're not!" He replied, slamming his fist on the table. "Claire, you are sixteen years old. You live under our roof, we support you and buy you everything. Hell, you can't even cook your own noodles, and you say you can take care of yourself!"
"Shut up, I mean it." Dean kissed the top of Castiel's head. "Sure, Doctor Sexy is an incredibly attractive man, and his cowboy boots only add to his sex appeal, but I wouldn't trade you for him. And I mean it, Cas!"
Dean spent the next few dozen minutes kneeling beside his brother's body. The red sun illuminated the dead man's face. The expression on his face was terrified and anxious. Dean began to wonder if this was also his soul now. Lost and frightened, or perhaps fleeing from the wrath of the gods. The man saw how much blood had been spilled from his miserable body. The once white carpet had turned red, and the stain on the floor was yet to come off. He wondered if he should clean it himself, or leave it to Charlie, who parlayed the cleaning of the crime scenes Sam liked to call 'altars'. Now he himself had become the reason the Wincheste's descendant had to scrub the floor on his knees.
"Claire, come down here for a minute! You have to go to the store!" shouted Castiel, desperately wanting his daughter to cooperate for once. Because of the intensity of last weekend, Dean and Cas hadn't had a chance to have sex, something they wanted to rectify at the moment.
Although little Claire was raised well, never caused trouble, and her grades were impeccable, bad people stuck to her like a Band-Aid. Many times she found "new friends" in the middle of nowhere, or in a completely random location, which often led to one thing: Dean's intervention. His boss called him every time he found any connection between the Winchesters' daughter and juvenile delinquents. Bobby was a good man, and his relationship with Dean and Castiel seemed to be exemplary. At least once a week, he'd stop by their house for a beer and call Dean a "moron." He was a second father to him.
"I understand that you liked it," said Castiel, smiling proudly at the man. After a while he took a seat next to him. To his surprise, Dean bit his lower lip and did something unexpected. He hugged him. "You liked it. I got it."
They spent the afternoon together. Dean and Castiel occupied the couch across from the television. Of course – as they did every Saturday afternoon – they watched Dr. Sexy, M.D., which was Dean's favorite show. He had watched it every week since he met Castiel, or even longer. This time was no different. The man was following the action on the TV screen with a dreamy gaze while he held a plate of pancakes in his hands. And although Castiel constantly made fun of his little obsession, he cut Dean's pie into pieces and fed him. Claire had her own opinion on the matter as well, but she had long ago decided not to mention it. Her parents made an odd couple, but she loved them more than anything, and Doctor Sexy couldn't prevent that.
After a while, as Dean massaged his testicles while simultaneously sucking hard on his cock, he grasped his face in both hands and slowly pulled away. Dean licked his lips, then looked into Castiel's eyes. He didn't know what was happening until Castiel held out his hand towards him. The man took advantage of the assistance. A few seconds later, he was standing on even feet and he could feel Castiel pressing against him. The stiff member touching his stomach was making him frustrated. Breathing slowly, he waited for Castiel to satisfy his need. However, he didn't seem to have that in mind. For the time being he roamed his mouth along the man's neck. He sucked and bit, irritating his delicate skin. He wasn't the slightest bit gentle, which Dean loved. The moment he put two fingers to his left nipple and started rubbing - a sound came from between Dean's lips. A loud, desperate moan that was meant to show Castiel how desperate and ready he was for the final act.
Sitting back in his own chair. Allowing his voice to lose some of its formality. He added "I think at the last moment, Castiel. He may have taken pity on you just a bit." Barachiel raised his glass and gulped down the last of his whiskey. Then continued "You should have seen Lucifer and Michael when he showed you this little leeway of staying to say goodbye."
This time, Castiel could hear the heartache in Dean's words, and there was something else. Tilting his head slightly as if he needed tune in like an antennae. Castiel realized what he was hearing was the unmistakable sound of fear.
Sam gave his brother a big smile and a wink and with some humor in his voice replied “Don’t worry Dean. You could be right and this could be nothing. Which means you and Cas could be back here in just a few days doing whatever it is you two were doing together.” And before Dean could give a retort, Sam spun on his heel and left his brother’s room with a small smirk playing on his lips.
Dean looked at his brother and with some fatigue in his voice replied "I have other business I need to focus on. Crowley and his mother are on their own when it comes to their relationship. We are not butting in on this. At least not unless, they drag us in."
Of course, he knew how to love...or more to be more accurate how to make love. April, the Reaper, had made sure of that. Reflecting on his time spent as a mortal and his time with her that one night after she had rescued him from an alleyway. Castiel had to admit that although it was nice and it did feel good. There wasn't a time while he was with her that the thought of Dean did not at some point insinuate itself into his mind. He even wondered while kissing April if Dean's lips would have been as soft. Then of course. He knew that an unshaven Dean Winchester would definitely not been smooth. With a start Castiel shook himself out of his reverie and pushed his thoughts of Dean to the side. Looking around at the park with all of its undulating green lawns and trees. Studying the people wandering along its winding pathways. He wanted to try and retain this image so that wherever he ended up he could call up this image of tranquility, of humans at peace.
He wanted to give his friend a warming smile. "Dean. Someday, hopefully a very long time from today. You will come to Heaven and when you do. There is hope that I can come and visit you."
“Otherwise, everything I have been through and what the Boys have endured at the hands of my Brothers. And your father...” Castiel swallowed and searched Claire's face for understanding. “What he sacrificed will have been wasted.” with compassion he continued “My Father asked me to love humanity more than Him and to watch over you. Which I did and what I would do again despite the pain and suffering...and the dying.”
Worry and shame crept across his face. It wasn't so much that Crowley just admitted to the new cages being built and what that may mean for his outcome but that he seemed to know so much more about what was going on upstairs than he did.
Teaser: Castiel is on trial for his life. No one will stand with him in Heaven to help defend him. So there is only one being he can think of that would be clever enough and ruthless when it came to being a good lawyer. Crowley. And he knows it would piss Lucifer off to no end.
His reverie at the sight was broken by the sound a low groan coming from his brother. Sam ran over to Dean in order to help with the burden he was trying to support. Wrapping his long arms around both men and he helped to guide them as they slid down as one, the side of the Impala's front panel. Dean made sure to land with Castiel's...no Jimmy's (he would not call the body Castiel ever again) head cradled in his lap.
Feeling uncomfortable, Castiel walked across the kitchen floor and over to where he could glance through the opening leading to the main room he continued. "Um...lately I have found that I miss being myself, my true self" turning back to face Dean he continued. "So, that is where I was."
Dean entered the study with a fresh beer and saw Cas studying of the many religious themed paintings that hung throughout the large room. Dean took advantage of the moment to study his best friend more closely. The painting that seemed to have a particular hold on his Cas was the one that Sammy had called the Fallen Angel. He could not recall the painter's name but of course when Sammy would try to educate him about the rare artwork hanging throughout the bunker. Dean found it difficult to focus for very long on what his brother was telling him. The subject of the painting that had captured all of Cas' attention featured a dark winged angel whose body seemed to have landed upon a jagged outcropping of rocks, his supine body writhing in agony, an arm was raised and bent so as to cover the lower portion of the fallen angel's face and the part that remained exposed. Well, Dean could never tell if the eyes were conveying anger or shame in response to his falling. Looking from the painting and down at Cas then back again. Dean suddenly had a bad feeling settle in and he wanted to get rid of it the only way he knew how. Confront whatever it was that posed the problem.
Dean continued "How much time do we have?" Sam looked at his watch and said "We have about seven hours left."
"Yes. Um, creatures like nymphs, faeries, mystical forest creatures and creatures of the Underworld."
Castiel could not help but smile “Barachiel told you about him. Well, yes. His was strong but Dean yours...yours is far more incredible. It's why Michael wanted you, Amara was drawn to you and even in some way Crowley saw your soul as being different. Though I think Crowley still underestimated it.”
Finally, with Dean looking up at Cas in a lust filled hunger. He rolled his hips upwards and brought his raised his ankles up close to either side of Cas' shoulders and instinctively, Castiel grabbed each one and as Dean guided his now dripping cock towards his hole. Castiel began to ease it forward and in.
Dean and Castiel immediately ruled out continuing their conversation about Ruby. The men contacted each other with that familiar look that expressed more than it should. Claire noticed it as well. The girl mentally sighed, knowing what awaited her now. Another lecture. Although she loved her parents, she found them definitely overprotective as well as annoying. Sometimes she just had enough of them.
"So his name is Castiel!" she whispered, looking intently at the man. He nodded in reply and then gave her a small smile. "I'm Charlie and this is Dean. It is a pleasure to meet you."
When Dean lifted his gaze, he saw the most beautiful man in his life, dressed in a coat. Because of the weather, his hair was wet with rain, but it didn't look like he was going to close the window. He stared intently at Dean with his huge blue eyes and waited patiently for him to say what was bothering him. Of course, Winchester being the intimidated and awkward man that he was, muttered a lot of unnecessary sentences to spout why he was kicking in the door of the pastry shop at ten-thirty in the evening only after ten minutes of exchanging awkward eye contact. At least that's what Dean called it. Castiel openly admitted that he gloated over his beauty.
"I'm going to go change. Bobby and Sam should be here soon," he replied, poking his head out from behind the dividing wall separating the stairs from the living room.
When he finally finished kissing his torso, Dean slowly, without thinking, pulled Castiel's white boxers down. In doing so, he slowly bit his lip. When he finally got rid of the unnecessary underwear, Dean began his work. His warm hand grasped Castiel's member. He heard a quiet moan in return. He wasn't going to hide it – it satisfied him. He ran his hand down its length a couple of times, but stopped when Castiel's hand pulled his.
Surprising though it may have been, Dean knew stuff. For the next few minutes he repeated the action he had done earlier, driving Castiel insane. He massaged his member, rotated it, and repeatedly duplicated all the movements that brought him one step closer to driving Castiel into a state of ecstasy. When he finally decided to taste him, Castiel could barely stand on his even feet. He drove his fingers into the man's scalp and moaned in pleasure. In response he would get Dean, who would lick the head of his cock, stopping every now and then to gently blow cold air. It gave Castiel pleasure, but he felt tormented. All he wanted was for him to stop and let him take complete control. And that's exactly what he did.
For the next couple of minutes he repeated the action he had performed earlier. He slid out of him, then drove him into a white fever. For Castiel himself it was an unforgettable experience. He loved the way Dean's hole tightened around his member and provoked him to move more boldly. Creating a fast, melodic rhythm, that afternoon Castiel f than ten minutes later, desperately and rapidly approaching the big finish. He felt that Dean was not far away either. His breathing was short and broken. He was panting directly into his ear, struggling to hold on to his limbs. If he could, he would have fallen exhausted to the ground, but excitement motivated him to last a few minutes. Therefore, clenching his hands into fists, he bucked up and let Castiel finish. He felt it slam against his prostate at an unmerciful pace and thrust its fuucked Dean - in the simplest of terms. Because there was no other definition of the act he had undertaken. A fast, powerful and extremely satisfying action that made him, no morell length into him.
Eventually Dean and Castiel stopped hugging each other. The dark-haired man sat down on the countertop and began a conversation with the other. They discussed few things as well as joked around. At the same time, Dean focused on finishing making breakfast. Breaking a plate had hindered him, but now he was making quick work of it. After fifteen minutes, they brought a pile of toasts and drinks to the table. Of course, Castiel had cut up the vegetables and personally stuffed Dean with them. Although his chosen one was thirty-four years old, he often acted like a teenage boy. His policy that annoyed Castiel the most was the one where he claimed he 'wouldn't eat rabbit food'. To which the other more than once told him that he would not sit and watch him get a heart attack.
Dean and Castiel both had difficult childhoods. Castiel was the youngest, and when all his brothers moved away and cut off from their family, he was left alone with his schizophrenic mother and a father who worked forever. Dean, on the other hand, took care of his younger brother all his life. After his mother died in a fire when he was four, his father became unavailable and spent his free time thinking about what ifs. And though most of the time he went out to the bar or worked, sometimes he had a lot to complain about to Dean. He was then able to speak in one language – the language of aggression.
lived in a two-story apartment in downtown Washington. They were no different from their neighbors. Castiel worked in a pastry shop that, among other things, was famous for having its baked goods delivered straight to the white house. Every Thursday and Tuesday, he personally transported dozens of baked goods, which he prepared with his co-workers, Fergus, Anna, and Hannah, starting at four in the morning. The pastry shop was Castiel's pride. It was as if it were yesterday he remembered when he opened the place at the age of twenty-three. Debt-ridden and desperate, he spent the next year grasping at every opportunity that came his way, but it had paid off. By now Castiel was thirty-six years old, had a sixteen-year-old daughter named Claire, a picture with the president, and the greatest husband in the whole world.
"Hey, hey... Listen to me carefully." Dean grasped the man's chin and lifted it up gently. Their eyes met. That warm green with a soft blue. Like years ago. "You have no reason to be sorry. Especially since they're not poor kids. I checked all their records. Their parents hold high positions and they go to private schools. They are just trying to show how cool they are. It's not a big deal. I was there too, and look: I grew up to be a decent person!"
"I think I'm going to live." He nodded. "Don't get me wrong: I feel dead now, but I'll recover and I'll tell you one thing - it was amazing."
"He has beautiful eyes... I have seen them many times before. I don't want to know that they will stop shining tonight."
"Oh. Well..." He shrugged his shoulders. It was obvious that he felt uncomfortable. He didn't expect to spend the evening at the table with Sam's family.
Castiel grasped the erection he prided himself on in his hand. He took a moment to prepare himself, then pressed Dean against one of the walls of the old shed. The paleness of his skin mingled with the white paint. Castiel drew in a breath, then glanced at his beloved with his eyes. He looked at the profile of his face, which showed pure excitement and desperation. His lips were red and swollen. He was panting, making his chest rise and fall in the blink of an eye. He pressed his hands against the wall, grasping the points of attachment. His juicy buttocks were exposed and ready for anything. Castiel brought a hand to his face and then plucked his fingers. Not wanting to cause Dean any pain, he gently smeared his member with lube, then moved closer to the man at the shed. Although Castiel was scared, he wanted to do it. His thoughts were focused on how different it could be from what he had experienced so far. He had hundreds of visions and his own theories, but he decided to find out through experience. Gaining courage, Castiel began the penetration.
"For a month, dear cousin. For a month," Dean pointed out, restraining his reluctance to come to the surface.
"The usual."  He shrugged. "I spent the whole morning doing paperwork because nobody else wanted to, and then I got acquainted with a new case. By the way: one of Claire's colleagues got to us. He's suspected of murder."
Dean and Castiel somewhere between "oh yeah, Cas, harder" and "don't stop", lost track of time. They were lucky that Claire decided to come home only three hours later. Okay, maybe Dean's craving for a pie that was only sold on the other side of Washington had something to do with it. The couple had a chance to get their needs met twice, take a hot shower together, and Dean could bluster at Ruby in peace and not be shushed by Castiel. Although he didn't like it, he was glad he wasn't doing it in the presence of his child. Claire didn't need to enrich her already extremely colorful vocabulary with more epithets that Dean so loved.
“Good morning, Dean,” he murmurs and adjusts his position, seemingly unconsciously, to be closer to where Dean stands at the fridge, even as he turns his back to pour himself a cup of coffee.
sexual scared him, but this did.  It wasn’t the sex itself, exactly – the only thing that gay dudes do that Dean hadn’t done with a girl would be sucking another guy off – but more that when it came to Cas, sex wouldn’t be “just sex” as Benny had said.  It wasn’t just that it would be sex with a guy; it was that it would be sex with
.  And there I was, scared shitless not just for myself but thinking my best friend was out there terrified and crazy and in danger.  It fucking broke me just thinking that you might need me and I couldn’t get to you.”
The seraph had nearly gotten himself killed no less than three times that day due to sheer inattention.  Had he been using his senses, he could have easily intercepted the attacks, but his mind seemed to be drowning in the weight of the hormones coursing through his veins.  He nearly pulled his hair out in frustration.  Was this how humans felt all the time?  So swamped with lust just being in the same vicinity as their lover that they could barely function, barely think of anything else but the need to touch that person, to feel hot breath on their mouths, fingertips on their skin?  If so, then Castiel would most definitely have to revise his opinions regarding human reserves of willpower.  Every glance at Dean seemed exquisite torture, teasing of the promise to come under the cover of darkness.
“Because it’s too fast,” he said.  “Because I don’t want to fuck this up.  Jesus, Cas, I don’t even have anything to make this easier—”  when Castiel turned to stare back at him with a raised eyebrow, he clarified, “a condom.  Lube.
Quick and fun side note from last chapter that I forgot to mention --- I made reference to Bancroft, Idaho as the location of their upcoming job and that they were 17 hours into a cross-country journey from their LAST job in a rinky dink town in New York state.  Bancroft ID actually is a tiny town of approx 450 people and Omaha/Lincoln IS approximately 17 hours into the journey from my hometown in New York to Idaho.  I couldn't resist, seeing as how there are is a couple down the road from me who own a 1960s black Impala.  Every time they pass my complex, I shout, "It's Sam and Dean!"
I hope you enjoyed this little jaunt, despite how long it took me to finish it and get it up here.  I know that some of the facts have been disproven or changed since I wrote it (before season 9 happened), but I still feel really good about it as a whole.  Hope you did too.
“You know that you don’t have to do anything you don’t want to, right?  I mean, I know you want to with your body, but … you don’t have to please me because you feel you’ve got something to prove after ditching me.  I know that you don’t really have a ton of experience with keeping a clear head when you’re all riled up, but you
Cas huffs but smiles as he settles back down onto Dean’s shoulder.  They’re both quiet for a long time and it feels … comfortable.
If he doesn’t, don’t let that stop you.  Find another guy who will.  Or, hell, come back to Atlanta and find me.”
“No, it isn’t.  You’re different than me.”  Dean’s eyebrows drew together over his bright green eyes.
This time, Cas doesn’t even have to flick his hands; an invisible pressure squeezes down on Dean’s wrists and he’s pinned there like a butterfly again.  The force of Cas’s Grace isn’t the only thing holding him to the wall, though, and Dean can’t help but notice the hot rising of Cas’s flesh beneath where his weight rests on the angel’s hips.
His eyes fluttered shut as he leaned back against the tree that towered above the two of them, reaching out with his Grace to scan for enemies and finding only the lingering, cold presence of the vampire, stalking in ever-widening circles around their tiny encampment.  Though the two of them had exchanged no words as Dean settled in for the night, Castiel was grateful that the vampire seemed to understand the angel’s need to stay with his friend, watch over him as he slept even though the hunter certainly would extend the angel neither speech nor kindness.  Another piece of Castiel’s penance; another item on a list that never seemed to stop growing.
Dean chortles.  “Fuck if I care right now.” He leans in again and Cas dodges.  “Hell, Cas, sex is best when it’s a little dirty.”  Because the angel still looks skeptical, Dean adds, “Also, I had literally just gotten out of the shower when you showed up and decided to christen my undercarriage for me.  Between the shower and the tongue bath, trust me, it’s all good.”
His pulse spikes pretty much immediately as he considers those bright blues eyes that tear through him with laser intensity.  Eyelids fluttering shut, Dean grazes his palm against the fly of his jeans, his erection building as he imagines the angel’s acute stare directed at him, glazed over with lust.  He gasps in a breath and chafes his hand over his pants more firmly, letting his thoughts drift towards slim, graceful fingers and how they would feel against the hot skin of his abdomen.  He lowers the zip on his fly, pushing jeans and boxers down below his hips in one swift movement.  In his head, the hand wrapping around his achingly hard erection is pale and slender but strong, cool against his heated skin, and Dean can’t help the way his hips leave the mattress as he thrusts into his own palm.
“And last night, despite putting me into the role of performing oral sex on you and then being prepared to be penetrated, you kept
Sam’s smile drags across his face slow.  “Yeah, but on the up side it could also get some trouble into me.”
Sam’s smile drags across his face slow.  “Yeah, but on the up side it could also get some trouble into me.”
Nervous energy suffused the air as Dean wordlessly moved to press Castiel’s open palm flat against his sternum.  Castiel felt the fingers that ghosted over his own tremble as they slowly guided his palm down the slope of Dean’s chest.  The jump of Castiel’s heart within his vessel seemed to synchronize with the hitch in Dean’s abdomen as their joined hands passed over the ridges of muscle beneath the cotton shirt.  Dean’s back pushed against Castiel’s as he took a few more steady breaths.  The action seemed to calm him because Dean managed to draw their tangle of digits past his waist until Castiel’s fingers bumped into then slid over the bulge straining beneath well-worn denim.
“And you changed everything, man.  Everything.  Especially after fucking Purgatory.  When I found you by that river and I hugged you?  Damn it, Cas, my heart raced like it was trying to leap out of my chest and into yours.  And once I got out … you know how many times I’ve gotten laid since Purgatory, Cas?  Eight.  Eight times in almost four years.  Hell, I used to get laid eight times in a freaking weekend.  And you know what?  Just between you and me?  When you got out and you came out of that bathroom, all angel-mojoed and clean-shaven and with that stupid trench coat clean again … I popped wood, dude.  Like out of nowhere, BAM.  Inappropriate boner, right in front of my freaking brother.”  Dean sighs.  “I should have known then.”
“When I was living with—” he’d been about to say ‘Lisa’, but didn’t think he could bring himself to do so.  “—without Sammy.  Had to fill the time somehow, you know?  No big bads means I had to develop actual hobbies like normal people.  You know, grilling, yard work, little league teams.”
“Dean!” Castiel boomed, clasping a firm hand to his friend’s shoulder and grabbing his upper arm to stop the lethal swing of his blade.
Without waiting to see Dean's nod, Sam strides to the front door of the club, throws it open, glares out into the parking lot, and then stalks back to Dean.
Cas’s mouth quirks up again for a moment and then the expression becomes sharp.  “Then you should have no problem giving me what I came here for.”
In the end, he didn’t say anything to the man though, because he couldn’t really justify that it was his place.  And if he were truthful about it, at least to himself, the vampire couldn’t say he wasn’t a little bit jealous.  As tangled up and crazy as the relationship between the mentally-fried hunter and his bucket of Hot Wings was,  Benny didn’t miss the signs of ruthless devotion in Dean’s manner, as if every atom of his being was dedicated to bringing the angel back to the waking world unharmed.  What really sizzled the vampire’s bacon was how little that self-righteous hypocrite seemed to deserve the hunter’s loyalty.  The angel bandied between a never-ending stream of whining apologies and meekly suggesting that they leave him behind at the end of each day.  As if the nonstop murder frenzy they’d endured just to find the feathery bastard were beneath his mention.
Dean didn’t respond, so Castiel raised himself up as much as he could without breaking Dean’s hold on his arm and placed his mouth near Dean’s ear.
“I know, but—” Dean sighed.  “No euphemisms until you’ve proved you can use them without making me feel violated.”
While he could detect nothing obviously wrong with Dean, Castiel felt certain that something was amiss.  Still wrapped in Castiel’s arms, the hunter held himself unnaturally rigid, every muscle straining with the effort to keep still.  His position had not changed, though, so Castiel could only surmise that this exertion served to keep his current position.  Castiel couldn’t help feeling more than a tad bamboozled.  Their physical proximity had increased slightly more than usual – with Dean’s knees bent and drawn up, Castiel needed to curl around him more than previous nights – but it didn’t differ so radically that it would explain his friend’s discomfort.  Dean didn’t show any signs of emotional distress or nightmares; in fact, when Castiel pulled himself up on one elbow to examine Dean’s face, he found the hunter’s eyes open and staring fixedly at a spot far ahead of him in the forest.
“Leveraging your weakness?” Dean says, and why the hell can’t he seem to keep from parroting what Cas says?  But seriously,
Dean couldn’t help but smile.  “ ‘A more prudent source of lubrication’.  Man, you know I love it when you talk nerdy to me.”
“Tell me, Dean: do you taste the way you smell?  No matter how frequently you bathe, you always smell the same.” Cas presses his nose to the hollow of Dean’s throat just below his ear and inhales deeply.  “Like whiskey and leather and motor oil and gunpowder.”  He pulls in another lungful.  “And cinnamon.”
“Hot damn,” Dean says, and then pounces forward, pushing Cas onto his back and pinning him to the mattress.  “You are,” he says, planting kisses that trail from the angel’s jaw down his chest, “without doubt,” tonguing over his nipples earns Dean a heavy inhalation, “the best thing,” a bite to his middle has Cas’s stomach muscles bunching, “to ever happen to my sex life.”
“Don’t look at me like that; I didn’t say I agreed with Dad.  In fact, I think I've made it pretty damn clear that I don't.”  Now it’s Sam’s turn to smirk. “And based on the bet I made with Alex, I’m actually coming out on top.”
“Pleasure, Dean,” he says calmly.  “I came here for every single sinful pleasure your body can give.  Maybe I should just take it from you.  But where to start?”
Cas’s chest heaves as he breathes, never taking his eyes away from Dean’s as he thrusts out a hand to ‘summon’ the condom from wherever the hell he dropped it.  Cas fidgets with it between Dean’s legs for a minute and then Dean feels it, the firm, relentless pressure of Cas’s erection against his opening.  Dean clenches his eyes shut and turns his face up to the ceiling as Cas starts to press in.  He doesn’t know what would be in his expression and he doesn’t want Cas to see him afraid, to think that they should stop.  A punched out gasp leaves him when Cas makes a small thrust, the ridge at the head of his dick snagging at his entrance when Cas stops moving.  It’s tight and hot and it stings like hell; it’s not exactly
“God. Damn. It. Cas!” he gasps out, jolting against each thrust.  “Now you’re mojo-ing my damn prostate?!  That is so cheating!”
Dean felt that stingy zip of nervousness as his friend laid down next to him; stupid, really, because the angel did it without comment or hesitation.  Cas simply unfolded his lean body next to Dean’s, transferring the trench coat from his lap to under his head, resting his slender arms on the ground next to him on either side.  Unable to resist a small smile – Cas somehow managed to make even
“I’m not hungry, Cas, but I would appreciate it if you would do a circle of the clearing and sweep for big-nasties, okay?”
"Such a heavy weight this world has forced on your shoulders, Dean, and you didn't deserve any of it. And yet, you continue to carry it without a word of protest."
Dean shoots up next to Cas and does a quick self-evaluation.  Cas trails a light skim of fingers from Dean’s thigh, around the curve of his ass, over his hip bone and heading towards his cock which, wonder of wonders, gives an interested twitch.  Cas leans forward and takes Dean’s bottom lip between his teeth momentarily and now Little Dean is way more than interested.
EDIT - Many thanks to my sister/beta, SkeptiKitten, for the origin of the phrase "pathetic, whining needy cockslut", which I just HAD to use.  Because reasons.
Dean just nodded and stayed silent.  A confused, pained expression still lingered around the corners of the hunter’s eyes and mouth, so Castiel fished for something that might cheer him up.
Benny smirked a bit against his annoyance.  “And I think we both know which of our kinds kills more humans.”
In a whir of motion, the vampire spun to face Dean, snarling as they tussled.  Dean managed to pin the bloodsucker against a tree, his arm braced across the taller man’s chest.  The vamp snarled and writhed against Dean’s grip, but he managed to keep the thing braced against the tree trunk.  Maybe the hunter wasn’t as tired as he thought.  A tiny smirk pulled at the corners mouth.
“Not if you want me to return the favor tomorrow night,” he quipped, laughing outright when Castiel hastened to comply.
The position Dean has to finagle to see Cas properly, pulling at his shoulder joints because of his hands still pinned over his head, is uncomfortable as hell but it’s worth the view.  “God damn,” Dean mutters in a rough half-whisper.
kind of guy.  Dean has to admit that he’s impressed that the guy manages to pull off the No Bullshit vibe with a dick in his mouth, but somehow the dude makes it work.
“Honestly, Cas,” Dean interrupted, “it would help just to have you near me and to have something to take my mind off it, okay?”
Before he could even register the brush of Castiel's nose against his, Dean felt the warm, damp pressure of the angel's lips against his own. His hand flew up to clasp Castiel's wrist in his grip, not pulling it away from him but clutching like a lifeline. And before Dean could barely acknowledge that the kiss had happened, it was over.
The expression on the angel’s face turned thunderous, and he stalked up to the hunter, eyes flashing with self-righteous anger.
Dean shook his head to clear it and took another few giant leaps into the forest.  This needed to stop.  This place was clearly starting to fuck with him.  He just … he just needed to take a few deep breaths, grit his teeth, and fuck back.  Or, in this case,
At that, Cas turns his face into Dean’s arm, weirdly sheepish, and clears his throat before speaking.
Dean follows his gaze to where it’s pinned on the hand Dean has resting next to his now-obvious erection.
When Cas moved to position himself this time, Dean didn’t fight but simply let his head tip back as he absorbed the sensation of the tight, hot slide of Cas’s body as he settled onto Dean’s erection.  Leaning back on his hands again, he let Cas drive their coupling, the angel slowly sliding along Dean’s length, kneading at the hunter’s shoulders and he moved up and down.  As Cas’s pace increased, Dean curled his arms around him, clutching at one shoulder and one flexing cheek and letting his mouth trail along the ridge of the angel’s collarbone.  Cas’s muscles strained as he quickened his pace, panting just above Dean’s face pressed to his chest.  The angel began to angle his hips as he rocked, chafing his own erect penis against Dean’s stomach and whimpering with every pleasurable tug of sensation.  When Dean wrapped one hand around Cas’s length and started a swift, tight stroke, the angel’s pace faltered and his nails dug into the thick muscle at Dean’s shoulders.  Dean brought his free hand up to drag his thumb across the angel’s bottom lip; the angel groaned and bit down on it.
Nudging Castiel's top leg forward until the angel had to prop himself up on a knee and elbow, Dean slowly slid the wet fingers between the rounds of Castiel's rear.  Castiel pressed his face into the worn leather jacket propping up his head, stifling a drawn-out gasp in the folds.  His limbs felt both watery with nerves and electrified with anticipation, his vessel barely able to send the proper messages to his brain for translation.  All he really knew was the word Dean repeated over and over again as the hunter gingerly breached Castiel's body with a single damp digit.
"Is that why you didn't zap down here?" he asked, turning to face his friend again. "Because you'll be a blip on Heaven radar?"
He’s petrified to say it but he leans his forehead against Cas’s cheek where he’s propped his chin on Dean’s shoulder; tries to tell himself that Cas won’t judge him, won’t hurt him.  That this is why Cas is here.
Dean watches, aroused beyond belief, as the Dean inside his head rears back and hastily yanks at the fly of his jeans.  Dream Cas flips onto his belly without a word, trying to push up to a kneeling position but the Fantasy Dean braces a strong forearm across the back of Cas’s shoulders, holding the angel down against the worn leather.  With a deft tug, Dean’s doppelganger pushes down his pants and boxers, letting his erection bob free in the cool air as he pulls the white dress shirt free from Cas’s dress pants.  Dean knows where this was going now and a little moan that ekes past his lips as he turns onto his stomach, his twitching erection pinned against the seat.  His blood pounds when he realizes that he’s in the very same position where the Cas in his head moans and writhes.  As the hunter in his head leans down to reach under the angel to slide down the zipper of his trousers, Dean brings an arm up under his face to stifle his helpless noises in the sleeve of his shirt.
Castiel shrugged, though Dean didn't see it. "Does that bother you, my knowing about your carnal relations?"
As the three of them rounded a small gap in a stand of trees to make sure it was easily defensible, Dean finally spoke up.  “So you really got ‘Biblical’ with that fundie chick you were married to, huh?”
His words heave an abrupt halt.  The brush of the tip of Cas’s nose against his shaft surprises him, not what he expected, but then the angel’s tongue darts out and flattens against the base of his cock and his breath shudders.  All Cas really does is turn his head, but it drags the flat of his tongue up the length of Dean’s erection slowly – god, fuck,
“Hey, uh, Cas, I wanted to ask you about something,” Dean started, wincing at how his voice hitched a bit.  “When we … when you and I have … look, I just want to make sure that you didn’t go along with it just because … I mean, you know that you don’t have to—aw, hell.”
The angel’s brow furrowed, unsure of how to answer that question, but he needn’t have bothered, as the elder Winchester steamed on, his hands gesturing sharply under Castiel’s nose with his Purgatory-made weapon.
One corner of Castiel's mouth quirked up in a tiny smile as he watched Dean pace the room opposite to Castiel, his fingers caressing an angel blade that had appeared strapped to his waist as the dream shifted to respond to Dean's anger. When he noticed it, Dean's face slipped into an expression of shock and the blade vanished. Realization melted over his features shortly after.
“I don’t care what you’re comfortable with,” Dean snarled to the vampire’s umpteenth only-slightly-veiled suggestion to leave Castiel behind.  “We agreed to—”
A strange jolt of energy zipped through Dean’s shoulder at that thought.  He rubbed at it, a bit absently, until he realized that the origin of the electric sense of awareness hummed through the handprint burned into his shoulder.  When Benny called back to him to say, “I don’t think he knows anything,” Dean just sneered.
“I never properly explained to you … When I brought you out of Hell, Dean, it was after a great deal of battle—”
When Cas eventually came down from the high of his climax, he realized that Dean still rocked up within him rhythmically, still hard and searching for his own climax.  Dean had let his eyes drop closed as he leaned his forehead against Cas’s chest, straining too hard to find a peak that danced out of his reach.
“I’m one of them, Cas,” he moaned into the leaves and leather beneath his head.  “I’ve become one of them.  A mindless monster.”
But Cas …. Cas had spent thousands of years being pure in the most literal possible sense of the word, and then when he’d eventually actually indulged in an act that Dean performed as routinely as brushing his teeth, it was with a devout
“Isn’t …?” Castiel prodded when Dean just alternated between gazing at his hands and gazing at the trees.
.  It was more than just him being a dude, or an angel … maybe because he was both of those things, and Dean just didn’t know what the fuck to do with that.  He couldn’t name it, he couldn’t control it, he couldn’t even fucking hold on to whatever the hell he was feeling, and he felt like if he let go with both hands  then whatever the fuck it was would pull him under.
Lastly, big thanks to my sister/beta skeptikitten for the origin of the irresistible phrase “look-down-check-out”.  One more chapter of plot with my baby SB Sam, and then …. Well, you’ll see 
“But last night you decided that flaunting your sexual fantasies to me inside your head wasn’t sufficient.
The rest of the daylight hours Castiel spent his time at an easy arm’s reach behind Dean’s left side, watching his friend carefully as the hunter stalked through the forest, his dominant hand clutching the handle of his weapon so tightly that the man’s knuckles whitened.  Benny remained uncharacteristically silent as well, regarding Dean with a steady gaze that held what Castiel thought might be just the tiniest touch of pity.  The burly vampire departed without a word when darkness descended upon the night’s makeshift camp site, casting the angel a potent look over his shoulder as he disappeared into the brush to make his rounds.
“Up,” he says, rocking forward to unseat the younger man.  “You need to get up.  This ain’t a lap dance anymore and this sure as hell isn’t the place for what you were trying to do just now.  I don’t want to get thrown out or get you fired.”
“Something unsettling is moving out in the trees tonight,” Cas said, never taking his sharp, darting eyes off of the shadow-laden trees being swallowed by darkness.  “Something more than just your blood-sucking friend.”
"And that kink you mentioned earlier."  Sam blushes and glances up to catch Dean's eye; he smirks back at the kid.  "Yeah, that kink is 100% real, but it's not because you just happen to like older tough guys, is it?  It's because you've probably seen some shit, haven't you?  And you don't have time for kids your age because they're boring, immature, angsty little assholes and you want someone who knows what they're doing.  Especially in the sack.  Which tells me that you've actually
“Dean.”  Cas’s voice sounds soft and the touch of his fingers on Dean’s cheek are just as gentle.  “Dean, look at me.”
This time Dean lets out some of his embarrassment and rubs at the back of his neck, dropping his gaze back to the table.  “Jesus, it sounds like I really am sticking out—”
The fifth time it happens everything becomes clear to Dean, which is good because while he is technically the right age for a mid-life and/or sexuality crisis, it’s just fucking exhausting and Dean doesn’t really have time for that shit.  In any case, by the end of the night, he’s way more scared but a hell of a lot less confused and for now that’s something he can live with.
Another finger inside and a few hard strokes push him over the edge, all three syllables of Cas’s full name coating his lips as he falls.  Dean shatters when he comes, and he’s almost certain he passes out for at least a few minutes because when he becomes aware of himself again, the puddle of come on his stomach is mostly cold and the clock reads 3:02 AM.  Well, Sam wasn’t wrong, it turns out.  He got off at 3:00, too.
“I believe I cared for her in whatever way I was capable at the time.  She is a good person who, I believe, loved me.  Or, at the very least, the man she believed me to be.”
Before the gender of his partner of choice had ever been called into question, the issue of whether or not to have sex hadn’t been so damn difficult.  The answer was almost always “yes” and Dean couldn’t remember ever having to be so worried about the consequences, because to Dean, “sex” and “consequences” used to just mean “wear a condom” and “don’t slobber during foreplay”.  Even when he’d been with Cassie or Lisa, when the relationship itself had been complicated, the issue of sex never had been.
of death: he is an archangel who administers death to the human by judging them with a sword placed over his/her head and placing a drop of gall on their tongue which causes death.  In corresponding Roman Catholic lore, Samael is seen as the negative/Hell-bound counterpart to the archangel Michael, who not only leads the armies of the Heavenly Host but ferries worthy souls to Heaven.  As such, given that Supernatural canon lore has Michael established as the ultimate leader of the Host and the chosen warrior of the End of Days, I felt it appropriate that Samael, his Talmudic/Biblical counterpart, would be his number two in the chain of command and the leader of Castiel’s garrison chosen to wage war on Hell and raise Dean.  It’s a little detail, I realize, but half of what I loved about SPN was these little gems of “real” lore.  If you ever want a huge, gabbling fangirl lecture from me, ask me about Castiel’s origins from the lore surrounding the archangel Cassiel.  ^_^
"Put it in your mouth..." whispered Castiel, being a tad impatient. He saw Dean hesitate a moment, so he pulled him towards his arousal. With no other choice, the man grabbed Castiel's swollen erection in his filigree hands, then shook it. A moan escaped Castiel's lips, which could only encourage the man who was kneeling to continue. "Yes, baby... Just like that..."
"I didn't have any doubts. Of course it had to be great. After all, it was the will of the gods. I was going to save you, and you were going to fuck me. After all, it was obvious. The signals were obvious."
"That's good" he replied with a huge smile on his face. Dean ran his free hand through the man's hair. His fingers made contact with those dark strands and did a wonderful job of pushing them back. He saw Castiel close his eyes and sigh. It was obvious that he was enjoying this. "We shouldn't focus on negative, sad thoughts. We are having a wonderful, warm day. I think we could use it somehow..."
Castiel remained very still and waited for Dean’s reply. He hoped his friend would understand the subtle meaning behind his words. He did not hold out much hope. Castiel knew that in order to protect himself against being hurt, Dean relied on being deliberately obtuse. Castiel thought it was amazing how the famed hunter could face down the most evil and dangerous monster without blinking, but when it came to facing what he felt inside, the man was a coward. This is what made it so hard for Castiel. As a being of celestial intent and not to mention guardian angel to Dean. He already knew what desires Dean held towards him, and right now at this moment of shared intimacy. It took everything he had within himself not to use what little of his grace he had at the moment to nudge the man to open up. But it was not how he wanted things to be between them. He needed Dean to open up on his own and share his innermost desire with Castiel. So he waited, and could only dream these last few days spent together watching Netflix on the couch together or listening to music on Dean’s bed would finally give the man courage to do so. At least that is what he had hoped, and he had hoped the admission of his own feelings would be the final push that would give Dean courage to be honest and give Castiel what he wished for most. And based on the thoughts swirling through Dean’s head, Castiel felt he was going to finally have what he wished for...that is until the younger Winchester burst through the door and brought everything to a disappointing halt. Castiel, with a calmness that he did not feel inside, opened his eyes in time to watch Dean as he tried to distance himself from Cas, embarrassment written clearly on his panicked face. Then to the angel’s astonishment, he watched Dean disappeared from sight as he fell off the bed.
"Well, God, He knows this too, Dean. So, I am hoping to convince our Father that he does not need to send him out to the Empty and I am going to do that by bringing him a promise from you and your brother that you will not come after him. Where ever he ends up."
"It's okay, Dean. I understand." Castiel turned to look out the dark window but could only see the droplets of moisture that had collected on the window. He knew if he wanted to, he could see every molecule that made up those droplets but he didn't because he knew the fascination and beauty of the droplets came from the light that refracted within them. Feeling the car beginning to slow as it was readying to turn onto the old dirt road that led to the cemetery. He continued to make his requests.
"Yes, Castiel. Father has returned to heaven after his little reunion with his sister and I can tell you. Though he looked rested. He was still all about the wrath and the fury and Brother! When he saw what had been done in his absence. That wrath was in full bloom with plenty of fury to go with it." Blowing out a gust of air, Barachiel rolled his eyes and shook his head as if he were replaying the events in his head "Castiel, just be thankful you were here and not there."
"You and Castiel, Dean. You both travel similar paths of righteousness in order to protect those you love. Each of you willing to sacrifice your self for the ones you love most. Because of a mistaken belief that you deserve to be sacrificed."
"Dean, I need you to find it within yourself." having difficulty finding the right words to make this mortal understand. Barachiel changed tactics to be more direct and to the point. So that there would be no misunderstanding. "I need you to promise me Dean Winchester, that you will truly let him go" Barachiel waited before continuing to see if he understood.
Dean hesitated and then replied weakly, a break in his voice "I promise, I won't stop but can I ask you something, Cas?"
. Then, just as quickly as the image entered his thoughts, he tried to push the image from his thoughts because his position on the bed made him Molly Ringwald and Castiel...Jake. And he still wasn’t quite ready to admit to himself how cool that would be.
Sam turned back towards the portal he had just walked through and unseen by his brother rolled his eyes at Dean's sad attempt at being clever. "You know it never gets funnier the more you say it" in response to his criticism Sam heard the sound of metal hitting tile and realized Dean, like a vampire on the scent of blood, had just opened the toaster oven door and had found the pie. Taking the empty chair opposite from the one his brother previously occupied, Sam pulled the closest ancient scroll towards him and began to study the old writings.
Barachiel felt no anger as he listened patiently to the mortal as he focused all of his frustration and anger on him. If he felt anything at all, it was admiration and respect. Before coming down to visit with Castiel, God had told him about the Winchester brothers and more specifically about Dean. Dean was uncommonly loyal to any he considered friend or family, anyone that he had come to care about instantly came under Dean Winchester's protection and because of his complex relationship with Castiel.  Barachiel understood that Dean Winchester's threat of taking on Heaven for Castiel's life was unlikely to be successful and most likely end badly for Dean. He knew Dean wouldn't care about the risks to himself and would try to save Castiel anyway.
Holding it up for a closer examination he now noticed there was a thin filament of black that ran down each ridge that made up the feathers in the wings and just like the old mercury thermometer. The filament would refract and expand changing the interior of the glass from clear to solid black when tilted at just the right angle.. Smiling to himself, Dean put the sculpture into his basket carefully and continued back towards the beer cooler to grab a six pack.
Shifting position to stand on the opposite side of Dean and the meat suit in his lap.  Crowley could clearly see the grief on Dean Winchester's face and he was surprised at how that look affected him. Deciding the fault lay with the human blood he thought he had broken free of, Crowley decided he could not bring himself to torment the man before him and taking a more conciliatory tone. He explained the real reason for his visit "I am only here to pay my respects for your loss."
Castiel returned his focus back on Sam and the old parchment he was now holding out in his direction looking at him expectantly.
"You will say good bye and you will return and answer for what you did in heaven...the slaughter of our brothers and sisters, here on earth...the innocents. The Leviathan. All while you were calling yourself the New God...a false God." Barachiel's statement caught Castiel off guard. Internally, his panic was replaced by guilt as the charges were given back to him. Externally though, he remained a soldier.
As Cas finished, Dean needed to sit up and so in one swift move. Dean pushed himself upwards and folded his legs so that he could mirror Castiel and sit pretzel-legged across from the angel and he leaned forward. And for the briefest of moments,  Dean thought of the final scene from the movie
Barachiel dropped Dean off at his Impala, the hunter was a little taken aback at being returned to normal time as the night was still all around them. Albeit, the sky did look a little lighter in the east. Looking at the Archangel with a questioning gaze, he was advised that only an hour had passed since they departed and that was because Barachiel wanted to make sure there was no real lost time for him to spend with Castiel and then with a quick nod he was gone.
Originally, he had arrived a short time after Sam had arrived and though he hated doing it he kept his arrival hidden. He had sensed that he should wait before intruding as he had picked up the tense emotion coming from the black classic car. This was a private moment between them both and his intention had been to disappear as quickly as he had arrived. But when he overheard Sam's remarks regarding Deans feelings. Castiel found himself glued in place. Unable to make himself withdraw and leave them to their privacy and with some guilt he stayed to listen.
Dean felt as if his world had just been upended and he had been punched in the stomach all at the same time. His mind began to race
As Cas turned to approach Dean, his eyes came up to naturally lock into Dean's. Dean felt his throat go dry as his mouth formed the words and he heard himself say “Yes, Cas! Yes. Do it now” Confident that the angel he loved would understand.  And he did.
"Well, the first thing he did was bring all of the plotters of the Apocalypse together and doled out his particular kind of justice to each one." Looking down at his empty glass Barachiel wanted a distraction before he continued "Could we get another?"
Heading down the hallway, Sam stared down the open web page scanning for any missed detail in the news article about the oil rig out in the Gulf. One small detail caught his eye that he had missed earlier causing his brow to furrow. He paused to stare intently then with a small return of his smile he continue his with his mission to find his brother and Cas.
"They bound Death?" Barachiel said with some incredulity his own tone changing from anger to some relief when he heard the change in Castiel's voice "Wow, that took some real chutzpah." Castiel gave a brief smile in agreement.
"Cas?" with Sam's absence, Dean called out to his friend determined to find out why he seemed so distracted.
"Your turn?" Dean said angrily "You didn't do anything other than try to protect heaven...and earth from those dicks." Knees now weak because of the Cas' news, Dean walked quickly over to the empty chair opposite from where Castiel stood and sat down. Leaning forward putting his elbows on his knees. He continued "You can't be held responsible for what your brothers did. You..."
Feeling a shift in the seat next to him Dean opened his eyes and found Castiel had moved closer and his blue eyes were now only inches from his own. Dean paused for just a moment studying the face across from his then, having decided he was unwilling to waste another moment. He pushed himself forward and pressed his lips against the soft lips of Castiel's vessel. And at first it had been soft kiss, but then as an unspoken sense of urgency began to flow between them. Hesitancy was quickly replaced by an inflamed hunger that fueled exploring tongue's and hands.
Alone in the main living area Dean looked up once more at the painting that Castiel had been staring at and realized he was wrong about what he saw in the fallen angel's eyes, for it wasn't anger or shame but the look of fear, the look of someone afraid of being alone.
"No. You are fine but your body would explode if I were to try and take it over fully as a vessel. So, I am only partially sharing my Grace with you. The rest of my grace is circling us...as protection." and even though I am...gone. You can see me as I was, in here as we talk.:
Castiel wrinkled his brow and shook his head as he said "Well, it is mostly about controlling them. Something towards the end that indicates it could be used to call for some creatures as well."
Unfolding himself from the passenger compartment and standing up, Castiel began to walk across the muddy road towards the spot where Sam had regained control of his body and forced Lucifer and an unwilling Michael down into the pit.
Softly but with desperation in his voice Dean answered his brother "Sam. God is going to put Cas on trial and if he is found guilty or whatever God wants to call it. He is going to be locked a way. Possibly in a cage  with Lucifer close by... back in Purgatory or even..." Dean stopped and swallowed hard. Choking back his frustration and with a last urgent glance at the table and its contents, Dean looked up at his younger brother with what Sam could only describe as sadness mixed with dread.
Coming up and around a cherry red Bel Air Coupe, Sam saw the front end of the Impala and walked towards it. He could not see Dean as he approached which did not concern him much because he knew Dean was probably sprawled out on one of the seats, beer in hand and just listening to the music as it hammered through the speakers.
Never written a sex scene. Let alone, a gay sex scene. So if it is awkward or seems not quite right. I apologize.
“So just close your eyes and listen to the music and see if you can pick up the different sections of the song. Oh, and let the intro just flow through you and afterwards I want you to compare it to the song Kashmir’s opening. I want to know which you like better.” and with that he pressed the play button and instead of rolling back to his previous position up against the headboard. Dean crooked his arm up so his hand propped his head and the pillow was now wedge as support in the triangle that was created.
Sam for his part looked over at Cas and saw the way he was looking at his brother and felt bad for the guy. Sam gave a little shake of his head and answered his brother. “Three guys from an oil rig down in the Gulf of Mexico went missing.”
Sam was almost finished putting the last of the groceries into the refrigerator when he came to the bag with the cherry pie. Taking a quick sideways glance at his brother he quickly grabbed the small handle of the toaster oven and in one swift move pulled it open and slid the pie inside. Sam considered as a small payback for his brother's lack of appreciation. He had little hope that it would provide enough cover from his brother and that it would last more than a day or two. Grabbing a couple of beers from the fridge and heading back into the map room Sam made his way over to the large work table occupying a most of the room calling back in reply "Well, for one thing. Those lines Dean, are called runes!"
"No Dean, he would not. I can guarantee that Castiel, will not live that life or exist anywhere that you and your brother may encounter him. Besides, I suspect if this were to occur. Then the the vessel he is in would be kept in Heaven and he would be given another. There is no doubt it is special." at Dean's questioning gaze he added "No vessel, Dean. Has lasted as long as this one has. There is something different with it so. We would, I suspect, would keep it with us to study and that is a big if as far as the idea that Father would merely take his Grace and let him die a mortal, but I suspect Castiel would be given a different vessel to live in."
He looked closely at the figure of the Angel with unfurled White wings and a sword wrapped in golden ribbons of fire around its blade. Dean would know the profile of the ascending angel anywhere...it was Castiel. Dean smiled and could only shake his head as he read the full title to himself. "The Winchester Gospel: the Ascension of the Archangel Castiel, by Carver Edlund" opening the book Dean read the dedication:
Sam watched the exchange between his brother and Castiel, he too had picked up on the weird vibe coming from Castiel just as his brother had. Sam raised his eyebrow and with a quick glance at Castiel and deciding that maybe his brother who could get always get Cas to talk about whatever happened to be on his mind. Decided to make an excuse to be elsewhere. So that Dean could use that profound bond that Castiel felt they had to get whatever was bugging him out into the open. Standing up with a sigh Sam gathered the documents and called out to Dean "Well, I am going to see if I can find something in the archives on creatures that reside in Hades and this Orphne. See if I can come up with a list of possibilities"
Back in the Impala, Dean reached behind and took the book from his pocket and began to examine the front cover. Then, slowly, a smile began to spread across his face and tears began to fill his eyes as Dean let out a soft prayer and then unable to help himself Dean ran his fingers over the book's soft cover and studied it intently and as he read the name of the author Carver Edlund.
Breaking eye contact, Castiel turned back to look up at the painting again and began to speak in a soft voice. Forcing Dean to move in closer to hear what was being said by the angel.
Dean took a deep breath placed his hand on the rail and looked up the small flight of stairs that would lead them back up to the main living area of the Bunker. He didn't want to climb them. His every instinct wanted to turn around and grab Cas and drag him to the Impala and drive away from here...from the Bunker. He knew places, places that he was sure no angel could find the two of them. The urge to fight Barachiel and prevent him from taking this new found love from him was beginning to overwhelm his thoughts.
