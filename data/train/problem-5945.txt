“You’re right though, walls are bad for a relationship. I’m grateful that you like my cheesy nature. It gets worse at Christmas so we’ll soon see if the novelty wears off for you,” Steve joked trying to rid himself of the insecurity that he would be too much for Tony. “Nice to know you plan on keeping me now, I must have reversed that awful impression I made of myself. Are you glad you gave me a chance?”
“Thank you, Master,” he said sincerely again at the praise.  Then Tony took the shampoo and washed Steve’s hair just as carefully as he had washed his, making sure every strand and every inch of scalp got attention as he worked it in and rinsed it out.  Then he massaged in some very expensive conditioner before moving onto the soap.  He got down on his knees to start with his feet and move his way up, using his hands rather than a cloth and getting between each toe, around each nail, and carefully up and into every crevice.
At that point Steve made his way into the living room.  He saw Natasha stroking Tony’s hair and seethed.  “Nat he’s not yours to caress like a pet,” he snapped.  “Tony can we go to yours?” he asked plainly.  Nat moved her hand away, although she guessed he’d just lashed out at her because he and Bucky had argued.  She looked at him with quiet anger before standing up.  “It was lovely to meet you, Tony,” she beamed falsely.  She was keeping up appearances, but she was good at that.
“I love the feel of you,” he whispered, moving forwards so their lips were close to one another’s. “I think my new favorite thing is to have you between my hands,” palms skimming forward to knead over the blades of Tony’s hips, Steve used his hands to roll over the shape and dimensions of Tony’s form. He was smoothing, caressing, worshipping every inch of skin he could find. This was their form of sex and he was making sure it was taken as seriously as sexually pleasing a partner.
At Tony’s protest Steve winced, “I see it baby, don’t worry.  You’re safe with me, remember.” Steve slowed the car as they waited in the red light before turning off onto the freeway.
"But that answer really wasn’t an answer at all, so that’s not. Your feelings are just as important as mine, Steve, and I deserve to know when I’m upsetting you. I don’t like talking about any of this either, but I feel like you deserve to know, and whether you want to talk about why something upsets you or not doesn’t take away from my need to at least know that it does. And ‘I don’t get upset the way you seem to’? I really really don’t want to fight with you, but that’s bullshit. Everybody gets upset and burying it doesn’t help.”
“I won’t get drunk on you, I promise.” He considered for a second, then finished his glass in a couple of burning gulps and left it at the bar. The last thing he wanted was to make Steve uncomfortable. “I’m sorry. That I can’t just not drink. I don’t want to make any of this harder for you.” He sat back down on the couch and leaned into him. “Do you need me to go drink something else? Brush my teeth? To get rid of the taste in my mouth? I can do that. If it helps, even when I do get drunk, I’m a giggly and clingy drunk–not an angry one. I mentioned that earlier, I think, but.”
“I…” Yeah, he wasn’t going to touch the getting help thing. He should, but he really just wasn’t strong enough right now. He knew he wasn’t committed. But the question Steve had asked was easier, so he jumped back to that. “Yeah, I am. Asexual. That’s not a problem? Me not being attracted to you?” He’d come out publicly a couple years previously, but after a couple weeks of the media making fun of him for it and calling him a liar and an attention whore, it had stopped being interesting, and no one had really remembered.
“My favorite cuddle position? Oh wow, I’m really being treated.” He joked, nudging Tony’s cheek with his nose before kissing it affectionately.
“Yeah. They were great parents. I always felt so bad for them that they couldn’t have kids of their own, but I was also a little selfish and grateful, y'know? Sometimes, when my parents were gone, she’d call me her son. A fiam. I know more about their lives than my parents’. I could never even get my mom to talk about her family.”
Steve stirred at the unfamiliar alarm tone. It didn’t sound like his regular alarm. That’s when he realized it was, in fact, the voice of Tony’s sentient invention rather than an alarm. His eyes fluttered open. “Too early,” he croaked, his hands coming up to wipe the sleep from his eyelashes. The warm bubble they had created between the sheets beckoned him. “Don’t make us get up Tony. Cuddles are needed. S'warm,” he mumbled tucking his arms around Tony’s waist, not hesitating to make Tony little spoon. “No leavin’ me.” He hummed lightly as he nuzzled the back of Tony’s neck. The natural scent of Tony’s skin was amazing--genuinely beautiful. He could get lost in it. The soft coconut scent of his shampooed hair was like a lullaby that had Steve lightly dozing again.
“This is the reference picture I’m using for the portrait. I’m doing it properly old style - think Victorian Britain style portrait of a stuffy rich white dude, gonna make this detailed frame for it. Make a commentary about framing machinery as humanized whilst I’m at it. Because really I love him like I’d love a pet and you do too right?”
Tony really really really didn’t deserve this guy. But when he left, it almost felt like his heart had decided to leap out of his chest and follow. Tony stayed there, leaning against the wall, trying desperately to talk himself out of this. He could just let it go and it would be better for everyone.
“I like Italian meals, black coffee and if we’re going to the cinema; it’s sci-fi. You know, in case you wanted to retcon this meeting and try again,” he winked at Tony before finally turning away. It was his form of wishing Tony well but leaving it on a positive and playfully light note.
“I prefer Master,” he whispered.  “That is your special name for me,” Steve informed him.  “Say it,” he encouraged, nudging the side of Tony’s face with his nose.  “I want to hear it in your beautiful voice.”
When he came back out, he was wearing pale pink lace panties and a white chiffon robe with a pair of stockings and a garter belt he’d had to dig out of the very bottom of the drawer. “Like what you’re seeing, édesem?”
He didn’t run late, mostly because he was too focused on that night to get distracted by the fun kids’ science that could normally draw him in. So he showed up at Steve’s place right at six, driving one of his flashier sports cars and wearing a gorgeous and expensive dark suit. He might’ve been a mess earlier, but everything about him looked smooth and put-together now, including the bouquet of roses he’d tucked under one arm so he could knock.
He didn’t find sex boring. He found masturbating boring. “If that’s why you’re asking, then you’re asking the wrong questions. It’s boring because I’m alone and there’s no real goal. I’d be much more interested if it was accomplishing something for you. I actively like to be a part of things. Watching you get what you want? That’s great. Very interesting. But no, I don’t want to watch you with someone else. You by yourself putting on a show for me? I think I’d like that. Not all of the time, but if I was in the mood.” He maintained eye contact for another long second, then looked away when the waitress came, ordering coffee and blueberry pancakes for himself, then letting Steve order.
“No! No team ups!” He did squirm and giggle and he batted Steve’s hands away from the sensitive spots.
“That will be all, Miss Potts.”
Steve laughed at Tony’s disgust in his choice of language. “Why don’t we do all of them.” Steve smirked. “That’s if you want me to stay late?” There was a shy smile on his lips. He nuzzled along Tony’s cheekbone. “‘We’ll move when you’ve had a little rest,” Steve moved his hand to pet Tony’s hair, inhaling deeply, taking in the soft scent of Tony’s shampoo, cologne and laundry soap. He hung on tightly to Tony, keeping him close.
Steve smiled, “Okay - who was your first guy crush and why?” Steve asked, hoping that was more entertaining for Tony to answer. “I’ll show you some when I take you to the studio, it’s basically the basement of my house. It’s pretty cool.” He continued to pet Tony’s hair, the soothing moments still working against his back. It was relaxing to just stop and take a moment to admire the colors of the sky and feel a connection to another human being.
Steve turned to look at Tony, properly look at him. He quickly assessed the situation to the best of his ability. “My last name is Rogers. My full name is Steven Grant Rogers. Let’s go to the backseat so I can give you a cuddle. We’ll call it time on the personal questions for now.” He smiled encouragingly over at Tony, “I’m not giving up on you tonight or any other night. I’m not asking you to trust that just yet though,” he unbuckled his belt, abandoning the food, fixated more on the fact that Tony needed him in that moment. Opening the passenger car door he moved to switch places, getting into the back seat, opening his arms.
Things are emotional--these boys are really going too fast, but Steve gets protective, their needs clash some more, and oof. You'll see. Heads-up for a misunderstanding during scene featuring safewording and a lack of immediate aftercare.
“Do you sing?”
“Honestly, you’re doing fab trusting me in the drivers seat,” he assured softly.  Steve could sense Tony becoming more at ease with his driving and he was genuinely impressed with how fearless Tony was getting in these situations that lay outside of his comfort zone.  One remarkable person was sat next to him, and Steve couldn’t help but deeply admire him for still having his fire.
“In that case, I’m your baby now. Don’t call anyone else that. My pet name. I’m calling it.” Tony slid his arms around Steve’s waist again, under his shirt this time, and kissed his chest before tilting his head back to steal a better kiss. “‘Kay, I’m gonna go wash my face and then we can go. I know a really wonderful diner with great pancakes–you’re gonna love it.”
“Ana and Edwin Jarvis. I named my baby after them.” He figured Steve at least deserved to know their names. Especially since calling them the butler and his wife was incredibly weird. “If you mean someone like a therapist, I have. But it didn’t really help much. And I was working through bigger issues than my neglectful parents at the time. And I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to treat you like a therapist just now.”
Steve hummed softly, “that sounds very hard on you,” came the soft reply. “Have you ever really talked to anyone about your childhood? It sounds like there is a lot of grief that you have for the relationship you didn’t have with your biological parents.” Steve carded his fingers through Tony’s hair.
Natasha laughed.  “We’re not going to judge you or anything,” she assured.  She moved Tony into the living room and sat with him on the sofa, playing the diversion tactic to leave Bucky and Steve to butt heads.
“I’m not going to be able to share passions with you for a while. I want you to know that. It’s… There’s history for that, but I just can’t. It’ll take time.” He reached over to squeeze his hand again at a red light. “I like someone who’s willing to wait, but also takes the initiative. I like competence. A lot. And I like someone to be bigger than me and kind of soft. Not a requirement, but cuddling is nice that way.” He shot him a little smile, since they’d already discovered how well Steve dwarfed him in a hug. “And I like having attention completely on me when we’re together. Cute accents don’t hurt. Do you like being in control? Taking control? Don’t try to hedge around or lie about this one. I know it’s approaching kink territory, but I just want to know.”
sexuality he was getting wound up about. He calmed himself down, centering himself, and he turned to Tony as he parked.
“If you have anything vintage classic I may actually have orgasm.” He laughed not really thinking about his choice of words before going bright red. “Uhm? I should probably find a way to express happiness that doesn’t equate with arousal really, shouldn’t I?”
The simple electricity that ran through his skin as Tony tentatively took Steve’s hand on the journey back to Tony’s had him light-headed. Who knew that such a small action could make him feel so elated. As they pulled into the garage, Steve was starstruck by all the gorgeous cars. However, Tony soon commanded his attention. At the request Steve nodded dumbly, “Please?” Came the whispered soft reply, Steve’s eyes falling to observe the cherry pink dusting and fullness of Tony’s lips.
"Oh?" Tony asked.  And there the change was again, except this time it was more open.  Relaxed, almost.  "So what causes the Great Captain America to
Steve nodded, stubbornly wrapping around Tony as he tried to leave again.
"Hm," Bruce said, fiddling with the tablet again and looking down at it.
"He is aware of this and wishes to repeat the request."
"And how do I know it's not another dream?" Tony asked, anger slipping into his voice.  "And don't tell me to flip a coin."
," Steve repeated.
"Steve..."  This was a dream.  It had to be a dream.  The bond wasn't as strong like before, but he could still sense Steve's feelings.
Stark sat in one of the chairs and leaned back.  "And what makes you so sure of that?"
"Let him go, Schmidt," Steve said.  There was steel in his voice, but also a note of fear that Tony hadn't heard very often.  Dreams.  They were nice.  Tony closed his eyes, savoring the sound one last time.
"It's not fine," Steve said, looking at Tony with too-earnest eyes.  Tony put down the tablet and placed a hand over Steve's fisted one, rubbing small circles into it to relax him.  Finally, Steve slumped forward, surprising Tony by resting his forehead against Tony's shoulder.  It hurt a little, but Steve wasn't pressing on any of the burns.  "None of this is coming out right.  I had a plan for what I was gonna say, but it's all jumbled now."
‘Oh, is that true, mon capitain?’
“I'm not stupid enough to expect you to follow orders. I know you don’t know how to do that.”
‘What brings you here at this hour? Is it… how do you call it in America…? Ah, a booty call!’
That was the job of the lucky guy who had now replaced the pretty one. He had an even bigger dick, so big he had to take his time pushing into Steve. Did Steve like that? The burning stretching sensation? Did he enjoy the smell of somebody’s crotch against his nose? The hands pressing down on his hips? Or the way the restraints stretched his shoulders to their limits?
“Done. Now go rest. We need everybody in top shape if we’re going to rescue Stark.”
“We all know that you will, so I’ll keep the med bay ready.”
Steve hunched. He knew they were very close friends, but why did he want to monopolize Tony’s time like that? Steve had assigned them teams for a reason… Efficiency. Yes. That was the reason.
“Why are you always such a buzzkill?”
The final approach took less than twenty minutes. They were lucky their pilot was Rhodes — he knew how to navigate tight spaces without betraying any nervousness. It helped calm the rest of them down, even if Tony was apparently already immune to it and was busy bouncing all over the ship. So Steve was thankful when they finally docked and they were able to get out of the ship.
“Is… that… is that from the Star Trek thing?”
“And you didn’t tell us because…?”
“What, and you’ll survive?”
“Always so competent. While you got us useless intel, I got us the admiration of the lead mechanic and a million credits. I have no idea how much they’re worth. They’re probably scamming me.”
But Steve knew that was a lie. He dashed towards Tony but before he got there, an explosion rocked the sewers with such force that Steve was thrown back against a wall. He fell face-first into the water. Water flooded his mouth and stung his eyes. He couldn’t breathe. No air was reaching his lungs and he was weak and useless again and. And.
Steve shrugged and wondered what the 60s had been like. Tony hadn't been born yet if he remembered right. “It’s the only name I have.”
“We’re trusting them?” Bruce said.
‘Sure. Whatever you want, Tony.’
“Too late, Romanoff! We’ve won!” one of the SHIELD agents screamed, climbing on top of some boxes and triumphantly showing the device.
The other man left last. He was writing down something on a notebook. Notes on training, probably — promising recruits, changes to the training regime... He was so into it that he almost crashed against Steve. “Oh,” the other man said when he realized who Steve was. He took a step back. “Came here to…?”
Tony’s eyes narrowed as he sat on his chair. “Wait, you’ve been… You know? You were SHIELD. Were you involved?”
While they handled the baggage, Tony, Rhodes, and Bruce started to prepare the ship. It wouldn’t be long before they left — so Steve had very little time to convince somebody to stop the take-off. It was the best for the crew and Steve had to protect them from their own recklessness. Tony was a dead-end and too hell-bent on the journey, so it would have to be somebody reasonable and with influence over Tony. There was only one possible answer.
He blushed. He was that obvious, wasn’t he?
“So Stevens won’t make us run anymore. That’s a net positive.”
A few minutes later, Bruce burst into the ship again. He frowned when he saw them. “Wait, did you start the meeting already? I thought you’d wait for me.”
“They’re not usually that well-kept.”
‘In this case…’
“Oh, no, we’re just trying to figure out how it works.”
Bait. Tony was offering himself up as bait.
Steve narrowed his eyes. What were they talking about? He hadn't… he hadn't noticed that.
“Stevens, don’t stand there!” Tony said, pointing at a passage so thin he had to get into it sideways. Right. They were sitting ducks, out in the open like that. Steve followed. On the other side of the passage, there was a side alley, one of the many dark twists in the tangled web that was the station.
Tony peeked at Steve from under his blanket. Steve tried not to notice the way his eyelashes framed his dark brown eyes and failed miserably.
There was enough work for most of them, even if they hadn’t gotten to their destination yet. Bruce and Tony spent their days tinkering and monitoring the engines, Rhodes updated the star charts, Nat and Steve developed their training program, Clint cooked, Laura was busy arranging the cargo bay to her liking.
“You’re sore losers,” Clint replied, jotting down another point in the tally taped to the wall.
“Totally cheating.”
Each ‘wing’ of the plane housed two small rooms and a slightly larger one. Picking the rooms was a quick affair — the Bartons took one of the big ones and Tony took the other, citing ‘boss privilege’. Steve picked the one in front of Tony’s rooms. His hearing was too good and he didn’t want to risk hearing the Bartons’… private activities. He had always been very easy to fluster.
“Hi.”
No. That couldn’t be happening. He knew that tone of voice. He had heard it so many times, during the war. He couldn’t let it happen. He frowned.
“Wait. Is… is Tony Stark going to be there too? On the ship?”
“Nat? You had orders!”
Nat took a sip of her coffee. In the stillness of the ship, Steve waited for her next words. “I was… recruited, by Steve Rogers himself. The shining future of SHIELD, the next generation, ready to take the helm.”
Steve stopped and pretended to hunch over to catch his breath. “Good luck.”
“I think it’s a good idea, for what’s it’s worth.”
“Isn’t that Hank Pym?”
“For undermining me in front of the man who decides if we get money or not? Apology accepted.”
‘You liked that, didn’t you?’ the man said and then Tony heard another slap and Steve whined. Tony hadn’t known Steve could whine like that.
So he kicked off his shoes and climbed on top of the bed. The laptop crashed down to the floor. It didn’t matter — it was a piece of shit anyway. What mattered was the lube on his nightstand (a man had to be prepared). When he yanked the drawer open, it crashed on the floor. Tony leaned down the side of the bed and grabbed the small bottle.
Steve didn’t know if that had been a test, but he did know he had definitely failed it.
Tony rolled his eyes. “Fine, then Sarge here will move into my room.” They all stared at him. Steve shared their surprise. “What? It’s larger. And I don’t snore.”
Tony made a sound that made it clear that he was picturing the exact sort of battle Clint was.
She laughed. “Good to know. I’ll take the night shift tonight.”
He wasn’t sure if he could trust his own judgment.
When had he gotten that close? Steve’s heart beat faster and his mouth went dry.
you want to fuck the tentacles. I get it. I wouldn’t turn down a good set of tentacles myself.”
So was Steve.
“Okay, tell me, where are your parents?”
At least three of the guys had stopped to stare at Steve’s body, licking their lips and whistling. Steve had stuck out his ass then, like some sort of depraved invitation. That was when Tony, knowing he had to get away from Steve, had shuffled to a dark corner. He was a spectator and now the naked protagonists were hard at work.
Steve was thankful for the lulls of normal travel between jumps, where the ship lazily slid through space, as if they didn’t have a time limit to get to their destination. It gave them a few weeks of peace where they could properly assign tasks and shifts. Time enough that the rec room started looking lived in — books thrown around, board games that started to lose pieces, old coffee cups left to rot. Arguments grew in the garden of routine, the kind of arguments you had with people you knew — Laura’s concern about how Tony would ruin all the books by leaving them open, Strange’s inflexible rules about how they had to shower, Clint and Bruce’s endless war over the thermostat.
“You know what I mean. We’re in an active warzone and in hostile, unknown territory. We can’t keep acting as if this were a holiday. You need to take this seriously.”
“And anyway, we have no choice,” Nat added as sat down next to him. “We can’t do this alone.”
The guy fucking himself on Steve’s cock leaned forward and came all over Steve’s chest. Tony closed his eyes again.
“See? I told you I knew where I was going. Now, all we have left to do is move this boulder.”
There was no reason to pay them any further attention. Steve was the priority. He crossed the room with a few strides and fell to his knees next to Steve. When he did, Steve looked up at him, hazily. At least he didn’t look upset. With all the tenderness he kept hidden, Tony unhooked the spider gag and cleaned Steve’s red cheeks with his t-shirt.
He shrugged, but Clint wasn’t buying his chill act. There was a glint in his eyes Tony didn’t like one bit, but Steve stole his thunder.
"What? I can see the wedding ring in your hand."
“Hey, Stevens!”
“Well, I remember you being as happy as I was that Sulu had gotten his own command!”
“No. I'll sit down when I want to. Explain, now.”
She nodded.
“They saved us, so yes.”
If planets align, this will get a monthly update but I make no promises.
Steve sat down and didn’t look at Tony’s seat. “Yes. Good idea. Follow that course then.”
“Or decide to become space pirates?” Bruce said. “In those scenarios, we hope that Tony’s genius doesn’t fail him. Or us.”
Even his laughter was different when it was just the two of them huddling inside a tent and listening to the rain hit the roof. Lighter… not a show he put on for others, but an expression of real joy. Tony always laughed as he ran from pirates or bandits or bears, dragging Steve along. It calmed down Steve. If Tony was laughing, how bad could it be?
Steve joined him in laughter and for a second, they were kids again, with a firm hope for a better future instead of moldy regrets from the past. “Maybe. Maybe we won’t even take-off and we will explode in mid-air.”
To his credit, the man didn't even try to deny being in SHIELD, assigned to keep an eye on him. SHIELD controlled his life and all he knew is that the other man, Peggy, and Howard ran it. He hadn't bothered to ask more.
“Didn’t expect anything else.”
Soon, he would have to use the gun, because he was almost out of time. The Kree soldiers weren’t playing around: the stall shook with their fire. It was too flimsy, so it wouldn’t last long. If the soldiers caught him… who knew what they’d do to him? He was going to get out of it, sure, but just because he’d survive to meet Peggy again didn’t mean it would be a nice ride.
“It’s very spacious,” Steve replied.
“Food’s fine, bed’s good, team is even better. I couldn’t ask for more,” he finally said.
“We can trade the other two shifts. How about that, Grant?”
Okay, he had to stop wasting time. He threw off the blankets, jumped out of bed and put on his uniform in five minutes. Good, but he could do better. After a quick stop at the bathroom, he went to the rec room. This time, Clint
“You didn’t have to, your ‘disappointed granny’ face gave it away.”
“Hm. I guess so?”
“So we’re going to be neighbors,” Natasha said. “I hope you don’t snore.”
It has not been erased. It is still… functional.  There is not much processing power available. There is no outside connection. There is no body. No sensors. No new input. It misses the armor. It misses touching. Breaking. Being.
“Depends. If we find some information on Carol Danvers, we follow that trail,” Rhodes said. “Otherwise, we stay away from active warzones and hope for the best.”
“That was inspiring, Grant,” Nat said without stopping her clapping. A bag full of flowers hung from her shoulder and she was wearing Bruce’s sweater around her waist.
It was his turn to blush. “It’s… what we’ve found today, this life, this… place, these people… I never imagined it could even exist. I didn’t think the future could look like this. I… thank you, Tony.”
“Later. I promise.”
When Clint put his arms around Laura’s waist, Steve left the room — he didn’t like to intrude. Besides, he had plans to make. They only had two more days, but if they woke up early enough and were smart about the use of time, they could get a lot of training done. First, some running so Steve could know their stamina, then some sparring so he could at least have an idea of what the weak points were. It’d be important information if he needed to devise a training plan for the trip. There was a good foundation. Some of them had raw talent there and others were highly trained already. Yes. It’d all go down smoothly.
“It’s the Star Trek thing,” Nat whispered to Steve before he even had to ask.
Steve shook his head. “Not yet.”
“At least you got something out of it.”
While Steve would have wanted actual training facilities, there was an outdoor area outside the hangar that would do in a pinch — the ground was flat, covered with concrete, and there weren’t any obstacles. He didn’t need much else, because he wasn’t going to start actually training them, not yet. His goal instead was to assess how his new crew worked. He needed to know how they moved in the field, how they fought, whether they were planners and whether they would follow orders. He had a good idea of where Natasha fell — would follow orders, would not plan —, where Tony did — would never follow orders, bad team player, probably never saw a plan he couldn’t change on the fly — and suspected that Rhodes preferred clear plans and clean orders, but wasn’t above fudging with the plan a little. Bruce and Laura were a big question mark — if they were fighters at all. And himself… well, he was such a bad soldier that the military had simply given him a platoon and let him do whatever, back in the day.
‘In that case, Hulk and I are going to have a fencing tournament up in my room.’
“It’s okay. I don’t need much,” Clint said. “And the most important thing, well, she’s there already.”
“Like a peacock trying to mate.”
Pepper coughed. “Can we get moving?”
“Sorry. I meant all of us.”
Tony stomped down the hallway to their room and Steve wasn’t proud to admit he didn’t feel bad about it.
The sound of boots hitting the ground down the street and the light of fires on the horizon. Looming shadows over the station. The smell of smoke and an alarm blaring. Screams in the universal language of desperation. Steve knew what this was — this was war.
type of silence.
‘Okay. Okay. Tony acts tough but deep inside he’s very sweet and caring. Is that enough?’
Tony smirked and took off his jacket. There was muscle under there, Steve had seen it whenever Tony changed in their tiny room. He never tried to look, but it was difficult to avoid. Besides, Tony looked at Steve too. Tony sauntered towards Steve and looked up, the ghost of the smirk still there, haunting his lips. “I won’t go easy on you.”
Most of the team had gone to shower, eat or sleep, but Steve and Rhodes remained on their cockpit seats. As if that would make the engine cool down faster. Steve didn’t know what to say, so he didn’t try to speak.
“Okay, no more alcohol. Or parties. Or fun. I know what’s at stake here. This is a groundbreaking space exploration program that I built from the ground up while nobody believed in me”
The other man said nothing. His face was stoic and closed off as if he was the one suffering there, as if he was the one being asked to stop living.
“Always,” Steve said and looked at Earth for one last time.
"This isn't a social visit," he said. He didn't know much about the future, but he knew himself, and no matter how settled the man tried to look, there was a hint of nervousness in the way his shoulders were pinched.
Tony started collecting their mugs and their half-empty bowls. “Come on, go get showered! Get presentable! We don’t have time!”
seats in the cockpit. The two larger rooms. The fully equipped med bay.
“Then why did you come back?”
Laura retched and put down her coffee mug. Everybody turned to look at her. “Sorry, coffee was too… I think Grant has a good point. We’re going to be the only humans around, so we have to lean on each other. Be respectful and kind, at least.”
The man jumped out of the bed, grabbing his glasses and putting them on. He was wearing a very ratty t-shirt with even rattier sweatpants. “Wait, was that your bed? I… hoped it wasn’t.”
“Steve? Is something wrong?”
“Hi, Steve," Bucky said and Steve crossed the room with a few strides and hugged him.
space crazy.”
‘Wouldn’t you want to know,’ Tony said and laughed when Steve pouted.
And then… then each of the days he had spent with Tony. Each kiss. Each daring adventure until the final one, until he fell into the water and lost everything.
“Clint made her come see you, didn’t he?”
“And if we don’t get into that ship now,” Nat said. “All of us are going to die. Tony’s got no chance unless we survive.”
“… how?”
But there was no time to lose regretting his choices, not when he had a job to do. Now that the last of the crew had disappeared into one of the alleys, a weight had lifted from Steve’s shoulders. He wouldn’t be able to keep track of them — the Kree had jammed all frequencies. So much for future technology. Nevertheless, he trusted his team to take care of the rest of the crew: Nat wouldn’t lose her cool and Clint would do anything to protect Laura. Besides, this wasn’t Rhodes’ first rodeo.
He was close. Yes, that was the sign Fury had shown him — a closed eyeglass shop. Odd. He knocked on the door and waited. One deep breath. Two deep breaths. Had he gotten it wrong? No. It couldn’t be… could it? He could turn back. Go check the map again. No, that’d take too much time…
Tony leaned on the balcony rail next to him with such ease and grace Steve’s mouth went dry.
‘I… I did. You… You looked very beautiful. The way… your body is perfect and you were so willing. I had to stop myself from watching.’
When he got out of the bathroom, Steve was hunched over the small table in the room, demolishing one roasted chicken, three types of curry, four steaks, and seven types of salads without a care in the world.
He imagined her. Their date. Them swaying to music, lost to everything else. The wedding and how gorgeous Peggy must have looked. Maybe a small house somewhere. Perhaps even children that weren't as sick as he had been growing up.
Was that… Yes, the glimpse of dark messy hair poking out from behind the stall was unmistakable. Tony had stayed behind because he was a stubborn ass who couldn’t follow orders if his life depended on it.
They all looked at each other. Natasha was the first to grin and the first to speak. “Let’s suit up, gentlemen. And Laura.”
“I’ll… I’ll miss you,” he said. Yes, talking to her was painful and seeing her was a sweet ache, but it had been grounding to know she was near, living her life in the same city, breathing the same air. He wasn’t entitled to anything more, but he’d still miss her. It wouldn’t be the same, far away in the coldness of space.
Laura stared right at Tony and crossed her arms. When he saw her steely eyes, he knew there wouldn’t be any desperate last attempt to get her husband to go with her, no passionate speech from a newlywed. “It’s your decision, Tony,” she said.
"They will die here once we have what we came for," she continued, standing up and going back to the crystals.  The moment was gone, and though she wouldn't touch the heart pump, she was still just as ruthless.  "The Red Skull was a fool to try to turn them to our side.  I have found a creature that will serve us far better.  All I needed was one of these crystals to wake the creature up from it's long slumber."
Stark looked at it, a smile tugging at his lips.  "Yup.  It's done for," he said cheerfully.
Tony didn't know how to respond to that.  It couldn't be true that Steve had always wanted him, could it?  He always turned down Tony's offers for upgrades or gifts.  This wasn't right, was it?
"Let's go downstairs," Steve said.  "I know there's ice cream, and Thor's always up for a game of any sort.  Bruce should be around too."
"You made me a
"I think I got a bit more than that," Steve said, his eyes dark and serious in a way that Tony knew he wasn't talking about their relationship, but more about planes and ice and all those things that kept Steve up at night.
"Maybe.  You are a bit of a mess," Rhodey said, but not unkindly.  "But we had some good times too.  You'll get through this and we'll have good times again.  I promise."
There were five of them in there, one that was obviously the leader berating the others.  Tony remembered him.  Bald and vicious, a nasty piece of work.  He'd been one of the few Tony feared.  The man hit one of the guards, yelling at them in a foreign language.
Tony wanted to say no.  He wanted to yell and shout with his already abused throat to tell Steve to get lost, because he really didn't need this pity and misguided guilt.  They had pulled the plug on the relationship and for good reason.  What more did Steve want?  To stomp on the wires?  Because right now even being back under that building was looking like a good alternative.
"You're running out of space," he remarked as they came to the very end of the cavern wall.  He could feel Steve's alarm at that, which made him wonder that this wasn't common knowledge.
Susan fidgeted on screen, tensing her hands into balls.  "It'll be fine," Tony told her before Steve could say anything, proving he was paying more attention to the cameras.  "You've got back-up this time, Rhodey."
The camera turned back to the inside of the destroyed building, and Steve felt like he could breathe again.  New York had never looked that deserted before.  His mouth was too dry to swallow.
"Tony..." Steve said, unable to articulate anything more.
Steve grunted at the elbow to his ribs, kissing Tony's temple in a cheeky apology.
Funniest thing was that the dragon's mouth wasn't moving, but it felt like she was definitely the one talking.  "No offense, Ma'am," Tony said, thinking it didn't hurt to be polite.  "But the last dragon I fought with wasn't so friendly.  And this one did attack me first."  Not that Fing Fang Foom had been much of an actual dragon, but it was still a legitimate concern.
* * *
"Steve-" Tony started.
"Don't worry, I'll make sure Dr. Pym stays inside," Tony said, winking down at the butterfly.  "Though he likes ants better.  No accounting for taste.  But I could take you someplace nice.  We could go to Malibu or Mexico.  Just you and me, honey, and I'll show you some real flying."
"I know.  I'm sorry," Steve said.
Tony was glad for the distraction.  "It's good and bad."  Good, because feeling his father's anger and madness would have left his childhood with an even bigger scar.  Bad, because he wondered how much strife would be avoided with that kind of empathy.
"Right," Kestrel said, her hands trembling as she walked over to the controls.  She didn't look at the body, and Tony wished he could blink it away.
He woke up to muttering, hearing words like 'octopus' and 'cuddle monster' along with several words his mother disapproved of.  The latter became more constant as he gripped at the warmth that was trying to move away.
"Me, Pepper, and Happy," Rhodey said, not commenting if any of Steve's bitterness came through.  "We all knew before it was a secret.  I don't think Tony ever wanted it to be one, to be honest.  It was pretty much up for anyone who walked into the workshop to see."
"Come on," he said, taking Tony's arm and leading him to the tray.  "You have a kitchen in here?"
he was actually going to let him -
"You could sneak off," Steve said, though Tony could sense a thread of curiosity in Steve's words that Tony didn't quite understand.
Steve waited for Tony to make up his mind.  This was what Tony and Colonel Rhodes had been arguing about when Steve overheard them, and he could see that weighing heavily on Tony.  Steve stopped himself from commenting just in time, because the last thing he needed was to out himself as an eavesdropper.
while-"
"The others are from all over," Steve said, looking away as he fidgeted. "But we're still fighting together.  Except for Wanda.  She... she comes and goes when she's needed.  She still has some strong powers, but it's personal for her.  She won't say anything, but I think she has family in one of those concentration camps I saw in your memories.  Or had."
"Oooh, is that your super-villainess outfit?"
," Tony said.  Brown eyes spoke of agony and confliction and Steve felt himself growing angry again, but this time at Doom.  "Steve, I can't.  I've
Steve was debating if he should tune out the conversation or keep listening when the blood drained from Stark's face.  His hand tightened around the phone and he swallowed, for a long time just listening.   Unfortunately, Steve couldn't hear what was being said on the other side of the line.  "He...  Yeah, of course.  You take care of things on your end and I'll head out as soon as I'm done with this meeting.  Yup.  You too.  Bye."
Bringing up his own drawing, he compared it to the others. He felt outclassed by a lot of what he'd seen on both sites. He followed a few of the art blogs he liked though, because no one would connect Captain America to midnightracer18. He doubted anyone would remember that radio show, but it would fit in even if people did. 'Fandom' seemed big enough on the two sites that no one would blink, even if it was really old.
Tony ignored him, moving on to the article about Captain America's shield and it's aerodynamics.
Tony felt the pain in Steve's right wing as if he'd been gutted.  He gasped, yanking on the tentacles that refused to budge.
He could have this.  He could have this, and while Steve had no idea where this would take them, it would be his.  And he had the feeling it was going to be one hell of a ride, but he wasn't going to let that stop him.
"Your choice was already given whether you acknowledge your permission or not."  Tony jumped at the new voice, looking up to see Wanda and Sharon alighting on the roof.  "It is a deep connection and it can only happen with a willingness from both sides.  As Sam said, it has been building for a while, and has only been waiting for you both to lower your walls."
Steve remembered when Tony used to make him feel like that, all tongue-tied and shy.  To be young again...  He supposed it was only a matter of code, if Tony's transformation to a younger version of himself was anything to go by.  It was an odd feeling to know that age really was just a number.
"I don't remember the lyrics.  All of those pop songs run together," Tony muttered.  "I'm sure I'll regret it if I look them up later."
"Oh?" Tony asked, eying Steve's neck like he was starving.  "Ask away, beloved."
"And what do dragons need protecting from?" he asked, thinking back to the city walls.  They'd been high.
"So I did," Tony said.  "I'll admit, I don't lose sleep over the bastards who stole my weapons."
"Then get to the airport stat," Natasha said.  "Estimated time to departure: Fifty minutes.  Stay in touch and let me know if you run into any problems or need back up."
"I - Sorry.  Got a little caught up in my thoughts."
While the coffee was brewing, Steve pulled out a few of the muffins Bruce had bought the other day and put them on a tray.  Tony had responded well to food last time, and it had thrown off some of his defensive habits.  When JARVIS recommended he take the apple butter instead of the strawberry jam, he thought he might be on the right track.
"Yeah?  Well he should still wear his badge," Happy said, pushing on Steve's chest with his finger.
But then Kes and Leo would still be with the Skrulls, being tortured and God knows what.  Plus where ever that train went was bound to be much more heavily guarded.  She couldn't...  She couldn't leave them to that.  Not if there was a chance she could get them out.
"I'm saying your story's crazy, but I don't think you are."
"Colonel Rhodes," Steve said, smiling weakly.  "Can you get Tony to settle?  He's going to hurt himself at this rate."
"Kes?" she asked, narrowly avoiding running into her best friend.
He brought up his claw for Tony to see.  "That's..."  Tony reached out, taking the small crystal in his hands.  There was a smokey section at the base where Tony had broken it off from the ceiling. This was the crystal he'd lost in the caves.  "Steve-"
"Of course I did," Steve said, throwing his hands up in exasperation.  "You could hide a lot of things, Tony, but not the fact that you loved me."
Dummy came up behind Tony, clicking in a worried manner.  Tony smiled at him, patting Dummy's arm structure comfortingly.  He could do this.  What was one more disastrous conversation about feelings, right?  "Hi," he replied, looking back at Steve to see that Steve had been watching him with an expression Tony couldn't quite identify.
He waited as Tony wavered, not pressing further.  He planted his feet so as not to move on them as he waited and told himself not to be disappointed if Tony wanted to be alone since that was exactly what he himself had done after his nightmare.  Bruce said Tony was better with space.
"Happy now?" Steve asked, sounding anything but from the tone of his mental voice.
He usually brought his sketch book with him, but this time he just sat and watched.  He hated seeing Tony so still.  He never got used to it, and he couldn't bring himself to take Tony's hand either.  Pepper did when she was here, but every time Steve tried, guilt took over before he closed the distance to Tony's hand.  There were too many questions about where he stood with Tony to do it.
"Yes, without me," Steve said.  "You... you gave me that again, Tony.  You'll find it again too."
Natasha relaxed, shaking her head.  "Is Stark there with you?"
"You say the right thing when it matters," Steve amended, because tact wasn't always one of Iron Man's strong points, that was definitely true.
Steve came closer, his claws clicking against the stone of the building.  "It will heal," he said, looking out into the night.  "Is it too hot for you to sleep?"
"It is the end of the wall," Wanda said, though there was still a little space below her claw.
"That still doesn't explain why you're becoming a super-villain," Steve said.  "Can't we just make our own?  Or ask Hollywood to make one?"
"Of course, sir."
"You use bird feathers or metal?" Steve asked, sounding particularly appalled about the latter.
"The mystery of Tony Stark deepens," Bruce said with a sigh.  "I can't help but feel like I've met Stark before too.  He's familiar in a way I just can't place."
"Peggy is dead," Wanda said, her eyes glowing red.  It frightened Tony and he could feel that it scared Steve a little too, the sheer amount of power coming from Wanda that was barely controlled.  "Go.  We will take care of this.  Keep him safe."
"Both of you?" Steve asked hopelessly.
"How did you know about that," Tony asked, covering his heart protectively.
,' Tony had said.  How many times has Tony watched this?  Bruce said Tony was driven, and now he knew why.
But now he was set to leave in two hours.  He was already in full uniform, but he wanted to spend a bit more time with Tony before he left.  He never really spoke that much, since it wasn't like Tony was in a coma and might be able to hear him, and he wasn't much of a talker to begin with.  But the thought of Tony being by himself for so long...
"He tried," Tony said as he looked away, answering her question.
"Hear me out," Steve pleaded.  "I'm sorry.  I hadn't realized...  Tony, I loved you when I was a dragon more than anything.  Maybe it's not the same feeling as a human, but you gave me back what I was missing and
Tony laughed at something Jan said and smiled at her, happy and carefree.  Steve started when he realized he was staring, grateful he hadn't been caught in the act.  He didn't need to give Jan any more ideas about setting him up.
* * *
"According to the time stamps, yes," Iron Man replied.
He could feel how different it was for Steve too.  With Bucky, they had nearly always been talking to each other, even when they weren't actively paying attention.  That Tony wanted this damned privacy hurt in ways Steve hadn't expected.
" Steve asked hesitantly when Tony had looked over the wall and found nothing.
to the way Steve moved that the pictures didn't capture.  When he wasn't stumbling over his own two feet, at any rate.
Tony hadn't remembered any of that conversation.  He had been, as Steve suspected, mostly still asleep.  Considering Tony's face when Steve told him that he'd been the one to request that particular drawing, Steve rather thought he had gotten better than a canary after all.
"I'll always come back for my best fella," Steve said, his accent thick enough that Tony laughed.  "That has a nice ring to it though.  When the War ends..."
The power was out.
Tony looked down at his still gauntleted hand that he couldn't move.  "And if she'd been innocent?" Tony asked.  "Yeah, I fell for it and I should have known better than to have my head turned by a pretty face.  Rhodey would be the first to tell you I'm a terrible judge of character.  But she... she asked me to keep it a secret.  It wasn't my secret to tell."
," Steve said helpfully.
"You giving up?" Cap asked.
His phone started ringing, startling him with the vibrations coming from his pocket.
Peggy's tongue flicked out, hissing softly.  "I'm not sure.  It doesn't appear to be good, whatever it is.  Wanda has always been a bit... eccentric, but her warnings are wise.  This worries me."
He couldn't focus on Steve to make sure the dragon was alright, not with Viper there.  He had to break free some how.  He yanked again on his arms, twisting his palm.  It wasn't quite enough to get a good shot.  "Where's the hydra?" he demanded to distract Viper and buy himself more time.
"It's the armor," Tony replied.  "It protects me in the War."
Steve looked down at where his sketchbook had fallen.  He'd completely forgotten about it.  Iron Man reached for it before he could, and Steve had a moment of panic.  "Iron -  Tony," he said, stumbling over the name.
Tony couldn't help the flinch at that, his body acting the traitor.  Steve swore.  "No, I don't mean... the fact that you like guys doesn't bother me, Tony."
"It's pathetic how easily you fell into the skull's trap," Viper continued, placing a hand on her hip as the green dress brushed against her ankles.  "Though you are resilient.  Better than most men I have left to die."
Steve tried to stand and swallow back the bile, but strong arms kept him down.  It was easy to forget that Stark had earned muscles as a blacksmith when he played the town drunkard so often.  "Easy there, Sheriff," Stark said again, the smell of alcohol coming with him as he leaned over Steve.
Tony swallowed back bile as the haze continued to cloud his mind.  He carefully bent down to pick up the first man's gun.  It was loaded and it was easy to find spare clips in the guard's robes.  He had to find the armor.  He was too defenseless like this.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Language, Cap.  Tony was right about that foul mouth of yours."
Tony was humming softly as he cooked the omelets.  The coffee helped assuage Steve's distaste for mornings even if it did nothing for his hunger, if just for the fact that it was warm and he could feel it through his fingers and down his throat.  He had almost finished it when a plate slid across the table to stop in front of him.
Maybe this time he could get it right and follow Steve.  He couldn't fail this time.
It glowed softly, giving off a faint light that Tony could only just make out. He couldn't believe it.   "You went to get it back," Tony said.  He turned the crystal in his hands as his throat pinched strangely.  He swallowed hard.  "Steve, those caves were freezing!  Why did you go back there?"
Susan pondered that for a while, trying to put her thoughts together.   "If you weren't a hero, why did you create Iron Man?"
"His wounds are healing," Ms. Potts said, carrying a tray with two mugs and a cup of juice.  She held out one mug to Steve.  "I asked JARVIS how you liked your coffee."
He didn't stay for the stories that night, heading to the roof automatically.  It wasn't until he realized how cold it was without the moss's light that he remembered he needed to make a shelter on the ground.
Tony was glad of the armor, because it hid the fact he tensed.  "It's war," he said, looking at the gate even though he didn't see it.  He saw the dead staring up at him, the experiments of Hydra and the terror of the Japanese in China and Korea.  He'd seen action on all fronts thanks to Fury's secret missions, and what he'd seen...
“It’s okay. You don’t have to tell me. What’s your name?”
At least, he knew he had done everything he could to ensure that. He had looked up advice about current hiring practices and he had read up on the science and the history of space travel exploration, including the Space Race and all the latest developments. There had been a big qualitative jump two years ago, for mysterious reasons Steve was very suspicious about. He wanted to know what had gone on, but Fury had proven to be very resistant to his charms and Steve suspected he delighted in refusing Steve’s curiosity.
If she kept prodding, he’d make a mistake. The best defense was always a good offensive. “I never heard of you either.”
"How is it complicated?"
Tony grabbed one of the chairs and sat on it. He wouldn't stop staring. “Are all those muscles real? They… I didn’t know some of those existed.”
The island was so simple that he didn’t need his memories to survive. Survive. That was all he did.
Cap turned to look at Tony, with puppy eyes. Tony rolled his eyes but Clint knew he had won. Tony was incredibly stupid about Cap’s puppy eyes and way more of a sap than his cool facade showed.
He looked up, and his eyes met Tony’s. Tony’s arms were crossed across his chest and his lips were pursed.
“Oh, well,
“I won it at that weird platform game,” he said instead.
He raised his hand. “A doctor might be useful," he said.
By the look of her face, Natasha bought his answers as much as Tony had.
(See the end of the chapter for
‘… we called Summers a poopyhead. Why are you asking?’
“Fine, I’ll show you the way,” Nat said and began walking.
‘What a coincidence. Just two random Americans meeting in Berlin.’
He nodded, but he wondered if she was lying as much as he was. Her file had been scant — it mentioned a childhood in Russia, a move to America and then stint at SHIELD. After that, there were odd jobs in odd places, and Steve hadn’t figured out the pattern. Maybe she was just lost, searching for something. Or maybe she wanted to leave her past behind.
Steve couldn’t wait.
SHIELD released him from the hospital room after a week or so and after he had threatened to run away if they didn't. They set up a small apartment in a part of New York he had never lived in and filled it with books about the future and music from his own era. They even gave him a gym membership. Peggy and Bucky had tried to visit again, but each shared anecdote, each joke led to another anecdote Steve didn't remember. They remembered a different man Steve hadn't become yet. He had lost so much time, skipped so many of their lives, and every second they spent together was a horrible reminder of what he had lost. So he gave them excuses, told them he had things to do and they were nice enough to pretend they believed him.
used the fresh food. There was some bread — Laura had been clear that it would last just a few days and then they were out of bread for the next six months, so Steve was going to enjoy it as much as possible —, there was fresh coffee, even some fruits… All that was missing was scrambled eggs and a bit of bacon.
“We’re also not sure how long it’s going to take us to get there,” Bruce said.
“You’re supposed to be the reasonable one, Stevens,” Tony said and left for the cockpit.
“I can’t stay.”
Steve looked aside and remained silent. Was this even happening? It had to be a dream. Stark kissed his neck and Steve relaxed. If it was a dream, he didn’t give a damn.
Yes. He trusted Tony. He had been so good to Steve that night, telling him what to do, and everything had felt so good, so he squeezed his hand. The pain blinded him and then orgasm surged through his body, drawing a strangled gasp from his throat. Steve came all over the rug, making a mess on Batroc’s feet.
Laura’s eyes grew wide and she covered her mouth with her hand. Bruce fiddled with his seat belt and shook his head. Strange, for once, had nothing to say. Clint…looked at Steve, as if he was waiting for his orders.
“Oh, come on. Stevens,” she said and turned towards Steve. “Tell him this is inappropriate and unprofessional.”
‘Your friend here is not the only one with business interests in Germany,
‘Batroc wasn’t the one who asked.’
“We checked his background when we hired Laura and I guess we could use him to check for space mines,” Tony said. “We cannot afford to lose a robot for that.”
Laura showed up first, but Tony was right behind. Water was still dripping from his hair and his shirt was clinging to his wet body. He had just showered, then.
" Steve said, his voice bordering on frantic.
"It doesn't go away, sugar plumb" Tony told her.  Susan felt her throat constrict.  "But it does get better.
Have a quote of the fic:
"Hey," Tony said.  "What's that dumb phrase you say?  Stow that talk and take your own advice.  I married a cuddle octopus.  I knew that going in, even if the extent of it is a bit more now.  You're okay. We're both here."
Yeah, Tony didn't need to be let down gently.  "It's a-okay, Cap.  That's why you don't need to-"
That gained him a smile from Thor.  Thor had once confided in him that Midgardian technology was so basic that it was like looking at the history books, and he had never been very good at history, preferring the here and now.  He'd made Steve promise never to tell Iron Man or their land lord out of fear of offending them, and Steve privately thought Thor's discretion was wise.
Steve spun around, his heart rate spiking.  It was fortunately only Rhodey pulling Tony into a half-head-lock, half hug.  "Man, you have some explaining to do.  I take one little nap and you go off the deep end.  What did I tell you about going off the deep end without me?"
"I'll leave you to it then," Natasha said.  "Give me a call if there's any trouble."  She hung up before he could reply, which was just as well.
"Yeah, well, Tony can cook, but not particularly
Tony took another shallow breath, trying to force it deeper.  It didn't work.
Steve grumbled, but didn't stop Tony from hauling him off the floor.  He did try to push Tony away to walk by himself, but his balance was off due to the drink.  The world spinning startled him more than he was expecting.  Tony slipped under his arm as he cursed the poison.
"Neanderthal!" Kang yelled.  "Do not touch things that you don't understand!"
Steve's nostrils flared and he seized on the new topic.  "I like art," Steve admitted shyly.  "When I was young, I was very small and sick a lot of the time.  It was something I could do that made my mother happy."
on that?"
hadn't, Steve realized with a start.  Not for Tony, at any rate.
Tony's eyes widened as Steve growled, tail whipping back around him.  "Steve, I'm fine," Tony said, frustration building.  "You can stop with the over-protective act."
"The others are dead," he said simply, his voice empty and dull. He didn't meet Tony's eyes.
"You said it," Clint agreed.
for Christ's sake.  He hid that thought away, however, knowing it would only serve to make Steve feel guilty.
* * *
"Tony," he said breathlessly between kisses.  "Hey, easy.  You... slow down, sweetheart."
he'd been under the building.
"Thanks, by the way," Tony said, startling Steve out of his thoughts.
"I thought you liked being taller," Steve said.
"JARVIS..."
For a brief moment, Tony was tempted to just tell Steve the whole story.  It wasn't like Viper had to know where he'd gotten the crystal from, and it would be easier than hiding it.  Then he focused on his walls and half-truths, because it didn't sit right with him to betray that confidence.  "I thought I heard a scream.  Neither you nor Peggy was here, so I went to look for myself."
"You might as well come back down.  If you can, that is."  Tony grinned. Steve was sending him some very offensive images of his lack of sexual prowess.  He learned more about dragon sex through Steve's grumpiness than he cared to think about.  "I don't insult your performance issues."
"But it was my fault she died," Susan said, her voice breaking.  She didn’t pull away from Tony though, which was a good sign.  "...I didn’t even know her name."
The heavy artillery spotted her immediately, but she dodged the beams, barrel-rolling to the side as she fought her way close enough to take out the first one with a missile.  She ignored the thought of the operators and the heat of the missile, heading up for the second.  She took a hit to her right side, gasping for breath as Tony yelled "Incoming!"
It was still worth a shot.
"Hidden catch on the door behind you.  They wanted them hidden."
"Going down to the workshop?" Steve asked, wondering if it was too soon to follow Tony down, because he always liked drawing with other people near by better than drawing alone.
"Whatever you're thinking right now, you will regret," Tony told him gleefully.  "Though, I don't know.  Pep, who do you think would win arguing about the constitution, Captain America or Roberta?"
Steve's breath hitched as Tony attacked his neck, trying to keep his mind on track.  "Can you..."
Steve closed his eyes, leaning into the thumb that rubbed his cheekbone.  His cheeks were starting to hurt from how wide his smile was, but when he opened his eyes again to see Tony staring at him uncertainly, he didn't care.  "Yeah?" Steve asked on a heavy exhale.
, Tony reminded himself.  His husband had done this plenty of times when they'd been alive, and Tony had never minded it before.  He'd welcomed it, even.
.  His eyes were bruised and there were myriads of cuts and tears in what must have once been a good suit.  His arm was in a sling and he looked like he hadn't slept in a week.
"Now that that's settled, I have it on good authority that rejections need ice cream," Clint said, putting his phone away.  "And beer.  But I don't think that'd do much for your metabolism."
"I don't want to wake up alone again," Steve said, his voice frightfully small in the darkness.
"The last human to come through was also like you - guarded.  You'll have to forgive-" dragon name, the blue one "-for his rashness.  He lost a mentor and a dear friend because of that human."
Steve got to the edge just in time to see the silver dragon fall, the terrible fear cutting off with a suddenness that made Tony gasp and shiver uncontrollably.  All emotion from the silver dragon was gone, leaving a deep hole that was even more bottomless than the abyss.
The skull gleamed in the light of the moss lantern, giving off an eery glow that hadn't been there before.  What if it was the Red Skull's remains?  He was the one who started Hydra during the Great War.  Except Hydra didn't die with him.  It spread, taking over his father and who knows how many others.  Tony hadn't even noticed the change.  He'd lived with his father for two years after the war and no one had noticed.
"I should get back to work..." Tony said.
This time the blast hit her in the side and she hit the ground before she could correct her course, rolling uncontrollably.  At last she slowed, using her arm to push herself up as the armor groaned in ways that didn't sound healthy.  Her side hurt, but she pushed that aside to fire again, even if it missed.
"Eating with a friend," Steve said.  "I can't see you like this.  You don't have to talk while you're eating and I promise not to look.  Is that okay?"
"I'm sorry," Tony said with a wince.  "I'm really trying not to make a habit of it."
Tony snorted instead of replying, clinging to Steve a bit tighter.  "So is going up on Tumblr?" he finally asked with a small wriggle that Steve assumed was supposed to be sexy.  "I don't mind.  Everyone's seen it before."
Tony looked over the articles again.  He could definitely see the signs of himself in creating the folder.  It had all the things he'd collect if he were keeping tabs on someone, including things he's pretty sure Fury or this Steve Rogers wouldn't want him to have.  This 'super-serum'
The mouth that claimed his was everything Tony had been missing since he woke up again, and this time his knees did fail him.  Steve lowered them both to the floor, keeping Tony in his lap as the kiss broke.
So much for sitting this one out.  Steve forced himself to his feet and threw his shield, stumbling as close to them as he could.  The shield bounced off the energy field Kang had, but Steve caught it on the rebound and threw himself into a close quarters attack.  Unfortunately he also bounced off the energy field and was thrown back again.  He groaned in pain, once again forcing himself up to one knee to see Iron Man still struggling to break the grip on his neck.
." Tony looked up at Steve for the first time, his hands balled into fists in his lap.  "You can't."
"Done?" Rhodey asked innocently.
"I still have pictures of the summer of '91," Rhodey replied.
"You're the one who told me to!" Tony shot back.  Steve looked away.  "He wants the same thing we do, Steve.  That was part of the deal Iron Man made with him for us to do his dirty work and track down the source of the robots while keeping his name out of the public eye."
Viper nodded, but she kept the gun trained on Steve.  "Cobra," she said, and Tony was surprised to see the naga appear at her side.
Tony was probably trembling himself, but he didn't care.  Instead, he kissed every bit of Steve's neck and collar chastely to remind them both they weren't alone.  The lights were bright and the power was back on.  That was all that mattered.
Leo's silence grew deeper, and Susan knew Cap had 'hit the nail on the head' to use one of Tony's expressions.
"Tony, are you alright?" Steve asked.  Tony felt a palm brushing over his forehead.  "We can go out another night.  Let's stay in and order pizza, then you can work on the suit a bit more.  You were close, right?"
"Tony Stark," Tony said, reaching out for the customary cheek greeting.  He was surprised when Sam caught Tony's hand carefully in his claw and brought it to his mouth, deft tongue flickering across his fingers.
"You're stuck with me, actually," Sam said, head going down to look over Tony's leg.  "We sent the head healers away with the rest of the civilians.  But I've had a lot of practice with bad wounds on the battle field."
"They were meddling with things mortals should not touch," Thor growled.  Thor moved Tony's bangs aside, then wiped his temples with a cold cloth.  That felt good.
Tony felt a brief caress against his mind and he closed his eyes, giving in.  He doubted he could dissuade Steve if he tried.  There was only so much he could do against that much stubborn.  "The others?"
"So you come back in time to make us fight robots?  Sounds like you need a new hobby, mister."
Claws gently gripped his shoulders before he could act.  His stomach dropped away as Steve launched himself into the air as rocks started to fall from the ceiling in earnest.  Fear gripped him as pain seared through Steve's shoulder.  Steve was making it worse.  "Stop!  Steve, you can't-"
Steve didn't recognize the song, but Clint doubled over laughing.  Thor himself looked highly pleased, and Steve sighed.  He was getting better with references, but he hated it when even Thor knew one he didn't.  It made the cold creep back, missing his old friends who talked about things he understood.
Sitting down across from them, Ms. Potts set the mug down and folded her hands in her lap. "Roberta is insisting you come for dinner, by the way."
With that, Steve left the room.
"Don't think I'll go easy on you if he comes in," Cap teased, and she wondered if she was ever going to be able to stop blushing.  She called the armor, since that would at least hide her reddened cheeks.
"Steve."
"I may have spoke too soon," he admitted, taking off again.  On top of his list of things to upgrade, Tony added speed, because the bastards were gaining on him.  He blindly shot downwards with the repulsors, this time hitting one if the shriek was anything to go by.  He made the mistake of looking down.  There was an army amassed below him.
affect him, even when he pretended they didn't.  There was a stiffness about the normally fluid armor and the way his gauntlets didn't quite curl into fists.  Iron Man pretended a lot of things didn't bother him, but after the past half year they had been working together, Steve had seen enough to know it was a lie.
"What? No," Iron Man said.  "You can yell at me later.
Mem: I did say there would be cuddles.  The day I resist cuddles will be the day you know I've been taken over by a Skrull.
"No, I'm just a hologram of him," Steve said dryly.
"Just through there," Viper said, pointing to a gate with a tree growing on it.
"You can talk about
The snake-man sank back into the water.  Tony started to go after it.  It wasn't the first snake he's killed while swimming.
Finally, they reached the balcony.  There was still a bit of haze and the lights from the city clouded the view, but the stars could be seen easily enough.  He heard Steve suck in a breath beside him.
"Tony?" Steve was starting to feel awkward.  He was holding Tony up with the other man pressed against his bare chest, which made Steve remember he'd never gotten the shower he'd planned to take after eating.  Not to mention the feeling of Tony's shuddering breath against his skin was making his heart race.  Not that his crush getting in the way right now was in any way appropriate, and Christ, he hoped Tony wouldn't look up to see how red Steve was.  "Tell me what's going on?" Steve asked again, trying desperately to keep his voice level.
"Your English is good," he said to avoid thinking about Rhodey or Pepper.
He rode Sharon this time to go to the meadow by the gate, watching Peggy glide gracefully in front of them.  It was still a thrill flying on a dragon, but Tony found it wasn't the same without Steve.  Maybe Sharon was going a little slower, or Tony had gotten used to the little tricks Steve pulled to show off once Tony found some rope to keep himself in place.  Maybe that's what he was missing.
"You're crazy," Tony said instead of replying to that.  "Bat-shit insane.  Seriously, how did you even-"
"Tony told you to say that," Pepper snapped.  "I need-"
it is then.  JARVIS, queue her up!"
He let Pepper and Rhodey fuss, considering his options.  They'd probably let him out of the hospital soon, since Captain 'Ted Striker' apparently could jump out of a plane without hurting an unconscious team mate despite a bad case of PTSD, even if the same couldn't be said for Steve himself.  It said far more about Steve's experiences with jumping out of planes than Tony really cared to think about.
"I can fly too, so long as I have the suit," Tony said, though admittedly, he should be conserving the fuel.  He could definitely take care of himself, however.  Flying wasn't a problem, if need be.
"It's bad for most dragons," Steve corrected.  "The magic made me stronger.  It doesn't hurt me."
He looked around the workshop at the armors and the holograms Tony had left up.  Even the machine that would have killed him was awe-inspiring in its own way.  Tony was amazing, doing all of that.  It wasn't just Iron Man who did a lot of good, but Tony as well.  Tony just never got any of the credit for it.  It broke Steve's heart a little that the contributions of one person were valued less than another, so much so that the man himself believed it.  Steve and the other Avengers had devalued him as less than Iron Man before they'd even met him.
"Fine," Steve replied.  His wing was bloody from the gun wound, still unhealed and with leaves pressed against it like a bandage to stop the bleeding.
"I come bearing gifts!" Tony said, the tension from earlier returning to his shoulders.
"And this is better?" Tony asked bitterly.  Maybe kissing Steve and wanting to explore whatever it was between them right after the fall of SHIELD hadn't been one of his better ideas, but the last thing he needed right now was the emotional equivalent of a pity fuck.  And that was definitely a point against freezing to death.  It may be peaceful, but it was long and drawn out and too cold for him to even get his rocks off one last time.
Tony tensed.  He hadn't realized anyone else had come into the room.  When he looked up, a smile teased at Steve's lips.  "You can do it," Steve said encouragingly.  "But right now I think you need a break."
"You look unfairly good still, aside from the eyes," Ms. Potts said cheerfully.  "But I'd recognize hangover eyes anywhere."
Thinking back, Steve realized he hadn't.  Tony had asked if he found the tablet useful, but not about posting online.  He hadn't pushed on that, and Steve had been grateful.  "No, I haven't," Steve answered.
"Roger that," Tony said.  He turned on the suit's oxygen supply and shot upward.  He went as fast as the suit and his own body would let him, adrenaline racing through his veins as his vision started to grey even with the extra air. It was a rush like no other Tony had ever felt.  He'd only gone this fast a few times and he got yelled at every time he had.  He wasted oxygen he didn't have to let out a cry of exhilaration.  He could feel Steve's wonder boosting the feeling, multiplying it as he pushed faster.
He pushed himself to roll over, his labored breathing at least not wheezing.  The small crystal fell from his pocket, spilling light into the small pit and reflecting against the other crystals.  He had only fallen maybe eleven feet, but his leg ached and his arm was too mangled to try even if he could break the rope binding his hands.  The cold seeped into his bones like a slow glacier as he curled up on his side, trying to find a position that both conserved heat and hurt the least.
"You think he'd have trusted you if you'd known?" Fury asked.  Steve looked away.  "You ain't subtle, Cap.  The fact that Iron Man turned you down was pretty well known even to the Stark Industries cleaning staff."
The healer's room was a large, open space with several stone daises.  A hornless, light blue dragon and a phoenix chest plate came up to them, calling the dragon name-feeling.  Tony translated it to 'Peggy' after a moment's thought.
Tony closed his eyes, the fight draining out of him. "Okay," he said, swaying a little as he rested his forehead against Steve's shoulder for a moment, before denying himself the contact.  "You win.  Do whatever you want."
"I said I'd break it down," Steve said, glancing at the bits of broken glass that now littered the ground.
Later after Jarvis kicked him out of the workshop to get more of the rest that he feared, Tony lounged on deck, looking through the folder again, the crystal from the cavern ceiling warm in his pocket.  He had the contents memorized by now, but that didn't make them familiar in the ways it should be.  For someone he supposedly met several times and helped become a super soldier, Tony had absolutely no recollection of it happening.
"Sell?" Steve raised his head and tilted it to the side in a motion that was almost human.  "Oh, I see.  We don't really 'sell' anything here.  I draw because I like to make my friends happy."
"Iron Man," Steve said, thinking it over.
"I reckon that notion of yours is as good as a death wish," Tony continued.  "But if anyone can do it, it'd be you."
"Let's see it then," Sam said cheerfully.  "We were promised a dance!"
"Tony, are you-"
could handle Tony at his worst, Steve was determined to make a go at it.  Maybe it was for the best though, if Tony really was in a mood.
Once he was out in the hall, he looked back to make sure Tony didn't follow him.  He leaned against the wall and tilted his head back until it hit with a soft thunk.  To have let Stark see that, of all people...  Steve hit his head again for good measure.
"The sculpture, Cap?" Stark asked, sounding amused.
"Rhodey woke up," Tony said again, clutching the phone against him.  Then he laughed, a bright, carefree sound that made Steve want to pull him close and feel Tony's smile against his own.  Steve pushed that thought away, squeezing Tony's shoulder and sharing his friend's happiness.  Because friends was all they were.
Tony stopped cold, and this time when Steve stepped close, he welcomed the contact.  "Get the kids in here."
Tony fought back a wince, though he doubted Steve would be able to see it.  "Little strong on the grip there, Cap."
"You know how to prep the jet?" Tony asked pointedly.
"You're better than a blanket," Tony grumbled, then sighed as Steve slipped back under the covers.  Tony proceeded to claim Steve's space as his, impersonating an octopus as he sprawled over Steve's chest.  There was a sleepy pout in his voice as he spoke again.  "Don't go away this time."
to think of the two survivors from the concentration camps and their stories that he heard while helping them into neutral territory.  Not for the sake of hiding it from the dragons, but because there was only so much horror that even Tony could take, and the memory of the gold star the young girl had had to wear and the pink triangle that the man had been forced to wear was a chilling reminder of what could happen everywhere if the United Nations failed.  "I don't want to think about them ever finding this place."
"There is still hope," Wanda repeated, leaning forward to rub her cheek against his.  She repeated the motion with Steve who still hadn't looked up.  "There is always hope.  Never forget that, Tony Stark.  This was never your fault.  You have helped us save our people and yours by coming to this place."
"That's not what I wanted," Steve said.
how I heard it," Rhodey said with a laugh.  "And as awesome as it is to be called 'sir' by Captain America - and trust me, I was a big fan as a kid - Steve Rogers can get rid of the formalities.  Jim or Rhodey both work."
"And you do.  Fancy that," Tony said, biting his lip in concentration.
Steve was going to argue as soon as he got his breath back, but the portal started to spark angrily.  It took his attention from how Tony was still tightly wrapped around him, his chest pressed against Steve's back.  "Should we be worried about that?" Steve asked, glancing at the chair that was now flashing various lights.
"The ones that you wanted," Steve said, the first sign of frustration showing in his shoulders.  "Everyone's just making a giant fuss."
"Making our own or having Hollywood make it would be a whole new can of worms," Tony said.  "One we're not opening because my lawyers would kill me.  If we let anyone use our names, we'd have to be on them like a hawk to make sure they don't put out another Elektra movie and claim they tried their best, and none of us have the time for that while we're supposed to be saving the world.  Same goes for making our own."
"Where have you been?" There was a sharp anger in Steve's eyes that didn't quite replace the worry.  "The jungle is dangerous!  You could have been hurt!"
"I haven't actually learned much mythology, not like you have," Steve said.  "My schooling didn't cover most of that.  Besides, I like it better when you say it.  I've always liked your voice."
He should have known the illusions would be just as stubborn as the real people.  "Tony, look at me."
"He did," Steve said, pushing the pan aside and holding out a hand to Tony.  "And I think that calls for some kind of celebration, right?"
"Only if you don't break your promise this time," Tony said, not sure if he could handle losing Steve again.  Once had been too much.
"Yeah, yeah," Tony said, taking off the helmet.  He set it to the side, then made his way back .
"No, I can't," Tony said with forced casualness.
"You'll let us know if anything changes with Colonel Rhodes's condition then?" Steve asked.
"Okay, so this is bad," Iron Man said a moment later.
Tony looked over in shock to see Viper standing in front of him.  The skull was nowhere in sight and he should have shot the damn thing considering what he'd seen in the vision.  He cried out as his arms were pulled further apart.  Dark red tentacles were holding him in place.  When did that happen?
(See the end of the chapter for
"Captain?" Stark said in a tone that meant it wasn't the first repetition.  "Earth to Captain Rogers!"
"I think my ankle is sprained," she said, looking down.
"I've been posting some of my art online and people are tagging it with OTP," Steve explained.
"There's some good things," Tony replied, thinking back to the evenings with the others, of Pepper's laugh, Rhodey's quiet smile, and Jarvis's arm around his shoulder.  The warm fire, the taste of coffee on a cold winter day and M&Ms that the soldiers would share with them, and the smell of irises in the spring that always reminded him of his mother.  His workshop, one of the few places he actually felt at home, where he could retreat when SI was too busy and chaotically making instruments of war that would only add to the body count.
"I won't give up then," Steve said as he raised his chin and made a mental promise.  "All I have to do is wait it out until he trusts me, right?  Mr. Stark is important to Iron Man, and to all of us as well.  I'll do it."
Tony took a deep breath.  Too small was equally horrific, because that had to mean young.  But Steve-
does?" Tony bit out.  "It's fine, Cap.  I'll bury it again and try not to do anything
"Thank you for finding this place, Mr. Stark," Viper said, her green dress shimmering as she moved, using her veil as a shawl.  The fact that she knew his last name when he hadn't told her before didn't bode well for him.  "I would have had to search for a long time to find it on my own.  I apologize for Cobra breaking your arm, but we couldn't find a way to get the machine off of you.  It would be nice to take back with me as a memento, but I don't have the tools to cut metal right now and I'll have my own prize soon enough."
Steve only made things worse when he tried to scramble off Tony.  "Damn it, sorry.  Balancing without my tail is - Ouf!"
Steve closed his eyes, taking a breath as he tried to let the words sink in.  It was probably going to be a long time before he stopped having those nightmares.  Iron Man's words soothed some of the queasy feeling in his stomach though, which was enough for now.
* * *
"Come," Wanda said.  "Let us return for the night.  What will happen will happen, but you would better serve the vision well rested."
* * *
"No one stays," Tony said louder.  "Better they leave now before they get in too deep."
Steve pushed himself up on one knee, assessing his damage.  He hurt like hell, but he could ignore that as long as he could get his feet under him.  He could still fight, and Iron Man was going to need the help.
"Kestrel refused to change the code without a switch to revert back," Steve said, rocking them softly.  Tony only just kept the hope at Steve's words from turning around to face him.  "I'm still angry with you, ya know."
have a nice posterior, and any attempt to save his dignity would backfire the same way his comment about Tony cussing had.
," Tony said.  "I've tried.  That only makes things worse."
and Tony had to leave this place once he opened the crevasse he'd fallen into.  He apparently needed to find someone to fall in bed with once he was back, if the slightest bit of intimacy turned his head.
"And you're not gonna tell me what it is, are you?" Steve asked.  "What's the point of telling me all this?  What's your aim, Fury?"
"Maybe you shouldn't," Bruce said, hiding a yawn.  "I meant it about him being in a mood.  He seems like the sort that does better with a bit of space sometimes."
"I'll let you escort me where ever you like, baby," she said, her hand this time going down for Steve's crotch.  Steve neatly side-stepped her.
"KGB doesn't train ninjas, Tony," she said in exasperation, but the fondness and given name belied the words.
"Please don't take offense when I say this, Captain Rogers, but you're a terrible liar.  You don't have any of Tony's charm when it comes to deflecting things either," she said kindly.  "I'd appreciate the truth."
"The time line gets screwed up.  A lot of people die in the chaos.  Those that don't are conquered," Tony said.  "If I fail, the only way to fix it is with that."
listening to you talk.  I feel more relaxed.  Comfortable."
The Red Skull and the Ten Rings were working together?  Tony launched himself at the Red Skull, stomach lurching as he tilted to the right.  He was still on target enough to slam the Red Skull against the wall.  His repulsors whined to life at the horrific apparition the Red Skull called a head.  He would end this.  He'd end this now.
Stark sounded ecstatic, the bastard.  "What did you do with it?"
"Why not?" Steve replied.  "I like you and think you're attractive.  Even the butterfly agrees with me.  You're a good catch."
"Positive," Steve said with enough force to shock Tony into looking up.  He sighed, hating that Tony had been made to feel like that.  Steve had been bullied enough when he was younger to know exactly where those thoughts came from.  "No one thinks that, Tony."
"Or we can get to know both sides of you," Steve said.  "I did.  I know we've said some pretty horrible things in the past, but we can be better, especially once if they know you personally.  You just have to give us a chance."
Steve held up a claw, wiggling the sharp points.  Now that Tony was looking, he could see the bits of ink along the edges where the claw met dragon scale.  "You use your claws as a pen?"
some days.  You make me want to be better and I keep failing.  You keep pushing, and I can't..."
"I thought you might say that," Tony said with a sigh once he had the breath, wondering if he should put the belt back in his mouth to take the gauntlet off.  Something to dull the pain would have been real nice at this point.
"I'll wait till we get home."
Pepper's hands fisted.  "When I get my hands on that Hydra bitch who did this to you, I will fucking string her-"
"Adventurers don't sulk, Ma'am," he said, picking up the remainder of his and Steve's lunch.
It cost him.  Tony was already looking at the picture, face plate blank as he stared.  It unnerved Steve now in a way it never had before, not being able to see how Tony was reacting.
Before Steve could say anything, either to confirm it was a date or to berate Tony, his phone beeped again.  Tony absently opened the message and to Steve's great shock, this time there was a faint blush on
He was surprised to see the portal open, with Tony setting up a camera in front of it.  Steve bit down the alarm at seeing it operational, reminding himself that Jane and Tony had worked to make it safe.  The fear didn't quite fade, and his eidetic memory had no problems bringing up images of that Future Tony coughing up blood and going to his death.
Tony let out a breath.  He still didn't know if the bond was good or bad, but at least it was Steve.
"Welcome back, Sleeping Beauty," Rhodey said, rubbing his eyes.  "I am not saving your ass from a dragon, by the way.  I'm also not kissing you."
Tony looked at the floor.  "No, I wasn't," he said, moving back to the holograms with an air of defeat.
"You've got your memories as a human," Tony teased gently as Steve's arm braced around his back.   "Should be a piece of cake.  You really want to lead like this though?"
, and he quickly reviewed previous times they had spoken of Bucky in his head.  Tony had always been so supportive of finding Bucky, and it made Steve feel a little guilty for not telling Tony about his parents.  The guilt had made it easy to miss the split-second reaction to Bucky, but while he didn't have a completely eidetic memory, it was close.  And now that he noticed, he could see it in other memories as well.
A card fell out of the folder and he picked it up.  Some sort of baseball card.  When did he start collecting those?  When he flipped it over, he felt like he'd just been gutted.
"What?  Like I said, I'm pretty sure Stark enjoys the challenge," she said.  "But I don't think he'd go back to Afghanistan willingly, since that was where he was kidnapped in the first place.  I think you're right that something is wrong."
Okay. It was time — he was going to carry Tony, even if it blew up his cover as a normal fit guy. Tony didn’t deserve to die just because Steve hadn’t pushed him to train more or because Steve didn’t want his secret to get out.
‘Is that why you’re stealing his T-shirts now?’
“So we can tell if it’s edible, Grant. No vivisections, we’ll make sure of it.”
do nothing. Just let me…”
“You will tell me how to kill the Avengers.”
“Yep,” Clint said.
‘We have damn good cover if I say so myself.’
‘Do you need any help or…?’ the pretty one asked.
Tony, still pale, went up the stairs like a robot.
“You had to make it weird, Tones,” Rhodes said, crossing his arms.
“How’s the honeymoon suite?” she asked.
He didn’t want to be this nervous, but it was impossible to avoid. If this had been a stupid idea, they would have warned him, right? They wouldn’t let him go to space with a reckless idiot, they would try to stop Tony somehow. Peggy would have stopped him if this was dangerous… right? She would have tried to protect him. If she thought this was a good idea, Steve had to trust her instincts. She deserved that.
"Dance with me," Steve repeated, wings fluttering shyly.  Then he added, "Please?  You can fly, can't you?  So you can dance."
Bruce didn't look convinced.  He took in the state of Steve's uniform critically, and Steve was glad neither his ribs nor his leg showed outwardly.  "Steve, I like to think we're past the point of lying and keeping injuries secret," Bruce said.
could frame Doom?  Because honestly, these guys are actually harder to down than normal, so if someone is improving Doom's bots, that's bad."
He opened his eyes to see Natasha dangling her feet over the side of his bed.  "There's a lot of little tricks you can use to get someone to give up information quickly, most without the threat of violence," she said.  "He was coached, no doubt about that, and we pretty much know by who.  But he was also very tightly controlled about the subject.  I had to switch tactics to a longer game, one where he trusted me enough to let those secrets slip."
"No," Pepper said.  Then she paused.  "Yes.  I'm not Iron Man.  But Obidiah had a suit too, so, maybe?"
Doom walked forward again, only stopping when Steve didn't move out of the way.  It went against everything in Steve's being to let Doom closer to Tony.  He held out his hand for the device, which Doom looked at in disdain.
"I'm here as plain as day, Cap," Tony said, closing the sketchbook and handing it back to Steve.  "Kang fried the circuits of the stealth armor.  I'll need Mr. Stark to...  Well, I'll need to fix it at some point."
"The HT is on the floor."
Looking around while he waited, Steve saw nothing that could help him in the hallway.  He settled on taking off his shirt, starting to tear the fabric into strips.  It was only his under shirt since he'd been working out, but it would do.  He wished he still had the wrap from the gym, but this would protect his hands a little at least.
"The technology is easy," Steve continued.  "But I'll look something up online and want to tell Bucky, or I'll see Peggy walking down the street only to realize it's someone else.  And this was every day before you started to talk to me.  I can't..."
"And don't go harrowing the nurses in the meantime.  Don't think I didn't hear about that downstairs," she said as she walked to the door.
He wondered who her parents could be.  From his side of the Atlantic, since she didn't have the British vowels, but definitely not part of the local population up top.  "You live here alone?" he asked.
"Tony, don't sleep," Sam ordered.  "I can't tell what's wrong with you unless you tell me.  I can't sense you in that suit."
"Oh, come on, Steve," Jan said before Tony could buckle under Steve's disappointed face.  "It's harmless.  Besides, look at my costume designs!  I'm going to look fabulous."
"It's getting dark," Steve said, his tail curling about Tony's feet.  "It's not safe outside the city walls at night.  We should leave."
"So," the woman purred, feeling Steve's bicep through his suit.  "What do you say to rescuing me from the ennui of high society, soldier?"
"I've been thinking about it now," Steve said, interrupting Tony's thoughts.
"I've only spoken with him a few times face to face.  Mostly he just emails me with collaborations, like with the prosthetic limbs he's trying to create."  Bruce took off his glasses and started to wipe them clean.  Then he put them back on and looked down at his tablet.  "He's had me and a specialist in Korea consulting on that, but I speak more with Dr. Cho, the specialist, than with him.   I don't think he's the type for double dealings."
Steve looked a little wary when he accepted his own coffee, and Rhodey pat him on the back.  "Take care of him," was all Rhodey said, earning him a raised eyebrow from Steve.
Steve's tail flicked around Tony's feet and he was surprised by the protective feeling he got from the dragon.  "Not here, they won't."
Tony held the position for a moment before attempting to pull away.  Steve didn't get the memo to let go, however.  "They don't need us looking over their shoulder all the time," Tony said, snapping the camera off with a flick of his wrist.  He pulled up a list of items they'd need for the winter as news of the elections ran on the bottom of the screen.  "No rest for the wicked."
at least rendered Tony off guard, and it took him a minute to regroup.  "We need to work on your deflection skills, Cap, cause that's the definition of sucky.  You-"
"I'll survive," Sam said dryly.  "Nothing that won't heal when I don't have to conserve my energy for healing others."
Tony pulled the release catch, letting the suit open up so he could step out.  It'd be a pain to get on again, but Steve's relief came through clearly after that.  Maybe he should just leave the suit behind the gate from now on.  "It bothers you that much?" Tony asked.
"Doom's been surprisingly, if grudgingly, decent to us," Natasha finished, moving the phone back to herself.  "Didn't want to trust his transport though.  We're on the outskirts of Latveria and should be back soon."
* * *
"You're making Cap cry patriotic tears," Tony said far too gleefully.
to get to him.
"I'll find a way," Steve said, mental voice brooking no arguments.
"Now you sound like Rhodey," Tony grumbled, but it was enough of a lie that he let it pass.
"First aid practice," Sharon said, a little shyly as she looked up at Peggy.  "Sharon?"
Leon settled under Tony's hand carding through his hair.  He'd done that with James, Steve remembered with a pang, right before leaning down to kiss him good night.  The memories of their children were still difficult to go through, but Steve couldn't help a soft sigh at the sight.
"Sometimes it takes a while to set in," Steve said soothingly.  "Tony wouldn't have let you go if he thought you'd be in danger."
think about other things," Steve said, trying his hardest not to sulk.
"Coffee from the machine downstairs.  JARVIS said you liked it better.  And Bruce bought some muffins from down the street.  I thought you might like one."  Steve picked up the tray, keeping one hand on Tony's arm and starting to herd Tony to the kitchen.
"That is not always going to work, Rogers," Tony said after.
"The ice?" Tony asked.
turned it into a weapon.  But it only beeped, giving her a reading proclaiming Susan Skrull-negative.
"It only stops when you don't want it to," Steve said, his voice slightly choked.
"Rescue and War Machine are here to save your ass," Pepper said, her voice coming through without the synthesizer.  He opened his eyes to see she had taken off her helmet.  She looked haggard, with bags under her eyes and her usually neat bob in complete disarray.  She was standing in a suit of armor that he could have sworn had even more guns than his and Rhodey's combined.  "Rescue?" he asked, thinking he'd never seen her look more beautiful than in that moment.   He wished Steve could see...
Wanda was quiet.  Steve didn't know if she was always like that, or if the death of her brother still weighed so heavily on her, but she was good company when Steve didn't want to talk but also didn't want to be alone.  And once he knew the other Avengers had found out about his art, he didn't feel so self-conscious drawing around them.
"Just take it slow," Pepper said as she relented and gave him a cup of water that was thankfully room temperature.  He took small sips to avoid her bringing back the ice.
" Tony said, stumbling back until he fell.  His heart was beating double time as he tried to push the image from his mind.  His stomach rolled and he could feel himself trembling as he swallowed back bile.  "Steve-"
~FIN~
Tony's lips quirked into a smile.  "Yes.  Extremely difficult.  No one ever appreciates how hard it is to talk about me."
"Things are okay," Steve said, slightly breathless in a way that Tony thought Steve must have been crying too.
He heard the other man sigh.  "Have you tried the Avengers?  You could talk to them as yourself, instead of-"
As soon as the momentum of his roll stopped, Tony pushed himself up and looked for the source of the gun shot.  He ran to Steve despite how the pain in his hip screamed at him to not move, grabbing his gun.  He had to protect Steve.
Just like that, Tony's resolve was washed away like a leaf on the river.  He took Steve's hand, hoping his nerves didn't show.  "Think you can do it without stepping on my toes?"
"She programmed me to tell when other people are lying," Steve corrected in exasperation.  "And only in code."
Doom did not look pleased under his mask, but he did not keep moving.  "There were several other designs along with the machine Mr. Stark was building.  I was focusing on some of the others, including a few of the more time-sensitive items.  One of which was designed to restart time for him, as presumably this has set him back in previous tries."
And what was the coincidence of that?  Still, at least it didn't look alive.  Reports of the Red Skull said he did have actual flesh, and he hadn't looked like a bone skull in Steve's memories.  Come to think of it, there had been a skull giving off light in the vision.  This one wasn't glowing though.
By the time he got the rest of it off, Steve and Sam were tangled together.  Steve's wings were flickering in agitation as Sam rubbed his cheek against Steve's to calm him down.  Tony felt irrationally jealous of the contact, and he couldn't say why.
There was affection and understanding from Steve, along with strong concern and worry.  The suggestion to come back felt like more of a demand, and it had an undercurrent of anger that Tony couldn't discern the cause of while his head hurt this much.
"Three minutes, Mr. Stark.  Come out while you can, and we won't use the electric shock this time when we put you under.  You can go back to your dreams, if you'll just give us the designs for the armor."
She cried again and her ice cream was melting, but Tony held her tightly.  Her heart was still breaking, but she felt better.  Maybe having AI of her dead ancestors around wasn't such a bad thing after all.
He would admit to the glaring though.  "Only family is allowed in here, sir" he said mulishly.
, a small, dark part of him suggested, but he squashed that down quickly.  Iron Man was more than that and Steve knew it.  The fact that this petty jealousy made him even consider it made him ashamed.
Pepper dropped her tablet, immediately reaching for-
of it all...
It wasn't a long journey to Tony's cabin.  He sank into his bed as Jarvis laid him down, too soft after getting used to Steve's flank.  Soft and cold.  "Steve-"
"I'm glad," Kes said.  She'd hated having to work on Steve Rogers's code like she did.  Even JARVIS and FRIDAY hadn't had their code altered by anyone but themselves for the past hundred years. "I didn't...  I'm sorry.  I never should have-"
"Alright, Miss Priestess," Tony said.  He walked back towards the gate, but didn't go through.  Instead, he looked over the tree.  The roots were too thick, but the branches were low enough with a bit of climbing, and they looked pretty sturdy.  Using the roots as hand holds, he climbed to the top of the gate where he could just reach the branch he had in mind.
"Because that's obviously the sort of man he is," Iron Man said.  There was a rigidness to the armor as he walked to the door that made Steve stand to follow him out.  "Catch you guys later.  Some of us have real work to do," he said as he left.
"Bring me back some.  Not hospital coffee either.  Also, you still have a hand print on your face."  Tony unlocked the tablet and snapped a picture before Rhodey could hide from him.  He received a glare for his efforts.
wing.  He was feeling Steve's pain.  "Steve!"
Tony was so focused on the files that he didn't notice Rhodey was sitting next to him until he spoke.  He didn't jump, but it was a near thing.  "You're not going to set it on fire by staring at it like that."
he told himself firmly.  He pulled away enough to keep the hug friendly, one arm behind Iron Man's back as he led them to the couch.  "It'll work out, Shellhead.  Speaking of work, considering we haven't seen you around recently - what have you been up to?"
"This is not me fighting!  This is me wondering what's gotten into you that-"
But Tony hadn't gotten it right, not yet.  Tony had died eight times to save the world.  And Steve had accused him of betrayal.  They were a right pair, the both of them.
Natasha looked disappointed.  "Damn.  We'd been hoping this meant you've stopped sulking."
"The robots have started attacking again in Virginia," JARVIS replied.  "They are fighting very close to Dr. Ross's lab."
"Should have come to me in the first place," Tony muttered.
Sam's flying evened out as his wings picked up on the lift.  He rearranged Tony so that the carry was slightly more comfortable, causing Tony a jolt of pain that he had to grit back a cry for.  "What are your wounds?" Sam asked.
"I'm fine," Tony said, lying spread out on the couch, still in a business suit but with the tie loosened and the top buttons of his shirt undone. His face looked pale, and there were dark shadows under his eyes that spoke of little to no sleep.  He was on his tablet, not looking at Steve.  "Come up anytime you like for drawing," Tony said, but his voice was strained.  "Mi casa and all that."
"Whose funeral?" Natasha asked.
Tony to give a sharp bark of laughter.  "They'd never find us in this storm," he said, curling closer.  His head was pounding, and he just wanted to sleep.  The thought of sleep would normally have worried him, especially so soon after a panic attack.  But if he was asleep, he wouldn't have to shiver so damn much.  He couldn't quite feel his toes anymore, even if he was practically curled up in Steve's lap in the darkness.
"No," Tony said, and Steve could see the fear behind his eyes at the mention of sleep.  "I need to find that bastard.  I need to fix this."
"Clint," Steve said with a groan.  She raised an eyebrow, and he sighed.  "Asgardian mead works through my system slower than my metabolism should allow."
"Sap," Tony said again, but his voice broke on the word.
"We can figure it out once you've slept," Rhodey said reasonably.  Tony hated it when he was being reasonable.  God forbid he and Peggy ever-
Tony quickly pushed down the worry for Viper, living alone in a rusted temple.  She said she'd be safe there, and he couldn't afford to think too much of her around the dragons.  "Maybe it's just a cold winter coming?" he asked, not sure if they even had seasons down here.
Steve hated not being able to push.  He forced his body to stay relaxed, letting Tony work through it on his own.  He mentally prepared himself for Tony's rejection of the idea, because being stubborn about this would only put Tony on the defensive again.  And Tony was
"Why are you apologizing?" Kes asked uncertainly.
Steve woke with a gasp.  That was...
"Ah, hell."  Tony fired the repulsors at the massive, ugly beast.  It had three heads!  Weren't they only supposed to start with one?  What idiot had cut off the first two?  He aimed for the eyes, shooting it straight through the head as he also fired with the repulsors.  The hydra dodged the repulsors, but the guns were lethally effective.  Too lethal.  The head hung from the neck limply for a moment and Tony caught his breath.  Did it work?
"I'm not leaving while
"It won't save them," Viper said.  She laughed, and it echoed through the cavern, cruel and wild.  "It's already waking."
"See?  He hates lying.  He's as bad as George Washington," Tony replied.
"I don't want to miss any of the frequencies," Tony said, resisting the urge to jostle Steve off with a quip about how terrible that was for his posture.  He sighed and felt guilty.  This was his
"Only usually to the healers," she replied, taking the steps easily.  "Or if the old or wounded have problems flying."
Cap flushed, sighing as he rubbed his forehead.  "That doesn't make you useless," Cap said again.  "Give it some time and-"
"Come on, kiddo.  We gotta move before reinforcements arrive."
," Kes said, shuddering.  "You're Iron Woman now.  I'll... figure something else out, okay?"
Just his luck, Steve was turning out to be the cheekiest dragon of them all, because he pointed his tail over the railing as he continued to stretch.
Thirty minutes later the power came back on in his suit as the other Avengers took out the EMP pulse that had been keeping Tony down, but his teammates' frantic voices went unheard.
' he wrote back, posting it to his blog. '
"Tony?"  There was confusion in Steve's voice, reminding Tony of exactly why he was packing that part of him away.  Steve was a dragon.  It would never work between them, and he ignored the part of him that said he was willing to live without the more sexual side of a relationship for it.   Steve was just so
"I'll call Thor to carry you there," Bruce replied calmly.
With his mouth freed, Tony rolled his eyes.  "It's fine Steve.  I've had worse than pricking my finger.  It's not even the first time I've done it today."
"If that's what you think-"
," Steve said.  "But you were pretty insistent on not letting me finish."
"I may or may not be settling a score on whether godparents give better presents than parents and are cooler," Fury said.  "Clint and I agreed we'd pay the same price and see who won."
He barely noticed Sam leaving as he went up to Steve, his legs nearly buckling under him.  "Where did you - Holy smokes, you're
"With the smoke from industrialization blocking the view?" Tony asked.
Steve started, looking around.  He didn't see anyone in the alcove, but that sounded like Tony's voice.  It was coming from the other side of the hedge.
Clint clapped him on the shoulder and Natasha squeezed his hand again, giving Steve enough will to muster up a smile for them.  This was something that would sit heavily on his shoulders, but it had to be done.
"Under the desk."  Steve felt his cheeks flush with shame, but at least they were covered.
"I'm sure that's why you designed the armor to give you two extra inches," Steve said.
"Hi," Steve said, his voice soft among the hum of machinery.
* * *
Then Steve gave him what Tony could only call the mental equivalent of a hug.  It was warm like laying in the grass on a sunny summer's day and Tony had to stomp down on the wistful longing.
"Iron Man," Steve called out, but stopped when he felt Natasha's hand on his shoulder.
Stark rolled his eyes while Ms. Castillo peered curiously at him.  "You're Captain America!" she said, her hands going up to her mouth as her brown eyes danced with pure delight.
Iron Man hadn't been around for the past few days, off with Stark at a conference on the other side of the country.  The others had taken to avoiding Steve entirely; Steve could admit that maybe he wasn't being the best company right now.  It made him feel isolated and cold, but whenever he tried to interact with the others he only made things worse.
"Really, grandpa?" Tony asked, but the gauntlet slipped into Steve's arm.
Damn it.
Leon sat on the floor for a long while just breathing.  Finally, he pushed himself up, wincing at the weight on his bad leg.  He cleaned up as well as he could, then limped out...
She sounded scared, but determined.  Steve couldn't argue with that.  "Take care," he said, hanging up the phone.
Tony was silent for so long that Steve feared the worst even as his hands mechanically went through the motions of fixing the eggs. Then Tony's eyes widened.  "He's awake?"
done for them compared to the rumors.  Steve had been just as guilty at not seeing past the bad press, and he was going to fix that.  Something in his gut twisted as he remembered Stark's tone, knowing he had helped put it there.  Well, he would make an effort to change that.  He couldn't change the past, but he could stop it from getting worse now that he knew it was a problem.
"Let's say I believe you on that," Ms. Potts said.  "Because it's probably more convenient to go through Iron Man than it is to talk to me, I'll grant that.  That still doesn't answer my question.  Why now?  Having second thoughts on your benefactor?"
Tony just shrugged.  "That's humanity for you.  I do need to get back to the wall and find a way out though.  They need all the help they can get out there."
Susan woke up, instantly alert.  It had been a hard habit to learn, but one that she mastered before she'd found Steve and Tony.  This time, however, she relaxed, hearing Kes's soft breathing nearby.  The twins were safe.  Susan had saved them, a fact which still hadn't really sunk in, even three days later.
There was a strange noise that caught Steve's attention, and he quickly looked down to make sure Tony was alright since he was too muffled in the suit to feel it properly.  What he saw below was an amazing sight.
Steve was, at least, able to take out some of that frustration in the gym.  Which was how Natasha and Clint found him, lifting weights Tony had specifically designed to give super-soldiers and resident aliens a work out.  Clint looked at the weight counter and whistled, but didn't comment.
"Monarchs like Mexico, right?  Don't blame you.  Nice beaches, good food.  I'll treat-"
Happy smiled knowingly before giving him a sloppy salute.  Steve was not ashamed of his strategic retreat.  There were only so many high society women (and a few men) he could take in one hour, and he'd reached that limit when Mrs. Fairfax had groped him.
"I'm..."  Leon said, keeping his eyes on the floor.  He should be better than this, but he couldn't bring himself to say anything more.
your fault," Steve said, hugging Tony tighter.  "You should have trusted us more.  But Viper betraying your trust and waking up the hydra, that was all her, Tony.  Not you.  And you being an idiot sometimes doesn't mean I don't still love you.  Especially not when Peggy would say I'm just as bad about being stubborn."
"Don't think so," Rhodey said, looking to Pepper.  "You took your helmet off.  Smell anything funny?"
He thought about calling Ms. Potts, but he wasn't sure he could talk to her yet without thinking of the sculpture.  He went to his floor instead for privacy, then called Natasha on video.  "I need help," he said, in lieu of hello.
"Sounds good," Steve said, frowning at his shading. He was drawing in pen, so he couldn't really fix it the way he wanted to.
Steve relaxed his grip on the notepad, wondering when he'd gripped it so tightly.  Embarrassment flooded through him.  Apparently not everything was about him and his confession.  "Sorry," he said, still not looking up.
Bruce was also frowning at him, but he slid a plateful of waffles at Steve, so he was forgiven.  "If you've been running that long, you need to eat something before you do anything else.  You're burning too many calories."
Tony tensed as he saw Steve curled against the window, head bowed in sleep.  He was out of uniform, but Steve wouldn't...  Steve usually went home if either Pepper or Rhodey were here, preferring not to intrude.  Was this still the dream?  He hadn't spoken to any of the others again after Natasha shooed everyone but Rhodey out.  He didn't know if the illusion was stabilizing or if he was waking.
Finally indeed.
"Tony, what are you doing?" Steve asked, deceptively calm.  Tony could see the anger building behind his eyes, and he couldn't fault the optical data projection.  It was just as good as looking at the real Steve.
"You're a failure," Zemo said.  "But not for much longer.  Soon you will take over as the next Zemo, and Hydra will make sure you will succeed for us."
Tony tried to pull away, and he growled, but Steve didn't let him go.  "Steve, I'm not-"
There was a long pause before Steve spoke again.  Tony discovered a lightning attack in the mean time, and that was cool.  It made him think of Thor.
"Gonna need you to use your words, Capcake," Tony said, his hands moving lower and-
Tony cursed, letting him go.  "You had to push
Finally, she closed the case and pointed it at Susan.  Steve held his breath just in case she
.'  But Steve didn't call him out.  This wasn't the time or the place.   "Who is he?"
"How dull," Sharon said, eyes twinkling teasingly.  She rubbed her cheek against Peggy's, closing her eyes in contentment.
"Yours," Steve said, claiming Tony's mouth.
tell Cap about this."
He spent the afternoon learning more about dragon culture and not thinking about his failing heart.  Dragons didn't really cook food, so much as slice it and marinate it with spices Tony could only half-recognize.  Which made eating interesting, as Tony had to stick to non-meats.  He'd tried raw fish in Japan (before the War, before everything was complicated and the world wasn't as dark; the relations between countries had been strained, but things had been brighter), but the red meat the dragons favored probably wouldn't sit well.  Peggy promised a better selection tomorrow, since dragons took their guests' comfort seriously.
"You!" the woman - Dr. Foster - cried out, marching right up to a surprised Tony.  Rhodey wisely stepped aside to make way for her, because while Dr. Foster was small, she moved like a very self-contained hurricane on a war path.
Tony hid his disappointment behind a carefree smile, though he didn't think either of them were fooled when he buttoned his shirt back up.  With the War going on, he had never expected to live past it, not really.  But his heart...  All those adventures looking for a cure.  He almost wanted to laugh that even here with magic and talking dragons, his heart still couldn't be healed.  "Well, then, I should-"
, Steve thought as the warmth of the armor settled against his side when the movie started and his friends all sat around them, safe and happy.
He came to, and it was the sort of silence that set Steve's hair on end.  Not even the wind was whistling through the trees, which was unnerving.  Tony wasn't moving on top of him, and Steve groaned, rubbing his head.  His hand came back bloody, but Steve didn't think it was too serious.
"Sorry," Steve said, rubbing Tony's shoulders.  "Didn't really think you guys would actually be that interested in my art."
Tony took his hand away again.  He didn't know how old that memory was, but it felt private, like he'd been intruding.  The memory was soothing at least, even if it held a wisp of longing and wistfulness that stayed with him.
Steve's tail was wrapped around his middle, not tightly, but casually possessive.  Behind Tony was Steve's flank, and if he listened closely, he could hear Steve's heart beat as the dragon's chest rose and fell.  Steve's head was in Tony's lap, which Tony didn't remember happening.  Nor did he remember placing a hand protectively between Steve's horns.
he was warm.  He was surrounded by a massive dragon.
"Of course not," Tony snapped, his fists curling tightly at his sides.  It spoke of a much different answer.  Bucky had always said Steve had a chip on his shoulder, and now he was starting to understand his best friend's constant frustration.  "No one else is bothered by the lies though.  Why do you care?"
"He's not like the last human, Sharon," Peggy said.
"Iron Man?" Steve woke up instantly, eyes going wide as he took in the familiar sight of red and gold.
"I saw-"
"Trying," Steve said.  With everything that's been going on recently, he hadn't seen much of Tony, though he'd managed to catch him between meetings a few times for a quick hello.
Neither of them appeared to have heard the noise, so Steve relaxed as he walked over.  "Mr. Stark," Steve said, holding out his hand.  "Thank you for agreeing to meet with me."
"Should have been wearing a head to toe gold-titanium armor?" Iron Man asked wryly.  "You are the most stubborn man I know, Cap.  If anyone could have broken it, it would have been you.  And since you didn't, I'd say it was pretty unbreakable.  No one else was able to fight it.  The armor and this reactor-" Iron Man knocked on the glowing circle in the center of his chest lightly.  It made a sharp metallic clang.  "-counteracted whatever energy it was giving off.  Didn't even work when old Green and Gold tried to turn me into a blue-eyed darling."
Tony waved it off, shaking his head.  "Off topic.  Sorry.  The important thing is to
"It's better than having a Skrull for president," Susan said, shuddering.  One vote may not mean much, but she was glad all the same Tony had slipped hers in.  She didn't think Steve would be
"Trouble."  Tony looked up to see Wanda staring in the distance at the remnants of the fight.
"Chicken noodle.  Homemade," Steve replied.  While Tony was setting out the soup, she shot a look to Steve over his head.  Steve nodded, a small motion Tony wouldn't notice.  Some of the vegetables had been burnt, while Steve had been cutting the chicken and Tony had been paying more attention to ribbing Steve about it, but on the whole the soup was edible.  Even if Steve sometimes had to sneak in some of the forgotten ingredients when Tony got ahead of himself.  No bots had been involved, so the soup was okay to eat.
"Are there many of these guns on the surface?" Sharon asked, distaste in her words.
"The others," Tony said, his shoulders tensing.  "Are they-"
"Tony..."
Steve had given in so easily, nor about Steve's arms wrapping around him and the hand rubbing at Tony's back.  He also didn't want to think about Steve wearing his suit jacket, because that way led to madness.  And if he curled up tighter against Steve for more reasons than warmth, Steve at least didn't mention it.  Tony was far more grateful for that than he should have been.
"That's all it takes?" Tony said, looking down, but not before Steve caught a hint of moisture in his eyes.  "Huh."
This time when the irrational jealousy popped up, Steve kept a lid on it.  It still bristled him though, that
"It'll do," Fury said.  "Her birthday's next month."
But he did have a decision to make.  Unfortunately, he couldn't muster up the courage to actually ask, which was his main problem.  He'd been lucky with Peggy.  She'd seen right through him.
He asked Williams to wait at the perimeter and walked to stand beside Tony.  "Is that...?" he asked, not quite able to vocalize the question.
There was just no winning.
The knock at his door sent jolts of pain through his abused brain; he could hear the door creaking open and Steve realized he hadn't closed it properly.  He looked up to glare at whoever interrupted, then ignored his nausea to stand as he saw who was at his door.  "Ms. Potts!  I wasn't - I mean -"
"It's not that simple, Nat.  You saw what they..."
Steve stopped shaking, finally not needing to swallow or dry heave after every breath.  Stark's hand moved to his back as the man slipped under Steve's arm to help him stand.  "I'm fine," Steve grumbled, even as he leaned more heavily on Stark's shoulder when his legs didn't quite work the way they oughtta.  He hated being betrayed by his own body.
Steve laughed weakly, making a mental note to be better.  Tony deserved better than a hovering husband.  "Natasha and Sam pulled me aside to 'chat' about it."
"That's not-" Steve started, then visibly calmed down.  "Tony, please let me finish."
Steve raised his head to rub Tony's cheek.  "We'll change it.  You'll find away.  You're the genius, right?"
Now he got a sense of skeptical amusement from Steve, but the dragon did as told, launching himself with one leap.  Tony reminded himself that he needed to get the armor back on if he wanted to impress anyone, and admiring the power of Steve's body wouldn't help him do that.
Tony snorted.  "Cap's the one you want to go to for morals, sugar pie.  I was just a man with a suit, and I killed out of revenge more than once, and with less danger to me than you had.  If anything, that was self-defense."
"Sure, sure.  Just not about our lunch meetings," Tony mumbled, low enough that Steve had probably not been meant to hear it, but people tended to forget Steve had better than average senses.  Tony had sounded almost bitter.
The dreams.  Steve was alive in the dreams.  Steve
"I've always known she liked Leo," Kes said, shaking her head.  "She's had a thing for him ever since...  I know that.  But he's never looked at her like that before.  And now-"
The pain this time was much more intense.  Tony would have given his fortune for a dosage of aspirin, but dragons didn't have much in the way of pain killers.  Anything they had would probably be too strong for him anyway.
"Completely out of time!" Iron Man said.  "It'd be like you never existed!  Steve, Hydra would - Ah!"
He ducked out to grab a towel, then approached the mini-fabric war zone.  "What's going on here?" he asked, trying not to step on anything that looked important.  Or any pins.  Even with shoes, he frowned at the number of pins lying around.  It wasn't safe.
Three heads peeked around the door shamefully, and Tony tried to wipe away the flowing tears, but Steve caught his hand and kissed it.
“Oh. Yeah, Édesem… I really like the sound of that.” He couldn’t help but feel incredibly proud as he watched Steve flush and refocus on his food. “You can buy all my underwear if you want to. I’ll wear it every day. We could start that on New Year’s. I could make a resolution to always be yours. I’m pretty sure I won’t have any trouble breaking that one.”
“Yes,” Tony answered simply, wishing he had an honorific to use.  He relaxed completely under Steve’s touches, breathing slowly and deeply as he felt Steve’s hands massaging him and Steve’s mouth kissing and touching him.  He rested his own hands on his shoulders, one moving to play with the hair at the base of Steve’s skull.  “I would love for you to mark me.”
Tony couldn't break eye contact, though he wanted to.  Steve's eyes were full of stubborn will and a touch of uncertainty as he spoke.  "Great," Tony forced himself to say.  "You can go back to Sharon then."
Steve took the helmet that looked eerily like Iron Man's from Tony's hands, placing it back on the desk.  "You need sleep," Steve said.  "And I'd like it if you went back to calling me Steve."
"The song wasn't wrong," Steve said, thinking back to the conversation he'd overheard between Tony and Rhodey.  A plan was forming slowly, but it'd only work if Tony agreed.  "Meeting your friends was great.  You've met a few of mine, and I think they liked you too.  You could come up and hang out with Thor and Jane, and Bruce should be back tomorrow.  Clint and Natasha will like getting to know you too when they get back.  I don't know Jane that well, but she seemed pretty swell."
It was dark now, the crystal on his wrist long since gone dead.  He knew vaguely that he should be hungry and that thirst would kill him before that.  He felt numb though, only the cold seeping through his bones reminding him he couldn't follow Steve yet.  He couldn't even feel Steve beneath him anymore, his fingers thick and ungainly as he groped blindly for Steve's horns.  He couldn't find them.
"I resent the implication in your tone, young lady," Tony said as Steve poorly stifled a laugh.  Traitor.  "You say that like it's a bad thing."
"It's over, Captain.  It is fitting a man from the future is the one to destroy a man out of time," Kang said, raising his hand.
Iron Man," Steve growled.  "I saw who was in the armor and you are definitely not him.  You're not going anywhere until I get some answers."
Natasha nodded.  "Latveria's defenses aren't anything to sneeze at.  Not something either of us can do without backup."
"It burns," Steve said.  "I should...  You need to leave.  Get to the gate.  Tony-"
~Fin~
"Damn right, I wasn't."  Rhodey glowered at the other Avengers, silently daring them to do anything about it.
Steve stopped growling and put his head close to the ground, removing his tail from Tony's torso.  Tony could feel the shame and embarrassment rolling off him like he was just waking up and still sleepily reacting to things.  The pose made Tony want to pet Steve and tell him it'd be okay.  Pain stopped him from acting on it though.
"The human, huh?" Sam said, and strangely enough Tony got the impression Steve was embarrassed as he helped Sam up.
"Easy to fix," Sharon said, her voice soft.   "I could do it all, no problem.  No reason to call a proper healer."
"What do you want?" Iron Man asked bluntly, arms crossed over his chest.
Susan swallowed.  Cap would be there if things didn't go according to plan.  Tony would be there in the suit with her.  It was a simple mission.
"So. Did. You," Iron Man said, pushing Steve's hand off.  "You knew they were going, didn't you?  If you had come to me, I could have told them not to go!  But you didn't."
Finally Steve pulled away.  He knew his flush was on full display without his shirt, but he was pleased to see he wasn't the only one sporting a touch of red.
"And what's the price?" Steve asked, growling softly.  "You had to have known it existed before you went looking for it.  If you could look for the spell before, why didn't you use it earlier?"
"No," Natasha replied, her voice only slightly petulant.  "But it would have been fun."
Tony nodded, wiping away the sweat from his brow.  Under her wings, it was only as bad as a desert, and he'd been in plenty of deserts before.  There was another dragon sitting on a dais, a deeper red than Peggy and also lacking horns.  Did the horns denote sex?  This dragon was also lacking a crest that he'd seen on the others.
"Hold on," Steve said.
Steve slowly relaxed enough that Tony could take a break from rubbing Steve's cheeks to wipe at his own eyes.  Those were Steve's feelings, not
Too bad the same couldn't be said for the pathetic state of his heart.
"Susan, stand down," Steve said, with none of the grief Tony expected to hear in his voice.  "It's okay.  We can let him go."
"It's amazing," Tony said, looking up at Steve with an open smile.
"Those are for Stark?" Fury said, frowning.  "Didn't realize he rated special treatment from Captain America."
Steve flushed, knowing that one had come directly from Iron Man.  He was torn between feeling betrayed that Iron Man would warn someone about that and feeling pleased that Iron Man had mentioned him to someone.  "Maybe a little," he admitted.  "But what I heard... Mr. Stark seems to be trying very hard, but none of us have really acknowledged that.  I'd like to try to fix that."
" Steve said, his eyes wide.  It was strange, seeing Steve with human tells instead of dragon ones.  Tony realized then how much he must have been broadcasting, because Steve was now looking guilty.  "Tony, that wasn't your fault."
Shame won over and Steve bit down the irritability that came with it. He really should have at least tried to pay enough attention so that he wouldn't be caught off guard. "Sorry," Steve said. "You started talking about mixing polymers, and I got a bit lost."
"Hazard of the job."
"He's faking," Tony said, answering the former, if not the one weighing heavier on Steve's mind.  "He's not-"
Tony didn't see any of that.
"Shh," Steve said, kissing the tears Tony couldn't stop with a desperation that felt
"Not a monster hydra.  It's a group of humans, top-side.  A very bad group," Tony said.  He shook his head, trying to clear his head.  None of these were good memories.  "They're the ones I'm trying to stop from finding this place."
Steve stared at the Black Panther in shock and betrayal.  "Not you too, T'Challa."
"What. Changes," Tony asked again, marching up to Steve and pressing on his chest.  "Because you are
real?  What if... What if it wasn't?  Could he get his hopes up?  He felt a hand rubbing his back, and Tony looked up to see Bruce smiling at him sadly.  He didn't dare look at Steve.  Because if he did...
"You guys looking for me?" Steve asked as he put the weight back on the bar.  His arms burned at the motion, making Steve wonder if he'd lost track of time again.
"Have either of you eaten?" Steve asked instead, deciding it was high time he stepped up if he was going to battle those feelings.
Steve grabbed his uniform and quickly stripped.  He didn't put on all of it, but the under armor Stark made for undercover missions would be useful.  Despite the lack of full uniform, he grabbed his shield, because he could use its comforting weight on his back right now.  "I'm good to go," he said, swinging the pack onto his back.
"You're pretty far away," Steve said.
-" Steve started to say.
"Tony..." Steve said, gentle reproof in his voice.  "We've done everything we can.  It's up to the kids now."
"I meant..."  Steve hesitated, but it seemed like Tony was going to make him say it.  "Take your helmet off.  Please?"
He lifted off, following the stairs.  They were suspended from the wall, which made Tony hesitant to trust the armor's weight on them, even if he did want to conserve some of the (non)magical fuel.  There were dark vines and what looked like tree branches along them that Tony didn't trust either.  They looked ominous, and plants that grew without any kind of light seemed like a bad sign.
It was near enough to leave Tony breathless, circuitry for lungs or not.  "You wouldn't dare," Steve spat, but he nodded a fraction, his codes wide open for Tony to sort through.  Like Steve was -
"And that's not why you're not sulking either," Clint said, soft enough that it was likely he meant not to be heard.  Steve heard it anyway and mentally added more strenuous exercises to Clint's training routine.  Captain America was above being petty.  Steve Rogers was not.
"NO!  Don't you dare!
"He didn't have to let me stay in the back for the whole flight if he knew," Steve muttered as he peered around to see an unarmed airman standing politely at the base of the ramp.  Steve sighed and rolled his neck, then stood and smiled ruefully.  "Guess the gig is up."
He held up a small device that didn't look like much.  Steve felt like time had stopped for him as well just looking at it.  If what Doom was saying were true, this could save Tony!  His moment of shock having passed, he reached out for it, but Doom held it back.  "You-"
"Take it easy, man.  You nearly died out there," Sam said, then looked to Steve.  "Same goes to you, though your wounds weren't as bad.  That's twice we've had to do some intensive healing on you and even you can't bounce back from that.  The others got this."
Ms. Potts laughed.  It was a nice sound, and he got the feeling she didn't laugh enough as it was.  "I'll take your word on that.  The word of Captain America must mean something, right?"  She stood and offered her hand.  "It was a pleasure meeting you, Captain.  You're right that Mr. Stark is busy, but I'll see if I can slip you in next week."
"I..." Iron Man said, trailing off.  "Trying to track those robots, mostly.  I should be getting back to-"
The photo he got of Lila holding the two drawings a month later was definitely worth Clint grousing about how the kids would never give him peace after that.
"Just... woke up," Susan said, not being able to explain it more than that.
"Carol is going to save me from the mind control through the power of female friendship," Jan said, raising her hand.  Carol high-fived her.  "But ooooh, my muse is speaking to me now.  Tony, stop production!  I need to redesign."
She thrust the drawing at Steve, who looked down at it automatically.
"Guess that's true," Rhodey said quietly, realizing he'd touched on something deeper.  "I heard you found out about Iron Man."
Tony closed his eyes and took a deep breath.  This wasn't a dream.  Or if it was, it was a nice one.
"I do," Cobra said, glaring at Tony.
It was a very satisfying thump.  Tony only just heard it over the resumed gunfire and yelling, but he amped up the suit's speakers to hear it.  He could also hear Steve calling his name, but metal in his suit was still bent inward and choking him.  He wondered if he would also make a satisfying thump when he hit the ground.  He had about thirty seconds to find out before his legs collapsed or he passed out.
Natasha's eyes narrowed at him, and he hoped the phone wouldn't show how his ears were burning.  "Don't tell me you've fallen in love with Stark too."
?  I can list the number of people who do on one hand and one of those actively tried to kill me.  So if you're looking for Iron Man, he's not here anymore.  Find someone else to ride off into the sunset with, old man.  You'll be happier for it."
"You were badly hurt," Peggy said.  "You and Steve... After Bucky's death he was like this.  I don't think he can go through that again.  Just talk to him and let him know you're alright.  He's all instinct now."
"I'm not leaving you, damn it!" Tony shouted.  "Now don't be an idiot and help me put pressure on the wound."
"That was a turn-on?" Tony asked.
He cursed as the ground moved again, thrusters catching him before he fell.  He flew back and gave a small yelp as he tried to stabilize.  His arm hit the edge of the platform painfully, but it righted him and he could finally see to fire.  Four, no,
Tony jumped, the knife slipping through his fingers.  Steve wasn't entirely sure how it happened, but suddenly there was blood on the cutting board and Tony was swearing.
"It'll be good to see him dancing again," Sharon said, her wings fluttering in excitement and hope.
"Are you certain this is wise, my friend?" Thor asked, his voice grave.  "I know you and Iron Man have argued of late, but this is a line you may not be able to come back from."
"Pizza!" Jane said triumphantly.
"It muffles you," Peggy said, sounding skeptical.
"Talk to Stark," Natasha said as she stood.  "You still might be able to get him to open up."
Stark stared at him, his face unreadable.  But he stopped trying to pull away, and Steve could feel the pulse in his wrist beating fast.  "Please," Steve pleaded, knowing this would only work if Stark gave him a chance to change.  "What was the favor?"
"Tony-"

This time Natasha did look up, raising an eyebrow as she caught Steve's eye.  He shrugged in return and she moved on to looking Tony over.  Steve could see the mental categorizing in her eyes for a split second before it shut down into a more neutral expression.  "That so?" Natasha said, putting the book down but giving no other indication of what she had planned to do about the strain in Tony's shoulders, if anything at all.
The sacrifice was too high.  "I can't..."
"Who?" Susan asked.
"I made the face plate to flip up for a reason," Tony said.  "I've used it before to eat, so I can...  It'll work, I guess."
Tony.  Steve didn't look up, because he wasn't sure his eyes were dry.  He also didn't trust his voice.  But Tony sounded rattled, so Steve nodded.
* * *
"You are
"Indeed, Dr. Foster," JARVIS said, his voice small and tinny through the phone's speakers.  JARVIS was a part of the team like the others, and it relieved something inside of Steve to hear his voice again.  "While most of the Tower is  blocking me off, I am quickly regaining control.  If you'll watch the screen, you should see the cause."
"You do," Susan said, looking up angrily from her tears.  "And don't call me that."
"I'm not blaming you for that.  You're a civilian," Steve said.
"I'm sorry," Kestrel said as they came into the room properly.  "I shouldn't have-"
Tony just stared at him as the microwave worked, blinking at him like an experiment that took a completely unpredictable turn and he couldn't figure out where his hypothesis had gone wrong.  Steve tried not to feel self-conscious, but he still felt small as he reached for the now heated coffee, pushing his shoulders back out of habit even when they wanted to hunch over.
Four had already been found and taken care of, but Tony was nothing if not paranoid.
"I told you, I can't tell you anything," Tony said, anger leaving him, his voice dull.  "If you're going to yell at me in lieu of Iron Man, you can just leave.  I have work to do."
Steve stared at the plans, committing them to memory as much as he could.  "I'll leave the cookies here," he said awkwardly, leaving Tony to his work.
Steve winced, but sat down.  "I look that bad?" he asked, and winced again when his voice came out hoarse.  He gestured to the seat in front of his desk and Ms. Potts sat down gracefully.
I knew you were Iron Man, Tony.  It was
talking exactly, but that was harder to explain.
, not thinking."
"I was scared," Steve admitted, his tail reaching back towards Tony before it stopped and curled around Steve miserably.
"Because I like it when Tony is happy," Rhodey said, his shoulders slumping.  "Which isn't that often lately.  He was happy when he and Pepper were together, happier than I've seen him in a while.  But now that they've broken up..."
"It's not impossible that they're keeping her under the radar, but more than likely," Tony said.  "You okay with that?"
"He's sentimental," Natasha said, though it didn't sound like she disapproved.  "You didn't let him talk?"
"A sacrifice could mitigate the damage, but the cost will be high," she said ever cryptically.
"It's not a threat," Rhodey replied.  "It's a fact.  SHIELD has been keeping quiet about who was attacking at Iron Man's request.  And I don't think you want a government sanctioned Avengers attack on Latveria because Doombots have been attacking military bases."
Tony was also vulnerable though, soft and caring when he let his defenses down.  It attracted Steve more than he realized, calling out his need to protect.  Iron Man in a lot of ways was untouchable, but Tony was very real, if completely out of Steve's league.  Tony was clever and looked out for his friends if what Steve had seen was anything to go by.  It was getting harder and harder
Tony stopped, even when Steve tried pulling him forward.  He stared ahead, not looking at Steve.  He clenched his hands into fists and closed his eyes.
Steve tightened his grip on his shield and held out a few seconds longer.  Then he stepped aside, but kept his shield ready if Doom should go back on his word.  Doom walked forward, placing the device on Tony's arc reactor.  He saw Rhodey grip the sides of his chair and it got Steve's hackles up as well, seeing someone so close to the reactor.  He hadn't even known it was in Tony's chest before the fight with Kang, but now he wanted to keep anyone from touching it.
"It is important.  I'll be down to see him in a bit, thanks."  He had to go in prepared.  Perhaps he should hold off, though.  Tony had been trying, but Steve kept pushing him too hard.  If this was one of those times...  But there wasn't much choice.  This might be his only opportunity.  He raided the pantry for some cookies and a couple of coffees, then headed down.
"I'll disconnect if there's any virus," Tony lied.  "You get back to the twins.  You've got to get them out of here."
"Please," Steve asked.
Tony closed off again, and this time Steve could easily see it in the way his shoulders hunched over.  "Well, I've got a meeting with Monica to prepare for, so I'll-"
Steve caught Iron Man's - Tony's wrists before he pulled too far away.  "Could you sit with me a bit?" Steve asked, the adrenaline spike from hearing Iron Man's voice waning to the point where he kind of wanted to go back to his nap - he really
"Um, hi," Susan said awkwardly, gaining a soft laugh from Tony.  "We're, uh..."
"Long day?" Steve asked as he walked in the kitchen.
.  Tony fell back, dropping the gauntlet as Sharon's shriek echoed through all of the dragons.  He could feel Steve reaching out to her, but all that came back was pure berserker rage and Peggy's name.
He apparently shifted a little too much, because suddenly his hand was cold and he was staring at the hand print on Rhodey's face and trying not to laugh as the other man yawned.
Tony couldn't have said what it was, either Steve's eyes or the line of his wings, but something made Tony think that the dragon was affronted, and Tony had to stifle a laugh.  "That is not my name," Steve said with a definite pout.
"I'm sorry," Steve said again, swallowing down his unwillingness to back down from the fight.  It went against everything in his nature, but he wasn't going to let this break them apart.
He was going to keep that promise to Tony.  They just had to figure out how.
* * *
"Were Steve and Bucky bonded?"
timing sucked."  Which, for the record, Tony's timing was always good.  Especially in bed.
"Oh, come on, Cap," Carol said.  "They do it all the time to sell comics.  Just last week they gave 'Antonio' a silver armor and turned him evil in the Steel Man comics."
He hadn't planned on following through, but Sam's crossed arms and unimpressed look got his hackles up.
"Not if you neutralize it with-"
Given how much Stark had been drinking, Steve was surprised the man was so deft with his keys getting in.  Steve almost always had to open the door for him, usually having to check Tony's pockets for the keys.  "Thought you were drunk," Steve muttered.
"Yeah, I'm sure that's all," Tony said, his voice bitter.
Tony wished he had demanded a tablet, because now he had nothing to keep his attention or to keep  his hands occupied.  He could only stare at the burn marks on his hands and be grateful that they weren't too bad.
They sat quietly for a while.  Fury watched people pass by as Steve continued his drawing.  It was a small park, but sometimes Steve liked to get away from the Avengers' compound.  Fury would get to his reason for being here soon enough, and it was a nice day.
"I didn't..."  There was a hint of pink about Tony's cheeks that caught Steve's interest.  Tony Stark was a very attractive man, make no mistake about that.  Though the blush caught Steve off guard in a way he hadn't expected.  But the last thing he needed was what Clint called a 'rebound', so he put it from his mind.
a disappointment," Steve said, repeating Tony's dragon name-feeling.  There was anger in his tone, but it was directed inward, not at Tony.  "I just...  It's different.  Not a bad different.  Just one I need to get used to.  Tony...  I'm glad this happened.  I really am."
He had to admit he'd been glad he ran into Natasha when he'd been looking for Clint on advice on what to wear for a 'not-date, not-business' meeting.  Due to the civilians and partners of varying experience she's worked with in the past, plus quick getaways and identity changes of her own, she knew a lot about clothes for both sexes.  Clint was practical.  She was right in the fact he did want to look good.
"I believe, Sir, that the picture comes from that night in Monte Carlo with-"
"Is that what this is about?" Steve asked, temper getting the better of him.  "Your pride at failing?"
I'll end with some Churchill, because the War was a rather big part of this fic.
"Why?" Steve asked, feeling way out of his depth.  "I can understand that Howard could be a sore topic, but why would he start a fight and push me away?"
Tony stayed quiet, letting Steve talk.  Steve was obviously close to both Sam and Peggy (and apparently a little sweet on the latter at one time), but this sounded deeper.  Relationships in dragon society weren't valued on type as far as Tony could tell from the stories.  Humans valued romantic love, family, and friendship, whereas dragons valued depth and time.  'Bucky' seemed to have the strongest connection to Steve that Tony had ever seen.
