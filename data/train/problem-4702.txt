Cas had also prayed to Gabriel, but unsurprisingly the archangel didn’t answer. They both chose to understand the radio silence as either the archangel being too busy with his questionable side projects or him not being able to help with this as well and not having a spell to give them right away, preferring to just not waste his precious time with a visit to simply tell them he couldn’t help. Dean wasn’t sure which of those made him more uneasy.
being given what his body truly wanted. For a moment, the entire world seemed fade around him, turning into nothing more than a meaningless blur of colors and empty background noise.
And before he could react, before he could try to do anything about it, Dean felt Meg’s hand gripping the back of his head, tightening around a big tuff of hair it found there. She pushed his head forward, and while the hunter did tense up in order to try and fight the movement, he wasn’t strong enough to stop it completely.
that. Really, this one's pretty much an emotional roller coaster, and I'm not even sorry about it. I'm kinda proud, really.
of fun, by the way—but he still needed to make sure the cuts were clean. The last thing he needed right now was to have them get infected.
He’d broken in the end and told Sam about what had happened down there, but he’d never told his brother everything, not about the flashbacks or the nightmares that had haunted him for months after coming back to Earth, although he was pretty sure Sam must have noticed something had been wrong with him.
to talk, wanted to share more, wanted to get this freaking weight off his chest.
Tamiel lifted his sword once he was done with his little speech, clearly intent on driving the weapon right into Dean’s chest and through the hunter’s heart. Dean tensed up even more, muscles ready to try and roll out of the way of that blade in an attempt to save himself and his baby, but he knew his chances of actually managing to do that were rather low. His heart jumped inside his chest as Tamiel’s sword began to descend toward him, and he lifted his arms in front of his body, even if he knew that wouldn’t do much to help. All Dean could think about in the seconds that followed, as his heart hammered wildly inside his chest and his eyes widened in panic, was his baby, and how he’d failed them by bringing them here.
“I’ll just think about my Dad—not the father he was before my Mom died, but… everything that came after, everything… everything he did wrong by me and Sam.”
So in the end, he simply nodded, letting out a heavy, frustrated sigh, because he knew there was just no point in arguing with Hannah about this, especially not when Gabriel was actually on her side.
Going down to the morgue to see the bodies had been a true nightmare. The entire fucking hospital smelled of blood, the scent so strong and heavy in the air that Dean was barely even able to pay attention to anything anyone said to him while he was there. He couldn’t even recall whom exactly he’d talked to, either, and he’d left in a hurry, before he did something he would regret, hands shaking and heart beating wildly inside his chest as he'd stumbled his way out the door and over to his car.
them as often as he possibly could.
Dean still wasn't sure why Castiel looked so spooked, but he still replied, "That maybe you should try to look for other hybrids? And that maybe
He was a good angel, he cared about humanity greatly, and I couldn’t understand why he would rebel against Heaven that way. I thought what we were doing was right because those had been Heaven’s orders, and I didn’t even question it. And I know his case must have been like the others, even Gabriel said that Dean and I are the first ones to conceive naturally, but still, I wonder… The child had no fault, as did the woman, and still, I couldn’t even—”
Sleep took a while to come for Dean, but it did come easier than he’d expected. His eyelids started drooping after a while, his mind growing foggy and muddled, and he had a feeling Cas must have had something to do with it, for the sudden calm that had washed over him, wrapping him up cozily, warm and soft like a big, fluffy blanket, until it finally managed to pull him under.
“Where am I?” Dean growled out, hating how much weaker than he’d intended his voice sounded. His throat was scratchy and dry, and you could hear it way too clearly in his voice just how much speaking at all hurt with the way his voice broke more than once. He hated it. That wasn't enough to stop him, though. “And what the hell did you do to me?”
I want to apologize in advance if there is anything wrong in the technical terms and everything else concerning Dean's pregnancy mentioned in this chapter. Once more, all information presented in this story comes solely from research, and I'm sorry if anything is incorrect or inaccurate.
“They might not even be here anymore.”
happened—Dean didn’t do any of that. He didn't snap, didn't start yelling at the top of his lungs. He didn't even
“Do you know where we are?” he asked.
“Let’s clean up this fucking mess.”
Dean shook his head. Seriously? Did he really need to ask Dean that?
“Yeah, sounds like it,” Dean agreed, yet again nodding lightly to no one, “You’re thinking what, demon possession?”
The corner of Cas’ mouth quirked up to form the tiniest of smiles, but that smile was gone as soon as it’d come, vanishing completely in just the blink of an eye.
Cas shook his head. “Not if those effects start fading soon. Gabriel believes they should linger for an hour or two after you woke up.”
The hunter chuckled at the scene, and when he glanced at Cas, he found the angel smiling fondly at Juliet. They simply watched her play with her toy for a minute, until Dean broke the silence.
This time, Dean scoffed, shaking his head. “Yeah, well, it sure as hell seems like you do. You’re certainly acting like it.”
A pained, anguished scream suddenly filled the air—the ugly, bone-chilling kind of scream of someone who was suffering through a great deal of pain. The hunter’s steps halted as soon as the sound reached his ears, and for a beat, all that he could do was just stand there, frozen in place, because the moment he heard it, he knew exactly who was screaming. He would recognize that voice anywhere.

“Yeah, but I still don’t know what the deadline is exactly,” Dean pointed out, a spark of annoyance coming to life inside of him. “You never actually told me that, remember? I kinda figured out on my own that I couldn’t get
same people.
It was an oak tree, just as Anael’s had been. It was big, imposing, and clearly it would not have reached its size under normal circumstances, not in two years. But it had angelic Grace to feed on, to drain, and as Grace was energy in its pure form, uncontrolled creation shaping its surroundings as it pleased, this had been possible.
too much pain to try to figure out where they'd gone.
Deciding that the hair situation would have to wait at least a little while, Dean carefully pushed himself up to his feet, once more silently apologizing to Cas for making him go through this, leaning down to press a short kiss to the angel’s forehead. Only then did he manage to actually step away from Cas and walk over to where their bags lay on the floor, even if they were merely a few steps away. And even that short, seemingly small distance felt like too much right now. He couldn’t tell if he was being paranoid or not, but he could swear he felt the Mark burning more with every step he took; with every inch that was added between him and Cas, just as he could feel how the strain on the bond grew even stronger, like a rubber band stretching.
what was happening here right now, let alone decide how much information he should be sharing with the guy.
“And as for your other questions,” Rowena piped up before Castiel could comment, “Well, you’re a hybrid, so you’re not
Dean frowned down at the paper, rereading the note a few times before handing it to Charlie.
“Well, firstly, for billions of years it was believed that angels could not procreate. We just never learned differently; there had never been the need to learn differently, anyway. Back then, those… bold enough to endure in sexual intercourse with other angels never ended up conceiving, so it was believed we could not procreate at all, and we never questioned that notion. It was only after Father left Heaven thousands of years ago and our numbers began to drop that it became clear angels would grow extinct if we could not procreate, since before then it was our Father who created all angels. So we had to find a way to balance the losses of Heaven's battles somehow.”
The smirk that followed those words had Dean frowning in confusion. "How the hell could it be appropriate?"
thing keeping
That was, until the bond started hurting again, that same sharp, horrible pain from earlier deciding to make itself known once again. His entire world went black for a second, and when Dean came to again, he was leaning against the wall for support, one hand pressed against his chest, his legs feeling oddly unstable, and he had no idea how he hadn't fallen to the floor.
The motel wasn’t far from the hospital, which Dean was very much happy for. It was pretty late, around 4 o’clock in the morning, so there was no one around to watch him carry an unconscious angel bridal style into one of the rooms. Unlocking to the door of the room while carefully balancing Cas in his arms had been another challenge, but he managed.
Castiel did not look at the human as he said it, and yet immediately the angel knew the hunter wanted to argue in the brief silence that followed. Fortunately, however, he didn’t, and quickly Sam backed up the car, slowly sliding it out of its parking spot, before gearing the vehicle into drive and speeding away from the store while Cas silently hoped that he could keep the cloak up until they were out of the town boundaries and close enough to the cabin so that the Stynes would not be able to follow them, but he knew he would have to drop it earlier than he wished to if it became too much for him or in any way possibly harmful to Dean and the baby.
The food was pretty good, too.
look that Dean had been on the receiving end of way too many times during the past couple of weeks—had that same uneasiness he was getting awfully familiar with quickly making itself known in his gut.
“You need to rest, Dean,” Sam pointed out, voice low and gentle.
What if… what if Gabriel
Dean pressed his lips together and into a thin line, then took a careful sip from his whiskey as he tried to decide how much exactly he wanted to tell this guy.
. And if he did that regularly, if he took too much, he might end up killing people anyway, even if indirectly. And two—he wasn't even sure how he was supposed to do it in the first place. He didn't think he could actually manage to do steal something from a hospital without getting caught, especially something like blood bags, and that was a risk he just wasn't willing to take, for the same reasons why he'd decided against turning himself in back in Casper.
“Seriously, though, what is it?” Dean pressed. “What's Gabriel's theory? How did Eldon track us down?’’
Whatever.
How the hell did Meg do that? How did she—
And that meant that Dean ended up spending several minutes just standing there under that warm spray of water, countless thoughts running through his head, far too many emotions swirling around in his gut for him to even process them all—guilt, fear, sadness, anger, nervous anticipation; the list was far too long for him to name every single one. Not even the perfect water pressure seemed to be enough to wash away the tension from his muscles, to allow him to relax even a little bit, much less make him forget about his problems, about what had happened back in his room, not even for just a little while.
The words came out low, feeble, nothing more than a small, trembling whisper. They sounded weird, too, strained, like Cas barely had the strength in him to let them out in the first place, like he could barely even force that handful of syllables past his lips.
“You have to.” Dean leaned away then, so he could give Cas a reprimanding look, “You can’t just not sleep anymore, Cas, not in your current state.”

“Fuck,” he whispered through his clenched teeth, his fists closed at his sides.
"Will they be like this?" he asked, the words coming out breathed out and rushed, a hint of plea clear in his trembling voice. "Cas, will their wings...?" Fuck, he couldn't even
What a great day to take your daughter to work, right?
Fuck, Dean didn’t want to deal with this. He really,
until their heart eventually gave out and they finally stopped breathing. So if Rowena's cure is a combination of both of those, then why would the outcome be any different here? Not to mention that every single person
Sam swallowed drily at the sight. They should leave now, he was very much aware of that. They had already pushed their luck enough for one night;
Dean huffed. "Yeah, but you're not actually
Sam, on the other hand, didn't seem to agree with her careful approach. He shook his head at Dean, eyes growing wider all of a sudden, disbelief quickly bleeding into his features. He actually sounded like he couldn't quite believe what he'd just heard as he said, “Dean, you can't be serious. I don’t think you should—”
knew them? That just didn’t seem fair, and honestly, it might actually do more harm than good. Jacques would definitely not trust him again after something like that.
fucking good.
He shot up, ignoring how much it hurt to move so fast, like his muscles might actually rip apart because of it, and for just a second he registered that he was lying on a couch and that there was something draped over him, but he paid very little attention to those facts because yeah, he really was about to puke out his intestines. So he just tossed whatever covers had been placed over him aside and turned his body, swinging his legs around and over the edge of the couch until his feet touched the floor so he could stand up.
This wasn’t the right time for it, Dean realized, nor the right place. Bringing this up
“Jody, I know nothing I say to you will instantly send all of your worries away,” he said, keeping his voice calm and gentle, hoping the woman could hear the honesty in his tone, that she could sense the truth in his words. “And I know there’s nothing I can do to erase all the things I’ve done in the past. I know I’ve made mistakes—a lot of them, in fact. I’ve made wrong choices. I’ve put my trust on the wrong people. And I’ve hurt them, too—Sam and Dean. But I can’t take any of that back.
Just as Sam had expected, Cas’ face grew much more serious, a frown taking over his brows. He looked almost disappointed. “What problems?”
The quote,
He did it. He sent it. He

got him back.”
Cas felt the grip on him loosen until it was gone. Leaving him to slide down until he was back on his hands and knees, coughing up blood and breathing in the air he so desperately needed.
I rewrote this chapter a few times cause I kept thinking it's to dialogue but they need to use their damn words! There was no way around it. They needed to use their words so too much dialogue it is!
Dean pulled at Cas’s shoulders to bring him into a tight hug, honestly not sure if he could handle saying these words out loud with Cas’s baby blues staring at him with so much awe.
“He doesn’t hate you, Dean. That’s the problem. He loves you.”
Dean falls back against the couch again as his hands start to tingle, so he squeezes his fist a little. As if he had an invisible stress ball in his palm.
“What happened?” Dean asked as they try to stand him up from his bedroom floor.
“No.” Dean looks back at Jack, seeing the little face frown at him. “How about you go bother your Dad. You know he’s probably doing that hippie meditating thing, but he’s actually-”
“Fuck.” Dean groans as Cas’s fingers touch his skin. Burning his flesh as they explored under his shirt and dug into his back. “Can’t Cas.”
"I'll call another hunter to take care of this and we'll leave in the morning," Dean reassures him in a soft tone. He didn't sound annoyed or like he pitted Cas but more matter of fact.
Then the vows came and Cas actually had to pay attention to repeat the words correctly and then listened to Dean repeat the same thing. Then it was the rings and I do's. He half expected Dean to have run away but he was still grinning as he put the golden ring around his finger.
“I love you.” Dean whispered into the room as he laid on his back and Cas was falling back asleep with his head on Dean’s shoulder.
He pushed the dumpster lid open to get some light but found the night sky welcoming him instead. He liked the nights a little more, but today there was no moon out to help him see. So he relied on touch and hoped the duffle was just thrown in here with him.
At that moment, Dean wanted to lean in and kiss him more than he has wanted to kiss anyone in his 26 years of life, but he won’t. He still wasn’t sure if this was Cas asking him out as a friend or as something more. He was scared, but he knew his heart raced in excitement more than anything.
He felt Cas’s full-body shiver as his arms tighten around Dean. “So ‘I miss you’ kisses are acceptable?”
“Fuck.” Dean scrubbed his hand down his face, wiping tears as he went.
Well, I hope you all would have a good New Year and that you stay safe. I'm sure Dean and Cas are somewhere ringing in the New Year with their family in the bunker :)
And that’s how Jack ended up sleeping on Cas’s side of the bed while Dean sat against the headboard, reading from Charlie’s old copy of The Hobbit.
“Cas! The music...make it stop.” Dean grumbled as he got out of bed and putting on his robe as he was still half asleep. It wasn’t until he realized that he was dragging his feet on clean carpet that he realized he wasn’t in his bedroom. He rubbed on his eyes and counted to three thinking this room will disappear when he opens his eyes again. But that didn’t work. “Son of bitch.”
“Is this okay?”
"Jess is coming down today and will arrive just in time for the wedding. Dad's taking a shower and Bobby's coming by soon with our suits."
Cas looks down as Dean moves a little closer dropping the blanket Cas had put on Dean’s shoulders. Cas fixed the blanket with his free hand before he answered.
.’ His mind kept echoing his name, maybe he was even saying it out loud because by the time Dean got to his side Cas was already stirring awake.
“Dean.”
"I know but I meant like you guys don't like a kiss or hold hands."
“Okay, Rowena is on her way,” Sam announces to the room but keeps Jack under his arm.
“It’s okay.” Dean groaned as he sat down on the cold floor. She quickly sat between his legs and leaned into him, letting Dean just hide his face in her fur. He felt the warming buzz of grace comforting him against his chest. “It’s okay. We’re okay.”
He let go of his son’s face and instead decided to pick him up and carry him in his arms for a while. It’s only been a week of having Jack like this, but holding him really made Dean feel like his kid wasn’t going to disappear. He held Jack against his side with one arm while he pushed the cart with his other hand. It made it harder for himself, but he also had Jack’s head lying on his shoulder, and that was worth bumping into a few people.
Cas slowly walked Dean to the garage, shoulders bumping the whole quiet walk over before they stopped in front of the driver-side door.
“I...I’m sorry. I can’t. I just-” He pulls away from Dean’s grasp and takes a step back. His face looked red, guilt clearly written across his forehead. He pulled his left glove off and then held his hand out for Dean to see. A ring rested on his left hand. “I’m sort of engaged.”
He felt a kiss at the back of his neck as the foreign arms wrapped around his middle to pull him in close. Cas pushed himself up to sit at the edge of the bed and away from the stranger’s grasp. Not wanting to be touched anymore.
"I think I may kill myself but I figured, if a monster kills me then it'll be easier." Cas doesn't look up at Dean as he talks, safer to stare at a stain in the carpet from between his fingers.
“Jack, it’s-”
“Night.” Dean closed his eyes and relaxed into the touch, his hand reaching to cover Cas’s own for a second before they pulled back. Back to their sides.
“I think I’m happy today too.” Cas beamed at him, and for the first time in a long time, Dean believed him.
“Thanks. Call me tomorrow, and I’ll work for you this weekend!” Dean starts walking backward, back to Cas.
This fic is almost over! There is one last chapter left! I know it says 9 chapters will be posted but chapter 9 is just a little extra side piece lol So tomorrow's chapter is the last one! Technically. Kind of.
Jack calmed Cas enough for Amara to show up again. She only gave them an apologetic smile before she continued the work.
Dean had to look up at him to see if he could read his expression but of course, he was straight-faced, maybe looked more lost than mad or hurt. He was worried that he would think Dean took advantage of him in that situation and hoped he could explain himself better but Dean knew those words are never getting out. Not any time soon anyway.
“Stay with us, Dean! Stay!” He could hear the three of them yelling again and again making it hard to sleep to concentrate on what the real Sam and Cas are saying to him. He has to wake up and go to them. He will not leave them alone. He wants to go home. His real home.
“I didn’t think you’d go through with it!”
Dean got up, grabbing a jacket and some shoes that fit, and walked out the bedroom and down the stairs hoping he can leave unseen. This just has to be some weird dream that is too vivid and...fuck he can smell bacon.
“Kiss?” He heard a quiet whisper.
I can tell by the comments on the last chapter that you all LOVED Mick haha! Thank you so much for your comments omg your theories omg I loved it so much and enjoyed reading them! You guys have real good ideas and it takes me a while to answer them cause I keep trying not to give anything away haha
Dean shrugs. “Potential customers then.” Dean grabs another napkin and reaches to wipe the tears that were already falling. “Estas bien, Angelito. Talk to me.”
“Fuck. Finally. Kiss.” Cas turns Dean’s around and with his damn stupid strength picks Dean up and sits him down in an empty morgue bed. Kissing him harder than before as he forced his tongue in Dean’s mouth and Dean could only wrap his arms around Cas’s shoulder to pull him closer. Letting himself be manhandled by the angel and loving every second of it.
Dean frowns.
Cas hesitates, before replying, “I could rip out my grace, and cut off my wings so that we could still be bonded even when the angels inevitably cast me out.”
Dean smirks as he grabs a pen and starts signing. Castiel’s had a stick up his ass since the first day he came to work at Sandover, and it was way too easy to rile him up.
There’s nothing here.
“In a minute,” he says loudly.

,” he bites out, “These papers are for you. Adler wants them done by Monday.”
“It should have. You guessed correctly.”
“Do I?” Dean says. His mind’s feeling kind of fuzzy right now. He’s not entirely sure if he’s met Balthazar before, but he decides to take her word for it.
beating him to the punch.
Sometimes, when Sam sends him snide texts asking for updates about his marital status, he contemplates deleting his number altogether, if he wasn’t one thousand percent sure that Sam would recruit Charlie to find a different way to harass him.
No one replies. His voice echoes across the chamber.
“Will he ever regain his sight?”
Dean shrugs. Fiddles with the hem of his dress shirt.
“Hopefully,” Cas nods against Dean’s chest.
“So… what’s with the welcoming crew?” Dean nods at the ten or so angels flanking him, blades in hand. For fuck’s sake, he was already handcuffed.
Dean wraps an arm around Cas, and clutches him tightly. He’s shaking all over, adrenaline leaving his system in a rush, leaving him cold and disoriented.
” Cas stresses.
For one, it looked much more… clinical. Impersonal. Removed.
“So,” Dean waves at the coffee weakly, “Here. Take it. Have a nice day.”
“Look, they already love you. That’s not gonna change, even if this doesn’t go perfectly, okay?”
“In a week or so, yes. Don’t worry about it, Castiel.”
“Dean?” he hears someone say. It’s someone he recognizes, but the voice grates on his nerves. He doesn’t seem to like that person.
The fog machines in the corner start going crazy and Dean coughs as it covers him.
find me lurking on
The guy’s covered in chains. His wings aren’t pinned, but the way he’s shackled to the walls can’t be comfortable either, with the cuffs surrounding his back. His eyes widen when Dean and Balthazar walk in.
Dean stares at Cas. “Okay,” he says, “That is
“I think so.”
It happens during their weekly movie night.
“It’s gonna be fine, okay?”
“—No. No. I heard you clearly the first time. I was just surprised you would actually have the balls to ask me out,” he scoffs.
He knocks on the door softly. If Cas is doing his work, or resting, he doesn’t want to bother him.
‘I know what you did,’ he whispers conspiratorially.
Dean lifts him up, and presses him to the wall.
His stomach lurches into his throat.
“You may leave,” she waves toward the guards. They step out of the room.
Balthazar takes one look at Dean before he turns to stare at the ceiling and mutters a curse.
Uriel’s mouth presses together and he looks at the sky. “Yes. We are still, as you say, ‘up’ for Friday.”
Dean snorts. “Buddy, you’ve got a few screws knocked loose. But hey, that ain’t a surprise, is it?”
“I’m Balthazar. I know you.”
“Stay with me,” Cas says. He grips Dean’s arms tightly as they walk around the room.
Cas dips the fries into the ketchup and takes a big bite, shoving three or four fries into his mouth at once. Dean thinks that he’d be pretty content to just watch Cas for the rest of eternity.
Cas throws him a dirty look. “The only reason you’re so calm about this is because you’ve already gotten blessings to marry me from
Granted, he can’t see very much. Everything’s mostly just blobs of color.
The portal shimmers behind them and Dean turns around. It shatters, the dark pieces littering the floor, the only color there besides him and Cas.
“Dude,” Dean says, “Middle schoolers aren’t the only ones who can appreciate a good movie date, okay?”
“Look, Cas,” Dean sighs. “I know you just want me to be careful.”
me the entire time, I’d’ve cancelled this meet-up a long time ago.”
The ring in the sock drawer had weighed on Dean’s conscience for over a month.
was that a wanda/vision reference?
“Nope,” Dean says flippantly, and turns to Baltha — Naomi? Doesn’t matter. “Do you have the keys?”
“Do we have any other choice?”
Dean stands up, and faces the three doors.
“Mmm,” Bobby says.
It wasn’t awkward, or fumbly. There weren't any nerves on both parts. It was just him and Cas. Nothing more, nothing less. They just were.
He hears the stomps echoing through their house as he makes his way to the sofa, clutching his head.
Dean smiles weakly as he surreptitiously wipes his sweaty hands on his pants.
“Want to see a movie with me?”
Someone knocks on the door to his office. He groans.
“Did it work?” Dean whispers, cupping Cas’s face with one hand. He feels Cas nod.
Cas actually flinches, and Dean feels a stab of remorse. He runs his hand over his face.
Dean gulps and drops down onto one knee. “Marry me,” he repeats, and brings out the ring box.
Kick. The man grunts, and heaves a few breaths. His black hair is matted with blood but his eyes are so, so blue.
“Heaven has allowed you back into our ranks. We have a task for you.”
of all places.
VINCIT OMNIA VERITAS
“What, a guy can’t walk in to say 'hi' to his coworker?”
He tried yet again, at the Roadhouse, but then Lisa walked in, and even though he and Lisa had a rather amicable breakup all things considered, things were still pretty awkward even without Cas smoldering at her from halfway across the room.
Dean frowns. “Who t’fuck’s Castiel?”
“Was that seriously the climax?” Dean asks.
He can see.
“What were you thinking?”
For four days, Dean is blind.
And then he looks at Cas.
He walks to his office and pushes the door open. He sets his briefcase down, and looks up.
“Oh no! Not the scary one,” Dean gasps, his eyes widening and his hands flying to his chest.
“Anna
He’s pretty sure he’s floating.
He can see Cas’s grin through the window.
He sits on the sofa, and wraps an arm around Cas. “Just relax, okay? We’ve got everything under control.”
(yes)
“To create the bond. Unless if I’m mistaken, that’s what you came here for, right?" She waves her hands, and chants something in Enochian. "There. The bond will form in a few days."
Dean gets up, and makes to open the door, but even before he can yell ‘in a moment’, Cas already has the door open, and is welcoming Bobby inside.
“It’s…” Balthazar slowly blows out a breath. “It’s complicated. It’s probably nothing. Congratulations. Truly.”
“What are you doing?” Cas hisses.
“Cas,” he whispers.
“A what?” Dean asks.
But, on the fifth day, Dean wakes up. At first, he’s not entirely sure why he’s awake. Cas is still dead to the world, and clutching Dean like an octopus, his wings draped over him, fuzzy and warm like a second blanket.
“No,” the guy says slowly, “That’s Naomi. Balthazar’s wings look like falcon wings. Actually, Naomi’s the only angel with swan wings. But you know that.”
“Cool. See you then,” he says, smiling. Uriel doesn’t say anything else, but adjusts his tie and quickly walks back in the opposite direction.
"Asshat," Dean spits. Ishim barely reacts, but Dean can clearly see the smug upturn of his lips, the puffing of his tawny feathers. Dean sneers at him.
Of course, it’s a small price to pay for being able to love and marry Cas without any repercussions.
Biting his lips, Cas replies, “I don’t mind sacrificing some things to be with you.”
“I’m your secretary, not your maid.”
“I was
“It doesn’t have to be perfect man. It’s not gonna change anything,” Dean says again, moving his hands up to muss up Cas’s hair.
“Come in,” he yells.
“It’s… just an empty doorway,” Dean says, his eyes widening. He sticks an arm through.
Cas was supposed to be sharing a bucket of popcorn with him, which they would throw at annoying teenage couples or snooty people who talked and played on their phones during the movies. Instead, Cas looks like a zombie as he mechanically eats the popcorn one by one while staring at the screen.
“Yes. This man has broken a number of our laws.”
“So. What next?” Dean asks.
Balthazar looks at him strangely as she jiggles the key into the hatch. “No one of import.”
He probably just needs to get laid.
“Do you want it to be?”
“I’m serious, Dean. Do you realize how hard it is to fight Naomi’s programming? Stronger people, stronger
A frown from Naomi, however, is enough to wipe everything from Ishim’s place. She snaps her fingers, and a wide door appears. Another snap, and it swings open.
They stand up and leave together, leaving Dean with nothing more than the dust that rises when they move and the bill.
“What the fuck is going on,” he laughs, "Where did these fog machines come from? I mean —
“Are Ellen and Jo coming today?” Dean asks.
“Meet you at Edlund’s Theater then?”
It isn’t until the end of the movie, that they learn why it had flopped so horribly.
“Thank you for trying so many times.”
Animals appear, elks morphing into tigers, and tigers morphing into wolves, the edges fuzzy and ever-changing. Great antlers shifting into giant manes and then transforming into thick fur.
He walks over to Cas’s office, which is next to his, though much smaller. Also, the windows are tinier and don’t let in as much sunlight. Most of the light in there is from the lights on the ceiling, which looks cold, clinical. Dean's pretty sure Cas hates the place.
Dean grins, and pulls him in for a kiss.
Currently, the ring is in his pocket. He had brought Cas to this diner on their first date, and managed to convince the owner to reserve the same seat for them.
“Cas,” Dean’s voice cracks. A step back, and then another, and then Dean’s tripping over his feet to get as far away from Cas as possible. He stumbles, and sinks down to the floor, facing away from Cas.
“I’m just peachy, thanks. What the hell are you doing in my office?”
The knocking ceases.
“Dean?”
This didn’t feel like any other first date he had been on.
Dean opens his eyes.
Dean looks at Balthazar. “What? That’s Balthazar,” he says.
“Was that — Was that a test?” Dean asks incredulously.
Someone is there to catch him.
Chuck shrugs miserably, his shoulders slouching.
“I just wanted to see if you had any free time this weekend,” he says lightly, and looks at the calendar habing from the wall. “Looks like you aren’t doing anything this Saturday at six pm.”
Cas nips at Dean’s lips gently. “I like the way you think,” he says, and starts to take off Dean’s shirt.
“You want to know why?”
When the lights die down, Dean gets a faceful of Cas’s feathers, which are wrapped tightly around him. All of Dean’s senses have just been dialed to eleven. He can hear water gurgling from the kitchen sink, smell the popcorn they had just finished, the smell still lingering in the air. He can hear the
He’s also pretty sure that Cas is going to have a heart attack if his heart rate keeps on going up, angel healing powers be damned.
“Cas?” Dean asks.
Dean keeps on falling, keeps on spinning, colors keep on filling his vision and then leaving it, each moment feeling like an eternity and a split second all at once, the images of the angels imprinting on his mind, and he doesn’t think that he’ll ever forget this for as long as he lives, and even after.
The bar they’re at is a small place, filled with truckers. Large antlers stick up from the side of the place, and tinny country music fills the air. Although this place came highly recommended, Dean knew that he should’ve known better than to take
“I don’t think I can. She hates me.”
“So, what did you and Claire talk about?”
“What do people do on Christmas Eve?” Cas asked when they walked back to the car to load the groceries. “That child looked at us with pity when we told him we didn’t have any plans for today.”
"Your mother would have loved to be here." John said and it surprised Dean because he never mentions Mary. Ever. Dean even had to hide all there photographs and whatever reminded him of her because that's how hard of a time he had accepting her death. Right away Dean got that talking about his mom was a big no-no and if Sam had a question about her he would ask Dean somewhere where John couldn't hear them. A few times Sam would ask John and that never ended so well...for Dean at least.
He grabbed a couple of rags and soaked them in cool water to wrap around the burns. This is how Jack found them, and he was ready to break his vial to heal him, but luckily Dean stopped him, asking him to grab the keys so he can drive them to the hospital.
Dean pulled away and gave Cas a few quick kisses on his smile before they were asked to turn to the camera for another picture. A few more posses and kisses before it was time to say goodbye to his family and go off to their honeymoon.
“I love you.” Dean breathed out as soon as they pulled away to catch their breaths. It didn’t click in Dean’s mind that Cas had to do that as well. All he can think about is his words spilling out of his mouth. “I love you. I love you, Cas.”
“I-I didn’t think you wanted to see me.” Dean could have joked around with him, but instead, his mouth decided to kick the conversation off with some honesty. Dean looked down at the bike handles as he talked. “Since you didn’t come out last week, I just figured-”
Dean hummed a response as his eyes traveled down to Cas’s tongue poking out to lick at his lips. His heart was hammering in his chest until it came to a stop when he heard, “Dean! Oye, cabron! I ain’t calling your name again!”
“Oh.”
aren’t going anywhere. Get out.”
Cas only shook his head in response.
“Well, you can try, but you are quite annoying.” Cas looked away from Jack to give Dean a smug little side smile and — fuck — just seeing the same pair of blue eyes coming from his son and boyfriend really just made his stomach do flips.
It was only John and him. And now there were two.
Cas smiled; it was the most genuine one he has seen in days. “Let’s go home.”
“Shouldn’t we wait for Cas?” Dean asked as he looked up at Sam and Rowena.
“On the house.” Dean holds it out and just like before their fingers touch, burning him.
Dean sighs as he stops on the sidewalk to hang his head and quietly whispers, “For fucks sakes, soy un pinche gay.”
This whole time with Jack and Dean, they have been too focused on trying to get Cas back that they just didn’t talk. Couldn’t talk. Didn’t want to talk. About all the fucked up shit they went through. All the fucked up shit Dean did to him, and he could feel the dirty guilt run through his veins. He didn’t deserve to be a father. Not for what he did to Jack. Chuck or no Chuck, he should have fought harder to be…to be better. Or at least to not take a page from John Winchester’s A+ parenting book.
"You're leaving too?" Cas pulled away just enough to look at Dean's face. "But Dean, you don't like walking away from a case."
“I can’t leave you alone with him.”
Dean drops his head as he shuts his eyes to let out a shaky breath. He can feel the tightness in his chest bubble up while the prickly feeling rises up his arms, and he fucking hates it. This was starting to happen a lot more recently, and he wondered if the hero-mojo is wearing off because he never remembers his anxiety - fuck he has anxiety - being this bad. But if he thinks of everything that happened and
This is the first time Dean has really had a vacation. He was always too busy to do so and he never really left the state unless it was to go visit Sam in California and even then it was a straight drive, only stopping to fuel him and his baby. Even now he was worried about Sam and his Dad.
Cas nodded and started walking to sit on the chair, but Dean cleared his throat loudly to get his attention. He held his hand out and motioned for Cas to come over to him. They haven’t cuddled outside these four walls, and maybe that’s what made Dean so brave even to suggest the idea while Cas took hesitant steps forward until he took Dean’s hand, unsure of himself.
Dean scrambled to sit up and saw everyone else was still knocked out. His eyes flashed to Cas, Sam, Eileen, and Rowena before they traveled to Amara’s feet, where Jack was lying.
Dean rolled his eyes and hugged his baby brother back. "I'll be in my best behavior, bitch. Plus it's going to be on tv soon."
?” Cas didn’t look at him as he talked, but the air quotes were definitely there. “Or have I been wrong?”
“Dean,” Cas gasped and then Dean pulled Cas back. He closed his eyes enjoying the soft fabric of Cas shirt in his hands. Enjoying the little gasp Cas makes inside of Dean’s mouth as Dean couldn’t help but want to taste Cas. Dean leaned against the Impala as he pulled Cas against him, his arms around Cas’ waist and fingers grasping at his shirt. They made out in the parking lot like teenagers for a few more seconds before Cas finally pulled away with a smirking smile.
“I’m done.” Castiel heard himself before he understood that this was not the only thing he would give up on.
Dean looked back down at Cas’s arms and hands that were bleeding, red and raw, from the hot water and sponge he was scrubbing against his skin. He tried to swallow back the lump growing in his chest because right now wasn’t the time to get emotional. No. Right now, Cas needed him. He needed to take care of him. Help him.
Dean had one hand behind him, keeping him upwards on the table, while the other slowly wrapped around Cas’s waist.
“I don’t need gifts from you, Dean.”
Dean saw Cas run up to him and push him out of the way to remove the frying pan from the fire just as it started to smoke up. Cas turned off the flames and turned to glare at Dean, more worried than angry, while he stood so close.
“I like you.” Dean’s eyes closed as he leaned in to brush their noses together. “Mi Angelito.”
“Yeah, well, we’ll see.”
“Jo took your parents to church remember? And Balth is still out traveling,” Cas explained as he sat down at the table starting to eat.
They took Cas to an interview at the morgue and he kept whispering, “Kiss. Kiss. Dean…I-I need a kiss.”
“You can have me.” One of his arms wrapped around Cas’s shoulders while his other hand found itself cradling the back of Cas’s head. His fingers curling around the hair while his face hid into Cas’s shoulder. “I want you too.”
“Cookies?”
Dean looked at Cas from the corner of his eyes and he saw Cas doing the same before they both reached over to hold each other’s hand. And at the same time, they both simply say, “No.”
The cameraman who got on the plane with them was walking around them filming from each angel as best he can and Dean did his best ignoring him.
It’s been a few weeks since Cas has gotten out of the big empty, and things are starting to look better for all of them.
Dean didn’t say anything as they sat back on their seats. Staring at anything but each other.
It was Dean’s turn to look away. He wiped his hands on his jeans before he reached to brush Jack’s hair out of his face. He remembers John doing this to Sam, carrying him and brushing his hair out of his face. Looking at him like he was the last thing he had that mattered, and Dean wondered if his Dad ever looked at him like that when he was asleep.
Ahi esta! La confirmación que necesitaba. This is an actual date! Pero, las palabras no le dieron pánico. No. Instead, Dean squeezed Cas’s hand as he laughed, feeling like he would just fly away if he didn’t hold on.
“You’ll always be a kid to me.”
to back off.
She walked back up the stairs with Jody and
“And who’s Jack to you? Before you have called him your little brother, but Jack told me otherwise. I also sensed hostility back then.”
He keeps on falling, until…
“This isn’t you,” the man says.
“But this is the first time I’m going to meet them as your
“I have the key to your cuffs.”
“Sorry, I don’t —” Dean tries to say.
“I’m your secretary.”
“I know you.”
“Yeah,” he says, “I do.”
“So,” Dean says, pushing the door open.
Cas rolls his eyes. “No, you don’t. I have a bad feeling about it. Dean, please,
“What? No! Jesus, no! That is
Has for a long time, actually.
“Dean?” he asks, “
Cas is right next to him, and he’s smiling.
(See the end of the chapter for
Not about his stupid blue eyes, or absolutely unprofessional, messy hair, or the way his nose scrunches and his mouth twitches when he’s annoyed at some stupid thing Dean did.
Their reasoning made a lot more sense when they were admiring Harrison Ford fighting Nazis to prevent them from getting the Ark.
But, come on, Smith. Guys? He’s straight. Purely into women. Boobs, curves, the whole nine yards.
~fin~
Cas shakes his head. “Dean will —”
Cas smiles, and Dean has no idea how Cas can be
“Peachy,” he says.
“Thank you,” Cas says again. “It’s prepared just the way I like it.”
Oh. He’s covered in blood.
and join the
“Are you alright?”
Balthazar steps forward, and gently touches his arms.
“I got to.”
Dean cups Cas’s face, and forces him to look up. “Cas,” he says. “What’s going on?”
Time stops. Dean can almost feel himself stop falling, lurching to a halt, and he drifts around, staring at the most beautiful creature he’s ever seen in his life.
“ Liar! It wasn't
Where the hell did that come from?
Sam would laugh at him if he could see him. Sam
Blue that is…
“Point.”
he promises,
“Nao — Balthazar. Do you have a list of crimes this prisoner has committed, to be read prior to his execution?”
“What —” Cas stops. Then, “Oh,” he says softly.
Dean rubs the back of his neck. “Cas, man, I just wanted to say… I just wanted to say that I’m sorry. Okay?”
Dean nods solemnly.
Wait —
Dean wakes up, and he collapses on the ground.
And all Dean feels is Cas, so Dean lets himself be pulled away.
But all Naomi does is gracefully step off the dais and signal Dean's guards to follow her. Dean grunts when one of them, most likely Ishim, the shithead, shoves him forward.
“What are you, in middle school?” Cas asks incredulously.
“Yes, yes, yes yes yes,” he whispers into Dean’s ears.
“Hello?” Dean calls out.
“Of course, you and I share a more
“Donnmove.”
“What’s happening to me,” Dean says, and covers his face with his hands.
“Is Sam going to come too?”
Cas stares at VERITAS. While VINCIT and OMNIA both have been crossed out, VERITAS is still written in the imposing, blood-like red.
“That works for me.”
thank you so much for reading this!!!! xoxo Asteria
“There is a human, one of Lucifer’s disciples, who snuck into Heaven a few days ago. You are tasked with removing him permanently from here.”
Despite not being able to see anything other than vague blobs, he’s glad that he can still see Cas, and his gorgeous blue eyes.
Cas makes a small noise next to him, and flaps his wings gently to readjust them, and curls them around Dean.
The more Dean looks at Cas… well. The more he thinks that he could probably fall in love with this guy.
How should Dean approach this? Strangulation would require too much effort, snapping his neck too gruesome. He needs something quick, easy, effortless.
Dean walks up to Cas, and puts a hand on the small of his back.
It’s not his name, not quite. But Dean’s sure, more than anything else, that Cas is talking about
“No. But Anna and Naomi were rivals. They did not understand each other, which often led to disagreements and arguments. But I had thought…” he looks down. “I had thought that Naomi cared for me.”
All in all, he wasn’t sure that it really deserved the flop of a 23% on Rotten Tomatoes. Maybe the critics were too harsh on this one.
“Dean, it’s me.”
Dean waves his hand. “Mhm, just leave it on my desk, I’ll take care of it. Oh, by the way, do you have my coffee?”
Dean wants to say something else, but he finds himself unable to follow a single train of thought. There’s something… off about Balthazar today. Of course, it’s entirely possible that Balthazar has just changed in the few millenniums that have passed since Dean last saw her.
“I love you,” Cas says, “And you love me.”
Dean wrinkles his nose. “Actually, I go by Dean now.”
Cas jumps back, and stares at him, startled.
Dean hears high heels clacking on the ground. “He’s also the only human who’s ever guessed correctly.”
“Let’s invite my family over.”
of his heart, he doesn’t think he’d be able to feel at all. It’s like all of his senses have been stripped from him.
“Listen to your fiancé, Castiel. You have the Host’s blessing now. All will be well,” Naomi says. Her eyes are soft, none of the harsh lines from before, and there might even be a slight genuine smile on her face.
Cas tenses, so Dean grabs his hands.
okay?”
Scruffy-guy is
“Naomi,” Dean says.
An angel blade appears in Dean’s hand. He’s got a job to do and he’s gonna carry it through. Besides, he’s getting sick of the man’s ramblings.
“Yes. Well. It’s more complicated than that. She’s one of four angels who can officiate angelic marriage bonds. That is, if that’s what you want. You do want a bond, right? Because we don’t
Dean wakes up to arguing voices.
Dean holds him back. They struggle for a few seconds, because Cas is remarkably single minded when he gets in the mood, but eventually, he backs off. “What?” he asks petulantly.
Cas was wrong.
Cas gapes at him for a few seconds. “Did you just —”
Which he is. In high school, he did wonder if he could like men, but that was a while ago. He wasn’t gay. Thank god for Uriel and Bartholomew, who had stuck by him for every minute of his crisis. They assured him that he was straight, and that it was natural to appreciate the physique of men, and that there’s a difference between agreeing that someone looks aesthetically pleasing and actually wanting to fuck a guy.
Cas scoffs, his arms folding in his chest.
Cas kisses him back for a while, soft and slow, gentle and sweet, before pushing him away.
He keeps on talking with Wesson about weight loss techniques involving a weirdly specific combination of quinoa, brussel sprouts, and avocados. Dean's invested in losing weight, but he isn’t sure he's
“I don’t know. Yeah. I guess,” he ends up whispering. “Yeah, I kinda do.”
“Marry me,” Dean blurts out, his voice loud and echoing through the small diner. The entire place silences, conversations stopping everywhere, people turning their heads around to stare at them.
hummed before looking up at Dean as if just remembering that he was there. “Oh. Um, she just made me promise her something.”
“¿Me vas a contestar?” Bobby threw in some whole chiles into the beans and let them simmer away. “¿Quieres que te hable en inglés? Where are you going, niño feo?”
“Why? I need-” Dean shut him up with a kiss, his lips moving just right to make Cas gasp and Dean took that as an invitation to finally taste the angel. Finally, make him somewhat his and confirm that he tasted like rain.
Dean gently finished cleaning as much as he could from Cas before standing up to face Amara. She was much more powerful than before, and yeah, that fucking scared him, but he still manages to trust her not to hurt him. To hurt them. He was afraid of what she would ask of him because, of course, nothing ever came without a price to pay.
place tonight.”
Cas reached out for the camera and then turned it on as he followed Dean into the bathroom where he started to brush his teeth.  “Second day of our married life. How are you feeling?”
“Shut up. Nothing happened we just-”
Touching was starting to become a thing they both wanted more often now, but being in the same room brought peace to his mind.
"Dean!" Dean turned to the sound of his name and saw one of the producer ladies waving at him through a door. "This way please."
Castiel, he’s Steve to those around him, learns pretty quickly that he doesn’t like his hair tugged.
"Okay, we are going to start in five. Four. Three. Two." And they didn't say the one before the little red light was on in the big main cameras.
. Again.”
"I know you can but I want to do it." Dean told him as he turned to smile at Cas. "I'm a giver."
And with that note Dean promises himself that he will not cry.
“Oh geez, thanks.” Cas turned to roll his eyes at him as he smiled playfully while his eyes landed on Dean’s lips. “I like you today too.”
“That would be his decision to make.” She lifted her hand, ready to snap. “He knows that when he needs me, I’ll be here. Maybe make sure he knows the same thing applies to you, Dean.”
His eyes were closed, just enjoying the comforting touch, as he finally breaks the silence, "Maybe I should go home."
When Dean wakes up again, not remembering when he fell asleep or if that foggy memory was just a dream, it was because Cas was shaking his shoulders. Sending Dean into red alert.
When Sam comes looking for all of them later for dinner, he finds all three of them passed out in the bed. Jack was lying on his back with his teddy on his face and an arm sticking out of bed. Dean was still sitting with his head back against the headboard and mouth wide open as he snored every few breaths. Arms loosely wrapped around Cas. While Cas slept on his side, hugging Dean while his face was tucked into Dean’s neck. Clearly, both of them were trying to make themselves smaller while Jack took most of the bed.
“You didn’t bring me-!” Dean stops when Jack makes a noise, continuing when he sees Jack relax again. Dean whispers this time. “You didn’t bring me anything?”
"Not much has changed since then." Cas spoke up and he looked at Dean quickly before he looked back at the host. "I did get a promotion at work and a new car."
“Cabron!” Victor said with no fire in his tone but a growing grin across his face. He held his hand out for Dean to take for a handshake. “Nice to see you, primo. Where’s Sam?”
The room lacks the ostentatious adornments that typically were in all of Heaven’s rooms. Instead, a single, rather nondescript chair sits in the middle of the room.
“Dean, are you alright?” Cas asks, panting, his voice fraught with worry.
And if that was grace, then that would mean… well. That would mean that he’s looking at the true forms of angels right now.
“I think that the last trial is too dangerous. And I don’t want you to go through that door.”
“What kinds of trials?”
“According to Wikipedia, the critics hated it too.”
Dean hustles Cas onto the sofa, opens Netflix, and cues up the next episode of
Dean surveys the room carefully. A ripple of movement catches his eyes, and he whirls around.
It was quite nice, actually.
It isn’t as though he hasn’t ever brought it out — he has. Many times.
“At least he and Tessa Thompson had chemistry. Otherwise the movie would’ve completely crashed and burned,” Dean says.
“Dean,” Castiel says.
“Hey, hey, hey, buddy, don’t get too excited yet, okay? I still can’t see a lot.”
Cas smiles. “Okay.”
If only Castiel were a girl.
Punch.
“Dean! What are you doing up? I thought Cassie here had exhausted you!” he says, his smile too wide, too tense, obviously forced.
"Just a precaution."
But for some reason, it was engrossing? The actors had great chemistry, the dialogue was funny, and the CGI didn’t even suck too much.
If Dean’s being perfectly honest, he thinks that this is a terrible way to judge a person’s willingness to marry the love of their lives. Of course, that’s likely because he’s the one that has to go through these trials.
“I almost didn’t, Cas, if you hadn't —”
“Truth conquers all,” Cas whispers.
It tugs him gently, not forcing him to follow by any means but asking him to go regardless.
There was the silver one with a sapphire band embedded inside that, when looked at under the sun, was the same shade as Cas’s eyes in the morning light. There was another gold one which had a pair of wings embedded onto it, which the shop owner had claimed was ‘modeled from an angel, for an angel’. He had to stop himself from buying it even after he had chosen the ring he would propose with.
Out of the corner of his eye, he can see a scruffy man wearing a suit way too formal for a diner like the one they were in, and a woman in a tacky, hot pink cocktail dress.
It occurs to Dean that he really likes Castiel.
“It’s okay, man, I mean, I was expecting to do
The owner of the restaurant squeals and barks out an order to the waiters and waitresses. Out of the corner of his eye, Dean can see scruffy-guy glaring at him while pocketing the box that he was holding. The girl — Becky, however, seems perfectly happy to coo at Dean and Cas.
Everything hurts.
“Okay,” Dean says, breathing deeply. “Do you guys want to go somewhere else then?”
Dean was
Everything turns so bright, and even half blind, Dean has to close his eyes and turn away.
Dean waves him off. “Potato, potahto.”
“Regardless, you know that we can have him fired for harassment. All you have to do is say the word,” Uriel says solemnly.
earlier,” Bartholomew says, wrinkling his nose.
“Sister Naomi?” Cas says, “It’s me, brother Castiel.”
“Why don’t you ever do anything romantic like that, Chuck?” Becky asks.
“I love you.”
“No. I just saw a tentacle monster for twenty, maybe thirty seconds at a stretch. And then it was over.”
Dean totally jinxed himself.
, he can hear. It’s not spoken in English, certainly not any human language that he knows of. Dean’s not even entirely sure if Cas has even said it out loud.
Dean blinks, and realizes that Cas’s been healed. He must have done that accidentally, at some point.
He’s not sure when Naomi left, but he does know that he’s the only angel in the room.
“Yes. Do you?”
Besides, the last two weren’t really all that dangerous for me, right? Besides, you said that it wasn’t real. So don’t worry, okay?”
“Yeah, but Ellen totally reamed her for that. She’s not gonna be pulling that one again anytime soon.”
“It’s better than nothing.”
“Uh,” Jo says, “Sam told us that you tried to ask him out twenty separate times.”
Dean shifts in the bed and blinks his eyes open. He’s half-dressed in his and Cas’s bedroom, and it’s dark outside. There’s a sliver of light coming from the door, though. He groans softly, climbs out of bed, and walks into their living room.
Cas smiles gummily at that. Dean suddenly finds it a bit harder to breathe, and his stomach flutters when Cas beams at him.
“Yes.”
“... Barth?”
The knocking came back, this time more loud, and incessant.
It’s better than nothing though.
“Why am I bleeding?”
Everything is dark, the inky blackness expanding its reaches all around him.
“What?” Cas squawks.
“Oh.”
“Yeah, but as long as I can prove that I love you, which,” Dean winks, “shouldn’t be that hard, I think I’ll be fine.”
The being, Cas, shifts, he stares at Dean, the wisps on his sides curling towards Dean.
“She’s going to kill you — no. She’s going to kill him, and make you watch.”
Cas furiously scrubs nonexistent stains on their dining table, while keeping an eye on the pot heating up soup on the stove. He’s already spent hours cleaning, meticulously sweeping every last bit of dust from the counters.
These days, the bed feels empty. In the past, when Dean was coasting through life as a bachelor, he was happy, and free of commitments. But around a week ago, he kept on getting this feeling. Almost as if something were missing.
Tracing a finger around Cas’s face, Dean says, “It’s gonna go great, babe.”
“So… you want me to remove a guy.”
He scoots back, to the farthest corner of the prison, as far away from the door as is physically possible. Dean walks towards the traitor and picks him up by his dirty cuffs.
“You know that it’s most likely going to get harder from here, right?” Cas asks.
Naomi’s lips thin into what you might call a smile if you had terrible eyesight and squinted a lot.
Cas tenses. Dean brushes his lips against Cas’s shirt. “Hey, sunshine, it’s gonna be okay.
Dean groans and buries his face into the pillow.
“Wild. How’d Warner Bros even let this pass? How’d the
“Yeah, well” Cas says, glancing at Dean and smiling, “it did take him quite a few tries to get it right.”
Slice.
“Nothing?” Dean asks, lips curled up, “Then let’s get started.”
Dean kicks a leg, flails around experimentally, but he still doesn’t feel anything. If he weren’t starting to panic, feeling the grounding
He’d still do it a hundred times over for an eternity with Cas.
He tried when the school year was over, but they got carried away inside of Cas’s classroom, and his department head had walked into the room right when things were getting interesting.
“Well that
Dean walks up and puts his hand on the dip in Cas’s back. Cas relaxes slightly around him, and shifts so that his wings curl around Dean.
Dean smiles at Cas, who looks stricken, before wrenching the door open and stepping in.
Dean grabs on to Cas’s hand and they push the door open together.
He can’t feel anything around him, he’s not holding onto anything for support.
Cas looks up at him from where he’s sitting on Dean’s desk.
“Have at it, sweetheart.”
Dean feels another stab of guilt.
He breathes in, and yells, “Naomi! Naomi, where are you?”
“Good.”
“Nah, I haven’t gotten the chance to try the new cleanse yet,” Dean says into the headset, “What? You got results in less than a month? That’s wild man! I’ll give it a shot!”
Cas’s lips twitch up. “You haven’t met my sister Naomi, have you?”
Dean stares at the empty space Balthazar was just occupying.
Cas bites his lips nervously, and stares at his feet.
An angel stands at the top of the marble dais, right next to the gilded throne where their Father used to sit at. Her white swan wings are outstretched, the tip of each wing reaching one end of the throne.
And Dean recognizes him.
Dean gapes at her. “You want me to
Heaven is completely empty when they get there.
Dean steps forward and presses the key into the center of the sigil. It immediately lights up, and breaks apart. The pieces fall to the ground.
Maybe even since the first time they met.
“Execution?” the prisoner says, flabbergasted.
“I love you,” he whispers again.
“Good morning, Dean,” he says, “Are you alright?”
Cas narrows his eyes. “What are you doing here?”
many times,” he says, acting scandalized.
Cas inhales the coffee before bringing it up to his lips. Dean watches him with baited breath. Cas takes a small sip before smiling at the coffee. He doesn’t look at Dean.
“Don’t forget my coffee!” Dean yells.
........maybe.
Dean takes a step back. And another. And another. He keeps on going until he hits the wall, and he starts sinking down.
Cas nods at Becky and Chuck, who is now morosely taking their food in a to-go box and trailing behind Becky as they leave. Dean shrugs, his eyes wide and innocent.
Green mist emanates from Dean’s chest, and Dean reaches for Cas’s hands.
Dean opens the box, his hands shaking, and fumbles a few times before taking out the ring. He holds Cas’s hand and gently pushes the ring on. When it’s finally there, Cas lets go of his hands and admires it.
“Did it work? Their request?”
“Dean,” the man says, “I know you can hear me.”
Cas stares at him, his brows furrowed, while licking his ketchup covered hands.
Cas keeps on rubbing his back, holds him tight, keeps him warm.
He twirls a wisp of the eerily familiar blue light — his grace, Dean realizes — and gathers it in his hands.
Dean snorts.
Cas nods stiffly.
,” Dean yells as he walks into yet another door frame.
Dean’s definitely going to invest in some good quality lip balm sometime in the (hopefully) near future.
“Don’t be,” Cas says and leans in to kiss him again.
He presses ‘end call’. Then, he sighs, shrugging his shoulders and stretching.
gonna be okay.”
pass, okay? I love you. I love you and I’m going to show your whole family just how much I love you. Okay?”
He hopes that he didn’t just jinx himself.
Back when he was there, during the golden days when Lucifer was still a revered angel and God watched over them, it was a bright colorful place, filled with fledglings. Now, all the fledglings have grown up. The fountains have been removed and the paintings all taken down.
“Last time we saw her,” Cas whispers solemnly, “she put spiders in our bed sheets.”
When Dean turns back to look at Cas, his fiancé winks at him the way he always does, too obvious and exaggerated, awkward and adorable, and nods towards Chuck and Becky.
“So is this a date?”
Naomi snaps her fingers. “And now his eyes have stopped bleeding as well. Happy?”
There’s a loud noise that’s coming… from somewhere.
Dean winces. So telling Jo about Cas’s biggest irrational fear was, perhaps, not the brightest decision that he’d ever made in his life.
Dean nods. He wants to push Cas more, but he lets the topic change pass. It’s clearly unnerving Cas, and he can always ask about it later.
“Okay then. Do you know anybody who’s survived them?”
Stab.
Dean tuts and winks. “You do want to get that promotion, don’t you?”
Dean still can’t see much, but can still hear things, so they watch Tombstone, a movie Dean’s practically memorized at this point.
Dean still shudders to think of that one, ill-fated Valentine’s Day.
He steps back, and trips over his feet as he leaves the room.
The being is warm, familiar. It’s love, and kindness. It’s drinking beer during movie night, stealing kisses on the sofa. It’s a home, not perfect by any means, but it’s somewhere he belongs.
He presses his lips onto Cas’s.
“Dean!” Uriel says, walking over to him. He smiles thinly. “It’s good to see you.”
“Fuck off,” he growls.
A drill appears in Naomi’s hands.
“No.” Dean thrashes in his seat. The Enochian sigils on his cuffs light up and he grunts as they pull him back to his original position. His breaths come in quicker and quicker. She presses the drill to his forehead.
He tried to propose when they were stargazing, but their neighbor’s Chihuahua totally ruined the mood when he pooped on Cas’s wings.
“Anna was fine.”
“So,” Dean smiles. “It worked.”
Shoves him, kicks him, throws him into the wall.
“The last time someone came up here to request bonding with a human, they simply requested to connect Anna’s grace with her lover’s soul. I had hoped that we could ask for the same.”
“I know you’re in there.”
“What are you trying to say?”
“Cas!” Jo yells, and gives him a big hug. Cas looks at Dean, his eyes wide and fearful. Dean almost cackles.
“Look, man, you’re cool and all. But I’m straight.”
Dean leans in and pecks Cas gently on the lips. “Cas,” he whispers, “I can see.”
Slowly, slowly, Dean feels himself being cradled by a being almost beyond his comprehension.
Dean places his forehead gently on what he presumes to be Cas’s chest.
In the end, he settled on a black, iridescent, chrome ring. He tried to aim for something similar to the color of Cas’s wings, and in his humble opinion, he thought that he did pretty well.
Every time he thinks he can decipher a word from the cacophony of sounds, it slips away from him.
“Thank you,” Cas says, and smiles gently.
Dean scoffs. Cas grabs his chin, and forces him to look into Cas’s eyes.
that I wanted to marry the man that I love.”
Uriel and Bartholomew look at each other, and gravely shake their heads in sync.
Heaven had definitely gone through some renovations since the last time the seraph, Dean (or Michael, as he was called), had been there.
Balthazar and Cas are standing close together. He can’t see Cas’s face, but he can see Cas’s shoulder tense, fist clenching, and his wings shaking, every feather tucked in tightly. Balthazar’s clutching his shoulders, his wings flared out beside him, and he’s shaking Cas every so often.
Honestly, Dean was half convinced that this place was pulled out of some kind of 1930s technicolor-style animator’s nightmare.
“I can see.”
Cas nods, his movements small and careful, and exits the office, closing the door with a slight ‘click’.
“What d’you want anyways?”
They’re sitting at the movie theater, and Cas is totally into the movie.
The movie is playing lightly in the background, but Dean’s curled up against Cas, Cas’s fingers running gently through his hair, and yeah, Dean might love Tombstone, but some things are just more important.
Cas shoots him a despairing look. “I’m so sorry Dean, I should’ve listened to Balthazar, I—”
“Who’s me?” he slurs.
let this shitstorm hit the theaters?”
“Sit,” Naomi says.
Dean shrugs. “I mean, Sam already knew that I was gonna propose to you. But yeah, he’s probably gonna want to come as well.”
“The point is, it’s getting better.”
“Big surprise there.”
Cas says mildly, “I don’t think you get to make that choice for me.”
“Do you believe me?”
It shines, brighter than any other grace he’s seen. It burns his eyes but he can’t look away, it stares into his soul, and strips him bare.
Especially when Bartholomew and Uriel seem even more displeased with the place than he does. Dean could tolerate the loud noises and the music, but Bartholomew shies away from the aisle whenever anybody gets too close and Uriel wrinkles his nose every time someone speaks too loudly.
Currently spreading around his face?
“A date—”
“Son of a
Dean scoffs. “Does this happen every time an angel gets married?”
Dean shook his head, “What? I’ve known you for how long? And I’ve never seen you wear anything but monochromatic but now you’re sporting flowers?”
“He wants you to stop looking at him like he’s a monster.”
had a smile plastered across his face. They hadn’t had a chance to talk about what happened, considering
“I’m sorry.” He cleared his throat as he felt the smooth ice cream start to turn to gum down his throat. He looked down at his shake, lifting the straw up and down to hear the gloppy sound while trying to figure out what to say to her.
"Don't I know it." Sam laughed and Dean fought the urge to punch his brother with the camera on him. "It's going to be great though. You deserve a happy ending Dean."
“He says that? He says I’m awesome?”
Dean watched as Cas poured himself a big mug full and then sat across from him on the kitchen table to join him. Dean already had the sugar and creamer on the table, prepared for Cas who always gets up a few minutes after him.
Dean’s eyes fell into Cas’s mouth as his tongue poked out to lick his lips before he swallowed hard.
“How can I? I made the kid into a damn bomb! I made him into a weapon!” Dean heard his voice raise, and he saw Mia blink at him in shock for a second before she fixed her expression. He shook his head as he shut his eyes tight. Spitting things through his teeth. “I made him think that he was only useful if he
They pulled apart, and Dean jogged over alone to grab their bag of food. Dean decided to get a few of his favorites and drinks.
“You are both my best friends, Dean.”
“Good morning, Dean.” Cas walked into the kitchen, dragging his bunny slippers across the cold floor and towards the coffee machine.
“It’s um,” Dean digs his hand into his jean pocket as he clears his throat. “Since I’m keeping your um…grace, for now, I think you can have something of mine to wear.”
Cas pressed a kiss to Dean’s shoulder, lingering for a second too long before he turned around to look back at Jack. Dean reached to grab his arm, just wanting to touch him, but Cas walked over to pick up Jack instead. Leaving him feeling a little cold as he pulled his hand back to grip the table behind him.
"I do! It's just that those are so damn good."
Cas let a strained smile spread across his lips. “Thank you, Dean.”
Dean, without really thinking, leaned in to give Cas a quick peek. “Anytime, buddy. Just don’t get near Sam.”
Of course, Dean never told
“Hey.” He reaches over with one hand to lay on his boyfriend’s cheek. “How are you doing, sweetheart? You hungry? We can go to the diner we passed getting into town.”
It felt like old times and Dean wasn’t sure if he liked it or not. It was comfortable and easy to just gravitate towards Cas again, they both seem to have the same plan of wanting to be in clear view of one another at all times, but the only difference between them now was that Cas always followed Dean to his room to sleep.
The Empty wasn’t budging until Jack showed up at the bunker that morning saying the Empty visited heaven with a deal to make. One that Dean agreed to without hearing what it was. Lucky for them it was something simple because the big scary entity only wants one thing, silence.
“I know.”
Cas nodded as he closed the door to Dean’s bedroom. “Yeah, Gabriel’s waiting for me outside. We’re gonna try to leave before Dad comes home from work.”
feel a little better knowing she still cared, but she was dealing with it her way. Or, as
“Dean, it’s happening again.”
When he finally arrived at the hotel he once again parked his own car and as soon as he opened his driver’s door a camera was on him.
Jack covered Cas’s mouth with his tiny hands while Cas tried talking, both of them laughing as they left the kitchen.
, the kid is also warming up to me.” Dean could hear the smile in Gabriel’s voice. “Jack got all the names from you, by the way. Somewhere in your little noggin, I was number one in the call-sheet.”
Cas tried hard to control his expression, Dean could see his wheels turning in his head, trying to comprehend what Dean was saying to him, but he stayed quiet. Waiting. Listening.
Dean nods, stepping away from Cas so as not to seem pushy. As much as he loved being so close to Cas’s face, he didn’t want to seem creepy about it. This neighborhood has eyes everywhere, and Dean couldn’t really risk having his cart, his livelihood, be taken away just cause he has a small crush on the white boy.
And for a second Dean saw the softness in his eyes before he looked away, almost embarrassed. He started to get up from the bed, struggling to detangle himself from the sheet, and then looked down at himself confused. He wasn’t wearing his signature trench coat or even shoes.
They would be wrong.
They didn't have much more time to talk since their families came out to congratulate them and introduce themselves. Cas seemed overwhelmed by the many names he had to learn but he accepted the invitation to dinner that Ellen offered when they come back from their honeymoon.
Because he knew Cas would like it.
Cas smiled, it was small and sad, but his eyes were still warm while he gave a stiff nod.
His heart raced at the sudden affection he was receiving, considering Cas had not been so forward with it. He was always asking or waiting for Dean to initiate whatever touch they did have.
It’s hard to look at the kid when he reminded them of the person they lost.
“You’re one of the few people I see as family.
“You know, next time, a damn thank you card will suffice. Not a whole damn blast from the past.”
Sam walked closer to Dean and didn't object to Dean fixing his tie or shirt like he was a child again. Instead, Sam talked about how Jess was already in a taxi and on her way. "How you holding up?"
Cas opened his mouth to say no. To finally tell the only person who still called him by his name with warmth and concern, he was so fucking miserable. That he wished he was fucking dead than to walk another step in this life.
“¿Qué pasa, Angelito? What’s wrong?”
They both tucked in on either side while Dean asked if Cas was a blanket hog and laughed as Cas glared at him. Luckily as soon as they were both comfortable the cameraman left and the lights were off, the only light was the light from the moon and the only sound was their breathing along with the ocean outside.
“How about I read you a bedtime story?” Dean offered too quickly. “I used to do it to Sam when he was a kid. He would knock right out.”
But because he was still talking to the freaking
Jack didn’t look at him right away. The frown in his brows deepened, growing heavier, and his hands clenched where they lay on top of the covers, turning into fists as the wheels inside his head kept turning. There was definitely something on Jack’s mind, something that he was apparently having trouble putting into words, and that whole scene only made Castiel’s worry grow.
But they didn’t have the time for that conversation now.
She’d never met Jo before, so Jess had no idea who she was.
Confused as he may be about the whole thing, though, one thing was crystal clear to Dean in that moment—Charlie really was a freaking
and that was really the main thing they needed right now.
At those thoughts, Dean opened his eyes, finally leaning away from the wall. His slightly unfocused gaze fell to his hands as he held them up right in front of his body, shaky and unsteady, and although the skin that covered them was clean, shiny and wet from the running water, Dean felt like he could see countless stains on them, dark and crimson and covering every single inch of the appendages, painting his skin with the blood of all the people the archangel had killed with them. And those stains might go unseen by everyone else, but Dean would always know that they were there, and no number of showers would ever wash them off.
“I—I… I can’t…” Cas tried to speak again, even though clearly that wasn’t a good idea.
And that was exactly what the angel was worried about now that he knew. He vowed not think about it too often, intent on doing his best to keep this from Dean for as long as the human insisted that he did not wish to know, even if the angel knew for a fact that the hunter would be very happy when he finally found out—whenever that may be. Dean, too, would truly be happy with either gender; Castiel had felt that, too.
Dean cursed inside his head at the sight, shaking his head and letting out a breath. He didn’t give the guy an answer right away, though, still choosing to stick with the slow approach. “What do you know?” he inquired instead, voice as gentle as he could make it.
Dean shook his head. “No, that’s it. They really didn’t say much. They just talked about this Lilith or whatever not being happy with them because all the other people they tried to turn back in Superior were dead, and Tom was worried because Meg had snatched a hunter and all, but then she gave me the injection, and…” He shrugged, “Well, everything else I heard after that didn’t make much sense—it was mostly stuff that didn’t really connect, just snippets from their conversations. I was too out of it to really hear anything clearly. I just know that they talked about how they were following orders. It really sounded like they answered to someone—probably this Lilith, I’m guessing. But really, that’s it. That’s all I got.”
Cas looked pretty relieved when Dean relented so easily.
He was really, really fucking lucky that Dean hadn’t yet managed to break free from those handcuffs.
Cas nodded slowly, that small smile still on his lips, and Dean suddenly felt his face heating up again.
Charlie didn't look surprised to hear those words, but she did consider Sam for a long pause before finally nodding in agreement. "Yeah, okay," she replied lowly, reloading her gun, "Let's find the rest of them."
