Dean should have expected it, he thought to himself as in a lightning fast move after reaching for the journal John punched Dean in the jaw and then pivoted twisting one of Dean’s arms behind his back and slamming Dean face first into the wall.
At the sound of footsteps crunching on the leaves, Dean sighed loudly. For fucks sake, it wasn’t like he was hurting anyone here. Although, technically the place was still property of the MOL, so Dean really didn’t have the right to be here. Hastily wiping his tears away, Dean stood up and turned to watch his brother coming up the dock.
“Of course.” Castiel said and got ready to leave but Dean had a brief moment of panic and grabbed his sleeve. “Only if it's safe okay?” Dean added.
Lamps, chairs, anything and everything he could reach was soon torn apart and scattered across the ground in shattered pieces until there was nothing left for Dean to destroy. His energy expended, Dean sunk to the floor, his knees tight across his chest. He broke down, and sobbed, bumping his head against the wall behind him a few times. The pain that twisted his face was what eventually managed to tide him over to a certain degree, his body ceasing its hectic need for movement enough for him to sink back into his thoughts. He was just so done. Dean hugged himself tighter, and the action made the hard edge of the crystal dig sharply into his skin. It was supposed to be so Crowley could help Dean,
They finally pulled back from the hug. “Yeah, okay.” Dean scoffed, and looking down, he missed the hurt look that flashed across Sam’s face.
Cas tilted his head a moment looking at John intensely and said simply. “This is your father. He is human.”
I think I have the year correct for the first funnel cake but I apologize if it is wrong.
Dean jerked slightly at the abrupt change in the direction of the conversation.  “I think so, I know I’ve really enjoyed them and spending time with you.  You’ve kinda awesome.” Dean admitted with a smile and was rewarded with a big one in return.
Hint:  Sam and Cas will be up in the next couple of chapters.
“It wasn’t him.”  Dean repeated a little louder but again he was ignored causing him to grit his teeth.
“Are you guys okay?”  Dean asked trying to look at everyone at the same time his gaze lingering on Sam.
So how to you all like the BAMF Cas in this chapter?  I hope this fully redeems him in people's eyes.  The visit to Red kind of came about with editing but I was really happy with how it turned out.
See you next week!
Dream guy must have picked up on a few of Dean’s thoughts because he grinned and stepped closer, right into Dean’s personal space.
“I’ll check.”  Crowley said and disappeared before Dean could utter another word.
Dean attacked an angel after being provoked and Cas blamed Dean without finding out what happened.  Dean was then attacked and mortally wounded but Cas and Sam both assumed Dean killed the angel for now reason.
Metatron had managed to get a hold of Chuck’s unpublished works which were current until just a year ago. He needed to find a way to get rid of Dean. Dean was becoming too big of a problem, getting in the way, capturing Gadreel, and it was just dumb luck that Metatron was able to rescue him in time. Metatron knew that killing Dean would only turn him into a full blown knight and he would then be a bigger threat. Dean was the only player left on the board that could cause Metatron problems when he followed through with his plan to take humanity. He wanted his name being prayed to, churches built to honor him, and everything else that went along with being the new god, but he had to get rid of Dean first for any of that to happen.
Triggers are discussing past abuse, some self harm (Dean punches a wall).
________
And despite everything -- the torture, the rape, the attempted training, Dean couldn’t help the hurt he felt at hearing that and he visibly winced. John’s words always hurt worse than anything he ever did to Dean.
Dean rolled his eyes.  “So I figured it was something he would enjoy so we had lunch.  Ok no biggie.”
Nothing too triggering in this chapter, see end for notes.
Hi just a short one here but I didn't want to combine it with the next chapter.  No triggers.
Please leave kudos or comments or both!
Since it was Cas asking Dean sighed loudly deciding he had to come clean.  “Sam you remember that restaurant that had those empanada things?”  Sam nodded.  “Remember you didn’t want to go with me?”  Dean said.
And isn't Death just awesome!  I had to bring him back again.
Sam and Dean stared in awe at the library.
“Yes, please. Please, Cas, please.”  And Cas leaned back down and Dean finally felt the naked skin of his angel against his skin as their lips crashed together.  Dean couldn’t get enough of kissing those perfectly plump lips.  Even the fact that they were slightly chapped didn’t fail to send bolts of arousal through him.
“Would you like to tell me why you just let me in and didn’t perform any tests. Kinda a rookie mistake, Dean. Not to mention you would have put Sam in danger if I had been some kind of monster.” John said conversationally but Dean recognized the glint of steel in John’s eyes at the question and he gulped his hands starting to shake a bit with nerves.
“Don’t worry Sam, I’m sure I can tweak the memory spell I’ll have to use on you to make you okay with the way things are going to be. Maybe I’ll save you the crisis of consciousness and add something in there to make you on board with our little whore over here.” John said with an evil smirk.
John looked satisfied at Dean’s reaction and Dean cursed himself for displaying emotion. “But first, we need to get rid of Dean’s merry band of monsters. Like I said before I think seeing the demon and angel die is going to do a lot for your attitude huh son. And then we’ll go get that vampire and I’ll cut his head off nice and slow in front of you.” John promised.
“Of course.”  Death replied.
Hi everyone, sorry for the delay (I know I say that every week), but I lost power for 2 days and got behind in everything.  I did get some more writing done, and I'm pretty happy with what came out in the first draft.  There are just a couple of pivotal chapters to write and I will be done and can concentrate on tweaking what's left.
Triggers include Dean alluding to past abuse.
A few uncomfortable moments later Sam coughed to break the spell.
to tell you everything, but just…  You’re actually here and I missed you so much, Cas.”  Dean whispered, his green eyes full of love and longing.  “Let me enjoy it for a minute?”  Dean asked, his cheeks and ears pinked up with a blush.
The kudos and comments have been so wonderful to receive.  I'm so glad you all like the story, and I hope I can continue to keep your interest.  I've rewritten most chapters and we are coming up on newly written ones so all mistakes are mine.
“Am I forgiven?”  Death teased.
Triggering content in this chapter, please see end for notes.
“And then comes along this human, this frustrating, brave, crass, loyal and infuriating human who stood up to me and refused to cower in fear even though I know you were shaking in your boots.”  Death his lips quirked up in a small fond smile.
Dean tried to squirm away but he was held too tightly, and pressed against the wall he had no leverage, so Dean brought up his knee as hard as he could right into Dream guy’s groin.
Dean gasped and felt down his body, feeling the blanket still tied to him like a toga and his whole body started shaking. Despite the fact that Crowley had imprisoned him in this room of stone, Dean welcomed the warmth when Crowley pulled Dean into his arms and started to stroke his back murmuring softly until Dean finally stopped shaking.
Hi everyone, I hope you all had a good week and everyone is staying healthy.  Here is a bit of a longer chapter which is basically three really small chapters that I put together.  There is nothing too triggering, see end for notes.
“Yeah, yeah.”  Dean said fondly.  “Don’t let it happen again.”  He teased right back.  “Talk to you soon.”  And Dean hung up the phone growling as Tessa grabbed three more and then disappeared with a wink.
“No, I don’t think so, my beautiful hunter.” The guy grabbed Dean’s throat and squeezed, stopping his call for help. He leaned in, plastering his body against Dean’s. “Just relax. I’ll make you feel so good.” The guy  murmured as his lips closed over Dean’s. Sweetness flooded Dean’s mouth and he tried to pull away and stop it because whatever it was, it always made Dean horny and out of control.
“You mean until you take off again and shut me out.”
Now on a darker note, I'm not gonna lie, this chapter is going to be brutal.  I've been pretty nervous about it and changed it a few times but this is what wanted to come out.  You can skip the chapter entirely and I will put a summary at the end if you don't want to read all the hurt.  I also put ******* at the beginning and end of the part with sexual stuff if you wanted to skip just that.
After a werewolf hunt gone wrong Dean is led to believe Sam was killed and he attacks a bunch of werewolves.  He lets the Mark take control and Sam eventually stops him.  Dean goes to hug Sam but Sam flinches scared at what he saw and the crazy look Dean still has.
Once again thank you so very much for all the kudos and comments.  They have motivated me to write two more chapters, out of order unfortunately, but at least they are getting written.
“Get the fuck off!” Dean cried, trying to buck him off but he only received a chuckle in response. Grabbing Dean’s hair again, Dream Guy crashed his lips onto Dean’s.
“You shouldn’t have come here.” Dream guy said, his back still to Dean as he pulled out a book and rifled through the pages.
“For now.” Cain responded.
______
Dean stood his ground, glaring at the guy.
Dean watched his father’s face turn to one of confusion as he looked down at his chest and saw two bullet holes. Eyes wide with shock John looked at Dean lying on his back on the floor holding his smoking gun. “Finally found some balls you little cocksucker.” John chuckled as blood bubbled up in his mouth.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Last week, last week!”  Sam said, his voice rising to a high pitch.  “Dean what the hell?”
“As I was saying.”  Death continued.  “Since God left I have not really had the occasion to…”  and Death paused trying to find the words.  Sighing Death continued.  “I found myself lonely.  I have been alive for a very very long time Dean.”  Death murmured.
Cain just grunted in reply, but Dean saw the flash of a small smile.
Dean stood up and looked at the angel in shock.  “Cas, what are you doing here?  How did you find me?”  Dean asked as he stepped closer.  It was taking everything in him to not fling himself at Cas and kiss him senseless.
“You’re sick!” Sam snarled, but his eyes were wide and frightened at seeing this side of his father.
“I don’t want this. Please dad, stop, please stop, please stop.”  A teenage Dean screamed into the pillow as John roughly fucked him, uncaring of the pain he caused, laughing at Dean’s tears. His large hand crushed the thin bones of Dean’s wrists he held at the small of Dean’s back.
“What happened, Sam? You just took off.” Cas started questioning right away. “Is everything al…” his voice trailed off as he saw Dean step into the doorway. Sam watched in amusement as Cas tried to jerk to his feet too fast, knocking over his cup, and after fumbling around a bit finally managed to free himself from the kitchen table and chair with a huff and pink cheeks.
“Wait a minute!”  Dean said forcefully causing John, Sam and Cas to all come into the room with slight alarm on their faces.
Dean felt a weird buzz through his veins and his arm felt blazing hot.  Dean glanced at the Mark on his arm that Crowley had manipulated him into getting.  Cain had warned it came with a great burden, but Dean didn’t care as long as he would be able to kill Abaddon.  He wasn’t even pissed that Crowley had set the whole thing up knowing beforehand that Dean would have to take on the Mark in order to use the blade.  It didn’t matter.  So what if this turned out to be a bad thing for Dean.  What did Dean have to live for now anyway?  His dad was alive and still tormenting him; he had no Cas; and once again he had no Sam.  Even though Dean didn’t care at this point what happened to him, he sure as fuck didn’t want to give this two-bit wanabee any satisfaction.  So Dean refused to show fear, tried to hide his pain and refused to give Drake the screams he wanted so badly to hear.
Benny smirked when he saw Sam.  “Hey chief.”  He drawled and leaned back against the wall.
Cas stepped forward.  “And what did Tessa mean by time hopping Dean?”
“We don’t know.”  Dean admitted buckling his belt and feeling a little better now that he was fully dressed, although the glaring look of hate and violence in John’s eyes made Dean’s stomach twist in a knot.
(See the end of the chapter for
Gasping for air, his body trembling, Sam thumbed to the next video, ignoring Dean behind him as he cried something out to Sam. Sam was only skimming through, could only bare watching snippets, but even that had his stomach rolling. It was enough for him, as horror spread through his body while he flipped through videos that showed Dean being beaten, Dean being raped, Dean being whipped, Dean giving a guy a blow job as another took him from behind while John stood there egging the men on, John forcing Dean to beg, John doing unspeakable things to… to… NO, his father couldn’t — wouldn’t — and Dean….
Hi here is another chapter.  Slight triggers only in this chapter.  See end for notes.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Don’t be like that Dean.”  John whispered his lips rubbing at Dean’s neck.  “It’s been a long time.”
Dean squeezed his eyes shut, hoping the memory would disappear, but it was right there. Dean could feel the guy’s hands, could feel the tightness of the golden strands holding him against and wall. Dean pulled back from Crowley slightly. His heart thundered and he broke out in a fine sheen of sweet as he started to shake all over again. His wrists had circles of bruises around them, matching where the strands had been. And when Dean looked at his arms, bruises forming the imprint of a large hand were clearly visible on each biceps.
Dean gave a small smile and shrugged.  “It’s okay.”  Dean answered but he shook slightly at the memories of what his father had put him through.
“Really?  That’s great.”  Sam said and Cas hummed in agreement.  “But why couldn’t he tell all of us?”
“Ah… Okay.”  Dean said.  He didn’t know how to deal with being the focus of the angel’s intense attention.  No one had ever looked at Dean like that.  It laid him bare, and he wished he was better for his angel.
fuh-shaw - that's for sure
“Really?”  Dean asked with an almost little boy voice so surprised that someone like Death would be willing to help him, and once again Death cursed God for all the heartache this human has had to live through that caused him to think so little of himself.  He would never understand it.
“Cas is an angel.” Sam said with a smile.
Here is the second part of the last chapter.  See end for notes.
Once again thank you so much for the kudos and comments.
The angels had found a way to block Dean's prayers and phone calls/texts to Cas and Dean thought Cas was done with him.
However, with idea after idea being thrown out, Dean banged his head against the steering wheel in frustration. He knew he didn’t have a lot of time. Crowley would track him down soon. Dean was surprised he hadn’t found him already, but Dean also knew that Crowley was smart enough to give Dean a chance to cool down.
“He thinks he has a lead on a weapon that would actually kill Abaddon.”  Dean explained taking a sip of his coffee.
Here is the link again to the art post on Tumblr.
“What the fuck is going on Dean?”  John demanded but he was once again silenced by Crowley.
“Hush,” the voice whispered. “I’ll take the pain away Dean, my beautiful hunter. Just relax.”
Dean then smirked and continued. “You told me to take care of the problem, and I took care of it… My King.”  Dean snarled. His eyes widened as red crept into Crowley’s eyes from rage.
“Benny!” Dean tried to call out but with the gag it just sounded like benmmhuy.  Then all the demons rushed into the room.  Four of them tore Benny off Drake and started fighting him, and Dean saw one demon smoke out as his throat was ripped apart by the vampire.
(See the end of the chapter for
Well that's it.  See you all hopefully in a week or so.
Dean just gave him a sad smile.  "Yeah ok Cas.   What I'm trying to say here is just that I'm sorry, I'm just really sorry Cas.”  Dean said and he couldn't hold the flood of emotion back anymore and he started to cry.
Sam flushed in embarrassment.  He was going to kill his brother Sam thought, but Benny just kept talking.
“Oh yeah that’s good Dean.  Your mouth is perfect.  I’m gonna keep you here for a long time.”  Drake said as he moaned in pleasure.  “Chained to my bed.  Gonna make you pay for taking the master away from me.”  Drake moaned again and Dean choked and gurgled as hot cum shot down his throat.
He was the fucking King of Hell. Dean should be hanging from chains, his back bloody from a whip, or sating Crowley’s rage in bed crying beneath him, but no. Crowley sends him on a timeout. He had to get Dean away from him before he lost control.
“You are singularly the most exquisite person I have ever seen.”  Cas said reverently, his gaze sweeping over every inch of Dean.  “The stars in heaven pale in comparison to the stars upon your body.”  He added as fingers traced over some of Dean's freckles.
Dean thinks he would drive halfway across the world to see Cas if he wasn’t with him right this moment. There’s an urgency picking at his skin. It’s not sexual, and it’s not anxious, just an insistent push. A steadfast sort of do-or-die. Cas has been the goddamn love of Dean’s life since somewhere between
“Dean,” not-Cas says softly. He takes Dean’s hand between both of his own. The contact burns. “We’re free. I swear to you, we did it. Chuck’s gone.”
He hums the ending to the song that got cut off in Baby, shoves open the door to the library with his hip, and freezes.
He slams the door to his room, sinks down hard into the bed. It wasn’t like he’d ever thought it could happen, but—god. Fuck. Cas doesn’t want him. Cas can’t stand being in the same room as him—he’s disgusted—he never thought Cas out of everyone in the world would hate him for this—
Cas flails for a second, grabs the nearest object to him. “I’m sorry.” He holds up his ticking and on-time alarm clock, looking guilty. “My alarm clock is broken and I really need to fix it.”
“You’ve got to know, Cas.” Dean takes the coward’s way out, muffles the words into Cas’ neck. “You’re it for me.”
Dean swallows. “There’s no her. Just you.”
“Mornin’! First date?” winks the cashier.
And it’s not like Cas has a frame of reference for this kind of shit, anyway. He could buy Cas the red roses and get him a heart-shaped box of chocolates, too, and the guy would probably try planting them outside. So he reaches for the bouquet—it’s heavier than he had expected, maybe 15 stems total, and he gets back in line.
Not-Cas continues, insistent, “There aren’t any gaps in your memory. We’ve been at the bunker since Chuck left. You’ve been fixing up my car and I’ve been writing down all the lore I know for the library during the day. We watch movies together after dinner. You put your arm around me, sometimes. We’re not--” he stops, suddenly frustrated. Scrubs his hand down his face. “Dean, this isn’t out of the blue. I’ve loved you for so long and I’m only sorry that I didn’t tell-- that I didn’t show you earlier.”
“Pull over,” he says.
All he knows is that something inside him has melted away or crumbled or dissolved to the sound of Robert Plant’s too-quiet voice from the radio and Cas’ fucking god-awful whistling, and Dean has had it up to here.
Dean scrambles backwards on his palms, air knocked out of his chest. He can't catch a breath. Not-Cas follows, leans after him. Wrinkles his brow, like they're having a casual conversation. Like he didn't just grind Dean's entire world to a halt. “That’s exactly what I woulda wanted you to say,” Dean says, still gasping, heart hammering. He can't tell what he's saying. He's ten feet off the ground. He's ten feet under. He needs to focus.
-- but he runs his thumb over Dean’s hand and Dean’s quiet. Whatever this is -- if it’s not Cas, and he could be wrong, maybe Dean is wrong and this is really his timeline, maybe he's managed to run out his shit luck, god knows he’s had enough of that -- knows too much. It could keep Dean here forever. It’s playing him like a fiddle.
“Why, so you can
He’s still stoic, but Cas deflates slightly. His eyes soften at the creases and he lets go of Dean’s wrist. “You,” he agrees. “I love you.” He sounds so earnest that Dean’s heart breaks all over again.
Cas peers into the bags. “Nothing. Did you buy even a single vegetable?”
“You’re gross and you owe me,” Sam says, but drags himself out of his chair.
“Yeah. Oh.”
“S’posed to be an angel and you can’t handle a bit of rain?”
“Wanna watch a movie, dude?” Dean tries to ask after dinner. He’s resorted to sneaking up on Cas in his room, blocking his only exit. Cas is seated on the bed, staring blankly at a wall.
It’s miserable outside, gray and shitty and bitter, but the concrete is grounding. Dean thunks his head against the Bunker door, shuts his eyes against the drizzle. Anything not to have to look at this Cas. The trees look real enough. Cas looks real enough. Down to the last detail, he’s Dean’s Cas. Hair like a tornado, eyes like fireworks. He’s even got the smell right. “This ain’t real.”
“Cas,” Dean chokes, and he’s damned. He’s dragging Cas into his body by his trench or maybe he’s dragging himself into Cas but he’s there, in Cas’s heat. In
“Yeah. Yes.”
Cas rolls his eyes. “Sam is going to be upset with you when he gets back.”
He doesn’t think. Cas is driving the Impala, eyes on the road (he’s whistling, actually, Sam has been teaching him how to) and Dean doesn’t know why it’s this Sunday as opposed to any other Sunday this month. As opposed to never.
And then Cas’s face falls, so quick Dean has to wonder if he imagined it, before he smooths it right back out. Perfect neutrality. “Oh, they’re chrysanthemums. These are lovely, Dean.”
“Your girlfriend,” Cas hisses. “Does your girlfriend know that you hunt? This changes things, Dean, you have to recognize that! You’re forty years old, you have responsibilities to people other than yourself, hunts can go wrong, you’re gonna need someone to watch your back, and especially for
Dean brings dinner to the table and spends all of it sneaking glances at Cas over his ramen. Jack asks to go on his sixth walk of the day, Eileen calls to update them on the state of her newly painted walls (courtesy of Sam), and that’s that. But Cas avoids his eyes, nearly drags Jack off to go on his walk the instant the call ends. Leaves Dean sitting at the table with a cold cup of noodles and a cutting sense of disappointment.
“Next on three!” shouts the cashier and Dean is just about to move, having crossed off every item on the list Sam’s texted him (and by "crossed off", he means “ignored”, because Dean will be damned before he becomes an accessory to Sam’s grass-eating agenda) when he glances up from his phone and stops.
“I found a salt-'n-burn a couple hours east from here,” Dean announces at Saturday dinner. It’s true. He did find one, but he scoured the internet for hours first, looking for anything to get him away. He’s going insane. He can’t stand the sorry glances Cas keeps throwing him, the way his chest twinges every time he catches Cas’s eye.  “I’m gonna head out tomorrow morning. Won’t take more than a day.”
He wants to see that look back on Cas’s face. Dean doesn’t want to get away with it. He wants to be caught.
He looks up, and it’s Cas. Love in the folds of his eyes, honesty dripping like rain down his face. “Let me prove it to you,” Cas repeats, low, and brings Dean’s fingers to his lips. “I’ll be here when you wake up tomorrow, and the day after, and for however long you'll let me stay. I’ll tell you every day. And I’ll kiss you every day, if you want that. I’ll-”
Cas looks up from his salad. “I’ll go with you.”
This time, Dean isn’t slow about it. He nearly lunges for Cas, as if he'll fade away if Dean doesn’t reach him fast enough. He clenches his good arm in Cas’ trench, hands shaking, and crashes their mouths together.
“I’ve got you,” Cas tells him, and then he’s wrapping Dean in an embrace, strong arms going around his shoulders. Dean doesn’t know whether to laugh or cry. Only Cas would give him a hug—a honest-to-god, family-friendly
He can’t give them to Kathy—it’s not right. These are Cas’s, whether he knows it or not. And he thinks they look nice in front of Cas when they sit down together. Or that Cas looks nice next to them. Same thing. The yellow makes his eyes stand out.
and Dean will deal with the consequences later.
“Just me,” Cas repeats. “You don’t mean—”
“Dean!” Cas whirls around. He’s holding a towel in one hand and a spatula in the other. Dean doesn’t even try to resist: walks right up to Cas and tucks his free hand into his waist. Cas lets him, easy as pie, and Dean’s almost smiling too hard to properly kiss him. He pulls Cas’s body into his own, sighs into his mouth as Cas wraps his spatula-hand around Dean’s neck. Dean lingers like that for a minute, eyes closed, listening to the sound of pasta water boiling. The feel of Cas’s breath on his cheek.
“Yeah, there was a sale at the store,” he lies, shouldering past Cas. That’s good. That makes sense. He sets the bags down on the table, rolls out his shoulders. “They were only eight dollars, so.”
Dean brings his non-injured hand up to cup Cas’ face, slowly. Runs his thumb over the ever-present stubble. Cas leans into it, unblinking, and Dean leans forward. He closes his eyes, presses their lips together, softly. Almost reverently. Cas’ are chapped, a little rough, just like they look. Dean pulls away, drops his hand.
“Hey, what’s that supposed to mean?”
“Come inside,” Cas says, sitting down next to Dean. “You’re going to catch a cold.”
Dean would’ve jumped at this a week ago. Would’ve done something moronic, like offered to let Cas drive Baby.  “It’s a one-man job, Cas. I’m fine.”
“Goodbye.”
“Yes.”
“What are you talking about?”
He still thinks it would be nice. Cas has parked them on an inside road. Jones Street, Virginia. Dean sees children crossing the street on their skateboards in the afternoon sun. He entertains the fantasy, briefly: Dean, baking pastries and sipping wine, Cas, doing laundry and washing dishes. A cozy white home. It slips away in his mind’s eye. That sort of thing is dangerous. Dean knows—you can’t think about it for too long or it eats you. Pulls your hair out and leaves you dead. That sort of thing isn’t for—
and Dean says
Cas tries to be subtle about it but he’s absolutely ass at pretending he’s not ignoring Dean. He sticks to the weather over breakfast for the second day in a row—
Dean’s mouth opens and closes. He swallows hard, and part of him wonders if he’s been trapped by a Djinn. Looks away, to the house outside his window, and then back to Cas. “What?” he says, stupidly.
He hands over the money, throws the change back at her, and flees the store.
a corner of his mind echoes. Dean is the very picture of repression. Daddy issues, addictive personality. Alcoholic, shitty friend, the entire worthless package.
“Alright,” not-Cas says, and folds his hands together in his lap. “I’ve been in love with you since before I understood what it meant to love another.”
“Alright, well, let me know when you need my tools,” Dean says curtly. He turns to leave. Not like Cas would know a screwdriver from a wrench in the first place.
in the middle of—
Cas yells. Dean pauses.
with a popped ‘p’ to which Cas says nothing—and mumbles an excuse about sorting his laundry before fleeing, oatmeal in hand. He walks out of the rooms Dean walks into, engages Jack in desperate conversation when he can’t.
Whatever they were in the middle of. Dean knows how to handle sex. This is something different. This is new, this is intimacy: Cas is holding him. Like a lover. Still, Dean can’t stop himself from melting into it, pressing his face into Cas’ neck and inhaling. It feels too good. He’s surrounded by Cas. His clothes, his smell, his muscles. Even with no mojo, he’s stronger than Dean and Sam put together. Almost human. It figures: Cas has never done a single thing normally in his life. Can’t even become a proper, weak human. He does it his way, the stubborn bastard.
“Cas,” Dean says. “Just pull over. Please.”
He dreams in yellow that night: Cas bursting out of a chrysanthemum like a birthday cake except that he’s not naked. He’s holding a bouquet of his own in gloved hands—roses—and he shows them to Dean before vanishing each flower behind a hanky. Dean watches his fingers a little too closely, trying to catch the moment the rose disappears, but when he looks up after the last flower—
“Why?” Cas asks, glancing at him. “Does your arm hurt? I can get more gauze from the—”
And now he’s blaming Cas for, for responding reasonably. If their places were reversed and Cas treated Dean like shit and locked him out, over and over, and then dumped his enormous, ugly feelings on him right when he got a moment of peace—
Dean glares. It lines up, but he’s been in timelines that line up before. Don’t mean it’s his and it don’t mean it’s real.
“Jack, can you please give us a moment,” Cas says, his expression shuttered, and then they’re alone.
Dean grimaces. “Uh. I—no, it’s. I mean, we—”
“In that case,” Cas says, laughing now, and Dean’s laughing too, “let me kiss you.” And Dean does.
“Yes.”
He thinks he owes Cas a response. A response in words. But Dean doesn’t think he can make that declaration yet. It doesn’t come easy to him, like it seems to for Cas. It doesn’t seem like enough to tell him with his hands or lips, now.
This little grocery store has a flower section. It’s a small sort of nook, tucked—crammed, more like—into a corner behind the check-outs, and it’s charming in the way that everything in this small town is charming. It’s loud and colorful and intense. Dean’s got no real reason to bother. He’s never really been a flowers kind of guy. He doesn’t send them and he sure as hell doesn’t get them, but.
Not-Cas frowns at him. “This is real, Dean. Please, let’s at least discuss this inside.”
Not-Cas ignores him. “Let me prove it to you. We’ll go through it together,” and Dean’s about to snap at him,
Dimly, it occurs to Dean that is what he wanted. This is Cas catching him. This is the chase. He just needs to run a little bit slower.
“Dean,” says Cas, quiet. He can feel the weight of Cas’ gaze on him. He thinks Cas never really learned not to stare, even after all these years. “What was that for?”
“Right now?”
“What are you talking about—you can’t be serious. It’s only three ‘o’ clock!”
It’s just his luck that there’s no trash can outside. And that there’s no more space in Baby’s backseat, and that he’s not enough of a caveman to put the flowers on the floor. So they’re stuck in the passenger seat next to him, horrifyingly bright and garish and mocking against the black leather.
Sam sputters, “it has been
“Yes. I just said that.”
He pulls back, but keeps their faces close, pants into the air between them. His fingers flex where they grip Cas’ coat. “Cas,” he breathes, and it comes out more broken than he intended.
He is not going to think about it. He turns up Zeppelin, rolls down the window, taps his fingers on the wheel. Concentrates on the road.
“Yeah,” Dean says, rubbing the back of his neck. He doesn’t have time to get any further than that before Cas yanks him back in, and that’s just fine. Dean’s doing just fine.
“Is it so hard for you to believe that I want you?” not-Cas asks. Dean looks up again, fucking moth to a fucking flame, and this thing is looking at him like Dean is breaking his heart. Swallowing over and over like Dean stuck a rock in his throat. It’s too fucking real. It’s too much.
He sees chrysanthemums, yellow and bright and tall, and he thinks—Cas. He thinks of Cas.
“—I know I’m not the most experienced, I know I was an angel, but I understand the significance of these things, and I want you to be happy,” Cas is still saying, and maybe this has always been the chase. Maybe all that’s left to do—all that has ever been left to do—is up to Dean.
Silence fell between them, and Cas just awkwardly stood there, stood there watching Dean smile as he read the label on the pie box. He noticed the leather jacket he was wearing, and the jeans, which was messily cuffed. He was wearing lilac bunny slippers for some reason, and Castiel found himself smiling at that. Maybe he hadn’t unpacked everything yet.
The voice startled him so much that he fell forward onto his hands and knees.
Cas raised a brow at his words.
The poor fry.
A short summary or being utterly head over heals in love with Dean Winchester, by Castiel Winchester.
Finally, he couldn’t hold it back anymore, and what gushed through his nostrils wasn’t air.
"Dean!" Cas called his name again, and then he kissed him.
“Here,” Cas pulled a tissue out from his jeans’ pocket, “let me.”
He smiled at him, and Dean watched the light in his eyes dance. It was mesmerizing.
Cas opened his notebook to an empty page.
Cas wasn’t any of that. He wasn’t a stranger. He wasn’t a friend. He wasn’t family.
He just…
He couldn’t be happier if he wanted to.
It wasn’t at her place, to start with. This house was smaller than hers, and so, more packed. Then they ran out of booze half an hour ago, and there was someone sent to get more but they hadn’t come back yet. And to make it worse, a lot of straight people had found their way here, and now he was stuck on the couch, sandwiched between two girls who were only talking to each other.
“No?” Dean pushed himself up, and pulled his phone out of his pocket.
Hi, with a wave—no the wave would look awkward. Maybe just a smile?
Three people bumped into them on their way in, and Dean pulled his ear away from Meg’s mouth as she yelled at them to be civil.
He saw dean’s lips move, but he didn’t hear what he was saying.
Dean did not—even for one moment—believe that this was a Meg Masters’ Party.
“Nothing,” Cas shook his head, and wiped the smile off his face. “You look very happy with both of them.”
It was really alluring.
He couldn’t win an argument with her. Never had. Only Jo could do that, and that was because she was—according to Ellen— ‘more like her late father’.
It was true when they said that the neighborhood watch knew everything about you. Everything, even when you just moved into the neighborhood.
“They did huh?” Dean shook his head, chuckling again.
“Seriously? With Donnie?” Dean laughed, remembering the last class he had with the professor he had saved as ‘TMNT’ in his phone. Apparently that was last semester.
He was heaven’s most beautiful angel, with his messed up black hair, pretty baby blue eyes, sharp jaw, and the ginese—guiness… how do they spell it? Guinness? Yes—Guinness World Record of the world’s most contagious smile. That was Cas.
He couldn't swallow them whole.
“Good,” Cas nodded, getting up and pocketing his phone, “let’s go.”
Then he did his little nod, as if it was the wax seal on the argument.
What? What did he just say? Why did he just say? That could’ve been a thought! Why? Who was trying to drown him in this soda? He wasn’t a fry! Why?!
“That’s miracle,” Dean said, his freckles very visible.
“I have keys,” Cas suggested. His house keys could work.
It took him back to the time he had first placed his head on Cas’ chest.
He hadn’t known that Cas worked out, but then again, he didn’t know anything about what Cas did and didn’t, so it didn’t matter.
Castiel placed the small plastic cup of ketchup in front of Dean from over his shoulder.
“Home?”
With that, he pointed to the nearest empty seat, and Dean sat down with a groan next to the silent student; Cas Novak. The guy smelled suspiciously like a library and a firewood, which kept Dean awake for the rest of the class.
Dean nodded.
With that, she pushed past dean, and he bumped into the fridge and hit his head.
He looked again out the window, and there he was, walking back into his house.
The color of forget-me-nots, he remembered having said once. That was so long ago, that he barely remembered where exactly that was. he was just a kid then. Not even in his teens. All he remembered was the kid he was with, and the bunch of flowers in Dean’s hands which they had just plucked.
“Discord; CaffiNATEd, sorry to interrupt, but you guys reeeeeeally need to know what my mom just said
Then he saw the next thing Dean put up on the shelf, and his heart dropped.
That’s what he was; an angel.
“Dean,” Cas put his elbows on his knees and leaned forward, tilting his head a little, “you texted me—and I quote—I have fries, bring ketchup, third bench, café. I had a class with Professor Donatello in—” he paused to pull his phone out of his pocket, and check the time— “five minutes ago, which I am missing because I’m here.”
He mentally face palmed again.
“So,” he cleared his throat, this time to gain Dean’s attention, immediately regretting it because those green eyes on him made him feel funny on the inside “Have you unpacked yet?”
Dean reached into his mind, and focused his eyes on Cas’.
He looked up at Cas again, who was now looking at the wall in front of him. His eyes made him feel like he was laying under the summer sky. His breath smelled like mint, probably from brushing teeth. His hair fell over his forehead like a vine on a ledge.
On hyper days, I find him coming back from work, and then immediately running to the kitchen to cook something. He kneads the dough, and we make pizza, or sometimes, just bread—Jack doesn’t mind eating both. If not that, he does the dishes, and then he does all the dishes in the house, and still looks like he can do more. In that case, I ask him if he can sort out the closet. Sometimes, he does that, sometimes he just pulls out a box of strings, and makes bracelets.
The rain that had started pouring outside backed up his excuse.
How did Cas know it was half an hour?
“At least don’t harm your pretty ones in the process,” he requested, and she laughed and kissed his cheek at that.
He would never admit it to Ellen.
Dean pulled the handsfree out of one ear.
He sat up, but he couldn’t do it properly, because Cas’ grip on Dean’s hands was too tight. He was stuck on his back under Cas, his hands held over his head.
“There’s no problem in that,” Cas decided to look somewhere else. Where? Um… table. Table looked good. “We’re not doing much today anyways.”
"Cas?" He called again but his voice wasn't anywhere to be found. The water coming out of him had cut it out.
Dean sat there, pinned to the floor by the bag, face to face with Cas. Finally, the two of them were alone. They could exist together now. Cas didn’t need food or air, and now, so did Dean. There was nothing here that could disturb them. No flying birds, or passing cars. No wind, no light—nothing.
“You can just put these here,” Cas suggested, holding a box of tumblers, pointing to the cabinet above the shelves, “then put that set of fancy plates next to it.”
“No,” he nodded, putting on his teaching face. He needed to keep his head straight, even when he was very gay.
“Huh?” he shook his head to clear it.
About the name, he managed to make it worse for himself.
He did the same to this traitor.
“Don’t lie to me.” Ellen said sharply. Then her voice softened, “besides, having someone in your life won’t do any harm. And he” she gestured to the window again, “seems very single.”
“He seems wonderful,” Cas commented, watching the dog sniff a box and then jumping behind it.
“Seriously,” she got up, “I’m telling you. Take something to his house, and offer him help with the boxes or whatever. You,” she gestured to his face and then his body, “can make any man gay if you bate your eyelashes.”
The pain of the water rushing into his body through the windpipe was unbearable. It was like it carried sharp razors, cutting him up inside as it went. He found this pain worse that he had felt when he had dug the raised into the inside of his arm. Unlike that time though, there was no blood. It was all neat and clean.
Cas reversed the movements of his fingers. It felt really good.
"You're welcome."
They had moved back into living room, after the kitchen. Cas had offered to put up the curtains while Dean put things into his shelf and on the mantle.
He didn’t have to hold back long.
Dean huffed a laugh, and then Cas heard his chair move.
That’s when it occurred to Dean. He pulled his head back to ask Cas if he wanted that, but he seemed a little busy grinding his hips into Dean’s hand, looking like he was getting close to climax.
“I don’t think so,” Cas told him, admiring how talented Dean was. He had read about kids who were like that, but never seen it in real life. The most Cas did when he was in school was speech and debate.
“I thought you had a headache.” Cas nibbled at his ear, and Dean felt his hot breath on his skin.
Dean always liked when he did that. He liked Cas’s arms, and the button up shirt he wore didn’t really hide them. Or his shoulders. Or—
“And here I was,” he said, “thinking it was bad in classes.”
Because they weren’t held at his sides, Dean’s arms started to float upwards.
Even under the water, someone didn't like that he was asleep.
Cas lowered himself, beside Dean, and Dean felt his fingers graze up his side and settle on his cheek. Cas pulled Dean’s face towards himself, and Dean kissed his lips back really slowly, just savoring the feeling of them.
He placed the phone, face down, on the table in front of him.
The pressure of the air inside him was now a little too much to be ignored.
“I must admit,” he mumbled pecking Dean’s lips and then settling between his legs. “I like being on top.”
Please say no, he thought. I can’t breathe around you, Please, please, please, please—
Dean felt like reaching up to scratch the stubble on his cheeks with his nails. Not hard enough to leave a mark; only just enough to feel the rough surface under his nails. He imagined it would make the scratchy sound he often listened to before he slept on his headphones. He really liked the way it caused a little tingle at the back of his head. Would he hear it now? or would he have to lift his head closer? He should be able to, seeing that it was quiet enough in the room. There was only one way to find out, and it was to do it.
Dean didn't have to open his eyes to know that it was Cas.
Just as he had leaned down Cas pulled back just enough to be able to see Dean’s face. He knew what Cas saw; a flustered boy looking like he was about to pass out. Cas didn’t seem to mind that though.
Once again, Dean didn't have anything anymore.
“Do it,” Cas growled just before he shot onto Dean’s stomach, and that pushed Dean over the edge too.
Other times, when he wakes up before me, it is finding his clear green eyes staring at my face as his hand gently caresses my cheek, or plays with a strand of my hair, or traces my lips. No movement rough enough to wake me up; no movement gentle enough to not be felt. Then, when I am awake, it is the beautiful smile that slowly forms on his face, and the first words that come out his mouth are “hey, Cas.”
“That,” sings Dean, swatting Sam’s head as he passes by, “ain’t your problem. Now. Scram. Get lost. Big plans today.”
“But. You don’t,” Dean falters. “I mean. You can. Me?”
Dean doesn’t—
“I have to know,” Cas says, except this time it’s even deeper than his usual rumble. “Please, Dean. Why did you do that?”
That was for a lot of things. That was for coming when Dean calls, that was for being the best friend Dean has ever had. It was for staying, finally, after everything. For choosing Dean. For coming back to him.
“She’ll love ‘em, honey,” she interrupts, laughing. “Can I wrap these for you?”
“The girlfriend that you bought the flowers for,” Cas says, glaring daggers.
“The real Cas would never--” Dean looks down. Tries to steady his hands where they’re shaking. "He wouldn’t have, okay? I know Cas. You blew it. I’m gonna gank you soon, I just gotta think here for a minute."
You can’t give yourself up, normally, can’t tell your enemy you’re onto them. Dean shouldn’t be letting this fucking-- whatever, shouldn’t be letting whatever it is next to him wearing Cas’s face know that Dean knows. But it’s got Dean by the balls: he can’t pretend, not for this. He can’t be angry. Fuck, he can barely even think.
Cas reaches for his shoulder but drops his hand, rerouting towards his wrist. He holds it loosely, so Dean can break away without any effort at all. His voice is uneven. “I don’t always … understand you. Humans. In this sort of thing. I have to know what you want from me. You have to spell it out for me.”
“Dean!”  Cas growled —
“The Pizza Man’s Men.”  Cas replied matter of factly.
“—Wait a minute.” Metatron said aloud to himself as he flicked through the pages rapidly, going back and re-reading a section. “That doesn’t make sense, the timeline is all wrong… What could possibly have happened here?” Metatron wondered as he leaned back. A large smile crept across his face. Oh there was something here all right. And he just needed to find out what.
Sam’s defenses went up and he was ready to throw back a scathing retort to mask his disbelief, but then he took a deep breath, because yes, he did learn something from all the shit that went down, and so he reined in the anger.
Dean’s face paled a bit, and he put a hand up against where his mortal wound had been. He was about a half a second from leaving, but Sam put a hand on his shoulder, gently guiding him into a chair. “Relax, Dean. We’re just going to talk, okay? I promise.” Sam said, handing him a beer.
Hi everyone, I hope you all are safe and healthy.   I have a shorter chapter for you tonight but I think you will be happy with the new arrival.
I actually wrote the last part of the chapter at the beginning of the story and couldn't wait to be able to post it because let's face it, even though you'all are probably really upset with me right now, its a great cliffhanger but I found myself really nervous now that it was time to post hence why its late.  Please go easy on me.
“Woah, hold up!”  Dean exclaimed.  The bright red blush increased in intensity, vibrant as it traveled down his face, neck, and chest.  “Cas, you can’t just say stuff like that.”
Dean gets help from a surprising place.
Well here we go, the last two chapters and the epilogue.   Nothing really triggering in this chapter.
See end for triggers.  I hope everyone has a good holiday and stay safe and healthy!
It made Sam feel angry and despondent that they still hadn’t figured out how to get that Mark off Dean’s arm.  Some really bad hunts had forced them to bring the First Blade out and after each use Dean’s control wavered more.  Then there was that awful two week period that Sam was still mostly in the dark about, but since then Dean has been slipping fast.
I know everyone was upset that Crowley and Benny let John go and didn't say anything.  Crowley stopped Benny because he knew it is what Dean would have wanted and Benny realized that too so don't be too hard on them.  Its also not how I want Sam to find out.
See end for notes.
Dean smiled lighting up his beautiful face and despite Dean choosing to leave him, Death felt a warmth spread through him at the sight.  This boy was so special.  Feeling himself close to the last of his energy and ability to stay here, Death twisted his ring.
Sam sat down next to Dean. Like that, they sat together in silence for a few minutes. It was Sam who broke it first. “So that was you, when I got shot?” Sam asked.
This chapter was really long so I split it in two.  I will try to post the other half tonight or tomorrow.
“I’m sorry, Sam. I just — well, you know, whatever. I’ll take off. I didn’t mean to trespass.” Dean said. He was steadfastly looking anywhere but at Sam, not sure that in his fragile and emotional state that he could handle the coldness or scorn that was for sure to be in Sam’s eyes.
“He’s in the “Dean Cave” playing on Queenie with Crowley.”  The angel said using air quotes and Sam snorted.  It was really amusing how the angel was incapable of saying the Dean Cave without using air quotes and it made Sam chortle every time.  Crowley just rolled his eyes but Dean would just look at his angel with this sappy smile and more often than not they would disappear for a few hours.   It was sickening Sam thought although he couldn’t be happier for his brother.
“Nobody likes a tattle tale.” A deep voice said — and the demon exploded into gray dust. Dean's eyes jerked toward the new threat as the Mark pulsed so hard he thought it might break through the band. Dean's eyes met the icy blue eyes of Cain as he strode into the bar. He never broke eye contact with Dean as he grabbed two demons and tore them apart— literally. The last demon tried to smoke out but Cain, finally looking away from Dean, put a hand into the smoke and jammed it right back into its meat suit. Dean cringed as Cain cut and hacked at the demon.
It had been six months since Dean’s deal with Crowley, and so far things have been okay.  Dean did hate a lot of things — but they were just minor annoyances. He hated wearing the leather pants and tight shirts, but Crowley was insistent on that. Still, Crowley let Dean stay in the beach house and Dean only went to hell when he was needed for something; a meeting, a judgment, or a challenge.  So Dean could compromise on the smaller stuff.
”  Crowley cursed horrified when he recognized the weird sensation in his stomach as guilt.  He was the bloody king of hell; he shouldn’t be feeling guilt over a tiny, well okay not exactly tiny, manipulation on his part especially if it got him what he wanted.
Cas turned back to his cup. It was a nice ceramic mug; blue with a green handle. It seemed slightly bigger than Cas’s own mugs. Maybe he could go and buy one like this for himself?
“You like that?” he breathed against his lips and Dean nodded.
Finally, he decided to check for locked doors.
Ellen turned around and slapped his shoulder.
“Twitter; skull emoji, GOmens era; I didn’t think that could happen lol lol omg”
Cas shook his head.
He walked over to the bed, and sat at the edge of it. Despite the fact that his head was still pounding and all he wanted to do was lay down, he didn't. He did not want to ruin the neatly made bed.
Oh. It dawned on him.
“You got overwhelmed.” Cas said again.
“Mmhmm?” Cas kissed him back, but pulled back to stifle a moan when Dean started moving his hand slowly at first on his shaft.
Hi, with a smile, I am Castiel, and I live across the street. I thought I should stop by to welcome you to the neighborhood.
He put the fry in his mouth.
He found that he still couldn’t take it very far, so he didn’t take his hand away from his mouth, and Cas only seemed to like that, so he tried not to think about it, until Cas pulled back and away from his hands.
Was showing him the notifications not enough? Did he not see that it was all going on without him? He was left out, and it was all so fast that he didn’t know where to step in. everyone was talking about themselves, promoting themselves, expressing themselves. It was like they were all actually just talking to themselves. If not themselves, just one single person in a crowd of single people.
He just placed his hands on Cas’ shoulders, feeling him grind his hips on Dean’s body. His chest muscles were hard under dDan’s hand. His stomach was firm, and—
What the fuck did he just do???
What was he thinking?
“This is better.” Dean smiled.
Cas held the door open for Dean to step through, and then closed it behind him.
"You're not," Cas cut him off, "I promise. In fact..." He reached behind him to grab a pillow, and changes his sitting position, "I can give you a massage," he said, and placed the pillow on his lap, and patted it.
“It’s my pleasure,” he said, not stopping.
He looked up one last time at Cas to see if he believed him—he didn’t seem to—and kissed the base of his shaft to assure him. The hair tickled his nose. Slowly, he kissed his way up to the tip, and rolled his tongue around the swollen head. It tasted salty.
Ellen’s words were stuck inside his head, with the image of the guy across the street, and it kept causing him to stop in front of every window that faced the front to look outside.
And after that, whenever he couldn’t decide something, he would just ask Cas.
That made Cas a little flustered for many reasons; some of them being Dean calling him by his full name, and Dean nodding right away whenever he would suggest something.
He didn’t want to disturb anyone talking to anyone. He didn’t want anyone to stop their happy day and listen to his sad-boy thoughts. Not internet strangers, not friends, not family.
Here he was. Finally, at peace in Cas' arms.
Cas looked at the fires, and then back up at him.
There was a shift in Cas’s jaw.
Cas was just a few years younger in it. Dean didn't know the rest of the people, but they were all holding five different flags. Cas--in the middle-- held the rainbow flag. The transgender flag and non-binary flag stood to his right, and the bisexual flag and asexual flag stood to the left. Cas looked radiant with his grin, and flushed face. It seemed like they had been doing something beforehand. Running? Jumping?
The student is Dean Winchester...
Busted.
And that thought bought him back to why he was here.
"Dean!" It was a familiar voice, but it wasn't Cas.
Cas took a deep breath, and put the phone to his ear.
“Castiel?” Dean called him.
Finally, Cas thought, making his feet move.
An ache was starting to form in Dean’s head, so he looked for somewhere that was relatively quiet. There were people making out on the staircase, so it would be quiet, but right under it was the beer-pong match, so that was off the list quick. The dining room was the dancefloor, and the music was the loudest in there, definitely a no. Was there any place upstairs?
“There’s too many people,” he added, and she shook her head.
“Cas,” he managed to say but only his breath came out. He wanted to add an I’m sorry after that, but the words died at his tongue.
Cas turned around, and a pulled a chair for himself too, making sure that there was a chair still between them.
"There were people everywhere else," he said as an apology. "I needed to breathe."
“Deano!!!” someone clapped on his back, “Where’s the strings bro?”
Maybe if he put it away from himself?
He would have small talk, and then they’ll conversate over unpacking.
He was...
The way to Gas’nSip was just a five-minute’s walk, and Nora nearly yelled at him for coming in while he was supposed to be home.
Of course this was Cas' room. The starry ceiling, the number of overflowing bookshelves, the tidy floor, fresh air. This was exactly where he had imagined Castiel living.
Cas read all of them one by one.
It pricked his finger a little when he fixed the pin.
I have ten of them now, that were made "only and only" for me to wear. Others are for Jack, two for miracle, some get sent to Sam and Eileen, and Rowena absolutely adores them, so gets sent the most.
He lifted his arm up, and took a breath of release when the only thing he smelled was the deodorant.
“What do you mean you can’t?” Ellen frowned, “You know you can do him, and do it really well.”
I hope you liked! Drop your thoughts in the comments, I wanna know!
Dean turned to look back at him.
"It went like this," he continued, as he placed the pill in Dean's hand, and then climbed onto the bed to grab a water bottle from the other side, "‘You know what 'fine' stands for right? Fucked up, insecure, neurotic, and emotional.’" He handed the bottle to Dean. "And I really like that dialogue."
“I knew it!”
He was. A little.
His body seemed to have other ideas.
“Careful,” Cas laughed, “the poor thing will get bruised.”
Under the water, everything was his favourite color; the one of vast oceans and clear skies, glowing in the whatever moonlight filtered onto the pool from the skylight.
“Yes,” Cas’s mouth was dry, he cleared his throat too, “Yes.”
Ugh!!! Dean thought. No!!!
Then he heard the whisper, “closer,” and he did just that. Now he was close enough that his nose brushed against Cas’ arm. On that, Cas lifted his arm and asked him to come even closer, and then, they ended up with Cas’ arms around Dean, and Dean’s head on Cas’ chest.
Either way, he mentally sighed, he was straight. That picture was the proof.
It is in waking up next to him, and finding him gently snoring, his face pressed into the bed because somewhere in the night his pillow fell off it, and now there’s a small circle of drool by his lips. It is in the way his eyebrows shoot up as he inhales sharply when I push gently on his shoulder, and he groans as he yawns and stretches like a cat in the bed. In the end, he finds the most uncomfortable position, mumbles “Cas, you stole my pillow,” and falls back asleep.
The phone buzzed in his pocket, disturbing the ABBA song blasting in his ears.
