"I'm sorry, Father". This was said with so much guilt John found it endearing.
in order to resuscitate the man who much better than these scumbags. It boils John’s blood to acknowledge that Sherlock went down just because he was alone fighting the spider while he could have the entire New Scotland Yard, Mycroft, Molly, and himself. It makes him crying on the way to Ireland, he feels so alone.
John thought he was in the deep of pacific ocean. He was drown, surrounded by water, pressed by constant wave. He was drown but it didn't feel dying; he felt serene, peaceful, safe. Like the purpose of the water not hurting him but healing him.
John thinks. Finishing the summoning call by pricking his right palm with the blade into the grave soil bowl, the blood creates the imagery of a sperm that bestows upon the grail to create a new life. It is sizzling which John knows that it should not be that, it does not make sense at all, then the candles flickering in circle emotion while in far away he tries to identify what sound is that,
As the ringing bell inside his body rings, John kicks himself into action and brings himself out of Battersea Power Station. He will get an early train to Baker Street and he will think about how in the hell name he can collect 300 souls to bring Sherlock back. For now, he needs the energy given by their home.
"I know it is late, John, but if you don't mind, I would like extend my gratitude with a cup of hot tea and a space to clean yourself up at my flat before I send you home. Any objection?". This was said with so much careful intonation and color spread on man's cheeks.
Sometimes John thinks perhaps Sherlock will turn up not dead as well but then he remembers it was himself who examined Sherlock’s pulse and it was himself who closed the coffin and buried him. He was not crazy when he still could identify Sherlock’s battered head and that curls, wherever he sees it he will know it by heart. In this place where the revelation showed, maybe John will find his own discovery as well, either go home like a loser and stamped himself as clinically a madman or go big finding demon is real and sacrifice anything to get Sherlock back.
"My name is Sherlock Holmes. I am the father of the boy you saved. What's your name?". The man, Sherlock, kept his stride in check to sooth John's aggression. The growl stilled Sherlock at arm-length to John and with a graceful movement, Sherlock ungloved his right hand and reached out to touch John. John snarled and recoiled a feet away that surprised the team behind the dark haired man.
After felt like long minutes in recovering himself, John ran to the little boy and crouched down in front of him. In eye level, John rummages his hands on kid's scalp and arms. Found no harm on the child, John hugged the kid tight to his chest and swayed his body a little.
"Hey!"
. The will gives a right of everything to John with the amount of money and assets that he does not know what to do with them all, and the trunk – clothes and books of the detective, was opened late because apparently depression from loss, making him tired all the time and bed was his own best friend now.
It was dark, colour of indigo, the dark before full moon, with breeze and crickets. It was dark, like laying on his back in his childhood bedroom with light illuminated his ceiling from lamp post outside. Home. Safe. Secured.
'Green'
"That’s not what people normally say to my father, maman"
(See the end of the chapter for
This time John pulls all the bravery he has within him,
In the breeze of the wind, the smell of upcoming people closer to the alley bristled John's raw emotion. He still saw red on his periphery and the kid's agitation was not decreasing in any moment. John hid the little boy behind his back when two men approached his alley, completed with a team that resembled cops.
The little boy squeezed his stomach before he ran to the man with dark long coat. They seemed in talk for a moment with that man checked on child's body for injuries. John felt so empty and so lost. He realized of his surrounding, three men with blood pooled under their dead bodies and splatter of red liquids on his hands and jacket. He gritted his teeth and wiped his eyes with the sleeve of his jacket. Tears started to lurk on his eyes, threatened to fall by the emptiness he never had a claim to call his.
"Piss off’!"
"Sorry for the blood" he uttered shamefully that if it wasn't for the man's fast reflex he wiped the blood on his work pants.
'My love, I am going to sit and let you sit on my lap, I am going to unbind the bond. Are you ready?'
Yes, he misses the detective so much, it’s hurt.
in Belgrade where everything so quiet. Maybe they know his coming or maybe they already fled to other countries, nonetheless, John needs to find out either information or souls. He is eager to finish this demon deal that he bounces on his heels. It’s cliche like a movie sometimes how the men suddenly come to him and fight him mercilessly, yet the combination of Captain’s skill and additional demonic skill ensure him to combat his enemies and take their souls away.
explains the demon that doesn’t cover the smugness that reverberates through his skull.
"Pah. And where is your manner, Timothee, to the man who saved you? And calling maman to others can be considered impolite you know". The man chastised the child without real sting but purely concern and embarassment.
Estranged is underestimated word for describing his friendship with Greg now. Since Sherlock’s fall, he’s been avoiding Greg and Mycroft like a plague. The betrayal and the sadness when he senses them around him are overwhelming that he can’t help himself to feel angrier. Yet, those two men always tried to coax John into meeting them until Harry spoke for him and left them threatened.
Greg appears in the doorway with a bundle of case files on his arm, he stops when he looks at John. Hesitation is as clear as day when he tries to muster a word for giving the case files which are considered as classified.
John preened and satisfied in himself the way Sherlock made himself secured and beautiful. He batted his eyelashes to the taller man and said with his croak voice 'only for you, Sherlock'. The blinding smile John received could lighten the rest of his life of sunrise, contentment, and love. Sherlock put his forehead against his and the palm on John's base of throat grounded him more from subspace. The huff on his face, with his eyes closed John knew what was that, Sherlock whispered 'mine, mine, mine'. Like John would ever forget that. He smiled and muttered back 'yours, yours, yours'.
no mocking tone riles him up as the desired companion at the moment. It makes him sad and lonely so whenever there is a lump on his throat like avocado stone tries to choke him off and smother him at the moment, he tries to focus that he will bring Sherlock back, no matter what.
“What’s wrong John?” Greg asks with so much concern, it makes John hard to ask.
“Hold your tongue, mortal. I am your Lord and your Protector. And well, well, well..a soldier begs a life for other man? Is he your comrade in arms..or is he your
page, a falcon-headed man that depicted as God of War in Egyptian belief. His finger traces the falcon shaped like the head on the page with his heart is tugged in the description of this God. John asks himself why God can be put on Demonology book, but apparently, it is possible when one’s God creates so much destruction that He wills to pass the power of damnation to those who seek. Then, as if lightning streaks on the bells all over John’s nervous systems, he remembers clearly the sermon he received when he was a little blonde boy in Aberdeen,
Little padded reverberated to John's hearing that he peeked behind the man's big hand. It was the child, looked up to John with adoration written all over his small face that John couldn't help but return it with smile. He held big orange blanket in his arm while the other linked to his father's right leg.
Listening to the conversation stores too much anger in John that he doesn’t know what to do with that but marching to the guards and before they realized what happens, John slashes their throats in one swift motion, and the blade glows red and flushing. It’s reaching 300 soon and he doesn’t need a demon to swipe all these scumbags from the earth.
There is a man on a dark horse with long braided black hair and golden armor covered up his bulky figure under the heat of Egypt’s sun that if John sees this scene on painting, that man will become the main character with his glory and fierce attribute. That man turns his head to look at John and with the same fierceness he shows to his enemies, he shouts “GET OUT” to John that rattles the doctor to close his eyes and he throws back to the present of the gruesome manor with the iron smell in the air.
. There is a heavy breath and shouting mess that he believes coming from himself. If he can borrow Sherlock’s metaphor for his killing boredom, he will say that this pain turns his bones rattled and flesh outward. Then, his eyes are hurt so bad he tries to close it,
John inhaled deeply and shit, the little boy might not have acknowledged his gender but John knew he would be Omega. He heaved another breath to focus his scattered distress all over his mind in order to free the little boy. His pulse accelerated as he counted the men in front of him. The man in the middle was Beta while the others were Alpha. The Alphas growled while the Beta man's eyes gleamed with malice. This would be a street fight that probably injured John more than what he already had, but he couldn't just walk away and left the little omega boy by himself.
The adrenaline pumped into his blood sending red to his eyes that he tried hard to keep his feral at bay. John didn't want to drown himself with instinct until he forgot which one the enemy and which one was not. He reached Captain rank with calculation anyway rather than the thirst for blood from everyone who thought Omega was weak.
As it could be seen by Greg's team, Sherlock ushered John and Timothee out of the alley to the highway with his hand behind John's back and Timothee held John's hand tight. Greg had feeling that finally someone can reign two chaotic storms personified in one man and one boy with the leash of love and loyalty. He couldn't wait to see them the next day, who knew happy announcement would be very soon from Sherlock. Who knew.

John cries out in terror as the falcon-headed shadow calls him in his many voices. He is a doctor and he can tell a tale of a heart attack if John does not manage his fear soon. It is petrifying as hell that he did not expect this, well John never expects something until he faces it. But with the firm will of Captain Watson’s personality, he locks his fear in the box and keeps it deep down, so deep in the well of

“I am so –
John was stuttered in surprise. No one could see his past profession nowadays without he told them beforehand, and yet this stranger could see right through him. It was marvelous.
He drew another of those great, rattling breaths before turning his eyes to the boy again, then saw the older version of the boy in front of him. This man who was still raising his hands with palms open up in peace gesture stepped forward slowly to John.
How much John will to give to Demon in exchange of Sherlock's revival?
demon says in lusty baritone, full of promising and satisfaction.
'Darling, I will drag the chair here and bring you water, all right? What colour do you have now?'
It’s been weeks of falcon brain keep switching into action whenever he comes to buildings owned by criminals that he can’t help but now he can draw sigil with his eyes closed. The blood of the leader in criminal ring of ‘provider of false identity and fraud’ is sprayed on John’s face that he grimaces badly and hopes demon will protect him from infection or he will need shot somewhere in Cologne where he doesn’t understand a single word the people talk around him unless he has his own translator.
Sherlock took a deep breath as if braced himself from the punch that probably would come to his way. "I'm not going to hurt you". He said tenderly and bowed his head with his eyes closed. The hand was unanswered on the air until one soft cheek landed on the man's palm. The whining sound was followed by the sniff.
he thinks.
One down, two to go. The Beta came through his right side with knife that looked like scalpel in his clinic sharpened by bones that the lights illuminated dangerously on its tip. For a while John swayed his body to avoid the slash. The woosh sound emanated as the knife broke the seam on his parka jacket near his abdominal. So close that the little boy in the arms of Alpha thug screamed hoarsely.
'I am ready'.
“Sherlock. I buried you here and I am so sorry to take a part of your resting home for my crazy plan, a madman who lost his best friend is who I am now Sherlock. I wish there is a thing called moving forward, but you cut the heal once you died, you infuriating man. I wish I can say more of the things you deserve to hear when you were alive, but even now I still cannot do it. I refuse to let you go, Sherlock, I refuse to give up on you. A bloke cannot sustain alone with too much misery. I promise I will bring you back”. John keeps wiping Sherlock’s tombstone while crying, and if breeze answers his plea he will think it is just the autumn wind.
It is like an abandoned warehouse,
He cleared his throat before answering the man's question before. "My name is John. John Watson". He gave the taller man a nod with his eyes casted down. It was considered inappropriate for Omega to stare eye to eye with Alpha. But then the gloved hand took his chin and let John knew the smile that plastered on the man's handsome face.
He didn't even hesitate anymore to answer like those early times they did this. Sherlock made sure he always spoke his feeling and thoughts freely. The years of repressed feeling made him frustrated at first, but slowly, with Sherlock's patience -- the feature that still perplexed John taking Sherlock's occasional tantrum into consideration, he told him what he liked and what not. At Sherlock's part, he took it seriously and respected his 'no' as well as he treasured his 'yes'.
He texted Greg to meet him in the pub near Baker Street and not surprised to find the silver-haired man seated on the nearby window. It sends a memory of Sherlock and him, whenever the detective deigned the blogger a time to eat outside their flat, he will choose a seat near the window.
First thing first, he cleans the mess of the summoning ritual and put the things back on the duffel bag he spare in his backpack. His eyes spotted the blade that still lies on the floor without its scabbard. It is as long as kitchen’s knife but with a quarter round of moon, it glistens with the light that can mirror John’s face with his black eyes,
He blinks his eyes so many times and keeps seeing the black eyes watch him back on the camera.
Remembering the negotiation, John still wonders how the bloody hell he will get 300 souls, fast and without so much heavy conscience burdening on his moral as a doctor with that oath and so on. Then as if luck on his side never leaves him, his phone vibrates and Greg’s message shows up
Sometimes he impulsively guts the men who like harassing women in the alley that if it is not for the ashes corpses he leaves, he might be called as a serial vigilante by now.
John pulls his phone out of his pocket and turns the front camera on his face. He shouts in surprise when he sees that
"This is the blood of men who wanted to hurt my child. I won't let it dirt your clothes more". The deep baritone voice honeyed with concern flattered John that made him blushing like damsel in distress. The man took out large handkerchief from one of many pockets on his coat and cleaned the blood from his hands. The touch was so gentle, John willed down the purr which enclosed his throat.
Although he is not stupid enough to not know the people Mycroft places around Harry’s flat to watch Watson siblings like it would be enough to mend his broken heart
“Fuck no no no no..” he tries to shake himself and thumps the chest to let the demon out.
The silver haired man who came along with Sherlock came to the three at the end of the alley with panting. "Sherlock, I think it is better for you to go home while we clean up this mess, guess I will ask him about this tomorrow". For a moment, John thought if the other Alpha is Sherlock's partner but he just dismissed him with hand gesture.
“Listen Mycroft, listen well, collect Sherlock from the Battersea Power Station,..yes I know, listen, Battersea Power Station near at the sewage plant room, take your medical people too. Mycroft, please keep him safe this time and don’t let him out of your sight.”
Sherlock sat on the chair like the king and hoisted him up on his lap like it was his throne. The span of silk pants on his bottom sagged the tension on his knees. The skilled hands released him from the knots, massaged him slowly from the nape of his neck to the tip of his fingers. Sherlock pulled him backward so his back on detective's chest.
Lestrade placed his thumb and forefinger to the bridge of his noise, “Anderson is one of the detectives here. Sherlock and he don’t… they don’t agree on anything. Anderson is bitter because Sherlock is better at deducing than he is. It’s an endless cycle; you were Sherlock’s therapist right? Maybe you can make them work together, or at least civil? Just something to stop... this.”
After more bones, darkness, more eyes, confused loss-inducing weaving, and more foul smell, there it was. The heart of skulls. Fourteen skulls shaped in the shape of a heart, it was darker than the rest of the surroundings, from around the corner someone spoke, "You're late Doctor Watson."
John had a brief smile before turning back to his patient. He sat daintily on the end of the bed and said “whatever I can do Mr. Holmes just let me know.”
Sherlock and John were let into the, albeit arguably going downhill, dock of Mine head. A police officer who must have been near retirement age was required to follow them around the duration of their deducing in the now pitch black boat harbour. He opened the gate that clearly protected nothing, with a key to a simple padlock. The padlock was so rusty John was convinced it would not open. The elderly key holder was very small, smaller than John, making Sherlock giggle on meeting him. Not only was he small, his back was also curved, and his glasses were so thick they made his yellowing eyes look ginormous, as if an owl had been assigned to watch them the entire evening. He was quiet, John attempted at small talk but unfortunately he did not rise to any of the questions, it seemed as if he wanted to go home, a dead man on a beach was evidently a nuisance to him rather than a point of fixation that the rest of the village had been engulfed it. The effort of opening the padlock and then the creaking gate left the old officer puffing and on John asking if he was okay, the gentlemen waved him off and said with his face turned to the ground in an effort to catch his breath, "you youngens' just go and get your work done." John was rather flattered to be called a 'youngen.'
"They liked her, I think the boss may have even loved her, his pupils changed when he spoke of her, and they were comfortable enough with each other to not only play poker, but Eleanor was comfortable enough to beat him without feeling like there were consequences. He was fixated with her, all they asked me about was about her, why would they ask me that if they killed her. Easy, they didn't. They want to know who killed her just as much as us. So the smuggling gang had nothing to do with her death, so anonymous. The lover. The lover and relation, we don't know yet, but definitely lover. Unless their hand writing is exactly the same, which either means anonymous is the perfect scribe or they are the same person, the latter is more likely. Lover and Eleanor wrote letters to each other often, they didn't sign their name, meaning she just knew who it was, the lack of identity most likely means that the relationship was secret, which backs up the idea that they were related, there is shame or at least anxiety involved. We need to get in touch with Lestrade. Where's your phone? They gang most likely tapped mine, they took it off me then gave it back. Whereas yours was left behind, just in case you were going to ask why I need to use your phone. Hurry John. Please."
John walked close to Sherlock, and admired the stitching across his scalp and across the rest of his visible skin. They had done a good job, John thought. He was pleased and impressed at their work. On this assessment he sat in the chair next to Sherlock’s bed, and though he did try to fight it, he fell asleep almost immediately.
, assumes that they are partners in a romantic, sexual, starry-eyed sense. John has mostly given up on correcting people but he is damned if he’s going to help the rumors.
“It was a secret to everyone,” John whispered. “And then… and then I didn’t know how to say it. And I thought if it just remained a secret it’d be easier, and it wouldn’t matter because when it would ever… make a difference…”
Sherlock, but never from Sherlock, never a part of him. And so he would slide them under his microscope and fix in and take a look and then shrug and leave them to rot on the table, blue-purple stippling of mold under the plastic slip for John to clean up after.
The police arrived and hauled her away. She struggled. He did not care.
So Sherlock put his computer back down, and took a drink while it was still meltingly hot, and waited.
Lestrade said, “Yes, you are. At times.”
Yes. - SH
with a wave, gesturing to John and himself, to the ineffable existence of their relationship. “Yes. This Thursday, he’s going to show up on the museum roof.”
“No,” Sherlock whispers.
“Sherlock, really. I
“Yes. Yes, okay? I love you more and - and I can’t believe I’m saying this, you - I’d leave her for you. Yes. I would.” John’s throat bobbed and Sherlock knew he was pushing him far past  where John was supposed to go, but he was Sherlock, so he pushed forward. “But I can’t. I’m not going to leave my daughter.”
“Are you proposing then?” John asked quietly. “Right now?”
He tries a few dates. They go well until they’re not Sherlock, so he stops trying.
“It won’t,” Sherlock said, sounding rather smug about it. “Or Father would have told me to bring an umbrella.”
I’m coming downstairs - JW
Then Mycroft is also buying us Thai tonight - JW
“All right. Whatever you say, brother.”
“Turns out he, ah, wasn’t dead at all! Just faking it. To stop Moriarty. And now everything is fine so he could come back.” He gave her his biggest I’m-completely-sane smile. It clearly wasn’t working.
“Right,” John said, and took two steps away. Then immediately stepped back, and grabbed Sherlock’s face and kissed him - too hard, too angry, biting his lower lip, but Sherlock growled into it and then John groaned and relaxed and offered him his tongue. Sherlock pulled him closer - someone walking by jeered at them - Sherlock slid his hands under John’s jumper, his finger touching that bare skin again, after so long, tracking the spine, C3 to L2. John pulled away, gently, offering one last kiss, and a small smile. Not angry with Sherlock, then; still desirous of him. Needing to grieve and heal his self-image. Sherlock smiled too, and hailed a cab for John, closing the door behind him to show that he held no ill-will. He watched them drive off - still smiling fondly, in case John looked back - and then, as soon as he was out of sight, took out his phone.
“Why?” His eyes are darting around John’s face, seeking information, drawing potential conclusions, but John decides to answer for him.
Oh. Brahms is good - JW
He hadn’t felt vindicated.
Sherlock slaps on another patch just to irritate him.
John laid his head on the floor and groaned miserably.

They were in an alley. John....
His adoptive mother was happy to take him in. She already had a special boy but had always wanted two. “This is your new brother, Mycroft,” she'd told him, holding out the little baby. Mycroft had instantly disliked him.
This change in him, she didn’t understand. They fumbled for words together, out of step, out of tune. When Mary left to get the groceries for dinner, hefting herself up with her palms pressed against the table, John wiped the table off a third time, and took different mugs down. He had a crease between his eyes that seemed permanent. Mary had joked, gently, because it looked like he was preparing for the Queen, if they needed the china, or candles. And John had barked no, seriously, strongly, before instantly apologizing and offering to draw her a hot bath. Mary politely declined and insisted on going for their ingredients. Sorry for driving you ‘round the bend, John had said, the self-deprecating eliminating the last of his brief snap, and she’d patted his hand and smiled at him and grabbed her purse.
Anyway. It’s why John is surprised to find the phone. He’s rummaging through every drawer in the hopeless search for one more tea bag (and if you think finding a teabag in a random drawer is unlikely then you are not prepared for ears-in-the-icebox-221b) when he uncovers it under junk mail and a handful of pens. It’s obviously Irene’s phone and just as obviously is useless to keep. The data in and on it has been erased, destroyed, emptied. It’s not a relic of a case, John knows. It’s a relic of an experience.
John sighed and rubbed the bridge of his nose, which was really all the confirmation Lestrade needed, who groaned and leaned back with a “

“You don’t have to be.”
Sherlock watched carefully when Mary turned to stare at him. Her face remained a blank, neutral mask, but her lips were pressed thin and turned down. It was a look, he judged, of sad anger.
“I see. I...  didn’t. I was just wondering where you came from.”
“But clearly a wonderful child with proud parents and a beautiful future,” Sherlock said politely. He considered the evidence to comment upon directly. “And a large head.”
“What’s that?”
Obviously not the point - JW
“Of course.”
“Sufficient for now.”

John missed the first part of this investigation, doing something very silly and needless he calls “sleeping”, which is why he finds the phone that morning, when Sherlock is out. The rest of the case involves a trip to the aquarium, a trip to an exotic fish market, a knife fight, a swim in pantyhose, and quite a few antihistamines. The Episode of Buying Pantyhose is not going into the blog. The knife fight ends in no injuries (to them). In three days the dust has settled, and John has plied Sherlock into eating three bowls of sweet and sour soup and then passing out on the sofa. Which was not

“Thanks,” he says, and does not bother to answer her question. He walks back and sits in his chair to eat the noodles because the kitchen is under a constant zone of suspicion, after the last washing-up argument that may or may not have involved thrown towels, spoons, deliberate spilling of bicarb, some shouting about basic hygiene, and Mrs. Hudson asking them to keep down their domestic, she’s only just turned on the telly. He wonders what the hell Sherlock wants with a harpoon. He is relieved Sherlock did not ask him to accompany him, and a bit sad, as he always is when Sherlock vanishes without statement or doesn’t know it when it’s John that leaves, although John does so with clear notice. When John leaves for a date and comes back (unsuccessful) two hours later and Sherlock is (still?) talking to him John wonders if Sherlock really realizes he’s there, really cares.
“But you cannot touch it. It’ll stain your skin. So clasp your hands behind your back.”
“Is that before or after she sees the two of you melt all over each other?”
I could not possibly bother. - SH
This is true. Sherlock is going to point out that he’s aware, and that he already knows it’s not indicative of an allergy, when John continues.
"Yes, what?"
(It was thoughts like those that made Lestrade rather glad to have met Sherlock, because that meant there will always be someone crazier than him. Someone to point to and go ‘nope, not mad yet’.)
“I work for a secret organization above the government.”
everything when he was nine, which as it turned out, was way bigger than “I’m your biological father”.
For years, Sherlock didn’t see anybody.
For the past three years the game had real stakes. The game was no longer compelling. He saw where the puzzles and the chases went. He saw where they ended. No longer interesting, because repetitive; no longer interesting, because horrific. Sherlock had confirmed that his brain was not so special as to be immune to common psychology and that, like Skinner’s rat, if you electrocuted the ground again and again and again he would be afraid to tread.
“Whenever people asked me, ‘why?’ I said, ‘because he’s the best.’ And now I’m not so sure that’s true.”

“A good choice,” Sherlock said. He found compliments reassured John in times of stress.

“Ah hah,” she said bitterly, rolling the irony around on her tongue.
She sat back down, on the floor. “I hurt and I’m tired.”
For a week. John was checking the dead woman’s throat for vomit when Sherlock leaned in close and asked, “Did you want to meet my father before you proposed?”
“You should really quit,” John tells him.
Sherlock was not a very mature person.
“I don’t even know what to do.”
“So I don’t know what Sherlock bloody Holmes would be like as a husband and father. Does anyone? I meant, isn’t it like that for anyone in a relationship at the start? Besides, I’m not saying we’d get married, right away…”

He marched steadily away, forbidding himself to look back, while Sherlock grabbed his hand and hailed a cab with the other.

best. And you haven’t been since-”
“No. No,” he repeated firmly, “I would never allow that to happen.”
“Shut up,” Mary demanded. He decided it was strategic to obey. But she made no further comment in her request for silence, and he sought out John’s gaze, for just a moment. To confirm that this was okay – that this was the right decision, when the pain in the air was making his skin crawl – and John looked back at him, with a haunted desperation, and an understanding passed between them, quiet and light, and John took a deep breath and steadied, having drawn strength, and it was just a brief glance but Mary put her head in her hands and stared crying.
“John is still in love with you.”
He practically flew up the stairs and into their living room, wanting to surprise him, wanting to throw himself into Sherlock’s arms. “Sherlock!”
“And what if Sherlock did so?”
Still, thanks - JW
They couldn’t really help it.
Sherlock I have to - JW
“This is still yours.” He stepped closer. They were standing farther apart than friends would; Sherlock rather drastically closed that distance. John squared his shoulders and didn’t look up. “I’m still yours.”
“Your French is horrific.”
John let out a tight sigh, an unreadable expression on his face. Sherlock pressed forward. “Do you want the room? You’ve kept it up all this time. I can get a hotel.”
John’s hands clenched and he didn’t turn from the window. “I suppose that’s her name now officially. We were still considering them. I liked Rose - that’s Mary’s middle name. Madeline is from her favorite childhood book.”

“I’ll be there, Johnny,” he broke in cheerfully. “Wouldn’t miss it for all of time and space. Got to meet him before the wedding, right?”
“John,” she said sternly, “when did you
So Sherlock gazes back at him and does not move. He does not move in a stillness that is perfection. A careful not moving, a stillness that
And it would be good for him to have that break - he admitted this though he didn’t like it; he was worn down, and needed to build a new normalcy with John.
And then he didn’t have to stop it: after Sherlock’s death and resurrection, after the anger and betrayal waned away in the face of hope and joy, after Sherlock announced that he loved John, that he wanted John, the first time and the times after that, the times John kissed him or punched someone for him or the times they just had toast together. After their first time together John could not have, even if he’d wanted to, turn off the strange pheromonel magnet that pointed to Sherlock’s true north.
“And you just pine forever?”
“But you prefer it when I stay out of your mind.”
“Do you not-”
“How was your date with Lisa?”
It wasn't the first, or the fifth, or the tenth death. It was when John was slowly, carefully breaking fingers that he knew he'd crossed a line he never should have been at.
“Do you want more?”
Wait, when I’m there? Why? - JW
“Excuse me,” Mary said, “but I think I’d like to sit down and drink a cup of water.”
“Carry my water.”
“I had…” she said slowly. “No idea.” A short laugh. “I didn’t know you had even dated.”
“You do not. John. John!” Harry grabbed his arm, dragging him back into the seat. “You wanted brutal honesty, right? That’s why you called your fuck-up sister.”
“But?”
Sherlock went on.
I toasted a few and spread out some marmalade on them and he was very offended by the offer. Quite rude, after all that trouble I went to. - SH
John was clearly feeling sympathetic, and drummed his fingers on the table and said, “If we’re sharing family secrets, I have one of my own.”
John saw him often enough as a child. His dad didn’t refuse their relationship, but he didn’t encourage it either. Jack was a distant family friend until his parents passed away while John was in uni, and Jack offered any help or attention John might want. But they were both very busy people, Jack with his job, John with school and then the army. And John couldn’t bother him, when he got back from Afghanistan (couldn’t deal with Jack, and the inevitable job offer and what it meant), so they hadn’t talked in a while.
I’m sleeping!! - JW
Then they’ll go break into a military base to investigate a rabbit.
It was a blow. It was a loss. But he’d already mourned Sherlock and so it wasn’t as hard as it could have been, wasn’t impossible like he would have once considered it to be, and it was necessary. It was right.
“Do you know that for a fact?” he asked weakly.
“He doesn’t feel he needs to around you,” he answered. A pause. “Doesn’t feel that he should.”
Are you asking me out on a date? - SH
“I really want you to stop repeating information we both know,” Sherlock says, to be an ass.
Already on Order of the Phoenix I’m impressed - JW
In fact, the older he got, the less and less often they came. The less and less often his mother called him ‘my baby’ and caressed his hair.  His father didn’t change. And so Sherlock outgrew him.
and Sherlock summoned every forceful drop of energy in his body to open his eyes and take John’s hand and hold it tightly. That moment he looked into John’s eyes, that was the moment Sherlock knew he was in love.
It was really nice - JW
He started deleting everything he found unnecessary or stupid. He kept French but Latin was right out.

“I want to know how much you know.”
Or if John was just thinking of him.
“No, I forgot to put cilantro on the list.”
“My mother has been dead for some time.” Sherlock said this slowly, as if picking his words carefully. “I still see my father, but I haven’t for about a year now. He visits, I have no reliable way of getting in touch with him.”
He had the momentary enjoyment of watching Sherlock blink owlishly. Maybe this was the first time that Sherlock realized he did, in fact, have other friends. Maybe Sherlock honestly had a mental tally of ‘people who keep talking about the consulting detective and his doctor’ and it was so many it
“There would be new,” John said, “I’ll point out. The kissing bits, for example.”
There is nothing much to say after that. Sherlock starts insulting his intelligence. John tells him to go fuck himself. One day he comes home and Sherlock is packing his things. Fine, John will move out first; he has less to take with him. This time, when they both leave, Mycroft does not preserve the place. Mrs. Hudson offers it to new tenants. She has not spoken to them in a few months anyway.
Then he knew what it was. What he’d seen in Sherlock, and his mother; the same restlessness that Jack had, that same itch to escape gravity...

“You can’t pretend,” John said, with a gentle patience. “Not if this is going to work. She has to know who you are.”
Mycroft came by. - SH
When Sherlock dies John goes to the funeral. He withdraws. He moves out of 221b, and Mycroft quietly pays Mrs. Hudson to keep the flat as it was. John tells Harry and Mrs. Hudson that he has to leave London for a while. That he’s going up north. He buys tickets. He packs his things. He promises to stay in touch but he’s not going to, really.
But he was very smart. Very, unusually smart. “You have your father’s eyes,” his mother said often, as many mothers did, but she meant: he
“Are you having an affair with my husband?”
There was a soft click on the door, and they both fell silent, Sherlock removing his hands. Mary walked back in, looking pale but not ill. “Water.”
She stared at her feet as she clattered loudly downstairs, announcing her arrival.
The whole hat thing happens not long after. The hat thing is adorable. John feels no compunction about using that word:
At first they have to apply fear. Dark hunters, spraying blood. They take out the very worst first, a right-hand man, hiding in Munich. John shoots him. Easy. The group scatters, and for many that’s enough, but not all, and that makes it harder for them to track down their culprits. To turn them in properly rather than just take justice into their own hands. Each step they take is harder. Each trail is colder. They are cold, often. Too hot. Hungry. Sherlock grows gaunt. John is scarred anew.
He had already won.
He takes a train, for hours, pays for a room just one night, is picked up that night by a plain, unnoticeable car. It’s a short ride to the plane, and the plane is a short trip to Munich, but he sleeps it away, because it’s night. Mycroft is the only other passenger and he remains silent until the end, when he hands John a repacked bag and a fake passport. There are more in the bag. Cash, and the number of a Swiss bank account, for any of their needs. There’s no check-in for Mycroft’s plane, so John is driven into the city, and from there he takes several rides until he has disappeared into anonymity and he can appear at a clean, cheap hotel. When he finds the room he knocks three times, once, four.
He had the best tutors, but they were there to occupy his time until his parents could visit.

Sherlock was ready for a new challenge. He just didn’t know what the hell that would be.

“That’s something we need to figure out. I mean - we’ll both be parents. Equal parents. But not with Sherlock. Yet, anyway. I don’t…” he trailed off, taking another drink, not sure of the answers and troubled by it.
“Superb.”

Lestrade had canceled on their rugby night, claiming paperwork (which had mysteriously risen in amount, with the return of Sherlock), but near the end of the month called John and asked him to meet him for a drink after work.
“I did tell you that the garlic bread would be better.” John took a bite out of his bread and waved his hand to encourage Sherlock to eat.
Lestrade pushed a button on his phone and one of his flies wafted in and on following the order took the letter with plastic gloves even though it was now in a plastic bag. Sherlock rolled his eyes at the whole thing. Once this theatrics was done, Sherlock demanded “address?!”
Also neither of them are wearing underwear, this whole time.
Sherlock himself was caught out by the mood, the atmosphere John was creating, it was a joy Sherlock had never personally experienced himself. “I didn’t do anything John, it can’t have been anything I did!”
With that the two men turned at the same time and headed for Angelo’s in the hope that the place still remained.
It is fast approaching one in the morning and Sherlock and John still don't know where they are going to sleep tonight, in a sea side town maybe the beach is the only option. However, Sherlock has something up his sleeve, unfortunately somethings gone amiss and they find themselves greeted with just the one bed...
if they were sitting at a table this would have been the moment that John would kick him under said table to encourage him to behave. John looked at Olivia once more with an apologetic face and said without any irony, "sorry he's just a massive dick." Olivia giggled nervously. Sherlock gave them both a disapproving look before they reassigned themselves to focus in silence once more. They were more active this time however, daintily John checked if anything lay in the victims trouser pockets whilst Sherlock checked the jacket. There was no jewellery besides a single thin gold chain that hung around the neck, out of sight behind the shirt collar. Sherlock made an assessment of it on the body and before taking any further action asked "Detective Chalmers have you taken pictures of the victim?" Olivia made an audible swallow before saying a quiet "yes, at several intervals." Sherlock gave a polite, if not assailable, "good," John offered a look of praise any how. With that Sherlock removed the chain from the victims neck and looked at it closely, then spoke to himself more than John, "the chain has lasted well in the water, meaning it's real gold, the stamp you would see to confirm this has been removed, suggesting an alteration or two, most likely in length, Delaney wanted a smaller chain, however instead of going out and buying a shorter chain he had this one resized, repurposed, meaning that he liked this chain, it was most likely a gift or a hand me down from a dead relative, or maybe it was just something he bought and really liked for it symboled a time of personal prosperity, American market, bought in East America, I would say at time of purchase a chain such as this was at least eight-hundred dollars, so at the time he had cash, serious cash, enough to justify spending" Sherlock stopped looking at the chain and looked down at the body once more, eyes scanning were jewellery would be, "no other jewellery, maybe he didn't like it, chain suggests otherwise, but there also isn't a watch, either he did not like things on his hands or wrists, thought it annoying, it's been lost at sea, or maybe he lost a lot of money and had to sell it all."
On returning to their home, John had taken the wishful liberty to take his shoes and socks off and walk bare foot amongst the changing floor of the London flat. Just as he had in his office when Sherlock and he barely knew one another a while ago. It felt like a whole other lifetime and as John flicked the switch and the kettle began to chime it’s hopeful tune, whistling as if breathing amongst the other wise silent kitchen, he thought of that first meeting. In the rehabilitation center he worked in unhappily and continuously like a dull drum or a wind turbine forced to keep turning by the moving air that makes such demands of it. An atmosphere that truly crushes the soul and weighs more and more upon the heart. Sherlock had ignored the initial handshake and John didn’t really think anything of it. John had seen many in denial and angry patients before, if anything it was a courteous experience in comparison. Better to be ignored than punched in the face or cursed at by a complete stranger, actually worse a future patient. The man had seen combat for gods sake, he could handle a single addicted piece of flesh. Sherlock was definitely different. John liked him instantaneously. Just as the world was a puzzle to Sherlock, John saw a puzzle in the man and he felt the need to explore and crack it, something he hadn’t felt the urge to do in years. A doctor without a motivation is a dead thing indeed. Sherlock breathed life into John immediately. As he handed Sherlock the mug in the present time, he looked at the man he already owed too much too. Sherlock didn’t even know it. He was thinking of the case and the case alone, something he had warned John of an array of times now. So the mug lay growing increasingly cold and it’s contents left un-drunk and placid.
“Sherlock no listen to me okay, I am not sure of what I am about to hear, nor that I will necessarily like what I will hear and I know that you struggled, struggle, with how you phrase things, particularly sensitive subjects however I would appreciate it if you spoke with a, with an erm well controlled tongue and I mean I guess, what I want to say that I am glad you are here, irrevocably glad it has been a dream of mine, well I mean ever since you… ever since you.” John’s sigh reverberated around the room.
Face to Chalk
(See the end of the chapter for
As they stepped out the hotel into the blazing French sunlight Sherlock took John's hand, John flinched initially, then remembered, shit they are supposed to pretend to be married for the rest of the day. He took Sherlock's hands and it felt bizarre. For a second John thought he wouldn't be able to do this, not because he had a problem with sexuality, he felt strong in that, but just because it was Sherlock. They had just got to the point were the lines of their friendship and professional life were set, and now the rules were being bent for a case, maybe Sherlock was right, he needed to stop over thinking it. So they pair walked arm in arm to the floating pier that all the boats alighted along. The 'Cleopatra' remained where it had sat since it had been abandoned by the suspected murderers. It appeared strangely eerie in the sharp light. Like an iceberg, it both felt close and as if it were unreachable. Stood on board were two people, a man smoking a long cigarette that hung from his thinly moustached lip, and a woman, who was at least ten years older than the fellow and she wore an unimpressed face and a incredibly short skirt.
“That is why I am holding it strange.”
"Dad where are we going?" Mycroft said, they were holding hands, striding down the long airport corridor towards their gate. Grey upon grey upon grey. Both children were dressed smart. Mycroft wore a dark green suit with a maroon tie. He was in need of a haircut, his hair irritatingly brushing his ears whenever he moved his head. Sherlock, much younger, wore a minute dark blue blazer befitting his age, it was new and measured to not get in the way of his childish fists. He wore soft spongy shoes and was being carried by his mother, it was arguable that he was too old to be carried, however the Holmes family were in a rush, the doors to the plane were to be shutting imminently, and Sherlock's little legs simply could not run fast enough.
“Yes Dr. Watson I do, and I play mean. There is no benefit to letting people win.” The coy playfulness in Sherlock’s voice was unintentional, but John didn’t know that and the comment made him snicker.
Sherlock smirked before moving the bishop away from the potentially intrusive D3 to C5. The confusion on John’s face was a picture. His face was all scrunched up and he looked at Sherlock as if he was a drawing from a comic book.
Next To His Mother
“So, how do we start this Watson?”
“Thank you Marjorie” John chimed.
In that moment, in Sherlock’s words it then all became very real. John felt a wave of butterflies deep in his gut and almost shuddered in disbelief. One thing he was sure of is that he most definitely wasn’t making a mistake. They were going on an adventure.
Just as Sherlock parted his lips and was about to respond, a rather old woman came around the corner with a trolley holding two plates containing lasagna and garlic bread. She had to have been nearing retirement, she shuffled with a slight limp and she was beyond caring about her personal appearance. She pushed the trolley over to the table and squeezed the plates alongside the in play chessboard.
He stood and walked towards John, Sherlock put John’s face in between his hands and squeezed his cheeks together as if he were a little boy who had put something into his mouth that he wasn’t supposed to, like a piece of Lego or glue. “John, this is very important, these painted-white-to-be-pleasing devices are the source of my imagination for years, they are bee hives, the home of the intricate living that are bees. Their whole world exists in these boxes. Their hierarchy, matriarchy and work lay in these, and there are thousands of them in each box. These innocent in appearance containers bear something that is very dear to me, and at this point in time something that was also dear to Eleanor. If she kept bees, she was meticulous. Methodical. No victim John, but a player.”
John was so shocked by the request that he almost dropped the heavy book on his toes. “Sherlock it’s late! And it’s his daughter who had been murdered!”
It's on my tongue
get him, his ego is big enough." They shared a laugh before John hurried after his long legged friend. He could not wait for a cup of tea in his chair. It had been a long fortnight and even though the flat hadn't been his residence for long, it already felt like home.
Sherlock grabbed the now still torch and began to look around the deck and it’s contents. To John nothing seemed out of the ordinary, and if there was blood here recently it had been cleaned thoroughly, Sherlock attempted to enter the cabin but it was locked so he did the same thing as before. Using the torch he pressed his face up to the panes and shone the torch through the windows. To John’s utter surprise Sherlock exclaimed “shit!” and leaped off the boat. John followed despite his complaining knee and he proceeded to sprint after his much longer legged friend. They ran out along the swinging pier and literally leaped over the bridge, landing heavily on the concrete. John nearly slipped on that coating of algae he had seen prior, but regained his balance and together they sprinted out the useless gate and ran for about another two hundred meters up the beach before Sherlock collapsed onto the sand. John sat beside him and they both puffed in unison, attempting to catch their breath. Their bottoms touching the sand and their feet parallel John said between breaths, “what… the… fuck… was that.” Sherlock let out a small laugh and threw his head back to open his windpipe further in an attempt to get more air in. Lowering his head and looking level at John he said also between breaths, “people… in the… cabin.” John began to laugh again and then said “oh shit!” Sherlock giggled.
The men were forced to stand at the same time and then they walked. John began to struggle, the fight or flight response had kicked in, but Sherlock nudged at John who stood next to him the whole way, which made him stop. The two men walked with guns at their temples and a stranger holding their arm for what felt like an age.
Stabbed in the chest and bled dry
Fall.
“Front zip pocket.”
“John what stops the heart, just reel them off.”
John was still not looking at Sherlock and he began to shake his head, lips quivering fighting the profanity that wanted to go from John's thoughts to become sound. "You think I see you as different John, you think I will adjourn my true opinions because I owe you something because you have helped me, and you have helped me, your company means much too me, but I will hurt you whether I like it or not. This job demands that of me. This job will spit you out John and I do not want to see that happen, you need to remain exactly as you are always John. I cannot let this work morph you into anything other than you are right now." As Sherlock spoke of John he raised his hands and his fingers were splayed and his palms faced John as if he was a piece of art to be admired and applauded over.
“Well it is a theory Sherlock, but incest? I don’t know.”
“Sherlock… you do realize. Sherlock you just. Why would you…?”
John took a deep breath and repeated what he did at the front, he washed him down with alcohol, much to Sherlock's pain, stitched up what needed it and then wiped him clean, before finally drying him. He followed that up with an assessment on the spine and the head; both seemed okay and not in a crisis stage, his ribcage was another story, and John's mind turned to the concern of potential internal bleeding. Sherlock was now fairly clean, and from just looking at him, if fully clothed you probably wouldn’t be able to tell he had just endured torture if he didn't want to give it away.
Sherlock began to pace, from Molly who stood maybe five feet away, back to Eleanor. Back and forth like a tiger in a zoo.
John breathed deep, the air smelt new, different, then he realised, he was in fucking Paris, he sat up quickly. For a moment, he was youthful and prepared for anything, then the twang of his head thwacked against his skull. It had been a heavy night, he knew it was a success though, he felt no anxiety, which was nice considering a hangover usually always twinned with regret. He rubbed his temple with his fingers as he threw off the covers. Almost immediately his phone buzzed, loud and inconsiderate, the screen read 'Sherlock' in big black letters. He was ringing which was unusual, he always preferred to text, John answered, "Sherlock I..." before John could say one more word he heard a voice that was definitely not Sherlock's, "we have your friend, we know you two are snooping, you've been following us, we have your friend, and we will give him back if you agree to stop following us, otherwise we will have to kill you." John was shunned into momentary silence, "where can we meet?" There was a pleased sigh at the other end, "meet at the catacombs in one hour, he will be by the heart made from skulls, don't be an idiot." The phone cut out and John was already down the stairs when it did. He ran out the hotel front doors and was in a Parisian taxi in seconds.
Sherlock stood tall, eyes tight shut, hands in the air at ear level, mind clearly whirring for if this was a cartoon his head would be literally spinning. Then within a minute his eyes burst open and he said, “yes! Brilliant yes! Of course!” John and Lestrade could have punched him, they really could, “what Sherlock?!” was all John could muster. Without looking at either of them Sherlock let himself back into the interview room and this time both Lestrade and John followed him in. Henry and Lestrade had already met so it was minor recognition of one another before they all sat down. John now sat next to Henry with Sherlock directly opposite; Lestrade sat opposite Henry with Sherlock by his side. The four of them all sat leaning in, close to one another, as if at a secret meeting no one must know of outside of that room. Sherlock spoke soft, “Henry, how did your wife and your sister get on?” John gave Sherlock a questioning look, once more he was confused, his eyes said ‘you think it’s the wife?’ Sherlock replied with a tiny tilt of the head understanding John’s mental question just by reading his face. Henry stuttered, “well I mean, they got on I suppose, she always thought Eleanor was great with the kids.” Sherlock was not satisfied, “did she know about you and Eleanor’s affair. Henry swallowed hard, the thought alone made his heart sink, “I don’t think so.” Whilst they had been talking, Sherlock had reached his hand down and removed his phone from his trouser pocket, without looking he typed a message out and on Henry’s answer, Lestrades’ phone buzzed. He knew it was Sherlock, he too grabbed his phone from his own inner coat pocket, he read the message in his lap. With that he nodded at Watson and Holmes and left the room. John knew Sherlock had just given an instruction and he wanted to know. It was an itch that needed scratched. He felt his heart quicken and he could hear his own heart beat racing in his head. Lestrade was off to get the murderer, and John knew it. He sat there thinking as to how it could have been the wife? Why would the wife have done it? She died of shock, your sister-in-law, now that would be shocking. If she knew about the incest and the cheating that does give a motive, jealousy? Rage? The desire for it to end. All of them.
By this stage Sherlock had finished his drink and he took a piece of ice into his mouth on the last gulp and chewed on it loudly. John gave a surprised disapproving look, Sherlock pulled his head back, almost near enough to head butt the window behind him, "what?! The cold and the hardness of it helps me think." John giggled, "I have never met anyone who has eaten ice like that before."
It was only in this moment that Sherlock noticed that John was bare foot.
They were wrapped up in cotton wool like a babe, and now they were in the real world, the cold harsh world with an immediate murder to investigate and the reality of who Sherlock Holmes really is. John thought that he didn’t like Sherlock like this, and that scared him, because this is who Sherlock was, he appeared inconsiderate to get the work done, or maybe he genuinely didn’t care. John for a second thought he didn’t want to find out.
(See the end of the chapter for
Sherlock asked “what about Michael?”
*manic voice* what does it mean WhAt DoEs It MeAn
John took a moment and too sat back. Both appeared deep in thought.
On hearing his name Sherlock looked into John’s tearing eyes. “I’m okay John, they just want to frighten us is all.”
“Okay, okay, erm, gosh that is tricky. I would kill, erm, wow this is hard, I guess I would let it continue its course.”
---------------------------------------------
Still unmoving Sherlock spoke, “John you said ‘just be.’ How can one ‘just be?’ That is a concept I will never be able to grasp. It’s like everyone can float without any trouble but I will always drown. How can I ‘just be?’” Sherlock getting visibly irritated now shifted his gaze and body simultaneously, to finally accept the eye contact John had been waiting for, “John you said ‘people in rehab,’ I am not and never will be people. I have never been easily categorized. Everyone ticks themselves in little boxes as easy as filling out a form, but I have never fitted into any of them. ANY of them. The fact that I noticed or bothered to say that you have no fucking socks on demonstrates all on its own that I am not ‘people.’”
John wanted to jump over the counter and do it all himself. “Is it just carry on luggage you have with you today?” John replied with a fervent nod. She typed for another ninety seconds before declaring, “the next flight leaves in an hour, you’ll have to hurry, but we have two seats available, direct, the seats are not together, but they are only several rows apart, I see one of you is, erm potentially needing some form of erm, assistance, so it is necessity you sit with one another? If yes then we'll need to find another flight.” John could have jumped in the air, a fucking flight, a way out, but he kept it together and replied as calm as you like, “I am this mans friend and doctor and I can inform you that he is fit to travel without me being right by his side.” John let out a nervous laugh and Sherlock faked a smile and the woman nodded. It seemed they’d convinced her. “Passports please gentlemen.”
“It’s of £100’000, for around a month ago." Sherlock stopped pacing. “That’ll be just before the letters in Mandarin arrived here. That’s the big pay out. She wanted more than that. Is that the last pay out?”
Sherlock just nodded. It seems he wasn’t used to people caring about him.
John once again looked bemused for what could have been the fiftieth time today and Anderson just rolled his eyes whilst unlocking the door.
Sherlock pulled his eyebrows into close collision with one another and pulled his head back like a confused dog, John explained himself immediately, "I'm sorry but for such a clever man you are thick." Sherlock pulled his head back even further now, completely unprepared for insult, "Theory four, you are not a sociopath." John said, imitating Sherlock as he did so, "that's not even remotely like me" Sherlock huffed. "That's not even remotely like me" John repeated in a very flourished fashion, making Sherlock go for a soft punch to Johns arm whilst telling him to "fuck off." John snickered, as he finished the second whisky, he felt the alcohol beginning to get to him. His fingertips seemed to hum under their nails and he felt the disconnection heading his way, "another two whiskies please" he half shouted. Again they were on the table in what felt like no effort at all. As John sniffed his fourth beverage of the night, Sherlock picked up his own whilst he watched his companion, "how could I not be a sociopath?"
“That wasn’t so difficult was it?”
Sherlock on the other hand, was a completely different story. As he entered his hotel room he did not even give himself time to close the door. He dropped his bag and was out again. He rubbed his eyes in the lift and shook his head in an attempt to wake himself up. He was in a case, of course sleep was not his priority. He waded out of the hotel he'd spent approximately six minutes in and ignored everyone around him. The marina was open to anyone to wander around and he took out his phone that held images of the missing Cleopatra he had been aptly given. He flicked through them and looked at the boats illuminated only by the infrequent lights along the floating dock. It was difficult to see every detail due to the lack of light, but sure enough there she was. A ketch sailboat, approximately forty-five feet long. Her sails were down, clearly not going anywhere any time soon. Much to the happiness of Sherlock, the glorious word 'Cleopatra' in its green and white glory remained along the impressive boats flank. He brushed his hand smoothly along the entire word, making it more real that he'd actually found the boat. Immediately he added to his image of the murderers, they had either been too lazy or cocky or stupid to remove the word, could have been all three. Or potentially they were short of time. The last idea gave Sherlock hope that this case may be closed soon. Hot on their heels, feeling the pressure, on the run from whatever storm they knew was headed their way. 'The east wind is coming.'  Sherlock smiled as the sentence breathed through his mind. John and Sherlock were that storm. And he was determined to make the run aways feel its chill. He snapped several photographs of the boat and sent the best image to John; 'Like to a vagabond flag upon the stream, Goes to, and back, lackeying the varying tide, To rot itself with motion. -SH'
"Okay okay Greg, I will go home and take John to his home. Tomorrow I will accompany him to your office". If this Greg was surprised by that fast association between Sherlock and John, he didn't voice it out but with a raised eyebrow. He turned to his team when Sherlock started to take the shock blanket from Timothee's death grip and covered John's body with that gently.
In the numbness of the following cities to take down, and
He gasped in his stroll on the pavement as the emotion overwhelmed his entire being. The harsh exhale came out from his mouth in the cold windy air like the ghost appeared from the past in his sight. He clutched his star-shaped chest wound with his free hand that wasn't holding the cane. It ached and his limping leg was heavier than his morning cramps. For a while, he stood with his body a little bit crooked to hold the pain.
I can't help to always infuse dark jokes here. Sequel might comes might not. However, enjoy your days my dear friends >3<
John walks and juts his chin to Greg, “We don’t have this conversation and we don’t even meet, Greg, you lost this files, you have no idea where it goes. Are we clear?”.
As John turns his body to find the entity that disturbs his summoning ritual, all the candles are blown and the room is drowning in darkness. “Hello, is anyone here?” John calls out into the room with his voice croaks at the end. He does not afraid of the dark but he can swear that there is something,
"Ahem..Do you think so?" he asked nonchalantly.
Funny how is the portal of underworld recedes in the Battersea Power Station, place where Irene Adler showed up and announced herself
“So much for dealing with a demon” he sighs and lets go of this eye issue for a while. He sobers himself fast by remembering the souls he needs to collect and Sherlock’s revival yet he cannot shake himself from the upcoming dread he feels.
"I know you’re an Army doctor. Your haircut, the way you hold yourself, says military. The clinic smell that still clings on your jacket and the way you treated Tim when I sighted you two, says doctor. So Army doctor – obvious. Under this lamp post light your face looks tanned but no tan above the wrists. You’ve been abroad, but not sunbathing. You have limps considering the aluminium cane threw at the entrance, it's still has your smell by the way, but your legs don't waver here standing with me and Tim, like you’ve forgotten about it, so it’s at least partly psychosomatic. That says the original circumstances of the injury were traumatic. Wounded in action, then. Wounded in action, suntan – Afghanistan or Iraq. Shot in the dark I say you’ve been invalided home from Afghanistan."
The embrace tightened and Sherlock nuzzled his neck.
and he can agree with Mycroft now. “Can you..Lord?” he asks with his signature stiff upper lip and determination written all over his face. “You seek me and you shall receive, soldier” the shadow answers like purring on his ear. By this point, the shadow merges into broken flesh and head of a bird that makes John gasps in the hard breath of panic.
The dark faded into the sepia gradient of desk lamp on red wallpaper. The king size of bed with dramatic canopy, the Egyptian cotton silk bedsheet and soft quilt, the red oakwood drawer near the window, the plushie maroon cushion under his knees.
He is realized that this negotiation will end up with him offering his own life as an exchange. But then the demon touches the blade that is ignored on the floor and chants a language John does not know on it. “By the exchange of 300 souls, hereby I resuscitate the soul and flesh of Sherlock Holmes in the deal under the name of John Hamish Watson”. Before John can counter the demon’s errand, the blade is pointed into the star-shaped scar he got in Afghanistan and prick it hard to his wound that draws cry from John’s mouth.
“I am sorry, John”
the bird on his brain tells him with its so sweet as syrup voice yet it does not stop the cringe and the fear that keep bolting into his body every time he hears demon’s voice in his head.
. He wants Sherlock back and nothing,
It’s more than a dozen, one stab and it reached 300. His blade is pulsating with a yellow glow, dark miasma dances around it and falcon brain explode into the white noise that defeating him for a moment. The star-shaped scar that ever been touched by the prick of the blade is jolting with pain leaving John breathless. He limps outside the warehouse while holding his chest tight. He thinks he heard shouting and footsteps from the inside, yet he can’t bother with that for he dialing Mycroft in shaking hand.
“John..”
"Very well then, this way John".
He thought about it for a moment. His skin tinged with hypersensitivity and coldness started to slip to his legs.
“I need a file of Moriarty’s web, the one you collected for Sherlock in his trial, I know you still have it, so for the love of God, Greg, let me have it”. And there goes cat out of the bag. Greg’s face is contorted with so many emotions, his confusion weakens John’s resolution.
"I am here, little boy". John rubbed the child's back slowly and calmed himself down in return.
However, John knows if he does that for real, with the growing warmer and warmer blade, he will end up in prison before he even has a chance to really fulfill the demand for Sherlock’s resurrection. Besides, if Sherlock will be alive again,
“Listen, Greg, you can keep thinking that snake doesn’t exist, it’s fuckery, but hell the syndicates, the drug cartel, and so on and so on are real. Come on Greg, you know!”
'You are going to go deeper to space if we proceed more, my boy, so for now we put this lotion on your reddish mark of skin and we will retire to bed early. What do you think?'
It is the pain that pulsating from his chest to all over his body, hotter than anything John ever felt as if his skin touches hot pan but it does not dissipate because it is inside his body, not the outside.
'My dear boy, My John'
"Timothee.."
“Oh, soldier, you summoned me minutes ago and you forget now?” This time the shadow’s voice seems to fix into deep baritone that throws millennia of power.
Losing was not something foreign to John Watson. He lost his father due to cancer when he was 10 years old, leaving Harry as the head of household, an alpha to be in charge of Watson's family. He lost his chance to get the privilege of studying medicine in college free without the needs to work two or three jobs at the same time. He lost Harry to alcoholism as the same time when their mother passed away, enveloping by the ground next to his father's grave. He learned to live with it, but nothing prepared him to the most fresh lost he encountered. The lose of his army life alongside the fertility robbed by the bullet which were stricken to his left shoulder that left his body's immunity running amok and ruining his reproduction system. An Omega without the ability to procreate, to conceive, to have offspring.
"I said let him go!" John growled and rushed to the Alpha at the end of alley. The man threw the little boy like ragdoll while anticipating John's wrath. The red in his eye injected more power when he threw the punch to Alpha's throat. The man recoiled a moment with gurgle before he aimed John's neck.
?”  The demon spats the word ‘lover’ as if its a holy water burns on his tongue. If John is not in fear he might laugh for the familiarity of a disgust over the sentiment.
. John trashes himself far from the demon but it feels like the blade has a vice grip into it that John can’t help but dig into his agony in the place.
John will survive for Sherlock, to say things he always meant to say but never say it when the consulting detective was alive.
that’s what the demon said, yet it was not the pity he felt, it was sadness for he was once a man of battalion too and he understood the ambition yet there is always a great motive behind something as great as rebellion against the head of nation that he guessed the falcon brain doesn’t want to share that vision with him.
“Who are you?” John whispers and grits his teeth when the shadow laughs in evil.
Before John registering the shout which cracked the tension raising at the corner of alley as his, the three men turned on him and by this stance John was able to see the little boy that backed on the far fence. The boy's face was so pale laced thickly with agitation. He has a ruffled dark hair, clothed by navy knee-length coat, socks and shoes that looked like coming out as school uniform.
"Father, you are showing off."
He might lose himself in fear if it is not for Sherlock’s name on his tongue.
But then, Greg would not be a detective like he is now if he is not determined and knows when to stop and to pursue – Greg is always the one who message him even when he knows John will not reply.
the blow comes hard to his head and ends his consciousness in black.
“John, why? I think we established that Moriarty doesn’t exist, it is Richard Brooks”.
Three rings and Mycroft answers him with a raspy voice, John guesses even the head of British government needs sleep too. He gulps big air to prepare him to say the words that he’s been rehearsing so many times while holding the hurt that feels like a punch to his solar plexus.
The first man barreled into him was the left one. It would be as cliche as movie with the alpha screamed for blood while his fist aimed for John's jugular. In seconds, John's shoulder shrugged from the path, and twisted the Alpha's right wrist while elbowing the gut behind him. With groan, John flicked Alpha's body behind him and snapped his neck on the floor.
In the day of 100 after Sherlock’s fall, the requirements from people who did errand from John are collected, John tries to tell Harry why he needs to go away for a moment. The duffel bag that seen better days in Afghanistan is stuffed full with everything he needs including Sherlock’s Belstaff swishy coat and an empty jar for the grave soil, of course, Sherlock’s grave in Essex. Harry waits for him in the living room and when their eyes meet, John reaches Harry and hugs her tight. They have never been tactile siblings who like to show affection through touch, more often they like shouting to each other with words that hurt more than swords. ‘This might be the last time I see her’ John thinks. Harry with her shoulder length blonde hair, corn blue eyes and paler skin than him is recovering from alcohol addiction that makes John aches in leaving her alone. “I told Mycroft to find a convenient AA therapy and rehab house, a better one, I trust you but I do not trust myself leaving you alone in suburban’s flat like this Harry,” he tells her while wiping Harry’s tears. “What are you doing, Johnny?” Harry holds his left wrist tight with her eyes searching his face. “I need to, I need to find a way, a peace for myself in this, Harry, he is important for me” he knows that he lies to Harry, but at least it is not a full lie. “You love him, don’t you John?” Harry asks with her breaking voice and hugs him tight. It is not a question that John likes to dwell by himself, he is sure by himself that he is straight, but a straight person might not do what John going to do in few days so he just hugs Harry back tighter and promises to himself that he will come back with Sherlock.
'Yes, dear John.'
"No. I like it, Sherlock, besides I still want to check Timothee up to settle my nerves. Of course, if you don't mind".
The person loomed by three men muffled something that John couldn't hear the exact words but it was undoubtedly a boy in fear. A little offspring.
Not only once he thought that it would only be John who’d be lost if Sherlock is kicked out from the equation of John’s life – although the present will support the argument, yet when Greg or basically the entire team of Scotland Yard breathed in relief when he came back in investigating from his practice that finally someone will put a leash on Sherlock, brandished or stamped “Only John”. It made him happy and treasured, although in strange fascination because of course, this is Sherlock what he talked about, the mess as storm the demanding as lord of war, but then when John was put next to Sherlock, he was able to smooth the raw and sharp edges of the detective. And he wants to cry so bad in train ride like a weak female character in the cheap novel when he thinks of everytime people assumed they were a couple with John’s firm denial yet Sherlock always ignored it like a silence of affirmation that
"Thank you John for saving my child. Although it was the fault of my son to run away from flat while the thugs involved in the murder i investigated were out at the street". The man stated gracefully with his chin jutted to the little boy who shuffled from one foot to other.
These words did the opposite of calm. John was furious and all of a sudden he felt like he couldn’t breathe. He was suffocating and there was nothing he could do about anything. He started to wriggle; he needed to do something, anything to be able to breathe. “John, please, I promise it will be fine.” John wanted to scream at him. “How can this be fine?! How can anything possibly like this be fine?!!! What the fuck have we got ourselves into?! God I am such an idiot!!!” Alas he could do nothing but squirm.
Lestrade held onto the letter between one pair of fingers, and used his now free hand to smooth his brow. “Sherlock you have known me for over a decade and you didn’t know my first name?”
The three men saw Henry and Mark sitting in the cheap chairs beyond the glass. Not speaking to one another, and doing all that they could to not look at the mirror-window that lay directly in front of them. They both knew exactly how this worked. Being lawyers is a definite advantage when being questioned in the name of the law. Lestrade, Holmes and Watson all stared at the hours that lay ahead of them in the faces of the two men in which only one side could see the other. John had been carrying a rucksack since leaving 221b. It was something Lestrade had failed to notice until John began to slide it awkwardly from his back. “What’s in there?” Lestrade asked whilst pointing at the black bag, Sherlock answered for them both, “evidence.” Lestrade followed up by asking, “anything I don’t know about?” Sherlock nodded once, still looking at the glass and not the men that surrounded him. Lestrade really did not like being out of the know, his job after all was to be in the know, and if the past decade of working with the worlds only consulting detective hadn’t taught him that Sherlock was one to actively keep him out of the know, then he truly was an idiot. He still couldn’t help himself but ask, “are you going to tell me or…” Sherlock folded his arms and rolled his eyes, he said one word and one word alone, “John.”
There was a brief pause and Sherlock lowered his hands to once more come into contact with his weak body that lay beneath the cheap sanitised blanket. John pushed his lips out and took an audible sigh, as his chest expanded in the next breath a single tear rolled down his cheek and Sherlock looked down at his own stomach as if the tear was not to be witnessed in fear of un-dignifying John some how. John wiped the tear from its tracks with his thumb. He cleared his throat and repositioned himself, palms now touching his thighs, he sat up straight, battle stations, then took several more breaths and looked back in Sherlock's direction to face whatever was coming. "So what you are saying Sherlock, is that, you don't think it is wise for us to work together anymore?"
“Sherlock,” John ventured, “How are you feeling?”
That explanation was defeated by Sherlock’s calmly stated response, “You either need to do that again, or leave now and forget what you saw.” John’s thought process shot apart in a million different directions. He began to panic almost immediately, his mind flailing for the right response, when a fear of losing Sherlock forever lose to the surface. That clinched it and before John knew what he had decided, he had struck Sherlock across the other cheek.
He was rewarded with a gentle hum that denoted John thinking. Eventually John responded by ordering, “Be sure not to make a mess.” And then almost too quiet for Sherlock to hear, “At least then you’ll have less endorphins to hide behind.”
Beyond embarrassment or the feeling of failure, Sherlock realized that he now in this moment felt understood. He felt seen and accepted by John, he felt safe and taken care of. Usually there would have been a sense of deep shame, of burdening John with this so soon after the last event, but there were facts to examine. The facts told Sherlock that this had been what he failed to do yesterday. Because of his failure to follow protocol put in place for his own safety, John had punished Sherlock. John’s actions told Sherlock, much as he was hesitant to believe, that this is what John wanted Sherlock to do. He wanted Sherlock to turn to him in times of need. This was deeply uncomfortable to Sherlock, as he had prided himself on being more or less independent since childhood and he was startled to find himself relying on anyone. He felt uncertain, to be sure, but was surprised and relieved to find that he did not feel guilty by turning to John.
"Thank you, John."
”You’re my boyfriend?”
John broke the silence. “You can forget about that, Sherlock, I can tell you that right now.” Sherlock felt nothing but anxious confusion until he realized that John was indicating his penis, at which point a contradictory rush of shame and defensiveness erupted. He hadn’t noticed that he was fully erect. A glance darted up into John’s face confirmed the disapproval in his voice.
Sherlock lowered himself to sit on the tile floor, bringing his knees up to his chest, feeling his pants sink even lower toward the ground. Hiding his face behind one hand did nothing to hide the blush that rushed to the surface. Once more, he was exposed. Could he keep nothing from John tonight? What more could John possibly learn in this one short span of time?? When he answered John, his voice was tight as he explained, “It…it doesn’t have to be. It isn’t always. The word for it is masochist.” His next words were spoken faster, sounding more defensive. “I don’t do this for the arousal. I don’t want you to think… Such a meaningless thing is not compelling enough on its own.”
Floating freely now, Sherlock’s attention finally acknowledged how his arousal had progressed. His cock was throbbing almost painfully, and his hand twitched in instinct to wrap it around himself. Of course that was not an option. It remained clawed against the armrest. He could behave. Actually, Sherlock felt like he was inching toward climax anyway, each wave of fresh pain adding to the familiar sense of warm electricity in his groin.
He continued to speak with his eyes remaining shut, but Sherlock didn’t hear any of the words. He was focusing on keeping his shit together, at least on the outside. His breathing was too fast, too shallow, and Sherlock tried desperately to slow it. There was a misty feeling in his chest, not just from the shower. His belly was clenched, every muscle in his body was tense. His eyes were unfocused again, and the images he vaguely saw began to wobble. Disgust at himself flared up. Tears, from Sherlock Holmes? He managed to focus on that distain, squeezing his eyes shut for a long moment to clear them. Two tears fell, coursing down his high cheekbones, leaving incriminating trails behind them. Of course, that’s when John opened his eyes and finally looked at Sherlock.
