Castiel gasped when hot cum sprayed up his back.  Castiel rolled quickly, stroking the last bit of orgasm from Dean, kissing his soft moans into silence.
Gabe’s phone began playing ‘Bitch’ by Meredith Brooks (a total 90’s flashback).  ‘I’m a bitch, I’m a lover, I’m a child, I’m a mother.  I’m a sinner, I’m a saint.  I do not feel ashamed -’
Castiel looked back at Sam’s room, but knew he was being ridiculous.  He had been in Dean’s room before.  Not for long.  And never without Sam right next to him.  He knocked lightly, not sure what else to do.
Castiel was feeling closer and closer to hyperventilating.  Why had this subject even come up?  Damnit, Gabriel!  But still, he had to hear every word and see every reaction in the room.
Dean came back to his mouth quickly, sealing it closed with his own.  He pulled back, grinning, eyes sparkling in the moonlight.  “Shhh.”
They loaded into Bobby’s car, speeding toward the police station.  Before they could get off Singer Lane, a police car pulled across the entrance, blocking their way.
He was met with a tight, pressed mouth and an intense gaze from Cas.  Garth was standing there with a stern look, arms crossed over his chest.  Lee had a shotgun.  Gabe was glowering hard enough to smite someone.  And Sam looked like he didn’t know who to restrain, him or Gabe.
Dean’s arms were crossed tight over his chest.  He was trying his damnedest to be reasonable.  “Did you forget that he and Cas grew up under constant scrutiny and were forced into careers they didn’t want?  That not only was he a lawyer, he was a damn good one.  He lived with constant put-downs and always told how worthless he was.  His childhood was just as fucked as ours.  He runs an estate and a business.  He works six days a week like the rest of us.  How exactly is that irresponsible?”
“So...” Sam swallowed the bile in his throat, having no idea how to deal with a room full of psychopaths, but wanting the awaiting SWAT team to hear ALL they needed to hear to close this case immediately.  “So, you and Dr. Mahoney checked these four out and moved them here?”
“Son of a bitch,” Castiel swore, throwing the car door open, slamming it shut and crossing the street with one thing and one thing only on his mind.  He was going to punch Dean in the face.
All the way home, he could feel the warm patch of skin where Dean had grabbed his inner thigh.  He relished in the memory of all the touches he had gotten today.  If he were keeping a tally, this would be a stellar day.
He tossed the bottle onto his towel and ran for the water, hoping the cold waves would settle his little problem.
“Maybe Gary was sleeping with Maggie too?” Sam offered.  “These neighbors do an awful lot of...swinging.  Or sleeping around.”
A smile slid onto his mouth and he reached for his own piece of pizza.  The world had not ended.  Time had moved right along like the unthinkable hadn’t just happened.  And no one knew.
“What, so you can call the police?” Ed grinned, his eyes looking deadly serious.  “I don’t think so.”
“But they bought two tickets to Crazytown?” Dean added.  “Yeah, I’ve been thinkin’ the same thing since I drove into town.  And Sam is so damn proud of owning a home.  It’s something we never really had.  Stability.”  Dean shook his head with disappointment.  “I’m not tryin’ ta be a jerk here, but...something’s rotten in the state of Denmark, ya know?”
Bobby looked scared for the first time as his eyes went wide.  “You mean you were a doc at an insane asylum and checked those two out?”
The man shook his head no, looking worried.  “She gets confused sometimes.  The past two weeks, anyway.”
Dean smirked down at him.  “Buddy is shedding like a maniac all over my baby.  And I’m here to bounce you out.”
He grimaced as Jo killed him only ten minutes into playing.  She laughed, sticking her tongue out at him.  He handed the controller back to Gabe.  His mind just wasn’t in it.
The front door opened and thudded closed.  He looked up to see Sam rushing in, arms full of bags.  “I woulda been here ten minutes ago but I ran into a Mark somebody who heard from Justin we were new in town and...I kinda lost track of how exactly they knew about me already.  Cas!  You’re here!”  Sam hugged Cas as the pair fell into easy conversation.
Luc chuckled, his eyes moving to Dean, then back to him.  “I gotta go pick up diapers and head home.  You okay riding back with Dean?”
Gary didn’t look quite as convinced but didn’t argue.  Sam could see Ed and Marge heading their way with the other couple that lived next to them.  Naoki and Olivia waved, heading over to a large table full of food that Dean was already picking at.
Cas squeezed his ass before pushing himself away from him with the most eager look he had ever seen on the stoic man.
“I should go.  See ya tonight!” Castiel grabbed his backpack and headed for home.  He needed to breathe for starters.  That had been a lot to process.
Castiel’s chest heaved, his eyes wide.  What the hell was that?  Dean had lost his mind!  He sat up slowly, looking at his lap in wonder.  He was hard as a rock.  Again.
Dean rubbed at his forehead.  “So, Mahoney and Whittaker bring their gang of Stepford citizens to town, you make a plan for the strip mall, you start killing people for money, you get desperate for the land Bobby won’t sell ya, you poison people, you kill more people, and...now what?”
Castiel narrowed his eyes.  Luc was a year older than him, but had flunked into his grade.  There had been a time or two when he thought Luc was pretty hot.  But his asinine behavior always turned him off.
His eyes had a far away look as he went on.  “Charming Acres was a pretty standard town in the fifties and sixties.  Most folks worked at the mill.  Our neighbor, Fred Jones, worked at the mill with my dad.  Fred lived where Rufus does now.  I suppose he saw a time or two when my dad got rough with me.  Fred always was good to me.  Gave me extra money for delivering his paper and such.  Guess that’s why he was the one I ran to when things went bad.”
Dean laughed as Sam held his hands up.  “What?  Seriously, where was Donna?  I thought she’d...I don’t know, rescue me!”
“Yeah.  I might turn into a pumpkin and you’d have to carry me home,” Gabe yawned.  “See ya tomorrow, guys!”
They stepped into a room that was separated by two half-walls which were topped with spindles that went to the ceiling.  Each spindle was adorned with silver half-moons and stars.  Navy blue carpet with specks of silver and black reached wall to wall.  In the first half of the room, a kitchenette area had a small fridge, a short white counter and several black cabinets beneath it, each cabinet door bearing a moon and star.  A small white table had two black vinyl chairs that matched a loveseat across from it.
Gabe and Sam both chuckled at that.  “Yeah, they’re dating,” Sam confirmed.  “And he’s been ignoring me today too, Melanie, so...you can try again later, I guess.”
Luc shrugged with that tilted smile he so often wore.  “Short temper.  I tend to get a liiiiittle mouthy.”
“Alright,” Bobby said, not really seeming alright.  His eyes traveled over the front of Sam’s house before he schooled his face into something more neutral.
“What happened?” Dean asked softly, so drawn in already that he felt a growing hatred for Bobby’s father, images of his own supplying the void of a face in the tale.
The sound must have shocked Dean just as much.  His mouth paused, his whole body going still. Dean’s eyes opened, going wide.
Castiel swept a thumb over Dean’s nipple, watching his breath catch.  He did that.  He could make Dean respond to his touch.
He gave the now-closed bathroom door a wistful look and headed out of the room and toward the stairs.  He made his way quickly through the house, Buddy at his side, down to the ground floor and to the back door.  He opened the door to a worried looking Brandy.
Dean, looking as relieved as he was to be away from their host, nodded and followed him up the stairs eagerly.
He sat back into the space of his own chair, focused back on his meal.  He caught a wizzing biscuit Gabe tossed at him, catching it in front of a startled, then glaring Cas.
“Damn.  Feels good to have family around.”  Gabe didn’t usually say such mushy things out loud...but it did feel good.
Sam shrugged.  “I don’t know.  He’s never gotten that serious about anyone.  I thought he and Aaron were fairly serious, but apparently not.”
Sam shook both their hands.  “Sam Winchester.  My husband, Gabe, and I just moved in two houses down.”
They left the Stark home, Sam pointing out more dead plants on the porch.  Only when they were back on Sam’s front porch did they discuss what had just happened.
“No one is shadier than him,” Sonny said in a whisper so light that Sam found himself stretching up toward her to be sure he heard her right.
Castiel drug a deep breath in and closed his eyes, breathing out.  The heat from Dean’s skin under the too-warm blanket was making him sweat.  His hand resting on Dean’s thigh closed in a fist.  He slid the back of his hand lower toward Dean’s knee, then back to where it had been.
Sighing, they both sat on the sofa.  Their odds could be better.  Two with no gun to three fruitcakes and one gun.  Still, they might be alright.
Gabe turned her back toward her room, watching as more police came out of the office, Wayne and Doc Mahoney looking angry.
Dean nodded.  “You should.”  His hand stayed, hot and strong on top of his knee, squeezing slightly.
They sat quietly for some time.  Eventually, Gabe had him relaxed.  “I was just reading about Mayor Chip in the paper.  Apparently, this town is on the brink of winning the ‘US safest and friendliest city’ award for the sixteenth year in a row.”
“It’s not all about touch,” Dean whispered in his ear.  “Sometimes it’s what you say.”  He leaned up a notch, his eyes dropping from Castiel’s eyes to his mouth.
Castiel stared at the sweet face with a tiny fist curled up to his mouth.  His little legs were bent up, making his tiny, diapered butt stick up.  He was wearing a one piece outfit and Castiel grinned at the random thought that he wished he could see his little bare feet again.
This was news to Castiel.  Of course, he had been so self-absorbed lately that it was no wonder he was missing things.  “What scholarship?” He asked.
Just as he was about to ask more about the alien ruse, everyone turned to see Dean walk into the living room with his hands held up as Dr. Mahoney came into view, following Dean with a gun to his back.
“Just work on loosening up, Cas.  It’ll all be a lot more fun if you can, ya know, breathe and enjoy it.”
Cindy blushed, her perfectly lip-sticked mouth showing perfect white teeth as it dropped for a second and she elbowed Justin with a wink.  “Oh you!  I’m Cindy!”
“I’d believe that if ya know, you weren’t so you and Dean was even a hint bi.”  Gabe narrowed his eyes even further, but Castiel simply stared back at him.  “Fine.  Don’t tell me.  But I’m gonna figure it out.”
Cas waved Jo over to the table to get Crowley a drink.  She waved and came back with two beers, pulled a chair up, taking a much needed break.  “You guys seem to be having fun tonight!”
“Alright,” Dean interjected, giving Melanie a ‘calm down’ look, then eyeing Sam with a chill-the-fuck-out glare.
Chuck and Gabe were listening to a band play.  Both of them played guitar pretty well.  Castiel often told them they should start a band.
“Guys!” Dean said, staring at a white, wood door next to the refrigerator.  Sam and Cas crowded behind him.
Castiel could not imagine dealing with such issues.  He also could not imagine having a child and not being in control of whether he could have it or not.  “Is there anything you can do to keep him?” Castiel asked.
“She did!” Marion said with concern.  “We are all being robbed!  It’s that leprechaun!  They aren’t all bad, but that Whittaker is the worst I’ve ever seen!”
“Okie dokie!” Donna clapped, diffusing the tension.  “These two are just mad about the thing last week.” She waved a hand as if whatever happened last week was old news, and Bobby and Jody both relaxed a bit.
Castiel didn’t really want to go home.  The Sub was a sandwich and pizza shop downtown that most kids from their school went to.  The thought of being alone at Luc’s house honestly made him a little nervous.  “The Sub is good.”
They ate their fries and sipped sodas, talking about school, people they knew, and where they worked.  It seemed comfortable enough.
Cas sat up, taking his own shirt off.  The soft candlelight gave Dean’s skin a warm glow.  He got to his feet, Dean sitting to watch.  He opened his belt, button, and fly with the same measure.  Stripped to nothing, he came into Dean’s open hands easily.  His head dropped back as Dean ran his hands over his body slowly, kissing along his abdomen.  He hissed when Dean’s stubbled chin brushed his cock, making him shiver.  He looked down as Dean took him deep in his mouth, surrounding his length with wet heat.  His mouth dropped open as he rocked into him deeper.
“Yeah.  Mean fucker.  Swear that bastard tried to kill me and Sam a coupla times.”  Dean shook his head, taking the curve ahead swift and smooth.  “Gotta love family.”
The lamp was still on the lowest setting, that weird level that makes you blink several times until you adjust to it, and usually it’s not enough light so you turn it up a notch.  But even in the dim light, Cas was glowing.
Cas nodded.  “I understand.  I do not want my heart exploding like a ripe melon in the sun.  But Dean...we have to DO something.”
“I’ll be sure to schedule an appointment,” Sam assured, walking him to the door.  “Thanks for stopping by.  Tell Bess we said hello.”
Gabe went to the railing and leaned over it, trying to see along the house.  He stared as hard as he could through the dark, catching a tiny movement.  “She’s back there by the picnic table in their back yard,” he whispered.
She hesitated but got back in the car, driving away.  After the car had pulled out of the gate, he looked back at the number.  He looked at Buddy.  “I hope you called that right.”
“Good job, Sammy,” Dean admitted.  “Hope we get to be on the same cell block when we all go down for this shit.”
“Four martinis coming right up!” Cindy whisked the bowl away, her dress flaring out and swishing just as jauntily as her ponytail.
Twenty minutes later, bowl in Gabe’s hand, smile on Sam’s face, Gabe’s hand in his, Dean keeping a low profile, they all left the comfortable ease of Sam’s house and went two doors down to the Smith’s house.
Understanding dawned on Sam as Dean and Cas looked at him, a little more confused.  Nicky the mermaid and Weems must be imaginary friends.  “Are they friends with the other little girl,” he glanced at Cas who gave him a I-don’t-know face, “um, Maddie, that’s her name.  Are they friends of Maddie’s friend?”
The song changed, Led Zeppelin’s Kashmir thumping into the floorboards.  Dean’s face lit up and Fletcher spun around on his stool.
“So, she got me off on some lame-ass technicality.  Picked me up from jail in a cruiser and took me straight to her house.”
Sam frowned.  “You don’t have to be embarrassed of making out with somebody, Cas.  It’s pretty normal, ya know.”
Cas handed his brother a soda.  “Sam feels certain that the police department here is corrupt.  He thinks they are covering up crimes to keep Charming Acres motto of ‘the safest town in the USA’.”
“Fuck,” Dean growled into his neck.  Castiel gasped, grabbing Dean’s hand to stop it from pumping anymore and making him scream.
He saw through the entire thing.  Gabe was scared Sam was not interested.  Not in love.  That the marriage wouldn’t last.  He pulled his phone out, calling Sam.
“Let’s go.”  He took Cas’ hand, and the pair waved their goodbyes as everyone gave them a wave or a holler.
She grinned, something akin to predatory, with her neat white teeth.  Her extended hand pointed to the badge on her uniform.  “Says ‘Sheriff’ on this badge, Mr. Whittaker.  So, I think I can.  And will.”
Balthazar’s stuffy voice came across the speaker loud and clear for both of them to hear.  “You Neanderthal!  As if breaking my nose wasn’t enough?  You vandalize my property?”
Sonny came around the counter with two picture-perfect milkshakes, topped with whip cream and one of them with two cherries.  “First one’s on the house!”  She sat the vanilla one in front of Sam and the half strawberry, half chocolate with two cherries in front of him.
Cas, enthralled with Dean, pulled him in for a deeper kiss.  “You smell delicious,” he whispered as Dean’s mouth moved along his chin and down his neck.  “So good,” he whispered again.
“Now that you’ve brought that to my attention,” Don turned, taking the framed picture off the wall, and chucked it into the garbage can next to his desk, “I’ll be getting rid of that.”
Cas nodded, leaning against the porch railing.  “I’ve been traveling for almost three years now and when I thought about settling down...I would prefer to be close to you guys.”
It was enough to make Castiel grin.  He knew Luc wasn’t all bad.  It was just that usually bad was all you got.  “What’s his name?”
Cas turned back to their brothers with a grin and must have flipped them off because Sam and Gabe both gasped ridiculously.
“Like you’re awesome,” Sam supplied softly, knowing it to be true.  “Cas always asks about you when we talk.  He’d get the funniest tone when he asked about you and Aaron.  I could tell he hated the guy without ever meeting him.”
“It was my stupid dad,” Gabriel admitted, sitting back on the wide shelf.  “Got drunk and was throwing shit at us.”
Cas opened his mouth, but Sam’s grin widened as he held a finger over his lips in a sign to be quiet.  Cas tilted his head, narrowing his eyes as he peered closer at Dean.  The man was sitting there sleeping.
Another challenge.  Castiel watched as Dean walked out of the bathroom.  How the hell did he stay so cool headed?  Castiel shut the stall door and pulled himself together as quick as he could.
“Wow.  You got a swell brother,” the man said.  “This is the newest grill, just out this year.  One side is charcoal and the other is gas.  And I already hooked up the gas tank for you!  Free of charge at Chip’s!”
Sam smiled shyly down to the table before it turned more serious.  “Do you think the mayor is encouraging police to cover up serious crimes to make the town look better?”
Five miles down the road, when everyone had settled in a bit, Castiel let his hand wander over to Dean’s thigh.
She flashed a grin, the familiar grin she often wore like a mask, shaking her head so her ponytail swung merrily.  “It’s no problem!  Be back shortly to check on you!”  She turned away and was gone.
“Shit, that was fast,” Sam frowned.  He turned back to Castiel with a worried look.  “It’s a bad idea, isn’t it?”
“I’m not as shy as I used to be, Dean.”  He gave him a challenging look, to which Dean only grinned.  Dean obviously didn’t believe him.  The cold truth was, Dean had avoided him after the kiss.  So Castiel avoided him back.  If Dean was going to pull the bravado card, so was he.
“Sully said the coroner said Gary’s heart ‘exploded’.  Now the paper says cause of death was ‘heart issues’,” Sam asserted.
Dorothy pulled up beside them with Charlie in tow.  “Hey bitches!” Charlie yelled, jumping out of the car, petting a relieved Buddy.
“No amount of ketchup is going to save those,” Cas said, earning a chuckle from Dean.  He stepped even closer, smelling fresh shampoo and a trace of beer from Dean.  “I overheard Olivia and Gary making plans to meet at the park across from Moonlight Diner tomorrow to have ‘their own little picnic’.”  He knew he was gossiping, but any excuse to lean this close to Dean was a thrill.  And the closer he got, the deeper Dean’s blush crept.  It was adorable.
Dean sat back in his chair in the war room.  The bright branches and flowered Fresca on the walls gave this room a lighter feel than most of the house.
“We won’t stay long.  Don’t worry, we aren’t partying up here.  Just sit back and enjoy the ride.”  Luc gave him a sweet smile, settling Castiel’s nerves a bit.
“Are you kidding?  These are the best!” Gabe laughed, taking the box and distributing the little sparklers.  Castiel and Sam took two each and Dean looked at Gabe like he was a moron.  “Come on, Dean,” Gabe teased, “you know you wanna!”
Castiel’s breath caught.  They had a lot of uncertainty ahead with all of them moving and starting over again.  But Dean felt so solid.  So certain.  He did not care if Sioux Falls was their home to be.  They could move twice a year for the rest of their lives for all he cared.  Dean was his home.  Dean delighted him in ways he never knew possible.  “I would follow you anywhere,” he said, taking Dean’s hands to bring them to his mouth and kiss them before returning them and joining him in this gentle, sultry, teasing dance their fingers did to both cocks lying there between them.
“You guys pick on Sully too much.  It’s not cool.  The guy is as innocent as a puppy.” Sam said defensively.
“Oh yeah.”  Dean wandered toward the door, turning back to him with an endearing grin.  “No ladies up here, right?”
Dean pumped harder, keeping Cas off kilter and barely hanging on.  Both his hands gripped Cas’ hips rough as he pounded inside.  “You good?” Dean huffed.
“Cas!” Dean shook him gently.  “Breathe, buddy.  What’s goin’ on?  Did you take something?  A pill? Smoke something?”
They all walked to the local park the next evening to watch the fireworks for the Fourth of July.  The park was crowded with kids, teens, families, and vendors.
He collected his bags from the cabbie and looked up at the three-story, pink Victorian in front of him.  Dowling’s Boarding House stood in front of him like a life size dollhouse.  Across the street was Harrington’s Soda Shoppe, adorned with an eight-foot-tall strawberry milkshake.  The place looked like it was straight out of the 1950s.
Castiel couldn’t imagine what Wayne had done to lead Marion to these assumptions, but he listened to her, nonetheless.  His phone buzzed and he opened a text from Dean.
“I knew the clown was gonna freak you out, Sam,” Gabe shook his head, putting an arm around Sam’s shoulders.
“Ooohh,” Dean chuckled, seeing Sam through the windshield, still sitting in the back.  Hopefully, he’d aggravate Doug so much he’d forget about arresting Sam.  “You coulda at least kept it goin’ by callin’ me Bo.  Or Luke.  Either one works.”
Castiel schooled his elevated eyebrows back to a more normal look.  “Yeah!  That would be great!  If we wait until the end of summer, I can help too.  I got that job at the convenient store.”
Jimmy Tomorrow’s Emporium was shut down the same day the SWAT team had taken Ed, Madge, Justin, Cindy, Chip, Wayne, Nellie, and Mahoney away.  Jimmy went to prison and the store was gutted.  At the time, he and Gabe were wondering if Charming Acres was going to become the town he initially thought it had been.  Then Mr. Carpiak opened Broward County Mystery Spot in its stead.  The place gave him the creeps and that was that.  There was no salvaging their love for Charming Acres.
“I have to say, I was not expecting you to...return,” Wayne said smoothly, holding the small pistol with a weak grip and limp wrist that told Sam the man was not too familiar with handling a gun and therefore, might not use it as readily as he appeared.
“You did?  You’re alright, Bobby.  I don’t care what Ellen says about ya.”  He winked at Ellen, who threw her napkin at him.
“Come on, Cas!” Sam yelled from the water.  Castiel fought the nudging thickening in his shorts, giving his mom one last look.
He closed his eyes, putting Dean’s hand back in front of him, in case one of their moms checked on them.
“You need to clean up these woods, Robert,” Gabe complained, searching as he went.  He could see the back of a house that had a dimly lit light in its yard.  “Bobby!” He whisper/yelled.
“We went to sleep.  It was like four in the morning before we had the frame together and the bed made so we both lay on it try it out and fell asleep.”
“Yeah,” Sully said sadly.  “I just wanted to make sure you two were okay.  If you need to talk, I’m always here.”
Dean turned, his back on the mattress now, looking at him curiously.  “Oh really.  What am I saying right now?”
“M so sleepy,” Gabe giggled again, arms flopping out to the sides.  Sam bent over and kissed his stomach.  He grinned wide and shifted his hips.  “You might have to do all the work.”
The puppy bounded around awkwardly, and the song made it all the more funny.  They both laughed.  When the video ended, Castiel found himself exactly where he had been wishing he could be all week.  Tight against Dean, shoulder to shoulder, leg against leg.
Naoki nodded, wiping tears from her eyes.  She no sooner had gone inside than Olivia pulled up in a rush and  a squeal of tires.
His hands abandoned their cocks, making Dean gasp.  He bent and scooped Dean up, who quickly wrapped his legs around his hips.  Castiel was no stranger to moving grown men around, but he was still elated to see that he could handle Dean.  And by the excited, breathy look of awe on his face, Dean liked it too.
“Watch this!”  Fletcher ran, sliding in his socks to the other end of the room, strumming an air guitar.
He could feel a line of warmth from Cas’ body and shivered at the temperature difference.  And the touch.  He inched closer.
Castiel didn’t even bat an eye at the familiar annoyance that flared inside him when Dean talked about dating or who he had slept with.  Dean was only slightly less piggish than Gabriel.  And that had only been for the past year while he dated Lisa.  Castiel couldn’t say he liked Lisa.  He hated her, in fact.  But Dean had settled down a bit.
“See,” Cas tipped his head, smiling even harder.  “You said ‘but’ and meant ‘oh no, he heard me? Now what do I do with my tough bad boy image?”
Castiel got home at 4:30 in the morning.  He didn’t bother to sneak in.  He locked the front door and threw the keys on the table by the door.  He trudged up the steps and fell into bed.
“We’ll ask Bobby in the morning.  He said he’d explain everything.  He seems to think we’d like it here.  He’s gotta have a reason why.”
“So, you want me to sneak into Mr. Whittaker’s office,” he clarified, Gabe and Rufus nodding.  “And what am I looking for?”
This room was where they had sleepovers, they played games, they spent their rainy days, and one of the two places in this world where Castiel felt comfortable and at home.
His head jerked up sharply when Dean’s hand landed on his shoulder.  “Come on, Cas.  It’ll be alright.  No one is going to care.  No one that matters anyway.  And if anyone gives you any shit, you just tell me.”
“So, who all is making money from the pawn shop?” Dean asked, sighing his stress out as he took a bite of his tart.
Castiel stood there a moment, unsure what to think or do.   Dean could be lying.  But he looked too rattled.
“Sam, you bought this dude a freaking lion.  You’re going to be a great husband.  Just...think of Dad as learning what NOT to do with your life.”
“Son of a bitch!” Gabe gasped, whipping around to give Marion an apologetic look, making her look even more intrigued.
“Too late,” Dean grinned, standing up, swinging his chair back to where it had been.  “I’ll move the body.  Nellie knows we’re here, but they don’t have any reason to suspect there’s a body here, right?”
“Pastors who work for churches are often given a home.  A parsonage.  If The Roadhouse is the Mecca for hunters, these homes are like parsonages.”
“And the space map,” Cas grinned down at him.  He looked up at Dean and slipped him another trademark wink.
Bobby’s eyes jumped back to Sam’s house before settling on the brothers again.  “Yeah.  She was...a realtor, I think.”
Sam grinned, refilling Cas’ drink and Gabe’s before refreshing his own and picking up his cards for the next hand.  “I know all your tells, Dean.  It’s Cas that I can’t read for shit.”
Dean put his arm around Castiel’s shoulders and his other hand slid to the back of his head.  His eyes barely closed before their lips met.
Cas sighed, staring at the blank computer in front of him.  “I can tell you that I find her records puzzling.  Dr. Mahoney began prescribing Mrs. Golden an anticholinergic medication several weeks ago.”
Deb stepped closer to Gabe.  “They’re getting counseling.  There’s no way that marriage is going to last.”  She gave them a polite grin before heading over to the food table.
“I swear it’s amplifying,” Gabe countered, plastering on a grin as Justin and Cindy approached them.
He showered quickly, wondering the entire time if Dean was watching him through the glass wall.  He may have stretched and bent and stroked himself unnecessarily, in hopes of driving Dean crazy.
“Sam just texted,” Gabe said to the group.  “He and Fletcher walked Maddie home.  Now they’re playing Candyland in the kitchen.”
Ellen quirked a grin at Fletcher.  “Led Zeppelin and a gentleman?  We’re gonna be friends.  I’ll be right back with a bigger bowl of ice cream.”
Cas piped in again.  “We thought one of you killed him.  Dean thought it was you,” he said with blatant honesty, looking at Deb, “but I wasn’t convinced it wasn’t you,” he admitted, looking at Olivia.
Dean pulled up to Crowley’s, banging the ridiculous dog head door knocker.  He flipped off the security camera, knowing Crowley would check it first.
“M sorry, Cassie,” Chuck sighed, his head dropping onto Gabe’s shoulder.  “Don’ wanna get you guys in trouble.”
Cas’ low chuckle had nothing to do with the warm sunshine that ended as the smooth, blemish-free asphalt of Lily Dale Lane turned to roughly patched blacktop of Singer Lane.  The heat and light of the day were immediately cloaked by the thick canopy of trees on both sides of the road.  The hush of their active neighborhood was replaced with the light buzz of insects and the occasional bird, all of Charming Acres insulated away by the shady woods.
They walked along the final hallway more quietly than before and Cas hoped he had not given away how bizarre he thought the man was.  Surely that would not start him off on a good foot in his new job.
Holy fuck wow.  Dean felt his eyes go as wide as saucers as Cas’ did the same, Sam choked, and Gabe (who was hugging Donna hello) laughed loud and off beat, saying entirely too loud, “Man that drive!  How ‘bout that drive, huh, Sammy?”
They rode quietly to the other end of town, to a nice house past KU campus. He was not surprised when Luc waved him to come along.
“My first patient of the day said his daughter called and there was quite a to-do at Sunset Fields this morning.  Her best friend’s Grammy is there and told her, who told -”
Gabe’s stomach clenched.  “What do you mean?  What’s going on with them?”  He stood up, pacing in Marion’s room.
“We painted both bathrooms and the kitchen last week,” Sam went on as Dean followed him on his tour of the house.  “I’m not bothering with the office.  I’ll just be working in there when I need to.  And Gabe swears he won’t ever bring work home.”
“What if the basement door was at someone else’s house?  Or at the pawn shop!” Cas asked, his face lighting up.  “Doesn’t Fletcher stay at the Carrigans an evening a week?”
“Cas isn’t like that.”  He stood up, coming closer and lowered his voice.  “Look, just try going on a DATE.  This isn’t a marriage interview.  Maybe you hit it off, maybe you don’t.  But either way, it’s worth finding out!  Don’t you think?”
“Anticholinergic medications block the effect of acetylcholine, an important brain chemical and neurotransmitter that becomes less plentiful as you age.”
“No, I’m not,” Dean grinned, thunking him on the back of the head as he brought his arm back around, taking off.
“Sheriff Jody Mills, this is Dean, Sam, Gabe, and Cas.  I just got ‘em here.  Quit tryin’ ta run ‘em off,” Bobby frowned.
Cas sat Buddy’s empty bowl next to Rum’s, letting his hand drop onto Dean’s thigh with a squeeze.  “Are you worried?”
“I have to go back to work,” Naomi said, heading back for the door.  She gave Castiel an exasperated sigh.  She turned her focus on Sam.  “I understand why you let him take the blame.  But you boys need to find a better way of handling things than fighting.”
Castiel closed his eyes, breathing out shakily.  Dean pulled his wrist, moving his hand to rest on the inside of his thigh.
“Right,” Cas said, getting up, feeling the need to be closer to him as they talked quietly.  “Something risqué might happen.”  He stopped right in front of Dean; their eyes locked into a heavy stare.  “Something not quite...gentlemanly could happen.”  Dean had little wrinkles at the outer corners of his eyes.  A few freckles had popped out from working in the sun.  Glints of gold were sprinkled through his brown hair, which was a lighter brown than his own, but almost hinted at being red in some light.  His chin had the hint of a cleft that might be a scar, and he was a picture of absolute perfection.
“No,” Gabe grinned.  “A mistake would involve one of us sitting here without the other.  As long as we’re together, there’s no mistakes, just...really good stories for another day.”
“What you want.  That’s the good part about being in charge.  You get to do what you want.  You just have to be ready to stop on a dime when the other person says so.”
“So... how’d it go?”  Dean looked up at him as he scrubbed the bars of the grill.  It still baffled him at times that Dean cared at all about his insignificant self.  He could be hanging out with other kids his age.  Or a girlfriend.  But today had been a family day.  It was Fourth of July weekend.  Their moms both worked tomorrow on the fourth, so they had their annual cookout today.
“Well, your town reeks.  It smells just like you.  Full of shit.”  Bobby, though his gun was lowered, still looked damn intimidating.
Gabe frowned, offering his Samshine the first drink as they moved back into the crowd of people milling about.  “Come on.  It’s not that bad here.  Example A.” Gabe pointed.
“Here,” Luc grinned.  He took the bottle, turning it upside down, putting it back in Castiel’s hand.  “Like this.”  He guided Castiel’s hand, so the bottle touched Jack’s mouth.  He pulled it back slightly, letting Jack settle for a second and then let him have it.  He tipped Castiel’s elbow up a little and angled the bottle for the best flow.
With his back to Cas, he closed his eyes, realizing how ridiculous he must look.  “Yeah, I was just gonna put it in after we flip it,” he said, smirking at his own weak-ass save.
“Aw, that make you sad?”  Castiel laughed.  He had never jabbed exchanges with Dean on this level.  He liked how it rattled him a little.  Good.  Dean needed rattled.  He also needed to come to terms with the fact that he wasn’t very straight.
“I did!  I do,” Cas said confidently, something solidifying in his already confident approach to this man.  “I...I’m thrilled you thought of me at all!”
“Yeah,” Dean huffed a laugh, glancing around the room.  “That loveseat looks a little too small,” he joked, looking adorable.  And then there was the fact he was standing there in just a towel, and Castiel realized just how gorgeous Dean really was.  His shoulders sloped into well-muscled arms, with hands that looked rough on the palms from years of cold and hauling rope.  His pecs were well defined, one bearing a tattoo.  His abs were mildly defined, tapering into the fluffy edges of his towel.  Only then did Cas realize just how boldly he was staring.  How he was devouring the man with his eyes.  His own gaze snapped up to meet Dean’s steady one.
“I LIKE Brussels sprouts!” Cas laughed, throwing his hands wide.  “But these are...bitter!  And dry!  How do you even make Brussels sprouts dry?!”
His lips moved in an amused tilt, but the look in his eyes was dreamy.  “I’m glad we finally got together,” Dean whispered.  “Never realized you were into me.”
“No.  You successfully chased him away.”  He could move over.  He could make room.  But the feel of Dean so squished against him was heavenly.
“Definitely,” Dean grinned as Cas excused himself from the little group and came toward them with a look of relief, stopping short as three kids ran past him.  Sully stopped him, looking like he was inviting him to play some game with the kids, which Cas was politely declining.
“I figured you could keep it for your guest bedroom or Cas or I will take it with us,” Dean went on.
“Damn,” Dean shook his head.  It could be a toss-up between him and his brother as to who got up first in the mornings.  But lately, he was sleeping in like never before.  He knew damn well it had everything to do with the strong arms that held onto him, keeping him warm and happy.
“Sam and my mom think I’m still going out with Brooke.”  Dean took the still-open bag from Castiel’s arms, tossing it on the bed.  “I broke up with Brooke a week after I kissed you.”
Castiel wasn’t too sure about that.  His few seconds of composure were not nearly enough to fortify him for such a move.
Cas slowed his pace slightly when he was surprised to see a car pull in the driveway.  The headlights marked the slow, unsure progression of the blue car.
They stared for a whole minute.  He wanted to let Dean know that he was interested in him very much.  He wanted to kiss him, take him to the picnic and parade him around like the trophy he was.  He wanted to sweep him off his feet and buy a house together and wake up next to him.
“Mr. Stevens died in the bathroom!  He came out of there holding his head and clutching his chest then he ran back into the bathroom and...POW!  He went all Scanners!  His heart exploded!  He died!”
“Didn’t know you were so vindictive,” Dean chuckled, picking up a plate to start loading it with the assorted food.
Dean handed Gabe the huge platter of roast beef sandwiches while he got chips and condiments to go with them.  “Let’s go feed the troops.  Everyone will calm down when they have something to chew on.”
And so, the night continued.  Sully went home after hanging out with Sam and Fletcher for half an hour in the kitchen.  Then the pair had set up the telescope on the deck.  Cas and Dean were MIA for 15 minutes (which Gabe knew damn well was enough time for the pair to have a quickie). Dean had been watching the neighbors sneak around for weeks, and seemed to find the perfect time to go missing briefly.  When the pair were back to their stations, Sam went in to put Fletcher to bed.  Rufus went home and must have gone to sleep or switched off his walkie, because he was no longer responding.  The night grew darker and the neighbors finally settled down, lights going out.  And now he couldn’t get Bobby to answer.
“We saved you seats,” Melanie added, taking the platter from Cas.  “It was Madge’s idea, but not all her ideas are so terrible.”
“Tea time at 10:00,” Gabe said under his breath, passing Cas with a wink as he toiled away with his med cart.  His brother had been working at Sunset Fields for a week now, but it was still strange, and fun, to see him working with the residents he couldn’t help but love.
Castiel assured Ms. Dowling for the third time that he and Dean were not interested in dessert.  She only relented in her offering of a large Jell-O mold of red and yellow in the shape of a ring when he explained they would be going to Harrington’s for milkshakes.
They all knew Charlie was gay.  She made no bones about it.  None of them had any issues with it, not even Dean.  But this was different.  For some stupid reason, guys had it a lot harder than girls did to be gay.  Or at least that’s how he felt in his own locked-off section of his brain.
“Now that’s what I’m talkin’ about!” Garth grinned with a nod.  “Hey, I’ll catch you fellas later.  And don’t forget to schedule yourselves appointments to come see me!  I’m the only dentist in town right now, so I get booked up pretty quick!”
Dean grinned, propping his chin on Castiel’s shoulder.  “I want the bear.  With the ‘I wuv hugs’ t-shirt on.”
“Oh, he knew.  I don’t count coming out to him.  He’s the one that told me I was a -”, Dean sucked his teeth in irritation of the bad memories.  “Well, he called me all kinds of shit.  There WAS no closet with John Winchester.  He just fucking told you how it was, why you sucked, and how worthless you were gonna be.”
“Well...the parents, Mr. and Mrs. Zeddmore, I hardly ever see.  They have a daughter in high school, Maggie, I think.  But they have this grown kid, Ed, who lives in the basement and he hangs out with these other weird guys.  I don’t know what the hell they do all day in the garage and the basement, but he’s got all this weird-ass equipment.  And he has the neighbor kid, Kat, convinced her house is haunted.”
Castiel looked at him, worry most likely evident as what had just happened sunk in.  What he had said.  And how badly he meant it.
“We’ll help you clean it out when we get home,” Castiel laughed, putting an arm around him to shake him from his souring mood.
His thoughts were interrupted when Mrs. Whittaker came to the counter.  “Evening,” she said tightly.
But for one brief moment, Dean held him tight.  He could feel his hand run through his hair and the relief as his heart rate slowed down.
He unlocked the door, heading to the reference room.  Jody and Claire sat at the small table laughing with Lee and Krissy.
“No,” Cas laughed.  “The candles.  The dart.”  He pressed his lips together, really looking at him.  “Thank you.  For everything.”
“Weems calls that sponge toast.  I told him it’s French toast, but he keeps sayin’ its sponge toast.”
An occasional outline of what might have been a roof was sensed more than seen several times until a light ahead eventually turned into a traffic light.  Streetlights lit the fronts of buildings and houses, all the while the traffic light shone green with no traffic running through it.  It changed to yellow, and Dean could not help but stare.
Cas dropped his head back, feeling Dean’s pressing into him as his mouth continued to suck at his neck.  “Someone’s been reading A/B/O Star Wars fics again,” Cas gasped.
Gabe sat up with an eager gleam in his eyes.  “Tell ya what, bro, if you haven’t gone out with anyone by June 15th, I’m setting you up on a date!”
Dean accepted the challenge, both getting into position with a raised fist over their own open palms.  They smacked fists into palms, 1, 2, 3.  Rock, Paper, Scissors...Dean landed with a cocky scissors as Sam smirked with a rock.
The room went silent.  Castiel was blushing profusely.  He turned to look at Gabriel with what he knew was some amount of shock.
“Yep,” Bobby answered.  “Might as well be, anyway.  These here are the boys that saved Fred’s life.”
Cas woke the next morning, rolling over to fit himself more tightly against Dean.  He looked up when Dean ran a slow hand down his back.  He could tell he was awake.
Dean blushed, closed his gaping mouth, and sat back.  He looked at his drink, grinning.  “Okay,” he chuckled, wishing he had something to fidget with.  He glanced out to the quiet street and then back at Cas.  Then it dawned on him that he was going to Cas’ boarding house for dinner.  Was that a...date?  No.  They were laughing.  They were kidding.  It was just for fun.  So why the wink?  Winks weren’t for fun.  He was flirting.  But he had winked at him at the picnic too.  And when they got back from the picnic!  Maybe Cas just did that.  He was just a...winker.  The word made him giggle.
Dean shoved him a step with a laugh, pushing him on the back.  While Castiel grinned at the contact, he changed gears quicker than Dean, jumping to snatch the frisbee again.
He chuckled again, moaning at his aching back.  “I’m pretty sure I said I’d never sleep on the floor again.”
“Boys!” their mom was at the top of the steps as Castiel yelled across the hall at the closed bathroom door.  “Quiet down,” she gave Castiel a stern look.
Sam laughed.  “Like you aren’t?  Let’s see, I’ve heard you want to move to Atlantic City, Chicago, Detroit, or Vegas and open up a saloon.”
“Sure,” Cas nodded, walking beside him, feeling relieved that Dean also wanted to continue the date.  “Let’s head up Prosperity Road and see what other shops are here.  There must be something to keep all these people out walking.”
Dean shrugged.  “That’s your answer, Sam.  I think you were the first one to talk me down.  This house is...intimidating.  Marriage sounds intimidating.  But I did it.  And you’ve always been a hell of a lot more sensible than me.”
“I’m quite frustrated with the whole ordeal,” Cas growled low, his arms going around Dean’s shoulders as he let himself be herded to the bedroom.
He sat behind Dean with Sam next to him and Gabe on the other side.  They had waited a long time for this beach trip.  And the three of them got to miss two days of school for it.  A long weekend at the beach was more than any of them had since they were kids.
“I love you,” Cas panted, feeling whole and loved and owned and everything he ever needed from the world.
“Probably not.  She hasn’t said much about it, really.  She’s annoyed she has to help take care of him when I’m at work or school.  My brother Michael has a kid too.  But I guess he’s better than me because he graduated high school first.  Got a job.  Then a place.  Then a girlfriend and a kid.”
“The old people were Wayne’s deal,” Chip clarified.  “Stark has too many high-class friends to be brought in on something as intricate as what we have going.  I can’t afford to run him out of town, so we have him in the deal to use as a scapegoat.  So, Wayne and Mahoney were making money to pay the bills.”
“No,” Sam agreed, squatting down next to him, looking at the paper.  “But what’s happening at Sunset Fields has got to be linked to the strip mall situation.”
Everything moved in slow motion as Donna’s voice rang out from the hall, Chip and Wayne flinching immediately.
Fletcher and Zoe were chatting, Fletcher carrying a towel and already wearing floaties on his upper arms, making Sam grin.
Her smile was wide, pinned in place with eyes wider than they should be.  “A nail?  I’m sure we have some!  Just let me ask Justin.”
They took their bags upstairs, checking out the guest  room and bathroom.  Cas went into Melanie’s room, confirming there was indeed a black and gray cat under the bed.
Sam, finished, turned around and squinted at him in the light above the sink.  “You doin’ alright?  You been kinda quiet.”
He flexed his fingers open and shut, disgusted with touching an unknown substance.  He swiped a finger through the red spray, feeling it between his thumb and fingers.  It felt sticky.  He smelled it, hit with the smell of sugar.
“It doesn’t matter who, Dean, remember?”  The pair exchanged a charged look, Dean relenting fairly easily.
“You guys are obsessed,” he muttered, sitting next to Castiel, patting him just above the knee in greeting.
Cas found himself staring, wishing Dean always talked so much.  And so freely.  He always seemed kinda quiet.  He knew he was funny.  Gabe told him stories that always made him laugh.  But the few times they had been around each other, Dean had been reserved.  The brief glimpse of how playfully funny he could be was on the porch several nights ago when the four of them were watching the neighbors sneaking around, which had been so much fun.
“I’m busy,” Dean blurted, quickly realizing how rude he sounded, amended with, “Cas and I are...going camping.”
“I couldn’t help but notice things are kinda ‘cordial’ between you and your assistant,” Dean went on, smirking.   Don laughed as if that were ridiculous.  “Pretty good with the ladies there, Mr. Stark?  It’s a blessing and a curse,” Dean nodded as if he shared the same troubles, earning him a scathing look from Cas.
He laid down, Cas snuggling into him.  He could feel Cas’ smile against his shoulder, making him stare into the night in wonder.  Why did Cas put up with his stunted emotions?
“I don’t think you’re supposed to ask me out and tell me you love me at the same time,” Castiel grinned.
Dean could not imagine being responsible for so much.  There was no way he could have made the choices Murphy had made.  But who knows what he would have done in the man’s shoes.
“You guys gotta stay over tonight.  I’m never gonna sleep!”  Sam wrapped his arm around Gabe, the pair talking about something between the two of them.
Dean leaned in a little closer as they passed a family walking together.  “You can’t say this place doesn’t give you the heebs and or jeebs.”
Cas got up from the table, approaching Dean again.  He hated when Dean was mad.  They had never gone to bed without apologizing before.  Not since they had been married over six months ago.
Cas came back in, still looking as happy as ever.  He got into bed and seemed completely unbothered by Dean staring at him in wonder.  He leaned across him, turning the light off, kissing him on his way back.
“Goldy?” Cas said as calmly as he could manage.  “Goldy, I’m going to help you lay in bed, alright?  You seem a little tired.”
There were four hallways, two for the ‘high-rollers’, he called them, and two for the average-Joes.  The nice halls had single rooms and few maintenance issues, so he ended up spending more of his time in the other two halls, fixing everything from phones to lights to beds.  He was pleased to note that all the rooms were equally cleaned, just had crappier furnishings and those guys were two to a room.
Castiel felt for the guy.  It was rare in Castiel’s life that a father wanted to be a good one.  Most of the dads he knew or knew about were so hands-off that it left a terrible taste in his mouth.  “Maybe when you graduate.  Do you have a job?  That would show you’re at least stable.”
Castiel felt like he had just jumped over a cliff.  There was no taking it back.  He looked up at Sam nervously.
Cas shrugged, starting to push his med cart closer to the next room.  “All I know is, he gave Goldy a medication she did not appear to need, falsified statements in her chart, and now she is dead.  AND she said Mahoney gave her a shot.  There are no injections on her chart, Gabriel.  The man is a danger to these people and needs removed.”
The three left the house silently, crossed the side yard and went into Sam’s house, stopping abruptly in the kitchen where Gabe still sat at the table, looking up from his phone as they came in.
“I’ll check into it,” Cas said, cutting him off as others approached to give Melanie their sympathies.
“Well, that’s why I came!” Sully piped in.  “I was at Harrington’s getting lunch when I heard Mrs. Dowling telling Sonny that it was just so wrong that that nice man, Sam, was wrapped up in whatever mess his unscrupulous friends got him in.”
“I don’t know,” Cas said slowly, his hands gripping Dean’s waist gently.  “You seem to have a way of cheating that I can’t quite figure out.”
“Drives her all over the country to compete.  And stresses about every damn thing.  Fletcher...that kid’s parents died.  Cindy’s sister was his mom.  Cindy and Justin never wanted kids.  They kinda dressed him up and toted him around at first, but I rarely see ‘im with them anymore.”  He shrugged.
Sonny disappeared to the kitchen again and Cas found himself sitting there staring at his milkshake.  “I guess that’s why the police were at the Frieling house this morning.”
Once they were home, Castiel blamed his blue mood on school and post vacation blahs.  The truth of the matter was, he was a complete addict.  He needed Dean like a fix.
“Night vision goggles,” Bobby explained, handing one set to Dean and the other to Gabe.  “Scopes, binoculars, oh, and these puppies are mine.”  He pulled a black helmet-looking contraption out of the box.  “This bad boy’s got night vision, thermal imaging, yellow light, day vision, and range-finding settings.”
He was proud of who he was.  And he was certain in the decisions he was making.  He had made his mistakes and learned from them.
It did sound fun.  Like...way more fun than it had a right to sound.  He watched Sam work for several minutes before he finally voiced the burning question in his mind.  The same question he’d woken up with and thought about all day.  “So...does that sound like...a date?”
It warmed Sam’s heart that everything was coming up roses for Garth and Bess.  He hoped all of Lily Dale was as genuine as them.
They both watched as Chip laughed at something the male officer said.  “See ya later, Pops!” The officer called, heading out the door with his partner.
“Makes sense.  So get this,” Sam started, referring to some notes he had written down.  “I got into bank statements from Dr. Mahoney.”
Madge and Nellie exchanged a look before Madge smiled overly friendly.  “I believe that’s her friend and co-worker.  They travel a lot.”
“So far, I’m in,” Dean winked, heading into the dining room.  The table was set with a white cloth and china dishes.
“He’s taking on the leprechaun?” She asked in a hushed whisper, looking quite fearful for him.  “That’s what I was afraid of!  That’s why I called the police!  To protect him, not to arrest him!”
“Thank you,” she managed, taking another deep breath, eyes rolling up as she feigned a smile.  “She wasn’t in the greatest shape, but...I still was not expecting this, ya know?”
“We’re goin’ down,” Dean said, pulling the lock out, opening the door.  He flipped the light switch up but got no light.  “Yay.”
Cas’ previously propped foot stomped to the porch.  He leaned forward with a glare that made Dean simultaneously breathless and laugh.  “She LOVES Sam!  ‘That nice, tall young man?’.” He mocked.  “You should see how she talks to me versus Sam!”
“Thanks,” Sam said softly, both he and Sonny noticing as Jimmy from the Emporium walked in.  He was surlier than most Charming Acres residents, like Bobby and Rufus, he didn’t have that brightly colored, odd, uber-happy bedazzle.  But unlike Bobby and Rufus, there was something more sinister about him.
Dean took a drink of milkshake, sucking long and hard through the straw.  On his third swallow, he looked up at Cas, who was sitting there staring at him with a very amused and happy smile.
Castiel went back to the bedroom, closing the door quietly.  Dean was in bed, covers pulled over one shoulder.
They made sure everything was in place and went back upstairs, then wound their way through the house again to go to the second floor.
“Oh...my mind gets fuzzy sometimes,” she admitted.  “Oh, Charles.  You always were so beautiful.  I’m sorry I left you penniless.  You always were such a bounder.  I hope you understand I had to hide my diamonds.”
“Something’s fishy around here,” Dean sighed, biting into a huge burger with barbecue sauce, cheese, onions, and mushrooms.
Castiel had laughed off Marion’s thoughts of Wayne Whittaker until just this very moment.  Had Sheila not said something about Mahoney, he never would have suspected something more untoward was happening with Goldy.  It was, therefore, a possibility that Wayne was up to something.  He would have to check into the building’s administrator with a bit more focus.  With all he had set into motion yesterday, he had no doubt that he would soon get an opportunity to be called into the administrator’s office.  It was not common, really, to report doctors to the Board of Physicians after so short an employment.  And if anyone connected the dots on him being the one to insist upon an autopsy...well, this might be a very short employ indeed.
“I’m proud of you, Sam.  You put your mind to it and made it happen.  Married, house, you aren’t pregnant yet, are you, Gabe?”
“I’m sure I’m ready to talk about it,” Sam assured him.  “I know I love you with all my heart, Gabe.  And I think you would be an amazing dad.”
“Sorry,” Castiel whispered, his grin quickly dropping as Dean adjusted again so his hand could move better.
Cas tossed their pillows onto ‘the pie’, which is what they all started calling it when it arrived and Dean announced it felt like heaven when he sprawled out on it.  He said that it might be better than pie.
Wayne brimmed with anger, barely masked with politeness.  He spun on his heel and marched back down the hall.
“In my personal space,” Gabe smirked.  “You’ve been in my space since you were born.  All up in my business.”
A nice long chapter!  Gabe loses a friend.  Sam and Dean find themselves running around the neighborhood at night.  And Castiel is leaving in a biiiiiig rush.
Cas served himself last, giving Dean an impressed little grin.  Dean was feeling warm and fuzzy until he took his first bite of roast.
Dean was sad to see Moonlight Motel in his rearview mirror.  Who knew a dive motel would have been such a perfect place?  But they had agreed to house sit for Melanie, and Sunday night had come much too quickly. Dean had to admit to himself that the past two days had been a lot of fun.  Cas made him hot under the collar every time he looked at him.  He made him nervous.  Excited.  And really fucking happy.  He pulled into the convenience store on the corner, the Gas-n-Sip on the edge of town, to pick up a bottle of ketchup.  Cas ate ketchup on everything.  It was adorably annoying, and he wanted to kick himself for feeding into such a habit, but more than that, loved seeing Cas grin.
The kiss that came was softer than last time.  But nowhere anything like Dean.  Luc pressed harder, pushing his tongue inside Castiel’s hesitant mouth.  Castiel was caught trying to function and trying to figure out if he even wanted this.  Luc’s hand pulled his hair, pulling Castiel away from the kiss.
“I think I better come with you,” Rufus smirked.  “You seem unsure and I can’t have you ditherin’ on the spot, screwin’ this up.”
Seeing a lump that was either a large stump or a man, he worked his way closer, shining his light on the mass.  The beam illuminated a dingy blue and white trucker cap and now he could hear the soft sounds of snoring.
Gabe blew a breath out.  “My pain in the ass friend.  And my brother’s boyfriend.  And my husband’s brother.  Take your pick, they’re all accurate.”
Dean could have watched Cas chop vegetables for hours.  He made it look like an art form.  He made him want to eat vegetables.  There was something graceful about the way he wielded a knife.
“I am,” Cas grinned, kissing him on the mouth playfully, then again, and again, until playful turned to steamy.  Not until Dean was chasing after him with kisses did he get out of the bed.  He ran water until it was warm, then came to the bed and wiped Dean clean.  It was obvious no one had ever done this for him.  He tried to take the washcloth several times, Cas batting his hand away gently.
“Dean...I don’t know what else to say.  I’m sorry I didn’t believe you.  It’s not my fault he touched me.”  A flash of him squeezing his ass crashed through Cas’ memory.  He shivered at the thought, hugging his arms to himself.
“Yeeeeah.  Gabe was freaking out when they started putting lights up.”  While it wasn’t the same train and sled the Carrigan’s had out all year, it still jangled their nerves.  “Ed and Madge are both in ‘hospital jail’ they call it.  Ed says the food is better in hospital-jail than regular jail.  They got all kinds of charges against them but nothing as serious as Justin and Cindy.”
Castiel took a step, wanting away from the topic.  Dean grabbed his arm, pulling him back and turning him to face him.  A look of real concern had his usually smirking mouth tipped too serious.
Sam knelt down, wishing he could help him.  “Well, thank you, and thanks, Weems.  Did Nicky like his air guitar?”
In all the theories being slung around nightly by Sam, Gabe, and Cas, Dean had been stewing on all of them.  Watching and waiting.  He knew how to read people.  As far as he could tell, it appeared almost every adult in the neighborhood was suspect as hell.
A jaunty whistle could be heard suddenly from deeper in the house, nearing the reference room.  Gabe, Dean, and Garth walked in, Garth whistling happily.
“Didn’t really look like someone storming away from catching their spouse with another lover,” Cas said quietly.
“We don’t mind,” Cindy said, looking just as blankly cheerful as if she were saying she didn’t mind picking up his mail.  Justin grinned just as surely.
“Better save some energy for me tonight, then.”  Dean winked, giving him a flirty smile as he headed for their bathroom.
The familiar rumble of an engine broke through the moment.  Castiel turned, watching as a shiny black Impala pulled up next to their car.
“Yeah.  They want me to come in for training next week.  So, by the time school is over, I’ll be working as many hours as they’ll give me.”
They moved as quietly as possible, only sounding like a small herd of rhinos as they snapped fallen twigs and bickered.
“I work at the local bank,” Gary said, “but I just invested in the plans for a shopping center to be developed.”
He kissed Dean’s fingers again, praying he had not just ruined one of the hottest, most soul-soothing moments of his life.
Dean gave him an incredulous look.  “Every time I asked Sam about how you were doing, I figured you’d be getting married.  I don’t know how you’re still available.”
She nodded, proud as a mama bear.  “Glad you’re home in one piece,” she said more quietly, hugging them both.
Bobby shrugged.  “Comes with land and homes for each pair of ya.  Jack, sweet kid that he was, won’t be back.  He donated all the land here, and the house to the hunters.  Just down the lane there’s another house, just as nice as this one.”
He jogged down the narrow sidewalk that led to the main sidewalk.  He checked the traffic and dodged across the street.
Before Cas could step away, Dean’s hand seemed to touch his longer than necessary.  Quickly picking up on the hint, Cas took his hand with a confident smile and a smooth grasp.  Dean’s cheeks flushed a little, but he laced his fingers in his easily.
“Her grandma’s at Sunset Fields.  Something Golden.  Everyone calls her Goldy.  She’s a spunky old lady.  I like her.”
Our boys are doing what they are good at.  Only this time they have a whole support system to work with.  I hope you enjoyed!
They headed to Melanie’s but parked in front of Sam and Gabe’s house since Maggie now had two cars parked in front of Sue’s house, crowding into the front of Melanie’s.
Castiel pulled him through the door, through the kitchen, and down the hall to their room.  He sat the guitar in the corner.
As the crowd broke apart when the speech ended, Sam gave Gabe an incredulous look when he made a beeline for the Smiths.  Whatever he was saying, he looked really excited about it, making Cindy and Justin smile.  His gaping jaw snapped shut when Gabe took Fletcher by the hand and headed toward him, leaving Cindy and Justin behind.
“And...” Dean blushed a little, “it wouldn’t matter if we were suddenly over-run by zombies at this point, because that kiss made this entire day worth it.”
“My mother would kill me if baby-daddy Luc started hanging around.  She thinks Gabriel’s questionable.”
After some back and forth and hashing out ideas, they came to the decision that Father Murphy would try to reconnect with his daughter first.  The church would have to make an exception.  Kripke Manor would be a back-up option for her.  They all agreed not to turn her in.  After all, she was still only human.
She huffed a laugh through a shaky breath.  “Stop.  This wasn’t your fault, Castiel.”  They held a meaningful look as her mouth trembled while holding a smile.  Cas nodded, looking about as put together as she was before he turned to Camille, hugging her as well.
“I was going to ask you out for some milkshakes at Harrington’s.  But if you’d rather have nachos -”
Castiel had learned months ago to not question too deeply the comings and goings of hunters.  If Jody was on board, that was enough for him.  “Very well.  I’ll pass her information on.”
“Cassie said you were helping the neighbor kid,” Gabe said, tossing a candy bar wrapper in the trash.
“Whatever!” Dean laughed, dodging around him to get his things from the shower.  “You and Sam aren’t always quiet.”
Without thought or consciousness for game rules, he pulled Dean tight against him and let out a guttural groan at the feel of Dean’s hard dick pressing into his.
Dean could tell Cas didn’t like the sound of this.  He reached over, giving his knee a squeeze.  Cas smiled faintly, but he could see that Cas was now on even more of a mission than before.
They both got in the front seat, Dean starting the engine with a satisfied hum in his soul.  He had been on plenty of road trips in his life.  Most of them were just him and Baby.  Some were him and Sam.  This one was just him and Cas.  All of them had their beauty, but this trip had been nothing short of amazing so far.
Dean sat up, turning and laying him on the cushion.  He pulled up, grabbing lube and coating his hand quickly.
Castiel stepped over to him, leaning down to kiss him.  “For that?  For kissing you?” Castiel whispered.
“I told him to stay out of my dresser!” His roommate, Stanley, hollered from where he laid in his bed.
“Freaking out,” Sam said with a mix of amusement and confusion again.  “It’s just Cas.  He’s a nice guy.  Don’t be a dick and he won’t be one either.”
A row of motorcycles lined the porch and the small parking lot in front of the restaurant/bar was fairly full of old cars and trucks.
“Come on, you have a big date tonight,” Castiel grinned, grabbing his book bag and leaving the room.
Castiel shut his eyes, breathing.  He had to breathe, or Dean would stop.  He relaxed his body, taking the touch he craved day and night.
Luc pouted.  “I know.  I can be an asshole from time to time.  But, I try to limit it to the weekends now.”  He threw Castiel a grin.
He stood up abruptly.  “Come on, Cas.  Food’s ready.”  That was loud enough for the others to hear.  But there was no way he was getting up right now, sporting the erection Dean had created in a matter of seconds.
“There are no friendships here,” Cas bit back.  “You will be compensated for your sign and your lawn.  As for your business, that’s your problem.”  He stepped between Gabe and Sam, coming toe to toe with Balthazar.  “And don’t ever touch me again.  You have no idea what I’m capable of.  A very PUBLIC sexual harassment case would be very messy.  Mr. Rochè.”
Sam laughed.  “Dean can act like the biggest, most ridiculous flirt, and pick up a guy for a fling with no problem.  But any time he’s serious about someone...it’s like he completely freezes up!  He gets shy!”
“Gotta get you braver somehow, right?  I mean, you might be the one making the moves, rather than waiting on them to do it.”
It was stuffy in the small room and Dean was sprawled out on the double bed with no shirt on.  The edge of his boxers could be seen just where the blanket covered the rise of his behind.
As an older, jovial looking man and a woman who appeared to be his daughter, joined the picnic, Cas watched with interest as 70% of the crowd perked up like lemmings.
Dean wrapped his arms around him, soaking in the kindness.  “You’re a good man,” he mumbled back, getting another kiss to his temple.  Dean turned, their mouths finding each other.  They exchanged several gentle kisses before Dean’s sleeping dragon of unfulfilled lust had him pressing into him harder until their tongues were greedily seeking touch.  He huffed an excited little sound when Cas’ hands gripped him securely along his hips and pulled him flush with his pelvis.  Dean ground against him even harder, blessedly getting a groan that spoke the same language that was swirling in Dean’s brain.
Dean laughed, nodding.  “I heard that too.  Can’t say I wanna even go in a nasty-ass place called ‘Weasel’s’.  Besides, could be a dude on the other side of that hole.”
The two officers sat at the bar, Sonny bringing them both coffee.  She was talking to them quietly when Chip came through the door of the kitchen.  He made a beeline for the police, Sonny stepping out of his way.  She kept moving with her coffee pot and several mugs in her hand.  It was the worried frown that had Gabe more than curious.  Usually the robots didn’t actually frown.  He lifted his hand, catching Sonny’s attention.  She came toward them, Sam watching her just as curiously.  “Second thought, I’ll have some coffee,” Gabe grinned up at her.
Castiel looked at the floor, too ashamed to meet Dean’s eye.  He flinched when Dean stepped over and put a hand on his shoulder.
“Can I help you?” Cas asked with a rigid stance.  As amused as Dean could be at Cas’ glowering, he knew very well he could also be a force to be reckoned with.
Dean looked at Cas, eyes full of worry.  Cas shrugged.  He had no idea what to think of Bobby’s insane hallucinations.
From the vantage spot on the top step, Sam could see Maggie Stark come out of Sue’s house, saying hi to the kids as they turned to walk along the house and into the backyard.  Before Maggie got into her car, Sue came out and the pair had a quick conversation.  The way they stood so close and looked from Maggie’s house and then toward theirs, made the entire exchange look quite conspiratorial.
Dean shut his eyes in mortification before it occurred to him to play it off as nothing.  Luckily, Cas was a little quicker.
Luc pointed to the couch.  There, sleeping on a blanket, was the tiny bundle.  Castiel drew closer with a growing grin.   “He’s got blonde hair, like you,” Castiel whispered.
He turned carefully and took the two steps to the bed.  And though he wanted to throw him on it and ravage him, he rounded the end of the bed and laid him down like the gem he was.  It was not just his eyes that sparkled like emeralds, but his entire body was precious and needed to be tended to and marked.  Marked with kisses and raking fingernails, and tasted.
“Exactly,” Dean pointed.  “I’m tellin’ ya, I called this as a scorned wife thing!  I just had the wrong wife!”
Dean frowned.  “That’s not what I -.  Never mind.”  He grinned, watching Castiel work out the wording.
Dean sighed and rinsed, wishing the weight of his memories went down the drain like his body wash.  Aaron had been...convenient.  And though neither of them was heartbroken over their ending, Dean still felt like it was a failure on his part.  The guy had wanted to love him.  But so far, he was unlovable.  As he turned the water off, he pressed his hands over his eyes and over his head to wipe the water away.  Today was a new day.  If he let himself, he could have something more now.  Sam was settled.  Gabe was going to be here for Sam.  And he had finally had enough of the sea.  Enough self-isolation.  He felt pretty damn grounded, even if it did end up being in this weird-ass town.  As he dried himself off, he brushed off his past mentalities and shrugged on a new attitude.  Cas was, okay CAS was out of his league, but dammit, he could give it a try.
Dean sat a mug of hot coffee on the table in their work room.  The war room, they had dubbed it since the Serengeti dining room was used as a dining room now, was on the second floor and open partially to the grand staircase.  While it did not have the character of the Serengeti dining room, it was tastefully adorned with floor plans, framed and captured a time when they all were coming together to battle the beautiful home they shared today.  A beautiful mahogany table took the stage in the center of the room, covered with plans for the third and fourth floors.  A ridiculous throne manned the head of the table.  Not as majestic as the lion one downstairs.  This one was oak with a giant peacock.  A brilliant blue cushion kept Gabe comfortable and preening.  The brilliance of the arrival of it was one of the many fond memories Dean cherished.  He was the one that bought it.  Gabe about turned inside-out at Dean unveiling it in the foyer.  Cas had damn near exploded, incredulous that Dean would encourage such a venture.
Dean laughed a half-strangled chortle.  “He’s new at camping.  It’s...a whole...thing.  But we’re busy.”
“Yep.”  Dean flipped the camera view so Bobby could see the yards.  “Tell Fred to perk up.  This oughta be a pretty entertaining show.”  He whacked Sam on the arm and the pair moved out of the woods and through the backyard.  He handed Sam his phone, picking the lock to the back door quickly.
Gabe popped a lollipop into his mouth.  Sunday in Charming Acres.  It was so domestic.  Since his Samshine was stormy with a chance of rain (thanks to Cindy Smith - who he’d pegged a bitch from her first ‘Oh you!’), he figured he needed to cheer his Samshine up a bit.
From experience with Cas, he knew one washcloth was soapy and the other one was just wet.  They would be scalding hot in the bathroom so by the time they got to Dean’s body, they were still warm.  Cas was sweet that way.
He arrived at the group with a guarded look of exhaustion.  He smiled at Dean with a look of thanks, making Dean want to fucking backflip.  “You looked like you needed to be rescued,” Dean grinned.
“Wow.  You think we’re being ridiculous?” Sam asked, worrying that they were all completely in over their heads.
They stood on a wide, wrap-around porch, staring out into the night.  He had already paced around the porch, which went the entire way around the house, stopping to touch the chain holding a porch swing on one corner, running his hand along a wide banister as he walked along one long stretch.  Besides the double front door, there was a side door and a back door that went into the kitchen.  As he looked out across the expanse of what he was pretty sure was a yard, three sides of it were edged in trees.  The lane they had driven in on was open with some bushes.
“It’s cool, Gabe,” Charlie said, leaning forward to really look at him.  “If you are, that’s fine.  Don’t let anyone make you feel less-than for it.”
“Sparkle says you might never be fake because you have a really awesome husband.  But who knows?  You could be like Sonny.  Fun one day then...” her eyes followed Sonny as she grinned at Jimmy and Wayne, taking their orders, “that.”
Cas was the first to address the mood in the group.  “I need to get back to work, but I believe we should figure out if Wayne Whittaker is involved somehow.”
“I was just pissed, ya know?  Fucker.  Touching Cas like that, pissing you off.  Causing a fight.  I wanted him to pay.  I wanted him to regret it.  He can fix his stupid sign.  And his grass will grow back.”
Dean didn’t answer, but Cas clarified his own stance.  “I just want to be sure Garth knows what he is getting into.”
“It’s a show.  Animal Kingdom?” Sam shook his head, waving Dean off.  “What the hell happened to our back up?”
Castiel had to laugh.  He went to his next class, putting his head down as the teacher started a movie.  It had been Castiel’s experience that most tough kids from his neighborhood were only misunderstood.  Sure, they might get in more fights.  They might look a little rougher around the edges, but they were all just people with reasons for acting the way they did.
“It’s quiet back here,” Sam noted, all of them watching the trees as if Bobby or Rufus might pop out wearing sniper camouflage with rifles in hand.
Sam couldn’t stop looking between the two of them.  The change in Dean was pretty telling.  He couldn’t remember the last time Dean looked so happy and relaxed.  “And the date went well,” he stated again.
C) There was another guy in a shady corner table chain smoking and watching all of them with a little too much interest.
Don seemed to take him at him at his word anyway.  His eyes flitted calmly over the three of them.  “You’re interested in investing?”
“Yeah, sure!” Sam nodded, walking out with him.  “Thanks for the...dessert.  That was really nice of you.”
Dean’s mouth gaped as he turned to Cas with a grin.  He was plenty used to language like that, he just hadn’t expected it from sweet, mild-mannered Castiel angel-to-the-dying Novak!
A cavern of hope nearly brought Castiel to his knees.  “Because of me?” He whispered, afraid to speak a hope so fragile too loud.
“Young couple.  I never met the husband, but the wife is Becky Rosen.  They have a couple kids too, but they’re young.”
“Jeez,” Castiel went to walk away, but stopped at the solid, open palm to his chest from Dean, who pushed him back against the house gently.
He regretted the invention of t-shirts, wishing their bare skin was touching, but he was incredibly happy to have this.  He hugged Cas’ arms to him, kissing his forearm.  His grin widened with absolute glee when Cas left a chain of soft, little kisses on the back of his neck and just under his ear.
Castiel exchanged a look with Dean.  Dean huffed a laugh, getting out.  He let Castiel in, not breaking for a second as Castiel rubbed against him to squeeze into the seat and slide over.  “Hey, Jo.”
It was 2am and the neighborhood was quiet.  It was a Thursday night, and he was surprised to see Dean, Benny, Charlie, and a few others hanging around Dean’s car.
“Well, it sure is good to see you smiling so much,” Camille grinned, taking Fletcher’s hand.  Her playful grasp suddenly jolted into a hard grip, making Fletcher’s face drop from a happy grin to fear in an instant.  Camille’s eyes rolled up unnaturally and her entire body went stiff.  Fletcher whined, pulling his hand with no escape.  Sam, Dean, Melanie, Gabe, and even Cas stared at the two in shock.
He followed his mom into the house where she made a straight beeline for the couch.  “I wanted such a better life for you!  I had hopes.  Such high hopes.”
“Hey, Ed,” Sam asked, figuring he might as well make the most of a visit from the odd neighbor, “have you heard anything about Naoki’s daughter, Kat?”
“Well, I’m so sorry to hear that,” Dean sighed, wiping a tear from his eye, chuckling one more time before sipping his whiskey again.  “Sam said she’s really nice.”
After a bit of research, Sam found out there were five members of Charming Acres police force.  Sheriff Donna Hanscum (who had moved to Charming Acres a whopping two months ago), Doug Kontos - a four-year veteran, two older cops, and a coroner.
Dean froze in his steps, turning to Cas with a baffled look.  “You know that’s not a good thing, right?”
Cas was in the same predicament.  Either way, they were going together.  Cas was truly his partner.  They’d dug in and figured this shit out.  And now...they were partners in crime.  He winked at Cas, getting the boyish grin that made him feel weak in his old, creaky knees.
“Too true,” Officer Kontos nodded, standing in front of them again.  “And while the little lady officer might have a soft spot for ya, I do not.  This won’t be a walk in the park, fellas.  No sir, not on my watch.”
“Sometimes.  When his tramp of a mother wants a break, she leaves him with me.  I’d just keep him.  I hate when she turns up and takes him away.” A sad look crossed is face.
Dean snorted a laugh, turning onto Lebanon Road.  Home.  The same lane they had followed Bobby down that night.  “Lebanon Road,” Dean declared, grinning wryly.  “Sure as hell beats Lily Dale Lane!”
Cas froze in place, Dean’s words gripping his chest and making him turn to look at his slumbering form on the couch.  He grinned and got under the covers he had put together on the inflatable bed several feet away from the couch.  He lay down, snuggling into the bed.  Dean Winchester was his.  Whether he knew yet or not. He was completely smitten with the man.  He had discerned his tells at poker.  And he now knew for absolute certainty that Dean was interested in him.  He all but had it in writing.  He snuggled a little deeper, excited for what tomorrow would bring.
“She is not a wolf yet,” Cas defended.  “She may never be.  And I would argue that we are a sanctuary.  The girl is 17 with no family.”
Naoki nodded slowly then her phone rang.  She lifted the phone to her ear with a shaky hello, then a tearful ‘okay’, before hanging up.  “That was Olivia.  She’s almost here.  She’ll take me but thank you.”
Cas, completely having forgotten why there was even a spoon in his own hand, grinned.  Dean was flushed and his chest was still heaving.  He had a light dusting of freckles that had popped out from being in the sun.  There were more on his shoulders.  His broad, muscular shoulders.  His hands gripped the t-shirt like they could handle gripping and lifting quite well.  Cas bet they were rough and would feel so fucking good dragging down his inner thigh.  He swallowed hard as his eyes jumped back up to meet Dean’s.
Dean slid into the booth at Harrington’s, waving at Sonny, who nodded back.  He had been to the diner several times now, hating how much he loved it.  The burgers were unremarkable, really, but the fries were good.  And the milkshake were obnoxiously fantastic.
Realizing he had just been lost in thought again, he dropped his right hand down to Cas’, taking his hand in his.  “Bench seats are awesome.”
Luc grinned, tipping back to let Castiel squeeze through the door.  Just as Castiel got next to him, Luc put an arm up, blocking his way.  “Haven’t seen you in a while.  Figured I scared you off.”
Gabe scratched his head, wishing Cas were here.  He was WAY smarter about this shit.  He turned to Marion.  “Do they ever give you tea here, Marion?”
“Hmm,” Rufus mocked, “I am hiding a dead body in my yard, but injustice is being done!  My Bat signal didn’t work, so...I’ll call the feds.”
“I was baking,” Cas grinned, kissing him on the cheek as he passed by him to sit a mug of coffee down for him.
Luc shrugged.  “What judge would take a kid from their mother and give them to a no-good Smitty like me?”
They went into Sam and Gabe’s house, finding Gabe hard at work in the kitchen making macaroni salad.  “Hello, Gabe.”
He wasn’t even quite in his hoodie when the doorbell rang.  “Cas!” He yelled.  “Can you get the door!”
Sam sat back a little, pressing his mouth together with his big forehead crinkled.  “Okay, so...you kinda know him.  You’ve known of him and met him a few times.  And you’ve been harboring a crush on him.”
“We have a lion too,” Dean nodded.  “That doesn’t mean we take in the next bear or rhinoceros that bumbles into town.”
This was true, making Cas chuckle.  Dean had an incredible accuracy for throwing darts.  The blindfold did not seem to hinder him at all.  This had been evidenced by his last dart, where he told Cas exactly what he was going to do to him and where, before he loosed the dart with pinpoint accuracy.
“Of course!”  Cas patted his shoulder, stopping in front of Marion’s room.  “You were invited by a resident.  Don’t forget, Sam, this is not a hospital.  This is their home.  Think of it as...a cruise ship that never leaves port.”
“Your dad wrecked his truck.  He hurt himself in the crash and won’t go to the hospital or to a doctor.  Dean didn’t want you or your mom to know because his custody would have been taken away.”
Gabe nodded.  “I’ll keep my ears open and eyes peeled.  I’ll let ya know if I see anything.  I knew those Smiths were shady.”
“That trap you set in your mind to smack yourself down when things get too...” Cas tipped his head back and forth in thought, “perfect.”
“I don’t think so,” Sam grinned, putting a hand on Gabe’s shoulder.  “Dean’s right.  Let’s go play some games.”
He stepped close to Castiel with a hungry look as his eyes ran down Castiel’s length.  “Figured I scared you off.”
“Fuck no,” Cas scoffed.  “If Sam comes, she’ll be nice as pie.  You need to see how she talks to me!”
There was a cool breeze off the ocean and clouds out to sea.  It would probably rain sometime today.  Dean had told the moms to call if they wanted to go anywhere, since they had to take the car to get to the boardwalk.
“I am,” Dean grinned proudly, getting an unimpressed smirk from Cas.  He shook her hand, the smell of pot roast filling the air and making his stomach growl in a happy way, for the first time today.
“Have a seat gentlemen, dinner will be ready soon!” She chimed, disappearing into what must be the kitchen door.
He settled into the bent-over position, arms stretched out wide and a joyful grin arching his brows as Sam slid finger after finger inside him to work him open wide.  Sam gripped one ass cheek, clenching and massaging it around in a circular motion as he slid three fingers inside him.  The grinding slide and circling ass cheek always got Gabe revved up like nothing else.
She did not look good.  Cas wondered why people insisted on saying they were good when they were not.  He watched as she sat at the table, looking around the room suspiciously.
Dean smirked as Doug walked him roughly through the door into the police station.  The officer at the desk inside the door watched curiously as Dean was paraded through a large room with four desks, down a hall and into another hall with two wide cells in it.
Cas grinned at the thought.  “That sounds perfect.  I could come listen to your music.  Or read comics for free.”
Dean’s serious face made Castiel worry.  But before he could pull away in defeat, Dean reached up, brushing a lock of hair back from his forehead.  Castiel leaned down, kissing him slowly.
They were all in eleventh grade this year.  Except Dean, Benny and Charlie, who were graduating in a few weeks.  Dean had a job already at his uncle’s garage and planned to stay to help his mom with the bills.  Charlie was starting college locally, and who knew what Benny would do.  Castiel hoped he would move.
He and his friends all seemed so much older.  Dean was seventeen.  It wasn’t the magical year that was the only difference.  There was just something cool about the guy.  He always had his own friends around.  Girlfriends.  He went to parties.  He drank.  He drove.  He fixed cars.  He was just...cooler.
Cas merely nodded, still staring at the end of the hall as Wayne, Chip, and Sheriff Hanscum disappeared around the corner.  He turned to Gabe with a serious stare.  “It’s Mahoney.  I think his incompetence killed Goldy.  It makes me wonder about the other residents who have died here.”
He went as silently as possible into the bedroom, wincing as the door clicked shut.  Cas didn’t move.  He must be sound asleep.
“Oh!” She came from the direction the dining room, heading for them.  “You must be the young man that drives that nice car!”
“I would never count you out of anything.  Even the stupid things,” Sam teased, snorting a laugh at his own joke before he was laying on the floor, his hair fanning out and eyes going shut.
“I’m...sure we’ll see you there,” Cas grinned politely, taking Dean’s hand as they left.  The door to the shop was barely closed before Dean was unleashing his true thoughts.
“Too soon?” Cas amended, rubbing the rough knuckles across his lips, trying to hide his disappointment.
They followed her into the small kitchen, Dean catching sight of movement outside her back door just before someone knocked on it.
“I was,” Dean frowned.  “The party was...weird.  Definitely a weird night.”  He had a funny look on his face.
They passed the Whittaker’s house with their eyes already set on their destination.  “These people are gonna make me hate Christmas,” Sam muttered as they walked up the narrow sidewalk that led to their porch, passing the decorations.
“Dean,” Cas said, again trying to be gentle while his libido roared for an animalistic release.  He couldn’t stop the magnetic pull, the power that drew them together.  He stepped closer, cupping Dean’s cheek in his hand and pulled him into a kiss.  Their lips fell apart as Dean gasped at his touch, his hands sliding greedily around his back to pull him in.  He grinned, open mouthed, luxuriating as Dean’s rough hands slid along his back.  “Dean,” he whispered, kissing his chin, cheek, jaw, anything he could reach, “may I make love to you?”  His lips ghosted along Dean’s jaw until he heard him utter a strangled ‘Yes’ in return.  The simple word was as powerful as a high voltage shock, jolting him into action.  He took Dean’s mouth by storm, like he wanted to.  Like he needed to.  They both moaned into a kiss that was amping up in passion until Castiel got a shock he should have been expecting.
He deliberated for several seconds on just what to do with Dean.  He had been waiting with excruciating patience for him to take them a step further.  Yet, nothing was happening.  But last night, when Dean had come in from the chilly night, he had so willingly let him hold him in bed.  He wanted, it seemed, whatever he offered him, but was unable to initiate.  He’d never been with someone quite like Dean.  It was puzzling to know him as the mouthy deckhand his brother told fantastic stories about.  It was another to navigate him truly.  And he so badly wanted to navigate him.
Instead, he sat back, listening to them sing.  When that didn’t work, he went inside to take a shower and went to bed.
“That’s good,” Gabe nodded, waiting until Sam closed his closet door and looked at him.  “So...Rainbow Bright’s fugly uncle is downstairs.”
He went upstairs to use the bathroom, hearing a TV on in Dean’s room.  In a strange wave of bravery, he tapped on the door, pushing it open.
Cas released the skin he had been gently devouring and stared right into Dean’s startled eyes.  “You get whatever you want.  Do you know why?”
Castiel wrapped both hands around Dean’s one hand.  Dean had told him he could touch him.  He started sliding his hand up to Dean’s wrist, then forearm, not going above his elbow.
The second room had a twin bed with a pink bedspread, fluffy pink curtains, a make-up table, and a chair.
“Save this file,” Sam said.  “I think you’re right, Gabe.  Something’s really strange about coming to work just to hand someone a teabag.”
He’d never had so much fun in his life.  Cas would tell him a story about Africa, and he’d share about the night The Mark damn near went down in a hurricane.  Cas told him enough about Japan that he was sure he wanted to visit.  Cas said he wanted to see Alaska, but Dean was fine with never getting back up there, though there were plenty of places in Canada he wanted to visit with him.
“Well -” his phone vibrated in his pocket, cutting off all other thoughts.  He grabbed it, expecting it to be Cas.
“Sweet!”  Dean made a beeline for Sam.  “C’mon!  Don just drove up the street!  We can catch him at home if we move quick!”
Cas chuckled.  “I would agree with that.  My grandmother would have approved.  Which is saying a lot, actually.”
The next day, he went to school.  He walked with Gabe and Sam, who stayed side by side, saying little to him.  He knew Kevin and Chuck had been filled in on what had happened.  His lonely day continued with detention over lunch for not having homework done.
Gabriel rolled his eyes, walking away.  Sam sat down.  “You okay, Cas?  Dean wouldn’t even talk to me last night.  He wouldn’t say anything about where you were.”
Castiel followed Dean to the grill.  The three men standing there clammed up immediately at their arrival.
“Nah, I knew you were coming home soon.  So...” His face flushed immediately and his eyes danced away to anywhere other than Dean.
When they had met at Sam’s graduation, Dean was insanely adorable, bragging and so evidently proud of his brother.  At the time, Cas was traveling a lot and though he found Dean incredibly attractive, he had no intention of hooking up with someone who might someday be family.
Sam shut his laptop with a sigh, rubbing his eyes when Dean and Cas walked in with a late lunch that day.
Sam pulled his phone out.  “Saw this really funny vine the other day.”  He scrolled, showing Cas a clip of a girl.  He grinned at the video.  Sam scrolled to another one.  They passed the time easily and Castiel knew he just needed to talk to his friends.  Why was this so damn hard?
Dean flinched hard when the door opened.  Luckily they were both on their backs and covered by the blanket.  “You boys awake?” Mary asked.
People were out walking along Prosperity Road, shopping, pushing baby strollers, and walking dogs.  All of them had that oddly bright look about them, waving and nodding as they passed by, heading across the street toward the huge strawberry milkshake in front of Harrington’s.
“There’s a tea kettle,” Sam whispered, pointing to a red present sitting on the burner of the stove.  When he looked closer, the red present had a spout and a handle.
“Bout time!” Gabe said, pushing his way through the little crowd.  “Heard you wiped out a whole town!”
“My favorite new game,” he muttered, plying Dean with a kiss before pulling his shirt off.  Dean let his shirt be pulled off easily enough, dropping the bear to the floor.
“Yeah, we got well water.  Pissed them right off when we didn’t join into the city system too.  I make it a point to not pay Don Stark or Chip Harrington a cent more than I have to.  There ain’t a damn thing wrong with our water.”
“Rough day?” Sonny asked, arriving at the table with her head cocking to the side enough to make her ponytail swing.
Chuck’s dad was a writer.  But for the most part, he just drank and collected disability for debilitating migraines.  They never went to Chuck’s house.  His dad seemed nice, but you always had to be extremely quiet.  It was like walking on eggshells just to be there.
Cas ran his fingers through Dean’s hair slowly.  “Goodnight,” he whispered back.  He hugged Dean to him, kissing the top of his head.
Rufus squinted upward into the trees as if the scent on the air might make him change his mind one way or the other.
“What’s his deal?” Sam asked, his frustration written all over his face.  “He’s in business with everybody.  And what he doesn’t own, the Starks do.”
“I didn’t know shit.  But I knew I loved him.  I knew that without a doubt.  Marriage isn’t dating, Sam.  It is...SO different.  Sam, it’s better.  It’s...everything.  That’s your partner.  Your person.  And yeah, I have you.  I have Charlie.  I have Bobby.  But none of you are Cas.  The constant wonder and looking and worrying is just over.  That person is yours.  And someday, Cas and I will have kids.  Because he is the person I want with me to have a family.  Not because he’s perfect.  Because he’s not.  And neither am I.  I didn’t lose anything when I got married.  I GOT everything.”
Castiel nodded.  He could not imagine his mother’s reaction if a baby were in the house though.  She would flip out and lecture him on his choice of friends.
Jody nodded slowly.  “Your sister was killing people.  She had already turned two people into wolves.  Brandy, there was no avoiding what I did.”
“Anyway,” Sam went on, “Mahoney keeps getting deposits from that pawn shop up the road.  AND the Smiths are getting deposits too.”
It took three full days of summer break to go by before Castiel worked up the nerve to go back to Sam and Dean’s house.
He was proud of himself for telling Dean there would be no more kissing.  He had drawn a limit.  And Dean had accepted it readily.
Warning bells were tolling in the back of his mind.  But to hell with those.  Nothing was louder than his heart racing at the thought of Dean’s warm skin under his hands.  Memories of the night they spent on a mattress luring him forward.
“You broke into an office!” Sam argued back.  “And so did you!” He pointed at Cas.  “And we’re planning on breaking into our neighbor’s house this weekend!”
Cas grinned.  He loved Krissy.  She was feisty and sweet.  He looked up at Dean, who was standing in the doorway listening.
Cas had been talking about how diligent they had to be, along with the help from the teachers at the high school, to be sure no students were sneaking off into the house to find a bedroom, closet, or corner to have sex in.
“It has a lock.  Two locks,” Dean pointed.  The knob had a key and large gold padlock was bolted above it.
Lightening flashed and the lights flickered.  They both looked up, waiting as the lights steadied and thunder rumbled louder.  “I could do it,” Cas grinned.  “But I can’t say we would have enjoyed it as much.”
“And Kevin and Chuck are outside,” Gabe added.  “Is your piece of shit dad here?”  Gabe turned from the room, heading for John’s room.  “Where’d he go?” Gabe yelled.
Dean’s eyes searched his face.  “Because!  I’m not...I didn’t think I was really into guys.  I really didn’t.  But...”
Cas glared at him, gripping the headboard tight with his hands.  Dean’s eyes flared with lust.  “I felt that.”  He added a fourth finger, ramming a little harder.
Castiel enjoyed his new position of power.  He let go of Dean’s dick, turning him by his hand to face the door.  Dean went easily, letting Castiel put his hand on the door.
The Starks still crowned the end of the road in their sprawling, beautiful home, still married and still filthy rich.  Maggie still complained about Don to her bestie, Sue, but the pair were happy and in love.  For the moment.  The fall of Chip’s empire had not been gobbled up by the Starks, however, letting others in town start businesses of their own, sharing the wealth.
“And Kat has ghosts,” Dean added, staring at the nearby houses suspiciously.  “No offense, Bobby, but this town gets weirder every day.”
“Yeah, I’m cold,” he tried chuckling, but it came out more as a hitch in his breath as Cas suddenly enveloped him from behind and seemed to surround him with warmth.  His arm wrapped around him, rubbing heat into his side, arm, and chest until Dean caught his hand and kissed it.  Oh God, this was so good.  So, so good.  They were touching.  They were cuddling.
Cas stepped out of the hug, grinning bashfully at the porch floor.  “Thank you, Sam.  I’m just feeling like...it’s time to be home.  And...” he glanced over his shoulder at the neighborhood, fully dark now, “I suppose this town is as good as any.”
In the middle of his meal, he found out how wrong he was.  He was on his second rib, fingers covered in sauce and mouth full when he felt Dean nudge his foot.  He glanced at him, the pair holding a quick gaze.  Castiel had nowhere to move or go as he felt Dean’s socked foot slide up his inner calf, up his thigh, and nestle right into his crotch.
“You have a dirty mouth,” Dean chuckled, making Cas smile at the rumble beneath his ear and the truth that, yes, he could have a dirty mouth.
Saturday morning broke bright and early.  The Talley wedding guests were gone, their rooms being cleaned.  Cas crossed the foyer, having checked the delivery to the kitchens from the local butcher.  Gabe came running through the front door.
Dean wondered what those hands might feel like.  He’d shaken his hand before.  He could recall the warm, firm grasp from the wedding weekend.  His eyes drifted up from Cas’ hand, finding him staring right back at him with a quirking grin.
“Nah,” Gabe laughed it off, heading back to the stairs.  “Hey, I gotta go check on Loki.  I’ll be at Bobby’s if ya need me.”  He gave Dean a quick wave, disappearing down the stairs.
Sam was talking about him?  To Cas?  Had Cas asked about him?  “Yeah.  If I don’t pull out now, I’ll end up like one of those old-ass salty dogs.  Or at the bottom of the Bering Sea.  Figured I better get out now.”  Shit.  Did he just make himself sound old?  Like...washed up?  Dammit!
“I bet they do.”  Outside, Dean took Cas’ hand and the pair walked next door, finding Sam, Gabe, Fletcher, Maddie, and Bobby sitting on the front porch.
Cas put a leg on the bed and Dean pulled him back into his chest.  “Uh-uh.  No bed for you.  I’m claiming this ass.”  Dean slid his hands down Cas’ hips to squeeze his ass cheeks.
Bobby rolled his eyes.  “That’s Frank.  He wanted to meet the guys he’d slipped info to.”  Sam started to turn to look at him to tell him to come over, but Bobby spoke up quickly.  “He don’t like ta meet folks face ta face.  This is as close as you’ll ever see him.”

“So, we have some plans,” Jody announced.  “Brandy is moving out to Garth’s house in town.  And Bess.  Brandy wants to get to know her dad more.  Garth offered.  And Bess will be staying to help her learn about being a wolf.  When she turns, her and Bess will move back to Indiana with the pack.”
