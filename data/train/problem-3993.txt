“I have just been informed, that the debate over the question ‘is it right or wrong to have immortal souls’ has been finally brought to a conclusion.”
“I know. What you did was very brave, and also a terrible shame. Your death was another loss caused by Chuck’s selfishness. It shouldn’t have been this way.”
The morning sun was shining brightly, but the sky was grey and the clouds aching. There would be torrents of rain. Huge swaths of rain, and it would begin within the hour. It reminded Castiel of the clouds before the flood. But God had promised no more floods like that one, and no flood would be coming to end the creature standing in front of Castiel. That was Castiel’s job.
Dean sat up straighter and gave a genuine smile, all traces of discomfort in the chair had evaporated.
Starting in two days. Alive again in weeks.
Donna is dead. She’s dead and she won’t let it go. She knows the people around her are memories of friends and loved ones, but it drives her nuts that they don’t know. She knows there is no point in arguing, she knows there is no way to convince a shadow to be a person, but she just can’t let it go.
Dean uses his thumb and pinky to make a ‘drinking’ motion. Garth looks at him levelly and sighs, holding the mug in his lap.
“And what about you and Sam? Any time for love amid the crisis?” Cesar asked, using a stick to poke a smoldering log back toward the flames.
“Jack, you know I would love to help”
It’s then that she notices the young man standing on her stairs. He’s looking at her with a great intensity that makes her feel seen straight through.
“Who are you.”
Donna is struggling to keep her neutral cop face on. Hope and joy are bubbling up and she’s having difficulty keeping it all contained. But she’s dealt with the supernatural before, she knows not to let her hopes get away from her.
“Brother you come to kill me. I am sad to end because I must destroy the world. The world must be destroyed. I am the first and voice and the echo of destruction. You will remember me for many millennia, and when the time comes you will know when we must end. My art shall be remembered. My voice shall be forgotten. But the amber in my eyes is timeless!”
“But I need Castiel. He knows more about Heaven, and being an Angel, and loving humanity than anybody. I need someone to guide me, and to keep me grounded. I get so lost in the big picture sometimes. I need someone who can stay connected to Heaven and to earth.  And I can’t reach him without you. I love him, I do, but I just get so confused by the tangle of feelings everywhere. I don’t know if it’s the God thing, or if it’s because the way I love him is different than the way you love each other, but I can’t find him in the big black void of The Empty.
Jack looks at his hands, then at Dean. Dean swirls with grief and sadness, loss and hopelessness. It reaches out around him and brushes their names carved into the table. It reaches into the chairs around them, into the sole lamp sitting on the table. It reaches down the hall toward Sammy, and away from them toward the kitchen. It roams it’s way toward Dean’s room. Jack can also see Dean’s love for Jack too. Jack would never have to wonder how the Winchesters really feel about him again, because he can see it physically.
The plan worked and Castiel was spared death by Goliath’s hands. Castiel had no opinion on the cunning or creativity it had taken to conceive of this plan.
Dean shrugged. “Once I thought I felt a cold spot, and the lights flickered a little, but everything seemed cool, and I didn’t see anything to make me think the guy was in real trouble, so I let it pass. I don’t want to look for problems where I don’t need to find them.”
“Oh, yeah, that.”
Dean beamed at Sam as Sam entered the room and sat across from the pair. Sam set a tape recorder in front of himself to continue his illusion of being a lawyer. Cas sat with the same calm, relaxed manner he generally had since becoming human. Sam thought he detected a bit of amusement behind the serenity. This wasn’t the affect he'd been expecting from either of them following an arrest. He cleared his throat.
“Do you think he’s going to cheat on you? Are you unhappy? Do you regret declaring your love? Do you think he regrets it?”
Garth sat and stared at Dean, a mischievous grin fully on his face. Dean glared at him.
“This ‘something real’ got a name?”
“Tell me about the cars you restore. What are they like?”
“My name is Jack. I’m taking over the job Chuck had, but I’m trying to do it better. More love, more understanding for his creations. The way my Dads taught me. I’m trying to undo some of his damage. It’s hard to know where to start and stop though. It’s hard to know when it’s been too long to save someone. I wish I could bring them all back.”
The second time Castiel met a Nephilim the man was angry, hateful. He tortured humans for fun and killed (or attempted to kill) any Angel on sight. He was destruction personified. Castiel was prepared to fight the creature and die, as all Angels are prepared to die to follow an order from God, when a better opportunity presented itself. A human named David was going to take on the nephilim himself. Castiel presented the poor human with a rock. A small, unassuming rock, but a rock blessed from Heaven itself, with Angelic runes carved on all sides. A rock decorated especially for this purpose.
“I’m not talking out of my rear here Dean. I’ve been there. And you can call me any time, as a friend, or for an appointment. I know it’s hard. But you will find a way. When things are at their toughest you always find a way. Especially where Cas is involved.  Now, if you could do me a big favor and pop into the kitchen on your way out and grab you a loaf of zucchini bread. I thought I would like gardening, but I don’t know what I thought I was going to do with the Zucchinis once I grew em. Obviously no one in my house was going to be eating zucchini. We’ve got a real glut right now and I am running out of people to give em to. I’d consider it a real personal favor.”
“I found an exsanguinated corpse with holes in its neck resembling bite marks made with fangs.”
Jody stands, unsure. She knows herself well enough to know she is a sucker for a parentless child, but she isn’t sure Jack is looking to be comforted. Before she can decide what to say Jack straightens up and smiles at her.
“Can we focus on getting to the point? Cas, what did you find at the coroner's office?”
“I know you would, but it takes both of us. I can’t see into The Empty. It’s closed to me. Once I know where he is we can go there and wake him up. But I need you to lead me to him.”
Dean let out a breath he hadn’t been thinking about holding.
Never gonna say goodbye
Dean stared out the window at the sunny backyard for a minute.
“How the fuck would I know that? You’re the one with the degree. I’ve never known why the fuck I do what I do. I’m no good at this feelings crap. Hand me a shotgun and point me at a ghost and I’ve got your back, hand me a wrench and point me at an engine and I’ll set her right in no time, but I’ve never gone in for all this touchy feely stuff.”
“Ok. Why don’t you two tell me what happened here”
“Are you happy in Heaven, Jody?”
Rowena is dead, but it’s a temporary condition. For the first time since dying Rowena has hope.
“Yeah that. So we pulled over, turned off the headlights, and spent a while laying on the hood of Baby just watching the falling stars.”
“I am Eilie, and I am here to kill the world.”
She turns to bring the plate to the table and almost drops it. Jack is sitting at the table across from her husband watching her carefully. He flashes his cheerful smile and waves his awkward wave.
“You know damn well there have been”.
“You see, I want to try to undo the damage. I want to make this a better place, and give people a chance to be better people. I feel like erasing their memories wouldn’t be a good start to that. But I also can’t really sit down with everyone and have these meetings individually. It’s not practical with all the work I need to do. But I want them to understand. I want them to know that I’m going to try to make it better, that the Heaven they return to the next time will be different. I need you to explain it to them. When we get back will you tell them what I showed you? Will you tell them that I’m trying?”
It sounded like a hell of a weird story and both men hoped they’d get to it at some point.
Dean sipped his drink and considered for a minute.
“Huh, that’s a pretty smart plan. I wonder why they got sloppy.”
“No, I don’t think he’s going to cheat on me. No, I’m not unhappy. I told you, I’m very happy. No I don’t regret declaring my love. I don’t think he regrets declaring his love either, but it did get him ripped away to the empty for a while, and he did think he was going to be gone forever, so if he did regret it I wouldn’t exactly hold it against him. But no. I don’t worry about our relationship. I know we’re both in it for the long haul.”
It was obvious Garth was not convinced. Dean threw his hands up and sighed.
Never gonna let you down
“That instinct has kept you alive. It has served you well for your entire life, and I, for one, am grateful for that. I am so glad that those instincts were there for you when you needed them, and that they could hold you together when some nasty thing was trying to tear you apart. That state has saved your life many many times.
Dean was quiet for a moment, Garth waited and sipped his tea.
“I guess… It just didn’t occur to me? God that does sound weird to say out loud.”
“I have a couple of other things I need to clear up first. In two days I’ll come back and we’ll start talking about my plans. It might be a while before the transition is fully complete, but I hope it will be weeks and not years. I can’t make any promises though. I’ve never done this before.”
“Oh my God, my heart is beating!”
“And they seem to take their indecency laws very seriously. So I reckon it’s time to head out of here and mosey on home.”
“It’s good. I like it. I think it’s good to have the chance to get out and do normal things. I fix cars, I show teenagers how to change a timing belt. Sometimes I go with Emmett to look at potential cars. I get to see a lot of countryside, meet a lot of people, and not think about salt, or shotguns, or vampires or ghosts. It gives me a chance to meet normal people in normal ways. Live like the other side lives a little.”
The weight of the realization pushes her to the ground and she sobs uncontrollably. Her son stops riding, and rushes to comfort her. The look on his face, the concern and love, breaks her heart. She has ruined this beautiful moment of pride for him. Except that she hasn’t. He isn’t really here, and he isn’t really real. He was disappeared by a violent, petulant God who destroyed her family and cast her here.
Seeing Jody is the hardest. Donna argues and argues with her dearest friend. She challenges her and fights with her. The benign kindness with which Jody deflects the legitimate points Donna makes causes Donna the only real distress she feels in this place. She finds herself avoiding the corners of Heaven in which she finds Jody because it’s painful to be so lovingly dismissed by the person in the world she trusted the most.
“You know, I’ve faced the end of the world with only Sammy for comfort so many times I kind of got used to assuming that when my time came I wouldn’t mind dying without a partner. But now that the time is creeping up… You know, I think I’ll be sad to not have a real love at my side. I came close a few times. I just… I guess none of it was meant to stick. You know?”
Castiel followed the sound of music and the smell of smoke to the kitchen where he found Sam standing over the sink watching a fully ablaze map burn away to nothing. Castiel stood beside him and together they watched until the last wisp of smoke drifted away.
“Sometimes I’ll think… ‘that was girly’ about something some other man does, and then I’ll stop and ask myself, ‘why do I care?’ And I don’t. You know, I don’t. It wasn’t me who believed those things. I just got told them so hard, and so many times, I assumed they were real. I thought they were… beyond questioning. But they aren’t mine. They never were. I spent so much of my life not thinking certain things, not looking at certain people. So many missed opportunities because of some other man’s ideas about what men do. Now that the world is ending again, It feels like a waste. You know?”
Two notable exceptions to this might be people who never moved beyond their parents music and people who never got the chance to develop the oldies callouses.
Sam allowed himself to be escorted by a Pecos Texas police officer down a nondescript cinder block hallway to a small cramped room. Generally speaking Sam found most small time jails had roughly the same run down bland aesthetic. In the room was a table. On the other side of the table Dean and Cas were already seated, handcuffed and in the one piece jumpers of those under arrest. There was a large mirror (presumably a one way mirror) along the side of the wall. Sam glanced around and added the details of the room to the mental picture he was building of this drab small city jail. He wasn’t sure what was going on yet, but Dean had made his one phone call to Sam under the pretense that Sam was his lawyer, and told him they’d been arrested. Sam was pretty sure he would be breaking these two out of their incarceration later that night. Sam would bet they were being recorded.
"Cas - if you haven't gone back, then where have you been all this time?"
"Where? You can't hide from Death, Dean. But of course I'll go with you - anywhere you want, wherever you say."
"It was me, wasn't it?"
"It's always been just you, Cas."
The woman passes first - leaving Dean alone again. But her death is peaceful, their farewells good enough. Her funeral is a small affair, attended by everyone who ever loved her, loved the two of them together.
"I wish I could do it all over again. Do it right. Then maybe, maybe at least I could have told you goodbye."
Dean is alone, and not for the first time in his life. He's alone in the Impala, having dropped Sammy off for the last time at the threshold to the latter's new life, and for weeks, months, and then years, he just wanders.
"Yeah, Cas - after all, you're mine to have, aren't you?"
And one night, when the woman asks to whom Dean prays to every night, even though there's no God, Dean just simply says, Cas.
And they don't say a word.
But Sam dies, and Dean is at his side, holding his hand, while Eileen and their children stand on his other side, looking on as Sammy goes with a smile, telling Dean that soon they'll see each other again, for no way would they ever be apart for that long.
But eventually his time comes, as he anticipated long ago - having arrived much later than he expected, but having arrived all the same.
If not for the gravelly voice that speaks monotonously, slowly.
Dean just looked at Cas, as the other continued to speak in a matter of fact manner, his words flowing steadily.
Dean paused, his voice cracking.
And then he gets angry. Angrier maybe than he had ever felt before, in his whole life.
A little at a time.
And for a long moment, as the two of them stood there locked in the same space, in the same moment, he could feel the dam breaking as all his thoughts, everything he couldn't voice before, threatened to stumble out clumsily without restraint into the air after so long, coming out as easily as each consequent breath.
That this was the way it was going to be.
And never had he thought it would be like this.
Because he's old - older than he ever thought he would get.
His smile grew slowly, watching Dean gently all the while.
Dean stilled, his body freezing in place as the words hung suspended in the space between them with nowhere to go but into his thoughts, where his mind struggled stupidly to comprehend them.
The other sighed, turning to glancing at Dean meaningfully, his expression having changed to become something more resigned, his eyes flitting as if searching the other's expression, before relaxing into something gentle.
He began to laugh, his hands sliding down the other's arms towards the thin wrists that were limp in his grasp, pulling them together, closer.
And for a moment, he just closes his eyes, breathing out deeply.
"I've thought about it a lot, since the last time we spoke. It's funny - I've been alive for millennia, I've already seen all that exists to be seen, know everything that exists to be known."
And as the other slowly brightened, the slumped figure straightening as Cas let himself fall forwards willingly, easily, he watched the expression transition quickly from dejection to hope to a feeling Dean didn't want to put a name to - not yet - and he continued, his voice dropping to a volume only the two of them could hear.
"Dean - "
Then goes Sam. It's ironic, because Dean always, always thought it wouldn't be Sam - that it would be him who would go first, that it was always meant to be him who would go first.
But then as night falls, just as he thinks he's falling asleep, does he hear a sudden whoosh to his side - a sound so familiar, yet belonging to a time so long ago that he almost mistakes it for the wind, if not for the soft, persistent rustling of fabric.
"But this time, we'll do it together."
"So Cas, let's go."
Pulling Cas inwards, he pressed in closer, never taking his eyes off the other's face. Grinning cheekily, it was almost as if he was young again - back in his thirties, when the world was still a great unknown that was waiting for him to begin.
The world is saved, Jack disappears into thin air, leaving just Dean and Sam behind.
"But after you spoke to me for years, let me back into your life even for just a few minutes at a time, I couldn't stop myself. I came back down to see you. To watch you live the life you were always meant to live, even if it was in a place I wasn't familiar with, even if with someone that was not me."
"Cas."
The angel moved then for the first time in a while, his body inching slightly away as he began to shake gently like a leaf that would crumble at the first touch, his limbs trembling as he raised his hands to his face, his voice breaking for the first time.
And when he wakes up, it's on his mind for the rest of the day, and still some days afterwards.
Dean straightens up too quickly, his limbs slipping wildly as he almost trips over himself to turn to the figure that's suddenly appeared beside him. And he almost can't believe it, almost thinks it a final dream, granted to him in his last moments.
His eyes turning back to the angel beside him, for a moment his mind halted again, where he felt his breath catch in his throat, growing shallow, felt his heart slow to a stop before it began again, rattling like a nearby, passing train in his chest.
"Cas, it's not your fault. You did nothing wrong. It was me, all me. I should have said something back there, I shouldn't have just let you go like that. And even afterwards - after it was all said and done I should have tried reaching out to you sooner. But - "
Just Cas.
He doesn't know what to say.
And where he seemed almost content to stay there for a while in the silence, Dean swallowed hard, his gaze dropping briefly to the ground as he pressed his lips tightly together, squeezing his eyes shut - for once more he was a coward, unsure of the right words to say, of what it would mean if only he tried to say them out loud. But after a moment did he also look up, his face troubled, his heart heavy, staring far off into the horizons where darkness had long overtaken the land.
And so Dean is by himself once more, and he feels numb.
He takes Baby out for one last drive.
"Cas -"
Squeezing his eyes shut, he just stares for a while in disbelief.
Because the moment's arrived when he'll finally get that chance he's dreamt of for so long - and yet even after all this time he still doesn't know.
Throughout his days, sometimes he meets the people he once saved, sometimes other hunters who similarly gave up the old ways for peace.
But Cas just looked at him - his gaze quiet, sad.
Cas frowned, his brows furrowing as his expression became troubled, distant.
Cas stared at him quietly, listening intently, as he forged on, his words rough but determined.
But most of the time he's still alone.
"Here, Dean. Just here."
"I'm so sorry, Dean. I never wanted to leave you like that. But everything was happening so fast, and I wasn't sure whether I could just come back, how I could come back like nothing had happened, like everything was okay. And now it's too late and too much time has passed - so much time gone just like that, in the blink of an eye - and I -"
"And as I watched everyone go before me - Sammy, everyone I ever loved - I wondered what I had done for the world to hate me so much."
And so do the years fly by.
"I heard you - all those times you prayed to me. I've always listened, I never stopped. And at the beginning I felt ashamed - I didn't think I deserved to see you again, after having been brought back from the Empty. So instead I spent all this time rebuilding heaven, making it a better place so you could go there when it was your time, and you'd feel at home when you did get there. Whenever that could be, however long I'd have to wait."
Sam moves on, as he always does - naturally, with an effortless nonchalance that ushers him quickly into a normal life without fanfare, settling easily into days at a time where he can just forget about the rest of the world. Live for himself, for a change.
"You were right, you know. I do have a lot of love to give - to Sam, to mom, to Jack, to so many others. To everyone who ever thought me worthy of theirs. But all my life, I never thought I deserved it. Always thought I would ruin it somehow, everything I ever had."
"It was waiting for me, that's all it was. It was giving me a chance. Because all my life I had wanted so badly to be free. But it was never that you were the thing tying me down - it was that you were the last thing I needed. The final piece in the puzzle that I needed to get there. To be truly free."
"Then we'll go as far as tomorrow takes us, wherever that may be, okay? And we'll see everyone again along the way. Sammy, mom, Jack - the whole crew."
He locks up the bar behind him, puts up a note on the door, chuckling softly as he tacks it up, before turning away and strolling towards the Impala, swinging his keys around his finger, letting them loop around and around.
"Hell, they make you the big guy yet? Or is Jack there with you now? Or what about Sammy - have you seen Sammy around?"
Tightening his arms, he rested his head on top of Cas' shoulder, breathing in deeply.
And Dean stared, unmoving, as Cas edged into the little space beside him, leaning back against the hood of the Impala and turning towards the horizons beneath them.
"No, Cas, you're wrong. That - "
"No, Dean, that's alright. I know that now, because of you. Because you've allowed me to stay by your side, all this time."
"More good than bad?" Castiel asked, staring at Dean's mouth.
"Yes, it is," Dean said, like it was the understatement of the century.
Dean looked off at nothing in the middle ground, a faint smile on his face. "Yeah. That's good. That's real good."
"Of course." Castiel stood up. "You're welcome to stay for dinner, if you like." He disappeared into the house, screen door banging behind him, and reappeared a moment later, handing Dean an ice cold beer that was far superior to the one he'd shared with Bobby. They clinked and some suds ran over Dean's fingers.
"Here?"
"Yeah, we're in the Good Place. I got the memo. I just... I don't want to face the rest of them yet."
"I'll take that beer now."
"The suffix 'iel' means that I am of God. When you began to call me Cas… you made me your own."
They talked about the little things. Castiel said the house was rundown when he'd found it, but he'd thought it was perfect: a project he could work on, something he could focus on for a while that wasn't life and death, that was just his.
Maybe he could teleport.
"Yeah. I mean, stay here. If that's okay."
"You threw my coffee in the dirt."
"You're welcome, Dean. You're always welcome here."
"Awesome," Dean said, and pulled him in for another kiss.
"You didn't just want to share?"
"I was thinking… maybe I could wait here with you."
Castiel spread his hands. "Then there's more for the rest of us."
love with you. I've loved you for years." A little of the certainty faded from his face and he looked away. "I just thought you would never--"
"Is it more fun just to figure things out as you go?"
"Was that a yes or no to staying for dinner?"
Dean grinned. "How does it work here? Do you still have to be an angel? Or is this your heaven, too?"
"Time moves differently here."
Dean looked up, amused. Castiel was staring at him, just like he'd always done, like Dean was fascinating, like he was worthy of all that endless attention.
, but bravely held his gaze. "I wasn't being that optimistic."
Suddenly the books and the record player and the memory foam all made a lot more sense.
"I was just driving." Dean looked over at the Impala and smiled. "Looks like all cars go to heaven."
Dean was pretty sure his entire upper body was blushing, which made no sense
He backed up and turned up the drive to the house: little more than a dirt track with grass and wildflowers growing between the ruts left by whatever else had driven up here over the years. He parked the car and just sat, listening to the pings of the engine as it cooled. Then he felt stupid because Castiel was watching him, so he took a deep breath and got out.
Castiel shrugged. "Sometimes I just want to be loud and destructive and make tin cans go boom."
Maybe he could fucking fly.
Castiel thought for a moment. "I'm sure that will be very cathartic for you."
"What brings you here, Dean?"
"Can I stay the night?" Dean took a large mouthful of beer to swallow past the lump in his throat as Castiel blinked in surprise.
Castiel stood up as Dean mounted the steps.
Castiel's smile started out slow, but ended up toothy and real. "It's really me."
Dean blinked. Castiel was lethal with a blade and a force of nature in hand-to-hand but his shooting had always lacked a little something. "Why do you need to shoot in heaven?"
"Huh. Is there a manual to this place?"
Dean sat at the end of the counter in the little red-tiled kitchen watching Castiel work. He was making the pasta from scratch, which was kind of mesmerising to watch, especially the kneading part, although maybe that was only because by this point Dean was halfway down his third beer.
When Castiel finally glanced up at the clock and suggested they turn in, Dean was surprised to see it was after midnight. Dean made a move to clear the table, but Castiel shook his head.
Dean had
Strong arms wrapped around him and Castiel hugged back.
He could do this forever. He had nothing but time until Sam got here. Maybe later he could catch up some more with Bobby, or find out who else was living up here now. Maybe there was a town or something where he'd know someone in every house, or maybe they'd all have their own towns and there was some heavenly shuttle service so he could go visit.
of it all.
Dean relaxed into his chair and tilted his face into the sun.
"It's been a long day. A nap sounds good." Cas gave a little nod. "Goodnight, then."
"Hello, Dean."
Dean nodded, tugging him in for another kiss. He wrapped his legs around Cas because fuck it, in for a penny, and pulled him in until they were flush against one another, warm skin and thin cotton and endless kisses, wet and open and amazing.
Dean looked out over the little garden, a vegetable patch and apple trees and a whole bunch of other stuff he couldn't hope to name, neat little rows but nothing too cutesy, fading into the treeline. He didn't know shit about gardening, but it was clear someone had put in a lot of work to maintain it.
Dean put some more space between them and looked up at the front of the house. "This is your place?"
Dean's face heated. He gave Castiel's shoulders a final squeeze and stepped back. "It's just… just a nickname. You got too many syllables."
"Works for me. I want to sail."
"I love you," Dean blurted out, and it was relief, it was joy, it was elation and fear and courage and peace all rolled into one. "I do, Cas. I love you. This is... Jesus. I should have manned up and told you a long time ago."
Castiel looked out at the car and smiled softly. "I would like to experience all the good things at some point. Were you driving anywhere in particular?"
"You can ask him yourself," Castiel said, sitting opposite. "He's busy, but he makes it a point to come for dinner once a week."
"I've also been practicing my shooting. You could teach me."
He came to a small crossroads, no signs in sight, and just sat for a moment, listening to the bassline rumble of the engine, wondering which way he should turn. He squinted against the low-lying sun and saw a little house through the trees.
"I worked with Jack for a while. We had a lot to put right. Then... he said I could stay here as long as I wanted. " He looked out over the trees, over his little garden, dappled in warm sunlight. "This is heaven for all of us. It's whatever we want it to be."
"Cas, I gotta ask… Is this really you? I mean,
"Oh yeah?"
Cas came up to the other side of the wooden railing that circled the house. He had a smudge of dirt on his forehead and a smile on his face. "You found the coffee." He stole the cup out of Dean's hand and took a swallow. He smiled up at Dean, squinting a little in the sun and licking coffee off his top lip.
Castiel's smile was blinding. He touched Dean's face with a shaking hand. "Okay. Okay, that's... Yes. I think you should stay here with me. You should live here with me."
"You just laid that on me and then you--" Dean shook his head. "That broke my heart, man."
"When I feel like it, I do."
"Ah. That."
Dean leaned down and in and kissed him.
Dean looked up into clear blue eyes. He was sure Castiel could see right through him.
"Cas--"
"Or you could stay awhile."
"I wasn't sure... I mean, Bobby said, but... It's really good to see you, Cas."
"Why?"
"I'll make you more."
Castiel quirked his lips and stared down at where Dean still had hold of his sleeve.
"Different here," he said. "Yeah."
"Dean?"
Dean's heart was hammering wildly in his chest. He nodded, breathless. "This is heaven, right? Stands to reason I'm getting exactly what I want to make me happy."
"I'd… I'd like that."
"I was thinking I'd try linguini."
Dean's hand darted out with little conscious thought and he grabbed hold of Castiel's sleeve.
Cas shrugged. "I do the parts I enjoy. I don't particularly like washing dishes."
"Yes, Dean?"
"Just yours. The most important car in pretty much the whole universe."
Dean spread his hands because hell, yeah, she was. "Maybe... you could take her for a spin later, y'know, if you like."
Dean woke up late, but not too late, the little clock telling him it was just after ten thirty. He rolled out of bed, pulled on yesterday's t-shirt and jeans, and found the bathroom so he could pee and splash some cold water on his face. He padded barefoot downstairs in search of coffee.
Castiel was petting him, Dean realised, his hands on Dean's waist, rubbing soothing circles with his thumbs. "You're not technically gardening if you're just watching me do all the work."
"We can learn it all together," Cas said, breathing hot into his mouth, his hair in mad disarray. "All the things we've never done, never thought we could have. We can do them all together."
He watched over Dean for a good while before the hunter began to twitch in his sleep. Stress and fear marred the formerly softened features of his face as a nightmare clenched its stranglehold. Castiel sat frozen for a few seconds as Dean began to writhe in agony attempting to escape his invisible captor. Upon further examination, Castiel realized that the pain of the nightmare was searing, deep seated, and controlling. Consuming every facet of Dean’s body, it was as if this terror was once again real. Gently shaking his beloved he tried to gently wake the poor man.
Visiting earth with Gabriel was always an adventure, a rule breaking adventure, one that much to Castiel’s chagrin he couldn’t resist making. Sometimes they would see great wars, or monuments, other times they would just watch the mundane. Today was a case of the latter. The two angels had gone to visit a small meadow with a pond. The meadow was full of beautiful flowers and gentle rolling hills much like those depicted in a fairy tail. It was mostly empty except for a woman and her daughter who were happily feeding ducks, an activity that greatly confused Castiel.
Timidly Castiel approached a family of ducks before offering a piece of bread to one of the smaller ones. Much to his surprise the ducks quacked happily before quickly swarming him for more bread. Excitedly Castiel began to feed all of the ducks for hours as it was now his duty to ensure that each and every duck was fed. Feeding the ducks would turn into a monthly tradition one that Castiel never missed, ever. Caring for his father’s creatures was a sacred duty after all that means missing a month would be neglecting his duties as an angel.
So I'm toying with the fine line of normal Dean and broken Dean. If it seems really oc or not realistic I'm sorry but it felt right. This chapter doesn't really need any warnings. Again I promise the porn err I mean love making is coming. I just want there to be a semi realistic transition to it. Please enjoy and leave feed back. Thanks for reading! :3
Waking with a jolt, Dean shot up battle-ready, only to immediately panic in confusion. The new surroundings were quite jarring. Blinking a few times, his memory came back to him slowly. The result was him immediately flying onto the floor. The change of positions happened so quickly that it left Castiel frozen in shock for the slightest of moments. Reaching down, Castiel scooped Dean up into his arms as if he were a babe, cradled him to his chest, and began gently rocking him, all the while whispering sweet nothings to him. After a few minutes of this, Dean broke away from the memories that were trying to overtake him. Castiel’s Grace allowed, or rather forced, himself, to witness what exactly Dean had experienced in his initial meeting with Alistair.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Fire and brimstone. The lava now coursed through his veins, filling every crevice of his body and consuming every nerve in its relentless flame. Unexpected. A fierce passion arose in his body, demanding more and attempting to devour him in its lustful wake. Using every bit of his resolve, Castiel managed to fight it off. There had not been enough time for the physical wounds to heal, but there may never be enough time for all of the damage to fully heal. At any rate, it needed to be Dean's decision to advance. He needed to be the one to lead this. It was the only way to avoid further damage. Sighing, Castiel contented himself with simply watching Dean as he slept. Fascinating was the way he seemed to de-age in his sleep. The hunter's hard lines softened, calming as sleep captured him. Somehow he managed to look peaceful in spite of all the recent events and changes that he had undergone. Dean was quite resilient for a human; for any being for that matter.
“Y-You won’t?” Dean asked, the hope in his eyes reflecting off of unshed tears.
Castiel and Dean sit down for a dinner of sorts.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
“It’s alright Dean. I forgive you. You took your punishment well and now it’s over. The slate is clean. Now why don’t you rest. It’s been a busy morning for you.” Castiel said as he pulled Dean back to his chest. It was unlikely that this would be the end of the struggle, but it was definitely a good start.
“Even when I’m bad?” Dean’s voice had become quite timid with this question.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Dean, he isn’t here. He can’t get you. Nothing will ever get you again.” The strange man rumbled, and for some reason Dean believed him. He believed everything this new man said. There was just something about him something you could trust. That thought terrified him. Shaken to the core, he bolted. Dean ran and ran down the long corridors of the hallway, through the twists and turns, until he finally made it outside. Dean ran. He stepped out on the the porch, and dropped to his knees because he just couldn’t run anymore. The adrenaline had faded and his body had caught up to him. Everything stopped in an instance. Still, the warmth of the sunlight washing over him for the first time in months was worth it. Even just a split second of peace was worth what ever punishment this new tormentor brought. Despite the fact that this was probably the last free moment he would have, he felt at peace. Looking at the blue sky seeing the green grass and feeling the cool wind wisp around him was enough. It reminded him of home. The home he had before his mother died. The home he dreamed of after every fight. The home that gave him hope through every beating Alistair gave him. Despite everything, he felt at home in this moment.
While Castiel certainly understood that Dean’s memory was hazy at best he still could not allow this sort of attitude if he was to help give Dean a sense of routine and security. Gripping Dean’s chin he forced him into an intense stare off. “I understand that you may not remember everything that has passed recently but you will under no circumstances speak to me like that again. I can assure you that you will not like the consequences.”
Growning, since Dean knew this was a trap Dean began to wrack his brain. Castiel was probably going to make up a thinly veiled excuse to say Dean was not thorough enough so that he could bathe Dean for a week. If Dean was being honest with himself he kind of wanted that, but he also didn’t want to feel like he had failed. This decision was proving harder than either anticipated. Sensing this Castiel decided it was best to intervene before Dean could spiral. “I’m sorry Dean. This was meant to be fun no matter what you pick you won't fail. I promise” Castiel soothed taking Dean into his arms.
Castiel’s brows furrowed looking down at his once calm pet, who now seemed to be determined to escape. What was going on in his mind, Castiel wondered. How could his little one go from perfectly blissful to panic. Well, mood swings were something at least. He could deal with this. It might take time but he would rebuild Dean.
The man chuckled “This was the family home before the fall. It brings back many fond memories. It was and is my home. My brothers and I come here when we want to escape the harsh reality that is the world. It takes us all back to when things were simple. Peaceful. When I look at the landscape I am reminded that there is still hope for humans despite the depravity of man. Places like this still exist. What my father created still has some beauty in it. That’s what I saw when I looked at your soul, Dean. It was so bright and pure despite the darkness that tried to encroach on it. Even though it was surrounded by fear and pain it managed to fight. You managed to fight. I know it may not feel like it, but you won Dean. He didn’t win, and he won’t ever win.”
The words that should have been soothing only seemed to frighten Dean more. What was this thing? How could it see his soul? More importantly, what did it want with Dean? The man’s brows knit together in frustration and he strode over to Dean. “This is it he is going to kill me.” Dean thought snapping his eyes closed and clenching his fists in preparation for the pain that would inevitably follow. But it never came. Instead gentle hands carded through his hair, soothing away the fear. To his dismay he leaned into what was probably a trap. It was a nice trap. Calm and settling. There was a strength in this man’s hand unlike anything he had ever felt. Power beyond that of even Alistair. While it did frighten him it also made him feel incredibly safe. A blanket of warm seemed to settle around them as he slowly came down from the shakes that seemed to rock his body. When had that started? He remembered shaking slightly but not full body tremors that seem to go bone deep. To his dismay he seemed to have lost all of the strength he had. Quivering at the sight of any man that he met. How had he fallen so far? Become so pathetic. Pathetic. That was one of Alistairs favorite things to call him and it seemed to have come true. He was nothing. A shell of a man only good for entertaining his master. “Dean” the man warned in a deep rumble causing him to squirm under his touch. His tone was so different that Alistairs. It didn’t mock or harbor malice. No it was far more caring than that. For some reason he found himself wanting to please this man, unlike when Alistair gave him warning and he obeyed out fear. No there was a deep seeded want to please that seemed to overtake his body. But why?
“I believe humans call it marriage. When I rescued you from Alistair I was forced to mate with you by infusing my grace with your soul. It was quite damaged and there was no other way to heal your injuries. I know it’s a lot to take in and I took something from you that you will not ever be able to get back. It may not seem fair and you may have even wanted to die but in the few minutes I knew you, I knew I had to save you. Your soul was just so bright and pure inspite of everything. I couldn’t let it die. Even if I would never be able to mate and the chance that you might not ever love me I had to save you. I know it’s probably too much to ask but if you are willing I would like to get to know you. To give you the opportunity to decide if you want to be my mate or not.”
Chuckling Castiel responded “Yes, but it needs to finish cooling off so why don’t you go ahead and clean up first.” To the untrained ear Castiel’s request might sound like a question, however there is an undertone of dominance that makes it clear that it is not a request, but rather it is an order one which is expected to be obeyed.
Providing an array of choices was something Castiel put a great deal of stock into which is why Castiel had 2 of nearly everything in the house be it soap or food so that there were many opportunities for Dean to begin making decisions and each time the hunter made one Castiel made sure to offer small reassuring touches. The times when Dean could not decide Castiel would simply pick for him offering calm reassurances that it was okay and that making decisions was hard for everyone. There were times when people needed help making decisions and it was perfectly fine if Dean needed Castiel to help with those decisions. Of course Castiel secretly, or not so secretly, enjoyed making decisions for others. Making those decisions made Castiel feel more in control of the situation providing immense relief, while for Dean not having to make those decisions provided a different form of relief in the freedom from choice. With how difficult making decisions had become for Dean, Castiel was deeply proud every-time Dean managed to make his own decision even if it was a small one, because it showed more signs of healing.
Castiel blinked a few times. He hadn’t expected that so soon. Nevertheless he responded “Of course Dean,” and placed a chaste kiss to Dean’s lips. He reveled in the way such a small action caused Dean to melt in his arms, cuddling close.
“Never,” Castiel said firmly and began rubbing Dean’s back.
However, for Dean, time marches on, the ebb and flow of each day passing in rhythm melds together blurring the lines between each passing day. How long would it be until this new reality felt tangible? What would it take to move beyond a fevered dream into the corporeal? Everyday Dean expected to wake up back in hell to hear the sickening sound of Alister's voice. When would this nightmare finally end? What would it take to shatter the shackles weighing him down? Currently time is serving as the both the chain and the liberator for Dean. Each day seeming to never end with no sign of escape from the torment of his mind, but there is also hope in tomorrow. Perhaps a new day will offer a new perspective.
The last time he could remember a warmth even remotely similar to the one offered by the angel his Mother had been alive. Given how young he had been since Mary was alive he was quite touch starved for affection. One-night stands and quick flings never offered this sort of feeling and were typically just quick nights of passion with little regard for the emotions of the other only providing meaningless sexual release. Prior to having this sort of intimacy Dean would have fiercely argued that it was for pansies, that he did not need it, and would only ever do it for a beautiful woman. However, after experiencing he was not sure if he could live without it, but you’d never hear him admit that. With sleep overtaking him Dean was comforted by the presence of the angel once again providing sanctuary for him to sleep.
What did I agree to? How could I agree to being someone else's pet? Is that all it takes now are some piercing blue eyes? Shaking his head. Well in for a penny in for a pound at the very least perhaps the blue eyed man would feed him. So with that in mind he used his resolve to open the door and follow the smell. It turned out to be quite a journey to find the kitchen. Perhaps his sense of smell was deteriorating or maybe this house was just far to big. Either way after struggling through the long twisting hallways he finally managed to find the kitchen. It was larger than he had been expecting with and island gorgeous granite counters, a stove far larger than any one person could need. It was like something you would see in a catalog everything in immaculate condition. Well everything except the blue eyed man his sex hair seeming to point in every direction. It seemed that he always had that disheveled look to him but somehow he still managed to appear in complete control. Every movement he made was deliberate and calculated like watching someone paint only with food instead of paint.Remembering himself Dean gracefully went to his knees placing his arms behind his back and bowing his head in submissions. He remembered what Alistair had taught him. Pets were to be seen and not heard.
They stayed together like that for a long time. Just being together and comforting each other. The progress that this showed was far greater than expected. Castiel could only hope that he could meet the standards he had set for himself. The bar and the stakes were high. He simply could not fail at this point. To fail was to lose Dean. To lose Dean would be to lose his heart.
Shaking his head fondly at the image of an angel of the lord gleefully feeding ducks Dean turned on the shower letting it warm up a bit before stepping it. Today’s shower was different, today Dean decided to leave the water at the temperature Castiel normally used on the occasions that he bathed Dean. Blushing at the memories of Castiel bathing him while insisting that he played with bath toys so that he was not bored even though Dean was a grown ass man and should not be playing with toys. Castiel had not allowed that argument for even a second insisting that Dean had to relax in order to heal. Letting the warm water run over him was a nice change to the scalding hot or ice cold showers he had gotten used to, and if he was being honest long baths were even better. Being able to bask in the warmth of a bath while someone baths you was a very relaxing experience. However, this shower was not to be a leisurely one even if he was sorely tempted to indulge. No this shower was for pie meaning that he needed to be quick, but thorough enough to not have Castiel insist on bathing him again. Dean had quickly learned that Castiel was very serious about showering and if was not clean enough after a shower then the angel would insist on fixing it and would not let Dean clean himself for a few days after.
Castiel alternated between feeding Dean pie and stealing kisses. Sensual kisses that edged on the side of lustful with the pair exploring one another’s lips. Occasionally there was a fight for dominance, but every-time Dean would yield to Castiel the angel would deepen the kisses increasing the pleasure for Dean and making him lose the desire to fight for dominance. This dance of pie kiss pie kiss went on for a long while turning into an excuse to explore one another after the pie had long been gone. Being taken care of so gently had Dean floating high above the sky a feeling he had never felt while fucking a woman. Every nerve in his body was vibrating and he felt light and warm oddly he was horny, but he did not care he just wanted to be with Castiel like this forever. Strangely he felt the after effects of an orgasm despite not having one, a very bizarre feeling, a feeling that only Castiel had been able to give him. This light airy feeling caused him to drift off in the angel's arms much to the angels amusement.
Dean experiences his first punishment with Castiel.
Dean gaped. There was no way a man with a voice made of thunder could talk like that. It just wasn’t right. Nothing could be that strong and soft at the same time. It was an absolute paradox. His world seemed to flip upside down. Where he had been expecting rage and hardness came a soft almost poetic grace. Somehow it fit. The man bearing the most god awful trench coat he had ever seen just seemed right. The contradiction fit perfectly with his completely disheveled hair and perfectly tailored suit.
Dean was fuming. Who did this asshole think he was? Putting him in the corner like he was an errant five year old. He for the life of himself could not figure out why he remained in the corner. Something inside him just held him in place like his body knew what he was meant to do. This only served to further frustrate Dean. At least with Alistair he had fought back. He had resisted. He had had tried his hardest not to give an inch, to never  show even a hint of caring, and yet here he was shaking almost to tears at being placed in the corner by this man. No, there was no way he was a man. He wouldn’t have been able to beat Alistair if he had been a mere mortal. No Castiel was more than a man. He just didn’t know if that were a good thing or not. Everything his father had taught him said no but as he slowly began to remember his time spent with Castiel he just couldn’t see him as bad. No, infact he had been quite the opposite. Most dom’s treated subs as lower than dirt. He had spent his whole life in hiding because he saw the way everyone, even his father, looked at male submissives. Yet when Castiel looked at him it wasn’t with distance or loathing not even with lust. Just reverence and caring. It was as though Dean was his sun and moon all wrapped in one. So after that thought maybe his attack on Cas had been a little unwarranted… Okay maybe a lot unwarranted… Oh god, he’d been a real dick to Cas when all he had wanted to do to Dean was comfort him. Dean slowly began to spiral, caught up in his thoughts about how he had failed Castiel and now he wouldn’t want him and would give him back to Alistair.
“No,” The man’s hand stopped and he seemed enraged for a split second. Ready to kill. Until he saw the way Dean clenched up in fear trying to evade the blow he knew would come. Immediately beginning his ministrations again, he continued “I’m sorry if I frightened you little one, but when I think about what that monster did to you... What he has caused you to think. It fills me with rage. There is no punishment great enough for the atrocity of what he has done. Dean you are not pathetic. You are strong and amazing. The fact that you could endure what he put you through is utterly amazing. There aren't many that would have survived it. Yet you did. You came out of it strong and brave. I know you don’t feel either of those things right now but you will given time and healing you will be yourself again. But that can’t happen if you think thoughts like that. I will allow it this once since you were not aware of the rules but should it happen again there will be consequences.” His eyes softened once again as Dean began shaking. “Now, now little one they won’t be anything like what Alistair subjected you. I am strict but not unfair. They will fit any crimes should you choose to disobey them. I don’t suspect you will after you get accustomed to your new home, but I am sure at first you will struggle. It is in your nature after all.” Dean paled. Was he to be yet another freaks pet? No, he couldn’t. He couldn’t bare the thought of being someone else's pet. The agony of the first time was more than enough. The man chuckled “Do not worry little one you will not be my pet.” The relief was immediate only to be cut short by the mans next statement. “ You are to be my mate.”
Silence, Dean couldn’t remember the last time he had woken to silence instead of waking to his own screams covered in sweat from the never ending night terrors. He honestly had expected to never wake up peacefully again. Similarly, he had assumed that feeling reseted was a thing from his childhood. The life of a hunter having done little favors for feeling safe or rested, so the sound of silence and feelings of warmth were almost alien for Dean. Everyday for as far back as Dean could remember had been spent constantly fighting monsters and scrounging for just enough to get buy with so many years of constant moving and fighting it was hard to remember the last time he had a good night's sleep. Wracking his brain Dean tried to recall the last time he had felt so rested, while also searching for the source of this warmth.
“Hmmm since you’ve been so cooperative this morning I will give you a choice I can inspect you now or after pie. If you pick after pie and I find that you are not clean enough I’ll be bathing you for the next week, but if you pick before I’ll just assume it was an accident because you were so excited for pie” Castiel mused. So maybe choices without a consequence was a bit of a stretch, but was Castiel bathing Dean for a week really a consequence when they both enjoyed it?
A cool breeze jolted him out of his thoughts serving as a ground back to reality. Dean became aware of the softness surrounding him, the plushness of both the bed and the blankets, and the warmth of another body. It was strange because he couldn't remember ever waking up to Alistar since he normally left after he was finished toying with Dean. Then memories of the previous night came flooding back. He remembered the warmth of the angel, his gentle caresses, soft reassurances, and words of protection. Much to Dean’s embarrassment he remembered how much those actions meant to him. He remembered how they served to settle his nerves, how they lulled him to sleep, and currently how they served as a reminder that he was no longer with Alistar.
Safe, sane, and consensual still applied to their relationship and Castiel hoped that at some point they would be able to create a more personalized set of rules for them, but for now it was important to not throw Dean out left to his own devices. At this point, Dean had become accustomed to strict rules and consequences making it very overwhelming when he did not have the structure he was used to, and while Castiel would rather allow Dean the space and freedom to heal before introducing any type of dynamic to the relationship it was clear that it would likely drown Dean to suddenly be forced to make so many decisions on his own. Addressing the issue of Dean needing to regain control was a matter that they would work on overtime and it began by allowing Dean small acts of rebellion and by providing opportunities to make small choices free of any consequences.
Reminiscing on the struggles of mankind did little to ease Castiel’s worries regarding Dean serving mostly to ignite a greater sense of worry. Castiel had a deep understanding of time, as a result of being an ancient angel, he had seen the progression of man, the results of the struggle of mortal beings to press onto a new tomorrow, and he had seen countless fall to the weight of the present. The number of people Castiel had witnessed fall to the struggles of the present was seemingly endless. Will this perspective be able to aid Castiel on his quest to heal Dean or will it only serve as a chasm dividing the two?
“Good boy,” he murmured. “Good boy. You are so amazing and good. I promise you no one will ever hurt you again. You are safe and you are loved.”
“Dean, I’m sure you could under normal circumstance handle far more than I would ever dish out in terms of pain, but under this circumstance I can assure you that you can not handle much of anything, little boy. Infact I think it is time for a demonstration.” Castiel said as he hauled Dean up to his feet and marched him over to the corner. Inspite of the way it shredded his heart to cause Dean to fall apart at the seams, he knew it was of the utmost importance to establish dominance in this setting. He had hoped to avoid having to punish Dean, but better now that later he supposed. “Dean you will stand in the corner and think about what is and is not the appropriate way to speak to your mate and Dom. I know we haven’t had a chance to go over the rules, but common courtesy is definitely a given. While you are in the corner you will keep your hands either at your sides or clasped behind your back. At the end of your punishment we will be discussing how you will act in the future, so I would use this time wisely.” Castiel said before heading over to a single recliner, where he sat down in order to watch Dean. He would probably always have to watch Dean in a punishment like this if only to reaffirm that he would not leave.
Dreams, sometimes they seem more real than the reality. When our worst nightmares take hold of us there is no freedom no chance of exape until the dawn mercifully swoops in our behafe. The dawn has many shapes and forms but the function is still the same. To bring the new day and its reality. What shape will dawn take on for Dean?
Footsteps. The end was nearing. Taking a final look at the sky and everything around him Dean closed his eyes, giving into what ever would happen. The last thing he saw was beautiful. But nothing ever came. The end didn’t happen. The footsteps stopped at the door, yet nothing more happened. Where was the pain and agony? Was he not going to punish him for running? Beat the insolence out him. Rip every shred of hope he had, only to trick him with more, then take it all away again. The man just stood there seeming to appreciate the view with him, as though it meant as much to him as it did to Dean. As the moments ticked on Dean slowly opened his eyes peering back at the man. There he stood, leaning against the door, arms crossed, looking out at the landscape. Looking at it as if it was the most beautiful thing in the world. He didn’t seem enraged or vengeful. Just calm. Observing. It was a little unnerving to be honest. After getting used to random beatings it was hard to see something calm. The tremors started to creep back in. “No” Dean thought “ I won't let him win.”
Castiel was momentarily taken aback at the sudden outburst. Surely Dean didn’t think he would give him back… No he definitely thought that. Why else would he be in such a state? Pulling him onto his lap and tucking his Dean’s head under his chin Castiel embraced Dean as closely and as tightly as he possibly could. “Shh… Dean it’s alright. I would never give you away. You are mine and you will always be mine, and once you are feeling better and more like your self I will be yours. You probably don’t understand that concept yet but you will.” Castiel said as he placed a kiss on Dean’s forehead.
For a long while Dean didn’t know what to say. On the one hand he didn’t understand why someone like this man would want to save him. He also didn’t understand why he hadn’t just let him die. It’s what he had begged for in the end after he had given up hope of being rescued. Yet for some reason he didn’t want that anymore. This man made him feel safe. Loved. Cared for. But he hardly knew this man. He shouldn’t feel those things, yet when he looked into those eyes filled with hope all he could do was say. “Yes.”
Scoffing Dean said “Please I can take anything you can dish out.” Dean gritted out trying desperately to hide the tremors that were slowly starting to overtake his body.
“Roses have thorns, what could be more manly?” Castiel deadpanned feigning obliviousness before planting a kiss on the hunters pouting lips. “But just for you once or twice this week can we use your old soap. Sound good?” Castiel asked, failing to hide his excitement at the fact that Dean wanted the intimacy.
Dean’s eyes slowly fluttered open as his muddled brain tried to push through the fog. His brain was light as a feather and yet his body was an unmovable brick. Speaking of unmovable bricks, since when did Alistair cuddle? At first Dean snuggled into the warm body. To his utter surprise his captor hugged back, pulling him even tighter to his chest. This was a very nice mood… or maybe it was dream, possibly heaven. No this couldn’t be heaven. Surely Dean would remember dying. If Alistair was involved, it would have been terribly horrific. Dean’s thoughts were broken as he felt a gentle hand card through his hair. Something was not right. Even the best mood Dean had ever seen Alistair in was no where near this good. No, if this was real and Alistair was doing this then something terrible was about to happen. Trembling with fear Dean thought
“Good boy.” Castiel said and he meant it too feeling his heart swell with pride as Dean accepted the food from him. After watching the confusion on his face Castiel had been unsure if he would accept it but he was simply overjoyed. This was astronomical progress. Everything inside him wanted to scoop him up in his arms and feed him on his lap. Unfortunately that was currently not an option so he settled for picking up a grape and bringing it again to his lips. The caution seemed to lessen this time with Dean only hesitating for a second before take the grape slowly. He wrapped his lips around the grape, creating a vacuum and sucking it. The vibrations sending tiny shocks threw Castiel. Any lesser man would have acted on the way those plush cupid lips wrapped around his fingers, but alas Castiel knew it was not yet the time for that. If progress went well it just might be soon. Until then however he would stick to nurturing Dean in order to help heal the wounds that had been created. The small popping sound and lack of suction abruptly pulled him out of his thoughts. With a quick glass down he could see the hopefulness on Dean’s face that there would be more food coming. Chuckling gently he once again carded his hands through his pets hair and offered him a token of praise before continuing to feed him off the platter. He continued through this process for quite some time until he saw Dean’s eyes droop becoming half lidded and glossy. The calm seeming to consume him forming a blanket around him touching every fiber of his being. Through the course of the meal Dean had begun to lean against Castiel's leg resting almost fully against his thigh.
“Dean, wake up, it is only a dream. Nothing and no one can get you here," Castiel rumbled in his usual timbre.
After thoroughly cleaning and drying himself with the fluffiest towel he had ever seen Dean stepped out of the shower and began to dress in the clothes that Castiel had left him. A pleasant surprise was that they were his normal clothes instead of the lounge wear Castiel had insisted he wear most days. Well he thought they were his normal clothes until he put them on and found that they were still in fact exceedingly soft. Deciding that this was not a battle worth fighting Dean let it go, because really who would see him and even if someone else did see him they still looked like his normal clothes so how would they know? Soft clothing was something Castiel had admittedly insisted on, because it quote on quote helped Dean feel safer even if Dean insisted that it wasn’t necessary.
Blushing fiercely Dean nodded before once again asking “Pie now please?”
This was the calm coming before the inevitable storm. Knowing Dean’s past, Castiel knew getting him to accept this new life would be almost impossible. He hoped to show Dean that he could be both a hunter and belong to Castiel. That there was no reason to fight his nature. That sometimes good things do happen. He chuckled quietly to himself. It was probably too soon for that lesson. No, if he was being honest with himself he would be lucky if he could get Dean to accept the new routine compared to Alistair's or John’s. John. He had to figure out how John managed to keep Dean stable without putting him under. There had to be some outlet otherwise Dean would have already snapped. It simply was not possible for a submissive to function without dropping on occasion. The years of neglect definitely explained why he had dropped so impossibly fast. Damn it Castiel thought he needed to stop doing this to himself. There was nothing he could do about that now except address Dean’s future needs. Hopefully that would be enough. Looking down he realized that at some point Dean had fallen asleep. He looked so peaceful all the stress seemed to have melted away. Castiel decided that he too would sleep. Well not sleep -- angels don’t sleep in the same way humans do, but he could lay with Dean and enjoy his presence until he woke.
And at the end of the day does he finally stop.
And when that day comes, he's calm.
"Cas."
"Hello, Dean."
His face smoothing out, he gazed once more at Dean, his eyes clear.
Because he knows Cas was brought back, but that he's wandering the world without coming to see Dean, and Dean's unsure what to make of it. Doesn't know whether he wants to see Cas again, doesn't know what he'd say to him even if he did.
"They kept you out, didn't let you back up there? The hell do they think they are? You've done more for them and that place than anyone has ever done."
And so do the days pass, where Sam calls often, comes by the bar sometimes, or Dean goes to visit him and his family, plays with his nephews and nieces, because what Sam dreamed about wasn't broken angels with sad smiles, but about what it would be like to have a big family. And now even Dean kind of gets a feel for it in spurts.
As the words fumbled out from his mouth, his thoughts began to slow, where his mind was overtaken by a growing confusion while he tried to piece the world together with his empty, clenching then quickly unfolding hands.
When the other breathed out deeply, the sound was audible, almost piercing in the silence around them, though the distance stretched between them seemed immeasurable.
"So how's heaven? They treating you alright up there?"
"And then, when things got really bad, I thought maybe - maybe that it was you. That you had abandoned me too, that you weren't going to take me away from here. And I hated that I thought that, Cas, because I knew you were in pain too, wherever you were. That even if you never came to see me, you were still watching me somehow and you were hurting."
And gently, he tilted his chin upwards, letting his lips brush lightly against thin, chapped ones, parted slightly underneath.
"And I realized then that if peace was truly what I wanted for you to attain, then I would not have let us part like that. For it was selfish of me, I know. What I had done had brought me peace - so much peace, Dean. But for you it was something else entirely. A burden, perhaps. Another thing to tie you down. And I understand that now."
"That's why you never really got there - to your true happiness. Because I was holding you back, that little part of me that I had left with you. And I just wanted to say I'm sorry, Dean."
In the passenger seat are plastic bags crammed with snacks, in the back seat a neatly folded trench coat, which Dean sometimes brushes with his hand as he reaches back for another mix tape, another memory.
"What do you mean, you haven't gone?"
"Always, Dean."
But Dean  -
When finally, he breaks away, taking a step backwards as he brings an arm to his eyes, wiping at them roughly, he chuckles a little as his voice roughens, cracking.
"Hell, I couldn't do it. Back then, I didn't know what to say. Years after, I still didn't. What was once between us, what I felt about you - I just couldn't find the right words for it. I just couldn't, and I hated myself for that. But never you, Cas."
"Dean, I haven't gone to heaven."
All while listening to classic rock.
He's holding one last bottle, bringing it to his lips to chug it empty, before setting it onto the roof of the Impala behind him, patting the cold surface gently, reassuringly, before turning back to the skies, sighing heavily.
Dean lurched forwards, his shoulders shaking hard, as his hands shot outwards to hold onto the sides of the angel's neck, forcing Cas to look at him with widened eyes, as his own gaze blurred and he sniffled, his voice hard.
He swallowed again, sniffing hard, as he turned his face away.
And as he sings at the top of his lungs, however hoarsely, sometimes he glances to the side or into the rearview mirror - sees the smiling faces of Sam and those he once called his family, his friends. Hears their voices in the background of each song, as he smiles all the while, never faltering.
So does he soldier on, laughing just as loudly, slow dancing to all the songs of his youth - arms held out to an invisible lover as the jukebox plays behind him and softly does he serenade the empty room, where he's alone under the dim light, eyes closed to the world, substituting it for a dream.
Cas stared at him, his lips falling apart to speak, though Dean forged on through, gaining enough control of his body back that an irrational, desperate anger slams into him all at once, propelling his limbs into motion.
He felt the angel in his arms tremble softly, but he had to keep going, now that he had gotten so far.
"Because I left like that, without saying goodbye, because I never gave you any indication of what I was thinking ahead of time."
And they have no children, just the pups that Miracle - who had limped alongside Dean for so long - had left him. Just taking care of the bar, going through life a day at a time.
For he no longer moves the same - slower now, where he always feels tired.
His hands slid around the angel's waist, as he chuckled again.
Because it's hard to forget someone who he once spoke to every day, and so does he start saying a few words every night, closing his eyes and clearing his throat awkwardly.
But this time, the angel's eyes were brighter, his smile softer.
And now he knew what it meant, what the other had always wanted to tell him - this time, and all those times before.
And as the other smiles slowly, uncertainly, it is then that he finally breaks as his face crumples, his heart wound tight, and he opens and closes his mouth wordlessly, shaking his head uselessly from side to side while he tries to figure it out, all that's happening too suddenly.
Yet still he wonders.
And for a moment, they just stand there, the two of them, as Dean holds on tightly and Cas places his palms gently on his back, warm through the thin fabric, despite the cool breeze.
"The world is a good place. Not the best place - not by a long shot. But just like the Empty was waiting to take you away until you were truly happy, it was doing the same for me, I realized."
"That's all I ever wanted for you."
Dean stepped in closer, just a little bit until their faces were just a breath apart. Smiling weakly, he let his head fall forwards, pressing his forehead against the other's, closing his eyes to the startled, broken gaze staring back at him, wordlessly, as he opened his mouth.
Cas had crossed his arms, a little smile flitting across his face.
The other sniffed, his voice hoarse as he spoke, uncertainly.
As he looked at the clueless angel who stared back at him, his eyes opened so wide it could have been that the universe had spoken to him then, told him its secret, as the old trench coat fluttered helplessly in the wind, and the world stuttered to a halt around them as if holding its breath just for them, to keep them there in that moment they shared together.
"You know, Dean - "
A widow, maybe, with a kind smile, who speaks softly and asks Dean each time how his day was. And so does Dean give it a chance - settling in with someone for the long run, who he had no ties to, bond or not, debt owed or not.
But Cas' smile solidifies, widens, until he's smiling just the same as in their final moments together, his eyes shining bright. And the words he utters next, so simply, so easily after all this time cause Dean's knees to buckle, as he sags forward and into Cas' arms, his shoulders heaving as the tears squeeze out, trickling uselessly down his cheeks.
"What?"
And as he speaks to Cas a little more each time, until each evening he's spending a dozen or so minutes just running through his whole day, reliving it so that Cas gets a feeling for the time Dean spent without him - this woman starts appearing in the bar.
But he stopped himself.
Cas straightened suddenly, turning to Dean again, with a sharp intake of breath, his eyes shining with quiet tears.
The angel paused, his voice softening just a little as his chin dipped to his chest, before he raised his head again, his expression solemn.
"I always liked it best - this time of day. Or night, I should say. When all the world is quiet, and it's just you and all those strangers you've never met and all those people who ever meant something, at peace for once. Because, when the morning comes, everything gets kicked back into gear and the earth just keeps on moving, carrying everyone and their burdens along with it. But then the sun sets and the universe becomes still again. Peaceful. And that's all I ever wanted for this world."
And then they go their separate ways.
And sometimes when he opens his eyes again, does he think he sees a figure standing far from him against the other wall, smiling sadly, though when he blinks again whoever it was is gone - replaced by shadows cast by everything that could not longer be, that had long since left him behind.
