Now it was Tony’s turn to blush. His cheeks turned crimson and his lips curled into a small smile. “Stick around long enough and you just might,” Tony said, sounding assured and confident, like he was making a promise.
The Atlas was the nicest restaurant in Timely. Granted, it was the only restaurant in Timely, so it didn’t exactly have competition. It was new, only added to the humble town a few years prior, created to meet the unexpected demand that came about when gold was discovered about fifty miles west. Timely, as a result, became a frequent stop for many looking to get rich quick. And with no real restaurant in town, one had to be added to meet the new need. While the gold and the rush to get to it had long since dried up, the Atlas remained. A shadow of its former heyday, but it was still there when the people of Timely were wanting a splurge or in need of a celebration.
“I did, Wrecker!” The red-masked man replied. “This was the nicest building in this dump of a town, so I figured a bunch of rich folks would be here!” He pointed at Tony. “Like that guy! Look at that fancy pants suit he’s got on! I reckon he’s got more money in his pockets than in the entire last bank we robbed!”
Jarvis nods. “Yes, I make it every year for Mr. Stark and, uh, you.” He looks at Steve dubiously. “Are you alright, Captain? You’re acting like this is the first time you’re learning of this.”
“I’m removing the medical ports from her chest and abdomen and back. I think they might be infected.” There was a pause. ‘Things like these are normally and properly used to help treat cancer patients. And usually only found in the chest…I’m not sure why she has so many. I haven’t found any signs of cancer in her body yet, though. The tests are good.”
“ I still owe you, don’t I?” He asked, and Tony moaned aloud when Steve dipped his head low and swirled his tongue around his belly button. Without warning he took him all the way into his mouth, and Tony bucked his hips up. Steve stayed still, and Tony moved his hips experimentally, thrusting up into Steve’s mouth. Steve looked up at him, those blue eyes searing, and Tony couldn’t help it. He fucked up into Steve’s mouth, over and over and over, and Steve just laid there, adjusting his position every now and then, keeping his jaw relaxed and his eyes on Tony. He moaned when Tony came, pulling back before he was finished-Tony wasn’t sure weather it was an accident or not, but the sight of Steve with his face messy was something he’d put away for the jack off files in his mind. Not that he’d needed those lately.
"It's you," is all she said, a series of emotions crossed her face, and before he had a chance to say anything she hugged him. He couldn't help but melt into the contact. She was his best friend. He'd told her about Tony, she'd been the one who'd helped him propose. He owed a lot to her. She pulled away and looked him up and down, for once her emotions not well hidden on her face. "You need a haircut," she said with a smile. "Come fined me later. We'll take care of it."
“ Steve, stop, don’t be sorry. You said no and I kept pushing. I shouldn’t have.” Steve looked absolutely tortured.
" Of corse she was-" Natasha put a hand on Steve's arm, and he once again shut his mouth, jaw clenched. "Sorry."
"I'll do it." he said simply. There was a look between Natasha and Bruce, as if they hadn't expected him to agree so easily. " Are we done here? I gotta get back. If she wakes up and I'm not there it's not gonna be good."
“You didn’t have to do that baby,” Tony said, dipping his head down to lick a stripe along Steve’s cock. Steve’s hands shoot to Tony’s hair and his hips cant up, looking for more simulation from Tony’s hot, wet mouth.
Things were calm now. The bodies of the dead had been removed, the stains cleaned. The smell of antiseptic was maddening, but Tony couldn’t bring himself to leave. It still didn’t feel real. He still felt like he was going to wake up at any moment. Tony took a long gulp of his too hot coffee. The glass of the holding cell was one way. He could see in but they couldn’t see out. He’d been standing there for nearly an hour, just watching. Steve was asleep. The kid was smushed next to him. They were on the floor, despite there being beds in the cell. It only occurred to him after the fact that this might be exactly what the two had escaped from.
“Alright, send her in. I’ll see you at seven, Steve.” Tony said, and Steve stood, gave a small wave, and made his way out of the room. He walked past Pepper and forced a smile, holding the office door open for an old woman with a casted arm.
“I’ve had these before,” he said, taking a bit of one, closing his eyes, glad to just have something to chew on “They’re supposed to be for emergencies…” high in calories and nutrients, they tasted like dirt. It was better than hunger pains. “How long have you been here?”
Tony woke before Steve and turned off his running alarm. He spent a good five minutes staring at his face. The swelling had seemingly gotten worse, or maybe it was just the fact that the bruising had darkened. He tried to go back to sleep, but it was useless, so he got up, showered and got dressed for the day. By eight o'clock, he was up in the kitchen, reading the paper from a tablet, sipping on his coffee. The early morning hours had a certain unique quietness to them. Tony wasn’t sure how he’d never noticed it before. Maybe it was because normally at this hour he’d be hung over-but that was before Steve. To be completely honest, Tony wasn’t even sure if Steve knew-
“You’re back kinda-” Tony looked up mid sentence and gasped, Steve took a few steps back and laughed.
“ Hello Pepper, it’s wonderful to see you too. I’m doing great, thanks for asking.” Pepper rolled her eyes and set another stack of files on his desk.
Tony couldn’t speak. When he tried all that came out was a shuddering sob. It had been so long since he’d seen her. God, how he missed her. He saw a lot of her in Morgan. Every day she got older and every day Tony wished she had been alive to see that he’d done some good with his like.
She yawned. Steve saw a mouth still full of baby teeth. He saw a long scar that ran the length of her neck, a bandage peeked from under the collar of her gown.
"It's fine," Bruce said, but something about him was off. Steve didn't like the way he was looking at him. Natasha either, for that matter. She didn't say a word, but he could see it in her eyes. Something was wrong.
Steve lets out a particularly loud grunt. His hips move, ever so slightly, like he’s trying to break the confined of sleep and fuck the air. His cock is actually
“His secretary. Assistant. Hell, I don’t know what she does, really. “ Steve said, once again throwing the comforter over the bed, adjusting it so equal amount of it hung over the sides.
.” Her tiny voice in his head. Her little hand palm down on the skin of his shoulder. This is how they’d communicated for the past three years, eleven months and twenty two days.
"Maybe we'll get you one. I'll have to talk to Steve." The Kid grinned, and Steve was about to turn to ask Clint what exactly he said the could get her when he felt Tony's hand over his. It was light, and only there for a moment and gone just the next.
“ I was in the military for a while.” Steve paused and swallowed hard. He was having trouble talking about it, and Tony was having trouble getting passed the part where Steve had been in the military. It wasn’t even in his files, there was no record of it at all. “ It was...top secret. Special services. Finding and infiltrating terrorist bases, fleshing them out from the inside it was...it was scary work. We did a lot of things..The Howling Commandos did a lot of things we shouldn’t of, things I didn’t agree with..but they were orders.”
“We’re going to have a feast,” He said, grinning, tearing open a few more packages for the kid before opening several for himself. He didn’t think they’d ever tasted so good. Once there was five of them in him he felt a little more alert. He was able to assess his injuries, and the Kid’s, for that matter. He was in the middle of just that when her tiny voice floated into his head.
“I wan’t to suck you off,” Steve murmured in his ear, voice low. “But I’m not gonna do it if you’re wasted.”  He kissed Tony again before he could speak, he could barely react-just those words in his ear made him feel like he was going to cream his jeans right there. He swallowed thickly. When Steve pulled away, Tony chased his lips.
“ I’ll see you there then.” Steve said, taking a few steps back winking  as he headed to leave the pool.
“Jesus christ,” Tony breathed into Steve’s neck, smiling. He stroked Steve a few times, removing his hand only to spit in it and return it to Steve’s throbbing member. He twisted his hand on the pull, just the way he liked it himself. A little vein throbbed just under the pink head, Tony could feel it, and desperately wanted it in his mouth. He lowered himself down, moving so he was on his stomach on the car bench. He ground his hips a few times, delighting in the friction of the seat against his dick.
Things had been fine at first. Immediately SHIELD had been notified, at least as immediately as possible. Tony hadn’t been sure what to do with himself in the moment, and for a good forty-five minutes he paced around his workshop trying to ensure himself that he wasn’t actually truly lost his mind. He must’ve asked Jarvis a hundred times if Steve was actually standing in the communal kitchen barfing up two day old pizza. Tony supposed it had been Jarvis who’d notified Shield, because within the hour agents were crawling all over the building, and leading a withered Steve out of the building, the kid holding on to him so hard he was already bruising. Bruising! Tony’d seen the man thrown through entire buildings without acquiring a single bruise, but there he was, tiny finger prints pressed into the little meat he had on his shoulder. He looked like a skeleton walking.
“I’m not trying to scare you, alright? I just...I don’t want to have to be the person who tells you this.” She said carefully. She cleared her throat. “Morgan’s there.”
“  You’re just a little tense is all.” Tony pushed him back against the shower wall. He grazed his teeth over Steve’s shoulder, and Steve let out a small moan. His dick was interested, and it pleased him to know that Tony had been hard before he’d even stepped into the room.
“I’ll see you around, Miss. Potts,” Steve said, making his way over to the elevator and leaning on the wall next to it.
“What’s wrong with you? How high do you have the voltage on that thing?” The man in the white coat waved again, and suddenly there was a prod zapping at his own abdomen. Steve felt his muscles spasm involuntarily. An angry grunt escaped him as he clenched his teeth.
“Yeah, well the world isn’t fair, babe. Now turn around so I can wash your hair.” Steve sighed and did as he was told, ecstatic to find the back under complete control.
“ And why can’t you do this yourself? I mean you clearly have the money and the technology at your disposal” The man next to Matt quipped. He looked skeptical, untrusting.
Between the thought of that and what he wanted for breakfast, he managed to get back to sleep, situated mostly on Steve’s side of the bed.
“I know. I’ll see you in an hour, Tony. Try to get some more sleep. You worked late last night.” And like that he was out the door. Tony muttered to himself and pulled the blankets over his head. He knew from experience he had exactly ten minutes until Steve’s side of the bed got cold, so he had to fall asleep in that time or it wasn’t happening at all. His thoughts drifted away from Steve and to the work he had to do that day.
Tony shrugged. “ For maybe three minutes. It doesn’t even hurt anymore, I promise. Just...go to sleep, alright?” Tony pulled the comforter over them, fully aware he was straight out lying and that he’d have a bruise the next day. A bruise he’d have to explain to Pepper.
Steve was laying it on heavy, Tony can see it in his face. He’s intentionally pushing every button he can reach-but he scoot’s back immediately at Tony’s request worry just barely breezing through his features.
“Fuck,” Tony muttered, running a hand through his hair, smoothing it out. He readjusted his sunglasses and tried to pretend he wasn’t looking at Steve over the pages of his book, but it was hard. He was just so damn…there wasn’t even a word for it. For a while he’d decided to ignore the crush. It was pointless. He’d been Steve’s tormentor for too long. He’d been the one who’d given him the nickname ‘Wheezy Stevie’ in grade school. He’d been the one to exclude him from games, the one who wrote rumors about him in the bathroom stalls. Why the hell would Steve give him the time of day?
“Blueberry pancakes, and a pot of coffee.” The grumpy waitress had appeared once more, and Tony couldn’t help but be slightly frustrated that she’d pulled him from a very
When he got to the gym, there was nobody there. It was old and dusty, nothing like the big and bright newer boxing gyms with all their technology and weight training. It was simply a place to go if a person wanted to beat the shit out of something in peace. Peace Steve didn’t get much of- nearly twenty minutes after he heard the door open and close.
“What, Kid? Don’t you want to be called something else?” She didn’t answer him. She kept her knees pulled up to her chest. “Do you have anything to eat?” he couldn’t help but ask the question. To his surprise, she nodded. She moved to the far back corner of the room, next to the toilet. She pushed on the wall, something he hadn’t even thought to to.A compartment opened, no bigger than a foot all around. Something clattered down inside. She came back to him with brown speckled blocks that looked more like sponges than anything.
Steve looked down at her. She looked better than she had even a week ago, clean and already gaining a little weight. Her hair was cut short, there'd been no saving it. The matting and tangling had been too much to correct. Now, it sat in a curly mop atop her head, just above almond eyes that seemed to have a little more shine with each passing day. Steve hadn't even known it was curly in the first place.She'd been angry at him for that one. She still was.
“Jesus, Pepper. It was an accident. Don’t look at me like that.” The look on her face didn’t change, however, and Tony had to turn his back to her, he didn’t have time for this, and he wasn’t in the mood to have the discussion. Not again. “I know you don’t like him, alright? But he loves me. He’d never…he’d never do
“ Yeah, you gotta problem with that?”Matt took a few steps back and put his hands up, and Steve took that as his chance to get a couple of punches in. Matt staggered back.
“This better? You want me to fuck you harder? Make you come all over the wall without me even having to touch you? This what you wanted all along?” Tony asked, his mouth completely dislodged from his brain running on it’s own accord between groans he bights into Steve’s shoulder as he picks up the pace, relishing in the sound of sweat slick skin meeting sweat slick skin.
“Oh, that’s interesting,” he murmured, when his hip brushed past Tony’s groin, and just for a second Tony thought maybe he’d stay…but then he was kissing him and getting up again.
“ Yeah,” Tony said, nodding once he’d realized he’d left Steve hanging for a bit. “ Yes, definitely Friday. What time?” Steve was taking a few steps backwards looking at him like he was some sort of...something special and smiled and held his hand up to his ear, thumb and pinky extended.
"I'm sorry! Sorry, I just got excited. You make great sandwiches. I was never able to recreate them." Clint said, softer this time. The Kid put her hands on either side of her face and sighed, overwhelmed. Clint ambled over to her.
“Haven’t you seen enough?” Steve asked after swallowing. He wanted to talk about everything else. He wanted to talk about how he’d seen the funeral. About how he’d seen the news reels about Tony and Pepper sometime after. At the time he’d hated that they’d been shown to him, knowing the only purpose was to break him, but now he was quite glad. It wasn’t something he’d have to find out on his own.
Tony smiled. He remembered holding Morgan the day she was born, Steve looking over his shoulder. They were a pair of speechless fools. Tony hadn't been able to process the squirmy little girl in his arms, she was too perfect. What he had been able to process though, was the overwhelming sense of his mother. He'd nearly been able to smell her perfume, it was so strong. As a man of science, he'd written it off as a manifestation of his wish for her to be there and moved on.
“You don’t like me.” Steve explained, face red. This was a redness Tony was well aquatinted with. It sat high on Steve cheeks and reached the tip of his ears.  Angry red. “Not me, you like this.” He continued, sweeping a hand to indicate his body. “And that’s fine. I don’t care, but if you liked me this would’ve happened a long time ago.” And then he was out the door. Tony listened to his footsteps down the hall, to the front door open and shut, to Steve’s  truck make that awful sound as it started  that was some how just the perfect description of how he was feeling.
"You don't know how it happened?" Maria asked, her voice hushed. Tony had nearly not gone to get her, afraid that Morgan might wake up to find him missing, but she was the only one he could really get advice from.
“ ha ha,” Steve muttered- he was in a bad mood, but Tony had always been able to remedy that easily.
“ Because,” Steve said, quietly, shifting to hold Matt’s hands in one of his own and used his free one to press Matt’s head into the ground. “I’m not in all that great of a place right now,” he murmured quietly, trailing his fingers down the back of Matt’s neck. “ It’d be so, so easy to just-” he put a hand at the base of the guy’s neck and made a cracking sound. He started to struggle, but the more he moved the further his arms went behind his back.
“One hundred and fifteen degrees in the Valley today with reports of blackouts across San Fernando-“ The weather man droned on. If the radio wasn’t sitting all the way across the room he’d of turned it off. Tony wanted to cry. He was hot and sweaty and feeling downright
Tony couldn’t pretend like he didn’t see Natasha creeping back to the lake, and he worried for her, but hoped she might try to find something out. She'd probably know by nightfall.
They sat there for hours. Steve told him about his childhood and his dream to be an artist, about his friend Bucky who’d gone missing eight months prior. He’d looked sad when he was talking about that, and Tony couldn’t believe that a guy who was so good had gone through so much hell. When it came to be his turn to talk, Tony told Steve about how he’d wanted to be an engineer, but his father had the law firm and it was the family business so he’d had no real choice.
It was that thought that lead to Tony dragging Steve home with him that night from Denny’s. It lead him to push Steve trough his front door, to kiss him while they fumbled down the too long hall of the too empty house to his bedroom. Steve hardly seemed to even notice where he was, he was so focused on pulling his clothes off. Tony took that opportunity to jump him, take him by surprise so he’d stumble back and fall on the bed, taking Tony down with him.
“Would it be teasing if I asked you to fuck me?” He breathed, so quiet it was barely anything at all. He punctuated the question with a roll of his hips. He sucked on Steve’s earlobe, not a ole to his the immense pleasure in the deep groan that came from Steve’s chest. “You like that idea?” Tony asked. “I do. Been thinking about it all day. Had to jerk off in the shower with my fingers in my ahhh-“ He was cut off by Steve flipping them over and kissing him hard. He almost tore the button off his jeans pulling them off of him.
They’d taken his uniform, when had they taken his uniform? In it’s place he wore what appeared to be a light green scrubs. It’s rough fabric was like sandpaper on his wounds.
angry, he could feel it, it was heavy and suppressing, and away was the urge to vomit. It was replaced by a new urge. Steve wanted to hurt the man in the white coat, he wanted to make him feel what he was feeling all because-
They stayed in the coffeeshop until it closed, at which point a tired looking college student walked up to them and jangled the keys, and Tony gave him a big tip as they walked out, leaving the kid stunned.
He’d struggled to no avail. Things had been bad then, but an agent tried to grab the child from his arms, and that had been then end of it. The little girl had flung an arm up, palm out. The agent touching her went flying, and hit the wall with a sickening crack, a bloody stain on the wall where his head had hit. Things pretty much just went to shit from there, and Tony was more or less forced to leave the room. He saw the footage, though. He saw how with just a clench of her tiny fist the kid crushed skulls and ribcages from feet away. Nothing good would come of power like that.
“I need your help finding someone.” Pepper said. It was odd, being in this part of the city. It wasn’t the daily norm she was used to, but Hell’s Kitchen had it’s charm.  "He might be related to something? Um, the Howling Commandos. It might be a secret military team-I’m not sure. There’s notes there. I took the liberty to print a copy in braille as well.” Pepper said, biting her lip. Pushing the file towards the men sitting across form her. She was sat across from Neslon and Murdock, the only law firm who’s likely be able to help her. Not because they had the means, exactly, but because they were the only firm crazy enough to call her in for a meeting after being contacted at two in the morning.
As he finished his food, Tony stood up, put the wrapper on the bedside table, and stretched. He wished that they had some painkillers, but he wanted a lot of things right now. He wanted to be at home, be himself. However, he also wanted Steve to wrap his up and kiss him like Tony had never been kissed before, but neither of those things were likely to happen.
“Shush Tony, let me show you”, and Steve pulled down his pants to right below his knee. There looking back at Tony was his soulmark. It was a mark that he knew well, one that he stared at in the mirror on nights when he just couldn’t sleep.
The melody was sweet and sad at the same time. Steve found himself getting lost in the music as he played. The timbre of the piano and ease of the harmony fit so well together that Steve felt transported.
Steve pulled his pants back up and looked Tony dead in the eyes. “Tony Stark, you are an enigma and I’m so happy that it’s you.”
One of the hardest parts was movie night. He made an effort to actually remember, hoping that things could feel a little bit like they used to. When he walked in, he noticed that Steve wasn’t in their regular spot on the loveseat, but had taken up residence in one of the arm chairs, leaving Natasha to sit on the loveseat.
“You didn’t have to do that.” Tony moved just enough so that his head was resting by Steve’s leg, making it easier for him to rub Tony’s head.
“Mr. Stark! Do you blame Captain Rogers for your injury, for not getting to you sooner?” A blonde reporter shoved her way through the crowd of people. Tony turned to her as fast as his injury would let him.
“Oksy, so am I right in assuming I was quickly buried in 100 tons of concrete?” Tony asked, trying to lighten the mood, and it almost worked when Steve huffed a small laugh.
“Yeah, Doll. I would say that we are past that.” Steve had the most breath-taking smile on his face, something that was just for Tony.
Steve placed a finger under Tony’s chin and tilted his face up. He caught Tony’s eyes and tried to communicate how much he loved him before leaning in to kiss him. The kiss wasn’t heated or full of fire, just every ounce of unconditional love and support they had for each other.
“I’m tired of people thinking that I’m incapable of doing anything, that I have no control. I have control like you wouldn’t believe. You have no idea. I am a beacon of self-control”, Tony ranted, thinking about all the ways life had been frustrating him.
He heard Steve moving and then felt the bed dip and he laid down next to Tony. He moved close enough so that Tony knew he was there but not too close that they were touching. Tony started to cough a little and Steve rubbed his back through it.
The words Steve said didn’t really register. He was too busy soaking body heat Steve was throwing off. Tony was starting to shiver, whether that was from being cold or from shock was anyone’s guess, but Steve just gripped him tighter and walked him with a newfound determination. Tony’s eyes slipped close before he knew it; he was letting his consciousness drift in and out.
“I’m not avoiding you; I’ve just been busy.” Even Tony could hear the lie in his voice, and Steve just chuckled.
“No buts. We have all the time in the world and right now you need rest. So we are going downstairs and I’m going to put on a mindless show and you are going to fall asleep.”
Tony forced himself to turn his back to Steve and went to sit back on the bed. He heard a small sigh coming from Steve, followed by steps moving away from him. As Tony sat down, it took everything inside him to avoid looking up; his eyes fixed on the dust bunnies next to the bed frame. He only looked up when a bottle of water was shoved in front of his face.
“Yeah, I’m uh- good. Just trying to relax.” Tony hoped that Steve would drop it, but he was never that lucky.
I surprised myself by finishing this so quickly! Thank you so much for reading, and I hope you enjoyed it.
“It’s like you can read my mind, Cap” Tony closed the distance between them and grabbed Steve’s hand, pulling him over to the couch in the corner of the room.
“You know, when I woke up from the ice, I thought I had lost everyone. That I would never find the person that was meant for me. That they would have been long gone, and I accepted that. I had even let my heart open again, ready for whatever was to come my way.” Steve stood up at this point and started to take off his belt.
“Sorry Clint, what did you say? I can’t hear you, maybe a little louder?” Tony matched his volume as he turned to pour himself a cup of coffee.
The doctor came in and told Tony what had happened, how the surgery had gone, and what he would have to do in the upcoming weeks. The whole time the doctor spoke, Steve sat next to Tony, nodding along with all the instructions.
“Yes, I think that you should make a note of that for the future,” Tony said, grabbing Steve’s hand and pulling him toward the exit.
“Tony, we gotta slow down. You’re still hurting, and if we keep going…” Steve bit his lip and looked Tony up and down. “Let’s just say that I have plans for us.”
He slowly sat up but ended up just laying back down when the spins hit him. Dizzy, cold and shaking. Definitely not a winning combination. It was getting increasingly more difficult for him to ignore the signs that he was sick. Still, he didn’t want to believe it.
“What? I’m someone?” Tony watched as Steve adjusted his posture, standing a little taller and looked at him determinedly.
“You should try and get some more sleep. Nothing else we can do.” Steve finished his bottle of water and sat on the couch.
He sat on the bench in the workshop, knee bouncing, trying to conceptualise an update to the armour he had been trying to finish. The hologram in front of him was starting to blur in front of his eyes. He took a deep breath and stood up.
What caught Steve’s eye and made him want to laugh was a photo of Young Tony, dressed in a Captain America costume, looking happy as can be. Steve reached into the box and pulled it out and couldn’t contain himself.
“Nope, not okay. Steve Rogers is in no way to blame for my injury. He did everything he could to not only save me, but diffuse the situation. I know he will always save me when the time comes.” Tony then turned away, looped his arm with Steve, and dragged him to the waiting car.
There was no mistaking it. Everyone knew how this worked. You say the full name of a person, feel the tingles and your mark fills in with colour.
“You hungry, Shellhead? I found some freeze-dried blueberries, protein bars, and some sort of beef jerky. If you’re feeling up to it, you should eat something.”
“Take these, we need to get your fever down. Drink as much water as you can without making yourself sick.” Steve put the glass and the pills into Tony’s hand and turned to walk back into the bathroom. Tony rolled his eyes at Steve but did as he was told because really, he felt like shit and wanted to get better as fast as possible.
“I don’t want to forget," Tony rushed quickly to say. "I just never thought that I would be hearing you say this, not to me, at least.” Tony took a deep breath,
“Steve, I fell for you too, and I was just content to stay friends, but I think we are past that now, aren’t we?”
“Yes I did. Tony, you haven’t had any fluid or medicine. You’re not going to get better if you don’t, now let’s go back to bed.” Steve stood and then picked up Tony slowly, not wanting to upset his body more than it already was.
He made the mistake of thinking it was ok to move, trying to roll onto his back. That’s when his stomach lurched and he sat straight up. Not caring how much his body hurt, he got to the bathroom as quick as could and leaned over the toilet.
“I guess I ran the numbers and they made sense. The suit is designed to take things like that and it did. I’m not dead, no sense in worrying.” Tony was just trying to placate the growing anger that he could see building.
“Alright! Now that we are all here and the movie-picker has arrived, let's get this party started! What are we watching tonight?” Clint spoke, enthusiastic as ever, looking expectantly over to Tony.
Oh, Steve. For a brief happy moment, he had forgotten about the predicament that he had found himself in. The thought of having to go sit down and watch a movie and pretend that everything is okay makes his head start to spin, already trying to come with reasons as to why he can’t go. Natasha looks at him as if she can see the wheels turning in his head.
“Why didn’t you say anything?” Steve couldn’t keep the hurt out of his voice. “Is it because you don’t want me?”
“No, of course not! God, I’m sorry. I’m just a piping hot mess when it comes to things like this. I would rather suffer alone than have you reject me. I didn't think that you would want to be saddled with me. I was trying to protect you.” Tony waited for the arms to pull away, for the rejection to come.
Tony straightened himself and ran his hand through his hair, hoping he didn’t look too much like someone who was overtired and craving to dive back into the spot he just vacated.
“Well then, let’s get walking” Tony started to walk, only to stumble as his whole body protested the movement.
Steve pulled away just as Tony’s body had started to react to the stimulus, wanting more than kissing.
He didn’t even hear Steve making his way back over, just just felt the blanket being tugged up his body over his body. He then felt a cold towel being pressed onto his forehead and he had never felt more grateful.
And with that, the last of any thoughts fell away, and Tony fell asleep. Not too bad for being one of those days.
It was the second time that day that Tony woke up. Except this time, it happened slowly. He felt groggy, like he didn’t want to open his eyes and become aware of what was going on. With his eyes closed, he took stock of his other senses. His mouth tasted like death, and his bed wasn’t as soft as it usually was. The room itself smelled of chemicals, and he became aware of the beeping of a heart monitor. He finally decided to open his eyes and saw that he was laying in a hospital bed.
He swatted away the spider webs and opened the door, cautiously walking inside. He was only in the cabin for about 45 seconds before he appeared in the doorway.  He walked down to Tony and put an arm around his waist, basically carrying him in the cabin.
Steve glanced at him and gave a little half smile then looked away. Tony had to stop himself from turning and walking out of the room.
One of those days when nothing was going right, Tony couldn’t concentrate on anything. Mind bouncing from one idea to the next, never quite forming a full thought.
The second, more surprising, thing Steve saw was a big object shoved in the corner, in front of the floor to ceiling windows. Steve walked over to it and pulled the cover back.
Tony unwrapped the burger and started to eat, falling into a comfortable silence with Steve, just enjoying each other’s company, lost in their thoughts.  Tony finished his burger and started to pick at the fries, stopping for a moment to give a jaw-cracking yawn.
Tony tried very hard not to take it personally. He knew that he should be grateful, and that Steve giving him space was something he should want, something that he pushed for. The sting was still there though. The friendship that they had worked so hard to build wasn’t something that could be maintained, not now.
“Yes, I’m sure. Now concentrate; I don’t need you stepping all over my feet.” Tony wanted nothing more than for that conversation to be over. He didn’t need Steve taking care of him, no matter how much the thought made his stomach twist.
Tony felt a little lost. He thought that Steve was just a good friend, a good friendly-friend, but it was now starting to seem like his feelings were mutual.
“Come on now, what’s going on? No, don’t roll away, Sweetheart, look at me.” Steve forced Tony to roll over and tipped his face up with a finger under Tony’s chin.
He made his way into the bathroom and took a look at himself in the mirror. His skin looked pale and his eyes heavy. He ran his hand through his hair and noticed that his hands were shaking slightly, most likely from low blood sugar. He tried to eat earlier in the morning but wasn’t really hungry, and the thought of eating now turned his stomach.
The piece is only about two minutes long, and as it draws closer to the end, Steve is brought back to the world.
“How much longer do we have to stay. If you’re tired, we should go.” The concern grew deeper in Steve’s face now, and Tony wanted just to kiss it away.
“I am so happy that I get to be that person”, Steve whispered to Tony like he was the most precious thing in the world.
“It’s small and musty, but it’s solid and has a bed.” Tony was then set down on the bed in question, sending a puff of dust into the air.
As he became more aware, Tony made sure all his parts were there. Wiggling his toes and moving his fingers. When he tried to move his fingers on his right hand, he felt that they were somewhat restricted. When he looked over, he finally noticed Steve holding his hand, head down on the bed.
Nothing could touch Tony here. Not the battle, or the wind or the snow. Nothing could get him wrapped up in Steve’s arms. He knew that they had things to talk about, that they should have a real conversation. None of that mattered right now; that was a topic for the morning. When the team picks them up, and they are in the safety of the tower. Right now, all they needed was each other, the snow, and the fire to keep them warm.
The ride back to the tower was silent and strangely tense. Tony wondered if he had said something wrong, something that Steve didn’t like, but he was coming up blank. He noticed that Steve was absently-mindly rubbing his hand over his thigh and Tony wondered if maybe he hurt himself and didn’t say anything. He knew the serum would take care of things but if it was serious enough it could hurt for a while.
“Alright, enough of this sappy stuff. I want to see what else you can do, piano man.” Tony was pulling Steve back over to the piano, while Steve raised his eye at the nickname. “Right, you don’t know that song yet. We will put it on the list.”
Face buried in equations, Tony didn’t really stop to think when he heard Jarvis say something about Natasha. He just hummed and kept working.
Tony hoped that Steve couldn’t see the blush in the firelight as he ducked his head. He just ate his blueberries in comfortable silence, the only noises being the cracking of the fire, the whistling wind outside, and the rustle of the food wrappers.
A few minutes into the movie Tony’s body began to relax, until he felt his legs brush up against Steve. He went to jerk away, but felt a hand rest on his knee, preventing him from moving. Steve leaned over and moved toward him, his body pressing along Tony’s.
“Tony, you just got out of the hospital. As much as I would love to make you mine, you have to take it easy.” Steve stood up, dragging Tony into his arms.
“Well, we’ve been talking about it for a while and I think it’s time that we finally start Star Wars.” There were a few hums of agreement and a small woop from Clint, excited as always.
Tony forgot about everything that happened that day. Any pain and worry he had was long gone as Steve’s lips moved against his. His lips were soft, and there was the perfect amount of pressure. Steve’s tongue darted out and licked Tony’s bottom lip, causing his whole body to shiver. Tony moved to press himself against Steve fully, but Steve pulled out of the kiss.
His fingers flowed over the keys like it hadn’t been years since he had played. The muscle memory was taking over and guiding his hands in a way that surprises him. The soft, muted melody flowed out of the piano, and he closed his eyes and let the music wash over him.
Steve Rogers was his soulmate and Tony had no idea what he could do about it. It's not like he could tell him. No, that would only end in disaster and he couldn't put the team in jeopardy. Not when they had finally found their stride. Plus, he had heard that soulmate rejection was the most painful thing a human could experience. No, Tony would have to keep this to himself.
They continued just to hold each other for a while until Tony decided he had something else on his mind.
“Tony- ahem- Tony, can I kiss you?” and there were no words to describe how Tony felt at the words Steve had said.
“Sir is just gathering a few items from his bedroom; I am sure that he would not mind if you met him there,” Jarvis told Steve.
As he started to walk, he thought about what Steve had said, and he knew that Steve was right. He hadn’t been taking care of himself and maybe he should just go to bed. The thought of going to bed after just cuddling with the super soldier filled him with unease.
Their pace down the hall was slow. The Kid wasn't a strong mover, really. She'd lived her entire life in that cell. She'd never needed to be.
Tony shrugged. “ I’m fine. I’ll be even better after a cup of coffee and some good conversation.” He pulled open the door to the coffee shop and held it for Steve.
“Like hell you will, out of my kitchen. You can buss until you’re off the clock…” Tony watched as a sodden Steve Rogers was shoved out of the kitchen, wearing an apron and rubber gloves over the already bland Denny’s uniform, looking thoroughly defeated. He looked nothing like he had at the party, where he’d been relaxed and happy, blue eyes shining and soft. Now he just looked tired. He held a plastic tub under one arm and used the other to grab dirty plates from table and wipe them down with a rag. His feet barely lifted from the ground as he shuffled from table to table, muttering to himself, ears red. Tony wasn’t sure what do do. Did he say something? Did he pretend like he didn’t see him? Steve certainly hadn’t seen him yet, too busy with work, and Tony was running out of time to figure out something to do, because the next table that needed to be bussed would put him directly in Steve’s line of sight. Tony decided to do what anyone else would- pull out his phone to pretend he was engrossed in Facebook.
“I’m gonna come in you Tones. It’s gonna be a big load, it’s gonna fill you up. Two and a half weeks, babe, all of that just dremching the inside of your ass. You’ll be full. You won’t be able to move without me dripping out of you.”
“Always looking for fun, Nat. It can’t be like that anymore, though. I’ve got a guy now. A good one. Need to get some things sorted if I’m gonna keep him.” As Steve flattened out the sheet over the bed for the second time, he heard Natasha snort. It peeved him a little, but he needed her help.
Pepper raised her eyebrows. Tony knew for a fact she wasn’t a fan of him. From day one she’d seemed skeptical, but Tony was getting tired of it. They’d been together for going on three months. Steve wasn’t going to rob him and leave. Tony knew that for a fact.
“When did you stop working at the pool?” Tony asked, confused. He’d already figured that Denny’s had to be why he wasn’t there today, and then apparently there was the Starbucks now too.
“Hope you’re not having too much fun without me,” he said, closing the bathroom door behind him and walking over to the sliding glass of the shower. Tony jumped a little and looked at him wide eyed, and Steve laughed. “ Sorry, didn’t mean to scare you.” He stepped under the hot spray and placed his hands on Tony’s hips, kissing the side of his neck.
“Shit, I’ve got to go, Tony.” He said, tucking himself back into his pants and tossing the soiled shirt onto the floor of the passenger side.
“Go out with me.” Wow. He really knew how to woo ‘em. “I like you,” He added, hating how it was all playing out, eyes darting away from Steve’s face when he turned to look at Tony.
“What’s he doing?” Steve asked, interrupting whatever the hell Tony’d been saying. It was hard to care, seeing her like that.  He looked at Tony then, only for a moment. He looked frustrated.
It had been a long time since that day. In that time, Tony had gotten to know his mother. He’d gotten to know the rules of the place he found himself in. There was no one name for it in particular, most people just called it home. Tony estimated there had to be millions of people around, in their own little Corners. People didn’t cross paths often. The only place to meet outside of their personal Corners was the field people arrive in. It was unlawful to enter a Corner of another person unless invited.
"They are," He corrected. "but nobody here's ever going to hurt you. They're happy you're here." Hungry himself and impatient with their pace, Steve gave in and hoisted the Kid up into his arms, finishing the walk in only a few moments. The Kid put her little hand on the back of his neck.
“I want you to stop for a sec,” Tony grunted, doing everything he could to actually catch his breath, to focus, because
“ I won’t-I’m not gonna touch em’, ever again, you got my..you got my word.” Steve pulled the guy off the ledge and smiled. “Good, that’s good. See, that wasn’t so hard, was it?”  he asked, straightening the guy’s shirt and hair. The guy nodded and laughed nervously, standing rigid and still. His eyes flicked to the door behind Steve.
“ No,” He said, shaking his head. “ No, I hurt you, I was being an ass-” Tony shook his head and threw the toilet paper in the toilet. His nose hadn’t even bleed that much.
She solves his quandary for him, fisting her hand in his hair and tugging until he looks at her face.
"Yeah," Sam replies with a sigh. "So believe me when I say, I know what it feels like, to lose one of your people. Your future. Gone in under ten seconds."
Come Wednesday, he can't settle no matter how much he berates his brain to give him a break and not treat this single date like the be-all, end-all. Sure, Tony is really, really very attractive, and he's
"Later," Steve promises, catching it out of the air and pushing his arms into it, squatting down to lace and tie his boots.
"I'm sorry," Tony whispers. His thumb traces Steve's eyebrow. "Steve, you're not - you're Captain America, yes, but you're also Steve. My Steve."
Tony's attention is back on the road, for which Steve is grateful. "One," he says out of the corner of his mouth, "I always look good, baby. And two – I don't need you to do anything but be yourself. Maybe don't wander too far away. I tend to make enemies when I'm bored and the company doesn't need more people to campaign for me to step down as CEO."
. They also share memories from their childhood, Tony endlessly curious and always so eager to know everything Steve chooses to impart.
"Like this?" he asks, gesturing to Steve on his back, dick jutting out between his legs to point straight at the ceiling.
"Likewise," Steve simpers, shaking it limply. It's taking everything he has not to burst out laughing and ruin the charade.
"Oh, give it up," Pepper says to him, leaning across Steve. She smells wonderful, like vanilla musk cut with something warm and spicy. "Jealousy does not become you."
The bar's light fixtures give it a golden amber sheen, welcoming and enhancing the upscale mood. It's Thursday evening, which Steve picked deliberately because weathering a Friday night in a place like this seems like advanced mechanics. Maybe with some practice, it will feel less daunting. The place is pretty full despite the weeknight, mostly with businesswomen in skyscraper heels and hair unwoven from the tight buns they favour during the day. It's nice. Steve likes the atmosphere, likes these decisive, driven ladies. They remind him of Peggy, and how good it felt, to have her in his corner, at his back, pushing him on and taking the lead when he couldn't seem to find his way. Steve despises the 'strong women' classification men appear compelled to utilize these days. All women are strong, and no man should ever even consider a woman being anything but.
"Well," Phil says. In the corner of the room, Clint is doubled down on the couch, shaking with laughter. "Can't say I'm particularly shocked."
The thing is, he woke up but turns out, I can’t see him. Everyone thinks it’s safest that we don’t interact. Shuri says it’ll take time. She wants to be sure before she lets me see him. Or him see me, more accurately. It’s just – he’s SO CLOSE. But maybe I wouldn’t be helping. Maybe I would be
"Steven? Steven, come here, you simply must meet Miss Chaney – oh, it's Cheney? Whatever, either way."
Steve is not now, nor has he ever been, the giving-up type. So maybe it's time to push forward. The escort thing is fun, and it sure rakes in the cash, but it's… too easy. A cop-out. Something he'd fallen into when he'd been angry at the world and looking for anything to funnel his rebellion. He's made some good friends through it, is the surprising part – he knows that Katya and Stacker and, yes, Tony too, will remain in his address book for as long as they want to be there. But, he also knows, it's time to try something new.
"Take these off," he says when they pull apart for air, fingers scrabbling over the button and zipper of Steve's jeans. "And the shirt. Been wanting to see that body all night."
"You're the one who invited me to dinner," Steve reminds him mildly, taking a sip of his beer without looking away, so he doesn't miss the way Tony's eyes flick over him, dark and considering.
How are you? I hope you’re well, because I am ROTTEN. I can’t sleep, I can’t eat, everything is TERRIBLE
"Right, see, a lot of people around here are suckers for cocktails, and of course as their bartender I encourage the hell out of their choice. But for me, personally, on a night out, I like to drink bottled. That way there's less of a chance someone might slip you something, and also the drinks keep fresh longer. You got any allergies, flavour preferences?"
Tony winks devilishly. The next second, he grabs Steve's wrist and spins him in the other direction, the two of them sprinting away like excited children, helter-skelter towards the empty deck on the other side of the party. Tony skids to a stop outside a closed set of doors to what looks like a supply cupboard; he sends Steve a conspiratorial look and throws them open to reveal—
"Mister Stark," Steve says. His voice sounds only a little shredded. That's the best he could hope for at the moment.
. With that incentive, and mindful of the fact that his muscles tend to tighten again if left to their own devices, Steve slips in a plug, one of the flared ones he loves to tease himself with. Even if Pentecost is bigger, Steve should at least be loose enough to make it easier to take him.
The bar, when he gets to it, is well-lit, furnished in shades of metallic dark-grey and neon – lime, orange, blue, pink. The tables and chairs are metal and plexiglass, and it's nothing like Steve is used to, but it's so perfectly the future, this future, that he finds it's easy to let go of the memories of dance halls and jazz orchestras as he makes his way to the see-through lime-green plastic bar. The short black man behind it looks him up and down, and grins with all of his perfect white teeth.
"Good evening, Sir," a cultured male voice greets them. The British accent feels to Steve like the soft fur of a cat rubbing along his ankles. "I see you have company."
I just want to tell you that I’m sorry. Why is that so hard to put into words? I guess because I’m not sorry that I didn’t let you kill Bucky. Don’t you understand that killing him means killing me? Again? I didn’t manage to do a good enough job back in ’45, but if it happened again, well, I know a lot more about myself now. I’d know what to do.
And that is how Steve finds himself breaking yet another of his professional rules, and pressing dial for a client's number, something he'd sworn to himself he would never do.
"You don't have to talk to him if you don't want to," Yingtai says reasonably, widening her hazel eyes in entreaty. "I just thought it might be nice for you guys to meet."
Tony stares at him for a long moment, and Steve tries to look innocent and guileless while internally berating himself for slipping up. But it does get Tony rhapsodising about street food in LA, and honestly, Steve could probably listen to him read the phone book at this point and be content. Also - food. Twenty-first century food is one of the great joys of Steve's new life.
Tony want things. That's up to him. And if this is it, if Tony's got him out of his system and is ready to move on to newer and better things, then maybe it's time for Steve to try and do the same. That's just the way life goes.
Making them pant, lose themselves in the feelings Steve helps them uncover – that's his reward. The accounts executive who goes like her strings have been cut when Steve tells her to get on the floor. The graphic designer who asks to fuck him with a strap-on (spoiler alert: Steve is on his back with his knees by his ears before she has time to change her mind). The tall, heavyset cardiothoracic surgeon that sobs with how hard she comes when he fucks her against the wall, her weight negligible in comparison to the cars Steve has literally bench-pressed since the serum.
"Yeah, okay," Tony concedes. "Seriously, though. You're smart, you're funny, you're hella good looking, and you're more open and honest about who you are than 99% of the people in my life. Maybe I just want a little bit of that brightness for myself."
- for some food for you two, and coffee by the gallon. Shuri doesn’t like it, she has this energy boosting juice she designed percolating in a vat at the other end of the lab, delivered to her station by means of some underground propulsion system that I don’t understand, but I bet you would.
Phil, on one of his rare visits to Steve's place, looks around at how it's started to fill up, and leaves with that little reassuring smile of his. A few days later, Steve receives delivery of a package of framed vintage New York photographs, and nestled between those, a candid of the Howlies somewhere in London, a lucky shot someone had captured of them all sitting around a table and laughing uproariously. Bucky is leaning into Steve's shoulder with his head tilted towards him, one of his old grins holding cockiness and genuine amusement that had come so scarcely after Steve found him again. Steve puts that one up in the living room, across from his favourite seat on the sofa.
"I'll hold you to it," Tony yells, already sprinting down the corridor into the lab, where the newest incarnation of the suit is ready to be assembled around him.
"That's what he wants," Barton growls. He's looking at Phil now with that same focus, and Steve can practically see the hearts in Phil's eyes.  Those two are made for each other if Steve ever saw the like.
Katya looks at him with speculative, narrowed eyes; then she spreads him out on her bed, pushes his fists closed around the grates of her wrought iron headboard, and
Steve looks at the new arrival like she's an angel from on high; which, let's face it, she really is.
"Cool, man. Well, here's something I enjoy a lot. Picked it up in London, they go nuts for this shit. 'S called Smirnoff Ice, there's vodka in it, and it's got a lemon twist. Wanna try?"
"This complicates things," Phil muses, turning towards an old-fashioned drawing board - probably to keep their operation offline. "If we have to keep the military out as well as HYDRA…"
He gets up and snags his jacket, heedless of the two dozen people recording his every move, and looking at Steve like he's missing something.
Tony smirks, smug and pleased as pie. "You know me so well already, Sergeant," he says, batting his really very pretty eyelashes.
"If you ruin my evening, I'm going to make flying to Japan seem like a summer vacation in the Hamptons," Phil threatens, and the line goes dead.
He buys Phil a blueberry muffin instead of saying any of this, pushing aside his protests with one of the blank looks that served him so well when dealing with Colonel Phillips.
this could feel so good. Sure, he's tried touching himself there, slipped a finger inside himself a couple of times, even, but there's apparently something about another person's touch that has his entire body feeling like it might catch flames any second.
"Yeah, sir, please, please give it to me, I want it so much," Steve babbles. He is never this vocal, and he has never said such filthy, ridiculous things to any of his previous clients, but there's something about Pentecost that makes him want to beg, keep at it until he gets what he needs.
It pulls Steve up short. That tone has warning bells all over it. Steve is giving away much too much, and it seems to have snagged the attention of the Tony who zooms in on a tiny thread and doggedly follows it along until the whole tapestry lies unravelled before him. Steve swallows fitfully. The problem is, it's also Tony at his most attractive.
"Yeah, he was something," Steve agrees softly. So Phil, too, is like him. It doesn't have anything to do with him, but Steve still feels comforted to know.
"Maybe I don't want to provide any more services to you," Steve snaps - reckless, so reckless, Tony is a
I would be much obliged to you if you would either destroy it or return it to me, c/o King T’Challa. I’d also appreciate it if you’d follow your own advice and disregard its contents. I understand my position and I would not wish to make you uncomfortable by forcing you to contend with emotions I cannot control.
"And me," Sam agrees, still looking ashen. "Fuck, that's a trip. ...Oh, pardon my French. Are you touchy about stuff like that?"
Sam crosses himself. "Jesus, Mary, and Joseph," he whispers, looking sick. "Oh, man. No wonder you're fucked up all to hell."
She introduced me to the other warriors in the Dora Milaje, and told them something in Wakandan - and now here I am, not moping but definitely regretting some of my choices as I gingerly shift in my seat.
The first thing he noticed was the modern design. It was all clean lines and metal; it looked like a museum. Steve saw no personal artifacts anywhere in the living room or hallways. It was quite the juxtaposition to Steve’s warm and full living room. He could understand why Tony wanted to spend his time on Steve’s floor.
Tony thought briefly about going to sleep on the couch, but that sounded like the last thing he wanted to do. There was also no way he was going to ask Steve to sleep on the couch. He worked so hard; he deserved not to be squished up on some tiny couch.
“Close your eyes, sweetheart. Go back to sleep”, Tony heard as he started drifting again. The words didn’t register. All he could think about was the feeling of Steve’s hand rubbing small circles on his shoulder.
“And yet somehow you manage to be.” Steve laughed lightly. “If you say you're fine then I trust you but get some more rest, ok? You’ve been working so hard lately, I don’t want to see you burn out.”
He knew that Steve could be such a mother-hen and he really didn’t want him to worry, not while he was busy with Shield. Besides, despite what his body was telling him, Tony Stark did not get sick.
“I’ve been practicing in my spare time. You know, I didn’t want to stuff it up if I ever did have the opportunity to dance with someone special.” The blush only grew in intensity.
No, Tony was a grown-up. He could handle his emotions, and by that, he means ignore them like his life depends on it.
Before he realized it, the adrenaline was leaving his body, and his head was resting on Steve’s chest. When he became aware of this, he lifted his head. Steve was already carrying him; he was going to bury his head in Steve’s neck. That didn’t sit well with Steve.
Shawn pauses, looking up at him. Whatever he must see has him moving straight away, reaching for the light switch that turns out to be just next to Steve's shoulder.
Steve rolls his eyes. "I'm a decent person who deserves nice things," he repeats dutifully. It's not his fault it wouldn't convince a baby.
Steve has a split second to wonder if he should salute, but he's trying to stay under the radar here; and besides, Lt Colonel Pentecost is offering his hand like he expects nothing more.
Clint makes a sound not unlike a stepped-on squirrel. Then he launches himself up from the sofa and into Phil's arms, wrapping all of his appendages around him.
Steve shakes his head. Agent Coulson is a good man. He has glimpsed as much, even from their brief interaction. Where the rest of the SHIELD agents he has bumped up against in the several weeks he'd been awake looked at him like some kind of freak show, a mixture of pitying and disdainful looks following Steve everywhere he went, Coulson has been kind from the very start. He was the one to sit down with Steve and walk him through using the telephone and the computer he'd been given. When SHIELD called him in to tell him point-blank that he was an obsolete model who had no place in the modern SHIELD organisation, it was Coulson who had worked to get his backpay transferred to his new identity – Steven Rogers, Jr., the grandson of a legend, whose mother was begot with some of the genetic material obtained from the supersoldier during initial testing, though those records were sealed as a matter of National Security. Steve Rogers the second was born in the early eighties, raised by a single mother just like his grandfather, and orphaned at nineteen by a car accident involving a drunk driver. He has his grandfather's looks and artistic talent, and has no affiliations to any known intelligence organisation.
"Hi," the woman says, cocking her hip against the bar. Her lips are a pale caramel colour that makes Steve want to lean closer to taste them. "I'm Laeticia."
Fuck it. His life is a science fiction novel. If he can't go out and bring someone home in this day and age, well, he might as well go back under the ice and stay there.
"That's me schooled," Phil quips with that pleasant, enigmatic smile that Steve has come to associate with him alone.
Steve slides his phone back in his pocket. Sam says nothing, though he'd be entitled to any number of questions, not to mention snarky comments. He just strolls down the sidewalk, nudging Steve in the right direction every now and again. Just under five minutes later, Steve's phone goes off. It's an obnoxious string of guitars that Steve startles at, then rolls his eyes. There is only one person who would hack his phone to change his ringtone to some guy wailing about shooting to thrill, and Steve makes an effort to bite back his smile because, just, no. There has to be a line, and he's drawing it over being charmed by obnoxious breaches of privacy
? With you? Oh my god, you are an idiot. Steve, Captain America is a construct. It's the man behind the mask who's important. It's
Tony's face does something Steve doesn't look at too hard. Maybe he should've stuck to the lie. But... He wasn't lying when he said he didn't want Tony to walk away.
"No worries," Shawn says, leaning in again slowly, as if he wants to give Steve the chance to push him away if he wants to.
The sharply indrawn breath on the other side of the line makes Steve bite his lips together so as not to giggle. God, he loves baiting Phil. Best entertainment, hands-down.
Sam's mouth twitches and purses before turning down. "My wingman. Riley. We were on patrol doing fly-bys. An RPG took him down out of nowhere. I couldn't do shit. Felt like I was put up there just to watch."
Pentecost's eyes travel down and back up his body in a lazy exploration that makes Steve's skin buzz with awareness.
Once an hour ticks over, Steve admits defeat and gets up to go. He leaves a few dollars for the waiter's trouble, then strides slowly outside into the cool night air. He straightens his jacket, smirking wryly at his earlier self over the trouble he took with his attire, then turns north to make his way to the nearest metro station.
Another day, another awful gala. I think Ross gets a kick out of parading me like some wolf on a leash - see he won’t bite, he’s harmless, i took away all of his teeth.
"Steve Rogers," Steve says, taking it. Pentecost's grip is firm and reassuring, calluses matching Steve's own, and he looks Steve in the eye without trying to lord his rank over him. Steve finds himself effortlessly sinking in that space between parade rest and awaiting orders. Huh. Looks like his army days aren't quite as behind him as he'd thought. "I should probably salute," he admits. Steven Rogers Jr. served, too, albeit briefly, so it's a perfectly legitimate thought. "Then again, I don't know if you'd want a salute from a mere US Army Sergeant."
"Thank goodness," Steve agrees. "I'm more than happy playing the dumb arm candy. Speaking of, what are your expectations for this evening?"
, there didn't seem to be a right moment to say, 'Oh, hey, by the way, Howard Stark;s son is thinking of moving back to New York from Los Angeles where he ran off to after his parents were killed in a car accident.'"
He knows, theoretically, that they make a striking couple, but it still takes him by surprise to catch their reflection in one of the glass doors - both tall, his blond hair a contrast to her dark, shining twisted braid, her hand wrapped possessively around his arm. It makes him feel good, to be necessary in some way to her. It also gives him permission to touch - not inappropriately, of course not, but a hand at the small of her back, her elbow, letting her take point and following happily where she leads.
" Katya murmurs drowsily, blowing him a kiss as Steve salutes her with two fingers and lets himself out, pausing outside Katya's door to make sure it's locked and to push the folded bills into his back pocket.
"Man, shut the hell up," Sam tells him, rolling his eyes. "Do you know how long it took me before I could look another vet in the eye? Two years, Rogers. Two years and seventeen days. Sometimes, there's so much pain inside you, it don't leave space for anyone else's. You're not a bad guy because of it. It's not your fault everything was ripped from you. It's not your fault you're not ready to take on someone else's grief as well as yours. It'll get better. It won't ever go away, but some day, you'll look at someone pretty badly off, and you'll see your way to helping them through to the other side. And it ain't a problem if it takes you a few years to get to that point. Anyone tell you any different, they've never been even remotely close to where you're coming back from."
"Definitely call me," Steve tells her as he settles his undone tie around his neck and buttons his jacket.
Steve is not unfamiliar with the concept of being touch-starved. He knows that's what he used to be, that it played a big role in his choices at the start of all this. He knows how much it helps him settle into his own skin, to feel another person's body close to his, to be touched by another living being. He can't imagine someone like Pentecost would have too much opportunity to indulge in easy, unselfish skin contact, either. It just seems like another thing Steve can do to help him out.
The thing is, he sounds pissed, but he's still holding Steve's hand, and that is the only thing that really matters. Surely if he was that disgusted and disappointed, he'd have stormed out by now? At the least, he wouldn't still be touching Steve like he wants to keep him.
Stark is still staring creepily at him, as if he could drill a hole right through with the power of his focus. Steve would not be shocked to find that is indeed the case.
Steve tries hard not to tense, but being plastered all over Pentecost like that, he isn't sure how successful he is. One of Pentecost's fingers trails over the chain of Steve's dog tags, and oh, fuck, he'd forgotten to take them off before he left his apartment. It probably fuelled Pentecost's fantasy to see them bouncing against Steve's chest, but it probably also gave him the chance for a good look, and Pentecost is better placed than anyone Steve has fucked to know what they mean.
Maybe it was time to stop. Tony wasn’t getting anywhere right now, and perhaps someone was home that he could just sit near, distract himself.
Thankfully, it didn’t last long as he hadn’t eaten in many hours. He continued to sit on the bathroom floor however, enjoying the feeling of the cold tiles, laying his head down on the floor. He closed his eye, trying to stop the world from spinning, when he heard a voice-
“ You know that wasn’t fair,” Steve murmured, nipping at Tony’s earlobe. Tony shivered and pressed up against him, kissing him hard and dirty. Steve could taste himself on his tongue.
“ So what happened?” Tony leaned forward and put his hand over Steve’s and Steve grabbed it and held onto it tightly, like it was a lifeline, like Tony was the only thing keeping him together.
“Come on big guy. Let me at least get you a coffee first.” Tony got out of the car and smoothed his shirt down. They were far enough away from the courthouse that they could breathe freely. It had been a big case- Seeing as the deaths of two local business owners were involved. Truthfully Tony was scared. He saw the crime scene photos. Those men weren’t only murdered, they were ripped apart. Whoever'd done it had had something against them and a more than serious problem. Whoever did it was the exact opposite of Steve, who was kind, bright and so good Tony was afraid of tarnishing him. Whoever did that was still out there, and likely to do it again. Tony wondered if that meant he was in danger. He’d cleared the name of a man who could of taken the blame-that was more than enough reason for a person to hold a grudge. Suddenly there was a hand on his shoulder, and Tony turned to look at Steve, who’d been talking. He hadn’t even realized.
Later that night, Tony took Steve to bed and worshiped every single inch of him. He started at his neck, just behind his ear.
“I don’t know why you don’t just do what you want to, I mean you’re successful enough as a lawyer, you could probably drop it all now and start working on projects and still be fine.” It was true, sure, but Steve didn’t really understand. Tony was obligated to run the law firm, and that was that.
For now, he rearranged Morgan on his shoulder as he walked her away from the field and into the house he'd built, now for them.
“Stop teasing,” Steve huffed. He actually seems truly annoyed the next time he looked Tony in the eye-which was never something that’d happened before when they were like this. Tony could feel the hard line of Steve’s erection pressing firmly against his ass and had a wonderful, beautiful idea. He ran his mouth from Steve’s nipple, up his chest and to his neck, where he didn’t leave any hickeys no matter how badly he wanted to. They were chest to chest once Tony got to Steve’s ear, and he ran his tongue along the shell of it.
“I thought that was a given.” Steve said, sliding his hands in his pockets and rocking on the balls of his feet for a moment before starting for the bedroom door.
“Y’ need sleep.” He murmured, “Jus got t’ sleep.” Tony snickered a little and pulled the blanket up wiggling closer. He laid there and waited for sleep to come to him. He set a number in his head and started counting back to zero. He was almost asleep when Steve spoke again, surprising him.
“Seducing you. Is it working?” Steve asked, reaching out with the hand not holding the popsicle and dragging Tony to him but the collar of his shirt, eliminating the space between them.  He smirked and wiggled his hips against Tony’s.
“I’ve seen more than enough,” Tony responded, breaking through the tumbling stream of thought. Steve saw a visible shudder go through him. “That’s why I’ve got to ask the question in the first place.” That made sense.
“ No, you were too far gone. I wanted you to sleep.” He kissed down, and down and down, and then suddenly he was on his back. Pressed into the mattress and he moan, because the feeling of Steve’s weight was so familiar, he knew what was going to come, and the anticipation was better, maybe even the best part of it all.
“ Hello? Earth to Steve?” Tony leaned forward and waved a hand in front of his face, Steve grabbed it and kissed it.
“It’s kinda hot in here. Might wanna fix those generators before we do that again.” Tony laughed and smacked Steve’s arm, but he sat up anyway.
as the orgasm rolled over him, taking over his entire body as he came hard over his hand. Steve slid off of the dildo to sit on the shower floor. His eyes were still closed and his breath came to him in big huffs. His wet hair stuck to his forehead and neck. He only sat there for a moment before he stood, still looking dazed. He dislodged the dildo from the tile and turned off the water.
“I thought I saw you.” Tony whirred around to come face to face with-well face to pectoral, rather, with Steve Rogers. He was looking at him oddly, the corners of his mouth kept twitching, like he was trying to refrain from smiling. Realizing he was just standing there stupidly, Tony ran a hand through his hair, doing his best to be cool, looking at Steve over his sunglasses.
“ Alright. If you say so, but I was saying I wanna buy. I more than owe it to you.” And there it was, that sincere puppy dog look that had Tony’s heart on a leash. He couldn’t say no to that, no matter how much he disagreed with it.
Steve laughed quietly and pulled a shirt over his head, which was a shame. At some point a lot of Steve’s clothes migrated and mingled with his. Tony just had them washed with his pile, which was his unofficial way of asking Steve to move in.
“Coulda killed me,” Steve huffed squirming when Tony shoved a hand in his boxers, smiling mischievously at the erection he found there.
"Be careful." is all she said. Tony could tell she wanted to say more, but she didn't. "Ring me when the little one wakes up."
He was just about asleep not five minutes later when a big, warm hand caressed his side and took residence on his hip. Lips appeared at the back neck.
"We were at the mall. They took me with them." A small shudder ran through Morgan's body, Tony tightened his hold on her and looked at Natasha over her head.
Tony looked around and saw a small kitchenette with what looked like a hot plate and a mini-fridge that Tony didn’t even want to consider opening. There was also a couch tucked away in the corner, covered in all sorts of blankets that were probably just as dusty but looked more and more inviting the colder Tony got. Like Steve was reading his mind, he gathered up the blankets from the couch and brought them over to Tony on the bed.
“Okay, time to come up for some air”, he heard her voice say right over his shoulder, startling him out of his daze.
“I know you get like this when your mind won’t quiet down. I figure a movie will help you relax, and even if you can’t sleep, you can at least unwind a little.”  Steve’s eyes were soft as he spoke, some emotion behind them that Tony couldn’t quite place. Or maybe, something that he was scared to place.
Tony accepted the hand and just nodded, letting himself be pulled and walked over to the door. He tried to remove his hand from Steve’s grasp only to have his hand squeezed tighter. Tony glanced over at Steve, who was steadfastly looking forward as they walked down the hall to the elevator.
Steve hit the guy three times. Once in the face, once in the chest and once in the gut. That should have taken him down, it should have been enough, but the guy reeled forward and hit him hard in the face anyway. Blood erupted from his nose, and he saw black spots in his left eye.
It happens two or three times after the night in Steve’s truck. Tony catches him at the pool the first time, just as it was closing. Steve shoved him up against a shower stall and kissed him so hard he has a bruise on his shoulder blade from being pressed into the tile. The next time Tony went to Denny’s again-but they never managed to make it out of the parking lot. Tony refused to pry himself from Steve’s wonderfully sculpted body for even a second, and would’ve been embarrassed about the way he ground up against said body had Steve not been moaning like a porn star. Each time it ended the same way. They’d get each other off, and there’d be a quiet moment when there was nothing but just breathing as Tony’s upstairs brain came back online and urged him to ask Steve to dinner, to coffee, to anything, because quickies in parking lots and pool showers weren’t  enough. Tony wanted him in very sense of the term, and it was awful. He was a sadistic fuck for it, because he knew it could only last until he left for MIT. And there was Steve. Steve who was literally working three jobs back to back every day, who spent the small amount of free time he hardly even had with his mouth on Tony’s dick and a hand on his own. That had to count for something, didn’t it?
“ I said not tonight, Tony,” He moved to turn over, but his elbow smacked Tony straight in the face. Pain erupted in his head, and Tony could feel warm blood dripping from his nose. Steve’s hands were on him in a second, dragging him to the bathroom.
“ Some crazy stuff happened last night,” he started, flicking an article, scanning it quickly. “Some guy was found dead a few blocks away. Suicide.Jumped off the roof of his own apartment building.” Tony swallowed as something cold settled in the bottom of his stomach. “Thing says he left behind a few kids.”
"I don't. I haven't asked. She's already confused enough, I don't want to make it worse." Tony said, looking down at Morgan where she slept on the couch.
“Do I owe you money?” Sitting in the chair was Clint Barton, looking rather amused, eyes too bright. He was one of Steve’s friends, and looked incredibly bored and wildly sunburned. He seemed quite miserable.
“Oh, hey. I didn’t see you-“ Nice, Stark. Real nice. Steve really did smile then, and Tony thought he’d fall over. Who gave him the right to look like that? “Life Guard, huh?” Tony pushed his sunglasses up onto his face. He might as well drown himself now.
“As long as it takes to finish testing. They’ve tested negatively for everything than can be tested for without actual blood work.” Bruce let out a long breath and turned his back to the cell. “The rest of the clearance tests are going to require a few samples.”
“I guess we’re both caught then. To what do I owe the pleasure? It’s been a long time. Saw you on TV. Didn’t think I’d be hearing from you again.” There was something in her voice, Steve wasn’t sure exactly what it was. He wished he could see her face. She was hard to read, but he’d always found he could do it. They were the same in that way, and many others.
Steve woke with a gasp, wincing at the pain in his shoulder. He’d woken and slept three times, but without being able to see if it was day or night that didn’t mean anything. It was long enough for infection to set in his shoulder. The skin around the wound was hot and reddened. He’d flushed the wound out with water from the tank of the toilet situated in the corner of the room. For the first time in a long time he thought he might have a fever. It was hard, but he paced the length of the room to keep himself awake. He genuinely wasn’t sure how or if the serum would react to infection. It was nothing he'd had to worry about since the war. Tf something wasn’t done soon…
“ Yes, thank you I-I’ll get the money to you by the end of the night. I’ve got to get back before Tony gets to the office but-” She stood, the thought of not being there when tony arrived was nerve wracking. She was never late. He’d know in an instant that something was up it happened out of the blue. “ This needs to stay under wraps. Keep it as safe as you can, and call me as soon as you have this Bucky guy. I want to talk to him myself.”
“Tell me you’re not gonna lay a hand on those kids again, and I’ll let you go.” Steve said quietly, leaning the man further over the edge. The guy rushed to repeat him, but all that came out of his mouth was a desperate, strangled bunch of sounds.
Oh. Well, Tony hadn’t even known Steve a year and a half ago. Maybe Tony was being too paranoid. He took a bit of his food and sat back, wiping his mouth with his napkin.
And then he was gone, turning down the street and into the darkness, and Tony was once more left alone, wondering not what the hell had just happened, but
“I finished earlier than I thought I would. I’m glad you’re here already, I was afraid the food was gonna get cold.” Steve said, setting his stuff aside. The swelling in his face had definitely gone down, but the blue black discoloration was still there.
And then Steve was gone, lost in a mass of people heading to bars and strip clubs, and Tony was left standing there, staring like an idiot.
“Oxy? Really, Tony?” Steve asked, opening the bottle and shaking out a pill. He popped it in his mouth and turned on the tap, bending over it to take a sip of the water directly from the faucet.
“You come here often?” Tony asked, immediately as he put the bottle he’d brought on the table. Steve looked over at him and then
That’s what sends Tony over.  He thrusts hard one more time, pressing Steve forward into the wall, shoving him into his own mess and dumping his own deep in Steve’s ass.
Maria walked some paced away and turned her back to him. Tony changed quickly. It was odd to see smooth, unmarred skin under the charred clothes. He pulled on the simple t shirt and jeans and folded the clothes he’d been wearing. He had the odd urge to keep them.
“Guess you could say that.” Matt said, and Steve could see him about to move again. He moved out of the way of a swift punch that was aimed at his head and grabbed Matt’s fist, holding it tightly.
“ I was dishonorably discharged and the Commandos were...I don’t know where they are. Bucky’s out there somewhere. We’re not on good terms. Not after that. He thinks I should've just followed orders.”
There was a startled gasp from the kid, she nearly fell out of her chair. She turned and fixed Clint with glower that nearly matched Steve's. The reactions were so similarly timed that Tony actually laughed.
Steve was pulled out of his thoughts by a warm hand on his shoulder. He was standing at the sink, washing the dishes, a large, stainless steel kitchen knife in his hand. He scrubbed the last of the food off it then set it down, turning to face Tony.
Tony’d had his eye on the lifeguard for a long time. There was just something about him he couldn’t let go no matter how hard he tried. Steve Rogers was something of an enigma to Tony Stark, it made him wildly uncomfortable. And horny, but mostly uncomfortable. Alright, it was equal parts horny and uncomfortable, but who says Tony had to admit that to anybody but himself?
